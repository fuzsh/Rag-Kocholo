        "text": "Years of Crisis (1919–1923)\n\nThe Republic was soon under attack from both left- and right-wing sources.\n\nThe radical left accused the ruling Social Democrats of having betrayed the ideals of the workers’ movement by preventing a communist revolution.\n\nVarious right-wing sources opposed any democratic system, preferring an authoritarian state like the 1871 Empire.\n\nTo further undermine the Republic’s credibility, some right-wingers (especially certain members of the former officer corps) also blamed an alleged conspiracy of Socialists and Jews for Germany’s defeat in World War I.\n\nIn the next five years, the central government, assured of the support of the Reichswehr dealt severely with the occasional outbreaks of violence in Germany’s large cities.\n\nThe left claimed that the Social Democrats had betrayed the ideals of the revolution, while the army and the government-financed Freikorps committed hundreds of acts of gratuitous violence against striking workers.\n\nThe first challenge to the Weimar Republic came when a group of communists and anarchists took over the Bavarian government in Munich and declared the creation of the Bavarian Soviet Republic.\n\nKapp-Putsch Freikorps Roßbach\n\nThe uprising was brutally attacked by Freikorps, which consisted mainly of ex-soldiers dismissed from the army and who were well-paid to kill the most active supporters of a democratic Germany.\n\nThe Freikorps was an army outside the control of the government, but they were in close contact with their allies in the Reichswehr.\n\nThe Kapp-Luttwitz Putsch took place on 13 March 1920: 5000 Freikorps soldiers occupied Berlin and installed Wolfgang Kapp (a right-wing journalist) as chancellor.\n\nThe national government fled to Stuttgart and called for a general strike against the putsch. The strike meant that no “official” pronouncements could be published, and with the civil service out on strike, the Kapp government collapsed after only four days on 17 March.\n\nInspired by the general strikes, a workers’ uprising began in the Ruhr region when 50,000 people formed a “Red Army” and took control of the province.\n\nThe regular army and the Freikorps ended the uprising on their own authority.\n\nThe rebels were campaigning for an extension of the plans to nationalise major industries and supported the national government, but the S.P.D. leaders did not want to lend support to the growing USPD, who favoured the establishment of a socialist regime.\n\nThe repression of an uprising of S.P.D. supporters by the reactionary forces in the Freikorps on the instructions of the S.P.D. ministers was to become a major source of conflict within the socialist movement and thus contributed to the weakening of the only movement that could have withstood the National Socialist movement.\n\nOther rebellions were put down in March 1921 in Saxony and Hamburg.\n\nWalther Rathenau\n\nTreaty of Rapallo\n\nIn 1922, Germany signed the Treaty of Rapallo with the Soviet Union, which allowed Germany to train military personnel in exchange for giving Russia military technology.\n\nThis was against the Treaty of Versailles, which limited Germany to 100,000 soldiers and no conscription, naval forces of 15,000 men, twelve destroyers, six battleships, and six cruisers, no submarines or aircraft, however, Russia had pulled out of World War I against the Germans as a result of the 1917 Russian Revolution, and was excluded from the League of Nations, thus Germany seized the chance to make an ally.\n\nWalther Rathenau, the Jewish Foreign Minister who signed the treaty, was assassinated two months later by two ultra-nationalist army officers.\n\nHyperinflation\n\nIn the early postwar years, inflation was growing at an alarming rate, but the government simply printed more and more banknotes to pay the bills.\n\nBy 1923, the Republic claimed it could no longer afford the reparations payments required by the Versailles Treaty, and the government defaulted on some payments.\n\nIn response, French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr region, Germany’s most productive industrial region at the time, taking control of most mining and manufacturing companies in January 1923.\n\nStrikes were called, and passive resistance was encouraged.\n\nThese strikes lasted eight months, further damaging the economy and the social life.\n\nThe strike prevented some goods from being produced, but one industrialist, Hugo Stinnes, was able to create a vast empire out of bankrupt companies.\n\nBecause the production costs in Germany were falling almost hourly, the prices for German products were unbeatable.\n\nStinnes made sure that he was paid in dollars, which meant that by mid-1923, his industrial empire was worth more than the entire German economy.\n\nBy the end of the year, over two hundred factories were working full-time to produce paper for the spiralling bank note production.\n\nStinnes’ empire collapsed when the government-sponsored inflation was stopped in November 1923.\n\nIn 1919 one loaf of bread cost 1 mark; by 1923 the same loaf of bread cost 100 billion marks.\n\nSince striking workers were paid benefits by the state, much additional currency was printed, fueling a period of hyperinflation.\n\nThe 1920s German inflation started when Germany had no goods to trade.\n\nThis also led to pay raises for workers and for businessmen who wanted to profit from it. Circulation of money rocketed, and soon banknotes were being overprinted to a thousand times their nominal value and every town produced its own promissory notes.\n\nThis led to further criticism of the Republic. On 15 November 1923, a new currency, the Rentenmark, was introduced at the rate of 1 trillion (1,000,000,000,000) Papiermark for one Rentenmark, an action known as a monetary reset.\n\nAt that time, one U.S. dollar was equal to 4.2 Rentenmark.\n\nReparation payments resumed, and the Ruhr was returned to Germany under the Locarno Pact, which defined a border between Germany, France and Belgium.\n\nFurther pressure from the right came in 1923 with the Beer Hall Putsch, also called the Munich Putsch, staged by the NSDAP under Adolf Hitler in Munich.\n\nIn 1920, the German Workers’ Party had become the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (NSDAP), and would become a driving force in the collapse of Weimar.\n\nHitler named himself chairman of the party in July 1921.\n\nOn 8 November 1923, the Kampfbund, in a pact with Erich Ludendorff, took over a meeting by Bavarian prime minister Gustav von Kahr at a beer hall in Munich.\n\nAdolf Hitler in Landsberg\n\nMein Kampf\n\nLudendorff and Hitler declared that the Weimar government was deposed and that they were planning to take control of Munich the following day.\n\nThe 3,000 rebels were thwarted by the Bavarian authorities.\n\nHitler was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison for high treason, a minimum sentence for the charge.\n\nIn the event, he served less than eight months in a comfortable cell in Festung Lansberg, receiving a daily stream of visitors before his release on 20 December 1924.\n\nWhile in jail, Hitler dictated Mein Kampf, which laid out his ideas and future policies. Hitler now decided to focus on legal methods of gaining power.\n\nDas goldene Zeitalter (1924–1929)\n\nProminent features of this period were a growing economy and a consequent decrease in civil unrest.\n\nOnce civil stability had been restored, Stresemann began stabilising the German currency, which promoted confidence in the German economy and helped the recovery that was so ardently needed for the German nation to keep up with their reparation repayments, while at the same time feeding and supplying the nation.\n\nChristmas broadcast of Wilhelm Marx in December 1923.\n\nMarx was the longest serving chancellor of the republic.\n\nTo help Germany meet reparation obligations, the Dawes Plan (1924) was created.\n\nThis was an agreement between American banks and the German government in which the American banks lent money to German banks with German assets as collateral to help it pay reparations.\n\nThe German railways, the National Bank and many industries were therefore mortgaged as securities for the stable currency and the loans.\n\nShortly after, the French and Germans agreed that the borders between their countries would not be changed by force, which meant that the Treaty of Versailles was being diluted by the signing countries.\n\nOther foreign achievements were the evacuation of the Ruhr in 1925 and the 1925 Treaty of Berlin, which reinforced the Treaty of Rapallo in 1922 and improved relations between the Soviet Union and Germany.\n\nIn 1926, Germany was admitted to the League of Nations as a permanent member, improving her international standing and giving her the ability to veto League of Nations legislation, however, this progress was funded by overseas loans, increasing the nation’s debts, while overall trade increased and unemployment fell.\n\nStresemann’s reforms did not relieve the underlying weaknesses of Weimar but gave the appearance of a stable democracy.\n\nThe major weakness in constitutional terms was the inherent instability of the coalitions. The growing dependence on American finance was to prove dangerous, and Germany was one of the worst hit nations in the Wall Street Crash of 1929.\n\nThe 1920s saw what some considered to be a remarkable cultural renaissance in Germany.\n\nDuring the worst phase of hyperinflation in 1923, the clubs and bars were full of speculators who spent their daily profits so they wouldn’t lose the value the following day.\n\nBerlin intellectuals responded by condemning the excesses of capitalism, and demand revolutionary changes on the cultural scenery.\n\nInfluenced by the brief cultural explosion in the Soviet Union, German literature, cinema, theatre and music worlds entered a phase of great creativity.\n\nInnovative street theatre brought plays to the public, the cabaret scene and jazz band became very popular.\n\nMany young women German women of the time were Americanised, wearing makeup, short hair, smoking and breaking with traditional mores.\n\nThe euphoria surrounding Josephine Baker in the metropolis Berlin for instance, declared “erotic goddess” and in many ways admired and respected, kindled further “ultramodern” sensations in the minds of the German public.\n\nBauhaus\n\nA new type of architecture taught at “Bauhaus” schools, and Art reflected the new ideas of the time, with artists such as George Grosz being fined for defaming the military and for blasphemy.\n\nExamples of the new architecture include the Bauhaus Building by Gropius, Grosses Schauspielhaus, and the Einstein Tower.\n\nNot everyone, however, was happy with the changes taking place in Weimar culture. Conservatives and reactionaries feared that Germany was betraying her traditional values by adopting popular styles from abroad, particularly the U.S. Hollywood popularised American film, while New York became the global capital of fashion.\n\nGermany was more susceptible to Americanisation, because of the close economic links brought about by the Dawes plan.\n\nIn 1929, three years after receiving the 1926 Nobel Peace Prize, Stresemann died of a heart attack at age 51.\n\nWhen stocks on the New York Stock Exchange crashed in October, the inevitable knock-on effects on the German economy brought the “Golden Twenties” to an abrupt end.\n\nDecline (1930–1933)\n\nn 1929, the onset of the depression in the United States of America produced a severe shock wave in Germany.\n\nThe economy was supported by the granting of loans through the Dawes Plan (1924) and the Young Plan (1929).\n\nWhen American banks withdrew their loans to German companies the onset of severe unemployment could not be stopped by conventional economic measures.\n\nUnemployment grew rapidly and in September 1930 a political earthquake shook the republic to its foundations.\n\nReichstag\n\nThe NSDAP entered the Reichstag with 19% of the popular vote and made the fragile coalition system by which every chancellor had governed, unworkable.\n\nThe last years of the Weimar Republic were stamped by even more political instability than in the previous years.\n\nThe administrations of Chancellors Brüning, Papen, Schleicher and Hitler (from 30 January to 23 March 1933) governed through presidential decree, rather than through consultation with the Reichstag (the German parliament).\n\nHeinrich Brüning\n\nHindenburg\n\nThe finance expert Heinrich Brüning was appointed as successor of Chancellor Müller by Reichspräsident Paul von Hindenburg on 29 March 1930, after months of political lobbying by General Kurt von Schleicher on behalf of the military.\n\nThe new government was expected to lead a political shift towards conservatism, based on the emergency powers granted to the Reichspräsident by the constitution, since it had no majority support in the Reichstag.\n\nAfter a bill to reform the Reich’s finances was opposed by the Reichstag, Hindenburg established the bill as an emergency decree based on Article 48 of the constitution.\n\nOn 18 July, the bill was again invalidated by a slim majority in the Reichstag with the support of the SPD, KPD, the (then small) NSDAP and DNVP.\n\nImmediately afterwards, Brüning submitted to the Reichstag the president’s decree that it would be dissolved.\n\nThe Reichstag general elections on 14 September resulted in an enormous political shift: 18.3% of the vote went to the NSDAP, five times the percentage compared to 1928.\n\nIt was no longer possible to form a pro-republican majority in the Reichstag, not even a Grand Coalition of all major parties except the KPD, NSDAP and DNVP.\n\nThis encouraged the supporters of the Nazis to force their claim to power by increasing organization of public demonstrations and paramilitary violence against rival paramilitary groups.\n\nFrom 1930–1932, Brüning tried to reform the devastated state without a majority in Parliament, governing with the help of the President’s emergency decrees.\n\nDuring that time, the Great Depression reached its low point. In line with conservative economic theory that less government spending would spur economic growth, Brüning drastically cut state expenditures, including in the social sector.\n\nHe expected and accepted that the economic crisis would, for a while, deteriorate before things would improve.\n\nAmong others, the Reich completely halted all public grants to the obligatory unemployment insurance (which had been introduced only in 1927), which resulted in higher contributions by the workers and fewer benefits for the unemployed.\n\nThe bulk of German capitalists and land-owners originally supported the conservative experiment: not from any personal liking for Brüning, but believing the conservatives would best serve their interests.\n\nAlfred Hugenberg\n\nBut as the mass of the working class and middle classes turned against Brüning, more of the great capitalists and landowners declared themselves in favour of his opponents—Hitler and Hugenberg.\n\nBy late 1931, conservatism as a movement was dead, and the time was coming when Hindenburg and the Reichswehr would drop Brüning and come to terms with Hugenberg and Hitler.\n\nAlthough Hindenburg disliked Hugenberg and despised Hitler, he was no less a supporter of the sort of anti-democratic counter-revolution represented by the DNVP and NSDAP.\n\nOn 30 May 1932, Brüning resigned after no longer having Hindenburg’s support.\n\nFive weeks earlier, Hindenburg had been re-elected Reichspräsident with Brüning’s active support, running against Hitler (the president was directly elected by the people while the Reichskanzler was not).\n\nThe Von Papen Deal\n\nReichskanzler Franz von Papen\n\nHindenburg then appointed Franz von Papen as new Reichskanzler.\n\nVon Papen lifted the ban on the NSDAP’s SA paramilitary, imposed after the street riots, in an unsuccessful attempt to secure the backing of Hitler.\n\nVon Papen was closely associated with the industrialist and land-owning classes, and pursued an extreme Conservative policy along Hindenburg’s lines.\n\nHe appointed as Reichswehr Minister Kurt von Schleicher, and all the members of the new cabinet were of the same political opinion as Hindenburg.\n\nThis government was expected to assure itself of the co-operation of Hitler.\n\nSince the Republicans were not yet ready to take action, the Communists did not want to support the republic, and the Conservatives had shot their political bolt, Hitler and Hugenberg were certain to achieve power.\n\nElections of July 1932\n\nHarzburger Front of 1931, a coalition of nationalist conservatives and the extreme right\n\nBecause most parties opposed the new government, von Papen had the Reichstag dissolved and called for new elections.\n\nThe general elections on 31 July 1932 yielded major gains for the KPD and the NSDAP, who won 37.2% of the vote, supplanting the Social Democrats as the largest party in the Reichstag.\n\nThe new question was what part the now immense National Socialist Party would play in the Government of the country.\n\nThe NSDAP owed its huge increase to growing support from middle-class people, whose traditional parties were swallowed up by the National Socialists.\n\nThe millions of radical adherents at first forced the Party towards the Left.\n\nThey wanted a renewed Germany and a new organisation of German society.\n\nThe left of the NSDAP strove desperately against any drift into the train of such capitalist and feudal reactionaries, therefore Hitler refused ministry under Papen, and demanded the chancellorship for himself, but was rejected by Hindenburg on 13 August 1932.\n\nThere was still no majority in the Reichstag for any government; as a result, the Reichstag was dissolved and elections took place once more in the hope that a stable majority would result.\n\nReichskanzler\n\nGeneral Kurt von Schleicher\n\nThe 6 November 1932 elections yielded 33.1% for the NSDAP, two million voters fewer than in the previous election.\n\nFranz von Papen stepped down and was succeeded by General Kurt von Schleicher as Reichskanzler on 3 December.\n\nSchleicher, a political army officer, had developed in an atmosphere of semi-obscurity and intrigue that encompassed the Republican military policy.\n\nHe had for years been in the camp of those supporting the Conservative counter-revolution.\n\nSchleicher’s bold and unsuccessful plan was to build a majority in the Reichstag by uniting the trade unionist left wings in the various parties, including that of the National Socialists led by Gregor Strasser.\n\nThis did not prove successful either.\n\nIn this brief Presidential Dictatorship entr’acte, Schleicher took the role of ‘Socialist General’, and entered into relations with the Christian Trade Unions, the left-wing members of the NSDAP and even with the Social Democrats.\n\nSchleicher planned for a sort of labour government under his Generalship.\n\nBut the Reichswehr officers were not prepared for this, the working class had a natural distrust of their future allies, and great capitalists and landowners did not like the plans. The SPD and KPD could have achieved success building on a Berlin transport strike.\n\nHitler learned from von Papen that the general had no authority to abolish the Reichstag parliament, whereas any majority of seats did.\n\nThe cabinet (under a previous interpretation of Article 48) ruled without a sitting Reichstag, which could vote only for its own dissolution.\n\nHitler also learned that all past crippling Nazi debts were to be relieved by German big business.\n\nOn 22 January, Hitler’s efforts to persuade Oskar von Hindenburg (the President’s son) included threats to bring criminal charges over estate taxation irregularities at the President’s Neudeck estate (although 5,000 acres (20 km2) extra were soon allotted to Hindenburg’s property).\n\nOutmaneuvered by von Papen and Hitler on plans for the new cabinet, and having lost Hindenburg’s confidence, Schleicher asked for new elections.\n\nOn 28 January, von Papen described Hitler to Paul von Hindenburg as only a minority part of an alternative, von Papen-arranged government.\n\nThe four great political movements, the SPD, KPD, Centre, and the NSDAP were in opposition.\n\nOn 29 January, Hitler and von Papen thwarted a last-minute threat of an officially sanctioned Reichswehr takeover, and on 30 January 1933 Hindenburg accepted the new Papen-Nationalist-Hitler coalition with the Nazis holding only three of 11 Cabinet seats. Later that day, the first cabinet meeting was attended by only two political parties, representing a minority in the Reichstag: The NSDAP and the DNVP led by Alfred Hugenberg (196 + 52 seats).\n\nEyeing the Catholic Centre Party’s 70 (+ 20 BVP) seats, Hitler refused their leader’s demands for constitutional “concessions” (amounting to protection) and planned for dissolution of the Reichstag.\n\nMachtergreifung\n\nHindenburg, despite his misgivings about the National Socialist’s goals and about Hitler as a person, reluctantly agreed to Papen’s theory that, with NSDAP popular support on the wane, Hitler could now be controlled as chancellor.\n\nThis date, dubbed by the National Socialists as the Machtergreifung (seizure of power), is commonly seen as the beginning of the Third Reich, however, the phase of German history in which the democratic principles of the constitution and personal liberty came to an end, was the appointment of Brüning as Chancellor by Hindenburg.\n\nReasons for the Failure of the Weimar Republic\n\nThe reasons for the Weimar Republic’s collapse are the subject of continuing debate.\n\nIt may have been doomed from the beginning since even moderates disliked it and extremists on both the left and right loathed it.\n\nGermany had limited democratic traditions and Weimar democracy was widely seen as chaotic, and since Weimar politicians had been blamed for the Dolchstoßlegende – a then widely believed theory that Germany’s surrender in World War I had been the unnecessary act of traitors – the popular legitimacy of the government was on shaky ground.\n\nNo single reason can explain the failure of the Weimar Republic.\n\nThe most commonly asserted causes can be grouped into three categories: economic problems, institutional problems and the roles of specific individuals.\n\nFrom Gefreiter to Reichskanzler"
