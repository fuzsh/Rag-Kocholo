During this time, the value of the German mark plummeted. It led to severe social and economic hardships for everyday Germans who struggled to afford basic necessities. The crisis ultimately eroded public trust in the Weimar Republic and was one of the causes of its eventual collapse.",

        "text": "What is hyperinflation?\n\nHyperinflation is an extremely rapid and uncontrolled price increases in a nation’s currency.\n\nIt occurs when a country experiences inflation rates exceeding 50% per month.\n\nAs a result, the purchasing power of currency also diminishes at a rapid rate. This means that the cost of products keeps rising.\n\nPeople then start to panic and lose confidence in how much items cost.\n\nOften, this encourages individuals to hoard goods or use alternative forms of currency, such as foreign currencies.\n\nWhat were the causes of Germany’s hyperinflation?\n\nThe end of World War I in 1918 left Germany in a precarious economic situation.\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles, which was signed in June 1919, imposed heavy war reparations on the country.\n\nA staggering debt of 132 billion gold marks was placed upon Germany, which was to be paid to the Allied countries.\n\nThe primary cause of hyperinflation in Germany was the government's decision to print money to pay for war reparations; this led to inflation.\n\nAs the value of the mark decreased, the government printed even more money, creating a vicious cycle.\n\nAt its peak, the inflation rate reached a staggering 29,500% per month in October 1923.\n\nThis astronomical rate meant that prices of items doubled approximately every 3.7 days.\n\nIn such an environment, the German mark became virtually worthless, and people needed wheelbarrows full of money to buy basic items like bread.\n\nWhat made the situation much worse was the loss of confidence in the banking system.\n\nWith prices rising rapidly, people started hoarding goods and foreign currencies.\n\nThis behavior has a further negative impact on the economy. As a result, money circulated faster as people rushed to spend it before it lost more value.\n\nThe situation worsened in 1923 when France and Belgium occupied the Ruhr region: a key industrial area.\n\nThis was in direct response to Germany's failure to make a series of reparations payments.\n\nThe occupation disrupted industrial production and trade.\n\nThe dramatic impact of hyperinflation\n\nAs the prices of everyday goods skyrocketed, the value of savings and wages eroded rapidly.\n\nMany people were horrified to see their life savings becoming worthless overnight. Panic began to spread.\n\nWorkers demanded higher wages, but these increases could not keep pace with the soaring cost of living; consequently, some families faced poverty and hunger for the first time in their lives.\n\nThe middle class, which had traditionally been the economic backbone of German society, was particularly hard hit.\n\nTheir savings vanished, and many faced financial ruin. This erosion of middle-class wealth contributed to a sense of betrayal and disillusionment with the Weimar Republic.\n\nBusinesses also faced their own challenges as the cost of materials and production became unpredictable.\n\nAs business confidence faltered, the economy as a whole suffered from instability."
