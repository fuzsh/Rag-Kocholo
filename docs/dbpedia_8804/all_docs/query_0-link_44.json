It formed the German Empire when it united the German states in 1871. It was de facto dissolved by an emergency decree transferring powers of the Prussian government to German Chancellor Franz von Papen in 1932 and de jure by an Allied decree in 1947. For centuries, the House of Hohenzollern ruled Prussia, expanding its size with the Prussian Army. Prussia, with its capital at Königsberg and then, when it became the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701, Berlin, decisively shaped the history of Germany.\n\nThe name Prussia derives from the Old Prussians; in the 13th century, the Teutonic Knights—an organized Catholic medieval military order of German crusaders—conquered the lands inhabited by them. In 1308, the Teutonic Knights conquered the region of Pomerelia with Danzig\n\n(modern-day Gdańsk). Their monastic state was mostly Germanised through immigration from central and western Germany, and, in the south, it was Polonised by settlers from Masovia. The imposed Second Peace of Thorn (1466) split Prussia into the western Royal Prussia, becoming a province of Poland, and the eastern part, from 1525 called the Duchy of Prussia, a feudal fief of the Crown of Poland up to 1657. The union of Brandenburg and the Duchy of Prussia in 1618 led to the proclamation of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701.\n\nPrussia entered the ranks of the great powers shortly after becoming a kingdom.[3][4] It became\n\nincreasingly large and powerful in the 18th and 19th centuries. It had a major voice in European affairs under the reign of Frederick the Great (1740–1786). At the Congress of Vienna (1814–15), which redrew the map of Europe following Napoleon's defeat, Prussia acquired rich new territories, including the coal-rich Ruhr. The country then grew rapidly in influence economically and politically, and became the core of the North German Confederation in 1867, and then of the German Empire in 1871. The Kingdom of Prussia was now so large and so dominant in the new Germany that Junkers and other Prussian élites identified more and more as Germans and less as Prussians.\n\nThe Kingdom ended in 1918 along with other German monarchies that were terminated by the German Revolution. In the Weimar Republic, the Free State of Prussia lost nearly all of its legal and political importance following the 1932 coup led by Franz von Papen. Subsequently, it was effectively dismantled into Nazi German Gaue in 1935. Nevertheless, some Prussian ministries were kept and Hermann Göring remained in his role as Minister President of Prussia until the end of World War II. Former eastern territories of Germany that made up a significant part of Prussia lost the majority of their German population after 1945 as the Polish People's Republic and the Soviet Union both absorbed these territories and had most of its German inhabitants expelled by 1950. Prussia, deemed \"a bearer of militarism and reaction\" by the Allies, was officially abolished by an Allied declaration in 1947. The international status of the former eastern territories of the Kingdom of Prussia was disputed until the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany in 1990, but its return to Germany remains a cause among far-right politicians, the Federation of Expellees and various political revanchists and irredentists.\n\n1157 – 1618 (1806) (HRE)\n\n(Bohemia 1373 – 1415)\n\n1224 – 1525\n\n(Polish fief 1466 – 1525)\n\nDuchy of Prussia\n\n1525 – 1618 (1701)\n\n(Polish fief 1525 – 1657)\n\nMalbork Voivodeship and Prince-Bishopric of Warmia within Royal (Polish) Prussia, Poland 1454/1466 – 1772)\n\nBrandenburg-Prussia\n\n1618 – 1701\n\nKingdom in Prussia\n\n1701 – 1772\n\nKingdom of Prussia\n\n1772 – 1918\n\nFree State of Prussia (Germany)\n\n1918 – 1947\n\nKlaipė da Regio n\n\n(Lithuani a)\n\n1920 – 1939 / 1945 –\n\nDziałdowo area\n\n(Poland 1918-present)\n\nWarmia, Masuria, Powiśle within Recovered Territories\n\n(Poland 1945 – present)\n\nBerlin and Brandenburg\n\n(Germany)\n\nKaliningr ad Oblast\n\n(Russia)\n\npresen 1947 – 1952 / 1990 – t present\n\n1945 – present\n\nThe main coat of arms of Prussia, as well as the flag of Prussia, depicted a black eagle on a white background.\n\nThe black and white national colours were already used by the Teutonic Knights and by the Hohenzollern dynasty. The Teutonic Order wore a white coat embroidered with a black cross with gold insert and black imperial eagle. The combination of the black and white colours with the white and red Hanseatic colours of the free cities Bremen, Hamburg and Lübeck, as well as of Brandenburg, resulted in the black-white-red commercial flag of the North German\n\nConfederation, which became the flag of the German Empire in 1871.[citation needed]\n\nSuum cuique (\"to each, his own\"), the motto of the Order of the Black Eagle created by King Frederick I in 1701, was often associated with the whole of Prussia. The Iron Cross, a military decoration created by King Frederick William III in 1813, was also commonly associated with the\n\ncountry.[citation needed] The region, originally populated by Baltic Old Prussians who were\n\nChristianised, became a favoured location for immigration by (later mainly Protestant) Germans (see Ostsiedlung), as well as Poles and Lithuanians along the border regions.\n\nTerritory[edit]\n\nBefore its abolition, the territory of the Free State of Prussia included the provinces of East Prussia; Brandenburg; Saxony (including much of the present-day state of Saxony-Anhalt and parts of the state of Thuringia in Germany); Pomerania; Rhineland; Westphalia; Silesia (without Austrian Silesia); Schleswig-Holstein; Hanover; Hesse-Nassau; and a small detached area in the south called Hohenzollern, the ancestral home of the Prussian ruling family. The land that the Teutonic Knights occupied was flat and covered with fertile soil. The area was perfectly\n\nsuited to the large-scale raising of wheat.[5] The rise of early Prussia was based on the raising\n\nand selling of wheat. Teutonic Prussia became known as the \"bread basket of Western Europe\"\n\nSituation after the conquest in the late 13th century. Areas in purple under control of the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights.\n\nThe Teutonic Order (orange) following the Second Peace of Thorn (1466)\n\nMain article: Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights\n\nIn 1211 King Andrew II of Hungary granted Burzenland in Transylvania as a fiefdom to the Teutonic Knights, a German military order of crusading knights, headquartered in the Kingdom of Jerusalem at Acre. In 1225 he expelled them, and they transferred their operations to the Baltic Sea area. Konrad I, the Polish duke of Masovia, had unsuccessfully attempted to conquer\n\npagan Prussia in crusades in 1219 and 1222.[8] In 1226 Duke Konrad invited the Teutonic\n\nKnights to conquer the Baltic Prussian tribes on his borders.\n\nDuring 60 years of struggles against the Old Prussians, the Order established an independent state that came to control Prūsa. After the Livonian Brothers of the Sword joined the Teutonic Order in 1237, the Order also controlled Livonia (now Latvia and Estonia). Around 1252 they finished the conquest of the northernmost Prussian tribe of the Skalvians as well as of the western Baltic Curonians, and erected Memel Castle, which developed into the major port city of Memel (Klaipėda). The Treaty of Melno defined the final border between Prussia and the adjoining Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1422.\n\nThe Hanseatic League officially formed in northern Europe in 1356 as a group of trading cities. This League came to hold a monopoly on all trade leaving the interior of Europe and\n\nScandinavia and on all sailing trade in the Baltic Sea for foreign countries.[9]\n\nIn the course of the Ostsiedlung (German eastward expansion) process, settlers were invited[by whom?], bringing changes in the ethnic composition as well as in language, culture, and law of\n\nthe eastern borders of the German lands. As a majority of these settlers were Germans, Low German became the dominant language.\n\nThe Knights of the Teutonic Order were subordinate to the papacy and to the emperor. Their initially close relationship with the Polish Crown deteriorated after they conquered Polish-controlled Pomerelia and Danzig (Gdańsk) in 1308. Eventually, Poland and Lithuania, allied through the Union of Krewo (1385), defeated the Knights in the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg) in 1410.\n\nThe Thirteen Years' War (1454–1466) began when the Prussian Confederation, a coalition of Hanseatic cities of western Prussia, rebelled against the Order and requested help from the Polish king, Casimir IV Jagiellon. The Teutonic Knights were forced to acknowledge the sovereignty of, and to pay tribute to Casimir IV in the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), losing western Prussia (Royal Prussia) to Poland in the process. Pursuant to the Second Peace of\n\nThorn, two Prussian states were established.[10][need quotation to verify]\n\nDuring the period of the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights, mercenaries from the Holy Roman Empire were granted lands by the Order and gradually formed a new landed Prussian nobility, from which the Junkers would evolve to take a major role in the militarization of Prussia\n\nand, later, Germany.[11]\n\nDuchy of Prussia[edit]\n\nFrom this time the Duchy of Prussia was in personal union with the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The resulting state, known as Brandenburg-Prussia, consisted of geographically disconnected territories in Prussia, Brandenburg, and the Rhineland lands of Cleves and Mark.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), various armies repeatedly marched across the disconnected Hohenzollern lands, especially the occupying Swedes. The ineffective and militarily weak Margrave George William (1619–1640) fled from Berlin to Königsberg, the historic capital of the Duchy of Prussia, in 1637. His successor, Frederick William I (1640–1688), reformed the army to defend the lands.\n\nFrederick William I went to Warsaw in 1641 to render homage to King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland for the Duchy of Prussia, which was still held in fief from the Polish crown. In January 1656, during the first phase of the Second Northern War (1654–1660), he received the duchy as a fief from the Swedish king who later granted him full sovereignty in the Treaty of Labiau (November 1656). In 1657 the Polish king renewed this grant in the treaties of Wehlau and Bromberg. With Prussia, the Brandenburg Hohenzollern dynasty now held a territory free of any feudal obligations, which constituted the basis for their later elevation to kings.\n\nThe \"Great Elector\" and his wife\n\nFrederick William I succeeded in organizing the electorate by establishing an absolute monarchy in Brandenburg-Prussia, an achievement for which he became known as the \"Great\n\nElector\". Above all, he emphasised the importance of a powerful military to protect the state's disconnected territories, while the Edict of Potsdam (1685) opened Brandenburg-Prussia for the immigration of Protestant refugees (especially Huguenots), and he established a bureaucracy to\n\ncarry out state administration efficiently.[13]\n\nKingdom of Prussia[edit]\n\nMain article: Kingdom of Prussia\n\nFrederick I, King in Prussia\n\nOn 18 January 1701, Frederick William's son, Elector Frederick III, elevated Prussia from a duchy to a kingdom and crowned himself King Frederick I. In the Crown Treaty of 16 November 1700, Leopold I, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, allowed Frederick only to title himself \"King in Prussia\", not \"King of Prussia\". The state of Brandenburg-Prussia became commonly known as \"Prussia\", although most of its territory, in Brandenburg, Pomerania, and western Germany, lay outside Prussia proper. The Prussian state grew in splendour during the reign of\n\nFrederick I, who sponsored the arts at the expense of the treasury.[14]\n\nAustrian Succession (1740–1748). Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI had died on 20 October 1740. He was succeeded to the throne by his daughter, Maria Theresa.\n\nBy defeating the Austrian Army at the Battle of Mollwitz on 10 April 1741, Frederick succeeded\n\nin conquering Lower Silesia (the northwestern half of Silesia).[21] In the next year, 1742, he\n\nconquered Upper Silesia (the southeastern half). Furthermore, in the third Silesian War (usually grouped with the Seven Years' War) Frederick won a victory over Austria at the Battle of Lobositz on 1 October 1756. In spite of some impressive victories afterward, his situation became far less comfortable the following years, as he failed in his attempts to knock Austria out of the war and was gradually reduced to a desperate defensive war. However, he never gave up and on 3 November 1760 the Prussian king won another battle, the hard-fought Battle of Torgau. Despite being several times on the verge of defeat Frederick, allied with Great Britain, Hanover and Hesse-Kassel, was finally able to hold the whole of Silesia against a\n\ncoalition of Saxony, the Habsburg monarchy, France and Russia.[22] Voltaire, a close friend of\n\nthe king, once described Frederick the Great's Prussia by saying \".. was Sparta in the morning, Athens in the afternoon.\"\n\nKing Frederick II, \"the Great\"\n\nSilesia, full of rich soils and prosperous manufacturing towns, became a vital region to Prussia,\n\ngreatly increasing the nation's area, population, and wealth.[23] Success on the battleground\n\nagainst Austria and other powers proved Prussia's status as one of the great powers of Europe. The Silesian Wars began more than a century of rivalry and conflict between Prussia and\n\nAustria as the two most powerful states operating within the Holy Roman Empire (although both\n\nhad extensive territory outside the empire).[24] In 1744, the County of East Frisia fell to Prussia\n\nfollowing the extinction of its ruling Cirksena dynasty.\n\nIn the last 23 years of his reign until 1786, Frederick II, who understood himself as the \"first servant of the state\", promoted the development of Prussian areas such as the Oderbruch. At the same time he built up Prussia's military power and participated in the First Partition of Poland with Austria and Russia in 1772, an act that geographically connected the Brandenburg territories with those of Prussia proper. During this period, he also opened Prussia's borders to immigrants fleeing from religious persecution in other parts of Europe, such as the Huguenots. Prussia became a safe haven in much the same way that the United States welcomed\n\nimmigrants seeking freedom in the 19th century.[25]\n\nFrederick the Great (reigned 1740–1786) practised enlightened absolutism. He built the world's best army, and usually won his many wars. He introduced a general civil code, abolished torture\n\nand established the principle that the Crown would not interfere in matters of justice.[26] He also\n\npromoted an advanced secondary education, the forerunner of today's German gymnasium (grammar school) system, which prepares the brightest pupils for university studies. The\n\nPrussian education system was emulated in various countries, including the United States.[25]"
