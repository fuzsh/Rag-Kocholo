        "text": "This listing is for two (2) German Reichsbanknotes. Each Zehntausend Mark (10,000 Marks) banknote was printed on 19 January, 1922.\n\nSerial numbers—\n\n1.) 21p•019175\n\n2.) O•10961657\n\nThese paper bills are in great condition for being over 96 years old, and are an excellent addition to any ephemera, coin, or history buff collection.\n\nFrom ‘Hyperinflation in Germany’ by Alex Q. Arbuckle, Mashable:\n\n“In 1914, the exchange rate of the German mark to the American dollar was about 4.2 to one. Nine years later, it was 4.2 trillion to one.\n\nThe out-of-control inflation began somewhat mildly during World War I, as the German government printed unbacked currency and borrowed money to finance military expenditures. The strategy was to eventually pay off the debts by seizing resource-rich territories and imposing reparations on the vanquished Allies.\n\nBut then Germany lost the war and ended up with massive debts and reparations to the Allies to be paid under the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nInflation crept up slowly at first, before accelerating rapidly in late 1922. The exchange rate ballooned from 2,000 marks per dollar to 20,000 to a million and beyond in just a few months, riding on a growing wave of economic panic and mistrust.\n\nAs the government commissioned 130 printing companies to churn out piles of increasingly worthless currency, Germans struggled to survive in increasingly absurd conditions. Waiters had to climb on top of tables to announce new menu prices every half hour. Workers brought wheelbarrows, sacks and suitcases to work to collect their wages.\n\nAccording to one story, a distracted worker found that his suitcase was stolen, with his wages dumped out and left behind. Many chose to avoid currency altogether, placing their faith in tangible assets to barter goods.”\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to let me know. Thanks for visiting my shop!"
