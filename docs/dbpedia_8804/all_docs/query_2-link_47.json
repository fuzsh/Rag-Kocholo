        "text": "hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic, economic disaster in the Weimar Republic in 1922–23 that impoverished millions of German citizens and paved the way for the rise of the Nazi Party.\n\nDuring World War I, prices in Germany had doubled, but that was just the start of the country’s economic troubles. In 1914, Germany abandoned its gold-backed currency, certain that the war would be short and could be financed by government borrowing until the costs were ultimately borne by the Allied powers. Instead, Germany was defeated, and the new German Weimar government was bound by the Treaty of Versailles, which was designed to ensure that Germany could never wage war on its neighbours again. The treaty’s terms—requiring, among other things, that payments to the Allies be made with gold-backed currency—put the Weimar government under significant financial pressure, such that it was unlikely that the ailing German economy would recover. The huge amount the Germans had to pay the Allies in reparation for the war meant they could not afford to buy imported goods, and the loss of their colonies meant they could not rely on cheap raw materials. At the same time, billions of marks hoarded during the war suddenly came back into circulation.\n\nThe rising cost of goods combined with a dramatic increase in the money supply created perfect conditions for inflation. Before World War I, the exchange rate was just over four marks to the U.S. dollar. By 1920 the value of the mark was 16 times less. It stabilized at 69 marks to the dollar for some months. The Weimar government was still in a position to get a grip on the economy; instead, it chose to print yet more money in order to pay the reparation debt. By July 1922 prices had risen by some 700 percent, and hyperinflation, with too much money chasing goods that were far too scarce, had arrived.\n\nThe government had to print million-mark notes, then billion-mark notes. By November 1923 one U.S. dollar was equivalent to 1,000 billion (a trillion) marks. Famously, it was observed at the time, a wheelbarrow full of money could not buy a newspaper, while one German student recalled ordering a cup of coffee for 5,000 marks and then a second whose cost had risen to 7,000 marks in the brief time it took him to finish the first. Shopkeepers could not replenish their stock fast enough to keep up with prices, farmers refused to sell their produce for worthless money, food riots broke out, pensioners starved, and townspeople marched into the countryside to loot the farms. Law and order broke down. The German attempt at democracy had been completely undermined. Conspiracy theories sprouted, and extremist political views became acceptable as Weimar’s currency became valueless to the point of meaninglessness. Ultimately, hyperinflation enabled Adolf Hitler to gain power, rising along with the leaders of a coalition of extreme right-wing parties before gaining control of the movement."
