        "text": "Following the 1918 collapse of the two major empires that ruled central Europe, Austria-Hungary and Germany, successor states inherited billions of increasingly depreciating paper monies. The conversion of imperial currencies posed enormous difficulties for successor states and exposed the limits of an emerging international order that rendered the pan-European predicament of defunct imperial currencies the problem of individual states. This article compares the first, and one of the last, conversions of imperial currencies, taking monetary transitions in Alsace-Lorraine (1918) and Transylvania (1920) as case studies. Although historians usually treat western and east-central European history separately, the conversion of imperial currencies produced similar outcomes in both the former Alsace-Lorraine and Transylvania. Differences emerge where one would not expect them: the phasing out of the paper mark was coupled with systematic ethnic discrimination against Germans in Alsace and Lorraine, while in Transylvania, some ethnic minorities even managed to benefit from the process.\n\n3 Angell, Norman, The Great Illusion: A Study of the Relation of Military Power in Nations to Their Economic and Social Advantage (New York: Putnam, 1910), 44Google Scholar; Angell, Norman, The Fruits of Victory, a Sequel to “The Great Illusion” (New York: The Century Co., 1921), 290Google Scholar.\n\n15 Margaret MacMillan, Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World, 1st US ed.

Such modification shall only be required if, in the opinion of the Commission, the foreign exchange value of the currency unit or units substituted for the currency unit in which the old bonds are expressed is substantially less at the date of the conversion than the foreign exchange value of the original currency unit.”\n\n150 Maier, Recasting Bourgeois Europe; Kuisel, Richard F., Capitalism and the State in Modern France: Renovation and Economic Management in the Twentieth Century (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press Archive, 1983)Google Scholar; Kuisel, Richard F., Ernest Mercier: French Technocrat (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Victor I.
