        "text": "The Federal Republic of Germany lies at the intersection of Central and Western Europe, bordered by Denmark to the north, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands to the west, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and the Czech Republic and Poland to the east.\n\nA global leader in scientific and technology as well as in industrial sectors, Germany has a firmly established economy and in fact, the largest economy in Europe. It is also the seat of the European Central Bank which is situated in Frankfurt.\n\nBefore the unification took place, German states had their own state bank and state currency. The Deutsche mark was West Germany’s legal tender from 1948 until 1990, replacing the Reichsmark. Later on, it became the official currency of unified Germany from 1990 until 2002. The first series of the Deutsche mark was issued by the Allied military while the second series was released by the Bank deutscher Lander in 1948. In 1960, a third series was introduced by the Bundesbank, highlighting paintings by Albrecht Durer, neutral designs, and buildings.\n\nIn 1990, another set of notes were released to address forgery advances. The banknotes feature German scientists and artists as well as tools and symbols of their respective field. Additionally, the buildings illustrated in the background of the banknotes’ front sides are related to the person featured on the note. The notes bear new security features such as a windowed security thread, microprinting, color-shifting ink, watermarks, intaglio printing, and see-through registration devices."
