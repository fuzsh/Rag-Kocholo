        "text": "What is old German money worth? (back to top)\n\nHow much old German paper money is worth on the market today? I can't tell you.\n\nThis page is about how past amounts in Marks can be converted to past and present US dollars.\n\nFor market values of old German bills you may have, I suggest looking on ebay under:\n\nEbay > Currency > Germany.\n\nSammler.com has a page Collector Values of Old German banknotes with lots of information.\n\nRichard Holmes was a collector of 1920s German Notgeld (inflationary \"emergency\" money) until 1997. He put together an excellent Notgeld website with historical background, scans and links, and a page on how they can be valued (scroll down for tables). [links updated 8/2/10, thanks to Harry Brown]\n\nI welcome suggestions for additions to this page: marcuse@history.ucsb.edu.\n\nIn 1938 Fritz earned 6000 Marks, what would his equivalent salary be today? (back to top)\n\nFirst, using the tables immediately below, convert the 1938 Marks to 1938 dollars.\n\nIn 1938, 2.49M=$1 or 12.4M=1£ means 6000M=$2409= £484.\n\nNow go to the inflation calculators section below, and see what $2409 (or £484) in 1938 would be worth today (the MeasuringWorth.com calculator is excellent--I think it might be more accurate to use the UK calculator than the US calculator, as Germany's economic indicators may have tracked those more closely). Inflating to the year 2017 the various indexes yield the following results:\n\n£29,400 or $41,900 using the Consumer Price Index\n\n£27,500 or $33,700 using the GDP deflator\n\n$98,100 using the value of consumer bundle [reconverting in 2017: £70,700]\n\n£78,500 or $91,000 using the average earnings / unskilled wage *\n\n£132,000 or $214,000 using the nominal GDP per capita [good for estimating the \"status\" of that income]\n\n£183,000 or $537,000 using the relative share of GDP [good for estimating the share of national wealth]\n\nWhich measure would be most appropriate? Read the explanatory page on the MeasuringWorth.com site, Choosing the Best Indicator to Measure Relative Worth. For a salary or annual income, you will see that the \"Consumer Bundle\" or \"GDP per capita\" would be the best measures.\n\nThus Fritz's salary would be between $98,100 and $214,000 today [Or $170,000 inflating the UK £.]\n\nOr using the UK inflator and converting the £ to $: £132,000 = $170,000 in 2017 would be the high end instead of $214k.\n\nFor the value of a simple commodity (loaf of bread, gallon of gas), you'd use the CPI.\n\nFor the cost of a building or public works project, you'd use the GDP deflator.\n\nGood luck with your historical conversion!\n\nLinks (back to top)\n\nCPI-based inflation calculator, from 1800 to present for US $ (westegg.com)\n\nThe Consumer Price Index is good for comparing goods in daily use (salaries, food).\n\ncreated by Steven Morgan Friedman, a 1998 history major from UPenn, who became an excellent programmer-web designer (Friedman's CV).\n\nUS Gov't CPI table, 1913-present, indexed 1982-84=100 (for US cities ); monthly+annual avg.\n\nThe same 1913-present table, but with annual averages, and annual percentages\n\n1800-present table of annual averages, with 1967=100\n\nInflation calculator, 1913-present, for US $, by US gov't Bureau of Labor & Statistics\n\nNASA's inflation calculator page (for US $, 1940 to 2009), includes links to:\n\na CPI index running from 1913 to 2003.The CPI index is best for consumer goods.\n\na GDP Deflator Inflation Calculator, which is better for industrial goods and construction projects.\n\nfor a discussion comparing CPI, GDP and other measures see this page at measuringworth.com.\n\nThe CPI is, of course, most accurate for consumer goods.\n\nFor additional historical currency links, see this H-German e-mail exchange, Aug. 2005, which includes the following table:\n\nImplicit GNP Deflator 1913=100 (Germany, 1901-1995, gap 1914-1924)\n\n1901 87.3\n\n1902 86.2\n\n1903 86.0\n\n1904 85.9\n\n1905 89.9\n\n1906 92.2\n\n1907 93.1\n\n1908 91.3\n\n1909 93.5\n\n1910 96.5\n\n1911 96.8\n\n1912 99.3\n\n1913 100.0\n\n1914 n.a.\n\n1915 n.a.\n\n1916 n.a. 1917 n.a.\n\n1918 n.a.\n\n1919 n.a.\n\n1920 n.a.\n\n1921 n.a.\n\n1922 n.a.\n\n1923 n.a.\n\n1924 n.a.\n\n1925 140.9\n\n1926 144.2\n\n1927 147.3\n\n1928 152.8\n\n1929 155.7\n\n1930 154.9\n\n1931 146.1\n\n1932 131.6\n\n1933 125.3\n\n1934 126.4\n\n1935 125.6\n\n1936 125.1\n\n1937 126.0\n\n1938 128.1\n\n1939 130.1\n\n1940 125.8\n\n1941 120.1\n\n1942 118.4\n\n1943 120.2\n\n1944 126.5\n\n1945 n.a.\n\n1946 161.4\n\n1947 171.6\n\n1948 198.5 1948 198.5\n\n1949 211.6\n\n1950 204.8\n\n1951 229.3\n\n1952 240.4\n\n1953 237.9\n\n1954 237.5\n\n1955 242.5\n\n1956 249.3\n\n1957 256.5\n\n1958 264.5\n\n1959 268.9\n\n1960 276.8\n\n1961 290.4\n\n1962 302.0\n\n1963 311.5 1964 321.1\n\n1965 333.1\n\n1966 344.5\n\n1967 349.8\n\n1968 357.7\n\n1969 372.7\n\n1970 401.2\n\n1971 432.4\n\n1972 455.4\n\n1973 484.0\n\n1974 517.9\n\n1975 548.0\n\n1976 567.7\n\n1977 589.0\n\n1978 614.0\n\n1979 638.0 1980 669.3\n\n1981 696.7\n\n1982 727.7\n\n1983 752.8\n\n1984 768.5\n\n1985 785.4\n\n1986 811.3\n\n1987 827.0\n\n1988 837.1\n\n1989 857.4\n\n1990 884.6\n\n1991 919.1\n\n1992 969.2\n\n1993 1,005.8\n\n1994 1,029.1\n\n1995 1,051.8\n\nTable based on one submitted by Prof. Albrecht Ritschl (Humboldt University, Berlin.), who used the source: Albrecht Ritschl and Mark Spoerer,: \"Das Bruttosozialprodukt in Deutschland nach den amtlichen Volkseinkommens- und Sozialproduktsstatistiken 1901-1995,\" in: Jahrbuch fuer Wirtschaftsgeschichte (1997), part 2, 11-37.
