        "text": "This Weimar Republic-era banknote represents the 1st version of the 2 Mark Darlehenskassenscheine (1920). Darlehenskassenscheine (lit. Loan-Cash Certificate) were a special currency, that paralleled the German Goldmark. The notes were backed by loans on industrial and agricultural goods. In accordance with the Loan Fund Act of August 4, 1914 (RGBl. P. 340).\n\nThey were issued during WW1 (1914-1918) and the early Weimar Republic (1919-1933). For most Germans they were considered the de-facto currency. Until the introduction of the Papiermark (Papermark), in 1923. Which itself was replaced by the Retenmark, in November 1923. (Read our article \"On the Financial Brink, Germany\", for additional details on Papiermark.)\n\nObserve\n\nThe observe's header roughly translates to \"Debt Note * Two Marks\", or in the literal sense \"Loan-Cash Certificate * Two Mark\". The observe's center text lists the the note's \"2 Mark\" value, with additional subtext below. This subtext lists the note as being issued on the 1st of March 1920, in Berlin. Unfortunately, the signatures below (footer), currently can't be interpreted.\n\nThe note's print and underprint are fairly elaborate, particularly for an alternative currency. The underprint appears to be a fractal-based microprint, made of interlinked circles. The main print (excluding red center) uses an eccentric off-white on redish-blue \"curling leaf\" pattern, with red flowers. While neighboring header and footer utilize a tannish-red on reddish-beige \"snowflake\" microprint pattern. This somewhat harsh color scheme was replaced, on this note's 2nd variant.\n\nThe observe utilizes a pair of authentication stamps, representing the Imperial Debt Administration. The left stamp is a simple seal, while right stamp features an easily recognized raised/textured design. The observe also features wrap-around text, which outlines a list of legal warnings. Threating imprisonment for either creating, obtaining, and/or distributing falsified/counterfeit versions of this note.\n\nTranslation\n\n\"Debt Note\"\n\n-Header Text-\n\nâ€œ2 Marks\"\n\n\"Berlin, 1 March 1920\"\n\n-Main Text-\n\n\"Whoever falsifies or counterfeits debt notes, procures falsified or counterfeit debt notes, and bring them into circulation, will be imprisoned for no less than two years.\"\n\n-Wrap-Around Text-\n\n\"Imperial Debt Administration\"\n\n-Left/Right Stamps-\n\nReverse\n\nThe reverse's center features the note's \"2 Mark\" value, flanked by two Reichsadler (German Imperial Eagle). This is surrounded by an ornate wrap-around frame, resembling embroidery. The note's value is reinforced by a stylized number 2, on each corner. In addition to a under printed of number 2s, clustered into groups of 4, and spaced by \"cross-like\" symbols.\n\nTranslation\n\n\"Debt Note\"\n\n\"2 Two Mark 2\"\n\n-Primary Text-\n\nAdditional Notes"
