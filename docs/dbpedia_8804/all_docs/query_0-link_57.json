        "text": "This paper examines exchange-rate and price-level data for the long period 1590-2009 for the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (earlier the Dutch Republic and England), countries that at various times over this near four century span have differed substantially in terms of the pace at which their economies were developing, have operated under a variety of exchange rate regimes, and have been subjected to an extremely wide variety of real shocks. The principal conclusion of this study is the resiliency of the simple purchasing-power-parity model and of the law of one price at the microeconomic level. Both take some heavy blows during this close to four-century long sample period. In the end, however, they emerge surprisingly unscathed. Real factors at times appear to have had substantial effects on real exchange rates and hence PPP, but such effects ultimately dissipate. As a long-run equilibrium condition, PPP holds up remarkably well.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to analyse which kinds of monetary taxation and coinage policies the minting authorities applied in Sweden in the period 1153-1512. In medieval Europe, old coins were frequently declared invalid and were exchanged for new ones at xed rates and dates. Here, the question of whether and when such periodic recoinage was applied in medieval Sweden is analyzed against the historical record. A theory of how short-lived and long-lived coinage systems work is applied to Swedish coinage. Sweden adopted similar coin forms as those minted in Continental Europe in the Middle Ages, but also adopted the corresponding continental coinage and monetary taxation policies linked to these coin forms. Swedish experience is extraordinarily well in line with what one would expect from the theory of short-lived coins. Economic backwardness, limited mone-tization of society and separate currency areas facilitated recoinage. Recoinage with varying frequency was applied in 1180-1290 when only bracteates were minted. This is evidenced by many different coin types per reign, coin hoards which are dominated by a few types and dating of types to speci c periods of the kings' reigns. However, monetization increased in the late thirteenth century, making recoinage more dif cult. and bracteates were replaced by long-lived two-faced coins in 1290. With an end to recoinage, the Swedish kings then accelerated the debasement of the long-lived coins. The disappearing recoinage fees were compensated for by debasing the silver content. Such debasements-interrupted by several coinage reforms-were applied until the beginning of the sixteenth century.\n\nThis Working Paper presents and discusses Swedish Historical National Accounts back to 1560 in both current and constant prices. With current prices, this paper provides a major extension of our prior WP 123. It also presents some revisions and additions to earlier data. The main result from the earlier paper of a long secular cycle with troughs around 1600 and 1800 and a peak around 1700 still holds, but there are new aspects on long term development and structural changes from the analysis of both current and constant prices. Thus, the position of agriculture in the late 17th century looks even bleaker in current than in constant prices.\n\nIn medieval Europe, old coins were frequently declared invalid and exchanged for new ones at fixed rates and dates. Here, the question of whether and when such re-coinage was applied in medieval Sweden is analyzed against the historical record. A theory of how short-lived coinage systems work is applied to Swedish coinage. It is shown that Sweden adopted similar coin types as those minted in Continental Europe in the Middle Ages, and also adopted the corresponding continental coinage and monetary taxation policies linked to these coin types. Swedish experience is extraordinarily well in line with what one would expect from the theory of short-lived coins. Economic backwardness, limited monetization of society and separate currency areas facilitated re-coinage. Re-coinage with varying frequency was applied in 1180–1290 when only bracteates were minted. This is evidenced by many different coin types per reign, coin hoards which are dominated by a few types and dating of types to specific periods of the kings' reigns. However, monetization increased in the late 13th century, making re-coinage more difficult. and bracteates were replaced by long-lived two-faced coins in 1290. With an end to re-coinage, the Swedish kings then accelerated the debasement of the long-lived coins. The disappearing re-coinage fees were compensated for by debasing the silver content. Such debasements – interrupted by several coinage reforms – were applied until the beginning of the 16th century.\n\nThe High and Late Middle Ages in Sweden were revolutionary periods characterized by an economy that went from local self-sufficiency in the countryside to increased division of labour and emerging cities. The increased specialization in production required a growing number of transactions and trade at local, regional, and international levels and a monetary system that served as a medium of exchange, unit of account and standard for credit. Historical records on transactions and prices can show which commodities and goods traded at different prices, but prices can also signal the relative abundance or scarcity of specific commodities. The analysis in this book is based on an enormous and unique medieval database of such Swedish documents on prices and wages during the 1268–1540 period. In Volume I, the price development of the most important medieval commodities and goods are analysed statistically. The transactions and prices reflect 1) which commodities and goods underwent reorganization and technical development in production; 2) which commodities faced increased competition on a local and international level; and 3) changing trade and consumption patterns in the medieval society. Special focus is on inflation, relative prices, and price volatility. In Volume II, the entire database is presented in tabular form, sorted alphabetically and chronologically by commodities, goods, professions, services, exchange rates and interest rates."
