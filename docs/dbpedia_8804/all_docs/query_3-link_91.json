        "text": "Narrator: At the end of World War One, Germany was defeated. The leader, Kaiser Wilhelm, abdicated, allowing the old royal system of government to be replaced with a new democratic system, the Weimar Republic.\n\nFor the first time, all German people got the vote. They voted for their areaâs representative in the Reichstag Parliament. Elections used what was seen as the fairest system: proportional representation. They also elected a president every seven years, and the president then appointed a chief minister from the Reichstag, the chancellor.\n\nIt seemed like a perfect system.\n\nPresident: Well done, everyone, this system is perfect.\n\nNarrator: And it might have been, if the population hadnât been so divided and angry, because the government had accepted the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles. They called its signatories in the government the November Criminals.\n\nWoman at front of crowd: Death to the November Criminals!\n\nNarrator: At the Paris conference, where the treaty was signed, Germany had expected to have a say in writing the agreement. But the treaty, written solely by the allies, was seen as a diktat, a dictated piece. Article 231 of the treaty stated that Germany was totally to blame for causing the war. This clause was used to justify the allies claiming reparations from Germany. A huge compensation bill of Â£6.6 billion, to be paid to the allies by Germany in crippling annual instalments.\n\nGermany lost all its colonies overseas, and had its armed forces drastically reduced. They were limited to 100,000 soldiers. The peopleâs resentment was made even worse, because many Germans refused to accept that they had lost the war, believing a growing myth that Germanyâs brave army hadnât lost, but had been stabbed in the back by weak politicians.\n\nThe government had to cope with those on the political right, who wanted them removed because they were angry at Versailles, and the loss of the monarchy. On the left, they had to cope with communists, who wanted a socialist revolution. And now, thanks to proportional representation, all of these extremists had a right to vote, and so were represented in the Reichstag. This led to a Parliament full of lots of small parties, representing all of the different, often extreme views, none of whom could form a majority in the Reichstag.\n\nThe Weimar government was beset with problems. But it was a clause in the republicâs new constitution that would cause the biggest problem for Germany, and for the rest of the world. Article 48 allowed the president special powers to make laws without the say of the Reichstag, in the event of an emergency. Hitler would later use Article 48 to turn his democratic election into a ruthless dictatorship."
