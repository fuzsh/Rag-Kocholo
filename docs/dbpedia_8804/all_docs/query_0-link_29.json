        "text": "This article is about the 19th and early-20th century state. For the medieval state briefly known as the Kingdom of Bavaria, see Duchy of Bavaria.\n\nThe Kingdom of Bavaria (German: Königreich Bayern [ˈkøːnɪkˌʁaɪ̯ç ˈbajɛɐ̯n]; Bavarian: Kinereich Bayern [ˈkɪnəˌraɪ̯x ˈb̥ajɛɐ̯n]; spelled Baiern until 1825) was a German state that succeeded the former Electorate of Bavaria in 1806 and continued to exist until 1918. With the unification of Germany into the German Empire in 1871, the kingdom became a federated state of the new empire and was second in size, power, and wealth only to the leading state, the Kingdom of Prussia.[4]\n\nQuick Facts (1806–1825)Königreich BaiernKinereich Baiern(1825–1918)Königreich BayernKinereich Bayern, Status ...\n\nClose\n\nThe polity's foundation dates back to the ascension of Elector Maximilian IV Joseph of the House of Wittelsbach as King of Bavaria in 1806. The crown continued to be held by the Wittelsbachs until the kingdom came to an end in 1918. Most of the border of modern Germany's Free State of Bavaria were established after 1814 with the Treaty of Paris, in which the Kingdom of Bavaria ceded Tyrol and Vorarlberg to the Austrian Empire while receiving Aschaffenburg and Würzburg."
