Linzmayer (www.banknotenews.com) and Don Ludwig.\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany has issued its highest denomination, the 1,000-mark note, in two series. This is the 1991 issue that displays the portrait of Wilhelm, left, and Jacob Grimm, who are known worldwide for their folk stories.\n\nImage courtesy of Deutsche Bundesbank Library Archives."
