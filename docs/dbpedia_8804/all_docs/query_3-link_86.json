        "text": "The National Flag of Germany was officially adopted on May 23, 1949.\n\nThe National Flag of Germany features three equal horizontal bands of black (top), red, and gold. These colors have played an important role in German history and can be traced back to the medieval banner of the Holy Roman Emperor, which had a black eagle with red claws and beak on a gold background. The black, red, and gold were taken from the uniforms of German soldiers during the Napoleonic Wars. Germans associate the colors of the modern flag with freedom and unity since they were adopted by the first attempt in the united German republic. The flag has a width-to-length proportion ratio of 3:5.\n\nHistory of the Flag of Germany\n\nThe horizontal tricolor flag used today dates back to as early as 1778 and was popularized by the German Confederation in 1848. However, when the confederation failed, the flag was no longer used. When the Prussian king united Germany and became emperor in 1871, he adopted a black, white, and red flag for the German Empire. This tricolor, which came to be known as ‘imperial colors’, served until the defeat of the Second Reich during the First World War. In 1919, the black, red, and gold flag (known as the \"republican colors\") was adopted by the newly formed Weimar Republic. The colors black, red, and gold represented the colors of the centrist, republican and democratic political parties in the Weimer Republic, which had formed a coalition to avoid ascension to power by war-mongering or pacifist extremists. However, the switch from the imperial colors to the republican colors was controversial to many in the Weimer Republic at the time. When the Weimar Republic collapsed in 1933, and the Nazi Party was elected, the flag of Germany was reverted to the red, white, and black design of former years. The official flag of the Nazi Party, which featured a black swastika, was also simultaneously used to represent the country at this time.\n\nWhen the Nazi Party gained full control of Germany, they discontinued the use of the red, white and black flag in favor of the flag of the Nazi party, which featured a black swastika. This flag was used to represent Germany until the end of World War II, which saw a ban on all Nazi symbols, including the flag. This ban on Nazi symbolism continues in many countries to this day, including Germany, where it is most strictly enforced.\n\nThroughout the time of a divided Germany, a time spanning the years 1949 to 1989, East Germany and West Germany used different flags. Although there was some hesitancy to accept a national flag before eventual reunification, West Germany adopted the black, red, and gold flag of Germany that we know today. As East Germany was under Soviet rule, the flag did not yet represent them, although they used a similar flag. From the year 1959 onwards, East Germany used a flag that incorporated the black, red, and gold background with the Coat of Arms of East Germany on the flag. Use of this flag was banned in West Germany, as it was seen as a symbol against unification. Ever since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the black, red, and gold flag has officially stood for all of Germany.\n\nSince 2002, the official currency of Germany is the euro (€). The euro symbol was designed by a Belgian named Alain Billiet. The € draws inspiration from the Greek epsilon (Є) which is a referral of the infancy of European civilization. The first letter stands for Europe and the two parallel lines signify the euro’s stability.\n\nThe euro comes second immediately after the United States dollar as the most used currency worldwide.\n\nCoins\n\nThe euro is subdivided into 100 cents. The coins circulating have a primary side bearing the map and values or denomination. The Latin version of the euro is used due to a larger number of languages used by different members together Arabic numerals. However, from 2007 or 2008 depending on the member state, the current currency has a map depicting nations outside Eurozone. Luc Luycx became the primary designer of all standard sides.\n\nThe denominations 2c, 1c, 10c, 20c, 50c, 1€, and 2€ coins are circulated. The black eagle features on the German one Euro and two Euro coins.\n\nBanknotes\n\nThe notes have conventional designs on the two sides developed by Robert Kalina from Austria. The notes are circulated in the following denominations: 5€, 10€, 20€, 50€, 100€, €200, and €500. Every note came with its color, each marking a particular time in Europe's artistic period. Gateways or windows are designed on the front face of the notes and bridges on the back."
