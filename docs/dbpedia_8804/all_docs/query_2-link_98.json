It equaled 0.05 mark or 5 pfennige.\n\nThe coin was very similar in appearance to its gold mark predecessor. During its first year of circulation, it was composed of cupronickel. Later, however, the coin was made of zinc-clad iron. It weighed 2.5 grams and had a diameter of 17.5 millimeters. The smooth edge was 1 millimeter thick. The coin's obverse featured little design, only designating that the coin is from the Deutsches Reich, its value, and year of minting. The reverse, however, featured a more complicated design, the Reichsadler.[1][2]\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]"
