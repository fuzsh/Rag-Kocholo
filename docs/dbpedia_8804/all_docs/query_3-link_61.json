        "text": "This article is about the currency of Ober Ost during World War I. For more uses of \"ostmark\", see here, and for more uses of \"mark\", see here.\n\nThe Ostmark (help • info) was a currency issued by the German Empire in 1918, and was used in eastern areas controlled by Germany during the time, which were known as Ober Ost. The currency consisted of only banknotes, which were issued in 1918 by the Darlehnskasse in Kowno. It circulated alongside the Russian ruble and Ostruble and was pegged to the latter, with two ostmark equaling one ostruble.\n\nHistory[]\n\nDuring 1918, banknotes denominated at ½, 1, 2, 5, 20, 50, 100, and 1000 mark were issued. On the reverse of these notes was a warning against counterfeiting the notes in German, Latvian, and Lithuanian.\n\nAfter the end of World War I, Lithuania used the ostmark up until October 1, 1922, when it was replaced by the litas. The names skatikas and auksinas were subsequently used for pfennig and mark on postage stamps. The reason for the currency's replacement was because of the ostmark's link to the Papiermark, which had already suffered from inflation (and would later spiral into hyperinflation in 1923).\n\nReferences[]\n\nGerman ostmark on the English Wikipedia\n\nTemplate:Ostmark"
