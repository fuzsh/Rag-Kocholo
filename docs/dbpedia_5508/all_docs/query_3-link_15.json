        "text": "The first Baptist churches were formed by English-speakers in Holland (1609-1612). They believed, as did Martin Luther, that believers were capable of reading and interpreting the Bible on their own. The Baptists separated from the Church of England because they believed church membership should be voluntary and that only believers should be baptized. They rejected the parish structure of the Church of England where people were \"born\" into the church and baptized as infants. John Smyth led the first congregation; Thomas Helwys traveled back to England the founded the first Baptist church there in 1612. The first Baptist church in North America was established by Roger Williams in what today is Providence, Rhode Island; soon thereafter, John Clarke founded a Baptist church in Newport, R.I.\n\n(Source: http://www.abc-usa.org/what_we_believe/our-history/)\n\nArrival of Baptists in the Ozarks\n\nBaptists came to Southeast Missouri in the early 1800's, establishing the Bethel Baptist Church (Cape Girardeau County) in 1806. Organized in 1838, the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church is the oldest Baptist congregation in Greene County. According to an 1883 History of Green County, Missouri, \"For many years it was the only church in the neighborhood, and was attended by people from many miles around.\" Founded in 1852, Springfield's First Baptist Church gathered in homes and in Temperance Hall before completing a church building in 1882.\n\nRhode Island State Charter of 1663\n\nRoger Williams and John Clarke together secured a charter from King Charles II in 1663 guaranteeing religious freedom in Rhode Island. The state government of Rhode Island became the first government in history to guarantee separation of church and state, and religious freedom.\n\n(Source: http://www.abc-usa.org/what_we_believe/our-history/) Credit: Photo by Kenneth C.
