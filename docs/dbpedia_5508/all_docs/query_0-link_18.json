        "text": "Christianity Beliefs\n\nSome basic Christian concepts include:\n\nChristians are monotheistic, i.e., they believe there’s only one God, and he created the heavens and the earth. This divine Godhead consists of three parts: the father (God himself), the son (Jesus Christ) and the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe essence of Christianity revolves around the life, death and Christian beliefs on the resurrection of Jesus. Christians believe God sent his son Jesus, the messiah, to save the world. They believe Jesus was crucified on a cross to offer the forgiveness of sins and was resurrected three days after his death before ascending to heaven.\n\nChristians contend that Jesus will return to earth again in what’s known as the Second Coming.\n\nThe Holy Bible includes important scriptures that outline Jesus’s teachings, the lives and teachings of major prophets and disciples, and offer instructions for how Christians should live.\n\nBoth Christians and Jews follow the Old Testament of the Bible, but Christians also embrace the New Testament.\n\nThe cross is a symbol of Christianity.\n\nThe most important Christian holidays are Christmas (which celebrates the birth of Jesus) and Easter (which commemorates the resurrection of Jesus).\n\nWho Was Jesus?\n\nMost historians believe that Jesus was a real person who was born between 2 B.C. and 7 B.C. Much of what scholars know about Jesus comes from the New Testament of the Christian Bible.\n\nAccording to the text, Jesus was born to a young Jewish virgin named Mary in the town of Bethlehem in the West Bank, south of Jerusalem. Christians believe the conception was a supernatural event, with God impregnating Mary via the Holy Spirit.\n\nVery little is known about Jesus’s childhood. Scriptures reveal that he grew up in Nazareth, he and his family fled persecution from King Herod and moved to Egypt, and his “earthly” father, Joseph, was a carpenter.\n\nJesus was raised Jewish, and according to most scholars, he aimed to reform Judaism—not create a new religion.\n\nWhen he was around 30 years old, Jesus started his public ministry after being baptized in the Jordan River by the prophet known as John the Baptist.\n\nFor about three years, Jesus traveled with 12 appointed disciples (also known as the 12 apostles), teaching large groups of people and performing what witnesses described as miracles. Some of the most well-known miraculous events included raising a dead man named Lazarus from the grave, walking on water and curing the blind.\n\nJesus's Teachings\n\nJesus used parables—short stories with hidden messages—in his teachings.\n\nSome of the main themes that Jesus taught, which Christians later embraced, include:\n\nLove God.\n\nLove your neighbor as yourself.\n\nForgive others who have wronged you.\n\nLove your enemies.\n\nAsk God for forgiveness of your sins.\n\nJesus is the Messiah and was given the authority to forgive others.\n\nRepentance of sins is essential.\n\nDon’t be hypocritical.\n\nDon’t judge others.\n\nThe Kingdom of God is near. It’s not the rich and powerful—but the weak and poor—who will inherit this kingdom.\n\nIn one of Jesus’s most famous speeches, which became known as the Sermon on the Mount, he summarized many of his moral instructions for his followers.\n\nJesus's Death and Resurrection\n\nMany scholars believe Jesus died between A.D. 30 and 33, although the exact date is debated among theologians.\n\nAccording to the Bible, Jesus was arrested, tried and condemned to death. Roman governor Pontius Pilate issued the order to kill Jesus after being pressured by Jewish leaders who alleged that Jesus was guilty of a variety of crimes, including blasphemy.\n\nJesus was crucified by Roman soldiers in Jerusalem, and his body was laid in a tomb. According to scripture, three days after his crucifixion, Jesus’s body was missing.\n\nIn the days after Jesus’s death, some people reported sightings and encounters with him. Authors in the Bible say the resurrected Jesus ascended into Heaven.\n\nThe Christian Bible\n\nThe Christian Bible is a collection of 66 books written by various authors. It’s divided into two parts: The Old Testament and the New Testament.\n\nThe Old Testament, which is also recognized by followers of Judaism, describes the history of the Jewish people, outlines specific laws to follow, details the lives of many prophets, and predicts the coming of the Messiah.\n\nThe New Testament was written after Jesus’s death. The first four books—Matthew, Mark, Luke and John—are known as the “Gospels,” which means “good news.” These texts, composed sometime between A.D. 70 and 100, provide accounts of the life and death of Jesus.\n\nLetters written by early Christian leaders, which are known as “epistles,” make up a large part of the New Testament. These letters offer instructions for how the church should operate.\n\nThe Acts of the Apostles is a book in the New Testament that gives an account of the apostles’ ministry after Jesus’s death. The author of Acts is the same author as one of the Gospels—it is effectively “part two” to the Gospels, what happened after Jesus’s death and resurrection.\n\nThe final book in the New Testament, Revelation, describes a vision and prophecies that will occur at the end of the world, as well as metaphors to describe the state of the world.\n\nAccording to the Bible, the first church organized itself 50 days after Jesus’s death on the Day of Pentecost—when the Holy Spirit was said to descend onto Jesus’s followers.\n\nMost of the first Christians were Jewish converts, and the church was centered in Jerusalem. Shortly after the creation of the church, many Gentiles (non-Jews) embraced Christianity.\n\nEarly Christians considered it their calling to spread and teach the gospel. One of the most important missionaries was the apostle Paul, a former persecutor of Christians.\n\nPaul’s conversion to Christianity after he had a supernatural encounter with Jesus is described in Acts of the Apostles. Paul preached the gospel and established churches throughout the Roman Empire, Europe and Africa.\n\nMany historians believe Christianity wouldn’t be as widespread without the work of Paul. In addition to preaching, Paul is thought to have written 13 of the 27 books in the New Testament.\n\nPersecution of Christians\n\nEarly Christians were persecuted for their faith by both Jewish and Roman leaders.\n\nIn A.D. 64, Emperor Nero blamed Christians for a fire that broke out in Rome. Many were brutally tortured and killed during this time.\n\nUnder Emperor Domitian, Christianity was illegal. If a person confessed to being a Christian, he or she was executed.\n\nStarting in A.D. 303, Christians faced the most severe persecutions to date under the co-emperors Diocletian and Galerius. This became known as the Great Persecution.\n\nConstantine Embraces Christianity\n\nWhen Roman Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity, religious tolerance shifted in the Roman Empire.\n\nDuring this time, there were several groups of Christians with different ideas about how to interpret scripture and the role of the church.\n\nIn A.D. 313, Constantine lifted the ban on Christianity with the Edict of Milan. He later tried to unify Christianity and resolve issues that divided the church by establishing the Nicene Creed.\n\nMany scholars believe Constantine’s conversion was a turning point in Christian history.\n\nThe Catholic Church\n\nIn A.D. 380, Emperor Theodosius I declared Catholicism the state religion of the Roman Empire. The Pope, or Bishop of Rome, operated as the head of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nCatholics expressed a deep devotion for the Virgin Mary, recognized the seven sacraments, and honored relics and sacred sites.\n\nWhen the Roman Empire collapsed in A.D. 476, differences emerged among Eastern and Western Christians.\n\nIn A.D. 1054, the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox church split into two groups.\n\nThe Crusades\n\nBetween about A.D. 1095 and A.D. 1230, the Crusades, a series of holy wars, took place. In these battles, Christians fought against Islamic rulers and their Muslim soldiers to reclaim holy land in the city of Jerusalem.\n\nThe Christians were successful in occupying Jerusalem during some of the Crusades, but they were ultimately defeated.\n\nAfter the Crusades, the Catholic Church’s power and wealth increased.\n\nThe Reformation\n\nIn 1517, a German monk named Martin Luther published 95 Theses—a text that criticized certain acts of the Pope and protested some of the practices and priorities of the Roman Catholic church.\n\nLater, Luther publicly said that the Bible didn’t give the Pope the sole right to read and interpret scripture.\n\nLuther’s ideas triggered the Reformation—a movement that aimed to reform the Catholic church. As a result, Protestantism was created, and different denominations of Christianity eventually began to form.\n\nTypes of Christianity\n\nChristianity is broadly split into three branches: Catholic, Protestant and (Eastern) Orthodox.\n\nThe Catholic branch is governed by the Pope and Catholic bishops around the world. The Orthodox (or Eastern Orthodox) is split into independent units each governed by a Holy Synod; there is no central governing structure akin to the Pope.\n\nThere are numerous denominations within Protestant Christianity, many of which differ in their interpretation of the Bible and understanding of the church.\n\nSome of the many denominations that fall under the category of Protestant Christianity include:\n\nBaptist\n\nEpiscopalian\n\nEvangelist\n\nMethodist\n\nPresbyterian\n\nPentecostal/Charismatic\n\nLutheran\n\nAnglican\n\nEvangelical\n\nAssemblies of God\n\nChristian Reform/Dutch Reform\n\nChurch of the Nazarene\n\nDisciples of Christ\n\nUnited Church of Christ\n\nMennonite\n\nChristian Science\n\nQuaker\n\nSeventh-Day Adventist\n\nAlthough the many sects of Christianity have differing views, uphold separate traditions and worship in distinct ways, the core of their faith is centered around the life and teachings of Jesus.\n\nSources"
