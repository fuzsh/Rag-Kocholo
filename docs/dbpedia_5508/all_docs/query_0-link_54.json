        "text": "The Psychology Of The Debate\n\nIf the objective, historical evidence is as clear as I claim about the historic definition of the word Reformed, why does this debate even exist? Again, the roots of this debate are partly to be found in the way Baptists think of themselves and others, particularly in the USA. In my experience, writing as a former Baptistic evangelical, the Baptist is absolutely sure that his position is correct and that therefore virtually everyone in the history of the church, prior to say 1523 and the rise of the Swiss Brothers, was wrong. This effectively unbaptizes, as it were, virtually the entire Christian tradition prior to 1523 and all those who dissent from Baptist convictions. In my experience as a pastor, a writer, and a seminary professor, this troubles most Baptist laity not at all. After all, from the Baptist perspective, the Baptist position is self-evident to any reasonable person. He is astonished that anyone would object to being unbaptized, as it were. For the Baptist, there is a simple answer: believe, make a credible profession of faith, and be baptized.\n\nTo those of us in the Reformed churches (as distinct from the Baptist), the Baptist conviction logically entails that we who were only baptized as infants are outside of the visible church, and therefore outside of salvation. In Belgic Confession (BC) article 28, we confess: “We believe that since this holy assembly and congregation is the gathering of those who are saved and there is no salvation apart from it, no one ought to withdraw from it, content to be by himself, regardless of his status or condition.”1 Though they may not intend it, from the Reformed perspective or from a Cyprianic perspective (that of the entire church prior to the Baptist movement), a willfully unbaptized person is in a precarious position to say the least.\n\nBecause, to the Baptist, his position is so self-evidently true, those of us who have been unbaptized, as it were, are expected to say nothing. When, however, I make the plainly and painfully obvious historical point that the reformed churches explicitly denounced the Anabaptist view of baptism (and logically, the Baptist view of baptism), the Baptist is likely to be in high dudgeon.\n\nAs several correspondents have pointed out to me over the years, I am not saying that Baptists are unbaptized. Indeed, in the Reformed churches, we have always baptized unbaptized adult converts. Further, BC 29 is quite clear that the Anabaptist congregations, which the confession characterizes as “sects,” lacked two of the three marks of the true church (i.e., the pure preaching of the gospel, the pure administration of the sacraments, and the use of church discipline). I think that the Baptist churches lack one of the marks of the true church. It is rather clear that the Reformed churches have never accepted believer-only baptism and the Baptist rejection of infant baptism as the “pure administration of the sacraments.” Nevertheless, I do not consider Particular Baptist congregations sects or false churches (the other category we confess in BC 29). Instead, I characterize them as “irregular congregations.”2 Arguably, I am being more gracious to the Baptists than they are to me.\n\nJust today, as I write, I received an email from a correspondent who was outraged about the logical (not moral) comparison between the Baptist self-identification as Reformed and Bruce Jenner’s self-identification as a woman. Why the outrage? That is an interesting question.\n\nMy theory is that most Baptists have spent little time reading Reformed (properly defined) history, confessions, and theologians. Because of a certain ignorance, they assume a degree of agreement between Reformed and Baptist theology that does not exist. This assumption creates the precondition for outrage. Further, many Baptists have never experienced actual Reformed church life. They have not experienced the differences. The differences of which they are aware are theoretical at best.\n\nIt is quite possible to be a Baptist in the USA and never meet an actual Reformed person. There are something like 60 million Baptistic Christians in the USA. There are approximately 500,000 Reformed folk. The confessional P&R world is approximately 0.0083% of the Baptistic world. There is a relatively large Baptistic bubble in the USA and actual P&R people are relatively rare—and in some places, almost exotic. In that Baptistic bubble, there is a significant number of people who consider themselves Reformed. Because of that number (potentially twice as many people as in the actual Reformed churches), it seems improbable and even incredible to them when they read someone from a tiny minority group distinguishing between Reformed and Baptist.\n\nToo many times to count, it has been said or implied to me that the large number of Baptists who identify as Reformed means that whatever the word Reformed might have meant once upon a time, it means now what they say it means. Logically, this is nothing but an appeal to the mob or to numbers or to force; but it is a powerful, psychological, and emotional appeal. It helps to explain the outrage. Who is Clark, one guy in the midst of one million predestinarian Baptistic Christians, to object?\n\nTo further complicate things, there are lots of actual Reformed people who are more than happy to call Baptists Reformed if the Baptists would acknowledge them as evangelicals. This deal was negotiated in the post-WWII world. Why did the Reformed negotiate this settlement, implicitly conceding a significant re-definition of the adjective Reformed? The answer lies in part in what happened to the Reformed in the wake of the battle for the Bible with the liberals. The confessional P&R world helped to lead the charge against the theological liberals and the higher critics in the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, but simultaneously they were losing their institutions and denominations. They were being exiled into micro-denominations and into poverty and obscurity. By the mid-twentieth century, the confessional P&R churches were in bad shape institutionally and financially. Our outsized intellectual influence did not reflect our institutional and financial condition.\n\nThe deal took on new dimensions, however, with the rise of the Young, Restless, and Reformed movement. If we look at the use of the phrase, “Reformed Baptist,” in Google Ngram, we see that it spikes in 1999–2000. There is an earlier spike, but those occurrences do not signal “Reformed Baptist.” Though the modern roots of the concession of the Reformed identity to Baptists by some leaders in the P&R world goes back eighty years, the actual public formation of a Reformed Baptist identity is a very new phenomenon indeed.3 The Association of Reformed Baptist Churches in America organized in 1996. They reconstituted as the Confessional Baptist Association in 2022.\n\nThe recent formation of a Reformed Baptist identity and its adoption by elements of the Young, Restless, and Reformed (YRR) movement in the late 1990s and early 2000s has intensified this debate.4 The YRR movement and the appropriation of Reformed by Baptistic Christians was like a tsunami that threatened to obliterate the actual Reformed identity. It presents a challenge that the earlier and informal Baptist adopters of a Reformed identity did not pose.\n\nThe rise of the Reformed Baptist identity among confessional Baptists, and more broadly in the YRR movement, in the early twenty-first century also seemed to offer a new platform (e.g., TGC) to actual Reformed Christians that they did not have before the YRR movement. This created a disincentive for confessional P&R folk to speak up about the differences. To call attention publicly to the differences between the Reformed and the Baptist (more than a few P&R folk have spoken about them to me privately) runs the risk of alienating the much larger and influential YRR platforms and opportunities.\n\nCertainly, there are notable leaders in the P&R world who have characterized the Particular Baptist churches as part of the Reformed movement. Others have embraced even more broadly predestinarian (but not confessionally Particular Baptist) Baptists as Reformed. Some of these figures are celebrities within the P&R and broader evangelical worlds. But do those endorsements and characterizations change the facts and the truth? In BC 7, the Reformed churches confess:\n\nTherefore we must not consider human writings—no matter how holy their authors may have been—equal to the divine writings; nor may we put custom, nor the majority, nor age, nor the passage of time or persons, nor councils, decrees, or official decisions above the truth of God, for truth is above everything else. For all human beings are liars by nature and more vain than vanity itself.\n\nWhat matters here is not personalities, authorities, or even subjective identity, but objective truth. Perhaps I am wrong—if I am, my life will be much simpler. But if I am to be persuaded that I am wrong it must be by facts and evidence and reason, and not by anything else.\n\nNotes\n\nThis is an allusion to Cyprian’s saying, “Quia salus extra ecclesiam non est” (Because, outside the church there is no salvation) in W. Hartel, ed., Cyprianus, Opera omnia, Corpus Scriptorium Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum (CSEL), vol. 3, bk. 2 (CSEL, 1871), Ep. 73.21. Thanks to Harrison Perkins for helping me to get this question.\n\nMy teacher, dear friend, and colleague Bob Godfrey has argued in “The Belgic Confession and the True Church,” in Ronald S. Baines, Richard C. Barcellos, James P. Butler, ed. By Common Confession (Palmdale, CA: Reformed Baptist Academic Press, 2015) that “at least some of Baptist churches are true churches” (p. 275). He contends that the Belgic uses “sects” and “false church” synonymously. This reading, in my view, defies the history of the usage of “sect” by the magisterial Protestants in the sixteenth century. In Luther and Calvin’s work, sect is a synonym for various radicals, including the Anabaptists. It is not used as a synonym for the Roman communion. He also argues that Baptist churches are not descended from the Anabaptists and thus are immune from the condemnations leveled against the Anabaptists. I disagree. We should distinguish between theological influences and institutional history. The Baptist movement originated in the Netherlands where a group of English congregationalist refugees came into contact with Dutch Anabaptists. It is not a coincidence that the Baptists use the same language and arguments to defend their views of the history of redemption and baptism as the Anabaptists. Considered institutionally, the people who made up the Baptist movement came from a variety of places (e.g., the Church of England) and were not derived from the Anabaptists.\n\nThe Institute for Reformed Baptist Studies was just beginning when I began teaching in seminary in 1997.\n\nFor more on this, see RSC, “Resources On The Young, Restless, And Reformed and New Calvinism Movements.”\n\n©R.
