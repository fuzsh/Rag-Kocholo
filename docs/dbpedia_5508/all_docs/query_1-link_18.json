        "text": "How Did the First Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) Begin?\n\nThe Great Awakenings were sweeping movements in American history that led to widespread repentance and conversion. They also gave rise to multiple new denominations and Christian movements. During the Second Great Awakening, in the early 19th century, two movements began independently of one another. In Cane Ridge, Kentucky, a group formed by Barton Stone called themselves simply “Christians.” At the same time, a father and son named Thomas and Alexander Campbell formed a similar group in present-day Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The goal of both groups was to do away with denominational differences and labels, and instead return to the simplicity and unity of the original New Testament church. Eventually, both of these movements would work together to form the “Christian” church.\n\nInitially, it appeared that this new movement had a lot in common with nearby Baptist congregations, and many Baptists welcomed them as partners in evangelism and reform. However, it became more and more clear that the Christian church held its own set of beliefs, and these beliefs were not compatible with Baptist confessions of faith. Soon, Baptists and the Christian Church began to distance themselves from one another.\n\nWhat Are the Key Doctrinal Differences?\n\nAs the early Christian Church was forming, it chose this motto: “In essentials, Unity; In non-essentials, Liberty; and in all things, Charity.” Today, Disciples of Christ continue to emphasize that the only “essentials” of the faith are accepting Jesus as savior and being baptized. They emphasize that creeds and doctrinal statements are controversial and divisive, and they believe that each believer should be free to accept or reject key doctrines. The Disciples of Christ reject anything that resembles a “test of faith” and insist that anyone who accepts Jesus and is baptized should be welcomed into the congregation. For example, the church refuses to state a formal position on whether heaven and hell literally exist, and they claim that all interpretations of the Bible’s teachings about afterlife are equally valid.\n\nOn the other hand, Baptists maintain that other important doctrines, including the Trinity and Jesus’ virgin birth, are essential elements of the faith. Most Baptist churches hold a doctrinal statement as a congregation, which represents their position on key doctrines such as creation, atonement, resurrection, inspiration, and incarnation. On our website, you can check out “Our Beliefs” to see the doctrinal statement we claim at Harmony Baptist Church.\n\nWhat Does the Bible Say?\n\nNew Testament writers are very clear that a person’s claim to faith must meet certain standards. 1 John 4: 1 warns us not to accept the teachings of false prophets and urges us to test, or examine new teachings in the light of God’s Word. 2 Corinthians 11:13-15 warns that, just as Satan disguises himself as an angel of light, so false teachers may come into a congregation and preach falsehoods disguised as truth. In Matthew 7:15-20, Jesus Himself explains that false prophets may look as innocent as sheep, but they’re as dangerous as wolves, and we must learn to avoid them. Jesus commands us to test religious teachers by examining their fruit, and to reject those who bear bad fruit. These are just a few of the many passages in Scripture that reinforce an unmistakable message: false doctrines are dangerous, and not everyone who claims to be a Christian really is one.\n\nWhat Are the Practical Results of Rejecting Doctrinal Standards?\n\nToday, the Disciples of Christ accept those with a wide variety of doctrinal positions. This results in faith practices that plainly violate scripture, including the ordination of women and openly homosexual individuals and the support of abortion legalization. The denomination focuses heavily on social activism and community involvement, seeking to avoid any doctrinal controversies that might offend or divide professing believers.\n\nHow Are Baptist Churches Different?\n\nBaptists maintain that the Bible is the inspired Word of God and that, when it makes a clear and plain statement, that statement should be taken at face value. Baptists also recognize that division is a fundamental part of the Christian life; Jesus said that He came to set family members and friends against one another, and that He came to bring a sword and not peace. Baptists do not seek divisiveness and conflict for its own sake, but they recognize that unwavering belief in the Bible’s plain and clear teachings will often invite ridicule, rejection and controversy.\n\nBaptist churches agree that the church has important work to do in society and the community. From meeting the financial and physical needs of those nearby and around the world to sharing the gospel with all who will listen, Baptists are committed to spreading hope and love beyond the four walls of the church. However, Baptists recognize that this world and its systems are temporal, and that social activism isn’t the church’s primary function.\n\nHow Do I Decide Which Church To Attend?"
