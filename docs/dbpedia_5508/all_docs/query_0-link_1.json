        "text": "A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organization and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church, convention, communion, assembly, house, union, network, or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one denomination and another are primarily defined by authority and doctrine. Issues regarding the nature of Jesus, Trinitarianism, salvation, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, conciliarity, papal supremacy and papal primacy among others may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations, often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties—can be known as \"branches of Christianity\" or \"denominational families\" (e.g. Eastern or Western Christianity and their sub-branches).[1] These \"denominational families\" are often imprecisely also called denominations.\n\nChristian denominations since the 20th century have often involved themselves in ecumenism. Ecumenism refers to efforts among Christian bodies to develop better understandings and closer relationships.[2][3] It also refers to efforts toward visible unity in the Christian Church, though the terms of visible unity vary for each denomination of Christianity, as certain groups teach they are the one true church, or that they were divinely instituted for the propagation of a certain doctrine.[4][5] The largest ecumenical organization in Christianity is the World Council of Churches.[6][3]\n\nThe following is not a complete list, but aims to provide a comprehensible overview of the diversity among denominations of Christianity, ecumenical organizations, and Christian ideologies not necessarily represented by specific denominations. Only those Christian denominations, ideologies and organizations with Wikipedia articles will be listed in order to ensure that all entries on this list are notable and verifiable. The denominations and ecumenical organizations listed are generally ordered from ancient to contemporary Christianity.\n\nTerminology and qualification\n\n[edit]\n\nChristianity can be taxonomically divided into six main groups: the Church of the East, Oriental Orthodoxy, Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, and Restorationism.[8][9] Within these six main traditions are various Christian denominations (for example, the Coptic Orthodox Church is an Oriental Orthodox denomination). Protestantism includes many groups which do not share any ecclesiastical governance and have widely diverging beliefs and practices.[10] Major Protestant branches include Adventism, Anabaptism, Anglicanism, Baptists, Lutheranism, Methodism, Moravianism, Quakerism, Pentecostalism, Plymouth Brethren, Reformed Christianity, and Waldensianism.[10] Reformed Christianity itself includes the Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, Evangelical Anglican, Congregationalist, and Reformed Baptist traditions.[11] Anabaptist Christianity itself includes the Amish, Apostolic, Bruderhof, Hutterite, Mennonite, River Brethren, and Schwarzenau Brethren traditions.[12]\n\nWithin the Restorationist branch of Christianity, denominations include the Irvingians, Swedenborgians, Christadelphians, Latter Day Saints, Jehovah's Witnesses, La Luz del Mundo, and Iglesia ni Cristo.[13][14][15][16] Among those listed, some bodies included do not consider themselves denominations, though for the purpose of academic study of religion, they are categorized as a denomination, that is, \"an organized body of Christians.\"[17] For example, the Catholic Church considers itself the one true church and the Holy See as pre-denominational.[18] The Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Oriental Orthodox Church, also considers themselves to be the original Christian church along with the Catholic church.[19][20] The Lutheran Churches have viewed themselves as the \"main trunk of the historical Christian Tree\" founded by Christ and the Apostles, holding that during the Reformation, the Church of Rome fell away.[21] Certain denominational traditions teach that they were divinely instituted to propagate a certain doctrine or spiritual experience, for example the raising up of Methodism by God to propagate entire sanctification (the \"second blessing\"),[5] or the launch of Pentecostalism to bestow a baptism with the Holy Spirit evidenced by speaking in tongues on humanity.[22] To express further the complexity involved, the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches were historically one and the same, as evidenced by the fact that they are the only two modern churches in existence to accept all of the first seven ecumenical councils, until differences arose, such as papal authority and dominance, the rise of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the continuance of emperors in the Eastern Roman Empire, and the final and permanent split that occurred during the Crusades with the siege of Constantinople.[23] This also illustrates that denominations can arise not only from religious or theological issues, but political and generational divisions as well.\n\nOther churches that are viewed by non-adherents as denominational are highly decentralized and do not have any formal denominational structure, authority, or record-keeping beyond the local congregation; several groups within the Restoration Movement and congregational churches fall into this category.\n\nSome Christian bodies are large (e.g. Catholics, Orthodox, Pentecostals and nondenominationals, Anglicans or Baptists), while others are just a few small churches, and in most cases the relative size is not evident in this list except for the denominational group or movement as a whole (e.g. Church of the East, Oriental Orthodox Churches, or Lutheranism). The largest denomination is the Catholic Church with more than 1.3 billion members.[24] The smallest of these groups may have only a few dozen adherents or an unspecified number of participants in independent churches as described below. As such, specific numbers and a certain size may not define a group as a denomination. However, as a general rule, the larger a group becomes, the more acceptance and legitimacy it gains.\n\nModern movements such as Christian fundamentalism, Radical Pietism, Evangelicalism, the Holiness movement and Charismatic Christianity sometimes cross denominational lines, or in some cases create new denominations out of two or more continuing groups (as is the case for many united and uniting churches, for example; e.g. the United Church of Christ).[25][26] Such subtleties and complexities are not clearly depicted here.\n\nBetween denominations, theologians, and comparative religionists there are considerable disagreements about which groups can be properly called Christian or a Christian denomination as disagreements arise primarily from doctrinal differences between each other. As an example, this list contains groups also known as \"rites\" which many, such as the Roman Catholic Church, would say are not denominations as they are in full papal communion, and thus part of the Catholic Church.[27] For the purpose of simplicity, this list is intended to reflect the self-understanding of each denomination. Explanations of different opinions concerning their status as Christian denominations can be found at their respective articles.\n\nThere is no official recognition in most parts of the world for religious bodies, and there is no official clearinghouse which could determine the status or respectability of religious bodies. Often there is considerable disagreement between various groups about whether others should be labeled with pejorative terms such as \"cult\", or about whether this or that group enjoys some measure of respectability. Such considerations often vary from place to place, or culture to culture, where one denomination may enjoy majority status in one region, but be widely regarded as a \"dangerous cult\" in another part of the world. Inclusion on this list does not indicate any judgment about the size, importance, or character of a group or its members.\n\nEarly Christian\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly Christianity is often divided into three different branches that differ in theology and traditions, which all appeared in the 1st century AD/CE. They include Jewish Christianity, Pauline Christianity and Gnostic Christianity.[28] All modern Christian denominations are said to have descended from the Jewish and Pauline Christianities, with Gnostic Christianity dying, or being hunted out of existence after the early Christian era and being largely forgotten until discoveries made in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries.[29] There are also other theories on the origin of Christianity.[30]\n\nThe following Christian groups appeared between the beginning of the Christian religion and the First Council of Nicaea in 325.\n\nGnosticism\n\n[edit]\n\nLate ancient and Medieval Christian\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following are groups of Christians appearing between the First Council of Nicaea, the East-West Schism and proto-Protestantism. Among these late ancient and Medieval Christian denominations, the most prominent and continuously operating have been the Church of the East and its successors in Assyrian Christianity; and the Oriental Orthodox Churches. Both the Church of the East and Oriental Orthodox separated from the imperial Roman church during the 5th century.[31]\n\nChurch of the East\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Church of the East split from the Roman-recognized state church of Rome during the Sasanian Period. It is also called the Nestorian Church or the Church of Persia.[32] Declaring itself separate from the state church in 424–427, liturgically, it adhered to the East Syriac Rite.[31] Theologically, it adopted the dyophysite doctrine of Nestorianism, which emphasizes the separateness of the divine and human natures of Jesus, and addresses Mary as Christotokos instead of Theotokos; the Church of the East also largely practiced aniconism.[33][34] Adhered to by groups such as the Keraites and Naimans (see Christianity among the Mongols), the Church of the East had a prominent presence in Inner Asia between the 11th and 14th centuries, but by the 15th century was largely confined to the Eastern Aramaic-speaking Assyrian communities of northern Mesopotamia, in and around the rough triangle formed by Mosul and Lakes Van and Urmia—the same general region where the Church of the East had first emerged between the 1st and 3rd centuries.[35]\n\nIts patriarchal lines divided in a tumultuous period from the 16th-19th century, finally consolidated into the Eastern Catholic Chaldean Church (in full communion with the Pope of Rome), and the Assyrian Church of the East.[36][37] Other minor, modern related splinter groups include the Ancient Church of the East (split 1968 due to rejecting some changes made by Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai) and the Chaldean Syrian Church. In 1995 the Chaldean Syrian Church reunified with the Assyrian Church of the East as an archbishopric. The Chaldean Syrian Church is headquartered in Thrissur, India. Together, the Assyrian, Ancient, Chaldean Syrian and Chaldean Catholic Church comprised over 1.6 million in 2018.[38][39][40][41]\n\nAssyrian (Syriac) Christian\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Syriac Christianity\n\nAssyrian Christianity comprises those Eastern churches who kept the traditional Nestorian christology and ecclesiology of the historical Church of the East after the original church reunited with the Catholic Church in Rome, forming the Chaldean Catholic Church in 1552. Assyrian Christianity forms part of the Syriac Christian tradition. The Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East together had over 0.6 million members as of 2018 .[42][39]\n\nAssyrian Church of the East\n\nChaldean Syrian Church\n\nAncient Church of the East\n\nOriental Orthodox\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Oriental Orthodox Churches\n\nThe Oriental Orthodox Churches are the Christian churches adhering to Miaphysite christology and theology, with a combined global membership of 62 million as of 2019 .[43][44][45] These churches reject the Council of Chalcedon in 451 and those after it. They departed from the state church of the Roman Empire after the Chalcedonian Council.[46][45] Other denominations, such as the Eastern Orthodox Church and bodies in Old and True Orthodoxy, often label the Oriental Orthodox Churches as \"Monophysite\". As the Oriental Orthodox do not adhere to the teachings of Eutyches, they themselves reject this label, preferring the term \"Miaphysite\".\n\nHistorically, the Oriental Orthodox Churches considered themselves collectively to be the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church that Jesus founded. Some Christian denominations have recently considered the body of Oriental Orthodoxy to be a part of the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church—a view which is gaining increasing acceptance in the wake of ecumenical dialogues between groups such as Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman and Eastern Catholicism, and Protestant Christianity.[47][48]\n\nAll canonical or mainstream Oriental Orthodox Churches are part of the World Council of Churches,[45] though only five form the Standing Conference of Oriental Orthodox Churches.[49] Throughout Oriental Orthodoxy, non-mainstream or non-canonical churches have passed in and out of recognition with the mainstream churches (e.g., British Orthodox Church).[50]\n\nCanonical Oriental Orthodox\n\n[edit]\n\nIndependent Oriental Orthodox\n\n[edit]\n\nEastern Orthodox\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Eastern Orthodoxy\n\nEastern Orthodoxy is one of the main Chalcedonian Christian branches, alongside Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.[51][52] Each Eastern Orthodox church considers itself part of the one true church, and pre-denominational. Though they consider themselves pre-denominational, being the original Church of Christ before 1054,[53][19] some scholars suggest the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches began after the East–West Schism.[54][55]\n\nCanonical Eastern Orthodox\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church, officially the Orthodox Catholic Church, claims continuity (based upon apostolic succession) with the early Church as part of the state church of Rome. The Eastern Orthodox Church had about 230 million members as of 2019 , making it the second largest single denomination behind the Catholic Church.[56][57][58] Some of them have a disputed administrative status (i.e. their autonomy or autocephaly is not recognized universally). Eastern Orthodox churches by and large remain in communion with one another, although this has broken at times throughout its history. Two examples of impaired communion between the Orthodox churches include the Moscow–Constantinople schisms of 1996 and 2018.[59][60][61][62] There are also independent churches subscribing to the Eastern Orthodox traditions.\n\nIndependent Eastern Orthodox\n\n[edit]\n\nThese Eastern Orthodox churches are not in communion with the mainstream or canonical Eastern Orthodox Church. Some of these denominations consider themselves as part of True Orthodoxy or the Old Believers. True Orthodoxy, or Genuine Orthodoxy, separated from the mainstream church over issues of ecumenism and calendar reform since the 1920s;[63] and the Russian Old Believers refused to accept the liturgical and ritual changes made by Patriarch Nikon of Moscow between 1652 and 1666. Several Old Believer denominations have reunified with the Russian Orthodox Church and subsequent wider Eastern Orthodox communion.\n\nTrue Orthodoxy\n\n[edit]\n\nOther Orthodox movements\n\n[edit]\n\nCatholic\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Catholic Church, or Roman Catholic Church, is composed of 24 autonomous sui iuris particular churches: the Latin Church and the 23 Eastern Catholic Churches. It considers itself the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church that Christ founded,[64] and which Saint Peter initiated along with the missionary work of Saint Paul and others. As such, the Catholic Church does not consider itself a denomination, but rather considers itself pre-denominational, the original Church of Christ.[65][66] Continuity is claimed based upon apostolic succession with the early Church.[67] The Catholic population exceeds 1.3 billion as of 2016 ,[24] making up the majority of Western Christianity. Stemming from the one Roman Catholic institution, there exists several Independent Catholic churches which have expanded the Catholic denominational family, becoming Old and Old Roman Catholicism, and Liberal Catholics.\n\nLatin (Roman) Catholic\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Latin Church\n\nThe Latin Church is the largest and most widely known of the 24 sui iuris churches that together make up the Catholic Church.[27] It is headed by the Bishop of Rome—the Pope—with headquarters in Vatican City, enclaved within Rome, Italy. As of 2015 , the Latin Church comprised 1.255 billion members.[68]\n\nEastern (Oriental) Catholic\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Eastern Catholic Churches\n\nAll of the following are particular churches of the Catholic Church. They are all in communion with the Pope as Bishop of Rome and acknowledge his claim of universal jurisdiction and authority. They have some minor distinct theological emphases and expressions (for instance, in the case of those that are of Greek/Byzantine tradition, concerning some non-doctrinal aspects of the Latin view of Purgatory and clerical celibacy).[69] The Eastern Catholic Churches and the Latin Church (which are united in the worldwide Catholic Church) share the same doctrine and sacraments, and thus the same faith. The total membership of the churches accounted for approximately 18 million members as of 2019 .[70]\n\nIndependent Catholic\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Independent Catholicism and Old Catholic Church\n\nIndependent Catholics consists of those denominations embodying catholicity, and have initially separated from the Latin Church in 1724 through the consecrations of bishops for the present-day Old Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht without papal approval.[71][72] Largely distinguished by their rejection of papal infallibility and supremacy, most Independent Catholic churches are unrecognized by the Vatican, although their sacraments have been recognized as valid but illicit.[73]\n\nCatholic movements\n\n[edit]\n\nProtestant\n\n[edit]\n\nProtestantism is a movement within Christianity which owes its name to the 1529 Protestation at Speyer, but originated in 1517 when Martin Luther began his dispute with the Roman Catholic Church. This period of time, known as the Reformation, began a series of events resulting over the next 500 years in several newly denominated churches (listed below). Some denominations were started by intentionally dividing themselves from the Roman Catholic Church, such as in the case of the English Reformation while others, such as with Luther's followers, were excommunicated after attempting reform.[74] New denominations and organizations formed through further divisions within Protestant churches since the Reformation began. A denomination labeled \"Protestant\" subscribes to the fundamental Protestant principles—though not always—that is scripture alone, justification by faith alone, and the universal priesthood of believers.[75]\n\nThe majority of contemporary Protestants are members of Adventism, Anglicanism, the Baptist churches, Calvinism (Reformed Protestantism), Lutheranism, Methodism and Pentecostalism.[76] Nondenominational, Evangelical, charismatic, neo-charismatic, independent, Convergence, and other churches are on the rise, and constitute a significant part of Protestant Christianity.[77]\n\nThis list gives only an overview, and certainly does not mention all of the Protestant denominations. The exact number of Protestant denominations, including the members of the denominations, is difficult to calculate and depends on definition. A group that fits the generally accepted definition of \"Protestant\" might not officially use the term. Therefore, it should be taken with caution. The most accepted figure among various authors and scholars includes around 900 million to a little over 1 billion Protestant Christians.[78][79]\n\nProto-Protestant\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Proto-Protestantism\n\nProto-Protestantism refers to movements similar to the Protestant Reformation, but before 1517, when Martin Luther (1483–1546) is reputed to have nailed the Ninety-Five-Theses to the church door. Major early Reformers were Peter Waldo (c. 1140–c. 1205), John Wycliffe (1320s–1384), and Jan Hus (c. 1369–1415). It is not completely correct to call these groups Protestant due to the fact that some of them had nothing to do with the 1529 protestation at Speyer which coined the term Protestant. In particular, the Utraquists were eventually accommodated as a separate Catholic rite by the papacy after a military attempt to end their movement failed. On the other hand, the surviving Waldensians ended up joining Reformed Protestantism, so it is not completely inaccurate to refer to their movement as Protestant; the Waldensian Evangelical Church is a well known existing body in that tradition. The Hussites are presently represented in the Moravian Church, Unity of the Brethren and the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.\n\nLutheran\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Lutheranism and List of Lutheran denominations\n\nLutherans are a major branch of Protestantism, identifying with the theology of Martin Luther, a German friar, ecclesiastical reformer, and theologian. Lutheranism initially began as an attempt to reform the Catholic Church before the excommunication of its members. Lutherans are divided among High Church, Confessional, Pietist and Liberal churchmanships, though these can overlap, e.g. the Communion of Nordic Lutheran Dioceses is High Church and Confessional. The whole of Lutheranism had about 70-90 million members in 2018.[80][81][82][83] The largest non-United Lutheran denomination was the Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus, an Eastern Protestant Christian group.[84]\n\nRadical Pietist\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Radical Pietism\n\nThose who separated from established Lutheran churches to form their own denominations are known as Radical Pietists (as opposed to Pietistic Lutherans, who remain in the Lutheran churches (such as the Church of the Lutheran Brethren) and combine its emphasis on Biblical doctrine with the importance of individual piety and living a holy Christian life.[85] Although the Radical Pietists broke with Lutheranism, its influence on Anglicanism, in particular John Wesley, led to the spawning of the Methodist movement.\n\nReformed\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Calvinism and List of Reformed denominations\n\nPart of a series onReformed Christianity\n\nChristianity • Protestantism\n\nReformed Christianity portal\n\nCalvinism, also known as the Reformed tradition or Reformed Protestantism is a movement which broke from the Catholic Church in the 16th century. Reformed Christianity is represented in the Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, and Congregationalist traditions, along with Reformed Anglican and Reformed Baptist denominations (the latter two are listed under the Anglican and Baptist sections of this article, respectively). Calvinism follows the theological traditions set down by John Calvin, John Knox and other Reformation-era theologians. Calvinists differ from Lutherans on the nature of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, theories of worship, and the use of God's law for believers, among other things. There are from 60 to 80 million Christians identifying as Reformed or Calvinist according to statistics gathered in 2018.[86][87][88]\n\nContinental Reformed churches\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Continental Reformed church\n\nPresbyterianism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Presbyterianism\n\nCongregationalism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Congregational church\n\nAnglican\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Anglicanism\n\nAnglicanism or Episcopalianism has referred to itself as the via media between Lutheranism and Reformed Christianity,[89] as well as between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.[90][91] The majority of Anglicans consider themselves part of the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church within the Anglican Communion. Anglicans or Episcopalians also self-identify as both Catholic and Reformed. Although the use of the term \"Protestant\" to refer to Anglicans was once common, it is controversial today, with some rejecting the label and others accepting it. Anglicans numbered over 85 million in 2018.[92]\n\nAnglican Communion\n\n[edit]\n\nOther Anglican churches and Continuing Anglican movement\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Continuing Anglican movement\n\nThere are numerous churches following the Anglican tradition that are not in full communion with the Anglican Communion. Some churches split due to changes in the Book of Common Prayer and the ordination of women, forming Anglo-Catholic, Anglican Papal or Evangelical Anglican communities.[93] A select few of these churches are recognized by certain individual provinces of the Anglican Communion.\n\nAnabaptist\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Anabaptists\n\nThe Anabaptists trace their origins to the Radical Reformation. Alternative to other early Protestants, Anabaptists were seen as an early offshoot of Protestantism, although the view has been challenged by some[who?] Anabaptists.[94] There were approximately 2.1 million Anabaptists as of 2015. Anabaptists are categorized into Old Order Anabaptism (such as the Old Brethren German Baptist), Conservative Anabaptism (such as the Pilgrim Mennonite Conference, Beachy Amish and Dunkard Brethren Church), and mainline/assimilated Anabaptism.\n\nBaptist\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Baptists\n\nBaptists emerged in 1609 under the teachings of John Smyth, and along with Methodism, grew in size and influence after they sailed to the New World (the remaining Puritans who traveled to the New World were Congregationalists). Some Baptists fit strongly with the Reformed tradition theologically but not denominationally. Some Baptists also adopt presbyterian and episcopal forms of governance. In 2018, there were about 75-105 million Baptists.[86][95]\n\nBaptist movements\n\n[edit]\n\nMethodist\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Methodism and List of Methodist denominations\n\nThe Methodist movement emerged out the work of Anglican priest John Wesley, who taught a personal conversion to Christ (the New Birth) and holiness of heart.[96] Calling it \"the grand depositum\" of the Methodist faith, Wesley specifically taught that the propagation of the doctrine of entire sanctification was the reason that God raised up the Methodists in the world.[5] While some Methodists retained the episcopacy (such as the Free Methodist Church, Global Methodist Church and United Methodist Church), others, such as the Congregational Methodist Church have a congregational polity. Methodists were among the first Christians to accept women's ordination since the Montanists. Some 60-80 million Christians are Methodists and members of the World Methodist Council.[86][97][98] The holiness movement emerged within Methodism in the 19th-century.[A] As of 2015 , churches of the movement had an estimated 12 million adherents.[101] As Methodist denominations have historically preached two works of grace taught by John Wesley, (1) New Birth and (2) entire sanctification, and many denominations aligned with the holiness movement use Methodist in their name, it is difficult to draw a line between Holiness Methodist denominations and those not aligned with the holiness movement.[102][103] For example, the Free Methodist Church and the Church of the Nazarene are widely regarded as being aligned with the holiness movement and are core members of the World Methodist Council, along with denominations with mixed churchmanship, such as the United Methodist Church.[99]\n\nAlbright Brethren\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Albright Brethren were organized under the leadership of Jacob Albright, who converted to Methodism and preached to German-speaking people. Although the majority of the Albright Brethren merged with the United Brethren, two extant bodies continue today:\n\nEvangelical Church (ECNA)\n\nEvangelical Association\n\nEvening Light\n\n[edit]\n\nChurches of the Evening Light Reformation in 1880 emerged under the direction of Daniel Sidney Warner, and while they emerged under the influence of the holiness movement, they adhere to a position of antidenominationalism.[104] Classified as Holiness Restorationists, the Church of God (Anderson, Indiana) was the original work founded by Warner and its conservative holiness offshoot is the Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma).[105] While the Church of God (Restoration) is listed here, it is distinguished from the two aforementioned bodies by unique doctrines that have taken it in a direction of its own.[106]\n\nKeswickian\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Higher Life movement\n\nThe Higher Life movement emerged in the United Kingdom and emphasized the importance of sanctification, \"the deeper and higher life\".[107] It became popularized through the Keswick Conventions; W.E. Boardman's Keswickian theology had an influence on A.B. Simpson, who established the Christian and Missionary Alliance.[108]\n\nAlliance World Fellowship\n\nBorneo Evangelical Church (SIb Malaysia)\n\nChristian and Missionary Alliance\n\nQuaker\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Quakers\n\nQuakers, or Friends, originated under the work of George Fox, who taught personal conversion to Christ, along with the doctrine of Christian perfection.[109][110] The Friends have historically held that Christians are guided by the inward light to \"make the witness of God\" known to everyone.[111]\n\nShaker\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Shakers\n\nThe United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing was founded by Jane Wardley, Ann Lee, and Lucy Wright in 1747. At present, one active Shaker community remains, the Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village.[112]\n\nPlymouth Brethren\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Plymouth Brethren\n\nPlymouth Brethren is a conservative, low church, non-conformist, evangelical Christian movement whose history can be traced to Dublin, Ireland, in the late 1820s, originating from Anglicanism.[113]\n\nIrvingist\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Catholic Apostolic Church\n\nThe Catholic Apostolic churches were born out of the 1830s revival started in London by the teachings of Edward Irving, and out of the resultant Catholic Apostolic Church movement.[114]\n\nPentecostal and Charismatic\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Pentecostalism and Charismatic Christianity\n\nSee also: § Oneness Pentecostalism, and Gay Apostolic Pentecostals\n\nPentecostalism and Charismatic Christianity began in the 1900s. The two movements emphasize direct personal experience of God through baptism with the Holy Spirit. They represent some of the largest growing movements in Protestant Christianity.[115] Pentecostalism is divided between its original branch, Holiness Pentecostalism (which teaches three works of grace) and Finished Work Pentecostalism (which views sanctification only in a progressive manner). Oneness Pentecostalism, which rejects the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, split from Finished Work Pentecostalism and is covered in its own section in this article. The charismatic movement (including the Catholic Charismatic Renewal) was established within historic denominational traditions due to influence from Pentecostalism. According to the Pew Research Center, Pentecostals and Charismatics numbered some 280 million people in 2011.[82]\n\nHoliness Pentecostalism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Holiness Pentecostalism\n\nFinished Work Pentecostalism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Finished Work Pentecostalism\n\nCharismatics\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Charismatic Christianity\n\nNeo-charismatic movement\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Neo-charismatic movement\n\nConvergence\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Convergence Movement\n\nThe Convergence Movement originated from \"The Chicago Call\" in 1977, urging evangelical Protestants to reconnect with the liturgical historic roots of the Christian Church.[116] It emphasizes the convergence of sacramental, evangelical, and charismatic streams;[117] promoting biblical fidelity, creedal identity, and church unity.\n\nUniting and united\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: United and uniting churches\n\nThese united or uniting churches are the result of a merger between distinct denominational churches (e.g., Lutherans, Anglicans, Presbyterians and the Continental Reformed churches). As ecumenism progresses, unions between various Protestants are becoming more and more common, resulting in a growing number of united and uniting churches. Major examples of uniting churches are the United Protestant Church of France (2013) and the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (2004).[118][119] Churches are listed here when their disparate heritage marks them as inappropriately listed in the particular categories above.\n\nStone–Campbellite\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Stone–Campbell Movement\n\nNondenominational Christianity arose in the 18th century through the Stone–Campbell Movement, with followers organizing themselves simply as \"Christians\" and \"Disciples of Christ\".[B][120][122][123] The Stone–Campbell Movement was led by Barton Stone and Alexander Campbell.[122]\n\nAdventism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Adventism\n\nAdventism originated from the work of William Miller, who preached the end of the world and the second coming of Christ in 1843/44.[124] After the Great Disappointment, this year was reinterprted by Adventists as being the start of the investigative judgment.[125]\n\nNondenominational and other Evangelicals\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Nondenominational Christianity and Evangelicalism\n\nThe term Evangelical appears with the reformation and reblossoms in the 18th century and in the 19th century.[126] Evangelical Protestantism modernly understood is an inter-denominational Protestant movement which maintains the belief that the essence of the Gospel consists of the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ's atonement.[127]\n\nInternational Evangelicalism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Internet church\n\nAfrican Evangelicalism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Zionist Churches\n\nSee also: African-initiated church\n\nP'ent'ay\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: P'ent'ay\n\nP'ent'ay, simply known as Ethiopian-Eritrean Evangelicalism are a group of indigenous Protestant Eastern Baptist, Lutheran, Pentecostal, and Mennonite denominations in full communion with each other and believe that Ethiopian and Eritrean Evangelicalism are the reformation of the current Orthodox Tewahedo churches as well as the restoration of it to original Ethiopian Christianity. They uphold that in order for a person to be saved one has to accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior for the forgiveness of sins; and to receive Christ one must be \"born again\" (dagem meweled).[128] Its members make up a significant portion of the 2 million Eastern Protestant tradition.\n\nEastern Protestant\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Eastern Protestant Christianity\n\nThese churches resulted from a post–1800s reformation of Eastern Christianity, in line with Protestant beliefs and practices.\n\nDefunct Protestant churches and movements\n\n[edit]\n\nThese are protestant denominations, movements and organizations that existed historically, but no longer exist in modern times.\n\nOther Protestant churches and movements\n\n[edit]\n\nThese are denominations, movements, and organizations deriving from mainstream Protestantism but are not classifiable under historic or current Protestant movements nor as parachurch organizations.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following are independent and non-mainstream movements, denominations and organizations formed during various times in the history of Christianity by splitting from mainline Catholicism, Eastern or Oriental Orthodoxy, or Protestantism not classified in the previous lists.\n\nChristian Identitist\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Christian Identity\n\nEsoteric Christianity\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Esoteric Christianity and Western esotericism\n\nNeo-Gnostic\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Neo-Gnosticism\n\nEcclesia Gnostica\n\nEcclesia Gnostica Catholica\n\nEcclesia Pistis Sophia\n\nGnostic Church of France\n\nJohannite Church\n\nThe Process Church of The Final Judgment\n\nJudeo-Christian\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Judaizers and Judeo-Christian\n\nSee also: Christian Zionism and List of Sabbath-keeping churches\n\nMessianic Judaism\n\n[edit]\n\nNontrinitarian\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Nontrinitarianism\n\nSee also: Christomonism\n\nThese groups or organizations diverge from historic trinitarian theology (usually based on the Council of Nicaea) with different interpretations of Nontrinitarianism.\n\nBible Students and splinter groups\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bible Student movement\n\nChristian Science\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Christian Science\n\nLatter Day Saint movement\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Latter Day Saint movement and Mormonism\n\nMost Latter Day Saint denominations are derived from the Church of Christ established by Joseph Smith in 1830. The largest worldwide denomination of this movement, and the one publicly recognized as Mormonism, is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Some sects, known as the \"Prairie Saints\", broke away because they did not recognize Brigham Young as the head of the church, and did not follow him West in the mid-1800s. Other sects broke away over the abandonment of practicing plural marriage after the 1890 Manifesto. Other denominations are defined by either a belief in Joseph Smith as a prophet or acceptance of the Book of Mormon as scripture. The Latter Day Saints comprise a little over 16 million members collectively.[129]\n\nChurch of Christ (Latter Day Saints)\n\nSwedenborgianism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: The New Church\n\nUnitarianism and Universalism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Unitarianism and Christian Universalism\n\nOneness Pentecostalism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Oneness Pentecostalism and Gay Apostolic Pentecostals\n\nOther Nontrinitarians\n\n[edit]\n\nChristadelphians\n\nIglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ)\n\nKingdom of Jesus Christ\n\nLa Luz del Mundo\n\nMembers Church of God International\n\nServetism\n\nTolstoyan movement\n\nChinese salvationist and other East Asian\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Chinese salvationist religions\n\nChristian Tabernacle\n\nGod Worshipping Society\n\nGood News Mission\n\nUnification Church\n\nRod of Iron Ministries\n\nLife Word Mission\n\nNon-church movement\n\nOlive Tree\n\nProvidence\n\nSanban Puren Pai\n\nShincheonji\n\nSpirit Church (China)\n\nFuhuodao\n\nThe Church of Almighty God\n\nVictory Altar\n\nWorld Mission Society Church of God\n\nSouthcottist\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Southcottism\n\nChristian Israelite Church\n\nHouse of David (commune)\n\nPanacea Society\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nParachurch\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Ecumenism and Parachurch organization\n\nParachurch organizations are Christian faith-based organizations that work outside and across denominations to engage in social welfare and evangelism.
