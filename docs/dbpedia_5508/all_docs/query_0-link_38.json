        "text": "Christians have increasingly discussed political theology over the past several years—at least in my conservative evangelical circles. A lot of Christians are both interested and confused. They are fascinated by the topic, but they are having trouble thinking clearly about it because it is so complicated. This article is my attempt to add some clarity by framing a debated topic. I proceed in three parts: (1) I start by briefly defining religion, politics, and political theology; (2) then I propose seven views on religion and government; (3) and I conclude with seven reflections.\n\nPart 1. Starting with Definitions: Religion, Politics, and Political Theology\n\nLet’s start by defining three basic terms: religion, politics, and political theology.\n\nReligion is “an organized system of beliefs that answers ultimate questions and commends certain actions or behaviors based on the answers to those questions.” Those questions concern ultimate reality (i.e., God), the nature of the universe, the nature of mankind, what happens to a man at death, and how we know right and wrong. As a Christian, I believe that the religious institution God has ordained is Christ’s church.\n\nPolitics is the science and art of governing men (to paraphrase Aristotle). In this article I’m referring specifically to politics at the civil level of the government or the governing authorities or the state.\n\nPolitical theology is a theology of politics—particularly how religion and politics should relate. So a particular view of political theology is a philosophy or system of ideas that attempts to explain how religion and politics should relate.\n\nThroughout this article I typically refer to the broader categories of religion and government instead of the narrower categories of church and state.\n\nI use the label religion instead of church because religion is broader than the Christian church. Religion encompasses organized institutions like Islam. In a sense, religion also includes less formal belief systems like secularism (i.e., the view that the state must be separate from religious institutions), but secularism is not an organized religion.\n\nI use the label government instead of state because government can be broader than state. For many people the word state refers to a modern nation-state, but the term government broadly encompasses all sorts of civic rule.\n\nIt is challenging to use terms for political theology that apply equally well in all historical settings. In the ancient world, religion and politics are fitting terms. In the Middle Ages and magisterial Protestantism (which includes Christendom), ecclesiastical government and civil government are fitting terms. In early modern political thought, church and state (and the separation of church of state) are fitting terms.\n\nHistorical Setting\n\nFitting Term for Religion\n\nFitting Term for Government\n\nAncient World\n\nReligion\n\nPolitics\n\nMiddle Ages and Magisterial Protestantism\n\nEcclesiastical Government\n\nCivil Government\n\nEarly Modern Political Thought\n\nChurch\n\nState\n\nPart 2. Seven Views on Religion and Government\n\nIn this article I propose a taxonomy of seven views on religion and government. In other words, people have held at least seven distinct major views on political theology. (I am including both Christians and non-Christians for breadth.) I am proposing a taxonomy in the form of a spectrum that moves from views that separate religion from the government to views that combine religion and the government. I concisely describe each view and then conclude with some reflections.\n\nIntroductory Qualification\n\nMy concluding reflections include some qualifications, but I should mention one upfront: The people and groups I list to illustrate a view—both historic examples and modern examples—do not necessarily share the exact same political theology. There is a spectrum of views within each view, and those I list within a particular view may be different in significant ways. But they share some similarities given the criteria I lay out. This article is simply my attempt to sketch a spectrum of views on political theology—both historically and currently—in order to gain clarity on a complicated topic so that we better understand before we evaluate.\n\nView 1. Secular Suppression: The secular government suppresses religion.\n\nPosition: The government and religion should be totally separate in the sense that the government should be secular because God does not exist. The government should not merely separate from religion but should suppress religion. (A militantly atheist government does not consider its belief system to be a religion.)\n\nHistoric example: Karl Marx\n\nModern examples: the former Soviet Union (Marxist-Leninist atheism), North Korea (officially an atheist government); secular progressivism\n\nFor view 1, the government affirms secularism in a way that I would call religious, but I contrast secularism with religion in the heading because secularism is not an organized religion in the same sense as Christianity or Judaism or Islam. In the headings for views 1–7, the term religion refers to organized religion.\n\nFor view 1, the government protects itself from being contaminated by religion. For view 2, religion protects itself from being contaminated by the government.\n\nView 2. Religious Separation: Religion must radically separate from the government.\n\nPosition: The government and religion should be totally separate in the sense that they are distinct spheres that must not overlap because the government is worldly. Consequently, individual Christians must separate from the government by not wielding the sword as combatants or as magistrates because to do so would be to cooperate with a sinful institution.\n\nHistoric example: Anabaptists\n\nModern examples: traditional Mennonites, Stanley Hauerwas, Greg Boyd\n\nViews 1 and 2 see hostility between the government and religion. View 3 envisions neutrality with no intermingling.\n\nView 3. Religious Neutrality: The government must be religiously neutral.\n\nPosition: The government and religion should be separate in the sense that the government should be religiously neutral and particular religions should not influence the government. The government may be religiously neutral in one of two ways: (1) by promoting no religion—that is, a pluralistic secularism that does not necessarily deny God’s existence but wants to keep the peace between opposing religions—or (2) by promoting a civil religion, which is “a set of practices, symbols and beliefs distinct from traditional religion, yet providing a universal values paradigm around which the citizenry can unite.” Either way, the public square should be religiously neutral; religious people should publicly argue based on natural law and not their particular religion.\n\nHistoric examples: classical liberalism (John Locke, John Stuart Mill, etc.; emphasis on a free market; to some degree America had a Protestant civil religion until the 1950s), libertarianism (emphasis on individual autonomy), progressive liberalism (emphasis on the welfare state and freedom from traditional sexual ethics)\n\nModern examples: John Rawls, who emphasizes religious neutrality in the government; Darryl Hart, who emphasizes political neutrality in the church\n\nFor view 4 (in contrast to view 3), the public square should not be religiously neutral.\n\nView 4. Religious Influence: The government should not promote only one particular religion, yet religion may influence the government within limited parameters.\n\nPosition: The government and the church are separate in the sense that they have distinct God-authorized jurisdictions. God authorizes the government to wield the sword (which a government may justly do against an individual Christian who has broken the law), and God authorizes the church to exercise the keys (which a church may rightly do by refusing to affirm that an individual person with governmental authority is a Christian). The government should not exclusively promote a particular religion (e.g., the government recognizes religious freedom and does not institute a state church or spread doctrine that is explicitly Christian), and the government should not restrict the spread of false religious beliefs (e.g., the government should not refuse to allow a Mosque to be built in the town square). But religion may influence the government. An individual governmental authority (like a United States senator) may argue for a political position based on religion, and the government may adopt that position—but not on the basis of religion. The public square cannot be religiously neutral; it is a religious battleground. For Christians, the church’s mission is to make disciples; individual Christians should significantly influence the government; and the government should not institutionalize Christianity (e.g., the government should not put the Apostle’s Creed in the constitution).\n\nHistoric examples: most Baptists —e.g., the Second London Baptist Confession of Faith (1689), Isaac Backus; English non-conformists/Separatists such as Congregationalists and Quakers\n\nModern examples: Wayne Grudem, Jonathan Leeman, John Piper, Andrew Walker, Scott Aniol, David VanDrunen, Robert George\n\nFor view 5, religion should not merely influence the government. The government should identify as a Christian government.\n\nView 5. Christian Government: The government and religion overlap.\n\nBy labeling view 5 as “Christian government,” I am using the specific adjective Christian instead of the more general adjective religious because this view is peculiar to Protestant Christianity.\n\nPosition: The government and the Christian church are two God-ordained institutions that have distinct and overlapping God-authorized jurisdictions, and they should work together under God’s ultimate authority. For Christians, the church’s mission is to make disciples of all nations; individual Christians should significantly influence the government; and the government may institutionalize Christianity to some degree (e.g., by putting God in the constitution and by having a religious test for office). The government should identify as a Christian government in the sense that the laws and customs it promotes derive from the ultimate authority of God. The governing authorities should know that they are accountable to God for how they rule (cf. Daniel 4:26), and it is fitting for the government to exhort citizens to fear the living God (cf. Daniel 6:26). The government should pursue justice by promoting the natural law (which the Ten Commandments summarize) as much as prudently possible. The government should (along with the church and society) help create cultural conditions conducive for conversion and for the common good. While the government should promote and to some degree enforce a just social order based on a right understanding of God and man (e.g., the government should promote marriage and the family and demote no-fault divorce, adultery, homosexuality, transgenderism, and pornography), the government should not force citizens to follow Christianity since only the Spirit’s regeneration produces a heart change; the church’s weapon is not the sword but instead the word, water, bread, and wine. This model is not feasible long-term if many of the citizens are not genuine Christians.\n\nHistoric examples: magisterial Reformers (e.g., Martin Luther, John Calvin, Ulrich Zwingli, John Knox, Richard Hooker, Johannes Althusius), the Reformed scholastics, the church of England, John Gill, American Puritans (e.g., John Winthrop, William Bradford, John Cotton, Cotton Mather, Jonathan Edwards), the basic approach in various colonies and states at the time of America’s founding\n\nModern examples: Brad Littlejohn, Doug Wilson, Joe Rigney, Daniel Strand, some versions of “Christian nationalism” (though many who hold this position do not prefer that label)\n\nFor view 5, the government enforces a particular ethic that is tied to a religion. For view 6, religion controls the government to such a degree that the government enforces the religion itself.\n\nView 6. Religion over Government: Religion governs the government and directs the government to enforce religion.\n\nPosition: A particular religion governs the government and directs the government to enforce that religion. Some call this view the doctrine of the two swords in which the sword of religion trumps the sword of the government. (For medieval Roman Catholics, both swords belong to the Pope, and the Pope directly wields the spiritual sword and indirectly wields the temporal sword by commanding government authorities.) God ordains the government to ensure peace in society, which includes to some extent governing church assemblies, ensuring that the church maintains orthodoxy, and punishing people who refuse to comply. The magistrate might say, “The Pope is telling me that John Doe is a heretic, so the government must punish him.”\n\nHistoric example: the two-swords view of medieval Roman Catholicism\n\nModern example: I’m not sure what to suggest as a good modern example. Some might classify Rousas J. Rushdoony in this view, but Andrew Sandlin, a former colleague of Rushdoony, disagrees in his Christ Over All interview. Sandlin argues that Rushdoony, the basic architect of Christian reconstructionism (i.e., reconstruct America as a Christian republic by rebuilding it on the foundation of the Mosaic law’s moral and civil aspects), does not include governmental coercion of Christian religion in his political theology. Rather, Rushdoony advocates a principled application of the Mosaic law—something closer to what I propose as view 5 above.\n\nBoth views 6 and 7 are a single, unified polity with two distinct authorities—government and religion. View 6 is religion over government, and view 7 is government over religion.\n\nView 7. Government over Religion: The government governs and enforces religion.\n\nPosition: The government governs religion with a state “church” and forces citizens to follow (or at least to not oppose) a particular religion. (In a sense, the distinction here between government and religion breaks down in that the government is a political religion. Government and religion are integrated.)\n\nHistoric examples: ancient Egypt (e.g., when its Pharaoh was oppressing God’s people prior to the exodus), Roman emperor worship, maybe Constantine, Erastianism (e.g., Henry VIII), typically Islam when it is a nation’s dominant religion\n\nModern examples: Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan\n\nPart 3. Seven Concluding Reflections\n\nHere are seven concluding reflections on my taxonomy of political theology:\n\n1. My taxonomy is describing rather than evaluating.\n\nIt is important to evaluate each view of political theology, but that is not the point of this article. Accurately describing a view of political theology is foundational to evaluating it. Before you can properly evaluate a particular view of political theology, you should first understand it so well that you can articulate it in a way that its adherents would affirm. My aim is that this spectrum of major views on political theology will help clarify a complex topic so that we are not talking past each other when we move from describing to evaluating.\n\n2. Trying to systematize the various views on political theology is challenging, but that should not prevent us from trying.\n\nMy colleague David Haines told me that trying to systematize political theology is like trying to lasso a tornado. There is a reason that so few political theology experts try to do it—it is messy and incredibly complicated (hence all my qualifications in this article!). For any proposed taxonomy, one can easily criticize, “Yes, but …” (which is what some friends said to me when they gave me feedback on this article!). Even if it is impossible to compose a perfect taxonomy, an imperfect taxonomy can be helpful for gaining clarity.\n\nTo understand political theology well requires skill in at least four fields: exegesis, systematic theology, history, and political theory. I do not have formal training in political history and political theory, so that makes it more challenging for me to systematize views on political theology. I am an evangelical pastor and a seminary professor who is joyfully loyal to King Jesus. My main formal training equips me to carefully read the Bible (i.e., biblical exegesis) and to systematically correlate how the whole Bible beautifully coheres in line with reality (i.e., systematic theology). The ability to do exegesis and systematic theology well are important components for a Christian’s political theology, but to understand political theology well also requires understanding history (both religious history and political history) and political theory. Since I do not have as much formal training in political history and political theory, I have been reading widely and conversing with experts in order to develop a better systematic understanding of political theology. The further I have waded into the field of political theology, the more I have become aware of how much I don’t know. I’ll open a door only to discover ten more doors behind it.\n\nIf you’re not an expert on a challenging topic, does that mean you should “stay in your lane” and avoid addressing it? Maybe, but not necessarily. Two scholars have encouraged me by their examples: (1) D. A. Carson is a world-class New Testament scholar, and he applied his skills at reading and thinking to address postmodernism, culture, and tolerance. (2) Carl Trueman is a distinguished historian of the Reformation, and he applied his skills at reading and thinking to address the modern self.\n\nIf a person has learned how to read and think rigorously and systematically, then he can apply that skillset to more than what he has formal training in. I think it would be misguided to tell authors like Carson and Trueman, “Stay in your lane!” Granted, when you get out of “your lane,” there is more of a learning curve, and it is difficult and dangerous because you may lack sufficient knowledge and nuance. But it can be done well. And I think Christians should encourage (rather than discourage) big-picture, integrative thinking. It is challenging to systematize the various views on political theology, but that should not prevent us from trying. (And I warmly invite constructive feedback on my attempt, especially from those with an expertise in history and political theory.)\n\n3. There is a lot more to say.\n\nMy taxonomy is a provisional attempt to simplify a debated topic that is extraordinarily complex. This article could easily become a series of books that explores connections between the various views and how and why they answer questions like these:\n\nWhat does each view presuppose about reality? For example, is what C. S. Lewis calls “the Tao” real? Does God exist? If so, is God the triune God of the Old and New Testaments? Has God created the family, the church, and the government as overlapping institutions with distinct jurisdictions? If so, how do we determine the boundaries of those spheres? Is Jesus the Messiah the King of the universe?\n\nWhat is each view’s political philosophy? For example, what is religious liberty, and should it exist? Where does political authority come from—that is, who may rule legitimately, and by what authority? What are the duties of a citizen? Should churches receive tax exemptions?\n\nHow does each view argue exegetically and theologically? For example, should the government enforce both the first and second tables of the Ten Commandments or just the second table or neither? What do “good” and “bad” and “wrong” and “evil” refer to in Romans 13:3–4 and 1 Peter 2:13–16? Does the government have any legitimate jurisdiction over churches in doctrine or practice? May the government mandate church attendance? Should Christians pay taxes? If so, when does a tax become tyrannical? Should individual Christians be involved in political affairs? What is the mission of the church? Should the church attempt to build the culture? If so, how? What is the nature of the end times, including the millennium? And how does that inform the mission of the church and its relationship to the state? Finally, what is appropriate for religious leaders to preach and teach regarding the government (e.g., regarding an upcoming election in a democratic government)?\n\n4. My taxonomy may mislead one to think that the various views on the spectrum are distinct in neat and tidy ways.\n\nAt least seven factors further complicate the categories of political theology:\n\n1. My spectrum is more like a sliding scale, including nuances for various positions within each view (as I mention in the “Introductory Qualification” at the beginning of this article). Here are three examples:\n\nFor views 3 and 4, one could argue that it would be better to combine those as a single view called liberalism. The reason is that it is possible to simultaneously desire that the government should be religiously neutral in some sense and to desire that religion should influence the government in some sense.\n\nFor view 5, some proponents support a state church (e.g., Brad Littlejohn, an Anglican), and others argue that we could improve on the first version of Christendom by not establishing a state church but instead institutionalizing “mere Christianity”—Christendom 2.0 (e.g., Doug Wilson, a Presbyterian).\n\nFor view 6, a particular religion may exercise a lighter hand in government matters (e.g., by giving the government a long leash and only occasionally stepping in to restore order), or a particular religion may exercise a heavier hand in government matters (e.g., by mandating and enforcing specific religious and educational activities).\n\n2. Two people who share the same basic view of political theology may reach similar conclusions but for different reasons. Those reasons may include different theological methods and hermeneutics.\n\n3. What is small and local may look different when it is large and national. For example, a small Anabaptist community (view 2) might seem more like view 5 or 6 on a large national scale with the church telling the community how to govern men. Does John Calvin’s Geneva fit under view 5 or 6?\n\n4. Different approaches to political theology may be more pragmatic and prudential in particular contexts. For example, a Christian in a totalitarian state that persecutes Christians is more likely to take an Anabaptist approach to the government. Or a Christian in America today may think that the New England Puritans had a better government than America’s current government, but he may conclude that since it is unlikely that Americans will replace classical liberalism with the Christian ethics of the Puritans anytime soon, Christians today may attempt to make incremental gains within the context of classical liberalism (e.g., by minimizing specific evils such as abortion and transgenderism).\n\n5. The outermost poles of the spectrum have more in common with each other than the middle views in that views 1, 6, and 7 are totalitarian—either in an atheistic way that separates government from religion (view 1) or in a religious way that combines government and religion (views 6 and 7).\n\n6. My spectrum is based on the single main issue of how religion and the government relate. Considering other factors would complexify matters. For example, if my current spectrum is on a horizontal axis, I could add a vertical axis to depict a spectrum of views on one’s disposition toward the current regime. On one end, some are generally pro-regime and favor incremental change, and on the other end, some are anti-regime and favor regime change. Different instincts regarding the current regime explain why two people can share the same basic political theology but make significantly different prudential judgments.\n\n7. Another issue that complicates the spectrum is the broader issue of how Christ and culture relate. Carson explains, “In some sense debates about church and state are subsets of more comprehensive debates about Christ and culture.” Kevin DeYoung describes four basic ways that Christians relate Christianity and politics (riffing on Richard Niebuhr’s Christ and Culture categories):\n\nChristianity-against-politics: “Christianity is largely seen as something that stands opposed to the messy, often idolatrous world of politics. … [This] approach is strong on warning Christians against putting too much hope in kings and in earthly kingdoms. … Christians with this approach are often uninterested in learning the intellectual contours of political science or in the long history of moral philosophy. They can also be unrealistic about how political and social change happens.”\n\nChristianity-above-politics: “Christianity is seen as the Truth that transcends all earthly systems. … This approach understands that Christianity is not to be identified with any particular political philosophy, political party, or intellectual tradition. On the negative side, the gospel critiques can often be superficial and lead to a sloppy moral equivalence. Thus, the ‘Christian’ approach ends up being the supposed golden mean between conservatism and progressivism, or the imaginary midpoint between Marxism and capitalism.”\n\nChristianity-as-politics: “The message of Christianity and the task of the individual Christian is seen as irreducibly political. … Christians with this approach understand that Jesus is Lord over all. … This approach often has too much ‘already’ and too little ‘not yet.’”\n\nChristianity-under[girds]-politics: “Christian ideas and Christian communities are seen as essential to a healthy political order. … This approach understands and appreciates the role Christianity has played in the development of Western culture and in the establishment of a free and prosperous people. There is also wisdom in recognizing that Christianity does not offer a full-blown political philosophy, but that the best moral philosophy will be built upon a Christian view of the human person and of human nature. On the negative side, this approach can reduce the Christian faith to something of utilitarian value.”\n\nDeYoung suggests in a lecture some illustrations for these four approaches:\n\nChristianity-against-politics: John Piper\n\nChristianity-above-politics: Tim Keller\n\nChristianity-as-politics: Doug Wilson\n\nChristianity-under[girds]-politics: Hillsdale College\n\nDeYoung recognizes strengths and weaknesses of each of these approaches, and he personally resonates with these four approaches in reverse order.\n\n5. Christians are becoming more interested in political theology because what seemed to be a neutral public square is now an increasingly polarized battleground.\n\nOne reason political theology is surging in popularity for many Christians in Western contexts is that they have lost confidence in classical liberalism. Progressive liberals have co-opted classical liberalism, and some blame classical liberalism itself for the decline. Classical liberalism can work well but only when coupled with cultural Christianity (a condition that is true for other political theologies as well).\n\nWhether or not you agree with Aaron Renn in all the details of his argument, I think you can concede that he is onto something by explaining that our culture has moved from a positive world for Christianity to a neutral world to a negative world. Christians in America are feeling threatened now in ways that are making them wonder, “Am I a Christian nationalist?” Almost nobody was asking that question a decade ago. Christians today are increasingly open to theological retrieval to learn from thinkers prior to America’s founding—theologians such as magisterial Protestants.\n\nSome Christians today feel conflicted about thinking deeply about political theology because it seems counter to the New Testament for Christians to lead a civil government. This reminds me of a conversation that Philip Yancey recounts:\n\nSeveral years ago a Muslim man said to me, “I find no guidance in the Qur’an on how Muslims should live as a minority in a society and no guidance in the New Testament on how Christians should live as a majority.” He put his finger on a central difference between the two faiths. One, born at Pentecost, tends to thrive cross-culturally and even counterculturally, often coexisting with oppressive governments. The other, geographically anchored in Mecca, was founded simultaneously as a religion and a state.\n\nFor some Christians it feels awkward to think about what the best political theology is because they seem to think that the church is most faithful and healthy when the civil government is persecuting Christians. But God commands us to pray “for kings and all who are in high positions” for this purpose: “that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.” Why? Because “this is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior” (1 Tim. 2:1–3).\n\nSome Christians today feel more at home when they are a persecuted minority. They think that martyrdom is better than Christendom. They might question whether they are being faithful to God if they constituted the majority of citizens in a nation, and they have not contemplated how Christians should steward such a responsibility if they did possess the power to lead a civil government. And they are alarmed by fellow Christians who have contemplated such matters and who reach conclusions aligned with the magisterial Reformers and many of America’s colonists and founders.\n\n6. Christians should beware of prematurely separating from each other based on different political theologies.\n\nIt is challenging to sketch a spectrum of views on political theology. It is even more challenging to evaluate those views on the basis of exegesis, theology, history, and political theory.\n\nThe differences between the seven views in my taxonomy are significant. But how significant? For example, can Christians within views 3, 4, and 5 work closely together in Christian ministry? Does disagreeing entail that Christian colleagues (like pastors or professors) can’t closely work together? I think it depends on the nature of the disagreement and the nature of their fellowship in Christian ministry.\n\nWhile it is reasonable that some Christian ministries may want their primary leader (e.g., a lead pastor or president) to hold to a particular view of political theology, it seems to me that brothers in close ministry partnership may harmoniously and respectfully serve together while not completely agreeing on aspects of political theology.\n\nAt this moment in my American context, I think it is wise for Christians not to prematurely separate from each other based on different political theologies. The reason is that the orcs are not just at the gates; they are infiltrating the city as citizens and magistrates. While a sexual revolution is rapidly transforming our culture, I don’t think fellow Christians should divide right now over the hypothetical scenario—which might occur decades in the future—of how to govern a nation if the vast majority of its citizens are Christians. There are more pressing matters to band together to address—evils such as abortion and wokeness and LGBT ideology and socialism. The strategy for faithful Christians right now involves basics that we should be able to agree on—such as be a good egg, love your wife, stay in fellowship, worship every week, teach your kids, work patiently, and keep politics in perspective.\n\nAs Kevin DeYoung insightfully explains, Reformed evangelicalism has painfully splintered over the past decade into at least four groups, which DeYoung labels contrite, compassionate, careful, and courageous. The Christians in my circles are largely in the careful and courageous groups. Must those third and fourth groups splinter even further over political theology?\n\nI am not saying that all that matters is rooting out evil ideologies. We don’t want to be only defensive; we want to go on the offensive with God’s truth—especially the truth of the gospel. We pray for revival! And if in God’s mercy the vast majority of America’s citizens become Christians, then it will be increasingly important for Christians to think through how to be wise stewards of the government. But while we are living under a government that persecutes or marginalizes Christians, is this the time to sharply separate over what the ideal political theology would be in the future hypothetical situation that most citizens are genuine Christians? When I think about political theology in light of theological triage, one of my burdens is that Christians not unnecessarily divide over differences on political theology.\n\n7. No civil government will be flawless until King Jesus returns.\n\nWhen I asked my mentor Don Carson for feedback on this article, he replied, “What starts off as an even-handed analysis of a variety of power-sharing patterns quickly becomes topsy-turvy as soon as the patterns of diverse relationships are overwhelmed by the actual issues on the ground. There is only one ultimate solution: Even so, come, Lord Jesus.” Yes, as 1 Corinthians 16:22 says, Marana tha (μαράνα θά)—Lord, come!\n\nEndnotes"
