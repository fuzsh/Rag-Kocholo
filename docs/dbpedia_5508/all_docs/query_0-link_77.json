        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Salvation Army is a Protestant denomination of the Christian Church with over 1.6 million members in 109 countries.\n\nIn the UK there are over 800 Salvation Army parishes (known as corps), over 1,500 ordained ministers (known as officers) and 54,000 members (including senior soldiers, adherents and junior soldiers).\n\nSalvation Army officers wear a military-style uniform, though some officers may wear a more informal uniform when undertaking certain duties. Members of the church often choose to wear a uniform, but are not required to do so.\n\nSalvation Army halls are registered as places of worship. Salvation Army officers are ordained ministers of religion, and can conduct weddings and funerals.\n\nThe Salvation Army is famous for its work with people who have fallen on hard times: it offers help to the elderly, the young, offenders, drug addicts and blind and disabled people; it provides food and shelter for the homeless and operates food distribution centres.\n\nThe Salvation Army was founded in 1865, in the East End of London, by William Booth. Booth was an evangelist who wanted to offer practical help to the poor and destitute as well as preaching the Gospel to them. It was originally called the Christian Mission, but changed its name to the Salvation Army in 1878.\n\nIn brief\n\nThe Salvation Army is an evangelical Protestant denomination of the universal Christian Church\n\nIt is a 'holiness' movement\n\nIts message is based on the Bible\n\nIts ministry is motivated by the love of God\n\nIts mission is:\n\nto preach the gospel of Jesus Christ\n\nto meet human needs in His name without discrimination\n\nIts theology is mainstream Protestant\n\nIt is famous for:\n\nits evangelistic work\n\nits social work\n\nits family member tracing service\n\nits quasi-military structure\n\nthe uniform worn by members\n\nits music\n\nIt was founded in 1865 in London, England, by William Booth\n\nThe name Salvation Army dates from 1878\n\nStatistics\n\nWorldwide\n\n1.6 million members (including senior soldiers, adherents and junior soldiers)\n\nFound in 109 countries\n\n15,339 corps (parishes or church units)\n\n17,346 full time ministers (officers)\n\n1,000 schools and 250 hospitals and clinics worldwide, in impoverished areas\n\n2,500 bands - both brass ensembles and other styles of music\n\nUK\n\nOver 54,000 members (including senior soldiers, adherents and junior soldiers)\n\nOver 800 corps (parishes or church units)\n\nOver 1500 full time ministers (officers)\n\nOdds and ends\n\n\"Strawberry Fields Forever\" in the Beatles 1966 song by that name, is John Lennon's nostalgic reference to a Salvation Army orphanage called Strawberry Field in Woolton, England. Lennon is said to have played with childhood friends in the trees behind the orphanage when he was a boy.\n\nThe phrase 'on the wagon' was coined by men and women receiving the services of The Salvation Army. Former National Commander Evangeline Booth - founder William Booth's daughter - drove a hay wagon through the streets of New York to encourage alcoholics on board for a ride back to The Salvation Army. Hence, alcoholics in recovery were said to be on the wagon.\n\nHistory\n\nWilliam Booth\n\nThe Salvation Army was formed in England in 1865 by William Booth, a former Methodist minister.\n\nBooth had his first real religious experiences with the Wesleyan Methodists in his early teens. He was converted to Christianity in 1844, and gave his first sermons at the age of seventeen in Nottingham in 1846. By the 1850s he was working as an evangelist amongst the poor and uneducated.\n\nBooth was something of a maverick and didn't fit easily in the ranks of existing religious institutions. After falling out with several churches he decided to strike out alone and launched the 'Christian Mission to the Heathen of our Own Country' in 1865 from a tent in Whitechapel, a poor district of London.\n\nBooth believed that instead of standing at the door of the church saying \"why don't you come in?\" Christians must go out and meet the world on its own terms.\n\nA working class church\n\nBooth felt that the mainstream churches in Britain were too middle-class to be successful in bringing God to the masses.\n\nThe Salvation Army was not middle-class. Booth's followers and those who joined him in the work were drawn from the poor.\n\nAs a result, most Salvationists understood working-class people and values and could speak to them on their terms. This greatly helped Booth's mission to succeed.\n\nA single leader\n\nThe movement grew rapidly but by 1877 it became clear to Booth that it would only succeed if it was directed by a single strong hand - his own.\n\nHe took control of the Army saying, \"I am determined that Evangelists in this Mission must hold my views and work on my lines,\" and he ran the Army as a dictatorship, taking personal authority over everything.\n\nThe modern Army is no longer run like this - its leadership is consultative rather than autocratic.\n\nA Salvation Army\n\nSince Booth saw his movement as engaged in a spiritual battle against the forces of sin it was logical that he should adopt a military metaphor that had a long history in Christianity.\n\nIn 1878 the mission adopted the title of 'Salvation Army', seeing itself as:\n\na Salvation Army to carry the Blood of Christ and the Fire of the Holy Ghost into every corner of the world\n\nWilliam Booth\n\nIt adopted a quasi-military structure the same year and Booth ceased to be the General Superintendent and became simply 'The General'.\n\nTo boldly go\n\nLike secular soldiers, the Salvation Army had to go to the most dangerous places to attack the enemy. To save the souls of the poor they carried their battle into the roughest and toughest places of British cities. Their only weapon was the word of God, backed up by music.\n\nThey were not always welcome - in 1882 over 600 Salvationists were physically assaulted in the UK, including women and children. The War Cry (the Salvation Army journal) reported one incident like this:\n\nThe storm raged, the wind blew, rain and snow came down. Stones were thrown, a brickbat striking the head of Sergeant Fellowes, breaking his head, and causing the loss of a pint of blood. He was taken to the hospital, had his head bandaged, and came back leaping and praising God.\n\nWar Cry\n\nMaking saints out of sinners\n\nBooth's first aim was to save fallen human beings from sin by converting them to Christianity, but he wanted to do more; to turn them into saints.\n\nThey wouldn't be saints because they were morally perfect; they would be saints because they were God's chosen, because Christ was alive in them, and because they would dedicate their lives to building God's kingdom on earth.\n\nTheir mission was quite simple - to save other souls for Christ. They had been 'saved to save'.\n\nTools of mission\n\nHelp to the poor\n\nDespite Booth's early experiences with the poor of Nottingham, the Army was not created to be an instrument of social change. Apart from a few minor projects, the early Army concentrated on pure evangelism - on prayer and preaching - to win converts.\n\nIn the middle of the 1880s senior Army officers realised that poverty was a serious obstacle to their mission - people found it hard to think about the state of their souls if they were worrying about where the next meal was coming from.\n\nSo the Army began to set up centres where people could find food and shelter. This initiative gave them a new access to people living in extreme poverty, and there were many of those in Victorian England.\n\nBelief not argument\n\nThe Army did not try to convert people to Christianity by using logic to convince them that Christianity was true. The Army's great engine of conversion was prayer. As Booth put it, \"Argument never opened the eyes of the blind. Do not argue, but pray.\"\n\nAn Army catch-phrase is \"prayer at the centre of our mission and mission at the centre of our prayer.\"\n\nLives not argument\n\n\"It's not the arguments that convince them, it's the lives.\"\n\nThe Army believes that the behaviour and lifestyle of Salvationists comprise another powerful weapon of conversion. They seek to set an example by living in love and unity in a world of separateness and conflict and loving people who are hard to love.\n\nThe music\n\nMusic has always been important to the Salvation Army. William Booth famously asked 'Why should the devil have all the best tunes?'\n\nThe Salvation Army's first band was \"recognised\" by William Booth in 1879. It consisted of Charles Fry, a local builder in Salisbury, and his three sons.\n\nSalvation Army preachers in Salisbury were being attacked by local rowdies at their open air meetings. Fry and his sons offered to act as bodyguards and brought their instruments to accompany the singing. The music turned out to reduce tension, as well as drowning any shouts and abuse. Fry is commemorated by a blue plaque in Salt Street, Salisbury.\n\nIn 1880 Booth issued a General Order in the War Cry encouraging the development of brass bands. The same year saw the publication of the first book of Salvation Army music; another volume followed in 1883.\n\nOne of the secrets of the Army's musical success was its technique of taking well-known music-hall and the popular songs and giving them a Christian text. Although the Army does use many traditional hymn tunes, this use of unchurchy popular melodies gives a unique sound to Salvation Army worship.\n\nThe Salvation Army now has approximately 2,500 brass bands worldwide, among other musical styles used in their worship.\n\nA Salvation Army brass band is made up of cornets (Eb and Bb), flugelhorn, alto horn, euphonium, baritone, trombone (tenor and bass), tuba (Eb and Bb) and percussion. Other ensembles are also used.\n\nModern evangelism\n\nThe Salvation Army has recently (2004) looked at the evangelical techniques needed for the modern age.\n\nIt believes that the church should look beyond mere techniques and focus on the fact that \"relationships are fundamental to the task of evangelisation\".\n\nAnd while the Army acknowledges that the internet and other media have a part to play it notes that some things never change:\n\nPeople who are highly literate and technologically aware, as well as those who are traumatised or dispossessed, often hunger for someone to actually talk and listen to them.\n\nSalvation Army\n\nAgape and ALOVE\n\nAgape (a Greek word pronounced a-ga-pay) is a Christian term meaning spiritual, platonic and selfless love.\n\n'God is love' says the Church, but what does love really mean?\n\n2000 years ago, Jesus' friends faced the same question. They went to great lengths to find a word for God's love that set it apart from soppy love, puppy love, lust, adoration or infatuation and staked a claim to the word 'agape'.\n\nToday, The Salvation Army is making up its own word ALOVE. ALOVE is agape in English.\n\nALOVE is a Godly, gritty, unconditional, sacrificial and vibrant love.\n\nSalvation Army\n\nThe ALOVE initiative (\"it rhymes with above\") was launched in March 2004. It is aimed at getting youths and young adults involved with the Salvation Army.\n\nBeliefs\n\nSalvation Army beliefs\n\nThe Salvation Army is a mainstream Protestant church. Its beliefs are based entirely on the Bible.\n\nThere is nothing unusual about the doctrines held by members of the Salvation Army - they are much the same as those of other evangelical protestant groups.\n\nWhat is different is the passion with which Salvationists hold these beliefs, and the way it fills them with a desire to fight the evils of the world and save other people from sin and damnation.\n\nSalvationists hold their beliefs with \"infectious joy\". They \"glorify their Lord by living as rejoicing Christians. The world has gloom and sadness enough of its own. The joy of the Lord is the strength of the Army spirit.\"\n\nSalvationists don't retire to the quiet of a religious community to keep themselves pure; they plunge joyously into a sinful world to bring freedom to those in chains.\n\nThe Army describes itself like this:\n\nThe Salvation Army is a fellowship of people who have accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Saviour and Lord and whose common aim is to induce others to subject themselves to the lordship of Christ.\n\nSalvation Army\n\nThe eleven articles of faith\n\nThe core doctrine of the Salvation Army is set out in its eleven articles of faith:\n\nWe believe that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments were given by inspiration of God: and that they only constitute the Divine rule of Christian faith and practice.\n\nWe believe that there is only one God, who is infinitely perfect, the Creator, Preserver, and Governor of all things, and who is the only proper object of religious worship.\n\nWe believe that there are three persons in the Godhead - the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost - undivided in essence and coequal in power and glory.\n\nWe believe that in the person of Jesus Christ the Divine and human natures are united, so that He is truly and properly God and truly and properly man.\n\nWe believe that our first parents were created in a state of innocency, but by their disobedience they lost their purity and happiness; and that in consequence of their fall all men have become sinners, totally depraved, and as such are justly exposed to the wrath of God.\n\nWe believe that the Lord Jesus Christ has, by His suffering and death, made an atonement for the whole world so that whosoever will may be saved.\n\nWe believe that repentance towards God, faith in our Lord Jesus Christ and regeneration by the Holy Spirit are necessary to salvation.\n\nWe believe that we are justified by grace, through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ; and that he that believeth hath the witness in himself.\n\nWe believe that continuance in a state of salvation depends upon continued obedient faith in Christ.\n\nWe believe that it is the privilege of all believers to be wholly sanctified, and that their whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nWe believe in the immortality of the soul; in the resurrection of the body; in the general judgment at the end of the world; in the eternal happiness of the righteous; and in the endless punishment of the wicked.\n\nPractical implications of belief\n\nThe Army summarises the practical implications of its beliefs like this:\n\nAll people are sinners in need of salvation\n\nThe atonement made by Jesus avails for all\n\nConversion is an inward spiritual change wrought by the Holy Spirit\n\nSalvation from sin should lead to holiness of life\n\nThe ministry of all believers\n\nThe Salvation Army, like many other protestant churches believes that all believers have a ministry to \"proclaim the glorious gospel with urgency and in whatever way they can through their lives and through their words.\"\n\nThe Army teaches that believers live out their religious vocation through their service to the community.\n\nHoliness\n\nThe Salvation Army sees itself as a \"holiness movement\". It describes 'holiness' as 'Christlikeness' and says that Salvationists should:\n\n...earnestly strive to become wholly devoted and obedient to God, strong and upright, true, pure, kind, loving and humble - in one word, holy, like Jesus.\n\nSalvation Army\n\nThe military metaphor\n\nThe military metaphor of the Army has a long history in Christianity which sees the Church engaged in spiritual warfare. It was used in both the Old and the New Testaments of the Bible and many Christian writings and hymns use military imagery.\n\nThe Army uses military features such as uniforms, flags and ranks to identify, inspire and regulate its activities.\n\nBooth's wife Catherine put it like this:\n\nSoldiers of Christ must be abandoned to the war. They must be thoroughly committed to God's side; there can be no neutrals in this warfare.\n\nWhen the soldier enlists and takes the Queen's shilling, he ceases to be his own property, becoming the property of his country, going where he is sent, standing at any post to which he is assigned, even if it be at the cannon's mouth. He gives up the ways and comforts of civilians and goes forth with his life in his hand, in obedience to the will of his sovereign.\n\nIf I understand it, that is just what Jesus Christ demands of every one of his soldiers, and nothing less.\n\nCatherine Booth\n\nSacraments\n\nUnlike other Christian churches the Salvation Army does not recognise any sacraments, such as baptism or communion, as essential.\n\nThe Army does not teach that sacraments are wrong, but it believes that they are unnecessary, and may be unhelpful to some.\n\nEarly Salvationists were concerned that many Christians had become too attached to rituals as outward signs of spiritual grace. The Salvation Army places the emphasis on personal faith and on a spiritual relationship with God which doesn't depend on anything external.\n\nModern day Salvationists avoid sacraments for the following reasons:\n\nThe most a sacrament can be is a symbol\n\nMeaningful symbols can very easily become meaningless rituals\n\nSacraments can't change the heart and life of a person - that can only happen through faith in Jesus Christ\n\nJesus did not intend to create any sacramental ceremonies and there is little or nothing in the Bible to support sacraments\n\nSacraments have proved divisive in Christian history\n\nSacraments are an element of Christianity that may obstruct the conversion of those who have abandoned more formal churches\n\nCommunion\n\nBecause of this, the Salvation Army does not hold communion or any other form of Eucharistic service. However, it does not ban Salvationists from taking communion as a sign of fellowship when they attend another church. Salvationists believe that Jesus is present and can be remembered and celebrated at every meal, not just at a sacramental breaking of bread.\n\nBaptism\n\nThe Army has its own ceremony for becoming a member of the church (a Soldier) - the equivalent of baptism or confirmation - but the army ceremony does not involve water and is not sacramental.\n\nThe Army does not ban Salvationists from getting baptised in another church if they wish to do so.\n\nRelations with other churches and religions\n\nSalvationists treat other Christian churches with respect and pray that God may use them to bring sinners to himself.\n\nWilliam Booth expressed this by saying that Salvationists do not see it as their God-given task to protest against the doctrines or practices of other Christians, but to attest the gospel message about the saving work of Christ.\n\nThe Army takes part in activities to promote unity, understanding and practical co-operation between the various Christian bodies.\n\nIn many countries the Salvation Army co-exists with non-Christian faiths. It respects the sincerely-held beliefs of devout non-Christians, and does not regard conflict or bitter controversy as suitable means to making known the good news of Jesus.\n\nOrganisation\n\nParish level\n\nThe Salvation Army name for a parish is a Salvation Army Corps. Corps are led by officers, the Army equivalent of ministers.\n\nThose involved in a corps are divided into:\n\nofficers - ordained ministers of religion\n\nsoldiers - those who have accepted the Christian faith and live a Salvationist lifestyle\n\nadherents - people who make the Army their church but have not taken on the same degree of commitment as soldiers\n\npeople who share other aspects of the corps programme\n\nthose who simply attend Army meetings to worship\n\nOnly officers and soldiers are counted as full members of the Salvation Army.\n\nSalvation Army officers\n\nLeadership in the Army is provided by commissioned officers who are ordained ministers of religion.\n\nSalvation Army officers were not always regarded as ordained, but in 1978 the Army modified the commissioning ceremony to \"emphasise the fact that Salvation Army officers are ordained ministers of Christ and His gospel.\" This was confirmed in 2002.\n\nThe Army does not make a sharp division between sacred and secular - all believers are members of the priesthood - and it believes that all soldiers could theoretically carry out any ministry that an officer could, except where secular law rules otherwise.\n\nHowever the Army recognises that some individuals are called to particular types of ministry, and acknowledges this by commissioning some soldiers as officers to take on the ministries of preaching, evangelisation or administration, and to exercise authority within the church.\n\nThis division has never inhibited Salvationists from giving their all; the Army does not have an active clergy and a passive laity - it operates as a combined and effective spiritual force.\n\nSome distinguished Salvationists were never commissioned as officers, including Booth's wife Catherine, and the early Salvation Army activist, George Railton.\n\nOfficer training\n\nSalvationists accepted to become officers receive two years' residential training. In the UK this is at the William Booth College in Camberwell, South London.\n\nAt the end of the training period, cadets sign a covenant with God and The Salvation Army in private. This is followed by a public ceremony in which they are ordained, commissioned and appointed as ministers of the church.\n\nInternational leadership\n\nThe General directs Salvation Army operations throughout the world through the administrative departments of International Headquarters, based in London.\n\nThe High Council elects the General. It consists of all Commissioners on active service and of all other territorial commanders who have held the full rank of Colonel for two years or more.\n\nThe Chief of the Staff is appointed by the General and is the Army's second-in-command, who holds the rank of Commissioner, and acts as the Army's chief executive.\n\nZonal leadership\n\nThe world is divided into zonal territories, which are themselves divided into smaller, usually national, areas.\n\nNational leadership\n\nLeadership within a territory is delegated by the General to a territorial commander appointed by him.\n\nThe administration of Salvation Army work in the UK and Ireland is further devolved to 18 divisional headquarters.\n\nSymbols\n\nSalvation Army symbols\n\nThese are purely symbols - Salvationists do not regard them as sacred, but they treat them with great respect.\n\nThe motto - Blood and Fire\n\nThe motto emphasises key points of Salvation Army belief:\n\n'Blood' for the death of Jesus which saved Christians from sin\n\n'Fire' for the power of the Holy Spirit which helps Christians live holy lives.\n\nThe badge\n\nThe Salvation Army badge symbolises the important features of the faith.\n\nThe 'S' in the centre stands for salvation\n\nThe cross represents the death of Jesus\n\nThe swords represents the fight against sin\n\nThe surrounding shape of the sun represents the fire and light of the Holy Spirit\n\nThe crown reminds Salvationists that Heaven is the reward of all those who love and serve God\n\nThe flag\n\nThe flag consists of a blue border surrounding a red background, in the centre of which is a yellow star. The flag bears the Army's motto 'Blood and Fire'.\n\nThe blue border represents holiness - the holiness of God and the holy lives Christians are called to live\n\nRed is a reminder of Jesus' blood shed when he was crucified, and his death that freed humanity from sin\n\nThe yellow star represents the power of the Holy Spirit\n\nThe mercy seat\n\nThe mercy seat is found in every Salvation Army meeting hall. It's a bench at the front where people can kneel.\n\nThe mercy seat has two main uses.\n\nWhen a person decides to become a Christian they often make a public commitment by kneeling at the mercy seat during worship. However it is important to realise that the act at the mercy seat is a public statement that God has changed something in the believer's soul; it does not itself make any change in the believer.\n\nPeople who are already Christians also kneel at the mercy seat, either as a public demonstration that they are re-dedicating themselves to God, or in order to pray in a special way about a particular decision or problem affecting their lives.\n\nPeople can also kneel at the mercy seat as a simple act of worship.\n\nThe mercy seat is a very old idea, found first in the Old Testament, where it was the holy place where God's presence was believed to be and where he communicated with his people.\n\nSalvationists do not believe that the mercy seat is a piece of furniture with special spiritual properties; whenever and wherever a person meets in spirit with God, that is a 'mercy seat'.\n\nUniforms\n\nSalvation Army uniforms denote rank by different trimmings on the epaulets and/or collars of their uniforms.\n\nA soldier has plain black or blue epaulets. Officers have red felt patches on collar and epaulets and their rank is shown by silver stars and/or crest, e.g. a captain has two silver stars on his epaulets, a major has a silver crest.\n\nLocal officers are indicated by the initials on the sleeve of their uniform, eg CT - corps treasurer, YPSM - young people's sergeant-major.\n\nThe uniform is not intended to identify Salvationists as in any way better than other people.\n\nThe Army believes that wearing the uniform brings many benefits:\n\nIt identifies its wearer as a professing Christian\n\nIt identifies its wearer as a 'servant of all'\n\nIt is a visible invitation to others to seek the help in spiritual and social matters which a Salvationist can give\n\nIt reminds its wearer to act in a way worthy of their calling\n\nIt creates a feeling of comradeship with other wearers of the uniform\n\nIt allows a soldier to represent the Army whatever his or her errand may be\n\nLife-stage ceremonies\n\nDedications not Christenings\n\nThe Salvation Army does not have a christening ceremony - children undergo a ceremony of dedication instead.\n\nIn this ceremony parents thank God for the gift of their child and promise to provide a Christian upbringing. Salvationist parents also promise to bring up the child in a Salvationist lifestyle and with Salvationist standards.\n\nThis ceremony differs from Christening in two main ways:\n\nThe promises are made by the actual parents, not by godparents or sponsors\n\nThe ceremony does not make the child a Christian or a Salvationist; children make that choice for themselves when they are old enough\n\nThe ceremony\n\nThe dedication takes place during a normal Salvation Army meeting for worship.\n\nThanks are given to God for the new life.\n\nThe officer conducting the ceremony reminds the parents of the promises they are making and they agree to keep them. The promises are to care for the child and protect her or him from harmful things as far as possible.\n\nThe officer then takes the child in his or her arms and, praying for the child by its full name, asks God to bless the child and guide the family. People in the congregation are asked to encourage and help the child as he or she grows up.\n\nAfter the prayer, the child is given back to the parents. A dedication certificate is presented and the dedication register is signed.\n\nBecoming a junior soldier\n\nChildren can become junior soldiers from the age of seven. They sign a simple statement that they love God and have asked to be forgiven for their sins. They promise to try to follow the example of Jesus.\n\nA short course of Christian teaching is given. At a simple ceremony the child receives a badge and certificate of acceptance.\n\nBecoming a senior soldier\n\nThis initiates a person as a full soldier in the Salvation Army. It can take place at any time after the age of fifteen.\n\nThe spiritual meaning of this is similar to confirmation or baptism in other churches.\n\nThe person must:\n\nDemonstrate their personal Christian faith and way of life\n\nUndergo a short course of teaching and discussion\n\nAccept and sign the Articles of War\n\nthis is a document setting out the Salvationists' beliefs and promises\n\nAffirm and sign these promises at a simple public ceremony in which they stand under the Army flag and:\n\npublicly acknowledge their salvation from sin\n\nstate their belief in the Army's doctrines\n\npromise to live by the standards laid out in the Articles of War\n\nsign a copy of the Articles of War\n\nThis is followed by prayers which ask God to help the person keep these promises\n\nMarriage\n\nThe Salvationist wedding ceremony is very similar to any church wedding, but with some unique Salvation Army additions. For example:\n\nThe Salvation Army flag is prominently displayed, indicating that the marriage includes a spiritual commitment\n\nThe bride and groom may wear uniform if they are both uniformed Salvationists (though this is increasingly rare)\n\nWhen both bride and groom are Salvationists, they promise to support each other spiritually and in their work for the Army in addition to making the conventional marriage vows\n\nA band may provide music and/or a guard of honour\n\nAlcoholic drink may be provided at the reception, though the bride and groom, and any other Salvationists present, would not consume it\n\nOne question frequently asked is \"who can Salvationists marry?\" - and people are often surprised that the answer is \"anybody that the law permits\".\n\nSalvationists don't have to get married to other Salvationists (but very often they do); they don't even have to marry other Christians (although they almost always do).\n\nIn earlier days Salvation Army officers were only allowed to marry other officers if they wanted to continue their work. This is now changing and Salvation Army officers have more freedom in their choice of partner. However this will make little practical difference, as officers often choose to live out their ministry as a husband and wife partnership.\n\nFunerals\n\nSalvationists believe that when the physical body dies, the soul or spirit continues to exist in another dimension. This new dimension could be Heaven or 'glory' in which God is present, or hell which is the absence of God.\n\nSalvationist believe that those who have accepted God will go to Heaven, and so they use the phrase \"Promotion to Glory\" to refer to the death of a Christian.\n\nSalvationists may be buried or cremated.\n\nSalvation Army funerals have an atmosphere of joy and hope, since despite the sadness of losing a family member, friend or colleague, there is joy in the belief that the dead person is happy in a new existence with God. So instead of black the Army's funeral colour is white, and the flags which are walked to the graveside are draped with white ribbons.\n\nSoldiers attend funerals in uniform and may wear a white ribbon round the sleeve of their tunic.\n\nSalvation Army funeral traditions include:\n\nA cap, Bible and Salvation Army song book placed on the coffin\n\nA white ribbon at the top of the flagpole\n\nA brass band leading the cortège, though this is increasingly rare\n\nAn appeal to those present to be aware of the wisdom of accepting God\n\nWorship\n\nWorship\n\nSalvationists regard their whole life and being as an act of worship, but, of course, they meet regularly for worship.\n\nSalvation Army meetings are open to anyone - you don't have to be a Salvationist or even a Christian to attend.\n\nMeetings don't have a set order of service. They usually include plenty of hymns and songs, and there may be group or individual music items. Occasionally a dance or drama group may be used to help with the worship. Verses from the Bible are read in every meeting.\n\nMusic may be provided by the local Salvation Army band or by the choir (who are called the 'Songsters').\n\nAn officer usually leads the meeting and gives the 'address' (sermon), but other people can do both or may be invited to take part by praying, reading out verses of hymns or from the Bible, or by giving 'testimonies' in which they talk about their experience of God.\n\nPrayers are not formal or liturgical, but more often spontaneous and from the heart.\n\nMusic has been important to the Army from its early days, when it was a powerful evangelical tool; not just to attract a crowd to hear the preacher, but as a way of helping people to experience faith in a more embracing way than words could on their own.\n\nSocial work\n\nSocial work\n\nThe Salvation Army is famous for its works to help the poor and needy. Members pride themselves on being \"doers of the word and not hearers only\" and emphasise rolling up their sleeves and getting on with it.\n\nThe Salvation Army helps believers and non-believers equally. Practical care is never offered - or refused - on the basis of belief. The Army hopes that those it helps will become Christians, but it doesn't require them to do so.\n\nThe Army's social work is a religious activity. Members of the Army are inspired by their belief in a loving and caring God to show their love for humanity and their practical response to human need. In this they follow the teachings of Jesus.\n\nI was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was in prison and you came to see me\n\nMatthew 25:35-36\n\nSocial work or spiritual work\n\nThe Salvation Army sees no conflict between spiritual and social ministry. It seeks to serve people so as to satisfy both the spiritual and social dimensions of their needs. The Army believes that this approach shows the very essence of the Gospel.\n\nSalvationists affirm the following:\n\nEveryone has a right to the basic necessities of life:\n\nfood\n\nclothing\n\nshelter\n\neducation\n\nhealth care\n\nsafe environment\n\neconomic security\n\nproductive work\n\njust wages and benefits\n\ndecent working conditions\n\nThe Army believes that these rights impose corresponding duties on each person (but only if they are able to accept such duties):\n\nto work\n\nto provide for the needs of their families\n\nto contribute to the broader society\n\nThe Salvation Army works to change structures in society that perpetuate economic injustice. For example, the Salvation Army campaigned against government proposals to increase the opportunities for gambling.\n\nWilliam Booth believed that fighting for social change was vital to achieve his vision. When speaking his social work plan, he often used the metaphor of an ambulance at the foot of the precipice of human failure, noting that he also intended to erect a fence at the top.\n\nThe Salvation Army has a tradition of not giving up on anyone. Members believe that however low a person has sunk God continues to love them, and that God's grace can redeem anyone.\n\nHomelessness\n\nIn the UK alone, the Salvation Army has 50 centres which help people without homes and provide over 3,000 beds. They are full almost every night.\n\nThe ultimate aim of the programme is to help homeless people to live independently in homes of their own, and all the centres have case workers and resettlement workers to help their clients achieve this.\n\nThe Army doesn't just provide beds: many centres distribute blankets and sleeping bags to those without homes, and offer drop-in centres where people can find warmth, food and friendship - as well as help in finding somewhere to live.\n\nOther services include lunch clubs, washing and bathing facilities, and food parcels.\n\nThe Salvation Army also organises soup runs in city areas. In London, the Salvation Army's Eagle Project co-ordinates an extensive soup run provision and many other volunteer-based activities.\n\nAddiction\n\nThe Salvation Army has 60 social programme centres which provide residential accommodation and rehabilitation for people with substance misuse problems. These are part of the National Addiction Service.\n\nThe Army has created an integrated, nationwide monitoring scheme providing a unique epidemiological profile of alcohol and drug taking in the UK.\n\nYouth work\n\nAs well as the over 300 Senior and Junior Youth Clubs run by Salvation Army corps around the country there are a number of specialist initiatives:\n\nChildren's Community Homes provide residential care for children placed in them by Local Authority Social Services\n\nAdolescent centres help young men to make the transition from residential care or homelessness to living in the community\n\nFamily Centres support parents to help prevent family breakdown\n\nLow-cost holidays are provided for young people who would otherwise not have the opportunity to go away\n\nA Child Protection Officer oversees all child protection issues. This includes on-going child protection training for staff\n\nThe Eden project\n\nThis is a church based youth project operating in an area where high unemployment leads to high crime, illegal drug use and low morale amongst residents.\n\nThe project involves Christian workers moving into the area to live and work alongside local young people as positive role models in the community.\n\nWork with the elderly\n\nThe Army operates a wide range of services for older people:\n\nSheltered flats\n\n18 residential homes\n\nHome care services\n\nOver-60s lunch clubs\n\nDisability work\n\nThe Salvation Army Fellowship of Endeavour (SAFE) is open to all children and adults together with their carers, whether they are members of The Salvation Army or not. This fellowship has about 1,000 members and works to works to cultivate a right attitude between the public and people with mental or physical disabilities and their families.\n\nPrison work\n\nThe majority of prisons in the UK receive regular visits from a Salvation Army chaplain. The Salvation Army Care and Support for Prisoners' Families Group offers practical and spiritual support by visiting families of prisoners, assessing needs and trying to help.\n\nDisaster and emergency work\n\nThe Salvation Army maintains a number of purpose-built emergency mobile units which are equipped with resources which would be needed at a major incident such as a fire, flood, bombing, chemical incident, train or plane crash.\n\nThese units carry supplies of food, blankets and first aid and other equipment.\n\nFamily tracing service\n\nThis service was established as long ago as 1885. The aim is to restore (or to sustain) family relationships by locating relatives who for various reasons (a deliberate break or otherwise) have become out of touch.\n\nAround 5,000 enquiries are received each year and approximately 85% end in success. Over 20,000 family members now enjoy restored relationships as a result of enquiries carried out by the Family Tracing Service in the UK.\n\nEthics\n\nSalvation Army ethics\n\nSalvationists are generally conservative in their ethical thinking. Since the Army devotes much of its energy to working in difficult social and ethical areas it is able to claim that its ethical doctrines are tested in practice every minute of every day.\n\nAll Salvationist ethics rely on Jesus for their authority. Their essence is captured in phrases like 'following Jesus' and 'the imitation of Christ'.\n\nPromises\n\nEvery Salvationist makes the following ethical promises:\n\nI will uphold Christian integrity in every area of my life, allowing nothing in thought, word or deed that is unworthy, unclean, untrue, profane, dishonest or immoral.\n\nI will maintain Christian ideals in all my relationships with others; my family and neighbours, my colleagues and fellow salvationists, those to whom and for whom I am responsible, and the wider community.\n\nI will uphold the sanctity of marriage and of family life. I will be a faithful steward of my time and gifts, my money and possessions, my body, my mind and my spirit, knowing that I am accountable to God.\n\nI will abstain from alcoholic drink, tobacco, the non-medical use of addictive drugs, gambling, pornography, the occult and all else that could enslave the body or spirit.\"\n\nSalvation Army promises\n\nPurity\n\n... to be pure in soul signifies deliverance from all and everything which the Lord shows you to be opposed to His Holy Will.\n\nWilliam Booth, Purity of Heart\n\nThe Salvation Army expects its members to live according to the \"values of the Kingdom of God and not the values of the world.\"\n\nSalvationists try to avoid \"all impurity, including unclean conversation and the reading of any obscene book or paper\" as well as pornographic pictures, films and exhibitions of any kind, or similar television and radio programmes.\n\nBodily ethics\n\nThe Salvation Army has historically required total abstinence from alcoholic drink from all its soldiers and officers.\n\nSocial drinking to please a host or hostess or a business associate should be ruled out. Alcoholic beverages in any form should not be tolerated within Salvation Army circles.\n\nHowever, Salvationists are not forbidden to mix socially with drinkers, and War Cry is regularly sold in pubs.\n\nMembers of the Army also abstain from \"tobacco, the non-medical use of addictive drugs, gambling, pornography, the occult, and all else that could enslave the body or spirit.\"\n\nSuch things are seen as endangering and degrading the physical, moral, and spiritual welfare of all those who become involved with them.\n\nEuthanasia\n\nThe Salvation Army believes in the sanctity of human life and so regards euthanasia as morally wrong.\n\nAssisted suicide is also regarded as morally wrong.\n\nHowever the Army defines euthanasia strictly, as a deliberate act causing the intentional death of a person in order to relieve that person's suffering.\n\nThe Army does not regard either of the following as euthanasia or as morally wrong:\n\nusing drugs to adequately control the pain of a dying person, even if the secondary effect may result in shortened life\n\nwithholding or withdrawing medical treatment that only prolongs the dying process\n\nThe Army accepts that living wills or advance health care directives can be useful.\n\nSexual ethics and marriage\n\nThe Salvation Army recognizes that the battle between flesh and spirit is never easy, but believes that the sex drive is designed by God to lead to the highest expression of human love only within the holy estate of matrimony, and that when it is expressed outside of that relationship, it will inevitably lead to misery of self and others.\n\nSalvation Army\n\nThe Salvation Army holds to the Christian ideals of chastity before marriage and fidelity within the marriage relationship.\n\nIt believes that believes that sex and its proper use is a gift, created, ordained and blessed by God and intended to find expression only within the context of a loving marriage relationship.\n\nThe Army regards marriage as the voluntary and loving union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.\n\nSalvationist cannot remain soldiers if they sexually cohabit with a person of the opposite sex to whom they are not married. They must either marry or separate.\n\nSalvationists cannot remain soldiers if they are involved in marital infidelity, deliberate promiscuity, a criminal sexual offence or any misconduct of a sexually deviant kind.\n\nHomosexuality\n\nThe Salvation Army believes that homosexual Christians must live celibate lives, since the Bible forbids sexual intimacy between members of the same sex.\n\nThe Army does not accept same-sex unions as equal to, or as an alternative to, heterosexual marriage.\n\nThe Salvation Army opposes any discrimination against homosexuals, and accepts as members homosexuals who will abide by the principle that sexual intimacy is only acceptable within marriage.\n\nHomosexual practices unrenounced render a person unacceptable as a Salvation Army soldier, in the same way as heterosexual acts of immorality.\n\nDivorce\n\nThe Army recognises that some marriages fail and is willing to help couples facing such a situation. Where remarriage could lead to the healing of emotional wounds, the Army permits its officers to perform a marriage ceremony for a divorced person.\n\nContraception\n\nThe Salvation Army believes that contraception is morally acceptable.\n\nIt encourages the use of birth control methods that are contraceptive (i.e. that prevent conception) versus the use of methods that are abortifacient (i.e. that prevent implantation after fertilisation).\n\nAbortion\n\nThe Salvation Army believes that abortion is morally wrong, and recommends that unwanted pregnancies should be continued to birth.\n\nIt is opposed to abortion as a means of birth control, family planning, sex selection or for any reason of mere convenience to avoid the responsibility for conception.\n\nIt deplores society's ready acceptance of abortion, which it believes reflects insufficient concern for vulnerable persons, including the unborn.\n\nHowever it accepts that that there may be situations where those involved want to consider abortion; such situations need much prayer and careful thought.\n\nIn cases of proven rape or legally defined incest an abortion may be justified because of the extent to which rape and incest violate the whole person. Termination of a pregnancy may also be justified where reliable diagnostic procedures determine that a foetal abnormality is present which is incompatible with life other than brief post-natal survival or where there is total absence of cognitive function.\n\nWhen an abortion takes place, The Salvation Army continues to show love and compassion and offers its services and fellowship to those involved.\n\nReproductive ethics\n\nArtificial insemination and in vitro fertilisation are acceptable when the sperm and ova of a husband and wife are used. The Salvation Army strongly advises against the use of donors because of theological, legal, moral, social, psychological, and ethical complications and implications.\n\nThe Salvation Army advises against surrogate motherhood.\n\nStem cell research\n\nThe Salvation Army has chosen to be neutral in the debate over stem-cell research.\n\nDebt\n\nDebt is seen as a great evil. Salvationists should avoid getting into debt and only accept credit transactions (including mortgages) after making sure that they will be able to repay on time. They are expected to resist any temptation to live above their means.\n\nDiscrimination\n\nThe Salvation Army recognises that all human beings are made in God's image and are equal in intrinsic value.\n\nFrom the earliest days the Army has given women and men equality of opportunity; every rank and service is open to both sexes.\n\nAll Salvation Army worship services are open to everyone and all Salvation Army social welfare services are provided on a non-discriminatory basis.\n\nSalvationists are explicitly instructed to avoid class discrimination:\n\nThe Salvation Army must not become so much of a middle-class movement that it forgets 'the rock whence it is hewn'. It is called to proclaim salvation to all classes, but its special glory should be its concern for and its ability to appeal to the lowest and most forgotten, and to be their champion in every respect.\n\nSalvation Army"
