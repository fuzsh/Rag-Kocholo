If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not of this realm.” - John 18:36\n\nHello again, beloved! Let’s continue our study of “Baptist Distinctives”. These are particular beliefs and practices that distinguish us as Baptists from other Christian denominations. Thus far in this series, we have highlighted 3 such distinctives:\n\nBiblical Authority - Baptists recognize the Bible as the sole and final authority for all aspects of Christian life. It is inspired, infallible, and inerrant. No other source of authority, including any human opinion or church tradition, exceeds or even equals the Bible.\n\nAutonomy of the Local Church - Each local Baptist church is fully autonomous, which means it is self-governing and self-supporting. Individual congregations operate under the Lordship of Christ alone. There are no governing authorities outside of or over the local church.\n\nTwo Offices - Baptists recognize 2 church offices, namely pastors and deacons. Pastors provide spiritual leadership for each local church and serve as it’s bishop (or overseer), lead elder, and shepherd. Deacons serve to meet the congregation's physical needs.\n\nAs you can see, much of our previous discussion has focused on ecclesiology - the structure and practices of the church. Baptist churches operate quite differently than many other major Christian denominations. Some believers feel that the Baptist style of worship is too informal or casual, while others find it to be liberating and sincere.\n\nIn this morning’s message, we will talk about religious liberty and the separation of Church and State. The First Amendment of The United States Constitution, which was heavily fashioned by Baptist thinking, succinctly expresses our position on these issues. It reads, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof”. Let's explore what this means.\n\nI. NO STATE CHURCH (Mark 12:17, Philippians 3:20)\n\nThe civil government has no rightful authority to establish a State religion, nor to favor one eccesiastical group over another. Unfortunately, throughout most of the church age secular civil leaders and religious church officials worked together in a formal and mutually-beneficial partnership to advance their respective goals. During these centuries numerous nations, kingdoms, and empires (especially in Europe) illegitimately designated a particular denomination or faith to serve as the official religion of the State. Mandates were issued and laws enforced that required allegiance to the sanctioned church, often leading to the harsh oppression and vile mistreatment of those who held other “non-approved” beliefs. In fact, many of the early colonists fled to the New World in hopes of escaping this widespread religious persecution. America’s founders wanted to end this unhealthy intermingling between the Church and State once and for all.\n\nThe Bible warns the righteous not to be “unequally yoked” with nonbelievers (2 Corinthians 6:14). If a pair of oxen are yoked together, and one is significantly faster or stronger than the other, they will go around in circles and get nothing done. In similar fashion, Christians should be extremely cautious about entering into binding relationships with lost people, including marriages, business endeavors, and the like. Such unions are a recipe for disaster. Applying this same principle on a larger scale, the Church should purposefully keep itself separate from the State, realizing that entanglement between them will predictably and invariably lead to corruption, impurity, and abuse within the Church.\n\nII. INDIVIDUAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY (Galatians 5:1, Romans 14:22)\n\nThe civil government has no legitimate authority to prohibit the free exercise of religion. All people have the right to worship God (or not to worship Him) and to practice their faith (or not practice any faith) as they so choose, provided that their actions do not infringe upon the inalienable rights of others. This is the essence of religious liberty. Baptists have always defended this freedom, even for those with whom they disagree. The State should strive to protect the Church and its pursuits, not limit or restrict them.\n\nJesus repeatedly taught about the clear distinction between earthly kingdoms and the Kingdom of God. They coexist side-by-side. He explained that individuals have a responsibility to both. While all Christians should practice good citizenship and abide by the laws of their civil government whenever possible, their first and highest devotion is to God. Jesus aptly described His disciples as being “in this world, but not of this world” (John 17:14-16). Following these Biblical teachings, Baptists consider themselves as dual citizens who have separate and distinct obligations to both the Church and the State.\n\nIII. THE CHURCH’S FAILURE (Ezekiel 23:29b, Luke 24:29)\n\nDuring Old Testament times, the people of God were collectively known as Israel. Over the centuries, they rebelled against the LORD in several ways. They foolishly chased after the false gods of other heathen nations. In times of desperation they sought the military and economic assistance of other pagan nations. They even chose for themselves a human king and set-up a monarchy. Again and again the people of Israel placed their faith in worldly leaders, institutions, and might (which is to say, the State) rather than relying on God. The LORD compared their unfaithfulness to prostitution and strongly commended it. The New Testament church would be wise to remember and learn from Israel's mistakes.\n\nThe Church should not resort to civil powers to do its work, nor should it compromise itself to the world’s system. The mission of the Church can only be accomplished through spiritual means. It requires the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit. The State is not properly equipped to do this. Nevertheless, the Church has a long history of delegating its responsibilities to the State. This has greatly contributed to the vast expansion and overreach of the government (and human secularism), while simultaneously diminishing the influence and effectiveness of the Church. To a large degree, the decline of Christianity has resulted from its dependence upon and alliance with the State.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBaptists strongly support the separation of Church and State and the principle of religious liberty. The government should not interfere with or infringe upon the peaceful worship and benevolent ministry of the Church, but rather should concern itself strictly with civil matters. t should reward those who do good and punish those who do evil. Furthermore, it should ensure that all people are free to worship as they choose.\n\nChristians who wish to engage in politics or public service should do so knowing that it is not the State’s job to enforce the will of the Church. Instead, it is the Church’s responsibility (and that of individual believers) to be the salt and light of the earth. Christians should set an example that encourages sinners to voluntarily submit themselves to God, rather than imposing His will upon them through the means of human authority. This lost world will never be won to Christ through the auspices and efforts of the State, even when well-intentioned."
