        "text": "The Separate Baptists in Christ are a group of Baptists found in Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Florida and North Carolina dating back to an association formed in 1758 in North Carolina and Virginia.\n\nToday this group consists of approximately 100 churches. They believe in the infallibility of the Bible, the divine ordinances of the Lord's Supper, feetwashing, baptism and that those who endureth to the end shall be saved.\n\nThe Separate Baptists are Arminian in doctrine, rejecting both the doctrines of predestination and eternal security of the believer.\n\nAt the 1991 General Association, an additional article of doctrine was adopted. \"We believe that at Christ's return in the clouds of heaven all Christians will meet the Lord in the air, and time shall be no more,\" thus leaving no time for a literal one thousand year reign. Seven associations comprise the General Association of Separate Baptists."
