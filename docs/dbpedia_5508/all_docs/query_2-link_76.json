        "text": "Seventh Day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists Compared\n\nSome people confuse Seventh Day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists because they have similar names. The groups have some things in common, but there are differences in their history, teachings, and how they are organized. Seventh Day Baptists began in England in the 1600s. Similar groups existed even earlier. The first Seventh Day Baptist church in North America was organized in 1671. Early Seventh Day Baptists discarded traditions that were not supported by Scripture. They restored Bible doctrines that others groups had abandoned. Seventh Day Baptists emphasize five central truths and endured persecution in Great Britain and North America because of these teachings:\n\nSalvation is God’s gift to those who believe in Christ’s atoning sacrifice.\n\nThe Bible must be the Christian’s only authority for doctrine and practice.\n\nGod gave the moral law (the Ten Commandments) for all people in all time periods.\n\nThe seventh-day Sabbath is part of God’s moral law. No human authority has the right to change the day of rest and worship.\n\nGovernment should not have authority over the church (“separation of church and state”).\n\nSeventh-day Adventists developed during the “Great Awakening” revival movement that swept through America in the 1830’s and 1840’s. The revival was led by William Miller, an American Baptist minister, whose prediction of the second coming of Christ was incorrect and resulted in the “Great Disappointment”. Among the disappointed followers were the future leaders of Seventh-day Adventism. Their reinterpretation of the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation were accepted by many Millerites. James and Ellen G. White, as well as other early Adventist leaders, preached this new message. Much of it was based on Mrs. White’s own personal visions, which were soon accepted as prophetic guidance. The Sabbath truth was brought by Seventh Day Baptists and added to the Adventist message. Mrs. White wrote many books, often borrowing from other authors as was common in the 19th century. Her visions were claimed to resolve various doctrinal issues resulting in her being accepted as the authority in biblical interpretation for her church. The simultaneous belief in Sola Scriptura (scripture is the final authority) and the prophetess gift of Ellen G. White has led to contradictions in practice of both Seventh-day Adventist ministry and laity."
