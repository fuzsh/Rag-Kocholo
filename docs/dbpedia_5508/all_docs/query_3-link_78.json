        "text": "I’m getting married soon. It’s been a long time coming. We have chosen to be married using the Marriage Rites of the Baptist Union of Australia.\n\nMy not-so-Catholic-anymore fiancé and I met twenty years ago, studying history at university. For almost two decades, our separate lives unfolded in uncannily similar ways. We found faith. We studied theology. We got married (to other people). We each cobbled together a living — one in hospitality, the other in retail — while we struggled in the precarious academic underclass. We got divorced. We each continued to write and speak about history, literature, religion, and theology. Now we both work in theological education. I am all but ordained as a Baptist minister. Our history degrees have set us up for life, in more ways than one.\n\nWe didn’t choose the Baptist Marriage Rites because either of us holds any “traditional” view of marriage — which, after all, is a modern legal concept. In fact, we’re getting married when we don’t even agree on what marriage is. For him, marriage is a sacrament; for me, it’s an ordinance. It’s theological hair-splitting, but whole denominations have been formed, and people martyred, for our right to hold such differing views.\n\nSo it was affronting, and rather devastating, to be a part of the Baptist Assembly that over the weekend blithely voted for the Baptist Association of New South Wales and the ACT to cease to be Baptist. Was it over something like the filioque? Did we suddenly realise we’re all a bit semi-pelagian? No, it was over the institution of marriage.\n\nMy fiancé and I chose the Baptist Marriage Rites because distinctively Baptist concepts like freedom of conscience, the separation of church and state, and the priesthood of all believers are more important to us than our differences in how we understand marriage. I thought that my denomination also believed our shared Baptist distinctives to be more important than our differences on how we understand marriage. I was wrong.\n\nAt what some of us have been calling “the Red Assembly”, 60 per cent of my Baptist brethren voted for motions that would make us Brethren, not Baptist. 60 per cent of a movement that exists because of our bloody and hard-won right to dissent, voted to remove our right to dissent — most without even recognising it (or the irony). 60 per cent of my church family voted to disaffiliate churches and disaccredit ministers who do not support (where support means “approve of” and “not act contrary to”) a position statement on marriage. This power over ministers is unprecedented. Each of these points has significant ramifications on its own. Together — one way or another — they mark the end of our Baptist Association.\n\nB.A.P.T.I.S.T.\n\nI recognise I need to elaborate on what makes us Baptist, because if Baptists don’t seem to know, then I can’t assume everyone else does. Baptist distinctives differentiate us from other Christian denominations. When I was a student, as luck or providence would have it, I had the privilege of being taught by the church history lecturer who quite literally wrote the book on Baptist governance. Later, when it was my turn to teach church history, I used this (forgive me, terribly twee) mnemonic device to help my students remember our Baptist distinctives:\n\n1.Bible — the Bible is the ultimate source of all essential spiritual truth. We don’t need creeds or confessions. Scripture “is the only sufficient, certain and infallible rule of all saving knowledge, faith and obedience.” — The 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith.\n\n2.Autonomy of the Local Church — each Baptist church is autonomous, or self-governing. No (religious) council, hierarchy or organisation outside the local church can impose their will upon it. (Colossians 1:18; 2 Corinthians 8:1-5, 19, 23)\n\n3.Priesthood of all Believers — all believers have “equal access” to God. No mediator is required between God and God’s people. We can each pray and study scripture for ourselves. (1 Peter 2:5, 9; Revelation 5:9, 10)\n\n4.Two Ordinances — local churches practice two ordinances: believer’s baptism (baptism by full immersion) and communion (the Lord’s Supper). (Matthew 28:19, 20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-32)\n\n5.Individual Freedom of Conscience — each of us has the freedom to choose what we believe to be right. Assent to any belief, against our will or conscience, cannot be forced. We are free to dissent. (Romans 14:5, 12; 2 Corinthians 4:2; Titus 1:9)\n\n6.Separation of Church and State — church and government have separate spheres of operation. Neither should attempt to control the other. (Matthew 22:15-22; Acts 15:17-29; Romans 13:1-7)\n\n7.Two Offices — the two offices of pastor and deacon exist within the local church, but not as a hierarchy over it. (1 Timothy 3:1-13; Acts 20:17-38; Philippians 1:1)\n\n8.Sign of Salvation — believer’s baptism is a public sign of personal faith and identifying with Christ. Church membership (being the body of Christ) is by believer’s baptism. (Acts 2:41-47; 1 Corinthians 12:12; 2 Corinthians 6:14; Ephesians 4:3)\n\nOf course, this isn’t exhaustive or definitive. That wouldn’t be Baptist.\n\nA multiplying magisterium\n\nBack to the Red Assembly. There was a long, complicated lead up which resulted in twenty-two separate but contingent motions to be voted on. The motions built towards establishing a means for disaffiliating churches and disaccrediting ministers that might not “support” our basic doctrines and statements of belief. Except, our constitution already had a mechanism for this. The cultural crucible that brought these association-altering, simmering tensions to a boiling dénouement, was same-sex marriage. Except, we already had a 2004 statement on Marriage and Sexuality. And legally, Baptist ministers can’t perform same-sex marriage, regardless of whether we want to.\n\nSo, why were we voting? Over three years ago, five (and then later, four) churches gave notice of motions which were aimed at making the process for how churches and ministers might confirm support for the Basic Doctrines, Objects and Values of the Association more robust. In response, the Association held meetings, created a Taskforce, convened a Special Assembly in February last year, and an online portal was set up to receive submissions. Despite these efforts, confusion reigned at the Red Assembly. My own church, though we were in broad agreement, took four hours to discuss and make sure we understood each of the motions.\n\nIn short, a handful of our more conservative churches no longer wish to associate with a handful of our more progressive churches. It’s as simple as that. And as complicated as Motion 5:\n\nThat the Association establish Association Position Statements, as agreed by Assembly from time to time, which are then included in the Association’s Constitution.\n\nAn ever-expanding list of externally imposed “statements” which ministers and churches must “support” — in other words, a multiplying magisterium — is prescriptive, contrary to our own Baptist distinctives (see 1, 2 ,3, and 5 above), and makes us more Catholic than it does Baptist (and bears an uncomfortable resemblance to the Exclusive Brethren from 1950s onwards). Enshrining these “position statements” — whatever they may be — in our constitution is legalism and poor governance. Position statements are what we may think or recommend about contemporary social issues, like climate change or gambling, for example. Position statements should not require universal and uniform support and they categorically do not belong in a constitution.\n\nHow not to be Baptist\n\nWhy did we suddenly depart from history and make a new category of statements we must support? To put it bluntly, because Baptists don’t have a doctrine of marriage. It’s the Anglicans and the Catholics that have a doctrine of marriage. Which brings us to the elephant in the room. What “position” on marriage did 60 per cent of us vote in?\n\nMarriage is a covenant relationship ordained by God as a lifelong faithful union of one man and one woman. Sexual intimacy outside such a marriage relationship is incompatible with God’s intention for us as his people.\n\nThe statement sounds more (or should that be Moore?) Sydney Anglican than it does Baptist. My church, along with many others, could not in good conscience vote for this motion. We are in a position of dissent. Until the Red Assembly, this was permissible. But now, ministers can be disaccredited and churches can be disaffiliated for not “supporting” (approving of) not only this position statement, but other future position statements. You’d be forgiven for thinking that expelling members for not toeing the party line is Baptist, thanks to the Southern Baptist Convention, but in fact, this makes us more Brethren than Baptist.\n\nThe Brethren church split into the Open Brethren and Exclusive Brethren because of who they would and would not associate with. Sound familiar? The Open Brethren have a congregational polity (like Baptists) and the Exclusive Brethren have a connexional polity (like Methodists). In connexionalism, denominational concerns supersede the concerns of the local church. This is why I’m Baptist, not Uniting or Methodist.\n\nBut (irony of ironies) 60 per cent of us voted for “position statements” which move us from congregationalism to connexionalism, because they didn’t want to associate (be in connection) with people and churches who think differently to them. And 60 per cent of us voted for motions that would see those who think differently — not on doctrine or statements of belief or our Baptist values, but on “position statements” — disciplined. This would make us Anabaptist, Exclusive Brethren or Mennonite, not Baptist.\n\nThe 40 per cent who voted against the motions, did so for a variety of reasons. I dissent for more reasons than I can fit in a think piece. But here’s what I will say:\n\nTraditional Christian sexual ethics have over-emphasised the form of sexual activity, i.e. the who, what, when and where and given little emphasis to the context of the sexual activity, i.e. the power balance in the relationship and the presence or absence of consent to sexual acts.\n\nThis quotation isn’t from recent debates, but a report on church and domestic abuse from over thirty years ago: A Pastoral Report to the Churches on Sexual Violence Against Women and Children of the Church Community. Perhaps we could have a statement on marriage that isn’t reduced to sexual intimacy, with a far less impoverished sexual ethic — one that remembers God’s desire for us and our desire for each other — rather than policing (what people think about) what people may or may not do with their genitals?\n\nBrethren, not Baptist\n\nWhat I find most troubling about all of this does not come from the fact that I am passionately, stubbornly, distinctively Baptist. It is because I am an historian and educator. We have forgotten our history, we have showed a disturbing lack of critical thought, and we have failed to consider future consequences. I do not doubt that the vast majority of the 60 per cent had good intentions. But good intentions do not ensure good outcomes. What we needed was good governance. Good intentions hurt good people. What we needed was good policy, not policing beliefs and behaviour. Nobody wants the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nOr Spanish Second Republic-inspired thought-policing. Which reminds me, I forgot to mention why I’m in the process of being ordained. To be ordained is to be set apart for service. I serve in theological academia. I have a responsibility to the denomination who accredits me, and my local church who ordains me, to think well, to think for myself, and to help others to think well and for themselves.\n\nSo, if the Baptist Association of New South Wales and the ACT wants to disaccredit me for thinking, for dissenting over category errors and logical fallacies, over eschewing history and Baptist identity, over a reductionistic view of marriage, for exercising freedom of conscience, thought, and interpretation, then they can pry my accreditation from my cold, dead hands. People were burnt at the stake and drowned in lakes for Baptist beliefs and practices. Maybe next time we vote, we can at least do them the honour of remembering what it means to be Baptist."
