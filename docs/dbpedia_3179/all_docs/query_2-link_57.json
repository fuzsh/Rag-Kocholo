What I can say is I was happily sharing industry insights alongside industry leaders like Chanel Parson, of Southern California Edison (SCE), Ahmad Choukair of Hitachi Energy, and Chris King of Siemens. Our panel focused on the critical role of strengthening Supply Chains for Infrastructure and in advancing the clean transportation sector. The panel ran close to two hours! (when it was scheduled for one) and had great audience participation. Here's some key takeaways from our discussion: üîåDue to the need for higher power transformers and switchgear (as well as costs associated with them), which we all know carry long lead times (understated), the development of Innovative Technologies such as the implementation of Medium Voltage (MV) distribution and Solid-State Transformers are pivotal to the transition to #MCS. These technologies not only enhance the efficiency of EV charging infrastructure but also address long-standing challenges in the supply chain and deployment processes. ü§ù Collaboration is Key! Building strong relationships with utilities, manufacturers, and distributors is essential. In our example, Southern California Edison (SCE) proactive approach in partnering with stakeholders to streamline the deployment of EV infrastructure is a testament to this. Their efforts in helping to standardize equipment for EV Charging and bulk ordering have significantly reduced lead times and project costs. üîß Providing turnkey solutions can make EV infrastructure deployment easier and actually more affordable. By offering comprehensive packages that include everything from design to installation, Charge America, LLC. can accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles of all kinds from light to heavy duty, and ensure a smoother transition for all stakeholders. üöÄ Future-Proofing the Grid by planning for future needs is as important as addressing current demands. The integration of advanced technologies and strategic partnerships will help us build a resilient and scalable EV infrastructure that meets the growing needs of the industry. Check out WattEV, Inc. Bakersfield site as an example! Leading the solar and energy storage #PACT for Megawatt Charging. Honestly, it was an honor to discuss these topics and more at ACT Expo and all the people I met. By working together, we can drive the future of clean transportation and make a significant impact on our environment and communities. Let's keep pushing the boundaries of innovation and collaboration in the EV industry! #ACTExpo2024 #CleanTransportation #EVCharging #Innovation #Collaboration #Sustainability #ElectricVehicles #MCS #J3271\n\nNavigating Auto Aftermarket Challenges with Solutions The automotive aftermarket industry faces challenges, but the Auto Maintenance & Repair Expo (AMR) in China stands as a key player in providing innovative solutions.

To this end, Eurovent together with seven leading European associations, has drawn up a manifesto for clean indoor air quality and is calling on the EU Parliament to adopt European legislation with binding limit values. The aim: good indoor air quality must become a fundamental human right. As experts for air filters in ventilation and air conditioning systems, we support this initiative because the facts speak for themselves: ‚û°Ô∏èWe spend more than 90 % of our time indoors ‚û°Ô∏èThe air there is up to five times worse than outside ‚û°Ô∏èAccording to the WHO, 154,000 people died prematurely in Europe in 2019 as a result of poor indoor air quality It's time to give indoor air quality the same attention as outdoor air quality. We offer solutions so that clean indoor air is no longer a luxury.
