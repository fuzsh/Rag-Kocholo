Rounding out the group are piano, saxophone, trombone, congas, and timbales.\n\nA native of Dallas, Chavez began Arco Kemao—literally \"burnt bow\"—to honor salsa traditions and to help create some new ones. The group includes students from Korea, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the continental U.S., many of whom grew up with Latin music, and others who simply could not keep away once they'd heard it.\n\nJuan Chavez y Arco Kemao perform at 11:00 a.m. on the festival's Latin Jazz Stage, at Post and Market streets, and again that night at the Fairmont Hotel, from 9:00 p.m. to 12 a.m. On Sunday at 10:00 a.m., the group will give a youth master class on salsa rhythms and the use of strings at Camera 3, located at the corner of 2nd and Fernando streets.\n\nJuan P.
