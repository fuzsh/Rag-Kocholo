        "text": "History\n\nFurther information on the early history of the area: Haidian District\n\nChen Chunxian envisioned Zhongguancun, which then became a well-known technology hub 30 years later. Chunxian, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), conceived of a Silicon Valley in China following a government-sponsored trip to Boston and Silicon Valley, United States.[2]\n\nZhongguancun became known as \"Electronics Avenue\" (simplified Chinese: çµå­ä¸æ¡è¡; traditional Chinese: é»å­ä¸æ¢è¡; pinyin: DiÃ nzÇ YÄ«tiÃ¡ojiÄ) from the early 1980s on, due to its information technology markets along a central, crowded street.[3]\n\nZhongguancun was recognized by the central government of China in 1988, and officially named \"Beijing High-Technology Industry Development Experimental Zone\". In 1999, Zhongguancun became the \"Zhongguancun Science & Technology Zone\", with seven parks: Haidian, Fengtai, Changping, Electronics City (in Chaoyang), Yizhuang, Desheng, and Jianxiang. The original Zhongguancun became known as Haidian Park of the Zhongguancun Zone.[4]\n\nNotable companies and landmarks\n\nHailong Market, Guigu Market, Taipingyang Market, Dinghao Market and Kemao Market are prominent IT and electronics technology bazaars, noted for \"shops with a shop\", where bargaining is the norm.[1] According to the 2004 Beijing Statistical Yearbook, there were over 12,000 high-tech enterprises operating in Zhongguancun's seven parks, with 489,000 technicians employed.\n\nThe most notable companies that grew up in Zhongguancun are Stone Group, Founder Group, and Lenovo Group, each founded during 1984 to 1985. Stone was the first successful technology company to be operated by private individuals outside of the government of China. Founder is a technology company that spun off Peking University. Lenovo Group spun off from Chinese Academy of Sciences with Liu Chuanzhi, a hero of Zhongguancun and current chairman, eventually taking the helm. Lenovo purchased IBM's PC division with $1.75 billion in 2005, making it the world's third-largest PC maker. Both Founder and Lenovo Group maintain strong connections to their academic backers, who are significant shareholders.\n\nMany world-renowned technology companies built their Chinese headquarters and research centers in Zhongguancun Technology Park, such as Google, Intel, AMD, Oracle Corporation, Motorola, Cogobuy Group,[7] IBM,[8] MySpace, Sony, Solstice, and Ericsson. Microsoft has built its Chinese research headquarters in the park that costs $280 million and can accommodate 5000 employees, which was completed in April, 2011, and now houses Microsoft Research Asia.[9]\n\nThe development center of Loongson, which is China's first general-purpose microprocessor design, is also in the Zhongguancun area.[10]\n\nEverbright International has its Beijing office in the Beijing International Building (åäº¬å½é å¤§å¦) in Zhongguancun.[11]\n\nMny conferences are held in this location, including the annual ChinICT conference - which is the largest Information technology Development and Entrepreneurship event in China.\n\nA frequent tourist destination is the Haidian Christian Church, designed by Hamburg-based architects Gerkan, Marg and Partners.[12]\n\nNear to Tuspark\n\nOffices of Microsoft, Sohu"
