        "text": "..\n\nKemao Industries Limited (NSX:KEM) completed its initial public offering (IPO) and listed on the National Stock Exchange of Australia (NSX) on 10 January 2020. At the time of its listing, the company was the first Chinese enterprise to list in Australia in more than two years due to changes to the listing requirements for emerging markets issuers introduced by the NSX in 2017. Biztrack Consultants acted as the company’s nominated adviser for its compliance listing, and continues to act as its continuing nominated adviser.\n\nIf you have any question on this post or have any other query, you may leave us a message by clicking on the “Leave a Message” link.
