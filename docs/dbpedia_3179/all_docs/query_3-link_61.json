        "text": "Pad kee mao ผัดขี้เมา or drunken noodles is stir fried noodles with holy basil and lots of chilies. It's a cult-favourite Thai street food. The combination of chewy fresh rice noodles, the epic savoury sauce, and the fragrance of holy basil ... there is nothing quite like it and it never gets old.\n\nIn this recipe I share 7 secrets to making the perfect, authentic pad kee mao, guaranteed to make this better than take out; and once the prep is done it takes literally 3 minutes to make each portion. You can see the video in the recipe card where I show the cooking in real time!\n\nIngredients and Notes\n\nHere are all the ingredients for drunken noodles and important notes about them. Ingredient amounts will be in the recipe card below. You can change up the vegetables and I love using carrot and Chinese broccoli, though traditionally baby corn, long beans, and straw mushrooms are often added.\n\nSoy sauce. I use Healthy Boy Brand soy sauce which is a classic Thai brand, but any other kind of regular or light soy sauce can be used.\n\nGolden Mountain Sauce. This is another kind of soy sauce with a slightly more intense flavour, you can substitute Maggi Seasoning which is very similar, or use more soy sauce.\n\nOyster sauce. See this post for how to choose good oyster sauce.\n\nFish sauce. See this post for how to choose good fish sauce.\n\nSugar\n\nChinese broccoli, also known as gai lan. Choose young, small stems if you can as they are less bitter.\n\nCarrot\n\nYoung peppercorns. These are totally optional. They can be found fresh or brined in glass jars at some Southeast Asian stores. They are added whole and still on the stems, and when eating you can pick out the peppers and eat them for extra heat.\n\nFingerroot (grachai). Also optional but they do add a lovely herbaceous aroma. They can be found fresh or brined in a glass jar at Southeast Asian stores.\n\nHoly basil. Holy basil can be hard to find, you can sub regular Italian basil or Thai basil instead, but I do find Italian basil to have a flavour more similar to holy basil.\n\nGarlic\n\nThai chilies. Add as many as you want depending on your spice tolerance. If your tolerance isn't high, add just one to start.\n\nLarge, mild red chilies such as spur chilies (pic below), anaheim peppers or red bell pepper.\n\nProtein of your choice, I'm using shrimp. If using chicken, pork, or beef, a quick and simple marinade will be helpful. Instructions in the recipe card below.\n\nFresh rice noodles also known as ho fun noodles. If you buy them from the store they may be cold and stuck together in a block. You'll need to reheat them before separating, following instructions in the recipe card. It is possible to use dried large rice noodles instead but it is not as good, and you will need to cook them first before using.\n\nWhy I use 2 types of chilies in this recipe\n\nPad kee mao uses a lot of chilies, so the chili flavour, not just the heat, is part of the flavour profile. If we only used the fiery Thai chilies, we can only add a few before it becomes too spicy, and not enough chili flavour would come through. So we also use the milder chilies to add more chili flavour without the heat.\n\nIn Thailand, prik chee fa, or spur chilies are used, but any mild red pepper such as anaheim peppers or even red bell pepper would work in a pinch.\n\nHow to Make Authentic Drunken Noodles\n\nBe sure to check out the detailed recipe and full video tutorial in the recipe card below to ensure success - but here's a bird's eye view of what you'll need to do.\n\nMake a rough paste with chilies and garlic.\n\nCook off the protein and remove from the pan.\n\nSauté the chili garlic paste.\n\nAdd gai lan stems, carrots, grachai and young peppercorns.\n\nAdd the noodles, the sauce, and sugar and toss until the sauce has been absorbed.\n\nLet noodles sit and char slightly before tossing. Then repeat the charring a few times.\n\nAdd gai lan leaves and holy basil.\n\nAll done!\n\n7 Secrets to Epic Pad Kee Mao\n\nIt is not hard to make a decent plate of drunken noodles, but an epic one? Not so simple. There are a few things you need to know:\n\nDo not eyeball the ingredients. Weigh the noodles, and measure all sauce ingredients. There are times when winging it is okay, and using your cook's intuition is romantic. But this is not one of those times. The noodle-to-sauce ratio is extremely important, and there's nothing more disappointing than pad kee mao that's bland, or worse, too salty (which cannot be fixed afterward).\n\nMake a chili and garlic paste. One of the great flavours of drunken noodles come from the garlic and chilies. Adding chopped garlic and chilies can only get you so far, but pounding them into a paste in a mortar allows for more flavour to come out and infuse into the whole dish. Also, adding extra peppers that are not spicy gives more chili flavour without it becoming too spicy.\n\nCook 1 portion at a time. This is the secret to well-charred noodles that are not broken or soggy. Crowding the pan traps too much moisture and causes you to stir more which breaks the noodles. It seems tedious but watch the video below and you will see that once the prep is done, each batch literally takes 3 minutes to cook!\n\nCook the protein separately, and do a \"mini brine\". By cooking off the protein first and adding it back in at the end you can control exactly how long it cooks, ensuring perfectly cooked protein every time. Good news is you do not have to cook the protein 1 portion at a time, just cook it all off together in the beginning. Also, if using chicken, pork, or beef, marinate it with seasoning plus a little extra water, like a mini brine, to get extra juicy meat.\n\nAllow noodles to char. Once noodles are mixed with the sauce, allow them to sit and \"grill\" a bit on the hot pan. This creates a little browning, a little smokiness, and a little extra flavour that makes all the difference.\n\nUse fresh noodles. Yes, dry rice noodles exist; and they will work, but it is not the same and not nearly as good as fresh. Cooked previously-dried rice noodles do not yield the same soft and springy texture of fresh noodles, in the same way that cooked dried pasta is not the same as fresh pasta. I understand you gotta use what you have, but if you can, it's worth either looking around for them or making them yourself.\n\nUse a non-stick or well-seasoned wok. These fresh rice noodles are notoriously sticky. So it's important you use either a nonstick wok (even a 12-inch skillet will do) or a well-seasoned wok.\n\nALSO IMPORTANT: Make sure you watch the video in the recipe card below! You'll see me cooking pad kee mao in REAL TIME with no cuts. It'll show you how it's done in only 3 minutes, give you an idea of how the process goes and how to organize your prep, and I promise it'll be so helpful for when you cook!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nI can't find fresh rice noodles, what can I use instead?\n\nYou can make them using my recipe here! You can also use dried wide rice noodles, but the results are not nearly as good and you will need to fully cook them before adding to the pan.\n\nI don't eat shrimp, can I substitute other protein?\n\nYes! Anything works, or even omit the protein altogether. If using chicken, pork, or beef though, I would marinate them following the instructions in the recipe card. That simple marinade yields wonderfully tender meat with the extra bit of water that gets absorbed into the meat.\n\nHow can I make these vegetarian or vegan?\n\nYou can use vegetarian stir-fry sauce instead of oyster sauce, and use soy sauce instead of fish sauce. You can also do a simplified version and use 2 parts soy sauce to 1 part Golden Mountain Seasoning Sauce.\n\nI don't have a wok, what can I use instead?\n\nA 12-inch non-stick skillet will work, it's just a lot easier to toss things in a wok.\n\nThe sauce makes more than I need, what else can I use it for?\n\nAnything! This sauce is actually my Universal Stir-Fry Sauce and it's good in any stir-fries, fried rice, as a marinade, or in another fried noodle dish.\n\nPad Kee Mao - Drunken Noodles\n\nBy: Pailin Chongchitnant\n\nPopular Thai street food made with stir fried fresh rice noodles and holy basil.

Fresh wide rice noodles can be purchased from some Asian grocery stores in the refrigerated section. Dry wide rice noodles can be used, though the results are not as good. You will need 6oz of dry noodles; and they need to be soaked, boiled and rinsed in cold water before using. 2. If using chicken, pork or beef, thinly slice and marinate in 2 teaspoon soy sauce, ¼ teaspoon sugar and 1 tablespoon water for at least 15 minutes. 3. Slice the stems thinly on a bias and roughly chop the leaves. Keep the leaves and stems separated. 4. Thai black soy sauce or Chinese dark soy sauce can be added to darken the colour if you prefer, though I don't think it needs it and have decided to simplify for this new version. If using Chinese dark soy sauce, reduce the amount of sauce slightly as it's quite salty, but Thai black soy sauce is not very salty. 5. Regular Italian basil is a fine substitute for holy basil. 6. In the video I made enough sauce for 4 servings so amounts in the video are different from in the written recipe.\n\nFULL VIDEO TUTORIAL\n\nAll my recipes come with step-by-step video tutorials with extra tips not mentioned in the blog post, so make sure you watch the video to ensure success.

Thank you!\n\nSubscribe to my YouTube Channel\n\nInstructions\n\n*I highly recommend cooking 1 portion at a time for best results, so divide up your prep before you start cooking.\n\nMix the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl and stir to combine.\n\nSeparate the rice noodles from each other (see video for technique). If they are cold, hard and stuck together, you need to heat them up until soft or they will break when you try to separate them. Carefully divide the noodles into 3-4 smaller bundles and spread them out onto a large plate. Microwave at 70% power, stopping every minute to move the noodles around for more even heating. Once they are soft, pull the noodles apart and divide them into portions.\n\nAdd Thai chilies into a mortar and pestle and pound until fine. Add garlic and spur chilies and pound into a rough paste.\n\nBefore you cook, organize your prep: 1) separate the ingredients into batches; 2) combine all non-leafy vegetables, grachai and young peppercorns together; 3) put the basil and leafy greens together; 4) put a tablespoon measure into the sauce and a teaspoon into your sugar crock.; 5) have a bowl ready to put your cooked protein into.\n\nIn a well-seasoned or non-stick wok, heat about 2 tablespoon of vegetable oil over high heat. Once very hot, add your protein to the pan and spread it out into a single layer. Sear on one side until browned or halfway cooked, then flip or toss and cook the other side until done. Remove from the pan and set aside.\n\nPut the pan back on the stove with the heat still off, add the chili/garlic paste and a little more oil if needed. Turn heat on to medium and stir just until the small pieces of garlic start to turn golden brown.\n\nAdd your bowl of non-leafy vegetables, turn the heat on high and stir for about 30 seconds.\n\nAdd the noodles, drizzle the sauce (2 tablespoon per serving) and sprinkle the sugar (1¼ teaspoon per portion; you can eyeball the ¼ tsp) and toss until all the noodles are evenly coated and the sauce has been absorbed. If you want a darker colour, you can add a dash of black or dark soy sauce at this time, a little at a time.\n\nOnce the noodles are well coated, add the protein back in and toss to mix. Then let the noodles sit in the pan without stirring for 15-20 seconds or until the noodles are charred in some spots. Flip the noodles and repeat 1-2 more times.\n\nAdd the basil and any leafy greens and turn off the heat. Toss for just a few seconds until they wilt. Plate and repeat with your other batches.
