(âAmerican Sunshineâ) and Ye Jin (âJinâ) for real property located at 1801 Highland Avenue, Unit D, Duarte, California 91010. The lease agreement included monthly rent amounts in increasing amounts from the years 2021 to 2024 and called for Defendants to pay additional costs, including Common Area Maintenance charges, taxes, and insurance. During negotiations and prior to signing the lease, Plaintiff alleges it relied on Jinâs representation that the property would be used for distribution operations of a third-party logistics provider and related office use.\n\nOn August 1, 2020, Defendants moved into the subject property, but the property was not used for the represented purpose, but instead was used to operate a large scale and/or commercial cannabis cultivation operation. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants falsely represented the use of the property and that it would not have leased the property to Defendants had it known the true intentions. Plaintiff alleges that Defendantsâ use of the property for cannabis operations is unpermitted and Defendant lacks proper licensures.\n\nThe complaint, filed March 30, 2021, alleges causes of action for: (1) fraud; (2) fraud by omission; (3) breach of contract; (4) breach of contract; (5) negligence; and (6) damage to property.\n\nOn April 29, 2021, Plaintiff filed Amendments to the Complaint naming Li Fan (Doe 1), Krystal Williams (Doe 2), Weixian Lo (Doe 3), and Peng Gao (Doe 4).\n\nB.Relevant Background\n\nOn May 14, 2021, the default of American Sunshine was entered.\n\nOn June 30, 2021, the defaults of Krystal Williams and Weixian Lo were entered.\n\nOn July 19, 2021, the default of Ye Jin was entered.\n\nOn July 21, 2021, the default of Peng Gao was entered.\n\nOn August 27, 2021, the default of Li Fan was entered.\n\nOn September 21, 2021, the Court noted at the Case Management Conference that all Defendants had been defaulted. Pursuant to Plaintiffâs counsel request, Defendant Krystal Williams was dismissed with prejudice from the action.\n\nOn May 10, 2022, Peng Gao was dismissed from the complaint without prejudice.\n\nOn December 18, 2023, judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants American Sunshine, Ye Jin, Li Fan, and Weixian Lo on the 1st to 6th causes of action. Plaintiff was awarded $141,717.25 in damages, $31,798.99 in prejudgment interest, $3,307.17 in attorneyâs fees, and $1,142.25 in costs, for a total damages award of $177,965.66 against American Sunshine and Ye Jin. Plaintiff was awarded $44,746.00 in damages and $10,040.12 in prejudgment interest, for a total damages award of $54,786.12 against Weixian Lo and Li Fan.\n\nC.Motion on Calendar\n\nOn May 15, 2024, Li Fan filed a motion to set aside the default and default judgment.\n\nThe Court is not in receipt of an opposition brief.\n\nREQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE\n\nLi Fan requests judicial notice of Exhibit 1, which includes the Hague Service Convention. The request is granted.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nLi Fan moves to set aside the default pursuant to CCP Â§Â§ 473(b) and 473.5. A copy of the proposed answer is attached as Exhibit 7 to the moving papers.\n\nLi Fan argues that he is a Chinese citizen and thus cannot be sub-served or mailed documents and the Hague Convention must be complied with. He argues that default was improperly entered against him as he was not properly served, he did not have actual notice in time to defend the action, and default judgment was entered against him as a result of his own surprise and excusable neglect. He also argues that there are equitable considerations to set aside the default and default judgment.\n\nThe proof of service of the summons and complaint, filed on June 30, 2021, regarding Li Fan states that Li Fan was served by substituted service on May 25, 2021 at 12:05 p.m. by leaving the documents at his home located at 14401 Monte Vista Ave., Chino Hills, CA 91710 with Jane Doe (Asian, female, 5â4â height, age 30, 110 weight, and black hair). The documents were thereafter mailed on May 25, 2021. Service was completed by Brian Sevilla, a registered California process server.\n\nIn support of the motion, Li Fan provides his declaration. He states that on April 25, 2021, without knowledge of the lawsuit, he left the United States and returned to China and remained there for approximately one year. (Fan Decl., Â¶3.) He states that on May 25, 2021, Plaintiff attempted to serve him at the corporate address, but he did not receive the documents because he was in China, he does not work at that location or supervise persons there, and no one contacted him about the documents. (Id., Â¶4.) He states that the Monte Vista Ave. address is not his home or work address, but is the address of American Sunshine; he states that while he is the owner and registered agent for service of process, he did not go to that address. (Id., Â¶Â¶5, 7.) Li Fan states that he was not the individual served in the proof of service (Jane Doe) and was not present at the time of service since he was in China. (Id., Â¶6.) He provides a copy of his ID card and business information in China, showing his Chinese residence and company addresses. (Id., Â¶7, Ex. 1 [Business License].) He states that he was born in China, is a citizen and resident of China, owns an apartment in Beijing (Shangdi Xili Fengfangyuan, Building No. 1, Door 1, Unit 302, Haidian District, Beijing City, China), owns a company named Beijing Luyan Puzhao Shengshi Technology Limited (Zhongguancun Kemao Market 5F 5A08, 18 Zhongguancun St., Haidian District in Beijing City, China), and his temporary home address in the United States is 6931 Riverside Drive, Chino, CA 91710 which is confirmed by his driverâs license. (Id., Â¶7, Ex. 6 [Driverâs License].) He states that in March 2024, he received a notice of involuntary lien from the County Recorderâs Offices indicating that there was an abstract of judgment recorded on his home co-owned by him and his wife at the Riverside Drive address, which has been his home since May 2021. (Id., Â¶8.) Li Fan states that according to his passport, he was in China from April 26, 2021 to May 2022, he did not receive legal documents during this time, and he only became aware of the judgment in March 2024. (Id., Â¶10, Ex. 2 [Passport, Visa].) He states that he did not timely respond to the complaint because he did not receive actual notice of Plaintiffâs action until recently. (Id., Â¶11.) He states that he did not avoid service and the lack of notice was not caused by him; he states he would have timely responded to the lawsuit if he had received notice in time. (Id.) He states that once he received notice in late March 2024 of the abstract filing, he contacted his attorney, Law Offices of Sam X.J. Wu, APC, to investigate the basis of the abstract and the lawsuit and he retained them to handle the case. (Id., Â¶12.)\n\nWith respect to the purported service on Li Fan at 14401 Monte Vista Ave., while he is the registered agent for service of process of American Sunshine, this did not amount to service of Li Fan as an individual defendant. As stated in his declaration, this was not his place of business nor as indicated in the proof of service, his home. He states that he was not served with the documents after they were mailed to that location either.\n\nIn addition, Li Fan states in his declaration that the 14401 Monte Vista Ave. was not his place of residence. Instead, he provides his California driverâs license showing that his home in California is located at 6931 Riverside Drive. It does not appear that service was effectuated at this address. According to the declaration of diligence attached to the proof of service, service as only attempted at the 14401 Monte Vista Ave. location in May 2021. A certified translated copy of his passport also indicates that he was not present in the United States at the time of service on May 25, 2021.\n\nCCP Â§ 413.10(c) states: âExcept as otherwise provided by statute, a summons shall be served on a person: â¦ (c) Outside the United States, as provided in this chapter or as directed by the court in which the action is pending, or, if the court before or after service finds that the service is reasonably calculated to give actual notice, as prescribed by the law of the place where the person is served or as directed by the foreign authority in response to a letter rogatory. These rules are subject to the provisions of the Convention on the âService Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documentsâ in Civil or Commercial Matters (Hague Service Convention).â (Emphasis added.) China is a signatory to the Hague Convention.\n\nAs Li Fan is a Chinese citizen, Plaintiff was required to serve him pursuant to the Hague Convention. (See Watts v. Crawford (1995) 10 Cal.4th 743.) âFailure to comply with the Hague Service Convention procedures voids the service even though it was made in compliance with California law. [Citation.] This is true even in cases where the defendant had actual notice of the lawsuit. [Citation.]â (Kott v. Superior Court (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1126, 1136.) Li Fan has provided his work and home addresses in China, such that his addresses in China are known. (Id. at 1136 [âThe only method of service under California law which does not require the transmission of documents abroad, and consequently does not implicate the Hague Service Convention, is service of summons by publication where the party's address remains unknown during the publication period despite the exercise of reasonable diligence.â].)\n\nLi Fan also provides his residence in California. He states in his declaration that âIf I had been served at my residence, my wife would have given me the documents and I would have responded to the lawsuit.â (Fan Decl., Â¶11.) Thus, it appears that Li Fan would have also been amenable to being served at his California residence. Given that he is willing to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court, the Court is inclined to grant him a hearing on the merits of the case despite the improbability that he did not know of the case.\n\nThe Court notes that this motion is a motion to set aside the default and judgment, not a motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. As such, the Court will grant the motion to vacate the default and judgment entered in this action against Li Fan. By way of filing of this motion, Li Fan is submitting to the Courtâs jurisdiction and seeks to defend the action by filing an answer.\n\nBased on the declaration of Li Fan, the Court finds that there is substantive merit to granting the motion pursuant to CCP Â§Â§ 473(b) and 473.5. Finally, the policy of the law strongly favors a hearing on the merits, which supports granting this motion. (Thompson v. Sutton (1942) 50 Cal.App.2d 272, 276.) The motion is granted.\n\nCONCLUSION AND ORDER\n\nDefendant Li Fanâs motion to set aside the default and default judgment is granted. Defendant is ordered to electronically file his answer following the hearing on the matter.\n\nA case management conference is set for September 26, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.\n\nDefendant shall provide notice of this order.\n\nDATED: June 28, 2024 ___________________________\n\nJohn Kralik\n\nJudge of the Superior Court"
