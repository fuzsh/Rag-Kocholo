        "text": "Penn State offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki acknowled the wide-reaching impact of the two starting running backs at his disposal. Meeting with reporters on Saturday for the Nittany Lions’ preseason media day, his praise for Nick Singleton and Kaytron Allen was effusive.\n\nThe back-to-back Co-MVP winners during Penn State’s annual awards banquet, their on-field performances have been prolific. But, Kotelnicki noted, they’ve also set an example that provides benefits that extend beyond their play.\n\n“To see Nick and Fat and how they grow and how they’re still improving. Coach Seider just said it to me the other day that it’s really good for Quinton Martin and Cam Wallace to recognize that Nick Singleton is committed as he is to everything he’s doing, and Kaytron, that they’re still getting better,” said Kotelnicki. “That there’s improvement that they’re making through spring and fall camp and they’re understanding and they’re trying to diversify themselves.”\n\nTuesday afternoon, the sentiment was built upon with a new round of watch list nominations for the two running backs. One of only 10 programs with two running backs nominated, the Doak Walker Award, bestowed annually to the nation’s best college football running back, Penn State is again expecting to feature both.\n\nNext steps for Penn State running backs\n\nThrough two seasons apiece thus far, that has taken shape previously with a combined 4,857 all-purpose yards between the two. For Allen, that has meant 1,769 yards on the ground, with 16 rushing touchdowns over the past two seasons. And for Singleton, he’s had 1,813 yards rushing with 20 career touchdowns over the past two seasons.\n\nLeaning into the “all-purpose” part of the quation this offseason, Kotelnicki and the Nittany Lions are aiming to expand how they’re used in the offense.\n\n“My challenge to them has been, ‘Let’s diversify ourselves. Let’s figure out ways that you can touch the ball without just having take a handoff.’ And I think they’ve done a really, really good job of that embracing, maybe the mental side of things, the technique side of things that need to occur,” said Kotelnicki.\n\nPenn State is nearing the start of its second week of preseason practices ahead of an August 31 season-opener at West Virginia. The Nittany Lions are ranked No. 9 in the first USA Today Coaches Poll ahead of the 2024 campaign."
