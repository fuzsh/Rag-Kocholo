        "text": "On Wednesday, February 21, the Kentucky Journal of Equine, Agriculture, & Natural Resources Law (KJEANRL), in conjunction with the University of Kentucky College of Law, hosted its fourth annual symposium entitled, “Innovation & Advancement”.\n\nLegal practitioners and regulators from across Kentucky shared their thoughts on current legal, policy, and regulation issues affecting the environment, equine industry, and energy. The symposium took place at the William T. Young Library in the UK Athletic Association Auditorium.\n\nTrevor Nichols, Executive Development Editor for KJEANRL, spearheaded the planning for this year’s symposium. “KJEANRL works hard each year to use its platform to bring together bright legal and industry minds for one day, in a common space, where the shared dialogue could lead to real impact on law and policy,” said Nichols.\n\nPresenters for the all-day event included:\n\nBryan Brendle, American Horse Council\n\nJames Burling, Pacific Legal Foundation\n\nWilliam T. Gorton III, Stites & Harbison PLLC\n\nJames Kay II, Kentucky House of Representatives\n\nRyan Quarles, Commissioner, Kentucky Department of Agriculture\n\nRandal A. Strobo, Strobo Barkley PLLC; and\n\nTy Yeast, AllTech\n\nThe morning sessions featured discussions on the Clean Water Act, federal legislative developments impacting the horse industry and consumer challenges to food production. The afternoon sessions focused on the challenges and opportunities for Kentucky agriculture in 2018 and the debate over history and originalism.\n\n“The success of the symposium was made possible by the presenters who took time out of their busy schedules to engage with the University and legal community. We also thank the College of Law administration for its critical support of this student-led initiative,” stated Nichols.\n\nThe KJEANRL is a multi-disciplinary journal of law, science, and policy published twice annually by the UK College of Law and edited entirely by students of the College of Law."
