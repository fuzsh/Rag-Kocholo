        "text": "In recognition of the dedication and commitment that first responders make day in and day out, Midway University is now offering a 15% tuition discount for its evening and online course offerings to those professionals. The deal, which is part of Midway University’s Business Advantage Program, also applies to spouses and dependents of the first responders.\n\n“The Business Advantage Program targets the working professional,” said Dr. John Marsden, president of Midway University. “Employees can earn their bachelor’s or master’s degree through our evening or online classes, which allows them to continue to work full-time.”\n\nDavid Lyons, a retired Police Commander from the Lexington Police Department, obtained his MBA degree from Midway in 2014 and says it helped him tremendously.\n\n“The beauty of attending Midway University online is that it allows you to plan around your work schedule to pursue a degree,” Lyons said. “Getting my MBA from Midway served me well as I climbed the ranks as a police officer, and has helped me in many other business pursuits since my retirement.”\n\n“There is no cost to employers who make this available and with many of our Business Advantage Program partners who already provide tuition remission for their employees, the savings is a true benefit to the employer helping them lower their costs while providing a great employee benefit,” said Marsden.\n\nFirst responders can choose from more than 20 career-focused undergraduate degree programs in the areas of business, criminal justice, drug and alcohol counseling, nursing, psychology and teacher education. Graduate programs include several MBA degree options, and advanced degrees in nursing and education.\n\nThe University has worked with the Kentucky Sheriff’s Association, the Kentucky Police Chiefs Association and the Kentucky Firefighters Association to make them aware of this new discount and benefit available to their members.\n\nWatch the announcement online at https://youtu.be/Ru-6AgMCwZs.\n\nWhen developing this partnership the University focused on the legal definition of first responder which includes primarily field based first responders including police, fire, and EMS."
