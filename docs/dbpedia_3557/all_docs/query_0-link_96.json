Submissions should also include the name of the funeral home or crematory handling the arrangements for confirmation purposes.\n\nBanner Graphic obituary rates are as follows:\n\nUp to 299 words: $100\n\n300-399 words: $150\n\n400-499 words: $200\n\nThe rate scale continues on with this pattern â€” $50 more for each additional 100-word increment.\n\nThere is no additional charge for a photo to be included.\n\nThe Banner Graphic publishes in print twice weekly, on Tuesdays and Fridays, and obituary submissions should be made by 3 p.m. on the day prior."
