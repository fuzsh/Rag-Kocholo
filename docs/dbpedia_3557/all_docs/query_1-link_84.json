        "text": "Sports have always cause some people out there to do and say things that are not at all cool or socially acceptable. There's the guy who poisoned an entire grove of trees on the opposing team's campus after they had the nerve to defeat his beloved team.\n\nThere's also the two idiots (father and son) who ran onto the field at a White Sox game to physically attack the first base coach of the other team, leaving him with permanent hearing damage.\n\nOver zealous (a nicer way of saying stupid and violent in this case) fans have attacked mascots, threatened and/or assaulted opposing fans, and even called in bomb-threats to an arena that had to cancel a scheduled match-up because of it.\n\nNow, we have an Winchester, Illinois man in deep trouble over a something he said on social media that caused problems for country music star Morgan Wallen and the security at a concert in Kansas City last Saturday night.\n\nIt's Never Good To Have The Charge Of \"Class E Felony Of Making A Terroristic Threat In The Second Degree\" On Your Résumé, But That's What An Illinois Man Now Has\n\nThat man, 23 year-old Aaron Brown III, of Winchester, Illinois was hit with the charge on Saturday morning, according to the Jackson County, Missouri, Prosecutor’s Office.\n\nWhat did Mr. Brown do, and why did he do it? The what is a lot easier to answer than the why in this case.\n\nAccording to published reports, Kansas City Police detectives and intelligence agents were monitoring X (formerly Twitter) and other social media platforms on Saturday night looking for threats or threatening commentary about that evening's Morgan Wallen concert at Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium\n\nAnd they found some.\n\nThe Comments On X Mentioned Shooting Someone At The Concert---Two Players For The Kansas City Chiefs Who Were Reportedly Planning On Attending The Morgan Wallen Concert\n\nAuthorities in Kansas City haven't identified the two Chiefs players, but I think a reasonable guess could probably be made here. Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, along with Chris Jones were in attendance that night at Arrowhead Stadium, and joined Morgan Wallen.\n\nPolice delayed the start of the concert by about 40 minutes as they searched for Mr. Brown before locating him and charging him with making a terroristic threat.\n\nBrown's girlfriend told police that Brown and some buddies have made \"burner accounts\" on social media (a burner account is an account under an assumed name/alias where you can post things and keep your anonymity) to say \"stupid stuff.\"\n\nShe says she told him not to post that, but he was of the opinion that nobody would even read it.\n\nHe was wrong."
