        "text": "Brenda Kay Smith, aged 74, of Lexington, Kentucky, entered rest on February 2, 2024. A native of Charleston, West Virginia, she was born December 25th, 1949, to the late James R. and Betty C. McAllister. Brenda joined her dearly departed parents, brother James Ray McAllister Jr., sister Bootsie C. Morey, and beloved son James-Allen Smith.\n\nShe is survived by her devoted husband of 57 years, Eldon Smith, her loving sisters, Dara Dodson (married to Terry) and Terry Chamberlain (married to George), and her children, Tema Smith-Bosken (married to Robert), Jonathan Smith, Melea Peloquin, Amariah Leasor (married to Jonathan), and Jeshua Smith. Her legacy is beautifully reflected in the lives of her twelve grandchildren and one great-granddaughter, who will carry forward her memory with love and devotion.\n\nA faithful servant of Jehovah, Brenda was a steadfast member of the University Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses and lived her life as a testament to her faith. Her gentle spirit and unwavering belief in the hope of resurrection touched all who knew her. Brenda’s life reflected the love and teachings of Jehovah, and her commitment to her faith was unwavering.\n\nBrenda’s talents and warmth were evident in her enjoyment of cooking, sewing, crafts, and canning, hobbies that she pursued with care and joy. Her kindheartedness and trustworthiness endeared her to many, creating lasting friendships and a legacy of kindness. Brenda and Elden are 1966-67 Bourbon County High School graduates.\n\nThe family will receive friends for visitation at the Clark Legacy Center, located at 601 Brannon Rd., Nicholasville, Kentucky, on Friday, February 16, 2024, from 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm. A memorial service to celebrate Brenda’s life will be held at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 400 Kingston Rd., Lexington, Kentucky, on Saturday, February 17, 2024, at 2:00 pm.\n\nBrenda Kay Smith’s life was a beacon of love and faith, and her memory will be treasured by all who were blessed to know her."
