        "text": "Good News Friday is here! Now, whether you are a basketball fan or not, an Oakland University fan or not, last night was an absolute lesson in how one identifies where they are and sees the Dream where they want to go as Oakland upset Kentucky in the NCAA tournament, a 14 seed beating a 3 seed and powerhouse. The article I am reposting from Front Office Sports provides an insight to an individual who was a redshirt freshman at an DII school but whose dream was to be on the court with the best. If you follow basketball, this is a Dream, and one that takes what I hope every leader is willing to admit they need: üåÑ Willing to dream - Let lose, dream at work and dream at home, be willing to do it! You did it as a kid, you can do it again! Remember your dreams as a kid, you wanted to be the best at a certain sport, hobby, whatever it was and you would do everything to make it happen. Some of our best inventions and leaders have been those that dared to dream. People love to get behind a Dream! üó£ Others - This individual, Jack Gohlke, needed coaches, trainers, his teammates, and many others at the university to be successful. Are you willing to let others help you be successful? üë∑‚ôÇÔ∏è Hard Work - There will never be a substitute for this, and I am not talking about being so consumed that you don't have time for your family, others, or have horrible balance. But when you are in the arena, when you are in practice, when you are at work, you are giving your best, because you know the dream is worth it. Allowing yourself to dream, allowing others to help, working hard, are three great ways to see your life, both professional and personal, go to the next level! Have a powerful day and you have what it takes! #Dream #DreamBigGoBig #EncourageAndTakeCareOfEachOther\n\nWe have reached the end of another season of the USL League 2 and W League. Unfortunately, we did not achieve our goal of making the playoffs, but this in no way diminishes the recognition and gratitude for everyone involved in this beautiful project. A very special thank you to Mayowa Owolabi for the opportunity and the courage to lead such a humane and cohesive project. Many thanks to our entire technical and medical staff, and to both our men's and women's teams, as well as the Miami community, which has increasingly embraced the team. Last but equally important, thank you to the United Soccer League (USL) and all your devoted workers who make this tournament a wonderful experience. Here are some numbers from this season: Pre-competitive and competitive period for League 2 and W League: May 9th to July 11th Training Sessions: 55 at 2 different facilities Home Matches: 11 People involved and managed on match-day operations: 14 Away Matches: 11 Distance traveled: 5517 miles (8878 km) Traveling meals: 231 (for lunch) and 112 pizzas (post-match) Away Venues: 9 (Locations: Weston, Palm City, Orlando, Melbourne, Lakeland, Jacksonville, Tampa, Sarasota, St. Petersburg) Points: USL League 2: 26 - USL W League: 19 Team of the month: 1 player in USL League 2 Player signed with a Pro team: 1 Players invited for Professional Team Combine: 3 in USL League 2 To some, these may seem like modest numbers, but for those involved in the process and the day-to-day of the league, knowing the budget constraints that teams of this standard face, these numbers make me proud. They demonstrate an incessant pursuit of excellence, respect for our possibilities, and a vision of a promising future. #repthemac #socceroperations #soccermanagement #uslleague2 #uslwleague\n\nThere are some key factors that come to play when choosing a cold plunge. How will it last long term? How will it hold up in the heat? How many features does it have? Often times people assume that because our Plunge is priced so far below competitors that it lacks features when in fact, its actually plumbed with the same options and equipment as some of our 5,000 - 12,000 pricepoint competitors, only ours beats everyone when it comes to insulation which is one of the most important aspects of a cold plunge. This is probably why going with our model was a no brainer for NFL Champion, Patrick O‚Äô Donnell! #coldplunge #nfl #greenbaypackers #recoveryforathletes"
