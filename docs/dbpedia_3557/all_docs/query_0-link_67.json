Non-structural experience is required for licensure as a PE in Illinois.\n\nApplication to The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (Department) is not required prior to registering for the examination.\n\n• Any candidate possessing a Baccalaureate degree in engineering meeting the requirements of Section 1480.110 for an approved program and any candidate whose conferred Baccalaureate degree meets the non-approved program requirement as specified in Section 1480.120 may register with NCEES and be approved to sit for the PE Structural examination.\n\n• The Statute, Rules, education, experience, and examination requirements for Illinois SE profession are available here: https://idfpr.illinois.gov/profs/se.html\n\nThe following items are required to be submitted to NCEES through your NCEES dashboard-prior to being approved for SE exam registration:\n\nTranscripts: Official college transcript(s) for your conferred Baccalaureate degree must be sent directly from your institution to NCEES or be included with your NCEES credential evaluation.\n\nFE exam Verification: Verification of passage of the FE exam must be listed in your NCEES Account.\n\nIf you took the FE exam from October 2010 through the present, your passing results should be listed in the exam history of your NCEES dashboard.\n\nIf you took the FE exam in Illinois prior to October 2010, please contact our office at [email protected] and use the subject line “FE exam verification for SE exam registration” so we can complete your SE exam registration approval process.\n\nIf you do not see your FE exam verified in your NCEES dashboard and passed the exam in another state, you must request for your FE exam to be verified in your NCEES dashboard from the state board where you took and passed the exam.\n\nThe Illinois jurisdiction requires all examinees attest to the following statements before they can proceed with registering and scheduling an exam:\n\n1. I acknowledge I have read and understand the Illinois Statute and Rules, and specifically the minimum qualifications to be eligible for licensure as a Structural Engineer in Illinois.\n\n2. I acknowledge I am a graduate of an approved Baccalaureate degree program or have a conferred Baccalaureate degree meeting requirements for a non-approved program specified in Section 1480.120 of the Rules for the administration of the Illinois SE Act.\n\n3. I acknowledge and understand that passing this NCEES examination does not, by itself, guarantee future licensure in Illinois or any other state or jurisdiction.\n\nregister\n\nThe Iowa board does not require FE examinees to submit an application or an additional fee prior to registering with NCEES and scheduling an exam.\n\nExaminees will be provided one attempt per testing window and no more than three attempts in a 12-month period.\n\nThe Iowa Engineering and Land Surveying Examining Board (IA Board) no longer requires examinees to submit a pre-approval application or fee to the Board prior to registering for and scheduling to take the NCEES PE exam. However, the following items are required to be submitted to NCEES prior to PE exam registration:\n\n· Official college transcript(s) sent directly from your institution to NCEES. The IA Board requires that the transcript show you have earned a degree of four years or more in engineering from an Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology/Engineering Accreditation Commission (ABET/EAC) - or Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB)-accredited curriculum. Iowa does not accept engineering technology degrees, even if accredited. All examinees should visit www.abet.org or www.ceab.org to ensure their bachelor’s degree is from an ABET/EAC or CEAB-accredited program at their specific institution\n\n· Verification of passage of the FE exam submitted directly from the state where you passed the exam. You can check to see if your FE exam has already been verified by looking at the right side of your dashboard when you log in and following the Exam Verification link. If you do not see your FE exam verified here, you must request for your FE exam to be verified in your account. To accomplish this, go to the right side of your dashboard when you log in, where there will be a link to click to Request Exam Verification and simply follow the steps to make the request to the state board where you took and passed the exam. Keep in mind that some state boards require ample time to process the verification, and plan accordingly.\n\nThe IA Board recommends all examinees to visit the Board’s website at http://www.plb.iowa.gov to review the IA Engineering Rules and PE application information for initial licensure to guarantee they understand the minimum qualifications. After doing so, all IA PE exam applicants must attest to the following 5 statements before they can proceed with the registering for and scheduling an exam:\n\n1.
