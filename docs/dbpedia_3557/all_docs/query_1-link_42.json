        "text": "JK Flake received a BS in Psychology from Northern Kentucky University in 2010, an MA in Quantitative Psychology from James Madison University in 2012, and a PhD in Measurement, Evaluation, and Assessment from the University of Connecticut in 2015. From 2015 to 2018 she worked as a postdoctoral researcher in quantitative psychology at York University and educational psychology at the University of Virginia. In 2018 she started her lab in the Quantitative Psychology area of the Department of Psychology at McGill University. JK Flake is also the Assistant Director for Methods at the Psychological Science Accelerator, and a member of the Technical Advisory Panel of the Enrollment Management Association. Her research interests include the development and application of latent variable models for use in educational and social psychological research and the improvement of measurement practices in psychology more broadly.\n\nResearch Areas:\n\nQuantitative Psychology & Modelling\n\nSocial & Personality\n\nResearch Summary:\n\nAre we measuring what we think we are measuring? This is a foundational question for psychological scientists because we often study phenomena that are difficult to observe and measure. I am pursuing two complimentary research trajectories, both aimed at improving measurement practices in psychology. In my quantitative research trajectory, I develop structural equation and multilevel models for measurement, particularly understanding the ramifications of a lack of measurement invariance. In my more applied research trajectory I develop practices, measures, and models for educational and social psychology. A theme in my work is bridging the gap between the quantitative methods and substantive research communities.\n\nI will not be accepting students for Fall 2022 admissions.\n\nSelected References:"
