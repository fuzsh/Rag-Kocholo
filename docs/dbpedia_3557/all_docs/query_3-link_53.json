I like the fact that all I need to do is tell them my requirements and they go away and find some applicants for me. I have a very good relationship with my account manager and know I can call upon her at any time with any questions I may have.\n\nSenior Operations Manager, Transport Company\n\nWe've got a great working relationship with Kay and James Kay Associates. They've listened to what we've said about our company, our values, our culture and what we're really looking for from our prospective employees as we continue to grow our company. And more often than not they get it right! With a collaborative approach, James Kay are trusted recruitment consultants to our business and we believe that as one of their clients they will always put our interests first as well as those of their candidates - as we know it's a hard balancing act for many recruitment agencies, but James Kay get it just right! We're really looking forward to continuing to work with James Kay as part of our PSL agency relationships\n\nHead Of People, IT Solutions Company"
