        "text": "It’s back — the proprietary punting stat that doesn’t stink! If you want the long version, ask away in the comments. As for the short version, almost every punting stat is heavily dependent on factors outside the punter themselves. That’s why I invented the “bad punt” metric. Why do this analysis now?\n\nTraining camp and preseason is the time for position battles and player evaluations. While Jack Browning was just booted off the Buffalo Bills, that doesn’t necessarily mean Sam Martin’s spot is entirely safe. Even if it is, it’s fun to make an opinion on whether or not it should be safe.\n\nThe Gist\n\nBad punt data looks at punt distance based on position on the field and deems it either a “bad” or “good” punt. All punts in opponent territory are considered bad. punts from your own 24- to 49-yard line should travel at least 40 yards or greater to avoid the “bad” label. Finally, punts from your own 1- to 24-yard line have to go at least league average distance to be considered “good.” League average was 47.42 yards in 2023, so punts traveling 47 yards or more qualify as “good.”\n\nGot it? If not, check out my original explanation here (note that I have tweaked the metric since then).\n\nThe Data\n\nFor the data, I do have to manually review play data, so I traditionally stick to comparing 10 punters from the previous year, ensuring to include any Bills punter(s) on the list. The list is organized by average yards per punt from best (Ryan Stonehouse) to worst (Lou Hedley). This gives a decent idea of how traditional metrics felt our punter did. Now on to my stat.\n\nIf you want to peep the numbers, here’s last year’s article that also featured Sam Martin so you can read along as I’ll compare Martin to not only peers, but to his 2022 self.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there’s some correlation to overall yards per punt and bad punt rate as both are tied to distance. When it comes to punts backed up between their own 1- to 24-yard line, Martin does better than some contemporaries like Brady Wing, Pressley Harvin, and Lou Hedley (Wing’s sample size should be acknowledged). That said Martin is well above the average from the sample size of 10 punters I pulled from this year.\n\nMore concerning is comparing Martin to his past self. In the 2022 sample Martin stood as the only kicker with ZERO bad punts when backed way up. Here’s the way I see it. When you’re backed way the heck up, you want to boot it consistently to at least the other side of the field. Martin was spectacularly consistent in this regard in 2022, but was a model of inconsistency last season.\n\nCloser to midfield, Martin mostly redeems himself. While his 12.9% bad punt rate is about perfectly average to the sample size, that’s a far cry better than the last zone we covered. On the other hand, there’s plenty of other punters with better results to be jealous of.\n\nIt’s also a slight improvement for Martin from the 2022 season where he had bad punts on 17.2% of attempts. It’s a slight improvement as noted, as only two more bad punts in 2023 would have tipped the scale slightly the other direction.\n\nThe last grouping is more coaching tendency than anything else, but it’s something I like to examine while punting. With 11 punts in opponent territory, this looks like a step back to me for head coach Sean McDermott. There were certainly moments of aggression from McDermott this last year, but in 2022 Martin was only asked to punt five times in opponent territory.\n\nThe Final Straw\n\nEven bad punts won’t distill things solely to punter performance, but I like it better than traditional stats. Yes, I may be biased.\n\nWhen it comes to Sam Martin, I think it may be fair to believe that some of the results revealed above are legitimate concerns that the team may share. Poor results when backed way up are alarming and may be enough to look for an upgrade. But at this stage of training camp, Sam Martin is the only punter on the roster."
