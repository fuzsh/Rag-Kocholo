        "text": "LIBERTY, Ky. (WKYT) - Three people are dead after a Sunday crash in Casey County.\n\nIt happened after 2 p.m. at the intersection of U.S. 127 and Ky. 70, south of Liberty.\n\nJames and Teresa Burton had just left church and were headed to Easter dinner. They were headed south on 127 when another car was going across the intersection from 70.\n\nFor whatever reason, police say the car did not stop at the stop sign, and the cars collided, killing three people and injuring a fourth.\n\nWe’re told 67-year-old James and 56-year-old Teresa Burton both died as a result of the crash. State police say 85-year-old Otis Tapscott was driving the car that collided with the Burtons. Tapscott also died at the scene.\n\nJames’s brother, Darrell Burton, is the pastor of the church. He said that just hours before the crash, they were all attending a wonderful service.\n\n“The good thing, they were both here at our church that morning. Me and James and Teresa, during the service at the end, just a phenomenal service. God was moving and touching lives. They were both standing at the front with their hands lifted, worshipping the lord. There’s not a better memory than that,” said Pastor Burton.\n\nAnother passenger, 21-year-old Jackie Dylan Cooper, was also hurt in the crash, but Pastor Burton says they believe he will recover.\n\nThe crash has a lot of people asking for safety improvements to the intersection of 70 and 127. Many are saying there needs to be a traffic light installed. Some people have started an online petition for that.\n\nKentucky State Police are investigating the crash."
