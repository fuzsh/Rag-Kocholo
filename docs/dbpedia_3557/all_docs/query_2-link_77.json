        "text": "By WVUA 23 Digital Reporter Candace Johnson\n\nAlabama’s two existing state workforce boards are uniting to create the Alabama Workforce Board. Derived from the Alabama Workforce Council and the State Workforce Development Board, comes the Alabama Workforce Board and its Executive Committee.\n\nGov. Kay Ivey has appointed six members to the committee, and over 30 members to the board. These members will be at the head of the decisions being made concerning Alabama’s workforce.\n\n“Throughout my tenure as governor, no matter what it is we are trying to accomplish, I ask what we can do today to prepare our state for success in the future. No doubt, ensuring we have an equipped workforce is critical as we look to fill jobs today – and in the future,” said Governor Ivey.\n\n“I am proud to assemble a group of some of our state’s business and industry leaders to work with us as we streamline our workforce development efforts,” said Ivey.\n\nAlabama Power President and CEO Jeff Peoples was appointed chair of the Executive Committee of the Alabama Workforce Board. Webb Concrete President and CEO Phil Webb was appointed chair of the Alabama Workforce Board.\n\n“Activating Alabamians with meaningful career opportunities and providing the necessary training and resources to get them there, helps strengthen our communities,” said Peoples.\n\n“Today, Alabama is taking steps to reorient our state’s workforce development system to better serve people and grow our state. I am pleased to work with Ivey and other state leaders in that effort,” said Peoples.\n\nThe Executive Committee will provide a plan for Alabama’s workforce development program and an annual budget for coordinating the workforce.\n\n“Greater industry engagement will reinforce our focus on workforce results, creating a more effective utilization of the state’s resources and improved prospects for those served by the workforce development system,” said Webb. “I am excited to participate in this newly streamlined approach to talent development in our Sweet Home Alabama.”\n\nThe appointments will be in effect on Oct. 1."
