        "text": "Mrs. Kay Cosby Jones, 69, former Commissioner and Vice Mayor for the City of Richmond, passed away Tuesday, June 21, 2022. She was born June 26, 1952, in Richmond, Kentucky, as the only child of R. Josh and Helen Kiser Cosby. In 1975, she united in marriage to David Malcolm Jones, who preceded her in death in February 2021. In addition to her husband and her parents, she was also preceded by an infant son: James Matthew Jones.\n\nKay graduated valedictorian of her senior class at Madison High School. She attended Eastern Kentucky University, majoring in pre-pharmacy as well as playing in the band. Kay graduated from the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy. Following graduation, she worked in downtown Richmond for over 38 years as a registered pharmacist at Super X, Revco now known as CVS. In addition, she taught pharmacotherapeutics at EKU.\n\nKay's passion was serving the people. Not only as a pharmacist, but also in public service. First by serving on the Richmond City School Board. As a member there, along with other board members, she realized the need to consolidate the Richmond City and the Madison County School Systems. Following her service to the school board, Kay was elected to the Board of Richmond City Commissioners, serving the public for 21 years of great progress and strong honest leadership. She also served twice as Vice Mayor. During her tenure on the commission she was a champion of economic and community development. She helped to bring needed change and expansion to many areas of the city. Many buildings and parks bear her name on the commemorative plaques, Richmond City Hall, the Hall of Justice, fire stations, the police station, Gibson Bay Park and Aquatics Complex, the recycling center, Irvinton House, as well as the Industrial Park Complex. Most recently, Kay and Josh donated to Richmond Tourism a Christmas sleigh that was a part of their home during the Christmas season. For this wonderful gift, the Richmond Tourism Board presented to Kay \"The Spirit of Christmas Award.\"\n\nAnother love for Kay and her late husband David was event planning and floral design. They owned \"The Village Florist\" in Richmond for approximately 20 years. This led them to decorate for The Richmond Area Arts Gala as well as the PACA Ball. Kay served as Pattie A. Clay Auxiliary President and twice co-chaired the annual ball.\n\nKay was a member of The First Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). She was also a member of the Chancel Choir and the DWM Group 3 (Disciples Women's Ministries). She was a volunteer at God's Outreach Food Bank.\n\nSurvivors include her son: Joshua Anderson Baldwin Jones; her cousin: Steve Cosby, a very special friend; Michael Joseph Reister; and her dear friend and caregiver: Sharon Isaacs.\n\nFuneral service will be conducted at 11 a.m. Wednesday, June 29, 2022, at the First Christian Church with Rev. Patrick Messer, Dr. Robert Vickers, Dr. Robert R. Blythe and Dr. Steve McSwain officiating. Burial will follow in the Richmond Cemetery.\n\nVisitation will be from 5 - 8 p.m. Tuesday evening, June 28, 2022, at First Christian Church.\n\nPallbearers are David Stapp, Willard Reardon, David Stipes, Mike Reister, Tony Cain and Jimmy Phoenix. Honorary pallbearers are Jami and Graham Nichols, Jean and Robbie Robinson, Harriet Stipes, Tina Hill, Susan Gay Taylor, Vickie Borgmeier, Becky Hamilton Brown, Pam Hall, Steve Cosby and the members of the DWM Group 3 of First Christian Church.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to The First Christian Church Building Fund, P.O.
