        "text": "This article locates itself at the intersection of the social history of postcolonial migrations and the intellectual history of leftism and Third-Worldism in the aftermath of May '68. It is the first study of the radical political group Révolution Afrique. From 1972 until its ban by the French government in 1977, this organization forged by African and French activists mobilized against neocolonial ideologies and policies on both sides of the Mediterranean. By tracing the organization's rise and fall through extensive archival research and in-depth interviews, the article explores the changing meanings of transnational activism by weaving together the biographical paths of the activists, the institutional and political constraints they faced, and the ideological framework within which they operated. During this short time frame, the transnational agenda that made sense among African workers and students in the early 1970s became irrelevant. The increasing repression of political dissent in Africa and France, the suspension of migratory flows, and the French government's implementation of return policies in the late 1970s forced the group's African activists to adopt a more national approach to their actions, or simply withdraw from high-risk activism. Despite the dissolution of Révolution Afrique, this collective endeavor appears to have been a unique experience of political education for African activists, transcending distinct social and national boundaries that until now have been left unexamined by social scientists specialized in the complex history of the relationships between France and Africa.\n\nThis article focuses on the song \"L'estaca,\" which was composed in 1968 by Catalan songwriter Lluís Llach and became emblematic of the struggle against the Francoist dictatorship. I trace the ways in which the song has been reused and assigned new valence in a variety of cultural and political contexts, including the 1980s Solidarność movement in Poland and the Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia. I interrogate how this anti-Francoist song has been recently recaptured by leftist social movements and political parties in Spain, as well as by the Catalan separatist movement. The article is part of the special issue \"Music and the Politics of Memory: Resounding Antifascism across Borders\" (Federico Spinetti et al., eds.).\n\nAn innovative account of how the concept of the Third World emerged in France from the mid-1950s through to the mid-1970s alongside a new leftist movement. The book reveals how, in an age of Cold War, decolonization, and development thinking, French activists rose to prominence within the political Left, established transnational contacts, and developed a new global consciousness. Using the Third World concept to reinvigorate anticolonial solidarity, they supported the Algerian FLN, the Cuban Revolution, and the liberation movements in Vietnam and Portuguese Africa. Insisting on the postcolonial character of France after the end of empire, they promoted new forms of cooperation with developing countries and immigrant workers. Examining the work of French leftists in publications such as Partisans, parties such as the PSU, and associations like the Cedetim, Christoph Kalter sheds new light on a crucial moment in France’s history, the global contexts that prompted it, and its worldwide ramifications.\n\nThis chapter studies the history of the Ecuadorian left during the interwar period. It is suggested that the emergence of the Ecuadorian left was rooted in a previous history of democratic politics, associationism, and public sphere formation during the years of the Liberal Party hegemony and the presences of a Radical Political movement in Ecuador (1895-1919). Within the context of the crisis of 1920 the left emerged in democratic societies and among radical intelectual, it combined Republican democratic discourse with the innovation provided by the experience of crisis and by the Russian and Mexican revolutions. The Ecuadorian left had notable successes between the 1920s-1940s, challenging conservative rights, fascism and the threat of the transnational oligarchy; it instigated discourses of the national popular State that successfully connected regional and ethnic identities in the popular imaginary, it promoted popular organization and demanded public recognition of popular causes; and it participated in the political life of the State and its reform. While it had only limited success at the electoral level, it nevertheless maintained a notable presence in the legislative arena, the army, in agrarian politics, labor policy, education and in democratic representation. The left marked the public sphere with a characteristic cultural production that combined notions of radical modernity with notions of popular culture, in the process managing to displace Spanish intellectual currents in these cultural disputes. From the end of the IIWW, the Ecuadorian state formed by the left and by popular struggle became the main target of the counterrevolution, unifying the oligarchies in their attempt to configure a modern right, and catching the attention of the political intelligence agencies of the Western Hemisphere during the Cold War. The left associated with the beginnings of neoliberalism nevertheless maintained a somewhat distrustful gaze upon this previous stage of the national popular left.
