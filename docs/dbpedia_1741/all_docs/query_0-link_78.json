        "text": "The Château du Cayrou is a family-run business of 15 hectares located in the heart of the Cahors appellation. The 17th century château and its park, planted in 1856, nestled in the confines of a meander of the Lot, make it one of the most beautiful wine-producing properties in the appellation. Cayrou means pebbles. The important presence of these pebbles makes the soil very draining. It is this characteristic of the soil which allows to have grapes with an excellent maturity conferring to the tannins a great smoothness. Converted to organic farming in 2009.\n\nTo make excellent wines, you need excellent grapes, which can only be achieved through organic farming; for this reason, Château Morillon began the complete conversion of the estate to organic farming in 2004. In 2007, after 3 years of conversion, the estate obtained the “Bio” certification.\n\nIn 2010, the farm grows to 20 ha. In 2011, the buildings are refurbished to house a second winery, it consists of stainless steel tanks with thermal regulation, with a capacity of 1500 hl, with temperature control system more favorable to the development of wines. A barrel cellar with a capacity of 100 hectoliters and a bottle cellar were also created.\n\nNo chemicals are used at any stage of the production of Château Morillon wines. The only possible treatments of the vine are the authorized products that are copper and sulfur, and in very controlled quantities.\n\nLocated between Toulouse and Montauban, Château Saint Louis is part of the AOP Fronton vineyard, and IGP Comté Tolosan. This region enjoys a temperate climate ideal for the production of high quality wines.\n\nIn application of the official European rules of organic agriculture, Château Saint Louis develops biodiversity by optimizing the natural biological balance within its entire vineyard. From the cultivation of the grapes to the bottling, each operation respects the balance of the wine.\n\nThe wines:\n\nFronton PDO red Chêne de St Louis organic\n\nOrganic red Fronton PDO\n\nFronton PDO red box organic\n\nFronton PDO organic rosé\n\nA family history\n\nSince 1920 and the birth of their first family cannery, the Furic name has been closely linked to the world of fish. La Compagnie Bretonne du Poisson products are the fruit of this expertise resulting from almost a century of working with fish, but also from the desire to keep this profession alive and evolving at the cutting edge of Brittany. The Compagnie Bretonne du Poisson: the expression of the best of the canning trade as seen by the Furic family.\n\nA commitment to quality\n\nFrom the most traditional recipes to the most modern and creative, La Compagnie Bretonne du Poisson guarantees a range of top quality products.\n\nThe Conserverie has received organic certification\n\nOur canned sardines are certified by Bureau Veritas, France (FR-BIO 10). Our ingredients, excluding fish, comply with the specifications of organic farming.\n\nOrtiz is a fine cannery from the Spanish Basque Country, family-run since 1891. Conservas Ortiz is concerned about the future of catches and species recovery efforts. This is why it uses the traditional techniques of live bait and trolling for albacore and seine for anchovy.\n\nAlbacore tuna is an Ortiz speciality, made by hand. They are caught by line, one by one, in the waters of the Gulf of Biscay (Cantabrian Sea) during the summer. Albacore tuna is a white tuna, bonito del norte. It is characterised by its fine flavour, smooth texture and white flesh.\n\nWith olive oil: it enhances the flavour of the tuna and makes it soft.\n\nEscabeche: Typical Mediterranean sauce made with garlic and vinegar.\n\nA wide range of canned fish in organic olive oil (anchovies, sardines, mackerel, albacore tuna and yellowfin tuna), as well as ready-made meals and fish eggs.\n\nSince its creation in 1995, Nautilus has been recognised as the specialist brand for canned shellfish, and stands out in particular for its expertise in crab. With production units all over the world, the Nautilus brand is present in the heart of the fishing grounds in the regions that provide the best crabs. Authentic taste has always been a priority for Nautilus. Thanks to a rigorous selection of the best pieces and a perfect mastery of the canning process, Nautilus crabs retain their original taste and freshness. For you, it is the assurance of finding the quality of an artisanal dish associated with the safety of an industrial product.\n\nDomaine de Mayrac is a 42 hectare vineyard located in the south of France, in the Languedoc Roussillon region, in the Limoux appellation area, on the Haute Vallée terroir. The Mayrac vineyard is planted on deep clay-limestone soils where we have been cultivating all our vines in organic farming since 1987.\n\nOrganic farming is one of the keys to the quality of Domaine de Mayrac wines. The principles of this type of agriculture are both simple and complex: simple because they boil down to excluding the use of synthetic chemicals and weed killers; thus guaranteeing a wine free of this type of residue, whose toxicity for humans is increasingly questioned. Complex because the phytosanitary products used to combat vine diseases are essentially copper and sulphur. The action of these fungicides is limited to a contact effect. They have an essentially preventive effect on diseases; it is therefore the increased knowledge of our vineyard and of diseases that makes it possible to anticipate the risks of a partial or total loss of harvest.\n\nFATTORIE GIACOBAZZI’s organic balsamic vinegars come exclusively from the Modena region in Italy. They are labelled as PGI: Protected Geographical Indication and for the most precious as DOP: Protected Designation of Origin. In this way, they comply very strictly with the extremely restrictive specifications imposed by the label producers in this region.\n\nThe “FATTORIE GIACOBAZZI” factory, well known for the production of balsamic vinegar from Modena, is of course a member of the CABM (Consorzio Aceto Balsamico di Modena PGI) and therefore scrupulously respects the guidelines and conditions of production imposed by the CABM\n\nThe organic balsamic vinegar “3 feuilles” has a strong and harmonious taste with a persistent finish in the mouth, its perfume is intense and full of liveliness.\n\nExceptional organic wines from BERGERAC and MONBAZILLAC.\n\nThe entire property is located on the “molasses inférieures de l’Agenais”, i.e. on carbonated clays and feldspathic micaceous sandstone. One of the particularities of the terroir is to benefit from a very important silica outcrop which gives a certain acidity to the soil. The general exposure is due south and all the plots are on more or less steep slopes.\n\nSince 1997 Grande Maison has been using the Biodynamic method. The work is carried out in accordance with the lunar cycles and preparations and plant purines (nettles, horsetails, ferns) are applied several times during the season. The wines of Grande Maison are all aged in oak barrels for the greatest pleasure of our palate.\n\nOur brewery is located in Loifling, 5 km south of Cham, in the Bavarian Forest and continues a brewing tradition dating back to 1590. The Hofmark Brewery has survived the centuries, thanks to the quality of the beer.\n\nHofmark Organic White Beer has a cloudy appearance with yeast and amber and a stable, airy head in the glass. It has a subtle clove smell and a pleasant wheat aroma. The chest is refreshing and spicy at the same time. The palate is pleasant, surrounded by a discreet hint of hops and makes the beer a harmonious whole.\n\nHofmark Organic lager has a bright golden yellow colour. Fine notes of fruity hops determine its smell. Acidic and pungent, the body builds progressively with a pleasant, sweet bitterness that gives the beer a smooth edge.\n\nHYGIENA has been focusing on the highest quality since 1955. All organic products are therefore certified with the “BLIK” organic guarantee. In addition, these products offer a fully-fledged alternative for all those who care about healthy, high-quality food.\n\nOur unrefined cane sugar is imported from various countries: Mauritius, Reunion, Malawi, Paraguay, Brazil and Ivory Coast. It is incorporated into all kinds of foods by many domestic and foreign companies. HYGIENA is also an important private label packer.\n\nHYGIENA offers a wide range of unrefined cane sugars, also in pieces or organic.\n\nConfiseur chocolatier since 1856 in Le Locle (Switzerland) and later in Morteau (France), Jacques Klaus, recognised as one of the pioneers of Swiss chocolate, extends the reputation of his products thanks to a remarkable entrepreneurial spirit. He industrially developed his activity with a high level of quality and innovation that still makes the reputation of the brand today.\n\nKLAUS is the first chocolate maker to present a range of organic gourmet bars: 100% Organic and 100% Criollo. In an effort to promote the quality of cocoa and to give meaning back to the producers, KLAUS now chooses to select Criollo beans grown according to organic farming criteria.\n\nMakulaku has been developing organic liquorice products since 1994.\n\nTaste has always been the guiding principle in our product development, resulting in a world of colourful and harmonious flavours, offering consumers, in addition to traditional black liquorice, a fascinating new range of flavour combinations.\n\nMakulaku’s main strengths are the knowledge and development of liquorice products. In 1997, Makulaku launched the world’s first organic black liquorice. In 2011, Makulaku was once again the first company to introduce a new product range including organic filled liquorice. Our aim is to continually develop new and improve old.\n\nFlavour is the most important thing, but the quality of our products and services is the cornerstone of everything we do. We use carefully tested, high quality natural ingredients that have been selected in collaboration with our long-term suppliers. The natural ingredients we use do not contain azo dyes.\n\nThe liquorice workshop in Porvoo is new and environmentally friendly. Indeed, geothermal energy is used to heat the plant. We use an ISO 9001 certified quality management system and a HACCP system. The production is also certified organic.\n\nSince 2006, Paradeigma has been designing and developing a range of delicious gluten-free products made from 100% natural, organic ingredients.\n\nBased on rigorously selected flours, its pasta is made fresh and artisanally without the addition of additives in the “pure Italian tradition”.\n\nBronze wire drawing and low temperature drying maintain and enhance their organoleptic qualities: ideal roughness, texture, taste…\n\nDiscover also the gluten-free and allergen-free organic cocoa and souchet spread and the 100% buckwheat flour snacks.\n\nThey are available in 3 delicious recipes:\n\n100% corn pasta\n\npasta with rice (80%) and corn (20%)\n\nCorn (60%), buckwheat (25%) and rice (15%) pasta\n\nFor Turtle, a better world starts at the dinner table.\n\nNothing beats a good start.

We have selected similar plots of land, managed organically, to create our Côtes du Rhône Vieux Truffiers Réserve.\n\nGrape varieties: Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault and Carignan.\n\nTasting: this beautiful ruby red Cuvée is characterized by its nose of red fruits and spices. In the mouth, the tannins are supple, supported by notes of blackberry and redcurrant. The finish is marked by spices.\n\nTo be served with: it will go wonderfully with a rib of beef, a stew or a steak with pepper, and in 2 or 3 years its natural evolution will make it a companion for … truffles.\n\nAgeing: good to drink now, it will keep for 2 to 3 years, protected from light, bottle laid down.\n\nRecommended drinking temperature: 17/18°C"
