        "text": "The Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report 2024, authored by cultural economist Dr. Clare McAndrew, is now available. This comprehensive report delves into the sales and various activities across different segments of the market, including galleries, auction houses, and art fairs. Key Findings: - The global art market showed resilience with sales reaching USD 65 billion, a slight 4% slowdown year-on-year, yet surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Growth in buyer activity was particularly pronounced at lower price levels. - The US maintained its leading position in the global art market, accounting for 42% of sales, while China emerged as the second-largest market with a 19% share. - Global online sales have increased by 7% year-on-year, reaching an estimated USD 11.8 billion, with the most significant growth driven by dealers‚Äô own online channels and websites. - The fine art auction market saw a substantial decrease in the USD 10 million-plus segment, with growth in mid and lower-priced segments. #artcollecting #artexhibition #artmuseum #artinvesting #artinvestment #artcollector #artnews #artworld #artmarket #artmarketnews #artauction #artgallery #artfair #arthistory #artworld #fair #worldrecord #modernart #impressionism #postwar #contemporaryart #artbasel #marketreport #ubs\n\nWhen we look at activations like the one mentioned in Stephanie Hirschmiller's article, we reinforce the discussion of Art being appropriated as a medium for innovation - over and over again. In one hand it is always positive to see Art expanding the conversation of new tech, in the other hand sometimes it makes serious debates to be softened, because we often associate Arts & Culture with positive dynamics. Fashion is expanding its presence within the \"lifestyle\" realm (debate started by theorists on 1980s), in which luxury is not only about the products, but about the culture and the overall behaviour of a community. Thus, I was very please to see this activation by LVMH Guerlain, validating what generations of new media artists have being since late 1980s. And it reminds me other key projects. Such as the early 2010s project, created by Milton Sogabe and his team - SciArts - called METACAMPO (Stephanie Hirschmiller you should definitely check, it is sublime). Check it out in the video: https://lnkd.in/dPDwsCze And the superb work Fragile Creatures by DRIFT Studio, that can never be forgotten and it is one of the most delicate pieces I ever saw. Check it out in the video: https://lnkd.in/da2BRnj8 I hope to see more the arts bringing deeper meaning to products and experiences, but for that we need to keep working in connecting art community with innovation opportunities. Artists are above everything hackers of our dreams, disruptors of the status quo and warriors of the tomorrow lands. So let's make sure artists are highlighted and valued as they deserve. I include myself as a hacker artists, and I would love to hear from others! Are you an artists? Are you trying new things? #luxuryfashion #digitalart #metaverse #iot #digitalfashion\n\nThe Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report 2024, authored by cultural economist Dr. Clare McAndrew, is now available.

Come with us to the London Art Fair. This fair is quite exciting for a number of reasons. Firstly, it‚Äôs the inaugural art event of the new year, effectively reviving the art market. The galleries are showcasing works from prominent artists and reflecting the latest trends from the previous year. However, the standout feature is undoubtedly the impressive prints that are on display. This is particularly significant as it offers a more accessible entry point into the art market for new collectors. The print market is a dynamic segment of the art market that is rapidly gaining popularity, positioning it as a sector to watch closely in 2024.\n\nArt Basel happening right now in Switzerland, is the cr√®me de la cr√®me of contemporary art fairs. But why is Art Basel so important anyway? Here‚Äôs what you should know üëá Since Art Basel‚Äôs founding nearly 40 years ago, the number of art fairs has exploded to over 200 each year! Still, it maintains its position as one of the premier art events in the world. This fair is a powerful platform that brings together artists, galleries, and collectors from around the world. With 200 galleries and 4,000 artists from five continents, it increases visibility for those participating and has a considerable impact on the art market. Simply put, Art Basel shapes what's hot and what's not in the art world. For example, street art and graffiti became recognised art forms after they were showcased at Art Basel Miami Beach. Remember Maurizio Cattelan‚Äôs banana duct-taped to a wall? That happened at Art Basel 2019 and became internationally famous (or infamous?). Fun fact, it was sold for $120,000! üçåüí∞ All this is very exciting for galleries like Chemould Prescott Road and Experimenter who will be representing India at Art Basel. This is a big deal because it puts Indian contemporary artists on the global stage ‚Äî as it should be. My one criticism of Art Basel is that it is simply not cheap. Participating in such a huge art fair can cost well over $275,000, which often prevents smaller galleries from attending. What do you think about the impact of Art Basel on the art world? Is it worth the hype?

Yet, this year‚Äôs edition pointed in several directions: depending on who you talk to and what articles you read, you may get a different idea of the fair‚Äôs success. While the general tone is positive, and especially established art and institutionally backed emerging art thrived in Basel, others saw the consequences of a cautious market and a buyers‚Äô market. There are also voices saying that the shrinking of the main fair in Basel is an internal move: is the main shareholder of the fair deliberately cannibalizing Art Basel, Basel in favor of Art Basel, Paris? Read our full analysis of the fair's performance at the link below. #ArtBasel #ArtBasel2024 #ArtMarket\n\nMeet Hong Kong-born art gallerist and curator, Pearl Lam. She sits down with Spear's to talk about the impact of Chinese culture on art, her former career as a property developer and the strengthening Asian art market. 'The Asian market is growing, but the balance of power remains tilted to the West. The format of museums and art galleries is established by the West, the most prominent art fairs are in Europe and the largest market is in America,' Lam says. 'In Asia, it‚Äôs in vogue to talk about Western art, and buyers follow the trends Americans set. For instance, African contemporary art is taking off across the USA so Asian buyers have followed suit. Is this pattern likely to change? Possibly, but it‚Äôs all about confidence. When the Asian market gains this confidence, they‚Äôll realise they don‚Äôt need to follow; they can lead.' Click the link below to read the full article."
