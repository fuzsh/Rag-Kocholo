        "text": "List of works with incomplete provenance from 1933–1945\n\nIn the light of concern that some works of art now in public collections may have been improperly acquired during the period 1933–1945, without restitution having been made, the National Gallery has paid particular attention to the whereabouts of its paintings during those years.\n\nPart of the National Gallery's normal work is to investigate the whereabouts of its paintings from the time they were painted until the time they entered the Gallery's collection.\n\nThis may reveal material of great historical interest concerning, for example, the identity of the painter, the purpose for which the picture was painted, and changing patterns of collecting taste.\n\nIn March 1999, with the cooperation of the Gallery, The Art Newspaper published an initial list of paintings in the Gallery with incomplete provenance information for the period 1933–1945. Since then the Gallery's research has continued and the list has been updated from time to time and made available to any member of the public on request.\n\nAs at 17 December 2018, the Gallery had not received any claims asserting on behalf of another or others that any of the paintings on its list was looted or otherwise improperly acquired, nor was it aware of any such claim in process.\n\nIf further information is needed in respect of any particular painting, please in the first instance email information@nationalgallery.org.uk\n\n*Early provenances for pictures are not given.
