        "text": "The notion of a triangulated category was introduced independently in algebraic geometry by Jean-Louis Verdier, based on ideas of Alexander Grothendieck, and in algebraic topology by Dieter Puppe. These constructions have since played a crucial role in representation theory (derived and stable module categories), algebraic geometry (derived categories of coherent sheaves, theory of motives), commutative algebra, algebraic topology (stable homotopy theory) and other areas of mathematics (and even theoretical physics).\n\nA triangulated category is an additive category with extra structure. Let T be an additive category, that is, a category whose morphism sets are abelian groups, and in which composition of morphisms is bilinear. Furthermore, let Σ: T → T be an automorphism on T, an invertible endofunctor. A sequence\n\nA → B → C → ΣA"
