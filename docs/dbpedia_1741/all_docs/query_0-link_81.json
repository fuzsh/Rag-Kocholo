        "text": "Created in the nineteenth century, the earliest date known to date of the mark Arbalet dates back to 1810.\n\nSince the creation of the crossbow company G. David in 1922, three generations of master cutlers have succeeded one another.\n\nCrossbow G. David is the reference in terms of creation and design with the Janus de l'Industrie.\n\nThe whole of its range is produced in the region of Thiers, guaranteeing a 100% French manufacturing.\n\nOnly the sharp knives of the crossbow on the blade are the real Laguiole G. David knives manufactured by the manufacture G. Balbalète David in Thiers. Other brands and resellers use the name \"David\", we invite you to be vigilant.\n\nGenès David de Granetias founded his company in 1922. He took over the Arbalète brand, registered in 1810, which belonged to one of these ancestors.\n\nHe mainly manufactures regional knives such as le Thiers, Pradel, Yssingeaux, Aurillac, London…\n\nBut Genès David is particularly fond of the Laguiole which he developed more and more from 1930. This will be worth the brand to be known for its laguioles and Aveyron or laguioles of the poor (the Aveyron is a laguiole without flies).\n\nHis son Jean-Louis succeeded him and considerably developed the production of Laguiole in the Thiers basin. The range of laguiole knives is taking off."
