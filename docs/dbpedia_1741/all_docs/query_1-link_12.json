        "text": "This is briefly described in Baez's week257 as well as in a post on lieven le bruyn's blog. I do not think there is a particularly elementary explanation here, but as I understand it there are three basic ideas:\n\nFrom the point of view of étale cohomology, $\\text{Spec } \\mathbb{Z}$ is like a $3$-manifold. I confess I don't really understand what this means, although there is a nice heuristic explanation in the last bit of week257. Apparently it means there is an analogue of Poincaré duality in this setting with $n = 3$.\n\nIn fact, it is like a $3$-manifold with trivial fundamental group, so is like the $3$-sphere $S^3$.\n\nThe category of finite extensions of a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ looks exactly like the category of finite covers of the circle $S^1$; there's exactly one extension / cover for every positive integer $n$ with automorphism group $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$. So the map $\\text{Spec } \\mathbb{F}_p \\to \\text{Spec } \\mathbb{Z}$ is supposed to look like an inclusion of $S^1$ into $S^3$, which is a knot.\n\nAs for why we are interested in studying these analogies... I don't know about you, but I find this connection inherently interesting. Analogies of this kind have traditionally been very fruitful for both of the fields they connect in mathematics; if nothing else, it's nice to have a different source of intuition and motivation to make conjectures from."
