        "text": "Study design and patients\n\nThe primary objective of this national, prospective, observational study was to estimate the costs of treating patients with rhAPC and to compare these with the costs of treating patients without using rhAPC. The secondary objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of rhAPC in real-life clinical practice. In the present study, effectiveness was estimated for the purposes of economical analyses only [16]; the efficacy of rhAPC has already been demonstrated in the PROWESS study [6]. No randomization was conducted so that none of the patients included after the treatment was made available on the French market suffered a loss of opportunity. In addition, because the costs were to be estimated in patients to whom rhAPC was prescribed in a real-life management setting, it was essential that the study interfered as little as possible with intensive care physicians' practices [17]. External validity (the ability of a study to yield results that are reproducible in other studies) was given preference over internal validity (the ability of a study to provide results that truly reflect the variables measured). Therefore, rather than reproducing the results of PROWESS, we aimed in the present study to ensure that its results could be generalized to routine intensive care practice throughout France.\n\nA pre-post design was considered to be the most appropriate. Patients were included before (pre-license study phase) and after (post-license study phase) rhAPC had been made available in France (January 2003). Inclusion/exclusion criteria were defined in accordance with the rhAPC (Xigris®) label approved in the European Union. Eli-Lilly Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. Collected data included demographic factors; clinical information and use of resources on admission, at enrolment and during the hospital course; and outcome at 28 days.\n\nBased on estimated average costs of €31,800 and €39,500, respectively, in the pre-license and post-license phases (according to a French pharmaco-economic model [18]) and assuming a normal distribution of the costs, accrual of 340 patients was required in each study phase to detect a difference of €7,700 in the average costs with a first-degree risk α of 0.05 and a power β of 0.80. If the study objective had been to detect a difference of effectiveness (mortality), then we estimate from the PROWESS results that 600 patients per phase would have been required.\n\nThe two French Intensive Care Societies launched the study in 2002, at the request of the Health Ministry. Because the study did not influence the practices of the intensive care physicians, approval of an ethics committee was not required.\n\nEstimation and comparison of costs\n\nCost analyses were conducted from the point of view of the health care provider because treatment of patients with severe sepsis is almost exclusively dispensed by hospital services. Complete hospitalization costs were estimated from the College of Intensive Care Database Users (CUB-Rea) database [23] and from a multiple regression equation derived from a micro-costing study, based on 211 stays in intensive care unit (ICU) in 1996 in France [24]. The French information system used for medico-economic description and measurement of hospital activity (Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information], which is based on medical unit summaries (Résumés d'Unité Médicale), provided the following data: age, sex, length of stay, diagnoses on admission and at discharge, and diagnostic/therapeutic procedures performed. The CUB-Rea database provided the following specific intensive care indicators: Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score, Omega score, McCabe score and admission type. Hospitalization costs considered in the micro-costing study included ICU costs and post-intensive care costs. The ICU costs can be subdivided into variable direct costs, such as tests (laboratory and imaging), small materials, drugs and blood products, and time spent by care staff (state registered nurse and health care assistant); fixed direct costs, such as time spent by medical nursing staff (calculated on a pro rata basis for the length of stay); and variable indirect costs such as restaurant services, laundry, pharmacy and administration. Post-intensive care costs are based on number of days, valued using the departmental tariff category.\n\nThe equation obtained [14] had a good determination coefficient (R2 = 93%) and was expressed as follows:\n\nCC = β0 + (β1 × LOS) + (β2 × LOS × 1DCR = 1) + (β3 × ΩTOT) + (β4 × [SAPS2]2) + (β5 × 1DCR = 1)\n\nWhere CC is the total complete cost of the hospital stay (in 1996 French Francs), LOS is the length of stay in the ICU, ΩTOT is the total Omega score, SAPS2 is the SAPS II score, 1DCR=1 is the variable indicating death during intensive care, β0 is -8,881.50, β1 is 5,465.60, β2 is 3,715.10, β3 is 183.75, β4 is 5.27 and β5 is -18,078.50.\n\nThe way in which the equation was formulated implies that, for a short length of stay (<5 days), the cost incurred by survivors was greater than that generated by patients who die in intensive care. Beyond that given threshold, patients who eventually died in intensive care incurred increasing costs as their length of stay increased.\n\nThis general equation applied both to patients suffering from severe sepsis and to those suffering from other diseases, but it did not take into account the medical costs associated with administration of rhAPC. The acquisition costs of rhAPC were therefore added to the complete hospitalization costs, assuming that all of the connate costs associated with rhAPC administration (adverse events, longer term follow up and so on) were incorporated into the equation through the Omega score, the SAPS II score and the length of stay in intensive care. This was an essential assumption because it ensured that the total cost of patients receiving care with rhAPC was not underestimated. It was also a realistic assumption, because these three indicators were designed to represent activity in intensive care.\n\nThe year 2004 was chosen to harmonize all of the costs that have been calculated in this study because the most recent data available are for those patients admitted during that this year. The CUB-Rea equation was initially expressed in 1996 French Francs and inflation rates from the Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques (INSEE) [25] were used to obtain nominal values for 2002, 2003 and 2004. All costs were then discounted for the year 2004, using a discount rate of 3.5%.\n\nCost comparisons were performed using the nonparametric bootstrap method [26], because cost variables are often asymmetric. A total of 10,000 samples of size n (starting sample size) obtained from the empirical distribution function of costs was generated by drawing, with replacement, n individuals randomly from the initial sample. The mean costs in each bootstrap sample were calculated for both groups, together with the difference between the two mean costs. We then tested whether this difference was significantly different from 0.\n\nEstimation of effectiveness\n\nThe effectiveness metric was life expectancy at 28 days after onset of sepsis. However, this data point was not directly available because only mortality at 28 days was recorded in the case report forms. The life expectancy of survivors was therefore estimated using the McCabe score. A set of assumptions was made [14]. First, patients suffering from a short-term fatal disease (1 year) were allocated a life expectancy of 0.5 years. Second, the life expectancy of patients suffering from a long-term fatal disease (5 years) was estimated to be 3 years. Third, the life expectancy of patients without fatal co-morbidities was calculated from the life expectancy of the French general population published in the INSEE tables [27], grouped by age and sex for the year 2003. One study [28] estimated that the life expectancy of patients who had suffered severe sepsis was reduced by half as compared with people of the same age and sex in the general population. The life expectancy extracted from the INSEE tables was therefore divided by 2 for this patient category.\n\nLife expectancy was then adjusted with respect to quality of life to obtain a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained outcome. Studies evaluating quality of life after intensive care stay reported a range of coefficients from 0.6 to above 0.8 [8,9,29,30]. The lowest coefficient (0.6) was used in the present study.\n\nAlthough most analysts agree that costs should be discounted in any study that is conducted over a period of longer than 1 year, there is no consensus on whether the consequences or benefits of intervention should be discounted and at what rate. It was therefore decided not to discount the measure of effectiveness.\n\nHospital course, burden of care and costs\n\nTable summarizes hospital course, burden of care and costs in the matched population. Patients in the post-license phase stayed longer in the ICU (24.4 days versus 21.3 days, P = 0.002) and tended to stay longer in hospital (40.4 days versus 37.9 days, P = 0.09) than did those in the pre-license phase. The burden of care was higher in the post-license phase, as assessed using the relative cost index (2,862 versus 2,430, P < 0.05) and the Omega score (427 versus 373, P < 0.05). A multivariate model showed that the increase in burden of care (measured by relative cost indices) was essentially due to the increase in length of stay in the ICU (P < 0.0001). However, after adjustment on the length of stay in the ICU, the difference between both study phases in the burden of care remained statistically significant (P = 0.048). Similar results were found when the burden of care was measured using the Omega score. The burden of care during the post-license phase when using rhAPC was therefore higher, due to both length of stay in the ICU and daily resource utilization.\n\nTable 3\n\nAll patients (n = 840)Survivors (n = 471)Nonsurvivors (n = 369)Pre-licensePost-licensePre-Post license difference (95% CI)Pre-licensePost-licensePre-Post license difference (95% CI)Pre-licensePost-licensePre-Post license difference (95% CI)Omega score373427*54 (9.12 to 98.03)38043353 (-10 to 112)36441854 (-13 to 121)Reference cost index2,4302,862*432 (187 to 662)2,2542,667*†413 (96 to 722)2,6483,121*†473 (9 to 936)ICU stay (day)21.324.4*3.1 (0.32 to 5.92)23.826.7†2.9 (-0.90 to 6.57)18.221.3†3.1 (-0.89 to 7.25)Hospital stay (day)37.940.42.5 (-1.79 to 6.84)49.251.1†1.9 (-4.41 to 8.37)24.627.5†2.9 (-2.02 to 7.95)Costs -rhAPC (€)36,71741,1444,427 (-85 to 8,991)35,57539,1723,597 (-1,737 to 8,680)38,09543,7295,634 (-2,005 to 13,380)Total costs (€)36,71747,870*11,153 (6,601 to 15,709)35,57546,752*11,177 (5,863 to 16,313)38,09549,336*11,241 (3,433 to 19,084)\n\nThe increase in drug costs observed in the post-license phase was related not only to the acquisition of rhAPC itself (€6,717 on average) but also to that of other therapies, including antimicrobial agents (€1,900 versus €1,321, P < 0.05). Blood and plasma transfusion costs were also higher in the post-license phase (€1,043 versus €751, P < 0.05), the occurrence of transfusions being essentially due to the bleeding events observed (at least one event for 21.67% versus 13.57% of patients; P < 0.05). Overall, complete hospitalization costs were higher in the post-license phase (€47,870 versus €36,717, P < 0.05). Sixty per cent of this difference was attributable to the rhAPC acquisition costs.\n\nWhen survivors and nonsurvivors in the post-license phase were compared (Table ), the length of stay in ICU and hospital was lower in nonsurvivors (P < 0.05). However, the total hospitalization costs in the post-license phase, whether rhAPC acquisition costs were included or not, were similar in survivors and nonsurvivors.\n\nTarget for rhAPC treatment in clinical practice and selection bias\n\nICU physicians enrolled patients using the same inclusion/exclusion criteria (defined according to the approved rhAPC label) throughout the study. However, patients in the post-license phase (that is, patients who received rhAPC) were younger and had fewer underlying diseases but more organ failures at study entry than those in the pre-license phase (initial cohort). We speculate that the physicians, when giving such an expensive drug carrying increased risk for bleeding, excluded the very elderly (>80 years), patients with advanced underlying disease (McCabe 3) and patients with fewer than three organ failures, in order to target treatment to the most severely ill patients with reasonable life expectancy if they survived the episode of severe sepsis. It is interesting to note that rhAPC was not over-used, even though two-thirds of the drug acquisition costs were met by the Ministry of Health throughout the study.\n\nThe markedly longer period of recruitment after the French license had been obtained (24 months versus 6 months for the pre-license phase) also advocates for increased selection of patients to receive rhAPC. Furthermore, although the occurrence of all bleeding events differed significantly between the two phases (13.6% versus 21.7%), it was still less than that observed in the patients with multiple organ failure in the PROWESS trial in both placebo and rhAPC groups (17.9 versus 25.4%) [7]. This could either be due to the fact that, in our observational study, adverse events were not reported as rigorously as in a trial setting or (more likely) to selection of patients with no serious risk for bleeding in real-life clinical practice.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the reduction in 28-day mortality in the post-license phase, when rhAPC was used, was modest despite the fact that a markedly larger proportion of patients were treated with low-dose steroids in the post-license phase than in the pre-license phase (80.5% versus 55.0%, P < 0.0001), probably linked to the higher severity of illness. Indeed, low doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone have been shown to reduce significantly the risk for death in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency, without increasing adverse events [35]. No interaction between steroids and rhAPC has been reported to our knowledge, and in the PROWESS trial mortality was lower with rhAPC than with placebo, whether steroids were given at baseline or during the infusion period, or were not given at all [36,37].\n\nRelation to other studies\n\nThe present study confirms the discrepancy that is often observed between rigorously planned clinical trials and real-life clinical practice. Cost-effectiveness of rhAPC in our study was less favourable than that described previously in the literature. However, and in contrast with our study, all other studies used the effectiveness data of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial PROWESS [6]. For comparison, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per life-year gained and per QALY gained were €20,278 and €33,797, respectively, in the present study. In the other studies, the ratio in the most severely ill patients (APACHE II score > 24 for North America, and multiple organ failure for Europe) was around US$15,000 in the North American studies [8-11] and €13,000 in the European studies [12-14] per life-year gained. The corresponding values per QALY gained were US$30,000 and €22,000, respectively.\n\nThe greater cost-effectiveness ratio obtained in the present study was due to a lower absolute reduction in the 28-day mortality between matched groups when compared with PROWESS (-3.3% versus -6.1% overall and -7.7% in the subgroup with multiple organ failure) [6,7] rather than to hospital costs. This was unexpected. Indeed, the very severely ill patients theoretically represented a population more likely than the PROWESS global population to benefit from rhAPC, because reduction in mortality was demonstrated to be the highest in patients with an APACHE II score greater than 24 [38] and those with multiple organ failure enrolled in PROWESS [7]. When compared with the global population [6] and the subgroup with multiple organ failure [7] of PROWESS, the 840 patients in the matched population of PREMISS had different baseline characteristics. They exhibited higher predicted mortality (61.3% in PREMISS versus 52.6% in PROWESS global and 55.9% in PROWESS multiple organ failure, calculated using the mean SAPS II or APACHE II score) and a higher number of organ failures (3.20 versus 2.40 and 2.92, respectively), although neurological failure was not taken into account in the present study. Also, our study population included a greater proportion of patients undergoing mechanically ventilation patients (94.6% versus 75.5% and 81.1%), a greater proportion of patients with shock (94.3% versus 71.0% and 82.4%) and a greater proportion of patients requiring vasopressor agents (88.6% versus 70.9% and 72.7%).\n\nThis discrepancy may be explained as follows. First, the effect of rhAPC on mortality might be limited in the most severely ill patients. However, this hypothesis would not be consistent with the PROWESS subgroup analyses [38], which showed that absolute reduction in 28-day mortality was lower in patients with failure of one or two organs (1.7% and 5.3%, respectively) than in patients with failure of three or four organs (8.2% and 7.9%, respectively). Second, the small recruitment bias that persisted after the matching process may be responsible for the apparent lower efficacy of the drug when compared with the findings in PROWESS. This is unlikely because the only variables concerned exhibited small standardized differences (below 15%) and should counterbalance each other; the very elderly (more numerous by 14.9% pre-license) are more vulnerable than the youngest, whereas nonventilated patients (more numerous by 10.1% pre-license) are less vulnerable than mechanically ventilated patients. Third, physicians might have delayed administration of rhAPC after sepsis onset in the face of a transient stabilization of the patient after conventional treatment. Indeed, the drug when administered after the first 24 hours of the onset of sepsis has been shown to have apparently lower efficacy [39,40]. However, 70% of the patients enrolled in the post-license phase received rhAPC within the first day of admission to the ICU.\n\nA fourth reason for the discrepancy between the findings of PREMISS and those of PROWESS is that the decrease in mortality observed in PROWESS might have overestimated the real effect of the drug. This is because the proportions of patients who had septic shock, who were being treated with vasopressor agents, who were receiving mechanical ventilation, or who suffered from underlying diseases, were higher in the placebo group than in the rhAPC group [6]. Larger differences in baseline underlying diseases were observed in the placebo subgroup with multiple organ failure [7], in particular in liver and cardiovascular diseases, which are known to have a strong influence on mortality rates in patients with severe sepsis after the first 3 days [3,4]. Although no difference was statistically significant, these imbalances slightly favour the rhAPC group, especially in patients with multiple organ failure [36,41]. The findings of our study may therefore represent the real-life reduction in mortality resulting from rhAPC use.\n\nThe greater cost-effectiveness ratio observed compared with other studies might also be due to increased hospital costs, but to a limited extent only. In the matched population, rhAPC added to best standard care significantly increased resource use and total hospital costs in both survivors and nonsurvivors of severe sepsis with multiple organ failure. This was related to both greater length of ICU stay and more intense daily intensive care. Among the seven economic studies evaluating rhAPC, only that of Angus and coworkers [9] reported on hospital course and burden of care (assessed using the 28-item version of Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System). No differences between the placebo and treatment groups were observed for the length of ICU stay or the burden of care in the cost cohort (US patients of the PROWESS trial). The reason for these apparently conflicting results is unknown. We presume that the rhAPC-related improvement in status of our very severely ill patients required a longer ICU stay and greater intensity of daily intensive care than in the PROWESS trial. However, the incremental cost per patient treated was similar in both studies (US$9,800 versus €11,153) and was significantly different only when the acquisition cost of the drug was taken into account in the hospitalization costs."
