        "text": "What Is Christopher Reid's Net Worth?\n\nChristopher Reid is an actor, rapper, comedian, and producer who has a net worth of $700 thousand. Christopher \"Kid\" Reid is probably best known as a member of the rap duo Kid 'n Play (alongside Christopher Martin), and they have released the albums \"2 Hype\" (1988), \"Funhouse\" (1990), and \"Face the Nation\" (1991). Kid 'n Play had two #1 singles on the Hot Rap Songs chart, 1990's \"Funhouse (The House We Dance In)\" and 1991's \"Ain't Gonna Hurt Nobody.\" The two co-starred in the animated series \"Kid 'n Play\" (1990), the animated special \"Freaknik: The Musical\" (2010), the TV movie \"Bodyguards\" (1993) and the films \"House Party\" (1990), \"House Party 2\" (1991), \"Class Act\" (1992), \"House Party 3\" (1994), \"House Party: Tonight's the Night\" (2013), and the 2023 \"House Party\" remake. Reid has more than 30 acting credits to his name, including the films \"Sword of Honor\" (1996), \"Pauly Shore Is Dead\" (2003), and \"War of the Worlds 2: The Next Wave\" (2008), the TV movies \"Border Line\" (1999) and \"Funny Business\" (2014), the miniseries \"The Temptations\" (1998), and the television series \"Sister, Sister\" (1996–1997), \"Barbershop\" (2005), and \"Black Dynamite\" (2012; 2014). He also served as an associate producer on \"Sword of Honor.\"\n\nEarly Life\n\nChristopher Reid was born on April 5, 1964, in the Bronx, New York. His mother, Marjorie Wallace, was Irish, and his father, Calvin Reid, was Jamaican. Christopher attended the Bronx High School of Science, graduating in 1982. He enrolled at Miles College in Fairfield, Alabama, then he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the Bronx's Lehman College in 1990.\n\nKid 'n Play\n\nAfter Reid formed Kid 'n Play with Christopher \"Play\" Martin, the duo released the album \"2 Hype\" on October 21, 1988. The album reached #9 on the \"Billboard\" Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and #96 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart and was certified Gold. The single \"Rollin' with Kid 'n Play\" reached #2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Rap Songs chart and #11 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. They followed their successful debut with the Gold album \"Funhouse\" in 1990, and it peaked at #11 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and #58 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. The single \"Funhouse (The House We Dance In)\" was a #1 hit on the Hot Rap Songs chart. The third Kid 'n Play album, \"Face the Nation,\" was released in 1991. The album reached #27 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and #144 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, and it featured the single \"Ain't Gonna Hurt Nobody,\" which topped the Hot Rap Songs chart. The single reached #7 in New Zealand, and it was the duo's first single to chart on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 (#51).\n\nAn animated \"Kid 'n Play\" series aired on NBC in 1990, and Reid and Martin co-starred in the films \"House Party\" (1990), \"House Party 2\" (1991), and \"House Party 3\" (1994) and had cameos in 2013's \"House Party: Tonight's the Night\" and the 2023 \"House Party\" remake. The \"House Party\" soundtrack reached #20 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and the \"House Party 2\" soundtrack peaked at #23 on that chart. In 2022, \"House Party\" was preserved in the Library of Congress' National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" Reid and Martin also appeared in the 1992 comedy \"Class Act,\" a retelling of \"The Prince and the Pauper,\" and in a 2014 RadioShack ad that aired during Super Bowl XLVIII. In 2023, they starred in a Progressive commercial.\n\nChristopher has also appeared in the films \"Sword of Honor\" (1996), \"Pauly Shore Is Dead\" (2003) and \"War of the Worlds 2: The Next Wave\" (2008) and the TV movies \"Border Line\" (1999) and \"Funny Business\" (2014). In 1998, he played radio DJ Joltin' Joe in the miniseries \"The Temptations,\" which won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Television Movie or Mini-Series and earned a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Miniseries and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television. Reid has guest-starred on \"Minor Adjustments\" (1996), \"Smart Guy\" (1997), \"Sister, Sister\" (1996–1997), \"V.I.P.\" (2000), \"That's Life\" (2001), \"Barbershop\" (2005), \"Supah Ninjas\" (2011), and Black Dynamite\" (2012; 2014). He also wrote the theme song for the HBO talk show \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" which began airing in 2003. In 2023, Christopher was featured in the docuseries \"Rewind the '90s.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nReid married Kimberly Turner on June 19, 2004, and they welcomed daughters Christina, Cameron, and Cailin together. A 2021 article on BlackDoctor.org described Christopher as \"happily divorced.\" In the past, he has suffered from cataracts. According to Southern California's ABC7, Dr. Paul Dougherty \"treated Reid with cutting-edge technology that involves no incisions: The eye lens is removed completely, using lasers, and replaced with a high-tech implant.\" Christopher was previously legally blind, but the day after the procedure, he \"awoke with 20/20 vision.\" Reid offered the advice, \"Do not kid and play with your eyes. We need these.\" In 2010, Christopher got himself in a little trouble with the law for driving while intoxicated. He was put on probation but didn't appear before the judge to prove he had finished his probationary period, and a warrant was issued. Reid was arrested and jailed in 2011 but was soon released.\n\nAward Nominations\n\nIn 1991, Reid earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Male Lead for \"House Party.\" In 1993, he received a Kids' Choice Award nomination for Favorite Movie Actor."
