        "text": "Professor Chris Reid is Research lead of the Epilepsy Mission, member of Faculty and Head of the Neurophysiology of Excitable Networks Laboratory at The Florey. He is a translational neuroscientist and leads a multidisciplinary team that investigates the molecular and cellular causes of epilepsy.\n\nHis team includes 3 research fellows, 3 PhD students and a Research Assistant. Key work includes developing and characterising new genetic rodent models of epilepsy and identifying new molecular targets for treating this devastating disease. This includes roles of ‘pacemaker’ hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) channels in seizure susceptibility.\n\nProfessor Reid has strong engagement with industry and clinical partners providing a translational path. This includes past collaborations with the BioCurate and CSL. He also contributes significantly to the neuroscience community acting as Director of the Australian Course in Advanced Neuroscience (from 2020) and sitting on International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and American Epilepsy Society (AES) Genetic Task Forces.\n\nHis vision is to continue to drive pre-clinical programs that will create and validate therapeutic strategies targeted at ion channels in epilepsy and other neurological disorders.\n\nResources\n\nNew targets for epilepsy treatment podcast – Professor Reid discusses developing new drugs for epilepsy, focusing on both genetics and small molecules, to treat more people with epilepsy\n\nWatch him working to develop new therapeutics for epilepsy\n\nKey collaborators:"
