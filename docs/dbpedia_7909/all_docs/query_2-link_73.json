        "text": "An encampment off Solano Boulevard and Sereno Drive was cleared Wednesday morning, signaling the motions of a homeless plan that has still yet to be written by the city.\n\nAssistant City Manager Natalie Peterson says there are zero shelter beds available in the city, or accessible to the city via county resources. Peterson said there is no official plan yet, not for a few weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, the city is still moving ahead with clearing encampments on public property across the city, in light of the controversial Supreme Court decision in Grants Pass v. Johnson.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling, the Court determined that cities can enforce anti-camping bans even if there are no available shelters for homeless individuals. Justice Neil Gorsuch, along with the court’s conservative justices, concluded that these bans do not violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nCity manager Andrew Murray, who was at the site briefly, declined to answer any Times-Herald questions, deferring all questions to Peterson.\n\n“Where the f— are we going?” said one resident while clearing out belongings.\n\nThat answer is likely just another public spot.\n\nThe city is aware that there are no shelter beds, and while Peterson said they had offered “housing options” in the past, it wasn’t clear where that would be. Especially since shelter space has been severely limited for years due in part to the delayed Navigation Center and also to rising homelessness in the city.\n\nPeterson said the city contacted Transformation Village, formerly the Christian Help Center, inquiring about open space. Transformation Village, a “dorm setting shelter” operated by the Solano Dream Center, requires people to be ambulatory and asks for 30% of an individual’s income for residency, according to the shelter’s website.\n\nThe shelter offers 28-day emergency shelter, but program director Terry Hatchell says some people don’t end up staying there due to rules regarding sobriety. While the village does take in families, Hatchell said children over the age of eight must be moved to the dorms of their respective sex, which can often deter single mothers from taking shelter there.\n\nHatchell said that as of Wednesday, they have no open beds. When asked if the people being cleared from the camp today had any shelter at all to go to, Peterson’s answer was clear.\n\n“Today, no.”\n\nBari Reid said she had an RV and truck trailer parked at the site, but was out early Wednesday morning to clear her vehicles and belongings before the public works crews came through. Reid said she didn’t think they would get pushed off the site as it’s not blocking entry to the stores on either side of the camp, but when the notices went up, she was quick to comply.\n\n“I don’t want to be in their numbers,” Reid said of city officials and police. “It’s not their fault I’m living this way.”\n\nFor Reid, it’s on to the next site — even if it’s not clear where yet.\n\nFormer housing commissioner Joey Carrizales, who was at the clearing helping residents clean and load up, said there’s a rumor circulating around homeless groups that the Solano County Fairgrounds will be opened to camp. Reid had mentioned that rumor when speaking to the Times-Herald as well.\n\nCarrizales, concerned it could lead to harsher criticism of the homeless and crackdowns from law enforcement, tries to dispel the whispers as they come up,.\n\nCity staff is considering proposing designated camping sites. But such a plan would have to get approval from city council. The council has previously rejected such a policy, including 11 designated sites in 2020 and another in late 2021.\n\nReid said she liked the idea of a designated site, saying she would manage one herself if given the choice.\n\nAs for Vanessa Gomez and her family of six, including four girls, the only option they have is to find another spot on the street. For the past year, she said her family has stayed at the spot on Sereno, but haven’t received any housing offers. The family was allowed to drive their RV out of the encampment area.\n\nPeterson said that when homeless people at these sites notify where they’ll likely camp, she tries to give a heads up not to camp at sites that are going to be cleared soon.\n\nWith no shelter space, no plan and clearings moving ahead, the only option now for the unhoused is to pick another street site and bide their time.\n\n“It’s not helping people in encampments,” Carrizales said. “The SCOTUS decision gave power to these shameful actions.”"
