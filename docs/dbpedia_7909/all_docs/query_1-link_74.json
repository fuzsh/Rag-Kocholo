        "text": "Christopher Reid undertakes a broad range of commercial work both domestically and internationally, and in both litigation and arbitration.\n\nIn line with Chambers’ profile, he has a particular expertise in the areas of energy, construction, and engineering. Christopher frequently acts as junior counsel as part of large teams in high-value disputes, which are often factually, legally and technically complex. In addition, he regularly acts as sole counsel representing and advising a range of clients in these fields, as well as in general commercial and professional liability disputes. Christopher has been a contributing editor to the 13th and 14th editions of Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts, and is listed as a Leading Junior by The Legal 500 (UK Bar 2023).\n\nChristopher has substantial arbitration experience of disputes arising in both the Middle East and the Far East. Recent examples in the Middle East include being led in a circa SAR 1.2 billion Saudi law dispute, seated in Cairo, concerning the construction of a major international airport in Saudi Arabia; and an AED 1.6 billion dispute, seated in Abu Dhabi, over the Employer’s right to deduct liquidated damages from a contractor for delay in the construction of a luxury retail development. Recent examples in the Far East include being led on behalf of a major Korean contractor in a dispute, seated in Seoul, concerning defects in the manufacture and supply of components for a large power generation and water desalination plant under the ICC Rules.\n\nRecent examples of Christopher’s work in litigation include acting (with Jonathan Acton Davis KC of Atkin Chambers and George Hayman KC of Maitland Chambers) for the state-owned defendant in multi-party litigation in the High Court of Trinidad and Tobago concerning four large-scale road construction projects under the FIDIC form of contract. He also acted (with Fiona Parkin KC and Rónán Hanna of Atkin Chambers) for a major global design consultancy on a number of disputes before the Technology and Construction Court in the BDW Trading litigation concerning the scope of a design consultant’s duty of care in tort.\n\nChristopher also has a busy advisory practice and has experience of providing advice on the full spectrum of issues which arise during the life of large international projects, most recently for the employer of a hydrocracker plant project in the Middle East."
