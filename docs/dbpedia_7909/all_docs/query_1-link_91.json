        "text": "Christopher Reid is a major poet and a Selected Poems is long overdue. This is an essential purchase. His first two collections, Arcadia and Pea Soup, confirmed him as an integral part of the school of Martian Poetry, but it was his third collection, Katerina Brac, that cemented his place at the forefront of contemporary poetry. Katerina Brac was presented as a translation. The work of a female poet of undisclosed nationality and language. It is a near perfect collection of poetry, simultaneously inviting questions of ownership, authorship, and truth of feeling, while also presenting the reader with a stream of painfully beautiful imagery. The opening poem, ‘Pale-Blue Butterflies’, describes them as\n\n“lighting on our favourite blooms, as detachable as earrings, but so common that nobody, except the wobbliest of toddlers, bothered to try to catch them.”\n\nIn ‘Realism’, childbirth is\n\n“mucky and time consuming like some operation in charcuterie”\n\nAgain and again the reader is presented with images that live far beyond the page, or the reading, and yet, at the same time, the reader is forced to ask themselves ‘if this is not real, if this is a fake, can the emotions these poems evoke be true?’ Katerina Brac should be on every bookshelf.\n\nAs should Expanded Universes, Reid’s collection from 1986, which is also well represented in the Selected Poems. Expanded Universes was a series of fiendishly clever plays on words, ideas, concepts and realities that somehow managed to remain human and full of dry humour:\n\n“I have in my possession an angel’s wingbone”\n\nMost of Reid’s books have a fair selection in this collection, including ‘A Scattering’, perhaps the most likely of his work to be familiar to occasional readers of poetry (because it won the 2009 Costa Prize). ‘A Scattering’ is a set of elegies for Reid’s late wife, and is the only such work that can stand comparison with Douglas Dunn’s Elegies. In it Reid uses his intelligence not to play tricks with realities but to investigate his own loss and pain, and to place them under a microscope. What he found, he presented with grace, and with an honesty lacking in most human interactions. The poems are raw, and yet clean and well presented, as if ready for a funeral. It deserves a larger readership.\n\nThis collection is a fine introduction to Christopher Reid’s work. It is also, for those of us familiar with his work, a fascinating glimpse of a career in progress, and a nudge to return to the individual collections. Reid is the best we have. The best we have had for some time. If you have not read him yet, you should invest in a copy of this book.\n\nAny Cop?: Boxers talk of wanting to be the best pound-for-pound fighter. Pound-for-pound Christopher Reid is the finest living writer of the language. Not owning this book is like not owning Shakespeare. Without this collection you do not own a library; just books on a shelf."
