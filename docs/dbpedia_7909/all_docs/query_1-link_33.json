He paints everything from portraits, landscapes, wildlife, and pets in his contemporary realist style. His art has won numerous international awards. He travels all over the world painting en plein air as often as possible, exhibiting, and sharing his passion for art with others through teaching workshops.\n\nBorn in Johannesburg, South Africa, Chris studied art at the Savannah College of Art & Design(Savannah, GA). He lives in Hermanus, South Africa, inspired by the local landscapes, people, and wildlife.\n\nAt an early age Chris wanted to be a comic book illustrator. In his teens he decided to pursue digital art to work in the 3D animation field. To pay for college he did graphic design and ended up running an advertising firm after college. A life changing epiphany occurred when he realized it was only the creative side of ad design that he enjoyed and not the rest of the career. Chris became a full-time artist and never looked back.\n\nChris has won numerous international awards for his art in several genres. He is the founder and president of Watercolor Art Southern Africa, the largest art society in Africa. He is the leader representing southern Africa for FabrianoInArte, and also head of International Watercolor Society South Africa and South African Plein Air Painters.\n\nFind out more about Chris by connecting with him online:\n\nreidsart.com\n\nartistchristopherreid on Facebook\n\nChristopher Reid on LinkedIn\n\n@reidsart on Twitter\n\nreidsart on Instagram"
