        "text": "A Conversation With Chris Reid\n\nChris Reid, aka Kid from Kid 'n Play, sat down with Giddy's Marisa Sullivan to discuss getting older and what his life looks like today. In this candid interview, Reid also recalls his parents' history—how his white mother began dating his Black father in the 1960s, resulting in her family disowning her. Reid says it was those early hardships that, in part, helped mold his late mother into the strong woman she was. That inner strength is a quality he has always admired—one shared by the other important women in his life.\n\nThese days, Reid says he sees that same strength reflected in his girlfriend and talks about how the two deal with conflict—and their resolve to never fight publicly. Reid also stays in close contact with some important ex-partners as well: the mothers of his children. He admits that his children's mothers are the hands-on, day-to-day parents, but says he does his part to support them when they need it.\n\nReid, 57, also recounts the changes he has experienced as he gets older. As far as Reid is concerned, \"Sleep is the new sex.\" These differences aren't isolated to Reid, however. He highlights the difference between his peers when they were at the height of their fame in the '90s and when they reunited for the \"I Love The 90's Tour.\""
