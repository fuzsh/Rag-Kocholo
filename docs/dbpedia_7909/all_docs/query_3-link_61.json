        "text": "Christopher Reid was born 13 May 1949 in Hong Kong. In January 2010 he won the 2009 Costa Book Award for A Scattering, written as a tribute to his late wife, the actress Lucinda Gane. Reid became the first poet to take the overall Costa Book of the Year since Seamus Heaney in 1999. He had been nominated for Whitbread Awards in 1996 and in 1997 (Costa Awards under their previous name). His Selected Poems appeared in 2011 and Nonsense in 2013."
