        "text": "Chris Reid is a doctoral student whose research looks at the role of curiosity in secondary science education. Before joining King’s, he taught physics for over a decade, holding departmental and whole-school leadership positions across secondary schools in the state and independent sectors. He has also worked as an associate lecturer in initial teacher training.\n\nPrior to beginning his doctoral studies, he undertook an MSc in Learning and Teaching at Oxford University, assessing the impact of an action research programme that he was leading at a large sixth-form college. Before that, he studied Natural Sciences at Durham University and has a postgraduate degree in Philosophy from St Andrew’s University.\n\nChris is a member of the ECS research group the Centre for Research in Education in Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics, with a specialism in science education. His work is funded by the ESRC through the London Interdisciplinary Social Science Doctoral Training Partnership.\n\nResearch interests\n\nChris's thesis title is 'Learning Science: What's Curiosity Got To Do With It?'\n\nThis includes the following issues:\n\nWhat curiosity is and how we can measure it.\n\nHow secondary school students' curiosity changes over time.\n\nThe benefits of being curious about secondary science.\n\nHow we can foster students' curiosity.\n\nThe intersection between curiosity and related concepts such as interest."
