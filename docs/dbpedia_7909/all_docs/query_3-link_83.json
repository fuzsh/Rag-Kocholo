        "text": "Christopher Henry Reid, fondly known as Gus, Crust, Bish and Uncle Fish was born on 22 May 1955, the 2nd child to the union of James Levy Reid, Sr. and Frankie Mae (Ramsey) Reid. He departed this earthly life for everlasting life on 31 October 2021.\n\nChris was baptized at an early age and received all of the holy sacraments in accordance with Catholic doctrine. He attended St. Joseph Elementary School and Church where he served many years as an altar boy. Chris attended both St. Stephen T. Badin and Garfield High Schools, but ultimately earned his GED and later graduated from RETS Technical College in Dayton. Chris was employed at ARMCO Steel, Duffy’s Smorgasbord and the Army Air Force Exchange Service and many other odd jobs.\n\nAs a young boy he enjoyed playing football and playing base guitar and drums and had formed a little band with his friends. He had an insatiable knack for tinkering with anything electronic/technical or mechanical. Chris was a practical joker and had a morbid sense of humor, often laughing to tears. Playing last tag into his older years was often one of his antics. His intelligence, competitiveness, strong will and stubbornness, and living on the edge attitude, often landed him on the outside of the law.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, paternal grandparents Henry H. and Ada (Morton) Reid; maternal grandparents Dave & Henrietta (Johnson) Shirley, his loyal and faithful brother, James Levy Reid, Jr. and cherished granddaughter, Brooke Heavenly Simmons.\n\nChris leaves behind his beloved wife, Debbie Simmons Reid, and 7 beautiful children, Christopher Ryan Simmons, of Texas, Anthony Bryan Simmons, Angelica Latrish Reid, and Charita Marie Reid, all of North Carolina, Shakiya Iyonna Reid (Dayton), and Adam Jabar Solomon Reid (Hamilton); his eldest son, Christopher H. Tunstall (Arielle), born to his union with Mrs. Nervina (Tunstall) Burns; Eighteen grandchildren and three great grandchildren; Three sisters Deirdre M. Reid, Cassandra A. Gould and Rebekah J. Reid; an Aunt and Uncle Maxine Sarah (Reid) and James Lewis; a host of cousins, nieces and nephews as well as great nieces, great nephews and friends.\n\nHe will be especially missed by his ever loving Aunt Julie Reid, his special cousins, Warkoneta Howard Tucker, Eugene Washington, and Charles S. Dillingham, Aaron ‘AD’ Dillingham, Wilbur ‘Billy’ Meade and Tony Jordan, and lifelong friend, Leon ‘Tricks’ Howard."
