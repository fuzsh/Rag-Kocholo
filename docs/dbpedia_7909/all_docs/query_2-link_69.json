Reid is a graduate from local Charlotte high school, Charlotte Country Day School, and a recent graduate from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Throughout his time in college, he always gravitated towards the entertainment industry, whether it was through booking bands as a social chair for his fraternity or seeking live music at places like He’s Not Here, Cat’s Cradle, or Memorial Hall.\n\nAlthough, only just graduating in the spring of 2017, Reid has gained experience in the entertainment industry as a buyer and a seller. He interned for a booking agent at a local venue, Motoroco Music Hall, in Durham, NC assisting in assessing the venues buying power with local and regional bands. Additionally, Reid interned in the Raleigh ECE office as a summer intern. In his final year at Chapel Hill, Reid was a member of the concerts committee of the Carolina Union Activities Board (CUAB), which helped bring comedians Chris Redd and Deray Davis as well as rapper 2 Chainz onto UNC’s campus. In the classroom, Reid studied entrepreneurship with a focus in the arts. He believes his experience of thinking outside the box is perfect for helping couples, wedding planners, corporate clients, social chairs etc. execute their entertainment needs.\n\nIn his free time, Reid enjoys watching the Panthers play on Sundays and Tar Heel basketball during March Madness. If Reid is not in the office, you may find him playing golf or watching a show at Uptown Amphitheater at the Music Factory."
