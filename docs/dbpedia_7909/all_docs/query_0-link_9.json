        "text": "13 Chefs Compete\n\nChef Ramsay partners up the chefs for a challenge where they must make perfectly portioned 6-inch sausages. With the competition at a rolling boil, mounting tension between the chefs causes one chef to explode. That evening, Drew Lachey, John O'Hurley, Tom Green, Melinda Clarke, Chris \"Kid\" Reid and Kristy Swanson, stop by Hell's Kitchen for dinner service. However, when the red team's dishes are sent back to the kitchen for being too salty and the blue team's food is cold, Chef Ramsay flies off the handle.\n\nKid-napped\n\nWhen a new girl in school threatens Tia and Tamera's popularity, the twins join forces to win back their friends with the help of a music superstar.\n\nBrothers & Sister\n\nPete is confronted by a girlfriend with whom he never broke up, before deploying to Afghanistan, and Jill must help him through the split. Meanwhile, Derrick and Randy test their âdating skillsâ without each other as wingmen and come to some startling revelations."
