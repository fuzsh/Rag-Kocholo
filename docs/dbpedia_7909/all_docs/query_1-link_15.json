        "meta_description": "Christopher \"Kid\" Reid as Christopher Robinson, Jr. and Christopher \"Play\" Martin as Peter Martin - Kid 'N Play were the hottest duo in rap in the late 80s and early 90s. After showing up in numerous movies in the House Party franchise, Reid made guest appearances on sitcoms like Barbershop and Sister, Sister and was host of Showtime at the Apollo. Reid also made several appearances on Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher and even composed the theme music for Maher's Real Time. Meanwhile, his partner-in-crime Martin took a hiatus from acting to focus on his faith (he became a born-again Christian) and family (he married Boomerang actress Shari Headley). Now a Christian rapper, he has been making his way back into acting with the films Welcome to Durham, USA and The Return.Â (Photos from left: Joe Scarnici/Getty Images for MAC Presents, Mike Coppola/Getty Images) - The hip hop classic celebrates 25 years today.",
