On the very night she was hoping to win a Daytime Emmy award, nominee Krista Allen revealed that she'd been released from her contract at The Bold and the Beautiful. In an interview with Deadline, the actress said that she'd appeared for the last time back in November.

"The craziest thing is right before I got dropped, I did the cast photo shoot," she said. "And then the next week, they called and said, 'We're not going to keep your third year and thank you very much, you were wonderful and thank you, goodbye. And I was like, 'What?'"

Allen, who stepped into the part originally created by Hunter Tylo back in 2021, said the hardest part has been keeping quiet. "I haven't known what to say," she admits. When her second anniversary in the part of Taylor hit last week, "I came back to Twitter for the first time since June to engage with fans again, just to say thank you because there were so many congratulations and people saying, 'I can't wait to see you back on screen' and 'when are you coming back?'"

A spokesperson for the soap told Deadline that they do not comment on the status of actors. And while Allen was approached in late November, her rep said they declined the offer to appear "after a couple months of nothing."

As for what will happen to the character, Allen hopes to see the part recast. "I think Taylor is needed," she said. "She was so missed whenever Hunter didn't come back. The most ironic part of it is that it's like a real-life soap opera. This is the Friday cliffhanger!"
