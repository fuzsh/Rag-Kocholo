Many fans were surprised when it was initially reported that Krista Allen was no longer playing Taylor on THE BOLD & THE BEAUTIFUL. Especially since the news broke on the very same day of the 50th annual Daytime Emmy Awards where she was up for Outstanding Supporting Actress for her work on the soap. As Allen explained at the time, she was beginning this new chapter in her life by moving to Georgia, and now reports that she’s getting settled in!

“I made it to my new place in Georgia!” Allen posted on X/Twitter. “I’m officially a bicoastal babe now! I’ve wanted to find a place out of California for a long time. Amazing how a simple shift in perspective can make the biggest difference. Sometimes when you think you have been buried, you have actually just been divinely planted. Here’s to all my new growth fam out there! Love you!”

While Allen hasn’t yet shared any photos of her new abode, it sounds great. “It’s super cute,” she shared in a reply to a fan. “A huge yard for the three pitties and the nicest neighbors! I even came home to a fully decorated Christmas tree that was set up in my living room as a welcome gift. If that’s not Southern hospitality, I don’t know what is!”

Allen made her daytime debut as a recast of Billie Reed on DAYS OF OUR LIVES, a role she played from 1996-99. She has also appeared in primetime series like THE X-FILES, FRIENDS, CSI, FRASIER, MONK, CASTLE, and more. She returned to soaps in December 2021 when she took over the role of Taylor Hayes on B&B, but after her contract was not renewed, her final appearance was in November 2023.

The actress will be enjoying her new life in Georgia while also pursuing work in Hollywood, and proves the old adage that when one door closes, another opens. “Well, when this last door closed I just went out the damn window!” Allen joked.
