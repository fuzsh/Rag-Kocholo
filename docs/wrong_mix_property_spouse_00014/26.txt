While Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Daytime Drama Series, Krista Allen (Taylor Hayes), was walking on the red carpet last night at the 50th Daytime Emmy Awards, earlier in the day the news had broke, that the reason viewers of CBS‚Äôs The Bold and the Beautiful had not seen her on-air, is that the show decided not to pick up the third year of her contract.

Allen told Deadline, that she was told back in October that her contract wouldn‚Äôt be renewed. Smart B&B viewers had noticed that she has not appeared in any episodes since November 8th. Given Eric Forrester‚Äôs (John McCook) failing health storyline, where her children Thomas (Matthew Atkinson) and Steffy (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) were greatly impacted, many were wondering where was Taylor?

Now the answers became clear: Krista was told the show opted out of her contract, but the events surrounding it didn‚Äôt initially add up to her. Allen expressed, ‚ÄúThe craziest thing is right before I got dropped, I did the cast photo shoot, and then the next week they called and said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre not going to keep your third year and thank you very much, you were wonderful and thank you, goodbye.‚Äô And I was like, what?‚Äù‚Äô

Krista said it was very challenging for her to keep quiet about the whole situation: ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt known what to say. And then when I got dropped, I was like, ‚Äòoh, okay, is the show going to announce this?‚Äô But they never did.‚Äù

When Allen checked out X (formerly Twitter) on December 10th, she realized it was the two-year anniversary of playing Taylor and many of her fans were posting messages to her about, but she didn‚Äôt know how to respond.

However, a source also told Deadline that Allen was offered to go recurring with the series, and turned that down. Krista‚Äôs rep shared that she had been offered three lines in an episode in late November, after ‚Äúa couple of nothing months.‚Äù

No word yet if the role will be recast, but Allen shared that following the Daytime Emmys, she was moving to Atlanta, Georgia and out of Hollywood. nterestingly, Krista‚Äôs former leading man, Thorsten Kaye (Ridge Forrester), took home the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series

The soap opera world has been in mourning over the weekend, with the news of the death of Esta TerBlanche, who played Gillian Andrassy Lavery on ABC‚Äôs All My Children from 1997-2001.

Esta‚Äôs leading man during her run in Pine Valley was Cameron Mathison (ex-Ryan Lavery, AMC now, Drew Quartermaine, GH). The love story of Ryan and Gillian was complex. He believed that Gillian was a wealthy princess; and she believed Ryan made enough money to support her. When Ryan discovered that Gillian was penniless, he chose to stay with her and the two were eventually married. Later, Gillian was killed when TerBlanche wanted to return to her native South Africa.

In an exclusive statement to Michael Fairman TV on Sunday, Mathison expressed, ‚ÄúEsta was somebody very, very close to my heart. We both came to New York around the same time and basically started and learned acting together. Ryan and Gillian are such a beautiful sweet couple ‚Ä¶ and hold a very, very special place in my heart.‚Äù

Speaking on TerBlanche‚Äôs love of animals and reconnecting with her in 2023, Cameron recounted, ‚ÄúEsta was literally one of the sweetest kindest people I‚Äôve eve met. When she heard that my dog (Red) was sick and paralyzed last year, she volunteered to take him for a few days to try to care for him to give me a break. We hadn‚Äôt really been in touch for a long time so it came out of nowhere and after spending time with her, he learned how to walk again. üôè‚Äù

In closing Mathison shared, ‚ÄúShe was just a beautiful soul and had a healing spirit.‚Äù TerBlanche died unexpectedly on Thursday. The cause of death has not yet been determined.

Cameron also took to his Instagram Story on Sunday, sharing some images of himself and Esta with one said from All My Children, which read,‚ÄùRIP my sweet princess.‚Äù

When All My Children came to its conclusion in 2011, Ryan was reunited with Gillian one more time when he received a ‚Äòheavenly‚Äô visit from his princess. Now with TerBlanche‚Äôs death, it makes the scenes all the more poignant. Watch it below.
