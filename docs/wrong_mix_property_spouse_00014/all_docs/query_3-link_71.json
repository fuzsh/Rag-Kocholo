In 1993, the Japanese Government introduced the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP) to accept foreign national workers. While the number of technical intern trainees under this program has constantly increased, many of them face challenges in their daily lives, such as stress, health insecurities and limited access to healthcare. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to assess the mental well-being of technical intern trainees, focusing on psychological distress and its related factors. This study included 304 technical intern trainees from 12 prefectures in Japan, and was conducted from August 2021 to October 2021. We used self-administered questionnaires in the participants’ native languages to assess their sociodemographic conditions, health-related conditions such as health insecurities and healthcare-seeking behaviors, and psychological distress. The K6 Kessler Psychological Distress Scale was applied to evaluate the levels of psychological distress. Among the participants, 26.3% had moderate psychological distress and 2.3% had severe psychological distress. In addition, about 15% of the participants reported health insecurities and did not see a doctor despite wanting to. The multivariate model of logistic regression revealed significant associations between psychological distress and female gender (AOR 2.62, 95% CI 1.12–6.12), nationality other than Vietnamese (AOR 4.85, 95% CI 2.60–9.07), tough financial conditions (AOR 2.23, 95% CI 1.18–4.19), experiencing health insecurity (AOR 2.21, 95% CI 1.04–4.66) and the health behavior of refraining from seeking medical care (AOR 3.06, 95% CI 1.49–6.30). The top reasons for refraining from seeking medical care were the participants’ limited knowledge about the healthcare system in Japan and their worries about medical bills. These findings highlight the necessity to extend mental health support services, including counseling services, and share information about Japan’s healthcare system to supply medical services to the targeted technical intern trainee population.

The cave attracts a high number of tourists every year and is used by local populations as a water supply source. The main objective of the research undertaken in Dimba Cave consisted of assessing the quality of water and sediments from Dimba Cave ponds through evaluating contamination by heavy metals (15 elements analyzed, including As, Cd, Pb, and Hg) and by microbial populations (including Escherichia coli and total coliforms) in order to estimate the ecotoxicological risk to humans and to non-human biota. All water samples collected in the cave ponds showed very high metal concentrations exceeding the internationally recommended limits for drinking water, particularly for Cr, Mn, As, Pb, and Hg. Most sediment samples from cave ponds also displayed high heavy metal concentrations. The calculated pollution parameters, such as the enrichment factor (EF), and ecological risk parameters, such as the ecological risk index (Eri), indicated that the sediment may be toxic to aquatic biota. Furthermore, the microbiological analysis of pond waters indicated a widespread contamination with bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., total coliforms, and Pseudomonas spp., probably from anthropogenic and/or animal sources. Therefore, the consumption of Dimba Cave water as a drinking water represents a threat to public health. Urgent management measures should be enforced to protect public health and the cave ecosystem.

People from migrant, refugee, and asylum seeker backgrounds usually use less mainstream sexual healthcare services and have lower levels of sexual health literacy compared with the destination countries’ general population. However, there is little collated knowledge about sexual health programs that have been implemented to improve sexual health among these groups. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of programs for improving sexual health among migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. Methods: This study was a scoping review in which Scopus and PubMed were searched for peer-reviewed articles published in English since 2010 from countries similar to and including Australia such as New Zealand, the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, and European Union countries). The final search of databases was performed on 26 June 2023, and resultant studies were inputted into Endnote and Covidence systematic review software to remove duplicates before screening. The study utilised a qualitative approach using inductive thematic analysis of the content of the studies to extract and categorise the characteristics of the program. Results: A total of 3044 articles were screened and 20 were included for data extraction. The included studies were conducted in six countries (the United States of America, Australia, France, Italy, Denmark, and Belgium). The key characteristics of sexual health programs identified included consumer consultation and engagement, cultural appropriateness, language support, peer education, self-directed learning, group learning, financial support, and outreach services. the programs had a combination of these characteristics to ensure that they can improve target population engagement with educational materials and decrease barriers to accessing sexual healthcare. Conclusion: Consideration of migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers’ culture, language, socioeconomic characteristics, and access to information and services in the design of the sexual health programs may improve sexual health outcomes among these groups. However, further research is needed to assess the importance and implementation feasibility of the identified characteristics for sexual health programs in specific context.

The participants’ PA decreased during the pandemic and did not recover afterwards. Among women, PA increased slightly in 2022 but not at all in men. From 2019 to 2020, SB increased and then decreased to near the pre-pandemic level in both sexes. Regarding age, PA decreased in the oldest age group (65–79 years) across all time points, while SB increased in all age groups during 2019–2020 and then returned close to pre-pandemic levels among the two middle age groups (30–64 years), but not among the youngest and oldest groups. Considering occupation, PA decreased from 2020 to December 2022 among retired and “other” participants, while SB decreased among nonmanual workers and retired participants. The regression models associated better self-reported health, male sex, and those born overseas with higher PA. Higher age, better self-reported health, poor education, and later survey time points were associated with lower SB. These findings highlight the need to return PA and SB to at least pre-pandemic levels and that subgroups may need different interventions.

This study aimed to evaluate the spatial distribution of PDHFs in Riyadh city in relation to population density in each sub-municipality. Methods: The current information regarding the number, location, and operability of PDHFs in Riyadh city was obtained from the Ministry of Health. A total of 632 operating PDHFs were included with the precise location plotted on Quantum Geographic Information System software (version 3.32.1, Essen, Germany) using Google Earth. Four levels of buffer zones—1 km, 3 km, 5 km, and >5 km—were determined. The population statistics and mean monthly individual income per district were gathered from Zadd.910ths. Microsoft Excel (version 16.0, Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and RStudio software (version 4.1.3, Posit Software, PBC, Boston, MA, USA) were used for additional data analysis. Results: There was an overall ratio of one PDHF per 9958 residents in Riyadh city. Olaya and Maather sub-municipalities had the largest PDHF-to-population ratios: (1:4566) and (1:4828), respectively. Only 36.3% of the city’s total area was within a 1 km buffer zone from a PDHF. There was an overall weak positive correlation between the number of PDHFs and the total area in each sub-municipality (r = 0.29), and the distribution of PDHFs was uneven corresponding to the area (G* = 0.357). Conclusions: There was an uneven distribution of PDHFs in Riyadh city. Some areas were underserved while others were overserved in several sub-municipalities. Policy-makers and investors are encouraged to target underserved areas rather than areas with significant clustering to improve access to care.

The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility (demand, implementation, practicality, acceptability, and limited efficacy) of an allied-health-led multidisciplinary symptom management service (ReCOV) for long COVID. Methods: A single-group observational cohort feasibility study was conducted to determine demand (referrals), acceptability (survey), implementation (waitlist times, health professions seen), practicality (adverse events), and limited efficacy (admission and discharge scores from the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale, Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ), Patient Health Questionnaire, and EuroQol 5D-5L). Data are presented as median [interquartile range] or count (percentage). Results: During the study, 143 participants (aged 42.00 [32.00–51.00] years, 68% women) participated in ReCOV. Participants were waitlisted for 3.86 [2.14–9.86] weeks and engaged with 5.00 [3.00–6.00] different health professionals. No adverse events occurred. The thematic analysis revealed that ReCOV was helpful but did not fully meet the needs of all participants. Limited efficacy testing indicated that participants had improved understanding and control (p < 0.001) of symptoms (BIPQ) and a small improvement in EQ VAS score (median difference 5.50 points [0.00–25.00], p = 0.004]). Conclusions: A multidisciplinary service was safe and mostly acceptable to participants for the management of long COVID. Further research should investigate the clinical and cost effectiveness of such a service, including optimal service duration and patient outcomes.

In recent decades, it has been recommended that non-immune women receive immunization during the preconceptional and/or postpartum periods. The goal of this strategy is to prevent primary rubella infection in order to protect pregnant women against congenital rubella syndrome. In November 2022, the WHO’s Regional Verification Commission declared the elimination of rubella infection in Italy. In recent years, the main migration flows to Italy have originated from regions where rubella has not yet been eliminated and where no program is in place to achieve this goal. Objective: The aim of this study was to retrospectively assess rubella immunity in pregnant women who have attended three delivery centers in Rome over the past three years, from January 2021 to May 2023. Methods: Data about the rubella serological status of 7937 non-consecutive pregnant women were collected. Univariate analysis was performed to verify any difference between the study groups in terms of age distribution. Results: Anti-rubella IgG antibodies were found in 7224 (91%) women while 713 (9%) were susceptible to rubella (IgG negative), without differences in terms of immunity rate between Italian and non-Italian women. Age analysis showed a statistically significant older age of immune women than receptive women and of Italian immune women than non-Italian immune women. Conclusions: The National Plan for the Elimination of Measles and Congenital Rubella aimed to achieve a percentage of susceptible women of childbearing age below 5%. These data indicate the relevance of maintaining the recommendation for preconceptional rubella vaccination in Italy.

We searched PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL for English-language comparative studies conducted on humans of any age from 1 January 1940, to 28 August 2023. Further, studies that provided quantitative data on the relationship between noise annoyance and biomarkers of interest were included. Where possible, random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate the odds ratios of noise annoyance on biomarkers and biological conditions considered to be risk factors for developing health effects. The risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the Risk of Bias of Non-randomized Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E) instrument. The CoE for each outcome was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The search identified 23 primary studies reporting on relevant biomarkers. Although some studies and pooled estimates suggest a possible association between noise annoyance and biological measures, the CoE overall is very low due to concerns with the risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision in the estimates of effects. In the context of environmental impact assessment, where guidelines aim to mitigate the prevalence of populations experiencing a high level of noise annoyance, our results suggest that such practices should be grounded in the understanding that annoyance is health-relevant because it reflects an undesirable reaction to noise, rather than a precursor to chronic physical health conditions.

Farmers face an increased risk of heat-related illnesses (e.g., heat exhaustion, cerebral vascular accidents, and cardiovascular issues) and work-related injuries, death, and mental health conditions due to climate change. This cross-sectional survey employed the health belief model (HBM) as its theoretical framework. This study aimed to assess the health status of small farmers, climate change beliefs, adaptive agricultural practices, and the perceived effects of climate change on health. Study data were collected using non-probability sampling methods from small farmers (n = 72) with a gross farm income of < USD 250,000. The study findings show that 93% of participants reported good–excellent health, 69% believe the climate is changing and getting warmer, 58.3% believe people are responsible for the changes in our climate, and 75% believe the changing climate impacts farmers. Among the HBM predictive variables, participants reported self-efficacy (50%), perceived susceptibility (48.6%), and perceived severity (43%). Only 16.7% of farmers reported believing they have all the information needed to prepare for climate-related health impacts. This study suggests small farmers have protective factors and adaptive capacity, including health status, income, and education levels, but believe they lack the information necessary to protect their health from climate change.

It is important to know the risk factors of UBC to avoid them and to decrease its recurrence after treatment. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the risk factors associated with UBC incidence. Methods: A comprehensive literature search from 2012 to 2024 was carried out in databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Medline with potential keywords such as “bladder cancer”, “urothelial bladder cancer”, “incidence of urothelial bladder cancer worldwide”, “mortality rate of bladder cancer”, “incidence according to gender”, “treatment for bladder cancer”, and “risk factors of bladder cancer”. Smoking tobacco was comprehended to be the major risk factor for UBC. Smoke from tobacco products contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and aromatic amines such as 4-aminobiphenyl, which are known to cause UBC. Smoking-related bladder cancer mortality ranks just second to smoking-related lung cancer mortality. For non-smokers, pollution became a major risk factor associated with UBC. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are linked to many cancers, especially to UBC. Indoor and outdoor pollution generates VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and PAHs. Small-particle matter < 2.5 is linked to UBC and lung cancers. Drinking chlorinated water is linked to UBC. Also, swimming in chlorinated pools that produce trihalomethanes increases the risk of many cancers, and especially of bladder cancer. Occupational exposure to carcinogens, specifically aromatic amines, is a significant UBC risk factor. It has been estimated that approximately 20% of all UBCs may be linked to this type of exposure, primarily in industrial settings that treat dye, paint, petroleum chemicals, and metal. The other risk factors included genetics, diet, and medical conditions. Alcohol, consumption of processed meat and whole milk, and higher intakes of selenium and vitamins A and E also contribute to the development of UBC. Further, chemotherapeutic agents, oral hypoglycemic drugs, and radiation therapy are positively associated with UBC. Conclusions: The significance of the initial prevention of UBC must be emphasized, and especially programs for quitting cigarettes should be encouraged and supported. However, smoking is not the only risk factor for UBC. For non-smokers, other risk factors should be investigated. Air and water pollution are linked to UBC. Indoor and outdoor pollution should be more controlled. Patients and people should be informed of the risk of drinking chlorinated water and swimming in chlorinated pools.

Therefore, this study investigated educators’ implementation strategies in a new tailor-designed educational intervention with the goal of supporting the process of ageing for people with mild intellectual disability. An ethnographic research design was employed, including participant observations, field notes, and 15 ad hoc interviews with educators, spread over two years in four towns. The strategies used for facilitating learning about ageing were expressed in the two themes promoting social togetherness through everyone’s participation and learning together and from each other through recognition and consolidation. These strategies were applied to create a learning environment characterised by a good atmosphere and respectful interaction. Learning together involved consolidation through repetition, group discussions, the use of visual learning materials, and study visits. This new educational intervention about ageing is promising, but less resource-intensive interventions should also be developed and preferably integrated into the disability service. Before concluding whether this education supports the ageing process, it needs to be evaluated from the perspective of people with intellectual disability.

This study aimed to show the impact of 8-week active and passive NBI programs on self-esteem, well-being, and relaxation in the elderly. The NBI programs were conducted in two groups of elderly citizens of Poland: independent senior students and seniors requiring 24 h care. The Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem Scale and the World Health Organization Well-Being Index were used to assess self-esteem and well-being before and after the programs. To assess relaxation, pre–post session measurements of pulse rate (PR) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) were used. Our study showed an improvement in the self-esteem, well-being, and relaxation of the participants of both active and passive NBI programs. In all study groups, self-esteem and well-being improved after the programs, regardless of the type of intervention, and after each NBI session, the elderly showed a decrease in PR and an increase in SpO2, which indicated a deeper state of relaxation. Our research showed a greater improvement in the tested parameters in the seniors participating in the passive programs in a garden. This confirms a key role of green spaces in residential areas for the elderly and in nursing homes.

This study used data made public by the Japan Sports Agency from four events that have continuously been evaluated from 1964 to 2021—grip strength, 50 meter dash, repetitive side jumps, and softball throw—to depict a secular trend over the course of 58 years. This is to statistically categorize these into generations, establishing secular contrast by identifying high and low scores for each event within the categorized generations, with the intent to examine the factors embedded within the background. The generations that had the highest average across all four events were the measurements made in 1970–1993 for males and in 1972–1994 for females. Changes made to the curriculum guidelines may have played a role in the differences found within each event. The goal of physical education and its syllabus and assigned hours in the curriculum guidelines are revised approximately every 10 years to meet social demand. Changes in the social and living environments surrounding children may be exhibited in the form of secular contrast in the measured physical fitness and athletic skills.

Integrative care is recommended to address CBs. However, in clinical practice, psychotropic drugs are often prescribed off-label for CBs, although the effectiveness is unclear, and side effects frequently occur. We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled study to investigate the effect of integrative care provided by a collaboration of an ID specialized mental healthcare team and participants’ own ID service providers’ care team on reducing CBs and inappropriate off-label psychotropic drug prescriptions compared with care as usual. Participants (N = 33, aged 19–81 years) had a moderate, severe, or profound intellectual disability and used off-label psychotropic drugs. The primary outcome measures were the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the total dose of psychotropic drug prescriptions. At the study endpoint of 40 weeks, we found no effect of the intervention on the total ABC score and on the total dose of psychotropic drug prescriptions. In the intervention group, however, the psychotropic drug dose decreased significantly, while CBs did not change. The small sample size and not-completed interventions due to organizational problems may have affected our findings. This study illustrates the difficulties in the implementation of integrative care.

Such challenges can result in PSP needing to take time away from the workplace. An unsuccessful workplace reintegration process may contribute to further personal challenges for PSP and their families as well as staffing shortages that adversely affect PSP organizations. The Canadian Workplace Reintegration Program (RP) has seen a global scale and spread in recent years. However, there remains a lack of evidence-based literature on this topic and the RP specifically. The current qualitative study was designed to explore the perspectives of PSP who had engaged in a Workplace RP due to experiencing a potentially psychologically injurious event or OSI. Methods: A qualitative thematic analysis analyzed interview data from 26 PSP who completed the RP. The researchers identified five themes: (1) the impact of stigma on service engagement; (2) the importance of short-term critical incident (STCI) program; (3) strengths of RP; (4) barriers and areas of improvement for the RP; and (5) support outside the RP. Discussion: Preliminary results were favorable, but further research is needed to address the effectiveness, efficacy, and utility of the RP. Conclusion: By addressing workplace reintegration through innovation and research, future initiatives and RP iterations can provide the best possible service and support to PSP and their communities.

This stigma can manifest in acts of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) and sexual and gender minority (SGM)-based violence, as well as various forms of discrimination—all of which have been linked to disproportionately higher levels of negative health outcomes for this group. Despite these challenges, many LBQT+ persons have been able to gain personal and collective power and thrive in this oppressive environment. The Empowerment for Us by Us (E4UBU) project is a mixed methods feminist participatory research study focused on exploring how LBQT+ persons conceptualize and define empowerment for themselves, and to understand their perspectives on how feelings of power and powerlessness influence their physical and mental health. This paper focuses on data from the first phase of the study, in which qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 40 LBQT+ persons (ages 19 to 50) from Kisumu and Homa Bay in Western Kenya. A participatory interpretive phenomenological analysis was conducted to understand the lived experiences of LBQT+ persons as they navigate intersectional oppression and its influence on their experiences of empowerment and subsequent health outcomes. Findings from this analysis were presented to two different focus groups composed of participants who had participated in the in-depth interviews to gather their insights on the interpretations of the interviews as a form of member checking. Findings revealed that “empowerment” was not experienced and viewed by LBQT+ persons as a monolithic construct, but rather a process through which LBQT+ persons are able to transform negative forces of intersectional oppression and powerlessness into experiences of power and subsequent individual and collective action and impact—all leading to improved mental health and well-being. This process is facilitated at several junctures by participatory seeking and attainment of community-appropriate resources at multiple socio-ecological levels that, when accessed with sufficient intensity, frequency, and duration, enhance one’s journey through the process of empowerment. These facilitation junctures are viewed as likely points of focus for public health intervention. Analysis also revealed that the process of empowerment is dependent on the context within which the process is occurring, the specific issues being faced, and the population of focus. Recommendations for how this model can be used for future research and practice to improve the lives of LBQT+ persons in Kenya are discussed.

It was also used to determine the relationship among tilt sensation abilities, physical development, and lower limb injuries in junior athletes. In this study, a step platform created tilt angles. Participants with eye masks answered “yes” or “no” to sensing a tilt, evaluated over nine or seven trials. Experiment 1 involved 22 university students (20.6 ± 0.9 years). The minimum angle at which a tilt could be sensed while standing on both feet was determined, and measurements were taken again to examine reliability. Experiment 2 involved 40 junior athletes (12.3 ± 2.0 years), where the minimum angle for tilt sensation was obtained, and medical checks were conducted to assess injuries in the knee, lower leg, and foot. Reliability studies showed a moderately significant correlation between the first and second sessions (r = 0.504, p = 0.017), suggesting the reliability of the experimental method. The proportion capable of sensing a tilt of 1.1° and 1.6° was significantly higher in junior high school students than in elementary school students (1.1°; χ2 = 8.839, p = 0.003. 1.6°; χ2 = 4.038, p = 0.044). The group unable to sense a tilt of 1.6° and 2.1° had a significantly higher positive rate of knee injuries compared to the sensed group among junior high school students (1.6°; χ2 = 4.622, p = 0.032. 2.1°; χ2 = 4.622, p = 0.032). Our findings suggested that a reduced tilt sensation ability was associated with knee injuries in junior high school students. Utilizing our devised tilt sensation assessment could play a crucial role in preventing and detecting early injuries in junior high school students.

However, no study has focused on the well-being of Chinese carers of people living with dementia in New Zealand during the pandemic. This study aimed to explore the support needs of Chinese carers of people living with dementia in New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by two bilingual and bicultural researchers. Thematic analysis was used to explore the resilience resources for Chinese carers. Twelve Chinese carers were recruited from four community organizations in New Zealand. Four themes were identified: (1) social isolation, (2) emotional loneliness, (3) ambivalent feelings of being a carer, and (4) a variety of unmet needs. The findings of our study provide new insights into the multiple support needs of Chinese carers of people living with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implications for practice include the establishment of culturally appropriate care support services and the development of tailored resilience-building interventions to address the unmet needs of Chinese carers of people living with dementia.
