        "text": "While George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin themselves have not actually spoken out about their engagement, Alamuddin's London law firm nevertheless confirmed it by way of a congratulatory statement on Monday.\n\n\"The barristers and staff of Doughty Street Chambers offer their best wishes and congratulations to Ms. Amal Alamuddin, a member of Chambers, and Mr. George Clooney on their engagement to be married,\" read the statement, reported Reuters.\n\nSo we now know officially that human rights lawyer Alamuddin will soon be Mrs. George Clooney, but she wasn't the first. That honor goes to actress Talia Balsam, who was married to the 52-year-old movie star from 1989 to 1993.\n\nIn the years between his former wife and his future wife, however, Clooney romanced a number of women. What happened to the actor's former flames after they called it quits? E! News investigates.\n\nClooney dated Kelly Preston from 1987 to 1989. The actor shared a home in the Hollywood Hills, and at one point, Clooney bought his girlfriend a black potbellied pig named Max. Post-split, he retained custody of Max until his death in 2006. Preston, meanwhile, married John Travolta in 1991 and gave birth to three children: Jett Travolta (1992-2009), Ella Travolta (born in 2000) and Benjamin Travolta (born in 2010).\n\nTwo years after his divorce, Clooney romanced Karen \"Duff\" Duffy. The two dated in 1995 after Clooney hit it big with \"ER\" and Duffy gained notoriety for roles in \"Reality Bites\" and \"Dumb & Dumber.\" She wed tech company consultant John Lambros in 1997; they welcomed a son via surrogate in July 2001.\n\nNEWS: George Clooney's quotes on love, marriage and children\n\nU.S. & World\n\nNews from around the country and around the globe\n\nIn 1996, while Clooney was filming \"The Peacemaker\" in Paris, he met a 23-year-old waitress named Celine Balitran. She followed him to L.A. and they dated until 1999. \"We haven't even mentioned marriage,\" Balitran told People in November 1997. \"We love each other too much to get married.\" The blond beauty went on to marry indie film director David M. Rosenthal; the couple divorced in 2002.\n\nVisit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy\n\nAfter meeting at a photo shoot in 2000, Clooney began an on-and-off relationship with British model Lisa Snowdon. \"The hardest thing is dealing with people who think I was going out with George to further my career. In fact, offers almost totally dried up,\" Snowdon told The Sun in 2008. \"People assumed I wouldn't be modeling again.\" She proved them wrong, as she hosted \"Britain's Next Top Model\" from 2006 to 2009 and currently co-presents \"Capital Breakfast.\" The couple broke up in 2005.\n\nVIDEO: Why George Clooney and Sandra Bullock never dated\n\nClooney briefly dated a Canadian waitress named Maria Bertrand in 2002. From 2002 to 2004, the two-time Academy Award winner romanced soap opera star Krista Allen. Six years later, the \"Days of Our Lives\" star married Mams Taylor, an Iranian rapper. The newlyweds separated in April 2011 and Allen filed for divorce in February 2012. She most recently appeared on an episode of \"Hawaii Five-0.\"\n\nIn 2007, Clooney stepped out with Sarah Larson at the Deauville Film Festival. The onetime \"Fear Factor\" winner was a cocktail waitress at a Las Vegas nightclub in the Palms Casino Resort. The following year, she became the first girlfriend to ever accompany Clooney to the Oscars; they split in June. As of July 2013, Larson worked as a part-time yoga instructor and full-time medical spa director in New York City.\n\nPHOTOS: George Clooney on the big screen\n\nEnter Elisabetta Canalis, the Italian model who swept Clooney off his feet for two years. In September 2009, the couple stepped out publicly at a screening of Clooney's film, \"The Men Who Stare at Goats,\" at the Venice Film Festival. In March 2010, Canalis accompanied Clooney to the Academy Awards. By June 2011, things went sour. Just a few months after celebrating the actor's 50th birthday, Clooney and Canalis ended their high-profile relationship. \"We are not together anymore. It's very difficult and very personal, and we hope everyone can respect our privacy,\" the exes said in a joint statement. In 2012, \"Dancing With the Stars\" contestant Canalis had a fleeting romance with \"Jackass\" star Steve-O.\n\nIn July 2011, Stacy Keibler visited Clooney at his Lake Como villa. They'd met at an Oscars party in 2006 after Clooney approached her and said he'd seen her perform on ABC's \"Dancing With the Stars.\" The pair made their red carpet debut at the Toronto Film Festival in September 2011, and Keibler--a former WWE Diva--became the third girlfriend to join Clooney at the Oscars (after Larson and Canalis). After two years of dating, they called it quits in July 2013. Keibler married tech entrepreneur Jared Pobre in March 2014 and is currently pregnant with her first child--a baby girl--due in the fall of 2014.\n\nNEWS: Five things to know about George Clooney's fiancee Amal Alamuddin\n\nNever single for long, Clooney was first photographed with Alamuddin in London in October 2013. In March 2014, they traveled to Tanzania and the Seychelles. A few days later, the press-shy pair were spotted together once again in New York City after sharing a romantic meal at a French restaurant.\n\nJust days ago, a source tells E! News that Alamuddin flashed a \"massive\" ring on her left ring finger while dining at Malibu restaurant Nobu with Clooney, Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber. And when Edward Norton approached their table mid-meal, the couple proudly told the actor, \"We're engaged!\""
