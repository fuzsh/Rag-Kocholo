        "text": "Where should I begin?\n\nA great place to start would be taking an NAD test kit. This tells you what your current NAD level is. We would then be happy to advise an optimal dosage for you.\n\nHow should I take NMN?\n\nFor Pure NMN powder, simply mix your scoop(s) with around 250ml of cold water, stir and enjoy! Each level, non-compacted scoop holds 500mg of Pure NMN.\n\nFor Pure NMN capsules, swallow with water. Each capsule contains 500mg of Pure NMN.\n\nIs it suitable for vegans?\n\nYes, this is suitable for vegans.\n\nHow should I store my NMN?\n\nNMN is best stored in a cool, dry cupboard. Keep it away from direct sunlight and extreme heat.\n\nHow do you store my NMN once it is manufactured?\n\nOur products are manufactured and stored in cool, dark and dry environments. All of our products are produced to GMP and ISO9001 standards.\n\nWhat is the recommended daily dosage for Pure NMN?\n\nWe recommend a daily dosage of at least 1g per day\n\nHow much Pure NMN is in each capsule?\n\n500mg of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)\n\nIs there a scoop in the powder?\n\nEach powder product contains a 500mg scoop.\n\nWhere do you source your NMN from?\n\nWe provide Pure Uthever® NMN. All of our products are produced to GMP and ISO9001 standards.\n\nWhat should I take with NMN?\n\nWe recommend this product is taken alongside our Pure Resveratrol, Pure TMG and SIRT6Activator®. What we are trying to achieve is the resveratrol activating sirtuins. NMN then provides them with energy so that they can do their healthy work. As for TMG, this acts as a methyl donor, ensuring you get the most from your NMN, and it also supports a healthy liver. SIRT6Activator promotes DNA repair, protects telomeres, supports genomic stability and reduces inflammation.\n\nWhat age should I start to take Pure NMN?\n\nNAD+ levels decline with age after around 25 years old. The goal of taking NAD+ precursors like NMN is to boost your levels back to what they were when you were younger. But age isn't the only thing that causes NAD+ to decline - for example, stress, inflammation, environmental toxins, lack of sleep. Therefore, NMN is safe to take at any age. An NAD+ blood test is the only way to confirm if your levels are suboptimal, but it cannot hurt to take NMN even if you're still young.\n\nAre there any fillers in your Pure NMN capsules?\n\nNo. Inside the cellulose vegetable capsule is just Pure NMN powder.\n\nHow do you ensure the purity of your Pure NMN?\n\nWe test every batch of Pure NMN and only supply it to our members if the purity comes back as above 99%. Purity certificates can be provided on request.\n\nAll of our ingredients are manufactured and labelled in either USA or UK."
