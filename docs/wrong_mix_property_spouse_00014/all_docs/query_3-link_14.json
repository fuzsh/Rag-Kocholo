It’s like this has to make sense,” the actress said about her exit.\n\nAllen, who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Daytime Emmy Awards for her performance in a daytime drama series, said the nomination and the news that she would not be returning was a bittersweet moment for her.\n\nDeadline previously reported that Allen was told in October that her contract for the show would not be renewed. Her last appearance on the show was on November 8.\n\nAllen remembered being speechless when she heard the news.\n\n“I didn’t know what to say, so I didn’t say anything. But yeah, there’s no better time than now,” she told PEOPLE.\n\nRelated: Susan Lucci says her late husband Helmut Huber had ‘everything to do with her Lifetime Achievement Award at the Daytime Emmys’\n\nAs for her next plans, the Emmy nominee hinted that she might trade in the screenplay for a writer’s pen.\n\n“I think I’m going to write a book,” Allen explained.\n\n“It’s based on a true story… about a woman who took a role on a soap opera and, against all odds, gained a fan base and was nominated for an Emmy,” she explained. “And then there’s a lot of drama behind the scenes and she has to find her way.”\n\nShe noted that the book would be written primarily for her own enjoyment – ​​and that it would even contain some aspects of a soap opera.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE’s free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n“I think I could write something really funny, really dramatic and really sappy,” Allen said. “I thought I could just write a funny book and turn it into a real soap opera, because that’s kind of what it feels like.”\n\n“But yeah, it could be fun,” she added. “It could be a fun thing.”\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to receive more People news!\n\nRead the original article on People."
