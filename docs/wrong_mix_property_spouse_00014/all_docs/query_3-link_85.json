        "text": "MOORHEAD — Two dozen students interested in a job in the construction trade recently took part in the annual Herdina Construction Trades Camp in Fargo-Moorhead. The camp provides an opportunity for students to work side-by-side with industry and education professionals while learning about occupations, tools, safety requirements, and skills required for satisfying and well-paying careers in the construction industry.\n\nThis year students and volunteers built a bathroom/washroom facility and produce stands for Farmer in the Dell at 7426 40th St. N. The nonprofit's mission is to serve people with developmental disabilities in a community farm setting.\n\n“A clean, easy-to-use, and well-functioning restroom is something that many of us take for granted, but with help from the Herdina Camp, our dreams of providing that for our team, volunteers, and visitors (some of which have mobility and sensory challenges) is coming true. We cannot express how grateful we are to the Herdina Camp, and everyone involved, for making this project possible,\" said Executive Director Anna Sather via statement.\n\nSpurred by Jim Roers, Roers Construction, the Herdina Camp’s origins can be traced back to the late 1990s when it was originally called the Academy for the Construction Trades. The “Herdina” name was added in 2001 after Neil Herdina, a young architect who spearheaded the curriculum planning of the academy and worked for Roers Construction. Neil passed away of a stroke in April 2000 at the young age of 27. Due to this unexpected and tragic loss, camp organizers decided to name the event after him so that his memory would always be attached to something he cared for so deeply. After the 2019 Academy, the name was updated to Herdina Construction Trades Camp.\n\nHerdina Camp is open to high school students aged 15 or older. The cost is $200 with scholarships available upon request. Upon successful completion of the camp, students earn high school credit and/or M State will transcript three college credits (BLDG 1110 Basic Principles of Residential and Commercial Construction) to the student’s academic record.\n\nFor more information, contact Krista Mund at krista@buildrrv.org or 701-232-5846 or visit www.buildrrv.org/hbc/programs/herdinatrades .\n\nGRAND FORKS — Prairie Business has announced the winners of its annual Leaders & Legacies awards.\n\nCareer accomplishments and highlights were considered, as well as the positive impact the professionals have made on their organizations, communities and industries.\n\nPrairie Business covers both the Dakotas and western Minnesota, and seeks nominations from its coverage area.\n\nThe winners are featured in the July issue of Prairie Business, including its digital edition.\n\nThis year’s Leaders & Legacies award winners are:\n\nAllen Arvig, president and CEO of Arvig\n\nThomas Astrup, president and CEO of American Crystal Sugar\n\nTwylah Blotsky, president and dealer principal of Butler Machinery Co.\n\nCharles Gorecki, CEO of the University of North Dakota’s Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC)\n\nNicole Kivisto, president and CEO of MDU Resources Group, Inc.\n\nDan Miller, principal architect and K12 practice studio leader at JLG Architects\n\nJared Nesje, CEO and principal architect at TSP, Inc.\n\nTodd Van Dusen, CEO and shareholder at Brady Martz & Associates\n\nFor more information, contact Carrie McDermott at 701-780-1276 or cmcdermott@prairiebusinessmagazine.com.\n\nFARGO — Target stores will no longer accept personal checks starting July 15.\n\nThe decision was made due to the low volume of checks being used at Target stores, according to Enoma Owens, a member of the Target communications team.\n\n\"Target is committed to creating an easy and convenient checkout experience, and that includes providing our guests with numerous ways to pay, including our new Target Circle Cards (formerly known as Target RedCard); cash; digital wallets; SNAP/EBT; buy now, pay later services; and credit and debit cards,\" Owens said via statement. \"We have taken several measures to notify guests in advance to aid an easy and efficient checkout experience.\""
