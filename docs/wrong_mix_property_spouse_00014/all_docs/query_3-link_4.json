        "text": "The very same day that Krista Allen was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress at the 2023 Daytime Emmy Awards, news broke that the actress was out at THE BOLD & THE BEAUTIFUL where she has been playing Taylor since October 2021.\n\nThe actress confided to Deadline that she was told this October that her contract wouldn’t be renewed. “The craziest thing is right before I got dropped, I did the cast photo shoot, and then the next week they called and said, ‘We’re not going to keep your third year and thank you very much, you were wonderful and thank you, goodbye,’” Allen told the outlet. “And I was like, ‘What?!’”\n\nThe character of Taylor Hayes was originated by Hunter Tylo back in June 1990, and she last appeared in 2019. B&B recast with Allen, who had previously played a recast Billie Reed on DAYS OF OUR LIVES from 1996-99. “There was a lot of pushback early on from fans who said, ‘We do not want her recast. Please don’t,’” Allen confided. “I understood, because she had been their person.\n\n“So that was really hard for me at the very beginning, just stepping into that and knowing what I was up against,” she continued. “But somehow the fans accepted me and it became this beautiful love affair with the fan base as this new Taylor. So when the Emmy nominations came out and I was nominated, I was blown away. It was my first year as a recast. It was kind of like against all odds.”\n\nAllen also revealed that she is moving to Atlanta, Georgia. “It just seemed like the perfect time to go,” she admitted. “It’s turning the page on this really interesting chapter, and now we’re going to the next one.”"
