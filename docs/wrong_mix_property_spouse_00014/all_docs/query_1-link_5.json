        "text": "CASTLE star Nathan Fillion has started dating a former Baywatch babe with the pair sharing their love on social media.\n\nFillion, 44, has reportedly started dating George Clooney’s ex Krista Allen, also 44.\n\nUs Weekly reports that the pair have been together for a few months now.\n\nFillion used to date Beverly Hills 90210 actress Vanessa Marcil, Entourage favourite Perrey Reeves and his Castle co-star Stana Katic.\n\n“They met a few months ago through friends and it’s going really well. He’s met her son and they get along,” a source told Us Weekly. “Krista is super happy. She’s been kind of unlucky in love in the past and now she’s found this genuinely nice guy who treats her well. They are having a great time together.”\n\nThe pair even dressed up together for Halloween as a Minotaur and a Forest Nymph.\n\nAllen has been sharing a lot of pictures of the couple on her Instagram account.\n\nAllen, who starred in the movie Liar Liar and TV shows like Baywatch Hawaii and Days of our Lives, married producer Justin Moritt in 1996. They had a child, Jake, who is now 18, but divorced in 1999. She married Iranian rapper Mams Taylor in 2010 but they also divorced.\n\nAllen went on to date George Clooney for two years after meeting on the set of Confessions of a Dangerous Mind in 2002."
