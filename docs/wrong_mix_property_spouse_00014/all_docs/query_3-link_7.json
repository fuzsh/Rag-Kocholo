        "text": "By\n\nThe daytime world was a bit rocked last Friday when heading into the 50th annual Daytime Emmy Awards, an item broke that Krista Allen (Taylor Hayes) had been taken off contract at The Bold and the Beautiful and the series chose not to exercise its option for the third year of her three-year deal.\n\nWhile other insiders revealed to Deadline, that Allen was actually offered to go recurring with the soap opera, she turned it down. Now, Allen has finally arrived in her new digs in Atlanta. She had previously expressed she would be moving to Georgia following the Daytime Emmys last week.\n\nIronically, all this was playing out while Krista was a nominee in the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series category and taking to the red carpet at daytime’s biggest night of the year.\n\nWith an update via her X account on Thursday, Allen shared: “I made it to my new place in GA! I’m officially a bicoastal babe now! I’ve wanted to find a place out of CA for a long time. Amazing how a simple shift in perspective can make the biggest difference. Sometimes when you think you have been buried, you have actually just been divinely planted Here’s to all my new growth fam out there! U!!”\n\nLastly, she gave a shout out to #TeamTaylor her rapid B&B fans base and expressed:”I miss you as much as you miss me (frfr!) and I love you so BIG!!!!! You’ll never know how much I appreciate each and every one of you – or how much joy you give me – but, from the bottom of my heart … Thank you!”\n\nShare your well-wishes to Krista via the comment section below, and let us know if you hope she will be back on our daytime screens sometime in the future.\n\nUp Next\n\nJohn J.

There, he must contend with patients who work against him, doctors who harbor grim secrets, and perhaps even the very Devil himself.”\n\nFilming of the six-episode limited series for AMC/AMC+ is currently underway in New York / New Jersey for a 2025 premiere.\n\nLight won her first primetime Emmy in January of this year in the Guest Star category for her work Poker Face.

A daytime drama of this kind has not been on broadcast television in over 35 years, and we are certain it will fill that void and have positive appeal with African American audiences.”\n\nAs previously reported, Michele Val Jean serves as the creator, writer and showrunner of the series. Val Jean has a long history in daytime, having written for the soap operas: General Hospital, The Bold and the Beautiful, and Santa Barbara.\n\nMichele is also one of the executive producers of The Gates along with Sheila Ducksworth, Leon Russell, Derrick Johnson and Kimberly Doebereiner.\n\nThe unique content partnership of The Gates brings together CBS Studios, the NAACP and P&G Studios, a division of Procter and Gamble, who also has a history of soap opera television productions including: As the World Turns, Edge of Night, and Guiding Light.\n\nSo, glad to know that CBS and NuTime Media are actively looking for national advertisers to support ‘The Gates?’ Comment below.\n\nAll My Children\n\n(EXCLUSIVE) Cameron Mathison Shares Sentiments on the Loss of All My Children Leading Lady, Esta TerBlanche, “She Was Just a Beautiful Soul”\n\nBy\n\nThe soap opera world has been in mourning over the weekend, with the news of the death of Esta TerBlanche, who played Gillian Andrassy Lavery on ABC’s All My Children from 1997-2001.\n\nEsta’s leading man during her run in Pine Valley was Cameron Mathison (ex-Ryan Lavery, AMC now, Drew Quartermaine, GH). The love story of Ryan and Gillian was complex. He believed that Gillian was a wealthy princess; and she believed Ryan made enough money to support her. When Ryan discovered that Gillian was penniless, he chose to stay with her and the two were eventually married. Later, Gillian was killed when TerBlanche wanted to return to her native South Africa.\n\nIn an exclusive statement to Michael Fairman TV on Sunday, Mathison expressed, “Esta was somebody very, very close to my heart. We both came to New York around the same time and basically started and learned acting together. Ryan and Gillian are such a beautiful sweet couple … and hold a very, very special place in my heart.”\n\nSpeaking on TerBlanche’s love of animals and reconnecting with her in 2023, Cameron recounted, “Esta was literally one of the sweetest kindest people I’ve eve met. When she heard that my dog (Red) was sick and paralyzed last year, she volunteered to take him for a few days to try to care for him to give me a break. We hadn’t really been in touch for a long time so it came out of nowhere and after spending time with her, he learned how to walk again. 🙏”\n\nIn closing Mathison shared, “She was just a beautiful soul and had a healing spirit.” TerBlanche died unexpectedly on Thursday. The cause of death has not yet been determined.\n\nCameron also took to his Instagram Story on Sunday, sharing some images of himself and Esta with one said from All My Children, which read,”RIP my sweet princess.”\n\nWhen All My Children came to its conclusion in 2011, Ryan was reunited with Gillian one more time when he received a ‘heavenly’ visit from his princess. Now with TerBlanche’s death, it makes the scenes all the more poignant.
