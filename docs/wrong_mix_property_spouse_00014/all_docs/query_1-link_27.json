        "text": "Constance Zimmer, the woman behind so many memorable Entourage quotes as Dana Gordon on the hit HBO series, married Russ Lamoureux on Saturday!\n\nWho knew Columbus Day was such a popular wedding date? From Dave Annable to Alexa Vega to Krista Allen and Mams Taylor, everybody’s married!\n\nHere are your latest two celebrity newlyweds!\n\nConstance Zimmer is now Mrs. Russ Lamoureux!\n\n“Having a wedding ceremony in a rooftop garden above Sunset Boulevard with all your closest friends watching you come down the aisle, it was just overwhelming, in a good way,” Zimmer said. “I have to say, it was a night we didn’t want to end.”\n\nSurrounded by family and guests such as Tiffani Thiessen, Sarah Chalke, Busy Philipps and Julie Bowen, Zimmer reports that she wore a vintage re-creation by L.A. designers Karen Zambos and Nony Tochterman of Petro Zillia.\n\n“When the ceremony was over everyone popped into a photo booth before heading downstairs for a family-style dinner,” she says. “We had drinks while the sun went down. No one wanted to leave. We curled up on the giant velvet couches.”\n\nThe couple, who dated for four years, got engaged in June and have a 2-year-old daughter, Colette Zoe. Zimmer will next be seen in NBC’s Love Bites.\n\nCongratulations to the couple!"
