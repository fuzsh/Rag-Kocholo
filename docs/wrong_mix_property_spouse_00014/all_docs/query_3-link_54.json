        "text": "American actress (1951–2022)\n\nKirstie Louise Alley[1] (January 12, 1951 – December 5, 2022) was an American actress. Her breakthrough role was as Rebecca Howe in the NBC sitcom Cheers (1987–1993), for which she received an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe in 1991. From 1997 to 2000, Alley starred as the lead in the sitcom Veronica's Closet, earning additional Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. On film, she played Mollie Jensen in Look Who's Talking (1989) and its two sequels, Look Who's Talking Too (1990) and Look Who's Talking Now (1993).\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, Alley appeared in various films, including Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982), Summer School (1987), Shoot to Kill (1988), Madhouse (1990), Sibling Rivalry (1990), Village of the Damned (1995), It Takes Two (1995), Deconstructing Harry (1997), For Richer or Poorer (1997), and Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999).\n\nAlley won her second Emmy Award in 1994 for the television film David's Mother. In 1997, Alley received another Emmy nomination for her work in the crime drama series The Last Don. In 2005, Alley played a fictionalized version of herself on Showtime's Fat Actress, something she would also do on episodes of King of Queens and Hot in Cleveland, as well as in Syrup (2013). In 2013, Alley returned to acting with the title role on the sitcom Kirstie. In 2016, she appeared on the Fox comedy horror series Scream Queens.\n\nAlley also appeared in reality television including Kirstie Alley's Big Life (2010) and served as a contestant on the 12th season of Dancing with the Stars (2011–2012), where she finished in second place, behind Hines Ward, and the 22nd series of the British reality show Celebrity Big Brother (2018), in which Alley finished as runner-up. In early 2022, she appeared on The Masked Singer.\n\nAlley was born in Wichita, Kansas, on January 12, 1951,[1] to Robert Deal Alley, who owned a lumber company,[2] and Lillian Alley.[3] She had two siblings, Colette and Craig.\n\nAlley attended Wichita Southeast High School, where she graduated in 1969.[2] She attended college at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas, where she dropped out after completing her sophomore year.[2]\n\nAfter leaving Kansas State, she moved to Los Angeles to pursue Scientology and work as an interior designer. In 1979, she appeared as a contestant on the game show Match Game,[4] where she won both her games and went on to win $500 in her first Super Match and $5,500 in her second.[5] In 1980, Alley appeared on the game show Password Plus. On both game shows, she described her profession as interior designer. In 1981, an automobile crash involving a drunk driver[3] killed Alley's mother and left her father seriously injured.[2]\n\nIn 1982, Alley made her film debut in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan in the role of the Vulcan Starfleet officer Lieutenant Saavik.[6] The Saavik character became very popular with Star Trek fans, but Alley chose not to reprise the role in the next two film sequels so the role was recast.[7]\n\nFrom 1983 to 1984, she was a regular on the ABC television series Masquerade.[8] In the years following, Alley starred in a number of smaller films, including One More Chance, Blind Date and Runaway.\n\nIn 1985, she starred in the ABC miniseries North and South,[9] and also portrayed feminist icon Gloria Steinem in the television movie A Bunny's Tale.[8] In 1987, Alley starred alongside Mark Harmon in the comedy film Summer School. The film was a box office success, grossing over $35 million in the United States.[10] She followed up with roles in films such as Shoot to Kill (1988), Madhouse (1990), and Sibling Rivalry (1990).\n\nIn 1987, Alley joined the cast of the NBC sitcom Cheers, where she played Rebecca Howe. She replaced Shelley Long. Alley remained with the show for six years until its eleventh and final season,[11] and earned an Emmy Award and Golden Globe.\n\nIn 1989, she starred with John Travolta in Look Who's Talking. The film grossed over $295 million worldwide. They then went on to make two other films centered on the same theme, Look Who's Talking Too (1990) and Look Who's Talking Now (1993).[12] After two Emmy Award nominations for her work on Cheers, in 1988 and 1990, Alley won the Emmy on her third nomination, in 1991.[13] In her acceptance speech, Alley memorably thanked \"my husband Parker, the man who has given me the big one for the last eight years.\"[14]\n\nAlley earned her second Emmy for the 1994 television film David's Mother.[13] For her contributions to the film industry, Alley received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard in 1995.[15] Her later films included Village of the Damned (1995), It Takes Two (1995), Deconstructing Harry (1997), For Richer or Poorer (1997), and Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999).\n\nFrom 1997 to 2000, Alley played the title character and was executive producer in the NBC sitcom Veronica's Closet, where she earned another Emmy and Golden Globe nomination. From 2000 to 2004, she served as a commercial spokesperson for Pier 1 Imports, and for Jenny Craig from 2004 to 2007.[16] In 2005, Alley played a fictionalized version of herself on the show Fat Actress. In 2010, she was in the reality show Kirstie Alley's Big Life. From 2011 to 2012, Alley appeared as a contestant on seasons 12 and 15 of Dancing with the Stars, partnering with Maksim Chmerkovskiy.[17][18]\n\nBeginning in December 2013, TV Land aired a sitcom that centered on Alley as Broadway star Madison \"Maddie\" Banks, who reconnects with her adult son who she gave up for adoption shortly after he was born. The series was titled Kirstie, and reunited her with former Cheers co-star Rhea Perlman and Seinfeld star Michael Richards.[19] The series ran for five months.[20]\n\nIn 2018, Alley appeared on season 22 of the British series Celebrity Big Brother; she finished in second place.[17]\n\nIn 2022, Alley competed in season seven of The Masked Singer as \"Baby Mammoth\" of Team Cuddly.[21]\n\nAlley was married from 1971 to 1977 to her high school sweetheart Bob Alley, who coincidentally had the same name as her father.[22][23] Alley married actor Parker Stevenson on December 22, 1983.[24] After a miscarriage, the couple adopted their first child, a son, in October 1992, and in 1995, they adopted their second child, a girl.[24] The marriage ended in 1997.[23] In 2016, Alley became a grandmother through her son.[25]\n\nIn 1988 and 2000 respectively, Alley purchased estates in Jacksonville, Oregon, and Clearwater, Florida, retaining ownership of both properties until her death in 2022.[26][27] From 1991 to 2020, Alley also resided on Islesboro Island, Maine. She once owned the Mitchell Cottage, formerly the Islesboro Inn, with her then husband Stevenson.[28]\n\nOn The Dr. Oz Show on September 17, 2012, Alley said she started gaining weight in late 2003, and that she had been a compulsive eater all her life without gaining weight, only noticing the change after she reached early menopause in 1992.[29]\n\nWhile working as a Jenny Craig spokesperson from 2004 to 2007, Alley lost 75 pounds (34 kilograms), bringing her weight down to 145 pounds (66 kg).[30]\n\nIn May 2009, Alley told People magazine that, after parting ways with Jenny Craig, she gained 83 pounds (38 kg) and weighed as much as 228 pounds (103 kg).[31]\n\nIn March 2010, after gossip blogger Roger Friedman alleged a link between her Organic Liaison weight-loss system and the Church of Scientology, Alley denied it on the Today show.[32] In September 2011, Alley announced that she had lost 100 pounds (45 kg) using weight loss products from Organic Liaison.[33] In 2012, Alley faced a class-action lawsuit alleging false advertising; the suit claimed that her weight loss was the result of exercise, including training for the TV show Dancing with the Stars, not Organic Liaison products. Alley settled the suit in 2013, agreeing to remove the term \"Proven Products\" from packaging, issue a disclaimer on the brand's website that it is a \"calorie-based weight-loss product\", and pay a $130,000 settlement.[34][35]\n\nIn April 2014, Alley resumed a role as a spokesperson with Jenny Craig; the Organic Liaison product line was acquired by Jenny Craig's parent company, and subsequently integrated into Jenny Craig's product line.[34] In January 2015, Alley said that, since starting the Jenny Craig weight-loss program again, she had lost 50 pounds (23 kg).[36]\n\nAlley was raised as a Methodist;[37] she became a member of the Church of Scientology in 1979. Alley said that until she became a Scientologist she was addicted to cocaine but then went through Narconon, a Scientology-affiliated drug treatment program[38] to end her addiction.[39] By 2007, Alley attained the level of OT VII (Operating Thetan Level 7),[40] and by 2018, she was New OT VIII.[41][42] In January 2008, Alley said, \"Scientology made me a lot stronger and tougher...It's made me more honest and more willing to take responsibility for other people.\"[17] Alley gave $5 million to the church in 2007.[43]\n\nDue to her commitment to the Church of Scientology, Alley decided not to reprise her role as Rebecca Howe on any episode of the Cheers spinoff Frasier, because the series was centered on the field of medical psychiatry, with different ideas than those of the Church; Alley was the only former Cheers regular not to do so.[44]\n\nAlley said she supported both Democratic and Republican presidential nominees and independent Ross Perot in 1992, but decided not to vote in 1988 and 2004.[45][46] In August 2015, Alley tweeted that she would not support Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, during the 2016 presidential election, and on April 8, 2016, Alley tweeted her support for Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani.[47][48] On October 8, 2016, Alley retracted her endorsement of Trump, tweeting, \"I hate this election and I'm officially no longer endorsing either candidate.\"[49]\n\nIn October 2020, Alley said that she voted for Trump in 2016 and intended to vote for him again in 2020 because \"he's NOT a politician.\"[50] Alley endorsed Republican John James in the 2020 U.S. Senate election in Michigan.[51]\n\nIn May 2022, Alley was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, following a doctor’s visit for a sore back, and subsequently underwent chemotherapy treatments at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida.\n\nOn December 5, 2022, Alley died at her home in Clearwater, Florida, at the age of 71.[52][53][54][55]\n\nAlley's ex-husband Parker Stevenson, her two children, her Look Who's Talking co-star John Travolta,[56] and other celebrities posted their condolences on social media.[57] Her Cheers co-stars Ted Danson, Kelsey Grammer, and Rhea Perlman released statements memorializing her.[58]\n\nList of performances by Kirstie Alley in film Year Title Role Notes 1982 Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Saavik [59] 1983 One More Chance Sheila [60] 1984 Champions Barbara [60] Blind Date Claire Simpson [60] Runaway Jackie Rogers [60] 1987 Summer School Ms. Robin Elizabeth Bishop [60] 1988 She's Having a Baby Herself Uncredited[61] Shoot to Kill Sarah Rennell [60] 1989 Loverboy Dr. Joyce Palmer [60][59] Look Who's Talking Mollie Jensen [60] 1990 Madhouse Jessie Bannister [59] Sibling Rivalry Marjorie Turner [60][59] Look Who's Talking Too Mollie Jensen Ubriacco [59] 1993 Look Who's Talking Now [59] 1995 Village of the Damned Dr. Susan Verner [59] It Takes Two Diane Barrows [60] 1996 Sticks & Stones Joey's mother [59] 1997 Nevada McGill Also co-producer[60] Deconstructing Harry Joan [60] For Richer or Poorer Caroline Sexton [60] 1999 The Mao Game Diane Highland [60] Drop Dead Gorgeous Gladys Leeman [60] 2004 Back by Midnight Gloria Beaumont [59] 2013 Syrup Kirstie Alley [59] 2015 Accidental Love Aunt Rita [60]\n\nList of performances by Kirstie Alley in television Year Title Role Notes 1978 Quark Handmaiden (uncredited) Episode: \"The Old and the Beautiful\"[62] 1979 Match Game Herself 3 episodes[62] 1980 Password Plus Herself 1 episode 1983 Highway Honeys Draggin' Lady Television film[63] The Love Boat Marion Stevens Episode: \"The World's Greatest Kisser/Don't Take My Wife, Please/The Reluctant Father\"[59] 1983–84 Masquerade Casey Collins Main cast[60] 1984 Sins of the Past Patrice Cantwell Television film[59] 1985 A Bunny's Tale Gloria Steinem Television film[59] 1985–86 North and South Virgilia Hazard Miniseries; main cast[59] 1985–87 The Hitchhiker Jane L.
