Quotes

I believe there is a power greater than me, greater than anything I could ever achieve in my own way of thinking, because my best thinking has gotten me into some pretty messy places in my life!

You Vs You Baby, Own that sh*t.

The best portion of your life will be small, nameless moments you spend smiling with someone who matters to you.

When you do things from the soul other people really dig that sh*t.
