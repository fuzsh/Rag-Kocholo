Krista Allen, who portrayed Dr. Taylor Hayes in the renowned daytime drama The Bold and the Beautiful has voiced her astonishment over her sudden exit from the show. After a two-year stint on the popular soap opera, the 52-year-old actress found herself unexpectedly dropped from her role.

Allen attended the 50th Daytime Emmy Awards this past Saturday, where she expressed her bewilderment over the decision.

"I have no idea what's going on," she confessed, adding that she had been aware of her impending departure for some time, but CBS had not made an official announcement.

In a conversation with PEOPLE, Allen expressed her frustration over the situation. "The contract was dropped, which is so crazy. It's like, make that make sense," she said.
