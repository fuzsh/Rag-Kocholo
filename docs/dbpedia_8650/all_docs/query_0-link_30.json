NEW YORK DODD, MEAD AND COMPANY 1920 Digitized by Google HARVARD IUNIVER5ITY LIBRARY OCT 15 1940 Copyright, 1920, by DODD, MEAD & CO., Inc. Digitized by Google PREFACE In the present volume — the thirteenth of the new series which began in 1907, and the eighteenth since the work was originally undertaken in 1898 — the following articles may be mentioned as among those most likely to be useful for reference in discussions arising during the coming year: War of the Nations; War Finance; France; Great Britain; Germany ; Russia ; Socialism ; Industrial Reconstruction ; the groups of articles dealing with labor subjects, agriculture, industries, and applied science, including Chemistry, Industrial; Aeronautics; Shipping; Shipbuilding; topics in Engineering; Military Progress; Naval Prog- ress, etc. The discussion of controverted questions arising from the Treaty will be found under War of the Nations and in the articles on the countries concerned, along with summaries of the treaties, and other im- portant documents and the text of the Covenant. News throughout the year being wholly at the mercy of propagandism, the facts in regard to controverted international topics were not accessible, and it was neces- sary to give the opposing versions at some length. The articles on Lit- erature seem to indicate that the war did not diminish the fertility of au- thors, and in the case of German Literature, that it did not seriously al- ter their point of view. The political sections of the article on the United States will be found convenient for reference in the Presidential cam- paign. The antecedents of the present Irish situation are given under the title of The Irish Question in the article on Great Britain. Frank Moore Colby.

Naturalist, died at Bristol, Pennsylvania, July 27; well known as the author of many works on natural history. He was born at Trenton, New Jersey, June 4, 1843; graduated at Princeton and made a repu- tation as a collector of valuable archaeological specimens. He was assistant in the Peabody Museum from 1876 to 1889 and a member of various learned bodies. The list of his writings includes the following: The Stone Age in New Jersey (1876); Primitive Industry (1881); A Naturalist 1 8 Rambles About Home (1884); Up- land and Meadow (1886); Wasteland Wander- ings (1887); Days Out of Doors (1889); Out- ings at Odd Times (1890); Recent Rambles (1892) ; Travels in a Treetop (1894) ; The Birds About Us (1894); Notes of the Night (1895); A Colonial Wooing (novel, 1895) ; Birdland Echoes (1896); When the Century Was New (novel, 1897); The Hermit of Nottingham (novel, 1897); The Freedom of the Fields (1898); Clear Skies and Cloudy (1899); In Nature's Realm (1900) ; Archaeological Explora- tions in the Valley of the Delaware (1894); Rambles of an Idler (1906) ; Archaeologia Nova Caesarea (1907, 1908, 1909); Ten Years' Dig- gings in Len&pe Land (1912). ABYSSINIA. A North African monarchy ly- ing to the southwest of the Red Sea, and bounded on the west by Sudan, Massaua, the French Somali Coast, and the British Somali pro- tectorate, and on the northwest and south by British East Africa, and the Uganda Protector- ate. It has an estimated area of 350,000 square miles and an estimated population of over eight millions. It comprises nine provinces, namely: Harar and dependencies; Wollo, Kassa and Magi; Gore; Tigrg; Damot and Go jam; Equa- torial provinces: Gondar, and Gima. The inde- pendence of Abyssinia was recognized by Italy in the convention of Addis Abeba on October 26, 1896; and the frontiers of the country were de- termined by treaties with Great Britain in 1902 and 1908, and with Italy in 1908, although in 1919 the Abyssinian government had not yet definitely accepted the delimitation. An im- portant agreement was reached on December 13, 1916, by Great Britain, France, and Italy as to their respective interests in the country. The three Powers agreed to the principle of the open door and to the guaranty by joint action, if necessary, of the safety of their interests. They undertook to preserve the integrity of Abyssinia and to abstain from interference in its internal affairs; and they agreed that any industrial con- cessions should be made to one of the Powers, in Y-B— 19— 1 such a manner as not to conflict with the inter- ests of the others. An agreement was also reached in regard to railway construction and in regard to equal treatment of the nationals of the three Powers in trade and transit. They pro- vided for the protection of the zone of the rail- way built by the French from Jibuti to Dire\", and agreed that the French should define the line to Addis Abeba, but stipulated that there should be equal treatment on the line for the three Powers. The British government was to receive a concession for the construction of railways west of Addis Abeba, and Italy for a line from Bena- dir to Eritrea. The Abyssinians have been Christians since their conversion in the fourth century, and are members of the Alexandrian church under a head bishop or Abuna who is always a Copt, and appointed by the patriarch of Alexandria. Illiteracy prevails, education being confined in general to the clergy. In October, 1907, an edict was passed declaring education compulsory for all male children over the age of twelve, but this has remained a dead letter. Agricul- ture and grazing are the main pursuits; but though the soil is capable of a fairly varied pro- duction, agriculture is backward and few prod- ucts are extensively cultivated. Cotton, coffee, sugar-cane, dates, and vines are raised to some extent, and minerals abound, including iron, coal, sulphur, copper and silver, but are not exten- sively worked. In some districts iron is obtained and manufactured into hatchets, knives, and other implements, and gold mining is carried on in many parts of the country. The chief exports are skins, hides, coffee, ivory, wax, civet, gums, spices, gold, rubber, and native butter. The imports comprise manufactures including cotton goods, arms and munitions, liquors, railway material, sugar and petroleum, the imports coming mainly from England, France, India, Italy and the United States. No complete figures for exports and imports are available. The ex- port of coffee into the Sudan was reported to be increasing. The exports through Jibuti in 1917 were reported as follows: Hides, 6,704,423 kilos; coffee, 5,092,647. The exports from Abys- sinia to the Sudan were reported for 1917 as fol- lows: coffee £E105,895; wax £E18,265. The total from Sudan in 1917 was reported at £E65,226. The Board of Trade returned the imports from Abyssinia into Great Britain for 1916 at £3330 and the exports to Abyssinia at £3774. The exports from Great Britain to Abyssinia in 1917 were reported at £3833, and in 1918 £13,102. Coffee is found in parts of the country where Digitized by Google ABYSSINIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES the altitude is from 4500 to 6500 and the pro- duction of Harari coffee is reported to be on the increase. This is a long-berry Mocha coffee and besides this there grows wild in southern and western parts of the country an abundant supply of the plant which yields the so-called Abyssinian coffee berry. Primitive conditions of barter still prevail, many articles being used as a medium of exchange, for example, bars of salt and cart- ridges. The unit of currency has been the Maria Theresa dollar to which has lately been added a new coin known as the Menelek dollar of about the same value. Manufactures are but little developed and confined chiefly to coarse cloth, pottery, leather, and iron implements. Means of communication are primitive and trans- port is carried on by pack-horses, mules, donkeys, and camels, the roads being mere trails. The French railway line from Jibuti to Dire* Dawa is 187 miles in length. A new company was formed to complete the line to Addis Abeba in 1909 which had nearly reached completion in 1915. Telegraph lines connect the capital with Harar and with Jibuti in French Somaliland and with Massaua in Eritrea, having a total length of about 1056 miles. The country is under practically a feudal re- gime, the soil theoretically belonging to the Negus (emperor). The notion of land as pri- vate property scarcely exists. The strength of the army is placed at 250,000 men. After the death of Menelek in December, 1913, his grand- son, Lidj Yasu, succeeded, but was deposed Sep- tember 27, 1916, and succeeded by his aunt, Ouizero Zeoditu (or Waizero Zauditu), born 1876. who was crowned at Addis Abeba, Febru- ary 11, 1917. The Ras Taffari was proclaimed regent and heir to the throne. The new govern- ment was recognized by Great Britain. During 1917, -18, and -19, conditions of civil war were reported. ACADEMY, French (AcadSmie Francaise). The oldest, and officially considered the highest of the five academies constituting the Institute of France; founded in 1635 by Cardinal Riche- lieu. It was reorganized in 1816, and has been recognized as an arbiter in literary questions. Its forty members, known as the Forty Im- mortals, are for the most part distinguished men of letters, but among them are found men eminent in public service, such as M. Clemenceau and Marshals Joffre and Foch. In 1919 the Academy was still at work upon its monumen- tal dictionary with which it has been associated from the beginning. In fact the Academy's work upon it goes back to the year of founda- tion, for it made a decision on March 20, 1634, to undertake a dictionary which should assure the purity of the French language. Work did not begin on it, however, until December 14, 1637. The editions of the dictionary were seven in number as follows: 1694, 1718, 1740, 1762, 1793, 1835, and 1878. The edition upon which the Academy was at work in 1919, accordingly, was the eighth, and in the autumn of that year it had proceeded as far as the letter F. In 1919 Pierre Masson was elected permanent secretary in place of Pierre Lamy deceased. For further particulars, see the article French Literature. ACADEMY OF ARTS AND LETTERS, American. This society was founded in 1904 by seven members of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, on the model of the French Acad- emy. Its membership is limited to fifty mem- bers. In 1909 a series of annual meetings was begun. Mr. William Dean Howells has been president of the Academy since its founding. The annual meeting was held Nov. 19, 1919, in New York. During the year the Academy has lost three of its members: Theodore Roosevelt, Kenyon Cox, and Henry Mills Alden. Three new members were elected: Charles A. Piatt, of New York; Maurice Francis Egan, of Wash- ington ; and Archer M. Huntington, of New York. This still left one vacancy in the society. Dur- ing the first part of 1919 a series of lectures were held at the Chemists' Club in New York. Four of these were on \"The Victory/' three on \"The Failure of German Kultur,\" and one on \"The Academy and the English Language.\" On Feb- ruary 19-22 a commemoration of the centenary of the birth of James Russell Lowell was held in New York. Hon. Elihu Root presided at a din- ner on February 20th, while other speakers were John Galsworthy, Maurice Hutton, and Prof. Brander Matthews. Literary exercises were held on February 22nd, the speakers being: William Milligan Sloane, Barrett Wendell, Al- fred Noyes, Stephen Butler Leacock, Edgar Lee Masters, and Samuel McChord Crothers. A re- port of this commemoration was published by the Academy, which also published a book entitled The World War: Utterances Concerning its Issues and Conduct by Members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. The Academy has under way a project to undertake \"the work of establishing through local endowments a museum of art in every one of the States (more than, thirty) which lack such an institution.\" In 1919 the membership list was as follows: William Dean Howells, John Singer Sargent, Daniel Chester French, John Burroughs, James Ford Rhodes, Horatio William Parker, \\Y T illiam Milligen Sloane, Robert Underwood Johnson, George Washington Cable, Henry van Dyke, Wil- liam Crary Brownell, Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve, Woodrow Wilson, Arthur Twining Hadley, Henry Cabot Lodge, Edwin Howland Blashfield, Thomas Hastings, Brander Matthews, Thomas Nelson Page, Elihu Vedder, George Edward Woodberry, George Whitefield Chadwick, Abbott Henderson Thayer, George deForest Brush, William Ruther- ford Mead, Bliss Perry, Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Nicholas Murray Butler, Paul Wayland Bartlett, Owen Wister, Herbert Adams, Augustus Thomas, Timothy Cole, Cass Gilbert, William Roscoe Thayer, Robert Grant, Frederick MacMonnies, Julian Alden Weir, William Gillette, Paul Elmer More, Barrett Wendell, Gari Melchers, Elihu Root, Brand Whitlock, Hamlin Garland, Paul Shorey, Charles Piatt, Maurice Francis Egan, Archer Huntington. The permanent Secretary of the Academy is Robert Underwood Johnson. ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, National. A body of distinguished American scientists in- corporated by Act of Congress, March 3, 1863, for the purpose of promoting scientific research and of examining, investigating, and reporting upon any subject of science or art when called upon to do so by any department of the gov- ernment. The autumn meeting was held Nov. 10th-12th at Yale University, New Haven, Conn. Among the topics discussed were \"Four Cliff Islands in the Coral Seas,\" -by W. M. Davis; \"A Study in Synthetic Paleontology,\" by Richard S. Lull; \"A New Method for Determining the Solar Con- stant of Radiation,\" by C. G.

British mem- ber of Parliament, died at Exeter, England, February 18th. He was born in 1842, educated at Exeter and at Oxford, and called to the bar in 1868. He went into politics on the Liberal side and became a member of Parliament in 1882, continuing to sit till 1892. In 1886 he was secretary to the Board of Trade. ACTIVATED SLUDGE. See Sewerage. ACTORS' STRIKE. See Strikes and Lock- outs. ADELPHI COLLEGE. A non-sectarian in- stitution of learning at Brooklyn, N. Y. In the summer school of 1919 the enrollment was 167 and in the fall that in the women's college was 392. There were 26 members in the faculty. The library contains 17,500 volumes. President, Frank D. Blodgett, LL.D. Adelphi was founded in 1806. ADEN. A British territory, consisting of a volcanic peninsula on the Arabian Coast, about a hundred miles east of Bab el Mandeb, and form- ing a part of the Presidency of Bombay. Area, 75 square miles; with the Island of Perim 80,000 square miles; population of Aden and Perim (1911), 46,105. The Protectorate of Aden has an area of about 9000 square miles and a popu- lation of about 100,000. It is an important coal- ing station on the route to the East and is strongly fortified. The chief industry is salt production and next to that comes the manufac- ture of cigarettes. The trade is mainly transit. In 1917-18 imports of private merchandise by sea were valued at £4,064,758; by land £128,814; imports of treasure £333,218. Private exports by sea in that year were £3,429,175; by land £1062; treasure £174,514. The chief imports were cotton goods, grain, hides, and skins, to- bacco, coal and provisions; and the chief exports were coffee, gums, hides, and skins, cotton goods, and other provisions. The shipping in 1917-18 included 568 merchant vessels of 1,174,891 tons entered, and of these 301 were British. There is a wireless station in Aden maintained by the Protectorate. ADVANCEMENT OP SCIENCE, American Association for the. Founded in 1848, this is an association whose main principle is that in a democracy, where no dependence can be had upon a leisure class, science can only be sup- ported as a result of the organization of scien- tific men. The association has, since its begin- ning, done work of the greatest importance in encouraging scientific research and promoting interest in its results. It consists of affiliated national societies which either meet regularly on their own account, or during the annual con- vention week of the association, which is held at the close of each year. During the last 10 years meetings have been held in Baltimore, Boston, Minneapolis, Washington, Cleveland, At- lanta, Philadelphia, Columbus, New York, and Pittsburgh. There is also a Pacific Coast Di- vision which holds meetings independently in the summer time and a general meeting under its direction was held in 1915. The annual meeting in 1919 was held in St. Louis on December 29th-31st. Dr. James L. Tryon, of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology spoke on the proposed Lodge reserva- tions to the League of Nations, saying that these reservations did not destroy the covenant, but merely Americanized it. Prof. Wm. H. Hobbs, of the University of Michigan, spoke against the League, quoting from President Wil- son, Theodore Roosevelt, Wm. H. Taft, and oth- ers. Prof. Charles M. Bakewell, of Yale Uni- versity, spoke for the League. Frank H. Fay- ant, of New York City, and editor of the Railway jVet/?8 Journal, spoke on \"Freight Rates.\" He denied that increased freight rates had added greatly to the cost of living. He said that \"transportation was never before so cheap in relation to prices as it is to-day.\" Frank W. Noxon, of New York, spoke on the Esch and Cummins bills for the return of the railroads to private ownership. Morris Fay, a prominent New York banker, denounced the excess profit tax as \"unjust, unsound, and dangerous.\" He declared that a tax of 1 per cent on Bales would bring the government about $5,000,000,000 an- nually, without having a demoralizing effect on capital. The official organ of the association is the weekly journal Science. The membership is nearly 15,000. ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE, Associa- tions for the. Important bodies of scientists in the United States and foreign countries or- ganized for the purpose of promoting the unity of scientific endeavor among the nations.

The largest branch of this denomination is the Seventh-Day Adventists. The report of 1919 shows the following figures: 4181 churches with 162,667 members, showing Digitized by Google ADVBNTISTS AEBONATTTICS an increase of 10,000 over 1918; 1102 ordained ministers; 5610 Sabbath schools with a mem- bership of 171,914, showing an increase of over 30,000 over 1918; 1446 Young Peoples' Societies with a membership of 27,879; 41 publishing houses, printing 142 periodicals in 94 languages; 32 sanitariums with 2065 employees including 144 physicians; total funds contributed amounted to $6,895,719.82 during the year. There are 158 mission fields. There are 77 educational insti- tutions connected with the church, 16 of which carry full college courses, notably Loma Linda College, Pacific Union College, Union College, and Walla Walla College. Other branches of Adventists are: Adventist Christian Church, with (1916) 30,316 communi- cants, 640 churches, and 826 ministers (the figures for 1919 being about the same) ; Advent- ist Church of God, with about 10,000 communi- cants, 100 churches and 80 ministers in 1919; Life and Advent Union, with about 700 com- municants, 20 churches, and 15 ministers; and the Churches of God in Christ Jesus with about 4000 communicants, 90 churches and 50 minis- ters. AERONAUTICS. The record in aeronautics for 1919 is one somewhat difficult to summarize inasmuch as the termination of the war ma- terially changed the aspect and conditions of use, manufacture, and development. Naturally there was considerable reaction attending the demobilization of the aSro squadrons of the hostile armies and the partial cessation of manu- facturing of war aircraft. On the other hand the problems of peace became more distinct and conspicuous, and an earnest attempt was made to consider the airplane and the dirigible on a strictly utility basis. Government planes were devoted to mail carrying on regular routes, pas- senger service was attempted, and the large bombing planes of the war were being considered as available for freight or passenger service. Scientific and technical studies continued rather in the nature of improvement of detail and design than to secure radical departures or innovations. Power, capacity and safety were naturally con- sidered of increasing importance, and work along these lines continued. The manufacturing in- dustry was slow in stabilizing itself after the war, and in the United States the failure of the government to settle on a fixed policy as to its control of aircraft and its development in the future was another contributing cause. Of course the outstanding events of the year were the notable transatlantic flights by air- planes and dirigibles and these are outlined in the following paragraphs. Transatlantic Flights. The year 1919 was memorable in the history of aviation for the first flights across the Atlantic Ocean by both aeroplane and dirigible. It will be recalled that the year 1909 marked Louis Blenot's successful attempt to cross the British Channel, and in the course of 10 years the science and art of avia- tion had developed to a point where a sustained flight in the air had become commonplace. The first successful flight across the Atlantic was , achieved by aviators of the United States navy using NC flying boats, jointly developed by the United States navy and the Curtiss Engi- neering Corporation, the N in the designation standing for navy and the C for Curtiss. These flying boats were able to plow through rough water up to a speed of 60 miles per hour, and then take to the air and fly at a speed of over 90 miles per hour. The hull or boat proper was 44 feet 9 inches in length by 10 ft. beam, with six water-tight compartments in which were the rest quarters, navigating compartment, gasoline tanks and space for the radio apparatus and its operator. A minimum crew consisted of five men, though under certain circumstances extra men could be carried for relief. The wings had a total area of 2380 square feet, while the tail had over 500 square feet area. It was different in design and construction from other flying machines, being made up in the general form of a biplane. There were four Liberty engines mounted between the wings, each having a capac- ity of 400 brake horse power, so that when the full load of 28,500 pounds was carried, the weight is 17.5 pounds per horse power. There is a tractor propeller on each side of the centre line driven by an engine, and on the centre line itself the two remaining engines are mounted in tan- dem, the front one driving a tractor propeller and the rear engine a pusher propeller. The principal dimensions and characteristics of the NC type of flying boat are as follows: Engines 4 Liberty Power 1,600 h.p. Wing span 126 feet upper 94 feet lower Length 68 feet 5 V* inches Height 24 feet 5% inches Weight, empty 15,100 lbs. Weight, loaded 28,500 lbs. Useful load 13,400 lbs. Gravity tank 90 gals, capacity Fuel tanks 1,800 gals, capacity Oil tanks 160 gals, capacity The NC type was developed following a con- ference between engineers of the U. S. navy and the Curtiss Company held in November, 1917, at Washington, D. C, and in January of the fol- lowing year a working model was tested in a wind tunnel, and the design was found practical. Machines were straightway put under construc- tion, and in October, 1918, the NC-1 was given a trial flight at Rockaway Beach, Long Island. In the following months this flying boat made a trip from Rockaway to Anacostia, D. C, 358 miles, in 5 hours and 19 minutes. In the mean- time other planes of this type were completed, and in February, 1919, the NC-2 was given an altitude trial and climbed 2000 feet in 5 minutes. So satisfactory were the trials of these planes that on February 24th Secretary Daniels ordered four planes to be prepared for the transatlantic flight, and work was begun at Rockaway. On April 3rd the design of the hull of the NC-2 was found impractical and it was taken out of the flight, but the NC-3 and the NC-4 were assembled at Rockaway. The latter was damaged by fire while in the hangar, but the wings were replaced, the elevators repaired, and everything was put in readiness, so that on May 8th at 10 a.m. the three planes, NC-1, NC-3 and NC-4 were able to leave Rockaway for Trepassey Bay, Newfound- land. On account of trouble with the oil feed the NC-4 was forced to make a landing about 100 miles off Chatham, Massachusetts, after a trip of 300 knots. The defect was reme- died and a new engine was substituted a few days later, so that on May 14th the NC-4 was able to proceed from Chatham to Halifax in 4 hours and 10 minutes, a distance of 320 knots. The NC-1 and the NC-3 completed their trip from Rocka- way to Halifax on the day they started, a dis- Digitized by Google w # o N < < H # O o 5 < H U 5? Digitized by Google Digitized by Google AERONAUTICS AERONAUTICS tance of 529 miles, and on May 10th they pro- ceeded from Halifax to Trepassey, making 529 miles in 6 hours and 56 minutes for NC-1 and 5 hours and 32 minutes for NC-3. Here the squadron of three planes was again united, and on May 16th they left Trepassey Bay for the Azores, a distance of 1250 miles, starting at 10.03 in the afternoon, Greenwich Civil Time. The NC-4, which was commanded by Com. A. G. Read, U. S. A., reached Horta, Azores, in 15 hours and 13 minutes, with an average speed of 78.4 knots per hour. The other flying boats were not as successful, \"lhe NC-1, commanded by Lieut.- Com. P. N. L. Bellinger, encountered dense fog and a rough sea, so that the crew was forced to take refuge on a passing steamship, the Ionia, which landed them at Horta. The seaplane was so damaged it sank. The NC-3 also encountered fog and heavy clouds, but was able to reach Ponta Delgada under its own power, having drifted and \"taxied\" 209 miles, and being so much damaged as to be out of the race. On May 20th the NC-4, now the only survivor in good flying condition, made the trip from Horta to Ponta Delgada, 160 miles, in 1 hour and 44 minutes, and then on May 27th flew from Ponta Delgada to Lisbon, Portugal, 810 miles, in 9 hours and 43 minutes, thus completing the trans- atlantic flight. The flying time from Newfound- land to Portugal, a distance of 2472 miles, was 26 hours, 51 minutes. The reception of the NC-4 at Portugal was most enthusiastic and cor- dial, and the greatest interest was manifested in both continents over the flight, and congratula- tions were bestowed at its successful termina- tion. The most careful preparations had been made by the Navy Department, and a patrol of destroyers was organized to maintain stations along the course to communicate by wireless with the flying boats. They were supplied with pyrotechnic and other signals to afford visible marks, and it was believed that the trip could be carried out with a minimum of danger and risk. lhe NC-4 left Lisbon on May 30th, and after a halt at Mondego, 100 miles north, owing to en- gine trouble, proceeded to Ferrol, Spain, 300 miles. On May 31st the NC-4 proceeded from Ferrol to Plymouth, and thus completed the transatlantic flight as scheduled. The total fly- ing time from Rockaway, New York, to Lisbon, Portugal, was 41 hours and 58 minutes, which is comparable with the fastest steamship passage made by the Cunard liner Mauretania of 4 days, 14 hours and 27 minutes from Liverpool to New York. Flight of the Vickebs \"Vimy\" Bomber. The first non-stop flight from America to Europe was accomplished by the Vickers \"Vimy\" Bomber, a bi -motored Rolls-Royce aeroplane with two 4-bladed propellers, which was piloted by Captain John Alcock and navigated by Lieut. Arthur W. Brown. The trip started at St. Johns, Newfoundland, at 12.13 p.m., New York time, on Saturday, June 14, and 16 hours and 12 minutes later a landing was made at Clifton, Galway, Ireland, at 4.40 a.m., New York time. The 1960 miles of the Atlantic Ocean were thus navigated at an average rate of 120 miles per hour. The trip was accomplished through fog and mist, but the engines functioned consistently, and the most important mishap was the failure of the radio instruments so that no connection was had with the outside world during the 16 hours of the trip. Captain Alcock and Lieu- tenant Brown were awarded the Daily Mail $50,- 000 prize for making the first non-stop flight between Europe and America, and their con- clusion, as expressed by Captain Alcock, was \"that the Atlantic flight is practicable, but I think it should be done not with an aeroplane or seaplane but with flying boats. We had plenty of reserve fuel left, using only two-thirds of our supply.\" Captain Alcock had been for many years interested in aviation and aeronautics, starting his experiments with gliders, and in 1911 began to fly. In 1913 he won the first race in which he ever entered, and shortly thereafter took second place in the London to Manchester and return competition. He was the first man to bomb Constantinople, and it was on his re- turn from his second bombing expedition over the Turkish capital that his engine failed, and forced to descend he was captured by the Turks. The Vickers \"Vimy\" plane was twin engined and had a 67 feet 2 inch wing spread, being 42 feet 8 inches in length with a gap of 10 feet and a chord of 10 feet 6 inches. It was of the bombing plane type and was transformed for peace work by replacing the fighting equipment with gasoline tanks with a total capacity of 870 gallons, lhe two Rolls-Royce Eagle 375 horse power engines were mounted between the upper and lower planes on either side of the fuselage. Hollow seamless steel tubing extending from the nose to well behind the planes was used in the construction, and a tank system of eight separate containers from which fuel could be consumed simultaneously at the same rate were important characteristics. A gravity tank at the top of the fuselage was arranged to be emptied first so that it could serve as a life raft any time after the first two hours of the flight. This 1960 mile flight established a new world record, breaking that of Captain Boehm in a Mercedes driven Albatross plane which flew for 25 hours and 1 minute and covered 1350 miles. England to Australia Flight. The prize of £10,000 offered by the Australian government for the first airplane flight from Great Britain to Australia within a maximum time of 30 days was won by Captain Ross Smith flying a Vickers- Vimy Rolls-Royce airplane. This journey of about 11,500 miles was accomplished in 27 days, 20 hours and 20 minutes, the departure being made on November 12th from Hounslow aerodrome and the landing on the northern coast of Australia taking place on December 10th at Port Darwin. The machine traveled by way of Lyons, Rome, Cairo, Delhi, Calcutta and Ran- goon, and arrived at Bangkok on December 1st. Leaving on the following day it reached Singa- pore on the 4th, and then on the 6th proceeded down the coast of Sumatra over the island of Java to Timor from which place the last stage was accomplished. Arrival at Port Darwin did not end the flight which, after a few days' rest, was continued across the island towards Mel- bourne. In competing for this same prize Cap- tain Howell and a companion who left Hounslow on December 4th met with disaster off Corfu on December 10th and lost their lives. Transatlantic Flights of the R-34. The British dirigible R-34 left East Fortune, near Edinburgh, Scotland, at 2 a.m., July 2, and proceeded via Newfoundland to Mineola, New York, arriving at Roosevelt Field at 9 a.m., Sun- day, July 6. To show that this was not merelv Digitized by Google AERONAUTICS 6 AERONAUTICS good fortune, a return trip even more successful was made, leaving New York at 11.58 on the night of July 9th. After a brief trip over the city of New York the nose of the dirigible was turned to Great Britain and after a voyage of 75 hours, 3 minutes, a successful landing was made at Polham, England, arriving at 9.15 a.m. on July 12th, a distance of 3200 miles. In other words, the R-34 flew practically 7000 miles in 183 hours and 15 minutes. The journey from Scotland to America was accomplished in spite of fog and heavy squalls and thunder storms and against constant head winds. The speed was thus reduced, so that it was uncertain whether the 5000 gallons supply of gasoline would be suf- ficient to keep the engines turning until Long Island was reached. Accordingly wireless mes- sages were sent for United States destroyers to stand by on the journey down from the Bay of Fundy, but assistance was not required, and a successful landing was made at the Mineola flying field. The return voyage was without incident, and general satisfaction was expressed at the outcome of the trip. The British naval dirigible R-34 in 1919 was the largest dirigible afloat, measuring 643 feet from nose to stern, and requiring a hangar 300 yards long. The envelope was built of sheet duraluminum towers 9iy 2 feet in height, and the beam is 71 feet. From the envelope are sus- pended 4 cars, one forward for the captain and pilot, 2 wing cars amidship, and an after car in which are the two engines attached to the same shaft that drive the largest of the four pro- pellers. The propellers of the forward and wing cars measure 17 feet 6 inches from tip to tip, while that on the after car measures 19 feet 6 inches, and was one of the largest ever made. Five Sunbeam Maori engines of 275 horse power each were used to drive these propellers. The R-34 attains a speed of from 40 to 60 knots an hour, and is capable of reaching an altitude of 15,000 feet, though her best height is 4000 feet. When fully inflated the airship has a capacity of 2,000,000 cubic feet of hydrogen, carries 13 tons of water for ballast, arranged in bags along the keel to keep the airship upright. The lifting power is furnished by 19 separate gas bags in- side the rigid envelope. These bags are so par- titioned that there is plenty of opportunity for the crew to pass freely throughout the interior of the envelope. There are 81 tanks, which were filled with 5670 gallons of gasoline when the R-34 left England. The airship is lighted throughout by electricity, with telephone and bell connection between the cars, and is rigged with various types of equipment, just as an ocean liner. The wireleBs of the airship is controlled from the captain's car forward and has a range of 800 miles for sending and receiving. The R-34 has a large beam capacity and carries a crew of 31 men. The officers on the trip to America were Maj. G. H. Scott, commanding officer and pilot; Maj. G. H. Cooke, B.S.O., navigator; Capt. G. S. Greenland, first officer; Lieut. J. D. Shotter, engineer officer; Lieut. H. F. Luck, third officer; while Brigadier-General Maitland and Major Pritchard represented the British Air Ministry and Lieut.-Com. Z. Lansdowne, O.B.E., the United States Naval Air Service. Lieutenant Guy Harris was meteorological officer and Second Lieut. R. D. Durrant was wireless officer. The crew of the R-34 consisted of 12 engineers and 7 recruits, beside 2 wireless men. Flight of Hawker and Grieve. An attempt was made to cross the Atlantic in a Sopwith bi- plane by Com. Mackenzie Grieve and Maj. Harry Hawker. This plane followed the general type of the Sopwith war plane, and was 46 feet wide and 31 feet long, weighing 6000 pounds fully equipped for flight. It was supposed to have a flight duration of 25 hours at 100 miles an hour, and was driven by a Rolls-Royce engine develop- ing 375 horse power and 1800 revolutions of the crank shaft. A 4-bladed propeller was used, geared down to 1281 revolutions. Several test flights were made in March and April which promised success, and on May 18th Hawker and Grieve flew from St. Johns, and after 15 hours in the air were forced to alight on the ocean 1000 miles east of their starting point and 900 miles from their destination. The difficulty was due to the choking of the filter and defects in the circulation system of the engine, and realizing that the motor was functioning improperly, the course was changed so as to cross the main ship- ping route. Sighting a steamer, which proved to be the Danish ship Mary, signals were made and the aviators were taken off in a rough sea, but it was impossible to save the aeroplane. Hawker and Grieve were about 14% hours from Newfoundland and accomplished about 1000 miles of the journey. The British destroyer Wolston made the Mary off Loch Eireball and the aviators were duly brought to land. Loss of the C-5. The American Navy dirigi- ble or Blimp C-5 left Montauk Point on May 14th in an attempt to cross the Atlantic by way of Halifax, at which port it arrived at 10 o'clock on the morning of May 16th, after being in the air almost 26 hours. A perfect landing was made at the Pleasantville base near St. Johns, and the dirigible was duly anchored within an old cricket field. Preparations were straightway begun for the transatlantic flight, but a treacherous gale arose which drove the' dirigible from its moorings and carried it out to sea, where it was totally destroyed. The dirigi- ble was under command of Lieutenant-Com- mander Coil, with Lieutenant Campbell and Lieut. J. B. Lawrence as navigating officers. The total distance of 1050 miles accomplished by the C-5 was a world's record for non-rigid airships as regards total distance covered with- out a stop. The C-5 was 192 feet long, 43 feet wide and 45 feet high, with a capacity of 180,- 000 cubic feet of gas. Its cruising speed was 42 miles per hour, and it could climb 1000 feet per minute. The car suspended from the gas bag was of streamline form 40 feet long, 5 feet in maximum diameter, with steel tube outriggers carrying an engine at either end. It had a capa- city of 7 passengers, though 4 formed the usual crew. The engines were made by the Union Gas Enerine Company, and were 125 horse power each. Tarrant Triplane. One of the most power- ful aeroplanes to be built in 1919 in England was the Tarrant triplane, a huge 6-engined 3000 horse power machine, fitted with six \"Napier\" Lion engines capable each of developing 507 horse power, and designed to obtain with full load a speed of over 90 miles per hour with two engines cut out. Fully loaded this machine weighed ap- proximately 45,000 pounds, of which 19,000 pounds represented the load, 10,000 pounds fuel, and 9000 pounds available for passenger or cargo. Its maximum speed was over 110 miles an hour, and sufficient fuel was carried to maintain this Digitized by Google .1 > o e a c _J ° Eu -a £ < « a *•§ ^^ >-S • IS I/) o. >•» H 9 e J2 < 1 < 4 J2 p Digitized by Google Digitize cw^Googk- AEBONAUTICS AERONAUTICS for over 900 miles, while at cruising speed a distance of 1200 miles could be covered. This was a triplane with the middle plane having a span of 131 feet 3 inches, with a total surface of wings of 4950 feet and an over all height of 37 feet 3 inches and over all length of 73 feet 2 inches. It was designed for a crew of five men provided with wireless equipment, guns and am- munition and bombs and gear, and was con- sidered a machine of unusual power, some 13 months being required for its construction. On May 26th, during a trial flight, this large machine was seriously damaged, and the chief and assistant pilots, Capt. F. G. Dunn and Capt. P. T. Rawlings, received injuries resulting in their death. At this initial trip it was found impossible to rise from the ground using the four engines, so the two upper engines were brought into operation. When this was done and before the plane could leave the ground, the tail rose up and the nose of the machine crashed down- ward into the earth while at a speed of over 70 miles an hour. It is believed that if the aero- plane could have risen, all six engines might have functioned; but the results of the initial trial seemed to show that the problems connected with their placing and operation had not been adequately worked out. Lawsox Aib Liner. This airplane designed, manufactured and operated distinctly as a pas- senger carrying machine on a commercial basis made a number of interesting trips in the autumn of 1919, proceeding from Milwaukee, Wis., to New York and thence to Washington. It had a capacity of 26 passengers with a comfortable en- closed cabin, and was specially designed for high speed and economy of fuel. It was stated that the machine had reached a point where the trip from New York to San Francisco could be made in 36 hours actual time between, cities. Helicopters. During the year there was an- nounced a prize of $100,000 to be awarded to the person who should produce and demonstrate the first heavier than air aircraft which would rise from and land on the ground vertically, as for example, rise from and return to the roof of a medium size house. This prize was donated by a French patron and enthusiast of aviation, M. Michelin, who previously had given many valu- able prizes for aircraft development and per- formance, all of which had been won though when first announced the conditions were con- sidered difficult if not impossible of realization. The new prize was offered to the designer or aviator of the first aircraft: (1) to rise vertically from the ground ; ( 2 ) to possess the greatest pos- sible range of speed up to 124 miles an hour; (3) to land vertically within a radius of five meters. This of course plainly indicated some form of helicopter or screw machine where the propeller blades or vanes revolved about a vertical axis. Considerable experiment work had been done in this field but the practical achievement was ];miUd in comparison with the vast studies made in other departments of aviation, notably the airplane. However the problem always had a fascination for scientific men and in 1919 there were announced some encouraging results of ex- periments undertaken by Peter Cooper Hewitt and F. B. Crocker. In 1918 these two experi- menters met at Ampere, N. J., and inaugurated a series of tests on a helicopter which pre- sented considerable promise. The machine de- veloped a lift of 4000 pounds with two motors of 100 horse power each and propellers 51 feet in diameter. The experiments, as announced up to the end of 1919, did not actually involve flight, but the production of lifting power which was accurately measured by dynamometers and weigh- ing mechanisms. Electric motors rather than in- ternal combustion engines were employed in the experimental work so as to secure any desired speed of rotation and measure readily the con- sumption of power. The two propellers were mounted one above the other on concentric shafts and being respectively right and left screws were revolved in opposite directions. They were placed vertically seven feet apart. The propeller blades were made of an agroform model, 30 inches wide and about 15 feet long, being built up of aluminum partitions placed transversely and then sheathed. These propeller blades revolve at low angular velocity compared with those of an airplane and the speed of airplane engines would be considerably reduced. Various types of propellers were tested in these experiments and a form finally was produced that gave a lift of 2550 pounds for 126.5 horse power when making but 70 revolutions per minute or 20.2 pounds per horse power. These experiments so far as announced had not proceeded beyond the full size laboratory stage at the end of 1919, but they indicated considerable promise of success as well as progress in this interesting field. British Civil Aviation. On May 1, 1919, the resumption of civil flying was officially per- mitted in Great Britain and a report on the work of the Department of Civil Aviation of the Air Ministry was issued in the late autumn, covering the period from May 1st to October 31st. It stated that the Cairo-Karachi route had been opened for military purposes and would soon be available for civil traffic. A chain of landing places had also been established on the route from Cairo to the Cape, so that it would be possible to fly over the whole of this route, on an experi- mental basis, in the very near future. The air navigation regulations might need some slight modifications as a result of experience gained with their application, but no serious difficulties had occurred. In the period under review, 21,000 flights had been made and 52,000 passengers carried. The total number of flying hours amounted to 4000, and the total mileage covered 303,000. No pas- senger had been killed in civil flying, although 10 were injured, as also were 6 pilots; and 2 pilots were unfortunately killed. The total num- ber of accidents which occurred was 13, or 1 in 1615 flights, a figure which would probably be considerably improved on in the course of time. Only 1 passenger in each 5200 carried was in- jured, or 1 in each 30,300 miles flown, but in this connection it should be noted that accidents are most likely to occur when starting up or landing, and as the average flight was of short duration (just over 14 miles) the risk of accident was greater per mile flown than would have been the case with ordinary commercial journeys. Ex- perts from the Department were sent to in- vestigate and report on all accidents, and this it was thought doubtless would tend to reduce their number. Mail Carrying by Aeroplane. The ter- mination of the war making available a larpe number of aeroplanes and trained aviators, it was natural that schemes to utilize both men Digitized by Google AERONAUTICS 8 AERONAUTICS and machines should be developed. These plans were both governmental and commercial, the former including the rapid exchange of official communications, mail and even personal repre- sentatives at various conferences and parlia- ments, and the latter passengers on urgent busi- ness and newspapers, special communications of immediate importance and light packages. The reliability of the service seemed to be established, and the experience of military aviators and de- signers naturally was invaluable. The commer- cial side, however, involved the question of the increased cost of transportation of passengers and freight, and here it was not possible to say by the end of 1919 how much progress had been made. Whether the saving in time could be measured by an appropriate cash value was not always clear, and it was realized that develop- ments in commercial aeronautics must adjust themselves to new ideas of value. As regards mail service, however, it seemed to be unmis- takable that such work could be efficiently and legularly carried on, but it must be remembered that in 1919 much was done with machines al- ready constructed for the military service. The transition from the extraordinary and unusual of the war, where expense of construction and operation was a minor consideration, to commer- cial practice, was still a problem in 1919, though . it must be said that further progress towards its solution had been made than in any previous year since aviation had been put on a practical basis. On May 15, 1919, was celebrated the anni- versary of the inauguration of the commercial mail service between Washington and New York. On this occasion the same two aeroplanes were used as started the year previously, and they were propelled by the same motors. One of them dur- ing the year had been in the air 164 hours, flying 10,716 miles, and had carried 572,826 letters. It had cost in service per hour $65.80. Cost of repairs was $4.80. The other plane was in the air 222 hours, flying 15,018 miles, and had car- ried 485,120 letters. It cost in service per hour $48.34, and in total repairs $1,874.76. The entire service between New York and Washington showed 92.73 per cent of performance during (he entire year, representing 128,255 miles of actual travel and 7,720,840 letters weighing 193,- 021 pounds were carried, the revenues from aero- plane mail stamps amounting to $159,700, the coBt of the service $137,900.06. On Aug. 10, 1918, the flying operations which had been con- ducted by the army were taken over by the Post Office Department with a single organization, which maintained from the beginning the record made under the military service. Out of 1261 possible trips, 1206 were undertaken, and but 55 were defaulted on account of weather conditions. During rain, fog, snow, gales and electrical storms 435 trips were made. Out of a possible 138,092 miles 128,037 miles were flown. Only 51 forced landings were made on account of weather and 37 on account of motor troubles. It was brought out in the course of the year's work that for postal and daily cross country service aeroplanes designed wholly for war purposes were not' suitable, and the De Haviland-4 ma- chines transferred to the Post Office Department after the signing of the armistice were recon- structed to fit them for commercial requirements. The Department also called for bids for specially constructed mail carrying planes. * It was found that the element of danger in- volved in the military and exhibition flying was almost entirely absent from commercial flying. No aeroplane carrying the mail had fallen out of the sky during the year, and there had not been a single death of an aviator carrying the mail. The only deaths by accident were those of an aviator who made a flight to demonstrate his qualifications as an aviator and that of a me- chanic who fell against the whirling propeller of a machine on the ground. But two postal aviators were injured seriously enough to be sent to the hospital. The experience of a year in the mail service with all types and tempera- ments of aviators established the fact that 200 feet visibility from the ground was the limit of practical flying, although a number of runs were made with the mail between New York and Washington, during which a part of the trip was flown at as low an altitude as 50 feet. The per- formance of the various planes used in this Bervice was of interest, demonstrating that under proper conditions adequate life could be secured for a plane. On July 1, 1919, the New York and Cleveland mail route was established, a distance of 410 miles by air and requiring for the flight from 4y 2 to 5 hours as against 620.64 miles by train and a train time of 13.05 to 17.20 hours. The Cleveland-Chicago route was established May 15, 1919, a distance of 325 miles by air, requiring a flight of 3»/ 2 to 4 hours as against 340.28 miles by rail and 6.35 to 10.30 hours train time. The routing followed in 1919 was for the mail plane to leave New York daily including Sunday be- tween 5 and 6 a.m. with between 12,000 and 14,- 000 letters, and arrive at Cleveland about 10 a.m. and at Chicago about 1 p.m. the same day. By this service any letters mailed too late to leave New York on the 5.30 p.m. train, are ad- vanced so as to make all noon carrier deliveries in Cleveland and all afternoon carrier deliveries in Chicago as well as advancing connections to the middle West 16 hours and to Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles 24 hours. The mail plane at Cleveland, in addition to mail originating in Cleveland, takes about 14,- 000 letters daily from train No. 19, which leaves New York at 5.30 o'clock the afternoon before and is not due to arrive in Chicago until 4 p.m., too late for the regular carrier deliveries in that city, and puts this mail in Chicago daily at 1 o'clock, usually a little before 1 p.m. It also makes train connections which would not have been made had the mail remained on the train. . The eastbound mail plane leaves Chicago daily at 2.30 p.m., which is a considerable time after the departure of the Twentieth Century Limited, and overtakes it at Cleveland with an hour to spare and deposits on that train Chicago city mail and mails from westbound connections. This mail then is delivered bv the Twentieth Cen- tury Limited in New York 6ity at 9.45 a.m. In this way the New York mail is practically ad- vanced 24 hours. The eastbound mail plane at Cleveland takes besides letters originating in Cleveland and des- tined for the east between 12,000 and 14,000 let- ters from train No. 90-28-32, which left Chicago at 11.31 p.m. the previous night, and delivers it at New York City, usually around 1.30 o'clock that afternoon. Had this mail remained on that train it would not have arrived in New York City until 4.44 o'clock the following morning. Digitized by Google AERONAUTICS AERONAUTICS Corresponding advantages are secured by the air mail between New York and Washington. In 1919 the southbound mail plane left New York at 8.40 a.m. with New England midnight mail and New York City mail reaching the post office too late for the 1 a.m. dispatch for Wash- ington, also New York up-State mail arriving on New York Central train No. 32, to the amount of 14,000 letters daily, which are turned over to the Washington postmaster in time for the noon and first afternoon deliveries. The northbound mail plane was scheduled to leave Washington at 10.40 a.m. with some 14,000 letters daily to New York City, including Wash- ington City letters mailed before 9.30 a.m., and New York City mail worked to carriers arriving in Washington on the Seaboard Air Line and Atlantic Coast Line trains from all the south- eastern States from Virginia to Florida. This mail reached New York by plane daily about 1.30 p.m. Had it continued by train to New York it would not have arrived in New York City in time to catch any carrier deliveries. In connection with the New York and Wash- ington aerial mail route a notable flight was made on December 2nd when a specially built De Haviland-4 airplane belonging to the Post Office Department made the trip between the air mail field at Washington and Belmont Park, New York, 218 miles, in 1 hour and 34 minutes with a load of 630 pounds representing nearly 20,000 letters. The rate of speed was 138 miles an hour, the best record ever made in the American mail service. On July 18, 1919, Postmaster Burleson reduced the postage rate on aeroplane mail matter to two cents an ounce, or the regular\" rate for first class mail, thus placing the aeroplane mail service on the same footing with all other means of mail transportation. On August 14th an innovation in atrial mail Bervice was accomplished when an aeromarine flying boat deposited mail aboard the White Star liner Adriatic two hours after it had left the dock at Hoboken, N. J. The scheme was an- nounced to have further possibilities in the de- livery of ships' manifests after the ships had left port, as cargo could be taken on to the last moment before sailing and the completed mani- fests delivered long after they had sailed. A special contrivance consisting of a waterproof bag for the mail and a flexible cable attached to the flying boat and carrying the mail bag was employed, and the sack was deposited by driving the aeroplane directly across the ship's course, so that the flexible cable would encounter a steel wire stretched between the fore and mainmast. The experiment was in every way satisfactory, and the use of the method was seriously con- sidered. During the strike of the railway employees in Great Britain, an aeroplane mail service was established fjom London to Bristol, Birmingham, Newcastle, Manchester and Glasgow, in addi- tion to a continental service between London and Paris and London and Brussels. This serv- ice was very successful, and on the fourth day of the strike 54 aeroplanes were carrying mail. A charge of two shillings an ounce on each letter was made for this special service. On one day a Handley-Page aeroplane transported to Brussels for Holland and Norway 1400 pounds of mail matter and brought back 2000 pounds. This aeroplane mail service was so successful that the British newspapers urged that it be retained. It was discontinued, as the train service improved during the latter part of the strike. The first regular French aerial postal service was inaugurated on Nov. 10, 1919, when mail was transported to England from Bourget, near Pari 8, and from Hounslow in England to Bour- get. There had been for some time previously a regular commercial service, the trips being made in two hours and fifteen minutes. It was also contemplated to establish a regular mail service to Morocco. Commercial Aeronautics. During the year 1919 the commercial extension of aerial trans- portation took forward strides. In England the Super-Marine Aviation Works, Limited, estab- lished the first flying boat passenger service on the south coast with a fleet of 10 passenger carry- ing ships, five of which fly on alternate days, enabling the other five to be thoroughly over- hauled, examined and tuned up during the day on which they are out of service. A government inspector critically examines each individual ma- chine and passes upon its fitness for flight before it proceeds. The service as inaugurated during the summer of 1919 starts at Woolston, near Southampton, and includes the following ports: To Cowes, 10y 2 miles; Ryde, 15; Sea View, 17; Bembride, 19; Sandowu, 23; Shanklin, 25; Vent- nor, 28; Freshwater, 43; Yarmouth, 18; Bourne- mouth, 33; Poole, 40; Swanage, 38; Weymouth, GO; from Poole to Freshwater, 23; from Wey- mouth to Freshwater, 42; from Freshwater to Ventnor, 15 miles. This service, it was hoped, could be extended to France with ports of call at Le Havre, Cherbourg and St. Malo. During the summer this service was waiting on the necessary permission, which was to be granted under the rules of the Allied Air Convention. On March 1st a daily aerial service between Folkestone, England, and Cologne, Germany, was instituted with four aeroplanes, which carried between them 25 bags of mail, but this amount was increased, so that for the three months ending May 31st, 2276 outward and 886 inward bags were transported. This service made pos- sible the delivery of correspondence leaving Cologne one morning to all parts of England and Wales by the first delivery on the following morning. The American Express Company during the year completed arrangements for a daily air pas- senger and baggage service between London and Paris, so that a person could leave London and fly to Paris and transact business there and return to London in time for dinner. This service was announced to begin in October, and was to provide an aeroplane carrying one or two passengers and costing about $100 for a flight one way, and a larger machine carrying 15 passengers, for which the fare was to be about $60 per person. The latter, known as the air bus, was to leave three times a week, while single passenger carrying aeroplanes would fly daily from the aerodrome. This service was to be in connection with a special automobile service to carry passengers from their hotels to the aerodromes on the outskirts of London and Paris. The general scheme provided for a special form of ticket whereby the passengers assumed the risk of the journey, and the lug- gage was limited to a single piece of baggage about the size of a suitcase. Those traveling in the fast aeroplanes would have to wear a Digitized by Google AERONAUTICS 10 AERONAUTICS head mask and goggles, but those in the air bus would not require any special equipment. The time for the flight was to be between three and four hours, in place of the boat and train run- ning time of about nine hours between London and Paris. The ticket for each trip cost about $20. It was reported that the American Ex- press Company, through its tourist department, was contemplating the establishment of air lines from Liverpool and Southampton to London. In Germany an aero passenger service was inaugurated between Berlin and Hamburg in March, during which month 108 flights were successfully carried out and loads of no less than 3737 kilograms were carried. The per- centage of failures to complete the trip was stated as only 6.1. This and other services were operated by the Deutsche Luft Rederie, a combination of Various firms of German aero- plane manufacturers, which was thoroughly or- ganized both as regards plan and operation, ihe various lines in operation extended from Berlin to such points as Weimar, Frankfort, Leipzig, Warnemunde, Hanover, Westphalia and Breslau, in addition to the service to Hamburg already referred to. There were also services from Weimar to Hamburg, Hamburg to Warne- munde, Weimar to Leipzig and Hanover to West- phalia. The Berlin-W T eimar route was placed in operation about the beginning of February, and in its first month 120 flights were attempted, of which only 18 \"were unsuccessful, and no acci- dents whatsoever were recorded. The Berlin to Hamburg trip cost 450 marks, with a return ticket 700 marks, while serial tickets available over any of the routes operated by the syndicate could be had for 3600 marks and were trans- ferable. A practical application of the aeroplane was made on July 12th by Jasper C. Mayer, of Washington, D. C, who, missing the steamship Kashimura Maru at Seattle, embarked on an aeroplane and overtook the vessel on its way down the Sound. The belated traveler was able to catch the vessel, and at an expense of $75 was saved a delay of several weeks until the next sailing. During the middle of the summer a passenger airship was announced to sail from Barrow-in- Furness to Rio Janeiro, which would take 20 passengers and a small cargo. The announced route was by way of Lisbon, Sierra Leone and thence to Rio Janeiro, and the time of flight was estimated at about four days each way. This trip was in the nature of a trial, and if successful a regular service was to be maintained by the Vickers Company, which managed the undertaking. The price of the tickets was £1000 apiece. This special airship, or the R-80, was built at the Vickers- Barrows Works Company by the British Admiralty, with the object of se- curing a rigid British airship of medium dimen- sions which would compare with the latest Ger- man Zeppelin. The R-80 had a capacity of 1,- 250,000 cubic feet, or somewhat more than half the size of the R-34. She had a cruising speed of 46 miles and a full power speed of 60 miles an hour, and was 535 feet in length. The pas- senger accommodations on top of the hull include a large saloon arranged like a Pullman car, a roof garden, a shelter deck and cabins of sleep- ing berths. Another British regular air service between London and Paris was organized during the year by Aircraft Transport and Travel, with General Fosting managing director. Parcels ex- press machines were to leave London at 4 a. m., arriving in Paris two or three hours later, and carried a cargo of 900 pounds, consisting of newspapers or rapid express matter. The plan was to provide space for a passenger or two, but the passenger machines proper would leave later in the day and would have enclosed saloons. This company proposed an alternative ground and sea route when fog or storm made flying im- possible, and had as its pilots a number of men chosen for the most part from those of the com- munication squadron between London and the Peace Conference. Large British Airships. During the year the British Admiralty decided to build a fleet of eight airships larger than anything previously attempted in cars of this class. Three of these huge dirigibles were under construction, one at Beardmore's, one at Bedford, and a third, which is the largest, at the Armstrong Whitworth Works at Barlow in the West Riding of York- shire. By the summer of 1919 this dirigible was well advanced and the girder work almost finished. She was 694 feet long, 85 feet in diameter, and had a gas capacity of over 3,- 000,000 cubic feet. There were seven cars or gondolas, three on each side and one in the centre forward devoted to the controls and the navigation officers. The propelling power was to be six Sunbeam Cossack engines, each capable of developing 400 horse power and a speed of about 70 miles per hour. A fuel capacity of 30 tons could be provided, and it was the inten- tion of the Admiralty to place these airships on regular mail service. The R-39 was to be com- pleted in 1919, and the remaining were to be finished and launched in 1920. United States Purchases R-38. During the year the United States Navy Department ar- ranged to secure from Great Britain the R-38, the world's greatest airship which resembled the R-34 in many respects but was larger and had greater horse power, speed, and radius of action. The R-38 was designed for a gas capacity of 2,- 724,000 cubic feet, was 694 feet long, 86 feet in diameter, 93 feet six inches high and a useful load capacity of 45 tons. The airship was ex- pected to develop a maximum speed of 60 knots. Congress had appropriated $2,500,000 for the purchase of the airship and for the training of the pilot, and the British Air Ministry offered to train the personnel so that the dirigible could be taken over by an American crew and flown directly to the United States. A hangar at Lakewood, N. J., was under construction by the Navy Department for the R-38. Altitude Records. During the year 1919 a number of important records in aviation were made. On August 2nd Major R. W. Schroeder, a United States army aviator, flew at Dayton, Ohio, at a rate of 137 miles an hour at a height of 18,400 feet. A two- seated Lepere biplane de- signed by Captain Lepere, of the French army, was used, which was driven by a 12-cylinder Lib- erty motor, using a supercharger. This last de- vice consists of a gas turbine and centrifugal compressor, which derives its power from the red-hot exhaust gases of the Liberty motor. The compressed air is fed into the carburetor at the same pressure as at sea level, so that there is plenty of oxygen regardless of altitude. The device was designed by Dr. Sanford A. Moss. Digitized by Google AERONAUTICS 11 AERONAUTICS Major Schroeder's flight was in company with Lieutenant G. W. Elfey, an expert aeronautic observer. The altitude record set by Major R. W. Schroe- der at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio, on Septem- ber 18, 1918, with an altitude of 28,000 feet made in an American, built British Bristol tighter equipped with an American built His- pano-Suiza motor, was broken on July 30th, 1919, by Roland Rohlfs. This record was made in a Curtiss 400 horse power triplane at Roose- velt Field, Long Island, on July 30th, when, in the face of a 100-mile an hour gale, an official al- titude of 30,700 feet waa> accomplished. This was said to be the first time an officially observed flight in excess of 30,000 feel had been made, and stands as an American record, but it does not surpass the altitude record of 33,136 feet made on June 14th, 1919, by Adjutant Casale at Villa Coublay, France. Rohlfs machine was a Cur- tiss triplane of the type known as the Wasp, which was designed as a two-plane fighting ma- chine for the American forces, and was com- pleted just before the signing of the armistice. Naturally the aviator employed an oxygen mask and encountered a temperature of 25 degrees be- low zero, which chilled his motor and made navi- gation at the higher levels exceedingly difficult. This altitude record was supplanted by Roland Rohlfs on Sept. 18, 1919, at Roosevelt Field, Long Island, when a height of 34,160 feet was attained. This flight was made in a Curtiss Wasp triplane equipped with a Curtiss K-12 400 horse power motor, and was officially observed, confirmed and homologued by the officers of the Aero Club of America and .the Internationale Federation Aeronautique. Both aeroplane and motor were designed and built in America, and the entire flight, reaching more than 6% miles above the level of the sea, was made in one hour and 53 minutes, with 20 minutes of the time at the highest altitude ever reached, in a tempera- ture of 43° below zero. Rohlfs found perfect conditions, and began taking oxygen at 20,000 feet. He required 75 minutes to reach his great- est altitude and 18 minutes to descend. This flight exceeds Rohlfs official record of 30,700 feet made on July 30th, and the official record made by Adjutant Casale, of the French army, on June 14, 1919, in a Renault plane with 150 horse power at Villa Coublay, of 33,136 feet. This last flight is 5610 feet higher than Mount Everest, in the Himalaya Mountains, — the high- est mountain in the world. Rohlfs is the chief test pilot of the Curtiss Company, and during the year conducted a series of flights with the aim of making altitude records. Subsequent to the record referred to above, in an attempt to secure a rapid rate of flying, Rohlfs rose to a height of 19,500 feet in nine minutes, 42% seconds, or at a rate of over 2000 feet a minute. Proposed Department of Aeronautics. The subject of the attitude of the national govern- ment towards aeronautics, both military and naval and commercial and scientific, gave rise to considerable discussion during the year 1919. Senator New introduced in the Senate on July 3l8t a bill to create a Department of Aeronautics. This bill defined the powers and duties of the director, and provided for the organization, disposition and administration of a United States air force, creating the United States Air Reserve Force, and providing for the develop- ment of civil and commercial aviation. To this Department of Aeronautics would be transferred the various officers and enlisted men of the army, navy, post office and other services now engaged in aeronautics, and it would be re' sponsible for the development and control of aeronautics generally throughout the United States. The bill provides in considerable detail for the organization of the department and its various officers and other personnel. Army Reliability Race. On the morning of October 8th, there was started a 2700 mile race across the American continent between Mineola, Long Island, New York, and San Francisco, simultaneous starts being made at each place. Any army pilot who secured the written recom- mendation of the commanding officer of the field to which he was attached was eligible to com- pete and the aeroplanes employed must have a speed of 100 miles an hour or greater and motors must be of standard specifications. Compulsory stops of not less than 30 minutes nor more than 48 hours were required en route in either direc- tion at the following control stations: Bing- hamton, Rochester, and Buffalo, N. Y.; Cleve- land and Bryan, Ohio; Chicago and Rock Island, 111.; Des Moines, Iowa; Omaha and North Platte, Neb.; Sidney, Cheyenne, Olcott, Rawlins and Green River, Wyo.; Salt Lake City, Utah; Salduro, Battle Mountain and Reno, Nev.; and Sacramento and San Francisco, Cal. In order to equalize conditions the race was made for the round trip and the accompanying summary indicates the relative performances. The trans- continental race attracted considerable attention and while there were accidents several of which were attended by fatalities, nevertheless the com- petition was interesting as showing the progress of American military aviators during and after the war. The War Department announced the winners in the army reliability test race in the following divisions : WINNERS ON ELAPSED TIME— EAST TO WEST 1 2 8 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 PUot Passtnfftr 1st Lt. B. W.

This competition for free balloons was started on October 2nd at St. Louis with entries from 10 American cities. This race which was organized by Major A. B. Lambert, a veteran balloonist, was started by Captain Charles J. Glidden, the president of the American Touring Association. Transcontinental Aerial Derby. During the year the plans for a Transcontinental Aerial Derby from New York to San Francisco, with over $100,000 in prizes *and a first prize of $20,- 000, were announced by Captain Charles J. Glid- den, who offered to contribute a trophy appro- priate to the competition. This competition was to be held under the auspices of the Atrial League of America and sanctioned by the Aero Club of America under the rules of the Inter- national Aeronautic Federation. It was to be international in character, and designed to af- ford a supreme test of the aeroplanes and mo- tors entered. It was proposed to have the com- petition take place in a series of legs of 250 miles each, with a compulsory stop at the end of each leg, and detailed rules for the Glidden Aeroplane Efficiency Trophy were being drawn by a committee of which Major R. G. Land is was chairman. Aces of the American Army. In October, 1919, there was publiehed the official list of American aviators who had destroyed enemy air- planes and balloons under conditions enabling official recognition and sanction of the accom- plishment to be made, so that the list is most conservative and does not include many ma- chines brought down but not officially certified. On this roll were 66 names, including those who served with the British and French. In all 428 German planes and 55 observation balloons were brought down by American avia- tors. The official list follows: Acs and Squadron Capt. Rickenbaeker, E. V., 94th Second Lt. Luke, Frank, 27th. . Major Lufberry, RaouL 94th. . ♦First Lt. Vaughn, G. t 17th. . . First Lt.

Captain Sir John Alcock, the first aviator to make a non- stop aeroplane flight across the Atlantic, later in the year on December 18th, 1919, met with an accident when his plane crashed near Cotevard, Department of Seine Inferieure, Normandy, while flying low in a heavy fog and unable to sight the earth. Captain Alcock received such injuries that he died on the following day. AEBOPLANE. See Aeronautics. AFGHANISTAN. A monarchy of Central Asia between parallels 29°, and 38° 28' north latitude and 61° and 72° east longitude, with a narrow strip running to 75° east longitude; bounded on the west bv Persia, on the east by tribal districts under the government of India; on the north by Russian territory and Bokhara, and on the south by British Baluchistan. Area estimated at about 245,000 square miles; popu- lation estimated at about 6,380,000. Capital, Kabul; population about 150,000; other large cities: Kandahar (31,500), and Herat (20,- 000). The Afghans are the dominant race, their leading tribes being the Durrani and Ghitzai, whose number is variously estimated at from 2,200,000 to 3,200,000. Tribes of less numerical importance are Tajik, Hazara, Aimak, and Uz- bak. Persian and Pushtoo are the leading tongues and the religion of people and ruler is Sunnite Mohammedanism, Justice is dis- pensed on the principles of the Koran. There are many fertile plains and valleys although the country is for the most part mountainous. The chief occupations are agriculture and grazing, and the chief products are rice, wheat, barley, millet, and other grains together with a rich variety of fruits, the latter supplying the chief food of a large class of people and being ex- ported to a considerable extent. The land is cultivated by four classes: Proprietors who till their own fields; tenants in the ordinary sense renting either for money or for a portion of the produce; a class of tenants corresponding to the French metayers who are known as Baz- gars; and finally hired laborers. Sheep-raising is important owing to the abundance of a singu- lar variety of fat tailed sheep, native to the country, which supplies the chief meat diet, and abundant grease. Iron and gold are worked to some extent, and copper is reported abundant in the northern part of the country. Among other industries are the production of silks, felts, carpets, and articles of goats 1 and camels' hair; and at Kabul there are other manufac- tures for local consumption and for the army. The chief exports are timber, fruit, vegetables, grains, asafcetida, and other drugs, animal prod- ucts, spices, and tobacco; and the trade, which is chiefly with India, has increased of late years. The leading imports are cotton goods, indigo and other dye-stuffs, sugar, tea, hard- ware, leather, and silver treasure. The above applies to commerce with India alone. No la- ter figures were available than those given in the preceding Year Book relating to the trade with India. According to these in 1916-17 the exports into India were £1,144,000, and the imports from India were £1,150,000. The im- ports and exports from and to Bokhara were reported respectively at about 4,000,000 rubles. The expansion of trade in late years has been attributed to the removal of some of the heavier duties which formerly restricted it. The execu- tive powers are in the hands of the Ameer, an hereditary prince who receives an annual subsidy from the Government of India of 1,- 800,000 rupees, under the treaty of 1893. His total revenue is estimated at between 12,000,000 and 13,000,000 rupees. The strength of the Af- ghan army was placed at about 98,000 men, in- cluding 18,000 cavalry and 396 guns. The con- trol of foreign policy rests entirely in the British government of India. Down to the early part of 1919 the ruler was Habibullah Khan, who came to the throne on Oct. 3, 1901, but on Feb. 20, 1919, he was assassinated (see below under His- tory), and was succeeded by his third son, Amanullah Khan. History The New Ruler. On February 20th, the Ameer, Habibullah Khan, was assassinated while sleeping in camp about 40 miles from Kabul. This was followed by the news that the throne had been assumed by his brother, Nasrullah Khan, despite the fact that the heir to the throne was the Ameer's son. Nasrullah had for a long time past shown ambitious designs and a hostile attitude toward Europeans. After the outbreak of the war he headed a party that tried to force the Ameer to the aid of Tur- key. The Ameer remained loyal, however, and down to 1919 the situation of the country was satisfactory from the British point of view, in spite of hostile intrigues. During the pre- Digitized by Google AFGHANISTAN 14 AGBICULTUBAL CREDIT ceding year the country had been in general free from sedition, and it had subscribed a con- siderable sum to the war loan. Nasrullah pro- claimed himself Ameer at Jellalabad, and there was danger that the country would be torn into rival factions. The policy at that time out- lined by the British government was that of non-interference although the hostility of the new pretender toward Great Britain was well known. Meanwhile Amanullah Khan, the third son of the late Ameer, having secured the sup- port of a large part of the army, announced his accession. On the other hand Nas/dllah was said to have great influence among the armed tribesmen throughout the country and among the Mullahs. It was soon learned, however, that Nasrullah had submitted to the new Ameer. The latter gave assurance that the friendly pol- icy of his predecessor would be continued. The new Ameer, Amanullah Khan, was born June 1, 1802, and during recent years had been left by his father in charge of Kabul, when the court removed to Jellalabad. Afghan Hostilities. Amanullah was sup- ported by the army and controlled the treas- ury and the arsenal. On succeeding to the throne he declared the complete independence of his country, claiming also that he was called upon to free India from the horrors of revolu- tion and from the tyranny of British rule. A body of Afghan troops crossed the border, May 2, and received some half-hearted support, but the tribesmen for the most part held aloof. The use of aeroplanes and the bombing of their forces at Jellalabad, Dakka, Kabul, and at other important points, soon produced their effect and on May 15th their commander-in-chief asked for a cessation of hostilities. This was refused, as the request had not come from the Ameer. Fighting now took place in the south in the regions of Khost, Kurram, and Zhob, and the British garrison in Thai was threatened. The enemy was soon routed in Thai, however, and one of his strongest posts was captured. On May 28th, the Ameer sent a letter to the Viceroy en- closing a copy of his order to his generals to cease fighting but putting the blame for the hos- tilities on the British. After some hesitation over the British terms and an evasive reply on July 18th, he wrote on June 29th expressing the hope that the Viceroy would fix the date for the reception of his envoys. He still re- ferred to the one-sided nature of the armistice conditions. Discussions began, July 26, and the British conditions were accepted, August 8. See India, British (History). AFRICA.

The immedi- ate demand for food products in large quantities in the past few years necessitated the extension of financial credit to the farmers of all coun- tries. The Continent had had a cr?dit system with this purpose in view in operation for a numher of years, while in the United State* the Federal Land Bank Act approved by Congress in July, 1916, and put into operation in Fcbru- an T , 1017, was hardly organized long enough to consider it fully prepared for this unusual emergency. Capital was needed in large quanti- ties at reasonable rates of interest to enable the farmers to work their land at maximum capacity, and it was to meet such a possible situation that Congress had approved the Fed- eral Land Bank Act. A description and re- sume of the act may be found in the 1918 Year Book. The act has succeeded both in improv- ing the method of making loans and in re- ducing to approximate equality throughout the United States, the cost of borrowing on farm mortgage security. The aim of the act cannot be fully realized until the methods of scientific farming become known to the average small far- mer who will then be able to utilize these loans to greater advantage than he now does. The present tendency among a number of small far- mers is to take loans, thus increasing their to- tal indebtedness, without carefully investing the money so as to increase their productive and earning capacity in a like or greater ratio. Federal Reserve Act. Short term agricul- tural credit has been provided for according to the provisions of the Federal Reserve Act which has made it possible for member banks to dis- count notes, drafts, and bills of exchange issued or drawn for agricultural purposes or based on live-stock, and having a maturity not exceeding six months. In this way the short term paper of the farmers has found a desirable channel to the commercial banks where it can be readily discounted along with other desirable commer- cial paper. In giving this short time credit the farmer is called upon to give a financial state- ment of his business, and in this way indis- c"
