They are used to kill and maim individuals and to destroy states and societies, and occasionally whole civilizations, and with these the greatest of man’s cultural and artistic accomplishments. Throughout history tools of war have been the instruments of conquest, invasion, and enslavement, but they have also been used to check evil and to maintain peace. Weapons have evolved over time to become both more lethal and more complex. For the greater part of human existence, combat was fought at the length of an arm or at such short range as to represent no real difference; battle was fought within line of sight and seldom lasted more than the hours of daylight of a single day. Thus individual weapons that began with the rock and the club proceeded through the sling and boomerang, bow and arrow, sword and axe, to gunpowder weapons of the rifle and machine gun of the late nineteenth century. Study of the evolution of these weapons tells us much about human ingenuity, the technology of the time, and the societies that produced them. The greater part of technological development of weaponry has taken part in the last two centuries, especially the twentieth century. In this process, plowshares have been beaten into swords; the tank, for example, evolved from the agricultural caterpillar tractor. Occasionally, the process is reversed and military technology has impacted society in a positive way. Thus modern civilian medicine has greatly benefited from advances to save soldiers’ lives, and weapons technology has impacted such areas as civilian transportation or atomic power. Weapons can have a profound impact on society. Gunpowder weapons, for example, were an important factor in ending the era of the armed knight and the Feudal Age. They installed a kind of rough vii\n\nviii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ndemocracy on the battlefield, making “all men alike tall.” We can only wonder what effect weapons of mass destruction (WMD) might have on our own time and civilization. This series will trace the evolution of a variety of key weapons systems, describe the major changes that occurred in each, and illustrate and identify the key types. Each volume begins with a description of the particular weapons system and traces its evolution, while discussing its historical, social, and political contexts. This is followed by a heavily illustrated section that is arranged more or less along chronological lines that provides more precise information on at least eighty key variants of that particular weapons system. Each volume contains a glossary of terms, a bibliography of leading books on that particular subject, and an index. Individual volumes in the series, each written by a specialist in that particular area of expertise, are as follows: Aircraft Carriers Ancient Weapons Artillery Ballistic Missiles Battleships Cruisers and Battle Cruisers Destroyers Helicopters Machine Guns Medieval Weapons Military Aircraft, Origins to 1918 Military Aircraft, 1919–1945 Military Aircraft in the Jet Age Pistols Rifles Submarines Tanks We hope that this series will be of wide interest to specialists, researchers, and even general readers. Spencer C. Tucker Series Editor\n\nPREFACE\n\nFrom the advent of the earliest of the type, submarine design has always pressed against the outer limits of the contemporary technological envelope. Inventors and engineers have, of necessity, incorporated new and untested machinery and equipment into their craft in order to meet their goals of creating effective undersea vessels. The underwater environment, moreover, is unforgiving; errors in operation or failures of equipment have very dangerous and even fatal consequences. Success in submarine design, therefore, has come to those naval architects who have combined innovation and experimentation with substantial direct, prior experience or knowledge. The obvious potential military advantages of the stealthy and lethal capabilities of successful submarines soon attracted the attention of admiralties around the world. Early designers of practical craft found a relatively ready market for their wares, either through export or license construction by their customers. Designs by the German Wilhelm Bauer were constructed in Germany and Russia, while George Garrett’s boats, built by the Swedish industrialist Thorsten Nordenfeldt in Sweden and Britain, were marketed to Greece, Turkey, and Russia. Beginning in the years around 1900, boats by Maxime Laubeuf in France, the Italian Cesare Laurenti, and above all, John P. Holland in the United States, found ready markets in navies around the world in the years before World War I. The maturation of submarines as a result of operations during World War I expanded the global demand for the type. Design teams with successful records dominated this worldwide arms market. Firms from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the United States prevailed in this trade in submarines. In the German case, since indigenous submarine design and construction had been prohibited by the Versailles Treaty, the design teams established themselves across ix\n\nx\n\nPREFACE\n\nthe border in the Netherlands and contracted out construction to yards in other European countries. A similar situation pertained after World War II, although Italian designs, no longer on the cutting edge, faded from the export market, while the emphasis on nuclear propulsion in the United States led that nation to withdraw from overseas sales to avoid the distribution of sensitive technologies. Its place was taken by substantial export of both vessels and designs by the Soviet Union, the resurgence of the German submarine industry, and the maturing of Swedish design and construction. To more accurately reflect the sources of the global distribution of submarines, I have chosen to organize the reference sections by the national origins of the various designs rather than by the navies that operated them (national operators are indicated thus: [Norway]). This focus on the design origins overrides consideration of construction location; for example, submarine construction began in both the Netherlands and Sweden before World War I but neither nation produced many truly indigenous designs until well after the war’s end. This approach allows readers more readily to comprehend both the extent of design distribution to the various operators and the evolution of submarine designs within specific national contexts.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nEarly Submarines\n\nEarly submarines, in general, were the products of individual innovators who pursued their obsessions with creating practical underwater craft independent of governments or navies. Their designs usually came to fruition despite the lack of any perceived need for their development—indeed, quite often it was in the face of opposition that these craft saw the light of day. This phenomenon contrasts dramatically with the developmental story of the aircraft carrier, that other most revolutionary warship of the twentieth century, whose features and evolution invariably reflected official concepts and requirements. Furthermore, the influence of individual designers’ innovative ideas on submarine development was to persist strongly throughout much of the type’s history. While suggestions for various “diving boats” had been put forward on occasion from the time of Alexander the Great, the first designer to produce a vessel that successfully traveled underwater seems to have been Cornelius Drebbel, a Dutchman serving as court inventor to King James I. His boat, propelled by twelve oarsmen, made a submerged voyage along the River Thames at London in 1623. Unfortunately, while eyewitnesses described the event, they gave no indication of how Drebbel’s boat functioned. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, designers in Russia were prolific in projecting submarine boats, although quite a few of the proposals from that period were conceptual rather than actual. Czar Peter I supported Yefim Nikonov’s proposal for a submarine armed with rocket missiles, leading to the completion of a prototype in June 1720. Its trials were sufficiently successful to support orders for further boats, but problems with their 1\n\n2\n\nSUBMARINES\n\nleaking, and the death of Peter in January 1725, led to the project’s abandonment. The next Russian project came to fruition over a century later, when Engineer-General Karl Andreyevich Shilder’s iron submersible was completed by Ivan Fedorovich Aleksandrovskiy’s yard at St. Petersburg in May 1834. After trials, a larger version was constructed that Shilder used to destroy a target vessel with a towed mine in July 1838. Trials continued until the fall of 1841, when Shilder was ordered to terminate the project. Wilhelm Bauer, a former noncommissioned officer in the Bavarian Army, was one of the archetypical submarine designers of the latter half of the nineteenth century. Between 1850 and his death in 1875, Bauer generated several submarine designs that he attempted to sell to governments in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Russia, Austria, and the United States. His prototype was constructed at August Howaldt’s Kiel shipyard. The Brandtaucher was deployed briefly during the First Schleswig War and caused the Danish Fleet blockading Kiel to move farther off shore; however, when Bauer demonstrated it to the public on 1 February 1851, it sank in the harbor, without loss of life. The wreck was recovered in 1887 and is now exhibited in the Deutsches Armeemuseum at Potsdam. Bauer produced an enlarged and improved design that he promoted, unsuccessfully, to the Bavarian, Austrian, and British governments. Eventually, however, largely because of the outbreak of the Crimean War, he attracted the support of the Russian Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich, leading to the construction of his design by the Leuchtemburg Works at St. Petersburg and its acceptance by the Russian Admiralty as the Diable Marin on 2 November 1855. His submarine, driven by a single propeller powered by a crew working treadmills geared to the shaft, was remarkably successful. It made 134 dives between May and October of 1856, including one fourhour mission on 6 September for the coronation festivities of the new czar, Aleksandr II, during which a four-piece brass ensemble played while underwater, being clearly audible on the surface. Nevertheless, although Bauer continued to receive support from the grand duke for designing an even larger boat, the Admiralty was less enthusiastic, leading him to leave Russia in frustration during the spring of 1858. He returned to Germany and continued promoting his designs, without success, until his death on 20 June 1875. The Crimean War also stimulated the development of indigenous submarine projects in Russia. Several naval officers put forward suggestions for submarines to be deployed in defense of Sevastopol,\n\nEARLY SUBMARINES\n\nthough there is no evidence that any were built. Major General Konstantin Borisov Gern also proposed a series of submarine designs for boats to defend Russian Baltic ports and managed to interest the war ministry in constructing at least three different craft between 1855 and 1871. His final design was steam powered and carried a selfpropelled torpedo, but, after initially successful trials, the ministry lost interest. Aleksandrovskiy, whose shipyard had built Shilder’s boat in 1834, also designed a large 355-ton submarine that was completed by the Baltic Works at St. Petersburg in May 1866. Powered by two 70-horsepower compressed-air engines, it also used compressed air to evacuate the ballast tank and incorporated an airlock through which divers could exit to place its mine armament against its targets. It ran extensive trials until 1871, when a 100-foot dive exceeded its crush limits and the hull collapsed. Aleksandrovskiy proposed at least two further designs, although no construction ensued. Grand Duke Konstantin also gave his support to the Polish-born engineer Stefan K. Drzewiecki’s submarine projects. Again, conflict provided the immediate impetus, in this instance the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877. Drzewiecki built and tested two successive designs for small, man-powered submersibles that led to the construction of a series of 50 production units for the war ministry by the Nevskiy Shipbuilding and Machinery Works at St. Petersburg between 1879 and 1881. The army deployed these craft in the defense of Kronshtadt and Sevastopol until they were transferred to the navy in 1885, whereupon they were discarded as ineffective. Drzewiecki himself moved to France in 1887, where he proposed several semisubmersible designs for the French Fleet, none of which were built, and also developed his very successful drop-collar torpedo launch system that saw extensive use on both French and Russian submarines into the 1920s. Russian interest in submarines revived in the 1890s, leading to the establishment of a special submarine committee on 19 December 1900, headed by Ivan Grigorevich Bubnov. It evaluated both foreign and native designs and by June 1901 had produced an indigenous design that was constructed as the Delfin. Bubnov went on to design a series of submarines for the Imperial Russian Navy, culminating with the Bars class, laid down immediately before World War I. U.S. inventors also were prolific producers of submarine proposals. David Bushnell’s Turtle made the first (abortive) attack on a surface ship, when Sergeant Ezra Lee of the Continental Army used it in an attempt to attach an explosive charge to the British 64-gun\n\n3\n\n4\n\nSUBMARINES\n\nship Eagle in New York harbor on 7 September 1776. Robert Fulton, famous later for his success with steam-propelled vessels, built a submarine, the Nautilus, at Paris in 1800 that he successfully demonstrated to the French government. He hoped to sell the boat—copper skinned over iron frames and driven by a handcranked propeller while submerged—but was rebuffed and sold the craft for scrap. Two other U.S. submarines apparently were on occasion operated during the War of 1812. Among other submarines proposed or built subsequently were two by the Indiana shoemaker Lodner D. Phillips, the second of which succeeded in diving to 100 feet in 1852. Phillips offered his boat to the U.S. Navy but was rejected; he was turned down again when he offered to build another submarine at the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. Nevertheless, the Civil War stimulated unofficial interest in submarines in both the Union and the Confederacy. At least three Northern projects saw fruition. The first, the Alligator, was the brainchild of Brutus de Villeroi, a French immigrant inventor who, in 1859, had built a submarine for a Philadelphia treasure-hunting consortium. (Before coming to the United States, de Villeroi had taught mathematics in France. His students, it seems, included Jules Verne, whose 1870 novel Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea greatly popularized the notion of submarines.) De Villeroi’s earlier project still was extant in 1861 when war came and he staged a dramatic demonstration in Philadelphia harbor—during which he and the submarine were arrested—to promote his concepts. The Alligator was built for the U.S. Navy by the Philadelphia Navy Yard and commissioned in May 1862. After ineffective service on the James and Appomattox rivers (the waters there were too shallow), the boat was refitted at Washington Navy Yard and dispatched to engage in operations off Charleston, South Carolina. While under tow to the war zone, the Alligator foundered in a storm off the North Carolina Outer Banks on 2 April 1863; its wreck is currently the subject of a major search. Also vying for a navy contract was Julius Kroehl, a German immigrant engineer who had considerable experience working with diving bells. Kroehl built his design as a private venture after de Villeroi won the official contract, but his boat was still incomplete at the end of the war. He succeeded, however, in selling both his Sub Marine Explorer and his own expertise to the Pacific Pearl Company in 1866 as a platform for exploiting the prolific pearl oyster beds off the Panamanian Pacific coast, where it operated for three years. The\n\nEARLY SUBMARINES\n\nabandoned craft was found close inshore in 2000 and currently is under active archaeological investigation. The third Northern boat, the Intelligent Whale, was built by the American Submarine Company, a group of speculators who planned to use it as a privateer. When that plan failed and the U.S. Navy declined to accept the boat, construction slowed and it was not completed until 1866. In 1872 the navy eventually agreed to undertake trials of the Intelligent Whale, which it failed, and the submarine was abandoned. It still survives, however, and is on exhibit at the National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey at Sea Girt. Inventors in the Confederacy also produced several submarines, the best known being James R. McClintock’s series of boats, initially built as private venture privateers. The first, the Pioneer, was built for Horace L. Hunley’s New Orleans privateering consortium but was scuttled before becoming operational when the city fell to the Union in April 1862. McClintock then built the Pioneer II at Mobile. Efforts to make first an electric motor and then a steam plant functional both failed, and McClintock had to revert to a handcranked propeller to drive his boat. The Pioneer II was not a great success, and it sank while being towed to attack the Union Fleet off Fort Monroe. The expanded consortium constructed a third boat, the H.L. Hunley, whose trials proved more successful; its transfer in July of 1863 to Charleston, South Carolina, led to its proposed use to break the Union blockade by General P. G. T. Beauregard, the local commander. The Confederate Navy, reluctant to trust the abilities or enthusiasm of the boat’s civilian crew, seized it and manned it with naval personnel. An accident drowned five of its crew on 30 August, and another on 15 October drowned the entire replacement crew, including Hunley himself. The boat finally went into action on the night of 17 February 1864, sinking the steam sloop Housatonic, but it failed to return. The novelist Clive Cussler funded an expedition that located the wreck of the H.L. Hunley in May 1995. It was raised in August 2000 and is currently undergoing conservation in Charleston. In addition to a series of semisubmersible spar torpedo boats, known as Davids, for the Confederate Navy, the South produced several other submarines. Little is known about the origins of a boat built at New Orleans in June 1861, although it is most probably the vessel that was found during dredging operations there in 1879; it is now on exhibit at the Louisiana State Museum in the city. The Tredegar Ironworks at Richmond, Virginia, built at least one boat to a\n\n5\n\n6\n\nSUBMARINES\n\ndesign by William Cheeney. After successful trials on the James River in October 1861, it was sunk while attacking a Union ship in Hampton Roads the following month. John Halligan designed a submarine, the St. Patrick, which was built at the Selma Navy Yard for the Confederate Navy and commissioned in January 1865. It made an abortive attack on the gunboat Octorara on 27 January and most probably was scuttled in April when the war came to an end. The U.S. Navy, especially after its unhappy experiences with fir s t the Alligator and then the Intelligent Whale, expressed no interest in submarines, but that did not deter private inventors. The most successful and influential of them was John P. Holland, an Irish immigrant who single-mindedly pursued the creation of a practical submarine for 40 years from 1874, submitting in that year a design for a one-man submarine to the navy. It was rejected, but Holland found financial backing from the Fenian Brotherhood, an organization working for Irish independence that saw the potential for submarines in overturning the Royal Navy’s supremacy and forcing Britain to give up its rule of Ireland. He built a gasoline-engine-powered prototype (Holland I ) in 1878, followed by the larger Fenian Ram in 1881. After two years of meticulous trials in New York Harbor, the Fenian Brotherhood, frustrated by Holland’s perfectionism, seized the boat and moved it to New Haven, Connecticut. It eventually was exhibited in Holland’s hometown of Paterson, New Jersey, where it remains today. Holland, meanwhile, formed a new partnership, the Nautilus Submarine Boat Company, with a group led by Edmund L. Zalinsky, a U.S. Army artillery offic e r. Using additional data gleaned from a half-size boat (Holland III) he had built while the Fenian Ram was undergoing trials, Holland developed a new submarine armed with Zalinsky’s dynamite gun (Holland IV). A botched launching on 4 September 1885 sank the new boat, but it was raised, repaired, and tested. The partnership was unable to find a purchaser for its submarine, however, and the company folded by the winter of 1886. An open U.S. Navy competition for submarine designs in 1888 revived Holland’s hopes. His design was judged the best, but his sponsoring shipbuilder—the William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company at Philadelphia—declined to guarantee its performance and the contract was canceled. He won a second competition the following year, only to see that contract also canceled, when President Benjamin Harrison’s new secretary of the navy, Benjamin F. Tracy, transferred the funds to surface ship projects. Congress again funded a submarine in 1893 and Holland’s design once more won the competition, but it was not until 1895 that the John P.\n\nEARLY SUBMARINES\n\nHolland Torpedo Boat Company received a contract to build the Plunger for the U.S. Navy. Official requirements included steam propulsion and a triple screw arrangement, both of which Holland correctly anticipated would cause problems. While the Plunger was still being built, the company began construction of a private venture boat, the Holland VI, that more accurately reflected Holland’s concept of a submarine to meet the navy’s needs. This boat proved itself one of the most successful submarines yet built; it attracted much foreign attention and eventually was purchased by the U.S. Navy on 11 April 1900 and commissioned as the Holland. The costs of testing and perfecting it, however, forced Holland to seek additional capital, leading to the incorporation of his firm in 1899 into the Electric Boat Company as a subsidiary. He became the company’s general manager but soon was demoted to chief engineer and learned that ownership of his patents, both U.S. and international, had passed to the Electric Boat Company. He resigned from the firm on 28 March 1904, even as his improved Holland VII design became a spectacular success: 24 examples served with the U.S., British, Russian, Japanese, and Dutch fleets, and provided the starting point for further major development in those countries and Austria-Hungary. Only two further boats designed by Holland himself were constructed, for Japan, before he died on 12 August 1914. The Electric Boat Company, in the meantime, went on to dominate the design of submarines for the U.S. Navy until after the end of World War I and continued as a major exporter of both vessels and designs. Holland was not without rivals for submarine work. In 1885, Josiah H. L. Tuck constructed a submarine that used caustic soda to generate heat for a boiler that provided steam to its engine. The Peacemaker had a submerged endurance of five hours and participated in the U.S. Navy’s 1888 and 1889 competitions. Tuck’s family, fearing that he had squandered most of his fortune on his experiments, had him committed to an insane asylum soon afterward. Holland also faced competition from George C. Baker in 1893. Not only did Baker have a full-size submarine to demonstrate (Holland was quite complimentary about its use of swiveling propellers amidships and the incorporation of a clutch that allowed the steam engine to charge the batteries while running on the surface) but he also was well connected in Washington, which accounted for a good part of the delay in awarding the contract to Holland. Holland’s most serious competitor, however, was Simon Lake, who adopted a very different approach to submarine operation.\n\n7\n\n8\n\nSUBMARINES\n\nHolland designed his submarines to operate underwater with a small net positive buoyancy and to dive, maintain depth, and surface using the dynamic forces generated by the motion of water over the stern diving planes. His main ballast tanks filled completely upon submerging to achieve stability by eliminating free-surface motion and maintaining a fixed center of gravity amidships. This formula made his boats safe and maneuverable underwater but also made them slow to dive. Lake relied on a combination of ballast adjustment to control buoyancy—using several tanks and pumps—and multiple diving planes to control depth. His submarines dived and rose on a level keel. Lake’s formula made his submarines potentially less safe and less hydrodynamically efficient than Holland’s, but also much faster divers. Lake’s early submarines (Argonaut I and II) also incorporated diver’s airlocks and wheels for movement on the seabed, largely because he initially conceived his craft for salvage operations. They were not successful at first in attracting interest from the U.S. Navy but were exported to Russia and Austria-Hungary. His designs, in the absence of adequate patent protection, were also thoroughly exploited by Krupp’s Germania shipyard and its submarine designer, Raimondo Lorenzo D’Equevilley-Montjustin, in producing its first boats, supplied to the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian, and Norwegian fleets. Lake obtained his first domestic contract in 1909 and continued to build a relatively small number of boats for the U.S. Navy until his firm went out of business in 1924. The French Navy was the most enthusiastic advocate of submarines prior to 1900. Its first boat, the Plongeur, was designed by Charles Brun and Siméon Bourgeois, entering service in 1867. It used an 80-horsepower compressed-air engine for propulsion and relied on small stern diving planes and an elaborate water transfer system, also compressed-air operated, to maintain position. This system proved ineffective, and the Plongeur soon was set aside. Electric propulsion underwater seemed a superior solution and was demonstrated by Claude Goubet in two small private venture boats that otherwise were unsuccessful. The French Navy’s return to submarine construction was also all-electric. The Gymnôte, designed by Gustave Zédé, entered service in 1888 and was followed by Gaston Romazzotti’s Gustave Zédé five years later. Both boats were largely experimental, relied wholly on batteries without onboard recharge equipment to power their electric motors (severely restricting their range), and required many modifications, especially to their diving plane arrangements, to become effective.\n\nEARLY SUBMARINES\n\nIn 1898 the French Navy announced an open international submarine design competition. Maxime Laubeuf ’s design, the Narval, was the winner, and, although many of the boat’s features were short-lived, it established the essential characteristics of the vast majority of the world’s naval submarines until the end of World War II. Laubeuf designed the Narval as a double-hulled craft; the inner hull was strongly constructed to resist water pressure, while the outer hull was lightly built and optimized for surface performance. The space between the hulls accommodated ballast and trim tanks. The Narval, like almost all submarines for the next 50 years, was essentially a surface torpedo boat that could submerge to attack and make its escape. Like many French submarines of the next 25 years, it was steam powered: the French Navy was uncomfortable with using gasoline engines in submarines because of the explosion hazard. In 1904 the Aigrette became the first submarine to be fitted with a diesel engine, and with few exceptions all later French submarines used either diesel or steam plants. Steam engines remained attractive because France did not have access to sufficiently powerful diesel engines for its large boats. The Royal Navy came late to submarine operation, and much of its early design development built upon experience with Holland’s boats. There had, however, been an earlier native effort in submarine design. In 1878, George W. Garrett built a small submarine (R e s u r g a m) driven by a hand-cranked propeller, and he followed it the next year with a larger steam-powered craft. The Resurgam II relied on the retained superheated steam in its boiler to power its engine while submerged. Garrett had not fully solved his boat’s longitudinal stability problems, but it nevertheless attracted the attention of the Swedish industrialist Thorsten Nordenfelt, who contracted with AB Palmcrants and Company in Stockholm to build an enlarged version of the Resurgam. Known as the Nordenfelt I, it was purchased by the Greek Navy in 1886 at a time of considerable tension over the status of Macedonia. In response the Turkish government ordered two larger boats of similar type that were delivered in 1887, one of which, the Abdul Hamid, was the first submarine to launch a selfpropelled torpedo while submerged. The final Garrett-designed boat, the Nordenfelt IV, was built for Russia in 1887 at the Barrow-in-Furness yard, which would later become the most prolific producer of submarines in the United Kingdom. Nordenfelt IV ran aground off the Danish coast while on its delivery voyage and was lost. British submarine design took a decisive turn away from Holland’s concepts with the development of the D class, which entered service\n\n9\n\n10\n\nSUBMARINES\n\nin 1908. These much larger boats introduced saddle tanks for ballast and marked the British shift to long-range craft optimized for surface operation and seaworthiness. They set the pattern for subsequent British development that was broken only by the R class, built as antisubmarine platforms and optimized for underwater performance, which entered service very late in World War I. The only other deviation was the manifestation of a fixation for “fleet submarines”—boats fast enough to accompany the battlefleet while on the surface and operate as stealth torpedo boats upon contacting the enemy. The J class was essentially a normal British type fitted with greatly increased engine power. The K class used steam turbines to generate the speed required, but it proved appallingly dangerous and difficult to operate. Despite Bauer’s early work and the considerable effort expended on submarines in both Russia and France in the later nineteenth century, there was little German interest in the type until the dawn of the twentieth century. The Krupp industrial conglomerate, however, saw the potential for a new market and began working aggressively to stimulate it. It began by building a small boat designed by a Spanish engineer, Raimondo Lorenzo D’Equevilley-Montjustin, whose ideas owed much to Nordenfelt’s submarines. His Forelle proved moderately successful but did not attract German naval attention. Fortunately for Krupp, lack of U.S. Navy interest in his designs led Simon Lake to turn to Europe as a market for his boats. He attempted to negotiate a license arrangement with Krupp, in the process transferring much of his design information to the firm as an inducement. The deal fell through, but Krupp retained the data; D’Equevilley exploited this knowledge to produce a very competent design that found buyers in Russia, Norway, Austria-Hungary, and Germany. This activity stimulated official interest, leading the Torpedo Department of the Imperial German Navy to set up the Unterseebootkonstruktionsbüro in 1904, led by Gustave Berling; it developed its own somewhat similar submarine design, which went into production in 1907. The departure of the non-German D’Equevilley and his replacement by Hans Techel on 1 July 1907, opened the way for cooperation between Krupp and the navy and rapid design development in the years before World War I. The result was technical improvement and growth in size and capabilities, although it is notable that the navy was slow to adopt diesel engines in place of gasoline or oil engines. During World War I the Imperial German Navy accepted some 100 new boats of the Mobilization type, a largely standardized design\n\nEARLY SUBMARINES\n\nsubject to continual improvements culminating in the Mittel-U type, which proved very capable. These standard submarines were supplemented by mass-produced coastal boats particularly suited to the geographic advantage of operating from Flanders against enemy shipping from 1915. The UB series of conventional submarines evolved, from very small UB-I boats of 127 tons with 14-man crews, to the 516-ton UB-III boats that were essentially diminutives of the Mittel-U type. The parallel UC series of coastal minelaying submarines followed a similar evolutionary path. In addition, the navy also commissioned a few full-size minelayers and a series of very large, long-range boats, the U-cruisers. Both Italy and Sweden began indigenous submarine design and construction virtually contemporaneously with similar developments in Germany. Italian submarine development was dominated by the concepts of Cesare Laurenti, whose designs conformed to the submersible torpedo boat school propounded by Laubeuf. The Swedish Navy sent one of its designers, Carl Richson, on a mission to study overseas submarine design and construction. Upon his return he began development of his own boats, drawing heavily on Holland principles at first but soon trending more toward submersible-type craft.\n\nALLIED SUBMARINE OPERATIONS DURING WORLD WAR I At the outbreak of World War I, the British and French navies were by far the two largest operators of submarines in the world, each possessing more than twice as many as the German Fleet. The Russian Fleet had a relatively long tradition of submarine operation, but its force was small and divided between the Baltic and Black seas. Like all the world’s navies, they had no clear doctrines for the use of their submarine forces, nor any real appreciation of the directions that wartime operations would take. The main British submarine force was deployed as the 8th (Overseas) Submarine Flotilla, with the most modern, long-range boats at Harwich. Its primary role was offensive patrol and reconnaissance off the German coast. The older, short-range vessels were deployed to Grimsby, Dover, and Portsmouth, to provide coastal defense patrols along the eastern and southern coasts. French submarines were deployed in the Channel and, initially, in a defensive barrier to cover the movement of troops from North Africa to Metropolitan France.\n\n11\n\n12\n\nSUBMARINES\n\nThe British overseas submarines undertook patrols in the Helgoland Bight from the outset, bringing back useful information about the German Fleet’s movements. Several attempts were made to employ submarines in conjunction with surface units during sweeps intended to trap and destroy elements of the High Seas Fleet, but none were very successful. Patrol lines intended to ambush German Fleet units became a regular feature of British North Sea submarine operation throughout the war. They had some successes and caused the Germans to exercise caution in their operations, but overall they were relatively unproductive. Russia had eight active submarines in the Baltic, of which only one was capable of more than short-range operation. The Admiralty decided to send submarines to the Baltic to support Russian operations and to attack the ore traffic from Sweden to Germany. In October 1914, two submarines, the E-1 and the E-9, passed through the Danish Straits and arrived at Lapvik to commence operations. German antisubmarine activity forced a third submarine to return. They undertook several patrols in conjunction with Russian submarines before the onset of winter ended operations. Baltic submarine operations resumed in late April. The E - 9 , commanded by Lieutenant-Commander Max Horton, gained the first success by sinking the collier Dora Hugo Stennes and severely damaging the destroyer S-148 on 5 June 1915. The British sent four additional submarines to the Baltic in August, one of which ran aground off Copenhagen and was destroyed; the others successfully joined operations. The E-1, commanded by LieutenantCommander Noel Laurence, damaged the battlecruiser Von der Tann on 19 August; the E-8 destroyed the armored cruiser Prinz A d a l b e r t on 23 October; and the E - 1 9 sank the light cruiser U n d i n e on 7 November. In addition, British and Russian submarines sank or captured 17 freighters and caused 4 more to strand. These operations, especially against German warships, caused considerable disruption of German operations in the Baltic during the year and prompted the Swedish Navy to begin convoying its shipping. In response to the depredations of Allied submarines in 1915, the German commander-in-chief, Grossadmiral Prinz Heinrich von Preussen, introduced escorted convoy of shipping between Sweden and Germany. That proved very successful: only five freighters were lost, despite intensive Allied submarine activity, while one British submarine sank after hitting a mine. The British sent another four small submarines to the Baltic in August via Arkhangel’sk, but they\n\nEARLY SUBMARINES\n\nwere not operational until early October; they undertook only one patrol before ice ended operations. During 1917, Allied submarines were heavily engaged in an attempt to hinder German advances into the Gulf of Riga, in which they were largely unsuccessful. Only a single freighter was sunk during that year, while one British and three Russian submarines were lost. In addition, German advances led to the scuttling of four Russian and seven British submarines to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. The A n g l o - French assault on the Dardanelles in April 1915 prompted both navies to send submarines into the Sea of Marmora to attack Turkish shipping and warships supporting the defenders. A total of 13 submarines attempted the passage, but only five succeeded in reaching their goal, four from each navy being lost. The submarines sank the battleship Barbarossa, the coast defense ship Messudiyeh, 6 smaller warships, 55 merchant ships, and 148 sailing vessels, although some of those subsequently were salved. Russian submarines also operated against Turkish shipping in the Black Sea with some success. The submarine Nerpa was particularly successful: on 5 September, operating with two destroyers, it wiped out a Turkish convoy of five ships by driving them ashore where the destroyers shelled them to destruction. Russian operations continued against Turkish and German shipping in the Black Sea throughout 1916 and 1917, right up to the time of the Russian Revolution. Although the number of vessels they sank was relatively small, their operations caused considerable disruption of vital traffic, especially coal deliveries. By the end of 1916, the shortage of coal was such that the Turkish Fleet at Istanbul had been essentially immobilized. The Russians never deployed more than ten submarines in the Black Sea: they carried out well over 250 patrols during 1916 and 1917, with the loss of only one boat. France deployed submarines to the Adriatic in 1914, losing the Curie on 8 December in an attempt to penetrate the Austrian base at Pola. After Italy entered the war, 6 French submarines joined some 20 Italian boats in operations in the Adriatic. Both sides in the Adriatic conducted a campaign of hit-and-run raids and ambushes throughout much of the war. Allied submarines played a major role in these operations, but overall their successes were very limited: a half-dozen small warships and fewer than 50 merchant vessels, for the loss of 12 of their own number. Allied submarines also took part in the antisubmarine campaign. Between May and October 1915, the British deployed submarines\n\n13\n\n14\n\nSUBMARINES\n\ntowed behind decoy trawlers, the two vessels communicating via telephone lines. When a U-boat approached the trawler, the towed submarine would be cast off and would maneuver to attack it. The program had two successes but was abandoned once the British learned that the Germans had become aware of its existence. Antisubmarine warfare became the primary mission of the British submarine force during the final two years of the war, and they were joined by U.S. Navy boats in March of 1918. The Admiralty divided the waters around the British Isles into patrol areas in which individual submarines operated for eight-day periods, submerging by day and surfacing at night. The campaign succeeded in sinking 13 out of 390 sighted U-boats. The low ratio of sightings to sinkings was primarily a consequence of the low speed of submerged submarines. That led to the development of the specialized “R” class boats, whose underwater speed was almost twice that of their surfaced speed; however, these submarines entered service too late to have an impact on the war.\n\nCENTRAL POWERS SUBMARINE OPERATIONS DURING WORLD WAR I When war began in 1914, both Germany and Austria-Hungary had small but relatively up-to-date fleets of submarines (there were 31 operational U-boats in the German Navy and 5 in the AustroHungarian). Like the Allies, they had no clear doctrines concerning their use. Furthermore, the prewar plans of neither fleet long survived contact with the realities of the war. The Royal Navy adopted a strategy of distant blockade rather than the close blockade that the German Navy had anticipated, while Italy declined to join its allies in the Triple Alliance and chose to remain neutral, upsetting Austrian expectations of the situation in the Adriatic. Germany adopted a strategy of kleinkrieg, seeking to draw out elements of the Grand Fleet into disadvantageous positions, both geographically and numerically, and whittling away at British naval strength with mines and submarines. During 1914, German U-boats, demonstrating much greater operational capabilities than prewar exercises had suggested, scored considerable successes. The most spectacular was on 22 September, when Kapitänleutnant Otto Weddigen, commanding the U-9, torpedoed and sank three British armored cruisers—the Aboukir, the Cressy, and the Hogue—within\n\nEARLY SUBMARINES\n\nlittle more than an hour off the Dutch coast. The Royal Navy very quickly came to regard the menace of German submarines as the greatest single threat to its naval superiority. Despite this success, by early 1915 it was clear that the strategy of kleinkrieg was not working. The British distant blockade was proving all too effective in cutting off Germany’s access to most foreign trade, while the Grand Fleet, far from allowing detached elements to fall into German traps, was succeeding in cutting off detachments of the High Seas Fleet and inflicting serious damage upon them. The threat of an intensified British mining campaign and the expansion of the terms of the blockade were tightening the screw. German submarines had not conducted any coordinated campaign against Allied merchant shipping: the transport of the British Expeditionary Force to France and its subsequent supply had been conducted virtually without any interference from the German Fleet. But German submarines had demonstrated that U-boats could be effective in that role, even under the limitations of the Prize Regulations of the Declaration of London of 1909, which required warships either to take merchant crews and passengers on board or provide for their safety prior to sinking their ships. A growing number of offic e r s within the navy, as well as influential politicians and businessmen, began to see a “counterblockade” of Britain as the solution to Germany’s dilemma, using submarines to attack and sink without warning all British shipping and neutral vessels trading with the United Kingdom. The government was well aware of the potential for serious repercussions from neutral nations, especially the United States, but it decided that the gains were worth the risk. Therefore, on 4 Fe b r uary 1915, the waters around Great Britain and Ireland, including the whole of the English Channel and the western portion of the North Sea, were declared to be a war zone within which any merchant ship, British or neutral, would be destroyed, without necessarily being possible to ensure the safety of crew or passengers. The German Navy began this first unrestricted submarine campaign against merchant shipping with very limited resources. Ty p ically there were no more than about 25 operational U-boats available, of which only about one-third were deployed on station at any one time (the remainder being either in transit or refitting). The campaign began on 28 February, and, despite the small number of active U-boats, did well. In all, 29 vessels totaling some 89,500 gross tons were sunk in March; 33 ships totaling 38,600 tons in April; 53 vessels totaling 126,900 tons in May; 114 ships totaling 115,291 tons in June; 86 ships totaling 98,005 tons in July; 107 vessels totaling\n\n15\n\n16\n\nSUBMARINES\n\n182,772 tons in August; and 58 ships totaling 136,048 tons in September. British antisubmarine measures accounted for 15 U-boats, but the German Navy commissioned 25 new boats during the period. The German announcement of 4 February had almost immediate diplomatic repercussions, especially the U.S. government’s note warning Germany that it would be held strictly accountable for any loss of U.S. ships or lives. Consequently, the German government compromised on its initial declaration, placing some restrictions on attacks against vessels flying neutral flags. That was much to the chagrin of officers in the fleet, who had envisaged the unrestricted campaign so terrorizing neutral shippers that they would cease to trade with Great Britain. A number of attacks on Dutch, Greek, Norwegian, and Swedish vessels, including some inside areas declared safe, provoked outraged diplomatic responses from those neutrals and led to the German government offering compensation in several instances and prohibiting attacks against neutral vessels. The major blow, however, to the unrestricted campaign was the sinking of the transatlantic liner Lusitania without warning off the western coast of Ireland on 7 May 1915, by Kapitänleutnant Walter Schwieger, commanding the U-20. Among the 1,201 passengers and crew who lost their lives were 128 U.S. citizens, causing a major diplomatic furor between the United States and Germany that was heightened by the torpedoing of the U.S. ship Nebraskan without warning on 25 May. Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg, despite strong opposition from the fleet, forbade attacks on large passenger liners, whatever flag they flew, and his efforts succeeded in mollifying President Wilson’s government—although Germany still suffered from a sharp drop in the U.S. public’s estimation. As the sinking record shows, these greater restrictions did not substantially affect the success of the campaign against merchant shipping. Nevertheless, there remained the threat of further incidents that might force Germany to terminate the campaign. Kapitänleutnant Schwieger, who had sunk the Lusitania, succeeded in providing two such incidents by sinking the British liner Arabic without warning on 19 August and the U.S. liner Hesperian later in the month. Those two events provoked a further crisis between the United States and Germany and exacerbated the concerns of the German Army’s general staff about increased complications with neutral nations in light of an impending shortage of troops. The government, over the protests of senior naval officers, forced a prohibition of attacks against any liners and a withdrawal of all U-boats from operations in the western approaches to the English Channel.\n\nEARLY SUBMARINES\n\nAdmiral Henning von Holtzendorff became head of the naval staff, and, on 18 September, after deciding that the submarine campaign had failed, he terminated most U-boat operations against shipping. He also bound all continued action to conform with the Prize Regulations, thus ending the unrestricted campaign. The British merchant marine had lost 1,294,000 tons of shipping from all causes up to the end of September 1915. New construction totaled 1,233,00 tons, and captured enemy shipping added a further 682,000 tons. Nevertheless, losses were outstripping replacements, while the sinkings in August and September were a serious concern and an omen for the future potential of a submarine campaign. Holtzendorff continued the restricted campaign against merchant shipping. From October 1915 to February 1916, U-boats sank 209 ships totaling 506,026 gross tons (about 75 percent of those sinkings were in the Mediterranean). The campaign sharpened after attacks without warning were permitted against armed merchant vessels, beginning on 29 February. During the next two months the U-boats sank 143 ships totaling 347,843 tons, but again an incident involving U.S. citizens precipitated a further diplomatic crisis. On 24 March, Oberleutnant zur See Pustkuchen, commanding the UB-29, torpedoed the French cross-Channel steamer Sussex without warning off Dieppe, killing some 50 passengers and crew including 25 Americans. President Wilson reacted by warning Germany that any further incident would lead to the United States severing diplomatic relations. On 24 April, Holtzendorff reinstated his order requiring submarines to operate within the Prize Regulations, causing Admiral Scheer angrily to order all submarines to cease operation. British losses fell immediately, to 64,000 tons in May and only 37,000 tons in June. Nevertheless, British shipping losses for the first half of 1916 approached a half-million tons, well over twice the rate of new construction. For the next few months the High Seas Fleet boats operated primarily in support of fleet operations on the North Sea, leaving attacks on merchant shipping to the Flanders boats and U-boats in the Mediterranean. The pace of the restricted campaign picked up in September, when 172 ships totaling 231,573 tons were sunk. Between October 1916 and January 1917 a further 757 ships totaling 1,304,290 tons were sunk in all theaters. This increase reflected the larger number of operational U-boats, which reached a total of 103 submarines in January 1917. Despite this advance, the navy was convinced that the restricted campaign was doomed to failure in bringing Britain to terms. When\n\n17\n\n18\n\nSUBMARINES\n\ncombined with the Allied rejection of German peace proposals and successes on the Eastern Front that released additional troops, the consensus among the high command and in government tipped toward renewal of the unrestricted campaign. Holtzendorff, relying on calculations of available British shipping and requirements, and assuming that neutrals would be terrorized into ceasing to trade with Britain, determined that an unrestricted campaign sinking 600,000 tons of shipping per month would reduce traffic to and from the United Kingdom by close to 40 percent within five months and force a peace settlement. There was a very real risk that such a campaign would bring the United States into the war against Germany, but it was thought that U.S. shipping and troops could not participate in time to influence the outcome. On 9 January 1917, the government decided that an unrestricted campaign would begin on 1 February. The predicted diplomatic consequence of launching the new unrestricted campaign was not long in coming. On 3 February 1917, President Wilson severed diplomatic relations with Germany. The Zimmerman Telegram—containing a proposal for a German-Mexican and even a German-Japanese alliance against the United States—surfaced and exacerbated the tension between the two nations. A series of almost inevitable sinkings of U.S. ships or vessels carrying U.S. citizens as passengers hastened matters, and on 6 April the United States declared war on Germany. The campaign commenced on schedule, with some 120 U-boats deployed. Shipping losses rose dramatically to 520,412 tons in February; 564,497 tons in March; and 860,334 tons in April, at the cost of only nine U-boats. From that peak, losses dropped to 616,316 tons in May and 696,725 tons in June. As the British gradually expanded the scope of convoy from mid-May, losses declined still further to 555,514 tons in July; 472,372 tons in August; 353,602 tons in September; 466,542 tons in October; 302,599 tons in November; and 411,766 tons in December. Forty-three U-boats were sunk in the same six-month period, more than three times the number lost in the first six months of the year. During the first six months of 1918, U-boats sank 1,864,440 tons of shipping and a further 889,442 tons up to the Armistice on 11 November. German losses were high—more than 120 U-boats were sunk. Furthermore, as the U-boats sought out weak links—areas in which ships sailed without the benefit of convoy—the Allies extended the scope of the system until the vast majority of shipping was covered. The German unrestricted submarine campaign against shipping had failed.\n\nEARLY SUBMARINES\n\nThe small number of Austrian submarines in operational service at the beginning of the war and their limited range effectively confined their use to the Adriatic. After France declared war on 13 August 1914, elements of its Mediterranean Fleet commenced operations there, making sweeps with heavy ships and undertaking minor landings—all in the hope of influencing Italy to join the Allies. Austrian submarines always were a threat, one that became a reality on 21 December, when the U-12 torpedoed the French flagship, the dreadnought Jean Bart, without, however, sinking the battleship. This incident convinced the French to give up offensive operations in the Adriatic and focus instead on a distant blockade of the Straits of Otranto. In the run-up to the entry of Italy into the war on the side of the Allies, the French moved their blockading squadron further north into the Adriatic. Linienschiffsleutnant Georg Ritter von Trapp (better known as the Baron in the Sound of Music), commanding the U-5, succeeded in torpedoing and sinking the armored cruiser Leon Gambetta, with heavy loss of life, on the night of 26 April 1915— demonstrating once again the vulnerability of surface vessels in these confined waters. After Italy entered the war, the situation remained much the same. In the face of the threat posed by submarines, heavy ships could not operate effectively in the Adriatic, and operations became largely a quasi-guerrilla war in which the Austrian submarines, reinforced by small German U-boats transferred overland, played a major role. Germany began transferring submarines to the Mediterranean theater in May 1915, when it became clear that the limited A u strian submarine force could do little to affect operations in the area, despite their effectiveness in the Adriatic. They scored some considerable successes on arrival. Kapitänleutnant Otto Hersing, commanding the U-21, torpedoed and sank the British predreadnought battleship Triumph at the Dardanelles on 25 May and another, the Majestic, two days later. Two smaller submarines, however, proved very much less effective, and subsequent German submarine operations during the Dardanelles campaign proved largely inconsequential. The German Navy continued to send U-boats to the Mediterranean, sending the smaller boats overland by rail for assembly at Pola and passing the larger boats through the Straits of Gibraltar. One early arrival, the UB-15, commanded by Oberleutnant zur See von Heimburg, sank the Italian submarine Medusa in the Adriatic on\n\n19\n\n20\n\nSUBMARINES\n\n1 June 1915. Von Heimburg, now commanding the UB-14, then sank the Italian armored cruiser Amalfi on 7 July, before sailing into the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean theater was attractive because there were clearly defined focal points through which much traffic had to pass. It obviously was crucial for French and Italian traffic, and much British shipping sailed through the sea. The weather would permit operations during the fall and winter, when it could hamper Atlantic operations, and it also was much less probable that problems would arise with the United States, since few U.S. ships or passengers sailed through. The German submarine campaign in the Mediterranean began in earnest in October 1915. The submarines used Austrian bases at Pola and Cattaro for their operations. During that month five large Uboats sank 63,848 tons of shipping—more than three-quarters of all merchant vessel sinkings in all theaters. More large and small boats reinforced the Mediterranean flotilla, with merchant shipping losses reaching 152,882 tons in November and 76,693 tons in December. During 1916 the U-boat campaign in the Mediterranean continued its successes. The first quarter of the year saw losses decline as the U-boats underwent refits, contended with winter weather, and were subject to restrictions on attacking passenger liners. Nevertheless, losses were high enough to lead the Allies to strengthen their patrol systems and divert as much shipping as possible from sailing through the Mediterranean, even though that extended voyages and tied up vessel capacity. New boats arriving from Germany and existing boats returning to service pushed merchant shipping losses in the Mediterranean for the second quarter of 1916 to 192,225 tons, about half of all losses in all theaters. These successes continued into the summer and fall, as German U-boats sank 321,542 tons of shipping between July and September. Nor was there any real relief in the fall and early winter, since a further 427,999 tons of shipping went down by the end of the year. In aggregate, German U-boats sank well over a million tons of shipping during 1916, while losing only two submarines, one of which sank after running into one of its own mines. The beginning of 1917 brought the illusion of calm, as most of the German U-boats were refitted. Losses fell to 78,541 tons in January, before rising again to 105,670 tons in February and then dropping to 61,917 tons in March. The Germans reinforced their Mediterranean flotilla, and new Austrian boats, based on the German UB-II class, joined the German submarines in operations in the\n\nEARLY SUBMARINES\n\ncentral Mediterranean. Together they sank 277,948 tons of shipping in April. The Allies were forced to reappraise their system of trade protection and began introducing convoy of merchant shipping in late May. Losses fell to 180,896 tons in May and 170,473 tons in June. Even though the Germans increased their U-boat force by more than 25 percent, losses continued to decline in July and August, to 107,303 tons and 118,372 tons, respectively. An unprofitable diversion of U-boats in the fall to support operations in Syria against the Allied offensive netted a few small warships but relieved the pressure on merchant shipping. Success returned, however, as the U-boats re-entered the campaign against merchant shipping in December, at which time losses rose to 148,331 tons. Once again, Germany’s total U-boat loss for the year was two boats, while the German and Austrian submarines sank well over 1.25 million tons of shipping. Finally in 1918, Allied efforts to protect trade bore fruit. During the first six months of the year, German and Austrian submarines sank about 600,000 tons of shipping, but their losses rose to ten boats, twice their total losses for the previous three years. The submarines’ success rate fell dramatically in the months before the Armistice: they sank less than 250,000 tons of shipping and lost an additional four boats in the process. Moreover, these diminished accomplishments came about despite the fact that almost twice as many submarines were operational as in 1917. Between 1915 and 1917, the German Navy operated a small number of submarines in the Black Sea. The first boats arrived in May 1915 as part of Germany’s support for Turkey during the Dardanelles campaign. Most of the boats deployed were small UB- or UC-type coastal submarines; their successes were very limited, although their operations did cause the Russians to deploy their own hunting squadrons of destroyers. The few larger submarines dispatched to the Black Sea had no greater success. In all, Germany sent three large and about a dozen small submarines to the Black Sea, losing almost half of them, mostly to mines. In summation, then, the most important campaign in which the submarines of the Central Powers engaged—their operations against merchant shipping—came close to total success in April 1917, only to fail completely to overcome the effectiveness of the convoy system. In the process, however, they permanently redefined the role of the submarine in warfare.\n\n21\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nA War-Winning Weapon?\n\nThe navies of the world now moved to focus their attention on developing boats to serve in the roles of reconnaissance, offensive patrols against enemy warships, and cooperation with the battlefleet—all missions that had been envisaged prior to the outbreak of World War I. They were motivated in particular by the accomplishments of the Imperial German Navy’s submarine arm; the success of Allied countermeasures in the later stages of the conflict and the impending emergence of superior detection equipment; and a general revulsion against the very idea of unrestricted submarine warfare against merchant shipping. Navies in general sought to produce faster, stronger, more powerfully armed, and longer- r a n g e boats to fulfill these tasks. The improved submarine types shared many features. Functionally they were submersibles, rather than true submarines; their designs were optimized for operation on the surface, with only limited capabilities submerged. Underwater, they relied for propulsion on electric motors fed by large storage batteries; on the surface, they used diesel engines for propulsion and to recharge the batteries. While they incorporated substantial batteries of torpedo tubes and reload torpedoes, they also carried guns for use against surface or aerial targets. Their operational range was a function of their bunkerage for diesel fuel, while their submerged radius of action was limited by battery cell capacity. Maximum submerged speed usually was not much more than half of their surface speed, and maintaining high submerged speeds was impossible for any length of time without totally draining the batteries and forcing the submarine to the surface. Consequently, most navies conceived of operating their submarines primarily as stealthy surface vessels 23\n\n24\n\nSUBMARINES\n\nwith the ability to submerge for evasion or escape prior to or after an attack. German submarine designs exerted a major influence, either directly or indirectly, on most of the world’s submarine development in the years between the two world wars—except in Britain and, to a lesser extent, the Soviet Union. All the major navies of the victorious Allies—Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the United States—received examples of the latest German U-boats under the terms of the Armistice and the Treaty of Versailles. They intently examined and analyzed these German craft to determine the applicability and suitability of their features for incorporation into their own types and, in several instances, commissioned former German submarines into their own services to acquire operational experience in their use. Both Italian and French designers were very much influenced by studying and operating examples of the later Mittel-U and UB-III types prior to developing their first new postwar boats. The big U-cruisers had even more impact. The first French oceangoing submarines, the Requin class, benefited substantially from their designers’ study of U-cruisers. The big U.S. Navy fleet boats owed a great debt to the German boats (including even their diesel engines, in some cases), and German engineers were intimately involved in the development of the early Japanese kaidai and junsen types. German design influence spread to lesser fleets too, largely through the activities of the Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS). The IvS was established in July 1922 at Den Haag in The Netherlands by a consortium of the Krupp and Vulcan shipbuilding yards to circumvent the Versailles Treaty’s prohibition on submarine design and construction. The engineering staff was led by Hans Techel, who had headed Krupp’s submarine design team since 1907, and the firm also received clandestine financial support from the German Navy, which was desirous of maintaining German submarine design expertise despite the treaty. IvS engineers produced submarine designs that were constructed for Turkey, Finland, the Soviet Union, Spain, and Sweden, and also served as prototypes for the German Navy’s Type IIA coastal, Type IA long-range, and Type VII oceangoing U-boats. During the period between the two world wars, the world’s major navies constructed small series of submarines that served the dual purpose of meeting immediate operational needs and also providing data for the development of improved vessels. By the mid-1930s most of these navies had evolved one or two basic types apiece that were well matched to their operational requirements, had attained\n\nA WAR-WINNING WEAPON?\n\nsubstantial design maturity, and were suited to large-scale series production. In general, and with very few exceptions, the vast majority of the submarines that served during World War II were of these standardized types, modified in the light of operational experience, rather than radically new designs. The U.S. Navy took the process of type standardization the furthest, entering World War II with a single basic design that was improved but never replaced during the course of the conflict. These “fleet boats” emerged through the crystallization and synthesis of a series of designs produced to meet requirements for fleet submarines to accompany the battlefleet, cruiser submarines for longdistance raiding, and patrol submarines for offensive operations in the Pacific. Nine vessels, essentially experimental prototypes, in five classes were produced between 1921 and 1934, ranging in size from 1,100 to 2,700 tons standard (defined by the Washington Treaty as fully-equipped except for crew and fuel) on the surface. Overall these submarines were not very successful, suffering problems with their diesel machinery, diving ability, and general reliability, but they provided valuable experience and data for an improved design. The new series that began with the Porpoise class of 1934 were of 1,310 to 1,475 tons standard on the surface. They introduced dieselelectric reduction drive, which proved vastly more reliable than previous arrangements. Surface cruising range was 11,000 miles at 10 knots, and they had a patrol endurance of 75 days. They could operate for up to 48 hours submerged at 2 knots and had a safe operating depth limit of 250 feet. A battery of 6 to 8 torpedo tubes with 16 to 24 torpedoes was fitted, along with a light deck gun. Between 1934 and 1940, 38 submarines of this group were constructed, and they formed the backbone of the U.S. submarine force when the United States entered World War II. The Gato class that followed became the first mass-produced wartime class. Displacement rose to 1,526 tons, the torpedo tube battery increased to 10 tubes, and safe depth increased to 300 feet. They were followed by the very similar Balao class, which featured a deeper safe operating depth of 400 feet, accomplished by substituting high-tensile steel for the mild steel used in earlier boats. The Tench class introduced diesel-electric direct drive that brought about a very significant reduction in noise and internal machinery space, leading to the addition of four reload torpedoes to the outfit. A total of 221 submarines from these three classes were completed during or immediately after World War II. Significant wartime modifications included reducing superstructure, adding radar, and enhancing the\n\n25\n\n26\n\nSUBMARINES\n\ngun armament by fitting 4- or 5-inch deck guns and adding multiple light antiaircraft weapons. Japan also constructed very large submarines, intended to operate primarily as integral components of the battlefleet. The kaidai type design was based on a large German cruiser submarine from World War I; the type evolved into a series of 24 boats in five classes, constructed between 1921 and 1935. These vessels displaced between 1,390 and 1,635 tons standard, had operating ranges of between 10,000 and 14,000 miles at 10 knots, carried a battery of 6 to 8 tubes with 14 to 16 torpedoes, could operate submerged for 36 hours at 2 knots, and had a safe operating depth of between 200 and 250 feet. Japan, with considerable assistance from German engineers, also developed very large cruiser submarines of the junsen type between 1924 and 1938. These eight huge vessels had standard displacements of between 1,970 and 2,231 tons and an operational range of 24,000 miles at 10 knots; they could dive safely to 300 feet. In 1939, Japan essentially standardized its large submarine type with a vessel design displacing about 2,100 tons capable of cruising for 14,000 miles at 16 knots, or 24,000 miles at 10 knots, and diving to 330 feet. Three models were produced: a headquarters type emphasizing communications and command facilities, an attack type emphasizing torpedo armament, and a scouting type that added hangar space and a catapult for a small reconnaissance floatplane. Some 46 of these large submarines were constructed, as well as three others that brought together the facilities of all three types into the sen-toku type, a single monster hull displacing 3,530 tons standard. Japan also constructed 10 final examples of the kaidai type early in World War II. Unlike the United States, Japan also developed and constructed a series of medium submarines intended for coastal work. In addition, considerable effort was expended on midget submarines—small boats with two-man crews intended for stealthy attacks on ports and roadsteads after they had been transported close to the scene of operation by larger submarines. Finally, late in World War II, Japan was developing submarines with high underwater performance, but these never entered service. German submarines were developed clandestinely, inasmuch as the Versailles Treaty prohibited them in the German Navy. Design work, both at IvS and by the Blohm und Voss firm, continued for foreign navies with production undertaken in the customer’s yards under German supervision. These boats also served as prototypes for\n\nA WAR-WINNING WEAPON?\n\ndomestic production, which made it possible for the first new German submarine, the U-1, to be completed on 29 June 1935, only five weeks after the repudiation of the Versailles Treaty. The overwhelming majority of the 1,150 U-boats commissioned between 1935 and 1945 belonged to two groups: the so-called 500ton Type VII medium boats, and the 740-ton Type IX long-range submarines. The Type VIIC actually displaced between 760 and 1,000 tons on the surface, had a cruising range of 6,500 to 10,000 miles at 12 knots on the surface and 80 miles at 4 knots submerged. They had a battery of 5 torpedo tubes with 14 torpedoes, an 88mm deck gun, and ever-increasing numbers of light antiaircraft weapons. Almost 700 of these boats in all of their variants entered service during World War II. The Type XIC actually displaced 1,120 tons; it had a cruising range of 11,000 miles at 12 knots on the surface and 63 miles at 4 knots submerged. They had a battery of 6 torpedo tubes with 22 torpedoes, a 105mm deck gun, and ever-increasing numbers of light antiaircraft weapons. Almost 200 of this type and its variants were commissioned. Germany also commissioned a number of other important types during World War II. Among the most important were the Type X minelayers and the Type XIV supply boats. Both types operated as resuppliers for the operational boats during the Battle of the Atlantic, providing fuel, provisions, medical supplies, reload torpedoes, and even medical care and replacement crew members. Consequently they became prime targets for Allied antisubmarine forces, and few survived. The other major vessels were the radical Type XXI and Type XXIII boats, designed for high submerged speed and extended underwater operation. Revolutionary streamlined hull shapes, greatly increased battery space, and the installation of snorkels allowed these boats to operate at submerged speeds that made them very difficult targets for Allied antisubmarine forces. Confused production priorities, however, and the general shortage of materials late in the war prevented more than a very few from putting to sea operationally. British submarine development also was influenced by the cruiser and fleet submarine concepts, though the manifestation of those ideas was almost entirely through evolution from designs existing at the end of World War I. The main thrust of early evolution between the wars centered on the overseas patrol type, displacing 1,475 tons on the surface, with a range of 10,900 miles at 8 knots, a submerged endurance of 36 hours at 2 knots, and a diving depth of 500 feet. Armament included a battery of 8 torpedo tubes with\n\n27\n\n28\n\nSUBMARINES\n\n14 torpedoes and a 4-inch deck gun. A group of minelaying submarines of similar size also were built, as well as a small series of very fast large submarines for work with the fleet. Both of those developments, however, proved very costly and of limited operational utility. In the early 1930s a fresh start was made with the Swordfish class, designed for offensive patrols in narrow waters. These boats displaced 640 tons standard, had a cruising range of 3,800 miles at 9 knots on the surface and 36 hours at 3 knots submerged, and could dive to 300 feet. Armament was 6 torpedo tubes with 12 torpedoes and a 3-inch gun. A larger overseas patrol type, the Triton class, appeared in 1937. These displaced 1,090 tons standard, had a cruising range of 4,500 miles at 11 knots on the surface and 55 hours at 3 knots submerged, and could dive to 300 feet. Armament was 10 torpedo tubes with 16 torpedoes and a 4-inch gun. Britain concentrated its production of submarines during World War II on these two types, producing a total of 62 of the “S” type and 53 of the “T” type. Just before World War II the Royal Navy developed a small submarine for training not only crews and new commanding officers but also antisubmarine vessels. When war came the design was quickly adapted for operational use and proved particularly useful in confined waters such as the North Sea and Mediterranean. The U class displaced between 540 and 646 tons on the surface. It had a range of 3,600 miles at 10 knots on the surface, a submerged endurance of 60 hours at 2 knots, and a diving depth of 200 feet. Armament included a battery of 6 torpedo tubes with 10 torpedoes and a 3-inch deck gun. A total of 71 boats were constructed of this class and its slightly improved successors of the V class. While they were useful boats in the early part of the war, later examples diverted resources from the construction of more effective vessels. Britain also constructed some 36 midget submarines, with four-man crews, for attacks on shipping at anchor in harbor. Italian submarines were of four basic types: very large oceangoing cruiser submarines, large minelayers, large long-range patrol boats, and medium-size vessels. The cruisers, few in number, proved rather unsuccessful, especially as they were slow to dive; they saw little operational service. The minelayers, however, were much more successful. They displaced between 1,054 and 1,305 tons standard on the surface, with a range of 8,500 miles at 9 knots on the surface, a submerged endurance of 60 hours at 2 knots, and a diving depth of 330 feet. Armament included a battery of 6 to\n\nA WAR-WINNING WEAPON?\n\n8 torpedo tubes with 8 to 14 torpedoes, 36 mines, and one or two 3-inch deck guns. The two series of patrol submarines emerged as essentially standard designs immediately before World War II began. The larger group displaced between 920 and 1,000 tons standard on the surface, with a range of 9,000 miles at 8 knots on the surface, a submerged endurance of 60 hours at 2 knots, and a diving depth of 330 feet. Armament included a battery of 8 torpedo tubes with 12 torpedoes and one 4-inch deck gun. The smaller group displaced between 650 and 680 tons standard on the surface, with a range of 5,000 miles at 8 knots on the surface, a submerged endurance of 60 hours at 2 knots, and a diving depth of 330 feet. Armament included a battery of 6 torpedo tubes with 12 torpedoes and one 4-inch deck gun. These smaller patrol submarines were very successful boats, performing well in the shallow, clear waters of the Mediterranean; the larger boats performed quite effectively in the Atlantic. France constructed three series of submarines in the period between the wars: large, oceangoing, long-range vessels for worldwide service and for operation with the fleet; smaller boats for offensive patrols in European waters; and a successful group of minelayers. The 31 large submarines of the Redoutable class were generally regarded as very effective boats. They displaced 1,384 tons standard on the surface, with a maximum range of 10,000 miles at 10 knots on the surface and a submerged endurance of 60 hours at 2 knots. They had a battery of 11 torpedo tubes (seven of them in two remote-controlled, trainable external mounts), with a total of 13 torpedoes and a single 3.9-inch deck gun. The series of smaller patrol submarines began with 12 boats of the “600-tonne” type, followed by 30 of an improved “630-tonne” model, several of which were still incomplete when France fell in June of 1940. They had a range of 4,000 to 5,600 miles at 10 knots on the surface, an underwater endurance of 48 hours at 2 knots, and a safe operating depth of 330 feet. The torpedo battery comprised 9 tubes (three in an external, remote-controlled trainable mount) with a total of 9 torpedoes, plus a single 3.9-inch deck gun. The minelayers displaced 761 tons, could cruise for 7,000 miles at 10 knots on the surface, had a submerged endurance of 48 hours at 2 knots, and could safely operate to a depth of 250 feet. They carried 5 torpedo tubes (three in a trainable external mount) with 7 torpedoes, 32 mines, and a single 3-inch deck gun. The French Navy also operated the largest submarine in the world between the two world wars. The Surcouf was designed for\n\n29\n\n30\n\nSUBMARINES\n\nlong-range commerce war and displaced 2,880 tons standard on the surface, had a range of 10,000 miles at 10 knots on the surface and 60 hours at 2 knots submerged, and could operate safely at 250 feet. The S u r c o u f’s battery included no fewer than 12 tubes (eight in external mounts) with 22 torpedoes, two 8-inch guns in a special turret mounting, and a seaplane stowed in a hangar and launched with a catapult. The Surcouf was also equipped with a special compartment to accommodate prisoners taken from intercepted vessels and a small motor launch to transport boarding parties. The submarine proved to be successful in peacetime but never operated as designed during combat because of the fall of France and the boat’s subsequent loss in a collision. Soviet production of new submarines began in 1927. Clandestine cooperation with Germany gave Soviet engineers access to design data for German types from late World War I: minelayers, Type UBIII, and Mittel-U. The Soviets salved and recommissioned the sunken British submarine L-55, which gave them access to late-war British design information. Soviet designers also gained considerable data from rehabilitating the later czarist-era Bubnov-designed boats and the final examples of the ubiquitous Holland H-type submarines. Synthesizing this information permitted the Soviets to produce a wide variety of submarines on a large scale. There were two basic series of “M”-type coastal submarines, two basic medium submarine series—the “Shch” or Pike type of indigenous origin (though strongly influenced by British practice), and the later “S”-type derived from the same basic design as the German Type VII, minelayers of the “L”-type developed from the L-55, and long-range boats of the “K”-type. At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the Soviet Union deployed the world’s largest submarine force, with 168 boats in service. The final “M”-type displaced 283 tons surfaced, had a range of 4,500 miles at 8 knots on the surface or 36 hours at 3 knots submerged, could dive to 295 feet, and had a battery of 2 torpedo tubes with 4 torpedoes and a 45mm antiaircraft gun. The developed “S”-type displaced 856 tons surfaced, had a range of 9,500 miles at 9 knots on the surface or 45 hours at 3 knots submerged, could dive to 330 feet, and had a battery of 6 torpedo tubes with 12 torpedoes and a 4-inch deck gun. Their indigenous rivals displaced 587 tons, had a range of 3,650 miles at 7 knots or 50 hours at 2.5 knots submerged, could dive to 295 feet, and carried 6 torpedo tubes with 10 torpedoes. The minelayers displaced 1,108 tons, had a range of 10,000 miles at 8.6 knots or 60 hours at 2.5 knots submerged,\n\nA WAR-WINNING WEAPON?\n\ncould dive to 330 feet, and carried 8 torpedo tubes with 14 torpedoes and 20 mines. The “K”-type were very popular with their crews and were regarded as the best Soviet submarines of World War II. They displaced 1,480 tons, had a range of 15,000 miles at 9 knots or 50 hours at 2.5 knots submerged, could dive to 330 feet, and carried 10 torpedo tubes with 24 torpedoes. Despite this variety, the Soviet Union’s yards produced large numbers of submarines during World War II, completing some 200 boats during the course of the conflict.\n\nALLIED SUBMARINE OPERATIONS IN WORLD WAR II In most navies prior to World War II, the principal missions of submarines were offensive operations against enemy warships and reconnaissance. Britain, France, The Netherlands, and the United States, in particular, deployed many of their long-range boats in the Far East as counters to the powerful Imperial Japanese Navy concentrated there. A secondary task was campaigning against enemy merchant shipping, within the limits permitted by the Prize Regulations of the 1909 Declaration of London, which required ensuring the safety of ships’ crews. For the first year of the war, Allied submarines operated predominantly in their primary prewar roles, undertaking patrols in the North Sea, Atlantic, and Mediterranean to find and attack enemy warships, with generally limited success. They also undertook a campaign against the German merchant fleet’s attempt to return to its homeland, with mixed results. In September 1940, however, the Admiralty lifted almost all restrictions on submarine operations against enemy merchant shipping, setting the stage for a sustained campaign against German and Italian trade. Norwegian and Swedish ore traffic formed Germany’s most important European trade, and their protection became the principal focus of the navy’s trade protection efforts throughout the war. After the successful German invasion of Norway, the Kriegsmarine began convoying merchant shipping along the Norwegian coast from late in 1940. Convoys generally were small—three to six ships—escorted by a few torpedo boats, trawlers, and light craft. British submarines maintained a continuous effort against this trade for the remainder of the war, both by attacking convoys with torpedoes and by laying\n\n31\n\n32\n\nSUBMARINES\n\nextensive minefields along the various routes they followed. After the German assault on the Soviet Union, Soviet Northern Fleet submarines initiated attacks on German shipping in northern Norway, and they were soon joined by British submarines operating from Kola Bay. Joint operations continued until 1944, when the British crews were brought home and the submarines were passed to the Soviet Navy. This assault against the northern Norwegian convoys cost the Germans some 500,000 tons of shipping, a relatively negligible amount, considering that annual traffic was well in excess of 6 million tons. Soviet submarines also threatened the Swedish ore traffic. This shipping was encouraged to keep within Swedish territorial waters as far as possible, and was escorted for the final leg behind the protection of defensive minefields and net barriers. During 1942 and 1943, Soviet submarines succeeded in sinking only about twenty ships, totaling some 40,000 tons, out of more than 1,900 vessels in convoy representing well over 5.6 million tons of shipping. During 1944 the Soviet army’s advances and the defeat of Finland meant that aircraft played a greater role in antishipping operations, but, even so, German losses remained relatively light. The collapse of German positions on the Baltic coast early in 1945 required the evacuation by sea of more than 2 million troops and refugees. Despite some spectacular successes—the sinking of the liners Wilhelm Gustloff (with some 9,300 casualties), General Steuben (when only 300 survived of the 4,000 passengers embarked), and Goya (with but 183 survivors from among the more than 7,000 passengers and crew)—Soviet attacks were remarkably ineffective, the Germans losing only about thirty ships totaling some 100,000 tons. Overall, the Allied submarine campaign against German shipping was both relatively ineffective and costly (sixteen Allied and more than forty Soviet submarines were lost): it faced strong and effective countermeasures, especially very efficient radio direction finding and relatively powerful convoy escorts, and it was conducted in confined coastal waters that eased the defender’s task. When Italy entered the war in June 1940, British submarines, in conjunction with surface warships and aircraft, commenced an interdiction campaign against convoy traffic carrying supplies to Italian forces in Libya almost immediately. Italian convoys generally were small—three to six merchant vessels—with two or three escorting destroyers or torpedo boats. As British surface forces operating from Malta began attacking Libya-bound shipping, the Italian Navy had to deploy heavier covering forces, often including cruisers, to\n\nA WAR-WINNING WEAPON?\n\nsupport particularly valuable convoys. In this struggle over shipping, the British possessed two great advantages: radar, which vastly enhanced the night-attack capabilities of its aircraft and surface ships; and signals intelligence, which consistently gave them advance convoy routing information. Axis fortunes in this campaign fluctuated greatly. From mid-1941, Axis forces in North Africa required approximately 100,000 tons of supplies each month. In March 1942, for example, only 47,588 tons got through, whereas in April, 150,389 tons arrived. Overall, the Italian and German navies succeeded in bringing about 80 percent of all convoyed shipping in the Mediterranean through to its destination, losing two cruisers and seven destroyers to submarines in the process, while Axis antisubmarine forces and mines destroyed more than forty-five Allied submarines during the course of the campaign. By far the most successful Allied submarine campaign during World War II was that of the U.S. Navy’s boats in the Pacific against Japanese merchant shipping and warships. The effort got off to a mediocre start, not least because the early loss of the Philippines forced U.S. submarines to traverse long distances from either Hawai’ian or Australian bases to reach their targets. In addition, Australian bases initially lacked adequate facilities, U.S. torpedoes were highly unreliable and required major attention to correct their deficiencies, and fleet doctrine required submarines to prioritize their efforts against Japan’s major warships. It took time to fix these problems: bases in Australia were not adequately equipped until the fall of 1942; it was June 1943 before destroying Japan’s merchant fleet became a doctrinal priority; and the torpedo problem was not corrected until October of 1943. During this time, however, the Pacific Fleet was able to commission modern boats, upgrade existing vessels, and substantially improve the quality of its submarine commanders. Japan began the Pacific War with 6,150,000 tons of merchant shipping. New construction and captures added 832,000 tons during 1942. U.S. (and small numbers of British and Dutch) submarines sank 620,600 tons of Japan’s total merchant shipping losses of 1,065,000 tons during that year. During 1943, Japan added 878,000 tons of new merchant shipping to its fleet, but U.S. submarines alone sank 1,340,000 tons; another 441,000 tons were lost to other factors (air and surface attack and maritime hazards). Despite its direct experience of successful convoy operations by its destroyers in the Mediterranean during World War I, the Imperial Japanese Navy was very slow to introduce convoying of merchant\n\n33\n\n34\n\nSUBMARINES\n\nshipping after the Pacific War began. The navy possessed very few suitable escort vessels at the outbreak of the war, but that simply reflected the overwhelming emphasis it placed on planning for the decisive fleet action that was the centerpiece of its operational strategy. Japan’s response to the burgeoning unrestricted submarine campaign by the United States against its shipping was to increase aggressive surface and air patrols and to continue to eschew defensive convoy of its traffic. Not until the end of 1943, when its merchant fleet was being devastated by U.S. submarines, did the navy begin convoying shipping on a limited scale—especially the crucial tankers bringing fuel from the Dutch East Indies. The Pacific Fleet responded by introducing the wolf-pack tactics that had served German U-boats so well in the Atlantic. In particular, coordinated night attacks by surfaced submarines relying on guidance from sophisticated radar proved devastating. As a result, 1944 was a catastrophic year for Japan’s merchant fleet. Even though Japanese shipbuilders launched 1,735,000 tons of new merchant shipping, U.S. submarines sank 2,430,000 tons, and Japan lost a further 1,550,000 tons to other causes. Shortage of targets and a highly successful aerial mining campaign in Japanese home waters cut the successes of U.S. submarines during 1945 to 400,000 tons of shipping, but the net outcome of the campaign was to all but paralyze Japan’s maritime transportation system. Overall, U.S. submarines accounted for two-thirds of all of Japan’s losses of merchant ships, some 4.8 million tons, as well as one-third of its warship casualties. The price of this success was high. Despite the generally low level of effectiveness of Japanese antisubmarine measures, fifty submarines and 3,500 crewmen were lost during the campaign, a little more than one-fifth of all that undertook operational missions.\n\nAXIS SUBMARINE OPERATIONS IN WORLD WAR II The outbreak of World War II found the German submarine arm well trained but deficient in numbers. From the moment of its reestablishment, the submarine force had concentrated much of its effort on validating Kommodore Karl Dönitz’s concepts for an all-out assault on enemy trade using concentrated groups of submarines under central shore-based control to locate and destroy convoyed\n\nA WAR-WINNING WEAPON?\n\nshipping, primarily through surfaced night attacks (wolf-pack tactics). Dönitz was promoted Konteradmiral in October 1939, but shortages of U-boats, Adolf Hitler’s initial insistence on Germany’s adherence to the Prize Regulations, and demands on the submarine force for its support of surface naval operations prevented him from exploiting the potential of the wolf-pack tactics for most of the first nine months of the conflict. On average only six boats were at sea at any one time during this period, forcing them to attack individually, although some attempts were made to mount combined attacks whenever possible. As a result of its World War I experience after 1917, Britain was quick to begin the convoying of merchant vessels. There was some initial hesitation because of the feared detrimental effect that convoys could have on the efficient employment of shipping, but when the liner Athena was torpedoed and sunk without warning on 3 September 1939, Britain took this to indicate that Germany had commenced an unrestricted campaign of submarine warfare against merchant vessels. Regular east coast convoys between the Firth of Forth and the River Thames started on 6 September and outbound transatlantic convoys from Liverpool two days later. The conquest of Norway and the collapse of France in June 1940 brought substantial changes to the U-boat war against trade. From French bases, German reconnaissance and long-range bomber aircraft operated far into the Atlantic, while the operational range of the U-boats sailing from Norway and French Biscay ports increased dramatically. Italy’s simultaneous entry into the war terminated all commercial traffic in the Mediterranean except for very heavily escorted operational convoys bringing supplies into Malta. It also substantially increased the number of submarines available for the Atlantic campaign against shipping, inasmuch as Italian submarines began operating from Biscay ports, effectively doubling the total Axis force at sea. This situation allowed Dönitz to introduce his wolf-pack tactic on a large scale into the Atlantic shipping campaign, just as the British faced an alarming shortage of oceanic convoy escorts because of the neutralization of the French Fleet and their decision to retain destroyers in home waters to guard against a German invasion. The results vindicated Dönitz’s belief in the effectiveness of wolf packs. In the first nine months of the war, German U-boats sank a little more than 1 million tons of shipping, whereas they and the Italians together destroyed more than 2.3 million tons between June 1940 and February 1941. However, the release of destroyers from their guard duties, the addition of new escorts, and the transfer\n\n35\n\n36\n\nSUBMARINES\n\nof fifty obsolete destroyers from the U.S. Navy improved the situation. The dispersal point for westbound transatlantic convoys and the pickup point for escort groups meeting eastbound shipping gradually moved westward as the range of the escorts was increased. This pushed the main arena of Axis submarine operations more toward the mid-Atlantic zone, which reduced the time that boats could spend on station. In mid-1941 the United States imposed its socalled Neutrality Zone on the western Atlantic and began escorting British convoys in conjunction with Royal Canadian Navy escorts, operating from Argentia in Newfoundland. North Atlantic convoys now were escorted throughout by antisubmarine vessels. Nevertheless, these additions to the escort force had only a limited impact on losses, since German and Italian submarines succeeded in sinking a further 1.8 million tons in the following nine months prior to the U.S. entry into the war. The German declaration of war on the United States on 10 December 1941 brought a major westward expansion of U-boat operations against shipping. A disastrous period followed, while the U.S. Navy struggled with the problems of finding the escorts and crews required to convoy the enormous volume of merchant traffic along the East Coast of the United States, and with the very concept of convoy itself. Axis submarines sank more than 3 million tons of Allied shipping between December 1941 and June 1942, well over 75 percent of it along the East Coast of the United States and Canada. Nevertheless, by mid-1942 an elaborate and comprehensive system of interlocking convoy routes and sailings was established for the East Coast of North America and the Caribbean. As Dönitz became aware of the extension of convoy along the Atlantic East Coast, he shifted U-boat operations back to the midAtlantic. His all-out assault on the North Atlantic convoy systems i n flicted heavy losses: between July 1942 and March 1943, Axis (almost entirely German) submarines destroyed more than 4.5 millions tons of Allied shipping, over 633,000 tons in March alone. Nevertheless, new Allied countermeasures became available at this crucial moment, and U-boat successes fell to 287,137 tons in April, 237,182 tons in May, and only 76,090 tons in June. Dönitz’s reaction was to deploy his U-boats in areas where Allied antisubmarine forces were weak, anticipating that this would compensate for the lack of success in the North Atlantic. Initially this plan to some extent met his expectations, since sinkings rose to 237,777 tons in July, but the success of the Allied assault on U-boats in transit to their patrol stations rendered the German accomplishment\n\nA WAR-WINNING WEAPON?\n\ntransitory; merchant ship sinkings dropped to 92,443 tons in August, never to surpass 100,000 tons per month at any subsequent time during"
