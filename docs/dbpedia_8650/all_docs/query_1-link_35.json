        "text": "The Allies take possession of Casablanca on 8 November 1942. As the film was not due for release until spring, studio executives suggested it be changed to incorporate the invasion. Warner Bros. Entertainment chief Jack L. Warner objected, as he thought that an invasion was a subject worth a whole film, not just an epilogue, and that the main story of this film demanded a pre-invasion setting. Eventually he gave in, though, and producer Hal B. Wallis prepared to shoot an epilogue where Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains hear about the invasion. However, before Rains could travel to the studio for this, David O. Selznick (whose studio owned Bergman's contract) previewed the film and urged Warner to release it unaltered and as fast as possible. Warner agreed and the premiered in New York on November 26. It did not play in Los Angeles until its general release the following January, and hence competed against 1943 films for the Oscars. Share this trivia\n\nOf all the featured players in the film who get screen credit, only three were born in the United States: Humphrey Bogart, Dooley Wilson and Joy Page (the stepdaughter of studio head Jack L. Warner).\n\nIngrid Bergman's line \"Victor Laszlo is my husband, and was, even when I knew you in Paris\" was almost cut from the film because during that time it was deemed inappropriate for a film to depict or suggest a woman romancing with another man if she were already married. However, it was pointed out that later in the film she explains that she had thought Laszlo was dead at the time, and the censors allowed the line to stay in. Share this trivia\n\nThe difference in height between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman changes throughout the film. This is because Bergman was actually a few inches taller than Bogart, though to create the illusion that it was vice versa, Michael Curtiz had Bogart stand on boxes and sit on pillows in some shots, or had Bergman slouch down (as evident when she sits on the couch in the \"franc for your thoughts\" scene).\n\nThe entire picture was shot in the studio (Warner Bros. sound stage in Burbank, California), except for the sequence showing Major Strasser's arrival, which was filmed at Van Nuys Airport (just outside of Los Angeles), and a few short clips of stock footage views of Paris. The set for Rick's was built in three unconnected parts, so the internal layout of the building is indeterminate. In a number of scenes, the camera looks through a wall from the cafe area into Rick's office. The background of the final scene, which shows a Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior airplane with personnel walking around it, was staged using midget extras and a proportionate cardboard plane. Fog was used to mask the model's unconvincing appearance. Share this trivia\n\nBogart's signature line, \"Here's looking at you, kid!\" was originally in the script as \"Here's good luck to you, kid,\" until he changed it. His new line never appears in the script.\n\nThe most obvious goof or mistake in the film occurs as Rick is getting soaked in the rain at the Paris train station but when he actually boards the train his raincoat is dry.\n\nWhen Julius Epstein and Philip Epstein won Oscar for their script, they became the first (and as for 2007 the only) American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences winning twins.\n\nCasablanca 6 movie lines\n\nThank you, Carl. Thank you, Carl. Sit down. Have a brandy with us. To celebrate our leaving for America tomorrow. Thank you very much. I thought you would ask me, so I brought the good brandy and a third glass. At last the day's came! Frau Leuchtag and I are speaking nothing but English now. So we should feel at home when we get to America. A very nice idea. To America. To America. What watch? Ten watch. Such much? You will get along beautifully in America. How is lady luck treating you? Oh, too bad. You'll find him over there. Monsieur Rick? Yes? Could I speak to you, please? How'd you get in? You're underage. I came with Captain Renault. I should have known. My husband is with me too. He is? Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Have a drink? No, of course not. You mind if I do? Monsieur Rick, what kind of a man is Captain Renault? Like any other man, only more so. No, I mean is he trustworthy? Is his word? Just a minute. Who told you to ask me that? He did. Captain Renault did. I thought so. Where's your husband? At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visas. Oh, of course he's losing. How long have you been married? Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Things are very bad there. The devil has the people by the throat. So Jan and I, we. We do not want our children to grow up in such a country. So you decided to go to America. Yes. But we haven't much money and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us, and he is so kind, he wants to help us. Yes, I'll bet. He tells me he can give us an exit visa. But we have no money. Does he know that? Yes. And he's still willing to give you a visa? Yes. And you want to know? Will he keep his word? He always has. You are a man. If someone loved you very much so that your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the world and she did a bad thing to make certain of it could you forgive her? Nobody ever loved me that much. And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart that would be all right, wouldn't it? You want my advice? Yes, please. Go back to Bulgaria. Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America Oh, but if Jan should find out. He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is. Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me. Thank you, monsieur. Good evening. Good evening. You see? Here we are again. I take that as a great compliment to Sam. I suppose he means to you Paris of happier days. He does. Could we have a table close to him? And as far away from Major Strasser as possible. The geography may be a little difficult to arrange. Paul, table 30. Yes, sir. Right this way, if you please. I'll have Sam play As Time Goes By.\" I believe that's your favorite tune. Thank you. Two cognacs, please. Cognac. Do you wish to place another bet, sir? No. No, I guess not. Have you tried 22 tonight? I said 22. Leave it there. Cash it in and don't come back. Are you sure this place is honest? Honest? As honest as the day is long. How are we doing tonight? A couple of thousand less than I thought there would be. Monsieur Rick He's just a lucky guy. Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee? No, thanks, Carl. Monsieur Rick Captain Renault, may I? Not here. Come to my office in the morning. We'll do everything businesslike. We'll be there at 6. I'll be there at 10. I'm very happy for both of you. Still, it's very strange that you won. Well, maybe not so strange. I'll see you in the morning. Thank you, Captain Renault. No! Boss, you've done a beautiful thing. Go away, you crazy Russian. As I suspected. You're a rank sentimentalist. Yeah? Why? Why do you interfere with my little romances? Put it down as a gesture to love. Well, I'll forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blond. And it'll make me very happy if she loses. Mr. Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you. Go ahead. Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say. In my office. Right. You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I've been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands of people that I reach America and continue my work. I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloonkeeper. My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain. What of it? Isn't it strange you're always fighting on the side of the underdog? Yes, I found that a very expensive hobby. But then I never was much of a businessman. Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs? I appreciate it, but I don't accept it. 200,000 My friend, you could make it a million francs or three. My answer would still be the same. There must be some reason why you won't let me. There is. I suggest that you ask your wife. I beg your pardon? I said, ask your wife. My wife? Yes. Play La Marseillaise. Play it! See what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this demonstration what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once. But everybody's having a good time. Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed. But I have no excuse to close it. Find one. Everybody is to leave immediately. This cafe is closed until further notice. Clear the room at once. How can you close me up? I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here. Your winnings, sir. Thank you. Everybody out at once. After this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca. This morning you implied it wasn't safe to leave Casablanca. That is also true, except for one destination: occupied France. Occupied France? Under safe conduct from me. Of what value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past. There are two other alternatives for him. What are they? The French authorities may find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here. The other alternative? My dear, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca human life is cheap. Good night, mademoiselle. What happened with Rick? We'll discuss it later.\n\nWatch other parts of movie"
