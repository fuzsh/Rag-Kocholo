        "text": "There are certain moviegoing experiences I had in late 2019 that I hold very close to my heart. I remember the electric current I felt running through a Toronto International Film Festival screening of Uncut Gems, and how it sounded like a bomb went off in the audience when Adam Sandler finally reached his inevitable end. I remember seeing the then-much-debated Joker on opening night, which had already generated several waves of reaction and backlash before it had even opened. I remember an early morning screening of The Irishman, and a weekend matinee of Richard Jewell, and I remember having a good long laugh with my pal after seeing and hating Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker a few days before Christmas.\n\nThese movies varied in quality, but most of them felt plugged into the zeitgeist, and all of them felt like events. I saw them all with big audiences, and I talked about them over drinks with friends after. I thought about these experiences a lot during the long lockdown months, when new movies kept appearing and disappearing from the front page of Netflix and I didn’t really keep up. Was there something wrong with the movies, or with the streaming model itself? Am I more inclined to follow current cinema if it’s playing at a multiplex instead of competing for my attention with the entire history of the medium on my TV? Was there much passionate debate or excitement surrounding, say, Trial of the Chicago 7? Remind me, what was Mank?\n\nAs pandemic restrictions have lifted, I’ve become a regular moviegoer again. Things don’t yet feel back to normal – not just because half the seats are covered in police tape for social distancing, but also because almost nothing I’ve seen has come close to selling out. Every week, a new big-budget movie flops, although there are always reassurances that it would have done much better if there wasn’t a surge in COVID cases and if it hadn’t premiered simultaneously on HBO Max. I agree in principle that you should wear a mask indoors, but if you’re in a cavernous theatre with two other people, both 40 feet away, seeing The Protégé on a Tuesday night, then I think you can take it off. It doesn’t quite feel like I’m back in 2019 yet. Will it ever?\n\n*\n\nThe first new movie I saw in public since March 2020 was F9: The Fast Saga, and because Canada’s COVID recovery has been about two months behind that of the United States, I had to trek to the 5 Drive-In in Oakville, Ontario. One thing I noticed is that modern movies are not really meant to be seen at the drive-in. F9 has many dimly-lit scenes that are very hard to follow when seen via milky digital projection on an outdoor screen. Still, I’m not complaining. The 5 Drive-In has a pleasingly junky ‘50s aesthetic and cheap arcade games in the snack bar, and it was nice to be surrounded by people excited to see a movie. Frankly it was nice to do any activity after the long, gruelling lockdown. Plus, the movie is a piece of shit, so I was happy to chat with my sweetie or cuddle my dog whenever the screen became indecipherable.\n\nOnce you’ve seen a car fly from one skyscraper window through another (as happened in, I believe, Furious 7), the law of diminishing returns sets in. So, it’s hard to get excited when a car goes into space in F9. Clearly cars can do anything in this universe, so it’s not surprising when they do anything. While this rote and tired movie technically fulfills the franchise’s mandate of offering more more more, it also offers significantly less, because nowadays “the family,” like so many families, has factions that no longer speak to each other. Granted, I personally enjoy the awkward, monotonous presence of Vin Diesel more than the polished, oppressively charismatic Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, but it’s still a problem that the menu is getting smaller.\n\nI returned to the 5 Drive-In a few weeks later to check out Space Jam: A New Legacy. I have a lot of loyalty to Bugs, Daffy, and all their colleagues, so I wanted to support their first theatrical offering in 18 years. I shouldn’t have. When LeBron James first meets Bugs Bunny, Bugs is pining wistfully for his estranged friends like Daffy, Elmer, and Yosemite Sam, and it was here I realized that this “Bugs Bunny” was an imposter, because the real Bugs is not friends with these characters. Watching these prickly, eccentric characters standing side by side and grinning stupidly is like seeing loved ones resurrected as zombies.\n\nA New Legacy is an I.P. smorgasbord in the cursed lineage of The Lego Movie and Ready Player One, in which the Penguin, the Mask, Fred Flintstone, the Droogs, King Kong, and dozens of other WarnerMedia properties can be seen courtside at the climactic basketball game. The film imagines all these characters as living in the “Warner Bros. Serververse,” a vast computer database in which every property – the Looney Tunes, The Matrix, Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz, DC Comics – has its own planet where its fictional characters live. So, if you visit the DC planet, you will find yourself walking the streets of Gotham or Metropolis, and you might run into Batman or Superman. Presumably there is a Deconstructing Harry planet somewhere in the Serververse where you could drink scotch with Harry Block, or a Wheeler & Woolsey planet where you can hang out with the Diplomaniacs, although we don’t see them.\n\nThe plot involves the Serververse being taken over by its own sinister algorithm, embodied in the character of “Al G Rhythm,” played by a slumming Don Cheadle. Among his dastardly deeds, he has meddled with Planet Looney Tunes, breaking up the Tunes and sending them across the Serververse. We see a brutally unfunny montage of the characters hopping in and out of scenes from various Warner-owned movies: Elmer Fudd becomes Dr. Evil’s Mini-Me, Yosemite Sam replaces Sam the piano player, the Road Runner runs alongside Mad Max, etc. This montage raises logical questions about the Serververse that the movie is not prepared to answer, such as: If Yosemite Sam joins Planet Casablanca, does that mean he would suddenly become part of Casablanca if I watched it on HBO Max? With a few tweaks, this movie could have been a satire about how corporations flatten all their entertainment properties – each with its own unique history and context – into one big paste. But, of course, this film is a manifestation of that tendency, not a rebuke.\n\nThe film climaxes with Bugs Bunny heroically sacrificing himself so that all the other Looney Tunes may live. A few minutes after his death scene, he reappears alive and well, because he doesn’t control his destiny, WarnerMedia does. This is not subtext – this is the actual diegetic explanation for how Bugs Bunny survives. While The Lego Movie and Ready Player One at least paid lip service to the idea that intellectual property is a big toybox for you – yes, you! – to play in, the thesis of Space Jam: A New Legacy is that what really matters about cultural objects as disparate as Casablanca and Bugs Bunny is that WarnerMedia owns them.\n\n*\n\nMy return to indoor moviegoing was M. Night Shyamalan’s Old, which I saw with my sweetie at Toronto’s Varsity Cinema after dinner, just like old times. The high-concept premise of this pretty-good Twilight Zone episode involves a beach that causes its inhabitants age rapidly – a newborn baby can go from cradle to grave within a day or two, etc. The tone is feverish, the dialogue unnatural, the acting all over the place, and of course, there are twists – all sorts of reckless creative decisions that benefit from a 40-foot screen. Shyamalan is admirably unafraid to appear ridiculous, and I like that, after becoming a national laughingstock thanks to such films maudit as The Happening and Lady in the Water, he has staged a comeback by leaning into all the tendencies that people used to mock him for. On a personal note, I’ll just say that the premise of this movie resonated with me because I saw it toward the end of a six-month period in which my late mother endured the sudden, rapid progression of a terminal condition she had lived with for a little over 20 years. She passed away on September 1 at age 64, but within those last six months it felt like she had aged decades. Something Shyamalan understands is that there is nothing scarier than the loss of time.\n\nA few days later I went by myself on a lazy Sunday afternoon to see Pig at the Yonge-Dundas Cineplex. I had forgotten what it felt like to go see a movie on a whim because I had nothing else to do, and I had also forgotten that even seeing a movie on a whim feels like an event. I had to put on my shoes, get on the subway, and sit in an immersive environment for 92 minutes during which there was nothing to look at but the movie. I liked that feeling. Nicolas Cage, the king of direct-to-streaming schlock, is not who I expected to welcome me back to public moviegoing, but Pig, like Joe and Mandy, has arrived coded as one of his occasional “good” movies.\n\nI always like hearing Cage talk about acting – partly because he makes a lot of bizarre choices in both business and art that warrant explanation, but also because he cares a lot about his craft, speaks beautifully about his desire to bend/expand/challenge the discipline’s prevailing trends, and incorporates a lot of unusual ideas he draws from both film history and other art forms into his work. For example, he has spoken about wanting to break free from naturalism, taking ideas from silent film acting for some of his more outré performances. If I’ve felt frustrated with Cage in recent years, it’s because I sometimes feel that when he’s in any movie with loftier ambitions than a bad DTV thriller, he’s mostly called upon to provide fodder for a “NICOLAS CAGE FREAKS OUT!!!!” YouTube supercut. I enjoy watching Cage freak out, but I’d like to see him try other stuff too. So, I’m thankful for Pig, in which he gives an understated, internalized performance that is mostly communicated through body language and in which every small gesture matters. In a recent interview, he said that he drew inspiration from haiku: “With Japanese haiku, you have 5-7-5 syllables. [They] convey the space between. It’s evocative and those spaces become more meaningful than the words themselves. The way Michael wrote the script, I felt it would lend itself to the kind of film performance I wanted to get back to.” I love when Cage talks like this. What other actor is comparing their performance style to haiku?\n\nMovie stars carry a lot of baggage, and oftentimes you can trace the arc of their careers through the roles they play. I remember seeing Snowden at a packed Cheap Tuesday screening and the audience laughed when Cage showed up. I don’t think I fully understood until then the extent to which Cage (who a few years earlier was still starring in Jerry Bruckheimer movies) had become a joke, although clearly Oliver Stone did. If I remember correctly, Cage played an eccentric, truth-telling intelligence official who had been consigned to some dusty corner of the NSA building where he could be ignored. Stone knew he needed a forsaken man whom society had deemed too crazy – and possibly too brilliant – for the main room, and he chose Cage. Now in Pig he plays a master chef who reigned atop Portland’s fine-dining world before cutting himself off from society and retiring to the woods. Any similarity between this character and the Oscar-winning actor who starred in the 2014 remake of Left Behind is surely intentional.\n\nWhen you know how much Cage cares about his craft, it raises a lot of questions about why he makes so many tenth-rate movies. Yes, we know that he owed a huge debt to the taxman, but one thing that makes Cage’s interviews fascinating is that he will never admit to making movies solely for money. He talks about his decision to parlay his Oscar win for Leaving Las Vegas into a run of big-budget action movies as an experiment to see if an actor like him could create art in that context. More recently he has taken to calling himself “the California Klaus Kinski,” suggesting that he is drawn to exploitation films because they allow him to experiment in ways that studio movies cannot. Once he said that he likes to work a lot because when he’s not busy he becomes self-destructive. I wish he made better movies more often, but whatever the case, he should be admired for building a career that is indifferent to any narrative of how either an Oscar-winning actor or a box-office superstar should behave, whether that means making a low-budget action movie or working with Paul Schrader or Sion Sono. Pig has a scene that’s clearly intended to have extratextual significance: Cage shows up disheveled at Portland’s high-class restaurant du jour, which we learn is being run by a onetime employee of his. Cage reminds his former protégé that he once dreamed of opening an English-style pub. The younger man says that a pub was a bad business opportunity. Cage says: “You’re not real. You get that, right? None of this is real. The critics aren’t real. The customers aren’t real, because this isn’t real. You aren’t real. Why do you care about these people? They don’t care about you. None of them. They don’t even know you, because you haven’t shown them. Every day you’ll wake up and there’ll be less of you. You live your life for them, and they don’t even see you.”\n\n*\n\nJohn Huston famously said in Chinatown, “Of course I’m respectable. I’m old. Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores all get respectable if they last long enough.” This must be why I get excited whenever the latest chintzy-looking movie directed by a faded ’90s studio hack escapes a direct-to-video fate and surfaces at my local multiplex. I’m always hoping to see some Termite Art. “Did you see there’s a new Renny Harlin out?” I’ll say to my pal Justin, as if I were anticipating the modern equivalent of Fritz Lang delivering Beyond a Reasonable Doubt.\n\nAnyway, I made sure to see The Protégé, a recent piece of JohnWicksploitation with a cast and crew consisting of whoever agreed to make it because they needed something to do that month. The director is master journeyman Martin Campbell, whose long career runs the gamut from Casino Royale to Vertical Limit, and the star, somehow, in the year 2021, is Maggie Q. She is supported by Samuel L. Jackson (good guy) and Michael Keaton (bad guy), both giving shticky performances that are shamelessly derivative of their earlier, better work. Jackson at one point delivers a Fauxrantino monologue about goodness, badness, and evil. Keaton, meanwhile, goes Full Keaton – pursing his lips, darting his eyes, arching his eyebrows, and generally being very busy whenever he’s onscreen. He is meant to be devilishly charming, but looks very old, and certain of his scenes with Maggie Q answer the question, “What if Out of Sight starred two people with no chemistry?” The film contains one, maybe two okay fight scenes and a lot of dead space.\n\nOne filmmaker who has risen like a phoenix from the direct-to-video ashes is Paul Schrader, whose First Reformed miraculously returned him to the first rank of American directors. His two films before that were both direct-to-video thrillers starring Nicolas Cage. In his interviews and Facebook posts, Schrader has been brutally candid about the logic behind his career decisions, and it seems to me that such late works as The Canyons and Dog Eat Dog were essentially part of an extended piece of performance art on the theme of “How can a filmmaker like me adapt to the current marketplace?” Lately he has cracked the code: if he keeps to a certain budget and gets a certain quota of movie stars onboard, he can make Paul Schrader movies again. For example, The Card Counter opens with a man writing a diary in a near-empty room and ends with the Pickpocket ending – all that good stuff you like and look forward to from our Uncle Paul.\n\nOscar Isaac plays the man – a card shark who travels from casino to casino placing safe bets and winning small but reliable scores. If Schrader’s old pal Martin Scorsese (one of the film’s many executive producers) made a film about gambling, I think he would probably be drawn to the excitement/catharsis/adrenaline rush of winning and/or losing. Schrader is interested in the state of wearing a poker face, which here becomes a metaphor for the ways we cope with or compartmentalize our sins and traumas. As with First Reformed, The Card Counter’s digital cinematography is cold and un-pretty, matching the affectless demeanor of its central character. Its scenes are evenly divided between ugly casinos and ugly hotels. Stylistically, it jolts to life only during the flashbacks to its central character’s time as an America soldier at Abu Ghraib – loud, hideous scenes depicted through long takes and distorted lenses. Isaac’s character was in the famous photographs torturing prisoners, for which he served eight years in jail. Willem Dafoe plays the architect of Abu Ghraib’s detainment program, who is now a prestigious member of society delivering lectures on “enhanced interrogation” at industry conferences. In both his fallow period and his current renaissance, Schrader gets a lot of points from me for being the only person from the ‘70s New Hollywood crew who’s still consistently trying to make films for and about the present moment."
