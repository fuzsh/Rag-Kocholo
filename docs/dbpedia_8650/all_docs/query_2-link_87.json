        "text": "Kasbah Films is a Production Service Company based in Morocco. It was founded in 2005 by Karim Debbagh and is today the most successful player in the country with the highest turnover and the best results on the Moroccan Cash Rebate incentive.\n\nKasbah Films not only excels in the production of artistically ambitious films like Cherry by the Russo Brothers, or Terrence Malick latest film The Way of the Wind, but also on studio-backed projects like the massively big television series Wheel of Time, or the Men In Black franchise.\n\nIn the meantime, German fellow Michael Dreher has joined Karim Debbagh in the management team and so Kasbah Films always has the possibility to supervise several projects at the same time.\n\nBoth have been trained at prestigious European Film Schools and have gained experience on countless productions, learning how to keep costs down and add high production values at all budget levels. Michael: „We begin our collaborations by understanding your creative requirements – which enables us to assist in streamlining your production and cut unnecessary costs.“ Karim adds: „Our international backgrounds help significantly to manage cultural differences, integrating local crew with their foreign heads of department.“\n\nWe have unparalleled local knowledge and expertise. We are hands-on passionate filmmakers ourselves. We run an ethical business and are fully transparent.\n\nJOE RUSSO\n\nDIRECTOR AND PRODUCER @ AGBO\n\nAvengers: Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War, The Gray Man\n\nOne of AGBO's very first projects was MOSUL, written and directed by Matt Carnahan, shot entirely in Morocco, and excellently supervised by KASBAH FILMS. The collaboration with MICHAEL and KARIM was incredible and delivered outstanding results for our director and our film. When we had the opportunity to go back to the Kasbah team a couple years later with CHERRY, we jumped at the chance. Without a doubt we could not have pulled off what we did in those sequences without Kasbah at our side. They and their team are amazing and have consistently delivered unique locations, a strong crew and the best Morocco has to offer. We look forward to our next collaboration with them!\n\nRAFE JUDKINS\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER / SHOWRUNNER\n\nUncharted, Wheel Of Time\n\nOn WHEEL OF TIME, we’re always pushing to show the audience things they’ve never seen before. This season, when we went to Dakhla in the far south of Morocco, I was blown away by the lagoon there, but skeptical if anyone could actually pull of shooting there. Thanks to KASBAH FILMS, and the local support, things went very well, and we achieved our goal of putting something on film that no one’s ever done before.\n\nSANAA HAMRI\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER / DIRECTOR\n\nEmpire, Shameless, Nashville\n\nIt was truly a pleasure and an experience of a lifetime! It is a filmmaker’s dream to be able to shoot in beautiful locations with amazing people. The care and the love in the work showed tremendously and we are all so grateful. Thanks to everybody at KASBAH FILMS for collaborating with us and being such a team player. Many thanks to all! Allah y ateekoom saha!!\n\nE. BENNETT WALSH\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER\n\nThe Great Wall, Kill Bill, Robin Hood\n\nAfter fifty days in London, we've arrived to Marrakech over the weekend and started to shoot right away with 1st and 2nd units on both ends of town as well as throughout the country. Thanks to KARIM and MICHAEL’s crew, all locations for MEN IN BLACK: INTERNATIONAL were superbly prepared prior to our arrival, so there were no minimal issues. Also their accounting team proved to be excellent, as we’ve received the maximum amount from the Moroccan Rebate which was in the early stages of being rolled out. It would be great teaming up with them again!\n\nPATRICK NEWALL\n\nPRODUCER, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER\n\nThe Gray Man, Extraction 2, Electric State\n\nMOSUL has been my second film with KARIM and MICHAEL. It was also my first time with AGBO, so I have very fund memories of this project. We were shooting an ambitious war film in Marrakech, all Arab language and the Director MATT CARNAHAN was very keen on getting all details right. Kasbah managed to excel on every level of the production: they got us spectacular locations, incredible support from the Moroccan Army, and did a stellar job on the Moroccan Cash Rebate which has just been established. I came back to work with them a year later on CHERRY, and I have to say that we’ve truly become friends over these seven years that we’ve known each other.\n\nMICHELLE MACLAREN\n\nEP & DIRECTOR\n\nBreaking Bad, The Morning Show, Shining Girls\n\nKASBAH FILMS is an exceptional team in every way. We had a spectacular shoot in beautiful, challenging, remote locations that Kasbah made possible. We shot with helicopters, drones, unusual vehicles with large groups of people and the production not only ran smoothly but everyone was an absolute joy to work with. I am grateful to KASBAH FILMS for making our shoot in Morocco such a successful experience!\n\nBrad Anderson\n\nDirector\n\nThe Machinist, The Wire, Boardwalk Empire\n\nKarim and Michael were absolutely essential for helping me get my film produced in Tangier. They are the best show in town by far, seem to know EVERYBODY worth knowing, and assisted us in all departments, making our shoot a huge success for all involved. Would work with them again in a heartbeat!\n\nPeter McAleese\n\nProducer\n\nUnknown, Bridget Jones, The Gunman\n\nI had the great pleasure to work with Karim Debbagh as the Moroccan Line Producer on \"The Red Tent\". It was a difficult and extremely ambitious show which carried the weight of huge expectations from both the Broadcasters and the International Studio which financed it. Karim always proved himself to be totally professional in terms of his commitment to carrying out his responsibilities. Together with Michael Dreher he runs their company Kasbah Films with an enviable combination of good humour and steely resolve in a way which completely delivers on the honesty and transparency expected of any outfit seeking to compete in today's very competitive International Marketplace. Karim and Michael's joint contribution to the successful execution of \"The Red Tent\" was enormous.\n\nSteve Saeta\n\nProducer\n\nHitman: Agent 47, Spider-Man, The Island\n\nFor years I heard of only two production service companies in Morocco and was surprised to find Kasbah, who came highly recommended. The other companies were not as receptive as I had expected while Kasbah was hungry for the opportunity. I have always been a believer in finding new talent; neither Karim nor Michael ever disappointed me. In fact they exceeded my expectation. Whatever was needed, however we needed to proceed, they were there to persevere, both willing and able. I never doubted their veracity and ultimately had great trust and respect for both of them. I hope to return to Morocco so we may continue the collaboration\n\nMarcus Loges\n\nLine Producer\n\nCloud Atlas, The Cut, A Hologram for the King\n\nWhether you're shooting with A-list talent in rural areas or in the uncontrollable chaos of a city like Casablanca, you absolutely need a local production services company, who understands the big picture in order to make it happen. Karim, Michael and their team from Kasbah Films allowed us to make the best possible version of our film \"A Hologram for the King\", and ensured we had a great time doing it!"
