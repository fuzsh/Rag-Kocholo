        "text": "Exactly 72 years ago, on 27 November 1942, a film premiered in New York City: Casablanca, starring Humphrey Bogart (an American) and Ingrid Bergman (a Swede), Paul Henreid (an Austrian) and Claude Rains (a Brit). It was directed by Michael Curtiz (a Hungarian).\n\nCasablanca is arguably the most loved Hollywood film of all time. Though not a superhit by any standards when it was released, its fame and following grew over the years and just kept growing. By 1977, it was the most frequently broadcast film on American television. In fact, it was said (only half in jest) that whenever a television programming executive had a problem about filling up some empty time on his channel, all he had to do was to show Casablanca and the TRPs would be taken care of. In the early 80s, it was claimed that the film was on some US TV channel or the other every day of the year!\n\nHarvard University has a more-than-50-year-old tradition of screening Casablanca during the week of the final examinations. The film consistently makes it into most lists of “greatest movies ever made”, even though it is hardly a great example of cinematic technique. It is also choc-a-bloc with ‘goofs’—there are countless continuity errors, like wet overcoats magically becoming dry between cuts, and objects mysteriously shifting position from shot to shot; there are many scenes where lip movement and sound are not synchronized; the finger movements of the pianist Sam (a major character) never match the music we hear; even the difference in height between Bogart and Bergman keeps changing from scene to scene. The actors ham it up all through. And almost everyone in the film speaks a bit faster than normal human beings usually do, because director Curtiz wanted to ‘speed up the action’.\n\nNeither the studio Warner Brothers, nor producer Hal Wallis, nor Curtiz set out to make a classic when they decided to make a film from an as-yet-unproduced play called Everybody Comes to Rick’s. The play landed, like hundreds of plays at that time did, in the story department of Warner Brothers, and the executive who read it, passed it upwards with the—admiring!—comment that it was ‘sophisticated hokum’!\n\nTiming also played a crucial role. The US had entered World War II just a week ago, and Hollywood studios—opportunism being part of their DNA—were looking for stories set during the war. Casablanca was shot hurriedly (and it shows in the film); in fact, it was shot in sequence—which was and is rare in Hollywood—because the screenplay was being written even as shooting progressed. One of the most famous lines of dialogue in cinema history—“Here’s looking at you, kid”—was improvised by Bogart on the sets.\n\nAnd the makers of the film could not agree on the ending till almost the day the last sequence was to be shot.\n\nShooting over, the film was hastily edited since it was set in Morocco, and an American military campaign in North Africa seemed imminent. Curtiz made it just in time. Casablanca premiered two weeks after the first American troops landed in Africa. In fact, in Morocco.\n\nFor the benefit of those who haven’t seen the film, here’s the story (adapted from the Plot Synopsis on imdb.com). In the early years of World War II, the Moroccan coastal city of Casablanca attracts people from all over the world, particularly Nazi-occupied Europe. Many are transients trying to get out of Europe; a few are just trying to make a buck. Most of them—gamblers and refugees, Nazis, resistance fighters, and plain old crooks—find their way to Rick’s Café Américain, a nightclub owned by American expatriate Rick Blaine (Bogart), an embittered and cynical man who claims his motto is “I stick my neck out for nobody.”\n\nBy sheer chance, Rick comes into possession of two letters of transit that allow the bearers to travel freely around German-controlled Europe, including to neutral Portugal, from where it’s relatively easy to get to the US. These documents are almost priceless to any of the refugees stranded in Casablanca.\n\nThen the reason for Rick’s bitterness re-enters his life. Ilsa Lund (Bergman) arrives with her husband Victor Laszlo (Henreid), a renowned Czech Resistance leader whom the Nazis want to get their hands on, to purchase the letters. Rick and Ilsa had been lovers and the relationship had ended (Fate plays a part here. Ilsa cannot be blamed, but Rick doesn’t know this) in heartbreak for Rick, who feels betrayed by Ilsa.\n\nRick and Ilsa now brood constantly and torment themselves by asking the club’s piano player, Sam, to repeatedly play As Time Goes By, a song they loved when they were together. Rick refuses to give her the papers, even when she pulls a gun on him. She is unable to shoot, confessing that she still loves him. Rick decides to help Laszlo, and she decides to stay behind when Laszlo leaves. All this is of course extremely dangerous since Casablanca is crawling with vicious Nazi soldiers with whom the amoral French commander Captain Renault (Rains), nominally in charge of the city, is collaborating.\n\nMany exciting things happen, including narrow escapes and double crosses, and when all seems lost, Rick engineers Ilsa and Laszlo’s getaway, giving her the letters of transit, and almost forcing her onto the plane (this is supreme sacrifice, in case you haven’t got it). The last sequence has two more of the most famous lines in film history: “Round up the usual suspects”, and “I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.” (Rick says this to Renault)\n\nPretty basic stuff, really. And clichéd like hell (more about clichés later). Yet, the late Roger Ebert, perhaps the finest film critic of all time, wrote: “Casablanca is an experience that for many us was as real as anything else that has happened in our lives.”\n\nIt will also be relevant here to mention that director Curtiz’s hold over the English language was, well, tenuous. While shooting the film, he asked his crew to get him a “poodle” for the next shot. After hours of running around, the crew located and brought in a poodle. Curtiz flew into a rage, shouting that all he had asked for was “a poodle of water”. Curtiz has also been given a bit more space in film history by the late actor David Niven, the second volume of whose (extraordinarily entertaining) autobiography is titled Bring On The Empty Horses. This is what Curtiz once ordered while directing The Charge of the Light Brigade—he wanted some riderless horses.\n\nCasablanca has been subjected to structural and semiotic analysis on a massive scale, and has possibly generated more PhD theses than any other movie (barring the Star Wars films, I suppose). The redoubtable scholar Umberto Eco also got into the act at some point, with a typically complex yet fascinating explanation.\n\nAfter much postulation about myths and archetypes and aesthetics and so on, he reaches the conclusion: “Casablanca is not just one film. It is many films, an anthology. Made haphazardly, it possibly made itself, if not actually against the will of its authors and actors, then at least beyond their control. And this is the reason it works, in spite of aesthetic theories and theories of film making. For in it there unfolds with almost telluric force the power of Narrative in its natural state, without Art intervening to discipline it…When all the archetypes burst in shamelessly, we reach Homeric depths. Two cliches make us laugh. A hundred clichés move us. For we sense dimly that the clichés are talking among themselves, and celebrating a reunion…(The) height of banality allows us to catch a glimpse of the sublime.”\n\nWhat I can make out of this (I have always meant to check up what ‘telluric’ means, but never got around to doing it) is: The film tells a rousing story, with character types and emotional conflicts that are familiar to us and which we can empathise with.\n\nThat’s no big mystery. What more could we want from a film?"
