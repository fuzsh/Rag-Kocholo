        "text": "DELICIOUS MEXICAN & SEAFOOD CUISINE\n\nOver 40 years ago, Casablanca introduced a new type of Mexican cuisine to the Venice community. Our menu contains many of the traditional Mexican entrées but also lesser known Mexican cuisine including one of our specialties, the Calamari steak, which is pounded into a filet and served with your choice of sauces\n\nHOMEMADE FLOUR TORTILLAS\n\nCasablanca Restaurant is renowned for its world famous flour tortillas. Everyday, guests can watch as our tortilla artists make delicious flour tortillas, which are then brought to your table piping hot. Enjoy the tortillas with our special green salsa made with avocado, cilantro and cheese.\n\nNEARBY ATTRACTIONS\n\nCasablanca Restaurant is less than a mile away from Venice Beach Boardwalk. Casablanca Restaurant is the perfect place to have lunch before you take a stroll on the beach or to have a romantic dinner after enjoying a beautiful day in the California sun.\n\nHISTORY\n\nA deep love for Hollywood movies and Mexican food inspired Carlos Haro, Sr. to open Casablanca Restaurant in 1980. Casablanca Restaurant became a one-of-a-kind themed restaurant combining fine Mexican cuisine with the 1943 Academy Award winning movie, Casablanca, featuring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.\n\nThe next generation, Carlos Haro, Jr., continues to provide excellent cuisine while introducing unique new entrées. While committed to providing each customer with a memorable dining experience, Carlos Haro, Jr. is sharing his passion for writing novels, which incorporate Mexican folklore, cuisine and music."
