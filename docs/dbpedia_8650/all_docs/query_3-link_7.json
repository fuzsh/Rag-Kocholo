        "text": "Compare how far your chosen films reflect their different production contexts\n\nCasablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) follows Rick, an owner of a cafe during World War II where refugees go to seek escape to America, as his former lover Ilsa returns with her husband. The film was made between 1930-1960, a time now known as the Classical Hollywood period, and has since become the staple film for Classical Hollywood stylistic elements. During this period, the big five and little three film studios dominated cinema with MGM, Warner Bros, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox and RKO working through the process of vertical integration enabling them to control all the stages of the supply chain thus maximising their profits. Casablanca is a Warner Bros production known for their big screen realism and glamorisation of everyday lives thus contextualising the exploration of America’s position in World War Two. “The Big Three” created and managed movie stars by contracts directly linked to their studio.\n\nThings changed in the late 1950s as audiences lost the desire for idealism instead opting for realism. Additionally, a 1948 supreme court case prohibiting studios from owning cinemas gave power and opportunity to new independent filmmakers who began challenging the Classical Hollywood model thus cumulating in a new movement, now known as the “New Hollywood” era, from 1961-1990.\n\nThe post-World War Two world created a sentiment of break from tradition as french film critics began criticising the lack of artistic freedom, innovation and opportunity in Hollywood; these critics began making their own films under a movement called the French New Wave. Arthur Penn took inspiration from this movement to collaborate with Warner Bros and direct the breakout film Bonnie and Clyde (Arthur Penn, 1967). The film, based on a true story, followed Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, a famous criminal couple during the 1930s Great Depression, through their lives of robbery and media stardom. Bonnie and Clyde was extremely popular at the time of its release for its innovative presentation of themes and styles never explored during the Classical Hollywood era.\n\nCasablanca is highly reflected of techniques used by studios at the time. Cinematography is used to perfectly and deliberately frame characters and locations to maximise the information we are given. As Major Strasser arrives in Casablanca, a one-take shot beginning as a two shot of him meeting Captain Renault becomes a three shot then four the five shot as he, and the audience, is introduced to more characters. This is reflective of the studio context as the use of strict and organised staging in scenes is enabled by the on-set shooting of the film allowing crew to manipulate the location to best suit the actors, lighting and props.\n\nAt the beginning of Bonnie and Clyde, intimate hand-held shots for realism, contrasting Casablanca’s use of tripods for idealism, tracking Bonnie around her room are used to give the film the feel of documentary footage as it is portraying a true story. The framing of shots is also much less formal than in Casablanca with characters being framed off-centre and the camera movements appearing less structured or uniform symbolising the break from tradition catalysed by the French New Wave.\n\nThe first time we see Rick is over nine minutes into the film, he is introduced through a close-up of his hands as he plays chess, holding a cheque. The shot then tilts up to reveal Rick who is lit by noir lighting that focuses on contrasting shadow and light, a staple lighting technique used by Warner Brothers’. Humphrey Bogart’s character is regularly shown in half-light perhaps to represent his divided self and Ilsa is shown with soft lighting, a gauze filter and catch lights to make her eyes sparkle and add a sense of tenderness to her character. The institutional contexts explain these lighting choices as Warner Bros’ star system and unbreakable contracts resulted in them selling their films on their actors by presenting them as glamorous. However, the characters are also important to symbolising wider political contexts of the time; Rick embodies the USA’s reluctance to enter the war as he battles with what extent to get involved initially remaining neutral and self-serving before sacrificing that to become a crucial part of the action.\n\nThe lighting throughout Bonnie and Clyde is much more naturalistic with the majority of the film taking place outside and reflecting the natural environment. Bonnie, unlike Rick, is introduced in the first shot of the film being a close-up of her lips; this also introduces Bonnie’s free sexuality contrasting the conservative approach taken in Casablanca as well as incorporating the French New Wave technique of not opening films with a traditional establishing shot. The naturalistic style used in Bonnie and Clyde brings the audience closer to the characters who are the driving force in the film; when considering the social contexts, the film targeted the baby boomer generation born after World War 2 by appealing to their rebellious anti-establishment sentiment.\n\nCasablanca and Bonnie and Clyde also take very different approaches to sound design. The sound mix inside of Rick’s Cafe includes low diegetic background music played by Sam and other background noise very low in the mix; however, what takes dominance of the mix is the dialogue thus highlighting the characters speech as the most important thing in the film. In Bonnie and Clyde, the consistent use of random diegetic sounds as Bonnie and Clyde walk through the streets after meeting for the first time presents a sense of verisimilitude. Bonnie and Clyde’s naturalistic sound design is a reflection of the on-location shooting whereas Casablanca’s artificially created sound is a product of it being filmed on-set in the Warner Bros studio due to the rules of the studio system.\n\nThe differences in the mise-en-scene of both films is reflective of the contexts of the time they were produced. The introductory sequence of Bonnie and Clyde is ostensibly used to show the younger years of their lives but their main purpose is to ground the narrative in the setting of the 1930s Great Depression through the authentic industrial locations and dull colours presented in the photographs. The on-location setting for the rest of the film continues this reference to the films contexts whilst Casablanca’s on-set production means the constructed sets were used to fit camera movements, lighting and character positioning thus making the overall mise-en-scene appears much more glamorous, rich and organised compared to Bonnie and Clyde’s naturalistic and deprived environment.\n\nCasablanca sticks to the traditional Classical Hollywood presentation of characters; intertextuality is subtly used through Bogart’s costume in Casablanca strongly resembling his well-known attire from the film The Maltese Falcon (John Huston, 1941) in which he played a detective. His long coat and formal hat are recognisable to Classical contemporary audiences and furthers the film’s use of film noir.\n\nIn Bonnie and Clyde, costumes and character presentation is used to deviate from the norm. In the first sequence, Bonnie is completely naked reflecting the exploration of relaxed morals characterised by the French New Wave. The costumes throughout are casual and unhinged (tie uneven etc) contrasting Casablanca’s costume design of smart well put together outfits perhaps reflecting a divide between the poverty of the Great Depression and the elite at Rick’s bar as well as the frequent glamorisation of reality in films from the Classical Hollywood period vs the naturalistic presentation of reality evident in films from the “New Hollywood” period.\n\nFurthermore, Bonnie and Clyde’s relaxation of morals is evident implicitly in the overt phallic imagery when the characters hang out at a petrol station and drink from coca-cola bottles, and when Bonnie strokes Clyde’s gun, and explicitly in the exploration of Clyde’s sexual incompetence. The bloody depiction of violence was also innovative as the Hayes Code of the 1940s had previously restricted the barriers of content; the visceral and real presentation of violence is a reflection of the political and social contexts of the 1960s, a decade characterised by violent events like the Vietnam War and the assassinations of Dr Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. The use of graphic violence not only reflects the innovative techniques of the French New Wave but also reflects the mood of pessimism after a summer of riots and rising death-toll in the war; contrastingly, the glamorisation of America going to war in Casablanca is used to calm public attitudes towards war and create a sentiment of unity and patriotism going into the conflict.\n\nThe use of montage at the beginning of Casablanca is used for exposition with maps, real footage and other contextualising images providing information whilst showcasing Warner Bros’ studio budget.\n\nThe opening of Bonnie and Clyde simplistically edits a series of photos increasing in pace to introduce the audience to the fast pace of the film rather than the monologued description of the political situation as used in Casablanca.\n\nThroughout Bonnie and Clyde, there is varying pace and discontinuity editing conveying the unpredictability of new French New Wave techniques.\n\nCasablanca, on the other hand, reflects the clear patterns and seamless narratives of Warner Brothers’ studio productions at the time. These patterns are evident in the use of invisible cuts and continuity editing such as when, in the beginning of the film, an officer over a speaker says “round-up the usual suspects” and the next shot cuts to the officers rounding up the suspects in the busy town street.\n\nIn terms of performances, the Warner Brothers’ contracted actors in the studio system, cause the characters in Casablanca to speak with the same vaguely foreign accent despite representing different nationalities: as an audience, we are given the Anglicised version. In Casablanca, the characters dialogue is performed theatrically, they speak one at a time and stick to the script word-for-word. The tame language is explained by the institutional context as the Production Code from 1934-1954 set moral guidelines that had to be strictly followed by films to prevent the government banning or censoring them.\n\nIn Bonnie and Clyde dialogue is delivered much more naturally with characters speaking over one another and abbreviating. At the time of Bonnie and Clyde’s release, the Production Code was seen as increasingly outdated and was even disbanded in 1968, a year after the film’s release, thus contextualising the exploration of relaxed morals in the dialogue of Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nCasablanca’s representation of diverse cultures and races in Rick’s Cafe, is used to emphasise Rick’s middle ground stance during the war as well as his civility towards everyone. It is also a reflection of the political contexts of the film as Casablanca was a French Colony that was a holding place for refugees escaping Nazi rule during World War 2 whilst waiting for exit visas to Lisbon in Portugal. Furthermore, racial representation is evident in the focal black character, Sam, being cast in a speaking role.\n\nGender representation differs between the films. In Casablanca, Ilsa, despite having a lead speaking role, tends to be subservient to the decisions of both Rick and Victor who ultimately decide her future by the end of the film. It also clear that her beauty is the main focus of her character with lighting and cinematography being deliberately manipulated to showcase her beauty; the focus on female beauty is a reflection of the aesthetics and glamorisation of the Classical Hollywood era.\n\nAt the beginning of Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie is seen in her bedroom. She lays behind the bars on her bed, representing her entrapment, and hits her head repeatedly thus reflecting her frustration with her position in society. Oppositely, the first time we see Clyde he is outside in the world. The presentation of women in the domestic sphere and men in the external world sets up the gender norms of the time period before the film goes on to challenge and disprove these norms as Bonnie has more power sexually, displayed through her nakedness and sensual close-ups, compared to Clyde’s sexual incompetence. Whilst in both Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde the leading protagonists are a male and female character, in Bonnie and Clyde they are represented equally whereas in Casablanca, Ilsa is clearly represented as inferior and less capable than Rick.\n\nThe aesthetics of both films are also very different aesthetically. The most obvious differentiation is the aspect ratios; Casablanca is displayed in the aspect ratio 1.37:1 (almost square) to deliberately and perfectly frame the characters and their surroundings whereas Bonnie and Clyde has the aspect ratio 1.85:1 allowing more diverse shot types.\n\nIn conclusion, Bonnie and Clyde was prominent at its time for the never before seen relaxation of sexuality and freedom and the use of visual violence; however, the themes are not as shocking or provocative to modern audiences and therefore the film has not achieved the same prominence in modern-day as Casablanca. Bonnie and Clyde was highly influenced by the innovative influences of the French New Wave; whilst the techniques, themes and influences of the French New Wave have maintained dominance in modern filmmaking more so than what we see as the Classical Hollywood style, Bonnie and Clyde as a film has not. Casablanca, whilst still prominent at its time for appealing to social contexts by displayed storylines “torn from today’s headlines” in true Warner Brothers style, is more prominent and remembered in modern day as it perfectly encapsulates the 1930-1960 film style unfamiliar to audiences now. Even so, both films are appreciated for their portrayal of universal themes like sacrifice, love, friendship and camaraderie prominent no matter how much time passes."
