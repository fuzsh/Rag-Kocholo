        "text": "Write an exam style answer.\n\n•Consult the course Overview.\n\n•Read through the Component 1a section of this website.\n\n•Plan your response carefully.\n\n•Format your blog post with the following distinct sections:\n\n1.Question (copied carefully from below)\n\n2.Planning (bullet points or a mind map)\n\n3.Version 1 (carefully proof-read)\n\n4.Version 2 (for later use)\n\n•Answer the following question from the Sample Assessment Materials:\n\nCompare how far your chosen films reflect the auteur signature features of their filmmakers\n\nIntroduction: what are the films’ differences in how they reflect auteurship. Casablanca produced in The Golden Age of Hollywood: lack of director freedom, vertical integration – in-house expenses. Bonnie and Clyde was made during The New Hollywood Era: Arthur Penn had more creative freedom to have a French New Wave style. Casablanca has little control/freedom, Bonnie and Clyde has narrative and technological freedom\n\nDifferences:\n\n-Signature style – Warner Bros.’s style in the war was pro-American intervention. Institutions became auteurs due to their unique and recognisable styles – directors had little or no auteurship – limited creative freedom. Warner Bros.’s house style is present throughout the film. Warner brothers logo is shown which is an auteur feature. Jack Warner used real news footage in the opening sequence, and in the Paris sequence to show an audience this was real, and not just part of the film. Bonnie and Clyde features depictions of the Depression, but the issue had passed, so the filmmakers are not trying to convey a message. Arthur Penn had no consistent style, because he had creative freedom to make whatever films he wanted.\n\nFrench influence: Bonnie and Clyde took inspiration from The French New Wave. Realist themes. Opening sequence analysis. Closing sequence makes visual reference to Breathless (Jean-Luc Godard, 1960) – a famous French film in the French New Wave style. Michel Pioccard’s glasses lens came out, before meeting an untimely death, like Clyde does\n\nCasablanca: large, exotic sets, intricate details, hundreds of extras, large budget shown off – signature of Warner Bros. style\n\nBonnie and Clyde: shot on-location, extras are locals, smaller budget, no grand spectacles, sets are minimalist – signature of the French New Wave Style\n\nTV: television effected the popularity of cinema. In the Golden Age, few TVs were sold, and new channels were broadcast in the south. Competition between studios and TV. 8 main studios suffered, Anti trust case weakened them, allowed independent and French films to influence independent filmmakers. This began the French influence in cinema: clear contrast between the styles of Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde, reflecting their different auteur signatures and institutional contexts\n\nSimilarities:\n\n-Creative staff\n\n-Max Steiner composed music for Warner Bros. between 1937 and 1953 – helped develop Warner Bros.’s style. Selects and composes music that best fits the film. Does this is other Warner Bros. films, showing it is a signature style. ‘As Time Goes By’ is expertly placed, and goes from diegetic to non-diegetic seamlessly in the Paris sequence. Score is manipulative – end of the Leaving Rick’s sequence when Ilsa leaves with Laszlo: drops an octave to show Rick is sad. Shows Casablanca. Is the product of an institution, as music and scores are a large part of Warner Bros. films. Minimal non-diegetic sound in Bonnie and Clyde, except bluegrass music which represents the time and place the film is set in\n\n-Hall B. Wallis – film producer for Warner Bros. – he was in control of choosing the casting – the cast is a large part of the studios auteurship, as actors were the face of the film. Wallis selected Ingrid Bergman, as she was young, pretty and relatable (after failing to contract Hedy Lamarr). Warren Beatty was the producer for Bonnie and Clyde. He selected actors he knew. Beatty is responsible for the depiction of Clyde as an unconventional male character. He greatly influenced the auteur style for Bonnie and Clyde\n\nMichael Curtiz – Directed 102 films in his career, most for Warner Bros. he introduced many new camera techniques and ways of lighting – for example, using a soft focus for Ilsa to blur her background, giving her a ‘halo’ effect. He used fluid camera movements, resembling the modern SteadiCam. Casablanca reflects the auteur signature style due to Curtiz’s influence. Arthur Penn does not have a signature style. He has the freedom to change his approach to film. Instead, Newman and Benton are the ones who influenced the French Style of the film. They approached Francois Truffaut for input on the film – he did not direct the film, but he influenced the film. The film looks the way it does as a result of his input\n\nCasablanca conclusion: many of the elements of filmmaking within Casablanca are representative of the general style of WarnerBrothers studios. Casablanca is extremely recognisable as a product of WarnerBrothers Studios because of elements such as cinematography, sound\n\nBonnie and Clyde conclusion: very different in all elements of film form. Indicative of a French New Wave style. More creative freedom for the director, but screenwriters has more freedom as a result of the weakening Hays Code, and changing times. Bonnie and Clyde has a clear French influence: New Hollywood featured edgy stories contrasting with Hollywood’s ‘happy endings.’ Independent films are often distinguishable from films produced by a large production company as their style and their content present the filmmaker’s artistic vision and not the production companies vision\n\nOverall conclusion: The films are reflections of the auteur signature features which is shown by the house style in Casablanca, compared to the influence of The French New Wave in Bonnie and Clyde. Purpose of making the films differ due the contexts that they were made: Bonnie and Clyde was made as a representation of the lives of those living in the Depression, and Casablanca for a political agenda. Both films are the products of different goals\n\nCompare how far your chosen films reflect the auteur signature features of their filmmakers\n\nThe auteur theory was introduced by Andre Bazin. The theory suggests that the director oversees all aspects of the film, making it fit into a particular aesthetic so that it is easily recognisable as their film. The director would then be considered the ‘author’ of the film. The auteur theory became relevant in 1930-1960, as the ‘Big 5 and Little 3’ were ‘churning out’ stylistically similar films to meet the demands of the audience, rather than creating a film with a personal meaning. Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde are very different films due to their auteur influences, but also the times in which they were made. Institutional and political contexts influence that auteur’s approach to the filmmaking process. For example, Casablanca aimed to make the American public support American intervention in the war, and Bonnie and Clyde aimed to show an audience what a film should look like by being stylistically and thematically unique.\n\nCasablanca is a romanticised story about the struggle to get to America in late 1941. The film is centrally about Rick and Ilsa who, despite their love for each other, must part for the greater good. It is a film about selflessness, patriotism and supports American intervention in the war.\n\nMichel Curtiz is not an auteur on his own – Casablanca was the product of many different people – but the film still has a distinct style, reflecting the Warner Bros. house style, suggesting it is the product of a studio (or institutional) auteur. During the Classic Hollywood era, the 8 main studios dominated the industry by a process called vertical integration, and essentially oligopolised the industry; each studio (except Columbia) had theatre chains, distribution and exhibition rights, and some even manufactured their own equipment. All costs were ‘in-house’, which cut costs, and maximised profits. All the main studios had a ‘stable of actors’ who they had in ‘unbreakable contracts’, but Warner Bros. did not do this – instead, they had a ‘stable of creative staff’. This ‘stable of creative staff’ is the reason Casablanca has a distinct style.\n\nJack Warner acted as the executive producer – his influence is seen throughout the film, as he wanted to convince the American audience to support American intervention in the war. To do this, Warner used real news footage of refugees in the opening sequence, and during the occupation of Paris – this showed an audience that this was real, and not just a fictitious rendition of war-time events. He used real news footage, and showed the panic in Paris to remind an audience that the allies are suffering while America watches; this makes an audience guilty and uncomfortable. Hal B Wallis is another important person who helped develop the studio auteurship: he selected the actors for each film, which gave recognisable faces to the patriotic messages Jack Warner was conveying.\n\nMax Steiner was also important in developing the Warner Bros. institutional auteurship. Steiner was one of the first to write musical scores for film – in fact, he was often referred to as ‘the father of film music’. His influences can be heard throughout. He expertly created scores that manipulated an audience, added drama to a scene, and more specifically, made the closing sequence all the more emotional. Cinematographer Arthur Edeson was also crucial in helping to create the distinct aesthetic seen in Casablanca. Edeson began his career as a photographer, giving him a creative advantage in his cinematography career. He experimented with shadows and lighting techniques to give a film more depth and detail, making him stand out at a time where many films were stylistically similar. His creative input as to how Ilsa was lit and framed, made her look innocent and youthful – this had an emotional impact on an audience. This technique is also used at the end with Rick, to show how he has changed from selfish and cynical to selfless and patriotic.\n\nMichael Curtiz introduced new lighting techniques, and more importantly, introduced a fluid camera movement, resembling the modern-day SteadiCam. This can better be seen in Rick’s introductory sequence when the camera almost glides through the cafe, positioning the audience as a guest. This shows off another key feature of Warner Bros. auteurship – intricately detailed sets that accommodated the camera, and showed off the large production budget.\n\nThese men helped to give Warner Bros. a distinct style that stood out. Casablanca is clearly the product of an auteur institution because of the influences from Warner, Wallis, Curtiz, Steiner and Edeson. This differed greatly from Bonnie and Clyde, as at the time, Warner Bros. did not have a ‘stable of creative staff’ due to the collapse of vertical integration; although creative personnel contributed to the distinct style and aesthetic of Bonnie and Clyde, it cannot be said the film is a product of a single auteur.\n\nCasablanca was built on a lot, as is typical of Warner Bros. (and other studios at the time). Films only began to be shot on-location in the 50s and 60s, showing that Casablanca is not only a product of the institution, but also the time it was created in. In addition, the set of Casablanca was large, detailed and emphasised the studio’s wealth. Often, wide shots were used to show the set off, mainly in Rick’s Cafe. The sets give an audience context – the streets of Casablanca are busy and heavily populated with a diverse range of people (showing off the hundreds of extras); Rick’s Cafe is luxurious, well-lit and intricately detailed; and Paris is a stereotypical presentation of France, and is also very detailed. A large, detailed, expensive set that accommodates the camera is a main feature of Warner Bros. auteurship.\n\nIt can be argued that the main reason Bonnie and Clyde was able to be so stylistically different was because of the Antitrust case (Paramount vs America). The Supreme Court ruled that studios could no longer control all stages of filmmaking, and prohibited studios from block booking more than 5 films (later, this was completely banned when the studios failed to obey – the banning of block booking was heavily influenced by SIMPP – Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers). The allowed foreign and independent films to make their way into American theatres, thus influencing American filmmakers to change their film style. Bonnie and Clyde is loosely based off the true story of the duo’s spree across America from 1932-1934 in The Great Depression.\n\nIn the final scene of Bonnie and Clyde, there is a visual reference to Breathless (Jean-Luc Godard, 1960) when one of the lenses of Clyde’s glasses comes out – this happened to Michel Pioccard in the closing sequence before he was shot and killed by police. This isn’t the only similarity Breathless holds to Bonnie and Clyde: Pioccard (who was, ironically, created to resemble Humphrey Bogarts typical brooding cynic character) impulsively shoots and kills a policeman whilst driving a stolen car, leading to his life on the lam; this is similar to when Clyde shoots the bank teller in the botched heist, catalysing their inevitable doom. These similarities are indicative of the influence The French New Wave had on Bonnie and Clyde, greatly helping to develop a distinct style.\n\nArthur Penn cannot be considered an auteur for Bonnie and Clyde for the same reason Michael Curtiz cannot be considered an auteur for Casablanca – many of the visual and technological techniques were adopted from The French New Wave – or in Casablanca’s case, film noir, and other American films that came before it. After 1945, French film hadn’t changed, and French filmmakers continued to make films about a war that most French would want to forget – so, young audiences especially lost interest, creating room for young filmmakers to fill the void in the industry. Post-war attitudes about the world inspired Francois Truffaut and other film critics to disparage the lack of artistic freedom, and visual sameness of films, a sameness that could also be seen in Hollywood films. Some of the most famous French film directors were Jacque Rivette, Claud Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut, who wrote The 400 Blows (Francois Truffaut, 1959), which features rebellious youths in trouble with the law, which inspired the filmmakers of Bonnie and Clyde. David Newman and Robert Benton wrote the script for Bonnie and Clyde, and because both appreciated The French New Wave, they approached Francois Truffaut, asking him to direct the film. He turned them down, and the two eventually managed to get Arthur Penn to direct the film. Editor Dede Allen embraced the freedom granted by this new French style, and created her own style of editing – a style that can be seen in many films she edited. Warren Beatty was the star and producer, selecting the actors, and oversaw the development of the script. Whilst Penn is not an auteur in his own right, the filmmakers and innovations of the French New Wave meant Bonnie and Clyde had a distinct style that was loved across America, and the world.\n\nThe use of cinematography and lighting in Casablanca is reflective of Warner Bros. institutional auteurship; many Warner Bros. films were reminiscent of film noir (as colour was primitive, and black and white seemed more ‘mature’). Rick is introduced through first his actions (playing chess alone – he’s isolated), then his attire (a white suit and black tie – unconventional), then his face is shown (shadowed and somber-looking). The use of low-key lighting, shadowing, and slowing revealing Rick’s character is typical of Arthur Edeson’s cinematography style. In contrast, Ilsa is well lit, in soft focus, and a catch light is used to make her eyes sparkle to show her innocence. This use of lighting, framing and character-perfection is carefully choreographed, and purposeful to manipulate an audience. It differs greatly from Bonnie and Clyde whose framing is improvised, lighting is minimal due to camera advancements, and characters are deeply flawed to reflect the French New Wave style of minimalism, and realism.\n\nThe French New Wave is characterised by hand-held camera movements, on-location shooting and advanced cameras with faster film stock to allow natural light to be used. In contrast, Casablanca uses a static camera, wide shots and is built on a lot so the set can accommodate the masses of equipment. This is seen in Rick’s introductory sequence, where the doors of the cafe are opened for the camera, and characters move out the way of the camera. Bonnie and Clyde being shot on-location in a Southern state that never recovered from the Depression reflects real life, and is indicative of French influence. This can be seen in multiple scenes; for example, when Clyde chases after Bonnie, a large cloud shadows the scene, making it hard to see the characters in the distance – this lack of control over external factors is typical of on-location shooting, and absent in films shot on a lot, like Casablanca.\n\nIn Casablanca, the characters move to reframe a scene. This is seen when Rick walks over to Ilsa in the cafe. The scene begins in a mid shot of Rick and Ilsa in deep focus, so that when Renault and Laszlo walk into frame, they are in clear view. The scene goes from a four shot, to a close up of Rick, then Laszlo, to a three-shot, and then a two-shot. The characters move within the shot to re-frame the scene – careful choreography is a key feature of Warner Bros. auteurship. In comparison, Bonnie and Clyde is not carefully choreographed, and is much more improvised, consistent with the French New Wave style. This is seen in the opening sequence: Bonnie moves around her room, and the camera follows her movement. At one point, the camera pushes into a close-up, but missed the focus point. Furthermore, throughout the film, the camera is often set further back in a wide shot to allow the characters to move within the scene, and capture everything they do such as at the beginning of the botched heist sequence.\n\nThe two films also use different sound techniques. In Rick’s Cafe, there is often diegetic music low in the mix played by Sam at his piano, or general murmurs from customers. Natural sounds lend verisimilitude to Bonnie and Clyde, reflecting the natural, on-location setting. Often in films from the Golden Age of Hollywood, diegetic sounds are unrealistically loud (such as the characters being heard over the sound of the plane in the closing sequence of Casablanca). The unnatural sounds that are organised perfectly in the mix shows it is a product of being filmed on a lot – typical of the Warner Bros. house style at the time.\n\nEditing is also a big stylistic difference between the two films. This is best seen when putting the two closing sequences side-by side. The editing in Casablanca’s closing sequence is carefully thought-out to optimise the sadness felt by the audience. Continuity editing is used when necessary, consisting of ‘invisible’ cuts, and ellipsis. In contrast, the editing in the closing sequence of Bonnie and Clyde is erratic, and reflects the violence – close-ups and mid shots are edited together to draw out the death sequence, heightening emotion. Multiple cameras were running at different distances, frame rates and angles to give variation to the scene, allowing editor Dede Allen to be creative. This is a huge difference between the films’ style, both styles denoting to their production contexts, and auteurs.\n\nOverall, both films reflect their institutional auteur to an extent, but they more so reflect their production contexts. Of course, had it not been for the French New Wave, Bonnie and Clyde would not have looked the way it did; but had it not been for the collapse of vertical integration, the Antitrust case, and the weakening Hays Code (that forbid violent or sexual imagery), French cinema would not have been able to influence American filmmakers. Neither film conform to the typical definition of an auteur, as the director’s films change style throughout time, but both feature the signature styles of those working on the film. It is the creative staff that contributes to the style of each film. Steiner’s compositions, Edeson’s lighting and cinematography influences, Hal B. Wallis’ selection of creative personnel, Curtiz’s framing and camera techniques and and Jack Warner’s political input shaped Casablanca, adding to the Warner Bros. house style. Put together, these men contributed the Casablanca’s structure and auteur techniques. David Newman and Robert Benton’s script (with Truffaut’s input), Dede Allen’s innovative editing, Beatty’s choice of actors and his use of method acting to present Clyde, Penn’s directorship, and of course, the influence of The French New Wave shaped Bonnie and Clyde. It is because of these people that Bonnie and Clyde can be considered the product of an auteurship, along with the reflection of the French New Wave style.\n\nDate: 24/05/23\n\nQuestions\n\n50 minutes; 40 marks; 11.6% of qualification\n\nAuteur question 1\n\n1.1 •Either: “The director is always the most important influence on a film.” Compare how far your two chosen films support this statement.\n\n1.2 •Or: Compare how far the two films you have studied reflect the times they were made.\n\nAuteur question 2\n\n1.1 •Either: Compare some of the ways in which the look and style of the films you have studied reflect the influence of auteurs. Refer in detail to one sequence from each film.\n\n1.2 •Or: “New Hollywood allowed filmmakers more creative freedom than Classical Hollywood did”. Compare the two films you have studied in relation to this statement.\n\n•In Section A, the questions were testing candidates’ knowledge and understanding of the auteur debate as applied to the films they had studied and the candidates’ abilities to compare the films. Question 1.1 was more focused on asking candidates to compare the ways in which the films reflected an auteur influence in relation to ‘look and style’ and demanded detailed reference to a sequence from each film. Most successful responses had a clear focus on auteur ‘signatures’ and included analytical detail on mise-en-scene and cinematography in comparing the films. Some candidates looked closely at editing and performance as part of the visual style and that was acceptable too. There were some excellent responses that evaluated the influence of auteurs compared to wider contextual styles and were able to be very precise in identifying an auteurs influences on specific aspects of the films they had studied. Some talked more generally about visual style, such responses assumed auteur influence rather than evidenced it.\n\n•Question 1.2 was more focused on contexts and auteur freedom, asking candidates to address these issues in comparing the films. Most candidates focused on how the films’ aesthetic styles and thematic concerns evidenced varying degrees of freedom or studio control but some candidates focused more on auteurs’ approach to the production process and manner of working. Both approaches were acceptable, indeed with some films and auteurs the latter approach could be argued to be more fruitful for a question like this.\n\nAuteur question 3\n\n1.1 •Either: “Film is a collaborative art form, so to focus on the contribution of one individual as the auteur is misleading.” Compare the two films you have studied in relation to this statement.\n\n1.2 •Or: “An auteur’s signature is always apparent in the messages and values of the films they make.” Compare the two films you have studied in relation to this statement.\n\nAuteur question 4\n\n•Either: “Cinematography and editing are crucial in expressing a clear auteur signature.” Compare the films you have studied in relation to this statement.\n\n•Or: Compare how representations of ethnicity and/or gender are shaped by the historical contexts of the films you have studied.\n\nAuteur Question 1: Compare how far the two films you have studied reflect the times they were made.\n\nIntroduction: Introduce both films – Bonnie and Clyde (Arthur Penn, 1967) and Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) are both different films due to their influences.\n\nPoint 1 (two paragraphs): Bonnie and Clyde broke away from Old Hollywood, and is heavily French-influenced so it looks like…\n\nBonnie and Clyde had foreign influence because of the breakdown of vertical integration. Seen in opening sequence… The French influences shows that the film was made after the Paramount Court Case.\n\nViolence and sexual suggestion allowed because of weakening Hays code – seen in final sequence (very brief paragraph)\n\n(Comparative sentence: restrictions of the Hays Code is clear in Casablanca)\n\nPoint 2 (two paragraphs): Casablanca was made during the Golden Age of Hollywood so it looks like…\n\nCasablanca had little foreign influence because of vertical integration. Influence came from politics (war) and Jack Warner\n\nLarge sets, dramatic lighting, film noir. Seen in opening sequence\n\n(Comparative sentence: mise-en-scene is a clear indicator of the time in which Casablanca was made. Bonnie and Clyde is based in realism, and is a very minimalistic – very different from Casablanca)\n\nConclusion: Discuss key differences\n\nBonnie and Clyde has French influence. Sets are natural, themes are realistic, there is violence and sexual suggestion. Casablanca does not have this because of the Hays Code. Key Elements of Film Form are controlled and perfect.\n\nFinal sequence reflects the time in which they were made: violence in Bonnie and Clyde, tight close-ups and patriotic messages in final scene of Casablanca\n\nAuteur Question 2: ”New Hollywood allowed filmmakers more creative freedom than Classical Hollywood did”. Compare the two films you have studied in relation to this statement\n\nIntroduction: Introduce both films – Bonnie and Clyde (Arthur Penn, 1967) and Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) are both different films due to their influences, and abundance of, or lack of creative freedom\n\nPoint 1 (two paragraphs): Classical Hollywood was highly restricted due to vertical integration blocking foreign influence, and the Hays code restricting explicit content.\n\nThis is clear in Casablanca in the lack of violence or sexual suggestion in the opening sequence… War films were popular, so no other films were made. Old Hollywood restrictions seen in Rick’s introductory sequence…\n\n(Comparative sentence: audiences were wanting different types of films, along with that, the Hays Code was weakening, and vertical integration had fallen. Collectively, this gave the filmmakers for Bonnie and Clyde more creative freedom. Casablanca is arguably a piece of propaganda. What was allowed to be shown was restricted because of the Hays Code, and vertical integration – no foreign film – giving the filmmakers less creative freedom).\n\nPoint 2 (two paragraphs): Vertical integration broke down, allowing foreign film to be shown. This influenced a new generation of filmmakers…\n\nThis is clear in Bonnie and Clyde in the frequency of violence (squibs – new technology) and sexual suggestion. Ignored Hays Code, giving more creative freedom. French influence is clear in opening sequence.\n\n“Dede Allen, the film’s editor, embraced the freedom granted by the innovations of The French New Wave to create her own style of editing”.\n\n(Comparative sentence: With the fall of The Golden Age of Hollywood, the filmmakers for New Hollywood had much more creative freedom in the themes explored, and what content was shown. These types of films were also very popular, giving filmmakers incentive to break away from old Hollywood).\n\nConclusion: Outline key differences between the two, and link it to creative freedom. Cinematography is a key difference – new technologies and new techniques. Bonnie and Clyde has French-inspired technology and techniques where as Casablanca is restricted to American influence and American technologies.\n\nAuteur Question 3: An auteur’s signature is always apparent in the messages and values of the films they make.” Compare the two films you have studied in relation to this statement.\n\nIntroduction: Introduce both films – Bonnie and Clyde (Arthur Penn, 1967) and Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) are both different films due to abundance of or lack of messages or values of the auteur\n\nPoint 1 (two paragraphs): Bonnie and Clyde doesn’t have one auteur, so values and messages cannot come from one person alone. The filmmakers were influenced by the French New Wave, so a lot of techniques in Bonnie and Clyde came from France. Although the techniques were French-inspired, the messages and values were not.\n\nThere are no obvious messages or values in the film – it is set during the Great Depression 30 years before the film was made, so the messages about poverty are outdated. This makes the statement untrue.\n\nHowever, the final scene is loosely influence by the violence of the Vietnam War, so it could be said that studio auteurship influenced this scene. It could be said that the violence in Bonnie and Clyde reflected real-life violence.\n\n(Comparative sentence: The producer in Casablanca (Jack Warner) had much more control over the messages and values. The messages and values in Bonnie and Clyde don’t come from one person\n\nPoint 2 (two paragraphs): Casablanca has one key auteur: Jack Warner. His influence is present in the political theme and patriarchy. But the film is the product of studio auteurship, so there are other influences in the film, like that of Max Steiner (music) and Arthur Edeson (cinematographer).\n\n(Comparative sentence: Casablanca is made to make an audience sympathise with refugees, and support American intervention. The messages in Casablanca are more manipulative than those in Bonnie and Clyde – messages in Bonnie and Clyde remind an audience that reality is often violent, and not at all glamorous like Casablanca may suggest.\n\nConclusion: An auteur’s signature is not clear in either films – there is a consistent (and manipulative) political/war theme in Warner Bros. films in the years during the war, but after WWII, this was not a central theme in their films. The same can be said for Bonnie and Clyde – there are no themes or values typical of the auteur(s). An auteur’s signature is not always present in their films, especially if the film is the product of studio auteurship – one person does not have complete control over what messages are present in either films.\n\nAuteur Question 4: “Cinematography and editing are crucial in expressing a clear auteur signature.” Compare the films you have studied in relation to this statement.\n\nIntroduction: Introduce both films – Cinematography and editing are very different in Bonnie and Clyde (Arthur Penn, 1967) and Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942). These elements of film form are important in expressing studio auteurship\n\nPoint 1 (two paragraphs): Bonnie and Clyde is heavily French-influenced, which is a key feature of studio auteurship. French influence is present throughout the film in themes and the mise-en-scene, but more importantly, in the cinematography and editing. The French influence on these elements of film form are important in expressing auteurship.\n\nThe influence is clear in the opening sequence… continuous movement in editing… restrictive close-ups of Bonnie.\n\n”David Newman and Robert Brenton, the screenwriters, wrote the script in the style of the French New Wave and Dede Allen, the film’s editor, embraced the freedom granted by the innovations of the French New Wave to create her own style of editing. Following the trend of key stars being involved with the production of the film, Warren Beatty hired the screenwriters and selected the cast as well as overseeing the development of the script. Whilst Penn individually was not an auteur, the combination of the film’s production team taking inspiration from the French New Wave meant that Bonnie and Clyde had a distinct style.”\n\n(Comparative sentence: Casablanca’s cinematography and editing is rhythmic and choreographed. Casablanca opens a scene with an establishing shot, giving an audience context, but Bonnie and Clyde often opens a scene with a restrictive close-up. Especially in the final scene of Bonnie and Clyde, where cinematography and editing are highly manipulative).\n\nPoint 2 (two paragraphs): Casablanca’s style is the opposite; it is typical of the time in which it was made, rather than of the auteur(s). No restrictive close-ups. Editing is rhythmic and not used to manipulate an audience’s mood like it is in Bonnie and Clyde (rapid editing manipulates an audience’s emotion).\n\nThe opening scene is a good example of how cinematography and editing are used to express auteurship. Static camera watches the action as it happens and closes in on more important details.\n\n“Whilst Michael Curtiz cannot be considered an auteur, Casablanca still has a distinct individual style reflective of Warner Brothers’ house style suggesting that the studio acted as an institutional auteur.”\n\n”However, more stylistic influences were brought to the film by cinematographer Arthur Edeson, renowned for his low-key lighting and use of shadows, and composer Max Steiner, viewed as having a speciality for creating dramatic and memorable scenes that match themes and characters on-screen. The combined work of these individuals under the Warner Brothers’ studio culminated in a unique film reflective of their styles, a similar sentiment that characterised the auteur theory.”\n\n(Comparative sentence: The opening scene introduces the film by showing an audience the large, detailed and expensive set. Bonnie and Clyde doesn’t have the budget for such a large, detailed set. Large sets in Casablanca are typical of Warner Bros. films.\n\nConclusion: Cinematography and editing are used to express auteurship to an extent, but these techniques are more-so used to reflect the time in which the films were made, and what films influenced them. For Bonnie and Clyde, these influences were French, and for Casablanca, it was American film, and film noir. Key Elements of Film Form are crucial in expressing auteurship, but also in expressing influence. Specifically in Bonnie and Clyde, cinematography and editing were used to showcase new techniques, and to break away from Old Hollywood.\n\nQuestions 3 and 4 are asking about studio auteurship, not individual auteurship.

It was set in the days leading up to American intervention, so its central themes are based around the war, promoting intervention and patriotism. On the other hand, Bonnie and Clyde (Arthur Penn, 1967) was made (also by Warner Bros.) after the collapse of the studio system. The American economy had almost recovered from the economic crash in 1929, and WWII was nearly two decades ago. For this reason, audiences weren’t interested in war films, and wanted a change.\n\nCasablanca takes inspiration German expressionism and film noir. These two styles are in black-and-white, but German expressionism uses highly dramatised lighting, melodramatic acting and uses careful choreographing; film noir uses high and low key lighting, and shadows, overall giving a pessimistic, or menacing effect. Despite taking some influence from the German style, foreign influence in film at the time was limited, due to the vertical integration of studios, and the oligopolisation of the film industry. Studios owned theatres, meaning foreign and independent films could not be shown, so the main influence studios had were the films that came before them.\n\nAnother feature of the studio system relating to Casablanca is the extravagant set. Rick’s cafe is a lavish building, with a fully furnished interior, bright lighting, and a structure accommodating equipment. The sets are large, highly detailed and expensive, so Warner Bros. makes sure an audience sees every part of the sets to show-off their large budget. This differs from Bonnie and Clyde, as the sets were natural, and all shooting was done on-location.\n\nHowever, the studio system came with challenges in the form of the highly restrictive Hays Code. The Hays Code forbid filmmakers from showing any sort of explicit content, be it graphic violence, profane language or nudity – the code is something filmmakers resented, as it gave them little room to express serious themes. When the usual suspect from the beginning and Major Strasser are shot, there is no blood, or any type of injury detail. An audience are told both are shot dead through the juxtaposition between the gun shot, and them falling to the ground. The hatred for the code built up over the next two decades, until it faded out entirely: it could be said that Bonnie and Clyde helped greatly in the removal of the code, for the film’s depictions of violence and sexual imagery, normalising this type of content.\n\nJack Warner had a lot of influence over the film’s messages and themes – he had a strong preference for patriotic themes and characters that promoted American intervention. It could be said that Casablanca is a piece of propaganda, and that Jack Warner had an ulterior motive for creating the film in such a way. Many of Warner’s films during war time were similar in style, often pairing his patriotic themes with movie stars an audience wanted to relate to (such as Humphrey Bogart as Rick). His political agenda extends to the release date of the film: it was first released in New York to align with ‘Operation Torch’ (the invasion of Morocco by allies in an attempt to liberate it from Vichy French), and globally released to correspond with ‘The Casablanca Conference’, to have maximum impact on an audience. Casablanca is a politically based and highly manipulative film. An audience is shown the panic in Paris in the days before occupation, and shown news reels of refugees to remind an audience that American allies are suffering while America watches; this makes an audience guilty, as they are reminded of what is going on in the world. The patriotic messages are an example of how Casablanca is a product of Warner Bros.. This is different from Bonnie and Clyde. In Bonnie and Clyde, the intentions were to break away from Old Hollywood, and introduce a new style, rather than raise questions about politics, and manipulate an audience as part of a political agenda.\n\nKey Elements of Film Form are influenced entirely by what was typical at the time. Continuity editing is used throughout the film (even in the unconventional flashback), reaction shots are used to ensure an audience’s understanding, and many wide-shots and long-shots are used to give context to a scene. Furthermore, the editing is typical for the era (moderately paced), and shots do not restrict environmental context. These were the typical conventions for films in The Golden Age of Hollywood, meaning many films through the era were stylistically similar.\n\nWith the break-down of vertical integration after the Paramount Antitrust Case, foreign films could be viewed in America. Previously, the only influences studios had, were other studios, so a unique, new style was well-received. Director Arthur Penn, editor Dede Allen and screenwriters David Newman and Robert Benton admired the French New Wave style, implementing many features of the style into Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nBonnie and Clyde was heavily influenced by The French New Wave – this was an emerging style that was most popular in the younger generations. At the time, films being made were very stylistically and thematically similar, many being centred around war, had a ‘happily ever after’ for the protagonists, and were not relatable, or remotely realistic. These types of film decreasing in popularity, and experimental films rising in popularity, marked the complete collapse of The Golden Age of Hollywood and the studio system.\n\nSimilar to Casablanca, there were references to the political and social state of America at the time each film was set. However, the issue addressed in Bonnie and Clyde was The Great Depression – a crisis that had long since passed, and something that ordinary Americans had no control over. The Great Depression was something viewers understood, and many had lived through, which made the film relatable. Films from The French New Wave were based in reality, and explored small-scaled, contemporary, niche ideas that were more relatable – so more entertaining – for an audience. Casablanca was highly expressionistic, and not relatable to an audience – its purpose was to persuade viewers that intervention was the moral thing to do.\n\nIn contrast to Casablanca, Bonnie and Clyde was shot on-location in a southern state that had never recovered from The Great Depression. Although the set was large and accurately reflected a town from the 1930s, it was natural and untouched, so couldn’t possibly match the spectacle of the sets in Casablanca.\n\nSomething that particularly stands out in Bonnie and Clyde is the violence and sexual suggestion: previously, the aforementioned Hays Code had forbid graphic violence and sexual implications. In Casablanca the effects of the Hays Code are clear – there is no injury detail during either two murders, and very little romance, despite the underlying romance theme. At the time Bonnie and Clyde was made, the Hays Code was still in place, but had very little influence, and was ultimately ignored. Bonnie and Clyde pushed the boundaries of the already weak code, giving an audience something they hadn’t seen before, making the film even more of a novelty. The violence in the film takes inspiration from the televised atrocities of the Vietnam War – an audience had become used to such depictions of violence. The violence in the film highlighted the fact that reality can be brutal, and it shouldn’t be censored or hidden as it had been in Casablanca – a film set in one of the most horrible and violent times in history. Furthermore, the sexual suggestion and phallic imagery seen in the opening sequence pushed the boundaries of the Hays Code, but also eluded to the prohibition of alcohol. Even though the Hays Code was weak, and had little effect of the film, the prohibition of alcohol is reflected in the film when the pair drink a bottle of coke. References to the prohibition have been made throughout film history (such as The Scarecrow (Buster Keaton, 1920), showing that there still rules and regulations that everyone has to adhere to.\n\nAs well as new cinematic, thematic and stylistic techniques, The French New Wave introduced new technologies. Cameras were lightweight and portable (so the need for large, accommodating sets was obsolete), and had faster film stock, allowing films to be shot with limited or natural light. These new advances in technology were adopted by the filmmakers for Bonnie and Clyde. There is frequent use of multiple cameras to give a range of angles and shots, scenes are naturally lit, adding to the realism, and the film is shot in colour – this is a key difference between Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde, denoting to the time in which both were produced.\n\nDespite the large number of differences between Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde, there are a small number of similarities. Firstly, both Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde use big movie stars to promote their film – Casablanca uses Humphrey Bogart to promote patriotism and self-sacrifice; Bonnie and Clyde uses Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway to represent rebelliousness, and mistrust of authority. Casablanca uses Bogart to promote immediate American intervention in the war – to get a message across to an audience – and Bonnie and Clyde use their stars simply to generate more excitement for the film. The reasoning for using big film stars differs, but is equally as effective.\n\nPerhaps the biggest similarity is studio auteurship – both films are the product of a studio auteurship, meaning one person isn’t entirely responsible for the film. Casablanca is the product of multiple staff members, such as Michael Curtiz, Jack Warner, Arthur Edeson and Max Steiner, who all contributed to the style, look and sound of the film. Bonnie and Clyde was influenced by Arthur Penn, Warren Beatty, David Newman, Robert Benton and François Truffaut (who was asked to ready an early version of the script), collectively contributing to the film style. This collective, studio auteurship is common among films from The Golden Age of Hollywood, through to the middle of the New Hollywood era, before directors had more creative freedom.\n\nThe final scene in both films stands out: both use techniques typical for the era of Hollywood they were produced in – the height of The Golden Age of Hollywood, and the collapse of The Golden Age of Hollywood. In the final scene of Casablanca, high-key lighting is used to maximise the emotional impact on the audience. In contrast (courtesy to the French-influenced camera advancements), the lighting in Bonnie and Clyde is natural, as the admiration for dramatic lighting had been lost. Rick is lit similarly to Ilsa, showing the change he has gone through. In the rest of the film, he had been harshly-lit, shadowed, and makeup had been used to sharpen his features. In contrast, Ilsa was softly lit, and shot in shallow focus, blurring the background behind her, giving a halo effect. The tight close-ups and similarity in lighting in the final sequence shows the romance, and the moral shift Rick has gone through. The changes in the final scene juxtapose the rest of the film to draw attention to Rick’s turn to patriotism. This differs greatly from Bonnie and Clyde, as natural lighting, and minimal makeup was used to emphasise the experimental nature of the film, and the change in style.\n\nBonnie and Clyde’s final scene is perhaps one of the most violent scenes America had seen up until that point, making it very different to the romantic finale in Casablanca. As well as being different from Casablanca, the final scene is also very distant from the rest of Bonnie and Clyde. Throughout the film, the French influence was obvious – restrictive close-ups, consistent pacing, long shots, wide shots and long takes to give a ‘fly on the wall’ effect – but the French influence is absent in the final scene. Building up to and during the shootout, the editing is rapid, and the shots are two-shots and close-ups of Bonnie and Clyde. The use of overlapping editing draws the scene out for longer, to maximise the emotional impact on an audience; additionally, to extend the scene, multiple cameras were running simultaneously, at different frame rates, angles and distances to give variation to the final cut. After both Bonnie and Clyde have fallen, the editing slows, and the frame rate drops to maximise the emotional impact. These techniques are a new, experimental idea, never seen before. The pacing and frame rate in Casablanca was consistent throughout, and editing pace was not experimented with to provoke emotion from an audience.\n\nThe final scene for each in indicative of the time in which they were made. The main difference is the presence and absence of the Hase Code that denies any sort of affection in Casablanca, and is powerless to stop the violent shootout in Bonnie and Clyde. The filmmakers for Casablanca ‘follow suit’, and take inspiration from American films before it, giving the film little variation from other films of its time. The filmmakers for Bonnie and Clyde had the creative freedom to have a heavily French-influenced film, but also an experimental final scene that did not conform to any style or film conventions.\n\nAlthough just 25 years apart, both films are polar opposites. Casablanca is the traditional, patriotic, romance-war film, and Bonnie and Clyde is the first-of-its-kind, French, experimental film that pushed the boundaries of the Hays Code, and popularised the French style. Their differences massively outweigh their similarities, showing how much film had changed after the Paramount Anti Trust Case, and in response to the changing industry.\n\nDate: 10/01/23\n\nVersion 2: Compare how far your chosen films reflect their different production contexts\n\nCasablanca takes inspiration German expressionism and film noir. These two styles are in black-and-white, but German expressionism uses highly dramatised lighting, melodramatic acting and uses careful choreographing; film noir uses high and low key lighting, and shadows, overall giving a pessimistic, or menacing effect.

The sets are large, highly detailed and expensive, so Warner Bros. makes sure an audience sees every part of the sets to show-off their large budget. This differs from Bonnie and Clyde, as the sets were natural, and all shooting was done on-location. After the collapse of the studio system, foreign film could influence filmmakers – the main influence was the French New Wave. The classic French style was characterised by realist themes, improvised choreography, natural make-up and lighting, and unconventional lead characters – the complete opposite to Casablanca.\n\nThe studio system and vertical integration made it impossible for independent filmmakers to make a name for themselves. In turn, the 8 main studios monopolised the industry, profiting millions to the detriment of those independent filmmakers. However, the studio system came with challenges in the form of the highly restrictive Hays Code. The Hays Code forbid filmmakers from showing any sort of explicit content, be it graphic violence, profane language or nudity – the code is something filmmakers resented, as it gave them little room to express serious themes, or be realistic. When the usual suspect from the beginning, and Major Strasser are shot, there is no blood, or any type of injury detail, showing the impact the code had. The hatred for the code built up over the next two decades, until it faded out entirely: it could be said that Bonnie and Clyde helped greatly in the removal of the code, for the film’s depictions of violence and sexual imagery, normalising this type of content. Audiences loved this type of film with sexual innuendos, and graphic violence, so the Hays Codes was ultimately ignored.\n\nJack Warner had a lot of influence over the film’s messages and themes – he had a strong preference for patriotic themes and characters that promoted American intervention. It could be said that Casablanca is a piece of propaganda, and that Jack Warner had an ulterior motive for creating the film in such a way. Many of Warner’s films during war time were similar in style, often pairing his patriotic themes with movie stars an audience wanted to relate to (such as Humphrey Bogart). Similarly, Bonnie and Clyde uses big stars to promote the film, although the stars were used to promote the idea of a new studio system with less restrictions, and realist themes. When Rick reminisces about the past, an audience is shown the panic in Paris in the days before occupation, and are shown news reels of refugees to remind an audience that American allies are suffering while America watches; this makes an audience guilty, as they are reminded of what is going on in the world. The patriotic messages and manipulation are examples of how Casablanca is a product of Warner Bros.. This is different from Bonnie and Clyde, as the intentions were to break away from Old Hollywood, and introduce a new style, rather than raise questions about politics and manipulate an audience as part of a political agenda.\n\nWith the break-down of vertical integration after the Paramount Antitrust Case, foreign films could be viewed in America.

This collective, studio auteurship is common among films from The Golden Age of Hollywood, through to the middle of the New Hollywood era, before directors had more creative freedom. Different creative staff worked together, combining their skills, and drawing from other films for inspiration. Casablanca was inspired by previous American, film noir movies, and Bonnie and Clyde was inspired by the French New Wave.\n\nThe final scene in both films stands out: both use techniques typical for the era of Hollywood they were produced in – the height of The Golden Age of Hollywood, and the collapse of The Golden Age of Hollywood. In the final scene of Casablanca, high-key lighting is used to maximise the emotional impact on the audience. Rick is lit similarly to Ilsa, showing the change he has gone through.

Bonnie wears minimalist make-up, and isn’t lit or positioned in a flattering way.\n\nBonnie and Clyde’s final scene is perhaps one of the most violent scenes America had seen up until that point, making it very different to the romantic finale in Casablanca. As well as being different from Casablanca, the final scene is also very distant from the rest of Bonnie and Clyde.

After both Bonnie and Clyde have fallen, the editing slows, and the frame rate drops. The pacing and frame rate in Casablanca was consistent throughout, and editing pace was not experimented with to provoke emotion from an audience. Bonnie and Clyde used this rapid editing style with a variety of camera shots to give variation, but also to manipulate an audience into feeling sorry for Bonnie and Clyde. This is different to Casablanca for that reason.\n\nThe final scene for each in indicative of the time in which they were made. The main difference is the presence and absence of the Hays Code that denies any sort of affection in Casablanca, and is powerless to stop the violent shootout in Bonnie and Clyde.

Identify and write about how key moments of the sequence support the argument that the film is the work of an auteur studio.\n\nContext\n\nThe film opens with credits displayed over a map of Africa. There is then a cross-fade to a special effects, spinning globe with voice-over narration, explaining the journey of refugees. A line appears on a map to show the long treacherous journey those fleeing Europe had to travel, and that only the lucky ones made it to Casablanca. An audience are then shown the streets of Casablanca, crowded with different people: Europeans, Westerners, natives. An announcer is shown explaining how two German couriers were murdered, and their exits visas were stolen. The police were ordered to round up the usual suspects, and arrest them. A man carrying ‘Free France’ propaganda is murdered, just beneath the ‘Palace of Justice’. This final scene contextualises the oppression.\n\nKey Elements\n\nThe film begins with a grand, non-diegetic composed score to open the film. The music gradually gets more dramatic and exotic. At the time the film was shot, France had been occupied for two years, so to bring attention to their occupation and oppression, the music transitioned into the patriotic, French national anthem. The French had been bullied and oppressed by the Nazis occupying Paris, so playing their national anthem was Jack Warner’s way of reminding American people that the French needed help.\n\nThe first name to appear in the credits is Jack Warner’s to show his connection to the film, and that the ideas and themes present in the film are associated with his own. The next names to appear are the big film stars – Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. This is a technique all studios used to show off their glamorous and most popular actors to hook an audience straight away. This is an example of auteurship, because it could be said that actors ‘carry a film’, so having their names on display shows them off even more. The appearance of these two names may also hint at the underlying romance theme that was becoming so popular throughout the Golden Age of Hollywood. As the music crescendos, Max Steiner’s name appears; Steiner was an important influence in Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942), and many other Warner Bros. films. Steiner contributed to the aesthetic of Warner Bros. films, and helped in making the institution an auteur. Finally, the last name to appear is director, Michael Curtiz. His name being last shows that Casablanca is no more his film than anyone else’s – the film is a product of the institution it was produced in, in conjunction with the actors, composer, director and producer.\n\nAnother notable point is that the film is in black and white, despite the fact that colour had been available for a decade. Not only was black and white cheaper, it was seen as mature and authentic; it became a signature style of Warner Bros. – an element of their auteurship. Additionally, colour was relatively primitive, many coloured films at the time were grainy and poorer quality than black and white films, so using black and white made a film look more expensive, professional and vintage. Warner Bros. is known for dark crime, film noir or gang films, so black and white fits this aesthetic.\n\nAfter the credits end, there is a cross-fade to a map of Africa to establish where the film takes place. This is an immersive technique Warner Bros. used to show an audience that what they are seeing is currently happening in real real life. The narration is paired with a special effects, spinning globe – special effects was relatively new in the film industry, so this would be a novelty for an audience.\n\nAs the globe spins and the camera pushes into Africa, narrations begins. The narration is dramatic and biased towards France to try to make an audience sympathise with the French living in or trying to leave occupied France. There is a second cross-face to a 2D map with an animated trail; as the line progresses south, real news footage is superimposed onto the maps to show the journey to Casablanca – the people in the news footage look tired, desperate and poor. This was an attempt to show American audiences what French and European refugees were going through, and why America should intervene.\n\nThis narration summarises everything an audience needs to know – the treacherous refugee path takes travellers to Marseilles, to Oren and to Casablanca. To add to the emotion, the narrator says that not everyone makes it to Lisbon, fewer make it to Casablanca, and even fewer make it to America. Audiences watching this at the time would be complacent in un-involved America, and wouldn’t know the horrors of war. The film tells audiences that thousands of people were trying to get to America, which highlights how privileged an audience was at the time. This manipulative technique is how Jack Warner tried to get the American public on his side – films under his influence made an audience feel guilty, and that the least America could do is help the allies.\n\nThe next scene is of Casablanca; however, it has just been painted onto a canvas. Studios at the time didn’t shoot on location, instead preferred to construct or paint their own sets, allowing the director to be selective with what was shown, and how their location was represented – this is another feature of Warner Bros.’ auteurship. As the camera tilts down to the crowded, bustling streets of Casablanca, diegetic sounds of loud talking and shouting quickly rises in the mix. As well as diegetic sound, the non-diegetic composed score is exotic, native music to further immerse an audience into the film world. As the camera tilts and pans, an audience are shown more of the streets and the enormity of the set. This was to show off the money spent on construction, and on hiring hundreds of extras to make the streets of Casablanca busy and loud. The characters wear a range of clothes, from Westernised suits to native dress to show the diversity of Casablanca – there are many different ethnicities here, most are refugees trying to get to America, but very few lucky people make it, further emphasising the audience’s privilege.\n\nThe camera cuts to an operator reading an urgent telegram: two German couriers were murdered in Oren, and their exit visas were stolen. The murderer was assumed to be travelling to Casablanca. The ‘suspicious’, usual suspects were to be rounded up and searched for the visas. This is exposition – an audience are told exactly what is necessary for them to understand the film. This makes the film easy to follow for all audiences. The next scenes are rapidly cut together to show the chaos and rush of police trying to arrest their suspects as they try to run. In the next scene, the camera pans to follow the police car through the streets, which in turn shows off the detailed, constructed sets. The rapid cutting and shot reverse-shot give a sense of urgency and chaos. The brutality of the police divides them from ordinary people, and makes an audience sympathise with the men being rounded up – the refugees have escaped prosecution, only to be faced with more oppression from the Vichy French.\n\nBecause Casablanca was shot in a constructed set in Hollywood, all of the actors were American, so the Vichy French police had highly exaggerated accents. The final scene in this sequence shows a refugee being harassed by the police; he hands the police his expired papers and tries to escape custody. However, the man is shot in the back before he can escape. The police pull ‘Free France’ papers from the man’s hand, showing his patriotism, and commitment to his cause. This is clear French propaganda, and a political message that Jack Warner and Michael Curtiz decided to include, to bring attention to the oppressed French, who were desperate to escape Nazi-influence Morocco, or those still trying to get out of Nazi occupied France. By showing the dead man clutching onto this propaganda, it tells an audience that people were dying for their cause, and for their country. Warner and Curtiz showed an audience this to try to garner sympathy for the French. Ironically, this man was killed unjustly under the ‘Palace of Justice’, which was inscribed with the French motto: ‘freedom, equality, brotherhood’ – the Vichy French have strayed far from their patriotic motto.\n\nWhen the man is shot, there is no blood or violence – instead, his death is implicit. This is because of the Hays code: this was a set of guidelines for all studios and their films between 1934 and 1968. It prohibited profanity, graphic violence, or blood and injury detail (among other profane images). This shows that Casablanca is product of the time in which it was made. Despite Warner Bros. being one of the biggest studios of the time, they still had to adhere to rules.\n\nDate: 18/11/22\n\nWrite a blog post about Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942). Give your impressions and interpretation of the film and research its director and cast.\n\nWhat is the film about? Who are the main characters and what happens to them?\n\nFirstly, background information on Morocco is important to understand the film, and why certain characters were persecuted. Before World War II, Morocco was occupied by France – an ally – but in WWII, was controlled by Vichy France after the Nazis occupied France in June, 1940. Although supposedly neutral, Morocco sided with the Germans: in November 1942 (a month before the film took place), British and American troops landed in Casablanca as a part of ‘Operation Torch’ to attempt to reclaim French North Africa. However, the French forces in Morocco resisted and fought back, so when it came to ‘choosing a side’, the ‘neutral Morocco’ sided with the Germans. This explains why some people were not permitted to leave Casablanca, despite having visas. Many people trying to escape to Lisbon from Casablanca were Jewish or minorities persecuted by the Germans, revealing why many characters in the film didn’t make it out of Casablanca, or resorted to buying visas illegally. Many of the refugees made their way to Rick’s Café to gamble, attempting to save up for a black market visa; it would become clear that players were not supposed to win at roulette unless Rick wanted them to, showing an audience that it was hard for refugees to escape persecution. Rick’s Café belongs to the main character, Rick Blaine. Rick is notoriously selfish, blunt and bitter, claiming that he has no side, and ‘sticks his neck out for no one’.\n\nUgarte – an Italian blackmarket dealer – kills two German couriers to steal the letters of transit they carry. These letters allow the carrier to flee to neutral Lisbon, and easily get to America, making them massively valuable. Police, under the command of the corrupt Captain Louis Renault, locate Ugarte and arrest him to retrieve the letters. But, just before his arrest, Ugarte entrusted the letters to Rick, who hid them in Sam’s – his friend from Paris – piano. It would appear that Renault made the arrest to impress Major Strasser and his company of Nazis who have come to check on their allies in Vichy Morocco.\n\nSoon after Ugarte’s arrest, the buyers of his pricey visas enter – Victor Laszlo and his wife, Ilsa Lund. It becomes clear that Ilsa is the reason for Rick’s bitterness and selfishness. Laszlo is a Czech Resistance leader who is trying to flee from persecution after having escaped a concentration camp, so is desperate for the visas to continue leading his resistance. In a flashback, Rick and Ilsa’s past is revealed – they were in love, and due to leave Paris together before the Nazi occupation. However, at the time, she had believed Laszlo had died in a concentration camp, so upon hearing he was alive, she left Rick at the train station with no explanation.\n\nThe next night, a young Bulgarian woman walks into the cafe asking for Rick’s help. She says that Renault has promised to get her and her husband out of Casablanca, but she wants to know if Renault is a man of his word. Rick discovers that the woman has no money, and that Renault knows they are poor; she says her husband is currently gambling to try to afford the visas. Earlier in the film, it is hinted that Renault gives visas to young, desperate woman in exchange for sexual favours, and it becomes clear his intentions are the same with this woman. Rick’s more sentimental and heroic side comes through – he goes over to the husband and secretly tells him to bet on 22, he repeats himself so his dealer hears, and rigs the game. Again, Rick tells him to bet on 22, then leave with his winnings. The only witnesses are his own employees, so his secrecy and reputation as the cold, cynical saloon-owner remain in-tact.\n\nWhen Laszlo understands that the only way he and Ilsa can leave Casablanca is with the visas Rick has, he attempts to reason with him. Rick refuses, telling him, ‘ask your wife’. Their conversation is interrupted when the Nazi officers begin to sing ‘Die Wacht am Rhein’ – meaning ‘the watch on the Rhine’. The Rhineland area was a crucial industrial region of Germany; it formed a natural barrier between them and France, making it a crucial boarder to occupy too. This song shows the German’s pride in occupying this area, singing it to boast their power to the French-Moroccans in the bar. Laszlo orders the rest of the band to begin playing ‘La Marseillaise’ – the French national anthem – to honour occupied France. Rick nods to allow this to go on, and gradually, the rest of the crowd joins in to drown out the German song. This only confirms to Strasser that Laszlo cannot be stuck in Casablanca, and also confirms that Rick cannot be trusted. Embarrassed and defeated, Strasser orders that Renault closes the cafe on account of there being gambling. Comically, the roulette dealer walks over to hand Renault his winnings after ordering the cafe’s closure. This emphasises his corruption whilst also acting as comic relief.\n\nLaszlo leaves Ilsa that night to attend an Underground Resistance Meeting, so she takes the opportunity to try and reason with Rick herself. After pleading with him, she resorts to holding him at gun point, but Rick knows she can’t pull the trigger. She confesses she still loves him, and tells him why she left him in Paris. Rick agrees to help, leading her to believe he will get Laszlo to Lisbon, while she will stay with him in Casablanca. The Underground Resistance Meeting is infiltrated, so Laszlo and Carl retreat to the cafe. However, the police catch up to Laszlo and arrest him for a minor offence.\n\nThe next morning, Rick tells Renault that Laszlo won’t face much jail time for his minor crime, so promises to set him up for having possession of the letters of transit, which would implicate him in the murder of the German couriers. Rick tells Renault he will give Laszlo and Ilsa the letters and help them escape, leading an audience to believe he will allow Renault to arrest Laszlo – during the meeting in the cafe that night, Rick pulls a gun on Renault instead, forcing him to help Laszlo and Ilsa escape. Instead of calling the airport, he calls Major Strasser to inform him of the plan.\n\nAt the airport, Rick convinces Ilsa to join Laszlo in Lisbon, or she will regret it: ‘Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.’ As the plane begins to ascend, Strasser tries to stop their departure, but Rick shoots him dead. The police show up, and it would appear as though Renault will turn Rick in, but instead, tells the police to ‘gather the usual suspects’. The last scene presents Rick as the patriotic, sentimentalist he is, and Renault as the now patriot in support of freeing France.\n\nWho made the film? Does the film hold a significant place in film history?\n\nCasablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) was made in the Golden Age of Hollywood during WWII. The film was set in December, 1941 – the month of the attack on Pearl Harbour. The film was released a year after the event, so there was still hate for the German and their allies among the allied populations. Pearl Harbour catalysed the American involvement in the war, bringing them out of political neutrality. This story of neutrality to patriotism is similar to Rick’s story. Rick began as a selfish, bitter man in the unoccupied Casablanca. He states several times that he ‘stick[s] [his] neck out for no one’, and doesn’t care about politics. Ilsa had convinced him that just because one woman hurt him, it doesn’t mean the rest of the world should suffer if Laszlo’s resistance doesn’t reach America. By the end of the film, he inserted himself in the centre of the fight by murdering Major Strasser, becoming a self-sacrificing patriot who was actively against the Nazi war effort. Ilsa’s appearance was unexpected and mortifying, just as the attack on Pearl Harbour was. Rick and Ilsa don’t have their ‘happily ever after’, but it is necessary for the resistance that Laszlo and Ilsa escape together. It shows that, in order to succeed, there has to be sacrifices.\n\nHow is the story told? Do the filmmakers use any interesting techniques to convey information to the audience? How is the narrative structured?\n\nThe story is based on truth, and characters are used to represent certain parts of history (as mentioned above). As is typical of Hollywood at the time, the film’s central theme is romance. In the film, there was a clear anti-German theme consistent throughout – the neutral Rick had turned to a patriot after letting Laszlo escape, and after murdering the Nazi Major Strasser, Renault had sided with the resistance by the end and Laszlo had escaped. This film provided some hope for Americans in the war, especially after Pearl Harbour. Films such as these that highlighted the victories of the allies were common during and after the war.\n\nWhat was your personal reaction to the film? Which sequences were particularly effective or enjoyable? What do you think the filmmakers wanted to say?\n\nThroughout the film, I found the relationship between Rick and Renault to be humorous, and somewhat entertaining. Despite both only being concerned with their own interests, and were constantly at odds, they managed to work together by the end. Renault had no loyalties in the beginning – he obeyed Strasser whilst simultaneously defending Rick, but by the end, he defended Rick by allowing Strasser’s murder to be a mystery to the police. By the end, Rick and Renault’s relationship was more akin to friendship than a mutually beneficial, corrupt association. The ending is important for many reasons. Particularly because Rick let Ilsa go, showing that, in order to win, there needed to be sacrifices, many of which were made during WWII.\n\nWhat is your ★★★☆☆ rating?\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the film. I have begun to like older films, especially war films (for example, The Hunt For Red October (John McTiernan, 1990), and Ice Cold in Alex (J Lee Thompson, 1959)). I enjoyed Casablanca for its theme of war and politics, but not for its base in romance. I would rate in 4.5 stars.\n\nDate: 04/11/22"
