        "text": "One of the odder artifacts in the recent relative trickle of titles from Screen Classics by Demand — Sony’s low-profile manufacture-on-demand program — has been the recent, belated DVD debut of Ross Hunter’s musical remake of “Lost Horizon” (1973), which receives far more loving treatment than you’d expect from one of the most notorious flops in the history of Columbia Pictures.\n\nCopious special features on a feature released through a program where they’ve previously been unknown seems a tipoff that this campy curio — which has acquired a cult following — was intended for a regular retail release before the bottom fell out of the market for deep-catalogue DVDs.\n\nThis update of the 1937 Frank Capra classic is listed in Harry Medved and Randy Dreyfuss’ 1978 book “The Fifty Worst Films Of All Time (And How They Got that Way)” alongside such other 1970s fiascos as “Myra Breckinridge,” “At Long Last Love,” “Zabriskie Point,” “Jonathan Livingston Seagull,” “The Last Movie,” “The Trail of Billy Jack” and “Airport 1975.” It’s described, not inaccurately, in the book’s index as “a bumbling, big-budget remake, with inspid Burt Bacharach songs and a vision of Shangri-La as a village of tap-dancing school children.”\n\nAlmost universally derided from critics running the gamut from Red Reed (“the photography would be laughed off the screen at a campfire briefing for the National Forestry Service convention at Knott’s Berry Farm”) to Pauline Kael (“banal…wan…flatulent”), this typically great-looking transfer of a 146-minute version restores previously deleted material including a decidedly homoerotic “fertility dance” with near-naked male dancers reportedly cut after it was laughed off the screen at its Tinseltown premiere (the ghastly choreography is credited to the great Hermes Pan, with cinematography by Robert Surtees).\n\nPeter Finch and Michael York have Ronald Colman and John Howard’s old roles as a British diplomat and his hot-headed journalist brother. They’re fleeing a more-or-less contemporary Southern Asian revolution in the opening scenes, which track the Capra original fairly closely. Sally Kellerman, George Kennedy and Bobby Van (in roughly the parts played by Margo, Thomas Mitchell and Edward Everett Horton) are refugees they evacuate in a plane that jets hijacked so they can be surrepticously flown to the legendary Shangri-La.\n\nIt’s there that things start to seriously go wrong, and the singing starts. John Gielgud in yellowface has H.B. Warner’s old role (Toshiro Mifune turned it down) as Shangri-La’s chief factotum, who speaks entirely in fortune-cookie aphorisms (as does the High Lama, played with a straight face by Charles Boyer). The other locals in the monastery — which, as designed by longtime MGM hand Preston Ames, more closely resembles a ’70s resort hotel than Stephen Goosoon’s superb sets for the Capra version — include Liv Ullman (whose singing is dubbed), in for Jane Wyatt and ballerina Olivia Hussey, in the part so memorably played by Isabell Jewell.\n\nPoor Peter Finch — his songs delivered as voice-overs by a ghost singer — looks so weary (even when he’s not trudging through California mountains standing in for the Himalayas) that it’s hard to forget he would die of a heart attack just three years later, while campaigning (with posthumous success) for a Best Actor Oscar for “Network.”\n\nDirected by Charles Jarrott (“Anne of the Thousand Days”) from a script by playwright Larry Kramer (“The Normal Heart”), “Lost Horizon” is so unremittingly silly that even its anti-war message (something that was minimized in wartime resissues of the Capra version) couldn’t help it find an audience.\n\nYou can sense the desperation in a 10-minute promotional film visiting the film’s locations, hosted by producer Ross Hunter, the maestro of ’50s and ’60s “women’s films” who had made a big comeback with “Airport” (1970) that ended with “Lost Horizon.” There are also 45 minutes’ worth of Hunter introducing scenes for another, “unfinished” promotional film.\n\nThe unusually ambitious DVD also includes a number of audio tracks, including songs that were cut from the film. Nearly 40 years after the fact, “Lost Horizon” is a vaguely endearing mistake.\n\nIn other camp classic news, Shout! Factory is releasing Frank Perry’s howler “Monsignor” (1982), starring Christopher Reeve as an American priest who becomes the Vatican’s treasurer and strikes a deal with the Mafia, on Jan. 31. Genevieve Bujold, Jason Miller, Fernando Rey and Joe Pantoliano star in this unintentionally hilarious feature, the latest catalogue title licensed from Fox.\n\nWarner Home Video today announced that a three-disc 70th Anniversary gift set “Casablanca”(including both Blu-ray and DVD) will be released on March 24. The set includes a whopping 14 hours of bonus material, with two new documentaries including one on “Michael Curtiz, the Best Director You’ve Never Heard Of” as well as Richard Schickel’s five-hour 2008 mini-series on the history of Warner Bros. and Cass Warner’s feature-length documentary on her family, “The Brothers Warner.”\n\nThe set will include a 60-page production art book as well as a reproduction of a French poster and four collectible drink coasters and lists for $65 (Amazon is taking pre-orders for $49). Most likely there will be a less elaborate edition down the road; Warner today released a slimmed-down, two-disc Blu-ray digibook edition of last fall’s “Citizen Kane” for $35 at Amazon. I’m hearing that “The Magnificent Ambersons,” which is still available on DVD exclusively at Amazon as part a bundle with the more elaborate earlier “Citizen Kane” set, will be getting a wide release later this year, possibly on Blu-ray.\n\nAlso on March 27, Sony will release “The Three Stooges Ultimate Collection” on DVD, apparently a tie-in with Fox’s new “Three Stooges” movie. It collects the nearly 200 Stooges shorts (1934-1959) released in Sony’s previous collections. Though nothing has been officially announced — it’s listed on Amazon for pre-orders — there’s online speculation that the 20 discs may include three discs of bonus material.\n\nParamount will be offering a Blu-ray upgrade on Alfred Hitchcock’s “To Catch a Thief” on March 6.\n\nThere will be no DVD Extra column next week; I’m heading to the Sundance Film Festival. But my review of Paramount’s splendid Blu-ray of William Wellman’s Oscar-winning “Wings” (1927) will appear online and in the print edition next Sunday."
