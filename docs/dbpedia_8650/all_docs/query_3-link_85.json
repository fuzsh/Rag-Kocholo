        "text": "Chaotic. Colorful. Eye-opening. Visiting Morocco is an intense experience. My time there was challenging, but it was also a reminder that the best part of travel is embracing the uncomfortable.\n\nOnce part of the Carthaginian Empire, the first independent Moroccan state emerged around 225 BCE as the Berber kingdom of Mauretania. That kingdom eventually became a Roman province, though, by the 7th century CE, Muslim conquest of North Africa was in full swing. A French Protectorate from 1912-1956, Morocco gained its independence in 1956 and has been an independent state ever since.\n\nI loved my time in Morocco. I gorged on couscous, drank my body weight in mint tea, hiked, and absorbed the hectic sights and sounds of the country.\n\nFrom the high Atlas Mountains to the desert to the coasts, Morocco is a marvelous country that mesmerizes. True, the sprawling and disorderly medinas can test your patience, but they reward your senses each and every visit.\n\nUse this Morocco travel guide to plan your trip, see the best the country has to offer, save money, and avoid the common pitfalls that waylay unsuspecting travelers!"
