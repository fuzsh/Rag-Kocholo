        "text": "Compare how far your chosen films reflect the auteur signature features of their filmmakers.\n\nThe definition of an auteur is “a film director who influences their films so much that they rank as their author.” André Bazin was a film critic in France during the 1940s who was the first person to use the word ‘auteur’. André Bazin thought that directors should engage personally with the filmmaking process.\n\nCasablanca (Curtiz, 1942) was made in 1942, during World War Two, and is a love story between Rick and Ilsa who met in Paris and are reunited in Casablanca. Rick realises Ilsa has a husband and the narrative follows Rick and Ilsa reminisce over their past and Rick helps Ilsa and Laszlo to escape Casablanca. Casablanca is a film that is made during the era when Hollywood studio systems were in control of what was being made, this era is also called Classical Hollywood. The studio had control over the directors and actors so there was no experimental films being released. The films produced were also strict due to the Hayes Code, which meant no violence, blasphemy or sexuality can be shown on screen. The studio Casablanca was under was Warner Brothers.\n\nWarner Brothers had a specific house style that is used in each film that is made by the studio. The house style of Warner Bros focuses on: urban settings, snappy dialogue and a brisk pace, with scripts and performances that never stray into sentimentality. At the time many studios chose their main actors and actresses due to their looks. Warner Bros main cast were chosen due to their large personalities, which was often portrayed on-screen. Warner Bros films, therefore, always felt more authentic which was what captured a lot of people to watch Warner Bros films. Trademark films for Warner Bros were gangster films, action-adventure films and hard-hitting films. So whilst Curtiz was not an auteur, Warner Bros had a specific style like an auteur would.\n\nBonnie and Clyde (Penn, 1967) is about two lovers, Bonnie and Clyde, who start robbing banks together and end up on the run around the south of America. Bonnie and Clyde is a film made during the French New Wave. After the collapse of the main studio system, directors took influence from new movement, the main movement at the time was the French New Wave. Jean-Luc Goddard is known as the pioneer of the movement and it was created due to film critics not liking how films were not as innovative as they wanted to be. The aim of the French New Wave was that the filmmakers wanted to show real life through a different way of filmmaking.\n\nPenn took a lot of influence from the French New Wave. The film critics who created the movement wanted to be experimental as they were fed up of films not being innovative and for the first time sex and violence were made obvious in films. The continuity of the editing was not as important and filmmakers were encouraged to show off their skill rather than keep the narrative structure. The camera movement they used was more unorthodox to make the film more eccentric, actors also broke the fourth wall in films. All of these new techniques were used to break the boundaries of film. Directors of this period included Jean-Luc Godard. Whilst Penn was not an auteur, he stole a lot of ideas from French New Wave auteurs for his film Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nIn Casablanca, establishing shots are used at the beginning of most scenes. At the beginning of the film, there are close up shots of the market place and people selling items and going about their daily business. Establishing shots are used in Casablanca to set the scene to the audience and close-ups are used to show the exact location. This was typical of Warner Bros House Style as by showing an establishing shot this keeps the narrative logic of the film. Establishing shots were the most common way of opening a scene in the Warner Bros House Style. Michael Curtiz often liked to open his films with high crane shots to establish the story environment and Curtiz’s films were produced under Warner Bros, showing that establishing shots are typical of Warner Bros House Style.\n\nExtreme long shots are used to set the scene in Bonnie and Clyde. When Clyde meets Bonnie’s family for the first time on the hill, the scene and setting are established by using extreme long shots. This shows the location as a whole but does not establish what the scene will exactly look like, this is unlike Casablanca where close-ups are vital during establishing shots to show the audience the exact location. This links to the French New Wave movement as film directors wanted to show locations in different way and not use the normal narrative structure of opening every new location with an establishing shot to be experimental. Establishing shots were not used in French New Wave films to increase the pace of the film.\n\nNon-diegetic composed scores are used often in Casablanca. One example of when a composed score is used is when Rick, Ilsa and Laszlo are driving to the airport and the score is used to create tension. Non-diegetic composed scores are used to set the scene and mood so the audience can expect what is to come in the scene. This links to Warner Bros House Style as the composer, Max Steiner, as he wanted to create dramatic, memorable scores that matched the themes and characters on the screen.\n\nThis is different to Bonnie and Clyde as there are not many non-diegetic composed scores, this is specifically noticeable in the end scene where Bonnie and Clyde are being shot and all you can hear is the gun shots. This is so the audience is faced with the reality of the scene and what is happening. Non-diegetic composed scores are not needed in Bonnie and Clyde to set the mood as the mood is set through the action on the screen. This links to the French New Wave as directors liked to be experimental by playing with non-diegetic sounds and diegetic sounds to get a reaction out of the audience.\n\nIn Casablanca, the performances from the actors are very theatrical. This is shown when the German airplane reaches Casablanca and the German and French converse. The actors stick to the script so there is no improvisation and this gives a linear performance from the actors. The dialogue is only used to keep the story going and is not for effect. The Warner Bros House Style never wanted the performance to stray into sentimentality, which is why the performances in Casablanca are linear yet theatrical.\n\nIn contrast, Bonnie and Clyde uses improvisation to make the story seem more realistic. Bonnie and Clyde often talk over each other, this is shown when they met for the first time outside Bonnie’s house. This makes a realistic performance unlike Casablanca as the performance is a lot more staged. During the French New Wave, the Hayes Code was broken which is why performances could become much more realistic as it was more common for actors to swear in films. The French New Wave wanted to be experimental and not stick to the script, which is why Bonnie and Clyde is a more of a realistic performance than Casablanca. Warren Beatty, producer and lead actor in Bonnie and Clyde, was well known for improvisation and he started the trend of improvisation among other star actors.\n\nIn Casablanca editing throughout the film is not used for effect but to tell the story. In the beginning scene when the man is shot, there is a reaction shot to tell the audience how to feel after the event. This type of editing is called continuity editing and is used to tell the narrative in an order that is easy to understand. This links to Warner Bros House Style as editing was only used to keep the narrative going.\n\nAt the end of Bonnie and Clyde when the two robbers are getting shot, the violent sequence was extended and shown in slow motion. This is to make the audience face the death of the two main characters. Editor Dede Allen was the pioneer of experimental editing, including the use of J-cuts and audio overlaps, this links to the French New Wave as the directors who started this movement wanted filmmakers to be experimental with their films and show off their skills.\n\nHumphrey Bogart, who plays Rick in Casablanca, was well-known for being in noir films. Rick is shown in film noir lighting for example when we see Rick for the first time in his cafe. This links to the Warner Bros House Style as the studio liked to show off their actors for what they are most well known for and to highlight what Humphrey Bogart is most famous for as people would want to watch Casablanca to see him. Cinematographer Arthur Edeson was well known for filming the first noir style film and Edeson utilises this to show off Bogart for what he is known for.\n\nBonnie and Clyde is influenced by French New Wave. Unlike Casablanca, the film is not based around one actor but a movement. The difference between the two films is that people would watch Bonnie and Clyde for the narrative and not solely for the actors. This links to the French New Wave as directors were encouraged to show off their skills, meaning that the actors were less important than they were in the Warner Bros House Style.\n\nTo conclude whilst Curtiz and Penn are not auteurs, their films follow a specific style like an auteur would even though this style of auteurship is not the norm. The work of Arthur Edeson, Max Steiner, Jack Warner and Michael Curtiz as well as the Warner Bros House Style makes the film follow a specific style which makes all of these factors an auteur. Arthur Penn was inspired by the French New Wave movement and his film is his take on the movement. With the help from Dede Allen and Warren Beatty, Penn created a film which was influenced by many auteurs in the French New Wave movement. Therefore the films do have signature auteur features but not the conventional features of an auteur film.\n\nCompare how far your chosen films reflect their different production contexts\n\nBetween 1930-1990 there were two main characteristics of film, Classical Hollywood and “New” Hollywood. Classical Hollywood was between 1930-1960 and the main aspect of Classical Hollywood was the studio system. The studio system took control over actors through unbreakable contracts that actors had to sign when joining a studio. The studio also took over the types of films that were being made. There were 5 big studios and 3 little studios that created the majority of the films. They included 20th Century Fox which was well-known for The Grapes of Wrath (Ford, 1940) and Warner Bros which was well-known for Casablanca (Curtis, 1942). There were key components that were used in this period that were recognisable for Classical Hollywood films. These included continuity editing, narrative logic by having a beginning, middle and end and cinematic space; this is knowing that the scene exists outside the shot of the cinematic frame to maintain the picture’s realism.\n\n“New” Hollywood was between 1960-1990 and was influenced by the French New Wave. Filmmakers started to take risks with the narrative structure and the way the films are filmed, for example filmmakers did not also use the classic narrative structure to make their films. After the decline of the major studios, filmmakers started experimenting with French New Wave films which caused a rise in independent studios and cinemas to show off this new style of Hollywood. After the major studios saw the rise in independent studios and the popularity of the French New Wave style of films, the studios started to hire new and risky filmmakers to keep up with the rise of independent cinema.\n\nCasablanca was made in 1942, during World War Two, and is a love story between Rick and Ilsa who met in Paris and are reunited in Casablanca. Rick realises Ilsa has a husband and the narrative follows Rick and Ilsa reminiscing over their past and Rick decides to help Ilsa and Laszlo to escape Casablanca. Whilst the film was not significant at the time it was created, Casablanca is a significant film now as it is shown as the classic and perfect Hollywood love story.\n\nBonnie and Clyde (Penn, 1967) is about two lovers, Bonnie and Clyde, who start robbing banks together and end up on the run around the south of America. Unlike Casablanca, this film was significant during the time it was released and is less significant now. This is because the amount of violence, sexuality and blasphemy had never been seen before in a film during the 1960s whilst now people are used to seeing this type of violence, sexuality and blasphemy.\n\nIn Casablanca, establishing shots are used at the beginning of most scenes. At the beginning of the film, there are close up shots of the market place and people selling items and going about their daily business. Establishing shots are used in Casablanca to set the scene to the audience and close-ups are used to show the exact location. This links to the Warner Bros House Style as establishing shots were used when a new location was shown to the audience to keep the narrative logic of the film. Establishing shots were the most common way of opening a scene in the Warner Bros House Style.\n\nExtreme long shots are used to set the scene in Bonnie and Clyde. When Clyde meets Bonnie’s family for the first time on the hill, the scene and setting are established by using extreme long shots. This shows the location as a whole but does not establish what the scene will exactly look like, this is unlike Casablanca where close-ups are vital during establishing shots to show the audience the exact location. This links to the French New Wave movement as film directors wanted to show locations in different way and not use the normal narrative structure of opening every new location with an establishing shot to be experimental. Establishing shots were not used in French New Wave films to increase the pace of the film.\n\nFraming is important in Casablanca as it is used to show the audience everything they need to know in one shot so no information is hidden. This is done when the German plane lands in Casablanca and the airplane is framed inside the gateway and the gateway is framed by the trees. The way framing is done in Casablanca also makes the shots aesthetically pleasing. Shots were also framed to make the actors look aesthetically pleasing which links to the Warner Bros House Style as the actors were the main focus of the film so they had to be framed to look aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe shots in Bonnie and Clyde were not framed as aesthetically pleasingly as Casablanca as the framing is not thought out and there is no symmetry. This is because the camera is framed to capture the action in Bonnie and Clyde whilst in Casablanca the camera is framed to make the actors look good. Not framing the shots to look aesthetically pleasing is a technique used in the French New Wave as instead camera movement was used to make the shot aesthetically pleasing, which is also seen in Bonnie and Clyde. Whilst framing does not add anything to the scene in French New Wave films, adding camera movement makes a closed scene seem open and makes the audience feel like they can explore the scene more.\n\nNon-diegetic composed scores are used often in Casablanca. One example of when a composed score is used is when Rick, Ilsa and Laszlo are driving to the airport to create tension. Non-diegetic composed scores are used to set the scene and mood so the audience can expect what is to come in the scene.\n\nThis is different to Bonnie and Clyde as there are not many non-diegetic composed scores, this is specifically noticeable in the end scene where Bonnie and Clyde are being shot and all you can hear is the gun shots. This is so the audience is faced with the reality of the scene and what is happening. Non-diegetic composed scores are not needed in Bonnie and Clyde to set the mood as the mood is set through the action on the screen.\n\nIn Casablanca, the performances from the actors are very theatrical. This is shown when the German airplane reaches Casablanca and the German and French converse. The actors stick to the script so there is no improvisation and this gives a linear performance from the actors. The dialogue is only used to keep the story going and is not for effect. The Warner Bros House Style never wanted the performance to stray into sentimentality, which is why the performances in Casablanca are linear yet theatrical.\n\nIn contrast, Bonnie and Clyde uses improvisation to make the story seem more realistic. Bonnie and Clyde often talk over each other, this is shown when they met for the first time outside Bonnie’s house. This makes a realistic performance unlike Casablanca as the performance is a lot more staged. During the French New Wave, the Hayes Code was broken which is why performances could become much more realistic as it was more common for actors to swear in films. The French New Wave wanted to be experimental and not stick to the script, which is why Bonnie and Clyde is a more of a realistic performance than Casablanca.\n\nIlsa’s performance makes her seem like a lady. For example when she comes into Rick’s Cafe for the first time with Laszlo, she is only spoken when spoken to and does not step out of line. She also never uses vulgar language and is a prim and proper. In the Warner Bros House Style, the Hayes Code was still in use which is why Ilsa does not swear.\n\nBonnie is not shown as a lady in Bonnie and Clyde. She always uses vulgar language and does not speak or act like a lady. This is shown when she stands out of the window naked in the first scene when speaking to Clyde. Unlike Curtiz in Casablanca, Penn could get away with making Bonnie unladylike as he did not have to stick to the Hayes Code.\n\nIn the first scene of Casablanca, the immigrant was shot by the police but no blood was shown from the shot wound. This is because violence was not shown during this era as it would shock the viewers and it was against the Hayes Code.\n\nThis is the opposite in Bonnie and Clyde as violent is shown. For example when Clyde shoots the policeman in the face after robbing the bank, there is blood shown everywhere on the window. Blood and violence is now shown due to the decline in the studio system and the Hayes Code.\n\nIn Casablanca editing throughout the film is not used for effect but to tell the story. In the beginning scene when the man is shot, there is a reaction shot to tell the audience how to feel after the event. This type of editing is called continuity editing and is used to tell the narrative in an order that is easy to understand.\n\nAt the end of Bonnie and Clyde when the two robbers are getting shot, the violent sequence was extended and shown in slow motion. This is to make the audience face the death of the two main characters. This style is reminiscent of the French New Wave and something that would not have been done in Casablanca.\n\nHumphrey Bogart, who plays Rick in Casablanca, was well-known for being in noir films. Rick is shown in film noir lighting for example when we see Rick for the first time in his cafe. This is to highlight what Humphrey Bogart is most famous for as people would want to watch Casablanca to see him.\n\nBonnie and Clyde is influenced by French New Wave. Unlike Casablanca, the style of film is not based around one actor but a movement. This means that whilst people would come and see Casablanca to watch Humphrey Bogart in a style that he is most well-known for; people would come and see Bonnie and Clyde for the narrative.\n\nThroughout Casablanca Rick is seen as a classy gentleman. He is always dressed and speaks nicely and is lovely to ladies but is also shown as a dominant character, for example he tells the drunk lady to go home from his Cafe, this shows how he is caring but also dominant in telling her what to do. Rick’s characteristics fit the stereotypical male characteristics of that era.\n\nClyde is shown as not to be a gentleman throughout Bonnie and Clyde. This is shown when Bonnie takes Clyde to meet her family and Clyde speaks to Bonnie’s mother with his mouth full of food. He also does not turn away when Bonnie is naked at her window when they meet for the first time. This shows that Clyde is represented in an opposite way to Rick.\n\nCasablanca was made during World War 2 and the narrative takes great influence on the war. The idea of Casablanca came from Jack Warner hearing about refugees being held up in Casablanca to escape the Nazi Rule. Casablanca is therefore propaganda for the war. Rick is the embodiment of USA’s first reluctance to enter the war. He was a neutral character in the beginning of the film as he does not care what happens to Ilsa whilst at the end of the film he does something for the good of someone else, by letting Ilsa and Laszlo go to America without Rick. This reflects USA’s entry into World War 2.\n\nArthur Penn, who directed Bonnie and Clyde, stated that the Vietnam War influenced his film. Unlike Curtiz and Warner Bros, who wanted to show that going into war was the best thing to do, Penn stated that people needed to view guns as terrifying instruments which is why guns are shown so often in Bonnie and Clyde. The violence in the end scene reflects a mood of pessimism after a summer of riots and rising death toll in Vietnam War.\n\nCasablanca was produced as a way for people to escape everyday life. During the time Casablanca was filmed and showed in cinemas, America had just had the Great Depression and are now involved in a world war. Film was used to escape the depression and cinema was the key leisure activity at the time.\n\nBonnie and Clyde was targeted at the baby boomer generation. This is because this generation was more rebellious and they were anti-establishment, often questioning the values of their parents generation. Warner Bros initially gave this film a short release but it gained popularity and on its second release it was a huge hit.\n\nOverall, Casablanca was not a significant film at the time it was released but over time it has turned into a more significant film. This is due to the fact that Casablanca is seen as a classic Hollywood romance film. In this era, audiences do not often see classic Hollywood romance films so this is why Casablanca is more significant now than it was when it was released. However, Bonnie and Clyde was a significant film during the time it was released it was a significant film because it was one of the first films that went against the Hayes Code and towards the “New” Hollywood style of film. Whilst now, much more films have been influenced by the French New Wave and the “New” Hollywood style which makes the film less significant now than it was when it was released."
