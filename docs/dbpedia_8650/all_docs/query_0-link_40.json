Jones RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, RURAL LIFE COUNCIL TUSKEGEE INSTITUTE Associate Editor Woodrow Hall Chief Editorial Assistant New York WM. H. WISE & CO., ING. t. 5 Copyright, 1952 Tuskegee Institute 10521 PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA • ' « ' ' , I * ' f K - •« » » -'- «.» »_T:f.,{> Jfff J»»««»» Preface THE NEGRO YEAR BOOK dates back to 1912, when the late Booker T. Washington, founder and first principal of Tuskegee Institute, gave $1,000 to publish the first edition as a service to the public. This sum was the residue of a fund donated for the purpose of collecting and circulating information favorable to the Negro. It was expected that there would be only one edition; however, the NEGRO YEAR BOOK met a wide and continued demand. This volume is the eleventh edition to be issued over a forty-year period. The late Monroe N. Work, founder and director of the Tuskegee Institute Department of Records and Research from 1908 through 1938, was editor of the first nine editions. For the forty years of its publication, the NEGRO YEAR BOOK has been extensively used as a reference by agencies, educational institu- tions, and individuals who desired readily accessible historical and sociological information on the Negro. It is specially adapted for use in schools, libraries, and other agencies where basic and current infor- mation assembled in convenient form in one volume is desired. The 1952 edition of the NEGRO YEAR BOOK brings together facts about various aspects of Negro life and about the participation of Negroes in American life. Also reported are facts about economic, social, political, and educational progress of Negroes in other parts of the world. Where necessary, information covers the period 1947 to 1951, and earlier. Other information covers only 1951. It will be noted that in some tables large figures are rounded off. The chapters of the NEGRO YEAR BOOK have been prepared by con- tributors who are authorities in their fields. Users of this volume will find it well organized for ready reference. A new feature is the use of pictures to highlight newsworthy events, mainly for the year 1951. 111 Contributors BRISCOE, SHERMAN, M.A. — Information Specialist, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.

The legal definition of \"Negro\" varies widely and may be embodied in general statutes, legislation regulating social con- tacts in specified situations, or in court interpretations. The legal definition may vary within a state, one definition being used to regulate school attendance and another to regulate intermarriage. That this does not result in more confusion than it does is due largely to the fact that social relationships are regulated by the social definition, without reference to the legal definition. The social definition of \"Negro\" may be expressed as: \"Everyone having a known trace of Negro blood in his veins,\" no matter how far back it was acquired. Thus, the social definition is dependent upon community knowledge of racial an- cestry, with or without physical racial visibility. The U. S. Census employs a color classi- fication of white and nonwhite for pur- poses of enumeration, with the nonwhite category sub-divided into Negroes, In- dians (American), Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, Hindus, and \"other\" nonwhite races. The Census relies heavily upon visi- bility and community definition in order to determine who shall be enumerated as a Negro. In case of mixed ancestry, per- sons of Negro and white ancestry are enumerated as Negroes ; persons of Negro and Indian, Chinese, or Japanese mixed ancestry are classified as Negroes, except where regarded as .Indian, Chinese, or Japanese by the community. The great majority of the nonwhite population, thus defined, consists of Negroes, except in the Pacific states, where there are many Chi- nese and Japanese, and in Oklahoma and certain Mountain states, where many of the nonwhites are Indians. Since the Cen- sus is the principal source of data regard- ing the Negro population, the definition used therein is the one under which prac- tically all the information in this section was collected. In citing 1950 figures, or in comparing 1940 and 1950 figures, \"non- white\" will be used interchangeably with \"Negro\" where separate data for Negroes are not yet available. In the 1950 Census, there were 15,482,000 nonwhites, of whom 14,894,000 or 96.2% were Negroes. POPULATION GROWTH Number and Rate of Increase In the 60 years between 1890 and 1950, the Negro population has doubled, in- creasing from 7,488,676 to approximately TABLE 1 NUMBER AND RATE OF INCREASE OF NEGRO POPULATION, 1890-1950 Census Year Number Per Cent of Per Cent Total Pop.

While there has been an ab- solute increase in Negro population in 1 This section was prepared in collaboration with Carrell Peterson, Instructor and Research Associate in Sociology, Fisk University. POPULATION every decade, the proportion which Ne- groes form of the total population has declined from 11.9% in 1890 to approxi- mately 9.8% in 1950. Yet, in spite of this declining proportion of Negroes, the per- centage increase of Negroes during the 1940-50 decade was almost twice that of the 1930-40 decade (15.1% against 8.2%), and was greater than the per- centage increase of the total population, which was 14.5%. This was the largest percentage increase of Negroes since the 1890-1900 decade, when the Negro popu- lation increased 18%. See Table 1. Regions, Divisions, and States During the 1940-50 decade, there was a definite shift of Negro population away from the South to the industrial areas of the North and West. The white popula- tion in 13 Southern states1 increased be- tween 1940 and 1950 by approximately 16%, while the nonwhite population in- creased by only one-half of 1%. On the other hand, in eight major industrial states outside the South2 the white popu- lation increased approximately 14% while the nonwhite population increased by almost 55%. Seven Southern states (Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Geor- gia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Texas) had actual declines in nonwhite population, while none declined in white population. In 1940, the southern Negro population was about 33% of the total southern pop- ulation, while the corresponding per- centage for 1950 was 30%. The number of nonwhites in the North and West increased about 50% between 1940 and 1950. In 1950, one-third of the nonwhite population of the United States was living in either the North or the West. Growth of the nonwhite population was particularly marked in the West. Between 1940 and 1950, the nonwhite population increased 74.3% in the West. Whereas in 1900 almost 90% of the Negro population lived in the South, in 1940 this was true of only 77% of the Negro population. In 1950, only slightly more than two-thirds of the Negro population lived in the South. See Table 2. Urban and Rural Negroes are increasingly becoming city- dwellers. Since 1900, the percentage of Negro urban dwellers has increased stead- ily in every decade in every region except the West, where the percentage of Ne- groes who were urban decreased between 1910 and 1920. Between 1900 and 1940, the percentage of Negoes who were urban dwellers increased from about 16 to 36% in the South, 54 to 84% in the West, and 62 to 90% in the North. In 1950, approxi- mately 93% of northern Negroes, 47% of southern Negroes, and 92% of Negroes in the West were urban dwellers. Approxi- mately 61% of the total Negro population was urban in 1950. Part of this increase may be due to changes in the Census definition of \"urban\" and \"rural,\" but there has undoubtedly been a significant increase in the proportion of Negro urban dwellers. Standard Metropolitan Areas by Color' The total population of standard metro- politan areas in the United States on April 1, 1950, 84,500,680, represented an increase of 15,224,199, or 22.0%, over the 69,276,481 in- habitants of these areas in 1940, according to figures from the Seventeenth Decennial Cen- sus released (Dec. 16, 1951) by Roy V. Peel, Director, Bureau of the Census, Department of Commerce. The white population of these 168 standard metropolitan areas increased at a slightly lower rate (20.0%) than the total population. For the nonwhite population, however, the rate of increase during the decade was 44.3%. The number of nonwhite persons in standard metropolitan areas, 8,250,814, represented about 9.8% of all per- sons in these areas in 1950 as compared with 8.3% in 1940. Between 1940 and 1950, the nonwhite popu- lation more than doubled in 30 standard met- ropolitan areas in the Northeast, North Cen- tral states, and the West.

POPULATION increase in many of these areas involved, of course, only a relatively small number of nonwhites. Nevertheless, the nonwhite popu- lation of standard metropolitan areas in the North (that is, the Northeast and the North Central States combined), and the West in- creased by almost 2 million during the decade. In all regions except the South, the per- centage increase in the nonwhite population of standard metropolitan areas exceeded the percentage increase in the white population. This excess was greatest in the standard met- ropolitan areas of the West, where the per- centage increase for nonwhites was 127.6% as compared with 48.9% for the white popu- lation. In the North, the nonwhite population of these areas increased by 58.2% and the white population by 11.1%. In the standard metropolitan areas of the South, however, the rate of increase of the white population exceeded that for the nonwhite population, 38.5 and 23.6%, respectively. These figures reflect the very substantial movements of the nonwhite population out of rural areas and out of the South during the decade. Table 3, which follows, shows the extent of this migra- tion from southern states to the North and West. Cities of 50,000 or More by Color The figures for cities of 50,000 or more, [Table 4] indicate greater variation in nu- merical and percentage increases for both the whites and nonwhites in the pattern of growth comparable figures for standard metropolitan areas. . . . Population growth has been rapid in both large cities and in their standard metropolitan areas since 1940. An increased proportion of persons living in these areas, except in the' South, are nonwhites. There was a marked difference between whites and nonwhites in the pattern of growth within standard metropolitan areas during the decade. The white population of the central cities in these areas increased from 39,217,502 in 1940 to 43,179,174 in 1950, an increase of 3,961,672, or 10.1%, whereas the increase outside of these cities was 35.9%. For the nonwhite population, in contrast, the increase within central cities (from 4,329,636 to 6,429,417, or 48.5%) exceeded the rate of growth in the remainder of the standard metropolitan areas (31.3% ).1 TABLE 3 POPULATION BY COLOR FOR STANDARD METROPOLITAN AREAS, 1950 AND 1940 (Minus sign denotes decrease.

population between 1940 and 1950 did not equal the natural increase that would be expected, a result of mi- gration. Between 1940 and 1947, Negro and white groups differed sharply in the dis- tance of their migration, Negroes gener- ally moving longer distances than whites. Migration rates for whites and nonwhites were very similar during this period, but about twice as many migrants among non- whites, moved to other states as moved within a state, while more white migrants moved within a state than moved to other states. Nor was the preponderance of migrants to noncontiguous states as great among whites as among nonwhites. Between 1935 and 1940, the nonwhite migration rate was only 0.70 of the rate for whites. Between 1940 and 1947, the corresponding ratio was 1.05. In the South, however, the nonwhite population was less mobile than its white counter- part. During the year April 1948 to April 1949, the entire nonwhite population was slightly less mobile than the white popu- lation. With respect to distance of migra- tion, only 40% of nonwhite migrants moved between states, as compared with 53% of white migrants. This suggests a return to the 1935-40 pattern of migration for nonwhites. See Table 5. Ratio of Males to Females The sex ratio (number of males per 100 females) has implications for mar- riage rates as well as for the reproduc- tive, social, and economic functions of a society. Males have been outnumbered by females in the Negro population for about 100 years. The number of Negro males per 100 females decreased from 97.0 in 1930 to 95.0 in 1940. Between 1930 and 1940, the increase in the number of Negro females was nearly 150,000 more then the increase in the number of Negro males. Population estimates for the periods 1940- 42 and 1946-48 show that the ratio of Negro males per 100 females was ap- proximately 96.2 for both periods. The 1950 sex ratio among the Negro popula- tion was 97.6. This was only slightly less than the sex ratio for the total popula- tion, which was 98.1. The 1950 sex ratio for the total population, however, repre- sented a 0.7 decline from 1940, while the 1950 sex ratio for the Negro population represented a 2.6 increase over 1940. When the sex ratio is considered by re- gions, Negro males outnumbered Negro females in the North-Central and Western regions. The number of Negro males per 100 females in 1950 was 90.8 in the Northeast, 100.4 in the North-Central re- gion, 97.9 in the South, and 104.6 in the West. Negro males in the age groups under 5 years, 5-9, 60-64, and 70-74 years outnum- bered Negro females in their respective TABLE 5 PER CENT DISTRIBUTION BY MIGRATION STATUS AND TYPE OF MIGRATION OF POPULATION BORN ON OR BEFORE BEGINNING OF MIGRATION PERIOD, BY COLOR (Civilian Population, April 1949 and 1947; Total Population, April 1940) Migration- Status and Type of Migration April 1948 to April 1949 April 1940 to April 1947 April 1935 to April 1940 White Nonwhite White Nonwhite White Nonwhite Nonmigrants 93.8 95.1 4.7 2.8 1.9 0.1 78.9 20.7 11.0 9.7 0.4 77.4 21.8 7.7 14.1 0.8 86.2 13.5 7.9 5.6 0.3 90.4 9.5 5.6 3.9 0.1 Migrants . . 5.9 Within a state 2.8 Between states 3.1 Abroad 0.4 Source: Current Population Reports: Population Characteristics, \"Internal Migration in the United States: April, 1948 to April, 1949,\" Series P-20, No. 28, Table 1. 12 POPULATION How Negro Population Is Spreading Over U.S. UP 412% age groups in 1950. In line with the trend for the total population, Negro females outnumbered males in the urban popula- tion, but were in the minority in the rural population. Age Composition The median age of the nonwhite popu- lation increased from 25.2 years in 1940 to 25.5 years in 1950, while the corre- sponding medians for the total population were 29.0 and 30.1 years, respectively. In both 1940 and 1950, approximately 57.6% of the nonwhite population was over 21 years of age. The median age of nonwhite males decreased 0.3 of a year during the 1940-50 decade (from 25.4 to 25.1 years), but the median age of nonwhite females increased during that same period 0.7 of a year (from 25.1 to 25.8 years). Rela- tively more nonwhite females were over 21 in 1950 than in 1940, while the reverse was true among nonwhite males. The 15-19 age group was the only one among nonwhites to show a percentage decrease between 1940 and 1950. Percent- age increases among nonwhites ranged from a 3% increase in the 30-34 age group to a 48.9% increase in the youngest age group, under 5 years. There were also © 1951, U.S. News Publishing Corp. relatively large increases in persons over 60. See Table 6. The Negro birth rate increased from 21.6 per 1000 persons in 1940 to 29.5 per 1000 persons in 1948. Occupation and Industry Traditionally concentrated in agricul- ture and domestic and personal service, it is apparent that the Negro occupational distribution is slowly approaching that of whites when classes of workers are com- pared. Table 7 shows the class of all workers and nonwhite workers in 1950 and 1940. It is worth noting that in the South the proportion of nonwhite work- ers employed by governmental agencies showed a sharp increase between 1940 and 1950; self-employed nonwhite work- ers showed an even sharper decrease. Table 8 shows the classifications into major occupation groups of all workers and nonwhite workers for the last two Census years. The number of nonwhite clerical workers tripled during these 10 years, and the sales workers, craftsmen, and operatives groups each doubled in size. The proportion of nonwhite private household workers fell from 21% in 1940 to 15% in 1950.

With respect to the number of Negroes in the labor force, the proportion has de- creased from 65.7% (of total Negro popu- lation) in 1920, to 55.2% in 1950. The proportion of Negroes 14 years old and over in the civilian labor force in 1950 was 54.5% as compared with 52.5% for whites. Approximately 4.6% of the Ne- groes and 2.6% of the whites were un- employed. For the South, a slightly greater proportion of Negroes than of whites in the labor force were currently unemployed. Between 1940 and 1950, there were several changes in the distribution of Negroes by major industrial groups. There were marked decreases in the proportion of Negroes in agriculture and the service industries and a marked increase in the number of Negroes in the manufacturing industry. The largest percentage of Ne- groes, however, was still in the service industries, while the largest percentage of white industrial workers was in manu- facturing and allied skills as shown in Table 9.

There were 2,815,000 nonwhite mar- ried couples in 1950 as compared with 2,408,691 in 1940. For both 1940 and 1930 data, nonwhites tended to marry at younger ages than whites, and relatively fewer nonwhites stayed single during the childbearing period. At nearly every age, however, a greater proportion of nonwhites were widowed than were whites. Table 11 shows marital status for 1940, with totals for 1930. In 1947, the proportion of nonwhite married couples who were living together was smaller than the corresponding white proportion, and relatively more nonwhite persons had had their marriages broken by widowhood or separation. There was a difference of approximately 10% in the percentage of white and nonwhite women (62 and 52%, respectively) 14 years old and over who were married and living with their husbands. The nonwhite popu- lation had an especially large proportion of persons who were married but living apart from their spouses. Approximately 2.6% of white women 14 years and over were in this category in 1947 as compared with 8.3% of nonwhite women 14 years and over. The proportion of divorced per- sons did not differ significantly for whites and nonwhites. Table 10 shows marital status in 1947. Among nonwhite females, the percent- age of divorced persons decreased from 2.1 in 1930 to 1.7 in 1940, but increased to 2.4 in 1947. The same pattern is evident among nonwhite males, the percentage of divorced nonwhite males being 1.4, 1.0, and 1.7 in 1930, 1940, and 1947, respec- tively. Among nonwhite males, the great- est proportion of divorced persons, 3.1%, was in the 35-44 age group, while the greatest proportion of divorced persons among nonwhite females, 4.0%, was in the 25-34 age group. There was very little relationship be- tween urban-rural residence and marital status among nonwhites in 1947. Between 1940 and 1950, there was a 29.9% increase in the number of non- white males 14 years old and over who were widowed and divorced (from 299,- 1 A married couple is defined as a husband and wife living together. 16 POPULATION TABLE 10 PER CENT DISTRIBUTION OF MARITAL STATUS OF PERSONS 14 YEARS AND OVER, FOR U.S. CIVILIAN POPULATION, APRIL 1947 (Per cent not shown where less than 0.1) Ever Married Sex, Color and Age Single Tot.

The corresponding percentage increase figures for white males and white females were 8.6 and 23.1 respectively. Population of Voting Age In 1940, Negroes made up 8.8% of the total population of voting age and 9.2% of the citizens of voting age. Between 1930 and 1940, the total number of Negroes of voting age increased 13.7% (from 6,531,939 to 7,427,938), although the pro- portion of Negroes in the total population of voting age declined 0.1%. According to age distribution of Negroes in 1950, 57.6% of the Negro population is old enough to vote, while 64.3% of the total population is over 21. These figures repre- sent a slight increase in the proportion of the total population of voting age be- tween 1940 and 1950, but the proportion of the Negro population of voting age re- mained stable during this period. Illegitimacy Changing methods of registering births have, in recent years, made reliable sta- tistics on illegitimacy difficult to obtain. In 1949, it was estimated that from 10 to 20% of Negro children born in urban areas were born out of wedlock, with even higher rates generally prevailing in rural areas. At that time, the illegitimacy rate among the Negro population was esti- mated to be from 5 to 10 times as high as that to be found among the white population.

Indeed, their achievements were so numer- ous and so outstanding that one may fairly say that a new highwater mark was reached. More Negro athletes than ever before attained stardom, and, at the same time, the trend toward integrated participation in sports accelerated con- siderably. There were more Negroes play- ing in the major and minor baseball leagues, and playing on more teams, than in 1950; more Negro basketball players than ever before starred on white college teams; there were significant gains in tennis, a definite step forward in bowling, notable advances in college and profes- sional football, continuing achievements in track and boxing, and scattered gains elsewhere. Without a doubt, 1951 was the \"big year\" of the Negro athlete. BASEBALL Players on Major League Teams In organized baseball the increasing stature of the Negro athlete has perhaps been dramatized more spectacularly than anywhere else. The sport, which until 1946 was rigidly barred to Negroes, has become the setting for some of his great- est exploits. Six of the 16 major league baseball teams employed a total of 18 Negro players — 11 as regular and seven as utility players (as compared with nine players on four teams in 1950). National League Brooklyn Dodgers : Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Don Newcombe, Dan Bank- head (part of season) New York Giants : Monte Irvin, Willie Mays, Raphael Noble, Henry Thompson. Boston Braves : Luis Marques, Sam Jethroe. American League Cleveland Indians : Larry Doby, Luke Easter, Harry Simpson, Sam Jones (part of season) Chicago White Sox : Orestes Minoso, Sam- uel Hairston, Bob Boyd (latter two for part of season) St. Louis Browns : Satchel Paige All of these players made significant contributions to their teams and most of them were star players. It is clearly signi- ficant of the important roles they played that five of these six teams were first divi- sion teams and serious pennant contend- ers, and that one of them, the New York Giants, won the National League Cham- pionship. On exactly half of these teams, the clean-up batter was a Negro: Irvin on the first-place (National League) New York Giants, Robinson on the second- place (National League) Brooklyn Dodg- ers, and Easter on the second-place (American League) Cleveland Indians. With respect to developing integration, it was equally significant that a few teams carried Negro utility players. Apparently it is no longer necessary for a Negro to be a super-star — a Jackie Robinson or a Roy Campanella — to make the team; if he is as good as other players he may hope to make the squad and be carried as a substitute (utility) player. To cap the season, the Giants played an all-Negro outfield in the World Series, the first time this has ever happened in either series or regular season play. Individual exploits by these players were too numerous to describe in detail. Jackie Robinson scaled new heights of achievement with his brilliant clutch fielding and clutch hitting, especially dur- ing the last two weeks of what turned out to be the most thrilling finale in Na- tional League history. He led the League 18 BASEBALL 19 in batting during the first third of the season, finished third in batting with .338 (the third straight year in which he has finished among the first five), and, in defying a series of injuries, earned from his manager, Chuck Dressen, the soubri- quet \"Old Blood and Guts.\" In addition he set a new National League fielding mark for second baseman of .992 (seven errors in 832 chances) and another record for participation in double plays (137). At the end of five full seasons of play, Robinson has a lifetime major league batting average of .320, preceded among currently active players only by the great stars Stan Musial and Ted Williams. It is now generally agreed that he is one of the greatest second basemen in history. He was chosen to lead the 1951 University of California at Los Angeles Homecoming Parade, the first athlete so chosen. Roy Campanella, in his fourth season, was fourth in League batting with a .325 average and second in runs batted in, and became the first catcher of all time to hit 20 or more home runs in three succes- sive seasons. He was voted the National League's Most Valuable Player of the Year by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, the second Negro to win this award (Jackie Robinson received it in 1949). He, too, is now ranked with the game's immortals and, in the opinion of the most outstanding experts, enjoyed the finest single year any catcher has ever known. The splendid showing of the New York Giants in the last phase of the 1950 sea- son led many experts to pick them for the 1951 championship — if Monte Irvin de- livered. He did, and the Giants won their first flag since 1937. He was their clean- up batter, led the League in runs batted in (121), and led his team in batting (.321). The comments of his manager, Leo Durocher, reflect Irvin's great team value: \"I must admit that the one guy who picked us up all the time was Monte Irvin. Through the stretch, he's the guy who would start us off, would get us the big hit and come through in the clutch.\" (New York IF or Id-Telegram, Sept. 29.) He received the third largest number of votes in the National League Most Valu- able Player poll. He starred in the World Series, as was expected of him. He stole home in the opening game, the first time this has occurred in 30 years. He led both teams in hitting (.458) and, with 11 hits, came within one hit of tying the record for most hits in a World Series. Two other Negroes, both first-year play- ers in the major leagues, performed sen- sationally. Willy Mays, a brilliant center- fielder and a good hitter, helped spark the Giants towards the pennant. One of the most colorful players of recent years, his circus catches and base-running feats earned him the Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award and the Baseball Writers' Association of America Rookie of the Year Award. No other National League rookie was even close in either poll. A brilliant future is expected for him in the major leagues. The 26-year-old Cuban Negro, Orestes Minoso, enjoyed an even more successful season as a rookie member of the Chicago White Sox. He led the American League in stolen bases (31), was second in bat- ting (.326), and led the League in triples (14) ; he was also second in doubles and runs scored. In addition, he played six different positions during the season, thus proving himself the game's most versatile player. He immediately became the dar- ling of White Sox fans, whose chant \"Go, Minnie, Go\" rose up whenever he got on base. He won the Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award and was voted fourth in the Baseball Writers' Association of America poll for the Most Valuable Player of the Year, receiving more votes than any other rookie. He was nosed out by two votes (13-11) in the Association vote for Rookie of the Year, an action that caused many a lifted eyebrow, for the winner, Gil MacDougald, although a splendid player, had nothing like Min- oso's brilliant record. For example, Joe Williams, sports editor-in-chief of the New York World-Telegram, said flatly (Nov. 10 issue), \"I would have voted for Orestes Minoso over Gil MacDougald as 20 SPORTS the AL's Rookie of the Year.\" And Frank Lane, President of the Chicago White Sox, has demanded that this award be dropped or a re-study of the voting cri- teria made. Don Newcombe became the first Negro pitcher to win 20 games, although he has yet to realize his enormous potential. His excellent record of 20 wins against nine losses, third best pitching average in the League, still fell considerably short of what his fellow-players in the National League believe him capable of. However, his great pitching during the last week of the season, during which he pitched four games in eight days, including 15 scoreless innings on two successive days, took off some of the edge of the disap- pointment experienced by his many fans. He was tied for the lead in strike-outs (164). Sam Jethroe enjoyed another good sea- son, especially towards the end, when he was playing under a new manager who was able to restore a great deal of his self-confidence. Jethroe again led the Na- tional League in stolen bases (35), and was terrific at the plate during this up- surge, hitting .227 until July 14 and .327 thereafter. Luke Easter (27 home runs) and Larry Doby (a .289 average and 20 home runs) had good seasons but fell far short of what had been expected of them. Henry Thompson, after a brilliant season in 1950, was the year's biggest disappoint- ment. Ageless Satchel Paige was able to pitch winning ball for the poorest team in the major leagues, both as starter and in relief. Negroes have been in the major leagues for five years and have appeared in four World Series. In each of these four, a Negro has led in Series hitting: 1947 (Jackie Robinson, .297) ; 1948 (Larry Doby, .318); 1949 (Robinson, .306); 1951 (Monte Irvin, .458). In the minor leagues so many Negroes won jobs that it is no longer possible to keep up with them all. Here, as in the major leagues, they performed well and many of them were outstanding. Two of them — Hector Rodriquez and Junior Gil- liam — were voted first and second in the International League Rookie of the Year Award. Rodriquez hit .302, batted in 95 runs, was fifth in League batting, and led the League in. stolen bases (26). Gilliam led the League in scoring (117 runs). They were also elected to the League's all-star team by the International League Baseball Writers' Association. Charles Harmon starred for Buffalo in the Inter- national League. George Crowe was named Player of the Year in another Class AAA league, the American Asso- ciation, receiving 20 out of the 27 votes.

Crowe, who is given an excellent chance of winning the first-base position on the Boston Braves next year, was second in League batting with a .339 average and led the League in number of hits (189), total bases on hits (316), doubles (41), and, most important of all, runs batted in (119). In the same League, Buzz Clarkson (Milwaukee) hit .343, but was not eligible for the batting cham- pionship because he did not bat 400 times. Jim Pendleton (St. Paul) led the League in runs scored and batted .301. Ray Dan- dridge (Minneapolis) batted an excellent .324. Don Black (St. Paul) won four and lost three, and had the best earned-run average (2.25) in the League. Dave Barn- hill (Minneapolis) won six and lost four. In the third Class AAA league, the Pacific Coast League, Sad Sam Jones set a new strike-out record (246) and had a 16-13 record with the sixth-place San Diego Padres, pitched the most complete games (21) and the most innings (267), and had a very impressive earned-run average of 2.76. Bob Boyd was second in League batting with a .338 average. Jones and Boyd were regarded as having excel- lent chances of winning berths on the Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox, respectively. Other Negro players in the League were Roy Welmaker, Raul Lopez, Lorenzo Piper, Gene Baker, Frank Austin, Granville Gladstone, William Powell, Bob Thurman, and Artie Wilson. Negroes were scattered throughout the lower echelons of the minor leagues, from Class AA through Class D. Many of them were the property of major league clubs, including some clubs which have not yet tried Negroes out on the major league level. The New York Yankees, the Phila- delphia Athletics, and the Chicago Cubs are known to have Negroes on their farm clubs. Particularly encouraging is the employment of Negroes by southern minor league teams. For example, the Danville (Va.) team of the Carolina League hired Percy Miller and Berkeley Smith last mid-summer; and Granite Falls of the Class D Western League (in North Carolina) signed five Negro play- ers. It is freely predicted in Texas that within the next four or five years Negroes will be playing for the famous Class AA Texas League. An Associated Press re- lease dated Dec. 5 stated, \"It is appar- ently a certainty that Negro baseball players will be on next season's roster of South Atlantic clubs.\" The Florida Inter- national League (Class B) took on its first Negro in December, George Handy of Memphis, who had played during the 1951 season for the Ste.-Hyacinthe of the Canadian Provincial League. Considered \"a fine second base prospect,\" he was signed by the Miami Beach team. This would seem to answer the ques- tion: Where are the future Negro stars coming from? With the weakening of the Negro leagues and the inevitable dis- appearance of the current crop of Negro stars, this has loomed as a serious prob- lem to those interested in the progress of Negroes in organized baseball. The real integration of Negroes on all levels seems to constitute the answer, and integration seems to be on the way. In this connec- tion, one other achievement is worthy of mention. Grover Jones, 17, catcher on the White Plains, New York, Post No. 135 team, was voted \"player of the year\" in the 25th American Legion Junior Base- ball Championship. The first Negro to be so honored, he was team captain, hit .408 in the sectional and regional champion- ships, and led the tournament with 20 hits and 20 runs batted in. He led his team to second place, and was the first member of a non-championship team to be chosen \"player of the year.\" The story of \"Negro\" baseball was one of continuing difficulties and dwindling popular support. The Negro American League dropped two of its teams to become an eight-team organization, with an Eastern and Western Division. This League played in Indianapolis, Chicago, Birmingham, Philadelphia, Kansas City, Memphis, New Orleans, and Baltimore. Indianapolis won the Eastern Division Championship, and Chicago, the Western Division. The future of this League is 22 SPORTS obscure, for it seems to lack adequate basic financing as well as adequate ap- peal. Many persons interested in the Negro in baseball hope that it will be- come a part of organized baseball and serve as an important \"feeder\" to the major leagues. The East defeated the West, 3-1, in the nineteenth annual East-West Negro Ail- Star Game before 21,312 in Chicago. FOOTBALL College Players and Teams In regard to college football, 1951 was important for two reasons: Negroes played on more teams than ever before, and more Negro players starred and made All-America selections than ever before in one season. The Negro player in the East and Mid-West has been \"old hat\" for a number of years. In the East there were far fewer than usual. Only Ed Bell and Bob Evans of the University of Penn- sylvania and Avatus Stone of Syracuse were outstanding on major teams. Bell and Evans earned distinctions aplenty. Bell was undoubtedly one of the finest defensive ends in the country, and made the first team on two All-America selec- tions and the second or third team on several others. Evans was elected captain of the 1952 team, an unusual distinction, for no Negroes had played for a Penn- sylvania football team until the year 1950. Stone, the only Negro offensive quarterback on a major football team, led the East in punting (ave. 40.2 yards). Most stellar Negro players of 1951 were in the Mid-West, and most of them played in the Western Intercollegiate Conference, the Big Ten, where, accord- ing to most students of the game, the finest football in the country is played. The University of Iowa had seven Ne- groes on its squad. Among others partic- ularly outstanding were Don Stevens of Illinois, Bob Robertson of Indiana, Ed Withers of Wisconsin, Don Commack of Iowa, Lowell Perry and Tom Johnson of Michigan. The latter two made several All-America teams, and Lowell Perry was chosen Associated Press Linesman of the Week of Oct. 22 after scoring three touch- downs against Minnesota. Don Stevens and Claude Taliaferro (brother of George, the All -American) were members of the backfield of the undefeated University of Illinois team, which won the Big Ten Championship and played Stanford in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1, 1952. By a rather odd arrangement, Michigan State's football team, which was unde- feated and was one of the two leading claimants for national championship hon- ors, is not officially a member of the Big Ten and will not be until 1953, though other teams of this institution are. The outstanding player on this team was the great Don Coleman, a tackle weighing only 180 pounds. He made every All- America se"
