        "text": "Back to Kill Bill\n\nKill Bill is set in the The Movie Movie Universe.\n\nThe Spaghetti Western Flashback/Vengeance Theme concept:\n\nWhen The Bride sees her enemies we zoom in on her eyes and we then see an orange/red spaghetti western flashback as the theme from Ironside plays. This vengeance theme/visual effect happpens when she sees Vernita Green & O-Ren Ishii. Yet, it does not happen with any other of her enemies...\n\nWhen The Bride sees Sofie Fatale in the House of Blue Leaves bathroom we hear the Vengeance theme play but do not see the spaghetti western flashback....\n\nThe Bride hides under Budd's trailer home, but we never see/hear the Vengeance theme/flashback when shes in his presence....\n\nWhen The Bride sees Elle Driver from the hill above Budd's trailer, again we hear the theme play but do not see the flashback...\n\nWhy? The reason is because they don't see HER. For the spaghetti western flashback effect to happen her enemies have to be aware of her presence.\n\nHanzo Sword Concept\n\nAs stated by Quentin Tarantino on the TCM Special Interview, Elvis Mitchell: Under The Influence: In the Kill Bill Universe, once a Hanzo sword is unsheathed, it must get some blood spilled on it or a curse is placed on the current owner of the sword.\n\nVolume 1 Trivia\n\nWhen Chiaki Kuriyama (Gogo) was shooting the scene where she flings her ball and chain out, she accidentally hit Quentin Tarantino on the head while he stood by the camera.\n\nAt the beginning of the fight scene between O-Ren and The Bride, after O-Ren says, in Japanese, \"I hope you saved your energy. If you haven't you may not last 5 minutes\", it is exactly 4 minutes and 59 seconds from the time she steps forward and the music cues, until the fatal blow of the duel.\n\nThis became the first feature-length film directed by Quentin Tarantino to feature fewer than 100 uses of the word \"fuck.\" It is used 17 times.\n\nThe shot where the Bride splits a baseball in two with a samurai sword was done for real on the set. It was done by Zoë Bell, Uma Thurman's stunt double.\n\nAccording to Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman in the DVD documentary the idea for doing \"Kill Bill\" began during the filming of Pulp Fiction (1994). The two began talking about the kinds of movies that they would like to do and Quentin said he would like to do a 70's style kung-fu flick. Uma came up with the film's opening shot of her beaten up and wearing a wedding gown.\n\nUma Thurman was offered the script to Kill Bill, and her role as \"The Bride\", as a 30th Birthday present from Quentin Tarantino.\n\nQuentin Tarantino owns the \"Pussy Wagon\" and drove as his everyday vehicle to promote the release of Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004). He licensed use of it for the Missy Elliott music video, \"I'm Really Hot\". It also appears in the video for \"Telephone\" by Lady Gaga and Beyoncé Knowles.\n\nShin'ichi Chiba makes katanas in real life. In the movie, his character Hattori Hanzo is a renowned katana maker who has taken a blood oath to never create an instrument of death again.\n\nOn the Bride's plane tickets you can see the name 'Beatrix Kiddo' which is said by the teacher taking attendance in the class room.\n\nThe black and white photography is ultimately a homage to '70s and '80s US television airings of kung fu movies. Black and white (as well as black and red), were used to conceal the shedding of blood from television censors. Originally, no black and white photographic effects were going to be used (and in the Japanese version none are), but the MPAA demanded measures be taken to tone the scene down. Tarantino merely used the old trick for its intended purpose, rather than merely as an homage.\n\nWhen 'The Bride' is walking towards the stairs in the House of Blue Leaves to fight the first round of bodyguards you see a shot taken from underneath through the glass floor. The soles of her shoes read \"Fuck U\".\n\nQuentin Tarantino originally intended to cast a Japanese actress to play O-Ren Ishii, but before casting began he saw Lucy Liu's work in Shanghai Noon (2000) and immediately changed O-Ren into a Chinese-Japanese American so that Liu could play the part.\n\nThe island of Okinawa is widely regarded among the Japanese as the single worst place in all of Japan to get decent sushi, so Tarantino's decision to have Hanzo operate a sushi restaurant in Okinawa was an excellent decision, since it permitted Hanzo to leave his former life behind and not be bothered by those who tried to seek him out after having taken his blood oath.\n\nBill calls The Bride by her last name, Kiddo, in the film's opening scene. The audience, not knowing her last name, is meant to assume it is simply a term of endearment.\n\nQuentin Tarantino delayed the start of the production because Uma Thurman was pregnant.\n\nAs Quentin Tarantino was leaving Japan after initial location scouting and securing the studios, he heard the all girl band \"The 5,6,7,8's\" playing over the store's speakers. He was so intrigued by the music that he asked a clerk who the band was. When he was told, Tarantino, who didn't have enough time to go to a music shop to get their CD, begged the clerk to sell him their copy. Quentin took the disc home, listened to it, and immediately signed the band to play during the \"Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves\" segment. All of the band's songs, including the stand-out \"Woo Hoo\" are covers of early 60's surfer songs.\n\nThe Japanese symbols on the background of the poster spell \"kirubiru\" which is the Japanese spelling for \"Kill Bill\".\n\nThe closing title card, \"Based on the character of 'The Bride' created by Q and U\", refers to the first initials of Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman.\n\nQuentin Tarantino in his conversation with Indian director Anurag Kashyap admitted that the celebrated manga animation-action sequence in Kill Bill was inspired from 2001 Hindi-Tamil film, Aalavandhan (2001) starring Kamal Haasan. Tarantino was quoted saying 'Yes, saw this Indian serial-killer film which showed violence as animated'.\n\nThe church scene was shot in the Mojave Desert outside of Lancaster, CA. Keep an eye out during this scene for a cameo by Samuel L. Jackson as the dead organ player and Bo Svenson as the preacher.\n\nChristopher Allen Nelson, who worked on the special effects, revealed in interview that over 450 gallons of fake blood were used in the two Kill Bill movies.\n\nThe infamous long take scene took 6 hours to rehearse and was shot in 17 takes. After that, Steadicam operator Larry McConkey was rumored to have passed out in exhaustion.\n\nJack Nicholson, Kurt Russell, Mickey Rourke and Burt Reynolds passed on playing Bill.\n\nDuring filming, actors often provided a \"Hello, Sally!\" take. This involves the actor finishing his or her take, turning to face the camera, and yelling \"Hello, Sally!\". Whether editor Sally Menke appreciates this is yet to be reported.\n\nThe sunglasses the Bride takes from Buck at the hospital are the same style Christian Slater wore in True Romance (1993), also written by Quentin Tarantino.\n\nApproximately US$60,000 of the movie's budget was used for producing swords and sword accessories.\n\nDespite being bleeped out in the film, the name of The Bride is revealed on her plane tickets to Okinawa and Tokyo.\n\nQuentin Tarantino only had Uma Thurman in mind to play The Bride.\n\nAccording to Uma Thurman, Quentin had her watch three movies in preparation for this film: John Woo's The Killer (1989), Coffy (1973) (Starring Jackie Brown (1997) star Pam Grier), and Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (1964).\n\nOn the wall of the House of Blue Leaves are the letters Q and U. These refer to the first names of Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman, as the creators of The Bride.\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino was a big fan of the Japanese movie Battle Royale (2000) so he cast Chiaki Kuriyama (who played Takako Chigusa in Battle Royale (2000)) as Gogo Yubari.\n\nIt took six years to write the entire script before being split into two parts. The original draft was about 220 pages long.\n\nWarren Beatty was originally offered the role of Bill. After turning it down, he suggested to Quentin Tarantino that he use David Carradine.\n\nIn order to achieve the specific look of Chinese \"wuxia\" (martial arts) film of the 1970s, Quentin Tarantino gave director of photography, Robert Richardson, an extensive list of genre films as a crash-course in the visual style they used. The list included films by genre-pioneers Cheh Chang and the Shaw Brothers. Tarantino also forbade the use of digital effects and \"professional\" gags and squibs. As such, he insisted that bloody spurts be done in the fashion made popular by Chang Cheh: Chinese condoms full of fake blood that would splatter on impact.\n\nThe members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad are all named after snakes. Bill drives a De Tomaso Mangusta. \"Mangusta\" is Italian for \"Mongoose\" which are well-known for their ability to fight and kill venomous snakes, particularly cobras.\n\nElle Driver (Daryl Hannah) whistles the theme from Twisted Nerve (1968) while entering the hospital. The whistling from Bernard Herrmann's composition is isolated until Elle enters a changing room.\n\nThe Bride always wears Onitsuka Tiger footwear.\n\nQuentin Tarantino revealed in an interview that the music used in Kill Bill was all from other films; he used music from his soundtrack collection.\n\nTo entice cinematographer Robert Richardson to work on the project, Quentin Tarantino had the script sent to his house on Valentine's Day 2002... along with a bouquet of roses.\n\nGogo Yubari is not a real Japanese name. \"Gogo\" derives from Mach GoGoGo (aka Speed Racer), a Japanese anime that Quentin Tarantino liked when he was young. Yubari is the name of a small town in Hokkaido, northern Japan, that is famous for melons and film. Tarantino's first visit to Japan was to showcase Reservoir Dogs (1992) at the Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival.\n\nThe original trailer for this film, although featuring no actual bloodshed, raised the ire of the MPAA with the sight of The Bride's blood-stained clothes. As such it became the first to be subjected to the MPAA's new \"no blood\" policy for trailers, in which all sight of the bodily fluid must be alternately colored or removed entirely. This is why the trailers for this film (and similarly for every film released in the US thereafter) feature The Bride's clothes covered in blackish-brown stains where the blood would be.\n\nQuentin Tarantino chose Jun Kunimura to be Boss Tanaka after seeing him scream in Ichi the Killer (2001).\n\nMichael Madsen's character is named \"Budd\" as a tribute to Budd Boetticher, one of Quentin Tarantino's favorite directors.\n\nTarantino said the Grindhouse films were also an influence on Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003). He later got to make a Grindhouse film with Death Proof (2007).\n\nThe finale took eight weeks to shoot.\n\nOne fan theory suggests Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 are in fact the failed pilot of Fox Force Five that Mia Wallace (played by Uma Thurman) says she acted in in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (1994).\n\nThe Tokyo miniature sets were leftovers from the then most recent Godzilla film (Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack (2001)).\n\nDuring the fight scene between Gogo Yubari and the Bride, the sound of bowling pins being knocked over can be heard as Gogo flips over after being hit in the back of the head with a flail.\n\nThe license plate for Buck's truck is a Texas plate that reads PSY WGN. When the movie is shown on network television, and the name of the truck is edited to \"Party Wagon\", the license plate remains the same.\n\nOn the The Making of 'Kill Bill' (2003) Tarantino noted that the split screen scene where Elle is about to enter the bride's room and kill her was an homage to Brian De Palma.\n\n\"The Bells\" sign seen on the letterbox at the beginning of Chapter One was given to Uma Thurman's stunt double Zoë Bell by Quentin Tarantino. Bell presented it to her parents, The Bells.\n\nWILHELM SCREAM: used twice during the battle at the House of Blue Leaves.\n\nQuentin Tarantino had intended for three actors of different nationalities to represent their respective countries. Chia-Hui Liu represents China, Shin'ichi Chiba represents Japan, and David Carradine represents the United States. Tarantino said that had Bruce Lee still been alive he'd have been asked to appear in Kill Bill as well.\n\nSofie Fatale's cell phone ring is \"Auld Lang Syne\", specifically the tune for the line, \"Should old acquaintance be forgot\". However, the tune is also a popular tradition in Japan where it is known as \"Hotaru no Hikari\". This version contains totally different lyrics and is commonly associated with graduation ceremonies.\n\nAlthough the \"Old Klingon Proverb\": \"Revenge is a dish best served cold\" is from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982), the quote is a paraphrase of a line from the book \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\" (1782) by Choderlos de Laclos.\n\nOriginally, Quentin Tarantino wanted Michael Madsen to play Johnny Mo (Mr. Barrel in the original script). However, he decided that Madsen would be better as Bill's brother, so he had Madsen play Budd instead.\n\nDIRECTOR_TRADEMARK(Quentin Tarantino): [bare feet]: Lucy Liu is barefoot as she runs to kill Boss Tanaka. The band at the House of Blue Leaves is barefoot. The Bride is barefoot as she escapes from the hospital and tries to regain control of her legs. Uma Thurman's bare feet were introduced in \"Pulp Fiction\" before we even saw her face.\n\nThe entrance to the traffic tunnel in Tokyo is in fact the entrance to the second street tunnel in Los Angeles (Blade Runner (1982)) with Japanese traffic signs added.\n\nIn the original script, Johnny Mo was called Mr. Barrel. He had a Kato mask on a stick, like someone from a 17th Century costume ball. Mr. Barrel didn't like the rubber bands on the typical Kato masks because they 'fucked up his hair'. The Bride convinces him not to fight her, and he walks away, leaving O-Ren with no bodyguards.\n\nWhen Tarantino planned to cast Gogo and Yuki Yubari, his first choices were Chiaki Kuriyama and Ko Shibasaki. Both had roles in the 2000 hit, Battle Royale (2000).\n\nThe characters streaming down the left side of the screen in the opening scenes are Japanese kanji and hiragana, and they read \"Hana yome ga kuru, hana yome ga kuru.\" Or: \"The Bride is coming, the Bride is coming,\" over and over again.\n\nIn Hattori Hanzo's sushi restaurant, there is a 4-character Chinese saying hanging above the bar. It says \"zui sheng meng si,\" literally \"drunk birth, dream death.\" A rough meaningful translation is \"To lead an unimportant and often dissipated life.\"\n\nDuring the scene when O-Ren Ishii celebrates her ascension to the head of the Tokyo Yakuza, she is wearing a black kimono. It is a kurotomesode with long sleeves (dangling near the floor). The kurotomesode is the most formal kimono, is for married women only, and would only be made with short sleeves.\n\n\"Hattori\" means \"weapon\" in a feminine context in the Hindi language, the modern form of Sanskrit language, the ancient language for Hinduism and Buddhism.\n\nDaryl Hannah's character is called \"Elle Driver.\" The production team for the documentary Full Tilt Boogie (1997), a documentary about the production of From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) (which starred Quentin Tarantino), is also called \" L. Driver Productions\".\n\nThe members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad are all named for snakes: Sidewinder, Black Mamba, Cottonmouth, Copperhead, and California Mountain (King) snake.\n\nDavid Carradine is only heard in the film, never seen (bar his hands in the opening scene and in the closing scene).\n\nDuring the anime sequence explaining O-Ren's origins you briefly see that O-Ren's father held the rank of Sergeant Major in the U.S. Army.\n\nVernita Green's (Vivica A. Fox) original codename was 'Cobra' before it was changed to 'Copperhead'.\n\nThe name Hattori Hanzo was borne by four ninjas in feudal Japan but the most famous was born in the mid-16th century. As well as being an excellent strategist and a master of the spear, he and his ninja were instrumental in ushering in the Tokugawa Period of Japanese history (1603-1868).\n\nDuring production, Quentin Tarantino wrote new scenes as he shot thus compiling massive amounts of footage.\n\nDespite the fact that this was filmed in Super 35, \"Filmed in Panavision\" is listed in the end credits.\n\nPart of the movie was shot at the legendary The Shaw Brothers Creative Group studio in Hong Kong. Quentin Tarantino has seen so many movies made at the studio that he felt it was important for him to work there.\n\nMichael Bowen (Buck) and David Carradine (Bill) share three siblings, but are themselves not related. Carradine is the son of John Carradine and Ardanelle McCool, while Bowen is the son of Sonia Sorel and Michael Bowen Sr. However Sorel and Carradine had three children together, including actors Keith and Robert Carradine.\n\nThe Bride refers to Bill's assassins as the vipers. Their formal title is \"The Deadly International Viper Assassination Squad\". Or, for short THE DIVAS.\n\nThe paintings on the walls of Vernita (Vivica A. Fox)'s home in the opening scenes, were provided by visual artist Rodney Grier, brother of Pam Grier the star of Tarantino's earlier Jackie Brown (1997).\n\nQuentin Tarantino has said in interviews that, had Warren Beatty taken the part of Bill, the character would have been more of a suave, James Bond-type.\n\nKevin Costner was also considered for the title role of \"Bill\", but he turned it down to do Open Range (2003) instead.\n\nThe conversation between Hanzo and the assistant, where the assistant says if this were the military, I'd be General by now! is taken almost word for word from Fighting Back (1948).\n\nWhen Uma Thurman is approaching 'The Bells' house, \"Music Box Dancer\" is playing in the background. Frank Mills composed this song after several years of performing in a band called, 'The Bells'.\n\nThe music sampled for \"Ode to O-Ren Ishii\" is the title track from the film The Psychic (1977). Since an instrumental version is not included on the soundtrack, it has become an increasingly popular download.\n\nThe view of the trees through the windows of the Bride's hospital room just before Elle, dressed as a nurse, enters is taken from Mandalay Pictures' ID.\n\nThe Bride's yellow outfit is the same outfit worn by Bruce Lee in his final film, Game of Death (1978).\n\nUma Thurman and Vivica A. Fox both appeared in Batman & Robin (1997), but had no scenes together.\n\nThe name Johnny Mo is a reference to the Chinese director of Hero (2002), Yimou Zhang, whose name when spoken would sound almost the same.\n\nBoth Daryl Hannah and Uma Thurman have appeared in Playboy many years apart.\n\nWhile O-Ren Ishii's age is never mentioned, we can gather that she is either 29 or 30, since The Bride states that she was 25 when she took her part in trying to kill her, and it is four years later.\n\nMichael Madsen only gets a couple of lines, and even then, its right at the end of the film.\n\nThe restaurant where The Bride fights O-Ren is called The House of Blue Leaves. The House of Blue Leaves is a play written by John Guare.\n\nDirector Cameo - Quentin Tarantino: When The Bride stands over the remains of the Crazy 88s, a masked Quentin Tarantino is among them.\n\nDirector Trademark\n\nQuentin Tarantino: [long take] After the Bride leaves O-Ren's door at the House of Blue Leaves (when Go-Go returns inside) the camera follows her down the stairs through the bar, past the kitchen, into the ladies room; we then go out of the ladies' room, back to the stairs and follow Sofie Fatale along the exact same path to the ladies' room, ending with the ring of her cellphone. The shot is done in a single, unedited take.\n\nQuentin Tarantino: [Red Apple cigarettes] When the Bride arrives at the Tokyo airport, she walks in front of a Red Apple Cigarettes advertisement. Red Apple is a \"Tarantino brand,\" one of several fictional products that are often seen in his films. Julie Dreyfus (Sofie Fatale) is the Red Apple model.\n\nQuentin Tarantino: [cereal] The pistol that Vernita Green fires at The Bride is hidden in a box of \"KaBoom\" cereal.\n\nQuentin Tarantino: [Trunk Shot] While The Bride is interrogating Sofie Fatale, we see from Sofie's point of view inside the trunk of her own car looking up at the masked Bride.\n\n.\n\nIn the early stages of filming, O-Ren was supposed to be decapitated at the end of her battle with the Bride, but it was changed because she would have never known that the Bride's sword was truly a Hanzo sword had she been beheaded.\n\nThe character Gogo was originally written as two characters: the twin Yubari sisters, Gogo and Yuki. Gogo had almost no lines and after her death at the hands of The Bride, Yuki would seek her out, only to be killed as well, in the \"lost\" chapter \"Yuki's Revenge\". All of Gogo's dialogue in the final film would have been spoken by Yuki.\n\nThe line that O-Ren and The Bride speak together in the House of Blue Leaves - \"Silly rabbit / Trix are for kids\" - refers to an advertising slogan for breakfast cereal. It is also a cryptic reference to The Bride's name, which in Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) is revealed to be Beatrix Kiddo.\n\nBody Count: 95.\n\nJulie Dreyfus speaks three different languages in the movie. She speaks fluent Japanese until the end where she speaks in her native French to insult the Bride (Uma Thurman) and then in clear English when she talks to Bill. In real life, Julie Dreyfus is trilingual.\n\nAlthough The Bride has Hattori Hanzo craft her a sword to exact revenge against Bill and the Vipers, she only uses the blade to kill O-Ren Ishii.\n\nQuentin Tarantino and producer Harvey Weinstein have been quoted as saying that Kill Bill was separated into two parts well into production. By splitting the movie into two parts, the film's advertising tagline, \"In 2003, Uma Thurman Will Kill Bill!\" was made false.\n\nThe original script featured the Bill character to be a master chemist. The liquid in the syringe was pointed out to be a concoction created by Bill entitled \"Goodbye Forever\". These potions/elixirs were to be detailed by on-screen subtitles. The Bride would also use a mix called \"The Undisputed Truth\" to get information from Sofie Fatale. In Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004), Bill would use \"The Undisputed Truth\" on the Bride.\n\nWhen The Bride is standing outside Vernita Green's house, an ice cream truck jingle is played. It's \"Music Box Dancer\" by the Canadian pianist Frank Mills, a 1978 hit single. Also used in the nickelodeon television series Pinwheel. In the original script, Yuki Yubari (attempting to avenge the death of her sister, Gogo) stalked The Bride in an ice cream truck.\n\nWhen The Bride is in the \"Pussy Wagon\" with her list. When she is crossing off the name \"Vernita Green\", right above it you can see the name \"O-Ren Ishii\" that is also crossed off indicating that O-Ren was killed before Vernita even though O-Ren isn't killed until the climax of the film.\n\n\"Sheriff Earl McGraw (Michael Parks), drives in with the sunglasses lined up on the dashboard. Tarantino's homage to the opening shot of the original 1974 Gone in Sixty Seconds\n\nVolume 2 Trivia\n\nQuentin Tarantino originally intended to only have Pai Mei's lips speaking Cantonese, while his voice would be in English, imitating a bad dub job. Tarantino was going to provide the voice himself. In the end, Tarantino abandoned this idea and Pai Mei (Chia-Hui Liu) speaks in his own voice.\n\nThe Bride never actually says anything to Budd.\n\nPai Mei's three inch punch is a reference to Bruce Lee's three inch knockout punch.\n\nRobert Rodriguez scored this movie for $1. Quentin Tarantino said he would repay him by directing a segment of Rodriguez's project Sin City (2005) for $1.\n\nThe brothel segment where the Bride meets with Esteban Vihaio (Michael Parks) was the very last scene of the movie to be shot, which was filmed at an actual Mexican brothel and all of the female extras were actual prostitutes that worked at the brothel.\n\nThis movie reveals that 3 of the 6 members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad are not named after any species of Viper. Bill is Snake Charmer. The Black Mamba (appropriately the most dangerous of all land snakes) is of the Elapidae family. Elle's codename is California Mountain King Snake, a completely non-venomous constrictor. It is famous for its ability to eat other snakes, particularly rattlesnakes like the Sidewinder (Bud's Codename).\n\nWhen the first grade teacher (Venessia Valentino) takes roll, she calls out one real-life name: Marty Kitrosser. Martin Kitrosser has served as script supervisor on all of Tarantino's films.\n\nWait after the credits for an alternate take of The Bride ripping out one of the Crazy 88's eyes.\n\nQuentin Tarantino has the \"Pussy Wagon\" parked in the driveway of his home.\n\nRicardo Montalban was cast to play Esteban. Unable to make an early read through of the script, his lines were read by Michael Parks, who impressed Tarantino so much that he recast Parks instead.\n\nThe reason that The Bride no longer has the \"Pussy Wagon\" in Vol. 2 is because in the original script that included the character of Yuki Yubari, Go-Go's sister, Yuki had destroyed it soon after the killing of Vernita Green.\n\nThe film is a departure from most of Quentin Tarantino's films in that a number of actual products/brand names/etc. appear in the movie. Tarantino usually makes an effort to avoid product placement in his films.\n\nThe Character Pai Mei is based on Pak Mei, the originator of the \"White Eyebrow\" kung fu technique. According to legend, Pak Mei was one of the few masters left following the decimation of the Buddhist temples, and later sold out other masters to save himself and his team during an attack they had mounted that subsequently went wrong. For this reason, Pak Mei Kung Fu has always been known as the \"forbidden technique,\" and Pak Mei himself has been a villainous figure in Chinese folklore and film for hundreds of years.\n\nAt the film's first test screening in Austin, Texas the audience gave the film a five minute standing ovation. The reaction was so overwhelming that Harvey Weinstein did not have the research firm conducting the screening pass out response cards.\n\nBill's speech about Superman was in part inspired by \"The Great Comic Book Heroes\" a book by Jules Feiffer.\n\nIn the scene where Uma Thurman is being buried alive, the master shot has the pickup's headlights illuminating the graveyard. On the right of the screen, the exhumed body's gnarled hand casts a bunny-shaped shadow on its coffin.\n\nMichael Jai White filmed several scenes in Volume Two with David Carradine, but these were cut from the final theatrical version due to pacing concerns. A lengthy confrontation between the two is the one and only deleted scene on the Vol. 2 DVD.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is a big fan of animator Bill Plympton, and named the groom Tommy Plympton after him.\n\nThe chapter \"Yuki's Revenge\" was cut from filming to accommodate a new chapter, \"Massacre at Two Pines\" that details the attack on The Bride. An outline of the chapter was to have Yuki Yubari, Gogo's sister seek vengeance on the Bride for killing her sister, Yuki was to be played by Ko Shibasaki who co-stared with Chiaki Kuriyama (who plays Gogo in Vol.1) in the Japanese movie Battle Royale (2000).\n\nDespite the Bride's name being bleeped out in Vol. 1 and for 2/3rds of Vol. 2. Her name is actually spoken or revealed on more than one occasion. When someone calls her Beatrix and it's bleeped, it is simply muffled and is still audible and if you're good at reading lips you may be able to figure it out. Also, Bill refers to The Bride as \"Kiddo\" in the flash back scenes. While this is both his pet name for her and a common term of endearment, it is also her last name.\n\nFrom script to film, the Ten-Point Palm exploding heart technique is changed to the Five-Point Palm exploding heart technique.\n\nPai Mei punching through a wooden plank, leaving a round hole as opposed to \"regular\" wood splinters, may be a reference to this ability, attributed to several martial arts masters - among them Masusatsu Oyama (founder of the Kyokushin school of karate) who, in martial arts folklore, is said to have punched such a hole in an oak door to grab the wrist of a burglar trying to enter his house\n\nWas the first Oscar DVD to arrive in Academy mailboxes in 2004. It ironically received no Academy Award nominations.\n\nAlthough \"Kill Bill\" was meant to play as one whole movie, \"Vol. 2\" is unofficially Quentin Tarantino's first sequel.\n\nAlthough Quentin Tarantino is known for never using real brands for products like cereals and cigarettes, the brand of the bread he uses to make the sandwich during the \"Emilio's killing story\" scene, BIMBO, is a real and very popular brand of bread in Mexico.\n\nDuring the scene in which Bill shoots the bride with truth serum and then interrogates her, he calls her a \"natural born killer\" and also a \"renegade killer bee,\" which references projects of the Wu-Tang Clan a member of which (RZA) wrote much of the original music for the two films.\n\nChoreographer Woo-Ping Yuen was originally set to play Pai Mei but could not fit it in with his choreography, so Quentin Tarantino considered playing it himself for a little while before picking Chia-Hui Liu for the part.\n\nThe book that Esteban Vihaio (Michael Parks) reads is \"The Carrucans of Kurrajong\" by Jasmine Yuen. Jasmine Yuen Carrucan is one of the crew members, and a character named Old Man Carrucan (played by Bruce Dern) appears in Tarantino's 2012 film Django Unchained.\n\nAlso changed from the original script - the story of Pai Mei is no longer told in a Jeep on the way to the cruel master's temple. Rather, it is now unfolded in front of a campfire somewhere in the Chinese countryside, the night before Bill and The Bride arrive. With the aid of a flute (one of the silent flutes from Circle of Iron (1978)), Bill tells the tale of Pai Mei in a \"Peter and The Wolf\" type fashion.\n\nBill's truth serum, The Undisputed Truth, is the name of a 70s soul group.\n\nEarly posters for Vol. 2 proclaimed it as \"The Fifth Film by Quentin Tarantino\". Subsequent posters have not used that blurb, while the film itself simply says \"a film by QUENTIN TARANTINO\". Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) says \"The 4th Film By Quentin Tarantino\" at the beginning and Vols 1 & 2 two are supposed to be considered one film. The fifth film by Quentin Tarantino is actually Death Proof (2007).\n\nWarren Beatty was considered for the role of Bill. Beatty declined the offer and recommended David Carradine for the role.\n\nThe car seen behind Bill when he visits Budd at his trailer is a De Tomaso Mangusta, an Italian concept car put into limited production by De Tomaso. Later De Tomaso developed a related vehicle, the Pantera, which was sold through Lincoln-Mercury dealerships in the late 1960s. Because of its speed, agility, timing, and thick coat, the mangusta (Italian for mongoose) is the only animal capable of killing a cobra in a straight fight.\n\nMichael Madsen played a role very similar to Bud for the 'Kill Bill'-inspired music video for 'Black Widow'.\n\nThe Acuña Boys is a fictional gang in Rolling Thunder (1977). Quentin Tarantino has cited that movie as a favorite. The plot of Rolling Thunder involves 5 murderers who kill the wife and son of a PWO and how he embarks on a quest for revenge.\n\nIn Reservoir Dogs, Michael Madsen's character attempts to kill a cop by dousing him with a can of gasoline, intending to burn him alive. In Kill Bill Vol. 2, the same gas canister can be seen in Bud's (Michael Madsen) trailer as The Bride attempts to enter.\n\nJulie Dreyfus suggested two popular pieces of music for the movie. The first one being \"The Chase\" where Elle drives to Budd's trailer. The second one being \"The Sunny Road To Salina\" where The Bride walks through the desert to Budd's trailer. Julie's father is a record producer who owns the rights to the soundtrack of Road to Salina (1970) where the pieces of music are from.\n\nWhen the Bride first arrives at the hacienda where Bill is staying, she walks past several hotel clerks in the lobby who are all out of focus on camera. One of the clerks in the background is the film's producer Lawrence Bender.\n\nThe film's entire first reel is presented in black and white.\n\nIn the documentary, \"A Man Can Do That,\" Quentin Tarantino notes that Budd in Kill Bill was a nod to director Budd Boetticher. Budd's sense of morals is certainly an homage to those of Randolph Scott's in Boetticher's 'Ranown' films.\n\nThe name of the book that Esteban is reading is \"The Carrucan's of Kurrajong\" by Jasmine Yuen. This is not a real book; the book functions not only as a prop but as an inside joke. It's a tribute to a member of the film crew, 'Jasmine Yuen Carrucan'. Kurrajong is a town in Australia - Jasmine Yuen Carrucan is Australian. In other words, the Carrucans who live in Kurrajong (the native aboriginal name for a town). Kurrajong is located in the far north west of Sydney between Palm Beach and the Blue Mountains (near Richmond). Kurrajong is a species of bottle tree native to Australia and New Guineas as well as New Zealand from 50m years ago. (Kurrajong comes from Dharuk Garraju, the language of a now extinct Aboriginal tribe, and means \"fishing line\" as fishing lines were made from kurrajong bark.)\n\nLarry Bishop, who plays Budd's boss at the strip club, shares no scenes with David Carradine. However he did appear on Carradine's TV series Kung Fu (1972).\n\nLike his character Bill, David Carradine was also a fan of collecting comic books.\n\nAs the Bride is walking under a very bright sun through the desert just before the trailer incident, the music played is \"Sunny Road to Salina\", composed and performed by french 60s crooner Christophe. Later on, the Bride is told that Bill's hacienda is \"on the road to Salina\", a reference to the film the aforementioned track was originally heard in, Road to Salina (1970).\n\nThe turquoise car that The Bride drives in Vol. 2 is a Volkswagen Type 14 \"Karmann-Ghia\", named after its German/Italian designers. Judging from design details, it seems to be manufactured in about 1970 by Volkswagen's Brazilian branch.\n\nUpon capturing The Bride, Budd utters the line \"I just caught me the cowgirl ain't never been caught.\". This is a reference to The Driver (1978) in which Bruce Dern says, \"I'm gonna catch the cowboy that's never been caught.\"\n\nThe book that Esteban Vihaio reads is \"The Carrucans of Kurrajong\" by Jasmine Yuen. In Django Unchained (2012), the character Django is from the Carrucan plantation. This is an obvious reference to both \"Kill Bill\" and Jasmine Yuen Carrucan.\n\nThe woman playing Mrs. Harmony is stuntwoman Jeannie Epper, featured (along with Zoë Bell) in the documentary Double Dare (2004).\n\nPerla Haney-Jardine's film debut.\n\nThe spit-can that Budd (Michael Madsen) uses is labeled Oak Ridge Coffee. Oak Ridge is a town in Tennessee about 15 miles from Quentin Tarantino's hometown of Knoxville.\n\nDaryl Hannah (Elle Driver) owns the car - a 1980 Pontiac Trans-Am - her character drives in the film. However, she owns the one that was used for promotional shots because Michael Madsen (Budd) got the working Trans-Am before she got to it.\n\nUnlike every other Quentin Tarantino film (including Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)), Vol. 2 doesn't end with \"written and directed by\". Instead, Tarantino shows his own credit at the end of the main credits, but before the crew credits for the various locations at which Kill Bill was filmed.\n\nDespite the fact that this was filmed in Super 35, \"Filmed in Panavision\" is listed in the end credits.\n\nThe movie poster in Budd's trailer is for the Charles Bronson classic Mr. Majestyk (1974). That movie title is also mentioned by Drexl in the Quentin Tarantino-scripted True Romance (1993).\n\nThe gun that Bill uses appears to be a Colt Single Action Army, or \"Peacemaker\", it has a bird's head grip (a modern innovation). It is obviously chambered for .45 Colt as seen on the back of the bullet fired in the internal gun shot in Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003).\n\nEsteban Vihaio mentions to the Bride about following the \"road to Salinas\" to track down Bill. James Dean died after crashing his sports car while attempting to cross an intersection leading to Salinas on September 30, 1955.\n\nBo Svenson (as Reverend Harmony) was one of the stars of The Inglorious Bastards (1978).\n\nThough never revealed in the film, the production photos reveal Bill's license plate number on his car: JE2336\n\nDirector Trademark: Quentin Tarantino: [cereal] Quentin Tarantino features old boxes of cereal in his movies, in the final scene there is an old box of Lucky Charms on the table in the hotel room.\n\nQuentin Tarantino: [long take] The \"Massacre at Two Pines\" ends with the camera following The Bride down the aisle away from Bill to the altar. We then \"float\" away from the altar, down the aisle, past Bill, out the door to the awaiting members of the DiVAS. Once they enter, the camera cranes up off the ground where we hear the pandemonium inside the chapel until finally fading out. All in a single take.\n\nQuentin Tarantino: [body view] Once Budd is bitten by Elle's Black Mamba we see the camera through his eyes at Elle looking down at him.\n\nQuentin Tarantino: [Red Apple Cigarettes] The brand of cigarettes smoked in this film, as noted by the eagle logo below the filter seen in close-ups, is American Spirits. However, when The Bride meets with Esteban (Michael Parks), a pack of Red Apples, Quentin Tarantino's signature brand of fake cigarettes, can clearly be seen on the table.\n\nDaryl Hannah improvised the scene where Elle Driver's eye gets removed by Beatrix Kiddo and she goes \"nuts\". She did this because she thought it would make Quentin Tarantino laugh. He did and that scene entered the final film. She sustained injuries from breaking so many things in the bathroom.\n\nQuentin Tarantino has hinted at two possible spin-offs, one being an all anime backstory of the DiVAS, the other being a spin-off in the future where Vernita Green's (Vivica A. Fox) daughter, Nikki (Ambrosia Kelley), goes on a quest for revenge against Beatrix Kiddo.\n\nIn the first film forty-one people are seen killed. In this film only three are seen killed (Budd, Bill and Pai Mei). Beatrix only kills Bill.\n\nEvery person killed on screen, excluding the ones in the anime sequence, is killed by a female character. (The Bride: Vernita Green, Buck, Gogo, the Crazy 88s, O-Ren Ishii, Bill; Elle: Budd, Pai Mei; O-Ren Ishii: Boss Tanaka; Gogo: Tokyo Business Man)\n\nIn an earlier draft of the script Beatrix Kiddo doesn't remove Elle Driver's remaining eye. In that same draft Elle is killed by having her throat slit, in the final film, however, Beatrix Kiddo leaves Elle Driver alive.\n\nAlthough he's a famously skilled and prolific killer, the character of Bill is not shown to kill anyone himself on screen. The only person he wounds on screen (Beatrix) survives.\n\nThe climax of the film was originally written as a sword-fight on the beach under the moonlight between Beatrix (clad in her wedding dress) and Bill. When the production ran long, Harvey Weinstein insisted Quentin Tarantino cut the scene back. All that remains is Bill's brief reference to such a fight while Beatrix sits on his sofa, and the poster for the film with Beatrix in the dress holding her sword.\n\nEsteban Vihaio (Michael Parks) explains to Beatrix that Bill is passionate about blonde women after seeing Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), that he saw with Vihaio when he was 6 years old. According to this, Bill is 64 years old during the events of the movie.\n\nThrough both parts of the movie, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen) are the only fellow assassins that Beatrix Kiddo does not cite as having \"unfinished business\" with her. She kills neither.\n\nDuring the end credits, the names of actors playing characters on The Bride's \"Death List Five\" list are crossed off, that is, those characters who die onscreen. In order, as per the \"Death List Five\", it is Lucy Liu (O-Ren Ishii),Vivica A. Fox (Vernita Green), and Michael Madsen (Budd). However, a question mark appears over Daryl Hannah (Elle), since it is technically unknown as to her condition, though, being now completely blind, heavily bleeding from her (second) destroyed eye and being in the middle of a desert, she has very little, or not at all, hope to be survived. David Carradine (Bill), who supposedly dies onscreen, has his name appear before the aforementioned cast members, yet his name is not crossed off.\n\nIn the original script, the fight between Beatrix Kiddo and Elle Driver was supposed to resemble her fight with O-Ren Ishii. Quentin Tarantino revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that he changed it the day after catching a showing of Jackass: The Movie (2002) at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas.\n\nBefore Chapter Six was changed from \"Can She Bake a Cherry Pie?\" to \"Massacre at Two Pines\", Samuel L. Jackson's wife, LaTanya Richardson Jackson, was supposed to play a character named L.F. O'Boyle, a casino owner whom Bill personally dispatches after toying with her.\n\nThe scene in which Budd opens the case to reveal a black mamba that bites him in the face was inspired by / \"borrowed\" from Venom (1981) in which Susan George opens a crate containing a mamba that bites her face.\n\nIn the scene where Uma Thurman is taking the pregnancy test, she consults a watch. This watch is a replica of a Rolex Daytona. You can tell it's not a genuine one because the markings on the face don't match an original's.\n\nPai Mei, as kung fu film aficionados know is based on a historical character in Chinese folklore named Bak Mei aka \"White-eyebrow Taoist\". He was later featured as a villain in Shaw Brothers Studios kung fu films including Executioners From Shaolin and Fists of The White Lotus, which is where Gordon Liu plays a hero facing off against Pai Mei.\n\nThe role of Bill was originally offered to Warren Beatty. It was Warren Beatty who suggested Tarantino might think about casting David Carradine.\n\nIn some of the flashbacks, Bill is seen playing a long flute. This flute is actually an old prop that belongs to actor David Carradine from his \"Kung-Fu\" days. It was also used in a fantasy Kung-Fu film called Circle of Iron aka \"The Silent Flute\" written by Bruce Lee.\n\nIn the script, there was originally a whole chapter written about Gogo Yubari's twin sister's revenge which would explain the fate of the \"Pussy Wagon\". The chapter was titled \"Yuki's Revenge\" was ultimately cut from filming so that they could film a new chapter, \"Massacre at Two Pines\" that shows us the events that unfolded the entire film. Yuki was to be played by Kou Shibasaki who co-starred with Chiaki Kuriyama (who plays Gogo in Vol.1) in the Japanese movie Battle Royale (2000).\n\nA movie poster for Mr. Majestyk can be seen in Budd's trailer. The film was an Elmore Leonard adaptation, and starred one of Tarantino's favorite actors Charles Bronson. The film is also mentioned in True Romance."
