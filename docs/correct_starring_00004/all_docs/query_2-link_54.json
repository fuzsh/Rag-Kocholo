        "text": "In Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill, Lucy Liu--playing yakuza boss O-Ren Ishii--picks up a sword, jumps on a table, and slices a rival's head off with one swift stroke. Wait until you see what she can do with a paintbrush. While the thirty-seven-year-old Queens-born actress is best known for breaking balls as a spunky lawyer on Ally McBeal and breaking bones in Charlie's Angels, she's also known to f-up an occasional canvas. Of course, acting still pays slightly better. Her latest film is the Sundance standout Lucky Number Slevin, in which she plays a fast-talking coroner who helps Josh Hartnett out of a bind involving two rival gangsters (Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman). Here, a few more numbers, lucky and otherwise, that paint a picture of Liu.\n\n3 Number of gallery shows she's had. \"The first exhibit was all about Hong Kong, then mostly China--collage sorts of things. I had a third show in March 2005 in Nova Scotia. That one was more incorporating paint and drawing into photographs.\"\n\n0 Number of boyfriends she currently has. \"I'm sure something will come up when it's the right time. When I meet someone and it happens, it'll be like being struck by lightning. I really like to date intelligent people. It doesn't mean that they have to have graduated, just that they read. My family doesn't care if I marry someone Chinese or not.\"\n\n57 Number of dollars paid at an online charity auction this year for a pair of slippers donated by Liu that she received in a Sundance swag bag.\n\n8 Size of slippers.\n\n0 Number of shoes worn during this interview.\n\n97 Number of \"rotten\" reviews--out of 97--on Rotten-tomatoes.com for Liu's 2002 action flick Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever. \"When you do the work and engage in the experience, that's everything. Maybe the movie isn't Shakespeare, but it's something that you really enjoyed making, and it's that experience that you want to relish. It's not like [in English accent], 'Let me make this my award-winning season.' I never even expect that my movies will be released.\"\n\n0 Number of her own fan sites she says she's visited. \"I didn't even know I had fan sites. Wow, that's crazy. I thought that Madonna would be up there, but I didn't think I'd be in that category.\"\n\n6 Number of languages she speaks. \"We only spoke Mandarin growing up. When my older sister went to school, we started learning English. I did one movie in Mandarin, and it's called 3 Needles. I also speak a little Spanish, I'm taking Italian, and I took a little Japanese and a little French. I'd love to take an intensive French course so I can just become fluent. When you travel as much as I do for press, you can go and understand people. You can communicate, and you don't feel like a foreigner and out of place. It opens up your world completely.\"\n\n3 Number of meals during the day at which she prefers to eat breakfast food.\n\n759 Number of Google results for \"Lucy Liu\" + \"luminous.\""
