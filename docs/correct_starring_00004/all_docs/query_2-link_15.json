The Charlie’s Angels babe stars alongside Uma Thurman in cult director Quentin Tarantino’s long-awaited fourth film, and predicts audiences will either flee from the cinema or vomit in their seats when they watch the extreme action - even if she thinks the violence is artistic. She says, “It’s so violent. People will leave the movie theatre or get sick in the movie theatre. But there’s so much violence that it becomes not numbing, but almost comedic. There’s a scene where there’s so much violence that the color of the film goes into black and white, so that the blood looks like oil. It’s cinematic, it’s art. You can take it to a different level, and show what violence is, in such a heightened manner that you don’t think of it as violence anymore, you think of it as a language. If you go to Kill Bill, you know there’s going to be violence - that’s your option.””\n\n[quote]This came into me from someone that saw this off a news site in Japan and translated it for me (Lucy Liu was recently there w/ others promoting Charlies Angel - Full Throttle).[/quote]\n\nIsn’t this article taken directly from imdb.com?\n\nimdb did post something in their news today (though at the very bottom of their celeb news page) which looks like the same press blurb that I posted here late yesterday. I’m sure they got the same news item from wherever the person sent it to me yesterday did… its just a press blurb and all sorts of news wires will pick up on it… though before I posted it here I did check around all the news sites including imdb and found no mention of it anywhere, so I decided to post… with such a cool quote I was sure it’d be all over the newswire within day(s)."
