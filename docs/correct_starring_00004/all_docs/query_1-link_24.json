        "text": "Hollywood film Kill Bill is one wild ride is the brain child of director Quentin Tarantino, with the sequential Kill Bill: Vol 2 following a year later in 2004.\n\nOscar nominee Uma Thurman stars as assassin Beatrix Kiddo, who embarks on a bloody quest for revenge after waking from a four-year coma to discover she has survived a massacre orchestrated by her former fiancé Bill (David Carradine) at the couple's wedding rehearsal.\n\nTaking revenge on her fellow assassins while in pursuit of Bill, Beatrix slowly gets the best of the other members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.\n\nThese included O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), Budd (Michael Madsen) and eventually Bill himself.\n\nBut, what are the actors up to now?\n\nUma Thurman\n\nUma Thurman has worked consistently since her breakout Kill Bill role.\n\nThe 51-year-old actress starred alongside Meryl Streep in age-gap love drama, Prime.\n\nOver more recent years, she has also tried her hand at TV with appearances in shows including The Slap and Imposters.\n\nUma also starred in the supernatural Netflix mystery series Chambers which was cancelled after just one season and is currently filming forthcoming TV drama Suspicion alongside Big Bang Theory star Kunal Nayyar.\n\nThe Apple TV+ series centres on the kidnapping of the son of a prominent American businesswoman.\n\nIn her personal life, Uma divorced her second husband Ethan Hawke in 2005 and has three children, including Stranger Things and Fear Street star, Maya Hawke.\n\nLucy Liu\n\nThe infamous scalping of O-Ren Ishii is one of the most revered moments in the Kill Bill franchise.\n\nLucy Liu has also become somewhat of an icon, enjoying roles in a number of other successful franchises.\n\nThe 52-year-old actress played one third of the Charlie's Angels team in the 2000 movie and its 2003 sequel, Full Throttle.\n\nLucy also tried her hand at TV and starred as a female Dr. Joan Watson in the modern Sherlock Holmes adaptation Elementary, while taking charge behind the lens a number of times.\n\nThe Southland star has directed episodes of New Amsterdam, Elementary and Luke Cage.\n\nShe has a son named Rockwell Lloyd.\n\nMichael Madsen\n\nMichael Madsen's Budd was a particularly sinister antagonist in Kill Bill: Vol 2, memorably burying Beatrix alive.\n\nThe 64-year-old Reservoir Dogs actor has gone on to star in a number of wide-ranging projects.\n\nFollowing Kill Bill, Michael appeared in Hollywood movies Sin City and Scary Movie 4.\n\nHe also starred in TV drama 24 and famously enjoyed a stint on the ninth series of the UK edition of Celebrity Big Brother two years later, finishing in fourth place.\n\nIn 2014, Michael appeared in Rita Ora and Iggy Azalea's Black Widow music video.\n\nHe reunited with Tarantino in 2019 and portrayed Sheriff Hackett in Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood.\n\nMichael has five children and is still married to his second wife, DeAnna Madsen.\n\nDaryl Hannah\n\nDaryl Hannah may have spawned one of the most popular Halloween costumes in history, courtesy of Elle Driver.\n\nThe one-eyed assassin made a chilling rival for The Bride but despite her scene-stealing performance, Daryl has kept things pretty lowkey since her Kill Bill success.\n\nThe 60-year-old actress played a number of minor roles before joining the Netflix hit TV series Sense8 as Angelica Turing from 2015 - 2018.\n\nShe has also directed two documentary films and married her husband Neil Young in 2018.\n\nDavid Carradine\n\nDavid Carradine played the titular character in Kill Bill, sadly passing away six years later.\n\nThe 72-year-old actor was reportedly found dead in the closet of a hotel room in Thailand in 2009.\n\nAccording to ABC News, Thai police suspected his death was likely an accident which resulted from dangerous sex practises.\n\nReuters reported at the time that the star's private autopsy results indicated that his death was caused by asphyxiation.\n\nVivica A. Fox\n\nFollowing her Kill Bill success, Vivica A. Fox went on to take the TV world by storm.\n\nIn 2007, the Vernita Green star joined Larry David's hit HBO show Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nShe also memorably starred as Candace in Empire.\n\nEarlier this year, Vivica was unmasked as Mother Nature on the US edition of The Masked Singer.\n\nThe now 57-year-old actress divorced her husband Christopher Harvest in 2002 and last year, revealed that not having children was 'the biggest regret of her life'.\n\nShe told Oprah's Where Are They Now: \"That's the biggest regret of my life that I have is that I didn't have a child.\""
