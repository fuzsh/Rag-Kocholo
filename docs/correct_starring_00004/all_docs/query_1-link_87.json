        "text": "Japanese actor and martial arts great Sonny Chiba has died at the age of 82 from complications related to Covid.\n\nChiba was a star in Japan and was best known to Western audiences for his memorable role as the swordsmith in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill.\n\nHe enjoyed an on-screen career spanning five decades, which also included the 1970s Street Fighter trilogy and 2006's The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift.\n\nHis agent Timothy Beal said he was \"a humble, caring and friendly man\".\n\nBeal told the AFP news agency it was \"such tragic news\", adding: \"He was a great friend and an awesome client.\"\n\nPaying tribute online, Mortal Kombat actor Lewis Tan wrote: \"A true action legend. Your films are eternal and your energy an inspiration.\"\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which is responsible for the Oscars, also said he was a \"legend\" who \"blended toughness with depth\".\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

Following in the footsteps of Bruce Lee, he then landed roles in Japanese films and TV series, including with the influential Toei studio.\n\nHe made a name for himself outside his own country in Street Fighter as the ruthless martial arts mercenary and anti-hero Takuma Tsurugi.\n\n\"For me, the most enjoyable role to play is the bad guy,\" he told Jonathan Ross in a TV interview in 2007.\n\nThe crossover-hit film series caught the eye of a young Tarantino, and almost 30 years later the director would cast him to play Hattori Hanzo in 2003's Kill Bill - Volume 1.\n\nThe popular character was a samurai-turned-sushi chef who came out of retirement to forge a sword for the Bride, played by Uma Thurman.\n\nHe reprised the role in Kill Bill: Vol 2. Chiba also appeared in Kinji Fukasaku's 2003 film Battle Royale II: Requiem, as well as Justin Lin's instalment of the Fast and Furious franchise.\n\nThe former gymnast had been set due to work on Outbreak Z, an upcoming zombie movie starring Wesley Snipes."
