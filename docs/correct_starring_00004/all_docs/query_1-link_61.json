        "text": "The scene I am going to analyse is a 10 minute fight sequence which was from action packed, revenge thriller Kill Bill Vol 1. This final confrontation is by the main lead actress Uma Thruman as “The Bride” as she concludes and important chapter in her tactical plan to get back at Bill for murdering her family, the only person who stands in front for her is Lucy liu “O-Ren Ishii”. I have seen this movie and know it is filled with different Micro themes to talk about and the 10 minute time allows me to go into detail.\n\nThe Mise en scene\n\nThe setting\n\nThe first interesting part of the Mise en scene I had noticed straight away was the scenes setting where the fight sequence was taken place. The bride is battling an army of foes in a blood shed battle held in a restaurant? Restaurants are supposed to be a nice, quite and pleasant place where families can get together and enjoy each others company. That idea for Kill Bill Vol 1 for that event change the whole concept of “Peace, comforting and family unity”. It was almost as if the film director did this on purpose based on the fact that “The bride” and “O-Ren Ishii” used to be part of a family as the trained together, fight together and conquered together. So to put these two characters together one final time, that itself was the reunion of two long lost family relatives setting the score.\n\nThe décor was found within the colours of the characters clothing and also where each character was position within the scene. O-Ren Ishii is the main villain who is wearing peaceful, bright, robes for this event. She stands at the top main floor looking down at The bride, the hench men who O-Ren sends after to kill the bride are wearing black outfits as they rush towards the bride with weaponry. O-Ren Ishii wearing the bright white clothing looks as if she is the hope for Bill to make sure that the bride wont make it to him in the end. She looks more powerful and dominating without even moving a muscle as she is placed at the top of the stairs. The bride is wearing bright yellow warm colours which could represent her emotion of been angry and frustrated of all things she has had to deal with.\n\nThe costume\n\nThe costume choice for this movie has to be one of the most iconic colours ever to be shown in a mixed martial arts movie. The bright yellow and black line design. Audiences who are fascinated by Martial arts would automatically recognise whom warn this colours in the past, it was non other then Bruce lee himself. Audiences will feel a slight sense of hope for The bride as she battles an army in this traditional clothing because of the guy whom worn this first so happened to be the best mixed marital artist ever to be known. Even though its been years since Bruce lee has passed, to see the bride wear yellow and black gear design makes audiences feel as if she represents us as we are fans of old mixed martial artist. It makes relate to the character and can complete relate to her level of been inspired and then becoming an inspiration for others.\n\nThe cinematography\n\nThe cinematography was used really well within this scene to create express different meanings from each camera angle been shot of every character. This shows the audiences that the film director know exactly where to position each camera and completely understood what type of emotion and a level of intensity he was going to pour out. The close up shots were used to capture detail within the scene as well as the emotion been shown on each characters face.\n\nWhen on of the main villains (NOT O-REN) threw a chain with a mace on the end hit the wooden stand, the close up shot captured the splitters of the wood exploding out of the stand. You could see the amount of damage been show in this close up shot which made me feel anxious enough to imagine how dangerous it would be if it hit the bride.\n\nThe brides face expression told it all, it summed up the whole film through the exhaustion and pain she had to go through in this one movie. The close up shot capture the detail of the cuts going cross her face as well as her facial expression of her looking warned out. We feel as the audience begin to feel the warn down feeling as if we are the bride.\n\nAnother good use of cinematography was when the bride was in the centre and she was surrounded and isolate in a box fully of Hench men. The camera angle was a tilt shot from her feet to the ceiling but as the camera was facing down you see the Hench men gathering around her in a square shape. The camera angle shot gives us a Ghost view on the scene, it makes it look like we are looking down on the characters without been noticed. This goes back to Mise en scene when it talks about expressionism, for her to be in a box shaped showed isolation in an obvious way. However for her to find away to over come the box shaped Hench men showed her of thinking outside of the box.\n\nThe sound\n\nThe sound for within this scene was very important and was also unusually but fun to listen to what confused myself and perhaps other audiences. This movie had a massive funky 60’s theme what collaborated with mixed martial arts east Asia culture and it actually worked well. There is a scene where the bride is trying to avoid been hit by a mace, she drives herself up and dodges with a backflip, but you hear a funky 60’s siren. The sound effects appears to be nostalgia to the previous Bruce lee movies which back then did use funky sound effects which made the scenes look more dramatic.\n\nThe diegetic sound for this fight sequence was the main key for this entire fight scene more then the 60’s theme. Here’s why. What I had noticed was majority of the fight scene didn’t have music been played, the only noise you could hear was what was producing the sound which could be the characters talking, weapons moving, people breathing and so on. The first part of the fight scene, you didn’t hear music at all only the sound of moving objects been overly dramatically used for the film.\n\nOne villain picked up chain and dragged it, you would hear a loud giggle sound of the metal chains rubbing against each other. When the villain began to swing the chain in circles, the sound of the chains moving in motion sounded like a heavy wind flying effect. This attention to detail made audiences feel highly aware of how dangerous this fight seen was supposed to be. The villain wrapped the chains around the brides neck and began to pull, the sound which was used was a rope been tighten as a sound effect. It made you understand how tight the chains were and how much stronger they were getting, to the point you could see the character begin to struggle.\n\nThe editing\n\nThe editing was used mainly for sound and placing each clip together to bring the story to life but in more depth and detail. The sound was edited in a way where once you would see the bride finder herself getting ready to fight the next opposition, a cool hippy music will begin to play in the background. However, as soon as the fight starts, the music would cut out completely and the fight is take more seriously.\n\nThe clips been placed together perfectly showed a different perspective of the trouble the bride found herself in. You would see one camera shot of the bride in a Box shape from a camera angle above ground, then the next clip would show a panning shot of the bride patiently looking around which was in sync with the camera movement as well.\n\nThe performances\n\nThe performance of each cast member really did create the character been explored in different parts of the fight sequence. The actresses performances needed to be spot on based on what type of style this movie is, which is an action martial arts film. Lucy Liu acted her role very well and was more humble as the villain then the main character. She made her villain look patient, gentle and relaxed in a demanding way.\n\nUma Thruman as the bride performed her character as an emotional individual which made completely sense. After following the storyline from start to finish, the main lead actress needed to show different signs of emotion and distress. At the same time in the fight sequence her character shown a high level of determination and focus to get the job done."
