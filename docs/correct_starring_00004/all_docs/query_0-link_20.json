Vintage oversize borderless reference photograph of Quentin Tarantino providing instruction to Uma Thurman on the set of the 2003 film. Thurman wears her iconic yellow track suit. Struck on Fujicolor Crystal Archive paper stock.\n\nThe first entry in Tarantino's bloody two-part female vigilante film. A female samurai assassin wakes from a four-year coma following a sadistic attack, and resolves to seek revenge on her former colleagues for their betrayal. A love letter to the glory days of martial arts cinema of the 1970s and 1980s, with a grindhouse temperament and even nods to giallo, incorporating practical effects in lieu of computer-generated imagery, and with nods as usual to samurai and other exploitation films throughout.\n\nShot on location in Los Angeles, Pasadena, and Lancaster, California; Tokyo, Japan; and Austin, Texas.\n\n12 x 8 inches. Near Fine.\n\n[Book #149658]"
