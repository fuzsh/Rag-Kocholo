        "text": "Lucy Liu was one among the three uniquely talented women of the squad in the McG film, Charlie’s Angels (2000). With Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore by her side, she quickly made a name for herself after the movie launched her into the Hollywood limelight. Soon after, she landed a career-defining role in the Quentin Tarantino movies, Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Kill Bill Vol. 2.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Lucy Liu’s introduction into the big leagues didn’t go over as smoothly as one would expect. Her time on the set of McG’s film brought her face-to-face with Hollywood veteran and comedy legend Bill Murray and the acquaintance wasn’t mutually pleasing.\n\nAlso read: Bill Murray Reveals Why He Rejected The Role Of Batman\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLucy Liu’s Altercation With Bill Murray\n\nFor longer than anyone can remember, Bill Murray has been a recognizable face in the Hollywood sphere. His name has become synonymous with a deadpan delivery and his comedic timing is always exceptional. Murray’s film, Groundhog Day, is still a refreshing watch and perhaps one of his most remembered masterpieces.\n\nAlso read: Hollywood Legend Bill Murray Confirms MCU Villain Role In Ant-Man 3\n\nA loved and respected veteran in the artistic sphere, Murray had his bad moments. On the set of Charlie’s Angels, Bill Murray once stopped a scene mid-progress to comment on the acting techniques (or lack thereof) of fellow actor, Lucy Liu. A source said, Murray pointed at Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu in that order and remarked: “I get why you’re here, and you’ve got talent….but what in the hell are you doing here. You can’t act!” The source then added:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“At that, Liu blew her lid and attacked Murray, wildly throwing punches. The actors had to be separated to opposite corners of the room while they lobbed verbal hand grenades at each other.With a Columbia Pictures gun to their heads, both actors would publicly downplay in incident but insiders know better. Bill Murray would not do any sequel with Liu attached and was subsequently replaced by Bernie Mac.”\n\nAlso read: Invincible: 12 Actors & The Characters They Could Play In A Live-Action Movie\n\nDrew Barrymore Speaks Out in Support of Liu\n\nLucy Liu recalled the incident while appearing on the Asian Enough podcast and said:\n\n“Some of the language was inexcusable and unacceptable, and I was not going to just sit there and take it. So, yes, I stood up for myself, and I don’t regret it. Because no matter how low on the totem pole you may be or wherever you came from, there’s no need to condescend or to put other people down. And I would not stand down, and nor should I have.”\n\nAlso read: Drew Barrymore Apologises For Her Comments on Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrew Barrymore who was also present during the altercation on the said day later remarked during one of her episodes on The Drew Barrymore Show:\n\n“What really happened was Bill was just in a – you know, comedians can be a little dark sometimes – and he just came in in a bad mood. What you have to know is how much Lucy stood up for herself and that was the great thing that came out of an unfortunate circumstance. She literally said, ‘I do not accept that kind of behaviour from you.’ And we all supported her and backed her up and we moved forward.”"
