        "text": "“Give me any random idea and I can write a story from it.”\n\nThis is how I used to think of myself back when I first started to write with an eye toward selling stories. I was twenty years old, and up to that point, the ability to write, such as it was, was the only visible talent I could muster. Or perhaps not the only talent. I had a bit of ego to go along with it, something I’d heard was a necessary ingredient to one who thought enough of their craft that people would be willing to pay to read it.\n\nSome people are slow learners, and in the classroom of writers, I just may be among the slowest. It took more than three decades of writing and the occasional story sale, to teach me lessons that I probably could have learned in a year, had I been more focused, had less ego, and been more open to discovery about myself. I’m not sure even now, as I write this, that I have fully grasped those lessons, but I have learned things along the way about writing and about myself. Let me tell you a story.\n\nIn late December 2023, while on holiday in Florida, I happened upon an article that described a goal matrix that Shohei Ohtani, the major league baseball phenom, created when he was only 17 years old. This matrix centered around 9 areas and had the goal of being drafted first in the MLB draft. I was impressed by this and thought I could use a similar matrix to jump start my writing. I set myself a goal of writing 100 stories over the next 7 years, or so–about 1 story per month. Why 100 stories? Because every story is practice and practice helps to improve the craft. I was never prolific with my fiction writing and I figured if I could write 100 stories, that would be all the practice I’d need to hone my skills to the level I knew they could reach. I used the Ohtani’s model to build up support structure for achieving that goal. Here is my matrix:\n\nJanuary 2024 would be the month for Story #1. To meet my goal I needed to complete a first and a second draft of a story but I didn’t need to take it beyond that if I didn’t want to. That meant I needed a story idea. “Give me any random idea and I can find a story from it.” It just to happened that I had an idea for a story that never worked out, but sitting on the lanai in the warm Florida winter, it occurred to me that the problem with my idea was that it was too big. If I narrowed the scope of it, I could work very well. All of the sudden the idea caught fire. I could see the scenes as clear as day. It took all my effort to hold off writing until January 1. When the New Year rolled around, I begin to write the story. By January 5 I’d completed the first draft. By January 11, I had my second draft, and it wasn’t even halfway through the month. The story almost wrote itself. I spent January 12 and 13 doing some edits and the story was finished. A few days later, on January 18, I started the next story. By February 21, that story had gone nowhere and I knew the goal I’d set myself was a ridiculously silly one. I stopped writing entirely.\n\nI stopped writing, but I didn’t stop thinking about writing. Why didn’t the second story work? It was a decent idea, so what was wrong? After all, give me any random idea and I can make a story from it, right?\n\nMore than thirty years of writing has changed my view of this. I can probably write a story from any random idea, but rarely could I write a good story from any random idea. Why not? It turns out that not all ideas are equal. Some are better than others. This would seem like an obvious lesson for a writer to learn fairly early on, but it is a difficult lesson to see with an ego blocking your view. I see it now, though, plain as day. Not all ideas are equal, and for me at least, it doesn’t make sense to waste energy on a lesser idea just to say that I wrote a story about it. With all of the talent I can muster, I’m just not capable of turning a lesser idea into a great story.\n\nHow to I know if an idea is good? This is hard to describe because it is instinct. There is a feeling I get when an idea takes hold of me. The idea consumes me. I get excited about it. I pace around my office, sitting, standing, impatient to start writing. The idea is a spark that ignites furnace inside me and I can’t stop until the fuel has burned itself out. This sounds vague, I know, but it is one of those “I know it when I feel it” kind of emotions. Looking back, my most successful stories came from these kinds of ideas. I suspect part of the reason that the very first stories I wrote when I was getting start are so embarrassingly bad in retrospect is not because I lacked talent, but because I lacked a filter for ideas. I wrote stories for every idea I had.\n\nThe story I wrote back in January came from a good idea. The furnace burned hot when I wrote it. Ultimately, it because the first story I’ve submitted to a magazine in over a decade. The next story I tried writing was not a particularly good idea and it was therefore doomed from the start. It took me longer to see that, but when I did, and I considered it, I began to see that I’d been thinking about how I go about writing stories almost from the beginning.\n\nWhile I might be someone who can write a story for any random idea, I cannot write a good story for any random idea. I need a good idea. And while I am rarely at a loss for a story idea (I’ve accumulated so many over the decades that I could live the rest of my lift without ever having a new idea and still have plenty to write), I am not one who frequently has a good story idea. Ego and impatience have conspired against me in this regard. Good ideas come when they come. This is just the way my mind works. They may not come frequently, but they always come, and accepting this has changed the way I think about writing.\n\nThere have been other lessons. I’ve always felt the need to track what I write. I’m fascinated by the process of constructing a story. I frequently imagine my favorite authors, sitting in their offices, tapping away at a keyboard, or scribbling on a legal pad. How do they construct stories. And since they are so successful, shouldn’t that mean that if I follow their recipe, I’ll be successful, too. I track my writing so that I can go back and reconstruct what worked and what didn’t. In reality, I’ve probably spent two or three times the amount of time, effort, and creativity on the tracking and the infrastructure, than on the creative act. I’d built elaborate templates, I’d write scripts to automate things, always telling myself that these activities will allow me more time to write, and always spending more and more time perfecting these systems and not writing. I did this even in college, in the early 1990s, creating macros in Microsoft Word for DOS 5.5 to help track my writing. I’ve been doing it for more than 30 years.\n\nRecently, I asked myself why and I didn’t have a good answer. In the past I’ve told myself that I’ve done this to learn about my process: I can go back and see the evolution of a story from idea, to draft, to final draft, to acceptance, to publication and then, like some digital archeologist, dig through my files and discern what I did to make this particular story successful. But in thinking hard about this, I finally saw the two flaws that I’d overlooked all along. First, every story is different and what works in one case doesn’t necessary work in the other. Second: I have never gone back to dig through the history of a story to see what worked or what didn’t. This is one of those ideas that seems good in theory, and is never used in practice.\n\nFor a long time I was focused on regimenting my time. I’d work out calendars to ensure that I had time set aside to write each day, and then, when that window came, whether I was ready or not, I’d sit down to write. It was often painful. It took decades for me to learn this, but for me, the creative spark comes when it comes, and I can’t summon it at will, as much as I wish I could.\n\nIf I could go back in time and do it all over again, I probably wouldn’t change anything. I know myself well enough to know that I have to learn things in a certain way for them to finally settle in and stick. However, if I were to go forward taking the three decades of lessons I’ve learned from writing, I’d alter my approach in several ways.\n\nI’d curate good ideas. I’d rather be able to say, “Give me a good idea and I’m much more likely to produce an interesting story.”\n\nI’d be patient and not stress when well was dry. Decades have shown me that it always fills up again. It’s just a matter of time.\n\nI’d write when the mood hit me and for as little or as long as I wanted, wherever I happened to be.\n\nI’d eschew all formal infrastructure; I’d no longer worry about tracking my work; I’d open up a document in Microsoft Word and begin typing.\n\nIt’s been more than four months since the well ran dry, and that feels like a long time, but experience has taught me it always fills up again. And so it has. I’m writing again. I’ve what I think is a good idea that I’m excited about. I’m writing when the mood strikes me, and I’m not worrying about tracking my work.\n\nI’m just having fun.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.

Isaac Asimov kept one, and I liked the idea. As he wrote, “I began with the intention of recording everything of significance each day. As time went on, however… my diary became a kind of compact literary and social record of my life.” He went on: “The diaries are a series of reference books, for me, a way of finding out when something happened and in exactly what order things happen .” Memory, you see, is fallible. These arguments convinced me to start a diary in April 1996, which means I’ve been keeping the diary in one form or another for 28 years. Today, I wish I’d started keeping it much sooner.\n\nI try to remember this each time I sit down to update my diary. I find myself frequently starting a day’s entry with the words, “Up at 5:30am after a (good / fair / poor) night’s sleep…” When I flip through the entries, many of them are dry accounts of my day. Over the last few years, I’ve tried to be more expressive, using the diary to argue, to debate, to ponder, and to just get stuff out of my head so that I don’t have to think about it, and yet safe in the knowledge that it is recorded somewhere. Yesterday, however, I was reminded of another reason why I keep the diary, and the value it has for me.\n\nIt rained most of the day and I felt antsy because I didn’t get out on my usual early morning walk. A break in the rain came around 9am, however, and I dashed out for an extended walk before the spigot was turned back out. Usually, I listen to a book while I walk (currently, Oranges by John McPhee), but yesterday I happened to be listening to Sirius XM’s “80s on 8” top 40 countdown for this week in 1982. I was 8 years old at the beginning of the decade and 18 when the decade ended. The music of that era forms the soundtrack to an important part of my life growing up. Music is a kind of memory-enhancer for me. Just as I can recall where I was when I read any particular book, when I hear song, it brings back clear, powerful memories. In the late spring of 1982, I was a few months past 10 years old, and living in Warwick, Rhode Island. As I walked, the songs I heard conjured memories I’d hadn’t thought about in decades.\n\nFor example, when Joan Jett’s cover of “Crimson and Clover” came on, I remembered suddenly, that I had a ’45 that had “I Love Rock-n-Roll” on one side, and “Crimson and Clover” on the opposite side. I remember that I loved the former and didn’t think much of the latter. But the thought of that album–which I’d completely forgotten about–put me in mind of my bedroom in that house in Warwick. The house was a raised ranch, and my bedroom was in southeast corner, with a window facing south over the driveway, and east over the front yard. If I tried hard, I could picture the room in a vague way. I could see where the beds were located. I could see the closet door on the north wall by east-facing window. I remembered staring at the closet door for hours the night after coming home from seeing Poltergeist in the theater. My bed was on the south wall and my brother’s bed was on the north wall. But the vision is blurred, as if looking at it through smoked glass.\n\nHow is it that I could live in that house for four years — 1,500 days! — and my memory of it be so blurry. For that matter, how is it that I can’t recall the details of any given day? I can remember, even as far back as when I lived in Somerset, New Jersey, laying in bed to take a nap, five years old perhaps, and thinking thoughts like, “When I am ten years old, I should remember this day when I was just five and wishing I was ten.” In later years, I’d lay in bed, staring at a dark ceiling and think, “When I’m fifty,” — in some inconceivably distant future — “I should remember the time when I was 15 laying here in bed, and thinking about all the years that separate these two people.”\n\nToo many of those years are obscured by dark glass. I don’t think it is that I have forgotten, so much as I have lost the references to the place where those memories are stored. Music, in that sense, is a kind index to my memory. My diary is another index and that is its real value. Just as hearing Joan Jett conjured images of my childhood bedroom, my diary serves an index to the memory of my life. Considered in this light, I don’t feel bad about diary entries that begin by reminding me that I am an early riser. I’ve tried more and more to make the diary as broad in index as I can. Where I used to write things like, “Spent the afternoon at the pool club with the Edgertons,” I now try to be more specific, providing at least the skeleton of conversations we had, topics we discussed. Memory indices fade and I figure the more detail I provide, the more chance a future version of my will skim a page, and quickly recall the scene therein.\n\nI suppose, in some sense, my diary is the closest I can come to backing up the index of my memory, a kind of database transaction log that can be replayed at any point. I think this is the real reason why I keep updating my diary with mundane details and brilliant insights alike. It is imperfect, but more persistent than my own memory will likely be. When I flip through the diary to a random day, I’ve forgotten most of the details of that day until I read them. Once read the, the memories come flooding back, the details fill in.\n\nMemory is imperfect to begin with. By writing about my day on that day when events are fresh in my memory, I get them down as accurately as I can manage. Of course, there is certainly some bias that slips in. Perception itself is a kind of bias. I’m okay with that. It is the Rashoman effect. Someone reading an entry of a particular day may remember the events of that day differently from what I remembered. Usually the differences are small and meaningless, except that perhaps they help describe aspects of the observers’ (mine or theirs) personality.\n\nBesides, my notes and diaries have given me a reputation among friends and family as someone who can answer all kinds of questions. Whether or not they like or agree with the answers my diary provides is another story.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.

What follows is my top 10 best book reads of 2023 and some of my favorite articles of 2023. For those interested in more details of my overall reading for 2023, see the section that follow this which summarizes my reading for 2023.\n\nMy Favorite Books for 2023\n\n1. Avid Reader: A Life by Robert Gottlieb\n\nI have to admit that I didn’t know who Robert Gottlieb was at the start of 2023, although I’ve read several of the books he has edited. Then, in July, I came across a documentary called Turn Every Page about the relationship between Robert A. Caro and his editor Robert Gottlieb. It was a great documentary, directed by Gottlieb’s daughter, Lizzie Gottlieb. I’ve read all of Caro’s books (indeed, I’ve recently acquired a personalized signed copy of his short book, Working) and I’m always fascinated by people who make a single subject their life’s work (see also: Will Durant and Dumas Malone). After watching the documentary, I searched for books by Gottlieb and discovered he’d written a memoir, Avid Reader: A Life.\n\nNot since reading Isaac Asimov’s 3-volume autobiography have I come across such a detailed inside look at the book publishing world. It was a delightful, fascinating read that spoke to me on many levels. I think of myself as an avid reader, but I am lazy in comparison to Gottlieb. I didn’t want the book to end, and when it finally ended, I did something I’ve done only one other time in the 28 years I’ve been keeping my reading list: I immediately started the book over and read it a second time. And you know what, it was even better on the second go-around. It was, hands down, my favorite read of 2023.\n\n2. Les Miserables by Victor Hugo\n\nYears ago, Kelly and I went to a local performance of Les Mis. I don’t remember much about it, but the book, Les Miserables, has always intrigued me for its size and popularity. I decided to give it a try in the spring. I found that almost from the first page, I couldn’t put the book down. It had a bit of everything, and it was fascinating. I loved the non-sequitur essays in the book and the rhythm of the language (I read the Julie Rose translation).\n\nLater in the summer, when we were in Paris, I wanted to seek out the places in the novel, but we were there for only a short time, and I was a little sad that the city no longer looked way it was pictured in Hugo’s novel.\n\nI estimate that I’ve read something in the neighborhood of 550 novels in my life (a little over 500 since 1996) and when I finished Les Miserables it instantly jumped to the top stop of best novels I’ve ever read.\n\nIt was also the longest book I read in 2023 but, as it turns out, only the 5th longest book I’ve read overall, beaten out by The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany by William L. Shirer (1,616 pages), Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898 by Mike Wallace and Edwin G. Burrows (1,423 pages), Executive Orders by Tom Clancy (1,358 pages), and The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York **by Robert A. Caro (1,345 pages).\n\n3/4. Stella Maris and The Passenger by Cormac McCarthy\n\nI read The Passenger for our book club, and I really liked it. I just had to read the follow-on book, Stella Maris, which I enjoyed even better. It is one of those rare novels that could be done as a play. These were the second and third Cormac McCarthy books I’ve read and so far, I’ve thought all of his books were excellent.\n\n5. Why We Love Baseball: A History in 50 Moments by Joe Posnanski\n\nI had been looking forward to Why We Love Baseball ever since Joe Posnanski announced it. Recall that my favorite book of 2021 was Joe Posnanski’s The Baseball 100. I was not disappointed. Joe writes so passionately about baseball. He is a modern-day Red Smith. There is a reason why I love Joe Posnanski’s writing.\n\n6. Doom Guy: Life In First Person by John Romero\n\nI was never really a Doom player, but I’ve been a software developer my entire life and it was fascinating to read about someone who grew up with computers in a manner similar to me, beginning with machines like a Commodore Vic-20 and copying code out of computer magazines. Doom Guy was a honest, fascinating read.\n\n7. Making It So: A Memoir by Patrick Stewart\n\nToward the end of each year, I tend to read Hollywood memoirs. They are a kind of guilty pleasure for me. Making It So by Patrick Stewart was one of these. This was a book that made me want to be an actor after reading it, always a good sign because it conveys its message so well.\n\n8. The Maniac by Benjamin Labatut\n\nReally smart people fascinate me. I read a fascinating biography of John von Neumann back in 2022, The Man from the Future by Ananyo Bhattacharya. So when I saw that there was a novel based on von Neumann’s life, The Maniac by Benjamin Labatut, I had to read it, and it was a fun, fantastic read.\n\nFavorite articles of 2023\n\nEarly in 2023, I wrote a script that sends me an email each evening with a random article from the variety of print magazines I get in the mail. Here is an example email from last night.\n\nI try to read a feature article every day of the year, and here are a few of the more than 300 that I read in 2023 that really stood out.\n\nBaseball and Time by Joe Posnanski — JoeBlogs (3/23)\n\nDown the River Roosevelt by Larry Rohter — Smithsonian (4/23)\n\nJudy Blume Goes All the Way by Amy Weiss-Meyer — Atlantic (4/23)\n\nA Love Letter to Riverside by David Danelski — UCR Magazine (Spring 2023)\n\nWhy People Hate Open Offices (Psychology) by George Musser — Scientific American (4/23)\n\nHow Baseball Saved Itself by Mark Leibovich — Atlantic (7-8/23)\n\nPostscript: Robert Gottlieb by David Remnick — New Yorker (6/26/2023)\n\n“How America Got Mean” by David Brooks — Atlantic (9/23)\n\n“17,517,490 Memories, Missing”[AliasDelimiter] by Megan Greenwall — Wired (9/23)\n\nInside the Revolution at OpenAI by Ross Andersen — Atlantic (9/23)\n\nThe Ones We Sent Away by Jennifer Senior — Atlantic (9/23)\n\nDreams of My Father by Karl Ove Knausgaard — Harpers (9/23)\n\nThe Golden Fleece by Joe Kloc — Harper’s (10/23)\n\nA Coder Considers the Waning Days of the Craft by James Somers — New Yorker (11/20/23)\n\nWhy the Godfather of A.I.

It’s a nice dream, but there are two reasons I know it is nothing more. For one thing, there are many reports, like Daniel Immerwahr’s “Beyond the Myth of Rural America” in a recent issue of The New Yorker, that wipe away the fog of nostalgia from rural life. For another, more practical reason, I think about how much tinkering I do in our house, and can only imagine how that would be magnified on a farm.\n\nWe bought this house four and a half years ago with the idea that there were a few things we wanted to do once we had it. First, there was the shed that we wanted to put in the backyard to give us some extra storage space. We got that taken care of pretty early. On the other hand, the French doors we wanted to put between my office and the living room have been hanging fire ever since we had the idea to put them in.\n\nOur house was originally built in the 1950s, but has since been completely gutted and rebuilt from the inside out. It has an open floor plan, and it had fairly new appliances when we moved it. And yet, there has still be a lot of tinkering. We’ve had to replace three-fifths of the kitchen appliances: new microwave, new dishwasher, and new disposal. I tried fixing the disposal myself when it would only hum, and it seemed I managed to fix it, only to discover later that I’d cracked the casing and water had been leaking from the disposal into a basin under the sink. We were lucky to discover this before the basin overflowed.\n\nWe have good-sized storage room downstairs that contains the furnace and water heater, and from the day we moved in, that storage room has been so full-to-the-brim that was impossible to go into the room without first taking stuff out. For years, I’d wanted to clear out that room and move stuff into the attic. But we had attic boards in the attic. Recently, while Kelly was in Europe, I put in a dozen or so attic boards and then spent a weekend purging the storage room, and moving stuff up into the attic. And not in any haphazard way, but I created a nice little aisle up there and sketched out a map of where things were located. When the job was done I needed a day just to recover from the soreness.\n\nI put in nice metal shelving on both sides of the storage room and we now have a usable walk-in pantry on one side, and place to store tools and other miscellany on the other side, and there is plenty of space to move about.\n\nWe’ve made small replacements in every bathroom in the house, from flappers to flush values to fill levers so that in any given bathroom, we have a toilet of Theseus.\n\nI’ve added more and more bookshelves to my office, replacing older, smaller ones with larger ones so that no wall is left out. I’ve replaced countless lightbulbs, and smoke detector batteries, the latter almost exclusively during the middle of the night.\n\nOur refrigerator stopped refrigerating recently and so I cleaned out the coils and removed the accumulated dust. Grateful for the spa day, our refrigerator started refrigerating once again.\n\nAfter the gas company shut off the gas to make some repairs to the gas meters on our street, our furnace failed to start up after the gas was turned back on. It was 22 years old and after some deliberation, we decided to replace it and the air conditioner (also 22 years old) with new models. This was a relief, albeit an expensive one. I knew from the day we bought the house we were going to eventually need to replace the HVAC system, it was just a matter of when.\n\nAt present there are five–make that, six light bulbs that need replacing and I’ve just been too busy tinkering with other things to replace them. There is a tented-in area on our deck, but the tent and frame were damaged in a wind storm and I haven’t had a chance to replace and repair them, respectively.\n\nFor a year now, I’ve been tinkering with our Kia, which doesn’t want to start on cold weather days. I’ve ruled out just about everything, even paying to have a perfectly good battery replaced just to prove that it wasn’t the culprit (it wasn’t). The car will always start, but sometimes, I have to press the start button 20 times before it decides to light up. Once started, the car runs fine and starts fine for the rest of the day. It never happens when the weather is above 50 degrees, and it is intermittent when it is below 50. This morning, when the temperature was 39, the car started right up. The dealer can never reproduce the problem, but I am determined to find the root cause.\n\nOur other car, which turned 20 years old this year, needed a new starter and some other work as well. It now runs fine, thanks to some tinkering.\n\nSome of this tinkering is spread out, separated by months of smooth sailing. Others come in waves. We had issues with the old car, refrigerator, water heater and furnace all in the span of about one month.\n\nIn his monthly One Man’s Meat column for Harper’s December 1941 issue , E.B. White details about 200 chores he has to do around his farm in Maine. I suspect that a White essay on a getting a root canal could make it seem like a joy, but when I consider the list of things, it is an awful lot of tinkering, and makes the tinkering we’ve done around the house these last four-and-a-half-years look like warm-up exercises. My farming daydreams will remain just that–daydreams. They are among my favorite daydreams and I wouldn’t tinker with them in the least.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.

I recall the magazine sitting around the table beside his chair. I would occasionally skim through it. I must have come across Stephen Jay Gould’s column, “This View of Life” at some point, but I can’t remember when. Besides, at time, I his columns were beyond my abilities. Even now, those columns push me to my limits.\n\nI say this because this year, I have finally gotten around to reading Gould’s books of essays that collect most of the 300 columns he wrote for Natural History. Unlike my usual practice, I’m not going through the collections in order of appearance, but instead, somewhat haphazardly. In order of my reading this year, I’ve made my way through the following volumes:\n\nEver Since Darwin: Reflections on Natural History\n\nThe Panda’s Thumb: More Reflections on Natural History\n\nDinosaur in a Haystack: Reflections in Natural History\n\nBully for Brontosaurus: Reflections in Natural History\n\nThe Flamingo’s Smile: Reflections in Natural History\n\nHen’s Teeth and Horses Toes: Further Reflections in Natural History\n\nLeonardo’s Mountain of Clams and Diet of Worms: Essays on Natural History\n\nEight Little Piggies: Reflections in Natural History\n\nDuring this year, I also managed to read Gould’s A Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History and The Mismeasure of Man.\n\nIf my research is correct, there are two more books of Natural History essays that I have yet to read: The Lying Stones of Marrakech and I Have Landed. I’m doubtful I’ll get through these two remaining books before the year is out because I have quite a few books in line ahead of them. But you never know.\n\nI came to essays primarily through Isaac Asimov’s science essay column in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction and I have written how at the time those essays taught me almost everything I know about science. Gould’s essays are much more challenging reads than Asimov’s essays were, but in some ways, the essays are more rewarding, and have introduced me to and instructed me in areas and methods of science with which I’d had little familiarity.\n\nOver the years I’ve developed a fondness for the science essay that places it in my personal pantheon of favorites as high–if not slightly higher–in ranking as the personal essay. One of the strengths of both Asimov’s and Gould’s essays is that they are personal in some regard. I imagine writing a future post that focuses on the history and value of the science essays, especially long-term essay columnists like Asimov and Gould and Martin Gardner, as well as their predecessors like Willie Ley and R.S. Richardson. In such an essay, I might wonder about the disappearance of regular science essays columns and explore that path in the same way Gould explores evolutionary dead-ends.\n\nBut here I wanted to talk about Gould’s essays and the impact they’ve had on me already. When I started reading them, back in May, I went in with the notion that they would be similar to Asimov’s given their popularity. In actual fact, the essays are nothing alike. In his wonderful editorial, “The Mosaic and the Plate Glass” (Isaac Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine, Oct. 1980), the Good Doctor expounds on his theory of writing. Mosaic writing is complex, layered, multifaceted writing; plate glass is clear and shows directly through to the point. He couldn’t have provided a better analogy for comparing Gould’s writing to his own, for when I began reading Ever Since Darwin, I recognized almost at once that this was mosaic writing to Asimov’s plate glass.\n\nAs I do with most books these day, I began with the audiobook edition of Ever Since Darwin, but I found the subject matter and the complexity of the writing to be enough of a challenge that I knew the audiobook editions alone wouldn’t be good enough. I needed the physical books to help follow along with Gould’s arguments. This is not so much a criticism of Gould’s writing as it my ability to understand the subject matter. Indeed, I found that I enjoyed Gould’s style of science writing more than I did Asimov’s. Asimov was a great explainer. He didn’t write down to the reader, but he often simplified concepts–a good thing for the lay reader.\n\nGould on the other hands wrote those essays for other professionals and expected that readers of the column would rise to the challenge. These essays are a challenge for me, but I enjoy that challenge, I enjoy puzzling my way through Gould’s arguments to make sure that I understand them. I come away from each one a better-equipped thinker.\n\nI ordered copies of the Gould collections I didn’t already have in hardcopy. That is to say, all of them except Dinosaur in a Haystack, which I picked up in college when it first came out, and which has been sitting on my shelf unread ever since–until this year. I found most of them easily enough, but a few were out of print and I had to locate them from secondhand bookshops online. I was mildly annoyed by this, until fortune stepped in, as it so often has, in my book-buying activity. One place had used copies of The Lying Stones of Marrakech and Leonardo’s Mountain Clams and the Diet of Worms and I ordered both. When they arrived I put them in their proper places on the shelf until I was ready to read them. As I mentioned, I haven’t yet read The Lying Stones of Marrakech, but one day, when I was pulling Leonardo’s Mountain of Clams… off the shelf, I noticed a sticker on The Lying Stones of Marrakech that read “SIGNED.” I flipped open the book and saw this:\n\nThe Lying Stones of Marrakech is the penultimate book in the series of essays and was published on April 11, 2000. Gould died in May 2002, which means the book must have been signed by Gould sometime in that 2-year span. It is a joy to have a signed Gould book in my collection.\n\nGould’s essays have had a notable effect on me. For thing, I’ve learned more about natural history than I ever knew before. The books have opened my eyes to the natural world around me. The range of subjects covered by the books is vast, although nearly always related to some aspect of evolution. They seems to cover everything, from how camouflage evolved in the natural world, to why no one will likely ever hit .400 in the major leagues again.\n\nRecently, for instance, I was out a morning walk. We have a lot of deer in the park woods in our area and seeing them munching along the bike path is a common site in the mornings and evenings. On this particular fall morning, the foliage was riotous, the bike path was covered in leaves, as was the floor of the woods that surrounded me on both sides as I walked.\n\nI would not have noticed the young deer to my left had it not raised its head. I caught the motion from the corner of my eye and when I looked there was the young deer standing among a background of similarly colored shrubs and leaves. Experience told me that if I saw one deer, there were likely others around, so I stopped and stood still and peered into the woods. At first, all I saw was a tangle of limbs and leaves that was almost too much to take in. But then as I watched, several deer emerged from that tangle in way that I can only describe as similar to the way the image in those stereograms from the 1980s emerged once you learned how to focus past them. One moment, I was looking at empty woods, the next it seemed full of deer.\n\nIf Asimov’s essays formed a foundation on the scientific method and way that science works (his essays were often steeped in the history of science), then Gould’s by comparison have been a graduate courses in the same subjects. Gould’s essays teach not only scientific method and logical thinking, but they challenge with edge cases, give examples of long-accepted arguments that are filled with fallacies, and breakdown the complexities of real science into its component parts. The history he delves into is often the history of science as a self-correcting process.\n\nLike many writers and scientists, Gould’s theories are sometimes seen as controversial. His theory of punctuated equilibrium raised eyebrows, and as I have been working my way through Gould’s essays, I’ve also been sure to read his critics–something his essays helped reinforce. I finally got around to reading Richard Dawkins’s The Selfish Gene. And I recently read Daniel C. Dennett’s memoir I’ve Been Thinking and his book Consciousness, Explained both of which have some criticism of Gould and his theories. I take these criticisms seriously, and I don’t yet understand all of theories well enough to make a good judgement as to where I fall. What I can say is that Gould’s essays are among the most intellectually challenging I have come across, and what a joy the experience of reading them has been.\n\nIndeed, I may have to read them again to full grasp the underlying theories Gould writes about. But I look forward to this task with enthusiasm. I am working my way toward reading another Gould book that has been sitting on my shelf unread for 21 years now: his magnum opus, The Structure of Evolutionary Theory. At 1,400 pages, it is a massive tome, and not without controversy and criticism, with some critics calling the book unreadable. I take this statement with a grain of salt. Gould’s essays are difficult but there is a beauty in that challenge, and I can see how any writing that isn’t spoon-fed to a reader can be characterized as “unreadable.” Gould often writes about how he goes to original sources as much as possible for many reasons, a good lesson in critical thinking, and one that I want to embrace by reading and judging The Structure of Evolutionary Theory on my own.\n\nBut that may be a project for 2024 and beyond.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.

It is something of a miracle in its dreamless quality and in its duration. When I awaken, just after 6 am, I realize that I have slept more than 8 hours, an achievement unparalleled in the annals of my life since cramming all night for an organic chemistry final thirty years ago. I feel both well-rested and lazy for slouching around so long. I dress and head out the door to explore.\n\nOur hotel, alas, is somewhat isolated. Walking down the long driveway and taking a couple of left turns takes me to an area that looks promising, and entirely asleep. Rome is not an early city, and it seems to me that Europe in general (the parts that we have and will visit) is not an early continent. As a Union they stick together as much in this as in their currency.\n\nZach and I head down to breakfast together, a preview of the breakfast we will have for much of the tour. It is a buffet with fruit and cheese and meats, as well as all kinds of breads, cakes, yogurts, and even some hot food like scrambled and fried eggs, bacon, and sausage. There is juice as well.\n\nOnce the rest of the family is awake, we decide what we want to do for the day. Our tour officially starts late this afternoon, so we have most of the day to roam Rome, and we decide to start our day at the Trevi Fountain and wander from there.\n\nMixed Signals\n\nInstead of taking the subway, we decide to Uber into the city proper. There are mixed signals about Uber in Rome. As we made our way through part of the city yesterday, I recall seeing signs in certain places indicating that Uber is illegal. Yet at the airport, Uber has massive advertisements all over the place, extolling its virtues for getting around Rome.\n\nI finally solved the dilemma to my satisfaction by realizing that the signs I saw about Uber being illegal were at taxi ranks. Maybe Ubers couldn’t pick people up from those locations, but anywhere else was fair game. I order an Uber and one appears for the us five minutes later outside the hotel lobby and carries us through the streets of Rome to the Trevi Fountain. As we get closer to the fountain the ride gets more interesting. The streets narrow and deform into cobblestone. At times, I am amazed that this big car can squeeze through these narrow passages. This is a different part of Rome than what we experienced yesterday.\n\nFinally, the car stops just short of the fountains and lets us out. It was a short and easy ride, and we now know that Uber works just fine in Rome.\n\nTwo Views of Rome\n\nTrevi Fountain is full of people, a major tourist attraction. It is the most crowded place we have seen thus far and we don’t linger here long. The water of the fountain is turquoise and glistens with countless coins that have been tossed in. I give a Euro coin to each of the kids for them to toss into the fountain. Looking around, it was hard to imagine that the Aqua Virgo once terminated here, one of the aqueducts that carried water to Rome. When I visit old places, I try to mentally peel back the modern layers to see the ancient, but I found it difficult to here. Perhaps it was the crowds.\n\nLooking at the modern city of Rome, overlaying the ancient city like strata of rock enclosing fossils in the Burgess Shale, my favorite Seneca quote occurred to me:\n\nThe time will come when diligent research over long periods will bring to light things which now lie hidden. A single lifetime, even though entirely devoted to the sky, would not be enough for the investigation of so vast a subject… And so this knowledge will be unfolded through long successive ages. There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them… Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us will have been effaced. Our universe is a sorry little affair unless it has something for every age to investigate… Nature does not reveal her mysteries once and for all.\n\nNatural Questions, Book 7, somewhere in the 1st century A.D.\n\nSeneca was certainly right, but the inverse is also true, I think now, standing beside the Trevi Fountain where an ancient aqueduct once carried water to the Romans. It seems amazing to think that such a city existed more than 2,000 years ago with its modern roads and aqueducts, with its art and war machines. Put another way, Seneca may have been selling himself and his people short. They managed to accomplish some amazing feats. And of course, what will people think of our “modern” Rome far in the future, when memory of us will have been effaced?\n\nWe wander away from the Trevi Fountain, away from the crowds and into the shade of the narrow streets of this part of Rome. I am trying to see the old city, but there is too much to see, too much happening, my head is turning this way and that, my eye caught be an antiquarian bookseller (closed) and then by a gorgeous narrow alleyway and then by tiny cars that navigate the streets. In the tourist areas, there are people who approach us trying to hand us all kinds of trinkets and I think of Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations and what he learned from Diognetus:\n\nNot to waste time on nonsense. Not to be taken in by conjurors and hoodoo artists with their talk about incantations and exorcism and all the rest of it.\n\nAnd yet some of it is inescapable when overwhelmed, and we manage to acquire at least one bracelet for a Euro or two out of sheer bewilderment.\n\nThe problem is focus: I can’t seem to find mine. I think of Marcus’s admonition:\n\nRemember how long you’ve been putting this off, how many extensions the gods gave you, and you didn’t use them. At some point you have to recognize what world it is that you belong to; what power rules it and from what source you spring; that there is a limit to the time assigned you, and if you don’t use it to free yourself it will be gone and will never return.\n\nBut that only raises my anxiety. I am well aware of the time limits. I want to see everything I can in that time. Later, I’ll learn that perhaps this was a mistake, but now, in the heat of the day with the roar of traffic and the unfamiliar signs and the ancient builds, all I can do is gasp for air like a goldfish out of its bowl.\n\nWhat better for calm and solace than the quiet of a church. We find that we have wandered to the steps of Piazza Santi Apostoli, where the Church of the Apostles resides. There is a calming quiet within, which reminds me that churches are high on my list for quiet places to read. Despite the calming effect, the architecture takes my breath away, its Byzantine style a jumble of busyness that makes it difficult to focus the eye in one place, so that the interior of the church, despite its quiet, compliments the rush of activity out on the streets.\n\nSitting among the pews, I try to imagine what it was like to construct such a building. Perhaps only Ken Follett’s Pillars of the Earth can come close to recreating what such an undertaking must have been like.\n\nBack on the street we wander some more, coming to another church, this time the Church of the Apostles were inside, I find the tomb of St. Ignatius Loyola as ornate as any as I have ever seen.\n\nGelato and Ghettos\n\nJust across the street from the Church of the Apostles is a small gelato shop. We stop in for gelato and a restroom. We are successful with the former, but not the latter. Actually, I am the only one who doesn’t partake in the gelato. The best gelato I’ve ever had was in Venice, Italy, some 16 years ago, and I have decided that I am holding off on gelato until we arrive in Venice.\n\nRestrooms are at a premium in Italy, it seems. Either culturally, or because of the age of the place, it was not designed for restrooms. Public facilities are available here and there for 50 Euro cents. And coffee shops often have facilities available for use with a purchase. Ultimately, Kelly finds just such a shop across from some excavated Roman ruins, Largo Argenta. While the girls are in the restroom, I lean on railing and take in the excavation. Here is a place where I can see some of the ancient city whose streets the like of Marcus Aurelius and Seneca walked in their day.\n\nOnce again, I find it difficult to separate the modern from the ancient, even looking down at the old stone walls and pillars. The modern look of the surrounding buildings, the sounds of motors, the rumble of buses distract from the presence of mind required to see the city as it was 2,000 years ago. The tranquility of the past is as allusive as any other getaway, as Marcus Aurelius well knew:\n\nPeople try to get away from it all–to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic; you can get away from it anytime you like. By going within.\n\nMeditations, Marcus Aurelius\n\nHere I play the role of the idiot, wanting but unable to escape to this glorious past that I can almost see, save for the modern distractions. And so I write about and in so writing, I become Macbeth’s lament: “Life is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.”\n\nThese maudlin thoughts are the result of jet-lag, I’m sure. I recover soon enough. We have been making our way slowly toward the Pantheon, but I note on a map that in the opposite direction, about the same distance, is the Jewish Ghetto. Someone (an uncle, a friend?) told me that if I was in Rome, I should go see the Jewish Ghetto, and so we decide to change direction. It is not a long walk, but the result is mildly disappointing for once again, I am unable to visualize what this place must have looked like in ancient times. Now it is another cobblestone street straddled by low buildings that house kosher restaurants.\n\nAt the far end of the street we discover some of Ancient Rome and my mood brightens a bit. Down a flight of steps, we enter an area containing the Theater of Marcellus and the Portico of Octavia. Here, although the path, are scattered ruins, overturned columns, blocks of stone that once served as part of a structure. Here, many of the modern elements of Rome were hidden and I could catch glimpses of the ancient city.\n\nThe theater, which can be seen in the background of the central image above, was a project that began with Julius Caesar, but wasn’t completed until the reign of Augustus. The Portico of Octavia was refurbished by Augustus, and later twice burned to the ground in 80 A.D.and again, after being rebuilt, in 203 A.D. It was damaged by an earthquake 500 years later, making one wonder whether or not it was meant to stand the test of time. But it had and we stand before it underneath the hot Roman summer sun.\n\nI reach out and touch stone, once part of a structure, and wonder, as I have done in the vomitoriums of the theater in Miletus, and the castles in Ireland, what other ancient people, slave, peasant, or emperor touched this same stone and in doing so, made some tenuous connection with the distant future, as I make the same connection with the distant past.\n\nTourist Traps\n\nFinally, we made our way to the Pantheon (not to be confused with the Parthenon, which I did both in my notes and in the first draft of this piece). We don’t go inside. The lines are long, it is hot, the kids are becoming a little restless from all of the walking. And the crowds are large. I wonder if the crowds were this large in the past when this served as a Roman temple instead of tourist trap? It is a well-preserved building, and when I look at it from certain angles, it stirs images of ancient times. The large square on which it resides helps with this, but the modern splash of color and clothing almost at once dash the illusion.\n\nI am hot and tired and the crowds are beginning to get to me. I have mostly stopped taking pictures. We soon escape the crowds into a narrow street that provides some shade and quiet. There are a few stores catering to tourists, as well as a Coop. Kelly and the kids decide to look around the Coop while I stand across the street and people-watch. I am trying to turn the crowds of modern tourists into ancient Romans, and ancient travelers, but my tired imagination is failing me. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and it is folly to try to see it all in a day, a week, or even a month.\n\nWe move on, making our way to Novona Square, and this is where we are accosted by people who attempt to hand us bracelets and other trinkets and then ask for money in return. We escape all but one, who hands Zach a bracelet before he can refuse. He then asks for a few Euros. I hand him a 2-Euro coin I have in my pocket. He takes it but asks for “paper money,” presumably because the lowest denomination that I am aware of is 5-euros. This we decline. “For my family,” he says as we are walking away, but I just shrug with a “whatareyagonnado?” look.\n\nAs we leave Novona Square, I note the contrast between the ancient and the modern when I see large billboard ad behind the fountain at one end of the square. It makes me wonder if I had been here 2,000 years ago, would I have seen advertisements painted on the building surfaces?\n\nWe find our way across the Tiber on bridge teeming with peddlers of all kinds of junk. I find that if I walk across the bridge with the same blank look and attitude one wears when walking the streets of Manhattan, I come through the other side unscathed. On the other side we stand before the Castle Sant’Angelo. We decide not to tour the castle, in part because we are all tired. But this is the place where the emperor Hadrian is entombed–the same Hadrian who built a wall with his name in Britain.\n\nUber, Pool and Beer\n\nOur plan is to find a nearby subway station to take us back toward the hotel. I locate one nearby and we head in that direction. But I have made a tactical error. As we arrive, I realize that the stop I located is a bus stop, not a subway stop. The nearest subway is quite a distance. The sun is blazing down, so we walk toward a hotel, find some shade on a side-street, and I call for an Uber, which arrives quickly and whisks us back to the hotel lobby. We are all glad to be done walking for the day.\n\nThere is a large pool on the resort and Kelly and the kids change so that they can cool off for a while. Near the pool is a bar, and I order a beer and sit watching the kids swim and listening to the constant sound of locusts filling the background. There is an ashtray on my table, reminding me that I am no longer in the U.S. The beer is refreshing after the day’s adventures.\n\nOur Tour Officially Begins\n\nAt 5pm, we gather in the lobby to meet our tour director, Lara, a tall woman with a delightful Australian accent. Lara hustles our group (there are 47 of us in total) to some tables out by the pool, where we can sit in the sun and provide flesh and blood to the nipping mosquitos and no-see-ems. Lara tells us she finished giving this tour to another group just 15 days ago, and it is her favorite tour to lead.\n\nUnlike our tour of Ireland, which was half-full and made up almost entirely of Americans, this tour is just about full, and there are people from all over the world: a few of us from the U.S., several people from different parts of Canada, people from the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Malaysia. I may be missing some, but that is all I have written down in my notes. It makes for a variety of accents. Even for those people within the U.S., I detect distinct accents from northern New England and New York.\n\nLara tells us, “We are here for a good time, but not a long time,” and this sounds to me like the wisdom of Marcus Aurelius. She outlines the tour, and answers a lot of questions before they are even asked. After about 30 minutes, we head en-mass to our bus, and meet our driver for the duration of the tour, Ferdinando, or “Ferdi” for short.\n\nOur bus is taking us to dinner by way of a driving tour through Rome. I learn that St. Peter’s Basilica is the place where Peter was crucified. The Castle Sant’Angelo that we visited earlier in the day was a fort for the Pope and there are tunnels that connect the castle to the Vatican. I learn that 90% of Italians live in apartments. I want to know more about this and jot down a few questions that I never come back to. We pass through the Borghese family estate, which makes up the largest green space in Rome, and we pass through or by several of the ancient aqueducts and parts of the old Roman wall that surrounded the city. I learn that the correct saying is “All roads lead out of Rome,” not “all roads lead to Rome.” I learn that Ancient Rome is one story below the Rome of the modern city. This is something of a relief, as it helps me understand why it was so difficult to see the ancient city within its modern counterpart earlier in the day.\n\nDinner, Opera, and the Colosseum\n\nWe have dinner at a restaurant called (I think) Le Terme del Colosseo. We enter as a group and then descend one story (into Ancient Rome?) where rows of tables await us. This is where we begin meeting the other people on the tour. Sitting across from us is a couple from Florida, formerly of New England, Ken and Pat. Ken reminds me vaguely of Norman Spinrad, although it may be his goatee. Also seated at our table are Kathryn, Taryne and Sandra from the Toronto area.\n\nFor dinner, the kids on the tour gather to make pizza, while the adults chat and get to know one another. From the room behind us comes the sounds of opera singing. There are two performers singing for another group, and we benefit from it.\n\nThe food is plentiful, as is the wine. Grace tries some white wine, but doesn’t like it. When dinner finally ends, we made our way, all 47 of us, plus Lara, up the narrow street to the Colosseum. We will be inside the Colosseum tomorrow. For now, we gather together for our first group photo, and then break up into small knots of families for photos of our own. Tired, and perhaps a little impatient after a long day of sightseeing, I snap a single, quick photo of the Colosseum that happens to catch it in the last light of sunset.\n\nWe all board our bus and make our way back to the hotel, passing Circus Maximum along the way, passing the Stone of Truth, passing the Temple of Hercules. Lara warns us that tomorrow will be the most hectic day of our tour, cramming in the Vatican as well as the Colosseum and lots of sightseeing into a single day. Today already seems cramming and I can barely recall how the day started out and everything that I have managed to see.\n\nDosing off, I think about Seneca’s quote and remind myself that our universe is, indeed, a sorry little affair unless it has something for every age to investigate. I’m glad that in this age, we have the opportunity to investigate the very past from which Seneca wrote his prophetic words.\n\nRead about day 4.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.
