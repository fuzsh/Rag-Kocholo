Bestselling author, inspirational speaker, occasional television presenter and founder of the global movement âWe are the ARKâ, a practical groundswell movement that finally shifts the environmental game in natureâs favour. The time for gardens as canvases for our creative pleasure is over. Everything must change and if we are to save the planet, then we must start with our own patches of it. Itâs time to re-imagine our work as gardeners, to become leaders in the race to save our beautiful planet, to save ourselves.\n\nEECP Seminar Series: Can Fashion be Sustainable?\n\nTuesday, March 19, 2024 at 5:30pm\n\nJackson Street Building, Room 125\n\n285 S Jackson Street, Athens, GA 30602\n\nSanni BaumgÃ¤rtner, owner of Community - a boutique for sustainable fashion and locally made products, opened in downtown Athens, Georgia in 2010.\n\nCome explore how fashion cycles have changed over time and what problems have come out of Fast Fashion (disconnect of producer and consumer, overconsumption, pollution, exploitation, waste). Then learn about ways that sustainable fashion has been trying to tackle the problems using the example of Community: Slow Fashion, a sustainable regional supply chain, circular fashion, resale, swaps, and mending, while also mentioning the challenges and limitations associated with this.\n\nCommunity's mission is to create and sell sustainable clothing and goods by utilizing vintage and eco-friendly materials for minimum impact on the environment. They strive to foster and develop a local fashion and makers community with a sustainable regional supply chain for maximum impact on the local economy.\n\nEECP Seminar Series: The Ethical Considerations of Permanent Land Protection\n\nTuesday, February 27, 2024 at 5:30pm\n\nWatch Here\n\nJackson Street Building, Room 125\n\n285 S Jackson Street, Athens, GA 30602\n\nChristine McCauley Watts, Executive Director of the Madison-Morgan Conservancy\n\nSteffney R.

It was a multi-use tree, providing strong, durable timber and a reliable nut crop consumed by people and wildlife. The chestnut blight fungus, accidentally introduced into the US in the late 1800s, eliminated chestnut as a canopy species in 50 years. While various approaches were tried to halt the spread of chestnut blight, and later, to restore the tree, current plans call for deployment of chestnuts engineered with a gene that prevents the fungus from killing the tree. It appears likely that chestnuts with this gene will be approved for release by the relevant federal regulatory agencies within the next few years.\n\nEECP Pop-Up Seminar: Finding Water Spider: Perpetuating an Enstoried Cherokee Ecology through Community-driven Research in 'Cherokee Earth Dwellers: Stories and Teachings of the Natural World'\n\nNo Recording Available\n\nMonday, October 16, 2023 at 3:30-4:30 pm\n\nJackson Street Building, Critique Space\n\n\"Finding Water Spider: Perpetuating an Enstoried Cherokee Ecology through Community-driven Research in 'Cherokee Earth Dwellers: Stories and Teachings of the Natural World'\"\n\nChristopher B. Teuton (Cherokee Nation), áá± ááá¢áá, Professor and Chair of the Department of American Indian Studies and Adjunct Professor Department of English, University of Washington\n\nAyetli gadogvâto \"stand in the middle\"âis at the heart of a Cherokee perspective of the natural world. From this stance, Cherokee Earth Dwellers offers a rich understanding of nature grounded in Cherokee creature names, oral traditional stories, and reflections of knowledge holders. During his lifetime, elder Hastings Shade created booklets with over six hundred Cherokee names for animals and plants. With this foundational collection at its center, and weaving together a chorus of voices, this book emerges from a deep and continuing collaboration between Christopher B. Teuton, Hastings Shade, Loretta Shade, and others.\n\nPositioning our responsibilities as humans to our more-than-human relatives, teachings about the body, mind, spirit, and wellness that have been shared for generations. From clouds to birds, oceans to quarks, this expansive Cherokee view of nature reveals a living, communicative world and humanity's role within it.\n\nCo-sponsored by the EECP and Jace Weaver, Franklin Professor of Religion and Native American Studies\n\nEECP Seminar Series: Sustainability in the Built Environment\n\nWatch Here\n\nTuesday, October 3, 2023 at 5:30pm\n\nJackson Street Building, Room 125\n\n285 S Jackson Street, Athens, GA 30602\n\nâSustainability in the Built Environmentâ\n\nJoe Rozza, Chief Sustainability Officer with Ryan Companies\n\nThis seminar will explore:\n\nGeneral state sustainability in the commercial real estate development and construction sector.\n\nDeveloping a compelling, organization-specific business case for sustainability.

From 1773 to 1777, a plant-collecting trip took Bartram from the Carolina coast west to the Mississippi. Far more than a botanical catalog, Bartramâs 1791 book Travels provides a captivating window into the past and continues to fire the imagination of readers over 200 years later.\n\nDespite the passage of time, Bartramâs words speak to current issues of critical importance. The film responds to an America hungry to reconnect with the natural world around us, an America increasingly focused on sustaining this planet we call home.\n\nOften called âthe Southâs Thoreau,â Bartramâs reverence for all aspects of nature lies at the heart of these modern environmental movements and in the people we meet in âCultivating the Wild.â\n\nSpring 2023\n\nFeb 7th : Doug Pardue, University of Georgia\n\nJackson Street Building rm 130 (Crit Space) 5:30pm 7:30pm\n\nTYPOLOGIES OF SPREAD: TRACKING JOROS\n\nTypologies of Spread is a conceptual model that describes the essential landscape conditions, relationships, and changes provoked by the arrival of the Joro spider, Trichonephila clavate, a controversial orb weaver that hitched a ride in a shipping container from Asia to the southeast US in 2014 (Hoebeke, Huffmaster, Freeman, 2015) and has been spreading exponentially ever since. The wide range of opinions toward the Joro, from embrace to execution, parallels designâs own discourse of evolution and expansionism, and allows probing and provoking of perspectives related to types and rates of change (Nash, 1989; Weilacher, 1999).\n\nWithin this context, the model takes on three goals: 1) measure and describe landscape conditions, changes, and relationships related to Joro; 2) foster cognitive empathy through reflection and sharing of deviating attitudes toward Joro; and 3) invite informed, imaginative discussion of potential changes to landscape design and practices. Methods used to address these include change maps to identify patterns and rate, typological cross sections to describe and compare conditions and change, and a question framework to relate perspectives. Resulting Typologies of Spread will be presented, with findings and lessons for modeling, cognitive empathy, and landscape metrics.\n\nFeb 28th : Panel Discussion\n\nVirtual Event - 5:30pm 7:30pm | Free\n\nYOUNG PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO THE CITY\n\nSummary: Contributors to The Routledge Handbook of Designing Public Spaces for Young People discuss why youth need to be involved in the design and planning of our cities.\n\nPanelists:\n\nAdina Cox, Iowa State University\n\nMariela Fernandez, Clemson University\n\nSarah Little, University of Oklahoma\n\nKatherine Melcher, University of Georgia\n\nJuan Torres, University of Montreal\n\nBook citation: The Routledge Handbook of Designing Public Spaces for Young People: Processes, Practices, and Policies for Youth Inclusion, edited by Janet Loebach, Sarah Little, Adina Cox, and Patsy Eubanks Owens.

This paper develops a pluralist environmental aesthetics by arguing against monism and in favor of engaging diverse resources, epistemologies, and ontologies to inform both theory and practice. I begin by noting existing theories which may be described as pluralist and critical, that is, they argue that a variety of grounds are reasonable for aesthetic judgments of mixed and natural environments, e.g., multisensory perception, imagination, emotion, various knowledge systems, place-based narratives, and the arts. The advantages and disadvantages of pluralism are discussed with reference to, respectively, the complexity and heterogeneity of appreciative situations and contexts and the differences between critical pluralism and relativism. Pluralism is then brought into the context of environmental problems which are trans-spatial, crossing the boundaries of regions, continents, ecologies, and earth systems. Given the trans-spatial and trans-temporal nature of climate change, I also show how the flexibility and richness of pluralism offers the advantage of drawing upon a range of global resources to articulate aesthetic meanings and values now and into the future, from the predictive models of climate science to imagination and fiction.\n\nEmily Brady is Professor of Philosophy at Texas A&M University. Her research and teaching interests span environmental and everyday aesthetics, environmental ethics, and eighteenth-century philosophy. She has authored or co-edited several books, including, Aesthetics of the Natural Environment (2003), The Sublime in Modern Philosophy: Aesthetics, Ethics, and Nature (2013), and Between Nature and Culture: The Aesthetics of Modified Environments (with Isis Brook and Jonathan Prior, 2018). Her current research project, âAesthetics in Planetary Perspective: Environmental Aesthetics for the Future,â develops a new agenda for aesthetics in response to urgent environmental problems, which she constructs through the conceptual frames of 'future aesthetics', 'intergenerational aesthetics', 'aesthetic humility', beauty, wonder, and the sublime.\n\nMore information found here\n\nFall 2022\n\nNOV 1:Forests as Fuel: Energy, Landscape Climate and Race in the U.S. South\n\nSarahHitchner, JohnSchelhas and J. Peter Brosius | JSB 125 | 5:30 - 7:30 pm\n\nIn the US South, wood-based bioenergy schemes are being promoted and implemented through a powerful vision merging social, environmental, and economic benefits for rural, forest-dependent communities. While this dominant narrative has led to heavy investment in experimental technologies and rural development, many complexities and complications have emerged during implementation.â¯This seminar, and the recently published book of the same nameâ¯draws on extensive multi-sited ethnography to ground the story of wood-based bioenergy in the biophysical, economic, political, social, and cultural landscape of this region.This careful and nuanced analysis that can provide guidance for promoting meaningful participation of local community members in renewable energy policy and production while recognizing the complex interplay of factors affecting its implementation in local places.\n\nSarah Hitchner is assistant research scientist and adjunct professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Georgia.\n\nJohn Schelhas is research forester with the Southern Research Station of the USDA Forest Service.\n\nJ. Peter Brosius is distinguished research professor of anthropology at the University of Georgia and founding director of the University of Georgia's Center for Integrative Conservation Research.\n\nSEPT 20: Dr. Dan Matisoff, Associate Professor in Public Policy, Georgia Tech\n\nGreen Market Transformation: Learning to LEED\n\nWith the imminent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, hopes have risen that the US has finally taken meaningful steps to address Climate Change. Recent research on Green Market Transformation suggests a number of policy levers that can help maximize the impact of federally allocated funding and accelerate the adoption of the technologies needed to address climate change. This talk explores how public and private sector forces have aligned to catalyze successful Green Market Transformation in the building industry, and how these successes can be leveraged for sustainability transitions.\n\nDaniel Matisoff is an associate professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the School of Public Policy where he founded and directs the Sustainable Energy and Environmental Management program, serves as a fellow with the Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems, and is on the advisory board of the Strategic Energy Institute. He has authored over 25 journal articles and the forthcoming book: Ecolabels, Innovation, and Green Market Transformation : Learning to LEED with Cambridge University Press. He has participated in over $5 million of sponsored research through the National Science Foundation, amongst other public and private sector sponsors. Recently Dr. Matisoff served as the lead author for the Buildings and Materials and Alternative Transportation solutions for Drawdown Georgia, a privately funded initiative to assess and implement techno-economic solutions to mitigate carbon emissions in Georgia. His degrees are in Public Policy from Indiana University and Economics and International Relations from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn his free time, he enjoys backpacking in the Georgia wilderness, brewing beer, running on roads and trails, and competing in ultimate frisbee against people much younger than himself.\n\nIf you would like to nominate yourself or someone else for a seminar talk, please contact Alfie Vick at ravick@uga.edu.

In this presentation I give my own perspective on this debate, following Ben Minteerâs claim that Leopold was importantly influenced by a neglected \"third way\" in US environmentalism that sits between preservation and conservation. This third way was importantly influenced by American pragmatist philosophy, and had policy impact between the 1920s and 1940s. Developing this, I suggest that significant influences on Leopold's work can be tracked from William Jamesâs philosophy, both directly and via secondary Jamesian sources. I thus support the thrust of Bryan Norton's recent reading of Leopold as a pragmatist, but from an angle that makes Leopold less managerialist, a closer part of the American philosophical tradition, and a more clearly an actor in the wider progressive democratic tradition.\n\nJennifer Ceska, Director of Conservation\n\nState Botanical Garden of Georgia\n\nThe Ethics of Rare Plant Conservation\n\nTuesday October 27th, 2020, 5:30-7pm\n\nDr. Stephen Berry\n\nGregory Professor of the Civil War Era\n\nCSI: Dixie â Investigating the Environmental and Social Justice of Death in the Nineteenth Century South\n\nTuesday November 10th, 2020, 5:30-7pm\n\nCoronersâ inquests are some of the richest records we have of life and death in the nineteenth century South. As mortals, we all die, but we do not die equally. Race, place, gender, profession, behavior, and good and bad luck play large roles in determining how we go out of the world. Collecting extant coroners' inquests for the state of South Carolina between 1800 and 1900, \"CSI: Dixie\" provides rare glimpses into Victorian-era suicide, homicide, infanticide, abortion, child abuse, spousal abuse, master-slave murder, and slave on slave violence.\n\nA project of the Center for Virtual History at the University of Georgia, CSI:D is delighted to thank the American Council of Learned Societies and the Willson Center for Humanities and Arts for their steadfast support.\n\nWarnell Seminar Speaker: Carolyn Finney\n\nDate: Thursday, October 15 at 3:30pm to 5:00pm\n\nCarolyn Finney, Ph.D., storyteller, scholar, and cultural geographer, focused on developing greater cultural competency and exploring the complex intersections of race and the environment.
