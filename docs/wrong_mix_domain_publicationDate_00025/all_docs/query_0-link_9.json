        "text": "Estimated reading time: 8 minutes\n\nHere you’ll find my candidates for the ten best among the more than three dozen techno-thrillers I’ve read and reviewed. Of course, you might ask what qualifies a novel to be called a techno-thriller. Definitions seem to vary. But mine is that it’s a story in which technology is at the root of great peril threatening human life. Biotech. AI. Neuroscience. Or high tech of any sort. But I add a further criterion to the definition. For me, a techno-thriller must be grounded in known science. It might represent far-future developments. But the technology portrayed must be credibly linked to the principles of physics and biology. Hard science fiction, in other words.\n\nI’ve grouped the titles below according to my rating. The top ten come first, followed by other books I awarded five stars but didn’t think rated inclusion in the very top category. Then come the other titles, first the four-star books, then the few I gave three stars. I haven’t included anything with a lower rating. Within each list the books appear in alphabetical order of the authors’ surnames.\n\nPlease note that I haven’t included more than one book from any author among the top seven titles, even if a sequel or some other work might have merited inclusion.\n\nThe best techno-thrillers\n\nMachinehood by S.
