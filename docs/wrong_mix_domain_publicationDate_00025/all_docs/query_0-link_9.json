        "text": "Estimated reading time: 8 minutes\n\nHere youâ€™ll find my candidates for the ten best among the more than three dozen techno-thrillers Iâ€™ve read and reviewed. Of course, you might ask what qualifies a novel to be called a techno-thriller. Definitions seem to vary. But mine is that itâ€™s a story in which technology is at the root of great peril threatening human life. Biotech. AI. Neuroscience. Or high tech of any sort. But I add a further criterion to the definition. For me, a techno-thriller must be grounded in known science. It might represent far-future developments. But the technology portrayed must be credibly linked to the principles of physics and biology. Hard science fiction, in other words.\n\nIâ€™ve grouped the titles below according to my rating. The top ten come first, followed by other books I awarded five stars but didnâ€™t think rated inclusion in the very top category. Then come the other titles, first the four-star books, then the few I gave three stars. I havenâ€™t included anything with a lower rating. Within each list the books appear in alphabetical order of the authorsâ€™ surnames.\n\nPlease note that I havenâ€™t included more than one book from any author among the top seven titles, even if a sequel or some other work might have merited inclusion.\n\nThe best techno-thrillers\n\nMachinehood by S.
