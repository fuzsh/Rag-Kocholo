        "text": "Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior: Evidence-based Lessons for Creating Sustainable Organizations 4th Edition by Steve M. Jex (Author), Thomas W. Britt (Author), Cynthia A Thompson (Author)(N. P. Loomba Department of Management)\n\nCall Number: HF5548.8 .J49 2024 (4th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9781119888802\n\nAn integrated perspective on organizational psychology and organizational behavior Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior is a major revision of the well-regarded textbook, whose previous title was Organizational Psychology: A Scientist-Practitioner Approach.

While Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations are a major part of American immigration enforcement, Felicia Arriaga maintains that ICE relies on an already well-established system--the use of local law enforcement and local governments to identify, incarcerate, and deport undocumented immigrants. Arriaga contends that the long-term partnership between local sheriffs and immigration law enforcement in places like North Carolina has created a form of racialized social control of the Latinx community. Arriaga uses data from five county sheriff's offices and their governing bodies to trace the creation and subsequent normalization of ICE and local law enforcement partnerships. Arriaga argues that the methods used by these partnerships to control immigration are employed throughout the United States, but they have been particularly visible in North Carolina, where the Latinx population increased by 111 percent between 2000 and 2010. Arriaga's evidence also reveals how Latinx communities are resisting and adapting to these systems.\n\nDelegated Diplomacy: How Ambassadors Establish Trust in International Relations by David Lindsey (Author) (Department of Political Science)\n\nCall Number: E183.7 .L553 2023 (3rd Floor)\n\nISBN: 9780231209328\n\nWhy do states still need diplomats? Despite instantaneous electronic communication and rapid global travel, the importance of ambassadors and embassies has in many ways grown since the middle of the nineteenth century. However, in theories of international relations, diplomats are often neglected in favor of states or leaders, or they are dismissed as old-fashioned. David Lindsey develops a new theory of diplomacy that illuminates why states find ambassadors indispensable to effective intergovernmental interaction. He argues that the primary diplomatic challenge countries face is not simply communication--it is credibility. Diplomats can often communicate credibly with their host countries even when their superiors cannot because diplomats spend time building the trust that is vital to cooperation. Using a combination of history, game theory, and statistical analysis, Lindsey explores the logic of delegating authority to diplomats. He argues that countries tend to appoint diplomats who are sympathetic to their host countries and share common interests with them. Ideal diplomats hold political preferences that fall in between those of their home country and their host country, and they are capable of balancing both sets of interests without embracing either point of view fully. Delegated Diplomacy is based on a comprehensive dataset of more than 1,300 diplomatic biographies drawn from declassified intelligence records, as well as detailed case studies of the U.S. ambassadors to the United Kingdom and Germany before and during World War I. It provides a rich and insightful account of the theory and practice of diplomacy in international relations.\n\nDorian Unbound: Transnational Decadence and the Wilde Archive by Sean O'Toole (Author) (English Department)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9781421446523\n\nA bold reimagining of the literary history of Decadence through a close examination of the transnational contexts of Oscar Wilde's classic novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. Building upon a large body of archival and critical work on Oscar Wilde's only novel, Dorian Unbound offers a new account of the importance of transnational contexts in the forging of Wilde's imagination and the wider genealogy of literary Decadence. Sean O'Toole argues that the attention critics have rightly paid to Wilde's backgrounds in Victorian Aestheticism and French Decadence has had the unintended effect of obscuring a much broader network of transnational contexts. Attention to these contexts allows us to reconsider how we read The Picture of Dorian Gray, what we believe we know about Wilde, and how we understand literary Decadence as both a persistent, highly mobile cultural mode and a precursor to global modernism. In developing a transnational framework for reading Dorian Gray, O'Toole recovers a subterranean network of nineteenth-century cultural movements. At the same time, he joins several active and vital conversations about what it might mean to expand the geographical reach of Victorian studies and to trace the globalization of literature over a longer period of time. Dorian Unbound includes chapters on the Irish Gothic, German historical romance, US magic-picture tradition, and experimental English epigrams, as well as a detailed history and a new close reading of the novel, in an effort to understand Wilde's contribution to a more dynamic idea of Decadence than has been previously known. From its rigorous account of the broad archive of texts that Wilde read and the array of cultural movements from which he drew inspiration in writing Dorian Gray to the novel's afterlives and global resonances, O'Toole paints a richer picture of the author and his famously allusive prose. This book makes a compelling case for a comparative reading of the novel in a global context. It will appeal to historians and admirers of Wilde's career as well as to scholars of nineteenth-century literature, queer and narrative theory, Irish studies, and art history.\n\nThe Environmental Unconscious: Ecological Poetics from Spenser to Milton by Steven Swarbrick (Author) (English Department)\n\nCall Number: PR 535 .M33 S94 2023 (5th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9781517913816\n\nBringing psychoanalysis to bear on the diagnosis of ecological crisis; Why has psychoanalysis long been kept at the margins of environmental criticism despite the many theories of eco-Marxism, queer ecology, and eco-deconstruction available today? What is unique, possibly even traumatic, about eco-psychoanalysis? The Environmental Unconscious addresses these questions as it provides an innovative and theoretical account of environmental loss focused on the counterintuitive forms of enjoyment that early modern poetry and psychoanalysis jointly theorize. Steven Swarbrick urges literary critics and environmental scholars fluent in the new materialism to rethink notions of entanglement, animacy, and consciousness raising. He introduces concepts from psychoanalysis as keys to understanding the force of early modern ecopoetics. Through close readings of Edmund Spenser, Walter Ralegh, Andrew Marvell, and John Milton, he reveals a world of matter that is not merely hyperconnected, as in the new materialism, but porous and off-kilter. And yet the loss these poets reveal is central to the enjoyment their works offer--and that nature offers. As insightful as it is engaging, The Environmental Unconscious offers a provocative challenge to ecocriticism that, under the current regime of fossil capitalism in which everything solid interconnects, a new theory of disconnection is desperately needed. Tracing the propulsive force of the environmental unconscious from the early modern period to Freudian and post-Freudian theories of desire, Swarbrick not only puts nature on the couch in this book but also renews the psychoanalytic toolkit in light of environmental collapse.\n\nLiquidity How to Find it, Regulate it, Get it by Robert A. Schwartz (Editor) (Bert Wasserman Dept Eco & Fin); John Aidan Byrne (Editor); Eileen Stempel (Editor)\n\nCall Number: HG 178 .L56 2023 (4th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9783031369131\n\nIn market structure, we tend to be equity focused, but one of the challenges is liquidity creation. This book examines liquidity creation and regulation. Based on the Baruch College Financial Markets Conference, Liquidity: How to Find it, Regulate it, Get it, this book examines the following questions: Where does liquidity come from? How should liquidity be supplied? What is needed when creating a new platform to provide an environment of liquidity? How do you prepare for liquidity provision concerning market investors, regulatory infrastructure, and technical infrastructure? How do you create liquidity in different asset classes? What is the role of the alternative trading system (ATS) structure within the exchange regulatory framework? What global trends are affecting liquidity creation? Also covered are the popularity of indexing, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Robo-advisers (Robos); how technology is transforming liquidity provision, mid and small-cap liquidity provision and new approaches to liquidity creation. An interview with Former Commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Michael S. Piwowar is also featured. The Zicklin School of Business Financial Markets Series presents the insights emerging from a sequence of conferences hosted by the Zicklin School at Baruch College for industry professionals, regulators, and scholars. Much more than historical documents, the transcripts from the conferences are edited for clarity, perspective and context; material and comments from subsequent interviews with the panellists and speakers are integrated for a complete thematic presentation. Each book is focused on a well delineated topic, but all deliver broader insights into the quality and efficiency of the U.S. equity markets and the dynamic forces changing them.\n\nStates of Confusion: How Our Voter ID Laws Fail Democracy and What to Do About It by Don Waisanen (Author) (Austin W.

In States of Confusion, Don Waisanen, Sonia Jarvis, and Nicole Gordon explore this crisis and the difficulties it has created for American voters, offering practical solutions for this increasingly important problem. Focusing on ten states with the strictest voter documentation requirements, the authors show how people face major barriers to exercising their fundamental democratic right to vote and are therefore slipping through the cracks of our electoral system. They explore voter experiences by drawing on hundreds of online surveys, audits of 150 election offices, community focus groups, and more. Waisanen, Jarvis, and Gordon call on policymakers to adopt uniform national voter identification standards that are simple, accessible, and cost-free. States of Confusion offers a comprehensive and up-to-date look at the voter ID crisis in our country, as well solutions for practitioners, government agencies, and citizens.\n\nTransforming American Science: Universities, the Government, and the Cold War by Jonathan Engel (Author) (Austin W. Marxe School of Public and International Affairs)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9781032427041\n\nTransforming American Science documents the ways in which federal funds catalyzed or accelerated changes in both university culture and the broader system of American higher education during the post-World War II decades. The events of the book lie within the context of the Cold War, when pressure to maintain parity with the Soviet Union impelled more generous government spending and a willingness of some universities to reorient their missions in the service of country and of science. The book draws upon a substantial amount of archival research conducted in various university archives (MIT, Berkeley, Stanford) as well as at the Library of Congress, the National Archives, and various presidential libraries. Author Jonathan Engel considers the repurposing of the wartime Manhattan Engineering District and the Office of Naval Research to robust peacetime roles in supporting the nation's expanding research efforts, along with the birth of the National Science Foundation, space exploration, and atoms for peace among other topics. This volume is the perfect resource for all those interested in Cold War history and in the history of American science and technology policy.\n\nWriting on the Wall: Writing Education and Resistance to Isolationism by David S. Martins (Editor); Brooke R. Schreiber (Editor) (English Department),~ Xiaoye You (Editor)\n\nCall Number: PE1404 .W7289 2023 (5th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9781646423231\n\nThe first concerted effort of writing studies scholars to interrogate isolationism in the United States, Writing on the Wall reveals how writing teachers--often working directly with students who are immigrants, undocumented, first-generation, international, and students of color--embody ideas that counter isolationism. The collection extends existing scholarship and research about the ways racist and colonial rhetorics impact writing education; the impact of translingual, transnational, and cosmopolitan ideologies on student learning and student writing; and the role international educational partnerships play in pushing back against isolationist ideologies. Established and early-career scholars who work in a broad range of institutional contexts highlight the historical connections among monolingualism, racism, and white nationalism and introduce community- and classroom-based practices that writing teachers use to resist isolationist beliefs and tendencies. \"Writing on the wall\" serves as a metaphor for the creative, direct action writing education can provide and invokes border spaces as sites of identity expression, belonging, and resistance. The book connects transnational writing education with the fight for racial justice in the US and around the world and will be of significance to secondary and postsecondary writing teachers and graduate students in English, linguistics, composition, and literacy studies.

McGlynn (Author) (English Department)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9780815637776\n\nWhile the national narrative coming out of Ireland since the 2008 economic crisis has been relentlessly sanguine, fiction has offered a more nuanced perspective from both well-established and emerging authors. In Broken Irelands, McGlynn examines Irish novels of the post-crash era, addressing the proliferation of writing that downplays realistic and grammatical coherence in works of fiction. Noting that these traits have the effect of diminishing human agency, blurring questions of responsibility, and emphasizing emotion over rationality, McGlynn argues that they are reflecting and responding to social and economic conditions during the global economic crisis and its aftermath of recession, austerity, and precarity. Rather than focusing on overt discussions of the crash and recession, McGlynn explores how the dominance of an economic worldview, including a pervasive climate of financialized discourse, shapes the way stories are told. In the writing of such authors as Anne Enright, Colum McCann, Mike McCormack, and Lisa McInerney, McGlynn unpacks the ways that formal departures from realism through grammatical asymmetries like unconventional verb tenses, novel syntactic choices, and reliance on sentence fragments align with a cultural moment shaped by feelings of impotence and rhetorics of personal responsibility.\n\nOn the Avenue of the Mystery The Postwar Counterculture in Novels and Film by Gary Hentzi (Author) (English Department)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9781032363417\n\nThis volume is a study of eight major novels from the postwar period (1945-65) in conjunction with the films made from them during a later period of a little less than three decades straddling the millennium (1985-2012). The comparison of these novels (by Ken Kesey, Paul Bowles, Carson McCullers, Jack Kerouac, James Baldwin, Alexander Trocchi, William Burroughs, and Peter Matthiessen) with their film adaptations offers the opportunity for a historical reassessment not only of the novels themselves but also of the global counterculture of the years 1965-75, which they prefigure in a variety of ways. Appearing more than a decade after the waning of the counterculture and in some cases as much as fifty years after the novels on which they are based, the films display significant revisions and omissions prompted by the historical and cultural changes of the intervening years. Whereas these changes are nowadays often interpreted in purely political terms, this book argues that the experience of mystery and its decline is central to the novels and films and is a key feature of the period of cultural transformation that they bookend. At once a work of literary criticism, film studies, and cultural history, this book has the potential to reach both an academic audience and the broader readership that has long existed for these novels as well as the even broader one interested in reappraising the period of the global counterculture--among the most important of the influences that have shaped the contemporary world.

Marxe School of Public and International Affairs)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9780820362281\n\nIn Liberal White Supremacy, Angie Beeman argues that white supremacy is maintained not only by right-wing conservatives or stereotypically uneducated working-class racial bigots but also by progressives who operate from a liberal ideology of color-blindness, racism-evasiveness, and class elitism. This distinction provides insight on divisions among progressives at the local level, in community organizations, and at the national level, in the Democratic Party. By distinguishing between liberal and radical approaches to racism, class oppression, capitalism, and social movement tactics, Beeman shows how progressives continue to be limited by liberal ideology and perpetuate rather than dismantle white supremacy, all while claiming to be antiracist. She conceptualizes this self-serving process as \"liberal white supremacy,\" the tendency for liberal European Americans to constantly place themselves in the superior moral position in a way that reinforces inequality. Beeman advances what she calls action-oriented and racism-centered intersectional approaches as alternatives to progressive organizational strategies that either downplay racism in favor of a class-centered approach or take a talk-centered approach to racism without developing explicit actions to challenge it.\n\nThe Silentiary by Antonio Di Benedetto (Author); Esther Allen (Translator) (Department of Modern Languages & Comparative Literature); Juan José Saer (Introduction by)\n\nCall Number: PQ 7797 .B4343 S513 2022 (5th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9781681375625\n\nIn post-WWII South America, a struggling writer embarks on a murderous thought experiment to help kickstart his career in this next tale of longing fromthe author of Zama. The Silentiary takes place in a nameless Latin American city during the early 1950s. A young man employed in middle management entertains an ambition to write a book of some sort. But first he must establish the necessary precondition, which the crowded and noisily industrialized city always denies him, however often he and his mother and wife move in search of it. He thinks of embarking on his writing career with something simple, a detective novel, and ponders the possibility of choos- ing a victim among the people he knows and planning a crime as if he himself were the killer. That way, he hopes, his book might finally begin to take shape. The Silentiary, along with Zama and The Suicides, is one of the three thematically linked novels by Di Benedetto that have come to be known as the Trilogy of Expectation, after the dedication \"To the victims of expectation\" in Zama. Together they constitute, in Juan Jose Saer's words, \"one of the culminating moments of twentieth-century narrative fiction in Spanish.\"\n\nBeyond Bitcoin Economics of Digital Currencies and Blockchain Technologies by Hanna Halaburda (Author); Miklos Sarvary (Author); Guillaume Haeringer (Author) (Bert Wasserman Dept Eco & Fin)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9783030889302\n\nOver the last few years, we have witnessed an upsurge of enthusiasm about cryptocurrencies and, more generally, the so-called blockchain technology. In this new and updated edition, the authors explore what exactly these new technologies entail and promise. They argue that to understand the potential challenges and further developments in the market, one needs to develop an understanding of what needs these innovations fulfill and what business models are consistent with their use. For that, we need to sufficiently understand both the technology and how it affects the economic forces at play. This book goes beyond the headlines that say \"blockchain will decentralize everything\" and provides in-depth, rigorous analysis of what can be effectively decentralized and how this decentralization will work. The book draws not only on the general knowledge of digital currencies and blockchain technologies, but also on recent academic research on the topic. Featuring a fully updated chapter on cryptocurrencies and new chapters on smart contracts and enterprise blockchains, this book is critical reading for those interested in how technology developments impact business and society.\n\nCreative Infrastructures: Artists, Money, and Entrepreneurial Action. by Linda Essig - Provost & Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs\n\nCall Number: NX180.S6 E85 2022 (4th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9781789385717\n\nEssays on the relationship between artists and entrepreneurship. As in sports, business, and other sectors, the top 1% of artists have disproportionately influenced public expectations for what it means to be successful. In Creative Infrastructures, Linda Essig takes an unconventional approach and looks at the quotidian artist--and at what they do, not what they make. All too often, artists who are attentive to the business side of their creative practice are accused of selling out. But for many working artists, that attention to business is what enables them not just to survive but to thrive. When artists follow their mission, Essig contends that they don't sell out, they spiral up by keeping mission at the forefront. Through illustrative case studies from culturally and racially diverse communities, Essig examines the relationships between art, innovation, entrepreneurship, and money while offering a theory for arts entrepreneurship that places more emphasis on means than ends.\n\nThe Rise of Illiberalism by Thomas J. Main (Author) (Marxe School of Public and International Affairs)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9780815738497\n\n\" How a more positive form of identity politics can restore public trust in government Illiberalism, Thomas Main writes, is the basic repudiation of liberal democracy, the very foundation on which the United States rests. Itsays no to electoral democracy, human rights, the rule of law, toleration. It is a political ideology that finds expression in such older right-wing extremist groups as the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacists and more recently among the Alt-Right and the Dark Enlightenment. There are also left-of-center illiberal movements, including various forms of communism, anarchism, and some antifascist movements. The Rise of Illiberalism explores the philosophical underpinnings of this toxic political ideology and documents how it has infiltrated the mainstream of political discourse in the United States. By the earlytwenty-first century, Main writes, liberal democracy's failure to deal adequately with social problems created a space illiberal movements could exploit to promote their particular brands of identity politics as an alternative. A critical need thus is for what the author calls \"positive identity politics,\" or a widely shared sense of community that gives a feelingof equal importance to all sectors of society. Achieving this goal will, however, be an enormous challenge. In seeking actionable remedies for the broken political system of the United States, this book makes a major scholarly contribution tocurrent debates about the future of liberal democracy. \"\n\nWhat is African literature the literature of? by Essono Tsimi (Author) (Department of Modern Languages & Comp Lit)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9782760644656\n\nDuring the 21st century, we have regularly insisted on the urgency of thinking about literature from Africa and the need to adapt the principles and methods of the critical exercise to the particularities of its literature – which, according to some, wouldn't even exist as such. Being subject to a dual social and cultural status and to multiple cultural affiliations, African literature of French expression nevertheless deserves a differentiated critical treatment which completes its possibilities of realization.\n\nWritten with erudition and elegance, this book offers a reflection on the scientific and social validity of a philosophy of rupture, essential to the development of a certain criticism. In addition, interviews with four writers answer questions that serve as milestones throughout the book: does African literature exist? What are its writers and their publishers worth? Where are its readers and audience? What do its critics say about it, the collections that welcome it, and the literary prizes it receives? What color are its agents and translators? What French is it written in?\n\nA First Course in Stochastic Calculus by Louis-Pierre Arguin (Author) (Mathematics Department)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9781470464882\n\nA First Course in Stochastic Calculus is a complete guide for advanced undergraduate students to take the next step in exploring probability theory and for master's students in mathematical finance who would like to build an intuitive and theoretical understanding of stochastic processes. This book is also an essential tool for finance professionals who wish to sharpen their knowledge and intuition about stochastic calculus. Louis-Pierre Arguin offers an exceptionally clear introduction to Brownian motion and to random processes governed by the principles of stochastic calculus. The beauty and power of the subject are made accessible to readers with a basic knowledge of probability, linear algebra, and multivariable calculus. This is achieved by emphasizing numerical experiments using elementary Python coding to build intuition and adhering to a rigorous geometric point of view on the space of random variables. This unique approach is used to elucidate the properties of Gaussian processes, martingales, and diffusions. One of the book's highlights is a detailed and self-contained account of stochastic calculus applications to option pricing in finance.\n\nEpigraphy, Iconography, and the Bible (Hebrew Bible Monographs) by Meir Lubetski (Editor) (Department of Modern Languages & Comp Lit); Edith Lubetski (Editor)\n\nCall Number: BS621 .E65 2022 (Reserves)\n\nISBN: 9781914490026\n\nThe study of the Bible has long been illuminated by 'light from the East' (in the famous phrase of Adolf Deissmann in 1908). Almost daily, new artifacts and inscriptions are announced that will have an impact on how the Bible is read and understood. Following Meir Lubetski's SPP collection New Seals and Inscriptions, Hebrew, Idumean and Cuneiform in 2007 and his Festschrift, Visions of Life in Biblical Times in 2015, the present volume garners papers from a wide and distinguished panel of specialists in the Ancient Near East that revisit former assumptions and present new insights on the relevance of its material culture to the Bible. Among the papers, Alan Millard reviews the issue of the use of the early alphabets, André Lemaire revisits the Mesha stele (the Moabite Stone), and Pieter Gert van der Veen takes a fresh look at the seal of Shema with its famous lion (still adorning the cover of the Journal for the Study of the Old Testament). Bezalel Porten contributes a fascinating study, illustrated by twenty colour diagrams, of documents on papyrus or ostraca requesting provisions from storerooms-an insight into the practicalities of daily administrative life in Egypt, Idumea and Israel. There are papers also on the arks of the Hebrew Bible (Yigal Levin), on alleged identifications of Hebrew kings in inscriptions (Lawrence Mykytiuk), on literary images in the Tell Fekheriye inscription and the book of Lamentations (Gideon Kotzé) and on Judaean pillar figurines of women that are ubiquitous in archaeological excavations from Iron Age Judah. Epigraphy, Iconography, and the Bible, in sum, is something of a cornucopia of new and revised data about the Hebrew Bible in its ancient context, intelligible to scholars, students and a more general public alike.\n\nCocaine: From Coca Fields to the Streets by Enrique Desmond Arias (Editor) (Austin W. Marxe School of Public and International Affairs); Thomas Grisaffi (Editor)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9781478013723\n\nThe contributors to Cocaine analyze the contemporary production, transit, and consumption of cocaine throughout the Americas and the illicit economy's entanglement with local communities. Based on in-depth interviews and archival research, these essays examine how government agents, acting both within and outside the law, and criminal actors seek to manage the flow of illicit drugs to both maintain order and earn profits. Whether discussing the moral economy of coca cultivation in Bolivia, criminal organizations and drug traffickers in Mexico, or the routes cocaine takes as it travels into and through Guatemala, the contributors demonstrate how entire ways of life are built around cocaine commodification. They consider how the authority of state actors is coupled with the self-regulating practices of drug producers, traffickers, and dealers, complicating notions of governance and of the relationships between economic and moral economies. The collection also outlines a more progressive drug policy that acknowledges the important role drugs play in the lives of those at the urban and rural margins. Contributors.

Socioanalysis of Pain in Gadda's Cognition Paperback – Nov. 11 2021 by Angelo R. Dicuon by Angelo R. Dicuonzo (Author) (Department of Modern Languages & Comp Lit)\n\nCall Number: PQ4841.D53 O8 2021 (5th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9788815294340\n\nGonzalo Pirobutirro, the unforgettable literate engineer protagonist of the Cognition of pain, has been identified by most with the author, Gadda himself. On the other hand, this book gives a different reading of the famous novel, which denies the centrality attributed to it so far to the autobiographical dimension. The alternative analysis that is proposed develops on two levels. On the one hand, it historicizes the text by placing it in the climate that produced it and thereby revealing the social nature of Gonzalo's malaise, an evil originating from the modernization implemented in the Giolitti age to the detriment of the petty bourgeoisie, above all intellectual. On the other hand, it shows how the narration demystifies the textual strategies of the bourgeois novel and subjects the character, intent on universalising his condition, to an ironic-humorous treatment. Gaddi's expressionism is thus subtracted from the vision that sees in it a completely exceptional literary phenomenon, resulting from the author's neurosis and stylistic virtuosity.\n\nThe Contest for Value in Global Value Chains: Correcting for Distorted Distribution in the Global Apparel Industry (New Horizons in International Business series) by Lilac Nachum (Author) (Allen Aaronson Dept of Mkt/IB), Yoshiteru Uramoto (Author)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9781800882140\n\nWho captures the value created in global supply chains? How should gaps in value capture among participants be amended and by whom? Focusing on the global apparel supply chain and employing value creation as a yardstick for evaluation of value capture, this book documents disturbing misalignments between value creation and value capture among global brands, manufacturers, labor, and consumers. The authors posit that the failure of both markets and governments to adequately distribute the value created by global value chains calls for different mechanisms to address this challenge. They develop a novel approach based on the logic of the interdependencies germane to the co-specialized nature of value chains. These interdependencies afford participants power to create markets for social justice in which behavior that drives outcomes towards adequate value distribution is economically and socially rewarded. These dynamics turn GVCs into their own de-facto 'regulators' with the power to self-correct for distributional distortions. The contributions of the book are at the center of current debates in policy milieu, academic circles and corporate boards regarding human rights, social inequality, and the role of the private sector in advancing social goals. They received renewed importance in contemporary discussions regarding the future of global value chains as the predominant mode of organizing value creation and the governance challenges they raise in a complex global world.\n\nThe Biomedical Empire: Lessons Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic by Barbara Katz Rothman (Author) (Department of Sociology and Anthropology)\n\nCall Number: RA 418 .R685 2021 (5th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9781503628816\n\nWe are all citizens of the Biomedical Empire, though few of us know it, and even fewer understand the extent of its power. In this book, Barbara Katz Rothman clarifies that critiques of biopower and the \"medical industrial complex\" have not gone far enough, and asserts that the medical industry is nothing short of an imperial power. Factors as fundamental as one's citizenship and sex identity--drivers of our access to basic goods and services--rely on approval and legitimation by biomedicine. Moreover, a vast and powerful global market has risen up around the empire, making it one of the largest economic forces in the world. Katz Rothman shows that biomedicine has the key elements of an imperial power: economic leverage, the faith of its citizens, and governmental rule. She investigates the Western colonial underpinnings of the empire and its rapid intrusion into everyday life, focusing on the realms of birth and death. This provides her with a powerful vantage point from which to critically examine the current moment, when the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the power structures of the empire in unprecedented ways while sparking the most visible resistance it has ever seen.\n\nPolitical Epistemology (Mind Association Occasional Series) by Elizabeth Edenberg (Editor) (Philosophy Department); Michael Hannon (Editor)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9780192893338\n\nThis collection explores one of the most rapidly growing area of philosophy: political epistemology. Epistemological issues are at the center of our political lives. It has become increasingly difficult to discern legitimate sources of evidence, misinformation spreads faster than ever, and the role of truth in politics has allegedly decayed in recent years. It is therefore no coincidence that political discourse is currently saturated with epistemic notions like \"post-truth,\" \"fake news,\" \"truth decay,\" \"echo chambers,\" and \"alternative facts.\" Political Epistemology brings together leading philosophers to explore ways in which the analytic and conceptual tools of epistemology bear on political philosophy, and vice versa. It is organized around three broad themes: truth and knowledge in politics; epistemic problems for democracy; and disagreement and polarization. The contributors provide new and rich insights on topics such as: propaganda, fake news, weaponized skepticism, belief polarization, political disagreement, the epistemic value of democracy, voter ignorance, irrationality in politics, and identity politics. A premise underlying the development of political epistemology is that progress on certain foundational issues in both political philosophy and epistemology cannot be achieved without sharing insights across fields, beyond a certain point. This will be a foundational text for philosophers, political scientists, and political psychologists for years to come.\n\nPregnancy and Birth by Keisha L. Goode (Author); Barbara Katz Rothman (Author) (Department of Sociology and Anthropology)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9781440869211\n\nPregnancy and Birth: A Reference Handbook provides students with information too often ignored in sex education--on what pregnancy and birth are, have been, and can be as transformative personal and social events. Pregnancy and Birth: A Reference Handbook is a woman-centered reference book on pregnancy and childbirth in the United States. The medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth is a theme; however, primary emphasis is on the historical and contemporary significance of alternatives to medicalization provided by the Midwifery Model of Care and how that can improve outcomes for all, but especially underserved women. The volume opens with a background and history of the topic, followed by a chapter on related problems, controversies, and solutions. A Perspectives chapter contains essays from a variety of individuals who are invested in the topic of pregnancy and birth. The remaining chapters provide students with additional information, such as profiles, data and documents, resources, a chronology, and a glossary. This book is accessible to high school and college-level researchers, as well as general-interest readers curious about the topic. Introduces readers to a perspective on U.S. pregnancy and childbirth that is woman-centered Centers the historical and contemporary significance of midwives and the Midwives Model of Care Illuminates the strength of U.S obstetric dominance by reporting legislative and policy barriers limiting women's access to midwifery care Highlights both the racial-ethnic disparities across the birth provider workforce and racial-ethnic disparities in U.S. birth outcomes Highlights regional disparities, with specific attention to rural communities, in U.S. birth outcomes.\n\nCuba’s Digital Revolution: Citizen Innovation and State Policy (Reframing Media, Technology, and Culture in Latin/o America) 1st Edition by Ted A. Henken (Editor) (Black and Latino Studies & Sociology and Anthropology Departments); Sara Garcia Santamaria (Editor)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9781683402022\n\nThe triumph of the Cuban Revolution gave the Communist Party a monopoly over both politics and the mass media. However, with the subsequent global proliferation of new information and communication technologies, Cuban citizens have become active participants in the worldwide digital revolution. While the Cuban internet has long been characterized by censorship, high costs, slow speeds, and limited access, this volume argues that since 2013, technological developments have allowed for a fundamental reconfiguration of the cultural, economic, social, and political spheres of the Revolutionary project. The essays in this volume cover various transformations within this new digital revolution, examining both government-enabled paid public web access as well as creative workarounds that Cubans have designed to independently produce, distribute, and access digital content. Contributors trace how media ventures, entrepreneurship, online marketing, journalism, and cultural e-zines have been developing on the island alongside global technological and geopolitical changes. As Cuba continues to expand internet access and as citizens challenge state policies on the speed, breadth, and freedom of that access, Cuba's Digital Revolution provides a fascinating example of the impact of technology in authoritarian states and transitional democracies. While the streets of Cuba may still belong to Castro's Revolution, this volume argues, it is still unclear to whom Cuban cyberspace belongs.\n\nWar and the Arc of Human Experience by Petersen, Glenn (Sociology and Anthropology Department)\n\nCall Number: DS 559.5 .P438 2021 (3rd Floor)\n\nISBN: 9780761872351\n\nGlenn Petersen flew seventy combat missions in Vietnam when he was nineteen, launching from an aircraft carrier in the Tonkin Gulf. He'd sought out the weighty responsibilities and hazardous work. But why? What did the cultural architecture of the society he grew up in have to do with the way he went to war? In this book he looks at the war from an anthropological perspective because that's how he's made his living in all the subsequent years: it's how he sees the world. While anthropologists write about the military and war these days, they do so from the perspective of researchers. What makes this a fully original contribution is that Petersen brings to the page the classic methodology of ethnographers, participant observation--a kind of total immersion. He writes from the dual perspectives of an insider and a researcher and seeks in the specifics of lived experience some larger conclusions about humans' social lives in general. Petersen was long oblivious to what had happened to him in Vietnam and he fears that young men and women who've been fighting the US military's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq might be similarly unaware of what's happened to them. Skills that allowed him to survive in combat, in particular his ability to focus tightly on the challenges directly in front of him, seemed to transfer well to life after war. The same intensity led him to a successful academic career, including the time he represented the Micronesian islands at the United Nations; how could anything be wrong? Then surreptitiously, the danger, the stress, and the trauma he'd hidden away broke through a brittle shell and the war came spilling out. As an anthropologist he sees in this a classic pattern: an adaptation to one set of conditions is put to a new and practical use when conditions change, but in time what had once been beneficial turns into maladaptive behavior. In writing about why we fight, he shed lights on what the fighting does to us.\n\nThe Awakening and Selected Stories (Warbler Classics) by Kate Chopin (Author); Rafael Walker (Editor) (English Department)\n\nCall Number: PS1294.C63 A6 2021 (5th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9781954525368\n\nKate Chopin's absorbing 1899 novel The Awakening tells the story of Edna Pontellier, a married woman in New Orleans who, during a summer holiday, begins to question her conventional life. In this path-breaking novel, Chopin speculates more daringly than any before her about the consequences for middle-class women of late-nineteenth-century society's unleashing of female desire. Celebrated today as a key text in American literature, it scandalized early critics and, precisely because of its boldness, jeopardized Chopin's career. In this annotated, modernized edition-specially tailored for for twenty-first-century readers-Rafael Walker highlights Chopin's awareness of the privileged class's exploitation of the the less-privileged, and includes a number of neglected stories that foreground Chopin's feminist proclivities.\"Offers readers her most intriguing stories along with her masterwork The Awakening. Filled with rich insights, Rafael Walker's splendid introduction?...distills Chopin's lasting literary achievement.\"--Nancy Bentley, author of Frantic Panoramas: American Literature and Mass Culture 1870-1920\"Rafael Walker's insightful introduction brings forward the complexities of The Awakening's portrayal of a turn-of-the-century woman's striving toward freedom, and the inclusion of some fascinating lesser-known stories provides a rich sense of the breadth of Chopin's achievement.\"--Jennifer Fleissner, author of Women, Compulsion, Modernity: The Moment of American Naturalism\n\nThe Believer Alien Encounters, Hard Science, and the Passion of John Mack by Ralph Blumenthal (Author) (Library)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9780826362315\n\nThe Believer is the weird and chilling true story of Dr. John Mack. This eminent Harvard psychiatrist and Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer risked his career to investigate the phenomenon of human encounters with aliens and to give credibility to the stupefying tales shared by people who were utterly convinced they had happened. Nothing in Mack's four decades of psychiatry had prepared him for the otherworldly accounts of a cross section of humanity including young children who reported being taken against their wills by alien beings. Over the course of his career his interest in alien abduction grew from curiosity to wonder, ultimately developing into a limitless, unwavering passion. Based on exclusive access to Mack's archives, journals, and psychiatric notes and interviews with his family and closest associates, The Believer reveals the life and work of a man who explored the deepest of scientific conundrums and further leads us to the hidden dimensions and alternate realities that captivated Mack until the end of his life.\n\nUprising How Women Used the US West to Win the Right to Vote Rhetoric & Public Affairs by Tiffany Lewis (Author) (Austin W. Marxe School of Public and International Affairs)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9781611863826\n\nDecades before white women won the right to vote throughout the United States, they first secured that right in its Western region--beginning in Wyoming in 1869. Many scholars have studied why and how the Western states enfranchised women before the Eastern ones; this book instead examines the influence of the West on the national US suffrage movement. As the campaign for woman suffrage intensified, US suffragists often invoked the West in their verbal, visual, and embodied advocacy. In deploying this region as a persuasive resource, they challenged the traditional meanings of the West and East, thus gaining additional persuasive strategies. Tiffany Lewis's analysis of the public discourse, images, and performances of suffragists and their opponents shows that the West played a pivotal role in the successful campaign for white women's enfranchisement that culminated in 1920. In addition to offering a history of this political movement's rhetorical strategy, Lewis illustrates the usefulness of region in protest--the way social movements can tactically employ region to motivate social change.\n\nFictions of Credit in the Age of Shakespeare by Laura Kolb (Author)(English Department)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9780198859697\n\nIn Shakespeare's England, credit was synonymous with reputation, and reputation developed in the interplay of language, conduct, and social interpretation. As a consequence, artful language and social hermeneutics became practical, profitable skills. Since most people both used credit andextended it, the dual strategies of implication and inference - of producing and reading evidence - were everywhere. Like poetry or drama, credit was constructed: fashioned out of the interplay of artifice and interpretation. The rhetorical dimension of economic relations produced social fictions ona range of scales: from transitory performances facilitating local transactions to the long-term project of maintaining creditworthiness to the generalized social indeterminacy that arose from the interplay of performance and interpretation.Fictions of Credit in the Age of Shakespeare examines how Shakespeare and his contemporaries represented credit-driven artifice and interpretation on the early modern stage. It also analyses a range of practical texts - including commercial arithmetics, letter-writing manuals, legal formularies, andtables of interest - which offered strategies for generating credit and managing debt. Looking at plays and practical texts together, Fictions of Credit argues that both types of writing constitute \"equipment for living\": practical texts by offering concrete strategies for navigating England'sculture of credit, and plays by exploring the limits of credit's dangers and possibilities. In their representations of a world re-written by debt relations, dramatic texts in particular articulate a phenomenology of economic life, telling us what it feels like to live in credit culture: to live,that is, inside a fiction.\n\nOn Our Own Strength: The Self-Reliant Literary Group and Cosmopolitan Nationalism in Late Colonial Vietnam by Martina Thucnhi Nguyen (Author) (History Department)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9780824883331\n\nOn Our Own Strength examines the political activities of the most influential intellectual movement in interwar French-occupied Vietnam. The far-reaching work of the Self-Reliant Literary Group included applied design, urban reform, fashion, literature, journalism, and cartoons; its work was deeply political in both form and intent. The Group drew upon a wide range of global intellectual currents and practices to build an enlightened public that would one day serve as the basis of a modern Vietnamese nation. Its nationalist vision sought a nonviolent middle path between colonialism and anticolonial struggle, advocating a process of gradual decolonization that ultimately ended in Vietnamese autonomy. This form of cosmopolitan nationalism proved tremendously popular among ordinary Vietnamese and necessarily shaped local politics, influencing the political agenda of even rival groups such as the newly revived Indochinese Communist Party (ICP). On Our Own Strength shows how the Group's vision framed the ways ICP positioned itself and sought popular support in the years leading up to the August Revolution and beyond. In later years, the party attempted to erase the Group's early influence on national politics, banning their writings and casting them as little more than bourgeois literary figures. In recovering the Group's unique response to the world around them, this book bridges the areas of political, cultural, and intellectual history, drawing them together into a rich narrative of Vietnamese nation-building from the bottom-up within a larger global context​. On Our Own Strength offers a dynamic model for the field of Vietnamese studies as it continues to move beyond Cold War political narratives of its most tumultuous period. This book engages broadly with global history, European history, and imperial studies to explore colonialism's hybrid cultural and political forms. Martina Thucnhi Nguyen examines how the Self-Reliant Literary Group weighed in on everything from women's fashion and public housing to the major political ideologies of their era, in a unique style that mixed French-inflected ideas with Vietnamese norms and forms. As a deep case study of important figures on the Vietnamese moderate left, On Our Own Strength provides an injection of color and nuance into a history that is often too monochromatic.\n\nArchaeologies of Empire: Local Participants and Imperial Trajectories (School for Advanced Research Advanced Seminar Series) by Anna L. Boozer (Editor) (Department of History); Bleda S. Düring (Editor); Bradley J. Parker (Editor)\n\nCall Number: JC359 .A63 2020 (4th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9780826361752\n\nThroughout history, a large portion of the world's population has lived under imperial rule. Although scholars do not always agree on when and where the roots of imperialism lie, most would agree that imperial configurations have affected human history so profoundly that the legacy of ancient empires continues to structure the modern world in many ways. Empires are best described as heterogeneous and dynamic patchworks of imperial configurations in which imperial power was the outcome of the complex interaction between evolving colonial structures and various types of agents in highly contingent relationships. The goal of this volume is to harness the work of the \"next generation\" of empire scholars in order to foster new theoretical and methodological perspectives that are of relevance within and beyond archaeology and to foreground empires as a cross-cultural category. This book demonstrates how archaeological research can contribute to our conceptualization of empires across disciplinary boundaries.\n\nReal Money, Real Power?: The Challenges with Participatory Budgeting in New York City by Daniel Williams (Author) (Austin W. Marxe School of Public and International Affairs); Don Waisanen (Author) (Austin W. Marxe School of Public and International Affairs)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9783030592004\n\nNew York City has the largest council-sponsored Participatory Budgeting (PB) processes in North America. From its inception in Brazil, PB was a process that empowered the least-advantaged members of the community by providing a way to propose budget allocations through voting. This book reports on a multi-methodological study of New York City's participatory budgeting (PB) process from the perspective of a city resident over time. A participatory budgeting slogan purports that the initiative offers \"real power\" and \"real money\" to constituents at a local level. To critically examine such top-down assertions, and different than much that has been written about PB, this book researches and navigates its events the way a member of the community would see it. The study reveals a lack of transparency, manipulation by city agencies, the favorable treatment of insider proposed projects, and a failure to reveal the basis of project costs. It also finds that there is no singular participatory budgeting project in New York City. Instead, there are numerous participatory budget projects, as many as there are council members who engage in the practice. This book provides a ground-level view of these limitations and recommends substantial reform.\n\nThe Marble Bed by Grace Schulman (Author) (English Department)\n\nCall Number: PS3569.C538 M37 2020 (5th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9781885983831\n\nGrace Schulman rises to new heights in these poems of lament and praise. In The Marble Bed, a couple dances on a shore that is at once a shining turf and a graveyard of sea toss, of cracked shells, a skull-like carapace, and emerald weed. Here things sparkle with newness: an orchid come alive when rescued from a trash bin; the new year hidden in an egret's wing; Coltrane's ecstatic flight; a seductive, come-hither angel; a meteor's arc; a rainbow's painted ribbons; a glacial rock that glowers in moonlight. Even the tomb sculptures in an Italian cemetery sparkle with vitality. Schulman, grieving for her late husband, believes passionately in the power of art to redeem human transience. Her faith in art enables her to move from mourning to joyful wonder of existence as she meditates on an injured world and concludes: \"Because I cannot lose the injured world / without losing the world, / I'll have to praise it.\"\n\nInstitutional Failure in Higher Education: Why some colleges and universities fail and what we can do to prevent it by Dr. Aldemaro Romero Jr. (Author) (Weissman School of Arts and Sciences), Dr. John M. Pratte (Author)\n\nCall Number: NA\n\nISBN: 9798695207026\n\nHigher education has faced a great number of challenges in the last few years that include, but are not limited to, financial woes, bad press, ethnic and gender conflicts, legal conflicts, student debt, demographic tests, technological transformations, and leadership fiascoes. Although other books have dealt with some of these issues, ours takes a longer view of the problems and contextualizes them into what we call “institutional failures.” Our basic premise is that there is a widespread dysfunction at both leadership and management levels in higher education. Despite all these challenges, most of these institutions have been able to survive because they have been isolated from society as a whole; yet, this same insularity has induced bad habits and carry on behaviors that are threatening their very existence. We illustrate these failures by using either well publicized cases and others we have had access to confidentially while providing solutions to those problems.\n\nBetween Power and Irrelevance: The Future of Transnational NGOs by George E. Mitchell (Author) (Marxe School of Public and International Affairs); Hans Peter Schmitz (Author); Tosca Bruno-van Vijfeijken (Author)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9780190084721\n\nGeopolitical shifts, increasing demands for accountability, and growing competition have been driving the need for change within transnational nongovernmental organizations (TNGOs). As the world has changed and TNGOs' ambitions have expanded, the roles of TNGOs have shifted and their work has become more complex. To remain effective, legitimate, and relevant in the future necessitates organizational changes, but many TNGOs have been slow to adapt. As a result, the sector's rhetoric of sustainable impact and social transformation has far outpaced the reality of TNGOs' more limited abilities to deliver on their promises. Between Power and Irrelevance openly explores why this gap between rhetoric and reality exists and what TNGOs can do individually and collectively to close it. George E. Mitchell, Hans Peter Schmitz, and Tosca Bruno-van Vijfeijken argue that TNGOs need to change the fundamental conditions under which they operate by bringing their own \"forms and norms\" into better alignment with their ambitions and strategies. This book offers accessible, future-oriented analyses and lessons-learned to assist practitioners and other stakeholders in formulating and implementing organizational changes. Drawing upon a variety of perspectives, including hundreds of interviews with TNGO leaders, firsthand involvement in major organizational change processes in leading TNGOs, and numerous workshops, training institutes, consultancies, and research projects, the book examines how to adapt TNGOs for the future.\n\nA Concise American History by David Brown (Author), Thomas Heinrich (Author) (History Department),Simon Middleton (Author), Vivien Miller (Author)\n\nCall Number: E 178.2 .B83 2021 (3rd Floor)\n\nISBN: 9780415677165\n\nExpertly steering readers through the often tumultuous and exhilarating history of the United States, from its early modern Native American roots to twenty-first century neoliberalism and the shifting political climate of the past decade, this highly readable textbook provides a compelling overview of American development over the last five centuries.

Kurtzberg (Author); Mary C. Kern (Author) (Narendra Paul Loomba Department of Management)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9781440868108\n\nWhy do parents who pull off multi-million dollar deals at work struggle to negotiate with their kids at home? This book provides insights and solutions from the scientific literature in organizational behavior, decision-making, psychology, and negotiations. People often don't bring their best professional skills to conversations with their kids. Sometimes they are derailed by their kids' emotional tactics and lack of rationality, and sometimes they are simply overwhelmed and exhausted by their own demanding lives. In Negotiating at Home, Terri R. Kurtzberg and Mary C. Kern offer guidance to parents, based on research conducted over decades in related fields on how to negotiate effectively. The authors argue that effective negotiations are not merely the task of creating a single solution to an immediate problem, but instead are about creating a process by which the interests of both sides are routinely considered and solutions are generated together. Kurtzberg and Kern cover individual preferences and strategic approaches to resolving conflicts, the many psychological concepts of fairness, and the common tactics used to attain power in this setting. Combines explanations of effective negotiation strategies with specific tips for implementing them in interactions with your kids offers reminders for and deeper explanations of commonly held ideas while also presenting new studies and findings from related fields. It shares real stories and examples throughout to demonstrate the common \"pain points\" experienced by parents and Includes a guide for kids to learn the basic rules of effective negotiating for use in their own lives.\n\nApt Imaginings by Jonathan Gilmore (Author) (Department of Philosophy)\n\nCall Number: BF411.G55 2020 (3rd Floor)\n\nISBN: 9780190096342\n\nHow do our engagements with fictions and other products of the imagination compare to our experiences of the real world? Are the feelings we have about a novel's characters modelled on our thoughts about actual people? If it is wrong to feel pleasure over certain situations in real life, can it nonetheless be right to take pleasure in analogous scenarios represented in a fantasy or film? Should the desires we have for what goes on in a make-believe story cohere with what we want to happen in the actual world? Such queries have animated philosophical and psychological theorizing about art and life from Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Poetics to contemporary debates over freedom of expression, ethics and aesthetics, the cognitive value of thought experiments, and the effects on audiences of exposure to violent entertainment. In Apt Imaginings, Jonathan Gilmore develops a new framework to pursue these questions, marshalling a wide range of research in aesthetics, the science of the emotions, moral philosophy, neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and film and literary theory. Gilmore argues that, while there is a substantial empirical continuity in our feelings across art and life, the norms that govern the appropriateness of those responses across the divide are discontinuous. In this view, the evaluative criteria that determine the fit, correctness, or rationality of our emotions and desires for what is internal to a fiction can be contrary to those that govern our affective attitudes toward analogous things in the real world. In short, it can be right to embrace within a story what one would condemn in real life. The theory Gilmore defends in this volume helps to explain our complex and sometimes conflicted attitudes toward works of the imagination; challenges the popular view that fictions serve to refine our moral sensibilities; and exposes a kind of autonomy of the imagination that can render our responses to art immune to standard real-world epistemic, practical, and effective kinds of criticism.\n\nMood and Trope by John Brenkman (Author) (English Department)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9780226673264\n\nIn Mood and Trope, John Brenkman introduces two provocative propositions to affect theory: that human emotion is intimately connected to persuasion and figurative language; and that literature, especially poetry, lends precision to studying affect because it resides there not in speaking about feelings, but in the way of speaking itself. Engaging a quartet of modern philosophers,--Kant, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Deleuze,-- Brenkman explores how they all approach the question of affect primarily through literature and art. He draws on the differences and dialogues among them, arguing that the vocation of criticism is incapable of systematicity and instead must be attuned to the singularity and plurality of literary and artistic creations. In addition, he confronts these four philosophers and their essential concepts with a wide array of authors and artists, including Pinter and Poe, Baudelaire, Jorie Graham and Li-Young Lee, Shakespeare, Tino Sehgal, and Francis Bacon. Filled with surprising insights, Mood and Trope provides a rich archive for rethinking the nature of affect and its aesthetic and rhetorical stakes.\n\nBiotheory: Life and Death under Capitalism by Jeffrey R. Di Leo (Editor); Peter Hitchcock (Editor) (English Department)\n\nCall Number: JA80 .B56 2020 (4th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9780367416119\n\nForged at the intersection of intense interest in the pertinence and uses of biopolitics and biopower, this volume analyzes theoretical and practical paradigms for understanding and challenging the socioeconomic determinations of life and death in contemporary capitalism. Its contributors offer a series of trenchant interdisciplinary critiques, each one taking on both the specific dimensions of biopolitics and the deeper genealogies of cultural logic and structure that crucially inform its impress. New ways to think about biopolitics as an explanatory model are offered, and the subject of bioslife (ways of life) itself, is taken into innovative theoretical possibilities. On the one hand, biopolitics is addressed in terms of its contributions to forms and divisions of knowledge; on the other, its capacity for reformulation is assessed before the most pressing concerns of contemporary living. It is a must read for anyone concerned with the study of bios in its theoretical profusions.\n\nSpazi neofantastici. Racconti di Primo Levi by Franco Zangrilli - Department of Modern Languages and Comparative Literature\n\nCall Number: PQ4872.E8 Z996 2020 (5th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9788861561632\n\nLevi's stories are inspired by a tangle of motifs, arguments, and events from our existence, such as micro and macro history. They present a vast material taken from the most disparate forms of the fantastic: they approach, graft, and mix a wealth of mythologies, civilizations, and traditions of the most distant and most diverse cultures. Then we learn that realism is the fantasy of life. The bright tones of humor collaborate in the development of several story functions; they support the playful course of the backhand; they emphasize deep concerns and anxieties, such as the tragic feeling of life; they reinforce the satire of irrational activities of man, including how he uses and abuses both science and science fiction ... Zangrilli's essay reevaluates the enormous neo-fantastic geography of Levi's stories, which contemporary criticism has often overlooked, as the most modern and significant aspect of his work as a writer.\n\nThe Young Lords: A Radical History by Johanna Fernández (Author) (History Department)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9781469653440\n\nAgainst the backdrop of America's escalating urban rebellions in the 1960s, an unexpected cohort of New York radicals unleashed a series of urban guerrilla actions against the city's racist policies and contempt for the poor. Their dramatic flair, uncompromising socialist vision for a new society, skillful ability to link local problems to international crises, and uncompromising vision for a new society riveted the media, alarmed New York's political class, and challenged nationwide perceptions of civil rights and black power protest. The group called itself the Young Lords. Utilizing oral histories, archival records, and an enormous cache of police surveillance files released only after a decade-long Freedom of Information Law request and subsequent court battle, Johanna Fernandez has written the definitive account of the Young Lords, from their roots as a Chicago street gang to their rise and fall as a political organization in New York. Led by poor and working-class Puerto Rican youth, and consciously fashioned after the Black Panther Party, the Young Lords occupied a hospital, blocked traffic with uncollected garbage, took over a church, tested children for lead poisoning, defended prisoners, fought the military police, and fed breakfast to poor children. Their imaginative, irreverent protests and media conscious tactics won reforms, popularized socialism in the United States and exposed U.S. mainland audiences to the country's quiet imperial project in Puerto Rico. Fernandez challenges what we think we know about the sixties. She shows that movement organizers were concerned with finding solutions to problems as pedestrian as garbage collection and the removal of lead paint from tenement walls; gentrification; lack of access to medical care; childcare for working mothers; and the warehousing of people who could not be employed in deindustrialized cities. The Young Lords' politics and preoccupations, especially those concerning the rise of permanent unemployment foretold the end of the American Dream. In riveting style, Fernandez demonstrates how the Young Lords redefined the character of protest, the color of politics, and the cadence of popular urban culture in the age of great dreams.\n\nImmunity's Sovereignty and Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century American Literature by Rick Rodriguez (Author) (English Department)\n\nCall Number: PS121 .R63 2019 (5th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9783030340124\n\n“Immunity's Sovereignty and Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century American Literature” tracks flashpoint events in U.S. history, constituting a genealogy of the effectiveness and resilience of the concept of immunity in democratic culture. Rick Rodriguez argues that following the American Revolution the former colonies found themselves subject to foreign and domestic threats imperiling their independence. Wars with North African regencies, responses to the Haitian revolution, reactions to the specter and reality of slave rebellion in the antebellum South, and plans to acquire Cuba to ease tensions between the states all constituted immunizing responses that helped define the conceptual and aesthetic protocols by which the U.S. represented itself to itself and to the world's nations as distinct, exemplary, and vulnerable. Rodriguez examines these events as expressions of an immunity logic that was, and still is, frequently deployed to legitimate state authority. Rodriguez identifies contradictions in literary texts' dramatizations of these transnational events and their attending threats, revealing how democracy's exposure to its own fragility serves as rationale for immunity's sovereignty. This book shows how early U.S. literature, often conceived as a delivery system for American exceptionalism, is in effect critical of such immunity discourses.\n\nExploring the U.S. Census: Your Guide to America’s Data by Francis P. Donnelly - Newman Library\n\nCall Number: HA181 .D66 2019 (4th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9781544355429\n\nThe United States census provides researchers, students, and the public with some of the richest and broadest information available about the American people. Exploring the U.S. Census by Frank Donnelly gives social science students and researchers alike the tools to understand, extract, process, and analyze data from the decennial census, the American Community Survey, and other data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau. More than just a data collection exercise performed every ten years, the census is a series of data sets updated on an ongoing basis. With all that data comes opportunities and challenges: opportunities to teach students the value of census data for studying communities and answering research questions, and the challenges of navigating and comprehending such a massive data source and transforming it into usable information that students and researchers can analyze with basic skills and software. Just as important as showing what the census can tell social researchers is showing how to ask good questions of census data. Exploring the U.S. Census provides a thorough background on the data collection methods, structures, and potential pitfalls of the census for unfamiliar researchers, collecting information previously available only in widely disparate sources into one handy guide. Hands-on, applied exercises at the end of the chapters help readers dive into the data.\n\nTime Issues in Strategy and Organization by T. K. Das (Editor) (Narendra Paul Loomba Department of Management)\n\nCall Number: HD30.28 .T5765 2020 (4th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9781641138598\n\nIn digital business environments real time has become a critical strategic enabler. Enforced by new digital and social technologies we consider the temporal phenomenon real time to play an increasingly central role for strategic value creation and competition. More than ever, managers use real-time information, real-time events, and real-time processes to improve their businesses. Real-time data flows enable managers to dissect events in real time, shorten their decision-making time, and at the same time deepen their understanding of markets. Moreover, real-time technologies offer the possibility of supplying markets with whole new types of services and experiences, which affects the tasks, the timing, continuity, and rhythms of the organization. But the developments in the digital economy also create a diverse sensing of real time, which triggers central questions of how should management adjust strategic decision-making processes towards a real-time-based business, and second, how can the organization build the conditions needed for capturing these strategic opportunities with real time? The increasing use of real-time technologies in business encourages us to unravel decision-makers’ real time perceptions and practices in strategy and organization. From a theoretical and historical outline and empirical findings this chapter aims at bringing knowledge to the increasing influence of real time on strategic management. This knowledge is vital for understanding the tenets of real-time management and to better guide managers and organizations into future strategic directions.\n\nThe Routledge Companion to the Contemporary American Stage Musical by Jessica Sternfeld (Editor); Elizabeth Wollman (Editor) (Department of Fine and Performing Arts)\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 9781138684614\n\nThe Routledge Companion to the Contemporary Musical is dedicated to the musical's evolving relationship to American culture in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. In the past decade-and-a-half, international scholars from an ever-widening number of disciplines and specializations have been actively contributing to the interdisciplinary field of musical theater studies. Musicals have served, not only, to mirror the sociopolitical, economic, and cultural tenor of the times, but have helped shape and influence it, in America and across the globe: a genre that may seem, at first glance, light-hearted and escapist serves also as a bold commentary on society. Forty-four essays examine the contemporary musical as an ever-shifting product of an ever-changing culture. This volume sheds new light on the American musical as a thriving, contemporary performing arts genre, one that could have died out in the post-Tin Pan Alley era but instead has managed to remain culturally viable and influential, in part by newly embracing a series of complex contradictions. At present, the American musical is a live, localized, old-fashioned genre that has simultaneously developed into an increasingly globalized, tech-savvy, intensely mediated mass entertainment form. Similarly, as it has become increasingly international in its scope and appeal, the stage musical has also become more firmly rooted to Broadway--the idea, if not the place, and thus branded as a quintessentially American entertainment.\n\nAmerican Exodus: Second-Generation Chinese Americans in China, 1901–1949 by Charlotte Brooks - History Department\n\nCall Number: E184.C5 B735 2019 (3rd Floor)\n\nISBN: 0520302680\n\nIn the first decades of the 20th century, almost half of the Chinese Americans born in the United States moved to China--a relocation they assumed would be permanent. At a time when people from around the world flocked to the United States, this little-noticed emigration belied America's image as a magnet for immigrants and a land of upward mobility for all. Fleeing racism, Chinese Americans who sought greater opportunities saw China, a tottering empire and then a struggling republic, as their promised land. “American Exodus” is the first book to explore this extraordinary migration of Chinese Americans. Their exodus shaped Sino-American relations, the development of key economic sectors in China, the character of social life in its coastal cities, debates about the meaning of culture and \"modernity\" there, and the U.S. government's approach to citizenship and expatriation in the interwar years. Spanning multiple fields, exploring numerous cities, and crisscrossing the Pacific Ocean, this book will appeal to anyone interested in Chinese history, international relations, immigration history, and Asian American studies.\n\nCrying the News by Vincent DiGirolamo - History Department\n\nCall Number: HD8039 .N422 U637 2019 (4th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9780195320251\n\nFrom Benjamin Franklin to Ragged Dick to Jack Kelley, hero of the Disney musical Newsies, newsboys have long intrigued Americans as symbols of struggle and achievement. But what do we really know about the children who hawked and delivered newspapers in American cities and towns? Who were they? What was their life like? And how important was their work to the development of a free press, the survival of poor families, and the shaping of their own attitudes, values, and beliefs? Crying the News: A History of America's Newsboys offers an epic retelling of the American experience from the perspective of its most unshushable creation. It is the first book to place newsboys at the center of American history, analyzing their inseparable role as economic actors and cultural symbols in the creation of print capitalism, popular democracy, and national character. DiGirolamo's sweeping narrative traces the shifting fortunes of these \"little merchants\" over a century of war and peace, prosperity and depression, exploitation and reform, chronicling their exploits in every region of the country, as well as on the railroads that linked them. While the book focuses mainly on boys in the trade, it also examines the experience of girls and grown-ups, the elderly and disabled, blacks and whites, immigrants and natives. Based on a wealth of primary sources, Crying the News uncovers the existence of scores of newsboy strikes and protests. The book reveals the central role of newsboys in the development of corporate welfare schemes, scientific management practices, and employee liability laws. It argues that the newspaper industry exerted a formative yet overlooked influence on working-class youth that is essential to our understanding of American childhood, labor, journalism, and capitalism.\n\nBorn Yesterday: Inexperience and the Early Realist Novel by Stephanie Insley Hershinow - English Department\n\nCall Number: PR858 .C47 H47 2019 (5th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9781421429670\n\nBetween the emergence of the realist novel in the early eighteenth century and the novel's subsequent alignment with self-improvement a century later, lies a significant moment when novelistic characters were unlikely to mature in any meaningful way. That adolescent protagonists poised on the cusp of adulthood resisted a headlong tumble into maturity through the workings of plot reveals a curious literary and philosophical counter-tradition in the history of the novel. Stephanie Insley Hershinow's Born Yesterday shows how the archetype of the early realist novice reveals literary character tout court. Through new readings of canonical novels by Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, Horace Walpole, Ann Radcliffe, Frances Burney, and Jane Austen, Hershinow severs the too-easy tie between novelistic form and character formation, a conflation, she argues, of Bild with Bildung. A pop-culture-infused epilogue illustrates the influence of the eighteenth-century novice, as embodied by Austen's Emma, in the 1995 film Clueless, as well as in dystopian YA works like The Hunger Games. Drawing on bold close readings, Born Yesterday alters the landscape of literary historical eighteenth-century studies and challenges some of novel theory's most well worn assumptions.\n\nHow Asian Brands Soar 4 by Myung-Soo Lee (Author) (Allen G. Aaronson Department of Marketing and International Business); Wooyoung Jeong (Author); Chung Kim (Author)\n\nCall Number: HD69 .B7 H692 2019 (4th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9781093663808\n\nSo many changes are happening and coming in Asia. A small start-up, locally founded in Malaysia became a very successful brand in Asia. The small start-up battled against one of the most powerful companies in the category of business. At the beginning of its business, the small company was in a much worse situation compared to the established market leaders such as Uber in almost every aspect of business infrastructure, resources, and competencies. This is the story of Grab in the ride-hailing business in Asia. How was the small start-up able to grab the hearts of Asian consumers and transform itself into such a powerful brand within the short period of 5 to 6 years? Some spectacular news have also appeared in the automobile industry. Geely, a company which once produced refrigerators, scooters, and auto-bicycle wheels, became one of the three biggest car makers in China. The company, now called Geely Group, has owned the Swedish passenger car maker Volvo Cars since 2010 and became the biggest shareholder of Mercedes-Benz by owning 9.7% of its stocks. This kind of incredible transformation from a poor-quality or mediocre brand into a high-quality, top-selling brand is occurring all over Asia and will soon bring significant changes to the West and other countries.

With discussions ranging from classroom-participation models to participation in online spaces, this collection explores the multifaceted and complex nature of participation, while demonstrating the ongoing necessity for research and theorization of this pedagogical commonplace. Pieces in this collection touch on numerous issues related to participation, including students’ perspectives on participation as an assessed category, how normative standards dictate and shape participation and how these standards can be productively challenged, and new ways to engage with the idea of participation, within the classroom and beyond it.\n\nViaggi nella scrittura postmoderna by Franco Zangrilli - Department of Modern Languages and Comparative Literature\n\nCall Number: PQ4088.Z356 2019\n\nISBN: 9788832781144\n\nThe books are born from books: according to Jorge Luis Borges, every writer must have a \"father\", a writer to imitate, and if he does not possess it, it is important that he invent it. The \"pleasure of reading\" then triggers enthusiasm and the urge to speak in literary and writers, to add something meaningful to the admired author's text. Thus the text becomes a paternal mirror also for the literary critic. Even the essays in this book have been made by themselves over the years, one after the other. They were the fruit of the passion to re-read the works of post-modern writers, from the most famous ones such as Antonio Tabucchi, Giuseppe Bonaviri, and Antonio Pennacchi, to new emerging authors such as Aldo Putignano and many artists born from the creative laboratory of Homo Scrivens, including Vincenza Alfano, Herik Mutarelli, Mariarosaria Riccio, and Serena Venditto.\n\nUndocumented Storytellers by Sarah C. Bishop - Communication Studies Department\n\nCall Number: JV6475 .B57 2019 (5th floor)\n\nISBN: 9780190917166\n\nUndocumented Storytellers offers a critical exploration of the ways undocumented immigrant activists harness the power of storytelling to mitigate the fear and uncertainty of life without legal status and to advocate for immigration reform. Sarah C. Bishop chronicles the ways young people uncover their lack of legal status experientially - through interactions with parents, in attempts to pursue rites of passage reserved for citizens, and as audiences of political and popular media. She provides both theoretical and pragmatic contextualization as activist narrators recount the experiences that influenced their decisions to cultivate public voices. Bishop draws from a mixed methodology of in-depth interviews with undocumented immigrants from eighteen unique nations of origin, critical-rhetorical ethnographies of immigrant rights events and protests, and narrative analysis of immigrant-produced digital media to interrogate the power and limitations of narrative activism. Autobiographical immigrant storytelling refutes mainstream discourse on immigration and reveals the determination of individuals who elsewhere have been vilified by stereotype and presupposition. Offering an unparalleled view into the ways immigrants' stories appear online, Bishop illuminates digital narrative strategies by detailing how undocumented storytellers reframe their messages when stories have unintended consequences. The resulting work provides broad insights into the role of strategic framing and autobiographical story-sharing in advocacy and social movements.\n\nLeonardo’s Children: Stories on Creativity by Fine Arts Leaders that will Blow your Mind by Romero, Aldemaro; Peters (Editor) (Weissman School of Arts & Sciences), Steven J. (Editor)\n\nCall Number: BF 408 .L46 2019 (3rd Floor)\n\nISBN: 97809708877\n\nWe are accustomed to seeing colleges and universities marketing themselves through rankings and athletics. Still, a new groundbreaking book shows more effective approaches. \"Leonardo's Children: Stories on Creativity by Fine Arts Leaders that will Blow Your Mind,\" demonstrates how through creative academic approaches, institutions of higher education can differentiate themselves from others while attracting both high-quality faculty and students through creative initiatives. This new book is a collection of 13 chapters by 19 authors from the United States and Europe touting the role and importance of creativity in administrating arts business, whether the administrator is an academic dean or an arts manager. The book shows, through numerous practical examples, how to succeed as an administrator and the personal joy one can have in doing so while improving students' chances to be successful regardless of their career path. This book grew out a conversation between leaders of fine arts colleges about creativity in higher education. There is a growing question about the 20th century’s psychological concept of creativity, almost 100 years since it was introduced, and its relevancy in preparing students to thrive in a world whose problems exceed the limits of creativity in any single discipline. It takes a good hard look at the question and asks, how can we extend creativity from an individual, internal process into a force that also can be generated between people?\n\nFat Nation: A History of Obesity in America by Jonathan Engel - Marxe School of Public & International Affairs\n\nCall Number: Online\n\nISBN: 1538117746\n\nThe diet and weight-loss industry is worth $66 billion. The estimated annual health care costs of obesity-related illness are 190 billion or nearly 21% of annual medical spending in the United States. But how did we get here? Is this a battle we can't win? What changes need to be made in order to scale back the incidence of obesity in the US, and, indeed, around the world? Here, Jonathan Engel reviews the sources of the problem and offers the science behind our modern propensity toward obesity. He offers a plan for helping address the problem, but admits that it is, indeed, an uphill battle. Nevertheless, given the magnitude of the costs in years of life and vigor lost, it is a battle worth fighting. Fat Nation is a social history of obesity in the United States since the Second World War. In confronting this familiar topic from a historical perspective, Jonathan Engel attempts to show that obesity is a symptom of complex changes that have transpired over the past half century to our food, our living habits, our life patterns, our built environments, and our social interactions. He offers readers solid grounding in the known science underlying obesity (genetic set points, complex endocrine feedback loops, neurochemical messengering) but then makes the novel argument that obesity is a result of the interaction of our genes with our environment. That is, our bodies have always been programmed to become obese, but until recently never had the opportunity to do so. Now, with cheap calories ubiquitous (particularly in the form of sucrose), unwalkable physical spaces, deteriorating rituals and norms surrounding eating, and the withering of cooking skills, nearly every American daily confronts the challenge of not putting on weight. Given the outcomes, though, for those who are obese, Engel encourages us to address the problems and offers suggestions to help remedy the problem.\n\nThe Paradox of Scale: How NGOs Build, Maintain, and Lose Authority in Environmental Governance by Cristina M. Balboa - Marxe School of Public & International Affairs\n\nCall Number: GE170 .B35 2018 (4th Floor)\n\nISBN: 9780262038775\n\nAn examination of why NGOs often experience difficulty creating lasting change, with case studies of transnational conservation organizations in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Why do nongovernmental organizations face difficulty creating lasting change? How can they be more effective? In this book, Cristina Balboa examines NGO authority, capacity, and accountability to propose that a \"paradox of scale\" is a primary barrier to NGO effectiveness. This paradox--when what gives an NGO authority on one scale also weakens its authority on another scale--helps explain how NGOs can be seen as an authority on particular causes on a global scale, but then fail to effect change at the local level. Drawing on case studies of transnational conservation organizations in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, The Paradox of Scale explores how NGOs build, maintain, and lose authority over time. Balboa sets a new research agenda for the study of governance, offering practical concepts and analysis to help NGO practitioners. She introduces the concept of authority as a form of legitimated power, explaining why it is necessary for NGOs to build authority at multiple scales when they create, implement, or enforce rules. Examining the experiences of Conservation International in Papua New Guinea, International Marinelife Alliance in the Philippines, and the Community Conservation Network in Palau, Balboa explains how a paradox of scale can develop even for those NGOs that seem powerful and effective. Interdisciplinary in its approach, The Paradox of Scale offers guidance for interpreting the actions and pressures accompanying work with NGOs, showing why even the most authoritative NGOs often struggle to make a"
