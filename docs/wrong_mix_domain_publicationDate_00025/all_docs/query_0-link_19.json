        "text": "My Story of Civilization\n\ni.\n\nA few days ago, I finished reading The Age of Napoleon by Will Durant and Ariel Durant, the final entry in their 11-volume Story of Civilization series. It took me just shy of a quarter century to get through the books. Combined, they are the best history books I have ever read.\n\nIt was through Isaac Asimov’s autobiography that I first discovered Will Durant, sometime in 1995. In In Memory Yet Green, Asimov wrote about how in the summer of 1945 he was about to leave the house for a meeting with his draft board:\n\nI was reading a copy of Will Durant’s Caesar and Christ, the third volume of his history of civilization and Gertrude was ironing some clothes. The radio stopped its regular programming for an emergency bulletin: The United States had dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima.\n\nAsimov added a footnote to this passage about Durant’s series:\n\nI read each volume as it came out. After I had read the first one and heard he was planning a multivolume history–five volumes was the original plan–I felt worried. I knew he was in his forties and I carefully noted in my diary that I hoped he would live long enough to complete the set. He did.\n\n(I’ve had similar worries about Robert A. Caro, hoping he will live long enough to finish the final volume of his biography of Lyndon Johnson.)\n\nI read the books slightly out of order:\n\nThe Life of Greece (1/16/2000)\n\nOur Oriental Heritage (2/3/2008)\n\nCaesar and Christ (8/7/2010)\n\nCaesar and Christ (12/27/2014)\n\nThe Age of Faith (6/22/2018)\n\nThe Renaissance (1/4/2019)\n\nThe Reformation (5/23/2020)\n\nThe Age of Reason Begins: The Story of Civilization, Vol 7 (10/3/2020)\n\nThe Age of Louis XIV (5/17/2022)\n\nThe Age of Voltaire (5/22/2022)\n\nRousseau and Revolution (3/9/2024)\n\nThe Age of Napoleon (3/16/2024)\n\nI was certain I’d read Our Oriental Heritage first, and was surprised to see it second on the list. I dug into some old diaries to affirm my memory, and sure enough, I was right–sort of. On May 4, 1999, I wrote:\n\nFinished Fact and Fancy this morning and started right in on Will Durant’s Our Oriental Heritage, the first volume of his “Story of Civilization.” The book is 440,000 words long… it will take me about 21 days to finish the book…\n\nSo why is Life of Greece first on the list? It turns out, I never finished that initial attempt to read Our Oriental Heritage and I don’t count a book on my list if I don’t finish it. I didn’t finish it because shortly after I started it, I began taking flying lessons and I set most of my reading aside for a time to focus on flying airplanes.\n\nAs I read the last lines of Napoleon, I tried and failed to remember when and how I first obtained the books. Back to the diary I went, and found that I bought my first Durant books on April 10, 1999:\n\nLate in the afternoon I drove over to the Iliad Bookshop where I bought 3 used volumes of Will Durant’s “Story of Civilization” series for just under $20. The volumes I got were The Life of Greece (Vol II); The Age of Faith (Vol IV); and The Renaissance (Vol VII)\n\nWhen did I get Our Oriental Heritage? It had to have been before May 4, 1999. Some more digging and, much to my surprise, I found the following on April 19, 1999:\n\nGrandpa called tonight–he said he had a surprise for me–and then proceeded to tell me he picked up Vols, I, III, and VI of Will Durant’s “The Story of Civilization” series for me at a used bookshop in Nyack.\n\nBetween May 4, 1999 and the day I finished the final volume of the series, 9,063 days elapsed, or 24 years, 9 months and 28 days. The series tops off around 13,000 pages, which puts it somewhere between 2.5 and 3 million words. That’s a lot of reading. In fact, it turns out there were years in which the total amount I read was less than 13,000 pages, as the chart below indicates (the red dashed line shows 13,000 pages).\n\nI never read more than two of the volumes in a single year, reading one in 2000, 2008, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2019. I read two volumes in 2020, 2022 and 2024. Of the 11 volumes, I’ve read two of them twice: The Life of Greece and Caesar and Christ.\n\nii.\n\nAs Asimov mentioned, the Durants’ original plan was for five books. The scope increased with each successive volume until their tenth, Rousseau and Revolution, published in 1967, in which they concluded with the following envoi:\n\nThis is the concluding volume of that Story of Civilization to which we devoted ourselves in 1929, and which has been the daily chore and solace of our lives ever since[Ellipsis] We shall not sin at such length again; but if we manage to elude the Reaper for another year or two we hope to offer a summarizing essay on “The Lessons of History”.\n\nTrue to their word, they did write The Lessons of History, published in 1968 (which I read in 2019, and of which I have a signed copy). Then Rousseau and Revolution won the Pulitzer for General Nonfiction, and I imagine that, coupled with what must have seemed like boredom to the globe-trotting Durants, decided them to head back to the typewriter for one more volume, The Age of Napoleon, published in 1975.\n\nI can’t read a magnum opus like this without wanting to know more about the people who spent a lifetime working on such a project. This happened to me when I read Dumas Malone’s 6-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson; I followed it up with a biography of Dumas Malone, Long Journey with Mr. Jefferson by William C. Hyland, Jr. And when I finished everything that Robert A. Caro has written thus far, I followed it up with his book Working .\n\nIt was, therefore, natural for me to read Will & Ariel Durant’s A Dual Autobiography several years ago. Not only was it an interesting read, but it gave fascinating insights into how such a massive effort was made in times long before computing. Ariel Durant described some of the research process:\n\nIt took me some time to realize how important a role was played in a book by the organization of the material, and how the same contents less wisely arranged might have led to repetition, confusion, and failure. ==The mere organization (as distinct from gathering) of the material was the most back-breaking part of the total operation==. Will undertook the initial part. As he explained it to me, he divided the book into chapters, generally following geographical order (Near East, India, China, Japan), and within each region, mediating between chronological sequence and topical unity (economics, government, religion, language, literature, philosophy, etc.). Then he marked with a Roman numeral each of the approximately thirty thousand slips that had been gathered for Volume I, according to the chapter to which it belonged…\n\n[Will Durant] prepared and typed, for each chapter in turn, an outline consisting of several hundred headings, consecutively numbered with Arabic numerals. Then he presented to the family and his other aides the slips that he had assigned to Chapter I, together with the chapter outline; and our task was to read each slip and to number it according to the heading under which we judged it belonged. We estimate an average chapter of Story used some fifteen hundred slips, or about thirty thousand per volume; our attic rooms are bulging with the boxes of used slips.\n\nOf those “slips” that Ariel Durant describes, she has said the following:\n\nUsually we read about five hundred volumes for each of our books. I don’t mean to say that we read these books aloud to each other, but we do read them at approximately the same time, discuss them, and make notes. The hundreds of cards in this file are some of the notes relating to Volume 10.\n\nAnd that is only a part. We have a thousand notes in the typewritten form in galley sheets. Every note we take from our readings includes the name of the book, the author, and the page from which it was taken. The scissored slips are placed exactly where they belong in the detailed outline of our chapter.\n\nThis seems a remarkably similar precursor to Ryan Holiday’s notecard system, which just goes to show that history is constantly repeating itself, one of the many lessons that is made clear by the Story of Civilization.\n\nThe Durants began researching the books in 1929 and they finally finished in 1975–a forty-six year span of enormous work. That they were able to do this project at all is due to another book Will Durant wrote before The Story of Civilization. He wrote The Story of Philosophy in the 1920s and it was bestseller that helped put him and Simon & Schuster on the map, and allowed the Durants the financial freedom to pursue their research for Story around the world.\n\niii.\n\nAny history of the scope that the Durants present will be marred with errors and omissions. Like any diligent, self-aware researchers, the Durants acknowledgedf these imperfections. In writing about prehistoric India in Our Oriental Heritage, he said:\n\nRecent researches have marred this comforting picture–as future researches will change the perspective of these pages.\n\nAbout half of Our Oriental Heritage was dedicated to the history of Indian, Japanese, and Chinese civilizations. I wished for more. I read somewhere that the Durants had planned editions on North and South American native civilizations as well, but the existing scope exceeded the time that life and energy provided them. In my imagination, I wonder at the volumes they might have produced on Aztec or Mayan civilization, or the native cultures and civilizations that predated European arrival into the new world. These Durant-authored volumes are left to my imagination.\n\nThey wrote about what most interested them and it was a fortunate coincidence that many of their interested and mine overlapped. I forgive their errors and omissions as the result of an enormous amount of work and research performed not my an army but by two mortal adults and a handful of helpers. I have to feel this way. In my own work, I recognize the scope of the work I do (writing code, managing projects) inevitably leaves gaps, bugs, and room for improvement.\n\niv.\n\nWhat makes these books the best histories I’ve ever read? I think it is a combination of three things: scope, continuity, and the writing.\n\nFrom the beginning, Durant attempted to write an “integral” history. As he wrote in the preface to the first volume:\n\nI have long felt that our usual method of writing history in separate longitudinal sections–economic history, political history, religious history, the history of philosophy, the history of literature, the history of science, the history of music, the history of art–does injustice to the unity of human life; that history should be written collaterally as well as lineally, synthetically as well as analytically; and that the ideal historiography would seek to portray in each period the total complex of a nation’s culture, institutions, adventures and ways.\n\nFortune prepared me for this method. I attended a humanities magnet high school in Los Angeles in which our core classes were constructed in a similarly integral way, with courses on philosophy, literature, social institutions, and art history, tied together against a similar backdrop in time. The scope of Durants volumes is vast and varied and because of it, I learned more about subjects that I never imagined I’d be interested in, and yet found them all fascinating. Despite the length of the volumes, there wasn’t a dull moment. And the integral method made clear the contemporaneousness of the history, science, art, music, religion, philosophy. Each discipline feeds each other in an intricate web that isn’t always obvious in longitudinal sections.\n\nThe volumes also provided continuity in a way that I had not previously experienced reading or studying history. It is a continuity that creeps up on your as you make your way through the pages. We begin with the shadowy prehistoric times without individuals, but rather individual remains of anonymous ancestors in the days before civilization and by the end of the 11th volume, we are dealing with detailed biographies of historic figures (Napoleon, Tallyrand, Thomas Jefferson) who are not many generations removed from ourselves. And yet, after the first 100 introductory pages of the first volume, there was never a sudden jump, never a rapid leap forward in time. Things moved smoothly from past-to-present. That continuity provided a unique insight into human history for me. It was as if I watched as people in the ancient Sumerian city of Ur tapped their successive generation shoulder, and that generation tapped the next and soon we were in Egypt, and Babylonia, and so on down to Louis XVI and Samuel Johnson. This continuity gave me a perspective of history that I hadn’t had before, and I’m not sure such a perspective is possible without the scope the Durants achieved in these volumes. There is a kinship that forms with those dead thousands of years, as when an ancient Sumerian tablet reads, “the city, where the tumult of man is.”\n\nContinuity highlights repetition. Consider Edmund Burke writing on democracy in the ancient world, and in the modern:\n\nDemocracy in Athens and Rome brought no cure for the evils of government, for it soon became dictatorship through the ability of demagogues to win admiration from gullible majorities.\n\nFinally, there is the writing, the voice, the erudite guide that carries you through thousands of years of human triumph and misery. Durant has an elegant, old-world style in which his premises come at the end of a paragraph rather than the beginning, often with witty charm, as when he writes of the toilers of Babylonia:\n\nPart of the country was still wild and dangerous; snakes wandered in the thick grass, and the kings of Babylonia and Assyria made it their royal sport to hunt in hand-to-hand conflict the lions that prowled in the woods, posed placidly for the artists, but fled timidly at the nearer approach of men. Civilization is an occasional and temporary interruption of the jungle. [Emphasis mine.]\n\nThat voice sets the tone of the entire series. The Durants come across as true companions, and I think Durant knew this. In the last words of the penultimate volume in the series, Durant wrote:\n\nWe thank the reader who has been with us these many years for part or all of the long journey. We have ever been mindful of his presence. Now we take our leave and bid him farewell.\n\nI was overcome by a strange set of emotions upon finishing the final volume. Here I’d walked with Roman emperors and Japanese peasants. I’d seen battles fought in the desert, and averted by the random passing of the moon across the face of the sun. I’d spent hours with the greatest thinkers, artists, creators, and inventors. I’d lived thousands of lifetimes in the pages of these books, and now they were all over. It was a bittersweet conclusion. I was reminded of a verse (quoted in Rousseau and Revolution) by Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. In the margins, I jotted: “An apt epitaph to the Durants’ adventure.”\n\nLo, I have reached my goal! The stirring thought\n\nThrills through my spirit. Thine all powerful arm,\n\nMy Lord, my God, alone hath guided me\n\nBy more than one dark grave, ere I might reach\n\nThat distant goal! Thou, Lord, hast healed me still,\n\nHast shed fresh courage o’re my sinking heart,\n\nWhich held with death its near companionship;\n\nAnd if I gazed on terrors, their dark shapes\n\nSoon disappeared, for thou protectedst me!\n\nSwiftly they vanished.–Savior, I have sung\n\nThy covenant of Mercy. I have trod\n\nMy fearful path! My hope has been in Thee!\n\nIn the end, the Durants’ volumes reinforced a truth my mother told me when I was five or six years old: books can take you anywhere.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.

I generally set myself a goal of 100 books a year, but that arbitrary. Some books are barely 100 pages, while others are over 1,000 pages. The goal of 100 books loomed large in my head for a time, but more and more, I’m less concerned with how many books I read than enjoying the book I do manage to finish, and learning all I can from them\n\nI was thinking about this because this morning, Goodreads reminded me that I was 6 book “behind schedule.” I wondered about that. Why was I behind schedule? It turns out that the books I’ve read so far this year have been longer books.\n\nWhat is a long book? Regular readers are aware that I have been keeping a list of all of the books I’ve finished reading since 1996. In the decades that I’ve kept my list, I’ve had to deal with fact that some years I read more books than others. This is true even when it seems I spend the same amount of time reading year-to-year. To that end, I’ve developed a measurement that I call “BEq,” or “book equivalent.” Over the 28-years of my list, the average length of a book I’ve read is 410 pages. I set 1.0 BEq equal to 410 pages. If I read s 300 page book, that is 300/410, or 0.73 BEq. If I read a 950 page book that is 950/410 = 2.32 BEq. I consider a “short” book to be 1 standard deviation below the average, or 0.46 BEq. I consider a long book to be 1 standard deviations above the average, or 1.57 BEq.\n\nHere is a chart showing the average BEq by year. Darker bars are years in which the average BEq is greater than 1.0:\n\nSo far, this year, the average BEq is 1.26. That is still my defined BEq for a long book of 1.57, but it is the second highest average BEq I’ve had in 28 years. (For the average BEq for a year to be over 1.57, it means I would have need to have read much longer books.)\n\nWhat are these long book that I’ve been reading this year? At the time of this writing, I’ve finished 11 books. Of those 11 books, about a third are “long” books by my definition:\n\nMy Name Is Barbra by Barbra Streisand (1,040 pages / 2.54 BEq)\n\nThe Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes (886 pages / 2.16 BEq)\n\nMasters of the Air by Donald L. Miller (671 pages / 1.64 BEq)\n\nRacing for the Bomb by Robert S. Norris (752 pages / 1.83 BEq)\n\nThese four books along total 8.17 BEq, or an average of 2.04 BEq: that is, the equivalent of reading 2 books for every one book I read.\n\nIn addition, I am currently making my way through 3 long books. (I don’t count books in-progress on my list. I have to finish a book before it goes on the list;) These are:\n\nDark Sun by Richard Rhodes (736 pages / 1.80 BEq)\n\nThe Princeton Companion to Mathematics by Timothy Gowers (1,034 pages / 2.52 BEq)\n\nRousseau and Revolution by Will Durant and Ariel Durant (1,091 pages / 2.66 BEq)\n\nAll of these books are well over my defined length for a long book. Combined, they average 2.33 BEq. And this trend doesn’t look like it is stopping any time soon. The last of these book, Rousseau and Revolution is the penultimate book in Will and Ariel Durant’s Story of Civilization series. Up next on my list is the final book, The Age of Napoleon, which, at 872 pages, is 2.13 BEq. If you factor all these in for 2024, then my average BEq for the year is 1.49 — very close to the 1.57 BEq mark for long books. So far, then, 2024 is the year of the long book.\n\nThere is something about long books that I find irresistible. Maybe it is because I choose these books carefully, and more often than night, they are great reads and I never want them to end. The fact that they are long means I can savor them for a longer period of time. And ultimately, savoring one book is more important to me than reading 50 of them.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.

I also read around 300 feature articles in magazines. What follows is my top 10 best book reads of 2023 and some of my favorite articles of 2023. For those interested in more details of my overall reading for 2023, see the section that follow this which summarizes my reading for 2023.\n\nMy Favorite Books for 2023\n\n1. Avid Reader: A Life by Robert Gottlieb\n\nI have to admit that I didn’t know who Robert Gottlieb was at the start of 2023, although I’ve read several of the books he has edited. Then, in July, I came across a documentary called Turn Every Page about the relationship between Robert A. Caro and his editor Robert Gottlieb. It was a great documentary, directed by Gottlieb’s daughter, Lizzie Gottlieb. I’ve read all of Caro’s books (indeed, I’ve recently acquired a personalized signed copy of his short book, Working) and I’m always fascinated by people who make a single subject their life’s work (see also: Will Durant and Dumas Malone). After watching the documentary, I searched for books by Gottlieb and discovered he’d written a memoir, Avid Reader: A Life.\n\nNot since reading Isaac Asimov’s 3-volume autobiography have I come across such a detailed inside look at the book publishing world. It was a delightful, fascinating read that spoke to me on many levels. I think of myself as an avid reader, but I am lazy in comparison to Gottlieb. I didn’t want the book to end, and when it finally ended, I did something I’ve done only one other time in the 28 years I’ve been keeping my reading list: I immediately started the book over and read it a second time. And you know what, it was even better on the second go-around. It was, hands down, my favorite read of 2023.\n\n2. Les Miserables by Victor Hugo\n\nYears ago, Kelly and I went to a local performance of Les Mis. I don’t remember much about it, but the book, Les Miserables, has always intrigued me for its size and popularity. I decided to give it a try in the spring. I found that almost from the first page, I couldn’t put the book down. It had a bit of everything, and it was fascinating. I loved the non-sequitur essays in the book and the rhythm of the language (I read the Julie Rose translation).\n\nLater in the summer, when we were in Paris, I wanted to seek out the places in the novel, but we were there for only a short time, and I was a little sad that the city no longer looked way it was pictured in Hugo’s novel.\n\nI estimate that I’ve read something in the neighborhood of 550 novels in my life (a little over 500 since 1996) and when I finished Les Miserables it instantly jumped to the top stop of best novels I’ve ever read.\n\nIt was also the longest book I read in 2023 but, as it turns out, only the 5th longest book I’ve read overall, beaten out by The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany by William L. Shirer (1,616 pages), Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898 by Mike Wallace and Edwin G. Burrows (1,423 pages), Executive Orders by Tom Clancy (1,358 pages), and The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York **by Robert A. Caro (1,345 pages).\n\n3/4. Stella Maris and The Passenger by Cormac McCarthy\n\nI read The Passenger for our book club, and I really liked it. I just had to read the follow-on book, Stella Maris, which I enjoyed even better. It is one of those rare novels that could be done as a play. These were the second and third Cormac McCarthy books I’ve read and so far, I’ve thought all of his books were excellent.\n\n5. Why We Love Baseball: A History in 50 Moments by Joe Posnanski\n\nI had been looking forward to Why We Love Baseball ever since Joe Posnanski announced it. Recall that my favorite book of 2021 was Joe Posnanski’s The Baseball 100. I was not disappointed. Joe writes so passionately about baseball. He is a modern-day Red Smith. There is a reason why I love Joe Posnanski’s writing.\n\n6. Doom Guy: Life In First Person by John Romero\n\nI was never really a Doom player, but I’ve been a software developer my entire life and it was fascinating to read about someone who grew up with computers in a manner similar to me, beginning with machines like a Commodore Vic-20 and copying code out of computer magazines. Doom Guy was a honest, fascinating read.\n\n7. Making It So: A Memoir by Patrick Stewart\n\nToward the end of each year, I tend to read Hollywood memoirs. They are a kind of guilty pleasure for me. Making It So by Patrick Stewart was one of these. This was a book that made me want to be an actor after reading it, always a good sign because it conveys its message so well.\n\n8. The Maniac by Benjamin Labatut\n\nReally smart people fascinate me. I read a fascinating biography of John von Neumann back in 2022, The Man from the Future by Ananyo Bhattacharya. So when I saw that there was a novel based on von Neumann’s life, The Maniac by Benjamin Labatut, I had to read it, and it was a fun, fantastic read.\n\nFavorite articles of 2023\n\nEarly in 2023, I wrote a script that sends me an email each evening with a random article from the variety of print magazines I get in the mail. Here is an example email from last night.\n\nI try to read a feature article every day of the year, and here are a few of the more than 300 that I read in 2023 that really stood out.\n\nBaseball and Time by Joe Posnanski — JoeBlogs (3/23)\n\nDown the River Roosevelt by Larry Rohter — Smithsonian (4/23)\n\nJudy Blume Goes All the Way by Amy Weiss-Meyer — Atlantic (4/23)\n\nA Love Letter to Riverside by David Danelski — UCR Magazine (Spring 2023)\n\nWhy People Hate Open Offices (Psychology) by George Musser — Scientific American (4/23)\n\nHow Baseball Saved Itself by Mark Leibovich — Atlantic (7-8/23)\n\nPostscript: Robert Gottlieb by David Remnick — New Yorker (6/26/2023)\n\n“How America Got Mean” by David Brooks — Atlantic (9/23)\n\n“17,517,490 Memories, Missing”[AliasDelimiter] by Megan Greenwall — Wired (9/23)\n\nInside the Revolution at OpenAI by Ross Andersen — Atlantic (9/23)\n\nThe Ones We Sent Away by Jennifer Senior — Atlantic (9/23)\n\nDreams of My Father by Karl Ove Knausgaard — Harpers (9/23)\n\nThe Golden Fleece by Joe Kloc — Harper’s (10/23)\n\nA Coder Considers the Waning Days of the Craft by James Somers — New Yorker (11/20/23)\n\nWhy the Godfather of A.I. Fears What He’s Built by Joshua Rothman — New Yorker (11/20/23)\n\nThe Inside Story of Microsoft’s Partnership with OpenAI by Charles Duhigg — New Yorker (12/1/23)\n\nSummary of my 2023 reading\n\nI read 101 books in 2023, once again hitting my Goodreads goal of 100 books. I read my 1,300th book since 1996 in 2023 and ending the year with a total of 1,330 books since 1996. About a third of the books I read were fiction, the remaining two-thirds non-fiction. I’ve recently been working on a two-level taxonomy for my reading, and here’s how it breaks down at the high level for 2023:\n\nWithin each of these top-level categories are about a dozen sub-categories, so that, for instance, the Literature and Fiction category breaks down as follows for 2023:\n\nThe next biggest subject area I read in 2023 was science and technology, the breakdown of which looks as follows:\n\nOverall, here is the breakdown for the types of books I read in 2023:\n\nMy goal for 2024 is another 100 books and 300 articles, and so far, I am well on my way. Here are my best reads from previous years:\n\nMy best reads of 2022\n\nMy best reads of 2021\n\nMy best reads of 2020\n\nMy best reads of 2019\n\nMy best reads of 2018\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nA Journey Through the Star Trek Lit-Verse\n\nOver Thanksgiving I read Patrick Stewart’s new memoir, Making It So, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Reading it put me in mind of Star Trek, even though Stewart’s time on the show and the films make up a relatively small portion of the book. I know little Star Trek lore beyond what most casual viewers of the show know. Indeed, I’ve never seen most episodes of the original series. The series with which I am most familiar is The Next Generation, and even there I have large gaps in my viewing. Deep Space Nine, and Voyagers are unknown to me. I have seen and enjoyed the newer films, but I understand that there are supposed to take place on an alternate timeline.\n\nAnd thus begins the complications of the last few days. Arriving back from a long holiday weekend in New York, and needing a break from the long run of nonfiction I’ve been reading lately (18 out of the last 20 books), I was looking for something fun and entertaining to read and it occurred to me: what about a Star Trek novel?\n\nI can hear those of your with much greater Star Trek knowledge than I possess laughing. It is one thing to want to read a Star Trek novel. It is something else entirely to figure out where to begin. Within 20 minutes of searching, I discovered the Star Trek “Lit-verse” and it is as vast as Gene Roddenberry’s galaxy. In a situation like this, the easiest thing for me is to begin at the beginning. But I couldn’t even find a list of all of the Star Trek novels in publication order. The Wikipedia page that lists Star Trek novels is huge, and contains multiple, overlapping lists. A single sub-list (“numbered novels”) contains 97 entries between 1979-2002.\n\nMore searching led me to The Trek Collective which had a Trek-Lit Reading Order Flow Chart, the complexity of which reminded me of a diagram one might find in Engineering on the Enterprise. While impressive in its detail and complexity, it made it no clearer where to start. The Star Trek Lit-verse Reading Guide broke things down by series, but it still didn’t answer the simple question, “Where should I start?” It did offer a useful piece of advice, however:\n\nMy goal here was to include every link possible and leave the continuity problems up to the reader to resolve. If you don’t want a book in your personal continuity, then just ignore it. Don’t become so invested in continuity that you forget to enjoy the stories themselves.\n\nUltimately, I opted for three books from different series to start with, mostly by hunt-and-peck method:\n\nCaptain to Captain by Greg Cox\n\nThe Captain’s Oath by Christopher L. Bennett\n\nThe Autobiography of Kathryn Janeway by Una McCormack\n\nI began reading Captain to Captain yesterday and, so far, it has been a lot of fun. Just the kind of fun that I was looking for.\n\nI asked ChatGPT the following just after I started reading Captain to Captain: “I want to start reading some novels in the Star Trek universe, but there are so many of them I don’t even know where to begin. Can you suggest a pathway through these novels that makes sense?” ChatGPT responded with the following list to start with:\n\nThe Original Series\n\nSpock’s World by Diane Duane\n\nThe Entropy Effect by Vonda N. McIntyre\n\nThe Next Generation\n\nQ-Squared by Peter David\n\nImzadi by Peter David\n\nDeep Space Nine\n\nThe Never-Ending Sacrifice by Una McCormack\n\nA Stitch in Time by Andrew J. Robinson\n\nVoyager\n\nFull Circle by Kirsten Beyer\n\nEnterprise\n\nThe Good That Men Do by Andy Mangels and Michael A. Martin\n\nCrossover Novels\n\nFederation by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens\n\nNew Frontier series by Peter David\n\n“Discovery” and “Picard” novels\n\nObviously, I’m still figuring out which direction to go here. If anyone has advice or suggestions as to how to tackle this thorny problem, or if anyone knows of a list that guides one through a good selection of the novels and stories in the Star Trek universe, I’d be grateful if you shared your thoughts and suggestions in the comments.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.

I recall the magazine sitting around the table beside his chair. I would occasionally skim through it. I must have come across Stephen Jay Gould’s column, “This View of Life” at some point, but I can’t remember when. Besides, at time, I his columns were beyond my abilities. Even now, those columns push me to my limits.\n\nI say this because this year, I have finally gotten around to reading Gould’s books of essays that collect most of the 300 columns he wrote for Natural History. Unlike my usual practice, I’m not going through the collections in order of appearance, but instead, somewhat haphazardly. In order of my reading this year, I’ve made my way through the following volumes:\n\nEver Since Darwin: Reflections on Natural History\n\nThe Panda’s Thumb: More Reflections on Natural History\n\nDinosaur in a Haystack: Reflections in Natural History\n\nBully for Brontosaurus: Reflections in Natural History\n\nThe Flamingo’s Smile: Reflections in Natural History\n\nHen’s Teeth and Horses Toes: Further Reflections in Natural History\n\nLeonardo’s Mountain of Clams and Diet of Worms: Essays on Natural History\n\nEight Little Piggies: Reflections in Natural History\n\nDuring this year, I also managed to read Gould’s A Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History and The Mismeasure of Man.\n\nIf my research is correct, there are two more books of Natural History essays that I have yet to read: The Lying Stones of Marrakech and I Have Landed. I’m doubtful I’ll get through these two remaining books before the year is out because I have quite a few books in line ahead of them. But you never know.\n\nI came to essays primarily through Isaac Asimov’s science essay column in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction and I have written how at the time those essays taught me almost everything I know about science. Gould’s essays are much more challenging reads than Asimov’s essays were, but in some ways, the essays are more rewarding, and have introduced me to and instructed me in areas and methods of science with which I’d had little familiarity.\n\nOver the years I’ve developed a fondness for the science essay that places it in my personal pantheon of favorites as high–if not slightly higher–in ranking as the personal essay. One of the strengths of both Asimov’s and Gould’s essays is that they are personal in some regard. I imagine writing a future post that focuses on the history and value of the science essays, especially long-term essay columnists like Asimov and Gould and Martin Gardner, as well as their predecessors like Willie Ley and R.S. Richardson. In such an essay, I might wonder about the disappearance of regular science essays columns and explore that path in the same way Gould explores evolutionary dead-ends.\n\nBut here I wanted to talk about Gould’s essays and the impact they’ve had on me already. When I started reading them, back in May, I went in with the notion that they would be similar to Asimov’s given their popularity. In actual fact, the essays are nothing alike. In his wonderful editorial, “The Mosaic and the Plate Glass” (Isaac Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine, Oct. 1980), the Good Doctor expounds on his theory of writing. Mosaic writing is complex, layered, multifaceted writing; plate glass is clear and shows directly through to the point. He couldn’t have provided a better analogy for comparing Gould’s writing to his own, for when I began reading Ever Since Darwin, I recognized almost at once that this was mosaic writing to Asimov’s plate glass.\n\nAs I do with most books these day, I began with the audiobook edition of Ever Since Darwin, but I found the subject matter and the complexity of the writing to be enough of a challenge that I knew the audiobook editions alone wouldn’t be good enough. I needed the physical books to help follow along with Gould’s arguments. This is not so much a criticism of Gould’s writing as it my ability to understand the subject matter. Indeed, I found that I enjoyed Gould’s style of science writing more than I did Asimov’s. Asimov was a great explainer. He didn’t write down to the reader, but he often simplified concepts–a good thing for the lay reader.\n\nGould on the other hands wrote those essays for other professionals and expected that readers of the column would rise to the challenge. These essays are a challenge for me, but I enjoy that challenge, I enjoy puzzling my way through Gould’s arguments to make sure that I understand them. I come away from each one a better-equipped thinker.\n\nI ordered copies of the Gould collections I didn’t already have in hardcopy. That is to say, all of them except Dinosaur in a Haystack, which I picked up in college when it first came out, and which has been sitting on my shelf unread ever since–until this year. I found most of them easily enough, but a few were out of print and I had to locate them from secondhand bookshops online. I was mildly annoyed by this, until fortune stepped in, as it so often has, in my book-buying activity. One place had used copies of The Lying Stones of Marrakech and Leonardo’s Mountain Clams and the Diet of Worms and I ordered both. When they arrived I put them in their proper places on the shelf until I was ready to read them. As I mentioned, I haven’t yet read The Lying Stones of Marrakech, but one day, when I was pulling Leonardo’s Mountain of Clams… off the shelf, I noticed a sticker on The Lying Stones of Marrakech that read “SIGNED.” I flipped open the book and saw this:\n\nThe Lying Stones of Marrakech is the penultimate book in the series of essays and was published on April 11, 2000. Gould died in May 2002, which means the book must have been signed by Gould sometime in that 2-year span. It is a joy to have a signed Gould book in my collection.\n\nGould’s essays have had a notable effect on me. For thing, I’ve learned more about natural history than I ever knew before. The books have opened my eyes to the natural world around me. The range of subjects covered by the books is vast, although nearly always related to some aspect of evolution. They seems to cover everything, from how camouflage evolved in the natural world, to why no one will likely ever hit .400 in the major leagues again.\n\nRecently, for instance, I was out a morning walk. We have a lot of deer in the park woods in our area and seeing them munching along the bike path is a common site in the mornings and evenings. On this particular fall morning, the foliage was riotous, the bike path was covered in leaves, as was the floor of the woods that surrounded me on both sides as I walked.\n\nI would not have noticed the young deer to my left had it not raised its head. I caught the motion from the corner of my eye and when I looked there was the young deer standing among a background of similarly colored shrubs and leaves. Experience told me that if I saw one deer, there were likely others around, so I stopped and stood still and peered into the woods. At first, all I saw was a tangle of limbs and leaves that was almost too much to take in. But then as I watched, several deer emerged from that tangle in way that I can only describe as similar to the way the image in those stereograms from the 1980s emerged once you learned how to focus past them. One moment, I was looking at empty woods, the next it seemed full of deer.\n\nIf Asimov’s essays formed a foundation on the scientific method and way that science works (his essays were often steeped in the history of science), then Gould’s by comparison have been a graduate courses in the same subjects. Gould’s essays teach not only scientific method and logical thinking, but they challenge with edge cases, give examples of long-accepted arguments that are filled with fallacies, and breakdown the complexities of real science into its component parts. The history he delves into is often the history of science as a self-correcting process.\n\nLike many writers and scientists, Gould’s theories are sometimes seen as controversial. His theory of punctuated equilibrium raised eyebrows, and as I have been working my way through Gould’s essays, I’ve also been sure to read his critics–something his essays helped reinforce. I finally got around to reading Richard Dawkins’s The Selfish Gene. And I recently read Daniel C. Dennett’s memoir I’ve Been Thinking and his book Consciousness, Explained both of which have some criticism of Gould and his theories. I take these criticisms seriously, and I don’t yet understand all of theories well enough to make a good judgement as to where I fall. What I can say is that Gould’s essays are among the most intellectually challenging I have come across, and what a joy the experience of reading them has been.\n\nIndeed, I may have to read them again to full grasp the underlying theories Gould writes about. But I look forward to this task with enthusiasm. I am working my way toward reading another Gould book that has been sitting on my shelf unread for 21 years now: his magnum opus, The Structure of Evolutionary Theory. At 1,400 pages, it is a massive tome, and not without controversy and criticism, with some critics calling the book unreadable. I take this statement with a grain of salt. Gould’s essays are difficult but there is a beauty in that challenge, and I can see how any writing that isn’t spoon-fed to a reader can be characterized as “unreadable.” Gould often writes about how he goes to original sources as much as possible for many reasons, a good lesson in critical thinking, and one that I want to embrace by reading and judging The Structure of Evolutionary Theory on my own.\n\nBut that may be a project for 2024 and beyond.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.

The day after Labor Day is one of the best book release days of the year so far. There are three books released on September 5th that I am eagerly awaiting:\n\nWhy We Love Baseball: A History in 50 Moments by Joe Posnanski. Joe’s previous book, The Baseball 100 was my favorite book of 2021. I’ve been eagerly awaiting this book ever since it was first announced. I’ve pre-ordered the audio edition, as well as a signed copy of the hard cover from Rainy Day Books in Kansas City.\n\nHolly by Stephen King. Holly Gibney debuted in the first of the Bill Hodges novels, Mister Mercedes. Since that trilogy, she had made appearances in The Outsider, and in the novella, “If It Bleeds.” Now she’s got a novel all of her own.\n\nThe Longmire Defense by Craig Johnson. Johnson’s Longmire books have become among my favorites. I absolutely love the series and I look forward to each new addition the minute I finish one. Which means I have been awaiting The Longmire Defense since I finished reading Hell and Back a little less than a year ago.\n\nI’ve listed these three books in the order I plan to read them. It wouldn’t surprise me if I got through all three of them within a week or 10 days of their September 5th release. But these are not the only books I am looking forward to reading this fall.\n\nI have been making my way through Stephen Jay Gould’s essay collections on natural history. Many of the essays in these books came from the column he wrote in Natural History for more than 20 years, finally ending in January 2001, with his 300th column. I haven’t been reading the collecting in order of release, but rather as I pick them off the shelf. I’ve also recently read Gould’s A Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, and I am currently working my way through his The Mismeasure of Man.\n\nAudible has been releasing versions of Gould’s essay collections recently, and another one, The Flamingo’s Smile, is coming out on September 12, a week after the embarras de richesse of September 5. I have all of these essay collection in paperback form, but I enjoy Jonathan Sleep, who narrates the audiobook edition, and I am looking forward to reading The Flamingo’s Smile after I finish The Longmire Defense.\n\nAll of these Gould books are leading up to a conclusion: I’m hoping to tackle Gould’s magnum opus, The Structure of Evolutionary Theory–or at least get started on it–this fall. This book has been sitting on my shelf for 21 years. I bought it when it first came out, but I’ve never felt prepared to tackle it, until now. Gould, like Asimov, wrote his essays for a wide audience, but unlike Asimov, who strove for clarity, Gould’s essays make the reader–or this reader, anyway–work for them. They are not easy to get through, but they are always rewarding, and I’ve learned a lot from them beyond the bare subjects of each piece. With these essays under my belt, and I fair understanding of Gould’s work, I finally feel like I’m ready to tackle this massive, 1,400 page book.\n\nSome other books I’m looking forward to this fall include:\n\nElon Musk by Walter Isaacson. I’ve enjoyed all of the Isaacson biographies I’ve read. (I was most impressed by his biography of Leonardo da Vinci.) Comes out September 12.\n\nOf Time and Turtles: Mending the World, Shell by Shattered Shell by Sy Montgomery. I’ve enjoyed several of Montgomery’s book in the past. This one comes out September 19.\n\nSurely You Can’t Be Serious by David Sucker, Jim Abraham, and Jerry Zucker. If the names (or title) seems familiar, these are the guys who wrote movies like Airplane and The Naked Gun. Comes out October 3.\n\nI’ve Been Thinking by Daniel C. Dennett. Comes out October 3.\n\nMaking It So: A Memoir by Patrick Stewart. Comes out October 3, but I may save this one for December, when I am in Florida. That is when I traditionally read my guilty-pleasure Hollywood memoirs.\n\nThe Best American Science and Nature Writing 2023 edited by Carl Zimmer. Combines essays and science, two of my favorite things. Comes out on October 17, my 29th anniversary with my company.\n\nThe Exchange by John Grisham. This is a direct sequel to The Firm. It comes out on October 17.\n\nThe Book on the Bookshelf by Henry Petroski. Comes out October 17.\n\nA Brief History of Intelligence: Evolution, AI, and the Five Breakthroughs That Made Our Brains by Max Solomon Bennett. Comes out October 24.\n\nThe Secret Life of John le Carré by Adam Sisman. I found Sisman’s biography of le Carré quite good, and I am looking forward to this follow-up, which comes out on October 24.\n\nBeing Henry: The Fonz and Beyond by Henry Winkler. This one comes out on Halloween, October 31, but this is another one I might save for Florida in December.\n\nRemembrance: Selected Correspondence of Ray Bradbury which comes out on November 7.\n\nThere are other books on my list, but this is a fairly ambitious list for the fall, especially when I include The Structure of Evolutionary Theory in the mix. Are there book you are looking forward to this fall? Tell me about them in the comments.\n\n(And for those who are curious, here are the books I’ve read so far in 2023.)\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.

The bookshelves looked so tall and they were so full of books. Even then I knew I wanted to read all of them. I settled on one: The Nine Planets by Franklyn M. Branley. This library was my Helen.\n\nII\n\nIn W.P. Kinsella’s Shoeless Joe, while standing on a baseball diamond that Ray Kinsella has built in cornfield, the eponymous Jackson asks Kinsella, “Is this heaven?” It is the question I frequently asked myself when I pulled open the doors of the Granada Hills branch of the Los Angeles Public Library on hot summer days after a mile-long trek from my house. The door would WHOOSH as I pulled it open and I’d be assaulted by blast of icy cold air from the bowels of the library.\n\nWhen I read of the Green Town library in Ray Bradbury’s Something Wicked This Way Comes, it was the Granada Hills library that I pictured. I whiled away countless summer mornings in that library, roaming the rows of books. I knew the order of the books in the 500 section by heart. I went through the rack of Choose-Your-Own-Adventures countless times. I read Race Against Time by Piers Anthony is a single morning, not daring to tear my eyes from its page. This library was my heaven.\n\nIII\n\nI am fortunate enough to work in a library. It is a library half-a-century in the making and it surrounds me on all sides for the better part of my days. There are more than a thousand books in this library, but I know where everyone of them is without even looking. But I look anyway. I look frequently, if for nothing else than the perspective the library provides.\n\nAfter a long programming session or during a stressful Teams meeting, I can turn my head to the left and look across the room to the top of a corner bookshelf. There I see a worn copy of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and I remember that a bug in program or a disagreement in a meeting is small potatoes. If I’m feeling a little low and need a pick-me-up, I can cross the room and pull an Andy Rooney volume off the shelf. In minutes, I’ll be laughing. When I am overwhelmed, I’ll turn to E.B. White’s One Man’s Meat. A page or two, sometimes a sentence or two is often enough to steady my heart. This library is my sanctuary.\n\nIV\n\nWhat is the opposite of a nightmare? The closest I’ve come is the dream in which I spent the night in the main branch of the New York Public Library–what is known as the Stephen A. Schwartzman Building.\n\nWhat is the opposite of a haunted house? Because there are ghosts in this library. At first I just hear their muted whispers as I wander the stacks, my fingers trailing along the spines of a million books, here a translation of Horace, here a Harlquin romance novel, here Doris Kearns Goodwin’s Wait Till Next Year, here a tattered copy of the February 26, 1966 New Yorker containing E. B. White’s essay “Mr. Forbush’s Friends.” Then I realize the sound are coming from the reading room and I make my way into that great hall.\n\nIt is full of apparitions, whispering so as not to disturb the readers. There is Sam Clemons. Over there is Edward Gibbon chatting with Winston Churchill. Seated around a table stacked with science fiction paperbacks, Isaac Asimov is chatting with L. Sprague de Camp and Robert Heinlein. David McCullough is pestering John Quincy Adams, who looks just as cranky as he seems in his journals.. They are here, all of them, forever part of the books and articles and letters and journals that they produced. If you listen carefully, you too can hear them as you wander the stacks. This library is my fantasy.\n\nV\n\nI mourn all of the books I will never get to read for lack of time. I mourn all the books no one today will get to read because they no longer exist. I am envious of all of those long gone souls who visited the Great Library of Alexandria to explore its treasures. What great works of art and science and history and literature were lost there, never to be seen again. This library is my sorrow.\n\nVI\n\nThe ultimate library for my is the Library of Trantor from Isaac Asimov’s Foundation books. I often dream of wandering those endless stacks and corridors. Instead of the collected knowledge, wisdom, and art of a single world, here we have the knowledge, wisdom, and art of a million worlds.\n\nThat short book, The Nine Planets, from the Franklin Township library all those years ago had a huge scope: the entire history of our solar system. Zoom into a single planet with that solar system, and look at that world’s history. Will Durant’s 11-volume Story of Civilization covers the human side of the story in a mere 13,500 pages. Settle on a single person in that history, say Leonardo da Vinci. Walter Isaacson has written a fascinating biography that brought the man to life for me. da Vinci produced thousands of pages of notes and drawings in his notebooks over his life. Mark Kurlansky has written an excellent history, Paper, on which all of these books were written.\n\nWhen I wander the Library of Trantor, I imagine following threads like this for worlds I’ve never heard of. Who was their Napoleon? Their Mozart? Their Moses?\n\nWhat makes this Library truly special is that I imagine that somewhere, a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, such a library existed, may still exist. That library is my hope.\n\nNotes\n\nI’ve written about The Nine Planets many times before, but my favorite piece is one I wrote on how a single book can shape a life: Book Banning: An Alternate History.\n\nShoeless Joe by W.P. Kinsella. The movie version of the book is Field of Dreams, a good film. But the book is still better.\n\n“I pulled open the doors of the Granada Hills branch of the Los Angeles Public Library…” For a great book on the Los Angeles Public Library, read Susan Orlean’s The Library Book.\n\nSomething Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury. This was one of the most incredible books I’d come across when I first read it in the fall of 1997. I often quote from the book in the fall, much to the dismay of my family, when October rolls around. “First of all it was October, a rare month for boys…”\n\nRace Against Time by Piers Anthony was the first of something like a hundred Piers Anthony books I read when I was young. At the time, I didn’t realize it was Piers Anthony. Today, when I think about that book, I sometimes confuse it in my mind with Philip K. Dick’s Time Out of Joint.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William Shirer. I made some notes on the book after reading it.\n\nOne Man’s Meat by E.B. White. This is one of my all-time favorite essay collections. As of this writing, I’ve read it six times.\n\nWait Till Next Year by Doris Kearns Goodwin. If you like baseball, you’ll enjoy this memoir of growing up as a Brooklyn Dodgers fan.\n\n“I am envious of all of those long gone souls who visited the Great Library of Alexandria…” There are some fun scenes and speculation in Jack McDevitt’s Time Traveler’s Never Die that take place in this library.\n\nThe Story of Civilization by Will and Ariel Durant. This is my desert island book. It is also an amusing study in scope creep.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci by Walter Isaacson. If you can manage it, get the hard cover edition. It is printed on high-quality paper and makes the art pop.\n\nPaper: Paging Through History by Mark Kurlansky.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.

Reading List\n\nLate last year, I set 3 goals for myself for 2023: (1) consolidate the apps that I use; (2) simplify; and (3) automate repetitive tasks.\n\nOne repetitive task I’ve been dealing with for decades is maintaining and publishing my reading list. I started keeping my reading list back in 1996 in order to track a goal that I’d set for myself: to read one book per week. Initially, the reading list was in a text file. That was followed by Excel, HTML on an early website, a SQL database, more HTML, a plain text file on GitHub, and most recently, a markdown file that I host through Obsidian Publish.\n\nNone of my “routine” tasks have proved more time-consuming than maintaining this list. Frequently, I update in one place, and then have to make similar updates in other places to keep everything in sync. If I could automate this, it would be a huge win. Recently, this is just what I have done.\n\nI created an Excel spreadsheet which is now my canonical master reading list. This is the only place I make updates. I wrote a Wolfram Language script that generates my reading list markdown file as well as a new reading stats page from the spreadsheet. I then simply publish the changes in Obsidian Publish, and presto! A single process for doing it all!\n\nYou can see the results on my reading list site. In addition to automatically generating the list, my script also produces the new Reading Stats page, which has all kinds of charts and visualizes of my reading over the decades, with more in the works. I no longer have to do this manually myself, and it has proven a big timesaver already.\n\nTo cap things off, I wrote a new About the List page, which gives the history of my reading list and provides an FAQ. Eventually, I’m looking to automate this further by having Wolfram Language detect when my reading list file is updated and automatically produce the updated files, and publish them.\n\nI’m pleased with this new process since it saves measurable amounts of time (considering how much I read and, therefore, how frequently I’m updating my list), which means more time for other things. Like writing more here on the blog.\n\nWritten on 6 May 2023.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.

(As of this writing, there are 1,241 books on the list.) Last spring, I tried to estimate how many books I read before I kept my list. I have been thinking about it more and more, and over the last few weeks, have been trying to remember the books I read beginning in kindergarten. As I remembered books, I scribbled them on a few pieces of notebook paper. To make it easier to remember, I divided the list into several sections: grade school, junior high school, high school, college, and 1994-1995.\n\nThe result is a list of books I read before 1996, which I have now published online along with my other reading lists. The list is not complete. I’d guess that I was able to recall about half of the books I actually read between 1977 and 1995. Other than being divided into the sections listed above, the books are in order I recalled them when trying to remember what I’d read. A lot of books I read in junior high school and college for classes have faded from my memory. A lot of books I read for fun remained. So while this list is not complete, it is a good representation of my reading in the years before 1996.\n\nAs I recall more books, I’ll add them to the list.\n\nWritten on 11 March 2023.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.

I was almost 24 years old, and I think the inspiration to keep a list came from a list I’d seen online by someone who’d been keeping the list since 1974. I lamented the fact that I’d missed tracking twenty-plus years of books I’d read. Yet when I finally began keeping the list, it was at a time when I decided to try reading a book a week. My list, I figured, would grow quickly. My list has taken various forms online over the years, but my “master” list is contained in a Leuchtturm1917 notebook where, at the moment, the 1,240 books I’ve read take up almost all of the first 60 pages.\n\nOver the weekend, the Littlest Miss discovered a stack of Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books on my bookshelf. She is 6-1/2, a very good reader, and she asked me about those books. I explained the concept of them to her, and she seemed excited by it. So much so, that she sat down Friday evening and read through one of them. Now, “reading through” a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book is not a linear process, but she seemed to attempt every possible permutation. She did it in a logic way, too. She told me that when she went back to the beginning, she’d skipped the parts she already read, and only read the new parts.\n\nShe finished the book that very evening. When she finished, she came up to me and asked if we could start her own list of books. I’d set aside a fresh Leuchtturm1917 notebook for this very purpose. We opened the wrapping on it together, and I explained to her my simple rules for keeping my list:\n\nOnly books I finish go on the list. I don’t track books I don’t finish. Too much work.\n\nEach finished book gets a number.\n\nIf I re-read a book, and finish it again, it goes on the list again with another number, but I also indicate it is a re-read with a ^ after the title.\n\nPaper, e-books, and audiobooks all count, so long as I finish them.\n\nTogether, we got her notebook setup. I told her that since it was her notebook and her list, she had to complete the list herself. She wrote the title on the cover (you can see it in the photo above). And then, on the first page of the book, she made her first entry. You can see both of our “first pages” in the image below.\n\nOver the weekend, the Littlest Miss completed 2 more Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books and her list has grown by two additional entries.\n\nI’m envious. If she can keep her list going, not only will she have a more extensive list than I ever had, but her list will reflect the evolution of her thinking and interests from an early age. It will mirror the evolution (and improvement) in her handwriting. And, much as my book list goes, it will act as a kind of memoir of her life. Through some quirk of memory, when I glance through my list, I can remember exactly where I was when I read a particular book on the list, even if I don’t remember the book all that well.\n\nIt’s been a delight to see how excited the Littlest Miss was by the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books, and also how excited she was to begin keeping her own list. I’ve already told her that she can use my list any time she wants if she is looking for ideas or recommendations. (All books that I’d recommend are indicated by a * in the margin of the page.) It is a journey we are now taking together.\n\nWritten on 26 February 2023.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.

This is actually the second draft of this post. The first draft came in at something over 2,500 words, and as I read it, I thought: No one wants to read this much other stuff. They just want the list. To that end, I’ve tried to cut this significantly.\n\nSummary of my reading in 2022\n\nI read 101 books in 2022, finally meeting my goal of 100 books again, after two consecutive years of falling short. 65 of the 101 books were nonfiction. I was surprised by this because my tendency these last few years has been heavily toward nonfiction. But I reread some old fiction series I’ve enjoyed in the past and that shifted the balance somewhat.\n\nMy 10 best reads of 2022\n\nA few notes before I get to the list:\n\nThese are the ten books I most enjoyed reading in 2022; they are not the the ten best books that debuted in 2022. The books on the list were published over a wide range of years, the earliest being 1970 with only 2 of the books on the list debuting in 2022.\n\nIn past years, I’ve listed the books as a countdown from 10 to 1. It seems to me this buries the lead and is an injustice to the books that I most enjoyed. This year, I’m listing them from my 1 to 10, and damn the suspense.\n\nHere, then, are my best reads of 2022:\n\n1. A Place to Read: Life and Books by Michael Cohen (2014)\n\nThis collection of essays by a former professor resonated strongly with me: the subjects, the style, the fact that we were both pilots. The book was an accidental discovery, a rare success for Amazon’s recommendation system. It is one of several books this year that convinced me that I want to be an essayist. It was my favorite read of 2022.\n\n2. Destiny of the Republic: A tale of madness, medicine and the murder of a president by Candice Millard (2011)\n\nI took a big lesson from Candice Millard’s Destiny of the Republic: that anyone rising to a position like that of President of the United States is worth reading about, even if they are not as well known (to me), anyway). James Garfield’s story was gripping, and Millard’s telling of it was wonderful, fascinating, and ultimately heartbreaking.\n\n3. This Living Hand: Essays, 1972-2012 by Edmund Morris (2012)\n\nThe essays in This Living Hand run the gamut of subjects, from biographical to autobiographical, big subjects and themes to small ones, like the value of handwriting, and what one can learn from it. I’d had mixed experiences with Edmund Morris in the past, greatly enjoying his 3-volume biography of Theodore Roosevelt, and perplexed by his unorthodox biography of Thomas Edison. But This Living Hand was a treasure to read, and another push toward wanting to write essays.\n\n4. Hell and Back by Craig Johnson (2022)\n\nHell and Back, the most recent installment in the Walt Longmire series (my favorite fiction series) supplanted the 7th book in the series, Hell is Empty as my favorite Longmire book. This is a different Longmire story, in tone as well as in the way it is told.\n\n5. The Man from the Future: The Visionary Life of John von Neumann by Ananyo Bhattacharya (2022)\n\nJohn von Neumann has come up frequently in my reading and from those incidental glances, I had the idea that he was a smart person even among smart people. I was delighted to find and read this new biography of von Neumann, The Man from the Future, and it convinced me that he was very likely the smartest person I have ever read about.\n\n6. Consider the Lobster and Other Essays by David Foster Wallace (2005)\n\nI’ve had Infinite Jest on my bookshelf for years, tempting me. Since I’d been reading a lot of essay collections this year, I thought I’d read some of Wallace’s essays first, and the first collection I read was Consider the Lobster and Other Essays. I was blown away by his writing, and came away awe-struck, and somewhat depressed. I don’t think I could ever write essays as well as Wallace did.\n\n7. Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality by Max Tegmark (2014)\n\nI came to Max Tegmark’s Our Mathematical Universe via James Gleick’s Chaos. I was immediately impressed by the scope, style, humor, and imagination that Tegmark put into the book. It was one of those reads that made me want to follow up with more, and I read his book, Life 3.0 as soon as I finished this one.\n\n8. The Passage of Power: The Years of Lyndon Johnson, Vol. 4 by Robert A. Caro (2012)\n\nThe 4th volume of Robert A. Caro’s biography of Lyndon Johnson, The Passage of Power turned out to be my favorite so far. The arc of Johnson’s career and his thrust into the presidency after the Kennedy assassination is a great illustration of how unique the job is, and how no career, no matter how stories, can really prepare someone for it.\n\n9. The Rising Sun: The Decline & Fall of the Japanese Empire, 1936-45 by John Toland (1970)\n\nI’ve read a lot of the history of the Second World War, but I’d never read a history that focuses primarily on Japan. This is exactly what The Rising Sun by John Toland does. There were five themes that I found particularly interesting in this book.\n\n10. The Diary of a Bookseller by Shaun Bythell (2018)\n\nNow and then I imagine what it might be like to own a used bookstore. After reading The Diary of a Bookseller by Shaun Bythell, I no longer have to imagine. This is a charming book about the owner of the largest used bookstore in Scotland, who has kept a diary about the day-to-day running of the shop. I enjoyed it so much that I followed it up with its sequel.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nIn addition to these best reads of the year, here are some other books I read this year worthy of mention:\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany by William L. Shirer. A masterpiece. Like many long histories, reading it made me want to know more about its author, and I followed it up with Shirer’s 3-volume autobiography.\n\nThe Joy of x: A Guided Tour of Math, from One to Infinity by Steven H. Strogatz. Every now and then, I enjoy a good book on mathematics.\n\nPhilosophy of Sailing: Offshore in Search of the Universe by Christian Williams. This was a wonderful read about a fellow who made a solo sailing journey from southern California to Hawaii and back.\n\nThe Church of Baseball: The Making of Bull Durham: Home Runs, Bad Calls, Crazy Fights, Big Swings, and a Hit by Ron Shelton. If you like baseball and movie-making, this one is for you.\n\nA Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books by Nicholas A. Basbanes. An absorbing book on the fascinating world of book collecting.\n\nRiver of Gods: Genius, Courage, Betrayal in the Search for the Source of the Nile by Candice Millard. A biography of Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke and the discovery of the source of the Nile river. It was this book that led me to Destiny of the Republic.\n\nThe Hopkins Touch: Harry Hopkins and the Forging of the Alliance to Defeat Hitler by David L. Roll. I’m fascinated by the “people behind the people,” and David Roll’s biography is of just such a person, Harry Hopkins.\n\nRemarkable Diaries: The World’s Greatest Diaries, Notebooks, and Letters Explored and Explained by DK Publishing. This was a fun book to flip through slowly before I went to sleep at night\n\nMadly, Deeply: The Diaries of Alan Rickman by Alan Rickman. One of my guilty pleasures is reading memoirs by or about entertainers. This one was unique in that it was the private diaries of Rickman, published posthumously.\n\nDisneyWar by James B. Stewart. A fascinating inside look at the Walt Disney Company during the rise and fall of Michael Eisner.\n\nI am aiming to read at least 100 books in 2023. It is always exciting to start out the year and wonder what will the best reads end up being? I’ll let you know a year from now. In the meantime, if you are interested here, are some past lists:\n\nMy best reads of 2021\n\nMy best reads of 2020\n\nMy best reads of 2019\n\nMy best reads of 2018\n\nWritten 26-31 December 2022.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.

I’ve started to prepare a list of what to read and few days ago, on Twitter, I asked for some recommendations:\n\nFor me, guilty-pleasure reading usually consists of biographies and memoirs about celebrities past, or histories of Hollywood and things like that. It occurred to me that when I asked for recommendations, I didn’t indicate those books that I’ve already read. To remedy that, I create a Guilty Pleasure Reading list on my reading list site listing all of the guilty-pleasure books I’ve read over the years. There, you can see all of the books I’ve read that fall into this category. I’ve included a section on my 5 favorites. And I’ve included links to some posts I’ve written about these books. Now, if you are wondering whether or not I have read a specific Hollywood bio, memoir, or history, you can go to this list and find out.\n\nSo far, for the end of the year, I’ve got the following books lined up:\n\nTied Up in Knotts: My Dad and Me by Karen Knotts\n\nAndy and Don: The Making of a Friendship and a Classic American TV Show by Daniel de Visé\n\nA Long Time Ago, in a Cutting Room Far, Far Away: My Fifty Years Editing Hollywood Hits by Paul Hirsch\n\nMadly, Deeply, the Diaries of Alan Rickman by Alan Rickman\n\nI can usually tackle 6-8 books during this break. If you’ve got other recommendations in this genre, please drop them in the comments. If there are really good, they may supplant the ones listed above.\n\nWritten on 21 November 2022.\n\nDid you enjoy this post?\n\nIf so, consider subscribing to the blog using the form below or clicking on the button below to follow the blog.
