        "text": "We are in the Kent village of Downe, home to Charles Darwin in his final years, in the last quarter of the 19th century, and we enter the minds of the villagers, in the parish church, in the pub, at the hearth: \"Jennifer, my aunt, uses onion milk and Beecham's Pills to cure people. What ho! Sickly people. Patients get better if it is meant to be. I use stronger stuff, but it's the same thing. Science medicates and nature tends.\"\n\nThat's the village doctor speaking. We get to know quite a bit about him: why he drinks, for example. A host of villagers are ventriloquised: various do-gooders, the people who scorn the do-gooders, the grocer, the publican, even a reading group, including the wonderfully bubble-headed Mary Kenny, who fantasises about the novel she will write: \"My reader is certain to be an educated woman. She won't put the book down just because the author's name is still unknown. No, she will leaf through the pages, taking care not to bend them. I am going to demand a proper binding, so that people can read the book in bed comfortably. On the other hand, if my reader were to start reading at night, perhaps she would not be able to stop and go to sleep. I will begin writing really quite soon.\"\n\nI quote at length because to cut out bits would do the prose an injustice. Look at the progression of the train of thought, the attention to detail, like needlepoint (there is quite a bit of sewing in the novel; \"pity is a thread of heaven's mercy in a human,\" goes one moving line); and then laugh at the way this thought process is beautifully derailed by that \"I will begin writing really quite soon,\" in which the idle and vain internal voice of every single would-be author is held up to gentle mockery.\n\nAnd it really is gentle. The author who kept coming back to me as I read this is James Joyce, but please, do not take fright and bolt at the mention of that name. The multitude of voices in this book may bring dim, nightmarish associations with Finnegans Wake to mind, but this is really not a difficult book at all. (The typically guileless mini-introduction, which graces all Peirene books, says: \"This is no page-turner, but a story to be inhabited, to be savoured slowly.\" But I read it at a decent clip.)\n\nThere is another aspect of Joyce that this novel shares, an aspect that some people forget: that of tender inclusivity, of sympathy and understanding. (I also caught a whiff, in the second chapter, as the congregation is eavesdropped upon, of Christopher Smart's religious poem \"Jubilate Agno\".) \"They are not good people and they are not bad people. They shift their feet in the slush, ashamed and abashed.\" You will, incidentally, note Carlson's gift for the arresting juxtaposition, which is one of the many things which gives the novel its savour.\n\nThe void at the centre of the book is Darwin, who is never ventriloquised: he is as present, and as absent, as God. It is as if the thoughts of the villagers are his dream: they wrestle with their faith, or lack of it. Darwin's very presence in the village seems to radiate a field of doubt, and change, like electricity – the harbinger of modernity, as we are reminded here. It is a book of hints, of evasiveness, as much as it is one of human warmth. (And, as I hope I have made clear, not devoid of humour.)\n\nThe extraordinary thing is that this was written by a Finn. I know they are clever, but how Carlson, writing in 2009, got so closely into the collective mind of an English village circa 1880 is something miraculous. The translation, by a mother-and-daughter team, Emily and Fleur Jeremiah, captures not only the poetry but the nuances of our language (eg the difference between someone who says \"what ho!\" and someone who says \"BALDERDASH\"), and makes it hard to believe this novel originated in another country. But it did, and the way Carlson shows us to ourselves should make us wonder."
