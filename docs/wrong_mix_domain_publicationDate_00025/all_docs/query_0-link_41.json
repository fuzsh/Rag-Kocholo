        "text": "NPS administrative histories look at the history of federal parks and the National Park Service as public programs and as a public trust. They analyze individual parks and their establishment and administration, as well as NPS programs and policies.\n\nAs a government agency, the NPS has reflected and participated in national discussions about the environment and its relationship to society. Parks provide specific evidence about the history of conservation and management of natural resources and about the economic, ecological, and aesthetic dimensions of the public lands. Parks illuminate changes in the very concept of nature and wilderness, the economic interests involved in the setting aside and development of public lands, and ways Americans experience nature and wilderness in shifting patterns of tourism and recreation.\n\nPark managers bear significant responsibilities for decisions about park resources that affect how future generations will see this multifaceted natural and cultural heritage. Administrative histories inform them about the decision-making of their predecessors in the NPS, and about how NPS decisions have reflected and reflect broader social, economic, cultural, and political trends and interests.\n\nTo learn more about NPS administrative histories visit the Administrative History Program webpage on the new Park History Program website\n\nAdministrative History Guide (pdf)\n\nFiling Scheme of National Park Service (1953) (pdf)\n\nInventory of the Records of the National Park Service Record Group 79 (2007) (pdf)\n\nNational Archives Library Resources for Administrative History\n\nNational Park Service Archives and Research\n\nNational Park Service Records in the National Archives\n\nThe following is a list of reports, articles, and books constituting or including administrative histories, partial administrative histories, or significant administrative history data for particular parks.
