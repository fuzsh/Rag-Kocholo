        "text": "Darwin's Children\n\nby Greg Bear\n\n387pp, HarperCollins, £17.99\n\nFor Stephen Jay Gould, fiction reaches those parts that science cannot. A great fan of fellow palaeontologist Björn Kurtén's novels, Gould admired the way he used fiction to put flesh on the bones of his more speculative scientific theories. In Darwin's Children, Greg Bear ventures deep into territory where most scientists fear to tread. In this meticulously researched novel, the frontier of empirical science is also the threshold of imagination and the beginning of our evolutionary future.\n\nAccording to Bear, we are entering \"the Virus Century\". From Frankenstein to Brave New World, novels have predicted the disastrous consequences of man meddling with biology. But in Darwin's Children it is mother nature herself who wreaks biological havoc. Almost a third of the human genome is made up of endogenous retroviruses, \"the genetic fossils of ancient diseases\". In his Nebula award-winning Darwin's Radio (1999), to which this is the sequel, Bear spun a convincing yarn in which this usually harmless \"genetic garbage\" suddenly became reactivated, unleashing an \"invader from humanity's past\" called Sheva: Scattered Human Endogenous Viral Activation. This virus caused miscarriages, but the nightmare didn't stop there. The retrovirus was a \"genetic messenger, ferrying complicated instructions for a new kind of birth\". The miscarriages were not viable foetuses at all, but specialised ovaries that implanted a fertilised reproductive cell before aborting. Then, as if by miracle, the women became pregnant again: \"Sheva infected recently fertilized human eggs - in a sense, hijacked them.\"\n\nBut what are the children born from this ancient virus: \"a diseased mutation, a subspecies, or a completely new species\"? Are they \"GM Kids\" created by a modern Dr Frankenstein? Molecular biologist Kaye Lang, who wants to prove a controversial theory of virus-based evolution, argues that \"viruses are part of the arsenal of communications our cells and bodies use to talk\". In Darwin's Radio, Kaye made the ultimate scientific leap of faith: she used her own body as a laboratory and gave birth to a Sheva child, called Stella Nova.\n\nThe \"Shevites\" are certainly different. They're born talking, with tongues that allow them to say two things at once. They are acutely sensitive to smells and use pheromones to influence people's behaviour. Gold and brown skin dapples (melanophores) on their faces signal mood changes, called \"sparking\". Communication is their forte: biologically they're suited to hive-like communities.\n\nThe question Bear now poses in Darwin's Children is how society would react to the birth of a new species. Not very well, is the short answer. The novel begins after 10 years of emergency action: authoritarian security measures taken to isolate and study the \"virus children\", like specimens in a zoo. Kaye and her palaeontologist partner, Mitch, are on the run, desperately moving from one safe house to another, delaying the inevitable: the moment when their daughter will be taken from them. Ignorance makes American society treat the Shevites inhumanely: \"we've created a new and vulnerable underclass, with fewer civil protections than any since slavery\". The amalgam of politics, big business and science is a dangerous one and Bear has a healthy scepticism towards the motives of all involved. The future that Darwin's Children brings vividly alive is a disturbingly familiar land. As a politician comments: \"All it takes to get elected in 21st-century America is a mob of frightened sheep and a wolf with a nice smile.\"\n\nAt the age of 11, Stella shocked her parents by telling them \"I am not like you ... not human!\" Even Mitch is forced to admit that his own daughter scares him when he finally meets her again after she has spent four years locked up in a state school. But at the heart of Bear's thought-provoking novel is Mitch and Kaye's struggle to prove scientifically that not only is their daughter human, but that she is the result of an ancient evolutionary process. Bear has written a gripping evolutionary thriller that combines cutting-edge science with a compelling storyline. It's a novel that stretches the envelope of known science - which is exactly what science fiction should do.\n\nPD Smith's illustrated biography of Einstein is published by Haus."
