William Tuff Whiteway was an architect.

He lived at 1949 Barclay Street from 1905 to 1907 and at 1958 Barclay Street from 1908 to 1916. (His wife, Ada, lived at 1958 Barclay Street until 1958).

He designed buildings in St. John’s Newfoundland; Halifax, Nova Scotia; Victoria, British Columbia; Port Townsend, Washington; Vancouver, British Columbia; and several places elsewhere in British Columbia.

Early Life in Eastern Canada

William Tuff Whiteway was born in Musgrave Harbour, Newfoundland. (Musgrave Harbour’s earlier name was “Muddy Hole.”) Various sources give William’s birthdate as April 1, 1857 or April 30, 1859.

William’s parents were Robert Whiteway (1818-1875) and Ann (“Annie”) Tuff (1824-1908). Robert and Annie were married on May 19, 1842.

Robert Whiteway died in St. John’s, Newfoundland, on September 2, 1875.

Annie died in St. John’s on February 4, 1908.

William worked in Newfoundland, sometimes as a carpenter and builder.

Western North America and First Marriage

By the early 1880s, William had moved to British Columbia, where he continued to work as a carpenter.

On March 5, 1884, in Victoria, William married Lizzie (Elizabeth) Sketchley. She was born in England about 1858. (Her full name may have been Barbara Elizabeth Sketchley.) Lizzie’s parents were William Sketchley and Elizabeth Sibson.

About 1886, William and Lizzie moved to Vancouver. The 1887 Vancouver directory described William as an architect.

In 1888, William was an architect in Port Townsend, Washington, practising with Julius C. Schroeder.

In the spring of 1888, William and Lizzie went to live in San Diego, California.

Lizzie died in San Diego on June 8, 1888. She was buried in Mount Hope Cemetery in San Diego.

William later returned to eastern Canada, where he worked as an architect.

Marriage to Ada Croft

By 1900, William was back in British Columbia. On January 6, 1900, in New Westminster, he married Ada Croft. She was born on January 18, 1871, in Stamford Bridge, England. Her parents were Christopher Croft (1841-1932) and Sarah (1848-1925). (Sarah’s surname may have been Poulton.)

The Croft family emigrated from England to Canada in 1892.

In 1901 and 1906, Ada’s parents, Christopher and Sarah, lived in the Gainsborough area of Assiniboia East in the Northwest Territories. (After the 1905 creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan from part of the Northwest Territories, Gainsborough was in southeastern Saskatchewan.)

By 1911, Christopher and Sarah were back in England. Sarah died in Thirsk, Yorkshire in 1925. Christopher died in Thirsk in 1932.

William and Ada in Vancouver

From 1900 to 1940, William and Ada lived at the following addresses in Vancouver.

William and Ada often lived apart and it appears that they eventually divorced. (William’s death certificate indicated that he was divorced. Ada’s death certificate stated that she was widowed.)

William’s architectural practice was extensive. He designed schools, fire halls, apartment buildings, and office buildings. One of his more famous projects was the World Building, commonly known as the Sun Tower.

There is controversy about who designed the World Building. According to some sources, George Lister Thornton Sharp (1880-1974) (https://westendvancouver.wordpress.com/biographies-n-z/biographies-s/sharp-george-lister-thornton-1880-1974/) claimed that he made the first sketches. In any case, the notion of having a narrow tower on top of a shorter, wider building was not unusual. The Singer Building (1908) and the Woolworth Building (1910-1912), both in New York City, were larger examples of the same concept. The Smith Tower in Seattle (1910-1914) was closer to the scale of the World Building.

In 1915 William was a candidate to become Vancouver’s mayor. He was not a serious candidate, however, and it appears that he was really in the race to ensure that Louis (“L.D.”) Taylor would win a controversial election.

William received only a few votes, and L.D. Taylor became the mayor.

William continued his architecture practice. From 1923 to the late 1930s he lived in a series of apartments in downtown Vancouver.

In 1930, Ada was in Seattle, Washington, along with her two sons, Gordon and Wilfred. (The 1930 United States census described Ada as a widow.) She returned to Vancouver, and from 1933 to 1958 she lived at 1958 Barclay Street.

By 1938, William was also at 1958 Barclay Street, although the Vancouver directory described Ada as the home-owner. William was only residing there.

William died in Vancouver on October 9, 1940.

Ada died in Vancouver on May 19, 1958.

William and Lizzie Sketchley had the following children.

Nora Ethel Whiteway

Nora Ethel Whiteway was born in Victoria, British Columbia, on December 18, 1884.

In 1901 she was living with her parents in Vancouver.

On December 27, 1906, in Vancouver, she married James Walter Warren, who was a miner. He was born in Goldenville, Nova Scotia, on May 18, 1878. His parents were James Warren and Ellen Glencross.

James later worked as a crane operator in a ship yard.

Nora died in Essondale, British Columbia, on June 7, 1940. She was buried in Ocean View Burial Park in Burnaby, British Columbia.

James died in New Westminster, British Columbia, on January 17, 1957. He was buried in Ocean View Burial Park in Burnaby.

Lillian (“Lily”) Stafford Whiteway

Lillian (“Lily”) Stafford Whiteway was born in British Columbia on June 7, 1885 (or June 27, 1886), possibly in Victoria.

She married Richard Samuel Morrison in Portland, Oregon, on January 27, 1908.

In 1910, Lily and Richard were living in Seattle, Washington. In 1921 they were in Vancouver.

In 1940 and 1958, Lily was living in San Francisco, California.

Lily died in San Francisco on February 19, 1965.

Frank Sketchley Whiteway

Frank Sketchley Whiteway was born in San Diego, California, on May 20, 1888.

In 1895 he travelled with his father from Newfoundland to Nova Scotia.

In 1901 he was living with his parents in Vancouver.

In 1908 he married Edith R. Hoagland in Clarke County, Washington.

In 1918 he registered with the United States military system. He was living in San Francisco.

It appears that he was living in in Tucson, Arizona in 1940.

In 1958 he appeared in the Nevada marriage index. He was married to Marion T. Scott.

He died in Los Angeles, California on March 6, 1972.

William and Ada Croft had the following children.

William Gordon Whiteway

William Gordon Whiteway was born in Whatcom County, Washington on July 24, 1900, probably in Bellingham. (Some sources give his birthdate as September 15, 1901, or September 1902.)

In 1901, 1911 and 1921 he was living with his parents in Vancouver.

In 1930 he was with his mother in Seattle, Washington.

On March 21, 1936, in Seattle, he married Grace V. Collins.

He died in Vancouver on September 30, 1959.

Wilfred Ewart Whiteway

Wilfred Ewart Whiteway was born in Vancouver on September 12, 1910 (some sources say 1911).

In 1911 and 1921 he was living with his parents in Vancouver.

In 1930 he was with his mother in Seattle, Washington.

He did not marry.

He died at New Vista Care Facility in Burnaby, British Columbia on December 14, 1987. He was buried in Forest Lawn Burial Park in Burnaby. (His death registration indicated that had been living with mental retardation all of his life.)
