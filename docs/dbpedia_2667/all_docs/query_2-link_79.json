        "text": "Notes. This poem is an early example of what would become a common theme in the libels of 1627-28: the belief that only the (perhaps violent) removal of Buckingham (“Dux”—Duke) from power can reunite Charles (“Rex”—king) with his subjects (“Grex”—the people) inside and outside parliament. Different sources date the poem at either 1627 or 1628, but both William Whiteway (CUL MS Dd.11.73) and William Davenport received their copies in 1627, Davenport noting by his transcription that the verse had been “pinned uppon the Court gates Maye 1627” (CCRO MS CR 63/2/19, fol. 58r). The final two lines of the version selected here are unusual, if not unique; most versions are only eight lines in length.\n\n“On the Duke”\n\nRex & grex are both of a sound,\n\nBut Dux doth Rex & Grex confound.\n\nIf Crux1 of Dux might have his fill,\n\nThen Rex with grex might worke his will:\n\nThree Subsidies to five would turne,2\n\n5\n\nAnd grex would laugh, that now doth mourne.\n\nO Rex, thy grex doth sore complaine,\n\nThat Dux hath Crux, and crux not Dux againe3\n\nBut now it is the praier of thy poore Grex,\n\nThat vivat Rex, on Dux may currat Lex.4\n\n10\n\nSource.

The meaning here seems to be that if the duke (“Dux”) is punished/destroyed (put on the cross; made to suffer the cross or a cross/setback), then king and people (“Rex” and “Grex”) can work together again. <back>\n\n2 Three Subsidies to five would turne: variant sources inflate the figures to five and ten, respectively. The essential point remains the same: with Buckingham gone, Charles can expect a more generous parliament. <back>\n\n3 That Dux...againe: that the Duke has the power to punish but is not subject to punishment. <back>"
