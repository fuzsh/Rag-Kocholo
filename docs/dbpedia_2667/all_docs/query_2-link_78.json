        "text": "Sir Alfred Tregos Butler debated with Joseph Bartlett work on the accuracy of the ancestry of Thomas Newberry. Butler back in the early 1900's assisted on writing the Burke's Peerage which deals with royal ancestral lineages. In the 1920's Alfred Butler of the College of Arms eventually convinced Mr. Joseph Bartlett to ammend his findings. He died before he could finish his work. It is said that buildings which held these old wills that Bartlett found were destroyed in WWII but they are in the book.\n\nGo here for details: http://www.rootschat.com/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=iusqjft8tgu32sj0cidamo7di0&topic=110257.15http://www.rootschat.com/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=iusqjft8tgu32sj0cidamo7di0&topic=110257.15\n\nJoseph Gardner Bartlett gives details on the origin of Thomas Newberry and Family.\n\nIt comes directly from:\n\nThe Ancestors and Descendants of Thomas Newberry of Dorchester, Norfolk, Massachusetts, Author: Bartlett, Joseph Gardner, Publication: Private by J. Gardner Bartlett, Boston MA 1914.\n\nP. 36: On 17 Apr 1634 Thomas Newburgh of Marthwood Vale and many others set saile on the ship Mary and John from Walmouth towards New England. Per the diary of William Whiteway of Dorchester, co. Dorset, England who was an associate of Rev. John White, (Rev. Walter Newburgh, cousin of Thomas Newberry, and many others, in the company of Dorchester Adventurers, whose operations in connection with New England culminated in the sailing from Plymouth, England in March 1630 of the ship Mary and John with a party of colonists from Somerset, Dorset and Devon who founded Dorchester, MA.)The original diary of William Whiteway is preserved in the Manuscript Dept. of the British Museum, London and extends from 1618 to 1634. It mentions several meetings of the Dorchester Adventurers. Dorchester records, printed vol., p.7: Mr. Newberry, (from the English parish of Marshwood Vale in Dorsetshire), shall have 30 acres. It is ordered that Mr. Newbery is to have for his purchase that he bought of Mr. Pincheon, the house Mr. Pincheon build, 40 acs. of upland ground to the house, 40 acres of marsh, 20 acres in Quantq necke.\n\npp. 26, 40: Israel Stoughton, who made this inventor of the estate of Thomas Newberry, was a brother of Rev. John Stoughton, D. D., of London who married about 1635 Mrs. Jane (Browne) Newburgh, widow of Rev. Walter Newburgh of Symondsbury, co., Dorset, the latter being a cousin of Thomas Newberry. (Israel Stoughton is mentioned on page 38). Page 26 mentions that Israel Stoughton was the neighbor of Thomas Newberry\n\nRev. Walter Newburgh’s father Gen. Walter Newburgh (c.1555-1598/99) appears to be the uncle of Thomas Newberry who’s father is Richard Newberry Jr. (1568-c.1629), son of Richard Newberry Sr. (1517-1568).\n\npp. 44-45: Sarah Newberry b.c. 1622 married Hon. Henry Wolcott on November 18, 141 in Windsor, Hartford Co., Connecticut. Their son Henry Wolcott b. Jan 6, 1642/43 in Windsor, CT d. Feb. 18, 1700/01 in Windsor dealt with the Newberry family in England. This Henry Wolcott succeeded to all his father’s estates in England which during some time were managed for him by his second-cousin John Newberry of Chardstock, co., Dorset (son of Henry Newberry of Yarcombe, co., Devon, and grandson of Robert Newberry of Yarcombe, the latter being a brother of Thomas Newberry the founder of the family in America.)\n\nThe Connecticut Historical Society has several letters written to Henry Wolcott by John Newberry of Chardstock, who terms Wolcott “loving cozen”. In one letter dated at Chardstock, 2 Mar 1686/87, John Newberry states “Allso the last yeare I did desire you for it to geet it sartyfied under the seckatarys hand And the ministers hand that Cozin bengiment Newbery was still lifefind if hee ware so, for grandfather Newbry hold a lifeung by his life, and the lord forsoth hime to prove the life Alive”. In another letter dated 29 Sept. 1687, John Newberry stated: “I desired you severall tymes to geet it Atested under the ministers hand or under the secketaryes of the Court that Coezen bengimen Newbery Is still living, but you do not do it Acording to the law for us now it plesed god to tack Away my grandfather the 22th of August last past in ano 1687”*\n\n*The writer’s grandfather, Robert Newberry, was buried at Yarcombe, co., Devon, 25 Aug. 1687.\n\npp. 47-50: On 20 Dec 1675, Joseph Newberry of Marshwood, co. Dorset, yeoman, administrator of the nuncupative will of Anne Gibbs of Marshwood, widow, deceased, (after the refusal of Samuel Chapell the executor named therein), said Anne being executrix of the will of her husband Anthony Gibbs of Marshwood, gent., deceased, who was executor of the will of Christopher Dabinett of Upway co., Dorset, deceased, complains that said Christopher Dabinett possessed an estate of about $2000, and on 1 July 1637 made his will giving bequests as follows: to his daughter the said Ann Gibbs, then wife of said Anthony Gibbs, $50; to John Samuel, Gideon, Benjamin, and Sarah Haine (being children of his dau. Ralim Haine and her husband Morgan Haine) $100 each, and if any of them died before marriage or age of twenty-one, the portions of the deceased to redound to the survivors; to complainant Joseph Newberry and his brothers and sister Benjamin, John, Sarah, and Mary Newberry (being children of another daughter Joane Newberry, wife of Thomas Newberry), $50 each, to be paid unto them at such convenient times as the should give releases therefore; to said Morgan Haine $5 per year for life out of testator’s farm at Upway, and also $10; and to said Anthony Gibbs $50; and all residue to said Anthony Gibbs as executor in trust for the aforesaid children. Said will remains in the Registry of Prerogative Court of Canterbury. Said testator Dabinett soon after died, and said Anthony Gibbs probated the will and possessed himself of the estate as executor in trust, and duly paid the particular legacies required by the will for which he took receipts, and held the remainder of the estate as trustee for the benefit of all the grandchildren above mentioned (except for Benjamin Haine who soon died under age). Said Christopher Dabinett possessed a leasehold estate in Marshwood called Coweleaze worth $20 per year for the residue of a term ninety-nine years determinable on the lives of complainant and his brother Benjamin Newberry, under a rent to Lord Pawlett of Hinton St. George, co. Somerset, which said Gibbs held for some time and then yielded up to your orator afterwards enjoyed during the life of said Gibbs. Said Gideon Haine received his legacy of $100, and out of the residuary estate received $50 to apprentice him and $20 while an apprentice, and when of age $250 to get him up in business. Later, in pursuance of said trust, said Gideon Haine received certain lands in Whitchurch worth $300, when he gave receipt in full for his portion having received full more than his share of the residuary estate. Soon after, said Gideon Haine went to Ireland with his family where he lived some years and wasted his estate; but in 1665 he returned to England and by threats coerced said Gibbs to give him [torn] pounds in money; an estate in Whitchurch and house room and diet for himself and family, gratis, in the house of said Gibbs as long as the latter lived; said Haine then again signed a release of all claim to his grandfather’s estate. So said Gideon Haine has received in all over $1000 which is much more than his share in said Dabinett’s estate. Said Gibbs held of his own right two estates in Marshwood, one called Shave worth $15 per year, which he bought of one John Crabb, and one called Pitts worth $17 per year, which he bought of one Robt. Woodcock. Said Gibbs made his will 24 Sept. 1669, giving small money legacies to children of his brother John Gibbs, and all residue to his wife whom he made executrix, said will remaining in the registry of the Bishop of Bristol; afterwards said Gibbs died and his widow being then sick proved said will in the court of the Bishop of Bristol, and a few days later the residue in May 1670 she made her nuncupative will (conceiving herself entitled to the residue of the term in Coweleaze as executrix of her husband the executor of Christopher Dabinett, as well as to her husband’s own estate), and to willed to complainant, her nephew, the hithermost part of Coweleazenext the Barton, and to your orator’s brother in New England, meaning said Benjamin Newberry, the furthermost part of Coweleaze, and to others certain small bequests, and made Samuel Chapple (meaning an infant son of John Chappele of Upway), her executor, and soon died, leaving an estate of at least $1000. Said executor not acting, complainant has been made administrator of said will by the P.C.C. But said Gideon Haine attempted to suppress nuncupative will, and being in the house at the death of said Gibbs and his wife, he seized all their goods, claiming he had not received his share of his grandfather’s estate; and also possessed himself of all the deeds and papers of the said Gibbs and the discharges of the legatees including the receipts he gave himself. He also claims the estates called Coweleaze, Shave, and Pitts. Complainant as administrator of said Anne is entitled to all the documents, and also as principal legatee, to what is left of his grandfather’s estate, being principally the lease of Coweleaze. Your orator can get no relief in the common law as the evidence are in the possession of defendant, so prays a summons to be directed to said Gideon Haine to answer and produce the papers before the court in equity.\n\n(Chancery Proceedings, Six Clerks Series, Collins 546-48).\n\nGideon Hayne, defendant to Bill of complainant of Joseph Newberry, states the Christopher Dabinett of Upway, co. Dorset, yeoman, deceased, was seized in his life time about thirty-eight years ago of an estate of $6000 at least, and on 1 July 1637 made his will giving to his daughter Ann Gibbs, then wife of Anthony Gibbs, $50, and John Haine (now deceased), this defendant Gideon Hayne, Benjamin Haine (who died a minor to when this defendant was an administrator), and Sarah Haine (now deceased), (being children of Morgan Haine and Ralim his wife deceased, another daughter of testator), $100 each to be paid them within one half year of testator’s decease, with this declaration therein contained, that if any should die before marriage or age of twenty-one, the rest should inherit the shares of the deceased ones by the consent of his executor in trust; also he gave to complainant Joseph Newberry, and to Benjamin, John, Sarah, and Mary Newberry (all children of Thomas Newberry and Joane his wife deceased, another daughter of said testator), $50 each, to be paid when they were of age and could give a legal discharge therefore to his executor; also he gave to said Morgan Hayne $10, and $5 per year out of the farm in Upway; to Anthony Gibbs $50, and all residue of his estate to said Anthony Gibbs, executor in trust for the children of said Morgan Haine and Ralim his wife, as the defendant doubteth not to prove. Said will remains in the Registry of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. Defendant believes it to be true of the said Gibbs paid the Newberry bequests and took receipts therefore. Defendant believes executor paid legacies to some of the Haine grandchildren and took no receipts therefore, as the will did not require it. All the Haines grandchildren are dead except defendant who is their heir. It is true said Anthony Gibbs possessed himself of a farm in Upway of said Dabinett’s of yearly value of $80, and enjoyed same over twenty-four years until the death of said Morgan Haine, and also sold other estates for which he should account, and also possessed himself of a farm in Marshwood called Coweleaze which by right belongs to this defendant. Said Gibbs before the death of Dabbinet had but a small estate of $40 to $50 per year, but on the death of Dabbinet got control of his estate of $7000, the overplus of which belongs to this defendant as sole survivor of the children of said Ralim Hayne for whom Gibbs was trustee. Defendant received from Gibbes various sums for which he gave receipts, but no general acquittance for full settlement of all claim on his grandfather’s estate. Defendant went to Ireland as stated where he was a merchant for some years, and then returned to England. Said Gibbes bought two estates in Marshwood, called Shave and Pitts, with money of said Dabinett’s estate. Gibbs did not settle with his defendant who sued him in this court, and this defendant stopped suit on agreement that Gibbes should take him and his family to live with him and on the death of Gibbes and his wife this defendant should inherit the estate, and said defendant and his family lived with Gibbes and his wife until they died. And after the death of Gibbes, one Robert Newberry, gent., uncle to complainant, desired defendant to lend unto him the lease of the farm called Coweleaze and John Crabb’s assignment of Shave tenement to Anthony Gibbes, that he might have the advice of Thomas Plucknett, gent., an attorney, concerning them, promising to return them the next day at his then dwelling house. Instead, he gave them to his nephew the complainant who, defendant has heard, has assigned all claim to his grandfather’s estate to his solicitor, one Joseph Ring, saying with oaths and curses if can only ruin the defendant he doth not care if he and his family become beggars for their bread. When defendant was arrested on this suit in September last, said Ring told him he would keep him in jail the rest of his life by means of an execution they got against him in the last assizes for $110, on which account defendant is still a prisoner. Defendant claims claims Anthony Gibbs bought Shaves and Pitts in Marshwood with money of Dabinett’s estate, and not his own. When Gibbs made his will (unknown to defendant), he and his wife were both on their death-bed together, and died three days later. After the death of said Anne Gibbs, Mary Crabb, widow, and others next of kin to said Anthony Gibbs and Anne his wife, secured administration on their estates to seize them. Later, the complainant, by advice of his solicitor Joseph Ring, sets up a false nuncupative will of said Anne Gibbs, making said complainant principal legatee and one Samuel Chapple, an infant, her executor, whose father, a substantial and able man, refuses to act for him, stating said Anne was not of sound mind when said purported will was made. But said complainant having secured administration on said will, seized the estates and brought an action against defendant in the Kings Bench at the last Assizes, which he lost; Lord Chief Justice North declaring the estates in question belonged to this defendant. Complainant now seeks merely to vex defendant on same matters in other courts. Defendant denies he received $1000 from Gibbs, and hopes to be rewarded the residuary estate to which he is entitled. Defendant denies he has destroyed any receipts or documents, but will prove to this court the leases of Shave and Pitts and any other document he has when ordered. Answer sworn at Dorchester, co., Dorset, 19 Jan. 27 Charles II. [1675/6].\n\n(Chancery Proceedings, Six Clerks Series, Collins 59-59),\n\nThe decision in the above lawsuit has not been ascertained; but evidently not long afterwards the residue of the term of the lease of “Coweleaze” was secured, probably by purchase, by Robert Newberry of Yarcombe, uncle of Joseph and Benjamin Newberry, the lease enduring for the lives of the two brothers. It is likely that Joseph Newberry died before 1686 when John Newberry of Chardstock (grandson of Robert Newberry of Yarcombe) wrote in behalf of his grandfather Henry Wolcott of Windsor, Conn., for a certificate that Benjamin Newberry was living, in order “to prove the life alive”."
