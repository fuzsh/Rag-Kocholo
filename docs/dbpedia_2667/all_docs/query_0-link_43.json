Passing over the earlier descents we come to the following line of descent:-\n\nNote:- The following account is based on information Burke's listing and given in Hutchins Pedigree of the Family, supported by information given in the 1623 and 1677 Visitations of Dorset, the Oxford and Cambridge Alumni, and many other sources most of which I have listed in the genealogical notes provided at the end .\n\n1. John CHURCHILL (1512-1557) Esq of Dorchester, a clothier (draper) by trade was born about 1512(1.12) during the reign of Henry VIII. He was elected Bailiff of Dorchester for the years(1.12) 1540/1, 1544/5, 1546/7 and 1548/9. He married about 1540 to Edith BOND (b circa 1519) daughter of William BOND of Herringston and Lutton, Dorset by his wife Elizabeth nee Prowz of Bridy. 'Lutton' was the largest farm within the parish of Steeple on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset. This was the period of the 'Reformation' when all the Religious houses and chantries were abolished and the official religion changed from Catholic to Protestant. Some families did well out of the reformation and in 1549 John Churchill acquired part of the property of the dissolved Hospital of St John the Baptist in Dorchester (1.12); some he sold (e.g.Charter 616) , but on part of it on the edge of town he built the first house at 'Colleton' [Colliton]. We know from charter 618 that he also owned property on the North side of Pease Lane. He died between 15th April and 25th August 1557. From his will we know he had a brother Rowland Churchill and that he was survived by three children William, John and Elizabeth. His son John was under the age of 21 in 1557 and was the younger of his sons as William Churchill (1541-1602) inherited half his estate the other half being bequeathed to his mother Edith. John Churchill's will dated 15th April 1557 was proved on 25 Aug 1557 and has been transcribed below. He was almost certainly buried at St Peters church where records have not survived for this period. Edith according to Hutchins pedigree for the Churchill Family re-married to Thomas FOXHILL of Dorchester but I have found no further trace of her..\n\nWill of John CHURCHILL (1525-1557)\n\ndated 15th Apr 1557 Proved 25th Aug 1557\n\nPROB 11/39\n\nIn the name of God Amen the 15th day of April in the year of our Lord God a thousand five hundred and fifty seven I John CHURCHILL of Dorchester in the Diocese of Bristol whole of mind and of perfect remembrance God be thanked make my last will and testament in manor and form following.\n\nFirst I give and bequeath my soul to almighty god and my body to the earth to be buried amongst the christian people deceased.\n\nItem To the Cathedral Church of Bristol 4 pence.\n\nItem To the Church of St. Peters in Dorchester a chalice piece gilt.\n\nItem to the church of Holy Trinity in Dorchester 6 shillings and 8 pence.\n\nItem to the church of All Hallows [i.e. All Saints]in Dorchester 3 shillings and 4 pence.\n\nItem to any of the poor people that shall do prayer to my burial 1 pence.\n\nItem to the poor people and to the persons within the town of Dorchester forty shillings by the year during the term of three years next after my departing this life to be paid and distributed by my executors or their assigns in the time of lent:\n\n[Item] to my brother Rowland CHUCHILL my gown furred with [ffoyms? foims?] and my coat of [sad?] [mccer?] collar [&?] To every servant in my house 2 shillings\n\nItem to every of my godchildren 4 pence. to my son John CHURCHILL 2 hundred pounds of lawful money of England to be paid unto him by my executors at such time as he shall accomplish the age of 21 years.\n\nItem to the same John [CHURCHILL] my house called Mathew Wulffe House with such land and meadow as appertaineth to the same as Mathew Wolfe lately held it to have the same John [CHURCHILL] my son and to his heirs of his body lawfully begotten and if he happen to die without such heirs then to remain to William CHUCHILL my son and his heirs for ever.\n\nItem to the same John [CHURCHILL] a gilt Goblet a featherbed two pair of sheets a [coneser?] [coverledd?] a pillow a pair of blankets\n\nItem and I will that my executors shall give unto said John [CHURCHILL] sufficient funding and apparel until he come to the age of 21 years.\n\nItem to Edith my wife my best goblet my salt with the cow and my best cup with the cow with best cup with his cow I will that she leave to my son William after her decease and to his heirs\n\n[Item] To my daughter Elizabeth forty one pounds which pr [presently] John Harssley oweth me.\n\nThe remainder of all my goods I will immediately after my death to be equally divided in two parts by my overseers and so being divided I give and bequeath them to Edith my wife and William CHURCHILL my son, that is to say one part of the same to Edith my wife and the other to William my son whom I make my executors\n\nItem I do constitute and make Thomas SYMONDE Gyles WINTEESEY and Denis BONNDE Overseers of this my will To this ?enth my t???

He left everything to Elizabeth who he made executrix. Elizabeth also left a Will Dated 3rd Nov 1610 which was Proved on 19 Jan 1611 in which among many other bequests she left her best gown and kirtle to Elizabeth Watts her goddaughter. and Â£150 to Susan William the daughter of Bruen Williams. There are also bequests to Maximilian Moone [Mohun] and siblings. Elizabeth asked to be buried at St Peters and probably was as she is not in the Parish Register of Holy Trinity and Registers for St Peters for this date have not survived.\n\n(1.3) John Churchill (c1545-1612) of Corton in Portesham. He married a daughter of John MOHUN of Fleet buried at Portesham. His Will is dated 1st Oct 1597 (PROB 11/95) and was proved 12 Mar 1599. In it he is described as John CHURCHILL of Corton which is a small hamlet within the Parish of Portesham in which church he asks to be buried. They had 2 children:-\n\n(3.1) Ann [Anna] Churchill (1578-1641) daughter and co-heir who was baptised at Portesham on 20th July 1578 and married there to Maximilian Mohun (1564-1612) [recorded as Moone] a Gentleman of Fleet on 4th Oct 1593. The Mohun Pedigree is recorded on page 72 of the 1623 Visitation of Dorset and also on page 46 of the 1677 Visitation from which it is evident that they had 10 children, 5 boys and 5 girls. Ann and her husband are beneficiaries under Elizabeth Smith's will in 1611. Anne's husband died in 1612 and Anne wrote her own will [PROB 11/189] on 9th Jan 1641 asking to be buried at Fleet and leaving bequests to surviving children and her estate to her eldest son also Maximilian Mohun.\n\n(3.2) Elizabeth Churchill daughter and co-heir married bef 1st Oct 1597 to Bruen [Brune & Brian] Williams Esq of Tyneham, Sheriff of Dorset in 1631. Bruen was the son of John Williams of Tyneham by his wife Jane daughter of Sir John Bruen of Rowner in Southampton. His Pedigree is given at page 98 of the 1623 Visitation and page 77 of the 1677 visitation of Dorset.\n\n2. William CHURCHILL (c1541-1602) Esq of Dorchester is thought to have been born in Holy Trinity Parish in Dorchester about the year 1541. He inherited half his fathers estate in 1557, the other half was owned by his mother Edith and may also have come to him at her death. Charter 648 (10 Jan 1562) held in the Municipal Records of Dorchester shows that also among his properties was a house in All Saints Parish in a lane behind or close to the church. He married one of the daughters of John SWAINE [SWAYNE] , of Blandford by his wife Agnes nee Ryves. Unfortunately we do not have her Christian name but William's wife is thought to have been born circa 1545 and they married around 1565 probably in the brides parish of Blandford. She presumably pre-deceased him as she is not provided for in William's will nor that of her father John Swayne of Blandford Forum (PROB 11/78) which was dated 17th Feb 1590/1 and was proved on 22nd Oct 1591. William Churchill was elected Bailiff of Dorchester in 1567 and was instrumental that year, along with Luke Adyn a capital burgess of Dorchester, in establishing the 'Free School' in Dorchester. He was elected Bailiff again in the year 1573.William died early in 1602 and was buried at St Peter's church in Dorchester in accordance with the wishes expressed in his Will. Parish Registers for St Peters prior to 1653 have not survived.\n\nWill of William CHURCHILL (1541-1602)\n\ndated 12th March 1599 Proved 18 Nov 1602\n\nPROB 11/100\n\nI William CHURCHILL of Dorchester in the County of Dorset Gentleman My Body to be buried in St Peters Church Dorchester finding myself of late years to be grieved with maine? sickness and knowing that I now grow old, so that by course of nature I cannot live long, therefore before the extremity either of sickness or age happen have determined to make my last Will and Testament the 12th day of March 1599, for the disposition of some part of my lands and of goods and chattels: To the end hereinafter I may not be troubled with worldly cares, but may wholly bestow my time in prayer and repentance for my sins.

John CHURCHILL (c1568-1621) Esq of Stinsford a clothier by trade who lived 2 miles from Dorchester at Stinsford in Dorset. Only son and heir of 2 above he matriculated at Hart's Hall Oxford on 16th March 1586/7 aged 18 and was admitted to Middle Temple in 1588/9. He inherited his fathers estate in 1602 and purchased Muston Manor in Piddlehinton (1.15) on 1st Jan 1609. He married (c1597) to Eleanor MELLER [MILLER] (c1571-1641) daughter of John Meller [Miller], Esq of Little Bredy in the parish of Winterbourne Came in Dorset (1.7) by his wife Ann Winterhay of Chethall in Dorset. From information held at the Dorset history Centre [ DC-DOB/32/1] John appears to be the \"Churchill of Colliton\" referred to by David Underdown on page 13 of his book 'Fire from Heaven' , who in 1598 established a fund from which loans were to be made to deserving 'poo9r artificers', a type of endowment that was becomming common in other English towns about this time. The Visitation for Dorset for the year 1623 on page 70 gives John Meller's pedigree and that for 1677 page 14 gives their children:-\n\n3.1 William Churchill (abt 1598-1680) Eldest son and heir, (See 4 below)\n\n3.2 Gervase Churchill (b. abt 1600) 2nd eldest son, may have died as not mentioned in his mothers will of 1641\n\n3.3.

He also received a bequest of Â£10 under his mother's Will which was proved on 10th July 1641.

He was buried at Steeple on 28th. He left a will dated 14th Oct 1681 (PROB 11/370) from which it is clear that at Elizabeth's marriage he charged his estates with a dowry of Â£1,000 for her. His place at Steeple was taken by Samuel Bolde who was imprisoned that year by James II after a spirited defence defence of the rights of dissenters to their own beliefs. John left by Sarah his wife, three daughters (1.9) so they probably married just prior to the start of the civil war circa 1641, but we have not located the marriage as many records do not survive from this period and do not therefore have her full name:-\n\n(1) Sarah Churchill (1642-1675) bap at Steeple on 3 Feb 1642/3 married to William COLLINS at Steeple on 14th Sep 1664 and died on 5th Dec 1675 where a memorial to her survives in the pavement within the alter rails at Steeple church.

William CHURCHILL (c1598-1680) Esq of Muston, Piddlehinton, Eldest son and heir of 3 above. High Sheriff of Dorset 1639\n\nHe does not always appear to have seen eye to eye with the local magistrates over performance of his manoral duties. At the Quarter Sessions held at Blandford between 10th and 13th January 1632 the constables for the hundred of Puddletown reported that the tithings of Little Puddle and Muston had failed to appoint a tithing man as required by law and the Court ordered William CHURCHILL, who inhabited the tithing, to provide a tithing man at his own charge or attend Court to show casue why not. Presumably he complied with the order but the following year at the Blandford Quarter Sessions (held between 7th to 10th Jan 1634) it was reported that he had been elected constable of the parish of Puddletown but had neglected his office. The Court ordered that he take his oath on pain of a fine of Â£10 and if he refused he was to be bound over to appear at the next Sessions.\n\nHe was nevertheless elected as High Sheriff 1639-43 and married on 5th Feb 1620/1 to Mary YARD the daughter of George Yard Esq of Churston Ferrers, Devon. He is credited with having built the current House at Colliton (see picture left, photograph by Phillip Allingham and position on John Speeds Map of Dorchester in 1611). The British History website, and listed buildings record, confirms that it was built in the 17c and extended circa 1700 but very extensively remodelled in the 2nd quarter of the 18c. The Visitation for 1677 gives William and Mary's surviving children as shown below. William Churchill inherited his fathers estate from his mother in 1641. He was buried at Piddlehinton on 12th Mar 1680,\n\n4.1 Christian Churchill (1621-1663) eldest daughter baptised Churston Ferrers Devon 11th Nov 1621 (1.8) buried unmarried at Piddlehinton on 20 Aug 1663\n\n4.2 John CHURCHILL JP (1622-1682) Esq of Muston J.P. 2nd child but eldest son and heir baptised at Churston Ferrers Devon 15th Dec 1622.

She had two elder siblings, Sophia Churchill baptised at Gussage All Saints 21st Nov 1738, and Joshua Churchill baptised at Gussage 10th July 1740. Jane however was baptised in her mothers home parish of St Martin in the Fields in London on 12th June 1747. Her father a descendant of William Churchill (1628-1706) and Elizabeth nee AWNSHAM (1630-1714) inherited his wealth via his uncle Joshua CHURCHILL (1664-1720) and passed it onto his son and heir. In her brothers will dated 13th July 1785 and proved 13th Feb 1786 he bequeathed to Jane \"my dear sister and the wife of William CHURCHILL of Colliton within the parish of Holy Trinity in Dorchester for her life , All that my Manor of East Stower with the messsuages farms and lands thereto belonging and his farm at Bitcombe in Wimborne Minster and all other freehold lands in the County of Dorset\" in trust to preserve the remainders for her sons William Rush Hallett and John Churchill. So his Jane was wealthy in her own right and hence some of the conditions in her husbands will.\n\nAnother document on ancestry is his qualificationas a Deputy Lieutenant which I have transcribed below:-\n\n\"I William CHURCHILL of Colliton in Dorchester do hereby declare that I am seized or possessed of such estate either in law or equity, to and for my own use and benefit consisting of Lands Tenements and Hereditaments as doth qualify me to act as a Deputy Lieutenant of and for the said County of Dorset and town of Poole according to the present Militia Laws: and that such premises are situate lying and being in the Parish of Piddlehinton in the said County of Dorset. Witness my hand the 15th day of September 1796\n\nIn John Hutchins History of the Liberty of Fordington published in 1860-1874, it comments:- \"The Churchill Family\" say Hutchins continuators \"had once a mansion situate in a part of Fordington called 'Britain', why called so nobdy can tell; it was an ancient edifice of stone, standing long since in the recollection of the present inhabitants of Fordington. It is said to have been something like the present house at Colliton, and stood quite on the bank of the Frome. It was taken down down when the estate to which it belonged was purchased by the Darner family. [Hutchins also includes a footnote:- Of Colliton House a view was supposed to be given in Gentlemans Magazine Vol 52 page 123 but not all like it Ibid Also on page 217, Mrs CHURCHILL died here April 1800 [actually 1801]. Her remains were interred in the family vault in St Peters church Dorchester. The corpse was followed to the church by the girls of the Sunday schools to the number 41, attended by two mistresses, all in close mouring, given them by the Revd Mr CHURCHILL, agreeably to his mothers request]\n\nWilliam Churchill died 1st December 1799 and was buried at St Mary's church in Piddlehinton on 9th December. He left a Will which has been transcribed below. His widow Jane was died on 12th Jan 1801 and she was buried with him in family vault in St Peters on the 19th. His widow Jane CHURCHILL was buried at St Peters on 19 Apr 1801.

In fact as recorded above he was bailiff 4 time from 1540. The elected post of Bailiff was a responsible job given to well respected members of Dorchesters Corporation and usually went to middle aged men of long standing and highly respected within the Dorchesters ruling elite. 15 years is a long break although not unheard of, but if we have his birth even approximately right he was too young at the age of 13? There were Churchill's in Dorchester for many years before 1525 and I think on balance that the 1525 appointment may relate to an earlier ancestor, but if not John Churchill would have been born earlier.\n\n(1.13) 'Dorchester Past' by Jo Draper\n\n(1.14) Municipal Records of Dorchester\n\n(1.15) The Story of Piddlehinton - Muston Manor\n\n(1.16) Census Returns 1841 Dorchester"
