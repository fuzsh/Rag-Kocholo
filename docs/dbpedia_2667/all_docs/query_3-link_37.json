Clark first appeared in the Muscatine Journal on January 10, 2023.\n\nI braved slick roads to attend a Martin Luther King Day celebration in Iowa City at the historic Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Instead of the announced speaker, Professor Venise Berry who got stranded by weather, I got to hear a preacher whose name I didn’t know but whose face I thought I recognized.\n\nSoon enough, I placed Orlando Ray Dial the instant he mentioned a recent communication with an unnamed (smile) Pulitzer Prize-winner former student. Of course! I had seen him on stage in Waterloo with journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones, the Iowa native now famous for creating The 1619 Project, the controversial New York Times series turned anthology, curriculum, and TV documentary.\n\nContinue Reading...\n\n“A fine figure of a Negro”\n\nTuesday, Jun 18 2024\n\nIowapeacechief\n\n2 Comments\n\nThis column by Daniel G. Clark about Alexander Clark (1826-1891) first appeared in the Muscatine Journal on Jan. 10, 2023—but heavily edited and with a different title (“Early remembrances of Alexander Clark”). And with the page-one teaser above. Further explanation follows the end of the column.\n\nA celebrated 20th century humorist drew much of his material from memories of growing up in Muscatine. Ellis Parker Butler (1869-1937) struck gold in 1906 with “Pigs Is Pigs,” then kept American laughing for three decades.\n\nHe married his hometown sweetheart, went to New York, and there succeeded as a publisher and banker. Always a part-time author, he wrote at least 32 books and more than 2,000 stories and essays.\n\nMuscatine Journal and News-Tribune (September 14, 1937): “The pen, with which he brought smiles to brighten the faces of countless readers from coast to coast, will write no more. The clean humor he created however, remains. He scattered sunshine while he lived.”\n\nContinue Reading...\n\nCascading through history\n\nTuesday, Apr 16 2024\n\nIowapeacechief\n\n0 Comments\n\nThis column by Daniel G.

Above: Historian Paul Finkelman at Susan Clark Junior High in February 2023.\n\nWhat will it take to get Muscatine’s Alexander Clark House declared a National Historic Landmark?\n\nFrom Guidelines for Preparing National Historic Landmark Nominations (2023): “Nationally significant properties embody stories that have exceptional value to the nation as a whole. … The history embodied in NHLs may not always be familiar, but their significance to the nation means that they are no less deserving of recognition.”\n\nOur city’s Historic Preservation Commission didn’t expect a “national significance” hurdle back in 2010 when we received a grant to hire an expert in U.S. legal history to help us make the case to the U.S. National Park Service. I was HPC chairperson at the time.\n\nContinue Reading...\n\nHistory nerds and turning points\n\nTuesday, Apr 2 2024\n\nIowapeacechief\n\n0 Comments\n\nStephen Frese in 2006 and 2023\n\nThis column by Daniel G. Clark about Alexander Clark (1826-1891) first appeared in the Muscatine Journal on Dec. 13, 2023.\n\nMy previous column told of the high-school junior whose 2006 biographical essay on civil-rights hero Alexander Clark won him a full-tuition university scholarship, the top prize in the National History Day competition.\n\nTo find out what became of Iowa’s prodigy, I sought help from Naomi Peuse who had been the NHD coordinator at the State Historical Society at the time.\n\n“Stephen Frese, the history nerd,” he called himself back then.\n\nSaying she had not been in touch with him in the intervening years, she quickly pointed me to a picture on the website of his alma mater, Marshalltown High School, where he is now a teacher—of science.\n\nContinue Reading...\n\nHistory Day champions\n\nMonday, Mar 25 2024\n\nIowapeacechief\n\n0 Comments\n\nThis column by Daniel G.

I asked if she knew that a student’s Alexander Clark essay had won big at the national level. Then it struck me how long ago it happened.\n\n“That was before you were born, so it’s time for another winner!”\n\nContinue Reading...\n\nQueen Susie and Grandmother Rebecca\n\nSaturday, Mar 16 2024\n\nIowapeacechief\n\n0 Comments\n\nThis column by Daniel G.

His letter comes to well over 2,000 words, maybe as much as three times my column here.\n\nContinue Reading...\n\nRefreshments of the season\n\nTuesday, Feb 13 2024\n\nIowapeacechief\n\n1 Comment\n\nThis column by Daniel G.

Clark first appeared in the Muscatine Journal on August 23, 2023. Above: Muscatine Journal and News-Tribune, September 23, 1919.\n\nRecently I told John Jelly’s 40-years-later account of a “colored man” bringing food for a “freedom seeker” hidden on a farm in northern Muscatine County in 1855.

The second documented case is from the small town of Atalissa, along U.S. Highway 6 in the northern part of the county.

Clark first appeared in the Muscatine Journal on June 28, 2023. Above: Detail from poster by Greater Muscatine Chamber of Commerce & Industry. Not finished in time for RAGBRAI, the 40-foot installation was dedicated on October 14.\n\nOne month hence, on July 29, RAGBRAI cyclists will dip their tires here, the seventh time Muscatine will have rolled out the red carpet—previously 1976, 1986, 1995, 2001, 2006, 2016.\n\nBefore paved roads, Iowa was famous for mud and muck. And no river-to-river Great Bicycle Ride, obviously.\n\nLong before Interstate 80 was imagined, a coalition of town leaders mobilized to build the border-to-border road christened the Great White Way. Its course from Davenport to Council Bluffs passed through Muscatine and Fruitland. It bragged the fastest route across Iowa, even outpacing the Lincoln Highway (later U.S. Highway 30).\n\nIn April 1914, about 40 Muscatine “boosters” drove through the construction zone 100 miles to Oskaloosa, headquarters of the Great White Way Association of Iowa, to make a pitch for hosting the movement’s annual picnic, an event promised to bring throngs of visitors.\n\nHaving won their bid, they retraced their tracks in high spirits, parading and partying and inviting everyone they met to attend the grand occasion on their Mississippi riverfront.\n\nMuscatine Journal, April 24, 1914: “In fact nearly every culvert along the route is either concrete or currugated iron, both of these being manufactured in Muscatine.”\n\nJournal, July 21: “Muscatine will be the scene of the greatest good roads celebration ever held in the state of Iowa when the Great White Way picnic is staged here from August 17th to 20th. Fifteen thousand visitors are expected to be attracted to Muscatine by the elaborate entertainment which is to be provided. Three thousand dollars is to be appropriated to meet the expenses of the event which will be of such magnitude as to attract tourists from the Mississippi to the Missouri rivers.”\n\nMotor-boat racing. Aqua-plane racing. Hydro-plane flights. Venetian Night illuminated boat parade. Free vaudeville acts and more.\n\n“The visitors will also be permitted to indulge in a Muscatine water melon orgy. Thousands of melons from the Muscatine Island, the richest melon producing area in the world, will be brought….”\n\nThe word went out. “5 p.m. Watermelon feed. Free watermelon to out of town visitors, who register at the headquarters.”\n\nBut the picnic got rained out. Presenters of activity and performers of entertainment slogged and soldiered on, but mud and muck prevailed. An effusive letter of thanks signed by officers of the association put on a brave face in praise of “arrangements for holding the greatest event of the kind ever planned.”\n\n“However valuable this deluge, the thousands who were thereby prevented from motoring to the picnic more than share your regret…. Muscatine and the hospitality of its people have become better known to hundreds of thousands of people through the middle west.”\n\nAssociation secretary Don McClure left for Oskaloosa “in his big touring car.”\n\n“‘I will tell every one who intends to take an auto trip in Iowa to be sure to stop at Muscatine and get a melon’ said McClure. He took with him two of the biggest melons in the city.”\n\n*****\n\nSo, listen up, you RAGBRAI riders. That historic route is how you will enter our town. After you cross under U.S. Highway 61, you will be on Hershey Avenue, admiring our soccer fields to your right. Soon you will approach our riverfront and at least one slice of fresh, juicy melon some volunteer will offer you.\n\nYou won’t believe your eyes when the 40-foot Largest Watermelon Slice on Planet Earth appears in view! Our mayor has promised to erect it for your passing pleasure and then grow it into a permanent icon.\n\nHe’s our Chamber of Commerce CEO, too: Booster-in-Chief Brad Bark.\n\nBut wait! Just a brief moment earlier you will be gliding by Carver Corner, and there you might give a special, grateful salute to those old-time good-roads boosters.\n\nGlance left at that red brick, three-story, Civil War-era building. It’s vacant. Some call it an eyesore, but still it stands defiantly—like it belongs there. After decades as grocery, saloon, restaurant, and dance hall, a new owner refurbished it for the comfort of 20th-century motorists and reopened in 1919 as the White Way Hotel.\n\n*****\n\nMuscatine Journal, September 29, 1914, quoting the Iowa Highway Commission magazine: “She had five blocks of her main street bejewelled with myriads of electric lights. White Way banners and streamers were countless. Store fronts were orgies of bunting and banners. Muscatine water melons straight from Muscatine Island were there, enough to feed the armies of the allies and Germans combined…. But the rains descended and the floods came and soaked all eastern Iowa. Instead of picnickers, Muscatine for two days had only messages from White Way automobilists tied up, scores of miles away.”\n\nThe guns of August 1914. Germany rolled over Belgium, and the Great War was on.\n\nEarly in 2022 I set out to relate pieces of our shared story framed as local Black History.

As early as 1853, the editor saw his neighbor’s life as news worth reporting. As Clark’s fame grew from local to national and beyond, John Mahin’s paper supplied evidence of what was said at the time about Iowa’s champion of emancipation and equality.\n\nDuring the 1880s, Clark and his son worked at publishing a leading Black newspaper in Chicago, The Conservator.

As a small child, she watched construction of a fine, brick church building at West 3rd and Chestnut streets.\n\nFamiliar as it became to her, that building was never her church. Rebecca and her family attended the African Methodist Episcopal where her father was the Sunday school superintendent, across Papoose Creek and most of the way up 7th Street hill. Their simple, rough building was also where she would attend the “African” school with her siblings and other “colored” children of the town.\n\nContinue Reading...\n\nJudge Cloud’s dilemma\n\nMonday, Jun 13 2022\n\nIowapeacechief\n\n0 Comments\n\nThis column by Daniel G.

This date is noted regularly by a few blacks in Muscatine, but even in his home town his name was little known until a survey of historic homes, in the fall of 1974, revealed that two houses that once belonged to a famous U.S. consular appointee were scheduled for demolition to make way for a new high-rise apartment building for low-income elderly.\n\nContinue Reading...\n\nRemembering Richard Harvey Cain of Muscatine\n\nThursday, Feb 24 2022\n\nIowapeacechief\n\n0 Comments\n\nThis column by Daniel G.

Clark starts appearing in John Mahin’s paper in 1857.\n\nFebruary 6: “We are indebted to A. Clark of this city for the proceedings … of a convention of the colored people of Iowa held here…. It was resolved to petition the Constitutional Convention to extend the right of elective franchise to native born negroes and to bestow upon them all the rights and privileges of citizenship.”\n\nBut then there’s this, on February 10: “A frame building on Seventh Street, near Iowa Avenue, was destroyed by fire last night. … Excepting the owners of the building, the one who will feel his loss most severely is Richard Cain, the pastor of the African M.E. Church, who occupied one of the apartments. Besides most all his household furniture, he lost a library worth not less than $150.”\n\nContinue Reading...\n\nAlexander Clark: A figure of national significance\n\nThursday, Feb 17 2022\n\nIowapeacechief\n\n0 Comments\n\nThis column by Daniel G.
