        "text": "One of Plymouth’s best known and most respected businessmen has received the honour of having a train named after him – as he fights serious illness.\n\nSteve Whiteway didn’t let pancreatic cancer stop him from leaving his hospital ward and visiting Plymouth railway station to see the intercity Class 802 locomotive pull in for the first time emblazoned with the words: “Steve Whteway, volunteering and serving the Plymouth community for over 50 years”.\n\nMr Whiteway, a director of Devon and Plymouth Chamber of Commerce, has dedicated his life to helping others, whether small businesses needing a leg up or community organisations in need of funds.\n\nThe 61-year-old is a serial campaigner and has helped raise more than £750,000 for charitable causes, winning many prestigious accolades, including the Prime Minister’s Points of Light award, for his endeavours over decades.\n\nHe was named one of Reach Plc’s 100 Great Westerners in 2017, which has led to GWR naming a train in his honour, putting him in the company of national treasures such as poet Sir John Betjeman, Monty Python’s Michael Palin, and Covid-era fundraiser Captain Tom Moore.\n\nMr Whiteway, who was accompanied by a small number of close friends and family members to view the loco, said: “Maybe I’m a regional treasure now. This is tremendous, I’m honoured and humbled.\n\n“I feel very good that this has happened to me and it’s also for the causes I have supported, they will get a bit of publicity from this.\n\n“I’ve been lucky, I had the opportunity to make other people’s lives better, and I’m gobsmacked to see that the little things I do can be a big thing in people’s lives.”\n\nAccompanied by his son Chris and daughter Lucy – and close friends Marilyn Grose, Neil Bailey, Steve Kerswell and Jimmy Apuduria-Chua – he was able to see the train, which will carry passengers between Penzance and London and also South Wales, at close quarters.\n\nDiagnosed with his illness in the early days of the coronavirus lockdown, he thanked NHS staff at Derriford Hospital’s Brent Ward, and colleagues from Plymouth’s St Luke’s Hospice, for arranging the event – and GWR for giving him such “an amazing honour”.\n\nMr Whiteway was born in the Stonehouse area of Plymouth in 1958. His bank manager father taught him the importance of community, and especially the role of entrepreneurs and businesses, “the backbone of the British economy”, he said.\n\nHis first job was selling pianos in a music shop in Plymouth. Mr Whiteway plays the instrument and has appeared in several bands and has been a familiar sight at concerts in the city.\n\nHis career took him into banking and finance, and then marketing, including a stint working in Dubai. More recently he spent seven years with Devon Contract Waste.\n\nMr Whiteway is also a director of the Plymouth Area Business Council, which has a membership of 250 key business, academic, and educational leaders in the city.\n\nHe is a former vice-chair of Fairtrade Plymouth, and honorary ambassador for the Plymouth City Centre Company.\n\nHe received his Points of Light Award, from Theresa May, for his work in helping alleviate food poverty, and won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the South West and Business Community\n\nAwards, in Swindon, in 2020, three years after receiving the Lifetime Achievement honour at Plymouth Live’s community awards.\n\n“I have worked with over 160 charities over the years, by raising profiles through music and sport,” he said.\n\nSign up to get FREE South West business news straight to your inbox\n\nBusinessLive South West is your home for business news in Bristol, Bath, Gloucestershire, Somerset, Wiltshire, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall.\n\nYou can sign up to receive FREE daily morning news bulletins from the region and we'll send out breaking news alerts for any stories we think you can't miss.\n\nVisit our email preference centre to sign up to all the latest news from BusinessLive.\n\nHow to contact William Telford and Business Live\n\nBusiness Live's South West Business Reporter is William Telford.

But for me mentoring, and nurturing tomorrow’s talent is crucial. I learned that when I followed my father into the banking and finance sector as an assistant manager at the Money Shop based in Plymouth Debenhams for five years.\n\n“I gained my marketing skills while working overseas in Dubai and without doubt, my favourite role was waste manager, at Devon Contract Waste. An environmentally-friendly waste disposal recycling company that works across the South West region.\n\n“The environment and climate change is still the most important agenda that future generations will face, once we overcome the coronavirus pandemic. And I’m proud to be a founder member of the Climate Change Commission being led by the University of Plymouth.\n\n“Business networking is still the key to success whether face-to-face or online during this coronavirus pandemic,” he added. “Putting something back in the community, mentoring tomorrow’s entrepreneurs is crucial for the long-term vibrancy of our local economy.\n\n“We all have a legacy and mine is always being positive, helping and supporting other businesses along the way, and especially new and small SMEs.”"
