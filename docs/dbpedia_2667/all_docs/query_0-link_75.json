        "text": "3 I assume that “sociable” has had different precise meanings in different times; this article is in part an exercise in tracing the evolving historical characteristics of sociability. That said, I generally have used “sociable” in the dictionary sense of the word—“characterized by, pertaining to, contact, intercourse, or companionship with others, esp. in a pleasant or friendly manner.” Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. “sociable.” Historians, philosophers, sociologists, etc., ultimately owe their use of and interest in the word to the rise in importance of “société” and “sociabilité” in early modern France, both as words and as concepts; for this development, see Gordon, Daniel, Citizens without Sovereignty: Equality and Sociability in French Thought (Princeton, NJ, 1994), 43–85Google Scholar.\n\n4 Stuteville collected Mead's letters, most of which are now in the British Library, Harley MSS 389 and 390. Most of my citations are directly from these manuscripts; some have been taken from Birch, Thomas, ed., The Court and Times of Charles the First, 2 vols. (London, 1848)Google Scholar. To my knowledge, the series of letters that Martin Stuteville wrote in return to Joseph Mead has not survived. The inspirations and precedents for this article are various microstudies of reading in early modern Europe, among them Grafton, Anthony's Commerce with the Classics: Ancient Books and Renaissance Readers (Ann Arbor, MI, 1997)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Lisa Jardine and Anthony Grafton, “‘Studied for Action’: How Gabriel Harvey Read His Livy,” Past and Present, no. 129 (November 1990): 30–78; Morrill, John, “William Davenport and the ‘Silent Majority’ of early Stuart England,” Journal of the Chester Archaeological Society 58 (1975): 115–29Google Scholar; Sharpe, Kevin, Reading Revolutions: The Politics of Reading in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT, 2000)Google Scholar; and Sherman, William, John Dee: The Politics of Reading and Writing in the English Renaissance (Amherst, MA, 1995)Google Scholar.\n\n5 Habermas defines the public sphere in early modern Europe as a floating sphere of unanchored discourse, embodied in the printed newspaper, which gradually leached authority from prior, embodied forms of authority and publicity.

This article depends generally upon the works of Shaaber, Dahl, Hanson, and their successors, which, with a heavy emphasis on print journalism, first established (1) the range of source material, (2) the prosopography, and (3) the general characteristics of Elizabethan and early Stuart news history.

The theoretical sources for this argument include Foucault, Michel, Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972–1977, trans. Gordon, Colin (New York, 1980), 98Google Scholar; James, Mervyn, “English Politics and the Concept of Honour, 1485–1642,” in Society, Politics, and Culture: Studies in Early Modern England (Cambridge, 1986), 308–415CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Johns, Adrian, The Nature of the Book: Print and Knowledge in the Making (Chicago, 1998), 36, 113–14, 125, 444–621CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Pitt-Rivers, Julian, “The Anthropology of Honour,” in The Fate of Shechem, or The Politics of Sex: Essays in the Anthropology of the Mediterranean (Cambridge, 1977), 1–17Google Scholar; Saunders, J.

For a review of the literature critiquing, controverting, and complicating Ong, see Coleman, Joyce, Public Reading and the Reading Public in Late Medieval England and France (Cambridge, 1996), 1–33Google Scholar. For the slow and complex nature of the transformation to literacy (acknowledged briefly by Ong; Ong, Orality and Literacy, 115–16) as it applied to news in early modern England, and for the persistence of oral news, see Fox, Oral and Literate Culture, 335–405.\n\n33 This sort of judgment of credibility was also bound up in a judgment of the honor of the writer of news, since honor carried with it the connotations of trustworthiness and truthfulness. For the interrelations of honor, truthfulness, and trustworthiness, see Segar, William, Honor, Military and Civill (London, 1602), 229Google Scholar; and Shapin, A Social History of Truth, 7, 36, 42–64. For the interrelation of social status and credibility in early modern Europe, also see Biagioli, Mario, Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism (Chicago, 1993), 58–59Google Scholar.\n\n39 British Library, Harley MS 390, fol. 331r. For concern with eyewitnessing, also see John Beaulieu to Thomas Puckering, December 1632, in Birch, Court and Times, 2:203. Newsletters originally mixed private and public news in the same letter; as private and public news diverged from each other, “separates” emerged—handwritten letters of purely public news attached to letters of private news, in a form that allowed them to be made anonymous, copied, and transmitted.\n\n47 The extent of this anonymity can be measured by the fact that Dahl found only two named sources for news in his entire bibliography of more than four hundred corantos. In A continuation of more newes from the Palatinate (26 July 1622), 3, a letter of news from Brazil was attributed to one William Clarke; and on the title page of The continuation of our weekly newes (28 October 1628, no. 19), an account of a naval battle against the Maltese was attributed to Thomas Roe. Dahl, Bibliography of English Corantos, 73, 162.\n\n57 The six corantos (Courante, or, newes from Italy and Germany [9 April 1621], Courante, or, newes from Italy and Germany, &c. [22 April 1621], Courant newes out of Italy, Germany, Bohemia, Poland &c [25 May 1621], Corante, or, newes from Italy and Germanie [6 June 1621], Corante, or, newes from Italy, Germanie, Hungarie and Spaine [25 June 1621], and Corante, or, newes from Italy, Germanie, Hungarie, Spaine and France [3 July 1621]) are in British Library, Harley MS 389, fols. 56, 68, 79, 82–84, 104, 106.\n\n63 The quotations I have selected overlap in time and show no particular temporal progression. Nevertheless, I do have a sense that Mead became somewhat more comfortable with corantos as the 1620s progressed. I cannot substantiate this impression with footnotes, since this is my reaction to the overall tone of his writing. For what it is worth, I note this impression to the reader.\n\n77 This compresses the argument of Randall, “Sovereign Intelligence,” 319–28. The theoretical sources for this argument include Giddens, Anthony, The Consequences of Modernity (Stanford, CA, 1990), esp. 21–27, 79–85Google Scholar; Luhmann, Nikolas, Trust and Power, trans. David, Howard, Raffan, John, and Rooney, Kathryn (Chichester, 1979), 4–95Google Scholar; Popkin, Richard, The History of Skepticism from Savonarola to Boyle (Oxford, 2003)Google Scholar; and Shapin, A Social History of Truth, 114–25, 243–354. For extensive news reading, also see George Wetheryd to Charles Radcliffe, July 1623, in Wentworth Papers, 1597–1628, ed. Cooper, J. P., Camden Society, 4th ser., 12 (London, 1973), 189Google Scholar; Ambrose Randolph to Jane Lady Cornwallis, February 1632, in Private Correspondence of Jane Lady Cornwallis, 250; and John Pory to John Scudamore, November 1632, in microfiche suppl. to Powell, John Pory, 1572–1636, 333. More generally, extensive reading dates back to antiquity, but the printing revolution's vast multiplication of available texts greatly promoted its practice. Blair, Ann, “Reading Strategies for Coping with Information Overload, ca. 1550–1700,” Journal of the History of Ideas 64, no. 1 (January 2003): 11–28, 14Google ScholarPubMed; Eisenstein, Printing Revolution, 43–44.\n\n79 The phrase “perceptual competence” is Shapin’s. Shapin, A Social History of Truth, 75–78; Fox, Oral and Literate Culture, 339. Compare Scott-Warren, Jason, “News, Sociability, and Bookbuying in Early Modern England: The Letters of Sir Thomas Cornwallis,” Library, 7th ser., 1, no. 4 (December 2000): 381–402CrossRefGoogle Scholar. But Shapiro argues that no particular perceptual competence is imputed to gentlemen in the legal records of early modern England. Shapiro, Barbara, A Culture of Fact: England, 1550–1720 (Ithaca, NY, 2000), 26Google Scholar. Looking forward, it is interesting to note that Milton's and Lilburne's arguments for a free press rested in good part on the assumption that God granted to the individual reader, regardless of earthly station, the “conscience”—sense, reason, and perceptual competence—to know truth from error. Achinstein, Sharon, Milton and the Revolutionary Reader (Princeton, NJ, 1994), 27–70CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n82 Nevertheless, having copied down for Stuteville what he heard read aloud, he did speculate to Stuteville as to what was passed over in silence: “And I could almost guess by what I have heard since by others what were those passages he concealed or some of them. For I heard that the Queen [Elizabeth] was desirous to come into England, but her Father [James VI and I] had absolutely forbidden her. That the King [Elector Frederick] should say, that were it not for the person of his Lady which he loved above all other, he could have wished he had married rather a Boor's daughter, then the King of Great Britain’s, &c.” British Library, Harley MS 389, fol. 67v."
