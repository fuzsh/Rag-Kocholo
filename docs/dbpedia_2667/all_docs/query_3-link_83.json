        "text": "There are a many things that make Birmingham special and this year's Commonwealth Games in the city gives us another reason to shout about them.\n\nOne of the gems in the city's crown must be the Alexander Stadium.\n\nThe colossal grounds are the heart of the West Midlands and have hosted everything from international sports events to musical concerts.\n\nSet to make history again as a major Commonwealth Games venue, we want to explore the history of this Perry Barr landmark.\n\nRead more: Where is the oldest place in the Black Country?\n\nIts roots tangle with the Birchfield Harriers, the UK's Premier Athletics Club and home of hundreds of ambitious athletes. Many have represented the UK at the Olympics since 1908.\n\nYou'll notice the club proudly display their logo of a stag leaping in the air with 'Fleet and Free' emblazoned underneath.\n\nNow where have we seen that stag before?\n\nIt may remind you of a certain Greyhound Stadium in Perry Barr which was actually the original Alexander Stadium.\n\nThat's right, Today's Perry Barr Greyhound Stadium was the first Alexander Stadium built in the 1920s through the club's own hard earned savings.\n\nThis is why the building displays a stag rather than dog.\n\nIt was named after William Whiteway Alexander, a big name in athletics and key figure of the club between the 1890s and 1930s. He was devoted to the early construction of the stadium.\n\nThe land was originally a rubbish tip which oddly helped as it contained a steady supply of cinders which would be used as the base of the new track.\n\nSo began the stadium's journey through hosting major sports events.\n\nIt even saw the Harrier's own Diane Leather become the first woman to run a sub-five minute mile, a world record in 1954.\n\nBizarrely the grounds were also transformed into a WW2 POW camp during the war years.\n\nEventually the club decided to create another stadium that could host global events, much like the Commonwealth Games, and so Birmingham City Council agreed to move the stadium to Perry Park.\n\nThis gave birth to the Alexander Stadium we know today which officially opened in 1976.\n\nSince it's creation the stadium has become the heart of British athletics and international events. This includes the prestigious Diamond League in 2011, an annual series of top track and field athletic competitions.\n\nIt also frequently hosts the British Athletic Championships.\n\nAnother major event the noughties generation may remember was BRMB's Party in the Park in 2000, a music concert featuring huge stars including Tom Jones, Atomic Kitten and Steps.\n\nNow, over 40 years later, the stadium evolves from being the baby of the Birchfield Harriers to a venue for the internationally renowned Commonwealth Games.\n\n£72 million was injected into a massive makeover that included increasing the seating capacity to 30,000 and installing a massive bold and blue warm up track.\n\nAs per tradition, the stadium will host the athletics and para athletics games, but also the opening and closing ceremonies helmed by creatives including Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight.\n\nAlexander Stadium has seen everything from adrenaline pumped athletes to WW2 veterans. Now in a mere seven months time it will add another world class event to its long list of accolades - the Commonwealth Games 2022."
