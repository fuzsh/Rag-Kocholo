        "text": "Credit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nStars You Didn’t Know Were Related: Jonah Hill and Beanie Feldstein, Madonna and Hillary Clinton, More\n\nWhile many famous faces have made a name for themselves on their own, some have surprising familial connections to one another.\n\nBeanie Feldstein, who rose to fame after starring in 2019’s Booksmart, is the younger sister of Jonah Hill and has frequently gushed over their sibling bond. She couldn’t help but rave about her older brother, who even got a tattoo of her name amid her Great White Way debut in Hello, Dolly.\n\n“Oh, my God, I mean, he’s my best friend in the world, so I’m always excited for him,” Feldstein told Us Weekly and other reporters in January 2020.\n\nThe acting siblings are hardly the only celebrities with surprising connections. Legendary Today meteorologist Al Roker shares common ancestors with Lenny Kravitz, which they discussed during a September 2011 appearance on the morning show.\n\nScroll down to see how some of the biggest Hollywood stars —from Madonna to Hillary Clinton — are related:\n\nCredit: Netflix (2)\n\nAshley Park and Justin H. Min\n\nIn addition to starring in Beef together, Park and Min are real-life cousins. In August 2024, Min gushed about how excited he was to join Park in the Netflix family. (Min is part of the cast for The Umbrella Academy while Park plays Mindy Chen in Emily in Paris.)\n\n“I love her to death, and I'm so glad we get to share this experience together,” Min gushed to People at the time. “It feels like this is a dream. It feels like we're living in a simulation, the fact that we're related and that we get to be on two great shows on Netflix. What are the crazy chances that that has happened?”\n\nCredit: Allen Berezovsky/Getty Images\n\nCiara and Derek Jeter\n\nThe “Level Up” singer was stunned by the news that she and the baseball legend had a family connection.\n\n“What in the world?” she said in a clip of an episode of Finding Your Roots shared via her Instagram in January 2023. “You are kidding me. Derek Jeter!”\n\nHistorian and host of Finding Your Roots, Henry Louis Gates Jr., explained that Ciara and Jeter “share a long identical stretch of DNA on their 14th chromosome,” which the singer noted was “crazy.”\n\nCiara’s husband, Russell Wilson, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his reaction, writing, “Always knew it!”\n\nCredit: Getty Images (2)\n\nWhoopi Goldberg and Tony Gonzalez\n\nThe View cohost was left speechless when she found out her relation to the NFL star.\n\nDuring an episode of the talk show in January 2023, Gates Jr. made an appearance on-air to tell Goldberg the news. (She had previously been on an earlier season of Gates Jr.’s series.)\n\n“On the first series, I did [a number of Black celebrities including] Whoopi and we didn’t have the sophisticated tests that we now use for DNA at that time,” he explained. “You all know about DNA cousins? You have a DNA cousin, dear … Tony Gonzalez is your DNA cousin.”\n\nGoldberg exclaimed “That’s my cousin?!” before extending Gonzalez an invitation to appear on The View.\n\nCredit: Stephen Lovekin/FilmMagic\n\nTracy Morgan and Nas\n\nMorgan said that his episode of PBS' Finding Your Roots revealed that Nas is a relative. \"I turn the last page, and guess who's sitting there? Nas. Me and Nas is third cousins on my mom's side,\" the comedian explained on the \"Connect the Dots\" podcast in December 2023.\n\n\"But me and Esco was always tight before that,\" he said of Nas. \"I did a show years ago on Comedy Central called One Mic, that was for Nas' mom that just passed away. So me and Esco always been tight.\"\n\nCredit: Gregory Pace/Shutterstock; Broadimage/Shutterstock\n\nRose Byrne and Rose McIver\n\nThe Bridesmaids star and the Once Upon a Time alum became sisters-in-law in January 2023 after McIver married Byrne’s brother, artist George Byrne.\n\n“We have a great dialogue and, while we are in different businesses, you obviously navigate a lot of similar things in the acting and photography industries,” the Insidious star previously told Jones magazine in May 2018 of her brother George. “I learn a lot from George’s perfectionist attitude when it comes to his work, because as a Leo I can be lazy, and I always value his opinion on a film project or a screenplay because creatively he’s got great taste. He’s got a great sense of humor, so he’s excellent to have a vent with if you’ve had a bad day, and we also just have that true closeness with a sibling that you can’t get with anyone else.”\n\nCredit: Ancestry ; Anthony Harvey/Shutterstock for BAFTA\n\nAshley Tisdale and Austin Butler\n\nThe High School Musical alum didn't know she was related to her longtime friend until diving into her family tree on Ancestry's 2 Leafs and a Lie in November 2022. The Elvis star is her 10th cousin, once removed.\n\n\"I couldn’t believe it, and I started to get emotional,” the Frenshe founder exclusively told Us Weekly at the time. “We’ve had an immediate connection since we met, and we’ve been close friends for years. We even joked about being fraternal twins.\"\n\nCredit: Matt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock\n\nJulia Roberts and Emma Roberts\n\nThe Pretty Woman star’s brother, Eric Roberts, is the father of the Scream Queens alum. Throughout the years, Emma has been vocal about her happy childhood memories of visiting her aunt on different film sets.\n\n“I’d write the wardrobe tags and organize the makeup brushes and watch how they did their continuity books,” the Belletrist founder recalled to Tatler magazine in January 2022. “I would ask questions without a filter. This industry really is ‘learn as you go.’” The following month, the Oscar winner shared a sweet Instagram video of the pair to celebrate Emma’s 31st birthday.\n\nCredit: Chelsea Lauren/Shutterstock\n\nJonah Hill and Beanie Feldstein\n\n“I’m trying to remember the day you were born,” the Accepted actor recalled to his younger sister during an April 2019 conversation for Interview magazine. “Mom was obviously in the hospital giving birth to you, and I think Dad and I were getting pasta across the street. I drive by that place sometimes, and I’m always thinking, ‘That’s where Dad and I were eating lunch, and then we met Beanie.’ Isn’t that funny? I don’t know if I ever told you that.”\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nMike Colter and Viola Davis\n\nThe Evil actor and the How to Get Away With Murder star are second cousins and were born in the same town, he revealed on The Talk in September 2019. However, they didn't meet until April 2019. “Honestly, we had never met but our families have family reunions, and they talk about us and stuff. They are very proud of us! We’re just very busy,\" he said at the time. \"In L.A., you could be right next to someone, in the same neighborhood, you’re never home. You’re filming somewhere, they’re busy, life happens. And we just never got caught up.... I figured we would just work it out, and we connected, and we just made it happen. Took us about a week. We were like, 'Let’s get some coffee and talk,' and I met her mom. Good times.”\n\nCredit: Michael Tran/Getty Images; Jerod Harris/FilmMagic\n\nJason Sudeikis and George Wendt\n\nCheers to this! The Saturday Night Live alum is actually Wendt’s nephew. “He was just a good example that being an actor was a viable option. Here’s a guy from the Midwest, in my family, who took the road less traveled and it worked out for him,” Sudeikis said during a 2011 Playboy interview. “The advice he gave me, and I say this jokingly, is 'Get on one of the best sitcoms of all time and then ride it out.’”"
