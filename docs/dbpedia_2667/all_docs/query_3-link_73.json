        "text": "One of Plymouth’s most respected businessmen has died a day after a train was named in his honour for services to the city.\n\nSteve Whiteway, aged 61, was a serial campaigner who raised more than £750,000 for charitable causes.\n\nHe left his hospital bed where he was fighting pancreatic cancer to visit Plymouth railway station on Thursday.\n\nSadly his family have confirmed that he died at Derriford Hospital at about 10.30pm last night.\n\nHis widow Diana said that he passed away peacefully with herself and daughter Lucy at his bedside, as well as close friends Marilyn Grose and Steve Kerswill.\n\nMr Whiteway was with Lucy and son Chris as to see the intercity Class 802 locomotive pull in for the first time emblazoned with the words: “Steve Whiteway, volunteering and serving the Plymouth community for over 50 years”.\n\nHis passing has provoked an outpouring of tributes for a man who estimates that he has helped more than 160 charities.\n\nLeanne Elliott was typical on social media when she wrote: “For those of you that knew him you’ll know Steve Whiteway was a legend.\n\n“He could hug for England, would do anything for anyone, raised £1000’s upon £1000’s for charity and could talk without drawing for breath!\n\n“He knew most people and if he didn’t he’d make a point of finding out who they were.”\n\nMr Whiteway, a director of Devon and Plymouth Chamber of Commerce, has dedicated his life to helping others, whether small businesses needing a leg up or community organisations in need of funds.\n\nAmong his accolades are the Prime Minister’s Points of Light award and being named one of Plymouth Live parent company Reach Plc’s 100 Great Westerners in 2017.\n\nThat prompted GWR naming a train in his honour, putting him in the company of national treasures such as poet Sir John Betjeman, Monty Python’s Michael Palin, and Covid-era fundraiser Captain Tom Moore.\n\nMr Whiteway, who was accompanied by a small number of close friends and family members to view the train, said that he felt lucky despite his illness.\n\nHe added: “Maybe I’m a regional treasure now. This is tremendous, I’m honoured and humbled.\n\nYou can stay up-to-date on the top news near you with PlymouthLive's FREE newsletters – find out more about our range of daily and weekly bulletins and sign up here or enter your email address at the top of the page.\n\n“I feel very good that this has happened to me and it’s also for the causes I have supported, they will get a bit of publicity from this.\n\n“I’ve been lucky, I had the opportunity to make other people’s lives better, and I’m gob-smacked to see that the little things I do can be a big thing in people’s lives.”\n\nDiagnosed with his illness in the early days of the coronavirus lockdown, he thanked NHS staff at Derriford Hospital’s Brent Ward, and colleagues from Plymouth’s St Luke’s Hospice, for arranging the event – and GWR for giving him such “an amazing honour”.\n\nMr Whiteway was born in the Stonehouse area of Plymouth in 1958. His bank manager father taught him the importance of community, and especially the role of entrepreneurs and businesses, “the backbone of the British economy”, he said.\n\nMr Whiteway, a keen keyboard player, has had his Facebook page flooded with tributes.\n\nSarah Parson wrote: “You did so much for the Plymouth community. We loved our coffee catch ups with you. I’m glad I got to meet you. Always smiling and made time for us.\n\n“A lovely gentleman with a kind heart. You will be missed.”\n\nAnnemarie Kerr added: “So so sad to hear. You were one in a million. Keep on playing with the great musicians in the sky. Big hugs to all your family. Steve you done Plymouth proud.”\n\nHis first job was selling pianos in a music shop in Plymouth. Mr Whiteway plays the instrument and has appeared in several bands and has been a familiar sight at concerts in the city.\n\nHis career took him into banking and finance, and then marketing, including a stint working in Dubai. More recently he spent seven years with Devon Contract Waste.\n\nMr Whiteway is also a director of the Plymouth Area Business Council, which has a membership of 250 key business, academic, and educational leaders in the city.\n\nHe is a former vice-chair of Fairtrade Plymouth, and honorary ambassador for the Plymouth City Centre Company.\n\nHe received his Points of Light Award, from Theresa May, for his work in helping alleviate food poverty, and won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the South West and Business Community Awards, in Swindon, in 2020, three years after receiving the Lifetime Achievement honour at Plymouth Live’s community awards.\n\n“I have worked with over 160 charities over the years, by raising profiles through music and sport,” he said."
