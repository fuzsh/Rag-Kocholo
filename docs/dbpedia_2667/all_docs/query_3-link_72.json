        "text": "A Person Paper on Purity in Language\n\nWilliam Satire (alias Douglas R. Hofstadter)\n\nFrom Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern\n\nby Douglas R. Hofstadter, Basic Books, 1985.\n\n(Original web version: http://www.bloomington.in.us/~abangert/person.html)\n\nIt's high time someone blew the whistle on all the silly prattle about revamping our language to suit the purposes of certain political fanatics. You know what I'm talking about-those who accuse speakers of English of what they call \"racism.\" This awkward neologism, constructed by analogy with the well-established term \"sexism,\" does not sit well in the ears, if I may mix my metaphors. But let us grant that in our society there may be injustices here and there in the treatment of either race from time to time, and let us even grant these people their terms \"racism\" and \"racist.\" How valid, however, are the claims of the self-proclaimed \"black libbers,\" or \"negrists\"-those who would radically change our language in order to \"liberate\" us poor dupes from its supposed racist bias?\n\nMost of the clamor, as you certainly know by now, revolves around the age-old usage of the noun \"white\" and words built from it, such as chairwhite, mailwhite, repairwhite, clergywhite, middlewhite, Frenchwhite, forewhite, whitepower, whiteslaughter, oneupuwhiteship, straw white, whitehandle, and so on. The negrists claim that using the word \"white,\" either on its own or as a component, to talk about all the members of the human species is somehow degrading to blacks and reinforces racism. Therefore the libbers propose that we substitute \"person\" everywhere where \"white\" now occurs. Sensitive speakers of our secretary tongue of course find this preposterous. There is great beauty to a phrase such as \"All whites are created equal.\" Our forebosses who framed the Declaration of Independence well understood the poetry of our language. Think how ugly it would be to say \"All persons are created equal,\" or \"All whites and blacks are created equal.\" Besides, as any schoolwhitey can tell you, such phrases are redundant. In most contexts, it is self-evident when \"white\" is being used in an inclusive sense, in which case it subsumes members of the darker race just as much as fairskins.\n\nThere is nothing denigrating to black people in being subsumed under the rubric \"white\"-no more than under the rubric \"person.\" After all, white is a mixture of all the colors of the rainbow, including black. Used inclusively, the word \"white\" has no connotations whatsoever of race. Yet many people are hung up on this point. A prime example is Abraham Moses, one of the more vocal spokeswhites for making such a shift. For years, Niss Moses, authoroon of the well-known negrist tracts A Handbook of Nonracist Writing and Words and Blacks, has had nothing better to do than go around the country making speeches advocating the downfall of \"racist language\" that ble objects to. But when you analyze bler objections, you find they all fall apart at the seams. Niss Moses says that words like \"chairwhite\" suggest to people-most especially impressionable young whiteys and blackeys-that all chairwhites belong to the white race. How absurd! It's quite obvious, for instance, that the chairwhite of the League of Black Voters is going to be a black, not a white. Nobody need think twice about it. As a matter of fact, the suffix \"white\" is usually not pronounced with a long \"i\" as in the noun \"white,\" but like \"wit,\" as in the terms saleswhite, freshwhite, penwhiteship, first basewhite, and so on. It's just a simple and useful component in building race-neutral words.\n\nBut Niss Moses would have you sit up and start hollering \"Racism!\" In fact, Niss Moses sees evidence of racism under every stone. Ble has written a famous article, in which ble vehemently objects to the immortal and poetic words of the first white on the moon, Captain Nellie Strongarm. If you will recall, whis words were: \"One small step for a white, a giant step for whitekind.\" This noble sentiment is anything but racist; it is simply a celebration of a glorious moment in the history of White.\n\nAnother of Niss Moses' shrill objections is to the age-old differentiation of whites from blacks by the third-person pronouns \"whe\" and \"ble.\" Ble promotes an absurd notion: that what we really need in English is a single pronoun covering both races. Numerous suggestions have been made, such as \"pe,\" \"tey,\" and others, These are all repugnant to the nature of the English language, as the average white in the street will testify, even if whe has no linguistic training whatsoever. Then there are advocates of usages such as \"whe or ble,\" \"whis or bler,\" and so forth. This makes for monstrosities such as the sentence \"When the next President takes office, whe or ble will have to choose whis or bler cabinet with great care, for whe or ble would not want to offend any minorities.\" Contrast this with the spare elegance of the normal way of putting it, and there is no question which way we ought to speak. There are, of course, some yapping black libbers who advocate writing \"bl/whe\" everywhere, which, aside from looking terrible, has no reasonable pronunciation. Shall we say \"blooey\" all the time when we simply mean \"whe\"? Who wants to sound like a white with a chronic sneeze?\n\nOne of the more hilarious suggestions made by the squawkers for this point of view is to abandon the natural distinction along racial lines, and to replace it with a highly unnatural one along sexual lines. One such suggestion-emanating, no doubt, from the mind of a madwhite-would have us say \"he\" for male whites (and blacks) and \"she\" for female whites (and blacks). Can you imagine the outrage with which sensible folk of either sex would greet this \"modest proposal\"?\n\nAnother suggestion is that the plural pronoun \"they\" be used in place of the inclusive \"whe.\" This would turn the charming proverb \"Whe who laughs last, laughs best\" into the bizarre concoction \"They who laughs last, laughs best.\" As if anyone in whis right mind could have thought that the original proverb applied only to the white race! No, we don't need a new pronoun to \"liberate\" our minds. That's the lazy white's way of solving the pseudoproblem of racism. In any case, it's ungrammatical. The pronoun \"they\" is a plural pronoun, and it grates on the civilized ear to hear it used to denote only one person. Such a usage, if adopted, would merely promote illiteracy and accelerate the already scandalously rapid nosedive of the average intelligence level in our society.\n\nNiss Moses would have us totally revamp the English language to suit bler purposes. If, for instance, we are to substitute \"person\" for \"white,\" where are we to stop? If we were to follow Niss Moses' ideas to their logical conclusion, we would have to conclude that ble would like to see small blackeys and whiteys playing the game of \"Hangperson\" and reading the story of \"Snow Person and the Seven Dwarfs.\" And would ble have us rewrite history to say, \"Don't shoot until you see the persons of their eyes\"? Will pundits and politicians henceforth issue person papers? Will we now have egg yolks and egg persons? And pledge allegiance to the good old Red, Person, and Blue? Will we sing, \"I'm dreaming of a person Christmas\"? Say of a frightened white, \"Whe's person as a sheet!\"? Lament the increase of person-collar crime? Thrill to the chirping of bobpersons in our gardens? Ask a friend to person the table while we go visit the persons'room? Come off it, Niss Moses-don't personwash our language!\n\nWhat conceivable harm is there in such beloved phrases as \"No white is an island,\" \"Dog is white's best friend,\" or \"White's inhumanity to white\"? Who would revise such classic book titles as Bronob Jacowski's The Ascent of White or Eric Steeple Bell's Whites of Mathematics? Did the poet who wrote \"The best-laid plans of mice and whites gang aft agley\" believe that blacks' plans gang ne'er agley? Surely not! Such phrases are simply metaphors: everyone can see beyond that. Whe who interprets them as reinforcing racism must have a perverse desire to feel oppressed.\n\n\"Personhandling\" the language is a habit that not only Niss Moses but quite a few others have taken up recently For instance, Nrs. Delilah Buford has urged that we drop the useful distinction between \"Niss\" and \"Nrs.\" (which, as everybody knows, is pronounced \"Nissiz,\" the reason for which nobody knows!). Bler argument is that there is no need for the public to know whether a black is employed or not. Need is, of course, not the point. Ble conveniently sidesteps the fact that there is a tradition in our society of calling unemployed blacks \"Niss\" and employed blacks \"Nrs.\" Most blacks-in fact, the vast ma jority-prefer it that way. They want the world to know what their employment status is, and for good reason. Unemployed blacks want prospective employers to know they are available, without having to ask embarrassing questions. Likewise, employed blacks are proud of having found a job, and wish to let the world know they are employed. This distinction provides a sense of security to all involved, in that everyone knows where ble fits into the scheme of things.\n\nBut Nrs. Buford refuses to recognize this simple truth. Instead, ble shiftily turns the argument into one about whites, asking why it is that whites are universally addressed as \"Master,\" without any differentiation between employed and unemployed ones. The answer, of course, is that in America and other Northern societies, we set little store by the employment status of whites, Nrs. Buford can do little to change that reality, for it seems to be tied to innate biological differences between whites and blacks. Many white-years of research, in fact, have gone into trying to understand why it is that employment status matters so much to black, yet relatively little to whites. It is true that both races have a longer life expectancy if employed, but of course people often do not act so as to maximize their life expectancy. So far, it remains a mystery. In any case, whites and blacks clearly have different constitutional inclinations, and different goals in life. And so I say, Vive na différence!\n\nAs for Nrs. Buford's suggestion that both \"Niss\" and \"Nrs.\" be unified into the single form of address \"Ns.\" (supposed to rhyme with \"fizz\"), all I have to say is, it is arbitrary and clearly a thousand years ahead of its time. Mind you, this \"Ns. \" is an abbreviation concocted out of thin air: it stands for absolutely nothing. Who ever heard of such toying with language? And while we're on this subject, have you yet run across the recently founded Ns. magazine, dedicated to the concerns of the \"liberated black\"? It's sure to attract the attention of a trendy band of black airheads for a little while, but serious blacks surely will see through its thin veneer of slick, glossy Madison Avenue approaches to life.\n\nNrs. Buford also finds it insultingly asymmetric that when a black is employed by a white, ble changes bler firmly name to whis firmly name. But what's so bad about that? Every firm's core consists of a boss (whis job is to make sure long-term policies are well charted out) and a secretary (bler job is to keep corporate affairs running smoothly on a day-to-day basis). They are both equally important and vital to the firm's success. No one disputes this. Beyond them there may of course be other firmly members. Now it's quite obvious that all members of a given firm should bear the same firmly name-otherwise, what are you going to call the firm's products? And since it would be nonsense for the boss to change whis name, it falls to the secretary to change bler name. Logic, not racism, dictates this simple convention.\n\nWhat puzzles me the most is when people cut off their nose to spite their faces. Such is the case with the time-honored colored suffixes \"oon\" and \"roon,\" found in familiar words such as ambassadroon, stewardoon, and sculptroon. Most blacks find it natur al and sensible to add those suffixes onto -nouns such as \"aviator\" or \"waiter.\" A black who flies an airplane may proudly proclaim, \"I'm an aviatroon!\" But it would sound silly, if not ridiculous, for a black to say of blerself, \"I work as a waiter.\" On the other hand, who could object to my saying that the lively Ticely Cyson is a great actroon, or that the hilarious Quill Bosby is a great comedioon? You guessed it-authoroons such as Niss Mildred Hempsley and Nrs. Charles White, both of whom angrily reject the appellation \"authoroon,\" deep though its roots are in our language. Nrs. White, perhaps one of the finest poetoons of our day, for some reason insists on being known as a \"poet.\" It leads on to wonder, is Nrs. White ashamed of being black, perhaps? I should hope not. White needs Black, and Black needs White, and neither race should feel ashamed.\n\nSome extreme negrists object to being treated with politeness and courtesy by whites. For example, they reject the traditional notion of \"Negroes first,\" preferring to open doors for themselves, claiming that having doors opened for them suggest implicitly that society considers them inferior. Well, would they have it the other way? Would these incorrigible grousers prefer to open doors for whites? What do blacks want?\n\nAnother unlikely word has recently become a subject of controversy: \"blackey.\" This is, of course, the ordinary term for black children (including teenagers), and by affectionate extension it is often applied to older blacks. Yet, incredible though it seems, many blacks-even teen-age blackeys-now claim to have had their \"consciousness raised,\" and are voguishly skittish about being called \"blackeys.\" Yet it's as old as the hills for blacks employed in the same office to refer to themselves as \"the office blackeys,\" And for their superior to call them \"my blackeys\" helps make the ambiance more relaxed and comfy for all. It's hardly the mortal insult that libbers claim it to be. Fortunately, most blacks are sensible people and realize that mere words do not demean; they know it's how they are used that counts. Most of the time, calling a black-especially an older black-a \"blackey\" is a thoughtful way of complimenting bler, making bler feel young, fresh, and hirable again. Lord knows, I certainly wouldn't object if someone told me that I looked whiteyish these days!\n\nMany young blackeys go through a stage of wishing they had been born white. Perhaps this is due to popular television shows like Superwhite and Batwhite, but it doesn't really matter. It is perfectly normal and healthy. Many of our most successful blacks were once tomwhiteys and feel no shame about it. Why should they? Frankly, I think tomwhiteys are often the cutest little blackeys-but that's just my opinion. In any case, Niss Moses (once again) raises a ruckus on this score, asking why we don't have a corresponding word for young whiteys who play blackeys' games and generally manifest a desire to be black. Well, Niss Moses, if this were a common phenomenon, we most assuredly would have such a word, but it just happens not to be. Who can say why? But given that tomwhiteys are a dime a dozen, it's nice to have a word for them. The lesson is that White must learn to fit language to reality; White cannot manipulate the world by manipulating mere words. An elementary lesson, to be sure, but for some reason Niss Moses and others of bler ilk resist learning it.\n\nShifting from the ridiculous to the sublime, let us consider the Holy Bible. The Good Book is of course the source of some of the most beautiful language and profound imagery to be found anywhere. And who is the central character of the Bible? I am sure I need hardly remind you; it is God. As everyone knows, Whe is male and white, and that is an indisputable fact. But have you heard the latest joke promulgated by tasteless negrists? It is said that one of them died and went to Heaven and then returned. What did ble report? \"I have seen God, and guess what? Ble's female!\" Can anyone say that this is not blasphemy of the highest order? It just goes to show that some people will stoop to any depths in order to shock. I have shared this \"joke\" with a number of friends of mine (including several blacks, by the way), and, to a white, they have agreed that it sickens them to the core to see Our Lord so shabbily mocked. Some things are just in bad taste, and there are no two ways about it. It is scum like this who are responsible for some of the great problems in our society today, I am sorry to say.\n\nWell, all of this is just another skirmish in the age-old Battle of the Races, I guess, and we shouldn't take it too seriously. I am reminded of words spoken by the great British philosopher Alfred West Malehead in whis commencement address to my alma secretaria the University of North Virginia: \"To enrich the language of whites is, certainly, to enlarge the range of their ideas.\" I agree with this admirable sentiment wholeheartedly. I would merely point out to the overzealous that there are some extravagant notions about language that should be recognized for what they are: cheap attempts to let dogmatic, narrow minds enforce their views on the speakers lucky enough to have inherited the richest, most beautiful and flexible language on earth, a language whose traditions run back through the centuries to such deathless poets as Milton, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Keats, Walt Whitwhite, and so many others... Our language owes an incalculable debt to these whites for their clarity of vision and expression, and if the shallow minds of bandwagon-jumping negrists succeed in destroying this precious heritage for all whites of good will, that will be, without any doubt, a truly female day in the history of Northern White.\n\nPost Scriptum\n\nPerhaps this piece shocks you. It is meant to. The entire point of it is to use something that we find shocking as leverage to illustrate the fact that something that we usually close our eyes to is also very shocking. The most effective way I know to do so is to develop an extended analogy with something known as shocking and reprehensible. Racism is that thing, in this case. I am happy with this piece, despite-but also because of-its shock value. I think it makes its point better than any factual article could. As a friend of mine said, \"It makes you so uncomfortable that you can't ignore it.\" I admit that rereading it makes even me, the author, uncomfortable! Numerous friends have warned me that in publishing this piece I am taking a serious risk of earning myself a reputation as a terrible racist. I guess I cannot truly believe that anyone would see this piece that way. To misperceive it this way would be like calling someone a vicious racist for telling other people \"The word 'nigger' is extremely offensive.\" If allusions to racism, especially for the purpose of satirizing racism and its cousins, are confused with racism itself, then I think it is time to stop writing.\n\nSome people have asked me if to write this piece, I simply took a genuine William Safire column (appearing weekly in the New York Times Magazine under the title \"On Language\") and \"fiddled\" with it. That is far from the truth. For years I have collected examples of sexist language, and in order to produce this piece, I dipped into this collection, selected some of the choicest, and ordered them very carefully. \"Translating\" them into this alternate world was sometimes extremely difficult, and some words took weeks. The hardest terms of all, surprisingly enough, were \"Niss,\" \"Nrs.,\" and \"Ns.,\" even though \"Master\" came immediately. The piece itself is not based on any particular article by William Safire, but Safire has without doubt been one of the most vocal opponents of nonsexist language reforms, and therefore merits being safired upon.\n\nInterestingly, Master Safire has recently spoken out on sexism in whis column (August 5, 1984). Lamenting the inaccuracy of writing either \"Mrs. Ferraro\" or \"Miss Ferraro\" to designate the Democratic vice-presidential candidate whose husband's name is \"Zaccaro,\" whe writes:\n\nIt breaks my heart to suggest this, but the time has come for Ms. We are no longer faced with a theory, but a condition. It is unacceptable for journalists to dictate to a candidate that she call herself Miss or else use her married name; it is equally unacceptable for a candidate to demand that newspapers print a blatant inaccuracy by applying a married honorific to a maiden name.\n\nHow disappointing it is when someone finally winds up doing the right thing but for the wrong reasons! In Safire's case, this shift was entirely for journalistic rather than humanistic reasons! It's as if Safire wished that women had never entered the political ring, so that the Grand Old Conventions of English-good enough for our grandfathers- would never have had to be challenged. How heartless of women! How heartbreaking the toll on our beautiful language!\n\nA couple of weeks after I finished this piece, I ran into the book The Nonsexist Communicator, by Bobbye Sorrels. In it, there is a satire called \"A Tale of Two Sexes,\" which is very interesting to compare with my \"Person Paper,\" Whereas in mine, I slice the world orthogonally to the way it is actually sliced and then perform a mapping of worlds to establish a disorienting yet powerful new vision of our world, in hers, Mrs. Sorrels simply reverses the two halves of our world as it is actually sliced. Her satire is therefore in some ways very much like mine, and in other ways extremely different. It should be read.\n\nI do not know too many publications that discuss sexist language in depth. The finest I have come across are the aforementioned Handbook of Nonsexist Writing, by Casey Miller and Kate Swift; Words and Women, by the same authors; Sexist Language: A Modern Philosophical Analysis, edited by Mary Vetterling-Braggin; The Nonsexist Communicator, by Bobbye Sorrels; and a very good journal titled Women and Language News. Subscriptions are available at Centenary College of Louisiana, 2911 Centenary Boulevard, Shreveport, Louisiana 71104.\n\nMy feeling about nonsexist English is that it is like a foreign language that I am learning. I find that even after years of practice, I still have to translate sometimes from my native language, which is sexist English. I know of no human being who speaks Nonsexist as their native tongue. It will be very interesting to see if such people come to exist. If so, it will have taken a lot of work by a lot of people to reach that point."
