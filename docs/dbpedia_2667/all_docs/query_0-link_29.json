        "text": "In recent years, historians have conducted an extended debate on the nature and level of violence in early modern English society. This debate has come to focus on the murder rate as an index of violence and to turn on highly specialized points of statistical analysis. In some ways it can be characterized as a debate between optimistic and pessimistic historians. Lawrence Stone, representing the “pessimists,” paints a portrait of early modern society as violent, unloving, and uncaring until civilized by the eighteenth century; J. A. Sharpe, representing the “optimists,” emphasizes the problems of the data used by Stone and argues, like Alan Macfarlane, that English society in the early modern period was little different from that of today. J. S. Cockburn, the latest entrant into the fray, leans toward the optimists but has expressed some hesitation about the debate itself: he notes not only the serious problems with the data involved but also the difficulties of defining what constitutes a violent society, as “it is not at all clear that homicide rates are a reliable measure of the overall level of violent behavior in a particular society.” This caution suggests that we should take an entirely different approach to the problem of violence, to look for “the social meaning of violence.” We must move beyond the statistical data (important though they be) to a broader context for thinking about violence.\n\nThe way historians think about violence has been deeply influenced by the work of Max Weber and his assertion that “legal coercion by violence is the monopoly of the state”; it is often forgotten that the first word of that sentence is “Today.”\n\n11 Foucault, Michel, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison (New York, 1979), pt. 1 passim and p. 80Google Scholar; I could write at far greater length about Foucault, but it would take me away from my central argument. In general, I find that Foucault's emphasis on state power over the body in the ancien regime misses the attempts of early modern society to discipline the soul; what is different about the disciplinary structures of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is not so much the use of “a mechanism that coerces by means of observation” (p. 170): such a mechanism is in place in early modern villages. What is new is the way that mechanism and observation were organized. For observation and discipline in early modern villages, see, e.g., Amussen, Susan D., “Feminin/Masculin: Le genre dans l'Angleterre de l'epoque moderne,” Annales: Economies, societies, civilisations 40, no. 2 (1985): 269–87CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n19 Gardiner, Samuel Rawson, ed., Documents Relating to the Proceedings against William Prynne, in 1634 and 1637, with a Biographical Fragment by the Late John Bruce, Camden Society, n.s., vol. 18 (London, 1877)Google Scholar (hereafter Proceedings against William Prynne), pp. 1–31, esp. 2–3, 5, 8, 10 for the offense, and the discussion of punishment, pp. 17–28; see also Cobbett's State Trials, 3:561–86Google Scholar; and Rushworth, John, Historical Collections. The Second Part, Containing the Principal Matters Which happened from the Dissolution of the Parliament, on the 10th of March, 4 Car. I. 1628/9 Until the Summoning of another Parliament, which met at Westminster, April 13, 1640 … Impartially Related and Disposed in Annals, Setting forth only Matter of Fact in Order of Time, Without Observation or Reflection (London, 1680), pp. 220–41, 247–49Google Scholar.\n\n20 Proceedings against William Prynne, pp. 19–20, 25; Cobbett's State Trials, 3:584–86Google Scholar. The question of why he—and other later offenders—was prosecuted in Star Chamber is not altogether clear. Although scandalum magnatum was punishable in common-law courts by statutes of 1&2 Philip and Mary c. 3 and 1 Eliz. c. 6 (which also established the loss of ears as the penalty for spreading seditious news and loss of the right hand for writing it), the practice even under Elizabeth seems to have been to prosecute such cases in Star Chamber when they pertained to the royal government, and Star Chamber does not appear to have acknowledged any statutory basis for their actions; the exception to this is the trial of the puritan John Udall at the Surrey Assizes in July 1590 for seditious libel against the queen; Star Chamber was always, of course, easier to control than a jury, and in cases relating to the crown, it was always better not to depend on ajury: Cobbett's State Trials, 1:1271–1316Google Scholar; Plucknett, Theodore F. T., A Concise History of the Common Law, 5th ed. (Boston, 1956), pp. 486–87Google Scholar; Collinson, Patrick, The Elizabethan Puritan Movement (Berkeley, Calif., and Los Angeles, 1967), p. 407Google Scholar.\n\n22 Rushworth, 2:380–82; Cobbett's State Trials, 3:711–55Google Scholar; it was reported that the “hangman hewed off Prynne's ears very scurvily, which put him to much pain” because on the previous occasion Prynne had given the hangman a smaller tip than he had promised; see Proceedings against William Prynne, p. 87. It is interesting to compare the punishments to those imposed on the people who sheltered the press in the Martin Marprelate case, also in Star Chamber: though Collinson describes the punishment as “crushing” (p. 418) the fines were lighter than those of Burton, Bastwick, and Prynne, and there was no ritual shaming or mutilation, though those convicted were imprisoned during the queen's pleasure; see McGrath, Patrick, Papists and Puritans under Elizabeth I (London, 1967), pp. 248–49Google Scholar; the trials in King's Bench of Sir John Elliot, Denzil Hollis, and Benjamin Valentine after their disruption of the dissolution of Parliament in 1629 also led to much lighter fines than those imposed on Burton, Bastwick, and Prynne; see Cobbett's State Trials, 3:293–310Google Scholar; Cope, pp. 15–16.\n\n23 Cobbett's State Trials, 3:1315–21Google Scholar; Lilburne also refused to take the ex officio oath, which required those taking it to swear to answer all questions that were asked; it was anathema to the common lawyers (among others) because the questions did not need to be limited to the issues under investigation and could be used for general fishing expeditions by the authorities who were looking for offenders; he also challenged the legality of Star Chamber proceedings. Lilburne's own account of his punishment is found in Cobbett's State Trials, 3:1328–42Google Scholar; Lilburne was prosecuted (and punished) with the elderly John Wharton, though the sources are almost silent about Wharton's fate, in part because Lilburne successfully publicized his own position; because of Wharton's age (eighty-five), he was spared the whipping, but he was certainly still in prison in July 1638 when he petitioned for his wife or servant to be allowed to help him in his “extremity.” He was also as quarrelsome as Lilburne, if the letter to Sir John Lambe in December 1637 arguing against the ex officio oath is properly attributed to him: CSPD, Charles I, vol. 12 (1637–38), pp. 2, 569 (P.R.O. SP 16 373/3, 395/73).\n\n29 Langbein (n. 17 above), pp. 75–76: some accused might elect peine forte et dure because they would not be convicted of a crime, and therefore their property would not be forfeited to the crown. Lupton, Donald, London and the Countrey Carbonadoed and Quartred into severall Characters (London, 1632)Google Scholar, Short Title Catalog (S.T.C.) 16944, suggests that in Newgate there are “many to be pressed to death” (p. 49)—though how accurate this is is unclear. One notable person who was pressed to death was the Catholic Margaret Clitheroe, who refused to plead “that she might not bring others into danger by her conviction, or be accessory to the jurymen's sins in condemning the innocent”; see Challoner, Richard D., Memoirs of Missionary Priests, ed. Pollen, John H. (London, 1924), p. 119Google Scholar.\n\n75 Bodleian Library, Ms. Top. Norfolk c. 2, fol. 80; it may be significant that this feasting took place on Christmas Eve; cf. Dorset R.O. B7 A4/4, Lyme Regis Quarter Sessions, June 16, 1699, when the watchman, Thomas Brewford, used “violence and force” to get Mr. George Jackson out of the Three Cups and to his own house; Jackson threatened Brewford and one of the servants before being disarmed. Both Brewford and Jackson had histories of being quarrelsome: some years later Jackson complained of an unprovoked assault by Steven Bowdedge (B7 A4/5, May 12, 2 Anne); Brewford is in other fights while serving on the watch, and in an apparently senseless fight some years later (B7 A4/5 passim, esp. July 21, 3 Anne, also B7 A4/6, July Sessions 1711), when Brewford refuses to serve on the watch."
