        "text": "Page 27 →The Emperor (Jones) Is Dead. Long Live the Emperor!\n\nIn order to attend to the traces of the Emperor across time and among multiple bodies, Joseph Roach’s notion of surrogation seems an apt line of critical inquiry. We might say that the Emperor’s remains were summoned forth, recalling circum-Atlantic memories that had been long forgotten in a process of surrogation, where one thing stands in for another and the antecedent is forgotten. Roach’s famous example of surrogation—“the King is dead, long live the King”—could well be replaced with “The Emperor is dead. Long live the Emperor.”41 And yet, because surrogation requires an absenting of the former thing (or Emperor) for another, it does not quite account for multiple citational threads. Diana Taylor’s notion of “doubling” more accurately accounts for performative complexity. By attending to doubling, the predecessors—in this case, former actors as Brutus Jones and their historical contexts—can be preserved, offering “a form of multiplication and simultaneity rather than surrogation and absenting.”42 This doubling—or, more accurately, performative layering—reveals multiple Emperors on the move, as co-terminus productions. Given these layered productions, with multiple Brutus Joneses as surrogated Black sovereigns, it is productive to refer to them citationally in the plural—as “The Emperors Jones”—as Gwendolyn Bennett’s 1930 article in the African American periodical Opportunity named them.43 This chapter digs up various productions’ past lives to excavate previous meanings and contexts. I am exhuming, in other words, the Emperors’ remains.44 In searching for the Emperor’s relics in this chapter, two iconic actors who raced the Great White Way while wearing the Emperor’s coat take center stage: Charles Gilpin and Paul Robeson. Each actor altered O’Neill’s script with performative interventions, creating their own resistant repertoires.\n\nGilpin’s story not only serves as a quintessential example of racing the Great White Way but also complicates our understanding of theatrical authorship and unacknowledged contributions from Black theater artists.45 Gilpin once famously declared, “I created the role of the Emperor. That role belongs to me. That Irishman, he just wrote the play.”46 His well-known hailing of O’Neill as “that Irishman” is telling, for it shows the entanglements with, and clashes among, Irish and Black culture. Indeed, it could be argued that Gilpin created the play as much as O’Neill (this is precisely Montgomery’s point in the quote earlier in the chapter). Gilpin famously revised (or, raced) O’Neill’s play, especially on tour, by taking out the problematic use of the n-word, which appears thirty-four times in The Emperor Page 29 →Jones. As David Krasner observes, Gilpin “balked at what appeared to him to be an excessive and repetitive use of the term ‘n——r’, preferring instead to use the less offensive terms Black-baby, Negro, or colored man” (italics in the original).47 Biographers offer differing accounts of O’Neill’s displeasure with Gilpin’s revisions, but, as Louis Sheaffer tells it, O’Neill warned: “If you change the lines again, I’ll beat the hell out of you!”48 But Gilpin did change the lines, and not only for the two years while he was on tour, but also for several years in revivals of the role and a production that he directed—on Broadway.\n\nIn addition to altering the offensive language in The Emperor Jones, Gilpin highlighted circum-Caribbean connections between Brutus Jones’s despotic rule in the West Indies and the legacy of slavery in the U.S. As part of his Brutus Jones costume, Gilpin wore a large belt buckle with the initials CSA (Confederate States of America). Masquerading as a member of the Confederacy—and literally wearing the cloak of racism—Gilpin embodied the connections among oppressive regimes of race. By blatantly donning the symbol of the CSA, Gilpin was also pointing to the connective tissue between historical practices of slavery throughout the diaspora and racism on Broadway. Rather than seeing these choices as contradictory elements with a Brechtian alienation effect as Ronald H. Wainscott claims, I interpret Gilpin’s performative interventions as showing the complementary citationality between these oppressive discourses.49 Even in the final scenes when Gilpin (as Jones) confronts the Congo Witch-Doctor shirtless and in tattered pants, the CSA buckle stands out prominently. Though a despotic ruler, who learns exploitation from white businessmen while a Pullman porter, Jones is ultimately a casualty of racism—buckled in, we could say, by oppressive racial hierarchies.\n\nOn tour, The Emperor Jones raced spectatorship at a time when segregated audiences were the norm. When The Emperor Jones went on the road for almost two years from 1920 to 1922, both Black and white spectators came to see Gilpin. It was hardly a royal tour, but there was something regal about the audiences Gilpin commanded throughout the United States, in both highbrow and lowbrow spaces—from Los Angeles to Des Moines to El Paso—until he was threatened by the Ku Klux Klan.50 Gilpin was inventive in bringing The Emperor Jones to unlikely places. Perhaps one of the most unusual venues was an early manifestation of what we now call prison theater: Gilpin performed O’Neill’s play in Sing Sing prison in 1923.51 Speaking about his extensive performances in a New York Amsterdam News interview, Gilpin recounted: “Oh, I guess I’ve played Jones about 2,500 times, from coast to coast, from beyond border to beyond Page 30 →border. In New York, on the road, at benefit performances and whatnot. And it hasn’t played out its string yet.”52 Gilpin’s choice of words—“from beyond border to beyond border”—is striking. It demonstrates not only the incredible mileage he logged while racing beyond Broadway, but also how his performances facilitated interracial border crossings. The Emperor Jones played to mixed houses in the South, as recounted by one Virginian reporter: “When the theatre was filled, by one of those unwritten laws that prevail in the South, the balcony was filled with Negroes and the orchestra with white people. Gilpin appeared on the stage, and a roar of applause greeted him from the galleries.”53 As with casting, The Emperor Jones raced spectatorship barriers.\n\nGilpin loved a good comeback and so in 1926 he not only revived The Emperor Jones for the Provincetown Players but also directed his own production on Broadway—and another color line was broken.54 By breaking “The Color Line in Art,” as the African American newspaper the Chicago Defender characterized it, Gilpin proved that “the color of a man’s skin was [not] the deciding factor as to the success of his esthetic endeavors.”55 The revival received glowing reviews in both Black and white papers. Gilpin was back. “The return of ‘The Emperor Jones’ to New York discloses to those who might have entertained any doubts of the ability of Charles S. Gilpin’s latent dramatic power,” the New York Amsterdam News reported.56 And, reminding its readership how the white press was often ignorant of Gilpin’s roots in Black theater, the article continued, “we took pride in pointing [his talent] out to our readers years before his opportunity came to appear before exacting audiences in a sphere far removed from that of 135th street.” Gilpin’s dramatic powers ensured his success as one of the leading Black actors during his day. Gilpin made The Emperor Jones—just as O’Neill’s drama made Gilpin. “They say there will never be another ‘Emperor Jones,’” hinted the Amsterdam News apocryphally. “They say that it made Charles Gilpin and that it will break him.”57 If Gilpin broke the color line with The Emperor Jones, it may be equally true that the play broke him—but not before he made his imprint forever on American theater and culture.\n\nOne bitter reality of racing the Great White Way was that even as actors broke color lines with O’Neill’s plays, Broadway, as an engine of American culture, was governed by entrenched racial hierarchies. This reality was articulated by a piece in the World in 1923: “The story of Gilpin of Emperor Jones who found that a Negro had freer opportunities as a Pullman porter than as a gifted actor, is the common experience of every Negro who aspires to a place in the theatre—certainly in the dramatic theatre.”58 When he was interviewed in 1921 for American Magazine, Gilpin reflected on the opportunityPage 31 → that Jones had afforded him, while also acknowledging the tenacious hold of Broadway’s racism:\n\nI am pleased; especially with the generous praise of the critics. But I don’t fool myself about the stone walls that are in my way. Mr. O’Neill made a breach in those walls by writing a play that had in it a serious dramatic role for a negro. The Provincetown Players gave me the chance to do the part. But—what next? If I were white, a dozen opportunities would come to me at once as a result of a success like this. But I’m black. It is no joke when I ask myself, “Where do I go from here?”59\n\nWhere did Gilpin go? One place was to the White House where he had a private audience with President Warren Harding in 1921.60 He also received the New York Drama League Award that same year for his work in The Emperor Jones, breaking the color line again, in not only being selected as outstanding actor but also in attending, and integrating, the banquet after initially being excluded (O’Neill had a hand in this as well, threatening to boycott the event unless Gilpin was invited).61 O’Neill remarked that Gilpin was one of “only three actors in my plays who managed to realize the characters . . . as I originally saw them.”62 But given these accolades, what was Gilpin to do once “The Emperor Jones has run its course,” as the New York Amsterdam News put it?63 There were so few roles for African American actors, Gilpin needed a new play “with a great Negro part, and even the casual observer knows how rare these plays are.”64 The plays were indeed rare. And so, The Emperor Jones continued to be revived.\n\nIn spite of paying his dues on the road for years, Gilpin was not asked to revive The Emperor Jones in 1924. Instead, the role was handed to Paul Robeson while he was rehearsing All God’s Chillun Got Wings. Gilpin’s legacy of racing Broadway became intertwined with Robeson’s: the two actors performed the role of Brutus Jones in tandem for over a decade, each in different productions, but always moving along intersecting cartographies. Gilpin on Broadway, Robeson in Harlem. Gilpin on tour, Robeson in the Village. Gilpin touring again, Robeson in England. Gilpin directing his own production, Robeson performing spiritual recitals. Gilpin dead at an early age, Robeson filming The Emperor Jones.65 Step by step, year by year, the two artists performed the role his own way. Again and again, The Emperor Jones became the vehicle for African American actors to race Broadway during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s.\n\nRobeson’s encounter with The Emperor Jones forever changed the history Page 32 →of American theater. His collaborations with O’Neill and the Provincetown Players, uneasy as they may have been, as Glenda E. Gill points out, sutured his rise to fame.66 These roles “positioned Robeson not only as a new celebrity, but also as firmly located within the avant-garde of American theatre,” observes Tony Perucci.67 Robeson’s long-standing performance of Brutus Jones prepared him to perform other Black emperors throughout his career, constituting what we might call a polyptych of Black diasporic performance culture constituted by two plays (The Emperor Jones and Toussaint Louverture) and two films (The Emperor Jones, 1933, directed by Dudley Murphy; and Song of Freedom, 1936, directed by J. Elder Wills).\n\nWhen Robeson took over the portrayal of Brutus Jones in 1924, he was extensively compared to Gilpin.68 The headline for John Corbin’s 1924 New York Times review made this clear: “Paul Robeson Triumphs in Role Made Famous by Gilpin.”69 Comparisons were often made between the two actors, for, as Marvin Carlson reminds us, former actors and productions often haunt the stage.70 Gilpin not only haunted the role of Brutus Jones but also stalked it, for he was in the audience on the opening night for Robeson’s revival. Strangely, only the New York Post mentioned this fact: “The chief interest in the present production lies, of course, in a comparison of the skill of the new ‘Emperor’ and the creator of the title part, Charles Gilpin, who was in the audience to witness the debut of his successor.”71 Robeson’s wife, Eslanda (Essie), made the following note in her diary from opening night: “Performance really fine. Gilpin was there and he and O’Neill quarreled . . . after play.”72 The New York Post declared Robeson “the New Emperor,” but Gilpin was plotting his directorial debut.73\n\nSuch judgments of the two actors often focused on their physicality. While many reviews pointed out Gilpin’s small stature and even baldness, many more obsessed on Robeson’s “vigor” and “virility.”74 Just as Gilpin faded away into obscurity, so Robeson was blown out of proportion. This discourse about Robeson’s embodiment can be seen as a manifestation of racializing projections and anxieties regarding Black masculinity. “The black body,” Harvey Young writes, is “an abstracted and imagined figure” that “shadows or doubles the real one. It is the Black body and not a particular, flesh-and-blood body that is the target of a racializing projection.”75 Such projections infused the reviews for The Emperor Jones, which almost obsessively described Robeson’s “Black body,” overshadowing not only white characters in the play but also whiteness itself. For example, the New York Morning World noted in 1924 that Robeson was “a fine figure of a man, possessor of an extraordinary and enviable physique and a deep, resonant voice.”76 The review goes on to remark upon Robeson’s boxer-like build: Page 33 →“Mr. Robeson was thrice called before the curtain to receive the cheers and applause of the house. He presented such a figure in a checkered bathrobe, that one might have been pardoned for wondering just what he’d do to [boxer] Harry Willis.”77 The peculiar reference to what lurked underneath Robeson’s bathrobe reveals the reviewer’s desire in more way than one. Robeson was not only bursting out of his bathrobe; he could not be contained by prevailing discourse either. “Big and robust” is what the New York World called Robeson.78 A London reviewer referred to Robeson as “a negro actor of immense height and capability.”79 As another London review put it, “This actor has been dowered with a physique which fills the eye like a bronze of noble period.”80 Still another critic praised Robeson, “whose physique is as magnificent as his acting.”81 Most illustrations overemphasized Robeson’s magnitude, making him appear like a goliath, dwarfing a cowering Smithers, the pathetic white colonizer of the play. Several headlines referred to Robeson literally as a giant (for example, “Giant Negro Actor” and “Giant Negro-Actor and His Ambition to Sing”).82 Another headline was all about numbers: “6 ft. 4 in. Negro Actor’s Triumph.”83 Lloyd L. Brown sums it up well: “There was always a largeness about Paul Robeson.”84\n\nOf course, Robeson was large, but hardly a giant. The point was not just that Robeson was tall and muscular—but rather that there was a largeness about his Blackness. As the caption to one illustration put it (“Oh, the Black and White of It”), Robeson’s performance of Brutus Jones subverted racialized dichotomies underpinning regimes of race. In other words, these examples demonstrate not the enormity of Robeson’s physicality, but rather the immense power of racializing fantasies projected onto Robeson’s Black body, which seemed larger than life itself. Such projections were not new, however. As Jeffrey C. Stewart points out, “the racial coding of Robeson’s body size had begun long before he played Emperor Jones in 1924.”85 In fact, as a Rutgers’ football star, Robeson was billed as a “Colored Giant” on a game flier. Whereas on the football field Robeson’s “largeness” was seen as beneficial, in American public spheres it was another matter. “Throughout the plays that Robeson acts in during the 1920s,” Stewart continues, “his particular body comes to signify the gargantuan threat of the Black body to civilization.”86 Robeson was, moreover, conscious of his physicality, which he understood as both an asset and a limitation.\n\nAlthough Robeson was sometimes depicted in his Emperor’s coat in the role of Brutus Jones, on stage and in film he ended up shirtless by the end of the story. As Callens has shown, “the racial coding of Robeson’s naked (upper) body” while playing Brutus Jones was inscribed “within a racializedPage 34 → representational practice” that played upon numerous primitivist discourses.87 The charge of primitivism in The Emperor Jones (and other O’Neill works) is a well-articulated critique, one that I examine in more detail in chapter 5. What is important for my argument here is how Robeson negotiated the signifying force of racializing projections. Stewart writes:\n\nThat Robeson could play both the primitive and the dangerous Negro, embody the fantasy and the fear of the Negro, suggests one reason for his enormous popularity with white audiences of the period. He, wittingly or not, became a site for the doubleness of white consciousness about the Black male body in the 1920s—that it was both a site of rejection and identification, both completely Other and one’s Self.88\n\nRobeson had his array of admirers, including the arts patron and white slummer Carl Van Vechten and the raconteur of Harlem, Alexander Gumby, both of whom devoted pages in their scrapbooks to Robeson with their own sort of queer fandom.\n\nPut another way, Robeson embodied the modernist tensions inscribed onto Black men that Hazel V. Carby discusses in Race Men. Insofar as being “a Black national symbol of masculinity,” Carby writes, “Robeson combined, in uneasy stasis and for a brief period of time, the historically contradictory elements of race, nation, and masculinity.”89 I would argue that The Emperor Jones was central to Robeson embodying these modernist contradictions, and moreover that the theater allowed him the opportunity to literally perform them. Within the context of Black internationalism and representations of Black empire, Robeson’s Brutus Jones embodied these contradictions across the circum-Atlantic. In many ways his performative interventions worked against O’Neill’s portrait of a Black failed despot, “inspir[ing] just the right type of fear of masculine savagery and repression that civilization hopefully tamed and ensured against,” as Michelle Ann Stephens has put it.90 These dichotomous tensions become visible in some of the publicity images. In a 1924 production photo from The Emperor Jones, Robeson is “still standing,” to use Harvey Young’s formation, returning the gaze back at the viewer, challenging efforts to interpolate or contain him.91 In such publicity photos, Robeson is in character as both the belligerent Brutus Jones and a radicalized citizen. The glaring stare challenges the spectator, anticipating the iconic Edward Steichen photo of the filmic Brutus Jones (see chapter 5).\n\nRobeson’s assumption of the Emperor’s throne was not planned as a Page 35 →full-fledged revival, and it occurred after he had already turned the role down in 1920. The 1924 staging of The Emperor Jones was, rather, a last-minute strategy to deal with the crisis brought on by All God’s Chillun Got Wings, O’Neill’s semi-expressionistic portrait of interracial desire. For nearly two decades, Robeson performed the part of Brutus Jones. As Robeson said in 1924, “This is undoubtedly one of ‘the great American plays’—a true classic of drama, American or otherwise. . . . And what a great part is ‘Brutus Jones’.”92 In fact, The Emperor Jones was a performative anchor to Robeson’s career, a play he repeatedly revived throughout the U.S. and Europe in various iterations for years.\n\nWhile much has been written about how Gilpin edited the script by excising offensive language, little has been noted about how Robeson made his editorial (which is to say dramaturgical) mark on The Emperor Jones. From the very beginning, Robeson added spirituals and work songs to the play, part of his larger vision of promoting Black music throughout U.S. culture. O’Neill reflected upon Robeson’s contributions in a letter to his lawyer, Harry Weinberger: “In the last production of ‘Jones’ at P. P. we Page 36 →introduced music. Robeson sang parts of John Henry, chain gang song, also (I think) a swatch of spiritual.”93 O’Neill’s memory about this is not only inaccurate, but also revisionist—“we” didn’t add the songs, but rather Robeson did. Robeson’s contributions were far from musical ornamentation; his inclusions of spirituals and work songs shaped the very contours of O’Neill’s play by performatively referencing slavery and Black performance culture.94 Robeson was racing The Emperor Jones. After the Provincetown Playhouse production in 1924, The Emperor Jones was revived and transferred to Broadway at the Punch and Judy Theatre with Robeson in the title role. One critic remarked, “‘The Emperor Jones’ still has not exhausted its appeal”; nor would it, for dozens of years to come.95\n\nIn transatlantic productions, Robeson’s Emperor Jones continued to disrupt racial hierarchies on stage. Robeson brought Londoners their first production of The Emperor Jones in 1925 at the Ambassadors Theatre, which “held a large audience spellbound.”96 As Robeson “towered over the egregious Smithers,” observed one London review, “it was hard to formulate any theory of white supremacy.”97 The accolades belonged to Robeson, who “received a great ovation at the close.”98 Another review agreed: “The acting of Mr. Paul Robeson was superb. . . . His voice is one of the finest I have ever heard.”99 While generally positively reviewed, the British coverage of The Emperor Jones was also plagued by primitivism, as was the case in the U.S. The London Observer lamented, for instance, that Robeson’s portrayal “was too intellectual.” What they wanted instead, as they blatantly put it, was “a more primitive performance.”100 Other critics perceived Robeson’s Brutus Jones as a regal monarch, calling him the “king of a ‘Black’ island.”101 Such accounts offer a different set of reactions to Stephens’s dismissal of The Emperor Jones as “making fun of the idea of black self-determination,” by instead perceiving Robeson’s Brutus Jones as an intellectual sovereign.102 As the London production was ending its run, one headline blamed “Gloomy O’Neill” for its closure, but London audiences were looking forward to seeing Robeson’s proposed recitals of Black spirituals.103\n\nIncreasingly, Robeson reshaped The Emperor Jones to showcase Black agency as well as the legacy of slavery. For a 1930 London production, Robeson essentially rewrote the script by focusing on the songs and performing just the first part of the play—in effect focusing on Jones’s ascent, not his demise.104 Next, Robeson traveled to Berlin’s Künstlertheater with a 1930 production that reviewers called “an achievement for American theatre” and a “succès d’estime.”105 Publicity photos from the German production included the rarely shown Middle Passage slave ship scene—a segmentPage 37 → that would be cut in the 1933 feature film, also starring Robeson. Robeson’s transatlantic Brutus Jones thus performatively summoned circum-Atlantic history and Black internationalism.\n\nWith later productions stateside, Robeson added other innovations, molding his Brutus Jones to fit the cultural political moment and to speak back to white power. After being absent from the American stage for seven years, the role he chose for his comeback was Brutus Jones. In this 1939 revival, Robeson made a significant change, observes Paul Robeson Jr.: “Paul eliminated the word ‘n——r’ throughout after having announced in several interviews that he intended to do so.”106 Robeson’s important excision of the n-word has not received the scholarly attention it deserves. And yet it belongs to a long history of Robeson racing American theater and culture through O’Neill’s plays. This well-received production in 1939 once again opened the doors to future work, including the musical John Henry and the lead in Othello. Photos for this production reveal another intervention: Robeson is wearing a cowboy hat and a studded holster. Performed mostly in summer stock theater, Robeson retooled this Brutus Jones for Page 39 →Depression era audiences. Gone are visual references to Haitian revolutionaries (Toussaint Louverture, Guillaume Sam, Henri Christophe) or Black nationalists (Marcus Garvey). Brutus Jones had been remade as a quintessential American icon.\n\nFrom 1939 to 1941, Robeson performed several summer stock productions of The Emperor Jones on the East Coast, experimenting with sound and adding Black diasporic performance practices. But first, Robeson needed O’Neill’s permission for the changes. In a 1940 telegram to his agent Richard (Dick) Madden, O’Neill wrote: “TELL PAUL ROBESON IT IS ALL RIGHT EXPERIMENT SOUND EFFECTS EMPEROR JONES BUT TO WATCH IT CAREFULLY. TOO MUCH OF THAT STUFF CAN ATTRACT TOO MUCH ATTENTION AND RUIN BOTH HIS ACTING AND THE PLAY.”107 What O’Neill misunderstood is that Robeson’s musical experimentation (or “that stuff,” as O’Neill put it) did not “ruin” the play, but rather augmented it—just as Robeson’s changes had added complexity in the film version. That same summer Robeson performed The Emperor Jones in the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey; at Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pennsylvania; and in the Theatre Guild’s production at Country Playhouse in Westport, Connecticut.108 The Guild production is especially intriguing, for it offered a circum-Atlantic perspective by incorporating music from Africa, Bali, and Martinique.109 Robeson concluded the year by performing excerpts of the operatic version of The Emperor Jones with the Philadelphia Orchestra.110 The summer of 1941 found Robeson yet again performing his “old role,” as the New York Times put it, appearing at the Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts; the Ivoryton Playhouse in Essex, Connecticut; the Spa Theatre in Saratoga Springs, New York; and at Marblehead’s North Shore Players.111 Toggling between concert tours and summer stock with The Emperor Jones, Robeson was crafting a political repertoire built upon the Emperor’s remains.\n\nRobeson’s Performative Diptych\n\nToussaint Louverture: The Story of the Only Successful Slave Revolt in History, staged in London in 1936. Indeed, the roles of Brutus Jones and Toussaint Louverture constitute a diptych of Black diasporic performances that were central to Robeson’s repertoire. As a Haitian revolutionary, Toussaint Louverture remains one of the most significant Black heroes to be represented on the Page 40 →stage. Robeson easily stepped into the role as Louverture, having performed Brutus Jones for over a decade, thus tracing a performative trajectory from O’Neill to James.\n\nWhile The Emperor Jones portrayed a despotic ruler who is overthrown by the Indigenous people over whom he briefly ruled, Toussaint Louverture dramatized a Black diasporic icon who spearheaded the Haitian Revolution. The 1936 production sought to “tell the whole history of the Haitian Revolution, of international imperial rivalry, of the emergence of a revolutionary consciousness, and of the creation of both a nation and a people,” observes Laurent Dubois in his foreword to the play.112 As Christian Høgsbjerg notes in his introduction, Toussaint Louverture marked “the first time Black professional actors starred on the British stage in a play written by a Black playwright,” and it was “the only play in which Robeson appeared that was written by a writer of African heritage.”113 Written by Trinidadian-born British playwright James in 1934 (building upon his work in The Black Jacobins) and rediscovered in 2012, Toussaint Louverture was performed on March 15 and 16 in 1936 at Westminster Theatre, under the aegis of the London Stage Society.\n\nRobeson as Toussaint Louverture was haunted by Robeson as Brutus Jones, summoning ghostly traces from theater’s “memory machine,” as Marvin Carlson has put it.114 (Indeed, I came upon Robeson’s performance of Toussaint Louverture because the Museum of the City of New York mislabeled the publicity photograph as being from The Emperor Jones.) Increasingly, Brutus Jones and Toussaint Louverture blurred into one another, demonstrating the performative citationality between representations of Black diasporic power and what Roach has called genealogies of performance throughout the circum-Atlantic.115\n\nRobeson’s emperors cemented his authority as a cultural regnant, opening up a circum-Atlantic critique of imperial power. Much of this impression was achieved by the magnitude of Robeson himself, as a “thinking, fighting body engaged in the world,” as Shana L. Redmond characterizes him, as well as onstage.116 From the start, Robeson’s Brutus Jones had flash, citing Black diasporic power. In 1924, when he assumed the role, Robeson wore a light-colored, military style tailor-made jacket with gilded epaulettes and fringe, gold braiding, chevrons, brass buttons, and embroidered details on the sleeves. This was a departure from the heavy, dark mid-thigh-length coat that Gilpin had worn, which had almost no trim or medals (with the exception of the CSA buckle). Robeson’s costumes became increasingly ornamental and militaristic, citing emperors across the Black diaspora. Later, as Toussaint Louverture, the “Negro Napoleon,” as one Page 42 →caption described him, Robeson wore a French blue emperor jacket, plus a Napoleonic hat.117 Production photos no longer show Brutus Jones’s gun, but rather now Louverture’s sword, substituting early twentieth-century technology with that of the early nineteenth.\n\nIn addition to both productions featuring magnetic Robeson portraying powerful rulers, there were other similarities that evoked diasporic performance culture. To begin, both plays take place on Caribbean isles.118 For O’Neill, the island has not yet been colonized by Americans, whereas for James, the plot centers on the colonization—and enslavement—of Black people, as well as fighting back against that oppression. Furthermore, both plays were created during the time of the ill-fated U.S. occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934. There are, moreover, citations of The Emperor Jones’s West Indian forested setting in Toussaint Louverture.119 Whereas in The Emperor Jones, the forest is the space in which Jones encounters hallucinations of his past misdeeds, as well as collective re-memories of slavery and the Middle Passage, in Toussaint Louverture the forest ignites the revolution. Rather than the site of repentance and ultimate demise (as with The Emperor Jones), the forest in Toussaint Louverture fosters a successful revolt. Moreover, and, importantly, both plays incorporated African drums for dramatic effect. Drumming was a signature element in The Emperor Jones, set to the tempo of the human heartbeat once the islanders pursue Jones in the jungle.120 Yet, drumming signifies differently in each play: whereas in The Emperor Jones it underscores the islanders’ hunting their deposed emperor, in Toussaint Louverture it signifies power, rebellion, and revolution. Given this use of drumming, it seems likely that James was citing iconic elements of O’Neill’s play with Robeson at the helm.121 One important distinction had to do with casting: while The Emperor Jones utilized blackface for some of the minor roles (depending on the production), Toussaint Louverture employed a remarkable cast of professional Black actors “drawn from across the African diaspora.”122\n\nIn addition, both plays included scenes with Robeson singing spirituals. It seems likely that Robeson was the one who added these songs, for the scripts do not mention them, and he had altered scripts before by inserting African American music. Robeson had incorporated the work ballads “John Henry” and “Water Boy” in both the stage and film versions of The Emperor Jones to anchor the text within the context of forced Black labor and the music that resisted such captivity. In Toussaint Louverture, Robeson incorporated at least one spiritual during the emotional scene before Louverture dies. As one newspaper put it, “A little ‘spiritual,’ beautifully sung by Mr. Robeson in the prison scene, gave a refreshing touch of naturalness.”123\n\nPage 43 →As a performer of the Emperor’s remains, Robeson embodied what we might call a diasporic stature. As with the coverage of The Emperor Jones, the British press once again emphasized Robeson’s size. The Times in London observed, for instance, Robeson’s “gigantic vitality.”124 Robeson was repeatedly referred to as a ruler, general, or king, shattering previous conceptions of Black masculinity and leadership. Collapsing the difference between the roles he played on and off stage, one headline called Robeson a “negro leader.”125 Another review observed the synergies between Robeson’s activism and the roles he played on stage: “The play must have been a great pleasure for Paul Robeson to act, for Toussaint’s opinion on the necessity of Black people being educated has always been a plank in his platform.”126 Still another noted, “It is a noble character nobly played with all the actor’s resonance and dignity.”127\n\nMoreover, while he was staging Toussaint Louverture in London, Robeson was gearing up to film Song of Freedom (directed by J. Elder Wills), in which Robeson portrayed Zinga, a British opera singer who returns to an Page 44 →island off the west coast of Africa to eventually become king. Tellingly, one of the musical numbers from Song of Freedom is called “The Black Emperor,” yet another performative citation of The Emperor Jones.128\n\nCrucially, Robeson had planned to include Toussaint Louverture—along with The Emperor Jones—as part of his anticipated repertory theater in London.129 The Negro Star reported that Robeson “declared he wants particularly Negro plays by Negro playwrights as previously such drama has been written almost exclusively by whites.”130 In a piece called “I Want Negro Culture,” Robeson wrote that the theater should be “the first step” in “winning freedom” over oppression. Through theater, he maintained, “we aim to win world recognition for negro productions and so help the negro back to self-respect. I intend shortly to launch this theatre in the West End.”131 Robeson did not propose to limit the repertoire only to Black theater (hence O’Neill is included in his plan), but he did have his sights on a mix of European classics, “plays calling for a mixed cast,” along with “purely African plays.”132 Robeson never formed the theater, likely due to the financial pressures of the Depression.\n\nAnd what of his Emperor’s remains? In Robeson’s front-page obituary in the New York Times in 1976, his roles as Brutus Jones and Toussaint Louverture were both mentioned as standout performances.133 The Chicago Defender wrote, “It is easy to understand why Paul Robeson is the most beloved and greatest of [the] artists we have produced. Robeson is an artist-fighter for Negro America. Robeson is more than an ambassador for his people. He sings for freedom.”134 Robeson’s embodiment of both “artist-fighter” was co-terminus with performing Brutus Jones."
