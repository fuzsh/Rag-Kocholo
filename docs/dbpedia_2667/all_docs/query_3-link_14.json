        "text": "5. George Dyer (Dier) of Dorchester, Suffolk MA (c1579-1672)\n\nNew England - 1630\n\n© Researched in America and compiled by Ann Weiner - Aug 2015\n\nGeorge Dyer is believed to have gone to Dorchester MA on the Mary and John in 1630 with his family. No list of passengers exists for this voyage, but he is known to be in Dorchester MA in 1630. He came “as one of several gentlemen , middle- aged with adult families” on the Mary and John that were dropped at Nantasket Point (present day Hull) and left to shift for themselves (15,17)\n\nThere is a possibility that George Dyer was in New England prior to 1630. In May, 1641, George Dyer provided a letter of attorney to Thomas Purchase, of Pejepscot Maine (7). According to John Gould, a Maine historian and author, in a letter to Paul Trescott, “Thomas engaged in the fur trade, then lucrative, supposedly with Way [George Way] as his partner. Later, he, or they, along with George Dyer, who arrived in 1630 on a later voyage of the Mary and John, owned extensive timberlands in Maine and young William Triscott was their surveyor. One account says Dyer came over in 1628, cased the joint, returned to England and came back in 1630 with others.” (8)\n\nIn Dorchester, MA we find frequent occurrences of George Dyer in the city record that indicate a healthy roll as a citizen of the town (3,4,5) On Sept. 28, 1630, we have Dyer sitting on the court of Assizes. He became a freeman of the town May 18, 1631. He was made a constable in 1632. He was a grantor of Dorchester lands in 1633. He was a Dorchester selectman in 1636 and 1637. He was a fence viewer many times in 1636 - 1668, usually for the field behind “Mr. Mathers”, wherein he is once referred to as “Goodman Dier”. He served on a committee to lay out land in 1637 and a committee to set the tax rate in 1636. On Feb 7, 1640, he signed an agreement of the proprietors of Thompson’s Island who relinquished the island to the town of Dorchester in order to raise funds for the maintenance of a free school.\n\nA reading of the history of the town of Dorchester reveals an interesting life of the puritans there. Weekly meetings at the meeting house, decisions regarding land distribution, concerns for food and stores, encounters with the local Indians, and responsibilities of “fence viewing” to keep the cattle where they should be, were common tasks and responsibilities in which George Dyer must have participated. Some of these activities would have contrasted greatly with the life experienced previously in Dorset.\n\nThere is some confusion as to the wife or wives of George Dyer. Savage claims he traveled on the Mary and John with wife Elizabeth (1). But there appears to be no record of an Elizabeth, wife of George Dyer, in Dorchester, MA. There is speculation that Elizabeth Dyer, George’s daughter, has been confused as his wife. She and her sister Mary are both believed to have been with George on the voyage of the Mary and John (probably based on their calculated ages, which would place their births in England).\n\nThere is, however, evidence of a wife Abigail. In 1636, George Dyer and Abigail signed anew the covenant of the church of Dorchester, MA (3). Unfortunately, this is the only record for Abigail that is known.\n\nFurthermore, there is some evidence that George Dyer married again, though no subsequent marriage record is known. In his will of 1672, George bequeaths his looms to James White, whom he names as “his loving son-in-law”. This bequest confirms George’s occupation as a weaver. This will also names his two known daughters, Elizabeth, the wife of William Trescott, and Mary, the wife of William Pond. (10)\n\nJames White was the son of Edward White and Martha King White, of Dorchester, MA who arrived aboard the Abigail on June 22, 1635 as part of the Winthrop fleet. Edward and Martha were from Cranbrook, Kent where they were sworn for the voyage (10). The date of death for Edward White is unknown. The last known record for him is a bequeath in the will of John Bigg, of Cranbrook, Kent, Aug. 17, 1640 which occurs after the birth of his known children. If his death is early enough, then the naming of James White as “son-in-law” in George Dyer’s will possibly means “step-son”, after a later marriage of Martha White to George Dyer . The possibility of James White having married an unknown daughter of George Dyer is unlikely due to the marriage of James to Sarah Baker who was not a daughter of Dyer.\n\nPaul Trescott notes in his genealogy of William Trescott, that both Elizabeth Trescott and Mary Pond named daughters Martha, and that this “may be a clue” as to the wife or wives of George Dyer (8). However, both daughters also named children Abigail and Elizabeth, though the latter named children may be possibly named for Elizabeth Dyer Trescott, a daughter, and not a wife of George Dyer. This information does not help resolve the possibility that George had a first wife Elizabeth. Martha Trescott was born Jan 8, 1661. Martha Pond was born Feb. 17 1657/58. So a marriage of Martha White to George Dyer , if it occurred, might have been possible after 1642/43 , the last known records of Abigail Dyer and Edward White, and before 1657/58 when Mary Pond names a child Martha. Unfortunately, vital records for Dorchester are scant between 1646 and 1657, the period in question.\n\n6. Information regarding George Dyer’s children\n\n6.1 - Elizabeth Dyer /Trescott (ca. 1625 – July 31, 1699)\n\nWilliam Trescott “took hold of the covenant” of the first church of Dorchester, MA, Nov. 27, 1642. In 1643 is made a freeman of Dorchester, MA. On May 10, of the same year William married Elizabeth Dyer. Their children were born in Dorchester, MA and were (8):\n\nSamuel, b. Nov 4, 1646, Dorchester MA,m. Margaret Rogers, daughter of Jeremiah Sr. and Mehitable (Pierce) Rogers.\n\nMary, b. April 23, 1649, Dorchester MA, m.

John Withington’s Co. in 1690, probably lost at sea. Abigail m2. 1692 as his second wife, Jeremiah Rogers, son of Jeremiah Jr. and Abiah (Pierce) Rogers. Children born in Salem, MA.\n\nMartha, b. Jan 8, 1661 Dorchester, MA, m1. As his second wife Jacob Hewins,b. Feb 24, 1660/61 in Dorchester, MA, son of Jacob and Mary Hewins. Martha m2. As his second wife, Jan 10,1693/94, in Boston, Henry Adams.\n\nSarah, b. Sept. 13, 1662, Dorchester, MA, m1. In Dorchester, MA, Increase Moseley, b. 1662/63 in Dorchester MA, son of Thomas and Mary (Lawrence) Moseley, died on the expedition to Canada of Capt. John Withington’s Co. in 1690, lost at sea.\n\nJoseph, b. July, 1668, Dorchester, MA, m. Miriam _____? Joseph Trescott , drummer and signalman, died on the expedition to Canada of Capt. John Withington’s Co. in 1690, probably lost at sea.\n\nWilliam served as constable of Dorchester 1657-1658 and was also a tithingman, or tax collector. In 1659, a warrant was given him by the selectmen “to gather together parents and maisters that send their children ore servants to the free scole those sums that are on his list”. Boston records show William was paid 1L for “killing a woolfe” (8).\n\nWilliam may have been a surveyor. He is paid for “running the line” as part of a committee to lay out a cartway in 1666. Furthermore, William had a brother Thomas Trescott, mariner, with a wife Annie. William administered Thomas’s estate 1654 (8). Annie died later, also in 1654.\n\nWilliam and Elizabeth’s headstones in The Old North Burying Ground in Dorchester, MA have the following inscriptions:\n\n“Here Lyes Ye body of William Trescott Aged 85 years Dec’d Sept ye 11 1699”\n\nand\n\n“Elizabeth Trescott Ye Wife of William Trescott Aged 74 Years Dec’d July ye 30 1699”\n\nThese inscriptions give calculated birth dates of 1614 for William and 1625 for Elizabeth. These dates make William considerably older than Elizabeth.\n\nPaul Trescott found an interesting note regarding Elizabeth in Sewall’s Diary, December 17,1685, ‘One Trescot, an ancient woman of Dorchester, riding over the Neck, Tide being high her Horse drowned and she hardly saved; question whether she may live or not,’ . This undoubtedly refers to Elizabeth, wife of William Trescott, who survived the incident nearly 14 years (8,9).\n\nThrough Elizabeth and William Trescott's line, 2 descendents of George Dyer , Solon and Thomas Trescott, were Minutemen who responded to the Lexington alarm when Paul Revere rode. Their brother, Ebenezer joined them at the battle of Bunker Hill. This family has an impressive record for participation in the fight for independence as sailors and soldiers of Massachusetts in the American Revolution (8).\n\n6.2 - Mary Dyer / Pond ( – Feb. 16, 1710/11)\n\nMary Dyer married William Pond, the son of Robert Pond and Mary ____ of Groton, Suffolk, England. They were admitted to the 1st Church of Dorchester on Feb. 28, 1641/42. Sgt. William Pond was also a constable of Dorchester 1659, and a tax assessor in 1662, 1667, and 1675.\n\nRobert Pond and his brother John arrived in New England in 1630, perhaps with Gov. John Winthrop, Jr. , who was also of Groton. In a letter from Gov. Winthrop to his eldest son at home in Groton, shortly after his arrival in New England, he directs his son to “tell old Pond that both his sons are well and remember their duty” (13). [The relationship of the Pond and Winthrop families may originate from the second marriage of Joan Burton Winthrop to John Ponder (d. 1520), after the demise of Adam Winthrop of Lavenham and Groton, Suffolk, England (14)].\n\nChildren of Mary and William Pond are:\n\nAbigail , c. Mar 19 1646/47, Dorchester, MA, wife of Ezra Clapp, d. Oct. 12, 1682, Milton, MA.\n\nSamuel, c. Mar 16, 1655/56, Dorchester, MA, d. Oct 2, 1657, Dorchester, MA.\n\nElizabeth, b.

Jan 20, 1665/66, Dorchester, MA.\n\nMindwell, b. Aug 24, 1667, Dorchester, MA.\n\nMary, c. July 19, 1668, Dorchester, MA.\n\n6. James White (1637/38 – Nov. 7, 1713)\n\nJames White of Dorchester, MA, was a weaver based on the will of George Dyer who bequeaths him his looms and instruments and names him his “son-in-law”. He was the son of Edward and Martha White of Dorchester, MA. Edward White was a husbandman, based on his immigration record. Martha White is believed to have remarried to George Dyer.\n\nJames married Sarah Baker, daughter of Richard Baker and Faith Withington , Feb. 22 , 1664 in Dorchester, MA. Faith was related to Capt. John Withington who lost so many at sea on their expedition to Canada in 1690, including several of Elizabeth Dyer Trescott’s family. [This expedition was made by Sir William Phips against the French in order to enlarge the English dominions in America by taking Quebec. Unfortunately, bad weather and contrary winds sank ships and caused delays which ultimately ended the expedition in failure.]\n\nJames White’s brother John White married Mary Swift, daughter of Thomas Swift, a son-in-law of Bernard Capen.\n\nChildren for James White are:\n\nExperience, b. Dorchester, MA\n\nSarah, b. Sept 8 1665, Dorchester, MA\n\nThankful, b. June 18, 1667, Dorchester, MA\n\nIchabod, b. April 16, 1669, Dorchester, MA\n\nJohn, b.

Aug 4, 1683, Dorchester, MA\n\nEbenezer, b. July 3, 1685, Dorchester, MA\n\nA headstone inscription for James White also exists in the Old North Burying ground. It reads,\n\n“Here lyes the body of James White Aged 76 years Dyed November the 11th 1713”.\n\n7. Will of George Dyer (Dyer)\n\nDorchester MA vital records contains a notice of the death of William Dyer, June 18 1672 “being the 93rd year of his age”. This record is attributed to George Dyer being conveniently recorded between the making and proving of his will, and no William Dyer being known in Dorchester at the time.\n\nThe will of George Dyer is dated December 31, 1671 and proved August 2, 1672. In it he bequeaths to “his beloved daughter Elisabeth the wife of William Trescot & unto her heirs forever all my dwelling house, outhouses, barn, yard, orchard together with my houselot and meadow adjoining to it unto the Salt Creek,” also “my meadows in the Calves Pasture”, also “five acres of my planting land at the Great Neck, the lot I bought of John Pierce to be part of it & made up five acres out of my lot adjoining,” also “half of my great lot both within fence and without”, also “all my division beyond Neponset River on the south side”; to “my beloved daughter Mary the wife of William Pond & to her heirs forever a piece of marsh lying between two salt creeks commonly called the old harbor,” also “my piece of meadow lying at the entrance into the Great Neck, together with all the rest of my upland within the Great Neck, together with all the rest of my upland within the Great Neck not before given,” also “half my great lot within the fence and without,” also “my last division on the north side of Neponset”; daughter Mary to have half of the grass or profit therefrom from the meadow adjoining the houselot for five years; any lands remaining in common, whether divided or undivided, to be equally divided between the two daughters abovementioned; to “my loving son-in-law James White of Dorchester my looms for weaving with all the utensils thereunto belonging in case he the said James will make use of them in the said work”; “all the household goods to daughter Elizabeth, except linen, which is to be equally divided between Elizabeth and Mary”; “my two acres of salt marsh that lyeth near the Mill Creek near Roxbury being part of a division I have sold to James White before mentioned & received satisfaction to content & given him possession; sons-in-law William Trescot and William Pond to be executers and pay debts and funeral expenses”.(10)\n\nHis inventory was taken June 29, 1672. It totaled L425 4s. 6d, of which L370 was real estate: “the housing , barn, orchard, houselot and meadow at the end of Salt Creek, “ L100; “two acres of meadow on the other side of the creek,” L14; “six acres of meadow in the Calves Pasture Meadows,” L60; “a piece of meadow at the north of the Great Neck,” L30; “eleven acres or thereabouts of upland at the Great Neck,” L46; “at the great lots be sides what’s disposed of at each end before,” L80; “the 2d & 3d [divisions] in the Cowwalks, 10 acres or thereabouts,” L15; “the last division on the north side of the Naponset, 29 acres or thereabouts,” L20; and “common beyond the Blue Hills,” no value given.(10)\n\nOther Family\n\nGeorge Dyer is mentioned in the will of Bernard Capen, who died in 1638 in Dorchester, MA. In Capen’s will, he is mentioned as “brother George Dyer”(11). Certainly, there is a close association between Bernard Capen’s family and George Dyer’s. Both originated from Dorchester, Dorset, England. Bernard Capen’s wife Joan Purchase Capen is believed to be a sister of Thomas Purchase of Pejepscot Maine, and Sarah Purchase, the wife of George Way of Dorchester, Dorset, England, mentioned above. Bernard and Joan Capen and some of their children are buried in the Old North Burying ground in Dorchester, MA, as is Elizabeth and William Trescott, and James White. How George Dyer is a “brother” of Bernard Capen, though, is unknown.\n\nInteresting Historical Note:\n\nOn December 24, 1994, a vessel was discovered in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Anse Auz Bouleaux. This ship was identified as part of Capt. William Phipps fleet lost on his expedition to Canada in 1690.\n\nThe identification was made due to the recovery of two artifacts. The first was a musket bearing the initials “CT”. The second was a pewter porringer, which had on it’s handle three initials positioned in a triangle: M, I, and S. The position of the letters indicated the owner of the porringer had initials “IM” and his wife “SM”. Research revealed the initials of the musket to belong to Cornelius Tileston. The porringer initials identified its owner as Increase Moseley who’s wife was Sarah Moseley [Sarah Trescott Moseley]. Thus, the ship was identified as holding a company of men from Dorchester, MA. (16)\n\nIncrease Moseley was a grandson-in-law of George Dyer.\n\nSources:\n\nJames Savage, Genealogical Dictionary of the First Settlers of New England, (Boston, 1860-62 repr Baltimore, 1965).\n\nDorchester Births, Marriages, and Deaths, 21st Report Boston Commissioners (Boston, 1890).\n\nRecords of the First Church At Dorchester in New England, 1636 - 1734 (Boston, 1891)\n\nDorchester Town Records , by Dorchester, MA (Dorchester, Suffolk, MA)\n\n“History of the Town of Dorchester, MA”, by Dorchester Antiquarian and Historical Society (Dorchester and Boston, MA)\n\nMunicipal Records of the Borough of Dorchester Dorset, by Charles Herbert Mayo, Arthur William Gould (1908 Dorchester, Dorset, England) (George Dyer page 423)\n\nNote-book Kept by Thomas Lechford, Esq., Lawyer: In Boston, Massachusetts Bay, from June27, 1638, to July 29, 1641, by Thomas Lechford, James Hammond Trumbull, (1885, Boston,MA) pp 401-3\n\nPaul Trescott, “An Account of the ventures, adventures, and misadventures of William Trescott (1614/15 – 1699)\n\nThe Diary of Samuel Sewall, 1674-1729\n\nWill of George Dyer.
