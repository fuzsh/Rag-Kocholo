        "text": "Lukas was born on April 16, 1976 in West Hollywood, California. His Texas-born mother, Emily Tracy, is a writer, and his German-born father, Berthold Haas, is an artist. He has twin brothers, Simon and Nikolai. It's widely noted that Lukas was discovered at the age of five by casting director Margery Simkin while he was in kindergarten.\n\nWhile his first screen role was as the youngest of the doomed children in the 1983 nuclear Holocaust film Das letzte Testament (1983), it was his second appearance, in Der einzige Zeuge (1985) opposite Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis, that earned attention and acclaim. In Peter Weir's 1985 film, Lukas portrayed Samuel, an Amish child who was the sole witness to an undercover cop's murder, and his work earned him starring roles in such films as Die phantastische Reise ins Jenseits (1988), Der Hexenmeister (1988), and Alan & Naomi (1992) - the latter film co-written by his mother.\n\nHe continued to distinguish himself in film in starring roles including: Music Box - Die ganze Wahrheit (1989) with Jessica Lange and director Costa-Gavras; Convicts (1991) and Die Lust der schönen Rose (1991) (both with Robert Duvall); and Run Off (1996) with John C. Reilly and Winona Ryder.\n\nOn stage, in 1988, Lukas performed alongside Steve Martin and Robin Williams in Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\" at Lincoln Center in New York City for director Mike Nichols. He also starred with Martin in the film Der Schein-Heilige (1992).\n\nLukas went on to work with directors Woody Allen in Alle sagen: I love you (1996), Tim Burton in Mars Attacks! (1996), and Alan Rudolph in Breakfast of Champions - Frühstück für Helden (1999). He had a pivotal role in Brick (2005), Rian Johnson's directorial debut with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He next appeared in the Kurt Cobain-inspired Last Days (2005), directed by Gus Van Sant, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. Roles in Material Girls (2006), slasher movie send-up President Evil (2006), Who Loves the Sun (2006), Gardener of Eden (2007), While She Was Out (2008), and Death in Love (2008) followed.\n\nRecently, Lukas had a supporting role in Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010) opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, Elliot Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Caine and Marion Cotillard. He then appeared in Red Riding Hood - Unter dem Wolfsmond (2011) for director Catherine Hardwicke, and Contraband (2012), director Baltasar Kormákur's English-language remake of the movie he starred in, Reykjavík - Rotterdam: Tödliche Lieferung (2008).\n\nLukas was most recently seen in Crazy Eyes (2012). He has several projects in production, including Meth Head (2013) written and directed by Jane Clark.\n\nAlso a talented musician, Lukas plays drums and piano in the band The Rogues.\n\nBrooklyn-born Buddy Hackett was known mainly as a nightclub comic, especially in Las Vegas, where he first performed in 1952 and wound up being one of the biggest headliners in that city's history. Hackett always referred to himself as a \"saloon comic\" and preferred the intimacy of his stage act--where he would often bring members of the audience up on stage with him--to films and television. He, along with Lenny Bruce, pioneered \"blue\" comedy, although Hackett's career did not suffer nearly as much as Bruce's did because of it. Hackett's act was noted for its, at the time, \"adult\" content, and at one point he was sued by a woman who attended one of his shows and said she was \"shocked and offended\" at the language (she lost the suit). However, contrary to his nightclub image, Hackett's appearances in films were mostly of the family type, such as his roles in the \"Herbie\" series of comedies for Disney about a Volkswagen Bug with a mind of its own and as Robert Preston's sidekick in Music Man (1962). In 1954, Hackett was paired by Universal Pictures with Hugh O'Brian as a potential comedy team to replace the studio's reigning team of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, They actually did replace the famous team in the film Fireman Save My Child (1954), due to Costello's illness (Bud and Lou can still be glimpsed in long shots). Hackett took the part that Costello was playing (an eerie coincidence considering that more than 20 years later he would actually play Costello in the movie Bud and Lou (1978)) and O'Brian took Abbott's place, but the film was not successful and Universal dropped its plans to make a team out of the two. Hackett also had a showy part in the ensemble comedy Eine total, total verrückte Welt (1963), partnered with Mickey Rooney. However, despite his success in movies, he still preferred his nightclub work and played Las Vegas and clubs in other cities whenever possible. He had a reputation among his fellow comics as a brilliant ad-libber and someone who knew exactly how far to take a joke before it ran its course, something not all comedians managed to do.\n\nBuddy Hackett died at age 78 of natural causes at his beach house in Malibu, CA, on June 30, 2003.\n\nEugene Allen Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Ann Lydia Elizabeth (Gray) and Eugene Ezra Hackman, who operated a newspaper printing press. He is of Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry, partly by way of Canada, where his mother was born. After several moves, his family settled in Danville, Illinois. Gene grew up in a broken home, which he left at the age of sixteen for a hitch with the US Marines.\n\nMoving to New York after being discharged, he worked in a number of menial jobs before studying journalism and television production on the G.I. Bill at the University of Illinois. Hackman would be over 30 years old when he finally decided to take his chance at acting by enrolling at the Pasadena Playhouse. Legend says that Hackman and friend Dustin Hoffman were voted \"least likely to succeed.\"\n\nHackman next moved back to New York, where he worked in summer stock and off-Broadway. In 1964 he was cast as the young suitor in the Broadway play \"Any Wednesday.\" This role would lead to him being cast in the small role of Norman in Lilith (1964), starring Warren Beatty. When Beatty was casting for Bonnie und Clyde (1967), he cast Hackman as Buck Barrow, Clyde Barrow's brother. That role earned Hackman a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, an award for which he would again be nominated in Kein Lied für meinen Vater (1970). In 1972 he won the Oscar for his role as Detective Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in French Connection - Brennpunkt Brooklyn (1971). At 40 years old Hackman was a Hollywood star whose work would rise to new heights with Die heiße Spur (1975) and 700 Meilen westwärts (1975), or fall to new depths with Die Höllenfahrt der Poseidon (1972) and Eureka (1983). Hackman is a versatile actor who can play comedy (the blind man in Frankenstein Junior (1974)) or villainy (the evil Lex Luthor in Superman - Der Film (1978)). He is the doctor who puts his work above people in Extrem... mit allen Mitteln (1996) and the captain on the edge of nuclear destruction in Crimson Tide - In tiefster Gefahr (1995). After initially turning down the role of Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Erbarmungslos (1992), Hackman finally accepted it, as its different slant on the western interested him. For his performance he won the Oscar and Golden Globe and decided that he wasn't tired of westerns after all. He has since appeared in Geronimo - Das Blut Der Apachen (1993), Wyatt Earp - Das Leben einer Legende (1994), and Schneller als der Tod (1995).\n\nThe son of a legendary actress (Mary Martin) and a district attorney, Larry Martin Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas. After his parents' divorce, he moved to Los Angeles, California to live with his grandmother. When he was 12, his grandmother died and he moved back to his mother's place, who had remarried and was launching a Broadway career. After attending Bard College in New York State, he decided to follow his mother's acting road. His first stage tryout was with the Margo Jones Theatre-in-the-Round in Dallas, Texas. He then appeared in the New York City Center production of \"Taming the Shrew\", followed by a year in regional theater. In his early-to-mid twenties, Larry moved to England as a member of the cast of his mother's stage show, \"South Pacific\", and was a member of the cast for five years. After that, he enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he produced and directed several series for members of the service.\n\nAfter completing his service in the Air Force, Larry returned to New York City for a series of Broadway and off-Broadway plays, esp. \"Once Around the Block\", \"Career\", \"Comes a Day\", \"A Priest in the House\", \"The Beauty Part\", \"The Warm Peninsula\", \"The Nervous Set\" among many others. He began his television career in 1961 with a number of guest appearances on shows as \"The ALCOA Hour\". He was later chosen to be in the popular daytime soap opera The Edge of Night (1956), in which he starred for two years. But that was his start, he later went on to become the friendliest television star in the NBC sitcom Bezaubernde Jeannie (1965), in which he played the amiable astronaut Anthony Nelson. In the series, his life was endangered by this gorgeous blonde bombshell genie played by Barbara Eden. The series ran for five years and after that, he continued his success in Ein herrliches Leben (1971) and Here We Go Again (1973), as well as a number of guest-starring roles on many series. He was also with Lauren Bacall in the television version of the hit Broadway musical Applause (1973).\n\nIn 1977, the soap opera Dallas (1978) came aboard and Larry's career was secured. He credits \"Superchick\" for convincing him to do the show. This program of an excessively rich Texas family, was one of the best, beloved, most-watched shows of all time as he portrayed the role of the evil yet perverted millionaire J.R. Ewing, the man who loved to be hated. The series ran for an amazing 14 1/2 seasons and the \"Who shot J.R.?\" episode remains the second highly-rated television show in the history of the satellite. Since his name was familiar with Texas, it was suiting that he hosted \"Lone Star\" (1985), an eight-part documentary series related to the history of Texas, for the Public Television Stations. That aired while celebrating the 150th anniversary of Texas as an independent republic. In the spring of 1987, Kari-Lorimar released \"Larry Hagman--Stop Smoking for Life\". Proceeds from this home video were donated to the American Cancer Society.\n\nIn July 1995, he needed a liver transplant in order for him to regain his life back after years of strong drinking that led to cirrhosis. He went over to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for this where he spent seven weeks in the hospital, and an operation took 16 hours but saved his life. In July 1996, one year after he had a new liver, he served as the National Spokesperson for the 1996 U.S. Transplant Games presented by the National Kidney Foundation and, on November 2, he later received the Award for his efforts in escalating public awareness of the concept of organ donation. He continued to serve as an advocate of organ donation and transplantation until his death. In November 1996, he starred in Dallas - J.R. kehrt zurück (1996), a 2-hour movie in which the ratings were a huge success for CBS, as well as in the network's drama series New Orleans - Das Gesetz des Südens (1997) when his role of Judge Luther Charbonnet gave him some of the best reviews of his 36-year-career.\n\nWhen he was feeling better than he had for so many years, he completed his two movie projects: Der dritte Zwilling (1997), a four-hour miniseries based on the author's best-selling novel, that aired on CBS, and Mike Nichols's Mit aller Macht (1998), a film based on the best-selling book by a journalist, Joe Klein. Starring in that film were John Travolta, Emma Thompson, Billy Bob Thornton, Kathy Bates and Adrian Lester. Larry played Governor Picker, an antipolitics politician who stands a grave danger crisis to the governor's bid for office. Primary Colors was his second presidential film having also appeared in Oliver Stone's Nixon - Der Untergang eines Präsidenten (1995). Following these movies, his second Dallas reunion movie, Dallas - Kampf bis aufs Messer (1998), aired on CBS. He also served as executive producer.\n\nAway from films, Larry was actively involved in a series of civic and philanthropic events. An adamant non-smoker, he served as the chairperson of the American Cancer Society's \"Great American Smokeout\", from 1981 to 1992. Larry Hagman died at age 81 on November 23, 2012 at Medical City Dallas Hospital in Dallas, Texas from complications of throat cancer."
