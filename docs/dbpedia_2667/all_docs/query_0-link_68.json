        "text": "Ancestry:\n\n16th Century Grade II listed Manor Farm House\n\nSteven WHITE was born in Stanton St John Oxfordshire in the manor house shown above and is listed by Rose Troup(3) as being the third son of John WHITE Senior(1550-1618) by his wife Isabel BAWLE (1552-1601). There is no hard evidence that I can find relating to his actual date of birth as the parish registers for Stanton St John only survive from 1654 and the Bishops Transcripts from 1738. The Visitation of Hampshire (4) which was started in 1622 and completed in 1634 records the Family Pedigree of his brother John WHITE of Dorchester and this confirms that Josias WHITE (c1573-1622/3) was the eldest son. Josias age comes from his university record which states that he matriculated at New College Oxford on 10th Feb 1592/3 aged 20 years so he was born around February 1572/3. His brother John WHITE of Dorchester has a more helpful university record stating that he was actually baptised at Stanton St John on the 6th January 1574/5 so it is a reasonable assumption that John was their second son and Stephen the third and for the purposes of this review I have assumed therefore that Stephen was born around the year 1576. For more background on his ancestry and upbringing see his brother John White's biography via this link.\n\nUniversity: Given his family background I might have expected Stephen to have attended College at Oxford but I have not been able to trace an entry there(1). Instead his father appears to have sent him at an early age to be one of the first protestant students at Emmanuel College in Cambridge as there is a record for a Stephen WHITE entering the college on 1st April 1589. Unfortunately it does not state his age which, if we have his birth right, would have been around 13 years. Whilst young, this was not that unusual and there is a relevant example within the family as his elder brother Josias sent his son (Josias junior) to university aged 13. There are no other Stephen (Steven) White's recorded at Oxford or Cambridge and we know the family was staunchly protestant.\n\nEmmanuel College was by Oxford standards a newly formed institution being established in 1584 by <<<Sir Walter Mildmay (1520-1589) a man of puritan sympathies on the site of a former priory of the Dominican Order. It was specifically set up to provide training and education for protestant preachers to the same thoroughness as their Dominican predecessors. Both his elder brothers were licenced preachers. In 1584 Laurence Chaderton(1538-1640) >>> was made the first Master of Emmanuel College and he was still there when Stephen entered the university and when he was awarded a BA degree in 1592/3.(2) Although primed for priesthood like his elder brothers his father clearly saw him taking over the Manor and after his education he returned to Stanton St John to become enmeshed in the day to day running of their farm\n\nStephen's brother John WHITE (1575-1648) was appointed Rector of St Peters and Holy Trinity Churches in Dorchester in 1606 and his other brother Josiah WHITE (1573 -1622 ) was appointed vicar of Hornchurch in Essex in 1611.\n\nStephen then married Marie [Mary] WATERHOUSE signing a marriage settlement in 1614/15, and they were to have eight children together as shown below. With both elder brothers now settled in their livings within the church their father wrote his will on 30th September 1616 naming Stephen as sole executor and after a few relatively modest bequests became the main beneficiary of their fathers estate.\n\nHis father probably died a few months before Stephen proved the will at Oxford on 26th September 1618. In the will his father asked to be buried at Stanton St John where we already know parish registers have not survived prior to 1654. Along with his fathers estate he inherited the position as 'fermer' of the Manor at Stanton St John.\n\nHis brother Josias died in Feb 1622/3 and he and his brother John, became Overseers of his will. In 1624, in support of his brother John, Stephen became one of the original 119 investors in The Dorchester Company so his family was also involved in the New England project from the outset..\n\nI have now (Aug 2015) completed a full transcription of Stephen's will which is shown in the next section below. It was written on 13th November 1629 and proved on 15th February 1629/30. As can be seen his brother John White was the main executor, appearing in person in London before the County Court when probate was granted. After some modest bequests to his siblings, servants and the poor and Â£500 to his widow, the rest was set in trust for his children. As a result his widow Mary was persuaded by John White to move her family to Dorchester where he could more easily administer the trusts set up by her husband.\n\nStephen and Mary's children are all named in his will, and therefore still alive when he died at the end of 1629. He refers to Mary as his eldest daughter & then lists and deals with each child separately in what would appear to be order of birth. It was quite common to deal with male and female children separately under Wills because girls generally took their inheritance with them at marriage as a dowry or in the case of wealthy families under a signed marriage settlement. That is not what happened here with girls names before and after the boys even receiving the same legacies. If we assume his marriage was close to the date of his own marriage settlement in late 1614/5, and that the first of the births occurred about a year later, followed by the rest at regular intervals we have a range of children's ages between 1 and 14 years in late 1629. The three girls Martha, Elizabeth and Hanna and his son Stephen however do not then appear in the 1634 Pedigree given by John White in the Visitation of Hampshire. This may indicate that all four died as John specifically refers to Sarah as their 2nd daughter and Abigail their third. We have no way to confirm this as records for St Peters the most likely church for this period have not survived.\n\n(1) Marie [Mary] WHITE (c1616-1658) I think that Mary was not only the eldest daughter but the eldest child from their marriage and following tradition was named after her mother. If correct she was born about the spring of 1616 and moved with her mother to Dorchester shortly after her father's death in 1629. She married on 28th Feb 1639 to John WHITEWAY (1614-1679) who was the son of William Whiteway the elder (1570-1640) and brother of William Whiteway junior (1599-1635) the famous diarist(3,4,5). They had 4 sons ( William; Stephen; Samuel and Peter - Peter was the youngest of their children being born on 9th April and bap at St Peters 2 days later on 11 Apr 1658) and 2 daughters (Mary & Elizabeth). Mary Whiteway nee White was buried on 24 July 1658 in St Peters Churchyard in Dorchester. After her death William Whiteway re-married by licence on 9th July 1667 to Martha the daughter of Ralph Triplett a brewer of Thames Street in London. Probate of his will was granted on 9th Feb 1679 and mentions all six of his children.\n\n(2) Martha White born c1618, alive 1629, not listed in Visitation 1634? Thought to have died an infant?\n\n(3) Elizabeth White born c1620, alive 1629, not listed in Visitation 1634? Thought to have died an infant?\n\n(4) Hanna White born c1622, alive 1629, not listed in Visitation 1634? Thought to have died an infant?\n\n(5) John WHITE (c1623- aft 1667) - His biography suggests he was born circa 1620 but If Stephen White did list his children in order of age as I suspect, I think it would have been slightly later, around 1623. He would therefore have been about 7 years old when his father died and his father's will (transcribed below) left a trust for the 'training up' of his children. As Stephen's eldest son the lease of Manor Farm at Stanton St John descended to him. The trustee who held the lease thoughout much of the civil war period was John NIXON alderman of Oxford, a prominent parliamentarian and named in the will below.\n\nRoyalist troops were stationed in the village in 1643 and 1644 as part of the defence of Oxford against Parliamentarian forces to the east. In 1646 Parliamentarian forces occupied the village during the siege of Oxford and the rebuilding of the stable and barn roofs during 1646/8 may therefore indicate that the property suffered when vacated by the Royalists.\n\nApprenticeships could legally be entered into from the age of 7 and typically lasted for 7 or 10 years. It's not surprising therefore to find him apprenticed to a carpenter in Oxford called Mr Mawe. This almost certainly means that he never went to Dorchester with his mother and siblings. His biography suggests that this apprenticeship was for 7 years with John White seeking his freedom on 8th Aug 1637. For more information on his life access his biography via the link provided from which it will be seen that he eventually becomes Mayor Of Oxford in 1664. .\n\nIt also confirms that he married Mary the daughter of Alderman Thomas WEEKES gentleman of Oxon, who was the other trustee with John NIXON of his fathers will. John and Mary had two sons, one also called John White, around the late 1640's. Mary died on 30 June 1656 and was buried in the north aisle of St Ebbe's church where the inscription that was put on her monument described her husband John White as being of Stanton St John. He was probably the John White of Oxford, a widower aged about 34, who married on the 8 Feb 1661/2 to Ann daughter of Thomas BOULTON of St Christophers London, a spinster aged about 22. A John, perhaps a grandson, erected a monument in Stanton St John to his sister Ann Mann (d.1703).\n\n(6) Stephen White born c1625, alive 1629, not listed in Visitation 1634?

I notice that ''Rose Troup' who provides a summary of this will in her biography of the Rev John WHITE (i.e. 'John White : The Founder of Massachusetts' by Rose- Troup; published by GP Putnam's in 1930 - page 415) simply states 'Proved: 15 February 1629 (30) by Henry Wilkinson Clerk and John White Clerk'.\n\nMy reading of probate is that the will was proved in London before the Honourable Henry Martin, Doctor of Law of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, on the 15th day in the month of February in the year of our Lord 1629. Judgement appears to have been granted to all the executors named in the testament as it then lists all their names. Further on administration of his estate is granted to John WHITE the main executor who appeared before the court in person and a Richard Houch who also appears to have been a doctor of law and possible acting as a surrogate for the other executors\n\nGenealogical Notes:-\n\n(1).
