        "text": "Title: Hajimari no Natsu\n\nAlt name(s): The Beginning of Summer, I Just Love You (one shot)\n\nAuthor: ICHINOSE Ruka\n\nDemographic: Shoujo\n\nGenre: Romance, School\n\nVolumes: 1\n\n♡\n\nI remember this series being a refreshing and sweet story about a love triangle, told from multiple perspectives. I thought the art was pretty cute and I think I liked the characters.\n\nA Multi-Perspective Love Triangle\n\nShinji, Minabu and Chinatsu are childhood friends that do everything together. This has made playboy Shinji’s life complicated as he has been keeping a secret. He is in love with Chinatsu. Unfortunately, he can see that her eyes are focused on the sporty Minabu – who reciprocates those feelings.\n\nNone are willing to share their feelings out loud though. Out of respect and loyalty to each others friendships they hide their feelings.\n\nBasic Love Triangle then?\n\nHajimari no Natsu, is so sweet it’s a little sickening. Everyone respects and loves each other, it’s gross! Just joking… but all the characters are really nice and considerate and it bothered me (눈_눈)\n\nGo ahead call me heartless, I know it.\n\nIt was very short (3.5 chapters to be exact) but it had potential. I liked that each chapter was from a different perspective. I don’t think I’ve seen that form of story telling in a love triangle manga yet (at least from my memory, but we know that’s pretty shonky ^^;).\n\nI won’t be putting it on my recommended list though, there wasn’t enough meat for me to bite into, but if you feel like some short fluff give this a go.\n\nOn a side note I enjoyed the one shot that came at the end of the volume ‘I Just Love You’ – About a poem writing guy and a girl that starts noticing him. Oddly enough these characters felt more human, or maybe I just prefer my females not sugary sweet (×﹏×)\n\nTitle: Bus Hashiru\n\nAlt name(s): The Bus Takes You and Runs\n\nAuthor: YUMEKA Sumomo / SAHARA Mizu\n\nDemographic: Seinen\n\nGenre: Romance\n\nVolumes: 1\n\n♡ This series was added to my re-read list because I found it in a google doc I wrote titled “recommend these to people!”. So, that must have meant that I liked it ^^; it’s a collection of romantic one shots that take place on or around buses.\n\nBus go vroom\n\nWriting a summary for a series of one shots is hard so I’ll go with… People that take public transport experience love and connections.\n\nHeart go zoom\n\nI read this in about 10-15 minutes, so when I say it’s short. It’s short.\n\nI enjoyed the way the characters are drawn and I love the use of water colour in the opening pages, the artwork is very pleasing to look at.\n\nYumeka manages to tug at the heart strings in only a few pages, which is a difficult feat to accomplish, so props to them! Each story has their own version of love, often bittersweet, and I found myself thinking about what was next for each of the characters.\n\nOverall I enjoyed half of the one shots (can you guess which ones?) but I saw merit in all of them. Well worth 10 minutes of your time to read some endearing material, even if not all stories may grab you.\n\nTitle: Saiyuki\n\nAlt name(s): Saiyuuki, Gensomaden Saiyuki\n\nAuthor: MINEKURA Kazuya\n\nDemographic: Shounen\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy\n\nVolumes: 9\n\n♡ I wasn’t familiar with Journey to the West when I came across this series. I saw that one of the characters was called Son Goku, and I was a big Dragon Ball fan, so I read it ^^; I fell in love with Minekura’s art style, the way she draws her men *dreamy sigh*. I was obsessed with Sanzo, he’s still rated way up there in my favourite characters. Story-wise I don’t remember much. I hope this series holds up. I’m still waiting for it to finish…\n\nFour Hot Dudes Go West\n\nA mysterious malevolent energy is driving the Yokai (demons) insane. Humans are living in fear, and on top of that someone is trying to resurrect the great demon king Gyuu Maou.\n\nSurly but beautiful Buddhist priest Genjyo Sanzo is assigned with the task of heading West to stop the resurrection from occurring. With him are his posse – staff welding monkey boy Son Goku, definitely not a pig Cho Hakkai, and womanizer half-yokai Sha Gojyo.\n\nTogether they journey across the land in their dragon/jeep, meeting many friend and foe.\n\nDid I mention they’re attractive?\n\nI’m sitting here with a thesaurus open on ‘beautiful’ because I’m going to run out of words for how appealing I find Minekura’s artstyle. You might start the series and be like ‘girl’s got weird taste’ but let me show you how the style evolves.\n\nOn many occasions I found myself staring at each panel admiring the line work. Everyone is drawn with such splendor. Minekura has mastered the art of drawing a face let me tell you. I do need more than just pretty faces to get me through a series though, otherwise I would have liked Doubt!! (I didn’t, read about it here).\n\nIt’s a good thing then, that Saiyuki is more than just its looks.\n\nThe world premise is compelling – a mix of old and new, where magic and science co-exist. Our heroes ride around in a dragon turned Jeep Wrangler, drink Asahi and smoke Marlboros. Hakkai manipulates his chi to form barriers and heal the team, whilst our Priest opts for a pistol, it’s gorgeous.\n\nOur characters, on a surface level are tropes; the hungry one, the ladies man, the kind one, the irritable one. But as we get a glimpse into their pasts, we see they are also complex, flawed and oh so very broken. No’one in Saiyuki has had an easy life. Even minor characters we are introduced to have their own backstories and agendas, and I look forward to seeing how they will intertwine with the gang.\n\nAs for the source material, the extent of my knowledge is a wiki page, so I can’t really comment on how authentic Saiyuki is. To me, it looks like a loose interpretation that uses the characters. And even then Hakkai and Gojyo seem to have had a personality transplant. As with both works, Sanzo’s party are headed West and it’s going to take a long time (four more manga serializations in fact, yay!).\n\nSounds like you still liked it?\n\nFor the most part, definitely! There are times, particularly in the beginning of the series, where I did not understand what was going on, or who somebody was. I felt like I was missing information. Minekura does not spend time spelling things out for you. I think those familiar with the source material, or have an understanding of Buddhism mightn’t have this issue? It’s a minor grievance though, and didn’t really subtract from my enjoyment of the series, just something I thought worth mentioning if you feel a little lost in the beginning.\n\nThe female characters are nothing to write home about, nowhere near as much time dedicated to their stories as any of the men (not yet anyway). And there’s a couple counts of incest where I questioned it’s value to the narrative. It didn’t seem to serve a real purpose, other than to put me off lol.\n\nIn closing, I have wondered if I’d feel the same about this series if the characters weren’t all gorgeous. But I got to the end and stared wistfully at the ceiling, eager for more. So f*ck it, I had a good time! Saiyuki is going on my recommended list (b ᵔ▽ᵔ)b\n\nJust be warned the Saiyuki series as a whole is not finished. It continues into Saiyuki Gaiden, Saiyuki Reload, Saiyuki Reload Blast and Saiyuki Ibun. In the 9 volumes of Gensomaden Saiyuki, our heroes have barely started their journey. This is a long haul series and as I’m writing this, I’m still hanging out for the end game.\n\nTitle: Doubt!!\n\nAuthor: IZUMI Kaneyoshi\n\nDemographic: Shoujo\n\nGenre: Drama, Romance, School\n\nVolumes: 6\n\n♡\n\nI don’t remember much about Doubt!! I know it had something to do with becoming pretty? I have no expectations whatsoever…\n\nAverage Girl becomes a Pretty Girl\n\nAi Maekawa is a Jimi – acne prone, chubby, and unfashionable. In other words, she basic.\n\nWhen Ai’s anime-themed granny panties are exposed to her entire class, a mortified Ai declares she will start anew as a pretty girl. Through dieting, pimple cream and $50 underwear, Ai makes her high school debut as a hottie. She picks the first pretty boy to latch onto, and then whines a lot about how hard it is not being naturally pretty.\n\nYou’re not really selling it…\n\nI’m not trying to 😀 but I guess I’ll mention a positive. The art is beautiful. I really like how Izumi draws her characters. There’s something about their pouty lips and the swimming pool eyes, it’s just *muah* beautiful.\n\nOther than that, Doubt!! is an extremely shallow series. The biggest issue our MC faces is not being the prettiest girl in the room. My heart, it aches for her (< sarcasm). And if we haven’t learnt that beauty is paramount, let’s occasionally throw in some mean-spirited jabs to the uglier people that have confidence. Are you telling me only attractive people can be happy? I hope there’s a lesson here… tell me there’s a lesson here?\n\nI wanted to put it down after the first volume. Instead I persevered in the hopes that maybe it would improve.\n\nIt doesn’t.\n\nYou could argue that Doubt!!s message is that you need to work hard at being your most physically attractive self. And sure, I’m not disagreeing with that. But beauty is only skin deep and these characters aren’t pretty on the inside.\n\nDo yourself a favour, give this one a miss.\n\nTitle: Zettai Kareshi\n\nAlt name(s): Absolute Boyfriend, I Won’t Let You Become a Star!, Ohoshisama ni wa Sasemasen!, Aromatic Boy, Shounen Aromatic\n\nAuthor: WATASE Yuu\n\nDemographic: Shoujo\n\nGenre: Action, Comedy, Drama, Romance, School, Sci-Fi\n\nVolumes: 6\n\n♡ As soon as I added Zettai Kareshi to my list, I was so excited to start reading it that I couldn’t fall asleep. I don’t remember much about it, other than the premise and the ending, but I’m filled with butterflies thinking about it. My favourite character was Gaku and I was rooting for Soushi. I was sixteen when I first read it. Will I feel the same way more than a decade later?\n\nGirl buys robot boyfriend, pisses off neighbour.\n\nHigh schooler Riiko Izawa has non-existent boobs and a non-existent love life. Whether these two things are related, I find debatable, but every crush Riiko has ever had has been unrequited.\n\nRiiko is your typical Shoujo heroine; cute, slightly daft, and her whole world revolves around getting a boyfriend. I can’t fault her for that, at 16 that was also my life objective “Let’s validate our self worth through the acceptance of somebody else” *fist pump* (being a teenager sucked).\n\nAfter yet another rejection, Riiko meets Gaku Namikiri – a shady salesman who attempts to peddle his wares to her. Hesitant but desperate, Riiko asks for a boyfriend and well, our maiden ends up ordering a sex doll off the internet. Don’t worry, it’s a good deal, only One Hundred Million yen.\n\nNewly in-debt and desperate to keep her boy toy Night (she isn’t very creative, he’s named after his model number). Riiko signs up to become a Quality Assurance tester for the company that made him, Kronos Heaven.\n\nI’m making it sound much dirtier than it is, this ain’t no Chobits, it’s actually fairly PG.\n\nOf course, no Shoujo manga is complete without a love rival. We’re introduced to the childhood friend / next door neighbour, Soushi, who has been in love with Riiko since they were children. He’s smart, he’s athletic, he can cook.\n\nFor the span of 6 volumes, Riiko is conflicted between the two Bishounen. Who does she love? Will she lose her virginity? How much does robot maintenance cost? What else is there… That’s pretty much it…\n\nWell, does it hold up?\n\nThis is a tough one. I had such fond memories of the series when I was younger and such a different view of the series now! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻\n\nOverall, I still love the concept – what if a girl had a perfect robot boyfriend? There’s some great laugh out loud moments, and Watase’s artwork is gorgeous.\n\nZettai Kareshi’s downfall is its pacing and one dimensional characters.\n\nI couldn’t become emotionally invested in Riiko’s journey because I was whisked through it. Everything happens so fast! This is possibly exacerbated by me having read the whole series over a couple days, but even so.\n\nWatase had great potential story arcs, and although tropey AF, there are a few moments of genuine surprise. However, most conflicts are introduced and resolved in the same chapter, so they don’t have as much of an affect as they could have.\n\nOn the other end, there was too many chapters dedicated to a cat and mouse style storyline that felt like filler. This time could have been spent exploring the relationships of the characters. Maybe then would I have understood Riiko’s fence-sitting.\n\nMy second gripe, and it’s a big one, are the characters. All the men in Zettai Kareshi are forceful and manipulative. This is a romance manga, and I understand the heart tug of a surprise kiss, but a lot of the “romantic” situations were forced onto the heroine. Little came from her instigation or willingness, and it bothered me.\n\nI found Soushi to be a big baby that continually guilted and pressured Riiko into making a choice between himself or Night. These declarations often came at the most inopportune moments, which, although made me laugh at the absurdity of the timing, made me dislike his character even more.\n\nShady salesman Gaku, and to some extent Night, both pressured and expected Riiko to do something she wasn’t ready for. I say to some extent for Night, because he is a sex doll programmed to be forceful and a little perverted. The dude is a giant puppy dog otherwise, and I quite liked him.\n\nIf I go any further into the men of Zettai Kareshi, I’ll end up in spoiler territory, but yeah, they’re all questionable.\n\nAnd our heroine. Where do I even start with Riiko… Possibly the most infuriating of all. She was taken advantage of on multiple occasions, blamed or questioned herself and then kept these instances secret? Her behavior baffled me. I could not comprehend or relate to her.\n\nSo, would I recommend it? Look, it wasn’t a bad series. I was never bored reading it. It was all just a bit silly and I wanted more substance. I wanted to feel attached to the characters, but I couldn’t connect with them. Whether this is due to the storytelling or my age, I’m not too sure (^.^;). If you like your bishies forceful and your heroines painfully passive, give it a go and let me know!\n\nWith that being said, Zettai Kareshi hasn’t made it onto my recommended list 😦"
