        "text": "Month: September 2018\n\nFilm Friday- Flame of Recca\n\nFlame of Recca is a manga series written and illustrated by Nobuyuki Anzai, which was adapted into an anime series spanning forty-two episodes by Studio Pierrot. The series has also been adapted into two video games; Flame of Recca: The Game for the Game Boy Advance and Flame of Recca: Final Burning for the PlayStation 2. The anime has since been picked up by Discotek Media who re-released the series on DVD in 2015. Though it begins by following the same basic storyline, the Flame of Recca anime series ends right after the Ura Butō Satsujin ends, while the manga goes on to include the subplot involving the Tendō Jigoku. The anime also omits certain characters from the story, and several of the characters’ physical appearances are slightly different from the manga.\n\nAnime\n\nFlame of Recca was adapted into a 42-episode anime series produced by Studio Pierrot, and aired in Japan from July 19, 1997 to July 10, 1998 on Fuji Television. Flame of Recca was also aired on the satellite network Animax in Japan and Asia. Pony Canyon has released the entire series on DVD and laserdisc, while Geneon released it in two DVD boxsets on April 22 and June 24, 2005 in Japan. In North America, Viz Media released the series in ten separate DVD volumes between October 26, 2004 and January 9, 2007.\n\nThere are several notable differences between the anime and manga, such as the character designs (e.g. Fūko has purple-violet hair in the anime, but has brown hair in the manga) and in the storyline itself (e.g. In the anime, Yanagi’s healing powers are first revealed when she heals Recca after he gets injured while protecting her and a child from being crushed under metal pipes, but in the manga, Yanagi heals Recca when he gets injured while protecting her from a group of male students who were forcing her to go with them). The anime was aired in the Philippines by GMA Network in 1999.\n\nProtagonists\n\nRecca Hanabishi\n\nthe primary protagonist of the series, is a teenager obsessed with ninjas and anything related to ninjas. Recca was born the second son of Ōka, the leader of the Hokage ninja clan that existed over 400 years ago. Recca’s older half-brother, Kurei, was supposed to be the heir to the leadership because he was the eldest and was born with the ability to control fire, but Recca also exhibited the same abilities as an infant, and is declared the true heir of the Hokage leadership. In an attempt to save him during the slaughter of the Hokage ninja clan, his mother (Kagerō) used a forbidden technique that opened a portal that would transport him into the future, where the Flame of Recca storyline begins. Recca’s flame power is derived from eight Flame Dragons named Saiha, Nadare, Homura, Setsuna, Madoka, Rui, Kokuu, and Resshin. Recca’s powers were apparently so strong that they had to be sealed with a wrist guard. In the end, the eighth dragon Resshin (actually Recca’s father Ōka) reveals that Recca’s flame has no original form (something every Flame Master’s flame is supposed to have, such as Ōka’s and Kurei’s phoenix flame), thus Recca is the true cursed child, fated to end the Hokage. Ōka reveals that if Recca becomes the ninth dragon, he would become “a stupid, useless dragon with no ability whatsoever, a waste of space inside Kurei”. After the destruction of the Tendo Jigoku, every remaining madogu disintegrated to naught, as well as Recca and Kurei’s flame powers.His appearance varies slightly between the anime and manga, as in the manga, his hair has a red highlight and bright blue eyes, and in the anime his hair is a dull blue highlight and his eyes are a similar color.\n\nYanagi Sakoshita\n\nis a teenage girl gifted with the innate ability to heal any kind of physical injury, and Recca immediately offers to serve her as her loyal ninja after seeing her compassion when she healed a severely injured puppy in a local park (in the anime series, she heals Recca after a pile of metal pipes collapsed on top of him). She is the prime objective of the series’ main antagonist, Kōran Mori, as he believes that her healing powers will help him attain eternal life. In the manga, it is revealed that she is the reincarnation of Sakura-hime, the daughter of Oyakata and princess of Sawaki clan, who lived over 400 years before the series’ actual story-line.\n\nFūko Kirisawa\n\na tomboyish teenage girl, is Recca’s childhood friend who has always aspired to defeat him in battle so that he would serve her as her ninja. She initially gets irritated by the fact that Recca chose to become Yanagi’s ninja just because he wanted to. For this reason, she decides to accept the aid of Kagerō, who offers to lend her a powerful madōgu that controls wind called Fūjin in order to enable her to defeat Recca. In actuality, Kagerō implanted a stone in the Fūjin that allowed her to brainwash Fūko, but Recca manages to defeat Fūko and destroy the sphere. Fūko ends up being friends with both Yanagi and Recca after the incident, and she also keeps the Fūjin and wields it throughout the rest of the series.Fūko is often described as tomboyish by other characters, and is often laughed at or teased when she shows or says something sensitive or feminine. Fūko greatly respects human life, and hates those who take it for granted. This characteristic is shown on several occasions, the first being when one of her opponents, Fujimaru, states that he would do anything and kill anyone – even women and children – to achieve victory. Fūko’s character design varies in the adaptations of the series. While she has brown hair and green eyes in the manga and both of the Flame of Recca video games, she has red violet hair and blue eyes in the anime series.\n\nAntagonist\n\nKurei\n\nis Recca’s older half brother. He was born in 1571 (four years prior to Recca’s birth), and is the firstborn son of Flame Master Ōka and his mistress Reina. He was initially recognized as the next leader of the Hokage clan due to his innate flame powers, but the Hokage elders label him as a cursed child when his younger half-brother, Recca Hanabishi, also exhibits the same powers. Kurei was supposed to be killed in order to save the clan, but due to Kagerō’s intervention, Kurei and his mother are exiled instead. Kurei then eventually attempts to kill Recca, and ends up imprisoned for his crime. He eventually escapes the prison when it is destroyed during Oda Nobunaga’s raid on the Hokage village, and he jumps into the time portal Kagerō opened in order to save Recca by sending him into the future.Kurei is then found and adopted by Tsukino Mori, the wife of one of the series’ main antagonists, Kōran Mori. Kōran raises Kurei to become a “machine”, repeatedly telling him that he does not need human emotions and that he should just throw them away. Upon seeing how much Kurei loved his mother, Kōran has her transferred to a different house and keeps her under house arrest. When Kurei ends up falling in love with Kurenai, Kōran Mori’s adopted daughter, Kōran has her killed. This causes Kurei to despise his adoptive father, but since Kōran is holding his mother hostage, he obeys Kōran’s orders. Kurei is the leader of the Uruha, a group of skilled warriors hired to serve Kōran Mori and to assist Kurei in missions that Kōran orders him to undertake. Like his father and his half-brother, Kurei has the innate power to produce and manipulate fire. The main form of his flame is the Phoenix, and is shown to be of a different color compared to Recca’s (Kurei’s flames are purple in the anime series and a different shade of red in the Flame of Recca video games). Kurei has the ability to absorb souls into his flame, and use them to produce humanoid flames that fight for him and obey his commands. The first time Kurei absorbed a soul into his flame was when he absorbed Kurenai’s soul right after Kōran killed her. The second instance of this was when he absorbed the soul of a loyal member of the Uruha named Jisho (this is not shown in neither the anime nor the video games). His power is not limited to absorbing just one soul at a time, as shown by his absorption of several souls after an opponent slaughters many men in the latter part of the manga.Kurei is also capable of executing non-flame based techniques such as Wakemi, a technique that allows him to produce multiple, solid duplicates of himself that possess his powers and skills. In the last part of the manga, he is shown to be able to use the Jikuryūri, a technique that allows its user to open a portal in time.\n\nWednesday News- September 26, 2018\n\nFunimation Adds Ulysses, Goblin Slayer, Senran Kagura, Radiant anime to Fall Season Dub Lineup- https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-09-25/funimation-adds-ulysses-goblin-slayer-senran-kagura-radiant-anime-to-fall-season-dub-lineup/.137295\n\nPokemon GO Game Reveals All-New Mythical Pokemon Meltan- https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-09-25/pokemon-go-game-reveals-all-new-mythical-pokemon-meltan/.137282\n\nKill la Kill Game Reveals Story About Satsuki, Teases New Form- https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-09-25/kill-la-kill-game-reveals-story-about-satsuki-teases-new-form/.137280\n\nTomo-chan Is a Girl!

The manga was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Sunday from 1995 to 2002. The 329 chapters that composed the series were compiled into 33 tankōbon volumes by Shogakukan. Both the anime and manga were licensed for North American distribution in English by Viz Media. Jason Thompson, author of Manga: The Complete Guide, described the manga version of Flame of Recca as “polished and quick-paced”, and that it “reads like a more carefully plotted, more extreme version of YuYu Hakusho.” Patricia Duffield, a columnist for Animerica Extra, felt the story and artwork continuously evolved with characters and their unique weapons. “Although the series seems to have a tendency toward male fan service, Flame of Recca can be as enjoyable for gals as it is for guys.” Duffield concluded, “If lots of ninja action with supernatural flair interests you, give Flame of Recca a try.”\n\nManga\n\nThe Flame of Recca manga was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Sunday from 1995 to 2002, with a total of 329 chapters. The series was compiled into 33 tankōbon (collected volumes) and was published by Shogakukan from September 18, 1995 to April 18, 2002. Shōnen Sunday also released the manga in 17 wideban volumes and, beginning in 2010, as part of its Comic Bunko label. The manga was licensed for North American distribution in English by Viz Media and United Kingdom distribution in English by Gollancz Manga. Viz released all 33 volumes from July 30, 2003 to November 10, 2009, while Gollancz released ten volumes between March 6 and November 28, 2006. Viz did not censor nudity in their publications of the manga, but starting from volume 20, the female characters’ nipples have been removed.\n\nPlot\n\nFlame of Recca follows the story of a teenage boy named Recca Hanabishi, who is interested in ninja and claims to be one himself. He often gets into fights because he made it publicly known that the person who manages to defeat him will earn his services as a loyal ninja. Despite this, he eventually pledges his loyalty and services as a ninja to Yanagi Sakoshita, a girl with the innate ability to heal any wound/injury, because of her kindness and compassion. Recca soon discovers that he possesses the innate ability to control/manipulate flames, and eventually learns that he is actually the son of the sixth generation leader of the Hokage, a ninja clan that was wiped out by Oda Nobunaga in 1576, roughly 400 years before the series’ present day.\n\nThe Hokage ninjas wielded mystical objects called madōgu, which are referred to as “psychic devices” or “mystical weapons” in the English versions of the series. Madōgu grant their users special abilities, such as allowing their users to manipulate certain elements (as in the case of the Fūjin, which allows its wielder to manipulate the element of wind) and enhancing their user’s strength/skills (as in the case of the Dosei no Wa, which increases its user’s physical strength and the Idaten, which increases its user’s running speed). Oda Nobunaga had invaded the Hokage in 1576 for the purpose of acquiring these weapons, and the series’ main antagonist, Kōran Mori, is searching for a madōgu that will grant him eternal life. Recca and his friends become entangled in Mori’s quest for eternal life as he attempts to kidnap Yanagi, believing that her healing powers will help him achieve immortality. This leads them to join the Ura Butō Satsujin, a tournament wherein the warriors that wield madōgu gather to battle each other. After winning the tournament, Recca and his teammates discover that Mori was on his way to acquire the Tendō Jigoku, a madōgu said to grant its user eternal life, and once again attempt to stop him.\n\nFilm Friday- Banana Fish\n\nBanana Fish is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Akimi Yoshida. Serialized in Shōjo Comic from 1985 to 1994 and adapted into an anime television series in July 2018, the series follows Ash Lynx, a teenage gang leader in New York City. It takes its name from the J.D. Salinger short story “A Perfect Day for Bananafish”.\n\nIn October 2017, an anime adaptation was announced as part of Yoshida’s 40th anniversary commemoration project. Produced by MAPPA, the 24-episode series premiered on July 5, 2018 on Fuji TV’s Noitamina block in Japan, and Amazon Prime Video internationally. The production staff includes Hiroko Utsumi as director, Hiroshi Seko as script supervisor, and Akemi Hayashi as character designer. The adaption revises the setting of the series from the 1980s to the present day, adding modern references such as smartphones, and substituting the Vietnam War with the Iraq War. The opening theme is “found & lost” by Survive Said The Prophet, while the ending theme is “Prayer X” by King Gnu.\n\nMain characters\n\nAsh Lynx\n\nThe alias of Aslan Jade Callenreese, a seventeen-year-old leader of a gang of teenagers in New York City.

Serialized in Shōjo Comic from 1985 to 1994 and adapted into an anime television series in July 2018, the series follows Ash Lynx, a teenage gang leader in New York City. It takes its name from the J.D. Salinger short story “A Perfect Day for Bananafish.\n\nBanana Fish was first published in May 1985 in a supplementary issue of Shōjo Comic, and ran until April 1994. The series was collected in Japan as nineteen tankōbon and eleven bunkobon published by Shogakukan, who also published an official art book titled Angel Eyes, as well as Rebirth: The Banana Fish Official Guidebook.\n\nNorth American publisher VIZ Media licensed two editions of an English-language translation. The first, published from 1999 to 2002 and spanning the first seven volumes, features flipped artwork and censors some expletives. The second, published from 2004 to 2007 and spanning the full 19 volumes, is printed in the original right-to-left format and includes a re-translated script. The series was additionally printed in both of Viz’s now defunct manga magazines, Pulp and Animerica Extra. In 2018, shortly after the release of the anime adaption of Banana Fish, Viz announced plans to reprint the series.\n\nSide stories\n\nA total of five side stories were published. In Japan, these stories were collected in a single bunkobon titled Another Story, while the 19th volume of the VIZ Media English-language translation includes Angel Eyes and Garden of Light.\n\nFly Boy in the Sky\n\nOriginally published in 1984 — a year before Banana Fish was first published — Fly Boy in the Sky tells the story of how Ibe and Eiji met. During a high jump competition, Eiji attempts and fails a complicated jump. Ibe, watching a televised broadcast, is impressed by the performance but notices that Eiji appears to be depressed. Ibe seeks out Eiji to interview him, and to photograph his jumps for an exhibit.\n\nDuring the interview, Eiji opens up about how he has fallen into a professional slump. When Ibe asks Eiji about why he looks sad when he competes, he responds that it is because he feels nothing when he jumps. Upon viewing the photos Ibe has taken of Eiji’s jump, both men observe that what Eiji is really feeling is a sense of weightlessness; Ibe remarks that the bliss on Eiji’s face looks like a “home run ball up in the sky.”\n\nUra Banana\n\nA comedic fourth wall-breaking story, where Ash and Eiji discuss fan mail the series has received with creator Akimi Yoshida.\n\nPrivate Opinion\n\nA prequel that tells the story of how Blanca and Ash met. Golzine, seeking a private tutor to break Ash’s rebellious streak, blackmails Blanca into taking Ash under his tutelage. Initially, Blanca is convinced that Ash is too violent and unruly to be trained. When he encounters Ash after he has been beaten and sexually assaulted by one of Golzine’s men, Blanca decides that he will protect Ash by teaching him how to fight. Blanca concludes that Ash’s ruthless streak stems from having been deprived of love and that only through finding love will his true potential be unlocked.\n\nAngel Eyes\n\nA prequel that tells the story of how Ash and Shorter Wong met. Ash is admitted to juvenile prison when Golzine refuses to post his bail, where he is made cellmates with Shorter. Shortly after Ash’s arrival, rumors begin to circulate that Arthur has placed an assassin in the prison. Shorter suspects the assassin to be Ash, after observing him single-handedly fighting off Ricardo and Frankie, two prisoners seemingly targeting Ash for prison rape. Ash tells Shorter that he knew Frankie was an assassin sent by Arthur to kill him; knowing that being under the protection of another inmate would complicate any attempt on his life, Ash had sex with Ricardo to force Frankie to make a move. When Shorter tells Ash that his manipulation makes him no better than the people he hates, Ash lashes out, though the incident prompts him to open up to Shorter. When Shorter is released from prison several months later, Ash happily bids him goodbye as a friend; Shorter notes that it was the first time that he ever saw Ash laugh and that Ash’s face when he smiled was “angelic.”\n\nGarden of Light\n\nA postscript set seven years the events of Banana Fish, Garden of Light follows Akira Ibe, the niece of Shunichi Ibe, as she visits New York City. She stays with Eiji, now an accomplished photographer living in Greenwich Village, as he prepares for a major gallery show. Eiji has remained close friends with Sing, now a student at CUNY who continues to run the Chinese mafia with Yut-Lung. While viewing Eiji’s photo albums, Akira notes that there are multiple missing pictures marked with the letter “A”. Akira learns that these are photos of Ash, and is told the story of Ash’s death and his relationship with Eiji. Eiji takes his photographs of Ash out of storage and places a portrait of Ash in his gallery show.\n\nPlot\n\nThe main story of Banana Fish consists of six parts, published across 19 volumes:\n\n“Prologue” (volume 1)\n\n“The Mystery of Banana Fish” (volumes 1–6)\n\n“Ash’s Counterattack” (volumes 7–11)\n\n“The Return of Golzine” (volumes 12–14)\n\n“The Final Battle” (volumes 15–18)\n\n“Epilogue” (volumes 18–19)\n\nPart 1: Prologue\n\nDuring the Vietnam War in 1973, American soldier Griffin Callenreese fires on his own squadron in a dazed frenzy. He is subdued when Max Glenreed, a friend and fellow soldier, shoots him in the legs; as Griffin collapses, he speaks the words “banana fish.”\n\nPart 2: The Mystery of Banana Fish\n\n12 years later, Griffin — now severely mentally handicapped — is cared for by his younger brother Ash, the leader of a gang of street kids in New York City. One night, Ash encounters a mortally wounded man who gives him a vial of an unknown substance and an address in California; the man utters the words “banana fish” before dying.\n\nAsh begins to investigate “banana fish,” though he is impeded by Dino Golzine, a Corsican mob boss who had groomed Ash as a sex slave and heir to his criminal empire. In the course of his investigation, Ash acquires several allies: Eiji Okumura and Shunichi Ibe, who have traveled from Japan to report on street gangs; Shorter Wong, a gang leader who controls Chinatown; and Max Glenreed, who Ash encounters in prison while detained on a false murder charge. When Griffin is shot and killed in a fight with Golzine’s men, the group sets out to solve the mystery of “banana fish” together.\n\nAsh and his allies travel to the address in California, finding a mansion occupied by a man revealed to be Yut-Lung Lee, the youngest son of China’s largest crime family. They later encounter the home’s true occupant: a doctor who informs them that “banana fish” is an untraceable drug that brainwashes its users. Golzine intends to sell the drug to the United States government, which seeks to use it to overthrow communist governments in South America. The group is subsequently captured by Golzine’s men, who inject Shorter with banana fish and instruct him to kill Eiji. When Shorter begs Ash to kill him in a moment of lucidity, Ash fatally shoots him.\n\nPart 3: Ash’s Counterattack\n\nThe group, with assistance from Ash’s and Shorter’s gangs, escape Golzine’s compound. Ash uses stock manipulation to destroy the value Golzine’s legitimate businesses and withdraws $50 million from their accounts, making it appear as though Golzine has embezzled the money. Golzine is forced to leave the United States to answer to his superiors in France.\n\nIn the power vacuum created by Golzine’s absence, Ash secures promises of neutrality from Cain Blood, the boss of Harlem’s street gangs, and Sing Soo-Ling, who has taken over the Chinatown gang. He begins to methodically take out the Corsican-affiliated street gangs, emerging victorious but gravely wounded in a final battle. He is placed in a psychiatric facility for treatment, which is revealed to be funded by the Unione Corse, who fake Ash’s death so they may use him as a test subject to observe the effects of banana fish on a live brain. Ash is able to escape from the facility, just as Golzine returns from Europe to reassert control of the Corsican mob.\n\nPart 4: The Return of Golzine\n\nYut-Lung, having used banana fish to put his older brother in a vegetative state, enters into an alliance with Golzine. Yut-Lung eliminates Golzine’s co-conspirators in the banana fish project, while Golzine eliminates the other members of the Lee family syndicate, making the two men the de facto leaders of the Corsican and Chinese mobs.\n\nGolzine and Yut-Lung contract Blanca, a retired assassin who trained Ash, and threaten to kill Eiji unless Ash returns to Golzine and ends his investigation of banana fish. Ash agrees to their terms, accepting that he cannot defeat Blanca, and is reunited with Golzine as his advisor and legally-adopted son. At a party thrown by Golzine, Ash is rescued by Eiji, with the support of Sing’s, Cain’s, and Ash’s gangs.\n\nPart 5: The Final Battle\n\nAsh retreats to the American Museum of Natural History, though Eiji and multiple members of Ash’s gang are captured in the ensuing chase. Ash captures Yut-Lung and releases him in return for the freedom of the hostages.\n\nAsh and his allies later repel an assault by Eduardo Foxx, a mercenary hired by Golzine, though multiple members of their gang are captured. The group tracks the prisoners to the psychiatric facility where Ash was previously imprisoned. In a climactic battle, Foxx and Golzine are killed, and all evidence of the banana fish project is destroyed.\n\nPart 6: Epilogue\n\nMax publishes an investigation of Golzine’s child sex ring in Newsweek, prompting a massive scandal in Washington that implicates multiple politicians.\n\nSing convinces Yut-Lung to end his pursuit of Eiji and Ash. The two agree to work together to reassert control of Chinatown.\n\nAsh, wracked with guilt over the violence he has exposed Eiji to, ceases contact with him. Eiji and Ibe return to Japan, though just before his departure, Eiji entrusts a letter for Ash to Sing. In the letter, Eiji says that while he understands why they can no longer see each other, “my soul is always with you.” While distracted by the letter, Ash is stabbed by Lao Yen-Thai, Sing’s lieutenant who never forgave Ash for killing Shorter Wong. Ash dies, smiling and clutching Eiji’s letter.\n\nFilm Friday- Sorcerer Stabber Orphen\n\nThe Sorcerous Stabber Orphen anime series was produced by TBS/Bandai and first released in Japan in 1999, then in North America on DVD by ADV Films in 2001. It features a combination of a fantasy setting, action and gag comedy. It is 24 episodes in length.\n\nA second series called Sorcerous Stabber Orphen 2: Revenge, or Orphen Revenge was later broadcast. The second anime series was released on DVD in North America in December 2003 by ADV Films. It is 23 episodes in length. In 2009, Sentai Filmworks released a box set featuring the two seasons of Orphen in an economic box set.\n\nA new TV anime adaptation has been announced to commemorate the series’ 25th anniversary.\n\nVideo game\n\nA single player console role-playing video game was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2000 by Kadokawa Shoten in Japan as Sorcerous Stabber Orphen and by Activision in North America and Europe as Orphen: Scion of Sorcery. It included a whole new adventure and a few video scenes with more sophistication but a minor difference in the voices and personalities of the characters. Reviews of the game were mixed.\n\nSupporting characters\n\nAzalie Cait Sith\n\nis Orphen’s foster sister, best friend – and the Bloody August. They were in the same orphanage and came to the Tower of Fang together, believed to be magical prodigies. She tutored him extensively, and gave him special attention. She was a great sorcerer – considered to be one of the greatest in her generation, and is referred to as the “Demon Sorceress” by some at the Tower. However, she had two sides to her. There was the kind, loving Azalie, and then the, as Orphen says, “scary” Azalie. After having her love declaration to her mentor rejected, she seemed to be almost obsessed with her studies; she wanted more power, and one of her experiments turned her into Bloody August – a name given to the dragon that first appeared in August. In the novels, Azalie is returned to a human state fairly early in the series, but her mind has been warped by her time spent as the beast and the cruelties endured by those in the Tower who had been hunting her. Vengeful, her main goal is to destroy the Tower, which leads her to becoming a major antagonist in the series. She becomes increasingly unstable and Orphen is often torn between his attachment to her and his horror at her remorseless violence.\n\nLeki\n\nis a cub who is found and adopted by Cleao, although perhaps it could be said that Leki adopted Cleao, as adult Deep Dragons are more powerful and intelligent by far than humans. Like all Deep Dragons, Leki resembles a wolf rather than a reptilian dragon, and when he uses his innate powers, his eyes will glow a bright green color. As Leki is still very young, he often exhibits young animal-like tendencies, such as chasing after a butterfly. He protects and defends Cleao whenever he feels the need to, or when Cleao orders him. She’s very good to him; in fact, Cleao often treats him better than her two male companions, Orphen and Majic. Leki will not only protect Cleao, but anyone who he sees in danger. In the first anime, Leki’s collar belongs to one of the three artifacts from the Aisle of Balthanders, the Bracelet of Nomafrozis. In the novel, Leki is eventually able to use telepathy to speak with his human companions and released Cleao’s hidden magical potential by linking his mind with hers. Throughout the novel series, Leki grows from a small cub to the size of a large dog.\n\nVolkan\n\nIs one of the two short-statured brothers who follow along with Orphen on his quest. He frequently refers to himself the “Masmaturian Bulldog”. Volkan always comes up with their plans (which usually turn out to be poorly thought out, utterly bad ideas, and almost never work). He hates Orphen (whom he refers to as “the black wizard”) and his companions, and always finds a way to ruin whatever they had in mind. It is his fault that Orphen often must use his magic on them to make them go away (himself and Dortin). Volkan wants only power and money. Any scheme he has in mind has the end result of getting him one of the two. None of his schemes ever work, however. He constantly bosses Dortin around in a very comical fashion.\n\nDortin\n\nIs Volkan’s younger brother. Dortin and Volkan are often viewed as comic relief throughout the series. They are two trolls who are always low on money, and seem to always find a way to mess up whatever Orphen is trying to accomplish. They work in Cleao’s basement, cutting up food and whatnot; she is their employer. In regards to his character, Dortin is the voice of reason (that is never paid any attention to) on his and Volkan’s quests. He is kind and knowledgeable, but his swirling glasses give him a rather geekish appearance. When Volkan messes up, Dortin always tries to tell Orphen he had no part in Volkan’s schemes, but they both wind up being victims of Orphen’s magical blasts anyway. Dortin is shown to be quite caring and loyal, as he begs Orphen for help in saving his brother from mushroom poisoning and, later, in defying Volkan’s “order” to run from danger when a friend needed his help.\n\nWednesday News- September 12, 2018\n\nHirō Nakamichi’s Hōkago Saikoro Club Manga Gets TV Anime- https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-09-11/hiro-nakamichi-hokago-saikoro-club-manga-gets-tv-anime/.136524\n\nReview: Love Me, My Knight GNs 1-2- https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/love-me-my-knight-gns-1-2/.135771\n\nIDOLiSH 7 DUO Re:vale Gets 1st Full Album- https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2018-09-11/idolish-7-duo-re-vale-gets-1st-full-album/.136641\n\nJoshi Kausei Comedy Manga Gets TV Anime in 2009- https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-09-11/joshi-kausei-comedy-manga-gets-tv-anime-in-2019/.136635\n\nThe Last Remnant Remastered Game Announced for December With Video (Update)- https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-09-11/the-last-remnant-remastered-game-announced-for-december-with-video/.136633\n\nAnime\n\nAction Heroine Cheer Fruits BD\n\nAOKANA: Four Rhythm Across the Blue BD\n\nThe Garden of Sinners Box Set BD\n\nReLIFE Classics BD\n\nTokyo Ghoul Season 1 Classics BD\n\nVatican Miracle Examiner BD\n\nYona of the Dawn Complete Series BD\n\nManga\n\nThe Ancient Magus’ Bride GN 9\n\nD-Frag!

The novel series spanned 13 volumes between 1996–2003, which were published the same way as the first series.\n\nAs of late 2012, T.O Entertainment have released a brand new series of the Majutsushi Orphen Haguretabi novels. Orphen is now older and is married to Cleao, both of whom give birth to three daughters that become Sorcerers. Majic is a Sorcerer lecturer at the new school that Orphen runs. Orphen is known as the “Demon King” due to his exploits in the original novels. The books are published in a standard version and also a special edition version which comes with a behind the scenes booklet about the book and a Drama CD which is based on the new novel series itself. The original Orphen novel series received a reprint as well.\n\nThe Slayers vs. Orphen novel was a special collaborative novel between Yoshinobu Akita and Hajime Kanzaka and was published in 2005. It was later reprinted in 2013.\n\nDuring their panel at Anime Expo 2018, J-Novel Club announced that they have licensed the light novels.\n\nMain characters\n\nOrphen\n\nis known for his arrogance, gruff demeanor, short temper, and near-obsessive drive to finish what he is working on as soon as possible without distraction. He also strives to remain stoic and detached from others save his closest friends and allies. However, he has a strong sense of humanity and even though he will complain, he will not abandon a person in need nor tolerate the slaughter of innocent. He is partly an anti-hero throughout the entire series. In the anime, the only time his attitude changes is when the subject of Azalie is brought up. He will do anything for Azalie, as they have quite a history together, but Orphen keeps his feelings and the story about Azalie to himself at first, only opening up later in the series. However, in the novels, he opens up about Azalie fairly quickly. He and Azalie were brought to the school together because it was believed that they possessed a strong amount of magical power within them. This proved correct; Orphen was a magic prodigy. Orphen eventually becomes the greatest sorcerer in the world. His true name is Krylancelo Finrandi, and the sorcerers from the Tower of Fang (Hartia, Azalie, Leticia, Childman, and Flameheart) still refer to him like that. In the novels, Orphen is characterized slightly differently, being more rough, profane and seemingly unstable than his anime portrayal. He suffers from increasing megalomania and what seems to be a type of dissociative identity disorder in which he sometimes thinks of Krylancelo and Orphen as different people. However, through the company of his apprentice, Majic and the heiress Cleao Everlasting, he steadily becomes more at peace with himself and learns to accept who he is. In the novels, he gains the dark magic of a Deep Dragon and the power of Swedenborg(a Demon God), though this can tax on his sanity when he utilizes it for too long. By the end of the original novella series, Orphen is living in relative obscurity on the outskirts of the continent with his wife, Cleao Everlasting and their daughters, Ratsbane, Edge and Ratchet. By the age of 40, he becomes the head founder of his own magic academy known the Swedenborg School of Sorcery.\n\nCleao Everlasting\n\nis the main female protagonist that joins Orphen on his journey. In the first anime, she carries the Sword of Baltanders, which was entrusted to her by her father on her fifteenth birthday, and lets Orphen hold onto it as long as he does not object to her tagging along. Cleao also carries in her backpack a Deep Dragon wolf-cub named Leki. She and Orphen constantly quarrel, but she does so to hide her growing affection for him and secretly longs for him from afar. She and Orphen eventually marry at the end of the original novels and have three daughters. She trains with a long sword and quickly becomes proficient with it as she journeys with Orphen and Majic, even able to duel on even grounds with other highly skilled swordsmen. It is later discovered that Cleao has magical potential, which is unlocked due to Leki merging his mind with hers and she eventually seeks training from Leticia to develop her latent abilities, which she completed in a year’s time. She also learns how to handle a gun.\n\nMajic Lin\n\nis Orphen’s apprentice, and the second male lead. He is a childhood friend of Cleao’s, but in the manga they are not close friends since she’s three years older than he is, and she also spent a long time at boarding school. In the anime, they were in the same grade in school, but she has since moved on to boarding school. Majic deals with the torment from both Cleao and Orphen on their journey together to save Azalie. His father is paying Orphen to teach him, which at first seems a waste of money to his father. When Orphen repairs a glass that fell with his magic before the father’s eyes, the father’s opinion about his money being “thrown out the window” disappears. Majic appears to be a good student, learning as much as he can, and retaining all of what he learns, although his anxiety tends to get the better of him when it comes time to prove himself. Orphen, however, sees significant potential in Majic and encourages him in his training. This gives him courage, which makes his power stronger. Majic looks up to Orphen, and refers to him as “master” upon Orphen’s request. All sorcerers call their “teachers”, who teach them sorcery, “master.” By the end of the novels, Majic has become a famous, world-renowned sorcerer and even takes on Ratsbane, Orphen and Cleao’s firstborn child, as his apprentice.\n\nManga Monday- Sorcerous Stabber Orphen\n\nSorcerous Stabber Orphen is a series of Japanese fantasy adventure novel and manga, two anime television series (Sorcerous Stabber Orphen and Sorcerous Stabber Orphen 2: Revenge), and a video game.\n\nManga\n\nThe manga adaptation was created by writer Yoshinobu Akita and artist Hajime Sawada. The first volume was released stateside by ADV Manga in March, 2005. It tells us about Azalie, Orphen’s foster sister and best friend from six years ago, much sooner than the anime does. In the first manga, we are told almost exactly what the eighth episode (titled “Azalie”) of Sorcerous Stabber Orphen tells us about her. The story in the manga follows the anime but more the Novels almost exactly, except for information coming up earlier, or later.\n\nThe Sorcerous Stabber Orphen manga was created by Yoshinobu Akita and Yuuya Kusaka. The manga is split into two separate series: Majutsushi Orphen Haguretabi, which is six volumes long so far, and the two volume side story known as Majutsushi Orphen MAX. The first volume of the manga series was released in 2005 by ADV Manga.\n\nThere is also a special manga that was released called “Sorcerous Stabber Orphen Special Parody,” or “Majutsushi O-fuen Haguretabi Spesharu Paarodi.” It is a collection of doujinshi of Orphen put into one volume of Orphen.\n\nA new ongoing manga adaptation based on the main novels (or “Stray” arc) was created and released by Yoshinobu Akita and illustrator Muraji in March 2017. In July 2018, Seven Seas Entertainment announced their acquisition of the manga’s license for English distribution.\n\nIn August 2018, a manga adaptation based on the light novel spin-off series, “Sorcerous Stabber Orphen: Reckless Arc” or “Majutsushi Orphen: Mubouhen”, was released. It will be written and illustrated by Yu Yagami (The author of Those Who Hunt Elves).\n\nSynopsis\n\nKrylancelo Finrandi once attended the most prestigious school of sorcery on Kiesalhima continent, the Tower of Fang. He was sent there as a young child from an orphanage, along with another orphan girl called Azalie. Throughout the years, the two were very close, with Azalie becoming more and more powerful and Krylancelo looking up to her as a sister/mother figure and a best friend. It isn’t until one day, Azalie’s thirst for knowledge and extracurricular experimentation backfire, and she is horribly transfigured into a hideous creature, a dragon-like beast that departs the Tower in an animal fury, leaving Krylancelo behind. The Fang Tower, however, is unsympathetic. They promote the belief that Azalie is dead in order to cover the grievous error that resulted in her unimaginable transformation, a terrible scandal that would surely destroy the school’s reputation and authority. People whom Krylancelo thought were his friends suddenly seem as though they are strangers, even enemies, going along with the Tower’s pretense rather than challenge their authority. Furious that they will do nothing to help her and are instead determined to track down the Bloody August and destroy it before the truth can come to light, Krylancelo renounces his former self, declaring Krylancelo to be dead and that he is, instead, Orphen.\n\nAfter five years, he finds himself living in the quiet town of Totokanta and taking on a student – Majic Lin, his landlord’s son. Life is quiet and fairly lazy until the day Cleao Everlasting comes home from boarding school, and stumbles into Orphen’s quietly laid plans for the sword that sits on her family’s mantle: the Sword Of Baltanders. It turns out that the sword is actually one of three magical artifacts that Orphen will need if he is to save Azalie, and, in fact, was the very sword Azalie used in her experiment that ended with her unfortunate transformation. Before he can obtain it, however, the Bloody August assaults the town looking for the sword, and soon after, Tower’s forces show up as well.\n\nTo find the other Baltander’s relics, Orphen sets off with his apprentice, little miss Everlasting and two short-statured misfits, but at all times they need to stay ahead of the Tower of Fang and its sorcerers, who all believe that bringing Azalie back to her former state would reveal their oversight in containing her increasingly dangerous magic, a mistake so great it could bring the Tower down – and, of course, ahead of Azalie herself who, as the dragon is more powerful than both Orphen and the Tower. Orphen is driven solely by the need to transform Azalie back into her human self at even the cost of his life. But restoring Azalie ends up being only the beginning…"
