        "text": "Goku, The Monkey King!\n\nGoku is a rude and often selfish monkey who tries to take over heaven with Gyumaou but was caught and exiled away. A little girl named Chao, finds him and takes care of him for a while and from her, Goku learns the importance of kindness and diligence. However, Goku is found by Oshakasama and is imprisoned. Chao goes on an adventure to find the Gavel of Light to save Goku. Several years later, the world is put under peril by Goku's old ally, Gyumaou and Goku is tasked to defeat Gyumaou and save the world.\n\nWhat game Goku is from?\n\nGoku is from...\n\nGoku is from a game released on the Famicom called Yūyūki. The game was a part of a series called Famicom Fairytales that also included Shin Onigashima. The game is loosely based of the Chinese story, Journey to the West. The English translation for the game is Brave Brave Spirit.\n\nPlaystyle and Moveset:\n\nGround Speed 6/10: Goku is above average speed on the ground.\n\nAir Speed 7/10: Goku is quite fast in the air.\n\nSize 4/10: Goku is slightly smaller than Mario.\n\nWeight 3/10: Goku is a lighter character that can be launched fairly decently.\n\nFall Speed 6/10: Goku falls at an above average rate.\n\nJump Height 6/10: Goku jump height is above average\n\nTraction 3/10: Goku has poor traction and doesn't stop immediately when turning.\n\nGoku's playstyle and moveset is inspired from Shaolin and bo staff techniques as well as using some moves from Sun Wukong in Smite (Goku is based off Sun Wukong in Yuyuki). Goku also uses a kung fu fighting style. I wanted to make Goku fast, agile, and deadly like the techniques I've based him on.\n\nNormal Attacks:\n\nJab Combo: Goku strikes downward from over his shoulder with the staff. He follows up with a strike from the other end of the staff going diagonally upward. He ends the combo with a horizontal strike from the staff.\n\nForward Tilt: Goku plants his staff in the ground and swings on it like a monkey, using his legs to attack.\n\nUp Tilt: Goku climbs up his staff and does a spinning kick while spinning around the staff.\n\nDown Tilt: Goku pokes his staff near the opponents feet.\n\nDash Attack: Goku jumps in the air and performs a butterfly kick.\n\nSmash Attacks:\n\nForward: Goku swings his staff from overhead, downward while leaping forward a small bit.\n\nUp: Goku swings his staff over his head, head tilted sideways. He swings while gripping the bottom of the staff so the entire length of the staff swings overhead.\n\nDown: Goku spins in a circle while swinging his staff outward.\n\nGrabs:\n\nGoku grabs with one hand and puts his opponents in a side headlock.\n\nPummel: Goku noogies them.\n\nForward: Goku shoves his staff into the opponent and it extends, then he lifts them over his head and throws them forward.\n\nBackward: Goku turns them around, slaps the opponent's neck and then slams his staff into their back.\n\nUp: Goku throws them up, and does a handstand kick so the opponent's back lands on his feet and are sent flying.\n\nDown: Goku places them on the ground and performs an axe kick, where he kicks vertically upwards near his head then slams his heel into the opponent on the ground.\n\nAerials:\n\nNAir: Goku does a split kick in midair.\n\nFAir: Goku does a kick in vertically in front of him.\n\nBAir: Goku swings his staff behind him while the staff is extending.\n\nUAir: Goku turns upside down and sticks his legs out like helicopter blades and spins.\n\nDAir: Goku uses his staff as a pogo stick and he shoots downward (not as fast as Link's down air). If it sweetspots right at the beginning of the move, it will spike the opponent downward.\n\nSpecials:\n\nNeutral: Decoy: Goku creates a decoy of himself that can be physically hit and even does Goku's idle animations. The real Goku is invisible and can move around but not attack. The decoy lasts about 5 seconds and there is a 10 second charge up time for Goku to use the ability again. If the decoy has taken 25% damage, it will explode and inflict a small amount of damage on players around it. Goku can be hit while invisible.\n\nSide: Bo Twirl: Goku twirls his staff in front of him really fast, fast enough to deflect projectiles. If the opponent gets close to him while doing this move, the attack hits the opponent multiple times. (This move is like 's Side B in Brawl but it doesn't propel you forward as far).\n\nUp: Flying Nimbus Strike: Goku summons his magical cloud and swings his staff from side to side wildly. If you hold the button when using the move, Goku will ascend higher, if you let go, Goku will free fall. (Kind of like 's up B just that it actually damages opponents).\n\nDown: Transformation: Goku transforms into one of his three friends. Goku will transform into his friends for 8 seconds. He can cancel out of the transformation by pressing another attack other than the down B.\n\nSanzo (the monk): If he turns into Sanzo, Goku rides on Sanzo's scooter in a straight line forward. If down B is held Goku goes farther on the scooter.\n\nHakkai (the pig): If Goku turns into Hakkai, he will be invincible for the time being. Since Hakkai can see the future with his clairvoyance, Goku will dodge all attacks by opponents.\n\nGojo (the kappa): If Goku turns into Gojo, Goku can stun opponents with his down B attack. The stun lasts 3 seconds.\n\nFinal Smash:\n\nGavel of Light: Goku summons the Gavel of Light and holds it up to the heavens. Three beams of light rain down onto the stage and opponents are launched if they touch the beams.\n\nTaunts:\n\nSide: Goku turns around and waves his butt toward the direction you inputted.\n\nUp: Goku crawls to the top of his staff and does a one handed handstand on the top of it.\n\nDown: Goku twirls his staff around and throws it in the air before catching it.\n\nEntrance:\n\nGoku enters the stage riding on his cloud. He gets off and the cloud flies away.\n\nVictory Poses:\n\nGoku twirls his staff around his body and ends it this pose.\n\nGoku climbs on the side of his staff and looks around.\n\nGoku does some kung fu moves while Chao is watching and hurts himself. Chao then runs up to help him.\n\nMusic\n\nGoku from Yuyuki stays pretty true to Sun Wukong. Goku would be a vastly unique addition to the Smash roster, using a mixture of his staff and kung fu.\n\nHe would also be a new \"Retro Character\" for the roster. People like retro. Goku met Kirby in Kirby's Dream Land 3 so Goku's potential inclusion would be a reunion.\n\nAmazing artwork by @ZestyÑ and someone else for the first artwork.\n\nShameless copy and paste of @POKEMANSPIKA thread.\n\nhttps://smashboards.com/threads/goku-the-monkey-martial-arts-master-for-smash-dlc.408424/\n\nThe Warriors of the West:\n\nWhen you search \"Goku\" on the TESS, the file with the registration number 2114595 that Toei owns has the description of \"the Japanese pronunciation of the name of a hero of ancient Chinese legend\" which could say the same for Yuyuki's Goku. All kinds of toys are included in the services, which means they can't get an amiibo called Goku without going through Toei. And I highly doubt Toei would let them use the name for something that just looks like a ripoff within a popular All-Star crossover game. Toei would want more money from Smash and have them promote Dragon Ball by putting their famous Super Saiyan in Smash as a playable fighter and having other characters like Vegeta, Piccolo, Majin Buu, Gohan, Bulma, Chi-Chi, Frieza and Videl as trophies. Vegeta could be a great Assist Trophy. Sorry, but Dragon Ball Goku has a much bigger chance of making it than Yuyuki Goku. And besides, being an anime character shouldn't hinder his chances of being in Smash when you look at how overrepresented the Pokémon series is. Yes, I know the games Pokémon Red and Green came first, but there are some Pokémon content in Smash that came from the anime. Pokémon are saying their names. Oh and look at Lucario, who's actually based on the one from the eighth movie instead of a generic Lucario you catch in the games. And since Lucario is one of those Pokémon who debuted in the anime earlier than the games, the \"must start in video games\" rule is completely broken. Also, Sakurai wanted to put James Bond in Melee. The only reason he was cut was because the producers of the James Bond movies at MGM and the actor Pierce Brosnan couldn't agree to the deal. But the idea of Sakurai ever wanting James Bond in Melee just raises the probability of 4th-party characters even more. And with all of these Indie developers begging Nintendo to put their characters in Smash, Bandai Namco who holds the Dragon Ball license worked on Smash 4, Sakurai and Toriyama both living in Japan, Dragon Ball's Goku doesn't seem that dumb of an idea."
