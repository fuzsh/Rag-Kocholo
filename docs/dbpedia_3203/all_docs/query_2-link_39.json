        "text": "Source: tribalblind(Photographer). (2005). Mabini Philippine Flag [Photography]. Philippines.\n\nImagine yourself walking in your home from a long day’s work as you inhale that sweet-saltiness of soy sauce, a dash of sugar, ungrounded pepper and laurel leaves, fairly distributing themselves in cuts of chicken, pork and hardboiled eggs. Yes, it is one of the many famed local cuisines, engraving itself on every Filipino heart, so distinct, that the dish made it among one of the dishes in the very acclaimed Facebook application, Zynga’s Café World.\n\nCertainly, the Adobo is just one of the many distinctive Filipino cuisines. Although of Spanish influence, it still denotes that warm, heartfelt old-cooking of a home. Among which are the afternoon side-street fishball stands, balut corners, goto karinderias; and, of course, who would ever forget the bibingka and putobumbongs being sold around September onwards in all corners to welcome the Yuletide Season? It is another thing which makes us Filipinos quite unique from others; celebrating Christmas with whole hearts, being together with our own families during that season, enjoying the festivities amidst unfortunate events and other problems, most of all, not forgetting to pray to God for the birth of Jesus Christ as we attend the nine nights of Simbang Gabi. We all make the most for ourselves because, if we look at it this way, it is the one thing that most of us look forward to the whole year round.\n\nOther people say that we Filipinos lack originality, mimicking the races which once beheld our freedom. Spain conquering us for over three hundred years resulted to the development of our culture and traditions, although some critics have questioned why we could not make our own. It deems true, but I say that it is part of the shaping of our culture – to be influenced. A lot of countries have had that change. Take Japan and Korea for example, two of the most powerful and influential countries of the modern age yet their cultural values were based on the ones practiced by Chinese. Therefore, even if our own traditions were greatly influenced by foreigners, we should always be proud.\n\nSpeaking of Filipino pride, our country’s fame has risen along the fame of quite a few talented Filipinos. Does Manny Pacquiao, Charice Pempengco and Jabbawockeez ring bells? Of course! Although they are just a few of the whole lot who definitely gave our country a sort of, pride, to grasp on. As far as I remember, Filipinos used to discriminate their own races, complaining about the corrupted government systems, halted processes of progress, widespread poverty and such; and as far as I am concerned, these people are nothing but hypocrites who would not have done better than to critic themselves. At least some people have done their parts to rise our country’s stature.\n\nYes, we are one among other third-world countries. Yes, we sometimes lack unity. Yes, most tend to leave the country for greener pastures. Yes, we cannot blame them for this mindset, but we can always make them realize that it is still better to help our countrymen, as we stand hand in hand, to lift our drowning country. May it be by engaging in outreach programs, advocating for the betterment, different sorts, different actions. Most of all, yes, I do believe that our beloved Philippines can still rise from its current state amidst all of the foreboding sense of lacking a future.\n\nI believe that each of us can really do our own parts to achieve our aims, whatever our state may be, wherever we are. As for me, I just got started by letting my voice be heard. I am advocating nationalism, because from this rises up all possibilities of being able to do our parts. I am, foremost, still a student, a freshman of De La Salle University, achiever for God and country. Although it may be too early to live up to my alma matter’s standards, I may as well begin it early as to not be left by time eventually regretting I have not done anything. Currently, our university holds quite a lot of advocacies and programs for our country’s betterment and I try, in all of my power, to help them and do my part.\n\nHopefully, and I mean very, very much hopefully, in the future, we may be able to witness the progress we so sought for; feel the widespread sense of nationalism and unity; and most of all, hear the wholeheartedly sang national anthem, Lupang Hinirang. Someday, we are going to be known as something “Legendary.” I am not losing hope; and neither should you.\n\n“You know…” are the very lines which has been imprinted on the name of our “Pambansang Kamao,” Manny Pacquiao as he had always stated these like a period in his sentences with that tinge of Visayan accent . Although the “you know” fame has greatly diminished, Pacquiao’s fame has not. His rise in the boxing industry was also an open window for the Filipino pride, to be proud of his accomplishments, to be proud of his global fame, to be proud of the Filipino tag he has always carried. On the other hand, Pacquiao’s fame was also an open door for him to enter politics and show business. Aside from having his network projects for GMA 7, he has also endorsed quite a lot of products foreign and, most especially, local ones. One of which is the local NutriAsia’s Datu Puti as seen in the linked video.\n\nI find this advertisement very, very disturbing, frankly saying, and one of the most irritating. By the time Manny Pacquiao rose into fame, his mother also took the spotlights. They shot the commercial together with the Jinky and Freddie Roach look-alikes. The advertisement started off with the narration of the Roach look-alike, slowly blending to the scene when Manny was asked to run an errand. When Manny was at the sari-sari store to buy the vinegar, an African-American man in red who embodied Mayweather Jr. came forth and quickly snatched the vinegar away. Then after, his companion in blue shirt attempted to punch Pacquiao’s face squarely but, luckily, the latter was able to evade. This then triggered an over-acting violent scene just to, what, show the prowess and trademark of the world-famed ten-title champion of eight different weight divisions? Also, the producers had to make him look good by showing viewers that he was not the one who started the fight as he boldly told the Roach look-alike that “Boxing is not for killing.” Although, this does not bother me much more than the next few scenes.\n\nBy the time Pacquiao arrived home to deliver the bottle of vinegar, the Roach look-alike just needed to slyly and seductively say the line “May asim pa si Mommy” By Jove, as the British would say, this seems more of, how can I describe it, unprofessionally, “ewww.” The lines had no definite meaning, only a playful mind would react to those lines either jokingly or irritated. Its ambiguity is very disturbing considering it is something said by a young white foreigner to a woman of 62. Then the mother would jokingly ride with the joke punning the words “May toyo ka yata eh.” The lines truly depict its product; it is as sour as it sounds. It may not affect some people, but others surely react the same way I do.\n\nI have got nothing against NutriAsia, Datu Puti, or even the Pacquiaos but it was the blending of the script, the tone of the voice, and the acting which bothered me the most. I do think that a lot of companies make some sort of “jingle” or catchy taglines to mark their products in the mind of viewers and future consumers; everyone has their own strategies, may the results be pleasing to others or not. The final judgement of the advertised products or services will just have to be evaluated by the consumers themselves. Sanely, for now, we just have to go with the flow, you know.\n\nSource: PINASISM6. (2011, February 19).

Although a lot of people support President Noynoy Aquino’s abilities, some still hold displeasure against him, criticizing his every move, claiming that he has not done anything to yield change, even though he has only grasped his position for merely thirteen months.\n\nOne of the things which he immediately stressed on upon his settlement was the banning of the wang-wang – steaming hot sirens spreading kingship and authority over the road. This wang-wang which, according to President Noynoy (P-Noy) is a symbol of privilege abuse, was also the main framework of his State-of-the-Nation Address (SONA) for the year 2011.\n\nThe “anti-wang wang” law, in other words, Presidential Decree No. 96 “The unlawful use of sirens” was implemented by former President Ferdinand Marcos on the 13th of January of the year 1973. Although not the one who created the law, P-Noy has highly stressed this matter because it was said to have brought the unruly VIP mindset of not only enforcement authorities, but also other aristocratic-feeling motorists, disrupting the peace and patience of other civilians on roads. Personally, the illegal use of sirens was irritating on my part as a civilian. Why do I have to adjust to other people with the same right and rank as I, though we are all giving importance to our time? Fortunately, ever since this law was stressed on by P-Noy, less wang-wang were heard on the streets. By less, I mean, not completely removed. I recall a certain recent incident when I was in our car, stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic. A gray-colored police car was alternately turning on and off its sirens. If it was a real emergency, the siren would have been left on screaming but it was like the policemen inside the car were a bit wary or ashamed to keep it on just to eventually escape traffic. My mother then murmured “Sinabi na ngang bawal…” This, of course, is only the concrete aspect.\n\nMoving on to a more abstract concept, this wang-wang mindset has been synonymous to authority, but it was described by P-Noy as the “crooked path,” the crooked path leading authorities to corruption. Corruption is not a new concept to the Philippines for it has plagued the local society for so long. It is no longer surprising that our country would be ranked as the fourth most corrupt country in Asia by the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) last 2010. A lot of local industries, some of which are government offices, have been reported for corruption; officials initializing fraud projects just so the people responsible will abandon it in the future once they get hold of the project’s budget. On the other hand, governmental or not, corruption still exists in different non-government industries, though not blatantly nor monetary. For instance, I have a friend who worked as an assistant supervisor in an office-supply distributor company and every week he would bring home rims of bond papers and boxes of pens and correction fluids. Although he states that these products were marked defect, I would always doubt his statements. This aside, I commend P-Noy for his advocacy against corruption and although it would always seem unlikely to believe that corruption has been completely ridden of, at least it was lessened.\n\nFinally, the point of “employment” was raised in the recent presidential SONA. P-Noy has stated and compared the unemployment rates in the month of April in both 2010 and 2011. Although his statement declared that the unemployment rate has decreased, other sources like the Independent Research and Advocacy Organization (IBON) Foundation stated that the 1.4 million job creations was merely counterbalanced by the 1.2 million labor force growth and a mere 829,000 underemployed workers. This means that although more job opportunities were laid for the laymen, employed parties who do not earn sufficient amounts still seek for more jobs, over-lapping the employment rate mentioned in the 2011 SONA. Some people are still having a hard time looking for jobs; others are merely engaging in careers which are not their fields of specialty because of lack of job opportunities or insufficient earnings.\n\nPresident Noynoy’s inauguration was held merely a year ago, yet the people of the nation has been expecting too much from him. Whether what he says is true or just flowery words of comfort, this individual who holds the name of two of the most iconic politicians in the Philippines would most unlikely commit acts that will taint the names of his parents. For him, who was pressured by massive popular demands to run in the 2010 elections, he surely has been doing his best, although by planning or promising acts of change. Whether or not a lot of people will believe in his reign, there will always be others who will repel his claims, criticizing his every word, his every move. As the law of Physics states, “100 percent release of energy is an ideal situation,” most of the time non-existent. Are we just going to wait for the future to unfold, or start contributing to the change we seek after?\n\nSource:\n\nPNoy’s SONA 2011 in English. (25 July 2011).

It is the Korean translation of “Hello” and is primarily used by Tricia to express her love for the Korean culture. This cheerful, energetic young lady who hails from Marilao, Bulacan, was born in Anini-y, Antique on the 29th of December, 1994 from parents Wenniefred and Annabell Saim. As a teenager, she would eventually complain about the noises which her younger brothers make at home, but she seems to have gotten used to it.\n\nAlthough born in Antique, she and her brothers Troy and Tranz were raised in the Metro, particularly around Bulacan City. She graduated high school from St. Mary’s College of Meycauayan, earning quite a lot of fond memories from the said school. According to Tricia, it was where she met her best friend, “soul-sister” as she refers to her, who eventually changed her life for the better. Tricia stated that her best friend was the one who opened her to different points-of-view and helped her clearly express her feelings, “She was the one who told me it’s okay to cry and let my feelings flow freely, and told me it’s okay to rant.” University life on the other hand, is still not sinking inside her head but she claimed that she has gotten used to the daily routines.\n\nFor this young girl who has puppy dog eyes, curved, cheerful eyebrows and brown-dyed hair, over-all looking graceful and angelic, her physical appearance does not seem to match her real personality. Contrary to her Maria Clara-like features, she is loud, boisterous and never seems to run out of punch lines; she squeals when she sees cute things, gets loco when she hears Korean Pop music, and glares when she expresses her sarcasm. Despite all of these, she still has not forgotten her place with regards to her manners and etiquette, occasionally complaining about some people’s ill-attitudes, snotty mean glares and out-of-place side comments.\n\nUnbeknownst to many, yet quite obvious to some, Tricia frequently expresses her self-proclaimed eternal love for the Korean Pop Culture. She had her playlist filled with K-Pop music, had her hard-drive’s memory filled with Koreanovela downloaded videos and maximized her allowance just to buy merchandises and collectibles. It all started when she got addicted to this Taiwanese series “Hana-Kimi” which was an adaptation from a Japanese manga of the same title. While doing some informal research on the said television series, she stumbled upon a group of nine dancing girls. She got curious and interested on the subject and did another research. After a while, she realized that the biggest craze in her life was about to come. Right then and there, she discovered about the charismatic Korean pop culture which cultivated a lot of young girls in the nation; she was twelve years old then. Years passed and her addiction just grew as she nurtured it with more interest and curiosity. But, to top it all, she has done quite a lot of extremities just to get a glimpse of her favourite Korean Pop Superstars. One of which was skipping classes just so she and her friends could pick up the tickets they won for a concert in the Cultural Center of the Philippines entitled “Philippine-Korean Culture Festival”. Korea’s representative then, was the boy band SHINee. Tricia has admitted this foul act but for her, during those times when Korean Pop culture was not yet at its peak, it seemed like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Another instant was when she and her friends watched a concert entitled “Super Show 2” in Araneta Coliseum where the ever famous Super Junior popular boy group hailing from South Korea performed. Tricia had to pull her grades up and save a large amount of money just to be able to watch the said concert. She and her friends waited in line for a total of twelve hours. “It was all worth it.” States Tricia, enthusiastically recalling the memory.\n\nTricia is just one of the thousands and millions of other Korean Pop culture fans in the world but her addiction never ceases to fascinate those who surround her. She said that her best achievement in life so far is being able to express herself better. In accordance to that, I think she has made her claim crystal clear by being able to express her addiction.\n\nSource: Noriega, J. (Photographer). (2011). Homage to Home\n\n[Photography]. Philippines: Joseph Thomas Noriega Photography.\n\n“I’m home!” It is something said when one arrives to his or her house. It can either be a relieving sigh from a whole day’s work or an exciting exclamation cried by someone looking forward to the usual family bonding. Just how can a home deliver a sense of comfort and security, of belongingness, of nostalgic bliss? How can we measure the trueness of a “home”? To what extent is it capable of being different to other places?\n\nThere is something of atmospheric value in a home which makes us secure that we can, at any time, let our guards down, with no sense of paranoia and uneasiness, because we can feel, and we know, that there is something we can lean back on which will protect us for the next few idle hours. It gives us a feeling of security and comfort that we are in our own place, in our own world, where we have the freedom to do anything we please like leaning back on the couch with our two smelly feet on the foot stool, clicking that dark-colored remote control which turns on the television, waiting for the rest of the corns to pop and release that distinct burnt-like smell with blends of buttery aroma. Yes, it gives us that sense of security and comfort because the moment we step inside our homes is also the moment when we unmask ourselves from all those pretentions as and we reveal our true colors.\n\nIn our homes we are accepted, whatever we may be. The people will not mind the things we do whether we jump naked out of the bathroom to yell “There’s a giant spider!” or carry out idiosyncrasies like holding a candelabrum in the left hand while painting using the right; we belong in that sense of warm acceptance, of belongingness.\n\nFinally, a home provides us a sense of nostalgia, especially for those who have been away for quite long. It brings rushing memories of childhood and of youth, of quarrels and misunderstandings, of fights or arguments, of hope, conflicts and trials. We begin to look back where everything began before we ventured on our own paths and journeys. As we return from these journeys, with all those acquired knowledge of priceless value, travelled roads of intensity, experienced events of momentary bliss, it all goes back to that single-path road leading to the place where we began, where everything began, where things started making sense as we wobbled balancing our feet on these stepping stones supported by our homes, where our memoirs will always rush back from the very sight of it. It will always be there to catch us, to give us a place where we can retreat from all the uncertainty, relentlessness and ambiguity of the chaotic outside world.\n\nI remember the times when I was a Senior Girls Scout in high school and we would go to camping trips which lasts for almost a week. The most vivid and exciting yet unnerving camping that I can remember was our trip to Mt. Makiling in Laguna. It was the midst of summer but the rainy season sure came by early. Everything was, by far, going as planned except for the frequent rainfall and slippery muddy grounds. I had been accustomed to these kinds of set-ups since it was not my first camping, although, I still have not gotten used to the frequent stings of ant bites and itchy spots marked by breeding female mosquitoes, the geothermic scent which clogged our noses every time rain poured, and the long uncomfortable hike from place to place. I remember that we were scheduled to hike on an early morning to the peak of the mountain to witness the sunrise. We started hiking by three in the morning and I decided to wear those cheap no-lace sneakers so I can easily throw them away when they have been deeply dipped in mud. It was a big mistake though as the soles slowly lost their sticky grip because of the mud and continuous rain fall. I had to uncomfortably walk with my group the whole morning wearing broken slippery sneakers, and amidst my carefulness not to slip which I kept thinking about, to my torment, the law of attraction prevailed and I actually slipped just a few steps away from our tent! The muddy waters soaked through my jeans and underwear as it took me quite a few seconds to regain myself before standing up. Right then and there, I missed my home. The experience was unique, aside from my humiliating slip; but the very sight of home topped everything, that I was able to finally feel that I’m once again safe; I smirked to myself and whispered “I’m home.”\n\nI think that’s what Joseph Thomas Noriega wanted us to see as he paid his homage to his home; that despite all the hardships, challenges and suffering, “The sweet smell of home mends the broken soul.” [Noriega, J., 2010]; that despite all those conflicts or arguments we experienced even inside our houses, there is only one way to treat our bleeding souls, and it is to go home.\n\nAs quoted from Minekura Kazuya’s famous manga adaptation of the epic Chinese novel Journey to the West entitled “Saiyuki”, a character named Komyou Sanzo noted that “True freedom is having somewhere to return to.” Sometimes we may feel angry to our siblings, or parents, and we simply wish to be free, free from all those implemented rules which engulf the members or our own homes, but, paradoxically, our home is the one thing that distinguishes our freedom, that we have somewhere to return to.\n\nThe word “environment” can become quite ambiguous. It refers to the surroundings, may those be things or people, around an individual; described by the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary as ”the circumstances, objects, or conditions by which one is surrounded”. When spoken of, what actually comes to your mind? I admit that the very first thing which I can think of are the ever cliché topics of “clean and green,” save-the-earth thing, global warming, etc. Yes, surely almost everyone is well aware of the fact that the earth is currently on a desperate state of rescuing. But this time, let us focus on another point of view. Generally, “environment” denotes two aspects – the built environment and the natural environment. The built refers to the man-made environment of the skyscrapers, highway roads and factories while the natural one refers to nature, that of the trees, plants and ecosystems to name a few.\n\nThe built environment has begun ever since humans learned how to create shelters to protect themselves. These shelters, may they be wooden or concrete, are definitely the evidences of the improving technological advancements, skyscrapers, roads and the means of transportation in growing metropolises are the by-products. In the modern day, it is very evident that man highly appreciates these technological by-products because it makes their livings more convenient. Not only that, people, especially capitalists, have noticed the opportunity to gain more money by sufficing the laymen of what they need. Thus, factories are made to create a variety of things, roads are improved to make transportation easier, and commercial or residential buildings occupy the skies to accommodate tenants.\n\nOn the other hand, the natural environment, ever since the scientific and industrial revolutions of the 18th century, has been overly abused by mankind to create fuel-needing engines that would suffice the demands of technology. Up until now, it is very evident that mankind continues to pollute these natural resources to supply their daily needs. Yes, nature provides us all the resources we seek, giving us the basic materials like food, shelter and clothing for our survival. To be able to sustain this “built environment,” humans need to depend on the “natural environment”. But the grim truth behind this is that the relationship of the two environments denotes parasitism. Because the built one highly depends on the natural, the former abuses the latter, takes it for granted and destroys it piece by piece. For instance, to be able to gain lumber, people destroy forests just so they can create pencils, papers, furniture and the sorts. To be able to keep their “built” houses clean, people throw waste outside these shelters only for these wastes to end up in dumpsites which were originally a type of a natural environment. To be able to experience better means of transportation, people use crude oil for cars which, by then, emit carbon monoxide harming the ozone layer. To be able to maintain the sanitation of the metropolis, people invented a drainage system bringing waste water out of their homes, only to end up polluting rivers and oceans.\n\nHumans continue to be dazzled by these marvellous man-made structures yet they are unaware of the grim truth that these structures continue to harm nature, too. So despite all those organizational attempts to promote “clean and green” projects, why do most of these receive slow progress or worse, fail? It is not mainly because people tend to be hard-headed when it comes to responsible waste disposal methods, but it is also because man is afraid of an instant great change. They become insecure when taken away from their own comfort zones. Wipe out all the technological advancements and it will greatly contribute to the saving of the earth but do you think that man will allow such a great change? Would they let themselves go back to the basics of wooden tires and horse-back carriages? What do you think?\n\nI’m not saying that we are helpless when it comes to environmental awareness. Yes, we can still contribute to help save our mother earth, but we cannot expect to see the results immediately. It will take time for people to be able to adjust their habits, but it doesn’t mean that we should also stop trying."
