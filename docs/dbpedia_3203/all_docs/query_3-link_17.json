        "text": "According to the Anime News Network, Carl Horn of Dark Horse Comics announced a raft of new adult-oriented manga titles at Anime Central including Lady Snowblood, Eden, Space Pinchy and Saiyuki Dendaio. Horn also confirmed that Dark Horse has acquired the rights to Crying Freeman, the six-volume yakuza epic written by Kazuo Koike and superbly illustrated by Ryoichi Ikegami. Viz previously published Crying Freeman in the U.S., but now Dark Horse will release the Koike editions of the manga.\n\nKoike is also the creative force behind another mature readers title, Lady Snowblood, the story of a girl raised to avenge the brutal murder of her family.Lady Snowblood has spawned several live action films and reportedly also provided the inspiration for the O-Ren Ishii character from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill.\n\nHiroki Endo's Eden is another title that will appeal to mature readers--a science fiction saga set in a disease-ravaged future where a secret organization has taken over the world. All the major characters have the names of Gnostic deities and a little knowledge of Gnostic mythology will go a long way towards explaining the convoluted plot and the characters' relationships.\n\nSpace Pinchy is a rare full color manga -- a pulpy science fiction parody with loads of fan service that received a nomination for the best Japanese science fiction manga award in 2002."
