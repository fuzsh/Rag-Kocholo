As our 20th anniver- sary annual summed up our amazing experience of being part of JI-ENT. But I recently found the very first issue of JI-ENT from 1994. Suffice to say, it was a bit embarrassing as it was written years before I learned AP Press Style but at the same time, it was fascinating because it captured a moment of time of what we were enjoying at the time at JI-ENT. In 2014 we saw the release of \"Ranma 1/2\", featuring episodes remastered on Blu- ray! How awesome is that? Well, upon discovering this issue of our first JI-ENT zine, surprisingly enough, the discussion was about \"Ranma 1/2\". Here is an excerpt of what I wrote back in 1994: A lot of you have probably heard of Ranma 1/2. In fact, a lot of you are probably sick of hearing the title of the series because no matter how old it is... You still love it! Many of us have stuck around, enjoying this series because we enjoy Rumiko Takahashi's work. A lot of us stick around because we love the anime and are true \"Otaku no Ranma Whatever reason you have, for sticking around for 'Ranma 1/2\", for now, 'Ranma 1/2\" is still going strong! DENNIS A. AMITH, EDITIOR-l 1/2\". Of course, the series is a Rumiko Takahashi classic, as with \"Urusei Yatsura\" and \"Maison Ikkoku\", a lot of these titles were close to the hearts of fans who loved the '80s series well into the '90s. While the 2000's would usher in a new group of Rumiko Taka- hashi fan with the series \"Inuyasha\". And of course, our JI-ENT coverage at a convention: / made it to theAkemi Takada panel! One thing I was dissapointed was that there were a lot of people there but it was shameful that not too many people wanted to ask her any questions. So, I started asking questions like crazy.. I personally had to laugh at what I wrote back in 1994, because its the same complaint that myself and other press have at many of these press panels at many events. These conventions have so many press attending, but rarely do you see any of them at a press panel anymore and when you do, they don't bother asking any questions, leaving one or two other press groups including us, to ask the majority of the questions for the guests. I noticed this year, covering events, meeting a lot of the bloggers for other Asian entertainment sites/blogs, asking us a question of how were we able to do this for so long? My feeling is the same I had back then and that is the fact that if you are passionate about what you do, you'll continue to do it. While JI-ENT has changed significantly since 1993, you have to enjoy what you are covering and you have to be dedicated to stay with it for the long haul. Covering Asian pop culture has its positives, but it also has its negatives. The fact is not many sites are making great money doing this, so people should not think covering Asian entertainment will lead to great money. What it will lead to is great friendships worldwide, a feeling of accomplishment for promoting an artist, group or band that many people will want to listen to or reviewing a film or drama that others may want to watch. But also valuing the people you work with at the companies you deal with. Working with Japanese entertainers go beyond the entertainers themselves, it's about working with those at the entertainment company or label and being on the same page. And with each year of getting older, a realization that your taste in pop culture will eventually change. And the people who were with you when you were younger, will not be there years later because of personal change or unfortunately, due to some sort of tragedy, which we at JI-ENT had to learn in 2014. Sure, we cover a lot of entertainment from the U.S. and Europe these days, but as I always tell people, we never forget about our roots of JI-ENT. From the beginning, it was covering a lot of the geek culture, anime, manga, video games, cinema, music and it hasn't changed all that much many years later. We work with fantastic people in the industry, wonderful entertainers who gave us the oppor- tunity to feature them and of course, we meet fantastic people who are familiar with our work at many events and it's a relationship that we at JI-ENT will always value. Thank you for 21 years of support for JI-ENT... let's get ready for Year 22! — DENNIS A. AMITH Our cover was shot by JI-ENT photographer Angelo Delos Reyes, who passed away in July.

NOVEMBER 2014 j-entonline.com I JI-ENT 13 ji-but nm& updms THE FULL SEASON ORDER. FOX PICKS UP SIX MORE EPISODES OF SMASH HIT FOX has ordered six more episodes of this fall's breakout new drama series, GOTHAM, it was announced today by Dana Walden and Gary Newman, Chairmen and CEOs of Fox Television Group. The announcement raises the series order to 22 episodes. \"GOTHAM debuted as one of the most buzzed-about shows of the fall, and with good reason. Bruno Heller and Danny Cannon have created an incredibly rich world, with characters that draw you in and a cast that brings to life these heroes and villains in a way we've never seen before,\" said Walden and Newman. \"We are so excited to see where Bruno, Danny and the entire GOTHAM team take this story over the course of this season, and so thankful to all the fans who have embraced it this fall.\" GOTHAM is tied as Monday night's No. 1 drama among Adults 18-49 and is this season's No. 1 broadcast drama overall among Men 18-49 — a full rating point ahead of the No. 2 drama in that demographic. The debut episode, which exploded into Premiere Week with a 6.0/18 rating among Adults 18-49, outperformed \"Blacklist\" and \"Scorpion\" and delivered FOX's highest-rated fall drama debut in 14 years. This Live +7 rating reflects the largest post- three day ratings gain (+0.9) of any broadcast drama, ever. In addition, GOTHAM's premiere drew 14.1 million viewers in the first seven days and has been streamed more than two million times to date on FOX NOW and Hulu. The show's second and third episodes continued this positive trend, each delivering a 4.0 rating or higher in just the first three days, making it one of the Top Three dramas overall on broadcast television this season. In the next all-new episode of GOTHAM, \"Arkham,\" airing tonight (8:00-9:00 PM ET/PT) on FOX, a contentious city council vote on the future of the Arkham district approaches, and politicians on both sides are in danger. Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) must race to protect the council. Meanwhile, Oswald Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor), who has already been christened \"The Penguin,\" takes violent measures to further ingratiate himself with Maroni (guest star David Zayas), and an old friend pays Gordon a visit. GOTHAM is an origin story of the great DC Comics Super-Villains and vigilantes, revealing an entirely new chapter that has never been told. From executive producer/writer Bruno Heller (\"The Mentalist,\"\"Rome\"), GOTHAM follows one cop's rise through a dangerously corrupt city teetering be- tween good and evil, and chronicles the birth of one of the most popular super heroes of our time. The entirely new, untold chapter stars Ben McKenzie (\"Southland,\" \"The O.C.\"), Donal Logue (\"Vikings,\" \"Sons of Anarchy\") and Jada Pinkett Smith (\"Hawthorne,\" \"Collateral\"). GOTHAM is based upon the characters from DC Comics and is produced by Warner Bros. Television. Executive producer Bruno Heller (\"The Men- talist\") wrote the pilot, which was directed and executive-produced by Emmy Award nominee Danny Cannon (the \"CSI\" franchise, \"Nikita\"). John Stephens serves as an executive producer on the series. \"Like\" GOTHAM on Facebook at facebook.com/GOTHAMonFOX. Follow the series on Twitter @Gotham and join the discussion using #gotham.

Video Games Live Creator/Executive Producer and 25 year game industry veteran Tommy Tallarico said, \"The music industry has changed a lot over the past 13 years since we started Video Games Live, and no record company was will- ing to take a chance on risking the money needed to create the project to the high quality and standards that it needed to be. The traditional record companies didn't believe in the concept and they thought we were crazy. . . but the outpour- ing of fan support from around the world was incredible and inspirational. We proved to the world that people DO care about video game music and we believe that lightning can strike twice.\" The project can be found at the following link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1916334303/video- games-live-level-4-lets-do-it-again Hoping to continue its success, Video Games Live is once again quadrupling the reward value for every pledge to give back to the supporters as much as possible. \"This isn't about making a profit\", said Tallarico who has never taken a pay- check from Video Games Live over the 13 years since it was created, \"this is about continuing to prove to the world how culturally significant and artistic video games have become and to provide the highest possible quality to the fans around the world. We are very transparent in the numbers for the project and have listed a complete budget for everything. I wish more Kickstarter projects would do this.\" There are over 110 different Rewards offered through the LEVEL 4 project as top game composers and developers from around the world band together once again to help create something special for audiences around the world.

ANGELO DELOS REYES was known for taking exclusive photos of celebrities and for his concert photography in the Philippines. He continued his entertainment work in the United States for JI-ENT until his passing in 2014. We honor Angelo Delos Reyes for his contribution to JI-ENT. Photos by Angelo Delos Reyes | Article by Dennis A. Amith few days before J-Pop Summit ^^^U Festival was about to take place, I spoke to our Bay Area photogra- pher Angelo Delos Reyes via cell. He was excited about joining me and a few of our staff for an excit- A ing weekend and also wanting to ^^f^^ m ^^/^^ m take pictures especially video as it became his latest hobby as of late. As Angelo was the ultimate foodie and known for treating himself to the best cuisine that money can buy, my last words to him, I said jokingly, \"I'll buy you dinner but don't expect me to spend too much on you.\" He laughed, knowing I spent quite a bit for his lunch and dinner at a New York Yankees vs. Oakland Athletics baseball game just weeks before but how he was looking forward to seeing me and my brother Charles at the event. And then a two days later, receiving a message from his niece that Angelo had passed away. Needless to say, I was in disbelief and as I type this article, I am still in disbelief that my mentor, my friend and our JI- ENT photographer is gone. Angelo was one of the few people who was around when J!-ENT was created in 1993. Back then, Angelo and I were passionate about Japanese culture. We discovered the anime series \"Ranma 1/2\" and \"Video Girl Ai\" and it would be the catalyst for us to join a local anime club. In fact, he was there with me when I pur- chased my first LaserDisc player, Super VHS and television, so we could watch \"Tenchi Muyou\" and \"Bubble Gum Crisis\" NOVEMBER 2014 j-entonline.com I JI-ENT 17 J!-ENT 2014 ANNUAL ANGELO DELOS REYES (1966-2014) \\\\\\ in better quality. But he was also making occassional trips to Japan Town in San Francisco to purchase rental videos of \"Music Sta- tion\" and \"Count Down TV\" and give them to me, knowing I was starting to have a huge interest in J-Pop. But music was important for Angelo. Despite his later years having an interest in more high-technology, music was his escape. Many times we would discuss music and he would discuss Noriko Sakai, KISS, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, Joey Albert and more. And as an entertainment photographer in the Philip- pines, he was known for being a perfectionist but also an innovator when it came to concert photographer, shooting photos of Gary Valenciano, Martin Nievera, Keno, to name a few. He would have light techniques that you would think was done on Photoshop but the truth was he never used ed- iting software for his photography for us. His photos would be given to us as is with no editing and we would be amazed of how his photos were. For our 20th Anniversary J! -ENT annual in 2013, Angelo wrote about one of his favorite moments working for Jl-ENT and that was being invited by rock guitarist, SUGIZO, for dinner and sitting with him in the car and sharing his photos with him but also covering the group, Red Bacteria Vacuum. For 2014, Angelo's final coverage for Jl-ENT was for Japan Nite in San Francisco, covering Jungles from Red Bacteria Vacuum. One of our last conversations was how he was ready to purchase a new DSLR and was looking forward to take advantage of the new technology as he was a photographer that loved using film. When he transitioned to digital, his focus was on better lenses and not worrying about upgrad- ing unless he really needed to. Unfortunately, Angelo had passed away too early. But for those who knew him, will know that despite any hard- ships he had lived, he tried to live life the best he can. For me, having grown up with Angelo, I am forever grateful to him. For if he never introduced me to Japanese music shows, dramas and entertainment, there would be no Jl-ENT. While Jl-ENT s original origins were coverage of anime, sci-fi and video games, it was our coverage of Japanese mu- sic and dramas that help build Jl-ENT and over the years, that synergy would go on for us to cover entertainment worldwide. So, I will always remember Angelo for his contributions to Jl-ENT. In honor of Angelo Delos Reyes, we present several photos taken by him for Jl-ENT (2004-2014). Thank you Angelo. We will miss your wonderful photography but most importantly, we will miss you! Rest in peace. 18 Jl-ENT I j-entonline.com A ['-EM 5FECJAL f £ AT R. E ARTICLE BY DENNIS A.

In an industry where many watches are feted with many prizes in many countries each year, one award stands far above all the others. It is the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Geneve. Founded in 2001, it immediately became the watch industry's \"Os- cars\" and its award ceremony is now firmly established, alongside the Baselworld Fair, as one of the key dates in the watch- making calendar. On October 31, the 2014 Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Geneve award ceremony took place at the Grand Theatre de Geneve. 17 awards were made in total, most of which rewarded watches in specific categories such as \"Tourbillon\", \"Chronograph\" and \"Jewellery. \"The \"Petite Aiguille\" category, in contrast, was open to any watch of any type under Sfr 8,000 in price and, as usual, attracted a large entry. From the short list of six, the jury of 25 watch and luxury experts selected the Grand Seiko Hi- Beat 36000 GMT Limited Edition as the winner. Seiko Watch Corporation is delighted and deeply honored to receive this award. For over half a century, Grand Seiko has been the very best of Seiko, and to see its beauty, durability, legibility and watchmaking excellence recognised by the most prestigious award in the industry is the greatest possible tribute to the Grand Seiko watchmakers and designers, past and present, who have dedicated their skill and talent to the creation of this remarkable collection. The watch that won the \"Petite Aiguille\" award was first revealed at Baselworld 2014. It is the Hi-beat 36000 GMT Limited Edition (SBGJ005). In both performance and appearance, it expresses the very best of Seiko's mechanical watchmaking. The caliber has a high accuracy of +5 to -3 seconds a day and a power reserve of 55 hours. The GMT hand can be used as a dual time indicator with the hour hand being adjustable independently as the time of day hands continue to mark time. It is the perfect watch for the international traveler. Commenting on the award, the President of Seiko Watch Corporation, Shinji Hattori said, \" I am very grateful to the GPHG and its jury for their decision to award to Grand Seiko this most prestigious accolade. For 50 years, our Grand Seiko team has worked tirelessly to create the best possible functional watch in the world. The Hi-beat 36000 caliber is our proud- est achievement so far and this award will spur us on to new achievements in the future.\" For full details of all the awards, please see the official website of the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Geneve at: http://www.gphg.org/horlogerie/ en JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL FASHION: KAWAIILAND NYC \\\\\\ A JOURNEY TO KAWAIILAND NYC L.E. Miller travels to New York City for KAWAIILAND NYC for art, fashion and rock n' roll. Article & Photography by L.E. MILLER espite the name, \"Kawaiiland NYC\" was not simply a J-Pop event. While Japan was heavily represented from the Pocky sponsorship, to Gyaru, to Lolita accessories for sale, all sorts of independent art was represented. For instance, the headlining band of the eve- ning \"Nylon Pink\" performed a set of hard-rock covers of K- Pop hits such as SNSD's \"Run Devil Run\" to a very receptive crowd. A Japanese Idol influenced performance by Bubble Pop, and an Avant Garde monologue/performance to western music by Kitty Pryde also provided live music for the night, but undoubtedly the main attraction was the fashion show. Lasting around an hour, dozens of looks from House of Correia, Chain Candy, Lita Amelia, Sunshine and Bravado, Belladonna, and Wear The Pain took the stage to popping flashbulbs. It was a exercise in extremes; swimwear, lolita, sweat shirts, and pip-up on stage together. Unfortunately, the event was rather short, with the crowd being ushered out around 10:30, as the venue had a nightclub event to host later in the night. Hey, its NYC! Midnight isn't too late to start a party on a Friday. It might even be early. 28 JI-ENT I j-entonline.com NOVEMBER 2014 /// FASHION: KAWAIILAND NYC JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL FASHION: KAWAIILAND NYC \\\\\\ /// FASHION: KAWAIILAND NYC J!-ENT 2014 ANNUAL /// FASHION @ J-POP SUMMIT FESTIVAL JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL OH, SO KAWAII!

Article & Photography by Dennis A. Amith arajuku Kawaii. It was a big part of the 2013 J-Pop Summit Festival thanks to appearances by 6% DOKI- DOKFs Sebastian Masuda and the Harajuku Kawaii models but also, the event was highlighted by a live performance by Kyary Pamyu Pamyu. And for 2014, J-Pop Summit Festivals goal was to incorporate more of the Harajuku Kawaii fashion with models showcasing \"ma chere Cosette\", which specializes in French-retro accessories. As the audience went crazy over the accessories and fashion, they were then treated to another style of fashion courtesy of KERA magazine fashion model, Akira. Best known for her single \"Aoki Tsuki Michite\" for the TV anime series \"Black Butler - Book of circus\" but also for her gothic style and also, as one Japanese pop star told me, \"woman who looks like man\". The next fashion show followed up with models sporting \"Aymmy in the batty girls\" featuring local models plus ap- pearances with Harajuku Kawaii models Misa Kimura, Una and Aymmy fashion designer, Ayumi Seto. The fashion show culminated with a fashion contest in which attendees were able to showcase their \"kawaii fashion\" and were judged by Ayumi Seto, Misa Kimura and Una. There is no doubt that Harajuku Kawaii fashion has found a home at J-Pop Summit Festival and the reception for it has been wonderful. We look forward to Harajuku Kawaii fashion in 2015!

BLACK DIAMOND is the most famous and the largest Kuro-gyaru (tanned skin gals) group that was formed back in 2012. Consisting of 150 members from all over Japan, their fashion style revived and evolved the \"Ganguro\" fashion trend, which started in the mid-90s in Shibuya, Tokyo. Interview by Dennis A. Amith or many years, \"Ganguro\" fashion has ^^^J permeated in Shibuya, Tokyo. There U ^ is no doubt that the fashion trend has U M been looked at with awe and for some, ^^Hl^^^H to their chagrin. U But for those who have watched Japa- U nese variety television shows, they may U have seen talent being converted into Kuro-gyaru by a group known as Black Diamond. And as evidence by the large number of members within Black Diamond, there is no sign of the fashion trend waning. And in July 2014, members of Black Diamond embarked on a trip to California to showcase their fashion style and also to promote their singles \"Avant Gyarude\" and \"Crazy Tribe/Persona\". Recently, J! -ENT had the opportunity to interview Black Diamond members Rise, Harutamu and Pomitan. J!-ENT: How did you get involved with the Gyaru-kei? POMITAN: When I was still in elementary school, my dad brought me a magazine and said, \"I found a magazine that you might be interested in\" and the magazine was \"Egg\" (a magazine that featured Gyaru culture). I was inspired by the fashion and by Tsubasa Matsuwaka and what I saw on television of Matsuwaka. HARUTAMU: When I was in elementary school, I was a big fan and was inspired by Ayumi Hamasaki. I was then inspired later by Manba (white makeup above and below the eye) and it would lead to me interested in Gyaru culture. RISE: When I was in elementary school, I went by a shop and immediately was captivated by the fashion, the makeup and colors. I started reading the magazines and eventually got into Gyaru-kei. NOVEMBER 2014 j-entonline.com I JI-ENT 59 JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL BLACK DIAMOND \\\\\\ J!-ENT: I read there are 150 members of Black Diamond. But how do you all come up with the decision, for example, which members would get to come to California? HARUTAMU: There is a producer at Black Diamond who selects individuals based on singing, shodo and people who stick out. So, they are selected by those standards. J!-ENT: I saw quite a few Americans at J-Pop Sum- mit Festival who loved the gyaru culture. And for those just discovering it, are there any stores or online sites that you recommend to them? HARUTAMU: I recommend for them to visit Shibuya and go to stores like 109. But there are a number of stores in Shibuya and Harajuku. There's not many places like before but they should be able to find stores that showcase Gyaru-kei. J!-ENT: Curious, what is the most expensive mer- chandise that you purchased for yourself in rela- tion to Gyaru-kei? HARUTAMU: The dying of the hair and the painting of the nail colors can be expensive, because they only will last for a month. So, you have to keep doing it and it cost about $200-$300 each time. J!-ENT: Pomitan, with nails so long, how often do you break them? POMITAN: The nails are actually quite strong but I unfortunately broke one the other day. J!-ENT: I heard that due to a flight problem, you were unable to do any sight-seeing in San Francis- co but you did have fun in Los Angeles. HARUTAMU: It was awesome and we had so much fun! RISE: Yes! We went to Venice Beach and Santa Monica. J!-ENT: What was your expectations prior to com- ing to the United States to perform? HARUTAMU: I know that Gyaru-kei may not be well- known in the United States but it was nice to see people who would do the parapara with us. So, that made me happy. J!-ENT: Rise and Harutamu, you are both pro- ducing a fashion brand known as Galeo. Can you please tell us more about it? RISE: The concept of Galeo was created because we would hear from those overseas that a lot of Gyaru-kei clothes do not fit. So, we are making variety of sizes for women and the theme of the brand is \"Get wild and be sexy\" for independent women. This is not only for Japa- nese gyarus but also for foreign gyarus. J!-ENT: Was the process of creating your first two singles difficult? HARUTAMU: It was challenging. POMITAN: When we decided to make the CD, it took about two months because of all our schedules and we live in different areas. So, we were able to create the first single during our offtime. J!-ENT: Can you tell us more about your second single \"CRAZY TRIBE/PERSONA\". POMITAN: Like the first single, it was very difficult to make because of our job schedules and trying to get everyone together for at the same place. We didn't really practice much and we learned the song in a few hours, practiced and recorded it. After finishing the recording, there were a few things that we wanted to fix. But after those few changes, we were OK for the release of the second single. JI-ENT: You made new fans of gyaru-kei with BLACK DIAMOND coming to America. What final words would you like to leave with your American fans/supporters? POMITAN: We have all have our own individual websites but we do post our updates and information on Facebook and Twitter. But please visit our website (blackdiamond.jp), our Facebook site (https://www.facebook.com/ GalUnitBlackDiamond) and our Twitter site (https://twitter.com/bdiajp) for more information. HARUTAMU: We are very happy to have received support from American fans and we will continue to create more promotions and activities. So, please continue to support us. ■ 54 JI-ENT I j-entonline .com NOVEMBER 2014 /// BLACK DIAMOND JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL BLACK DIAMOND \\\\\\ /// BLACK DIAMOND JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL BLACK DIAMOND JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL BLACK DIAMOND \\\\\\ /// BLACK DIAMOND @ J-POP SUMMIT FESTIVAL: PHOTOS BY DARREN YAMASHITA JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL BLACK DIAMOND @ J-POP SUMMIT FESTIVAL: PHOTOS BY DARREN YAMASHITA \\\\\\ 0 YOU JUST BLEW $10,000.

Amith, Jl-ENT JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL ART: THE CLARK CENTER FOR JAPANESE ART & CULTURE \\\\\\ ^Hp^^^M or over 20 years, the Clark Center for Japanese Art and Culture in m Hanford, California, has provided ^^J^^^^v magnificent exhibitions of art- V work to many people in the local area but also many who travel to see artwork that you will never ^^^^^^ see at many of the major art mu- seums in the country. Founded by Willard \"6111\" Clark and Elizabeth \"Libby\" Clark, the Clark Center for Japanese Art and Culture is a fascinating place to visit. For one, its not your typical mu- seum type of location. In fact, its located far from the city and hidden in an almond orchard where the Clarks reside. But several yards away from their home is where the Clarks private collection was held. With one office featuring staff offices and the local store, the other was an exhibition room featuring artwork that revolved around a certain theme every three months. As small as the location was, the Clark Center for Japanese Art and Culture housed nearly 1,700 priceless objects (valued at $25 million) dating back for as far as seven centuries and was no doubt one of California's rare gems dedicated to Japanese art. But as Bill and Debby Clark are in their 80 s, the Clarks decided to donate their private collection to the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and not leave their children the financial burden involved in preserving the fragile artwork. The acquisition by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts will now make the museum, one of the top five museums in the nation with an extensive collection of Japanese art. Currently, the Clark Center for Japanese Art and Culture is featuring the \"33 Dances: Japanese Calligraphy from the 16th Century\" which will run through December 6th. A farewell exhibition will run from Feb. 3 -June 30 and the Center s extensive bonsai collection will be transferred to the Golden State Bonsai Federation and will be placed in the Shinzen Friendship Garden in Fresno. 72 JI-ENT I j-entonline.com NOVEMBER 2014 /// ART: THE CLARK CENTER FOR JAPANESE ART & CULTURE JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL Jl-ENT 2014 ANNUAL ART: THE CLARK CENTER FOR JAPANESE ART & CULTURE \\\\\\ APRIL 3-5, 2015 WASHINGTON CONVENTION JUMP RIGHT IN All ages, 100% volunteer & non-profit Truly \"by the fans, for the fans\" 24 hours a day-round the clock anime, manga & more Traditional cultural presentations, artists, educators & performers Dances that literally rock the house Cosplay, dances, guests, fan panels, local artists & much more! 3 LEARN MORE Like us on Facebook facebook.com/SakuraCon Follow us on Twitter twitter.com/SakuraCon Visit our Website www.SakuraCon.org She is one of the most talented but also private shojo manga artists in Japan...

With a professional career that started back in 1986 with the manga series \"Hana no Hi ni Aitai\", followed by her first major series in 1988 titled \"Kimi ni Botan no Namida\". Rinko Ueda also released two other titles in 1988 titled \"Onaji Yume wo Kazoete\" and \"Prism ga Koibi- to . In the '90s, Ueda released three more manga se- ries: \"Kiss wa Me ni Shite\", \"Shin Gakuen Tengoku\" and the successful Margaret Comic series \"Ryou\". By 2000, the decade would be one of her busies with the release of \"Panpu Appu\" (Pump Up!) and the very popular series \"Tsuki no Shippo\" (Tail of the Moon, 2002) and \"Hadashi de Bara wo Fume\" (Stepping on Roses, 2008) which were released in the United States courtesy of Viz Media. Rinko would go on to work on \"Cho Tokkyu Hi- yokko\" (2009), \"Margaret Best Selection: Not Friend, But...\" (2011) and Sakura Juuyuushi\" (2012), followed by \"Sakura Juuyuushi 2\" in 2013. In fall 2014, Rinko Ueda returned with two new titles, a series titled \"Maria no Shiro\" and a one-shot manga titled \"Hoikumen!\". A busy manga artist but also a busy mother of two children, throughout her career as a manga artist, Rinko Ueda is known to be one of the most private manga artists in Japan. And a mangaka, who prefers to let her work speak for itself. Despite her private nature, JI-ENT recently inter- viewed Rinko Ueda in regards to her manga career. JI-ENT: Before we discuss your career, let's get to know you a little better. Your name is Tomoko but you go by Rinko. How did you get your pen name? RINKO: My real name is ±ffifmr? and the pro- nunciation is Tomoko but the kanji also has another pronunciation and it is Rinko. JI-ENT: What was your favorite manga growing up? RINKO: Tomoko Sasaki's \"Doubutsu no Oishasan\" (Animal Doctor) JI-ENT: Do you have a favorite manga that you are reading now? RINKO: Kazuhiko Shimamoto's \"Aoihonoo\". ~0 O 2 > o o JI-ENT: Prior to becoming a manga artist, did you receive any formal training as an artist? RINKO: Just in high school. My major was in art and that is where we learned the basics of painting during art class. JI-ENT: And from there, what led you to become an artist? RINKO: Just out of pure happiness of drawing a picture from what I have imagined. JI-ENT: Did you know that you have fans following your work in the United States and around the world? RINKO: A few years ago, I read a book about Japanese culture and in the book, a high school student in the United States said he liked \"Tail of the Moon\". I was very surprised! JI-ENT: Was there any certain manga artist that inspired you? RINKO: All manga artists give me inspiration. 78 JI-ENT I j-entonline.com NOVEMBER 2014 /// MANGA: RINKO UEDA J!-ENT 2014 ANNUAL JI-ENT: Prior to having a career as a manga artist, did you ever contemplate other jobs? RINKO: Not really. JI-ENT: While your professional debut as a manga art- ist was back in 1989 with \"Kimi ni Botan no Namida\", what was your actual debut as a manga artist? RINKO: That would be \"Hana no Hi ni Aitai\" (editor's note: This was created back in 1986 when Rinko was graduating from junior high). JI-ENT: And from there, how did you get involved in the manga industry? RINKO: I would again and again, send submissions to man- ga magazines. JI-ENT: And was it a difficult process of getting your manga published? RINKO: Before I became a professional manga artist, just only in half a year, I sent around seven works to the publisher. Six of them were not good enough but finally the last one was published. JI-ENT: For you, how do you find inspiration to create a story or characters that are fresh and new for each series? RINKO: I receive inspiration of ideas in moments such as when it is raining, whenever I am listening to the radio or even when I am drying the laundry. JI-ENT: I know in America, two of your manga titles were released: \"Tail of the Moon\" and \"Stepping on Roses\". But of all the titles you have created and were not released in the U.S., which title would you like to see released? RINKO: \"Ryou\" JI-ENT: Speaking of \"Ryou\", I met you for the first time when you were working on that series. But I'm curious, how have you changed as an artist from that time? RINKO: I was often working at night when I met you at that time. But now I start to work very early in the morning because of raising my children. JI-ENT: What I love about your artwork is that it looks so complex. But I have seen you sketch and you are very quick as an artist. But I'm curious, of all the man- ga that you have created, what was the most challeng- ing title and why? RINKO: That would be \"Home\". It is a story about Spain back in the 15th Century. A Spanish girl was the protagonist in the manga series. You can now read it for free at http:// www.zeppan.com/book/detail/41 181.

The characters? The drama? RINKO: I think that it's important of whether or not it would be an interesting story involving the charac- ters. JI-ENT: For your American fans that love \"Tail of the Moon\" and \"Stepping on Roses\", what is the inspiration when you created both manga series? RINKO: For both series, when I drew them, I try to make an effort to be able to create an exciting story for the readers. JI-ENT: Do you have a consistent theme throughout your works? RINKO: Pretty much to experience an exciting view of the world. JI-ENT: While I was doing my research on your career, I realized that back in '93, your manga \"Kiss wa Me ni Shite\" was made into an OVA. What was that experience to see your manga made into an anime and are you open to seeing your manga work being animated? RINKO: That was once upon a time and when I think about it now, it's too embarrassing. JI-ENT: Are you familiar with American comics? And do you see a difference between Japanese and American comic books? RINKO: I'm not too familiar with American comic books but I do know the biggest difference is the space of the frames. JI-ENT: Let's get to know more about you out- side of manga. When you are not busy working on manga or with family, what hobbies do you enjoy? RINKO: I listen to the radio and I also watch movies. JI-ENT: If you had one advice to give to someone who wants to learn how to draw in manga style or wants to be an artist in general, what advice would you give to them? RINKO: Learn to draw may pieces but most impor- tantly, to draw many pieces without any rest. JI-ENT: In every JI-ENT interview, I have a wordplay. This one is \"Fill in the blank\", I will give you five sentences and you complete it: a. Before I work on a manga, I like to . RINKO: Drink coffee b. When I go to the grocery store, I always have to buy ? RINKO: Tomatoes c. The last movie I watched in the theater was . RINKO: \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" d. The character that I really enjoyed drawing the most is RINKO: Nozomu Ijuin from \"Hadashi de Bara o Fume\" (Stepping on Roses) d. My favorite pen/pencil I used to draw my work is RINKO: Zebra New Spiral CC What final words do you have for your fans worldwide? RINKO: I will continue to draw more interesting manga.

Amith PHOTOGRAPHY FROM Q&A MICHELLE TYMON 82 Jl-ENT I j-entonline.com NOVEMBER 2014 /// RANGE MURATA JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL For many amme fans, Japanese artist and designer Renji (Range) Murata is best known for his work on \"Last Exile\", the sequel \"Last Exile - Fam,The Silver Wing-\", Blue Submarine No. 6\" and \"Shan- gri-La\". He has published more than a dozen books such as \"robot\", \"rule\", \"futurhythm\" and was voted \"Best Artist of the Year\" for the Seiun Award back in 2006. He also is involved in releasing figures and sculptures based on his art as well. Range Murata recently took part in a press conference at Sakura-Con. RANGE MURATA: My name is Range Murata and I come from Japan. I'm an illustrator and I do a lot of anthology work and I'm also involved with anime as well. Your art style is very unique, how did you come to evolve your sci-fi style? RANGE MURATA: When I gradu- ated high school and went to col- lege. I went to an art school but I also took some regular classes, one of them was anatomy. And when I studied anatomy, I looked at how the body was put togeth- er and how the muscles were put together, so I was looking into not lines but areas and that's how it affected my art style. So, at the time, I was able to look at manga and understand how the lines put together to form those parts, but that is how I started to draw something in lines and that was where my style would begin. And also, I am interested in vin- tage-retro things as well and I try to take those things in account as well, so I try to take those things in account when I'm designing the clothing of characters and also mecha. JI-ENT: Did you have any anime or manga that you enjoyed as a child? RANGE MURATA: So, I definitely liked specific things like \"Gan- ba no Boken\", \"Yatterman\" and \"Gundam\". Can you go more into your thoughts on the creation of male characters? RANGE MURATA: As far as drawing male characters, because I draw female characters as cute, I kind of gone the opposite direc- tion of men where I draw them with stark lines and angular. So, that is how I have been drawing and worked so hard in that direc- tion that now it's impossible for me to draw them the other way. JI-ENT: A lot of work that you have done are character de- signs, but I've read that when you attended Osaka Art Col- lege, your focus was on car design. When you first got into the anime industry, was your goal to focus on mechanical design or was character-based design your main passion? (sec- ond part question) Would you ever want to be involved in gi- ant robot mecha anime design? RANGE MURATA: When I was in college, I was in an industri- al design or course, so I didn't draw just cars but other industrial items, sewing machines, the sort of things, the electronics that would be tablets. I worked in that design, I worked in regular courses such as coloring and blue printing. So, when I became an illustrator, I started off in illustra- tions such as manga, so it's from those works that the anime indus- try would notice me and I would get calls to work with them. And even in my illustrations, I have been drawing bikes and things like mecha, clothing and I was invited to design the ships in \"Last Exile\" and the motorcycles in \"Solty Rei\". Since you implied our work in industrial design, what is your inspiration behind some of the designs in your illustration such as the airship wingchair? Do you foresee yourself going back into those areas? RANGE MURATA: So, of course, in my drawings, I would take into account of what I do. But I draw things such as vehicles, clothes and other things. I, of course, buy furniture, shoes and I purchase these things in my everyday life, and I purchase things that I really like the design of. And I take the nuances and put those into my designs. So, the airship wingchair, that you are talking about, I was going to work with a furniture company in a project and have some samples in my home. But unfortunately the company went under before the full project went into frui- tion. It was unfortunate but it was a great experience. But in my designs, it's hard to make big things, but I would love to make furniture again, but smaller things like bags, glasses, would prob- ably be a lot easier. So, I would love to do something like that very soon as well. You have been successful with your art books, anthologies and also your PSE figure collections. But is there a big part of you that wants to see your original characters like \"Chris\" in ani- mated format? NOVEMBER 2014 j-entonline.com I JI-ENT 83 RANGE MURATA: I am an illus- trator but not a manga artist, so I don't draw anything with a story. But obviously, coming up a sto- ryline around a character would involve someone to help create the scenario and story, but it would be a challenge but it would be something that I would be very interested in. JI-ENT: Do you picture your orignal characters having back stories? RANGE MURATA: There is a little of that, but I don't necessarily think about the personality of the characters. I don't think about who they are interacting with, but although the characters have a shape of a person, my illustra- tions are one image of graphic design, so I think of the shapes, where the colors may go and it becomes my work of art. I ap- proach of it as a graphic design perspective, so I don't think about a story behind a character. So, as a graphic designer, and if you are designing a sign, you would think about the color and the font and where you placed the text. I approach my art in the same way. You are always taking a camera along with you. What colors and shapes inspire you to take a photograph? RANGE MURATA: I like to take pictures of things with a stark contrast. For example, the sun was coming out of the clouds and hitting a building and the light was reflecting off another building. The space between buildings, things like that is what I enjoy taking pictures of be- cause they are so interesting. Of course, I take pictures of my food and everything too. JI-ENT: What are your favorite hobbies right now? RANGE MURATA: Taking pic- tures is one of my hobbies, I'm also interested in bicycles, cars and things with wheels. I also en- joy glasses and clothes but most recently, I'm interested in taking pictures and in the past, I would try to do my best with older analog cameras but now I have all these digital cameras. With the advent of digital cameras, I have picked up the hobby strongly and now I am very much into it! JI-ENT: You have come to the United States as a guest to sev- eral conventions for years now. But I was wondering, each time you come to America, is there something you always want to 84 JI-ENT I j-entonline.com NOVEMBER 2014 /// RANGE MURATA JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL eat or buy? RANGE MURATA: I usually try to eat things with meat like ham- burgers. When I first came here in 2000 # I was surprised by the amount of food that you get and the size of the portions were huge and strongly favored. At the time, I would eat the food but after sev- eral days, I wanted to eat some- thing with lighter flavor. But now when I come here, I have become used to it and now I want to eat all American food. So, in America, things are extreme, the portions are extreme, the sandwiches are huge, the food are strongly fla- vored. Even the donuts are crazily colored and you never see that in Japan. And you eat them, your teeth start to hurt but that is one thing I noticed about American food. Can you tell us more about how you worked on \"Last Exile\"? RANGE MURATA: It was around the time I was finishing up \"Blue Submarine No. 6\". The scenario for that work for Yamaguchi was actually a fan of my dojinshi. It was a time when I wasn't well- known and I only released a few dojinshi, but he took those and showed the director Maeda of \"Last Exile\" and he liked them. So, they decided to hire me for the project. I was not sure if I would do any good. I worked on the video game but never on anime, so I was unsure of myself but that is how I came together to work on the project. JI-ENT: If you weren't working in this industry, what industry would you want to work in? RANGE MURATA: I don't think I can work on anything else... I think I would be homeless. I would probably be a NEET and never come out of my room. Give me your impression of the current production cycle of a series for when animation was done by eel and now is being done via digital? RANGE MURATA: I have never worked with cell before. \"Blue Submarine No. 6\" was the first anime ever made completely digitally, so I'm not familiar with the changes from cell to digital or how things were done before and unfamiliar with the chang- es. Although, I have heard from those in the industry talk about how difficult it was back then to work with eels. I do know that the animators still do the same work, the inbetweeners till do the same work but the process of coloring a cell and taking a photo of it has become digi- tal. But I heard there was a lot of work in the original process to make a smooth animation. Those who took photos of the eels had a special skillset for that job and there were things such as shining light on a eel to make an expression in the animation. But there were very specific methods to make eel animation but I have heard recently that a lot of the people who used to do that work are no longer employed and companies that specilized in that work, have closed down. But I do think the advent of digital animation, that people can see a broad range of new expressions in animation. Is there any artists or illustra- tors that you look up to? RANGE MURATA: The man- ga artist Kamijo Atsushi (best known for his manga \"Mob Hunter\") is one of my favorites and I recently had the chance to meet him. His art is so cool but he is also very cool as a person! So, as far as American artists, Alex Ross is a big name, but I like him. For illustrators, I like Nor- man Rockwell and I definitely like other American artists, such as music artist Bruce Springsteen. What do you think of Seattle? RANGE MURATA: I have been to America several times before but this is my first time in Seattle. Going to Seattle is representative of how I imagined American be- ing. When I was looking at news- papers or magazines as childs, and seeing the wideness of the streets were large, the traffic lights are how I pictured Amer- ica as a child. So, the first time coming here is almost nostalgic. The food is also great. I also enjoy the clam chowder and have had crab last night! I wish there were less portions, that would be great. There was a crab leg this big and there was two of them, I wasn't sure how to eat all of it. (laughing) Do you have anything that you are working on right now? RANGE MURATA: I really can t discuss what I am working on right now but I am working on two anime projects. And as for other things that I am working on, I am working on anthologies and illustrations. ■ ^iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiij- = For more on Range Murata, E E please visit his website at: http://www.pseweb.com/ =tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiirf NOVEMBER 2014 j-entonline.com I JI-ENT 85 He is best known for directing anime series such as \"Mushishi\" and \"Detroit Rock City\", but with a career as an animator and now as a director, HIROSHI NAG AH AM A discusses his career in the anime industry. By Michelle Tymon & Dennis A. Amith, Photography by Michelle Tymon ^h^^m or animator Hiroshi Nagahama, he's had a strong career as an animator. From be- ^ ing the mechanical designer of the classic m anime \"The Cockpit\" and later becoming H^^^^ a storyboard writer and animation direc- ^ tor best known for works on series such as openings for \"Doraemon\", \"Pokemon\", \"Fruits Basket\", \"Kimi ni Todoke\", Hiro- ^^I^^B shi Nagahama would move on to bigger responsibilities a few years later. Best known for directing \"Mushishi\", \"Detroit Metal City\", \"Aku no Hana (The Flowers of Evil)\" and a few Hatsune Miku music videos, Hiroshi Nagahama was busy with the second season of \"Mushishi: Zoku-Sho\". To promote his latest work, Hiroshi Nagahama was among one of the guests at Sakura Con 2014 in Washington. The following is a transcript of Q&A that were asked during the press conference which took place at Sakura Con 2014. HIROSHI: My name is Hiroshi Nagahama and I am an an- imator designer but more recently, I have done more directing in recent years. I'm not sure how many times I have come to the United States because I have lost count. But as far as re- cent works, I have directed the opening for \"Fruits Basket\", the opening for \"Pokemon\", \"Doraemon\" and \"Anpanman\". But the project that I directed responsibly was \"Mushishi\", the \"Detroit Metal City\" OVA and \"Aku no Hana\" which was shot in roto- scope. And most recently, I was contacted to direct the second season of \"Mushishi\". Of all the series that you have done, which one is your favorite? 86 JI-ENT I j-entonline .com NOVEMBER 2014 /// HIROSHI NAGAHAMA JI-ENT 2013 ANNUAL HIROSHI: You know... It may sound like the diplomatic answer but I think it is hard to pick any one. I feel really committed to \"Mushishi\" because that was the first project that I had a big role but any production that I am involved in, I always try to dedicate my skills have to offer to the series. But I would be hard pressed to pick one series out of all of them. JI-ENT: What has been the biggest influence for your career? Any mov- ies, anime, manga? HIROSHI: There are so many things that influence me and my decisions and the things I create. The process is always constant and always ever evolving. I see something new and I want to do something with it. So, it is really hard to pick one thing. But if there was one thing that left a lasting impression is the manga \"Cyborg 009\". It really taught me about how to express a story. \"Cyborg 009\" is not your average cookie cutter story where it's all happy. There is a lot of hardships that are told in this story and the way they had to fight evil, it just so happened that people are forced into that situation. Even when I was a child, I always thought it would be awesome to become a cyborg. But reading the story, understanding the drama and seeing the hardships makes you want to reconsider if you want to have super powers, if you want to become a cyborg. And while I was in that state of shock, I also happen to get my toes wet with American comics, specifi- cally \"Spider-Man\". And those two titles matched and it helped make me thing of what was the meaning of power and what responsibilities come with that. I for one, am left-handed. So, I see a lot of those situations of being an outcast and not being viewed as the same as everyone else. You mentioned rotoscoping in \"Aku no Hana\", could you tell us why you chose rotoscope? HIROSHI: Having read the original manga, the characters and everything... I didn't feel that it should be expressed in anime form, in terms of clean images, per- fectly sculpted designs. In fact, a lot of the darker sides of human emotion and drama, I thought really hard of how I can express that in animated form. And how rotoscope gives you a raw, dirty and warped image, I felt it was a good correlation of how the manga tries to approach and tell a story. I was impressed in a previous in- terview of how you expressed your thoughts on the \"Fruits Baskets\" opening and I wanted to know your thoughts of what went into the \"Mushishi\" opening? HIROSHI: The original manga for \"Mushishi\" had a real wide spectrum of fans and it was interesting of why they did this and that. In anime, among ani- mators, there is a phenomenon of those who are anime watchers and those who do not watch anime. I really think it's not an understatement to say that late night anime has become the mainstream source of high quality animation. So, what I wanted to achieve and pursue is to capture that same demographic, those who don't necessarily watch anime, catch them when they come home and then get them to watch the show and possibly be engaged in it. To give you ancedote, an office lady who comes home late from work, she takes a shower and she comes out, wants to relax and watch TV. There are those who watch variety shows, action shows or anime, but if I can catch that person who normally doesn't watch anime, and I can get them to watch the opening, I really believe it would give it a fighting chance. They won't classify it as NOVEMBER 2014 j-entonline.com I JI-ENT 87 JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL HIROSHI NAGAHAMA an anime immediately. That's why I try to avoid using that anime style in my openings. I think once they watch the opening, it kind of gets their attention. Go to a commercial break and when it comes back and they will say \"oh, it's an anime\". And if they change the channel then, then that's on the anime. But if I can get people that far, get their foot through the door, I do believe I can convert a lot of new fans, like the kind of fans who do watch anime. So, that's what I wanted to do with the openiing. Having been so close to the original work of the manga of \"Mushishi\", I felt it was part of an intellectual property, a story that so many people can enjoy. What I really wanted to achieve in the opening was create a means for those not exposed to anime. So, even for the music, I chose a song where there was no Japanese lyrics because I believe that the lyrics might efFect how one judges a series before giving it a chance. Any sort of element that would limit the scope of how people would judge the series, I tried to eliminate those and work from there. With \"Aku no Hana\", was there a meaning to the end- ing theme song? HIROSHI: I'm going to completely be level with you. Trie way that anime openings work in the industry, a music label will collaborate with us and help produce these tracks. In this case, it was King Records. So, they come onboard as a spon- sor and their objective is to sell as many CD's as possible. And in order to do that, they try to push their agenda. As creative guys, we wanted to push an agenda that links the story to the music. So, what I did for \"Aku no Hana\", I told King Records that they can do whatever they want for the opening. They can send me an idol, they can send me anything they want, and we will create an opening that will suit their needs. However, let us do the ending. Because I feel that the ending credits make a bigger influence than the opening, you finish an episode, and then the emotion that you are left with at the end, must really link with the ending itself. So, I put a lot of effort to make this ending perfect. So, Oshima-sensei suggested \"Hana\" and this song in particular, he created the original work with the song in mind. So, it was really our agenda. People in our teamwere surprised. They were concerned and not sure if it would work, but Oshima-sensei and I felt it was the coolest song that we have ever heard. So, we told King Records that they could do the opening but we get to keep the ending and that is the story of how the song made it to the ending. In hindsight, some fans felt the song felt creepy and scary but it made us think twice about our decision. You are interested in appealing to a broader audience. Is there a dream project that you would love to do? Would you want to collaborate with Western stories or an 88 JI-ENT I j-entonline.com NOVEMBER 2014 /// HIROSHI NAGAHAMA J!-ENT 2014 ANNUAL original story? HIROSHI: Yes! I would absolutely love to. I truly believe that I was put in a room with someone that deals with media that is unrelated to anime, there would be many interesting conversations that would happen there. So, I had the op- portunity to work with a lot of artists as well and contrary to what I do by converting manga to anime, it opened my idea and shocked me about their thinking processs. I really believe that if I worked with someone in a completely different field or genre, whatever it is, the ultimate media we are creating, I would defnitely not turn down that opportunity or possibli- ty. There is a lot of instances of where you want to do certain things but obviously you can't. I look back on my past projects and I feel that timing was a big issue, but I felt fortunate for the opening of \"Fruits Baskets\", the director presented the song, but he said the song was quiet and soft and wasn't sure if it would work but I said I can make it work and this song will work and I can guarantee it. So, I created several storyboards in a day and presented it. It's not that I pursued that job, it fell in my lap in a weird way but it gave me the opportunity to create something, really my own. It came down to timing and the stars aligning and the same with \"Mushishi\" and \"Detroit Metal City\". I feel that projects I will work on in the future and I feel it is well-fat- ed and that timing and chance will give me the opportunity to work with other talented artists out there. J!-ENT: In American comics, there is good side and dark side. If you had a chance to take this theme on, who would you like to do? HIROSHI: Superman! I feel the brighter the light shines, the bigger shadow it casts. Because he is an iconic hero, if we ever had a chance to peek into his dark side, it goes really deep and there is a lot of pent up darkness. If that darkness ever surfaces, what if he switched sides? He would become the most powerful villain. That would be an interesting storyline to pursue and many comic book fans will always want to see that happen but there is a line that Superman never crosses because he is always protected by the writers because he never really goes completely dark. I read that you were involved with the X-Men anime? HIROSHI: Yes, I was involved in the \"X-Men\" anime, but unfortunately I didn't get to work in the United States. It was manufactured, created and produced in Japan. I would love to one day work in the United States but for an IP created in the US and done in Japan, there really isn't much of a big differ- ence. It's just the form that you express it and the core values and emotions you try to convey. There really wasn't much of a big difference at all. When it was first presented to me and I had to start making storyboards, the first thing that I saw, it wasn't that great. Having grown up reading the American comic books and the knowledge of the X-Men, the first thing I said was \"no, this is all wrong?\". For example, they had called Henry McCoy as \"Henry\" but I changed it to \"Hank\". So, these are the minor details that I changed along the way during the process but it was because of my love for the characters. ■ NOVEMBER 2014 j-entonline.com I JI-ENT 89 YOU DON'T WANT THEM RESPONDING TO YOUR TEXT.

With a 3D version of the film released in Sept. 16, 2011, \"The Lion King\" makes its debut on Blu-ray (2- disc) courtesy of a Diamond Edition on Oct. 4, 2011, as well as a 3D Blu- ray (4-Disc) and also an 8-disc \"The Lion King\" trilogy box set. To promote the release of \"The Lion King in 3D\" and \"The Lion King\" Blu-ray releases, J! -ENT re- cently took part in a media roundtable Q&A with \"The Lion King\" Super- vising Animator (for Pumbaa),Tony Bancroft. Here is a transcript from the Q&A: What were your visual inspira- tions for Pumbaa? TONY BANCROFT: As animators we always start with the real thing first. I spent almost 6 months in the beginning of the film just researching warthogs and African animals. It was a great time to soak in what the real an- imal looked like before I moved away from it and caricatured it. Besides re- ality, Ernie Sabella, the voice of 'Pum- baa' was a big influence. He has a very round and appealing smile that I knew just had to be a part of Tumbaa. How much was voice actor Ernie Sabella used as a live-action refer- 92 JI-ENT I j-entonline.com NOVEMBER 2014 /// THE LION KING: TONY BANCROFT Q&A (201 1) J!-ENT 2014 ANNUAL ence for the character of Pumbaa? TONY BANCROFT: A lot. Early in the process of making the film, I flew out to New York City with Mike Sur- rey, the animator on 'Timon, where both Ernie Sabella and Nathan Lane (Timon) were in \"Guys and Dolls\" to- gether on Broadway. It was a great edu- cation for me to see Ernie performing, to study his movements and actions. Then when I got back to my anima- tion desk I would try to incorporate as much as Ernie s acting style in my scenes. I think it really helped in bring- ing the character to life. J!-ENT: Looking back at the char- acter, is there anything you wish you had done differently? Tony Bancroft: Not really... since I was a first time Supervising Animator my mistakes had to do with manage- rial things that I was learning about leading a crew but also the work on the screen of which I am most proud of. I learned so much on this movie and it really changed the kind of artist I am now. JJ-ENT: What's the sequence you're most proud of in this film, and why? Tony Bancroft: That's a tough one, but I would have to say the sequence where Pumbaa is lying on his back looking up at the stars with Simba and Timon talking about what the stars are. I loved Pumbaa's response to Simba's thoughts on what the stars above re- ally were. He says, \"Aw, gee. . . I always thought they were balls of gas burning billions of miles away.\" That scene re- ally helped round out Pumbaa to be a more fully realized character. He's not dumb; he's just an innocent animal that follows Timon's lead. Once I animated that scene, I felt like I knew who his character was. What was it like working at Disney Animation during that period? TONY BANCROFT: Boy, it was a great time. Many of us on \"The Lion King\" were young animators that just had no fear of trying new things and we were totally focused on making great films. There was not a lot of pressure on us at the time because the studio did not ex- pect much from The Lion King at first so we felt creatively unharnessed. Will you say something to Viet- namese audiences who are urged to see The Lion King 3D at the end of this September? TONY BANCROFT: Yes, Xin Chao Vietnam! I am so happy to know that there are fans of The Lion King in Vietnam too. We made this film for the world so please enjoy this epic and fun story that we made for you and, as Pumbaa would say, \"Hakuna Matata\"! The Lion King is such a super clas- sic and popular story to millions of children all around the world through many 2D versions. Al- though the 3D movement is now in vogue, the Disney 2D anima- tion has become an irreplaceable trademark. Do you think remak- ing this film into 3D might be a double- edge sword? TONY BANCROFT: When I first heard that \"The Lion King\" was being made into a 3D version I must admit, I was skeptical. I wasn't sure what the technology would bring to our 2D ani- mation. Then I saw it and I was amazed at how it looked in 3D- how much it enhances the animation. When we cre- ated the film in 1994, we tried to make it as dimensional and real as we could with the technology during that time but now with stereoscopic technology it actually fully realizes the potential of what were trying to make. I think it actually improves the film. What was the most difficult aspect of animating Pumbaa, and why? TONY BANCROFT: Really trying to make a warthog appealing. They are really the ugliest animals in the animal kingdom so trying to make him cute was an ongoing battle. I'm pleased with the results though. I assume you have a personal col- lection of animation eels that you have collected over the years. What is the most curious and most interesting animation eel you have? TONY BANCROFT: Good question! I do love collecting artwork from anima- tion but not of my own, mostly art by my friends and mentors. Besides ani- mation drawings by my friends at the studio that I have framed on my walls, my favorite is an animation drawing of two of the dwarves in \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". It is a rough pencil drawing by Disney legend Fred- die Moore, and it is incredible. It has so much life in the drawing! It's an educa- tion in itself. Did you ask to supervise Pumbaa? What drew you to the character? TONY BANCROFT: No, actually I asked to work on 'Zazu' originally. Pumbaa and Timon, even at an early stage of the film, were the break out popular characters and they seemed out of my reach to even request as a first time Supervising Animator. Hav- ing just finished animating 'Iago' the parrot from \"Aladdin\", I thought, \"well, Iago s a bird and Zazu s a bird. . .maybe I have a shot!\" I was totally taken by surprise when the director s called me to offer me the character of Pumbaa! It was one of the happiest days of my life. What is your favorite character you have worked on? Why? TONY BANCROFT: Definitely, Pum- baa. I enjoyed all of the comedy char- acters I have worked on over the years (Iago, Kronk, Cogsworth, etc.) but there is a special place in my heart for Pumbaa. I think it was because he was my first character to supervise as an animator. Also, he and I have so much in common. Were both are overweight and enjoy a good bug every once in a while! When did you realize \"The Lion King\" was more than just a movie? NOVEMBER 2014 j-entonline.com I JI-ENT 93 JI-ENT 2014 ANNUAL THE LION KING: TONY BANCROFT (Q&A 201 1) \\\\\\ TONY BANCROFT: It's funny because at the time we had no idea that \"The Lion King\" would become the phe- nomenon that it has become. At the time, we thought it was just this fun lit- tle film with a quirky story about a lion cub in Africa that thinks he killed his father and has bug-eating friends set to music by Elton John. Not the normal Disney story for sure. It still amazes me that it is so well-loved around the world. What will the 3D technique bring to this new 3D version of The Lion King? TONY BANCROFT: I think if we had the technology of stereoscopic 3D in 1994 we would have used it in the making of this film. We really tried to make it as inclusive as we could for the audience with the technology we had at the time. Look at the wildebeest stampede scene for example. We made the wildebeests in CGI and lowered the camera down to the level of Sim- ba so that the audiences feel the fear of the little lion cub as they rush past him. In 3D that scene literally leaps out at you and makes it all the more fright- ening for little Simba. That alone is an improvement on the story telling and a great reason to have this new awesome version. JI-ENT: If you had any advice for anyone wanting to break into the industry, what advice would you give them? TONY BANCROFT: I still think it is so important that an animator knows how to draw really well even in this computer animation world we live in now. Drawing is a quick and easy way for an animator to communicate his ideas to a director or others before go- ing to his computer to flesh out a scene. But besides that, studying how people move and act around them is very im- portant. Watch your family around the house, how your dog moves, or how people interact at a bus stop. All of those things will help you bring a char- acter to life. Is there anything subtle in the movie that you see in it, that you'd like to point out to audiences? TONY BANCROFT: One of my all- time favorite movie moments hap- pened in \"The Lion King\". There is a scene where Simba after disobeying his father and going to the elephant grave- yard is walking back to home follow- ing behind his father. He knows he's in trouble and more than that; he feels like he will never live up to being the king that he is. Those feelings are summed up in one visual moment as Simba ac- cidentally steps into his fathers foot- print. The camera shows his little paw inside the huge footprint of his fathers and in that key visual scene, it says so much about not only their relationship but also the great responsibility Simba has in following his fathers \"footsteps\" in becoming the next king of the pride. To me, that is great film making! What are your thoughts on the di- rection animation has gone since \"The Lion King\"? TONY BANCROFT: Its a little bitter- sweet for me. I love 2D hand-drawn animation and it's hard to see the world of animation turn so much to CG an- imation. But I also love what CG an- imation has done for filmmaking in animation too. I think there's room for both techniques in the world of anima- 94 JI-ENT I j-entonline.com NOVEMBER 2014 /// THE LION KING: TONY BANCROFT (Q&A 201 1) J!-ENT 2014 ANNUAL tion and I hope to see it balanced out more in the future. JI-ENT: What do you enjoy the most about your job? TONY BANCROFT: I think I have the best job in the world! I love bringing characters to life through animation. Its a great feeling to go to a theater and sit with an audience that is seeing a movie I worked on and hearing them laugh or cry at a character I helped cre- ate. It's probably the biggest perk of what I do that I can move people in an emotional way. In countries where animated films are hard to survive, it is very dif- ficult for young animators to pur- sue their dreams. So what do you think that these people should do to keep themselves motivated, be- fore their passion runs out? TONY BANCROFT: I think for ani- mators, in countries where it is difficult to find work making animated features, it is important not to give up. There is a great big world out there through the Internet, so find different ways to get your animation out there t"
