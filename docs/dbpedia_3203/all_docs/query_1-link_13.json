        "text": "When I first got into Saiyuki, I shipped Sanzo and Goku and really wanted the series to be yaoi. Nowadays, I just wish there was some sort of romance in it at all. But I’m wondering… Do you think there’s any possibility for the series to end up being BL by the end? Do you think there’s any chance the guys could end up together? Any chance Gojyo and Hakkai might actually get married, for instance?\n\nI feel like it’s unlikely, since the series has gone on for so long without romance. Suddenly adding romance into the mix might make it a different sort of story. And the theme sort of revolves around independence. But there have been little snippets of romantic interactions between some characters in later chapters… like Goku and the youkai girl, or Hassan liking Sharaku Sanzo) And the series went from being a shounen to a josei. So maybe there’s still a chance for a new element like that to show up? What are your opinions on this? Do you think the guys will actually “end up together” in that sense?\n\nLike you, I think it’s unlikely there will be any super obvious romance between any of the guys.\n\nHowever, I would like to have an open ending with Hakkai and Gojyo that leaves open that possibility. I don’t want a ‘Harry Potter’ type ending where it end with a list of who they married and how many kids they had and their names. Because to me, if Gojyo and Hakkai live, I’d like to think they are going to spend the rest of their lives living together in that little cottage, or something like it. And you (general you, not specifically you) could see it as just two guys living together happily in platonic domestic bliss, or you could see it as more. It doesn’t have to spell out ‘romance’. But personally that’s what I’d like, that ending.\n\nI know that Hakkai says he wants to have that indestructible wife and many daughters, but I never really took that as a sincere literal wish, or that it was intended that way. I mean, I could write an essay about that scene in particular, but my conclusion is that considering all that Hakkai and Gojyo (and well, all of them) have gone through, I mean, not just on the journey, but before that. I think it’s going to be difficult, especially for Hakkai to find a woman who he could click with, and have an understanding with (I mean, maybe Yaone? That could happen) the same way he has with the other members of the Ikkou. They have gone through so much, through hell and back. They are family. I just can’t imagine Hakkai and Gojyo not living together.\n\nNone of them are going to go about their separate lives after. I mean, maybe Goku might with Nataku (if they live), but I think they will always end up together. Not romantically, but you know?\n\nAfter all, all of them managed to find each other after death. That type of bond will never disappear. They are fated forever.\n\nI can tell you one thing I don’t want, I don’t want any of them to die, and have the others live on without them.\n\nI agree with a lot of the above! Also worth noting: in Japan, it’s next to impossible for a series to have same-sex relationships front and center and be classified as anything BUT BL. For example, Saiyuki is an action-adventure series at its core (or as OP said, jousei). But if any members of the ikkou actually got together, it would no longer be considered an action-adventure series. It would be classified as BL. Nevermind that those two genres are not mutually exclusive. You can have adventure series with gay protagonists and it’s still an adventure series, right? Not so much in anime and manga. That’s why Saiyuki and even Wild Adapter have so much gay subtext and appeal purposefully to BL fans with no actual payoff. It’s about the marketing. Same-sex relationships are either used subtly as a selling point (Free! is a good example of this), or it’s the only thing a series is about. There isn’t a big gray area in the middle.\n\n(This is especially frustrating in Wild Adapter where it’s really obvious and there’s even at least one same-sex kiss. I’d bet money that the two MCs are never going to end up in an actual romantic relationship that is defined as such, even if they keep letting their hands linger on one another and keep sharing long, meaningful looks. I could write a book about how those two are actually boyfriends. And yet… )\n\nFor another example of this, see Yuri on Ice and how carefully they presented Yuri and Victor’s relationship. It’s so obvious that they’re a couple by the end of the series, and yet the studio edited or toned down the blatant parts juuuust enough that it could still be classified as a sports anime rather than BL. It’s stupid, because anyone with eyes knows there was a kiss and that those are engagement rings. But there’s just enough plausible deniability that people who really have their heads stuck that far down in the sand (AKA the old guys who run the industry) can say “oh it’s platonic, wink wink.” Hopefully the success of Yuri on Ice and the widespread acceptance of its central queer relationship is signalling a change that will actually last in the industry. Time will tell on that front.\n\nSame thing with Hakkai and Gojyo living together at the end of Saiyuki. It could be construed as romantic (and very purposefully presented as such), but it will never be made explicit. Not unless Minekura and Zero-Sum decide to give Japanese norms the finger and put it in there when the series is over, since it’s ending anyway and what are they gonna do about it? Now whether or not Minekura makes her own doujinshi with the guys post-series… that’s something I wouldn’t be surprised by. Also something I would throw my money at ASAP. (Sorry if this comes off as a sort of bitter rant. I’ve been into anime and manga for a really long time and currently live in Japan where this is something I kind of see and deal with on a regular basis. I’ve gotten a little jaded over the years.)"
