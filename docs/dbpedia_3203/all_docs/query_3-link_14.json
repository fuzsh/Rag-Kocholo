All exist side-by-side on a peaceful continent known as \"Shangri-La.\" The balance there was shattered when the Minus Wave caused by Gyumaoh's resurrection experiments made the yokai rampage out of control. Ordered by the Merciful Goddess Kanzeon Bosatsu to stop the resuscitation experiment, Genjo Sanzo along with Son Goku, Sha Gojyo, and Cho Hakkai, headed to the west. On the way, Sanzo and his party met Hazel-Grouse, and his servant Gat, who wielded resuscitation techniques that can bring dead humans back to life.
