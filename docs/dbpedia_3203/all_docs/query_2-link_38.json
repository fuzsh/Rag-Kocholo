        "text": "Plot\n\nFlame of Recca follows the story of a teenage boy named Recca Hanabishi, who is interested in ninja and claims to be one himself. He often gets into fights because he made it publicly known that the person who manages to defeat him will earn his services as a loyal ninja. Despite this, he eventually pledges his loyalty and services as a ninja to Yanagi Sakoshita, a girl with the innate ability to heal any wound/injury, because of her kindness and compassion. Recca soon discovers that he possesses the innate ability to control/manipulate flames, and eventually learns that he is actually the son of the sixth generation leader of the Hokage, a ninja clan that was wiped out in 1576, roughly 400 years before the series' present day.[3][4]\n\nThe Hokage ninjas wielded mystical objects called madÅgu (é­å°å ·), which are referred to as \"psychic devices\" or \"mystical weapons\" in the English versions of the series. MadÅgu grant their users special abilities, such as allowing their users to manipulate certain elements (as in the case of the FÅ«jin, which allows its wielder to manipulate the element of wind) and enhancing their user's strength/skills (as in the case of the Dosei no Wa, which increases its user's physical strength and the Idaten, which increases its user's running speed). Oda Nobunaga had invaded the Hokage in 1576 for the purpose of acquiring these weapons, and the series' main antagonist, KÅran Mori, is searching for a madÅgu that will grant him eternal life. Recca and his friends become entangled in Mori's quest for eternal life as he attempts to kidnap Yanagi, believing that her healing powers will help him achieve immortality. This leads them to join the Ura ButÅ Satsujin, a tournament wherein the warriors that wield madÅgu gather to battle each other. After winning the tournament, Recca and his teammates discover that Mori was on his way to acquire the TendÅ Jigoku (å¤©å å°ç, Heaven and Hell), a madÅgu said to grant its user eternal life, and once again attempt to stop him.\n\nThough it begins by following the same basic storyline, the Flame of Recca anime series ends right after the Ura ButÅ Satsujin ends, while the manga goes on to include the subplot involving the TendÅ Jigoku. The anime also omits certain characters from the story,[5] and several of the characters' physical appearances are slightly different from the manga.[6]\n\nMedia\n\nManga\n\nFlame of Recca, written and illustrated by Nobuyuki Anzai, was serialized in Shogakukan's shÅnen manga magazine Weekly ShÅnen Sunday from April 5, 1995 to February 13, 2002,[7][8][9] with a total of 329 chapters. The series was compiled into 33 tankÅbon volumes published by Shogakukan from September 18, 1995 to April 18, 2002.[10][11] Shogakukan also released the manga in 17 wideban volumes from January 18, 2006 to March 16, 2007,[12][13] and a bunkoban edition from July 15, 2010 to October 15, 2011.[14][15]\n\nThe manga was licensed for North American distribution in English by Viz Media and United Kingdom distribution in English by Gollancz Manga. Viz released all 33 volumes from July 30, 2003 to November 10, 2009,[16][17] while Gollancz released ten volumes between March 6 and November 28, 2006.[18][19]\n\nAnime\n\nFlame of Recca was adapted into a 42-episode anime series produced by Studio Pierrot, and aired in Japan from July 19, 1997 to July 10, 1998 on Fuji Television.[20] Flame of Recca was also aired on the satellite network Animax in Japan and Asia.[21][22] Pony Canyon has released the entire series on DVD and laserdisc, while Geneon released it in two DVD boxsets on April 22 and June 24, 2005 in Japan.[23] In North America, Viz Media released the series in ten separate DVD volumes between October 26, 2004 and January 9, 2007.[24][25][26] Discotek Media re-licensed the series in 2014 and released it on DVD in February 2015.[27][28]\n\nThere are several notable differences between the anime and manga, such as the character designs (e.g. FÅ«ko has purple-violet hair in the anime, but has brown hair in the manga) and in the storyline itself (e.g. In the anime, Yanagi's healing powers are first revealed when she heals Recca after he gets injured while protecting her and a child from being crushed under metal pipes,[29] but in the manga, Yanagi heals Recca when he gets injured while protecting her from a group of male students who were forcing her to go with them).[30] The anime was aired in the Philippines by GMA Network in 1999.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe Flame of Recca anime series featured background music composed by Yusuke Honma. The series featured \"Nanka Shiawase\" (ãªããå¹¸ã, lit. \"Something Happy\") by The OYSTARS as its opening theme, and used \"Love is Changing\" (è¥¿ç°ã²ãã) by Hikaru Nishida and \"Zutto Kimi no Soba de\" (ãã£ã¨åã®åã§, lit. \"By Your Side Forever\") by Yuki Masuda as its ending themes for episodes 1-32 and episodes 33-42 respectively. All the songs were released in singles, and all except \"Zutto Kimi no Soba de\" were included in the original soundtracks.[23] Flame of Recca Original Soundtrack Vol. 1 was released by Pony Canyon on December 6, 1997, and features background music used in the series, as well as the series' opening song and first closing song.[31] Flame of Recca Original Soundtrack Vol. 2 was released by Pony Canyon on May 4, 1998. It includes more background music used in the series along with a special CD drama entitled Recca no HonÅ SPECIAL CD DRAMA: DaitÅron Kai Tsuyoi No Wa Dareda?! (ï½¢çç«ã®çï½£ ã¹ãã·ã£ã«CDãã©ã: ç«å½±å¤§è¨è«ä¼ å¼·ãã®ã¯èª°ã ?!, lit. \"Flame of Recca Special CD Drama: The Great Debate, 'Who is the Strongest?!'\").[32]\n\nVideo games\n\nFlame of Recca has been adapted into two games to date.\n\nFlame of Recca: The Game (çç«ã®ç -THE GAME-, Rekka no HonÅ: The Game) is a fighting game released by Konami on December 20, 2001 for the Game Boy Advance.[33] In this game, the player selects a character and presses certain button in order to make them move, attack, dodge, and perform special moves.

Flame of Recca: Final Burning features 24 playable characters.\n\nThe series' protagonist has also appeareded in the 2009 Konami fighting game Sunday vs Magazine: ShÅ«ketsu!
