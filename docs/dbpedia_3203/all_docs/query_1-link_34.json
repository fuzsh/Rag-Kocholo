        "text": "I know I missed February…so ya…this is for March, though\n\nThis one is for an anime series NOT THE MANGA. Which I have read, just FYI\n\nTitle: Saiyuki (in English)\n\nTeaser:\n\n(c) Kazuya Minekura, Enix\n\nWatched: on the animenewsnetwork youtube\n\nOverall: 4 stars\n\nDefinitely one of the best anime series I have ever watched. Was it perfect? No, but overall it was top-of-the-line. Animation was cheap at times and there was definitely filler but I still really, really liked it. Although, I will say, this anime is not for everyone. It is dark and has…weird things. Not for the faint of heart, although this warning goes for the manga a lot more\n\nFor Fans: (of Shonen) 4 stars\n\nSee above comment, really\n\nFor Casual Watchers: 3 stars\n\nIf you don’t like anime, don’t watch. If you are afraid of dark themes, seriously messed up characters or weird/wrong/screwed up character interactions then don’t watch. If you don’t mind, though, I’d definitely recommend it.\n\nFinal Decision: See my comment for casual watchers. Overall, though, I’d say it’s one of my favorite animated series.\n\nAnimation/Art: 4 stars\n\n-Character Design: 4.5 stars\n\nI love the designs. I don’t really have any complaints other than Gojyo’s pink hair. All of the characters are very unique and don’t look like the super-typical anime characters. They all have different heights and height/weight ratios that fit with the look. There’s a reason that everyone’s the size they should be. Gojyo is more built, followed by Sanzo, Hakkai looks like a girl and Goku’s a kid. Which fits. And they’re color-coded by eye color which I love ^.^ (Unlike in my image in which Hakkai has blue eyes which Minekura later changed to green)\n\n-Animation: 3 stars\n\nHaha, I can see where their money didn’t go…but it’s okay. Saiyuki has a particular style, a tendency to put in “non-speaker” shots during dramatic scenes. Things like ceiling fans or someone who’s not talking. It looks cheap at first but it kinda grows on you and it does match the scenes. Manga does it sometimes too.\n\n-Into/Outro: 4 stars\n\nThese are basically artbook images put to music. Which is awesome. They also tend to have intros with a “fighting in silhouettes” scenes, which I like. Usually they just tend to show off the main four characters but it’s cool.\n\nDialogue:\n\n-Voice Acting: 4 stars\n\nI miss the Saiyuki voice actors…definitely better than some of the later ones (Saiyuki: Reload and on). Dr. Nii sounds the best! There are some awkward moments but aren’t there always? Grey Ayers does the best Goku, and so on.\n\n-Script: 3 stars\n\nEheh…voice actors are amazing script, not so much. Swear words are added in and some of the lines are OOC. Example is Sanzo who, in one episode, calls one of the guys “my friend” when one of his “things” is that they’re not his friends, just his traveling companions.\n\n-Music: 4 stars\n\nMusic sets the mood and it sets it well. I love the music. It’s a lot of nice piano pieces and such.\n\nStory: 4\n\nThis depends on what you’re looking for. Plot? Well…it’s there. Vaguely. Character development through the story? Front and center. And amazing. Saiyuki is about the characters with this vague movement towards the end goal. And it works. So, it depends. I really like something so development-driven. I don’t care that it’s taking years to get to India, that’s not the point.\n\nMisc notes:\n\nHonestly, I do like the manga better. It’s darker and doesn’t skirt around some of the motifs. The manga is more morbid and dark but both are still good. As a sidenote, Hakkai uses his martial arts a lot more in the manga than in the anime. This saddens me, I like his martial arts.\n\nFavorite:\n\nCharacter: Hakkai. Definitely. In my opinion he’s clinically insane, see my character study on facebook if you’re interested, but I still love his character. He needs to be needed; clingy but refuses to cling; polite but still snarky. Plus, he’s nearly half-blind. Yay! I also really like Gojyo (when he’s not screwing around)\n\nEpisode: Not really sure. Most of my favorite parts are in Reload, the sequel or in Burial (one of the OVAs).\n\nCrossposted on Facebook, GaiaOnline, LiveJournal, Deviantart, ComicVine"
