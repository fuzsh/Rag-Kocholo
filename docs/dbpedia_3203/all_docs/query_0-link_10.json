        "text": "Just this once, we work together! Mortal enemies working together for the common good!\n\n—Dib on teaming up with Zim, Invader Zim, \"Bolognius Maximus\"\n\nA shorter form of the phrase: The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Another phrase used to describe this is \"War makes for strange bedfellows.\" This results in a scenario where foes must work together to achieve a common goal.\n\nThis type of team-up usually starts with the villain coming to the hero's aid, usually saying that a certain threat is a danger to them both, or \"No one kills you but me!\" when they save the hero from certain doom. After the team-up, the villain will usually let the hero live for now because they were so useful, so everything can return to status quo.\n\nFrequently, if it is a goodie-baddie partnership, the baddie will look for opportunities to pull something that gets them a profit (or, in the case of really bad baddies, allows them to stab the goodie in the back).\n\nOf course, the Status Quo Is God is usually maintained by the end, with the villain having returned to his evil ways after pitching in to defeat the external threat. Ungrateful Bastard. Except when it isn't, and there's creep towards Friendly Enemy status. Can become a Heel Face Revolving Door if it happens more than once.\n\nSometimes the baddie is more the hero's Worthy Opponent than a villain, and it's a pity to see them go back to their old rivalry in the end because together, they're a nearly unstoppable fighting force. (If they don't go back, it's Fire-Forged Friends.)\n\nA good source of Foe Yay, whether due to the fact that the villain secretly does harbor feelings for the protagonist (a direct example) or simply realizes how boring and/or aimless his life would be without the protagonist. Compare Embarrassing Rescue, Gondor Calls for Aid. See also Enemy Civil War.\n\nSee also An Offer You Can't Refuse, Genghis Gambit, and Colliding Criminal Conspiracies. When there's no common enemy per se, it's Go-Karting with Bowser. If the villain saves the day without the hero's help, then Bad Guys Do the Dirty Work. If the villain in question is possessing the hero, but there's a greater threat the two must conquer together, this can result in a Symbiotic Possession. Contrast with We ARE Struggling Together!, where you have putative allies who end up backstabbing and/or infighting with each other.\n\nAs might be gathered by this point, this article is unrelated to passive defensive weapons planted by one's foes. Also not related to mines of the underground type; for that, see Underground Level or Minecart Madness.\n\nFinally, this is an opportunity to show the villains as being more competent than they typically are. While they're defeated by the heroes week after week, the bad guys can actually contribute to the defeat of whatever threat they're teaming up with the heroes against.\n\nWARNING! There are unmarked Spoilers ahead. Beware.\n\nNot to be confused with the Dennis Quaid movie/Barry Longyear story Enemy Mine. We also sincerely hope that you did not have a slip of the finger and ended up here instead of at Enemy Mime. For an enemy that is a mine, see Action Bomb, and for a different kind of mine which is filled with enemies, see Dug Too Deep.\n\nCompare Nominal Hero, a character who fights for good even though their intentions are not heroic at all.\n\nExamples of Enemy Mine include:\n\nAnime and Manga\n\nSubverted in UFO Robo Grendizer. In one of the manga versions, Great Mazinger Big Bad, Emperor of Darkness, offered Kouji Kabuto an alliance to fight the Vegans. It was subverted because Kouji refused the offer and Big Bad King Vega killed the Emperor to impede that alliance and get ridden of a possible enemy and competitor.\n\nIn the anime version of Valkyria Chronicles, Episode 12 has Welkin and Faldio team up with Jaeger and Selvaria to foil a plot to to kidnap Princess Cordelia (and Alicia, who was captured in the process) and use her to BS an impromptu alliance between the Federation and Gallia, which is really a cheap way for Prime Minster Borg to usurp the throne \"legally\" and force the Imperial forces into a two front war situation, which at best leaves him in control of Gallia with Federation backing and gives the Imperial forces pause, or at worst ensures the Imperials are forced to fight a much bigger enemy on two fronts, with either outcome leaving him at an advantage. Everyone launches obvious objections to Welkin's proposed Enemy Mine until Welkin points out the massive mutual gain they stand to profit from, leading to a brief Imperial-Gallia alliance to foil the plot.\n\nIn the first two Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha seasons, Nanoha's determination finally pays off, and her rivals turn on their creator and help her and the Time-Space Admin crew.\n\nIt's a mixed bag in StrikerS. On the one hand, most of the Numbers were headed in the right direction as of the epilogue and eventually joined either the Saint Church or the TSAB afterward, Lutecia has her mom back, and Agito had performed a full-fledged Heel Face Turn and joined up with Signum to defend the city from Jail's drones. On the other hand, Jail and his most loyal cyborgs are cooling their heels in prison instead of making friends with the Aces.\n\nIn Pokémon, the heroes are forced to work with Team Rocket every once in a while, most often in the movies where the whole world is in danger. It happens the point the trio performs a Lampshade Hanging on it in Movie 8:\n\nThis is the whole plot of the episode \"Pikachu Re-Volts\". After Jessie and James's Pokemon are controlled and taken by their fellow Team Rocket members, Cassidy and Butch, Ash and company team up with them to get the Pokemon back.\n\nThe most bizarre version of this has to be the Season 7 episode \"The Bicker the Better\", where after much squabbling between males and females, Jessie recruits a (slightly reluctant) May into a tag team battle...versus James, who also formed an alliance with Ash, in what Brock calls \"the battle of the sexes\".\n\nAnd in a first season episode, Ash and the gang even help Team Rocket try to kidnap the Monster of the Week: a Snorlax, which they thought was the one causing the drought in a nearby town.\n\nA more traditional example is in the Tag Battle Tournament mini-arc, the finale of the first Diamond and Pearl season. Ash and Paul were randomly picked to compete as a team for a pair of Soothe Bells as the prize. Paul just wanted to get some experience for his team, none of the happiness items for him. The results were not pretty, even though they managed to win.\n\nHappens fairly often in Pokémon Special. Sabrina, Koga, and Lt. Surge of Team Rocket aid the protagonists against the Elite Four in the Yellow chapter, while Lorelei of the Elite Four helps the protagonists when Team Rocket invades her hometown.\n\nNear the end of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Adventure, Cyrus and his three top officers team up with the heroes to stop Charon from taking over Sinnoh. When he was last in power, Cyrus had attempted to destroy the universe.\n\nIn Yu-Gi-Oh, Yugi and Kaiba are frequently forced to team up against a bigger threat, and it almost always ends with Kaiba walking away muttering about how he is destined to beat Yugi someday.\n\nAlso, Malik and Bakura's alliance, specifically in the duel against Yami no Malik.\n\nSimilarly during the formation of the same team in Yu-Gi-Oh the Abridged Series, Marik proclaims, \"And the enemy of my friend is also my enemy!\" Bakura informs him that's not how it goes.\n\nGundam 00 has the alliance between the Big Three (Union, HRL, AEU) which was formed to defeat the rogue paramilitary organization Celestial Being.\n\nIn Episode 17, all five sides (Celestial Being, Katharon, the coup d'etat forces, the regular Earth Federation military, and A-Laws) temporarily dispose of their hatreds in a Crowning Moment of Awesome for all sides that involves stopping a potential Ice Age and the slaughter of tens of millions of lives by shooting down the countless falling pieces of the destroyed Africa Orbital Elevator.\n\nLater in season 2, the Federation army reluctantly allies itself with bitter enemies Celestial Being and Katharon against the A-Laws and the Innovators.\n\nIn Death Note, Near and Mello are bona fide enemies, despite being Worthy Opponents. When Kira manages to be a bigger fish to fry than they had expected, they do end up de facto needing to work together, using the only female on their of their teams as a liaison, and pretending viciously that they want nothing to do with each other.\n\nNear's pretty clear that he'd have no problem working with Mello, to the point that it could be argued he does want to. Mello's the one who wants nothing to do with Near (besides win against him) and tries to verbally pretend he's not helping. \"Near, I have no intention of working with you. However, it wouldn't be right to just take my picture and leave. So, I'll settle my debt.\" Afterward, he still maintains contact with Lidner but pointedly doesn't dwell on the fact that he knows that Near knows about the contact.\n\nAlso, at one point the investigation team is forced to temporarily ally with Kira himself, as one of the Death Notes ends up in the hands of the Mafia, something that both sides consider the worst possible scenario.\n\nAlso in the first arc when the Second Kira first appears L agrees to let Light work with the taskforce to use one Kira to lure out the other in order to get evidence on both of them. Light finds this fortuitous because then he can keep tabs on both L and the Second Kira.\n\nCode Geass has Lelouch and Suzaku teaming up to get rid of the Kyushu invaders.\n\nThen a season later they team up again to conquer the world, make themselves out to be two of the most hated people in history, dress Suzaku up as Zero after faking his death, then assassinate Lelouch in a highly public manner in order to bring about world peace. It worked.\n\nHappened at least thrice in the first season of Corrector Yui, where Yui and War Wolf had to teamwork to save either themselves or others. Also happened in the second season of the anime, with Yui and Dark Magical Girl Corrector Ai.\n\nInspector Zenigata is more than willing to team up with Lupin III whenever it involves taking down a more clearly evil criminal (which is surprisingly often). This is implied to be main reason why he hasn't been fired yet.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Z, Goku and Vegeta's alliance initially starts when they both team up to fight Frieza, the former to save the Universe, the latter because he wants to avenge his pride by defeating Frieza because he was used by him constantly. He ends up redeeming himself and forming a family with Bulma, though he maintains his rivalry against Goku.\n\nAnd before that, Piccolo joined Goku, and later the rest of the cast to fight against the Saiyans. For viewers who joined the show at the start of the Z series, their past history with one another could easily be missed or forgotten.\n\nFor a while, Dragon Ball had a pattern where the main antagonist of the previous arc would team up with Goku against the villain of the current one, earning good guy status in the process. This started with Yamcha (who tries to rob Goku in his first appearance) and continues all the way to Freeza, when Toriyama finally gave us a villain too evil to ever join Goku. Here is a list of some of the former villains who joined Goku, mostly through Enemy Mine Heel Face Turns: Oolong, Yamcha, Puar, Tien, Chao-tzu, Piccolo, Vegeta, Android #16, Android #17 (though he never actually met Goku before leaving off-screen shortly after his turn), Android #18, Dabra (according to anime filler in Other World), Majin Buu, Nuova Shenron (in GT), and Abo and Kado (in the recent special which introduced Table to the world.\n\nActually, he made all his friends by fighting them first, except for Roshi, Krillin and Lunch.\n\nAnd Krillin was his training rival for a while.\n\nNear the beginning of the Android Saga, Krillin mentions this pattern when Bulma asks the guys why they don't just find Dr. Gero and stop him from ever creating the Androids. So long as they have a common enemy, Vegeta is less likely to revert to being a full-blown villain.\n\nEvery time Gun for Hire Katana joins the rest of the Techode pilots in Gad Guard to stop a rogue Gad from destroying everything it touches. Interesting in that half the team (both girls, who met him under different circumstances) don't consider him an enemy. His adorable Morality Pet helps.\n\nOne Piece\n\nThe Impel Down arc was one big Enemy Mine. Luffy has infiltrated the Impel Down prison in order to free his older brother who's being held on the lowest level. During the infiltration he ended up \"teaming up\" with two former enemies (Buggy the Clown and Mr. 3) who are constantly trying to go up and out, only seeing Luffy as a means to distract the guards. But, through various mishaps they end up falling down to the lower levels anyway and find themselves forced to co-operate in order to stay alive.\n\nYou can also add Mr. 2 Bon Clay to the list of former enemies Luffy has teamed up with in Impel Down (though its debatable whether Bon Clay still counts as a bad guy).\n\nDebatable? I think that debate was settled when Bon Clay sacrificed himself to help Luffy escape, for the second time.\n\nIn Level Six of the prison: Luffy teamed up with Crocodile. Let me say that again: Luffy teamed up with Crocodile.\n\nThis is another one-sided Enemy Mine situation. Crocodile's willing to work with Luffy, but he's evil enough that Luffy is highly reluctant to take him along. Mr. 1 also joins them, but Luffy never met him before, and doesn't know who he is.\n\nTaken Up to Eleven in the Whitebeard War arc. Crocodile protecting Luffy, fighting alongside the Whitebeard pirates, and generally being the closest thing to altruistic he's ever been thus far. Buggy fights on Luffy's behalf (even if Luffy forced him into it). This war is absolutely crazy in the temporary partnerships it has formed.\n\nEarlier on, Luffy's crew, the Galley-La company, and the Franky Family, despite having fought in a three-way battle before, team up when they realize that they're facing the same enemy, albeit for different reasons (rescuing Robin, dealing with Iceberg's assassins and preventing Pluton's revival, and saving Franky, respectively). Then again, the Galley-La crew had been fighting the Straw Hats under the mistaken belief that they were responsible for the attempt on Iceberg's life, which they just realized.\n\nWhile not as plot relevant as Impel Down, the movie One Piece: Stampede had the Straw Hats and many of their allies form a large team with several of their old foes (including Mihawk, Crocodile, Foxy, Wapol, Buggy, and Smoker) to oppose the common enemy. Justified, as the story takes place at the Pirates' Festival where everyone who is anyone in piracy was there.\n\nDuring the Egghead Arc, CP0 sides with the Straw Hats once they realize the Celestial Dragons are a common enemy intending to do them both in.\n\nIn Ranma ½, several Enemy Mine alliances emerge among the various members of the Love Dodecahedron. Shampoo, Ukyō and Kodachi regularly team up against any external threat to Ranma (or a new potential suitor). Ranma himself teams with Ryōga and Mousse against Prince Herb. Ranma and Ryōga do this often enough that they inch into Friendly Enemy territory by the end of the series.\n\nAnd inverted with Ryōga and Mousse in the anime: although they aren't enemies when they initially team up against their common enemy Ranma, by the end of the episode, they work so poorly together that they can't stand each other. The fact that Mousse is far more ruthless than Ryōga, and also has no qualms whatsoever about hurting others to get rid of Ranma—even Akane Tendō, Ryōga's oblivious crush—does not help matters.\n\nIn the Three-Tails filler arc of Naruto, Naruto ends up working with Guren to escape the inside of the Three-tailed beast. The fact that they both have an interest in Yukimaru's welfare and neither wants to see the Akatsuki get the beast helps, too.\n\nThis is also the reason for the very existence of the shinobi alliance, rival nations working together to stop Madara Uchiha from executing his moon's eye plan.\n\nEven Kyuubi joins in. He even spells it out loud and clearly.\n\nIn one of the Haruhi Suzumiya short stories, the SOS Brigade has to team up with their perceived rival club the Computer Society, in order to stop the plans of the nefarious Student Council President from evicting the Brigade from their clubroom.\n\nOccurs twice in Kenichi the Mightiest Disciple, in Kenichi's last battles against Hermit (a.k.a. Natsu Tanimoto) and Boris Ivankov. Both times, a problem occurred to interrupt the battle, and Kenichi would team up with the person he had been fighting moments ago to resolve it, mostly because one party (Hermit in the first, Kenichi himself in the second) didn't want their opponent to get injured and thus be unable to finish the battle. Naturally, the instant the problem is resolved, both cases have Kenichi and his enemy resume the battle, but Hermit at least would later become a full-time ally (Boris may do so as well in the future, but for now, he's been Put on a Bus).\n\nThe current ongoing arc has Akira Hongo, YAMI's \"God Fist,\" joining forces with Ryozanpaku to get revenge on YAMI's \"Demon Fist\" Silcardo Jenazad for tricking him into almost killing Kenichi during his fight with Sakaki (which Silcardo did for the purpose of kidnapping Miu to brainwash her into a Face Heel Turn).\n\nSara and the Space Squadron make amends with Mariette and her Gambee pilot brigade (sorry, but it doesn't have a name and both common fan nicknames exceed this wiki's age rating) to defend the Libertad in the end of Soukou no Strain.\n\nIn the finale of Night Wizard, after spending the entire show chasing the heroes, Bell Zephyr ends up fighting alongside them to defeat the true Big Bad.\n\nPixie Misa does this twice in Mahou Shoujo Pretty Sammy. In the same episode. Misa and Sammy also team up briefly in the second and third OVAs.\n\nAll the non-Shinryuuji Naga players on Team Japan and Agon in Eyeshield 21. And to a lesser degree, all the non-Hakushuu Dinosaurs players and Gaoh (especially Kid, Hiruma and Banba).\n\nAt one point in Eureka Seven, Renton and Dominic are forced to work together to save Eureka and Anemone.\n\nTwo examples from Soul Eater:\n\nIn order to further her plans, Medusa joins forces with Shibusen and leads a team to infiltrate Baba Yaga castle, the Arachnaphobia base.\n\nWerewolf Free and shinigami Death the Kid fight Mosquito together. Neither are happy about the idea.\n\nDuring a match in the individual tournament in Saki, everyone in the table gangs up on Saki, despite one of them being her own team mate. It doesn't work.\n\nIn Fullmetal Alchemist, Envy works briefly with Ed and Ling when they have to get out from Gluttony's stomach.\n\nThen he goes One-Winged Angel and tries to kill them...\n\nEd joins forces with Greed-- albeit under the condition of \"working for\" him-- after Greed splits off from the Homunculi.\n\nIn Spriggan, Spetsnaz officer Victor Shutrov (or Stolov, based on the Singaporean English translation) tries to kill Japanese KGB agent Koichi Moroha when he learns of his plan to dominate the world via the Fire Shrine and not on behalf of the USSR, helping Yu somewhat. He's killed later, not being able to stop the renegade agent. Yu and Jean team with two of their enemies near the end of the manga. They consist of Iwao Akatsuki, ex-Trident Corporation commando, and Bo Brantz, ex-Neo Nazi and ninja, to defeat Larry Markson from using the natural energy of Gaia in the South Pole.\n\nIn Berserk, Guts and Zodd have an AWESOME one of these when they temporarily team up against the Emperor Ganshika, who is a giant fog/storm cloud Apostle. Naturally, they do it in the most badass way they can. Schierke finds Ganshika's \"core\", the only really physical spot in his apostle form, but says that only a powerful magical weapon can do anything. Guts has been slaughtering demons, apostles, and other nasty spirits every single day and night, for about three years straight, with his BFS and so all that pain and hate has made it a magical weapon. Zodd, in demon form, lets Guts ride on top of him, and they use the Dragonslayer to ram Ganshika's 'core'.\n\nEven though catching the Kaitou Kid is one of Detective Conan's chief aims, second only to busting up the Black Organization, Conan often ends up working together with Kid to catch bad guys or otherwise avert disaster, especially in his Non Serial Movie appearances. (For that matter, he has occasionally worked together with Black Organization agents against other Black Organization agents, as well.) His TV-special team-up with Lupin III would probably count as well.\n\nKougaiji's team and the Sanzo party do this or help each other out in some way so often in Saiyuki that Kougaiji's \"it would be unfair to attack you now but next time we will get the scripture\" is met with \"yeah, yeah we know\"\n\nIn the final 3 chapters of Psyren, Yoshina Ageha teams up with Amagi Miroku against Mithra.\n\nAnytime Inuyasha and Sesshomaru team up, this happens, though at the end of each scenario Sesshy walks off just a little more of an Anti-Hero than before.\n\nComic Books\n\nX-Men: Magneto, always referred to as the Big Bad, is the first person the heroes team up with when someone worse comes along.\n\nParticularly in the 90s cartoon, most notably in a season-long storyline in which he and Professor Xavier are stranded together in the Savage Land.\n\nThe brilliant X-Men graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills was the basis for X2, and thus follows the same plot except that, since the comics have been going on long enough that they didn't feel the need to hammer home his villainy, Magneto doesn't really have a Snap Back the way he does in the movie.\n\nAnd in God Loves, Man Kills II, released to tie in with X2, the X-Men find themselves teaming up with the villain from the original.\n\nMagneto has worked with the X-Men in multiple story lines, even becoming the leader in one story arc. This is because, for most writers, Magneto isn't as much a bad guy as he is a Well-Intentioned Extremist.\n\nIt wasn't just for one arc. In the late 1980s, due to Charles Xavier being absent, a reformed Magneto took over Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters for something like four years (in real world time). If you were reading X-Men and New Mutants back then, Magneto as the head of the Xavier school felt like a new status quo.\n\nSpider-Man's enemies Venom and Carnage hate each other more than they hate him. Any time Carnage pops up, Venom will call a truce with Spider-Man to go wail on Carnage. This most famously occurred in the storyline Maximum Carnage, which was adapted into a Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo game.\n\nIn the oddly-named \"Venom vs Carnage\" comic, after Carnage produces a new symbiote, he and Venom decide that, in the end, they hate the new symbiote even more than they hate each other (it's implied in Carnage's case that this is part of symbiote biology). The result? Their only teamup. Venom calls it \"Temporary. VERY temporary.\"\n\nSpidey and Doc Ock ended up working together at one point, in order to deal with a new villain (Carlyle) who used Ock's arm technology to build a bank-robbing powersuit. While simply being robbed wouldn't have been enough to put Ock on the side of his mortal enemy, there was also the fact that Carlyle was threatening Ock's former fiancée, known to Spider-Man fans as \"Aunt May\".\n\nActually, Aunt May being endangered wasn't really a factor in the fight. It didn't do anything except surprise Doc Ock for a moment and lead to a very funny The Rocky Horror Picture Show joke. Spidey came into the fight late as Doc Ock was already going after Caryle for stealing his tech and trying to kill him.\n\nTo Doc's credit, he DID stop a building from collapsing just long enough to allow the innocent civilians to escape at Spidey's prompting. That did nothing to STOP him from letting the building collapse on Spidey, noting \"you are not a civilian\".\n\nDoc Ock also wasn't happy about the inadvertent team-up, later noting (as he told Spidey the weakness in Caryle's armor), \"I am not helping you -- I am hurting him.\" World of difference.\n\nIt wasn't even the first time Spidey and Ock teamed up, since they also set aside their differences when Hammerhead kidnapped Aunt May. Spider-Man wanted to rescue Aunt May because she was one of his loved ones (along with the fact that he was Spider-Man after all), while Doc Ock wanted to marry May so he could gain access to a nuclear power plant she had inherited.\n\nIn Marvel's Secret Invasion mega-event, the villain mastermind The Hood sends his forces into battle to save the Earth from the Skrulls.\n\nHe has his own reasons for this: it helps Norman Osborn in his ploy to take over SHIELD and instigate the Dark Reign.\n\nActually, it's implied that The Hood had no idea of Osborn's plan, until he called together the Cabal for the first time. The Hood would have let the assembled forces fight the Skrulls, if not for the simple fact that if the Skrulls destroy the Earth, they destroy his business.\n\nIn one of the most memorable stories of Inferno that didn't involve the mutant teams in the main storyline, Spidey fought alongside J. Jonah Jameson to defend The Daily Bugle building against the invading demon horde. It was little wonder that the writers named the story \"When the Bugle Blows!\"\n\nIn the one shot comic Spider-Man Dead Man's Hand, Spidey and his old enemy the Tinkerer cooperated for mutual benefit after the third Carrion infected New Yorkers with a disease that made them zombie-like minions. The Tinker was working on a teleportation device for the Enclave that Spidey needed to get to Wungadore quickly, as he knew the High Evolutionary might have inside information on the plague, and the Tinkerer was willing to help, seeing as his son was one of the victims of said plague\n\nSpider-Woman called a truce with several former enemies - including Gypsy Moth, Flying Tiger, and Daddy Longlegs - to escape the clutches of the Locksmith in the 50th issue of her series, and even invited a few of them to her apartment later! Unfortunately, said party was interrupted by the darker threat of the story.\n\nCassie and Chucky in Hack Slash Vs. Chucky.\n\nThis was the driving force behind Watchmen's ending in both the original comic and film adaptation.\n\nThough the enemy in each was completely different.\n\nIn the comic book series Elf Quest, when two elf tribes—the Wolfriders and the newly-introduced Go-Backs—join forces to wage war against the trolls of King Guttlekraw, the elves form a grudging alliance with the trolls formerly led by the late King Greymung, who have been enslaved by Guttlekraw, even though Greymung's trolls have been the hated enemies of the Wolfriders ever since betraying them back at the start of the storyline. The Go-Backs, meanwhile, would never have thought of teaming up with trolls of any kind, period... But it's probably only because of this uneasy alliance that Guttlekraw's trolls are defeated.\n\nIn the 1970s, two issues of The Brave and the Bold featured Batman teaming up with The Joker to solve a crime. In #111, they worked together to solve the mass murder of an upstanding local family, which someone had sloppily tried to pin on the Joker. In the end, it turned out that the whole thing was an elaborate plot between the Joker and the killer to lure Batman into a Death Trap. In #191, the Penguin is murdered and it looks like the Joker did it. When Batman catches up to him, he proves that he couldn't have done it. It is eventually revealed that the whole thing was a Faking the Dead by the Penguin, who used it to kidnap a local cardinal.\n\nIn the Marvel |Transformers comic, Ratchet and Megatron teamed in an early episode to bring down Shockwave. Megatron, naturally enough, tried to betray Ratchet, but Ratchet was prepared.\n\nSeveral years later, during the \"Space Pirates!\" story in the UK comic, the Autobots and Decepticons join forces to repel the Quintessons, who are trying to conquer Cybertron before Quintessa explodes. Ultra Magnus and Soundwave even get a Back-to-Back Badasses moment. At the end, Soundwave briefly considers the idea of a lasting peace, but realizes the two factions have come too far to ever resolve their differences.\n\nThe Autobots and Decepticons were forced to team up again against the Cybertronian Empire, a faction of hyperevolved Decepticons who had abandoned Cybertron eons ago to create a star-spanning empire of their own. They consider the Autobots and the original Decepticons to be disgusting savages, and eventually returned to destroy their \"lesser\" brethren.\n\nAt the end of Final Crisis, Superman is facing the Female Furies and the Justifiers. Who saves him and reverses the Anti-Life Equation? Lex Luthor and Dr. Sivana.\n\nPaperinik New Adventures (Donald Duck's superhero alter ego) is forced to work together with a notorious time pirate known as The Raider early on in order to save a large part of Duckburg from being destroyed. Later on, they actually find themselves in Enemy Mine situations so often that they build up a strange kind of friendship.\n\nIn Cosmic Odyssey, Darkseid and Highfather team up, recruiting Superman, Batman, and various other DC Universe heroes to prevent the Anti-Life Entity from destroying the entire galaxy. To everyone's great surprise, Darkseid betrays his newfound allies, only to be stopped by Batman's Betrayal Insurance.\n\nThis was hardly the first or the last time that Darkseid pulled one of these. In Crisis on Infinite Earths, for example, ended up being instrumental in finally defeating the Anti-Monitor (but making it very clear he was only doing it not to help the heroes or anything, but rather to ensure that the Anti-Monitor wouldn't destroy everything).\n\nCircumstances have forced Thor to team up with members of his Rogues Gallery, including Loki, the Executioner, and the Enchantress. In Loki's case, this is often when a villain - such as Surtur - wants to destroy Asgard; Loki's goal is to rule Asgard, and he knows that won't happen if it is burned to the ground.\n\nIn the Darkwing Duck comic revival, Steelbeak teams up with Darkwing to stop F.O.W.L. High Command's plan to unleash Duckthulu, because Even Evil Has Standards.\n\nAfter the death of the Human Torch, Doctor Doom and Reed Richards have very reluctantly agreed to work together in the Future Foundation. This arrangement was brokered by Reed's genius daughter Valeria who convinced Reed that the FF needed someone as ruthlessly pragmatic as Doom if they were going to save the world. She got Doom on board by promising to help undo the brain damage the Intelligensia inflicted on him in Fall of the Hulks.\n\nSuperman and Lex Luthor are in conflict almost all the time, and loathe each other with a vengeance, but they share a near-fanatical adoration for and protectiveness of their home city of Metropolis. This has caused them to put aside their differences, abandon their other objectives, and team up to take down villains bent on destroying their beloved city more than once.\n\nIn the final issue of Paul Cornell's Knight And Squire, everyone in the British super-community teams up to take down The Joker. The heroes, the anti-heroes, the Harmless Villains and the killers like Death Dinosaur. He's just that much of a threat.\n\nIn Archie Comics Sonic the Hedgehog, the Freedom Fighters team up with their enemies against a common threat so often that Sonic's started lampshading it. At different points throughout the series, they've teamed up with Robotnik/Eggman, Snively, their Suppression Squad counterparts, the Destructix, the Dark Legion, Ixis Naugus, and Dr. Finitevus. They usually end up getting backstabbed in these situations, to the point that Sonic's started lampshading that too.\n\nMore recently, we've had a non-Freedom Fighters examples, as the Anti-Hero Babylon Rogues teamed up with their rivals the Battle Bird Armada to find their ancestral homeland of Babylon Gardens—ironically, this puts them in opposition to the Freedom Fighters, as the entrance to the Gardens is apparently in their home of New Mobotropolis.\n\nHappens on a massive scale in the Farscape comic book arc \"The War for the Uncharted Territories\", when essentially all the factions in the Uncharted Territories have to put aside their rivalries and join forces in order to stand the slightest chance of defending against conquest by the Kkore, which up until then has been defeating everyone in Curb Stomp Battles.\n\nOne story-arc in the Captain America (comics) comic has Cap teaming up with the Red Skull of all people in order to stop a resurrected Hitler from taking control of the Cosmic Cube. Incidentally, this would lead Cap to being briefly exiled from the United States, since the U.S. government assumed he had turned his back on America by aligning with the Skull.\n\nFan Works\n\nThe example from Wild Mass Guessing for The X-Files, suggesting that as soon as the aliens arrive on Earth, they'll promptly be beaten back by every single Monster of the Week, who tend to favor continuing to live on their planet.\n\nIn Aeon Natum Engel, during the Herald fight, the Migou recall some of their forces so that the NEG Military, with the newly freed-up forces, can assist in defeating the Herald. Humanity doesn't return the favor.\n\nOne issue of Ultimate SpiderWoman: Change With the Light has petty criminal Blizzard teaming up with Spider-Woman to help her protect the innocent people in danger during an invasion of New York City by an army of Brainwashed and Crazy super villains. Taking inspiration from the Darkwing Duck episode where DW teamed up with Megavolt (see below), Blizzard points out that if New York is destroyed, there'll be nothing left for him to rob.\n\nA Dark Knight Over Sin City features Batman and the anti-heroes from Sin City teaming up together and with other criminals in order to achieve their goals.\n\nIn Hogyoku Ex Machina, Yoruichi is surprised when she finds out that the Vizards fought alongside Soul Society against Aizen in the original timeline, since they have no reason to like them. Ishida suggests it was because of this trope.\n\nVillain example: Although Brox and Co. and the Raleka in With Strings Attached aren't exactly mortal enemies, they dislike each other considerably. Brox and Co. are contemptuous of Ketafans in general, and the Raleka hate that the skahs want to use the sacred Vasyn for stupid purposes. However, they work together against the four because the Raleka cannot do certain things without Brox's help. We find out later that Brox and Co. were planning to betray the Raleka, but Paul and George inadvertently screwed this up for them.\n\nPonies Make War: In a plan born of desperation to defeat Titan during the Final Battle, the Mane Six end up allying with Discord. As Celestia puts it, they know the latter will probably betray them after they're done with Titan, but they can handle that, and besides, \"better the devil you know\".\n\nQueen of All Oni: When Valmont uses the power of Kaito's mask to steal the Ninja tribe away from Jade, she and Jackie briefly (and reluctantly, in her case) team up to defeat him.\n\nSubverted in one of the scenes set in Jade's mindscape—Hero tries to form an alliance against The Queen with his apparent rival Father, but is rejected.\n\nIn a similar subversion, the J-Team refuses to ally with Karasu against Drago, as they don't see any good coming from working with a Shadowkhan.\n\nPencils Down, Death Rays Up by \"Vaunt\", in which the hostile factions of the Old World of Darkness unite with the normals/sleepers of Earth to fight off the Reapers of Mass Effect.\n\nFilms -- Animation\n\nIn Shrek, the ogre teams up with the dragon he was sent to slay to save the Damsel in Distress from the Knight in Shining Armor, because Humans Are the Real Monsters.\n\nThough slaying the dragon was never part of the bargain; he just had to recover the princess (normally he'd have to slay the dragon, but this time he just outwits her).\n\nAlso, she comes to help because Donkey, who she loves, asks her to.\n\nIn the first Toy Story, Woody and Buzz are initially bitter enemies due to Woody's jealously over Andy's affection, but when the two toys end up separated from the rest of the group, they must work together in order to get back home. They then become good friends for the rest of the trilogy.\n\nThis trope is the whole point of Monsters vs. Aliens, though the monsters are pretty good-natured.\n\nIn the Futurama movie \"Bender's Big Score\", not only is the Robot Devil providing music at Leela's abortive wedding, but they later team up with the robot mafia and evil robotic Santa to take Earth back from the scammer aliens.\n\nFilms -- Live Action\n\nThis is the whole premise behind Independence Day.\n\nThe Sci-Fi movie Enemy Mine (1985) (directed by Wolfgang Petersen), starring Dennis Quaid as a human space marine and Louis Gossett Jr. as an alien soldier. In the midst of an interstellar war between their species, both crash-landed their vessels on a desolate planet and must work together to survive. Years later, after the alien soldier gave birth to a baby alien and died from complications, Dennis Quaid's character raises his adoptive alien son and must protect him and himself from human scavengers who use captured aliens as slaves, until they're both finally found and rescued. It is implied that this event helps to end the war.\n\nHell in the Pacific, about an American and a Japanese soldier trapped on an island together, and which inspired the film in the previous entry, natch.\n\nIn the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, every character views the others as either enemies or incredibly stupid pawns, but will readily concede to work together when their priorities mesh. These unholy alliances tend to confuse casual viewers, who are convinced (très incorrectly) that the adversarial role Barbossa plays in the first film completely contradicts the compatriot role he plays in the third.\n\nBattra and Mothra, mortal enemies of one another, joined forces in order to stop Godzilla in Godzilla and Mothra The Battle For Earth.\n\nMothra convinces her enemy Godzilla and Rodan to stop Ghidorah in Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster\n\nIn Dick Tracy, Tracy considers this trope when deciding whether to accept The Blank's help in defeating Big Boy. Instead, he finally realizes \"The enemy of my enemy is my enemy.\"\n\nIn the first Alien vs. Predator film, the humans end up helping the preds kill xenomorphs by bringing them their ancient weapons.\n\nMentioned in Predators when Royce tells Isabelle that he intends to free the captured Predator and use that momentary trust to have him find the predator's ship and escape. Isabelle then adds:\n\nThe main premise of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\n\nIn a Played for Laughs moment from The Rocketeer, it's gangsters siding with the police vs. Nazis. They may be crooks, but they're American crooks. And, yes, there's a jetpack involved.\n\nThis is what prompts the partnership between Wikus and Christopher in District 9. Christopher has spent 20 years collecting enough fluid to power the aliens' buried shuttle so he can take the mothership and get help, but just as he gets the last of it, his shack is searched by Wikus, who accidentally inhales some of the fluid and starts transforming into an alien. On the run from his own company, Wikus teams up with Christopher to get the fluid back from MNU, on the condition that Christopher change Wikus back into a human. It doesn't really work out that way, but by then Wikus has had enough Character Development to be okay with it.\n\nThe Matrix Revolutions. Neo and the Machines must work together to destroy Smith before he takes over both the Matrix and the Machine World. After Neo allows Smith to possess him, the Machines use their power through Neo's body to destroy all of the Smith clones.\n\nThe entire point of X2: X-Men United: the X-Men team up with Magneto and Mystique to stop a human villain from killing all mutants.\n\nWolverine and Sabretooth in X Men Origins: Wolverine against In Name Only Deadpool.\n\nKind of lampshaded in Ocean's Thirteen, when they decide to include Benedict in their plan:\n\nWill Smith's character in Enemy of the State pulls an on-the-fly Batman Gambit which ties up two troublesome loose ends by getting them to deal with each other. Through some fast talking and well chosen ambiguous language, he sets up a Mexican Standoff between a rogue NSA team that has taken him hostage and a gang of trigger happy goodfellas who are looking for a fight. It does not end well for any of them.\n\nIn Blade II, Blade teams up with the vampires to fight a subspecies of super-vampires that prey on everyone. The vampires end up betraying Blade two-thirds of the way through the movie. Nomak (the lead super-vamp) points out the trope: \"Is the enemy of my enemy my friend? Or just another enemy?\"\n\nThe first half of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a slowly-escalating buildup of hatred between Blondie and Tuco to the point where they're inches from clawing out each others' eyes. Then Tuco learns the location of a graveyard where gold is hidden, Blondie learns the name on the grave where the gold is buried, and they're forced to work together, later uniting against Angel Eyes after he learns Tuco's half of the secret.\n\nBalthazar and Mathayas resort to this in The Scorpion King in order to take down Emperor Memmon.\n\nSubverted by Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Prime and Megatron teaming up to battle a greater threat is fairly common in Transformers media, but this time when Megatron offers a truce, Prime responds by cutting his head off.\n\nIn Once Upon a Texas Train, the retired outlaws and the retired Rangers are forced to combine forces to combat a gang of younger, more ruthless outlaws.\n\nFantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer has the titular team teaming up with Dr. Doom to get the Silver Surfer. Eventually the Fantastic Four team up with the Surfer after Doom betrays them and takes the Surfer's board for himself. And probably after to prevent Galactus from destroying Earth.\n\nIn Assault on Precinct 13, police temporarily join forces with convicts to fight off the titular assault.\n\nLiterature\n\nEnemy Mine by Barry B. Longyear, the basis for the movie mentioned above.\n\nIn William King's Warhammer 40,000 novel Space Wolf, the Marines chose Ragnar and Strybjorn for Marines when they were fighting each other to the death, and both were mortally wounded. Ragnar's desire for Revenge is kept at bay by the knowledge that the Marines will not let him. Finally, when they are fighting Chaos Space Marines, Strybjorn saves Ragnar's life, and shortly thereafter goes down. Ragnar realizes that he neither should nor does want Strybjorn to die; he sends the others on and stays to treat and bring Strybjorn with them.\n\nAnd in the Warchild Series, Captain Azarcon, a Space Marine, and Niko, human sympathizer of the alien resistance work together to rescue hostages and capture gunrunners. This collaboration leads to the end of the war... for a time, anyway.\n\nE. E. \"Doc\" Smith's Skylark Series. In The Skylark of Space, the villain DuQuesne agrees to act as one of the party until they return safely to Earth, even though he wants the hero Richard Seaton dead. Ultimately Seaton makes his best friend hand BOTH his guns over to DuQuesne because DuQuesne is the better shot, and then Seaton and DuQuesne stand side by side and mow down their common enemies until all four guns are empty. In Skylark DuQuesne, DuQuesne enlists Seaton's help in fighting an otherwise unstoppable alien menace and ends up winning the war and saving Seaton's life in the process, though by this time his reasons for wanting Seaton dead no longer apply.\n\nThe fact that each man at least respects the other's abilities helps.\n\nWorldwar, by Harry Turtledove. Aliens invade in 1942. The Axis are working with the Allies. Another one occurs between the Jews in Europe and the Race. Aliens who never figured out discrimination or Nazi Germany. Played with in the sense that they aren't quite sure who'd be worse for mankind. (The Jews play it both ways,working with the Race or the Germans depending on who's a bigger threat at the time.)\n\nIn Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Narcissa Malfoy helps Harry continue faking his death to Lord Voldemort in order to save her family.\n\nThe Thrawn Trilogy: Mara Jade sees her having to constantly work with Luke as this trope, especially with that not-so-covert wish to kill him. He doesn't see it the same way, though. At the end of the trilogy, they've become Fire-Forged Friends, and by the New Jedi Order series, they're a married Battle Couple.\n\nThe Truce At Bakura is this trope personified, with the Imperials forced to work with the Rebels to defeat the evil Ssi-Ruuk. Once it becomes clear that the aliens are in retreat, the Empire reverts back to their evil selves and re-declares war on the Alliance.\n\nIn A Darkness at Sethanon, the Heroic Prince teams up with the former Evil Chancellor to defend a city against the The Horde. Subverted in that they not only fail to defend the city, but manage to blow it up.\n\nThat isn't really a failure though. They were outnumbered about fifteen to one, and their enemy was using magic. The destruction of the city was to prevent the enemy from taking it and destroy a lot of the enemy along with it. Given the odds, it was a resounding success and achieved its goal perfectly.\n\nUntil it's revealed at the end that a massive casualty toll was what the Big Bad wanted all along—Murmandamus, in reality a Pantathian disguised as the legendary moredhel prophet to manipulate the moredhel, was using the escaped life energy to power himself up to be able to activate the Doomsday Device at Sethanon, and it didn't matter to him in the least if the dead were human or moredhel (or troll or goblin).\n\nIn Honored Enemy, a band of Kingdom raiders allies with a Tsurani patrol in order to survive pursuit from a Moredhel company. The story plays during the war between the Kingdom and the Tsurani and revolves around the tension this causes.\n\nIn Betrayal at Krondor, the moredhel chieftain Gorath seeks out Prince Arutha to curb another upcoming invasion that he feels would be too costly for his people.\n\nThe Animorphs only teamed up with their main enemy, Visser Three, twice: to defeat a race of annoying, psycho, tiny-tiny-tiny aliens with a shrink ray and a mass Napoleon Complex, and to escape from a bunch of mutated blue fish-people that want to kill and stuff them for their Derelict Graveyard. On the other hand, Visser One freed them from Visser Three's prison in her very first appearance. Since the Animorphs are guerrilla fighters and Visser One is the main advocate for a stealth invasion (and her host is Marco's mom), they're not unwilling to accommodate her if it hurts Visser Three's credibility—but they're not unwilling to use it as an excuse to double-cross her, either...\n\nIn The Other Wind, the last (so far) in Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series, representatives of four cultures normally at loggerheads - if not outright enmity - have to pool their respective mythological knowledge in order to figure out the truth about an ancient evil.\n\nIn the Crown of Slaves sub-series of the Honorverse, Victor Cachat and Anton Zilwicki are two intelligence operatives from the warring Star Empire of Manticore and the Republic of Haven (Formerly Peoples Republic of Haven). They team up to investigate Mesan intrigue and how it impacts the war. It's implied this sub series may lead to a Grand Alliance...\n\nReally, by now it's evident that The Climactic Conflict will be between the Andermani/Havenites/Manticore/Maya/Beowulf/Torch/others versus the frikkin' huge Solarian League (minus bits like Maya)/Mesa/whatever else we haven't seen yet. It promises to be awesome.\n\nAs of Mission Of Honor, Manticore and Haven have signed both a peace treaty and a military alliance.\n\nTad Williams' Otherland Cyberpunk novel series has a prominent example of this in the fourth book. After Psycho for Hire John Dread usurps control of the Otherland network, Corrupt Corporate Executive Felix Jongleur, who up until now has regarded the heroes as an annoyance (if he was aware of them at all), finds himself on equal footing with them: trapped in the network and unable to use his godlike powers.\n\nThis is a major part of the plot of all 3 novels in CS Friedman's Coldfire Trilogy trilogy: an immortal vampire and a priest team up to fight mutual enemies. By the end of the novels, the priest has been thrown out of his church and the vampire's patron Dark God has rescinded his immortality and cast him into Hell for being insufficiently evil. Turns out saving the world isn't compatible with maintaining that black-as-a-moonless-night karma, who knew?\n\nThe Hobbit. The dwarves are about to fight a battle with the Lake-men and Wood-elves to determine who will gain Smaug's treasure. Gandalf appears and warns them that an army of goblins and wargs is approaching, and they must join together to fight the evil attackers.\n\nIn Dragonlance, black robed mages ally themselves with the good guys every now and then, for example to drive off the Dark Queen in Legend of Huma and during the War of the Lance. Dragons of Summer Flame was based around this trope. Also Fistandantilus and the Kingpriest used each other for their own goals.\n\nIn The Legend of Drizzt Drizzt Do'Urden and Artemis Entreri must team up and fight back to back in an effort to get out of the Underdark at one point.\n\nIt is briefly mentioned in the Warhammer 40,000 novel Grey Knights that the underhive gangs of Volcanis Ultor \"buried their enmities for one long night\" to do battle with a powerful gang of Chaos followers.\n\nTwilight: The Cullens (Vegetarian Vampires) and the Quilettes (Werewolves born to kill vampires), had to work together to destroy an army of newborn vampires that were killing people in general and wanted to kill Bella Swan in particular.\n\nStar Wars: While most of the clone troopers went on to serve the empire, the True Mandalorians (a.k.a. the group that nearly destroyed the Galactic Republic 4,000 years ago) fought alongside the rebels to retain their heritage as well as kill those who had betrayed their own kin.\n\nFate of the Jedi: Jedi and the Lost Tribe of the Sith form an alliance (in the titular Allies), to investigate and subdue a feminine Eldritch Abomination named Abeloth. The arrangement doesn't last long, but it does allow Luke's son Ben to pick up a Sith Apprentice Girlfriend...\n\nSpeaking of Fate of the Jedi, Apocalypse reveals that the Father, the Son, and the Daughter had fought against Abeloth multiple times after she got corrupted. The mere fact that the Son, who is the embodiment of the Dark Side, would ally himself with the Daughter, who is the embodiment of the Light Side, even when they would more often than not fight each other to the death had it not been for the Father's influence would imply that this trope came into play.\n\nA Song of Ice and Fire has some interesting ones. Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth are forced to coexist when Catelyn Stark sends Brienne to trade Jaime for Sansa, but though they start out quite hostile, they've actually reached a point of sort-of friendship and mutual respect (and maybe more). A more hostile camaraderie briefly exists between Sandor Clegane and Arya Stark; she still hates him, sure, but when it comes down to it they work well together, and she's probably more like him than she'd like to acknowledge. On a larger scale in A Dance with Dragons the wildlings and the Night's Watch agree to work together against the Others. Many of them aren't happy about this, rendering the alliance extremely tenuous.\n\nRecently reversed in the Star Trek Expanded Universe. In the wake of the Borg invasion, several previously non-aligned minor enemies such as the Tholians join the Typhon Pact in order to leave the Federation and Klingon Empire surrounded by a hostile power. The Tholians, well-known for xenophobia, join for this reason alone.\n\nThe Dale Brown novel Air Battle Force culminates in the Taliban detachment that served as primary enemy of that book working with Turkmen and American forces against the Russians, which continues into Plan of Attack.\n\nEdge of Battle has Zakharov and Task Force TALON reluctantly cooperating after Comandante Veracruz's double-cross, though it doesn't last.\n\nStrike Force is centred on an Iranian coup leader and former enemy of Dreamland who now needs their help. The blurb tells you as much!\n\nA Pict Song by Rudyard Kipling. \"No indeed! We are not strong, But we know Peoples that are...\"\n\nThe White Rose by Glen Cook. In the final battle the Lady—sorceress leader of the northern empire—needs the help of the white rose to take down the dominator, her husband and a much better sorcerer. The white rose creates a area where magic cannot be used and therefore is vital to taking down the greatest sorcerer in known history.\n\nIn Streams of Silver, Drizzt Do'Urden and Artemis Entreri declared a temporary truce in order to join forces against a common enemy. Some time later, in Starless Night, Catti-Brie and Entreri teamed up to rescue Drizzt from the drow, who were holding all three of them captive and who would have eventually executed both Drizzt and Entreri. (Or condemned them to a Fate Worse Than Death.)\n\nArtemis Fowl and Holly do this in The Arctic Incident and The Eternity Code—they are opponents, or at the very least rivals with a sore history, even though they have both saved each others' lives by now. In The Arctic Incident, they cooperate as part of a deal: Artemis uses his above-world influence to investigate a smuggler, while the LEP use their advanced technology to help rescue Fowl Senior. In The Eternity Code, their relationship is more tense as they cooperate to resolve a situation Artemis is partly to blame for. By The Opal Deception, they are friends, and later possibly more than that, though that does not go anywhere.\n\nA complicated example occurs in the \"Richard Bachman\" (actually Stephen King) novel The Regulators. The demon Tak is possessing a young autistic boy, and is somehow using the boy's unique mind to augment and give shape to its supernatural power. Both the boy and the demon are fans of cheap westerns and a Power-Rangers style TV show, both of which the demon uses as inspiration for his means of destroying the town. In the show-within-a-show, the heros team up with their enemy to stop a something from destroying Earth. Tak channels this as the final assault on the protagonists.\n\nIn Hunger, the second book in the Gone (novel) series, Sam and Caine do this to kill Drake, team up against the Gaiaphage, rescue Lana, and heal the wounded kids on both sides.\n\nThis is how Miles Vorkosigan's parents got together, in Shards of Honor.\n\nIn Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian story \"Rogues in the House\" after Murilo and Conan have broken into Nabonidus's house to kill him, and find that he is not, after all, the Beast Man, they ally with him to deal with it.\n\nIn Shattered Sky, the third book in the Star Shards Chronicles trilogy, the good guys team up with Okoya, the villain of the second book to defeat a greater enemy that threatens to destroy the universe.\n\nIn The Trail of Cthulhu, it's revealed that Professor Shrewsbury and Hastur (presented here as Cthulhu's rival brother) have struck an alliance to keep Cthulhu from waking up.\n\nIn The Dresden Files series, Harry teams up with Lara Raith multiple times over the course of the series to help them reach mutual goals.\n\nIn the Codex Alera series, the Canim have Gadara, meaning \"trusted enemy\". Gadara can often work together, as Tavi and Varg eventually do.\n\nIn The Man from U.N.C.L.E. novel The Dagger Affair by David McDaniel, UNCLE and THRUSH operatives work together to stop DAGGER, a new organization armed with advanced science. In the end a THRUSH-controlled fighter jet kamikazes the DAGGER base, using sheer momentum to overwhelm its force field. There's a poignant moment where the leader of THRUSH reminds the leader of UNCLE of their former friendship and gives him a copy of Nineteen Eighty-Four. Then he ends the truce ahead of the agreed time, not that anyone expected anything else. We also discover that the full name of THRUSH is the somewhat unwieldy \"Technological Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity\".\n\nIn the second book of the Mistborn trilogy, Vin finds herself working with an enemy - Ten-Soon, who had assumed the identity of Ore-Seur, and had been working on behalf of Straff Venture.\n\nThis happens in The Path to War where Tahniya is soul bound to Zan as punishment; they can't stand each other.\n\nBertie Wooster and Sir Roderick Glossop team up in Thank You, Jeeves and end up getting along very well, even exchanging invitations to lunch. Bertie notes that he can't be all bad, since he beat up Chuffy's Bratty Half-Pint cousin Seabury.\n\nLive-Action TV\n\nThe X-Files episode \"En Ami\". And \"Tunguska\"/\"Terma\" as well, although that turned out to be a set-up.\n\nThis was part of the concept for Star Trek: Voyager, although by the third season the rival crew factions have been forgotten.\n\nIn a later season of Voyager, in the episode where the Delta Flyer is introduced, B'Elanna Torres learns that the Maquis lost back home. She turns depressed and does dangerous things in the Holodeck with the safety off, and because most of the ship has all but forgotten their initial division between Starfleet and Maquis, they don't know what's wrong with her.\n\nWhen they first re-establish contact with Starfleet, Janeway mentions to Chekotay that she actually had forgotten the implications of the mixed crew after they had been working together for so long.\n\nStar Trek in general is all over this trope. The Klingons team up with the Enterprise crew in \"Day of the Dove\", the Klingons allying with the Romulans against the Federation and then later with the Federation against the Romulans, Voyager teaming with the Borg in \"Scorpion\", The Alliance of the Alpha Quadrant (and the poor, forgotten Beta Quadrant!) against the Dominion, etc., etc.\n\nStar Trek: Deep Space Nine: Kira, Damar and Garak all loath each other. Eventually, the fate of Cardassia and the Alpha Quadrant rests on the 3 of putting aside their differences and working together to create a rebellion to overthrow the Dominion control of Cardassia. It even leads to the beginning of Fire-Forged Friends.\n\nStar Trek: Enterprise, \"Dawn,\" \"Storm Front\" (Archer fighting alongside Silik)\n\nStar Trek: The Next Generation, \"Darmok\". In the midst of the plot, Picard retells similar parts of The Epic of Gilgamesh, highlighting this as Older Than Dirt.\n\nRather famously, the Tamarian for this trope is \"Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.\"\n\nTNG also did it in \"The Enemy\", where Geordi and a Romulan had to work together.\n\nIn Buffy the Vampire Slayer Buffy teamed up with Spike to stop Angelus at the end of season 2. With some unusual fallout; because the main time she'd met him had been during this Enemy Mine situation, when Spike returned in season 3, Joyce thought that they were actually allies and let him in. In season four he also teamed up with them a few times for various reasons (once because Giles just paid him to), and by the fifth he ran out of a need for outside excuses and turned into a straight ally.\n\nIn Twenty Four Season 2, Jack is forced to work with Nina Myers, the woman who killed his wife, in order to find information on the season's terrorist threat. Likewise, in season 6, Jack teams up with the previous season's Big Bad Charles Logan to investigate a corrupt Russian diplomat.\n\nThe Doctor Who serial Logopolis. Of course, the Master turns on the Doctor, tries to destroy the Universe rather than being unable to rule it, and then kills the Doctor by shaking him off a radio telescope into a parking lot. It isn't the end though, as the moment has been prepared for. Considering how the Master is just about the closest thing the Doctor has to a rival, they've certainly been forced to team up on any number of occasions throughout their history—usually to stop a catastrophic evil that the Master himself unleashed, and invariably with the Master turning on the Doctor shortly before or after the problem is solved. Of course, the Doctor has been anticipating betrayal all along, and has almost certainly done something clever to come out ahead regardless.\n\nHappens again in The End of Time, where the Master saved the Doctor from being disintegrated by Rassilon. It should be noted that Rassilon brought the alliance, and thus his defeat, upon himself.\n\nDifferently, in \"The Pandorica Opens\", Judoon, Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen, Silurians, Sycorax, Autons and a whole load of other races show up to imprison the Doctor in an attempt to stop the non-existence of the Universe.\n\nIn \"A Good Man Goes to War\", the Doctor calls upon the aid of the Silurians, Judoon and a lone dishonored Sontaran alongside actual friends to rescue Amy. However, the Silurians and Sontaran's reasons for teaming up isn't so much the presence of a common enemy as it is the fact that they owe the Doctor a debt.\n\nBabylon 5, \"Dust to Dust\". Bester teams up with Garibaldi to catch drug smugglers. JMS explicitly stated this was to prevent Villain Decay.\n\nAnother episode has a scene deliberately written in defiance of the trope, which Straczynski hates. Mortal enemies Londo and G'Kar are trapped in an elevator with a fire outside draining their oxygen. Londo declares that they'll have to work together to escape but G'Kar refuses: he's perfectly fine with dying as long as he gets to see Londo die, too.\n\nThe irony of this is that, if the Narn surrender treaty didn't include such harsh penalties for G'Kar just killing Londo, he might happily have helped. However, thanks to the excessive measures taken to prevent narns attacking centauri, this was the only way G'Kar would ever get to see Londo die.\n\nFurther irony is piled on by finally playing the trope straight when Londo's Prophecy Twist kicks in. At that point G'Kar is one of the last two friends Londo has.\n\nGalactica 1980, episode \"The Return of Starbuck\". Often the only episode of the series that some fans of the original Battlestar Galactica will accept as continuity.\n\nThe new Battlestar Galactica has this quite a few times as well, usually involving Cylons and humans co-operating, such as Athena's Heel Face Turn and the rebel Cylon faction seeking Galactica‍'‍s help against Brother Cavil. However the \"enemy of my enemy is my friend\" quote is actually used by President Roslin when she teams up with terrorist-turned-radical politician Tom Zarek, after Commander Adama tries to force her resignation.\n\nStargate SG-1 features this a great many times. It seems to be one of the favorite negotiating tactics of the Tau'ri in particular.\n\nBa'al has had to join forces with SG-1 to defeat his master Anubis and the greater threat of the Replicators during the \"Reckoning\" two-parter. This is not the last time they'd work with him. Initially subverted, as Ba'al asked SG-1 for an alliance and was flat-out rejected by Jack O'Neill.\n\nSpecial mention just has to go to the two-parter \"The Quest\", where SG-1, Ba'al, and Ori messiah Adria team up to solve Morgan le Fay's puzzles.\n\nThere is also an SG-1 episode entitled \"Enemy Mine\", though it is unrelated to this trope at first. The conclusion is somewhat an example of this trope, as the Colonel overseeing the mine and the Unas definitely considered each other enemies until the compromise where they agreed to work the mine themselves so long as it contributed to killing some Goa'uld. Plus they look a little Enemy Mine Lou Gossetty, what with the scaly skin and labored manner of speaking.\n\nThe original alliance (the one led by Ra) against Anubis, whose crimes were apparently considered unspeakable, even amongst the System Lords. Think about that.\n\nSokar was banished from the System Lords for much the same reason, and by much the same method.\n\nAccording to Thor in \"Fair Game\", it is precisely because of the concept of \"enemy of my enemy\" that the Goa'uld System Lords banded together in the first place. Due to their Exclusively Evil nature, however, it takes a serious threat (like the Tau'ri) to convince them to work together for any extended length of time.\n\nThe \"Giant Aliens\" (later named Omeyocans by the novel City of the Gods) in the episode \"Crystal Skull\" quote the full line verbatim to SG-1. In Mayan, no less.\n\nThen there's the various times the SGC temporarily allied with Lord Yu. To paraphrase Daniel Jackson, Yu is not to be liked or trusted, only trusted to make a practical decision unhampered by the usual Goa'uld mindset.\n\nIn Stargate Atlantis, Sheppard and a wraith cooperated to escape custody of Kolya in the episode \"Common Ground\". This included the wraith feeding on Sheppard to have the strength to fight off their enemies, giving it the opportunity to double-cross our hero. However, he returned all the Life Energy he took (and possibly made up for a few months Sheppard spent in a time-dilation field) and Sheppard made good on his promise to let it go free. The wraith in question, later dubbed \"Todd\", would become a recurring character, and is notable for being unusually sociable for a Wraith, even joking with the heroes.\n\nTaken Up to Eleven in the final battle against the Asurans, where the Earth, Traveller, and Wraith ships fight side by side against the Asuran warships in what is hands down the single most awesome space battle any of the three series has managed (Stargate Universe, being set on a Cool Starship, had a chance to top it before it was cancelled). This is even more impressive given the distinctly quarrelsome nature of the Wraith, thus the battle is a meld of nine factions (7 Hives, Atlantis and the Travellers) rather than 3 as some may think.\n\nCertain incarnations of Power Rangers have done this, particularly Power Rangers Zeo. The Big Bad of the moment has brainwashed The Hero and the Sixth Ranger's attempt to save him has failed. It turns out that last year's villains have the technology to send the rest of the team over. They do, just to screw around with the new villains.\n\nLikewise, a villain variant of this was completely subverted in Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie. Newly anointed Big Bad Divatox calls decayed villain Rita Repulsa for help, and gets laughed at. Rita's Captain Obvious response is that if she knew how to defeat the Rangers, she would have done it already.\n\nAirwolf, \"Condemned\". String and Caitlin have to work together with some Reds With Rockets to acquire the antidote for a lethal virus. Then stop three nuclear warhead-equipped cruise missiles from hitting the island. Soviets attempt to acquire Airwolf, but don't get very far and stop this before things get hairy between them. The parties depart friends.\n\nFirefly does this in the episode \"Trash\", where the crew joins up on a heist with Saffron, the psychotic seductress who tried to steal their ship a few episodes back. Rather amusingly subverted: Saffron unsurprisingly double-crosses the crew, and the crew turns on on her in return, having fully expected her sudden but inevitable betrayal.\n\nEven Scrubs features this trope when Dr. Cox and Dr. Kelso team up to break the spirit of an overly cheery coworker. However, she outsmarts them and they are back to mutual hate by the end of the episode.\n\nAnother episode featured Dr. Kelso notice that everyone in the hospital was arguing, so he invokes this by getting everyone to turn against him.\n\nBuck, Dr. Crower, Gail, and Ben are all forced to work together in the American Gothic episode \"The Beast Within\", when Ben's deranged brother takes them all hostage: Dr. Matt's hand is hurt so he has to coach Ben in performing an emergency surgery, while Buck and Gail have to work together to find the lost key to the handcuffs holding them and Caleb prisoner. (The fact this all turns out to be The Plan orchestrated by Buck rather subverts the trope.)\n\nAnd at the very end of the series, Merlyn is forced to go to Dr. Peele, Selena, and Ben for aid in digging up Buck's 'corpse' so that the two of them can then work together to save Gail and stop Caleb's rampage.\n\nAn unusual example occurs in The 4400 where Jordan Collier and Tom Baldwin must work together to escape a dream sequence (whose actual purpose is to get people to work together). It's an odd example in that neither character is a villain: as Tom is a government official doing its best to deal with bizarre circumstances (and sometimes engaging a some morally-questionable methods of dealing with problems) and Jordan Collier is trying to avert the end of civilization, but supports anarchy and believes everyone should take Promicin (a drug that has a 50% chance of death or super-powers).\n\nIn Season 3 of Heroes, Noah Bennet makes a surprising team-up with Sylar to stop the escaped Level 5 villains. The two even seem to have bonded by the end of the 3rd episode, at least until Sylar starts up with the brain-stealing again, causing Bennett to vow to kill him eventually.\n\nWhat Noah Bennet meant could very likely refer to taming Sylar. In Season 3, Episode 4, \"I am Become Death\", Peter is taken to a future timeline by his future self. In this timeline, Peter discovers a calm and collected Sylar, living in the Bennet household with a son named Noah.\n\nAlso, in the Season 3 season finale, Bennet frees all the Level 5 supervillains so they can help fight Sylar, who's on the downswing of his Heel Face Revolving Door trend. They all last maybe 3 minutes, tops.\n\nSeason 4 does this again when Peter realizes that in order to prevent Samuel Sullivan's plans from coming into fruition, he's going to need Sylar's help. Unfortunately, it meant getting himself stuck inside Sylar's head and dealing with the latter's Villainous BSOD.\n\nSubverted in Angel during the fourth season, when Angel comes to Lilah for information on the Beast and suggests they work together:\n\nHowever, Angel eventually convinces Lilah to give him the information he was seeking, with the argument that Angel will either use it to stop The Beast (in which case Lilah wins) or Angel will die trying (in which case Lilah also wins). As it turns out he decided to Take a Third Option, so in the end it's more played straight.\n\nAnd in the end, she does ally with the team anyways.\n\nLost has done several times, both in regards to the survivors and the Others:\n\nFirst in Season 3, when Kate and Juliet are handcuffed together and forced to work together to escape the smoke monster's repeated attacks. It turns out Juliet herself handcuffed them together to try and gain Kate's trust.\n\nThe second time occurs at the end of Season 4, when Kate and Sayid must team up with Richard and his army of Others to rescue Ben from the freighter mercenaries.\n\nThen there is the reluctant team-up between Losties and the Others of 1977 in the Season 5 finale.\n\nFinally, Season 6 had everyone teaming up against the new Big Bad. Ben Linus and Charles Widmore sure were surprised to find themselves working toward a common goal!\n\nHappens regularly in soap operas. For example, on All My Children, lifetime enemies Adam and Palmer teamed up to kill a rapist.\n\nIn the first season of the BBC's Robin Hood Robin and the sheriff temporarily fight side-by-side in order to defeat a group of Saladin's assassins. In the third season Robin and Guy team up in order to save their half-brother Archer from execution.\n\nThe Man from U.N.C.L.E. had this trope as part of its central premise, as THRUSH forces the Western nations and their ideological opponents the Soviet Union to cooperate in forming UNCLE.\n\nMash: Charles Winchester, ordinarily a foil to Hawkeye and B.J., will occasionally join forces with one of them against the other (usually as part of an Escalating War), or with both of them against a common target. The latter moments tend to highlight Winchester's Jerk with a Heart of Gold qualities, given that the people he targets are always bullies themselves, such as a racist colonel, or a man bigoted against people with learning disabilities, or the insanely jingoistic Colonel Flagg.\n\nOne good example is the episode where Hot Lips is being accused of being a communist by a congressional aide. Without even being asked, Winchester takes a stand against the aide and takes up for Margaret.\n\nIn The Wire, Shotgun-toting Badass Longcoat stick-up boy Omar Little and Harper's Magazine-reading Uber-Badass Bookworm assassin Brother Mouzone team up to take on Stringer Bell after a failed Let's You and Him Fight. And it is awesome.\n\nWhile not as big of enemies as most of the other examples, Naturally, Sadie uses this a lot to get characters who dislike one of the main cast to work alongside them, usually for a school project. One memorable incident has almost the entire teenage cast working together in detention while the remaining member teams up with Mallcop—two examples in one episode, there are many more.\n\nHappens all the time in the prison drama Oz as the various factions struggle for control of the drug trade, or seek to murder a rival.\n\nThe title character of Merlin-1998 outright states that this is his motivation for allying himself to Uther. Uther's enemy, Vortigern, is Merlin's enemy and has joined forces with an even worse enemy.\n\nIn season 5 of Supernatural, Sam, Dean, and the others join forces with the demon Crowley in an attempt to defeat Lucifer.\n\nAn odd example when Gabriel joins forces with the Winchesters and goes up against Lucifer, resulting in his death, since he spent most of the time he knew them tormenting them. Although it's implied that he knew that they'd eventually do, which is why he gave them such a hard time.\n\nAnd later join forces with Meg to defeat Crowley.\n\nWhich is an interesting use of this trope, seeing as Meg was a staunch Lucifer loyalist whom the boys had fought against in the same episode they first allied with Crowley.\n\nFarscape:\n\nPlayed straight in the \"Liars, Guns, and Money\" trilogy when Moya's crew recruit various aliens who had tried to kill them in the past to help them pull off a heist.\n\nPlayed straight and subverted with John and Scorpius multiple times as John pretends to team up with Scorpius, then John is forced to team up with Scorpius to save Aeryn (twice!), then it looks like Scorpius has betrayed them but he really hasn't, then John betrays Scorpius only to have to go back and save him again. And then they end up teaming up with Scorpius again for the miniseries, still against John's better judgment.\n\nLeverage has Nate teaming up with his Evil Counterpart Sterling for \"The Zanzibar Marketplace Job\".\n\nIn the Smallville episode \"Asylum\" Ian Randall and Eric Summers ask for the help of Van McNulty because he knows Clark's weakness.\n\nThis happens several times in Charmed when the Halliwell sisters must reluctantly team up with demons for various reasons that are in the best interests of both sides, such as preventing the existence of magic from being revealed to the mostly unaware human population or stopping a neutral third party whose plan, if successful, would result in the vast majority of combatants on both sides being exterminated.\n\nA strange case of this happens in Season 6's two-part season finale where that season's Big Bad, corrupt Elder Gideon, teams up with his evil Mirror Universe counterpart to trap two of the sisters in the Mirror Universe where they team up with that universe's version of their most notorious recurring enemy, the demon Barbas (since demons are the good guys in that universe) before fighting and then teaming up with their own evil counterparts in order to return to their own universe. Unfortunately, that causes the two universes to become unbalanced resulting in the normal universe becoming too good and the mirror universe becoming too evil, which forces the sisters to once again team up with their evil counterparts to restore the balance between both universes by killing both versions of Gideon, who have each meanwhile teamed up with their own universe's version of Barbas. In short, the entire episode is a confusing mess of various Enemy Mine scenarios.\n\nHappens in American Horror Story. Constance forms an alliance with Moira, the ghost of the woman she murdered, to dispose of a sleazy developer who plans to tear down the house.\n\nTerra Nova episode \"Now You See Me\". Taylor and Mira's \"Your place or mine\" hostage struggle is interrupted by a pair of young and territorial Slashers. Leading to Taylor to hand a knife to Mira and say “We can fight each other, or we can fight them.”\n\nIn Kamen Rider Decade's final arc, the separate Kamen Rider worlds are pitted against each other in a giant war, with the losers being erased from existence, so naturally Riders and Kaijin put aside their differences in order to protect their universes. Tsukasa, in the meantime, tries to convince everyone to focus on the common enemy in Daishocker; it works almost too late, but then the death of Apollo Geist actually accelerates the destruction rather than stopping it. Dammit.\n\nProfessional Wrestling\n\nSince most wrestlers theoretically have little say on who they either fight or team with, an Enemy Mine often occurs when an on-screen authority figure randomly decides two people who don't like each other will team up against a common enemy. This used to happen all the time with Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock. An example would be when Stone Cold was booked to fight The Undertaker and Rock against Triple H at Over the Edge 1998, one Raw saw Austin and Rock being forced to team together against Undertaker and Triple H. Since Undertaker and Triple H were members of the same stable, the story of the match was whether Austin and Rock (who only weeks earlier were in a bitter feud) could put up with each other long enough to survive.\n\nThis specific Enemy Mine would occur several times through 1999, not all of them being in official matches. For example: the SmackDown pilot in which the Corporate Ministry came together in the first place.\n\nStone Cold and The Rock would continue to find themselves unwilling partners as late as 2002, when they teamed up the week before Wrestlemania X8 to face the New World Order in a handicap match.\n\nA Pro Wrestling tag-team championship can also serve as an Enemy Mine, as a Face and a Heel are thrust into a match with the titles on the line, and despite their bickering and contempt for each other, manage to win. They're then obligated to continue teaming to defend the championship, arguing and taking potshots at each other all the while, until one of them finally decides being a champion isn't worth the headache and turns on the other. A 2007 example is Matt Hardy and M.V.P. on WWE Smackdown.\n\nSlightly Subverted Trope in 2008 with John Cena and Batista, who won the tag titles but were bitter enemies facing each other, and couldn't co-exist, and lost the tag titles back on their first defense the next week.\n\nEven more so with Cena and The Miz who couldn't co-exist as tag team champions for ten minutes before Miz betrayed Cena.\n\nHilariously lampshaded in a backstage segment with Team Triple H at Survivor Series 2007. Kane, Jeff Hardy, and Rey Mysterio Jr call out Triple H on his numerous past offenses against them, which The Game sheepishly apologizes for. However, the team acknowledges that while they don't necessarily like one another, they like the other team even less.\n\nIn 2010, the rise of The Nexus Power Stable on WWE Raw saw the teaming up of former rivals like John Cena, Edge, and Chris Jericho after each got ambushed by The Nexus.\n\nSubverted at Summerslam 2010, when usual Cena rival The Miz tried to play on the \"need\" for this (especially after Cena honestly tried to keep them together, but Edge and Jericho proved incompatible) to make Cena beg him to round out the team... by the time Miz tried to pull the trigger, Cena declared that Miz had taken too long to make up his mind and that Cena had found someone else who said yes first: Cue the triumphant return of one Daniel Bryan.\n\nIn a interesting twist, The Rise and Fall of ECW showed that Tazz and Sabu hated each other in real life, but ended up becoming one of the company's top tag teams prior to Tazz breaking his neck.\n\nTommy Dreamer and Raven became a tag team for a while.\n\nAmerican Wrestling Association had an angle in 1985 where the Russian faction of Boris Zhukov and Chris Markoff injured Rick Martel. Martel's friend Mad Dog Vachon came looking for revenge and turned to the only man he felt was dirty and ruthless enough to stop the Russians: his old enemy Nick Bockwinkle.\n\nOften happens in Royal Rumbles and Battle Royals, as many wrestlers team up to eliminate the biggest wrestlers.\n\nTabletop Games\n\nCard Games\n\nMagic: The Gathering has a number of scenarios, including current events on Zendikar (with the vampires, elves, humans, Kor, minotaurs, goblins, merfolk and what-have-you uniting against the Eldrazi), and a significant part of the dynamic for the good guys in the Archenemy variant (since they can easily be colors that either do or would hate each other slightly less than they hate the main opponent).\n\nAlmost all cards in Magic the Gathering are divided into one of five categories, defined by certain characteristics and assigned a colour. The five colours are seen on the back of the cards in a pentangle. The characters and creatures associated with any particular colour are hated by the colours on either of the nearer points, but even they will ally to fight against a colour further away (physically and thematically) from one of them.\n\nIn Scars of Mirrodin block, the Mirran forces in all five colours were forced to team up against Phyrexia...although the black section was wiped out by the second set, and Phyrexia won.\n\nTabletop RPG\n\nMage: The Awakening generally sees the Pentacle Orders locked in battle against the Seers of the Throne. However, when a Left-Handed Legacy (servants of the Abyss) makes itself known, both sides will declare a truce and stamp it out as best they can.\n\nMage: The Ascension has much the same dynamic, with the Traditions and the Technocracy setting aside their conflict long enough to take down a Nephandus or Marauder.\n\nWerewolf: The Forsaken does the same thing as well, with the Forsaken and the Pure reluctantly willing to put aside differences and put down Bale Hounds whenever they pop up.\n\nWarhammer 40,000 very, very occasionally has instances where the more reasonable factions will hold off on killing each other to deal with a mutual threat. For a few minutes, anyway.\n\nThis most commonly occurs between forces of the Imperium, Eldar, and Tau against Tyranids, Necrons, or Chaos, and matching temporary alliances may occur between Chaos, Orks, and Dark Eldar, as prominently seen during Dawn of War: Winter Assault.\n\nThe Eldar, being the trope they are, will often manipulate any alliance they do make so that their allies take the brunt of the fighting (and thus causalities), in essence back-stabbing their allies during the alliance, as well as overtly so 5 minutes before its usefulness ends.\n\nDawn of War II has a new mode which exemplifies this, known as \"The Last Stand\", where a Space Marine Captain, an Ork Mekboy and an Eldar Farseer cooperate to Hold the Line against a swarm of enemies.\n\nChaos Rising throws the Chaos Sorcerer and the Tyranid Hive Tyrant into the mix of heroes in the playmode, which technically cements, if it wasn't apparent with the widely opposing team we had before, that the gamemode is not to be taken as canon, especially when a loyalist space marine cooperates with a chaos space marine in any way.\n\nIn Paranoia, even if someone's ideology is directly opposed to yours (Psion vs. Anti-Mutant, Corpore Metal vs. Frankenstein Destroyers), alliances can always shift to suit the demands of the moment. You can always hose them later.\n\nTheater\n\nIn The Taming of the Shrew, several men are rivals for the hand of the fair Bianca, but her father won't let any of them marry her unless her shrewish older sister, Katarina, is married off first. Realizing that there's no point in fighting each other if they don't have a chance, the suitors decide to work together to get Katarina a husband.\n\nVideo Games\n\nIn Final Fantasy X-2, the Leblanc Syndicate, who are enemies originally, become allies of the Gullwings in Chapter 3. This is different, however, in that they remain allies for the rest of the game, even helping in the fight against Vegnagun.\n\nIn City of Heroes, in the Valentine's Day 2006 and 2007 events, the missions to unlock special prizes required mixed hero-villain teams to complete. As well, the issue 10 update included a whole hero-villain co-op zone, the Rikti War Zone.\n\nIssue 12 added Cimerora, another co-op zone.\n\nFinally, the annual \"Rescue Baby New Year\" event allows heroes and villains to team up, explicitly because the kidnapping of said baby/personification of time would be really really bad for all concerned.\n\nHappens quite often in Metal Slug. Twice, the Rebellion teams up with you to fight the Mars People: in Metal Slug 2 when the Mars People betray them and kidnap their leader, and again in Metal Slug 3 when their leader turns out to be a Martian impostor. Even the ultimate recurring rival and bad-ass Sgt. Allen O'Neill fights on your side. In Metal Slug 6, both groups team up with you to fight a group of Martian-eating aliens.\n\nIn the Super Mario Bros RPGs, Bowser will often team up with Mario against other villains, wanting to be the only villain around. He's particularly enraged when other villains inevitably kidnap Princess Peach in the course of their plans.\n\nIn Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story, he does this completely unknowingly. He doesn't know that the bros are in his gut. All he knows is that Fawful has his castle, and is trying to kidnap his princess and take over his Mushroom Kingdom. Mario and Luigi do their part behind the scenes, even during the Final Battle.\n\nHalo does this twice. First, at the end of the second game in the series, the human UNSC and the Elites, who were previously mortal enemies, join forces to fight the Prophet of Truth, who is planning to exterminate the former and betray the latter. Later on, right before confronting the Prophet himself, the Master Chief and the Arbiter join forces with the Flood to stop Truth from killing everyone in the galaxy.\n\nGranted, this latter alliance lasts only five minutes, and then you curse their sudden yet inevitable betrayal. Although they did at least have the minimal grace to wait until Truth was dead first.\n\nLike you could really trust the Gravemind.\n\nThe full extent of the human/Elite alliance is explored in the ending of Halo 3. The human general says that he can never forgive the Elites for what they did as part of the Covenant, and also as part of alliance (razing most of Africa to stop the Flood), but implies that they just might be able to ignore each other until some time in the future when the pain of the war isn't as fresh. They're not really enemies anymore, but they're definitely not friends.\n\nLikewise, some of the Elites will grudgingly admit to actually having some respect for humanity now. Humanity might be inferior to the Elites on a physical level, massively outnumbered and hopelessly outgunned, but if you look at some of the things the UNSC have done... then even some of the most stubborn of the Elites have admitted that they just got their asses kicked into the Stone Age by a bunch of bloody monkeys, and actually respect humanity for its stubbornness, resourcefulness and bloody-minded persistence in the face of overwhelming odds. It helps that the Elites are a bunch of Proud Warrior Race Guys and respect for honorable and skilled fighters how their culture works.\n\nSupplementary materials like the short stories that came with the collectors' editions establish that the humans had indeed earned the grudging respect of the Elites, because they were doing comparatively well in the war despite inferior numbers and technology (turning what should have been a speedbump for the Covenant into a pyrrhic victory). Further, these materials establish that the Elites are very confused why the Prophets are strictly pursuing a genocidal war of annihilation against the humans (which is secretly because the humans are the real successors to the Forerunners, not the Prophets). It turns out that, if this were just a normal Covenant war of expansion, after so many years of impressive fighting, if the Elites were in charge they would have offered humanity the option to surrender by now, and join the Covenant. They'd be slave-soldiers, but it wouldn't be the genocide the Prophets were planning. Further, the Elites think humans would be a huge step up from their current frontline soldiers, the Grunts.\n\nSpeaking of Bungie, while it isn't exactly an example of this trope, you do join forces with the Pfhor in Marathon, and you do so because if you do, Tycho will decide to keep T'fear from killing all of the humans. It doesn't really matter, since you just go to an alternate reality after he tries to kill you for trying to escape slavery.\n\nIn Batman: Arkham Knight, Batman and Poison Ivy work remarkably well as allies, considering how much she seemed to hate him in the previous game. Seeing as Scarecrow's toxin is as deadly to plants as it is to humans, Ivy needs very little convincing.\n\nIn Devil May Cry 3, hero Dante teams up with his brother and enemy Vergil to fight the penultimate boss. It's barely cold when Vergil challenges Dante for ownership of the Force Edge.\n\nStarCraft is full of those, especially in the Expansion Pack. It starts with Raynor being forced to team up with the Sons of Korhal to evacuate his Doomed Homeplanet and ends up with a three-way alliance between the Terrans, Protoss and Zerg against the Earth Directorate and immature Overmind they were trying to control.\n\nWhich is soon followed by a three-way alliance of the Protoss, Dominion and UED against Kerrigan. it doesn't quite work though.\n\nThat doesn't really fit the bill of 'cooperating.' It's more like 'not attacking each other until a particular target is dead.' The three forces weren't even aware of each other until they all showed up on Kerrigan's doorstep at the same time.\n\nIn StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, during the final arc, Raynor join forces with the Terran dominion against Kerrigan. This time, it works.\n\nWarcraft, borrowing some plot elements from StarCraft, also has quite a few such moments, the ultimate being the battle at Mt. Hyjal where the Alliance, the Horde and the previously hostile to both Nightelves put their differences aside to stop the demons. Only to have the Alliance (now including the Nightelves) and the Horde break apart in about 4 years in time for the next game in the setting, World of Warcraft.\n\nWhich got its own moments of temporal alliances, such as the War of the Shifting Sands, the Opening of the Dark Portal (where the Horde and Alliance came to the aid of a neutral faction holding back demonic forces coming through the portal), and most recently, the Shattered Sun Offensive. At the same time though, both sides keep fighting in arenas, battlegrounds and the open world.\n\nIn Burning Crusade, there are Aldor and Scryers factions in Shattrath City which are rivals of each other on the borders of open hostilities. Players have to pick between them and befriending one means you are hostile to the other. However, near the conclusion of Burning Crusade during the Sunwell event, they finally put aside their differences and band together to form the Shattered Sun Offensive against Kael'thas Sunstrider and Kil'jaeden.\n\nAnother was added in Wrath of the Lich King, though it borders on Big Damn Heroes. The Alliance and the Horde work together at the Wrathgate in fighting the Scourge, which stands in contrast to them murdering each other for resources and fun everywhere else.\n\nIn fact, a massive part of Wrath is how the Horde and Alliance start with this and end trying to kill each other and letting the Lich King off to the side to kill them both. In Cataclysm, Deathwing has become a greater threat than the scourge was because the Alliance and Horde have lost all pretense of working together on anything.\n\nIn Rise of the Zandalari, Vol'jin, leader of the Horde's Darkspear Trolls, is so concerned about the uprising of the other evil troll factions, that he sends emissaries to both the Horde and the Alliance. Instead of trying to get Warchief Hellscream and King Wrynn to work together, he reaches out to the individual heroes, and the smaller groups within the Horde and Alliance that are directly in the Trolls' path.\n\nThe two forces attempted to work with each other in Legion during the Battle of the Broken Shore, but it ended badly. When Thrall and Vol'jin were wounded (mortally, in the latter's case) Sylvanus ordered a retreat; this led to the Alliance forces decimated and Varian slain. Unknowing of what had happened on the Horde side, the Alliance assumed the Horde had abandoned them, souring their relations even further.}}\n\nStill, they compensated for that with the 7.2 expansion, aka \"round two\", where they two factions rain death upon the Legion in a cooperative effort not seen since Hyjai. For a while, it seemed peace may yet be possible... for a while, that is.\n\nIn Battle for Azeroth (an expansion where the war between the two factions is at the worst) Jaina Proudmoore and Mathias Shaw ally themselves with Saurfang and Thrall to rescue Blaine Bloodhoof, who is under order of execution for treason. There is some suggestion that Sylvanus might have manipulated one or both of the plans' in order for the two teams to meet, hoping they'd fight each other, but while it does result in Teeth-Clenched Teamwork, the rescue is successful.\n\nAlso in Battle for Azeroth, the two factions call a truce to deal with Azshara during the Eternal Palace raid, clearly understanding that she is the greater evil.\n\nOccurs in Might and Magic VII, with reformed Magnificent Bastard Archibald Ironfist assisting the party in rescuing his brother King Roland and taking on the Kreegans.\n\nThe climax of the Restoration Wars featured a team-up between Catherine Ironfist and a faction of Necromancers that had gotten tired of Catherine's father's rule (events earlier in the story had lead to his reanimation at the Necromancers' hands, only for him to promptly off their king and take control himself).\n\nMight and Magic VIII plays with it: on the one hand, the Big Bad gives you as much help as he can give. On the other hand, the only reason he is your enemy is because of a safety protocol intended to keep him from being subverted by the Kreegans (he cannot stop once he has started the destruction of a world), so him trying to sidestep it as much as is possible is only to be expected.\n\nWith the Star FOX team mostly disbanded at the beginning of Star Fox Command and Fox unable (or unwilling) to get his friends back together, one of the paths you can take has Fox hiring long time rival Wolf O'Donnel to help him defeat the Big Bad.\n\nAnd going back to Star Fox Assault, Wolf helps Fox rid the menace of the Aparoids in the last four missions.\n\nPlenty in Super Smash Bros. Brawl:\n\nMarth and Meta Kight fighting, then suddenly teaming up to defeat the Primids around them. This happens again when Meta Knight fights Lucario then immediately after the fierce battle that manages to turn one of them into a trophy, the team up to board the Halbard. This almost happens again when they find Solid Snake, but Lucario stops Meta Knight. Meta Knight has an interesting way to make new friends...\n\nAncient Minister aka a R.O.B. unit helping Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Captain Falcon, Pikachu, Samus, and Captain Olimar.\n\nKing Dedede (by Ness and Luigi), Bowser (by King Dedede, who pointed out that there's a bigger enemy, Tabuu), Ganondorf (by Link and Zelda) and Wario (who kicks King Dedede, which King Dedede, Luigi, and Ness respond to by pointing out Tabuu to Wario, who looks uninterested. When they decide to move on without him, he races past on his bike and beats them to the Big Bad's final dungeon).\n\nA comedic example is shown in Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 where the three factions (represented by their respective tanks) call a truce in the tutorial in order to teach the player not to send their units to their meaningless deaths, though are still prone to firing at each other. Usually at the Soviet Hammer tank.\n\nA more serious example is also to be found in the Allied campaign when the Empire of the Rising Sun attacks-the Allies and Soviets call a ceasefire to destroy the Empire, and proceed to betray each other at about the same time.\n\nThis also occurs in the Tiberium series. In the expansion pack Tiberian Sun: Firestorm, the remnants of Nod and GDI have to work together to stop the renegade Nod AI, CABAL. In Tiberium Wars, Nod general Kilian Qatar allies with GDI to face off against the Scrin, until Kane reveals himself to be not quite dead, flips out, and orders GDI nuked.\n\nHappens in the Yuri's Revenge expansion to Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 as well, when the Soviets and Allies team up to fight Yuri.\n\nThis occurs in Kingdom Hearts II when Maleficent teams up with Sora against Organization XIII.\n\nInterestingly, you never really see Maleficent and Pete helping, just getting ready in a Bolivian Army Ending kind of way. Sora mentions that they've found something worth fighting for, and then we never see them again. Things are back to normal as of Coded though.\n\nAnd also briefly when Axel fights alongside Sora to defeat a load of Nobodies. Since Roxas was lost, he became more of a Wild Card character, and from there was slowly molded into a Sixth Ranger. And it's sealed when he performs a Heroic Sacrifice by taking out an army of Dusks with a Dangerous Forbidden Technique, then uses the last of his power to open the gate to The World That Never Was.\n\nSuper Robot Wars Destiny is an interesting example. While the game includes antagonists from Gundam ZZ, Char's Counterattack, and Gundam Wing, the situation at hand causes them to have the competence to ally with you all at the start since things are bad enough. Due to the Zanscare Empire attacking Earth, along with the Invaders, and the Protodevlin, and the united alien forces of the villains from Daltanius, God Mars, and Grendizer, your heroes quickly realize the only organizations out there that still have the sheer manpower to defend humanity are the Principality of Zeon and the Order of the Zodiac. Roger Smith takes care of the negotiations. This results in the first heroic roles for longstanding villains like Haman Karn and Treize Kushinada.\n\nSuper Robot Wars likes to play with this in smaller ways as well. For instance, Super Robot Wars W has a stage where Tekkaman Evil is forced to (briefly) work with the heroes because of the takeover of Tokyo by the Zonder. On the Selena route of Super Robot Wars Alpha 3, not only does Selena herself spend some time assisting the Cruscet team, Andrew Waltfeld and his adjutant Martin Dacosta assist the Alpha Numbers in holding off an attack by the Barota in a later stage.\n\nOne OG example is when Sanger and Elzam storm the Tesla Liecht Institute to retrieve the Dynamic General Guardians being kept there from the Inspectors. When Sanger's Grungust Type-3 gets damaged, the Inspector Vigagi is about to land a fatal blow when Wodan Ymir appears and intervenes, claiming that he is the only one allowed to kill Sanger. Wodan buys enough time for Sanger to activate the Dygenguard, and goes so far as to be the one who helps Sanger retrieve his Type-3 Zankantou (a job"
