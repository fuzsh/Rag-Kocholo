        "text": "Singing sensation Putri Ariani has been praised for her “angel”-like voice before, but when she joined forces Wednesday night (September 27) with British superstar Leona Lewis, the duo nearly brought down the house.\n\nHow to Watch\n\nWatch America’s Got Talent Tuesdays at 8/7c on NBC and next day on Peacock.\n\nAriani, an America’s Got Talent Season 18 finalist, and Lewis took the stage together during the finale to sing a beautiful rendition of Lewis' \"Run,\" first made famous by Snow Patrol.\n\nA solo Ariani, drenched in a gold gown, started it off sitting at a white piano. She showcased her impressive vocal range before Lewis, who was wearing a stunning white gown, walked onto the stage and joined in, leaving the audience mesmerized by the two powerhouse voices.\n\nAfter hitting the last high note, Lewis had some high praise for her duet partner.\n\nLeona Lewis and Putri Ariani perform on the AGT Season 18 finale\n\n\"You're just incredible and you're just an incredible gift to the world,\" she told Ariani. “You inspire me with your voice.”\n\nAriani was quick to add that it had been an \"honor\" to sing with the huge star.\n\nRELATED: AGT 2023's Season 18 Finale: Spoilers From the Night (LIVE UPDATES)\n\nPutri Ariani first astonished Judges with her AGT Audition, singing not one but two songs at the request of veteran Judge Simon Cowell. The first song, “Loneliness,” was an original written by Ariani herself. When she finished the heartbreaking song, Cowell leapt onto the stage, told her dad she was “amazing” and asked her to sing another song.\n\n“This song is special for you, Simon,” Ariani told him, before launching into Elton John’s “Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word.”\n\nPhoto: Trae Patton/NBC\n\nThe performance blew the Judges away and had Howie Mandel delivering some high praise for the teen.\n\n“You know a lot of people don’t believe in angels, and I think one just landed on our stage,” he declared. “You’re a superstar.”\n\nNot surprisingly, Cowell bestowed his Golden Buzzer on the teen, who is blind, sending her directly into the live rounds of competition.\n\nRELATED: Find Out Who Just Won America's Got Talent 2023!\n\nAriani earned her place in the finale after wowing the crowd once again with her take on the U2 classic “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” during the live performance round.\n\nThe song left Cowell “speechless” and had Judge Sofia Vergara declaring, \"I don't think I've ever heard something more beautiful in my life.”\n\nSeptember 27th's captivating finale wasn’t the first time Lewis has taken the AGT stage to add some star-power to a performance. The “Bleeding Love” singer also performed an emotional duet with AGT finalist Kodi Lee in the Season 14 finale."
