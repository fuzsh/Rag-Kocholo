Our little Carmel Allegra arrived 22.7.22.\"\n\nDennis, who is a German-born creative director, shared the same picture and message on his Instagram account.\n\nFriends and famous faces sent messages to the singer, congratulating her on the new arrival, with Michelle Visage, Dancing on Ice winner and radio presenter Sonny Jay and singer Jessie J all commenting on her Instagram post.\n\nLeona announced her pregnancy on Instagram in March by sharing a photo of her in a black bodycon dress showing off her baby bump.\n\nShe captioned the post: \"Can't wait to meet you in the Summer.\"\n\nLeona has been married to producer and choreographer Dennis Jauch since 2019.\n\nThe couple tied the knot at Sting's estate in Tuscany, Italy, in front of 180 friends and family members, including Sugababes singer Keisha Buchanan and The Voice winner Jermain Jackman, who sang at the ceremony.\n\nIn 2020, Leona spoke about the pair’s plans to have a family – revealing that they would consider adopting as her mum Maria grew up in care.\n\nSpeaking in a magazine interview, Leona said: “I do want children, but Dennis and I have also talked about adopting.\"\n\nLondoner Leona shot to fame in 2006 when she blew the X Factor judges away with a performance of Over The Rainbow.\n\nShe was put in Simon Cowell's 16–24 category and signed a £1 million recording contract with his music label when she won.\n\nHer winner's song, A Moment Like This, was that year's Christmas No1 and stayed at the top of the charts for four weeks, launching a music career that has spanned albums, movies and even a stint on Broadway in the musical Cats."
