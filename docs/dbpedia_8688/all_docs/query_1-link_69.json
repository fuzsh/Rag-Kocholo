        "text": "2. Background Information Born: 3rd April 1985 Genres: RNB and Pop Labels: Syco, RCA records, J\n\n3. Her Journey • Leona Lewis became a singer by winning the famous X-factor competition in 2006. Throughout the years, Leona has become very successful by producing music, her most successful song being ‘Bleeding Love,’ which hit the top in charts all over the world. In 2007 and 2009 Leona Lewis released two albums, Spirit and Echo. Spirit was the fastest selling debut album and was the best seller in 2007. Due to this success, Leona Lewis was made the first British solo artist to top the Billboard 200 as sold 7.2 million copies of her debut were worldwide. Her song ‘Run’ had sold 69,244 copies in 2 days, her third album; Glassheart will be released in early 2012, which was introduced due to her recent song ‘Collide.’ • Leona Lewis had gradually enhanced her fan bass with the help on the TV show Xfactor, as she remained in the competition due to public votes. This helped sales grow as when she produced and released her song her fans purchased it. Her first song was ‘A Moment Like This,’ by Kelly Clarkson. This song was released in December and hit number one on the Christmas Charts, having sold 571,253 copies. • Leona Lewis has changed throughout the years from one of her first music videos to one of her recent videos. Her video ‘Moment Like This,’ is a journey through her time at the Xfactor. It shows how she progressed and grew thorough the competition. The music video shows stereotypes for a Pop and RNB genre, this is because it uses typical conventions that these genres should have, for example, Leona Lewis is wearing a lot of makeup and is also wearing jewellery which is a norm in this genre. However in one of her most recent videos, ‘Collide,’ she stresses more to the fact that her video is an RNB and Pop genre, this is because she uses more conventions to show this. For example, she is wearing tight revealing clothing, which is a typical feature found in this genre. She also wears much more makeup and jewellery than she did in her first video ‘Moment Like This,’ showing that she has improved and grown over the years.\n\n4.
