        "text": "Ava\n\nThe most notable Ava to have existed so far has to be the American actress Ava Gardner. However, the name dates back to medieval times, when it was first recorded as a variant of the Biblical name 'Hava' which means lively. Others believe that Ava has Germanic roots, coming from the word aval, which means “guarantee.”\n\nSome think it originates from the Latin Avis, meaning “bird\" or \"birdlike.” Ava Gardner is not the only famous Ava out there. There is Ava Allan, who we know from \"True Jackson VP,\" Ava Kolker from \"American Horror Story\" and of course Ava Michelle, the beloved model, actress, and incredibly talented dancer.\n\nLouisa\n\nThis name has been neglected for almost a hundred years! It was most popular in the 1910s. Let's face it, the name Louisa used to be associated with ladies at your parent's bingo club, but maybe it's time to change that. Let's not forget the amazing American novelist, best known as the author of the novel \"Little Women,\" Louisa May Alcott.\n\nThe name originates from the Latin word for warrior, so why not restore the name to its former glory? So besides \"Little Women's\" creator, which other famous Louisa do we know? There's Louisa Adama, a writer, and First Lady, there's Louisa Rose Allen, a singer-songwriter; and there is Louisa Wall, one of the most famous women in the New Zealand Parliament.\n\nGertrude\n\nGertrude is a name we haven't heard in a long, long time! This is no surprise since its heyday was back in the 1880s. While it's not nearly as popular now, it is unique as only 29 girls were named Gertrude in 2021! That's one out of every 61,362 babies born. It is a rare name, and the nickname 'Gertie' is just too adorable!\n\nNow you'll be surprised how many known people were named Gertrude when born, and somewhere along the way, their names changed. Elizabeth Anscombe was originally named Gertrude, Ma Rainey was born Gertrude Pridgett, and Luna Vachon is actually Miss Gertrude.\n\nEsther\n\nEsther is a great name that comes straight out of the Bible but has seen in resurgence since featuring in popular novels and TV shows. One of the most notable was the American actress Esther Williams, who was also a competitive swimmer. The name brings to mind intelligence, unity, and royalty.\n\nPlus, according to census data, the name has been rising in popularity, breaking the top 200 in 2016. Another icon who carries the name Esther is Queen Madonna. In 2004 the pop legend adopted the Hebrew name Esther following her rebellious beliefs and her studying Kabbalah, the Jewish mysticism.\n\nGeorgia\n\nEvery family needs a Georgia; she's strong, she's sassy, and she brings a lot of fun for someone with a classy name. Your little girl can go by Georgie or even Gigi for an adorable nickname! The name was popular in the 1880s, with Georgia O'Keeffe becoming a world-renowned artist. You do not even have to be from the state of Georgia to enjoy this adorable name.\n\nGeorgia means farmer, but we think it has a classier feel than that! Another interesting story about Georgia is Ray Charles. Besides his song being the anthem of the state, there is another speculation that it's related to his brother George, who died when he was just a little kid.\n\nLeona\n\nWhen you think about memorable girl names from the 1800s, you might immediately think of Leona. The name Leona means Lioness, which gives off a sense of self-confidence and strength, which is something we all want for our little girls. While being a unique name, Leona is also quite vintage, Victorian even.\n\nPerhaps that's why we're seeing a resurgence. We have more than one famous Leona that sprung up in modern times. There's the singer Leona Lewis of course (who is probably the most famous one), there is Leona Helmsley and Leona Aglukkaq, and Leona Woods to complete the Leona list.\n\nFreya\n\nNoble, beautiful, and fertile were all words used to describe the Norse goddess, Freya. The name has come a long way since then, with one noted bearer being the explorer and writer Freya Stark who wrote more than two dozen books on her expeditions. Seriously, this name is very niche, and we really like it!\n\nMaybe it's time to bring it back to its former glory. A few other notable Freyas are the gorgeous politician Freya Van den Bossche, the actress Freya Stafford, and Freya von Moltke, the known and appreciated activist who fought for what she believed in until her very last days.\n\nNora\n\nNora may have been forgotten for a while, but now this name is making a comeback, and not just for humans, apparently. There are several towns that have been named Nora, but the name actually comes from Eleanora, which means \"light\" in French. The Arabic variation is usually spelled Noora and also means \"light.\"\n\nOf course, there is also Norah Jones, the sultry songstress who wooed us all in the early 2000s. There is Nora Ephron, who had directed a few films over the years, the super-talented comedian Nora Aunor, and the screenwriter Nora Roberts who wrote \"The MacGregors trilogy.\"\n\nHazel\n\nHazel has been a fashionable name since the turn of the 20th century. More recently, though, parents have been choosing the name for their baby girls, but the name was initially meant for boys. Nowadays, we know this to be a lovely name for a girl. The word itself is derived from an Old English term, spelled hæsel, that refers to a greenish-brown color, but it can also refer to a tree.\n\nThe most famous Hazel we know is Hazel Blears, the former British politician, there is Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman, one of the most famous female tennis players of all time, and there is Hazel Scott, one of the most famous Hazels pianists the world has ever known.\n\nVivienne\n\nAmerica's dream child has been born, and her name is Vivienne. We're referring to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's daughter. Ever since the stars named their daughter Vivienne, the name has been launched back into the limelight. The name chimes grace and elegance and originates from the French word Viviana which means “lively.”\n\nThis a beautiful vintage name that is definitely on the rise and making a comeback. Vivienne Westwood is, with no doubt, the most recognizable Vivienne out there, but besides her, there is the poet Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot, the actress Vivienne Segal, and the Canadian member of the Senate Vivienne Poy.\n\nOlivia\n\nIf you happened to be born in the 1950s, you might have met a few girls named Olivia. Pronounced Oh-LIV-ee-ah, the name derives from the Latin word \"olive,\" and the masculine option, Oliver, is a traditional choice for boys. Lately, the name has been rising up the ranks, with no less than 16,451 babies named Olivia in 2021.\n\nWe bet this trend started with Olivia Wilde but has only increased with the rise of Olivia Rodrigo. In 2022, actress and singer Olivia Newton-John sadly passed away, which brought the name back into the headlines, being such an inspiration to many.\n\nAurora\n\nThis name might be enough to put you in a time machine to your childhood when you watched \"Sleeping Beauty\" for the first time. Aurora is a romantic name that personified an ancient Roman Goddess. The name also refers to the dazzling lights displayed in the Earth's sky called the Aurora Polaris, which is only visible in high-latitude regions like the North and South Poles.\n\nNot to mention the famous Norwegian singer Aurora, who brings a lot of whimsy to this ancient name. In recent years many Tik Tok icons, Instagram stars, and YouTubers have been going by the name of Aurora (not sure if this is their given name); however, Aurora Appice, Aurora Martini, and Aurora Culpo have modernized this name tremendously.\n\nViolet\n\nViolet is sweet and gentle but certainly far from soft-spoken. The name derives from the Victorian Violet, one of the most darling names of colors or flowers. Nowadays, one way to mark a name's cultural impact is whether it's gone viral, and one of the reasons this name has seen such a rapid rise in popularity is that it was picked by glitterati parents Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck.\n\nBut before Jen and Ben adopted the name, there was Violet Jessop, the Titanic survivor, Violet Brinson, who we what on the small screen even till his day, and Violet Oakley, known for being the first female American muralist to acquire public recognition.\n\nAmelia\n\nAmelia derives from a Latin origin, with the root of this name being Amal, which means \"work.\" However, the name refers to industriousness and not simply labor. One of the most notable Amelias out there is, of course, Amelia Earhart, who was an aviation pioneer and author.\n\nNext in line, we have the actress Amelia Bence followed by the notable Amelia Edwards, and to sum up the famous Amelia on our list, we have Iggy Azalea, who was born Amelia Kelly. Modified versions of Amelia have been used for centuries, with these diminutive forms including Amy, Milly, Mel, Emma, and Emily.\n\nCharlotte\n\nCharlotte is THE baby name at the moment, and it is quite easy to see why it is like that. Ever since Charles has been a favorite among royal boys, Charlotte has also evolved into a popular name for princesses and duchesses. Charlotte is the feminine form of the name Charles, which is based on a French word that means \"petite\" or \"free man.\"\n\nCharlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz is the most famous Charlotte in History books. Alongside her, we have the known poet Charlotte Brontë, and in modern times we have the musician, singer-singwriter Charli XCX, who was born Charlotte Aitchison.\n\nAnita\n\nGirls named Anita give off serious swagger you don’t often see; after all, the name means leader full of grace. Ergo, if you want your baby girl to become a leader one day, then the name Anita is a perfect choice. Anita was a popular name in the 1950s but has gradually fallen out of favor; maybe it's time we bring it back.\n\nAnita Baker is, without a doubt, one of the most famous Anitas in the industry. Known for her soulful ballads, especially those from the glamorous 1980s, Baker was a huge name back in the day, and we all remember her as a Grammy winner for \"Sweet Love.\"\n\nGladys\n\nGladys is a name for a girl with artistic sensibilities. Just think of the first Gladys that pops into your head — the name inspires memories of the legendary Motown singer, Gladys Knight, giving it some serious historic appeal. The name peaked in the early 1900s and ranked as the 14th most widespread name; now that's mass appeal!\n\nIt has since fallen out of favor, but we've heard it might be making a comeback soon enough. Another modern famous Gladys must be the artwork Phoebe Buffay on Friends created. Rachel and Monica argue about who won't take the horrific piece of unidentified art home.\n\nMildred\n\nMildred is a dark horse of sorts, little is known about her, but she goes on to succeed unexpectedly. At the middle school lunch table of girls' names, Mildred is the self-assured girl who's involved in every extra-curricular activity you could think of. One of the most notable Mildreds in history wrote the \"Happy Birthday\" song!\n\nOtherwise, the name is free, and anyone with this name will be sure to stand out, even in the entertainment business. On the bold and famous list, we have Babe Didrikson Zaharias, who was born Mildred and grew to become the 10th Greatest North American Athlete of the 20th Century.\n\nBeulah\n\nThere is unmistakable magic to the name Beulah, not to be confused with Buell-er; this is a fair pick for those debutante belles out there. Beulah certainly is a Southern-sounding name that evokes a sense of the roaring '20s, when flappers would dance the Charleston. There was also a famous American inventor who was named Beulah Louise Henry.\n\nShe was so inventive that she got herself the nickname \"Lady Edison.\" The meaning of the name is simply, bride or married. The roots are Hebrew and go back to ancient biblical days when the land intended for the children of Israel was named Beulah — the land that the Israelites would marry.\n\nMyrtle\n\nThe name Myrtle is, allegedly, back. Yes, it might be a quirky name that peaked in the 1880s, but this historical favorite deserves a passage to the future. Derived from the Greek word 'myrtos,' Myrtle was also a beloved ghost in the Harry Potter series.\n\nThis means that Harry Potter fans who are now becoming parents might opt for this name. And the meaning of the word? Well, it means the tree or victory. Either way, it's undoubtedly a unique name, definitely fit for a unique girl, and in these wild days of the 21st century, anything goes. Even Myrtle.\n\nWinifred\n\nThe name Winifred has positioned itself as the hip older sister in the family. This name comes from the Welsh name for \"blessed peace.\" Winifred denotes a quirky vibe and was also the name of the beloved character Winifred Foster from \"Tuck Everlasting.\"\n\nAnd what better nickname is there than Winnie? We think this could also work as a girl's name. Winifred Cullis is the biggest and was the first woman to hold a professorial chair at a medical school, Winifred Bonfils was a significant writer, and Winifred C. Stanley was one of the biggest names in American legal history.\n\nEdith\n\nEdith is a tough name to pin down — either it sounds very chic or very matronly, but this classic name embodies more than that. Many iconic women were named Edith, from presidential wife and political dynamo Edith Roosevelt to the French singer Edith Piaf. Not to mention the first-ever woman to win a Pulitzer Prize in Literature, Edith Wharton.\n\nThese women were graceful, strong, and unapologetically themselves. There's another Edith that we can't get out of our heads. Edith Bunker. This fictional character adorned our screens during the 1970s; she brought her very feminine views and cheerful character to life.\n\nRuth\n\nParents, take note: Ruth is a name that is truly special. The first record of this name appears in the Bible (in fact, it appears in The Book of Ruth, so you can say the name started out with a bang) and proved to be incredibly popular in the 1990s.\n\nIf parents are speculating if Ruth's noble definition still exists today, there is no more renowned example than former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, R.I.P. There is also the astonishing Dinah Washington, who was born by the name Ruth Lee Jones, the wild Ruth Westheimer, one of the greatest therapists and educators in her field, and the legendary Ruth Etting.\n\nMinnie\n\nWhat is there to say about Minnie other than it's a sweet, quirky name with a lot of heart? Walt Disney announced this name's arrival when it was given to one of the brand's most iconic and loved female cartoon characters. Minnie is short for Maximina, Minerva, Guillermina, and Wilhelmina, but it can also stand independently.\n\nSo, which famous Minneys do we know besides Driver? There's the astonishing music composer, Minnie Riperton, the Cuban sportsman Minnie Miñoso (you didn't expect a Minnie man, now did you?), and the wonderful actress Minnie Pearl. Oh, and let's not forget Minerva McGonagall, the most badass character in the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nEthel\n\nLet's get one thing straight: the name Ethel absolutely stands the test of time. The rise in Ethel's popularity can be traced to the American sitcom \"I Love Lucy,\" with Ethel Mertz as the beloved character forever in our hearts. There's also Ethel Kennedy, wife of Robert Kennedy.\n\nThe more historical roots of this name are sourced from the Old English word that means \"noble.\" The full version of Ethal is Etheldreda, and the first baby girl who was titled with the name goes back to about 1840. Ethel Barrymore is considerably the most famous person to carry this name, alongside Ethel Waters and Ethel Smyth.\n\nJane\n\nAs a result of the popular TV by the same moniker, \"Jane the Virgin,\" the name has become a trendy name for parents looking to really make a statement about how much they’re not trying to make a statement. Jane first evolved as a popular name during medieval times when it was used as an alternative to the name Joan.\n\nThe meaning of the name Jane God is gracious and is associated with royalty and prestige. As for the famous Janes in our archive, the list is endless. From Jane Austen to Jane Fonda, Jane Goodall, and Jane Seymour, this name will forever be a favorite among new moms to new baby girls.\n\nMiriam\n\nMiriam is the oldest-known form of Mary. With Hebrew roots, the original meaning is somewhat uncertain, but theories suggest it means \"drop of the sea, bitter, or beloved,\" and can be a sincere way to express your affection to your sweet newborn. More relaxed nicknames: Miri, Mira, and Mimi.\n\nFamous Miriams include Moses' sister (the very first, O.G. Miriam) and the much more recent actress and singer Miriam Shor. Miriam Makeba is high on the list of Miriam the famous, and she brings along with her Miriam Margolyes, tennis player Miriam Oremans and Nervo (duo), who was initially named Miriam.\n\nDaphne\n\nThe name Daphne is of Greek origin, meaning \"laurel tree.\" According to Greek legend, Daphne was a nymph — the daughter of a river god, Peneus. Daphne was eventually saved from Apollo’s romantic obsessions by being transformed into a laurel tree. It is from this story that the plant genus Daphne, which includes the laurel species, gets its name.\n\nWhile Daphne's origins may be Greek, today it's seen as a typically British name — like the heroine of the Netflix romantic drama \"Bridgerton.\" British actress Daphne du Maurier tops the list. American star Daphne Zuniga follows alongside her companion Daphne Rubin-Vega.\n\nJuliet\n\nShouldering most of this name's lasting greatness is its appearance in Shakespeare's play 'Romeo and Juliet.\" Up until now, it's been one of the most romantic names, with the charming Juliet asking, \"What's in a name?\" The French version is spelled Juliette and pronounced with an emphasis on the last syllable.\n\nThe origin is still shrouded in history, but its roots likely include the Latin \"iuvenis,\" meaning \"youthful,\" or Jovis, a form of Jupiter. Now, Romeo's Juliet is not alone, and together with her, there are Juliet Landau, actress Juliet Mills and the late Juliet Prowse are all famous Janes.\n\nCeleste\n\nCeleste is a somewhat quaint name that's finally getting noticed. It's a gentle name with heavenly undertones; many might be reminded of Queen Celeste of Babar's elephant kingdom. If you're looking for a more distinctive variation, consider Celestine or even Celestia. The name is believed to embody grace, purity, and beauty. It was most popular during the 19th century and seems to become increasingly popular over the years.\n\nA notable Celeste is American-British singer Celeste Epiphany Waite. Being such an almost unheard-of name, you'll be surprised how many notable people are named Celeste. There's Celeste A. Wallander, singer Celeste Stoney and the Argentinian actress and model Celeste Cid.\n\nRosemary\n\nRosemary may be known as an evergreen aromatic shrub used as a culinary herb, but it also works well as a name. The name is of Latin origin, meaning \"dew of the sea.\" In ancient lore, Rosemary was draped around Aphrodite when she rose from the sea as it was a symbol for faithful lovers and considered beneficial in strengthening memory.\n\nWhen we hear the name, Rosemary, most of us think of Rosemary's baby; however, many non-fictional Rosemarys are worth mentioning. Rosemary Clooney, Rosemary Casals, and Rosemary Harris are on the top of Rosemary's, and there are plenty more out there who honor the name.\n\nHelena\n\nAt the moment, names don't get more vanguard than Helena. While Helena sounds like a more delicate version of Helen, historically, Helena was the mother of Constantine the Great, who became a saint in the fourth century. Helena is also one of Shakespeare's favorite names, as he used it in both \"All's Well That Ends Well\" and \"A Midsummer's Night Dream.\"\n\nThe first Helena that came to our minds was actress Helena Bonham Carter, but obviously, there are more. Known as Madame Blavatsky, Helena Blavatsky is one of the most notable people who carry the name. Helena Kennedy, Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws, is another famous Helena and, of course, businesswoman Helena Rubinstein.\n\nClementine\n\nIf the song \"Oh, My Darlin'\" still rings too loudly in your ears, you might remember this vintage name. This girl's name comes from French and Latin origin, meaning \"mild, merciful.\" Kate Winslet played Clementine in \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" and supermodel Claudia Schiffer picked Clementine for her daughter, along with Ethan Hawke and his wife, Ryan Hawke.\n\nFor us, Clementine will always be Clementine Churchill, one of the greatest politicians of all times' wife. The legend tells that the phrase, behind every man, there is a great woman supposedly refers to her as she was strong, loving, and supportive like no other.\n\nAnna\n\nThe name Anna sounds classic and simple. This name sprung up from the Hebrew name Hannah, which emerged from the word 'Chanan,' meaning \"grace.\" The name was soon embraced for its ties with the New Testament Mary’s mother, Saint Anna. While Anna is the most common, there are many variations from Annie, Annalise, Anais, and Anika.\n\nThere are too many famous Annas to count, but one of our favorites is definitely Elsa's sister from \"Frozen.\" Queen of England Anne's given name was Anna (with an A), and the same for the present Princess Royal, Anne. Eleanor Roosevelt's birth name was Anne which changed somewhere along the way, and there is Anne Frank, famous for her diary written during her days in hiding.\n\nEmma\n\nEmma carries a deep history while also being simple and contemporary yet distinctly feminine. It's tough to find all these qualities integrated into one name. Originating as a diminutive from the German word that means \"universal,\" the name has been used throughout the centuries as a very royal pick among English families.\n\nWith beautiful and famous actresses like Emma Stone and Emma Watson carrying the name, you really can't go wrong. The name Emma was one of the most popular names given in the U.S.A between 2014 and 2018; however, it has become very popular in Germany (where it originates), Spain, and Poland.\n\nChelsea\n\nPlaces inspire us so much that they have always been a go-to for baby name inspiration. This is where the name Chelsea comes in. Chelsea is a neighborhood in London and New York, two of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. The name first made its debut in the 1880s but rose to popularity several decades later, in the swinging sixties.\n\nFamous Chelseas include Comedian Chelsea Handler and Chelsea Peretti, most known for her work in \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine.\" Chelsea Clinton is a familiar name to every single American and to most people in the world, and actress Chelsea Kane.\n\nKimberly\n\nThe name Kimberly presents itself as a boy's and a girl's name. The English name originates from the phrase \"Cyneburga's meadow.\" In the 1950s, the shortened version of Kim was assigned to boys and girls in roughly equal numbers, though Kimberly has always been more associated with women. With Kim Kardashian's ever-rising popularity, it's no surprise this name is also rising.\n\nOther known Kimberly are Kimberly Perry, Kimberly Elise, and Kimberly Williams-Paisley. The name is ranked 20th on the most popular names according to familyeducation.com, and its popularity has increased. Before we know it, every other girl will soon be Kimberly, Kimi, or just plain Kim.\n\nDiana\n\nThe name Diana is a girl's name of Latin origin, meaning \"divine.\" Diana, the Princess of Wales, inspired many. Even decades later, the name still lingers in our hearts. To us, the name Diana is stunning and still underused. Diana was a Roman goddess in ancient mythology, known as the protector of wild animals, embodying beauty and purity.\n\nBesides the legendary princess, there are more famous Dianas we must mention. Legendary Diana Ross adorns the list alongside Diana Krall and Diana Rigg. The name used to be associated with the 1980s and lost its popularity over the years; however, it is safely climbing back, and a new generation of Dianas is born.\n\nSophia\n\nThose born with this name are beset with a lifelong search for knowledge. Or at least, that's what we'd think with a name that derived from the Greek word for wisdom. The name Sophia has seen a meteoric rise in the ranks, with a sensuous sound and lofty-minded meaning; Sophia's a real winner.\n\nSophia Loren is the poster girl for this name and is a great poster girl. In history, Sophia of Hanover is on top of the list, followed by other Historical Sophias such as Sophia Dorothea of Celle and Sofia Kovalevskaya. Modern-day Sophia, we find Sophia Bush and Sophia Myles.\n\nDaisy\n\nDaisy is wholesome, vibrant, and one of the flower names that blossomed back in full bloom after a century's hibernation. With a colorful literary and pop culture history – Daisy was the innocent girl in the Henry James novella, and then there was \"The Great Gatsby,\" where Daisy was the hero's object of desire.\n\nCelebrities have also taken to the name; Meg Ryan named her kid Daisy True, while Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom have a daughter called Daisy Dove. We can't ignore actress Daisy Ridley or Daisy Marie, two strong, beautiful women. Daisy Fuentes is another well-known television presenter, and the list continues.\n\nRosy\n\nRosy (along with its variant, Rosie) has always come across as hopeful with a pleasant disposition, and the name has been standing on its own for several decades now, all the way back to the days of the musical \"Sweet Rosie O'Grady.\" She is another one of the vibrant nickname-names that are crowding the baby names charts all over the English-speaking world.\n\nThere is no need to introduce Rosie O'Donnell, one of the most famous Rosys in the world. There is also American actress Rosie Perez and English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, followed by British politician Rosies Winterton, to complete the list.\n\nFlorence\n\nWe’re all familiar with the name Florence, but do we know what it means? Historically it's been a unisex name, meaning 'flourishing,' and a place name belonging to the famous Italian city. Although in today's world, Florence is typically more feminine, the last time it appeared in the charts for boys was in 1914.\n\nFlorence Nightingale is probably the first association that comes into mind when considering the name. Nightingale introduced modern nursing as we know it to the world and had a great impact on humanity. Other famous Florence would have to be Florence Griffith Joyner and Florence Henderson.\n\nAgnes\n\nAgnes was the third most common girl's name for four hundred years before being put away in the attic. For those who are curious about this classic name, we would urge using the French pronunciation to spice it up. In French, Agnes is pronounced \"AH-nyez\" — the g-letter being silent, and this way is much more popular across the pond.\n\nMother Teresa's given birth name was Agnes, and Ethel Merman was born Agnes too. Agnes Carlsson was born Agnes and remains Agnes until this very day; the same goes for Agnes Bruckner, who has stuck to her name since the day she was born.\n\nMartha\n\nMartha is a classic American choice. You might also associate the name with Martha Stewart, the American businesswoman who's as crafty as she is clever. But there were so many Martha that are worth mentioning; with our first ever First Lady, the name still has something of a tasteful and traditional image.\n\nThere was also the New Testament Martha; in Scandinavia, the name is linked to many in the royal family. Let's not forget all the various name versions like Marta, Martine, and Martina. Martha Graham is another legendary icon we must mention, being one of the most influential dancers in the industry.\n\nCynthia\n\nIt wasn’t too long ago that the world was first introduced to the name in classical mythology. Eventually, Cynthia was so widespread in the middle of the twentieth century, along with its nickname Cindy, that it fell into a period of plain neglect, but nowadays, it seems ripe and ready for another round.\n\nCindy Crawford is a famous Cynthia we've all looked up to (who knew Cindy wasn't her real name). Cynthia Nixon is another famous Hollywood star who carried the name with her, and she is not the last on the Cynthia list, with Cynthia McKinney and Cynthia Lummis following.\n\nGreta\n\nA vintage name steeped in the old German tradition, the name Greta possesses a strong and stylish vibe while still giving a nod to retro glamour, reminding everyone of the iconic movie star Greta Garbo. We're seeing it rise in the ranks, and the name has not been this popular since the 1970s.\n\nFamous for this name are Greta Gerwig and Greta Thunberg. The origin of the name Greta is German, meaning a pearl, whereas the biblical definition of the name is a child of light. When we think of it, pear and child of light are very much related.\n\nRebecca\n\n‘Tis the season for a renewed look at the name Rebecca. The name goes all the way back to the Biblical account that reached the peak of revived popularity in the 1970s. The name sounds modern without caring too much about what's popular. Becca's shortened form is more trendy nowadays than the folksy-sounding Becky.\n\nRebecca is still a staple for girls' names that start with 'R.' On the list of the fine and famous named Rebecca, we can find Rebecca West, who needs no introduction, Rebecca St. James, the Australian singer-songwriter, and, of course, actress and former model Rebecca Romijn.\n\nDorothy\n\nIn the 1930s, Dorothy may have left Kansas for the Land of Oz, but by the '80s, she arrived in Miami as a Golden Girl. While today some parents are seeking a more classic alternative, Dorothea is also favoring the more flowing, romantic variant.\n\nThis name is likely to make a comeback in the next couple of years, and we can't wait to see the new nicknames it will produce. Faye Dunaway was named Dorothy at birth, and surprisingly, we found a male named Dorothy. D. C. Fontana lived through the wild 50s and 60s and was an honorable screenwriter with a few big successes to his (Dorothy) name.\n\nHenrietta\n\nSince old-fashioned names are making a comeback in these past few years, it's not hard to notice that Henrietta has the same vintage charm as many of the other names on our list. This name first arrived in England in the 1600s with the French princess Henriette Marie, who married King Charles and soon became known as Henrietta Maria.\n\nIn French, the name bears the distinguished meaning of 'keeper of the earth'. Of course, it is also the French form of Henry. Henrietta Barnett is probably the most famous Henrietta around, known for being a great educator in the 19th century.\n\nMagdalena\n\nWe thought finding vintage-inspired names would be tough, but we were sorely mistaken. Considering the treasure trove of names from history, we could not forget to add Magdalena. This sentimental moniker has forever been esteemed with the fallen-yet-redeemed Mary Magdalen.\n\nBut some parents are forward-thinking, and they chose to try and revive the name Magdalene as a standalone, without the added 'Mary'. The name Magdalena is popular in many languages, including German, Spanish, and Slavic. The Greek origin means woman from Magdala, and it has been associated with the catholic church for years. Hard to think about this name in a different context, to be honest.\n\nGuinevere\n\nThis name is given to fiery, feisty, and passionate girls, and we clearly have a place for it in our hearts. As the name of Camelot's beautiful but ill-fated queen, Guinevere, was eclipsed by Jennifer, the more modern Cornish version. Things being what they are, Guinevere could be a great choice name for parents charmed by its historical significance.\n\nFor anyone else, it might just be a bit too much. Being such a harsh name to swallow, Guinevere has many more modern adaptations. Gwen and Gwinnie have become popular nicknames, Guin being a contemporary and casual version of the name.\n\nPhoebe\n\nBefore Phoebe was found in the Bible, written about in Shakespeare's \"As You Like It,\" and featured on the hit TV sitcom \"Friends,\" legend has it that Phoebe was the by-name of Artemis, goddess of hunting and the moon. Phoebe has Greek origins meaning \"radiant, shining one.\"\n\nToday many Phoebes are out there rocking our world, including Phoebe Bridgers and Phoebe Waller-Bridge. We must admit that as a stand-alone, Phoebe is not one of our favorites; however, when the last name suits the first like a glove, we must admit we kind of love it. Pheobe Buffay, you do the name justice.\n\nMolly\n\nThe hunt for vintage-themed girl names uncovered some rare and surprising gems, like the distinctly Irish-sounding name Molly. Down-to-earth and plucky, Molly has been unfailingly popular in America over the past several decades. References to this name include Molly Bloom from the James Joyce novel 'Ulysses' and the Revolutionary War heroine Molly Pitcher. And no one can forget Molly Ringwald, of course.\n\nThere's Molly Shannon and Molly, the man, Meldrum, and we feel this name will climb back up the ladder of success. It is known that many people use Molly as a nickname for Mary; however, it was ranked 18th most popular name in 2021, so it's on the right track.\n\nNancy\n\nAccording to the website nameberry.com, this is one of the few names that originated as a contraction, beginning as \"mine Ancy,\" with Ancy being a nickname for Annis, a Medieval English variation of Anne. The name is one of the main characters in \"Oliver Twist\".\n\nThe name is affectionately remembered by some as Nancy Drew, a girl detective, while youngsters today are watching the \"Fancy Nancy\" series. Many well-known American politicians are named Nancy, with Nancy Pelosi being the most famous one. Nancy Reagan is one that must star on the list, accompanied by Nancy Sinatra. There. We have them all.\n\nEverly\n\nThe truth is that we are not 100% sure where this name came from or what it actually means. Is there anything more endearing than a girl's name that carries a bit of whimsy? Everly is to be playful and quaint, and babies themselves embody the definition of whimsical.\n\nTo us, Everly sounds unique and sweet, with just enough modern cred to make it the next sensation. So, when it comes to famous people named Everly, there aren't too many, and we found Australian actress Everly Sampi. It's ranked 50th on the popular name list, which is not that impressive.\n\nMillicent\n\nOK, we should be honest about this name. Millicent is on the list basically for its nickname. One illustrious Millicent was Millicent Fawcett, who was a champion for women's suffrage from 1897–1919. There, we said it, and now that we all know how much we adore the nickname, Millie, we can also let you know that we love girls' names that are associated with strength.\n\nThe French meaning behind this name is \"brave strength,\" and what lady doesn't want more of that? Many famous Millies are out there, starting with Millie Small and Millie Perkins. Millie Jackson is another well-known name; however - none of the above were born Millicent. They are planes, Millie.\n\nCora\n\nWith many thanks to the hit TV show, \"Downton Abbey,\" the name Cora is experiencing a major resurgence! We, for one, are very happy about that because we love that name and the character. According to its Greek origins, this name means \"maiden,\" but those who have watched the show will probably associate it with the graceful and beautiful matriarch Cora Crawley.\n\nWhat more could you want from an inspirational name? As for it being a notable name, Koko Taylor was born Cora. Cora Skinner adorns the list alongside Cora Sue Collins, who starred on our screens during the 1920s.\n\nIris\n\nNature has always inspired new parents, with many names coming and going as their popularity rises and falls through the ages. Flower names like Iris were pretty popular during the 1930s, but it's also been peppered throughout the 20th century, proving it's a real timeless choice.\n\nIris Apatow, who was born in 2002, is wearing the name loudly and proudly. The meaning of the name is the goddess of the rainbow, sourced from Greek mythology. Some name their daughters Iris after the flower, being soft, elegant, and wonderfully fragrant. Iris Murdoch is another famous Iris and Mary Ford, who was originally named Iris.\n\nCecilia\n\nCecilia is a Welsh name that is seriously underused. Cecilia is a feminine form of Cecil, and this name is perhaps most commonly associated with a Dickens character name in his novel \"Hard Times.\" It has recently become more famous with The Hunger Games series.\n\nCecelia is also an accepted spelling alternative you might want to consider if you'd like to shorten the name to Celia or Cece. Cecilia is very popular in songs too. The Vamps and Shawn Mendez have their version of the song Cecilia, however, Simon and Garfunkel's emotional expression towards Cecilia has to be our favorite.\n\nJoyce\n\nJoyce was a sought-after name in the 1940s, but it saw a slow decline over time, and now it is barely used. Way before that, though, it was surprisingly a boy's name, and the name even has a long history as a surname. Perhaps most notably connected to James Joyce, author of the famous book \"Ulysses\" and \"Finnegans Wake.\"\n\nThe meaning behind Joyce is joyful and merry, so why not name your little bundle of joy just that? Joyce Van Patten is a well-known actress; Joyce Bulifant is known to us all through her role in television and game shows.\n\nElizabeth\n\nWhat makes a good name? Is it universal appeal or its enduring popularity that stands the test of time? Well, in both cases, Elizabeth makes a compelling argument. This name comes from Hebrew origins, which means \"pledged to God\". As a name, Elizabeth has a lot going for it; all-around appeal, a lot of history, and timelessness.\n\nLet's not forget all the nicknames: Lizzie, Eliza, and even Beth. As for famous Elizabeths, the list never ends. The late Queen Elizabeth II has to be first. Then we have Elizabeth Taylor and Elizabeth Gillies, followed by Elizabeth Hurley. We think this kind of made the point.\n\nPenelope\n\nThis name was quietly created in Greek mythology as Penelope was the wife of Odysseus in Homer’s Odyssey. Penelope is a time-honored name that has been jumping up the charts, thanks to the enchanting image of Spanish actress Penelope Cruz and its choice by many celebrities for their newborn daughters.\n\nAnd there's the traditional Penny for a nickname, though we would recommend Nell or Poppy. Like many others, the name's original meaning is a weaver and is found in biblical scrips. In those sources, it stands for 'one who is wise', sprinkling a touch of mystery to this already charming name.\n\nScarlett\n\nFinding the right name for your daughter can be quite the journey. There are so many out there, and they're all gold! But not this one; this one is Scarlett. Originally this was an occupational name for those selling luxury dyed wool during medieval times. But now Scarlett Johanson has done more for the name than any fabric ever could.\n\nYoung Scarlett Esteves sits comfortably on this list, being one of the busiest children in the industry, and Scarlett Bordeaux, the legendary professional wrestler, is not only a famous Scarlett but also one of the most famous sportswomen in the industry.\n\nEleanor\n\nWhile many may assume Eleanor is a variation of Ellen, the name actually emanates from the Provence region of Europe, Aliénor, but that's still debated. Others say it originates from the Germanic name Adenorde, which can be translated to mean \"noble north.\" Big plus: the name Eleanor is quite serious, but it can also have seriously endearing nicknames; Ellie and Nellie or even Nori.\n\nEleanor Holmes Norton opens our fine and famous list of Eleanors. Mrs.Roosevelt, the American honorable first lady during the 1930s, is for sure another notable Eleanore and Eleanor Tomlinson, one of the most appreciated actresses in the industry.\n\nGrace\n\nGrace is derived from the Latin word 'gratia,' which means \"grace.\" This name existed as Gracia during the Middle Ages but wasn't commonly used until Christians adopted it and other Puritan attribute names in the 16th century. If the name sounds a little simple or overused, you can always consider one of its international forms, like the Italian version Graziella or the Spanish Engracia.\n\nGrace Kelly has to open the list; however, many other Gracs are appreciated for yh craft and contribution to culture. Ther's Grace Jones, Grace Hopper, and Grace Slik, who each, in their own way, enriched the name and made it so popular among newborns in the past few years.\n\nLily\n\nTrust us when we say this list is no stranger to floral names, and a name like Lily is a great homage to the elegant fleur-de-lis. Lily is one of the most favored of the delicate century-old floral monikers now making a comeback, thanks to its numerous qualities and characteristics: a cool classiness and a charming sound. Lilies have always been a symbol of purity and innocence.\n\nLily Allen opens the notable Lilly list, who has been in the industry since the day she was born, being the daughter of Keith Allen). Lily Tomlin is next, and Lily Collins, who has become one of the most mentioned names in Hollywood following her adventures in Paris, finalized the Lily legendary people on the list.\n\nElla\n\nWe used to think Ella was short for many names like Gabriella or Marcella; however, we learned that Ella is not short for anything and stands alone as a beautiful name. As many of the names on our list originate from German and English roots, Ella is no different.\n\nThis short but lovely-sounding name means \"all, completely\" or \"fairy maiden.\" In Hebrew, the name literally means \"goddess\". This name sounds equal parts vintage and contemporary, which is probably why it fired up the charts in the new millennium; while it hasn't been used much for a few generations, it's finally back.\n\nAlice\n\nAlice is the darling heroine of modern literature, with \"Alice in Wonderland\" making this name popular in modern times. But it had obviously been a known name long before that. Alice was derived from the Old French name Aalis, which in turn came from the Germanic name Adalhaidis.\n\nAlice is quite unlike traditional girls’ names — for one thing; it's more feminine and delicate sounding than Margaret or Katherine while being more substantive than Emma or Agnes. The most famous Alice we found is rocker Alice Cooper. Cooper's career spans over five decades, and he is known for his outrageous stage performances.\n\nMadelyn\n\nThe name Madelyn– or one of its many variations – has been held by many incredible women all throughout history. Madelyn is a feminine name that can be traced to Hebrew, Greek, and French origins. Along with this soft and delicate name comes a great nickname, Maddy. With such a fun, playful nickname, we suspect this name will rise to the top.\n\nIn 2023 the name Madelyn was ranked 69th on the popularity list, which is eight places higher than what I was in 2022. It seems like people are beginning to go back to their origins and adopt vintage names.\n\nAbigail\n\nWhen it comes to sourcing these names, there is no question that Abigail comes from the Hebrew name Avigail which is derived from the Hebrew root words ab, meaning \"father,\" and g-y-l, meaning \"to rejoice.\" Abigail was also a notable figure in the Bible. With biblical roots and a cute nickname, Abby makes the popularity of this name quite understandable.\n\nAmerican actresses Abigail Breslin and Abigail Spencer are both young women who carry the oldish name to some. So before you start rejecting the name of being ancient, just know it's coming back big time and was ranked 24th in 2022.\n\nMatilda\n\nHighly popular in English-speaking countries, and for good reason! The comeback of this sweet vintage name has been spurred by a bunch of glitterati Matildas, with many celebs favoring this name in recent years, probably because of the charming Roald Dahl heroine Matilda. Not to mention this name also has a selection of great nicknames: there's Tillie, Mattie, and Tilda.\n\n2023 was young Matilda's year; however, the name has been going around for ages. The meaning of the name is Mighty in battle, and it was anglicized from its German origins. It represents strength, wisdom, and determination. Perdecr descriptions for Matilda Lowther, Mecini and Ziegler.\n\nEloise\n\nTo us, Eloise will always be the bossy little girl creating mischief at the Plaza Hotel, but more recently, Eloise jumped back onto the popularity list, possibly thanks in part to the character on the hit TV series \"Lost.\" With French and English origins Eloise means \"healthy.\" There's also the Italian alternative, Eloisa, for added charm.\n\nNicknames might include Lolly, Ellie, or Lola. There are a few famous Eloise that are worth mentioning. Eloise Mumford, known and loved for her role in \"Fifty Shades of Gray\" opens the list, followed by Eloise Smyth, the British beauty who played the role of Flora in \"The Frankenstein Chronicles.\"\n\nMary\n\nThe name Mary is not quite as common as her first impression would make it out to be. Mary is the English version of Maria, which ultimately came from the Hebrew name Miriam. Mary was ranked number one for girls up until the mid-twentieth century, but since then, its many derivatives have become much more common.\n\nPersonally, we think that the name should make a comeback. It's classic and simple. So, when we think of Mary, we obviously think of Mary Poppins. Then we think about Mary-Kate Olsen, Cameron Diaz as 'Mary', and Mary (better known as Meryl) Louise Streep.\n\nRosalee\n\nIt's official, Rosalie has been revived and burst onto the scene since its entry into the list of most-used names in 2020. And as with many on-trend girl names, the creative spellings have also started to roll in, although we are firm believers in sticking to the original. If you chose an uncommon spelling for your kid's name, at least don't get mad when people keep misspelling it.\n\nRosalee or Rosalie is not very common when it comes to celebs; however, we have a few. American actress Rosalie Hale opens the list of the fine and the famous, and tagging along behind is Rosalie Ward. The name is making a comeback; however, there is no clear verdict as to the correct way to spell it.\n\nAubrey\n\nAubrey is a unisex name of French and English roots meaning \"elf ruler.\" The name was a relatively popular choice for boys in England during the Middle Ages; then, the name started rushing up the girls' popularity charts, along with the revived Audrey. After being an exclusively male name, it tipped to female in 1974, probably because of a commercially successful song about a girl named Aubrey released in the 1970s.\n\nOne of the most iconic stars Audrey has to be, no doubt, Audrey Hepburn. Besides her iconic black dress and astonishing star qualities, Hepburn helped bring back the name to people's awareness thanks to the success of the movie \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\"\n\nMargot\n\nMargot was initially derived as a French pet form of Marguerite, which ultimately came from the Greek word for pearl. Other spellings include Margo and Margaux. Nowadays, Margot is an unexpected star once again. After nearly five decades of absence, it bounced back on the charts in 2013 and is steadily on the rise.\n\nWe bet we have Margot Robbie to thank for that. Margot has been popular in many countries, including the long British royal dynasty, with its German roots, and nowadays, it has many versions and pronunciations. Margot Ramsay (not the daughter of) Margot Lee and Margot Kidder help preserve the name and keep it relevant.\n\nNoelle\n\nNoelle is the feminine deviation of Noël, a masculine name that comes from the French word for \"Christmas.\" Making Noelle the perfect name for December babies. For those who want a bit of French flair, they can add the diaeresis over the first E to get a more distinctive Noëlle. This name is not that common, which is why we think it might be a great choice for a winter baby.\n\nNow, if you want to dig deep into the roots of the name, the true meaning is not just 'Christmas\"; it is actually \"The Lord's birthday. Yes, we know Christmas is the lord was born on December 25th; however, it's quite fascinating that someone's birthday got a word in the dictionary.\n\nHolly\n\nJolly Holly has always been a favorite pick for Christmas babies, bringing to mind the symbolic shrub with lush green leaves and radiant red berries. Another name for December babies, Holly is also the flower for this month, so it's also among the perfect names for those born during this time.\n\nThere are too many famous Hollies even to count! As for Hollywood, the name Holly is very much known. Holly Hunter needs no introduction. She was one of the leading actresses back in 1990, and even to this day, she is considered one of the greatest talents of her time.\n\nAnnabelle\n\nThe name Annabelle goes back many years. It has Hebrew origins like many other names on this list, so it can be found in Biblical scripts. Some claim it originates from French. Either way, after years of keeping low, Annabelle is making a comeback, and a new generation of Belles is being born.\n\nIt means beauty and grace, perfectly fitting the woman who carries it. Annabelle Stephenson is probably one of the most popular ones, best known for her role as Sara Munello in the TV show, \"Revenge.\" Many babies who are named Annabelle over time turn into Anna or Bella, however, we prefer sticking to the original version.\n\nBeatrice\n\nThe name Beatrice has Latin roots, meaning blessed and voyager (through life). The British princess Beatrice brought the royal name back to people's awareness, and after a deep downfall in the early 20s, it is now climbing back up and gaining popularity.\n\nThe name also has its Italian version of Beatrix and a Spanish and Portuguese interpretation of Beatriz. So, wherever you go, Beatrice has recognition, meaning, and a story. Most known and famous Beatrices are either historical figures or royal family members. Actress Bebe Neuwirth was born Beatrice, and young American Singer Bea Miller was born Beatrice Annika Miller.\n\nBelle\n\nBelle means beautiful and fair, and it also means \"loved one.\" No matter where you look, this name represents everything you want about a baby. It originated from French projects such as prestige and glamour. Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\" transferred the name from the European continent to the United States.\n\nIn America, it gained popularity ever since the movie was released. The name Belle has become a very popular middle name, too (why not leave it as first?) Tallulah Willis (daughter of) is named Tallulah Belle, Phoebe Cates is Phoebe Belle, and Donna Reed was originally Donna Belle Reed.\n\nOpal\n\nThe name Opal has many stories behind it. Its original meaning is a gem, or precious stone, and widely known for its marvelous colors. The gem symbolizes confidence and faithfulness. Two qualities we all wish our baby girl to have. After a massive drop during the last two decades of the 20th century, the name Opal is gradually becoming more popular.\n\nIt is almost reaching its highs of the 1880s. As for the stars of Hollywood and the iconic figures in our history books, there is American actress Opal Anchel, Opal Alldin, and Opal Kunz, the woman rights activist and the first woman pilot to race a man in a competition.\n\nPatience\n\nFor some reason, the name Patience is more popular in television shows and movies than it is in the real world. In 2004, Halle Berry played the role of Patience Phillips, better known as Catwoman, and in the classic 1946, \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" Patience Munger is one of the plot characters.\n\nThe name definitely projects something calming and something that brings peace and softness, however, what happens when you name your baby girl Patience, and she is everything but chill or patient? Maybe it's a better idea to wait and see your newborn's temper before labeling her for life.\n\nCamilla\n\nBefore we dig deep into the origins and meaning of the name, the UK is the only place in the world where the name has become more popular following the coronation of King Charles and bringing the whole Charles-Diana-Camilla story back to the headlines. At the time, the British people took the Diana-Camilla affair so personally that the name became one of the most hated ones for years. Since then, things have changed.\n\nIt originates from Italy and means \"helper to the priest.\" It comes from the word Camillus, which refers to a young man serving in the church in Ancient Rome. As for Camilla stars, obviously, Queen Camilla is the most famous one; however, we also have Camilla Luddington and Camilla Belle.\n\nRose\n\nThe meaning of this beautiful name is simply a flower. What else could you ask for a name for your new baby girl? The Rose is all about femininity and softness, and it has been one of the most popular names in all traditions, languages, and countries. There are several variations of the name, such as Rosa, Rosy, and Roz.\n\nRose Byrne opens the list of fine and famous Roses. Then there is Rose McGowen and Mclver, who follow. Some consider the name Rose to be old-fashioned and outdated; however, it goes perfectly for baby Rosy, a rebellious teenager who goes by Roz, and a mature adult who uses the original version of Rose. It works every time.\n\nCatherine\n\nBefore we talk about Catherine Zeta-Jones, Catherine Middleton, and Catherine the Great, let's return to this prestige name's roots. It goes back to the 4th century and originates from Latin. It stands for purity and cleanliness; over the years, the name adopted various ways of spelling. There's Catherine and Katherine; it can go either way.\n\nIn the 1990s, Catherine Zeta-Jones was one of the hottest names in the industry, not only for being Michael Dauglas's better half. She is a talented actress with a respectable homage behind her. Catherine Middleton, better known as Princess Kate, has become one of the most influential women, representing modesty and charm.\n\nClara\n\nIf you want a bright and dazzling future for your child, name her Clara, as this is exactly the meaning of the name. It has a cool vintage chic to it, however, doesn't seem to ever go out of date. Clair and Clarissa are variations of this name; however, many European countries still stick to the name's original version.\n\nIt wasn't easy finding celebs or famous Historical people named Clara, however, we did come across Clara McGregor, Clara Alvarado, and Clara Amfo, famously known in the UK as one of the top BBC broadcasters. If you like the name just as much as we do, pay no attention to what people say, and it doesn't matter that there aren't too many Hollywood stars named Clara; it's unique, traditional, and easy to spell.\n\nDelilah\n\nWe first come across the name Delilah in the biblical story of Samson and Delilah. Then it was Tom Jones who couldn't get enough of her during the 1960s, and finally, Plain White T's gave their \"Hey There Delilah\" in 2006. So, as you can see, the name has been around forever, and it doesn't look like it is going anywhere.\n\nIn the United States alone, the name Delilah was ranked 58th, and we have a feeling the name is only going to escalate. In modern days, the name Dalilah has turned into Dahila, which is the name of beautiful flowers, so no matter what you choose, the story behind the name will go perfectly with your newborn.\n\nElise\n\nIf you want to call your new baby girl a French name, we suggest going with Elise. It means God's Promise and has been around since the early Middle Ages. The name is apparently a shorter version of the English name Elizabeth, however, the French refuse to admit this and stick to their version of originality.\n\nThe name has had its ups and downs, hitting the lows during the 1950s with just a little over 1000 new babies being named Elise. A decade ago, the name peaked with more than 2000 new babies turning to their moms when hearing the name Elise.\n\nEmmaline\n\nUp until the early days of 1991, the name Emmaline was almost unheard of in the United States. However, something must have happened back then as it has not stopped gaining popularity, reaching the in the early 2020s with more than 300 new baby girls being named Emmaline. In Latin, the name means \"work,\" however, with all the Emmalines we know, this definition doesn't mean anything.\n\nIn the movie 'The Blue Lagoon,\" the main character's name is Emmaline. Emmeline Katherine Fink, better recognized as Emmy, is one of the leading American television broadcasters. Emmeline Ndongue is a well-known French basketball player. If you ask us, Emmaline is definitely an option.\n\nEve\n\nEve stands for life. It's the name of the first woman mentioned in the bible and originates from the Latin name Eva and the Hebrew name Chava. So, besides the most famous woman in history (and we are not talking about Queen B), Hollywood supplied us with a fair number of celebrity women named after the first woman of humanity.\n\nThere's Eve, the rapper, and Joss Stone, whose real name is Eve. There is Eve Ardan and Eve Torres, and the list goes on and on. The name has positive and strong associations and even has a cute nickname you can use until your Evvy can go back to being Eve.\n\nFaye\n\nAnother French-originated name. It's a short and simple name, however, it symbolizes belief and loyalty, which are anything but simple or small. It comes from the Latin word fides (which is obviously related to fidelity) and, for many years, was one of the most popular names in Europe.\n\nThe name has become very popular amongst fictional characters as we all know Dr. Faye Miller from \"Mad Men,\" Frasiers's Faye Moskowitz, and Faye Dolan in \"That Thing You Do.\" As for the real stars, we have Faye Adams, better known as Fanny Tuell, and Faye Dunaway, an astonishing actress in her own right.\n\nHope\n\nIf you're going for vintage, go for Hope. It means faith and 'desire for fulfillment,' and it's one of the oldest English names we found with roots going back to the word 'hopian', which refers to positive expectations. The name is also a translation of the Greek name Saint Hope.\n\nHope Anderson is one of the most famous American Hopes we found alongside Hope Davis, our pride of Hollywood. At first, you might feel the name sounds too old and too dual, however, we can guarantee that the name Hope will bring exactly what it means with it. It will bring tranquility, ambition, belief, trust, and confidence.\n\nIsabelle\n\nThe name Isabelle is a variation of what started as Elizabeth. It originated from the Hebrew name Elisheba and the Latin version of Jezebel. In 2021, Isabelle was the 7th most popular name in The United States and hit the top five in Italy. In 2022 Virgina crowned the name as its most popular one alongside its diminutive, Bella.\n\nThroughout history, many queens were named Isabella, and even until this very day, royal families have preserved the name, and baby princesses are being named Isabella (Princess Isabella of Denmark, for example). As for commoners like you and I, there's Isabella Acres and Isabella Boylston, one of America's greatest dancers.\n\nIvy\n\nThe beautiful name Ivy is also known as Iva. It is named after a British evergreen climbing plant, representing eternity and fidelity. The Ivy is also associated with the holiday seasons and with Beyonce and Jay Z. It has flourished throughout the centuries and has always kept its glam and prestige.\n\nIn 2012, when baby Blue Ivy Carter was born, the name (Ivy, not Blue) became one of the most popular names that year, and today, more than a decade later, it is still a favorite among newborns. Blue Ivy instantly became the most famous baby in the world, and so did her name.\n\nJosephine\n\nYou would have thought that France would lead the list with the popularity of this name, however, things are not always what they seem. In the United States, the name Josephine is ranked 72nd, and with the nickname of Josie, we are definitely pointing our thumbs up for this.\n\nJosephine Bonaparte is probably the most famous Josephine in the world, known for being Napoleon's consort and the love of his life. She contributed tremendously to his rise to power, and he welcomed her and her two children after he was widowed. The most famous phrase associated with the name is \"Not tonight, Josephine\", however, the origins of this are still unclear.\n\nMia\n\nThe origin of the name Mia is Maria, which is believed to be sourced from the Eygiptian word Mr. It is also known to have Italian and Slavic roots, meaning dear and darling. During the 1960s, the name was very common, however, somewhere along the way, it lost its momentum and rose back to fame only in the late 1990s.\n\nAs for the famous Mias, there is Mia Tyler, daughter of Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler, and Mia Martini, one of Italy's pride, joy, and most famous singers and songwriters. So if you don't want to name your daughter Maria feeling it sounds too old-fashioned, Mia is the best alternative.\n\nLeila\n\nIn 2019 almost 4000 new babies’ named Leila were born. Now, although it sounds just like another beautiful western name (maybe a variation of Lily, or Ilana?), in fact, it originates in Arabic and it means “Night”. Lord Byron's famous poem speaks fondly about Leila, however, the most famous Leila we know, has got to be Erik Clapton’s’ whose song had become an almost anthem of the name.\n\nAs for the fine and famous Leilas in the industry, there is Leila Carmelita Arcieri and Iranian Leila Hatami who may not sound familiar at first, however, she is one of the most influential women in the international film industry."
