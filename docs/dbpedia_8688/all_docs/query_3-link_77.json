        "text": "The X Factor winner will join as a guest investigator on the festive special of the play-a-long singing game show, alongside the celebrity panel of Jimmy Carr, Alison Hammond and Amanda Holden.\n\nThe Christmas special will see the player, hoping to win a cash prize of £10,000, joined by broadcaster Gabby Logan and together they will guess who can and cannot sing from a group of mystery singers standing before them, without hearing them sing a note.\n\nThe celebrity panel will help the player along the way as the singers and imposters take part in a round of festive-themed lip-sync challenges.\n\nLewis, 36, has also teased in the announcement video that she may perform a festive tune during the episode.\n\nDuring the Christmas special, the show’s host Paddy McGuinness asks the singer what her favourite Christmas song to perform is, and Lewis reveals: “I like Oh Holy Night, I like the kind of very intimate Christmas songs.”\n\nMcGuinness asks Carr if he was OK with that selection, to which the comedian replies: “I mean…. Last Christmas is what you want!”\n\nLewis quizzes Carr if that was his song of choice at Christmas, and he jokingly says: “I don’t sing! That’s my gift to everyone.”\n\nThe singer won the third series of The X Factor in 2006 and has since produced five studio albums, which included the hit singles Bleeding Love, Better In Time and Run.\n\nI Can See Your Voice Christmas special will air on BBC One this Christmas."
