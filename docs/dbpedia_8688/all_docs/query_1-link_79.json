        "text": "LEONA Lewis is joining the line-up for X Factor: All Stars.\n\nThe singer became a household name thanks to her victory on The X Factor back in 2006. Here's what she's been up to since…\n\nIs Leona Lewis doing X Factor: All Stars?\n\nIn July 2019, Louis Walsh revealed that Leona would be competing in The X Factor All Stars later this year.\n\nThe judge revealed the exciting news, telling The Mirror: \"I go to Los Angeles on Tuesday, I go to Simon’s house in Malibu, it’s me Simon [Cowell] and Nicole [Scherzinger] and we’re doing the celebrity one.\n\n\"It’s going to be great, and then we do the 'best of' all in one week, all the winners are coming back. Leona's coming back, Alexandra, Shayne, they’re all coming back.\"\n\nLeona competed on the third series of The X Factor in 2006, with her stunning vocals winning her the competition.\n\nLeona won a £1million recording contract with Simon Cowell’s record label, Syco music.\n\nHer winning single was a cover of Kelly Clarkson’s A Moment Like This, which peaked at number one for four weeks on the UK singles chart.\n\nShe will be looking to build on her success with a win in the All Stars version of the show.\n\nOther acts performing will be Jedward and Fleur East.\n\nWhat has Leona Lewis been doing since her X Factor win?\n\nLeona has turned her focus to acting as much as music since her appearance on The X Factor.\n\nShe took on the role of Grizabella in Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats on Broadway in 2016.\n\nAnd in June of the same year she parted ways with Island records before releasing charity single Looking for Home with Dianne Warren for the Vanderpump's Dog Foundation's public service announcement against the Yulin Dog Meat Festival.\n\nIn 2017, Leona signed with modelling agency Wilhelmina Models.\n\nAnd the following year she teamed up with Calum Scott to release a version of You Are the Reason - the song peaked at number 43 in the UK charts.\n\nIn June 2018 she joined forces with rapper Pitbull on the track Amore for the 2018 film Gotti.\n\nThe crooner than performed at the 92nd Annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York and a month later performed One More Sleep on The X Factor in 2018.\n\nThe song then went on to re-enter the UK charts, peaking at number eight.\n\nMost recently the star appeared in six episodes of The Oath in February 2019 and then performed at The Power of Love Gala in March.\n\nAnd in June 2018 she took to the stage alongside Chaka Khan at the Butterfly Ball.\n\nLeona hasn't released a studio album since I Am in 2015, which reached the top 40 internationally including in the US, Spain and Germany as well as the UK.\n\nShe toured the album in 2016 but has not toured since then.\n\nWhat are her biggest hits?\n\nLeona has had three No1 hits in the UK with her debut, A Moment Like This, the follow-up Bleeding Love and Run.\n\nHappy and Better In Time/Footprints In The Sand reached No2 and she has had ten top 10 hits in total.\n\nThe singer also had two No1 albums - Spirit and Echo.\n\nSpirit, which came out in 2007 went 10x platinum in the UK.\n\nIt also became the fourth best selling album of the 2000s.\n\nHas Leona Lewis married Dennis Jauch?\n\nLeona Lewis officially tied the knot to her long-term partner Dennis Jauch in August 2019.\n\nThe pair began dating in 2010 and have kept their relationship relatively private.\n\nThe couple got married in a vegan Buddhist wedding held on singer Sting's Italian estate.\n\nShe wed the 30-year-old US choreographer in front of 180 family members and pals including Sugababes singer Keisha Buchanan and The Voice winner Jermain Jackman, who sang at the ceremony.\n\nLeona told Hello mag: “It was just the most beautiful day, full of love. It was so special to be able to bring together everyone we love. There were a lot of tears.\n\n“The room already had so much good energy and having all the love in there was really powerful.”\n\nThe wedding, which included a vegan menu and wedding cake, was moved inside at the last minute due to a storm which German-born Dennis claimed was a sign from late father Lutz, who died three weeks before.\n\nLeona's previous boyfriend was Lou Al-Chamaa, and she set up a fashion company called LOA Clothing Ltd with him.\n\nWhat is Leona Lewis' background?\n\nLeona Lewis is a 34-year old singer, songwriter and animal welfare campaigner from Islington, London.\n\nShe is most well known for her singing career, but is also a campaigner for World Animal Protection.\n\nThe singer was in romantic comedy musical Walking on Sunshine in 2015, and played Grizabella on Broadway in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cats in 2016.\n\nHer net worth is estimated at $30 million.\n\nWhen does X Factor: All Stars start?\n\nA date is yet to be confirmed for this new spin-off show.\n\nHowever, it is likely to air AFTER X Factor: Celebrity.\n\nWith this in mind it is likely to be some time in November 2019.\n\nThere is no regular X Factor this year as the show has been replaced by these two spin off shows."
