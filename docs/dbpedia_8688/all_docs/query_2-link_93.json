        "text": "Leona Lewis’ flawless and incredible diva voice was evidently made through her first CD, Spirit. The 14 songs sung by this amazing singer left any possible listener in absolute awe of her vocal talents.\n\nAlmost every individual would ask, “Who is Leona Lewis?” when she first came out of X Factor in the year of 2006. However, the moment she opened her mouth was a different story as she conquered every other contestant with her astounding voice.\n\nHowever, the important thing is not necessarily about Leona Lewis herself, but her public announcement of her belief in Christ through her songs, particularly Footprints in the Sand. In an honest sense, many individuals would not believe that she was a Christian due to the fact that the majority of society ‘judges by the cover of a book.’ Or specifically in this case, individuals would not be able to distinguish that she was a Christian because of the fact that she decided to be involved in the secular world of music, whereas, most Christians would decide to be involved in the voluntary aspects of the church, such as being the worship leader.\n\nSaying this, there are many problems that arise from her song, Footprints in the Sand. The first being the fact that there is only one song in her CD reflecting her Christian beliefs, while the majority of her other songs are stories of loves lost and conquered, with allusions to many other divas who are already extremely corrupted in the materialism of this world, such as Whitney Houston, Christina Aguilera, Mariah Carey, etc.\n\nIt is wrong that Lewis created a musical version of one of the most famous Christian fables in a CD composed of secular songs. Lewis’ song, Footprints in the Sand, is basically about an individual who is walking along the beach with the Lord. There are two sets of footprints in the sand—one that belonged to the person, and the other to the Lord. However, as the individual endured through the last scene of his or her life, they looked back at the footprints in the sand and noticed that there were many times along their path of life where there were only one set of footprints—the majority of the time being the lowest and saddest times of that person’s life. This confused individual felt very troubled and asked the Lord about it as they said, “Lord, you said once I decided to follow you, you’d walk with me all the way. But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life there were only one set of footprints. I don’t understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me.” By the conclusion of the poem, the Lord replied, “My son, my precious child, I love you and I would never leave you. During your times of suffering, when you could see only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you.”\n\nThrough Lewis’ song, she really portrayed the poem in the best way possible– through her clear and sympathetic voice shown through her love for music. However, to secularize a poem so symbolic and meaningful ruined the true, genuine feeling for other Christians who were inspired through the incredible poem about the love of God. What is disagreeable with this is that when non-Christians listen to this song they think the person carrying the individual in trouble is not Christ, but someone else such as a boyfriend, friend, girlfriend, or family member. In actuality, many individuals do not know that the most significant person in their lives, other than Christ, is only temporary in life. Without any specific reference in the song about that one person who helps us in time of need, the one who is always there no matter what, and the one who loves us unconditionally– Jesus Christ– the song is meaningless and unfortunately, in this case, secular.\n\nI do, however, have to give credit to Leona Lewis for ‘attempting’ to portray her belief in Christ in a secular world like this. I know that Lewis did not intend to turn a Christian poem into a secular song, but that she wanted to show how much she truly loved Christ. It was merely an act of faith to evangelize to others who did not know Him. However, the way she portrayed her belief in Him was so subtle that the majority of individuals misunderstood the true, underlying meaning to the lyrics. Society’s misunderstood perceptions of this song is the only reason why this ‘supposedly’ Christian song is accepted by all individuals. In the end, Lewis needs to be careful in how she reveals God’s love towards a secular society. Nonetheless, the song is great, the message is amazing, but the way it was portrayed was horrific.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************************************\n\nLYRICS\n\nYou walked with me\n\nFootprints in the sand\n\nAnd helped me understand\n\nWhere I’m going\n\nYou walked with me\n\nWhen I was all alone\n\nWith so much unknown\n\nAlong the way\n\nThat’s when I heard you say\n\nI promise you\n\nI’m always there\n\nWhen your heart is filled with sorrow\n\nAnd despair\n\nAnd I’ll carry you\n\nWhen you need a friend\n\nYou’ll find my footprints in the sand\n\nWhen I’m weary\n\nWell I know you’ll be there\n\nCause I can feel you\n\nWhen you say\n\nI promise you\n\nI’m always there\n\nWhen your heart is filled with sadness and despair\n\nOh, I’ll carry you\n\nWhen you need a friend\n\nYou’ll find my footprints in the sand\n\nWhen your heart is full of sadness and despair\n\nI’ll carry you\n\nWhen you need a friend"
