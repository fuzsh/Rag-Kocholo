        "text": "Leona Lewis has expressed her deep sorrow as she faces the reality that \"life will never be the same\".\n\nThe 'Bleeding Love' singer reached out to her followers on social media to share the heart-wrenching news of a family bereavement. The 39-year-old star revealed earlier this week that her beloved dog Forrest had passed away.\n\nIn a touching Instagram post, Leona posted several photos of her cherished Chihuahua as she honoured his memory. She penned: \"I don't really know where to begin...I'm heartbroken. I had to say goodbye to my little Forrest, my best friend through so many phases of my life.\"\n\nShe continued, reflecting on a previous loss: \"I had only just gotten to the point of being able to talk about the loss of Zion, my beautiful Doberman who passed away 2 years ago. It was only 2 weeks after the birth of Carmel so it was very difficult to process the pain of losing him at that point.\"\n\nLeona further shared how much her two dogs meant to her, saying: \"Forrest and Zion were two of the most precious gifts and I'm so grateful for each day I got to spend with them. My studio companions, my protectors from squirrels, my snuggle buddies, my baby boys.\"\n\nShe concluded with a heartfelt message: \"Life will never be the same without you but I still feel you around me and I know you are with each other laying by a window in that little bit of sunlight you both loved so much. Forever grateful I got to be your earth mama and thank you for opening up my heart with your love.\"\n\nFans were quick to express their heartfelt condolences in the comments. One said: \"Sending all the love in the world and we're all here for you and the family. Take a big hug from your Hopefield family xxx.\"\n\nAnother remarked: \"Two of the best that ever walked this earth, beautiful spirits who are now all around you, D and Carmel wherever you go.\"\n\n\"So sorry gorgeous sending you tons of love Sleep tight little Forrest,\" penned one commenter, while another stated: \"So sorry. People who don't have dogs really don't understand the love and bond we share with these beautiful creatures. Lots of love.\"\n\nLeona shot to fame after winning The X Factor's third series in 2006 and has since then released chart-topping hits including Run, and Better In Time.\n\nShe holds the title of the first British female solo artist to top the charts with eight singles, overtaking Olivia Newton-John's record of seven, reports the Mirror.\n\nLeona's accolades include two MOBO Awards, an MTV Europe Music Award, and two World Music Awards, not forgetting her six BRIT Award nominations and three nods at the Grammy Awards.\n\nShe's recognised for her performance of I See You, the theme of James Cameron's blockbuster Avatar in 2009, and garnered attention in 2016 when she made her Broadway debut as Grizabella in Andrew Lloyd-Webbers iconic musical Cats, taking over from Nicole Scherzinger."
