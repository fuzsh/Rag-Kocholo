        "text": "Leona confirmed she's going to start work on album #3 after her tour in this 4music under the skin interview!. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXPKJa1lm0I . So i thought i'd start a thread about album #3 (Although it probably wont be ready until next year. Anyway what do you guys think leona should do with her next album? Hopefully the record label/ managment learn from there mistakes with the whole Echo era.\n\nAnd she needs to stay as far away as possible from ryan tedder on her next project cause we don't want any more second rate Bleeding Bloody Loves.\n\nRe: Leona Lewis ~ 3rd studio album discussion\n\nI was going to start this, but didn't want to be accused of 'wanting my name on it'! I'm sooooooooo excited.\n\nMistakes were made with Echo. Not Leona's fault. Happy should never have been the lead single, the promotional was/is dire, there shouldn't have been a simultaneous release globally. I expect SyCo to have learned from these mistakes, and to ensure Leona reaches Spirit levels again, which I think she will.\n\nRe: Leona Lewis ~ 3rd studio album discussion\n\nIotV said:\n\nI was going to start this, but didn't want to be accused of 'wanting my name on it'! I'm sooooooooo excited.\n\nMe too!. I hope she takes HUGE risks with this album. She needs to really up her game with album #3 and come back with a cracking lead single.\n\nRe: Leona Lewis ~ 3rd studio album discussion\n\nSugaBoobs said:\n\nIotV said:\n\nI was going to start this, but didn't want to be accused of 'wanting my name on it'!

It has two of my top ten songs ever in it - Broken and I Got You.\n\nRe: Leona Lewis ~ 3rd studio album discussion\n\nI think she needs to make an album with a lot more tempo and pick songs that are more unique, too many songs on Echo merge into one and it sounds samey, even though the songs on their own are very good, you can't appreciate them when they stand together.\n\nShe needs the odd beautiful ballad with massive vocals but more importantly she needs to be more controlled with her voice, not just belt out through every song and sort her diction out, we know she can sing, she doesn't need to be at the top of her range in every song, I actually prefer her voice when she sings lower, so some darker lower songs would be good.\n\nRe: Leona Lewis ~ 3rd studio album discussion\n\nIotV said:\n\nTM said:\n\nEcho as an album was/is really good.\n\nIt wass the promotion that was not planned out properly at all.\n\nI do hope she adds a bit more uptempo songs to the next album though, a la Outta My Head.\n\nEcho's amazing, my favourite album ever.

It's a shame Echo never took off worldwide but that's down to Happy being a crap lead single. Had they gone with I Got You as the lead single then i think things would have turned out so much better for that era.\n\nRe: Leona Lewis ~ 3rd studio album discussion\n\nIotV said:\n\nTM said:\n\nEcho as an album was/is really good.\n\nIt wass the promotion that was not planned out properly at all.\n\nI do hope she adds a bit more uptempo songs to the next album though, a la Outta My Head.\n\nEcho's amazing, my favourite album ever.

Photographs, off Rihanna's album, is fucking awful.\n\nRe: Leona Lewis ~ 3rd studio album discussion\n\nUm so why isn't I Got You exactly doing that well in the charts if it's so good? Also cause of Happy being the lead single? Not sure if it should have been the first single. But as I said I prefer it to Happy.\n\nRe: Leona Lewis ~ 3rd studio album discussion\n\nLittle L said:\n\nUm so why isn't I Got You exactly doing that well in the charts if it's so good?

My heavens witchu (cringe!)...\n\nRe: Leona Lewis ~ 3rd studio album discussion\n\nLittle L said:\n\nUm so why isn't I Got You exactly doing that well in the charts if it's so good?

But as I said I prefer it to Happy.\n\nOne of the reasons being that although the song is great, but the video is not.\n\nShe looks great in it, but its nothing different from what she's done before.\n\nWill.i.am needs to just stick with the BEP and not do any solo projects. Ever."
