Her two albums Spirit and Echo, released in 2007 and 2009 respectively, have collectively sold in excess of 9 million copies worldwide and topped the charts in numerous countries. Lewis's debut tour,The Labyrinth, took place in 2010. As of December 2011, Lewis has sold over 20 million records worldwide. Her third album, Glassheart, is scheduled for release in 2012. It was preceded by the single \"Collide\", which became her seventh top-five hit in the UK.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nLewis was born in the London Borough of Islington, to Aural Josiah \"Joe\" Lewis of Afro-Guyanese descent, and Maria Lewis of Welsh, Irish, and Italian descent.[1][3][4] Her parents enrolled her at the Sylvia Young Theatre School. From there she attended the Italia Conti Academy and the BRIT School, where she learned to play instruments, such as the guitar and piano, in the hope of becoming a singer-songwriter.[5][6] Lewis wrote her first full-length song at the age of 12.[7] She initially trained in opera, but went on to singing jazz and blues, eventually leading to popular music, citingMinnie Riperton, Eva Cassidy and Stevie Wonder as her main influences.[4] After leaving the BRIT School at 17,[4] she took a number of jobs to fund studio time,[8] recording a demo album called Twilight.[9] The album, almost exclusively comprising her own compositions, was recorded under Spiral Music, a production company based in Fulham. \"I tried to secure a record deal by doing things my own way. I worked very hard but I never managed to land a contract\", said Lewis.[10] Other demos were recorded under licence from UEG Entertainment, later included on an album called Best Kept Secret.[11] None of Lewis's demos brought her significant attention, however, and she considered taking a hiatus from her music career to attend university. Then her boyfriend persuaded her to enter The X Factor which subsequently severed her connections with UEG.[12]\n\nMusic career[]\n\n2006: The X Factor[]\n\nMain article: The X Factor (UK series 3)\n\nLewis auditioned for the third series of The X Factor in 2006, singing \"Over the Rainbow\".

The album again went to number one in the UK Albums Chart.

The song became the first track by a UK female to reach number one sinceKim Wilde's \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" in 1987.[39] Lewis's third single, adouble A-side featuring \"Better in Time\" and \"Footprints in the Sand\", was released in the United Kingdom in March 2008, in aid of Sport Relief, and she visited South Africa for the charity.[40] The single reached a peak of number two in the UK singles chart selling over 40,000 copies in its first week of physical release. \"Better in Time\" was released as Lewis's second single in the US, where it peaked at number 11 in the Billboard Hot 100.[41] \"Forgive Me\" was released as Lewis's fifth single in November 2008; it reached number five in the UK.[42] \"Run\" was released as a download-only single in the UK, reaching number one, and becoming the UK's fastest-selling download-only single with 69,244 copies sold in two days.[43] Lewis's last single from Spirit, \"I Will Be\", was released in January 2009,[44] only in North America; it peaked at number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100.

However, a television advert for the album was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, who said in a statement: \"We considered that the claim 'Leona Lewis's new album' misleadingly implied it was the singer's latest recording rather than a new CD of tracks recorded some years ago.\"[63] The album was released to iTunes in standard and deluxe editions, and two EPs, \"Private Party\" and \"Dip Down\"/\"Joy\", were released in September 2009. The first single released from Echo was \"Happy\", which was written by Lewis, Tedder and Evan Bogart and produced by Tedder.[64] The single was released on 15 September 2009,[65][66] peaking at number two in the UK,[67] and reaching the top ten in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Japan and Switzerland.[68] Lewis also recorded the theme song for the 2009 science fiction film Avatar, directed by James Cameron.[69] The song, \"I See You (Theme from Avatar)\", was written by James Horner and Simon Franglen.

However, in June 2012, it was announced that it will be released in October 2012.[82] The album, and all future releases from Lewis, will be released on the RCA Records brand due to RCA Music Group announcing in October 2011 that it was disbanding J Records along with Arista Records and Jive Records.[84][85]\n\nLewis suggested the album would be \"a bit different from what people have heard\" from her before, adding that she planned to \"go in and create and just see what happens\".[86] Lewis later described the album as \"more progressive\", \"more eclectic\", \"more uptempo\" and \"a bit darker\".[87] Reports suggested that the album had taken a dubstep direction, with songwriters asked to submit dance songs and no ballads.[88] In June 2011, when asked about the upcoming album, Lewis described it as \"energetic, deep, [and] unique\". She also commented that it would have a darker tone and that she would be putting her \"heart into [her] lyrics\". She cited Tracy Chapman, Kate Bush and Tears for Fears as the album's primary influences.[89] For the album, Lewis worked with numerous writers and producers including Ammo, Jonas Quant,Chuck Harmony, Claude Kelly, Ryan Tedder, Fraser T. Smith, Al Shux, Steve Robson,[90] Dallas Austin,[91] Rico Love[92]and Ne-Yo.[93][94]\n\n\"Collide\" was the first single from Glassheart.

She said, \"when I was growing up I used to listen to Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, those kind of big powerful kind of singers so that influences a lot my music and a lot of the songs I like to sing.\"[112]\n\nOther activities[]\n\nIn October 2008, The Times reported that Lewis had turned down a seven-figure sum from Mohamed Al Fayed to open aHarrods sale. Lewis commented that she turned down the deal on the grounds that Harrods is the only UK department store which continues to stock clothing made from animal fur.[113] \"It wasn't a million pounds that I was offered, as the papers reported, but even if it had been, I still would have turned it down.\"[114] \"I got a lot of flak for that. There were people who said I should have done it and given the money to charity, but that would have been such a contradiction.\"[115] She announced in October 2008 that she was in the \"bargaining period\" of launching her own ethical line of accessories through Topshop,[4][113] and that she was in the late stages of releasing her own perfume for Europe.[116] Her perfume, Leona Lewis, was launched by LR in July 2009.[117] In 2010, she set up a fashion company with her then boyfriend, Lou Al-Chamaa, called LOA Clothing Ltd.[118]\n\nLewis signed a book deal in January 2009 to release an illustrated autobiography in October 2009.
