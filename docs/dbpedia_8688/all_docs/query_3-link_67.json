        "text": "The Masked Singer had a bonus judge for the 2023 Christmas special - and fans were loving her.\n\nLeona Lewis was a surprise guest on the madcap ITV show - and opened the show with a rendition of her festive song One More Sleep. The contestants of the 2023 special, which were dressed as a sprout, a partridge, a reindeer and some Christmas decorations, were singing around Leona - while she performed from atop a tree.\n\nThe 38-year-old singer then took a seat alongside the panel of regular judges; Davina McCall, 56, Jonathan Ross, 63, Rita Ora, 33, and 35-year-old Mo Gilligan Joel Dommett, 38, were also on hand to preside over the special episode of the singing competition which saw a number of stars in disguise singing for success.\n\nBut Leona was the real winner of the night - as fans of the ITV show flocked to social media to express their love for the star. Viewers were amazed by Leona’s singing skills and her insightful guesses when she was on the panel.\n\nOne fan on X/Twitter gushed: “Omg yay Leona looks gorgeous.\" Another wrote: \"You look incredible as always.\" A third person stated: \"Leona Lewis is actually so beautiful.\" And a further fan agreed, writing: \"That colour looks gorgeous on you.\"\n\nThe winner on the night was Ainsley Harriott - who was unmasked beneath the Partridge (In A Pear Tree) costume. Explaining his joy at taking part, the 66-year-old TV chef said: \"The big hint was Can't Cook, Won't Cook... I loved it. The build-up, learning the songs. I had a great, great day.\"\n\nCarol Vorderman was the runner-up - having performed while disguised as a reindeer. She feared her accent would give her away, telling the panel after she was unmasked: \"I've loved every second. I thought the Welsh accent [could have given me away] and they said 'disguise your accent' and I can do a very good North Welsh accent.\"\n\nJulian Clary, 64, and Tony Robinson, 77, were the other two celebs taking part - with the comedians dressed as decorations and a sprout respectively. The new season of The Masked Singer is due to kick off on Saturday night.\n\nShow bosses have already claimed they have the biggest names yet hidden beneath the extravagant costumes for the upcoming fifth season of the show. Panellist Rita said: \"The talent is fantastic. The voices on this series are the best I’ve ever heard and the personalities are so amazing.”\n\nWhile host Joel Dommett has also begged up the talent, and added: \"We’ve definitely got some of the best vocalists we’ve ever had on the show. I really do feel like we’ve got some of the best we’ve ever had.\" A number of high profile Brits have won the show in the past - with Girls Aloud star Nicola Roberts winning the first season, chart-topper Joss Stone winning the second, Australian singer and actress Natalie Imbruglia bagging the third season crown, and Busted's Charlie Simpson winning the fourth."
