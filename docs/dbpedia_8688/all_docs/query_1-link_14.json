        "text": "Re: Leona Lewis - 5th Album (2015)\n\nInterested to know how her voice was and how she's using it. I'd been worried about it for a while. Is she sounding stronger again?\n\nHer voice was insane, she hit some very high falsetto notes and she was belting throughout every song.\n\nDid she not perform any of her old tracks?\n\nAnd what's the point of that???\n\n---\n\nReally though, Fire (Under My Feet) is a smash hit. I Got You is a also single worthy (I Am too) but FUMF is the best choice. The ending of FUMF shits on every single she has done >>>>\n\nRe: Leona Lewis - 5th Album (2015)\n\nAnd if I Got You is the song from the Instagram clip, I want that as a single but will she really have another single with the same name?\n\nThat's my thought too. If the new I Got You is as good as everyone is saying and destined to be a single it will be very confusing, especially for radio programmers. Even though the original didn't set the charts on fire it did go top 10 on radio airplay in the UK and still gets played from time to time. They really should have named it something else.\n\nThat niggle aside I'm very excited by everything I've heard. Dying to hear Fire in full now - hopefully not too long to go."
