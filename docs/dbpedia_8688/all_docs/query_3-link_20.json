        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning And History Of Leona\n\nLeona is a name that has Latin and French origins. It means ‘lion,’ ‘thunder,’ or ‘lioness.’ Another interpretation of the name Leona is that it is derived from the Latin word Leo. Another meaning of the name is associated with the symbolism of a lion and is ‘brave-hearted.’ The French version of the name Leona is Léonie, which is very popular in parts of Europe. Leona is the feminine version of the name Leon, which, in turn, is derived from the Greek word ‘leon,’ meaning lion. The Latin equivalent of this Greek word is Leo, and therefore, since they have the same meaning, the two names are interchangeable.\n\nThe name Leona was popular in England during the Middle Ages. It was also a common name among those that followed Judaism. The name from which Leona is derived, Leon, is popular among the Jews because it is mentioned in the book of Genesis, verse 49:9. Jacob talks to his sons in this passage. When referring to his fourth son Judah, he tells him that he is the ‘lion’s cub’ and has been uplifted from the lowly status of prey. Jerusalem was the capital of the kingdom of Judah, which was ruled by the royal line of David. This rendered the symbol of the Lion essential among the Jews. Another person credited for increasing the popularity of the name is King Leonidas I, the king of Sparta, and he was also believed to be the descendant of the Greek hero Hercules.\n\nThe name Leona can be pronounced ‘Lee-OH-nǝ.’ Variations of Leona include Leon, Lena, Lona, Leone, Leong, Leola, Leonarda, Lyon, and Leonie. Leona can have pet names like Lee, Leenie, Ona, Leeona, Leonie, Ownie, and Leeowna.\n\nIn the world of fictional characters, a memorable persona is Leona Heidern. She is a fictional video game character from The King of Fighters series. Leaky Leona is from the kid’s TV series, Codename: Kids Next Door.
