        "text": "The problem with Leona is she is very much a one trick pony\n\nIt's interesting as I feel the same way about the aforementioned Adele. I liked her first couple of albums but she bores me to tears at this point, it is the same song over and over again to my ears especially in terms of the actual lyrical/storytelling content.\n\nI do agree with those who say Leona's music wasn't varied enough, though. She tried something a bit different with Glassheart but that album bombed, which I thought was a shame as I personally really liked it and the slightly darker edge to her pop vibe that it potrayed. But I thought I Am was absolutel awful, sounded like it was made for pennies in someone's basement with the problem I have with Adele - the same song being sung over and over except instead of love songs it was Leona singing about how she was making it on her own in the wake of splitting with Syco.\n\nAs someone who likes Leona's voice, or at least what it used to be because there has been something happen for the worst for sure with her vocals, I do think it's a shame how her career has turned out. She seems more interested in being an influencer if her Instagram is anything to by. I guess as long as she's happy but I wonder if she'd come along a few years earlier and had a better manager whether she'd have been much bigger. Upon Bleeding Love being released there was buzz that she was the next Mariah. It's been weird to go from that level of hype to where we are now but the music industry is always so unpredictable with who succeeds long term and who doesn't.\n\nI’m going to say something controversial but in my opinion, I don’t think she was ever as great as she was made out to be. The X Factor back in those days was constantly banging on about finding a superstar but they didn’t find one in the first series, and all they got from the second series was Shayne Ward, who although he was good, didn’t have success in the U.S and other territories. They needed a star in order to sell the format of the show to other countries. I’m not saying Leona wasn’t good…she undoubtedly has a fantastic voice, but it’s not up there with the greats which is what they tried to shove down our throats. She was a very, very good singer but nowhere near as good as they made her out to be. She also never had “IT”. She was lovely, but as an artist she was pretty uninteresting. Most seasons of The Voice U.S have singers that would wipe the floor with Leona.\n\nI would recommend people listen to The Diary of A Ceo…the most recent episode features Simon Cowell. He doesn’t care about any of the people he signs and that’s very clear. He says his biggest regret is not owning the name “One Direction” as if he had it then it would give him the rights to do an animation etc. Pretty much says it all really."
