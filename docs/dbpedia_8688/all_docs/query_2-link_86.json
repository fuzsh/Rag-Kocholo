        "text": "Singer Leona Lewis has welcomed her first child, a baby girl, with husband Dennis Jauch.\n\nThey have named their newborn Carmel, which means garden or orchard, with the middle name Allegra meaning joyful or lively.\n\nThe X-Factor winner announced the birth on Instagram with a picture of her and her husband’s hands clasped over their newborn.\n\nThe couple met in 2010 when he performed as a backup dancer on her tour, and the pair married in July 2019.\n\n“And then there were three – Our little Carmel Allegra arrived 22.7.22,” she wrote.\n\nThe 36-year-old announced her pregnancy at the end of March with a picture of her proudly cradling her baby bump.\n\nLeona suffers from Hashimoto’s disease, an autoimmune disorder characterised by hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid.\n\nSymptoms include gaining weight, tiredness and feelings of depression. The disease is usually treated by taking hormone tablets.\n\nLeona has previously spoken about how it has affected her pregnancy, saying: “I had a really challenging first trimester, I’ll share more at some point for anyone who is going through the same. But I was severely ill and unable to leave the house. So promised myself when I could get out I would spend more time in nature.”\n\nThe singer had previously spoken to Stella magazine adopting a child, saying “I do want children, but Dennis and I have also talked about adopting. My mum grew up in a children's home. No one adopted her as a child, and I would very much like to adopt.”\n\nShe continued “But I'm still figuring things out. If it was up to my husband, we would have had kids yesterday.”"
