        "text": "Leona Lewis, singer\n\nI was doing gigs and studio work, anything to get a record deal. At one point, I won a national karaoke competition held by Yates’s Wine Lodge. The prize was £10,000 and it was like a pub version of The X Factor. So when a chance at the real thing came along, I was ready to try that as well.\n\nI auditioned singing Eva Cassidy’s version of Somewhere Over the Rainbow. My cousin had just passed away, so I sang it in her memory and poured everything into it. Progressing through The X Factor put me in this weird bubble: hardly seeing family or friends and already being recognised in the street. I was 19, came from Hackney in east London, and winning the final seemed a pipe dream. When it happened it felt like an out-of-body experience. After winning, I had to sing for Clive Davis. I kept thinking: “This man launched Whitney Houston!” She was one of my all-time heroes.\n\nSimon Cowell mentored me, picking songs and arrangements. We had a few disputes but he shared my vision of who I wanted to be. When I did a showcase gig in LA, I was so nervous I was sick – then I had to go on stage and perform. I vaguely remember meeting songwriters and producers, but I know exactly how I felt when I heard a demo of Bleeding Love. I thought: “This song could have been written for me.” It had a Prince vibe and I just kept playing it over and over.\n\nRyan Tedder, who wrote the song, is a great producer – as well as being the lead singer of OneRepublic. So whenever he said, “Why don’t you try this?”, he was able to actually sing what he meant. I could relate to the song because Ryan can write like a teenage girl. Just before Bleeding Love, I had had a really bad breakup. I thought of that while I was singing.\n\nThe song came out a year after I won The X Factor. I was worried people might have forgotten me, but the show had such a high profile back then – and YouTube was blowing up, too. The song became so huge [topping the charts in 35 countries] I still can’t explain it. Bleeding Love just seemed to connect with people – and they wanted to hear it again and again.\n\nRyan Tedder, songwriter and producer\n\nIn my 20s, I wrote and produced for Jennifer Lopez. After that, the phone didn’t stop ringing. I actually wrote Bleeding Love for the American singer and actor Jesse McCartney. I’d done a couple of hits with him and he wanted to try something different.\n\nWhenever I don’t know what to write, I ask myself: “What would Prince do?” I was in my apartment and started playing organ chords. Even the song’s distorted drums are Prince-like. I soon had the verse, the melody and the opening lyrics: “Closed off from love, I didn’t need the pain / Once or twice was enough, and it was all in vain / Time starts to pass, before you know it you’re frozen.” I’d been thinking about When Doves Cry or Nothing Compares 2 U. I wanted to write a song that was about love but devastating, so thought about breakups that had crushed me in college.\n\nI finished the song with Jesse and we came up with the phrase Bleeding Love in the studio. I thought it was the best song I’d ever written, but I got a call from Jesse’s A&R man telling me it wouldn’t make his album. “I don’t personally think the song is a hit,” he said. I was furious and thought: “Either he’s wrong or I need a new job.”\n\nTwo months later, I was at Leona’s showcase at the Beverly Hilton alongside every writer and producer in the business. I was an up-and-coming nobody, but the moment I heard Leona’s voice, I thought Bleeding Love would be perfect for her. Simon Cowell and Clive Davis both loved the version I’d done with Jesse, so I re-did it with Leona and spent days crafting the strings. People told me that halving the tempo in the middle broke all the rules of songwriting."
