Many of whom have been able to capture various generations’ imagination over the years and inspire countless different adaptations.

The story revolves around the character of Connie, a fairly typical 15-year-old teenage girl, who comes to be confronted with a dangerous situation. This story and the character of Connie were particularly interesting and engrossing to me. As Oates illustrates Connie’s character and her motivations, I was…\n\nLewis Carroll was an English logician, mathematician, an ordained minister, a photographer and a writer best known for Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.

In what follows I will argue that nonsense is significant, especially in children’s literature, as it is a useful tool for education, and promotes individuality of thoughts. The use of nonsense in literature challenges rules and it allows for the brain to think outside of the restricted boundaries of teaching, which…\n\nIn one of Lewis Carroll’s books “Alice in Wonderland” a character in his book says,“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?''That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat. This quote means each time you make a choice you are going down a path and it’s your choice on which path you want to take. You decide how much you want to grow from now. This quote relates to the novel “outsiders” because the people in outsiders made their own choices, they decided…\n\nZeenat Adams Bolivar Comp 10 June 10, 2016 Doping in Sports In the 2012 London Olympic Games, more than half of the athletes were disqualified for taking banned substances.

Medieval homes are a community in the sense that a household not only contained a nuclear family, but apprentices, craftsmen, and domestics as well, that operate as a family unit. Lewis Mumford illustrates the function of a medieval household through this quote “The members ate together at the same table, worked in the same rooms, slept in the same or common hall, converted at night into dormitories, joined in the family…\n\nZootopia is about a bunny, Judy Hopps, who struggles to fit into the police force. She quickly discovers that Zootopia is not quite what she imagined. Ironically, she partners up with a fox, Nick Wilde, who stubbornly creates conflict between the two of them.
