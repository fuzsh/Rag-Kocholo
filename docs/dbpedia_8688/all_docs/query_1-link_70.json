        "text": "Post by Player211 on\n\nwww.leonalewismusic.co.uk/perezhilton/\n\nThis is the first single from X Factor winner, Leona Lewis. As you know, she has been incredibly hyped since winning the competition by Simon Cowell and Clive Davis, and has even gained comparisons to early Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey.\n\nI thought she was overrated on X Factor and while I'm still not sure if I'm ready to annoint her as the next Mariah Carey or being Whitney Houston level great, I have to say, she has delivered with this record.\n\nThis song sounds a bit dated, like a 90's record, but the quality of it is excellent. She sounds amazing and the lyrics are passionate and well put together. The production is done by Ryan Tedder, and he certainly delivers the goods.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how this performs on pop radio, but it should do very well on AC.\n\nPost by blurple on\n\nHere are the lyrics from a youtube vid of the song:\n\nClosed off from love\n\nI didn't need the pain\n\nOnce or twice was enough\n\nAnd it was all in vain\n\nTime starts to pass\n\nBefore you know it you're frozen\n\nSomething happened\n\nFor the very first time with you\n\nMy heart melts into the ground\n\nFound something true\n\nAnd everyone's looking round\n\nThinking I'm going crazy\n\nBut I don't care what they say\n\nI'm in love with you\n\nThey try to pull me away\n\nBut they don't know the truth\n\nMy heart's crippled by the pain\n\nThat I keep on causing\n\nYou cut me open and I\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nI keep bleeding\n\nI keep, keep bleeding love\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nYou cut me open\n\nTrying hard not to hear\n\nBut they talk so loud\n\nTheir piercing sounds fill my ears\n\nTry to fill me with doubt\n\nYet I know that the goal\n\nIs to keep me from falling\n\nBut nothing's greater\n\nThan the race to come in your embrace\n\nAnd in this world of loneliness\n\nI see your face\n\nYet everyone around me\n\nThinks that I'm going crazy, baby, baby\n\nBut I don't care what they say\n\nI'm in love with you\n\nThey try to pull me away\n\nBut they don't know the truth\n\nMy heart's crippled by the pain\n\nThat I keep on causing\n\nYou cut me open and I\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nI keep bleeding\n\nI keep, keep bleeding love\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nYou cut me open\n\nAnd it's draining all of me\n\nOh they find it hard to believe\n\nI'll be wearing these scars\n\nFor everyone to see\n\nI don't care what they say\n\nI'm in love with you\n\nThey try to pull me away\n\nBut they don't know the truth\n\nMy heart's crippled by the pain\n\nThat I keep on causing\n\nYou cut me open and I\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nI keep bleeding\n\nI keep, keep bleeding love\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nYou cut me open and I\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nI keep bleeding\n\nI keep, keep bleeding love\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nYou cut me open and I\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love"
