        "text": "Born in London, Lewis, 38, went to stage school at the age of six. After winning The X Factor, she released her debut album, Spirit, in 2007. Her song Bleeding Love was No 1 in 35 countries and became 2008’s bestselling single worldwide. In 2009, she sang I See You, the theme for the film Avatar. Nominated for three Grammys and six Brits, she has won Mobo, MTV and World Music awards. This year, she celebrates the 10th anniversary of her album Christmas, With Love, which gave her the festive hit One More Sleep. She is married, with a daughter, and lives between London and Los Angeles.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nSpiders.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nI can be a people-pleaser, to the detriment of my own needs sometimes.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in others?\n\nCruelty to animals or children.\n\nDescribe yourself in three words\n\nSensitive, kind, silly.\n\nWhat would your superpower be?\n\nTo see into people’s souls.\n\nIf you could bring something extinct back to life, what would you choose?\n\nDinosaurs – just the ones that eat leaves.\n\nWhat is your most unappealing habit?\n\nI don’t do it that much any more, but I get strands of my hair and wrap them around my lip. It’s really weird.\n\nWhat scares you about getting older?\n\nHaving regrets.\n\nWho is your celebrity crush?\n\nJason Momoa.\n\nWhich book are you ashamed not to have read?\n\nProbably all of them because I am not big into English literature. I read a lot of self-improvement books.\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were growing up?\n\nA singer.\n\nWhat is the worst thing anyone’s ever said to you?\n\nIt happened when I was younger, somewhere outside London. We were on bikes, and this older girl pulled up and said something racist that I won’t repeat. I will never forget that, because it was the first time, and I was like, “Oh, I am feeling different from everyone around me right now”.\n\nWhat does love feel like?\n\nSelfless and open, freeing.\n\nHave you ever said ‘I love you’ without meaning it?\n\nI don’t say it unless I mean it.\n\nWhich words or phrases do you most overuse?\n\nI say “like” a lot. Sometimes I listen back to myself and I’m like – I just said it – I’m like – and I just said it again. I can’t help saying it!\n\nWhat is the worst job you’ve ever done?\n\nI quite enjoyed all my retail jobs (I worked in H&M and Gap), but the worst times were the sale periods. The summer sales – awful.\n\nIf you could edit your past, what would you change?\n\nI would tell myself to stop being such a worrier.\n\nIf not yourself, who would you most like to be?\n\nA man for a day. I wouldn’t mind seeing the world through a man’s eyes and how differently I would be treated.\n\nWhat keeps you awake at night?\n\nThinking about all the children that are affected by all the wars that are going on right now.\n\nWhat is the most important lesson life has taught you?\n\nNothing’s guaranteed and things change in an instant, and to get used to that and stay in the moment."
