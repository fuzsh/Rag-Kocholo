        "text": "Leona Lewis is officially a mom! On July 22, the \"Bleeding Love\" singer and her husband, Dennis Jauch, welcomed their first child, a baby girl. \"And then there were three,\" Lewis captioned a photo of herself cradling the newborn on Instagram on Tuesday. In the photo, Lewis and Jauch join hands over their daughter's stomach as she snuggles up to her mom in a pink onesie. In the same post, Lewis also announced the baby's name. \"Our little Carmel Allegra arrived 22.7.22,\" she wrote.\n\nWhile most of the baby's face is obscured, Lewis did share a glimpse at her daughter's nose and mouth, sparking a flurry of excitement from friends and family in the comments section. \"Beyond happy for you my wonderful friends @leonalewis @dennisjauch,\" Erika Marosi wrote. \"What a beautiful exciting blessing!!! Love you guys! Congratulations.\" Celebrity friends of the couple also chimed in to celebrate the exciting news. \"Congrats, Leonaaa!!!\" singer Keri Hilson wrote, followed by a \"CONGRATS\" from Michelle Visage and \"Omgoodnesssss❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ congratulations my loves!\" from actor Zulay Henao. \"Congrats to my fam @leonalewis and @dennisjauch,\" singer Autumn Rowe added.\n\nJauch, a dancer and choreographer, and Lewis first met in 2010 while working together on the \"Better in Time\" singer's \"The Labyrinth\" tour. Rumors later began circulating that the pair were dating. In 2012, Jauch and Lewis briefly broke up, according to People, before rekindling their romance a few months later. On Nov. 28, 2018, the couple's eight-year anniversary, Lewis announced their engagement, and they were married in July 2019 at an Italian estate. \"It was so special to be able to bring together everyone we love,\" Lewis said of the wedding in Hello! magazine. \"There were a lot of tears.\"\n\nSince announcing her pregnancy on Instagram on March 23, Lewis has shared multiple photos of her pregnancy journey, eagerly anticipating the arrival of her baby girl. \"Can't wait to meet you this summer,\" she captioned her initial pregnancy announcement. Now that Carmel has arrived, we expect the couple will share even more photos of the adorable baby."
