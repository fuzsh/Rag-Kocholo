I'm back after lurking for 4 years, ha.\n\nHere's a snippet from a Jesse McCartney interview from a couple days ago where he talks about writing BL and briefly talks about the Tiesto/Karol G collab sampling the song. The interviewer shades Leona and calls her a one-hit-wonder, which is arguable in America (where the interview is) at least.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ZachSangShow/videos/jesse-mccartney-on-writing-bleeding-love-for-leona-lewis/332835949803241/\n\nI know he ultimately says he‚Äôs grateful/wouldn‚Äôt change a thing, but I think it‚Äôs pretty dismissive of him to underplay Leona‚Äôs role in that song being huge. That ‚Äúone hit wonder‚Äù who no one knew is what keeps him fed as the interviewer points out. Maybe he gets asked about this all the time and so he is understandably fatigued by the question, but I‚Äôm not a fan of the ‚Äúthank you to everyone who made this song possible except the actual singer‚Äù.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong he was nice about Leona but it just rubs me the wrong way that he doesn‚Äôt seem totally convinced it was a hit because of her and not in spite of her. Yes she wasn‚Äôt a mega star but for anyone who was watching the UK pop scene at the time there was a huge appetite for a singer that had the voice and style she did, and she had millions of people interested to see what she would do next after X Factor. Simon also had big influence in the US/international market and voila you had all the ingredients for a mega hit.\n\nBL is a good song but I‚Äôm not convinced that it would have been as big as it was if it was sung by someone even more famous than her at the time, though I appreciate it certainly wouldn‚Äôt feel that way to a US audience."
