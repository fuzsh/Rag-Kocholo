        "text": "I quite like Leona (pr. LEH-o-nah). I live in Croatia and 'L' names are VERY popular here and have been for the past 10-15 years. I have met 3-4 little Leonas and many more boys named Leon. There is also a popular actress here named Leona, she's in her early 30s. It's one of those 'L' names that was way sparingly used for the past 40-ish years, but became more popular with the latest vogue (like Larisa, Leonarda, Lana).\n\nThis message was edited 10/26/2009, 2:33 PM\n\nLeona (pro. lee-OWN-ah) was my great grandmother's middle name (full name was Lottie Leona) and it is in my top ten for that purpose. I also like it because it's \"older\" and I prefer names that teeter on old fashioned :) My second thought is that of Leona Lewis but my grandmother was born WAY before her time so in my opinion the singer's name is null and void. I am from the southern U.S. ETA - thought I might add this after reading Pie's response - I am white as was my grandmother ;) though I'm not sure what race has anything to do with a name.\n\nThis message was edited 10/26/2009, 11:10 AM\n\nI love the name. I also love Leonora and Nora and I like Leonie too. I live in Sweden.\n\nThis message was edited 10/26/2009, 3:32 AM\n\nI love Leona. It sounds kind of funky and smart but also with a touch of rural. In a way it reminds me of a more subtle companion to one of those retro demure names that are popping up all over like Henry, Lillian, Clementine, and Emmeline. Except even if it has a similar feel I don't think Leona would catch on in the same way. It maybe doesn't have the same romantic sense to it. Leona always reminds me of bluegrass or Americana music. It is one of a very tiny number of names that gives me such a specific picture. :-) I am from northern Michigan.\n\nThis message was edited 10/25/2009, 5:34 PM\n\nWell the first thing I would think is that the parents were inspired by the singer Leona Lewis. The second thing I would think is that it's one of those names that I get a specific weird vibe from. I'm not really sure how to describe this vibe, but I get it with names like Lanae and Sienna and Simone, too. I guess the best way I can describe it is that it seems like these names are almost too \"smooth\", which gives me... I dunno, this weird feeling. It's like a name made out of Spandex, it seems so smooth that it borders on this weird artificial feelings. It's almost impossible to describe, sorry I'm not of much help :P After that I would think that it was nice that a baby was given a legitimate, unusual-but-not-bizarre name. I would also think it sounds a bit 80's.\n\nETA: I am pronouncing it as LAY-oh-na, not LEE-oh-na. I don't get the same vibe at all from LEE-oh-na; I think that's very very pretty.\n\nThis message was edited 10/25/2009, 5:27 PM"
