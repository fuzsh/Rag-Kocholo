        "text": "In Detail\n\nBorn and raised in London, Leona Lewis won a talent show at the age of 13 and devoted herself to music thereafter, eventually graduating from the prestigious BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology. While working as a receptionist and pizza waitress and writing her own material, Leona Lewis auditioned for The X Factor in the summer of 2006 and won the third series competition in December of that year. Leona Lewis' debut single, a soulful cover of A Moment Like This, was the number one single in the U.K. at the turn of the year, including the coveted \"Christmas Number One\". Her second album, Echo, was given a worldwide release in 2009.\n\nWHAT she OFFERS YOU\n\nLeona Lewis' striking beauty, charmingly down-to-earth personality, and huge, soaring voice has taken over the UK and further afield. Her disarming modesty is part of what has endeared Lewis to her fans. Every once in a while, an artist comes along whose talent is so undeniable that it inspires everyone who encounters it. She is an artist who will be a true star for many years to come."
