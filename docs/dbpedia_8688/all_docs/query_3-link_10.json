Leon comes from the Greek “leon” (λεων) meaning “lion”. The Latin equivalent is Leo and the two names are considered interchangeable at this point. The name Leon has been common among Jewish people owing to Genesis 49:9 when, prior to his death, Jacob gathers his twelve sons for their final blessing and foretells their respective futures. To his fourth son Judah he said: “Judah is a lion’s cub; from the prey, my son, you have gone up.” The Kingdom of Judah became one of the two Jewish states (the other being the Kingdom of Israel) around the 10th century B.C. and is where the royal line of David ruled (the capital being Jerusalem). The lion therefore became an important symbol to the Jews. Aside from the Jewish connection, Leonidas I was a 5th century B.C. King of Sparta admired for his bravery and leadership, and believed to be descended from Hercules. The lion is a powerful and regal animal - a symbol of courage - so it’s no wonder that many people of different languages have readily adopted this name. Leona is most popular in the nation of Croatia today, but it also shows up on the charts in France.\n\nAll About the Baby Name – Leona\n\nPersonality\n\nOF THE GIRL NAME LEONA\n\nThe Number 2 personality in numerology is all about cooperation and balance. It's the number of diplomats and mediators. They are not leaders, but strive rather for harmony in partnerships. These are the peacemakers. Equality and fairness are important in their dealings, and they are willing to share power and responsibility to achieve a harmonious outcome. This personality is calm and patient, waiting for things to evolve instead of pushing aggressively for an outcome. They are good-natured and easy-going, and care deeply on an emotional and spiritual plane. Twos appreciate beauty and nature and are intent on making the world a better place.\n\nPopularity\n\nOF THE GIRL NAME LEONA\n\nLeona was surprisingly popular in the United States during t he late 19th and early 20th centuries. Her peak popularity came between 1904 and 1905 at position #69 on the charts. Leona fell off the Top 100 list of most commonly used female by the mid 1920s which pretty much marks the beginning of her end. Her decline on the charts was steadily consistent and in 1982 she was nowhere to be found. Leona’s hibernation lasted a remarkable 27 consecutive years (1982-2008) and she only just returned to the Top 1000 list in 2009. Still residing near the very bottom on the charts, Leona remains a rarely used name in America. Leona does feel a bit out-dated, but she has a simple, modern sensibility nevertheless. We love the association with the courageous lion and think it a fitting choice for a baby girl born under the sun sign of Leo.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nON LEONA\n\nGENDER:\n\nGirl\n\nORIGIN:\n\nEnglish\n\nNUMBER OF SYLLABLES:\n\n3\n\nRANKING POPULARITY:\n\n734\n\nPRONUNCIATION:\n\nlee-OH-nə\n\nSIMPLE MEANING:\n\nLion\n\nCharacteristics\n\nOF LEONA\n\nCooperative\n\nConsiderate\n\nCompassionate\n\nNurturing\n\nSensitive\n\nPatient\n\nLoving\n\nKind\n\nGracious\n\nBalanced\n\nCultural References to the Baby Name – Leona\n\nLiterary Characters\n\nOF THE BABY NAME LEONA\n\nWe cannot find any significant literary characters by the name of Leona\n\nChildrens Books\n\nON THE BABY NAME LEONA\n\nWe cannot find any childrens books with the first name Leona\n\nPopular Songs\n\nON LEONA\n\nLeona\n\na song by Stonewall Jackson\n\nFamous People\n\nNAMED LEONA\n\nLeona Lewis (British pop star)\n\nLeona Helmsley (hotel operator and real estate magnet)\n\nLeona Hutton (silent era film star)\n\nLeona Mitchell (opera singer)\n\nChildren of Famous People\n\nNAMED LEONA\n\nWe cannot find any children of famous people with the first name Leona\n\nHistoric Figures\n\nWITH THE NAME LEONA\n\nWe cannot find any historically significant people with the first name Leona"
