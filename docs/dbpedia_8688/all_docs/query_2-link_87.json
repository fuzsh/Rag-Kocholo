        "text": "Leona Lewis has said she is 'heartbroken' as she admits 'life will never be the same'.\n\nThe singer took to social media to tell her fans about the difficult time she is going through after a family member passed away. The 39-year-old announced this week that her dog Forrest had died.\n\nIn an emotional Instagram post she shared a series of snaps of the pup as she paid tribute to her Chihuahua. Leona wrote: \"I don’t really know where to begin…I’m heartbroken. I had to say goodbye to my little Forrest, my best friend through so many phases of my life.\n\n\"I had only just gotten to the point of being able to talk about the loss of Zion, my beautiful Doberman who passed away 2 years ago. It was only 2 weeks after the birth of Carmel so it was very difficult to process the pain of losing him at that point.\"\n\nLeona went on to say that her two dogs were “the most precious gifts”. She said: “Forrest and Zion were two of the most precious gifts and I’m so grateful for each day I got to spend with them. My studio companions, my protectors from squirrels, my snuggle buddies, my baby boys.\n\n\"Life will never be the same without you but I still feel you around me and I know you are with each other laying by a window in that little bit of sunlight you both loved so much. Forever grateful I got to be your earth mama and thank you for opening up my heart with your love.\"\n\nFans took to the comments to sent their supportive messages. One said: \"Sending all the love in the world and were all for you and the family. Take a big hug from your Hopefield family xxx.\" While another commented: \"Two of the best that ever walked this earth, beautiful spirits who are now all around you, D and Carmel wherever you go.\"\n\n\"So sorry gorgeous sending you tons of love Sleep tight little Forrest,\" one wrote as another added: \"So sorry. People who don't have dogs really don't understand the love and bond we share with these beautiful creatures. Lots of love.\"\n\nLeona rose to fame when she won the third series of The X Factor in 2006. She went on to release hit after hit including Bleeding Love, Run and Better In Time. The singer is the first British female solo artist to reach the top five with eight singles, surpassing Olivia Newton-John's record of seven.\n\nThroughout her career, she has won two MOBO Awards, an MTV Europe Music Award, and two World Music Awards. She was also nominated for six BRIT Awards and three Grammy Awards. The star sang I See You from James Cameron’s hit film Avatar in 2009, and in 2016 she made her Broadway debut replacing Nicole Scherzinger as Grizabella in the revival of Lord Lloyd-Webber’s musical Cats."
