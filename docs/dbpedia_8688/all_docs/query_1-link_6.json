        "text": "Leona Lewis has welcomed her first child with her husband Dennis Jauch, with the pair giving their new arrival a sweet and unique name.\n\nThe Bleeding Love hitmaker, 37, shared the joyful news, sharing a photo of herself and Dennis holding the newborn and writing: ‚ÄòAnd then there were three üíóOur little Carmel Allegra arrived 22.7.22 üïä.‚Äô\n\nFans and friends were over the moon for the star, with many loving the unique name.\n\nBut what does it mean?\n\nCarmel means garden or vineyard and is of Hebrew origin.\n\nIt could be a reference to Leona and Dennis‚Äô love story, considering they got married in a vineyard in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, the tot‚Äôs middle name, Allegra, is of Italian origin and means joyful, happy, or lively. It could also be a nod to Leona‚Äôs heritage, as her mother is of Italian ancestry. Leona and Dennis‚Äô wedding also took place in Italy ‚Äì so the country clearly holds a lot of meaning for the couple.\n\nLeona and Dennis tied the knot three years ago, with the star telling Hello! at the time: ‚ÄòIt was just the most beautiful day, full of love.\n\n‚ÄòIt was so special to be able to bring together everyone we love. There were a lot of tears.‚Äô\n\nThe wedding took place at the end of July in the grounds of the 16th-century vineyard and estate, in Tuscany.\n\nSharing pictures from the mag on her Instagram, the singer wrote: ‚ÄòI will cherish this day for a lifetime.\n\n‚ÄòNine years ago this amazing man walked into my life and last weekend we said ‚ÄúI do‚Äù surrounded by the people we love.‚Äô\n\nThen, last year, she confirmed she and her husband were expecting their first baby, simply sharing a photo of her growing baby bump and writing: ‚ÄòCan‚Äôt wait to meet you in the Summer ‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äô\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you‚Äôve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page ‚Äì we‚Äôd love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : ‚ÄòAnd then there were three‚Äô: Leona Lewis welcomes first baby with husband Dennis Jauch and reveals name"
