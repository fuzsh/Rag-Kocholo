        "text": "Born: 1985. Living in: England\n\nBorn in Islington, London in April 3, 1985 as Leona Louise Lewis---Leona Lewis, is one of Ireland's most famous singers. She was born to parents: Marie Lewis and Joe Lewis, and was the middle child, having brothers: Bradley and Kyle. Leona and her brothers were raised in Highbury and attended the Ambler Primary School located in Finsbury Park. She currently lives with her partner Lou Al-Chamaa while maintaining her singing career.\n\nAs early as age twelve, Leona had the love for singing; in fact, she even composed her first song at that age. When she reached the age of thirteen, Leona joined Hackney Empire's Lady talent show for people under eighteen, wherein she emerged as the winner. Leona also studied in the Brit Academy and the Sylvia Young Stage School. She may love singing more, but she also enjoys both acting and dancing. Leona also finished recording her album \"Twilight\" (prior to her joining the X Factor) which was composed of all the songs she had created, but that album was never made available to the public.\n\nLeona Lewis can attribute her fame to the fact that she was the very first female that emerged as the winner of The X Factor (year 2006). This victory paved the way for her becoming a best selling artist as well as being a nominee for the Grammy Awards thrice. Leona also signed a deal worth 1,000,000 UK pounds with Syco Music, the record label of Simon Cowell. Evetually, she also signed a five album record deal worth $9,700,000with J Records in the United States, owned by Clive Davis. Leona's debut single entitled \"A Moment Like This\" became 2006's Christmas number 1 hit. It was also considered as the fastest selling record in the UK since it has been downloaded more than fifty thousand times just within half an hour of its release. Leona's next single called \"Bleeding Love\" also went number one in around thirty charts all over the world with the inclusion of countries like the US, Japan, Mexico, Italy, Russia, New Zealand, etc. \"Bleeding Love\" even stayed on top of the UK charts for more than a month.\n\nLeona Lewis also released \"Spirit\", her debut album, in both Ireland and the UK. \"Spirit\" turned into the quickest selling album as well as 2007's greatest seller for both countries. In the first quarter of 2008, Leona's debut album was also introduced to Asia and all the other European countries. The album hit the number one spot in a total of ten countries internationally. At present, Leona Lewis resides in Hackney with her fiance Lou and is completing her second album which is expected to be released in November of 2009."
