The Foundation, which is based in Basel, was established on 23 December 1973. Its purpose is to support the activities of the Museum der Kulturen Basel (MKB) that stand in connection with the museum’s public service mandate but cannot be covered by the regular budget. Such activities include:

Purchase, documentation, and preservation of collection objects

Temporary employment of research associates in connection with special projects

Realization of exhibitions and similar projects that make up part of the museum’s core tasks.

In addition, the Board of Trustees organizes events with leading personalities from politics and culture for a select circle of people. If you are interested in receiving an invitation to these events, please don’t hesitate to contact us.

Donations and bequests enable the Foundation to promote further projects. In this sense, we welcome support in any shape or kind.
