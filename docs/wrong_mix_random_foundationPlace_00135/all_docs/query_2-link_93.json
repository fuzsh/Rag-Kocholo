        "text": "Supported by the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, the Dell Scholar program was designed to eliminate the many challenges students face while pursuing an undergraduate degree. The foundation created the Dell Scholarship Program which awards $20,000 to ease financial burden on low-income households and encourage high school graduates to enroll in college.\n\nThe foundation aims to award 500 students the Dell Scholarship nationwide each year. Those who will be graduating from high school in the academic year are eligible to apply. Judges seek those who demonstrate financial need and possess a minimum GPA of 2.4. Winners must plan to enroll full-time at an accredited higher education institution in the pursuit of a bachelor’s degree in the fall directly following high school graduation.\n\nApplicants must apply online and provide recommendation letters, FAFSA reports, and their grade transcripts. Winners enjoy a number of benefits aside from the $20,000 scholarship award, including academic and financial support and assistance during life challenges that would otherwise have caused a student to not graduate, a laptop, a $500 Chegg Study stipend for textbooks, and teletherapy services that give scholars access to professional counseling.\n\nScholarship Summary\n\nSupported by the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, the Dell Scholar program was designed to eliminate the many challenges students face while pursuing an undergraduate degree.
