        "text": "Robots From Basel Set to Revolutionize Surgery\n\nThe Miracle project is developing high-precision bone cutting using a smart laser saw in a minimally invasive surgical procedure. The development of the individually configurable robot needed for these applications is being supported by the Werner Siemens Foundation.\n\nWhat are particle accelerators and how do they help create new products?\n\nWe are used to thinking of particle accelerators as pure research instruments. There are however over 30'000 of them in the world and they are widely used by different industries, from med-tech and computer industry to food and security industries. Accelerator and related technologies are in the origin of many innovations.\n\nRobotics: Innovation and R&D in Switzerland\n\nForbes recently called Switzerland “the Silicon Valley of Robotics” and said the country has “emerged as a serious competitor to California for the technologies, people and funding that will power the world’s fourth socio-economic revolution”. Find out why.\n\nDrug Discovery Made in Switzerland\n\nDrug discovery has come a long way from guess work to a structural and targeted approach to finding new and better remedies. To develop new drugs, companies need to stay up to date about the latest discoveries in genomics, proteomics, structural or quantitative biology.\n\nPROTON THERAPY\n\nThis breakthrough technology for deep-seated tumor irradiation has become one of the ­leading forms of tumor and cancer treatment around the world. With proton therapy, tumor tissues are destroyed using protons.\n\nVirtual Reality Specto VR\n\nMedical Application of Virtual and Augmented Reality Tools. With the Virtual Reality tool SpectoVR, doctors can interact in a three-dimensional space with the patient data prior to surgery.\n\nA new method for cheaper solar-energy storage\n\nStoring solar energy as hydrogen is a promising way for developing comprehensive renewable energy systems. Building on a unique idea, EPFL scientists have now developed a simple, unconventional method to fabricate high-quality, efficient solar panels for direct solar hydrogen production with low cost.\n\nElectron Diffraction for Drug Discovery\n\nModern pharmaceutical development is tailored to the chemical and physical characteristics of active organic compounds. Obtaining a polymorph portfolio of a compound is a demanding process. With its advantages, electron diffraction represents one of the most promising fields of research for unlocking new possibilities in structure-based drug discovery.\n\nDisabled people pilot a robot remotely with their thoughts\n\nUsing a telepresence system developed at EPFL, 19 people – including nine quadriplegics – were able to remotely control a robot located in one of the university laboratories. This multi-year research project aims to give a measure of independence to paralyzed people. Each of the 9 subjects with disabilities managed to remotely control the robot with ease."
