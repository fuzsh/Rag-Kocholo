        "text": "The next project open to the public will be an installation by Steve McQueen, British artist, film director, producer, and screenwriter in June 2025. Until then, Schaulager will only be open for researchers by appointment. In the meantime, interested visitors can take part in the Schaulager guided tours, which take place once a month in English and German. Registration is possible here.\n\nSchaulager was founded in 2003 with the aim of combining the storage and display of contemporary art. As a research institution, storage facility and venue for exhibitions and events in one, it provides specialists with unique research opportunities and a platform for dialogue and exchange. In addition, Schaulager initiates exhibitions and projects to make contemporary art accessible to the general public. The operation of Schaulager is underwritten and overseen by the Laurenz Foundation."
