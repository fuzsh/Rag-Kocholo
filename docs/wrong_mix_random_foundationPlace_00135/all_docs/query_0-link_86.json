        "text": "Institutional Open Access Program (IOAP)\n\nMDPI offers institutions and consortia the opportunity to join over 800 institutions on our Institutional Open Access Program (IOAP), which provides transparency to the MDPI submission process, access to a unique institutional dashboard environment, and a discount on Article Processing Charges (APC) for affiliated researchers.\n\nWith flexible agreement models that offer a variety of payment workflows, MDPI can cater to individual institutional needs in order to help simplify administrative processes.\n\nWe support institutions to abide by Plan S and national mandates, whilst making it easy for authors to publish in fully compliant (CC-BY) Open Access journals.\n\nContact Us\n\nPartner Benefits\n\nParticipating institutions will be granted access to a dedicated Institutional Dashboard on our submission system, ‘Susy’, which allows real-time visibility over articles that have been submitted by their researchers to MDPI journals. It also provides detailed article metadata, up-to-date APC information, downloadable reports, and information about editorial engagement.\n\nAffiliated researchers of participating universities receive a discount on APCs across all MDPI journals. This can be combined with reviewer vouchers, but any discount offered by the Editorial Office is already inclusive of the IOAP discount.\n\nResearchers can also benefit from a 10% discount on the Book Processing Charges (BPCs) for MDPI Books and a 15% discount on Language Editing Services.\n\nInstitutions can receive automated Institutional Repository deposits of papers from affiliated authors using the SWORD 1.3 protocol.\n\nA direct point of contact at MDPI for questions and support.\n\nAgreement Models\n\nFlat fee agreement: the institution can pay a one-time yearly fee for their Corresponding Authors to publish an unlimited number of articles in MDPI journals.\n\nDiscount agreement: Authors affiliated with participating universities receive an IOAP discount on the APC for any paper published in a MDPI journal at no charge to the institution.\n\nFlexible Workflows\n\nNon-central workflow: the authors will benefit from the IOAP discount and will be invoiced directly.\n\nCentral workflow: The institution can approve manuscript invoices for centralised payment. To assist with reducing the administrative burden, the invoicing process can be adjusted to meet the needs of each member institution. Three different standard central invoicing options are available: Direct; Collective (Monthly/Quarterly); and Prepayment.\n\nList of Participants (830)\n\nIf your institution is not yet included on our participants list below, please feel free to recommend our program to your library.
