        "text": "The Palatin Foundation is a grant-making foundation based in Basel. It is committed to enable children, teenagers and young adults grow up as free and self-determined as possible and to strengthen their expression of opinion and social responsibility. We are committed to improve development conditions and structures for the target group and strengthen the necessary foundations for this, such as physical, mental and social health.\n\nPortrait\n\nThe Palatin Foundation was established in 2011 and is based in Basel. Its purpose is to promote future opportunities for children, teenagers and young adults.\n\nAs an independent foundation, we support projects that are not, or only partially, funded by the public sector and private organisations.\n\nThe Palatin Foundation is subject to the foundation supervision of the Canton of Basel City (BSABB) and is a member of the Swiss Association of Charitable Foundations."
