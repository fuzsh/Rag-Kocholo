        "meta_description": "fondazioneinbetweenartfilm on February 22, 2024: \"Introducing Basel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme, who will participate in “Nebula,” our forthcoming group exhibition. “Nebula” will open to the public on 17 April 2024 at the Complesso dell’Ospedaletto in Venice on the occasion of @labiennale Arte 2024.\n\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme explore the political, visceral, and material possibilities of sound, image, text, installation, and performance by sampling both existing and self-authored materials into new ‘scripts.’ Their work reflects on ideas of non-linearity in the form of returns, amnesia and déjà vu, and questions the cancellation of the future while searching for ways in which an altogether different imaginary and language can emerge. \n\nBasel Abbas (1983, Cyprus) and Ruanne Abou-Rahme (1983, USA) currently live and work between Ramallah and New York. Solo presentations of their work have been held at Astrup Fearnley Museet, Oslo; Migros Museum of Contemporary Art, Zurich; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Centraal Museum, Utrecht; Kunstverein Hamburg; Tale of A Tub, Rotterdam; Krannert Art Museum, Champaign (IL); Protocinema at Alt Bomonti, Istanbul; ICA, Philadelphia; Office for Contemporary Art, Oslo; Jameel Art Center, Dubai; and Delfina Foundation, London. Selected group exhibitions include Sharjah Biennial (2023); Berlin Biennale (2022); The Mistake Room, Los Angeles; Seoul International Media Art Biennale (2016); Kunsthalle Wien; ICA, London; Darat al Funun, Amman; São Paulo Biennial (2014); Gwangju Biennale (2014); Istanbul Biennial (2013). They were recipients of the Open Society Foundations fellowship, New York, in 2020–21, and they were artists in residence at Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, Captiva, in 2023. Their current project “May amnesia never kiss us on the mouth” (2020–) is being released in three parts with Dia Art Foundation as part of their Artist Web Projects.\n\nPortrait courtesy of Basel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\".",
