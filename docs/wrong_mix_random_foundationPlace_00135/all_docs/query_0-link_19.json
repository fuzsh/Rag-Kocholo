        "text": "MICHAEL JARRELL\n\nHead Juror, Composer\n\nBorn in Geneva in 1958, Michael Jarrell studied composition at the Geneva Conservatory with Eric Gaudibert and at various workshops in the United States (Tanglewood, 1979). He completed his training with Klaus Huber at the Freiburg Staatliche Hochschule für Musik im Brisgau. Starting in 1982, his works have received numerous prizes: prix Acanthes (1983), Beethovenpreis from the city of Bonn (1986), Marescotti prize (1986), Gaudeamus (1988), Henriette Renié (1988), Siemens- Förderungspreis (1990) and Musikpreis der Stadt Wien (2010).\n\nBetween 1986 and 1988, he was in residence at the Cité des Arts in Paris and took part in the computer music course at Ircam. He resided at the Villa Médicis in Rome during 1988/89, and then joined the Istituto Svizzero di Roma in 1989/90. From October 1991 to June 1993, he was composer in residence with the Lyon Orchestra. Beginning in 1993, he became professor of composition at the University in Vienna. In 1996, he was composer in residence at the Lucerne festival, and then was heralded by the Musica Nova Helsinki Festival, which dedicated the festival to him in 2000.\n\nIn 2001, the Salzburg Festival commissioned a concerto for piano and orchestra entitled “Abschied”. The same year, he was named \"Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres\". In 2004, he was named professor of composition at the Geneva Conservatory.\n\nLIZA LIM\n\nComposer\n\nLiza Lim (*30.8.1966 Perth / Australia) is a composer, educator and researcher whose music focusses on collaborative and transcultural practices. The roots of beauty (in noise), time effects in the Anthropocene and the sensoria of ecological connection are ongoing concerns in her compositional work.\n\nHer four operas: The Oresteia (1993), Moon Spirit Feasting (2000), The Navigator (2007) and Tree of Codes (2016), and the major ensemble work Extinction Events and Dawn Chorus(2018) explore themes of desire, memory, ritual transformation and the uncanny. Her genre-crossing percussion ritual/opera Atlas of the Sky (2018), is a work involving community participants that investigates the emotional power and energy dynamics of crowds.\n\nLiza Lim has received commissions from some of the world’s pre-eminent orchestras and ensembles including the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, BBC, SWR and WDR Symphony Orchestras, Ensemble Musikfabrik, ELISION, Ensemble Intercontemporain, Ensemble Modern, Klangforum Wien, International Contemporary Ensemble, Arditti String Quartet and JACK Quartet. She was Resident Composer with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in 2005 and 2006. Her music has been featured at the Spoleto Festival, Miller Theatre New York, Festival d’Automne à Paris, Venice Biennale, Lucerne Festival, and at all the major Australian festivals.\n\nHer Annunciation Triptych, performed in 2022 under the direction of Cristian Mâcelaru in its entirety for the first time, draws a broad line from the Greek poet Sappho to Mary, the virgin Mother of God, to Fatima, the daughter of Mohammed, founder of Islam. The composer considers the stories of these three women as comments on ecological, spiritual and transcultural issues of our times. To Liza Lim, who grew up as the daughter of Chinese parents in Australia and has taught intermittently in Europe, relations between different cultures have been a life-long subject of interest.\n\nLim is Professor of Composition and inaugural Sculthorpe Chair of Australian Music at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music where she leads the ‘Composing Women’ program.\n\nRecognition for her work includes the Don Banks Award for Music (2018), the Peggy Glanville Hicks Residency (1995), Paul Lowin Prize for Orchestral Composition (2004), Fromm Foundation Award (2004) and DAAD Artist-in-residence Berlin (2007-08). She has been awarded the 2021 Happy New Ears Prize of the Hans and Gertrud Zender Foundation and is a Fellow of the Wissenschaftskollleg zu Berlin in 2021-22.\n\nHer music is published by Casa Ricordi Berlin and on CD labels such as Kairos, Hat Art, WERGO, HCR and Winter & Winter.\n\nAUGUSTA READ THOMAS\n\nComposer\n\nThe music of Augusta Read Thomas (b. 1964 in New York) is nuanced, majestic, elegant, capricious, lyrical, and colorful — \"it is boldly considered music that celebrates the sound of the instruments and reaffirms the vitality of orchestral music\" (Philadelphia Inquirer).\n\nA composer featured on a Grammy winning CD by Chanticleer and Pulitzer Prize finalist, Thomas’ impressive body of works “embodies unbridled passion and fierce poetry” (American Academy of Arts and Letters). The New Yorker magazine called her \"a true virtuoso composer.\" Championed by such luminaries as Barenboim, Rostropovich, Boulez, Eschenbach, Salonen, Maazel, Ozawa, and Knussen, she rose early to the top of her profession. The American Academy of Arts and Letters described Thomas as “one of the most recognizable and widely loved figures in American Music.\"\n\nShe is a University Professor of Composition in Music and the College at The University of Chicago. Thomas was the longest-serving Mead Composer-in-Residence with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for conductors Daniel Barenboim and Pierre Boulez (1997-2006). This residency culminated in the premiere of Astral Canticle, one of two finalists for the 2007 Pulitzer Prize in Music. During her residency, Thomas not only premiered nine commissioned orchestral works, but was also central in establishing the thriving MusicNOW series, through which she commissioned and programmed the work of many living composers. For the 2017-2018 concert season, Thomas was the Composer-in-Residence with the Eugene Symphony Orchestra, while Francesco Lecce-Chong served as Music Director and Scott Freck as Executive Director. Thomas was MUSICALIVE Composer-in-Residence with the New Haven Symphony, a national residency program of The League of American Orchestras and Meet the Composer.\n\nThomas won the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize, among many other coveted awards. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Thomas was named the 2016 Chicagoan of the Year.\n\nIn 2016, Augusta Read Thomas founded the University of Chicago’s Center for Contemporary Composition, which is a dynamic, collaborative, and interdisciplinary environment for the creation, performance and study of new music and for the advancement of the careers of emerging and established composers, performers, and scholars. Distinguished by its formation within an uncompromising, relentlessly searching, and ceaselessly innovative scholarly environment, which celebrates excellence and presents new possibilities for intellectual dialogue, the Center comprises ten integrated entities: annual concert series featuring the Grossman Ensemble, CHIME, visiting ensembles, distinguished guest composers, performances, recordings, research, student-led projects, workshops and postdoctoral fellowships.\n\nNot only is Thomas one of the most active composers in the world, but she is a long-standing, exemplary citizen with an extensive history of being deeply committed to her community. She is the former Chairperson for the American Music Center; Vice President for Music, The American Academy of Arts and Letters; and Member of the Conseil Musical de la Foundation Prince Pierre de Monaco.\n\nIn February 2015, music critic Edward Reichel wrote, \"Augusta Read Thomas has secured for herself a permanent place in the pantheon of American composers of the 20th and 21st centuries. She is without question one of the best and most important composers that this country has today. Her music has substance and depth and a sense of purpose. She has a lot to say and she knows how to say it — and say it in a way that is intelligent yet appealing and sophisticated.\"\n\nRecent and upcoming commissions include those from the Santa Fe Opera in collaboration with the San Francisco Opera and other opera companies, PEAK Performances at Montclair State University and the Martha Graham Dance Company, The Cathedral Choral Society of Washington D.C., The Indianapolis Symphony, Tanglewood, The Kaleidoscope Chamber Orchestra, Des Moines Symphony, Boston Symphony, the Utah Symphony, Wigmore Hall in London, JACK quartet, Third Coast Percussion, Spektral Quartet, Chicago Philharmonic, Eugene Symphony, the Danish Chamber Players, Notre Dame University, Janet Sung, Lorelei Vocal Ensemble, and the Fromm Foundation.\n\nThomas has the distinction of having her work performed more frequently in 2013-2014 than any other living ASCAP composer, according to statistics from the performing rights organization (New York Times). Her discography includes 90 commercially recorded CDs.\n\nANDREA L. SCARTAZZINI\n\nComposer\n\nAndrea Lorenzo Scartazzini (born 1971 in Basel) read German and Italian studies at the University of Basel and studied composition under Rudolf Kelterborn (Basel) and Wolfgang Rihm (Karlsruhe). As part of his studies, he also attended the Royal Academy of Music in London for a semester in 1999/2000.\n\nIn 2004, he was composer in residence at Witten/Herdecke University, and in 2011 and 2018 an artist in residence at the Swatch Art Peace Hotel in Shanghai; in 2012/13 he was a Fellow of the International House of Artists Villa Concordia in Bamberg.\n\nHe has won numerous awards, including the Composers’ Prize of the Ernst von Siemens Foundation in Munich, the Jacob Burckhardt Prize of the Goethe Foundation in Basel, and the Alexander Clavel Prize, Riehen.\n\nHis works have been performed at major festivals (the Salzburg Easter Festival, Lucerne Festival, International Summer Courses for New Music in Darmstadt, Prague Premieres and elsewhere) by many ensembles and orchestras (including Quatuor Diotima, Collegium Novum Zürich, Ensemble Contrechamps, Ensemble Intercontemporain, Ensemble Modern, Ensemble Phoenix, Kammerorchester Basel, basel sinfonietta, Berner Symphonieorchester, Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz and others).\n\nHis major works are the operas “Wut” (Theater Erfurt 2006, Theater Bern 2010), “Der Sandmann” (Theater Basel 2012, Oper Frankfurt 2016) and “Edward II” (Deutsche Oper Berlin 2017).\n\nScartazzini is to collaborate with the Jena Philharmonic over several years, having become its composer in residence in the autumn of 2018. He is engaged in a multi-part work with references to the Gustav Mahler cycle, which is to be performed by Simon Gaudenz and the Jena Philharmonic in collaboration with other orchestras.\n\nRoland Kluttig\n\nConductor\n\nAs \"one of the few conductors in the world who performs the newest music as adeptly as Beethoven, Wagner, and Sibelius\" (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung), Roland Kluttig can be experienced on international stages in opera and concert with a wide-ranging repertoire. A particular focus of his work are the compositions of Schumann, Wagner, Berg, Debussy, Janáček, and Sibelius.\n\nIn the 2023/24 season, he will make his debut with the Lower Saxony State Orchestra Hannover and the Bremen Philharmonic. With the RSO Vienna, he performs at Wien Modern, among others; re-invitations also take him to the Konzerthausorchester Berlin, the Staatsorchester Stuttgart, the hr-Sinfonieorchester Frankfurt, the Czech Philharmonic Choir and Philharmonic Orchestra Brno, the Theater Heidelberg, and the Norrlandsoperan and Wermland Opera in Sweden. With the latter, he will intensify his collaboration as Principal Guest Conductor and Artistic Advisor from 2024.\n\nAfter very successful productions of Dukas' Ariane et Barbe-Bleue and Szymanowski's Król Roger at the Graz Opera, he served as principal conductor there from 2020 to 2023. The Austrian premiere of Georg Friedrich Haas' opera Morgen und Abend and Richard Wagner's The Flying Dutchman and Janáček's Katja Kabanova stand out from this period, as do concerts with the Graz Philharmonic at the Musikverein Graz and the Konzerthaus Wien. In 2021, moreover, his conducting of Morton Feldman's Neither at the Salzburg Festival with the ORF Radio Symphony Orchestra Vienna was hailed in the press as a \"stellar hour.\"\n\nDuring his time as General Music Director at the Landestheater Coburg (2010 - 2020), productions of Wagner's Lohengrin and Parsifal attracted national interest. He was nominated as Conductor of the Year by Opernwelt magazine for his conducting of Beethoven's Fidelio. Since 2000, he has enjoyed a close collaboration with the Stuttgart State Opera. Among other things, he brought out the spectacular new production of Strauss' Salome there in 2015 and a new production of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro in 2019.\n\nRoland Kluttig has also been invited as a guest conductor at the Frankfurt Opera (Euryanthe) the Hamburg State Opera (Die tote Stadt) the Leipzig Opera, the Mannheim National Theater, the Opéra Nice Côte d'Azur, the Opéra national du Rhin, the Swedish Norrlandsoperan (Wozzeck and Peter Grimes); in concert he has worked with the Philharmonia Orchestra London, Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra, Orchestre Philharmonique du Luxembourg, Prague Philharmonia, Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin, the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks and many others.\n\nHis recordings of Schoenberg's Moses und Aron with the Stuttgart State Opera and Weinberg's The Passenger with the Graz Opera received very positive reviews in the international press. He has also recorded works by less prominent composers whose music is close to his heart, including Erwin Schulhoff with the DSO Berlin and Silvestre Revueltas with the Kammerensemble Neue Musik Berlin, of which he was Musical Director in the 1990s. Roland Kluttig studied in Dresden and has been sponsored by the Eötvös Institute, the Conductors' Forum of the German Music Council, the Akademie Schloss Solitude and the Herbert von Karajan Foundation.\n\nTito Ceccherini\n\nConductor\n\nItalian conductor Tito Ceccherini has made a name for himself especially with interpretations of works from the 20th Century as well as contemporary repertoire. He skilfully combines a focus on details with an understanding of the larger structure of a work - the Deutschlandfunk, for example, hailed his interpretation of Janáček's From the House of the Dead: \"Tito Ceccherini crystallises (...) these disparate but tremendously colourful musical levels with aplomb and precision and does not lose sight of the overall architecture of the three-act work\".\n\nIn the season 2023/24 Tito Ceccherini returns to the Orchestra della Toscana, and will conduct the world premiere of a piano concerto by Federico Gardella as well as works by Sibelius and Nielsen with the Deutschen Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz in Rockenhausen and Mannheim. Compositions by Filidei and Sibelius are programmed for a concert with the Orchestra dell’Opera Carlo Felice in Genoa, and he leads a new opera by Lucia Ronchetti with the SWR Symphony Orchestra at the Schwetzinger SWR Festspielen. He will also be a guest again with the Remix Ensemble and the Orquestra Sinfónica do Porto Casa da Música in Portugal.\n\nIn opera he celebrated a great success with Jenske Mijnssen’s new production of Poulenc’s Dialogues des Carmelites at the Opera Zurich in spring 2022, following his first invitation at the house with Ligeti’s Le Grand Macabre in 2019. He gave his house debuts at Theater Basel with Verdi’s La Traviata (direction: Benedikt von Peter) in 2022 as well as at the Staatsoper Stuttgart with Janáček’s Katja Kabanova in 2023 (direction: Jossi Wieler/Sergio Morabito). Since 2009 he has been working regularly at Teatro La Fenice in Venice where he conducted works such as Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas (2020), Sciarrino’s Luci mie traditrici (2019), Battistelli’s Richard III (2018; direction: Robert Carsen, winner of the Franco Abbiati Music Critics Award), Krenek’s Gefalo e Pocri (2017), and Sciarrino’s La porta della legge (2014). Other houses where he has been a reoccurring guest include Oper Frankfurt (Bellini I puritani 2018, Janáček Aus einem Totenhaus 2018, Strawinsky The Rake’s Progress 2017) as well as Théâtre du Capitole in Toulouse (Mozart Entführung aus dem Serail 2017, Berlioz Béatrice et Bénédict 2016, Dallapiccola Il prigioniero / Bartók Blue Beard’s Castle 2015 – direction: Aurélien Bory). Following the sensational world premiere of Sciarrino’s Da gelo a gelo at the Schwetzinger Festspiele in 2006, he led numerous premiers and first performances including most recently Lucia Ronchetti’s Inferno at Oper Frankfurt in 2021.\n\nTito Ceccherini emerges also as conductor of international renowned symphony orchestras. As such he has worked with the Philharmonia Orchestra, Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Filarmonica della Scala, Orchestra del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, the Orquesta Estable del Teatro Colón, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, Radio Filharmonisch Orkest, the Radio Orchestras of Stuttgart, Cologne, Frankfurt and Turin as well as many other leading orchestras in Italy, Spain and Portugal. Among his regular partners are the most important ensembles such as Klangforum Wien, Ensemble Modern, Ensemble intercontemporain, Collegium Novum Zurich or Ensemble Contrechamps.\n\nTito Ceccherini is founder of the Ensemble Risognanze, with whom he performs master works of the chamber music repertoire from Debussy to today documented on several CDs. His extensive discography includes recordings with Sony, Kairos, Col legno and Stradivarius, who have been awarded with the Diapason d’or, the Midem Classical Award and the Choc du Monde de la Musique among others.\n\nBorn in Milan he studied piano, composition and conducting in his home town at the Conservatorio \"Giuseppe Verdi“ before he continued his education in St. Petersburg (Russia), Stuttgart and Karlsruhe (Germany)."
