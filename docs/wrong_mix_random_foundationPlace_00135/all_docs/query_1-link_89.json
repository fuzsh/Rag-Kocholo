But before their benefits can be reaped, proper usability and a positive user experience need to be ensured.\n\nIn this study, we tested the usability and user experience of a socially assistive robot (the NAO humanoid robot) to monitor and train the health of frail older adults. They were asked to complete a set of health monitoring and physical training tasks, once provided by the NAO robot, and once provided by a Tablet PC application (as a reference technology). After using each technology, they completed the System Usability Scale for usability, and a set of rating scales for perceived usefulness, enjoyment, and control. Finally, we questioned the participants’ preference for one of the technologies. All interactions were recorded on video and scrutinized for usability issues. Twenty older adults participated. They awarded both technologies ‘average’ usability scores. Perceived usefulness and enjoyment were rated as very positive for both modalities; control was scored positively. Main usability issues for NAO for these tasks were related to speech interaction (e.g., NAO’s limited speech library, NAO’s difficulty to cope with Dutch dialect), older adults’ difficulties with taking their proper role in human-robot interaction, and a lack of affordances of NAO. Seven participants preferred NAO: it was easier to use and more personal.\n\nSocial robots have the potential to monitor and train the health of frail older adults, but some critical usability challenges need to be overcome first.\n\nTOP\n\n2.

In frail subjects emergency situations and mobility levels need to be carefully monitored. This study aimed to: i) evaluate differences in the mobility index (MI) provided by ADAMO system, an innovative remote monitoring device for older adults; ii) compare the association of the MI and a traditional physical measure with frailty.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nTwenty-five community-dwelling older adults (71 ± 6 years; 60% women) wore ADAMO continuously for a week. The time percentage spent in Low, Moderate and Vigorous Activities was assessed using ADAMO system. Walking ability and frailty were measured using the 400 m walk test and the Tilburg Frailty Indicator, respectively.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nControlling for age and gender, the ANCOVA showed that frail and robust participants were different for Low (frail = 58.8%, robust = 42.0%, p < 0.001), Moderate (frail = 25.5%, robust = 33.8%, p = 0.008), and Vigorous Activity (frail = 15.7%, robust = 24.2%, p = 0.035). Using cluster analysis, participants were divided into two groups, one with higher and one with lower mobility. Controlling for age and gender, linear regression showed that the MI clusters were associated with total (β = 0.571, p = 0.002), physical (β = 0.381, p = 0.031) and social (β = 0.652, p < 0.001) frailty; and the 400 m walk test was just associated with total (β = 0.404, p = 0.043) and physical frailty (β = 0.668, p = 0.002).\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nADAMO system seems to be a suitable time tracking that allows to measure mobility levels in a non-intrusive way providing wider information on individual health status and specifically on frailty. For the frail individuals with an important loss of resources in physical domain, this innovative device may represent a considerable help in preventing physical consequences and in monitoring functional status.\n\nKEYWORDS:\n\nHealth status; ICT tool; Physical functioning; Physical measure; Sarcopenia\n\nPMID: 30898096 PMCID: PMC6427849 DOI:10.1186/s12877-019-1089-z\n\nTOP\n\n3.

Test-retest reliability between the two modalities, usability, user experience factors, and older adults' preference were determined. The results show perfect agreement between tablet and paper for the SARC-F and high agreement for the SF-36 physical scale and EQ-5D. Usability and user experience factors were perceived the same for both modalities. The majority of the participants preferred the tablet for health screening purposes, mainly because of its ease of use. This study shows that using tablets for health screenings among older adults does not affect test reliability, and that older adults prefer the tablet to paper for completing these tests.\n\nPMID: 29678041 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nTOP\n\n4.

The International Conference on Frailty and Sarcopenia Research Task Force met in April 2017 to discuss the meaning, significance, and barriers to the implementation of the new code as well as strategies to accelerate development of new therapies. Analyses by the Sarcopenia Definitions and Outcomes Consortium are underway to develop quantitative definitions of sarcopenia. A consensus conference is planned to evaluate this analysis. The Task Force also discussed lessons learned from sarcopenia trials that could be applied to future trials, as well as lessons from the osteoporosis field, a clinical condition with many constructs similar to sarcopenia and for which ad hoc treatments have been developed and approved by regulatory agencies.\n\nDOI: 10.14283/jfa.2017.30\n\nPMID: 29412436 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nTOP\n\n5.

In particular, the decisions lead to the choice of the adopted instruments, and the reasons for setting the relevant thresholds are explained. In SPRINTT, the concept of physical frailty is translated with a Short Physical Performance Battery score of ≥3 and ≤9.\n\nConcurrently, sarcopenia is defined according to the recent definitions of low muscle mass proposed by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health-Sarcopenia Project. Given the preventive purpose of SPRINTT, older persons with mobility disability (operationalized as incapacity to complete a 400-m walk test within 15 min; primary outcome of the trial) at the baseline are not included within the diagnostic spectrum of PF&S.\n\nDOI: 10.1007/s40520-016-0716-1\n\nPMID: 28188558 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nTOP\n\n6.

Because physical frailty in its initial phase can still be reversed, fighting sarcopenia in elderly persons has the potential to slow or halt progressive decline towards disability and dependency. Quite recently, regulators focused attention on frailty as an indicator of biological age to be measured to characterize elderly patients before their inclusion in clinical trials. A European guidance regarding most adapted evaluation instruments of frailty is currently under public consultation. Does the regulatory initiative imply we should now consider frailty, and particularly physical frailty, primarily as an important risk factor for adverse events and poor response, or mainly as a clinical tool helping the physician to opt for one therapeutic pathway or another? Or is physical frailty above all a specific geriatric condition deserving an effective and innovative therapeutic approach with the objective to curb the incidence of its most common result, e.g., mobility disability? Pharmaceutical industry developers consider both faces of the coin very relevant. We agree with regulators that better characterization of subpopulations, not only in elderly patients, can improve the benefit risk ratio of medicines. At the same time, we believe it is in the public health interest to develop novel drugs indicated for specific geriatric conditions, like osteoporosis in the 1990s and sarcopenia today. We consider it an important therapeutic goal to effectively delay mobility disability and to extend the active, independent, and healthy life years of aging people. The \"Sarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people: multi-componenT Treatment strategies\" (SPRINTT) collaborative project under IMI is paving the way for adapted methodologies to study the change of physical frailty and sarcopenia in at-risk older persons and to adequately characterize the population that needs to be treated.\n\nDOI: 10.1007/s40520-016-0710-7\n\nPMID: 28160253 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nTOP\n\n7.

Whole-genome sequencing and high-resolution imaging technologies are key drivers of this rapid and crucial transformation. Technological innovation combined with automation and miniaturization has triggered an explosion in data production that will soon\n\nreach exabyte proportions. How are we going to deal with this exponential increase in data production? The potential of \"big data\" for improving health is enormous but, at the same time, we face a wide range of challenges to overcome urgently. Europe is very proud of its cultural diversity; however, exploitation of the data made available through advances in genomic medicine, imaging, and a wide range of mobile health applications or connected devices is hampered by numerous historical, technical, legal, and political barriers. European health systems and databases are diverse and fragmented. There is a lack of harmonization of data formats, processing, analysis, and data transfer, which leads to incompatibilities and lost opportunities. Legal frameworks for data sharing are evolving.

Aim of this article is to describe the possible field of application for ICT-supported services in the management of older adults, in particular those with functional impairment. The current status of ICT-supported services is described and examples of how these services can be implemented in everyday practice are given. Upcoming technical solutions and future directions are also addressed. An ICT-supported service is not only the technological tool, but its combination with clinical purposes for which it is used and the way it is implemented in everyday care. Patient's satisfaction with ICT-supported services is moderate to good. Actual use of patients is higher than those of professionals but very variable. Frequency of use is positively related to clinical outcome. ICT offers a variety of opportunities for the treatment and prevention of frailty and functional decline. Future challenges are related to the intelligence of the systems and making the technologies even more unobtrusive and intuitive.\n\nTOP\n\n9.

Here, we describe the procedures followed for PF&S case finding and screening of candidate participants for the SPRINTT RCT. We also illustrate the main demographic and clinical characteristics of eligible screenees.\n\nMethods: The identification of PF&S was based on the co-occurrence of three defining elements: (1) reduced physical performance (defined as a score on the Short Physical Performance Battery between 3 and 9); (2) low muscle mass according to the criteria released by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health; and (3) absence of mobility disability (defined as ability to complete the 400-m walk test in 15 min). SPRINTT was advertised through a variety of means. Site-specific case finding strategies were developed to accommodate the variability across centers in catchment area characteristics and access to the target population. A quick \"participant profiling\" questionnaire was devised to facilitate PF&S case finding.\n\nResults: During approximately 22 months, 12,358 prescreening interviews were completed in 17 SPRINTT sites resulting in 6710 clinic screening visits. Eventually, 1566 candidates were found to be eligible for participating in the SPRINTT RCT. Eligible screenees showed substantial physical function impairment and comorbidity burden. In most centers, project advertisement through mass media was the most rewarding case finding strategy.\n\nConclusion: PF&S case finding in the community is a challenging, but feasible task. Although largely autonomous in daily life activities, older adults with PF&S suffer from significant functional impairment and comorbidity. This subset of the older population is therefore at high risk for disability and other negative health-related events. Key strategies to consider for successfully intercepting at-risk older adults should focus on mass communication methods.\n\nKeywords: Functional impairment; Mobility disability; Physical performance; Prevention; Recruitment; Skeletal muscle.\n\nTOP\n\n10.

Despite the well-known age-related immunological changes [1], trials’ results suggest that COVID-19 vaccines might achieve comparable efficacy in younger and older adults, the latter being the most vulnerable to the disease.\n\nAbout recommended inclusion criteria that make Clinical Trials results applicable to the general population, the ICH E7 2009 Q&A revision [2] reaffirms the need for a meaningful representation of age classes over 65 years, and particularly those over 75 years. Ideally, the age distribution in the tested population should mirror the incidence of the target disease in the general population. Increased attention to involving older adults in confirmatory clinical trials has been paid in the last decade, including initiatives to develop adapted formulations e.g. a high-dose anti-flu vaccine by Sanofi [3], not made available in the EU.\n\nKeywords: COVID-19; Frailty; Older people; Vaccines.\n\nTOP\n\n11 .

We describe the study protocol of GeroCovid Observational, a multi-purpose, multi-setting and multicenter initiative that aims at investigating: risk factors, clinical presentation and outcomes of individuals affected by COVID-19 in acute and residential care settings; best strategies to prevent infection in long-term care facilities; and, impact of the pandemic on neuropsychologic, functional and physical health, and on medical management in outpatients and home care patients at risk of COVID-19, with a special focus on individuals with dementia.\n\nMethods: GeroCovid involves individuals aged ≥60 years, at risk of or affected by COVID-19, prospectively or retrospectively observed since March 1st, 2020. Data are collected in multiple investigational sites across Italy, Spain and Norway, and recorded in a de-identified clinical e-Registry. A common framework was adapted to different care settings: acute wards, long-term care facilities, geriatric outpatient and home care, and outpatient memory clinics.\n\nResults: At September 16th, 2020, 66 investigational sites obtained their Ethical Committee approval and 1618 cases (mean age 80.6 [SD=9.0] years; 45% men) have been recorded in the e-Registry. The average inclusion rate since the study start on April 25th, 2020, is 11.2 patients/day. New cases enrollment will ended on December 31st , 2020, and the clinical follow-up will end on June 30th, 2021.\n\nConclusion: GeroCovid will explore relevant aspects of COVID-19 in adults aged ≥60 years with high-quality and comprehensive data, which will help to optimize COVID-19 prevention and management, with practical implications for ongoing and possible future pandemics.\n\nTrial registration: NCT04379440 (clinicaltrial.gov).\n\nKeywords: COVID-19; Health Services for the Aged; Inpatients; Nursing Homes; Observational Study; Outpatients.\n\nCopyright © 2021.

Particular attention should be paid to older adults with dementia, given their vulnerability to emotional stressors. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the impact of the first wave quarantine related to Covid-19 on psychological and affective well-being of older adults with mild/major neurocognitive disorders and of their caregivers. Methods: Data on participants' assessment before the quarantine (PREQ) were retrospectively collected. Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia were recruited from different Centers for Cognitive Decline and Dementia in Italy. During the quarantine, psychological and affective well-being were evaluated by phone through the administrations of scales measuring anxiety and depression (DASS), perceived stress (PSS), coping strategies (COPE) and the caregivers' burden (CBI). The scales' results were compared across participants' PREQ cognitive level (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE ≥25, 23-24, and ≤ 22) with multiple linear regression models. Results: The sample included 168 patients (64% women) with a mean age of 79 ± 7 years. After adjusting for potential confounders, more severe cognitive impairment was independently associated with higher DASS and PSS score, and poorer coping strategies (p < 0.05). Cognitive functioning was also inversely associated with CBI. Conclusions: The impact of the quarantine on the psycho-affective well-being of individuals with MCI and dementia and on caregivers' burden varies according to the PREQ cognitive functioning with more severely impaired patients having worse outcomes.\n\nKeywords: COVID-19; dementia; distress; older adults; psychological well-being.\n\nCopyright © 2021 Coin, Devita, Trevisan, Biasin, Terziotti, Signore, Fumagalli, Gareri, Malara, Mossello, Volpato, Monzani, Bellelli, Zia, Ranhoff and Antonelli Incalzi.\n\nTOP\n\n13.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severely affects aged subjects, determining an important prothrombotic status. The aim of this study was to evaluate mortality-related factors in older AF patients with COVID-19.\n\nMethods: Between March and June 2020, we enrolled ≥60 year-old in-hospital COVID-19 patients (n = 806) in GeroCovid, a multicenter observational study promoted by the Italian Society of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine.\n\nResults: The prevalence of AF was 21.8%. In-hospital mortality was higher in the AF group (36.9 vs. 27.5%, p = 0.015). At admission, 51.7, 10.2, and 38.1% of AF cases were taking, respectively, oral anticoagulants (OACs), antiplatelet agents, and no antithrombotic therapy. During hospitalization, 51% patients switched to low-molecular-weight heparins. AF patients who survived were younger (81 ± 8 vs. 84 ± 7 years; p = 0.002) and had a lower CHA2DS2-VASc score (3.9 ± 1.6 vs. 4.4 ± 1.3; p = 0.02) than those who died. OAC use before (63.1 vs. 32.3%; p < 0.001) and during hospitalization (34.0 vs. 12.7%; p = 0.002) was higher among survivors. At multivariable analysis, lower age, higher self-sufficiency, less severe initial COVID-19 presentation, and the use of vitamin K antagonists (odds ratio [OR] = 0.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03-0.84) or direct OACs (OR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.08-0.56) at admission, or the persistence of OAC during hospitalization (OR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.01-0.24), were associated with a lower chance of in-hospital death.\n\nConclusion: AF is a prevalent and severe condition in older COVID-19 patients. Advanced age, dependency, and relevant clinical manifestations of disease characterized a worse prognosis. Preadmission and in-hospital anticoagulant therapies were positively associated with survival.\n\nThieme. All rights reserved.\n\nTOP\n\n14. Gerontology 2022;68(4):412-417.doi: 10.1159/000516969.

The present study aims to evaluate whether outpatient and home care services with remote monitoring and consultation could mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental and affective status, perceived well-being, and personal capabilities of outpatients and home care patients with cognitive disorders.\n\nMethods: Prospectively recorded patients in an electronic web registry provided by BlueCompanion Ltd. Up to October 31, 2020, the sample included 90 patients receiving regular care from the Center for Cognitive Disorders and Dementia in Catanzaro Lido, Italy. It was made of 52 ambulatory outpatients and 38 home care patients, mean age 83.3 ± 7.54 years. Participants underwent a multidimensional assessment at baseline (T0) and after 90 days (T1). For each patient, we administered the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognitive functions, the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental ADL (IADL) scales for functional capabilities, the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) for comorbidities and their impact on patients' health, the 5-items Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) for mood, and the Euro Quality of Life (EuroQoL) for perceived quality of life. Contacts with both ambulatory and home care patients were managed in person or via telephone, preferably through video calls (WhatsApp or FaceTime).\n\nResults: Contacts with patients were kept at T0 through telephone. At T1, visits were made in person for over 95% out of the cases. The ADL, IADL, CIRS, GDS, MMSE, and EuroQoL changed slightly between T0 and T1. Most of the patients were clinically stable over time on the majority of the scales explored, but behavioral changes were found in 24.4% of patients and anxiety and insomnia in 17.7% of patients.\n\nConclusion: Our study suggests that contacts through telephone and video consultations are likely associated with a health status preservation of the patients.\n\nKeywords: COVID-19; GeroCovid study; Home care patients; Older patients; Outpatients.\n\n© 2021 S.

COVID-19 has high mortality in older people. This study aimed at evaluating the relationship of pre-infection AF with characteristics and survival of older COVID-19 patients.\n\nMethods: We retrospectively analyzed inpatients aged ≥ 60 years enrolled in GeroCovid Observational, a multicenter registry endorsed by the Italian and the Norwegian Societies of Gerontology and Geriatrics. Pre-COVID-19 sociodemographic, functional, and medical data were systematically collected, as well as in-hospital mortality.\n\nResults: Between March and June 2020, 808 COVID-19 subjects were enrolled (age 79 ± 9 years; men 51.7%). The prevalence of AF was 21.8%. AF patients were older (82 ± 8 vs. 77 ± 9 years, p < 0.001), had a higher CHA2DS2-VASc score (4.1 ± 1.5 vs. 3.2 ± 1.5, p < 0.001) and were more likely to present almost all comorbidities. At multivariable analysis, advanced age, white blood cell count, the presence of heart and peripheral artery diseases were significantly associated with the presence of AF. In-hospital mortality was higher in AF patients (36.9 vs. 27.5%; OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.09-2.20; p = 0.015). A decision tree analysis showed that, in AF subjects, preserved functional status at admission was the most important factor associated with survival. In patients without AF, baseline COVID-19 severity was the most relevant variable related to clinical prognosis.\n\nConclusions: AF is frequent in older patients with COVID-19, in whom it associates with clinical complexity and high mortality. Pre-infection disability shapes the prognosis of this extremely vulnerable segment of hospitalized subjects.\n\nClinical trial registration: GeroCovid Observational was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04379440).\n\nKeywords: Atrial fibrillation; COVID-19; Disability; Older patients; Oral anticoagulants; Prognosis.\n\n© 2021.

This study aims at assessing to which extent CT findings have prognostic implications in COVID-19 older patients.\n\nMethods: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 60 years or more enrolled in the multicenter, observational and longitudinal GeroCovid study who underwent chest CT were included. Patients were stratified by tertiles of age and pneumonia severity to compare CT findings. Hierarchical clustering based on CT findings was performed to identify CT-related classificatory constructs, if any. The hazard ratio (HR) of mortality was calculated for individual CT findings and for clusters, after adjusting for potential confounders.\n\nResults: 380 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with a mean age of 78 (SD:9) years, underwent chest CT scan. Ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, and pleural effusion were the three most common CT findings, with GGO prevalence decreasing from younger to older patients and pleural effusion increasing. More severe the pneumonia more prevalent were GGO, consolidation and pleural effusion. HR of mortality was 1.94 (95%CI 1.24-3.06) for pleural effusion and 13 (95%CI 6.41-27) for cluster with a low prevalence of GGO and a high prevalence of pleural effusion (\"LH\"), respectively. Out of the three CT based clusters, \"LH\" was the only independent predictor in the multivariable model.\n\nConclusions: Pleural effusion qualifies as a distinctive prognostic marker in older COVID-19 patients. Research is needed to verify whether pleural effusion reflects COVID-19 severity or a coexisting chronic condition making the patient at special risk of death.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04379440.\n\nKeywords: Old; Oldest; Pleural; SARS-CoV-2; Tomography; X-ray computed.\n\nTOP\n\n18.

Due to the high mortality rates of Nursing home (NH) residents during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, priority for COVID-19 vaccinations was given to this vulnerable population. However, the safety and efficacy of such vaccines in older frail elders remains questionable due to the fact that initial randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for such vaccines did not include this population. This type of discrimination in patient participation in RCTs continues and has been recognized in the literature. Nevertheless, in the context of a worldwide emergency, COVID-19 vaccination in older persons living in LTC facilities may provide a solid basis to protect against negative outcomes, such as COVID-19 infection and death. In this report, we present the protocol of the GeroCovid Vax study, an Italian study that began in February 2021 which is aimed at investigating the safety and efficacy of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations in older persons living in LTCs. This protocol specially aims to continuously and closely monitor events related to- and following- the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in elderly living in LTC facilities. In this report, we will provide information related to the study protocol and describe baseline characteristics of the sample.\n\nKeywords: COVID-19 vaccine; Elderly; Frailty syndrome; GeroCovid Vax; Long term care (LTC); Nursing homes (NH); Safety.\n\nCopyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Actimetry data were used to tailor the intervention. Participants also received personalised nutritional counselling. Control participants received education on healthy ageing once a month. Interventions and follow-up lasted for up to 36 months.\n\nMain outcome measures: The primary outcome was mobility disability (inability to independently walk 400 m in <15 minutes). Persistent mobility disability (inability to walk 400 m on two consecutive occasions) and changes from baseline to 24 and 36 months in physical performance, muscle strength, and appendicular lean mass were analysed as pre-planned secondary outcomes. Primary comparisons were conducted in participants with baseline SPPB scores of 3-7 (n=1205). Those with SPPB scores of 8 or 9 (n=314) were analysed separately for exploratory purposes.\n\nResults: Mean age of the 1519 participants (1088 women) was 78.9 (standard deviation 5.8) years. The average follow-up was 26.4 (SD 9.5) months. Among participants with SPPB scores of 3-7, mobility disability occurred in 283/605 (46.8%) assigned to the multicomponent intervention and 316/600 (52.7%) controls (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.92; P=0.005). Persistent mobility disability occurred in 127/605 (21.0%) participants assigned to the multicomponent intervention and 150/600 (25.0%) controls (0.79, 0.62 to 1.01; P=0.06). The between group difference in SPPB score was 0.8 points (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.1 points; P<0.001) and 1.0 point (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.6 points; P<0.001) in favour of the multicomponent intervention at 24 and 36 months, respectively. The decline in handgrip strength at 24 months was smaller in women assigned to the multicomponent intervention than to control (0.9 kg, 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 1.6 kg; P=0.028). Women in the multicomponent intervention arm lost 0.24 kg and 0.49 kg less appendicular lean mass than controls at 24 months (95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.39 kg; P<0.001) and 36 months (0.26 to 0.73 kg; P<0.001), respectively. Serious adverse events occurred in 237/605 (39.2%) participants assigned to the multicomponent intervention and 216/600 (36.0%) controls (risk ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.26). In participants with SPPB scores of 8 or 9, mobility disability occurred in 46/155 (29.7%) in the multicomponent intervention and 38/159 (23.9%) controls (hazard ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 1.95; P=0.34).\n\nConclusions: A multicomponent intervention was associated with a reduction in the incidence of mobility disability in older adults with physical frailty and sarcopenia and SPPB scores of 3-7. Physical frailty and sarcopenia may be targeted to preserve mobility in vulnerable older people.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02582138.\n\n© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, whether and how COVID-19 signs and symptoms may present and aggregate together according to sociodemographic and health factors is unclear, as well as their prognostic value. This study included 981 COVID-19 inpatients who participated in the GeroCovid Observational study. Signs/symptoms at disease onset, sociodemographic, health, cognitive status, and mobility were systematically recorded. Clusters of signs/symptoms were identified through agglomerative hierarchical clustering. The associations of single signs/symptoms and symptom clusters with longer hospitalization (≥16 days) and in-hospital mortality were explored through logistic and Cox regressions. The signs/symptoms most reported in our sample (age 78.3 ± 9.39 years; 49.4% women) were fever (62.5%), cough (45.5%), and dyspnea (62.7%). Atypical symptoms were reported by up to one-third of patients, and delirium by 9.1%. Atypical symptoms were more frequent with advancing age and with lower pre-COVID-19 cognitive and mobility levels. Older men more likely reported respiratory symptoms than women. Dyspnea (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-2.12), tachypnea (HR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.14-2.07), low oxygen saturation (HR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.32-2.88) and delirium (HR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.13-2.28) were associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Four symptom clusters were identified. Compared with the mild respiratory symptoms cluster, the severe clinical impairment cluster was associated with higher mortality (HR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.58-4.18). The severe clinical impairment and aspecific symptoms clusters were associated with longer hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] = 2.38, 95% CI: 1.56-3.63, and OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.08-2.83, respectively). Multiple health aspects influence COVID-19 clinical presentation. A symptom clusters approach may help predict adverse health outcomes in older patients. In addition to respiratory symptoms, delirium is independently associated with mortality risk.
