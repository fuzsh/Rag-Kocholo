        "text": "FOUNDATION\n\nThe museum is run by the private “Basel Paper Mill Foundation,” formed in 1971. The buildings include the Galician and the Stegreif Mills, restored in 1980 by the Christoph Merian Foundation and transferred to the Basel Paper Mill Foundation for the creation of the museum. The museum is supported by the Christoph Merian Foundation and by the cantons Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft.\n\nBOARD OF TRUSTEES:\n\nBECOME A MEMBER\n\nThe Basel Paper Mill is funded through admission charges, guided tours and the sale of the museum’s own products. In addition, regular support comes from the Christoph Merian Foundation and from the cantons Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft.\n\nHowever, the museum relies on the generosity of its many members, through which the following things are possible: the purchase of objects for the collections, special projects and exhibitions, and the maintenance of the often delicate historic machines.\n\nSupport the museum with an annual membership in the Association of Patrons:"
