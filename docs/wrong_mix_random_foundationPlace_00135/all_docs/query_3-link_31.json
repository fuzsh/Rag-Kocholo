        "text": "The Beyeler Foundation in Basel, which houses the collection of Hildy and Ernst Beyeler, is celebrating ten years as a success story in the world of art.\n\nAfter a decade during which 29 special exhibitions have been staged, the art museum has become the most popular in Switzerland, now welcoming more than 340,000 visitors a year.\n\nBut the success has come at a cost and there are financial concerns about the future.\n\nBy setting up their private collection in a building designed by star Italian architect Renzo Piano, the Beyelers offered a magnificent museum to their city. Major art of the 20th century is shown in 200 paintings and sculptures from 40 artists.\n\nThe works of such artists as Cézanne, Picasso, Rousseau, Mondrian, Klee, Ernst and Matisse are displayed alongside, and in direct interaction with, 25 objects from Africa, Alaska and Oceania.\n\nThe collection was put together over 50 years at the Beyeler Gallery in Basel.\n\nNo preconceptions\n\n“This collection came together without any preconceived idea,” the museum’s director Christoph Vitali told swissinfo. “They are works that the Beyelers did not wish to or could not sell.”\n\nIn the same way, the works of Paul Klee are extremely popular today but no one really wanted them at the time.\n\nThe Beyelers kept what they liked, just like the big dealers who have made art history.\n\n“It was only in the 1980s that they began to ask themselves what they would do with them,” Vitali said.\n\nThe construction of the museum in Riehen on the outskirts of Basel was financed by a foundation created by the couple in 1982. The commune and canton Basel City provided the land.\n\nNatural light\n\nThe museum, which is in the middle of the countryside, is covered in red porphyry and glass, with the 22 rooms bathing in natural light.\n\n“It’s this unique combination of collection, architecture and the country that makes the museum’s success,” Vitali said. “The public love to come here for the day.”\n\nAnother reason for its renown is a dynamic programme which features special exhibitions, concerts, fashion shows and other events.\n\nThe tenth anniversary is to be marked from August 19 by an exhibition devoted for the first time to the history of the Beyeler Gallery. Nearly 16,000 canvases, sculptures and works on paper have passed through Bäumleingasse 9, the original address that has remained unchanged.\n\n“We will show 100 of the most important works, which for the most part have come from major public and private collections throughout the world,” Vitali said.\n\nFinancial concerns\n\nBut success has not prevented financial concerns, with Vitali explaining that the Beyelers had to withdraw financially. The ambitious programme of the museum is also difficult to finance.\n\nPublic authorities pledged SFr2 million ($1.6 million) a year for the first ten years to the annual running costs of SFr14 million.\n\n“We have asked for an extension of subsidies. The commune of Riehen has said yes, but the canton is a bit more reticent. However, I hope they will continue,” said Vitali.\n\nEntrance tickets bring in SFr5 million and then there is revenue from the shop and restaurant.\n\nMuseum friends"
