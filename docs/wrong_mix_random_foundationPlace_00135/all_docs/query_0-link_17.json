        "text": "Around the world, millions of patients suffer from currently incurable vision loss. The new Institute of Molecular and Clinical Ophthalmology Basel (IOB) has been created to help them.\n\nGlobally, the prevalence of eye diseases is constantly rising. For most of them, there is no effective therapy available.\n\nIn aging societies, disorders such as macular degeneration or glaucoma constitute a leading cause of disability and loss of independent lifestyle.\n\nWorldwide and especially in Asia, myopia – or short-sightedness – is on a steep incline with up to 90% of teenagers being affected in some regions.\n\nAt IOB, we accelerate the conversion of basic research into innovative treatments which change the field of ophthalmic therapy. Interdisciplinary teams of researchers and clinicians work hand in hand. These problem-solvers and innovators have in-depth knowledge of unmet medical needs, and daily exposure to patients. Together, they improve the understanding of vision, and of the cells involved in eye disease. In this highly collaborative environment, the IOB turns discoveries and technologies into clinical benefits for patients with blinding conditions. We help advance the practice of ophthalmic disease based on the genetic, structural and functional understanding of the cell types and their interactions within the human eye."
