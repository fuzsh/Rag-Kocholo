As an openly gay man, his work in the 80's and early 90's thoroughly investigates the idea of identity, presence, and the impact of AIDs. Some of the bulbs on the string of lights will burn out, representing the expiration of life. The pair of clocks will eventually fall out of sync, representing the evolution or even degradation of a relationship over time.\n\nRoni Horn similarly explores identity and experience with her cast-glass sculptures, which she's been producing since the mid 1990's. Over the course of several months, molten glass left in a mold takes on the dusty translucent quality on the outer edge of these works. The tops are then fire polished to create optically pristine surfaces that are slightly domed, giving the impression of surface tension. The works are highly reflective and therefore take on the environment around them. The subtle changes in appearance represent the constant small changes in one's identity.\n\nGonzales-Torres and Horn are brought together in this presentation not only for their similarities as conceptual artists with moving minimalist works, but also as peers who had an ongoing artistic dialogue. Their relationship began in 1990 when Gonzales-Torres visited the MCA Los Angeles and first saw Roni Horn's work. He then began to correspond with her and created a piece in response to her work, with Roni following suit. This conversation was continued by Roni even after Felix's passing in 1996.\n\n@felixgonzaleztorres.foundation \n#ronihorn #ronihornart #felixgonzaleztorres #parisart #boursedecommerce\".",
