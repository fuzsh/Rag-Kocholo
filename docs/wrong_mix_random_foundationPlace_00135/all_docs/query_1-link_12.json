Through specially made \"instruments\" and with sequential movement orders organized by voice, steps or \"processions\", relationships of meaning between space and the human social activities related to it have been experimented in a physical and direct way.\n\nVisiting professor at EPF Lausanne and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, Quintus Miller has been a full professor at the Academy of Architecture of the University of Lugano since 2009.\n\nIn 2013, Quintus Miller and Paola Maranta were awarded the Meret-Oppenheim Prize from the Federal Office of Culture, and in 2018 they received the internationally renowned \"Heinrich Tessenow-Medaille\" award from the society of the same name.\n\nArchitecture is memory\n\nFriday November 26, 2021, 16:05 – 16:25\n\nFor thousands of years, people have organised their living space in such a way as to protect themselves as much as possible from the rigours of nature and to improve the quality of daily life. The profession of architects is concerned with giving living space a structure and shape that is appropriate to today's lifestyle. They transform the land into a cultural landscape and a built environment that provides our society with appropriate spaces for family, daily work, cultural activities, politics and communal rituals. If these spatial structures correspond in their form and expression to people's needs, then a sense of well-being is established. This is preferably in the area of what is familiar to us. Humanity's striving for a constant improvement of the living situation requires a willingness to take risks that lead to something new. The architects' search for a future and better environment moves between these poles.\n\nIn 2013 he is called to direct the Folkwang Museum in Essen, one of the most important museum institutions in Germany and at European level, devoting particular attention to the relationship with the different stakeholders involved and to the development of the public and collateral activities.\n\nSince January 2018 he has been Director of the Museo d’Arte della Svizzera italiana and since 2021 he has been teaching contemporary art history at the Academy of Architecture in Mendrisio.\n\nArt at the Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale of Lugano\n\nFriday November 26, 2021, 16:45 – 17:05\n\nBorn in 2017 from a collaboration between the Museo d'Arte della Svizzera italiana in Lugano, the Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale and private individuals, the exhibition project \"In the public eye\" originated from shared reflections among artists, architects, art historians and physicians, regarding the presence of works of art in daily life and in places of care, a theme that has been developed for years in many countries with experiences of various nature and breadth.\n\nThe presence of works of art in the public spaces of the hospital, in a context where feelings of fragility and vulnerability are experienced, can offer emotional support to those who are hospitalized, those who work there or those who visit, especially because art can communicate at a deep level that cannot be reached by words.\n\nProf. Grotzer is a full professor of pediatrics at the University of Zurich (UZH) and medical director of the University Children's Hospital Zurich.\n\nAfter studying medicine at the University of Zurich and working in pediatrics and oncology at the University Children's Hospital Zurich, he worked as a researcher at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (USA).\n\nAfter returning to Zurich, he was promoted to Chief, Division Head of Oncology and Head of the Center for Oncology, Hematology, Immunology and Stem Cell Transplantation.\n\nIn his role, he is responsible for leadership and management of the areas of Medicine, Surgery and Research and Teaching.\n\nThe strategic development of services to ensure highly specialized patient care and the education and training of physicians in training are all under his responsibility.\n\nMichael Grotzer has received numerous awards for his research activities: including the Friedrich Götz Award from the University of Zurich and the SIOP (International Society of Pediatric Oncology) Award, among others.\n\nJames Turrell at the Kinderspital Zurich\n\nFriday November 26, 2021, 17:05 – 17:25\n\nWhen dealing with particularly stressful situations, patients, relatives and the staff themselves need special support.\n\nTogether with world-renowned artist James Turrell, Zurich Children's Hospital has created a special place that offers space for peace and inspiration, joy and happiness, as well as sadness and consolation.\n\nIt is a walk-in room with an elliptical light source. Visitors are immersed in light that slowly changes color and elicits thoughts and feelings. This creates a unique and personal lighting effect, just a \"My Light\".\n\nSoundscape at the Childen’s Hospital Helsinki\n\nFriday November 26, 2021, 17:25 – 17:45\n\nThe Soundscape Design for New Children's Hospital in Helsinki was commissioned with the hospital's construction project; consequently, the Soundscape was born with the hospital and follows the visual themes of each floor creating a relaxing sound environment for the children and staff.\n\nSound is reproduced through 60 speakers located in the hospital's halls. It is designed to be heard only in rooms where children are present and the sounds produced change constantly.\n\nNils Fietje is a Research Officer at the WHO Regional Office for Europe, with a background in English Literature and the Cultural History of Medicine. Prior to working at WHO, he was a Senior Adviser at the Wellcome Trust (UK), helping to expand its funding portfolio in the health humanities.\n\nWithin the Behavioural and Cultural Insights Unit at WHO's Regional Office for Europe, he is leading the organisation’s efforts to understand how cultural contexts affect and interact with health and well-being.\n\nCan you singe your way to better health?\n\nSaturday November 27, 2021, 10:15 – 10:45\n\nEngaging with the arts can be beneficial for both mental and physical health. This is a key conclusion of a report from the WHO Regional Office for Europe published in 2019, analysing the evidence from over 900 global publications – the most comprehensive review of evidence on arts and health to date. This keynote will describe how the arts and health movement is gaining traction in the WHO European Region, what WHO is doing to support Member States who are interested in working with arts and health interventions, and what still needs to happen on a political level before arts and health can become an integrated part of health care system throughout Europe.\n\nThe value of the Arts for Wellness and Health. What scientific evidence to guide policy actions?\n\nSaturday November 27, 2021, 10:45 – 11:15\n\nThe theme of arts, cultural participation, and health has emerged in recent years in a very overpowering way.\n\nScientific advances that initially developed independently, have subsequently converged very strongly in a context in which bio-psycho-social science, the science of wellbeing, the science of stress, neuroimaging techniques and the science of beauty have allied themselves.\n\nThis context allowed to realize how solid and credible is the scientific evidence of the role of art and culture in health promotion and to define that it is time to transform these good practices into a lucid political strategy aiming at a new welfare.\n\nA UK best practice\n\nSaturday November 27, 2021, 11:15 – 11:45\n\nThe Culture, Health and Wellbeing Alliance (CHWA) is a British organization , which supports all those who believe that culture and creativity can transform our health and well-being. CHWA has nearly 6,000 members representing a mix of freelance creatives, arts, cultural and heritage organisations, health and social care colleagues, researchers and local and national policy makers.\n\nWe will explore how the Organisation works to support the culture, health and wellbeing sector across England, as well as some case studies of organisations that are helping to tackle the key social challenges of our time, from climate change to health equity.\n\nGraduated in Literature at the University of Lausanne, Isabella then works at the Cultural Services of the City of Bologna and the City of Lausanne, and holds a mandate at Christie's International auction house in Geneva and Lugano.\n\nShe obtains a Master's degree in Educational Services for the Artistic Heritage, Historical Museums and Visual Arts at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore of Milan.\n\nScientific collaborator of the Department of Cultural Activities, she is also in charge of structuring the Educational Activities Sector.\n\nIn this field she is in charge of planning and coordinating didactic and educational activities for visual arts, ethnic arts, theater and the Historical Archives.\n\nFor the Museo delle Culture curates annually, the educational project exhibition and publishing \"Dèibambini\", dedicated to the relationship between ethnic arts, child creativity and pedagogy.\n\nIn 2014 she has the task of structuring the educational offer of the future cultural center LAC Lugano e cultura, which will give life to the project LAC edu and, from the following year, she is appointed head of cultural mediation activities of the LAC.\n\nCulture as an engine of inclusion and well-being. The example of LAC edu\n\nSaturday November 27, 2021, 11:45 – 12:15\n\nSince its inauguration in 2015, LAC Lugano Arte e Cultura has been sensitive to the theme of inclusion, thanks also to the support of the IT Foundation for the Promotion of the Disabled Person (FIPPS), which has made available to the cultural center a person who deals with projects and research in the area of accessibility to culture for all.\n\nOver the years, collaborations have been implemented that embrace different artistic disciplines (art, music, theater, dance), involving the institutions of the territory with moments of meeting and targeted activities.\n\nThe pandemic has also shown the opportunity to activate proposals that would promote wellness through art. It will present the path taken so far and give a glimpse into the future.\n\nCulture as an engine of inclusion and well-being.

Anna Hospital in Turin\n\nSaturday November 27, 2021, 13:30 – 13:50\n\nThe Art of Living. In 2009, the doctors of the S. Anna Hospital in Turin invited civil society to work alongside the institutions, first and foremost the University and the Health Authority, to imagine places of care that respond to the wishes of caregivers, patients and their families.\n\nThe Fondazione Medicina a Misura di Donna (Foundation \"Medicine on a Woman's scale\") was created, whose charter expresses the connection between the Arts, Science and Technology for People's Health. With an action-research project on the virtuous relationship between \"Culture and Health\", the Foundation has contributed to transforming the face and organisational climate of one of the oldest and largest hospitals in Europe dedicated to women.\n\nFrom the history of the Foundation, CCW-Cultural Welfare Center was born, the first centre of competence on the subject in Italy.\n\nA case, which goes beyond the hospital and the city, moves a macro-region and inspires policies.\n\nSparks\n\nSaturday November 27, 2021, 14:00 – 14:20\n\nBorn in 2014 as a result of studies and work experience in the social, artistic and cultural field of its creator and conductor Patrizia Nalbach, mediator, singer and music therapist, Scintille (Sparks) is a project aimed at people with cognitive impairment at the onset of senility, including Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.\n\nIt intends - through Art and the creation of new stories by the participants - to encourage as much as possible the integration of people with dementia, together with their families, in that relational, social and cultural framework that everyone needs to live, according to the cultural realities of the territory and the places of care in it.\n\nMusic in the community\n\nSaturday November 27, 2021, 14:20 – 14:40\n\nThis project is based on a programme of 10 group music sessions involving residents in homes for the elderly and conservatory students, and aims to investigate the experience of the participants and any perceived effects on health and well-being.\n\nEach session was conducted by a teacher from the Conservatorio della Svizzera italiana supported by students who received specific training. The musical activities were based on singing and the use of appropriate percussion instruments. The sessions also included short performances by the students.\n\nAfter a preliminary study involving 20 residents of 6 homes for the elderly in Ticino (average age 84.6) with the aim of exploring how residents access music and what function it plays in their lives, the music programme was implemented in 4 facilities in Ticino, involving 22 residents (average age 83.6) and 9 students in the data collection.\n\nArt therapy in the rehabilitation of the cancer patient\n\nSaturday November 27, 2021, 14:40 – 15:00\n\nThis study aims to compare the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary oncology rehabilitation program and explore participants' subjective experience and perceived benefits through art therapy.\n\nThe study shows that the intervention of art therapy in the context of cancer rehabilitation can help cancer patients with different clinical profiles, different personal characteristics, and needs by implementing a feasible, cost-effective, and efficient tool.\n\nTheatricality meets the world of dementia: TINCONTRONLINE\n\nSaturday November 27, 2021, 15:00 – 15:15\n\nThe project aims to create an innovative practice using theater, breathing and gentle movement techniques for groups of people with Alzheimer's and their family caregivers.\n\nThe TIncontronline project offers online sessions through the proposal of videos based on emotional and body stimulation activities.\n\nThe caregiver and the patient are accompanied to discover a point of view that explores people's behaviors and emotionality.\n\nThe novelty lies in the creation of an amalgam of languages that integrates the communicative and expressive potential of theater with the knowledge and the technical psychotherapeutic look to obtain a precision in the offer and a depth in the work.\n\nNeighbourhood theatre\n\nSaturday November 27, 2021, 15:15 – 15:30\n\nNeighborhood Theater is a play that shares and stages stories of family members and people who live with the condition of neuro-diversity, in a sort of imaginary journey that brought us to significant events that have marked our history.\n\nA journey to discover the mysterious universe of the autistic spectrum, but above all the emotions, desires, dreams in order to feed the hope of a happy life despite the diagnosis.\n\nArt as a means of healing from the wounds that cause us the daily confrontation with the communicative limitation of our children."
