        "text": "Suman from The Philippines\n\nMashed sticky rice cooked in coconut milk and wrapped in banana leaves. Suman sounds good. And, it can be really good if you find the right vendor. The problem with this common sweet treat in The Philippines is that many vendors take short cuts in making it.\n\nSuman made with condensed milk rather than coconut milk, and ordinary rice rather than sticky rice. The result is disappointing.\n\nIf made the traditional way, the Suman is really quite good.\n\nSuman is soft, slightly sticky, but the banana leaf will save your fingers! Suman is almost like a naturally made candy bar.\n\nMore information about Suman\n\nThere’s also a cheaper, albeit by about one peso and harder to find cassava version of the Suman treat. I’ve had both, and can say the sticky rice one wins!\n\nIf you come across Suman, then try to get it while it’s still warm. Mall’s and bakeries are not the best places. Try to find a food stall area and start asking. Hot fresh traditionally made Suman is really good.\n\nThis is an additional post and one of a series highlighting Great food from the Philippines\n\nTravel Blog journals are not always live as they happen. I want to document in writing & photography what's happening to me, and this journey as a whole. I don't have access to 24/7 internet, nor work behind a stationary media desk. And, when I do get online it's not all about writing here.\n\nTwitter is a good place to see my live updates. I have to factor many things into this journey, as such, time and finances to process photos, locate internet, upload and write on the road is prioritized. I do it whenever I can, and as fast as I can. Please take that into account."
