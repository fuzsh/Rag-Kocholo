        "text": "suman, in African religions, and particularly among the Akan people, a votary object that is used as a talisman or charm because of its perceived spiritual energy. A suman might be used to fend off evil spirits, to create protection around the defenseless, or to empower people to achieve something that they did not know they were capable of.\n\nOne receives a suman from a priest who has sanctioned its use as a spiritual object. Thus, it is not something that can be taken from the environment without being sanctified by the proper rituals of the religion. It can be used by diviners, healers, herbalists, and rainmakers to bring about good in the world. It can also be used to create chaos for oneâ€™s enemies."
