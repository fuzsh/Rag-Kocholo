        "text": "The Best Pasalubong Product from Oriental Mindoro!\n\nFilipinos love their “kakanin” or rice cakes usually made with glutinous rice, coconut milk, and sugar. It’s commonly sold in the streets or in “pasalubong” stores, Merl’s Native Delicacies is one of the most popular in Calapan, Oriental Mindoro and they have brought their classic Suman sa Lihiya to Weee!\n\nMerl’s Suman sa Lihiya is a delicacy of a perfected ratio of glutinous rice and lye water. It’s individually hand-packed in wrapped in banana leaves and includes packs of coco jam. It is Merl’s bestseller not only among locals in Mindoro but also at national trade fairs and as “pasalubong” (gifts) among “balikbayans.”\n\nHighly nutritious, unlike other foods oozing with carbs, Merl’s is 100% natural with no preservatives.\n\nMerl's Native Delicacies has been in the business since 2000, for more than 20 years. We are widely known as Suman Sa Lihiya and the #1 Original Pasalubong of Calapan, Oriental Mindoro.\n\nDid we also mention it’s a woman-owned business? Merl, a strong mom of four, started the business with just a kilo of glutinous rice to make Suman sa Lihiya and sells it to the Capalan Public Market for 10 pesos per pack."
