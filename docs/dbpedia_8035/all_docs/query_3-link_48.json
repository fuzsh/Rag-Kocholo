        "text": "Suman’s disputes practice confronts a broad range of issues affecting his clients in both the life and property and casualty industries. In the life re/insurance area, Suman serves as lead trial counsel to several of the largest national life insurance companies in their disputes with reinsurers. In the property and casualty field, Suman serves as lead national counsel for a third-party claims administrator and affiliated reinsurer in the defense of tort and contract actions relating to long-tail asbestos and environmental claims.\n\nFor several years, Chambers USA has listed Suman as a leading attorney in its insurer-side disputes rankings, identifying him as a leader in the industry who is “rapidly building a substantial profile” and someone who “has developed a near-actuary level of understanding of the complex actuarial issues involved” in life reinsurance disputes. Clients have noted that “his true strength is strategy, allowing him to anticipate arguments and to play the game several steps ahead of his adversaries.” His surging reputation has also been recognized in Legal 500, Benchmark Litigation, Who's Who, and Expert Guides.\n\nSuman also devotes his time to serving his community through both pro bono efforts and board service. He currently sits on the Board of the Stonewall Community Foundation. He previously served on the Board of the MCC Theater, one of New York’s leading off-Broadway theater companies, and as Co-Chair of the Board of the National LGBTQ Task Force, the country’s oldest LGBTQ national advocacy organization."
