        "text": "Happy 65th birthday, Madonna. Whether you grew up listening to and loving her music like I did [my favorite song is Express Yourself], you can't deny that Madonna is more than an artist. She is a trailblazer, disruptor, and pro at building a brand. Here are some lessons that I think we could all learn from Madonna: 1. Think Big: no matter how, where or when you start, stick with your goals and dreams and don't stop until you seem them through. 2. Create a Community: Loyalty is hard to build and even harder to keep. Never stop building and maintaining meaningful relationships. Also, make time to give back to your community. 3. Be Fearless: Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. This is where change happens. More importantly, don't wait for someone else to launch your idea. What an inspiring person to celebrate! #Madonna #Marketing #WeWillGetThere\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the work I do is being able speak to the people who think \"I'm all alone\" or \"There must be something wrong with me\" and not only reassure them that they're not and there isn't â€” but support them in building new, sustainable habits that will eventually give way to new, supportive beliefs. ESPECIALLY in the micro-moments that pop up throught the year. This week was Valentine's Day, a day that can seem superficial or just-for-fun. But statistics show that for many people, days like Valentine's Day can sting deeply. What's more, we tend to form opinions about the feelings we feel â€” and then think there's something wrong with us if we can't just *get over* something we think we shouldn't be so invested in. After all, it's \"just for fun.\" We \"shouldn't care so much.\" But we DO. And THIS is why I love doing segments like this one. Self-love can be written off as cheesy, but itâ€™s truly profound. Galentine's (or Pal-entine's) can sound like a gimmick, but in a society that often puts romantic love above all else, it's pretty revolutionary. THANK YOU NBC News Daily for inviting me on again to chat about ways to reframe and reclaim Valentine's Day...which of course makes me think about ways we can do the same for other days that bring up similar feelings, year-round. Care for yourself in practical ways! Give compliments to others with love! If a day comes to unabashedly practice the habits we want to be able to lean on during the rest of the year, we would be wise to take the opportunity and lean into it ðŸ’› https://lnkd.in/dDCs-8ra\n\nMy husband and I celebrated a big milestone last weekend - 22 years of marriage! We spontaneously decided to go for a weekend trip to Collingwood and see a concert. Recognition and celebration are such crucial parts of life yet it's so easy to skip, as we move on to the next thing. Using our anniversary as an example, here are some quick and effective ways to celebrate personal and work accomplishments: 1. Make it spontaneous. Celebrations don't always need a plan - the brain loves fun and novel experiences, and so will you! 2. Make it specific. What are you celebrating? Where? When? How will you celebrate and who are you celebrating with? 3. Make it personal for each participant. Part of our celebration was to see a David Bowie tribute band - my favourite artist. My husband, Phil, is wearing one of the gifts I bought him. Yes, that is the official Ken hoodie from the Barbie movie with an affirmation we should all remember. How do you celebrate milestones? DM me or let me know in the comments! #ChangeWithoutPain #Recognition #IAmKenough #ProfessionalDevelopment #ChangeManagement"
