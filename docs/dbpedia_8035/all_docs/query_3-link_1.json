        "text": "By: Monique Ganzon\n\nSuman is the country’s quintessential rice cake. It is a name shared by many different variants that are all made from glutinous rice cooked in coconut milk, wrapped tightly in palm leaves, and then steamed. It’s quite delicious on its own, but those who like to up that and enjoy it with a sprinkling of sugar. Others even fry it for an even richer version.\n\nIt has been believed by the Filipino rice-farming ancestors that there is nothing better to fill the stomach than rice, grown by farmers with much perseverance and hard work. Filipino women telling stories while wrapping suman has also been an appreciated sight in the Philippines, and is considered part of the very colorful and vibrant culture of the country.\n\nSuman is a popular snack among the Filipinos. It is a rice delicacy made of steamed glutinous rice cooked with salt, wrapped with the leaves of buri palm, or other types of leaves like banana, and then cooked in coconut milk. The rice used may be sweetened or unsweetened.\n\nSuman is traditionally served with sugar for the consumer to dip the rice cake in it. Sometimes, it is also served with fresh ripe mangoes for added flavor. Suman easily fulfills hunger and more often than not, it is heavy in the stomach, making the consumer full in just a few bites of the delectable rice cake.\n\nAlso, suman has long been part of Filipino Christmas celebrations and other celebrations, along with other kakanin variations. Most Filipino homes make it a point to have suman on their tables during various occasions.\n\nMoreover, suman not only gathers Filipinos together, but also symbolizes the gratitude of the people to the blessings of God manifested in nature.\n\nFilipinos have been making the suman since pre-colonial times. We offer it to the gods and as presents to visitors. Antonio Pigafetta, according to Sta. Maria, provides the first description of the rice cakes, which he observed, “was wrapped in leaves and were made in somewhat longish pieces.”\n\nSuman is a rice cake originating from the Philippines. It is made from glutinous rice cooked in coconut milk, and often steamed wrapped in buli or buri palm (Corypha) leaves. It is usually eaten sprinkled with sugar. Suman is also known as budbod in the Visayan languages, which dominate the southern half of the country.\n\nLike the puto, there are numerous varieties of suman in the country. The most popular is called suman sa lihiya, which is comprised of soaked glutinous rice and coconut milk (treated with lye) wrapped in banana leaves and boiled for two hours.\n\nHISTORY\n\nSuman history traces all the way before the arrival of colonizers. Although the Philippines is much influenced by Hispanic and American culture many fields including cuisine, the fundamentals of suman remain the same.\n\nSuman originates from the harvest feasting of early Filipinos before the histories with the Spanish, American, and Japanese colonizers existed. The Tagalog-Spanish dictionary written by Domingo de los Santos in the 1700s even explains that the terms calamay and kakanin as offerings.\n\nSuman, also, has always been present in most Filipinos’ homes during Christmas celebrations. Although our culture has gone through a long process of intermixture with other cultures, the tradition of suman and other kakanin remains and is best manifested during Christmas season and other Filipino celebrations.\n\nSuman is a Filipino delicacy primarily made of sticky rice and coconut milk, and is usually called “rice cake” in English. It is usually seen as the equivalent of the Mexican tamale, though the latter is often made with “masa,” a type of flour, and has some fillings, which suman does not. The rice cake usually has a long, cylindrical or rectangular appearance, though sometimes it takes the shape of a pyramid. It is often wrapped in either palm or banana leaves, both of which impart an aroma to the rice when the wrapping is opened. Suman has been a long-established part of Filipino cuisine and can be eaten as a breakfast meal, snack, or even during fiestas and Christmas celebrations.\n\nIt is uncertain how the suman was invented, but it is not surprising that such a food is created, given that rice is one of the most important foods and crops in the Philippines. It is said that rice cakes can be traced back to the Filipino’s pagan era, before the Spanish and American colonization and their Christian influences. During harvest time, the people would utilize the collected rice and turn into rice dishes called “kakanin,” which include the rice cakes. The cakes would also often be a part of the food offering presented to the spirits and gods, and probably to deceased loved ones as well."
