Later on, Suman represented Rajasthan at Miss India 2019 pageant and won the title as well.\n\n(Photograph: Instagram )\n\nHometown\n\nThe 21-year-old's roots come from Rajasthan's Aaidana village which is near Udaipur. She was born on November 23, 1998, and is currently studying to be a chartered accountant.\n\nSuman's father is a jeweller and her mother is a homemaker. Suman and her family moved to Mumbai when she was one-year-old and studied at Mahatma School of Academics and Sports in Navi Mumbai.\n\n(Photograph: Instagram )\n\nLove for culture\n\nSuman has more than 83 thousand followers on Instagram and she keeps sharing modeling photos on social media.

No surprise here but she aspires to be an actor. Suman is also interested in sports.\n\nShe plays basketball.\n\n(Photograph: Instagram )\n\n;\n\nProject Pragati\n\nSuman feels immensely about gender equality as she previously took initiatives to help tribal women to realise their dreams through financial independence.\n\nHer campaign, 'Project Pragati' trains village women to make handlooms, decorative handicrafts, accessories, and jewellery.\n\nThese products are sold near the Jaipur City Palace and also through an online website.\n\nHer campaign has also received support from the Princess Diya Kumari Foundation.\n\nShe was appreciated at the Miss World forum as she mentioned the same in one of the rounds.\n\n(Photograph: Instagram )"
