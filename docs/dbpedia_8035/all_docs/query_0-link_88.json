        "text": "Shubman Gill IPL factfile\n\n- Shubman Gill was appointed captain of Gujarat Titans (GT) for IPL 2024, his first captaincy stint in the Indian Premier League, after emerging as one of the most promising batting talents in the country.\n\n- Gill was the orange cap winner in IPL 2023 after scoring the second-highest aggregate in a season (890 runs at a strike rate of 157.80 ) in IPL history, for Gujarat Titans.\n\n- He was a key player in Gujarat Titans' title-winning campaign in IPL 2022, when he made 483 runs.\n\n- Before joining GT, Gill was part of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) from 2018 to 2021. He top-scored for KKR in 2020 (440 runs) and once again in their run to the IPL final in 2021 (478 runs), but was not retained by KKR after the 2021 season.\n\nShubman Gill player profile\n\nA right-hand top-order batsman from Punjab, Shubman Gill is known for his penchant for big runs and was hence drafted into India Under-19 side as the vice-captain for the 2018 World Cup. He made his first-class debut before that, for Punjab in the Ranji Trophy in late 2017 with a half-century in the game and an attacking 129 in the next match.\n\nA constant feature in Rahul Dravid's plans for the Under-19 World Cup, Gill constantly played at an age-group level above his. In 2014, he smacked 351 in Punjab's Inter-District Under-16 tournament, and shared a record opening stand of 587 with Nirmal Singh. On his Under-16 state debut for Punjab, he made an unbeaten double-century in the Vijay Merchant Trophy. Later that year, he went on to share the stage with his idol Virat Kohli while receiving a BCCI award for the best junior cricketer, which he won for two successive years: 2013-14 and 2014-15.\n\nWhen picked for the national Under-19 side, he amassed 351 runs in four innings to be named the Man of the Series during the Youth ODI series at home against England. In the reciprocal tour, his first in English conditions, he top-scored once more, with 278 runs in four innings. India swept both series. While he was still in New Zealand for the World Cup on the day of the 2018 IPL auction, Gill was picked by Kolkata Knight Riders for INR 1.8 crore (USD 281,000 approx)."
