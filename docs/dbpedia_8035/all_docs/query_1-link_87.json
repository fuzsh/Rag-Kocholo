        "text": "Indian-born chef Suman Roy is a member of the Toronto Public Health’s Food Policy Council and is on the expert panel of its much talked about “Toronto a la Cart” pilot project, which is calling for street food vendors serving ethnically diverse, nutritious food this spring.\n\nRoy has also received several recognitions such as Hero of Everyday Life and CEO Marketplace Excellence Award from his employer Sodexo Canada, and the President’s Award from the Escoffier Society of Toronto. Roy has also served as a vice-president of Escoffier Society of Canada, a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion of professional chefs and cooks.\n\nWith all these accomplishments, you might think he immigrated to Canada decades ago. In fact, Roy only landed here in 2003.\n\n“I had worked in the United States and thought the transition would be easy if I moved to Canada rather than Australia or New Zealand,” Roy says, recalling his decision to immigrate.\n\nHe was wrong. “It wasn’t that easy,” he says. “I had to start from scratch because my four years of North American experience didn’t mean anything.”\n\nSo he started in a lower position at a downtown restaurant, and took up various jobs from setting up restaurants to managing kitchens. Four years ago, he joined Sodexo Canada, a leader in food and facilities management services. “I travel coast to coast as their executive chef,” he proudly says.\n\nRoy believes he was able to succeed through all the uncertainties of moving to a new country because of his enterprising nature and leadership qualities. “Unless you are innovative and come up with new ideas, you will stay where you started,” he observes.\n\nFor example, he organized Second Harvest, an International Chefs Day event in October 2007 at the Yonge-Dundas Square through the Escoffier Society. It showcased chefs like Roy from around the world and their multicultural cuisine expertise.\n\n“My success is also partly because of following my father’s advice,” Roy says. “He told me that for a living, I should do something that I would be willing to do for free … that is, I must feel passionate about the profession I choose so that I don’t give up [easily].”\n\nAccording to Roy, cooking as a career was not popular in India even in the late 1990s, when he chose to study hotel management and culinary skills. And the curriculum was not geared toward international standards, he believes. So to gain international experience, Roy joined the Marriott Hotels group in Florida in 1997.\n\n“On my first day, the chef gave me a large bowl and asked me to make mashed potatoes and gave me 15 minutes to complete the task,” he says.\n\n“I was shocked. I wondered how can one possibly boil the potatoes, mash them and evenly mix them within that time.” He now laughs at the incident. “I didn’t know it was as simple as opening a bag of powdered potato, adding water and mixing it without lumping up … it was a culture shock for me!”\n\nHis next stint was at the Marriott in Washington D.C., and subsequently for the U.S.S. Sequoia Presidential Yacht.\n\nNot basking in past glory, Roy is now focusing on his Canadian career and how he can make a difference in his community. One of his goals is to assist the City of Toronto in designing its food strategy. “[Access to] food is a right, but we take agriculture for granted,” observes the culinary connoisseur. “We don’t understand the value of food a lot of times … I don’t want my children to grow up thinking cauliflower comes from the supermarket.”\n\nRoy wants to see educating children on food cultivation, urban agriculture and bringing in ethnic diversity in Canadian food as part of the strategy.\n\nIt will be exciting to watch what Roy can accomplish in another five years."
