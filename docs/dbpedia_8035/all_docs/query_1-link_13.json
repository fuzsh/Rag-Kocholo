        "text": "Cuttack: Now, songs of Cuttack-born legendary Bengali singer-songwriter-musician Kabir Suman can be heard in Odia — the language which he spoke first while growing up in Cuttack for six years, before moving to Calcutta and learning Bengali.\n\nThis audio album of 12 most popular songs of Suman translated into Odia is a musical tribute to mark his deep connection with Odisha, especially his birthplace Cuttack and the river Kathajodi which he still loves and reminisces.\n\n“I never thought it would happen. Never even did I dream of it. I started to speak Odia before I spoke Bengali... Only a man born on the banks of a river knows what a river is. Today, as I stare before me and think of my departure, my childhood memories come back to me with the sound of my river Kathajodi,” says Suman.\n\nWhile renowned lyricist Devdas Chhotray has done the lyrical adaptations working upon the translations of the songs provided by director of Indian Institute of Mass Communication-Dhenkanal professor Mrinal Chatterjee, singer Namrata Mohanty who released Nazrul Geeti in Odia early this year, has lent her voice to the album named “Tomake chai (I Want You)”.\n\n“Today, as my life draws towards its end, I revisit in my imagination Cuttack where my senses started to grow, where I gradually became aware of everything. I thank all the good people who are recording my songs in Odia, especially my new found friend Devdas who has done a great job. My heart goes out to them,” adds Suman.\n\nSuman, who worked as a broadcast journalist (senior editor) in the US and Germany for several years and whose songs have already been translated into English in 1994, says further, “This is the first time my songs are being adapted to another language. And I’m so very happy that it is Odia because that was the language that surrounded me when I was born... I told Devdas he should have no qualms about replacing my Bengali culture specific words with words that the people of Odisha could relate to more easily. I find it sparklingly wonderful that he has alluded to the great Akshaya Mohanty for people who live in Odisha will be able to relate to the context of the song.”\n\nSinger Namrata Mohanty, who is an All India Radio (AIR) artiste says, “We had adapted and recorded the most popular song of Suman named Tomake Chai last year with a different music arrangement on experimental basis. We uploaded the song on YouTube and it became very popular. Encouraged by the overwhelming response, we decided to go ahead with a complete studio album of 12 such songs but with the same music arrangement this time which Suman had played himself.”\n\n“It was a great challenge for me to record this album as the lyrics as well as the musical styles are totally different. The words are so powerful and thought-provoking. It took me more than a year to absorb and recreate the songs. Music arranger and sound engineer Nitya Sriranjan has worked very hard to give the best possible output,” she says further.\n\n“While the first nine are transcendental love songs, Protidin Surjyo Otthe is a song of resistance and the last two are pro-life songs of hope and aspiration. Tomake Chai is apparently a love song but more properly it celebrates intrinsic love of a person for his mother tongue,” points out Prof. Chatterjee who has translated the songs into Odia. “Suman’s lyrics are first rate poetry. This is my first attempt in translation of songs, and I must say it proved very difficult. Some of his songs like Jatishwar have a particular cultural context and mythological allusions. These should not be tampered with. I have tried my best to keep them intact,” he adds.\n\nDevdas Chhotray in his prologue voice-over to the album recalls his days in Delhi when he and his mentor late Akshaya Mohanty used to listen to songs of Suman together.\n\n“I’m a strong follower of Suman. His songs and writings have always inspired me. His words, music and voice leave a lasting cinematic experience as one hears them. I have taken care to see that not only the whole poem, but each line of every poem lends meaning. My involvement in this ambitious project is very special,” he says.\n\n“Suman’s songs deserve a far wider audience than what it has received in the two Bengals. Hope the Odia versions set a trend that’s picked up in other parts of our subcontinent. I believe this is significantly more important than getting the songs translated into European languages. I congratulate the musicians of Odisha,” says Dr. Sudipto Chatterjee, Professor in Cultural Studies, Centre for Studies in the Social Sciences, Calcutta.\n\nSongs of Kabir Suman (formerly Suman Chattopadhyay), popularly known as Sumaner Gaan, resurrected, redefined and revolutionised modern Bengali music in the early 90s. His numerous solo albums released by HMV sold like hot cakes. Also known as the Bob Dylan of India, Suman has written, composed, arranged and sung around 1,000 songs. As a one-man band, he also plays all the instruments himself in his recordings and live performances. He is also a celebrated poet, author and political activist."
