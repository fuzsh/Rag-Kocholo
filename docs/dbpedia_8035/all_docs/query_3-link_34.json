        "text": "Suman has been around for centuries, its original name might have been lost to history. Its name is allegedly rooted in an old Spanish phrase for “rice cakes wrapped in leaves, with somewhat longish pieces,” as described by Antonio Pigafetta, the chronicler for the first Spanish expedition to arrive on Philippine shores.Suman’s regional variants, meanwhile, derive their names from the material or method used to wrap them. Suman sa ibus are rice cakes poured into coil-shaped receptacles made out of young palm leaves, which are called “ibus” in Tagalog. The pinagi, on the other hand, was named after the pagi (“stingray” in Tagalog) as a nod to the complex, geometric shape that resembles its namesake.\n\nSuman is the country’s quintessential rice cake. It is a name shared by many different variants that are all made from glutinous rice cooked in coconut milk, wrapped tightly in palm leaves, and then steamed. It’s quite delicious on its own, but those who like to up the ante enjoy it with a sprinkling of sugar. Others even fry it for an even richer version. (If that’s not indulgent enough for you, Fely J’s in Greenbelt 5 makes a mean dessert withsuman, ripe mangoes, and macapuno ice cream).\n\nLike the puto, there are numerous varieties of suman in the country. The most popular is called suman sa lihiya, which is comprised of soaked glutinous rice and coconut milk (treated with lye) wrapped in banana leaves and boiled for two hours.\n\nSOURCE: http://www.pepper.ph/"
