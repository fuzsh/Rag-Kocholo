        "text": "A cake with Aayush's name written on it was placed beside the picture. Shekhar shared the video and said, \"Alka n i lost our angel Aayush who was born on the 3rd of April.We miss him terribly n yearn for him.Remembering him with lots of love.plz keep him in ur prayers.\"\n\nLast month, Shekhar shared a picture of Aayush while speaking about memories and pain. \"With my elder son Aayush on the sets of my second film after Utsav at the film city. #beautiful memories #throwback,\" he captioned the picture of Aayush. Replying to a fan who spoke about the difficulty of revisiting old pictures, Shekhar said, \"The pain is unbearable..Life can be so cruel at times.\"\n\nShekhar also has another son, actor Adhyayan Suman, who was recently the target of fake news. False reports claimed Adhyayan had taken a drastic step and ended his life. However, it was later revealed that Adhyayan was alright. Reacting to the untrue claims, an angry Shekhar said, \"My wife was inconsolable as they announced that Adhyayan Suman has committed suicide.Adhyayan was in Delhi.\" He added, \"While I'm taking legal action against them and suing them for such a reprehensible act.The media ought to be more responsible and not jeopardize ppl's lives and destroy them for their own vested interest.\"\n\nAlso Read: Azeem Khan takes 'full accountability' of split with Saba Qamar, says she had 'the most amazing soul'\n\nShekhar has been actively voicing his support towards the investigation in Sushant Singh Rajput's death case. The actor, in several tweets, has extended his support to his family. Speaking to a leading daily last year, Shekhar explained, \"Sushant was like a son to me. I can understand his fatherâ€™s pain. This is because just like him, my son Adhyayan too has suffered depression and has gone through a similar phase. The film industry created several hurdles for him. Once, he even told me that he was having suicidal thoughts.\""
