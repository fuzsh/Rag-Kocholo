        "text": "Suman is the country’s quintessential rice cake. It is a name shared by many different variants that are all made from glutinous rice cooked in coconut milk, wrapped tightly in palm leaves, and then steamed. It’s quite delicious on its own, but those who like to up that and enjoy it with a sprinkling of sugar. Others even fry it for an even richer version.\n\nIt has been believed by the Filipino rice-farming ancestors that there is nothing better to fill the stomach than rice, grown by farmers with much perseverance and hard work. Filipino women telling stories while wrapping suman has also been an appreciated sight in the Philippines, and is considered part of the very colorful and vibrant culture of the country.\n\nSuman is a popular snack among the Filipinos. It is a rice delicacy made of steamed glutinous rice cooked with salt, wrapped with the leaves of buri palm, or other types of leaves like banana, and then cooked in coconut milk. The rice used may be sweetened or unsweetened.\n\nSuman is traditionally served with sugar for the consumer to dip the rice cake in it. Sometimes, it is also served with fresh ripe mangoes for added flavor. Suman easily fulfills hunger and more often than not, it is heavy in the stomach, making the consumer full in just a few bites of the delectable rice cake.\n\nAlso, suman has long been part of Filipino Christmas celebrations and other celebrations, along with other kakanin variations. Most Filipino homes make it a point to have suman on their tables during various occasions.\n\nMoreover, suman not only gathers Filipinos together, but also symbolizes the gratitude of the people to the blessings of God manifested in nature.\n\nFilipinos have been making the suman since pre-colonial times. We offer it to the gods and as presents to visitors. Antonio Pigafetta, according to Sta. Maria, provides the first description of the rice cakes, which he observed, “was wrapped in leaves and were made in somewhat longish pieces.”\n\nSuman is a rice cake originating from the Philippines. It is made from glutinous rice cooked in coconut milk, and often steamed wrapped in buli or buri palm (Corypha) leaves. It is usually eaten sprinkled with sugar. Suman is also known as budbod in the Visayan languages, which dominate the southern half of the country.\n\nLike the puto, there are numerous varieties of suman in the country. The most popular is called suman sa lihiya, which is comprised of soaked glutinous rice and coconut milk (treated with lye) wrapped in banana leaves and boiled for two hours."
