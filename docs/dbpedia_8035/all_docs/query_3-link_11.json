        "text": "Suman is a Filipino snack (or merienda) that’s made of glutinous rice and coconut milk, wrapped in banana leaves and steamed to sticky perfection. Eat it with mangoes in the summer or dip it in tsokolate in the winter. Delicious!\n\n(To learn how to make tsokolate or Filipino hot chocolate, check this out. Tsokolate is simple and straightforward but its intense chocolate flavour will win you over. Puto or Filipino steamed rice cakes also go well with tsokolate. Bibingkang malagkit is a beloved Filipino rice snack too. So good!)\n\nAsians (and I think Filipinos, especially) love rice. We eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We make rice desserts and snacks. We just can’t get enough of it!\n\nSuman (pronounced soo-man) is a personal favourite.\n\nI grew up eating it after mass and at my grandparents house as a special treat.\n\nRestaurants would later realize its national significance and began serving it plated all fancy with special sauces and toppings.\n\nSimple is always best though and this is what this recipe is all about. Classic and traditional.\n\nSo if you miss the suman from Antipolo or grew up eating suman Tagalog like me, you will absolutely love this.\n\nWhat is suman?\n\nSuman is a rice cake made from glutinous rice cooked in coconut milk (gata) until al dente. They are then wrapped in banana leaves and steamed until fully cooked and sticky.\n\nDepending on the kind you’re making, it’s usually eaten sprinkled with sugar, dipped in chocolate, with ripe mango, or on its own.\n\nWhat are the different types of suman?\n\nThe Philippines is a country that’s composed of more than 7,000 islands and there are different kinds of suman depending on which part of the country you’re from.\n\nSome examples include:\n\nSuman Tagalog (also called suman malagkit or suman sa gata) is what we have here today.\n\nSuman sa lihiya (or suman latik) has lye water in it so it’s more tender and has a greenish tint to it. It’s topped with coco jam or latik.\n\nSuman budbud is similar to suman Tagalog but stuffed with chocolate.\n\nSuman Ilonggo is closer to what we call biko in Tagalog and is made with dark brown or muscovado sugar. In that part of the country, suman is called ibos.\n\nSuman Ilocano (also called patupat or balisungsung) has the same ingredients as suman malagkit and prepared similarly too, but shaped into cones and not rolled.\n\nCassava suman, on the other hand, is made with grated cassava or kamoteng kahoy instead of rice.\n\nAnd the list goes on.\n\nHow to make\n\nMaking this delicious Filipino rice cake involves several steps but they are all easy ones. And the reward at the end is more than worth it.\n\n1. PREP RICE. First you want to soak your glutinous rice in water for at least 2 hours. Soaking will make your suman fluffier and softer.\n\n2. COOK RICE. Once that’s done, drain and transfer the rice to a pot with coconut milk, granulated sugar and salt. Bring this to a boil then lower heat to a simmer. Stir often to prevent your rice from burning at the bottom. Cook until the rice has absorbed almost all of the liquid, about 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n3. LET SIT. Remove the pot from heat and let it sit for another 10-15 minutes to allow the rice to cool.\n\n4. PREP BANANA LEAVES. In the meantime, you can get your banana leaves ready.\n\nWe usually buy banana leaves frozen so once they are thawed, wash them thoroughly, dry them and cut them into rectangular shapes of equal sizes (I make mine roughly 7×8 inches).\n\nTo make them more pliable, heat the leaves over an open flame but be careful not to burn them.\n\nIf you have an electric stove, you can set your oven to low broil and place 1-2 leaves in the oven at a time for about 30 seconds then bring out.\n\n5. WRAP RICE IN BANANA LEAVES. Put 2-3 heaping tablespoons of rice in each banana leaf and roll tightly. Seal by folding the edges. Tie with a banana leaf “string” to keep the banana leaf in place (scroll below for step-by-step photos).\n\n6. STEAM. Place your suman in a steamer and steam for about an hour to allow the rice to fully cook. Remove from steamer and allow to cool and dry slightly before unwrapping.\n\nIngredients\n\nTo make suman, you’ll need:\n\nGlutinous or sticky rice (sometimes also called sweet rice)\n\nCoconut milk (make sure you’re getting milk and not cream)\n\nGranulated sugar\n\nSalt\n\nBanana leaves (optional, see FAQs)\n\nWe can usually find all these ingredients in an Asian supermarket though a lot of our local grocery stores carry them as well now. You can find coconut milk in the Asian aisle and the banana leaves in the frozen section.\n\nA steamer would certainly be useful when making suman (ours look something like this ) but if you don’t have one, there are hacks you can try. Like this one.\n\nIn addition to a steamer, you just need a pot, something to stir the rice with (we prefer a wooden spoon) and kitchen scissors to cut the banana leaves with.\n\nHow to wrap in banana leaves\n\nDifferent people wrap suman differently. This is how my grandma does it, this is how my dad does it, so this is how we do it as well.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nThis recipe is not overly sweet. It’s perfect with mangoes or hot chocolate. You can also dip it in sugar if you like.\n\nHowever you want to enjoy them, suman is delicious! They always make an appearance in special occasions like Christmas Eve (Noche Buena) and New Year’s Eve (Media Noche).\n\nEverybody loves them; hope you do too.\n\nOther delicious Filipino recipes\n\nFilipino recipes are simple but so delicious. Give it a try!\n\nChamporado or Filipino chocolate rice porridge is a traditional Filipino breakfast. Made with sticky rice and pure cacao tablets, it’s rich, creamy and very chocolatey; just the kind of boost we need in the morning!\n\nEveryone knows and loves pancit canton. It’s the Filipino equivalent of Chinese chow mein and it’s said to bring good luck!\n\nHave you ever tried pandesal? It’s the quintessential Filipino bread roll. It’s crunchy outside, soft and fluffy inside, perfect with butter or dipped in your morning coffee.\n\nEnd your meals on a sweet note with buko pandan. It’s a sweet and refreshing Filipino dessert made of coconut, pandan-infused gelatine and sweetened cream.\n\nHappy cooking!\n\nDid you make this Filipino sticky rice cake recipe?
