        "text": "Today, join us as we sit down with Suman Dangol, our newly promoted Restaurant & Bar Manager. Weâ€™ll delve into his motivations for moving to Tasmania and uncover the origins of his passion for food and beverage.\n\nQ: Where were you born, or where did you grow up?\n\nI was born and raised in the capital of Nepal, Kathmandu, and left there when I was 19 years old.\n\nQ: When did you move to Australia, and what motivated you to make this move?\n\nI moved to Australia last year on 1 September 2023. The reason behind this move to Tasmania is my wife. After a decade of a long-distance relationship, we finally got married in 2022. She was living in Australia, and I was in Dubai. One of us had to leave everything behind to start a new chapter, and that person was me (ðŸ˜‰)\n\nQ: How long have you been in the F&B management role? Tell us about your career background, any career highlights or countries you have worked prior to Mr. Good Guy.\n\nIâ€™ve been in the hospitality industry for over 13 years now, starting my journey in May 2010 as a banquet waiter in a five-star property in Kathmandu. Now, as the Restaurant & Bar Manager at Mr. Good Guy, itâ€™s been quite the adventure.\n\nMy career has taken me to various countries, including India, Thailand, and the U.A.E., where Iâ€™ve embraced different roles. In my previous position, I served as the Bar Manager for Solutions Leisure Group in Dubai, overseeing venues like ULA, STK, and Koyo. A significant milestone in my career was being among the final eight contenders for the Catererâ€™s Bartender of the Year award in 2019 for GCC countries while working as the Head Mixologist for Treehouse at Taj Dubai!\n\nQ: When you were younger, what inspired you to pursue a career in Food and Beverage and why?\n\nIn my younger years, I initially aspired to become a chef. However, the allure of the glamorous hospitality industry led me to work in the front of the house. Dubaiâ€™s booming hospitality scene attracted me when I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Hotel Management. I joined Taj Dubai at the age of 21 as a bartender and spent eight years there, chasing my career. Throughout those years, I had the privilege of meeting inspiring figures, such as Simone Caporale, in the industry, keeping me motivated and driven.\n\nQ: What was your favourite thing to drink when you were younger? Is there a drink or food memory that is dear to you?\n\nAs a child, my favourite drink was banana lassi. In the heart of Kathmandu, thereâ€™s a famous stall that exclusively sells lassi. The lassis there are so fantastic that people wait for hours just to get a glass.\n\nI hold food memories dear because eating engages all five senses, and one memory that stands out is the first time I tried pizza. Growing up in a middle-class family, dining out was a rare treat. When I finished Grade Four, my mum took us to one of the fanciest restaurants in Kathmandu. Thatâ€™s when I had pizza for the first time, and it became my favourite until I grew up.\n\nQ: The drinks list at Mr. Good Guy has a lot of Asian influences. What is your favourite tipple on the drinks list and what dish would you enjoy it with?\n\nWhile all the drinks are excellent, if I have to choose one, it would undeniably be the Asian Fashioned. As a whisky and classic old-fashioned lover, this drink is exceptional. Since itâ€™s a twist on an old fashioned with some spices, the Malaysian seafood curry is the best pairing from Mr. Good Guy menu.\n\nQ: What is your favourite dish on the Mr. Good Guy menu and why?\n\nUndoubtedly, Beef Rendang takes the crown as my favourite from our menu. With melt-in-your-mouth tender meat and a wonderfully complex-flavoured sauce, itâ€™s the king of all curries. My first encounter with Beef Rendang was in Bali, Indonesia, at a local cafeteria recommended by my travel guide. Since that moment, it has held a special place as one of my all-time favourite dishes.\n\nWhen I joined Mr. Good Guy, the first dish I sampled from the menu was also the Beef Rendang, and I was delighted to find it authentic and perfectly cooked. Kudos to the chef for maintaining the excellence of this dish on our menu.\n\nQ: Where would you love to travel next to try the food?\n\nGreek cuisine fascinates me the most, and Athens is on my bucket list. I canâ€™t wait to savour Souvlaki with tzatziki, sipping Assyritko. I wish I could make it this year!"
