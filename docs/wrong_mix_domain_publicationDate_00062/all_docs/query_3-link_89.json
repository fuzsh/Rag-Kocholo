        "text": "When and why did you begin writing?\n\nI began writing in 2011 when I was eleven. I started just randomly getting ideas that should have happened in a Tv show or a movie. I then started writing on Quotev (at that time, I didn’t know most sites, and wasn’t into Wattpad, like most are). I soon came to love writing, and in November 2013, I started The Runners Series, my first novel written without fanfics to help. I started Nanowrimo that year also. It was a stressful,and fun year!\n\nDo you work to an outline or plot sketch, or do you prefer to let a general idea guide your writing?\n\nDepends on what I’m writing, or my idea. Most of the time, I freestyle it, but sometimes I outline different things that would happen (especially if I’m working on a series or trilogy).\n\nWhat advice would you give to aspiring authors?\n\nOne is that it’s not easy, no matter who tells you it is, so don’t fool yourself.\n\nWriting is something that you have to have a love for doing. Many authors will tell you it’s a job, it’s the money that counts. Well, they’re lying. Writing is something you need to love to make a good story.\n\nSee, anyone can write words on a paper, but people who write a story have a special connection. Second, if you’re writing for money and not writing for the love of writing, then this isn’t your thing. But my main advice is don’t give up. My first draft no one could read, it was all gibberish, and everywhere. When I went back to editing and working it into what it is today, I was laughing and crying, and wanting to kick myself, but I came out of it and you all can too.\n\nIf your book was made into a movie, who would you cast?\n\nOctavia spencer as Lila.\n\nBrenton Thwaites as ‘Nat’han\n\nGeorgie Henley or Olya Snagoshenko as Asa\n\nGage Golightly as (Older Tara)\n\nIsabelle Fuhrman as (Emily)\n\nBrandon Tyler Russell as Taren\n\nJohn Harlan Kim as Ki\n\nKellan Lutz as Izotz.\n\nCameron Bright as Jas\n\nCaitriona Balfe as Asa’s Mother\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about writing this book?\n\nThe Wanderer was just the start of the series, I honestly enjoyed writing the scene in Ki’s house. I don’t want to spoil anything, but it was fun writing the scene!\n\nWhat is your next project?\n\nThe Maker, and I also have the third book in The Runners Series, which I can’t talk about yet, but it’s going to be interesting!\n\nIs there anything you find particularly challenging in your writing?\n\nI find that sticking to one plot is pretty hard. Sometimes, I’m like ‘oh that would be good, oh someone would hate me for this,’ or ‘I love this plot twist!’ But then I have to think about how the character and story line would fit in.\n\nWhat do you like to read in your free time?\n\nI love a good action-packed novel, whether it’s dystopian, aliens, or a good kick-butt, sassy pants, one.\n\nWho or what inspires your writing?\n\nThat’s a hard one, not to choose one, but to Choose ONE. First would have to be, my family, my friends, and my readers/fans.\n\nAnd second, would be life. It is so amazing and yet extraordinarily weird.\n\nTell us something unique about you?\n\nI love to body paint, like the contestants on the Tv show, Skin Wars. I enjoy creating pictures!\n\nHow can you connect with Laura?\n\nWebsite | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Goodreads | Amazon Author Page"
