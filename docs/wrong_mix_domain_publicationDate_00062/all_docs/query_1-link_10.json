        "text": "During these trying days of social distancing, self-isolating and quarantines, days rife with fear and anxiety, my colleagues and I thought you might like some company. So each day we will be introducing you to poets we have met over the years. The only contagion they will expose you to is a measure of joy, reflection and meditation brought on by “the best words in the best order.”\n\nEnjoy.\n\n— Bill Moyers\n\nIn this clip from Bill’s 1999 interview with poet, essayist and writer Marge Piercy, she reads her poem “To Be of Use” and talks about how poems come to her and the connections between us, observing that “attention is love.”\n\n“To Be of Use”\n\nThe people I love the best\n\njump into work head first\n\nwithout dallying in the shallows\n\nand swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.\n\nThey seem to become natives of that element,\n\nthe black sleek heads of seals\n\nbouncing like half-submerged balls.\n\nI love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart,\n\nwho pull like water buffalo, with massive patience,\n\nwho strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward,\n\nwho do what has to be done, again and again.\n\nI want to be with people who submerge\n\nin the task, who go into the fields to harvest\n\nand work in a row and pass the bags along,\n\nwho are not parlor generals and field deserters\n\nbut move in a common rhythm\n\nwhen the food must come in or the fire be put out.\n\nThe work of the world is common as mud.\n\nBotched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust.\n\nBut the thing worth doing well done\n\nhas a shape that satisfies, clean and evident.\n\nGreek amphoras for wine or oil,\n\nHopi vases that held corn, are put in museums\n\nbut you know they were made to be used.\n\nThe pitcher cries for water to carry\n\nand a person for work that is real.\n\nPoet Marge Piercy was born into a working-class home in Detroit. Hard times produced strong convictions and loyalties. Her prose and poetry speak of memory and justice. But she writes of other things, too — tomatoes, zucchinis and oak trees, and circles on the water.\n\nWatch Bill’s entire interview with Piercy from 1999."
