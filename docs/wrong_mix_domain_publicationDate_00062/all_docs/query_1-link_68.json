        "text": "Marge Piercy (1936- )\n\nMarge Piercy is an American novelist, essayist, and poet best known for fiction with a feminist slant. Her writing stems from a political commitment that began in the 1960s in the Vietnam anti-war movement.\n\nHer early novels, such as \"Small Changes\"(1973), have been used as historical documents in women's studies'courses. Often her protagonists, like Connie in \"Woman on the Edge of Time\"(1976), are women trying to establish some control over worlds that are increasingly restrictive. Her latest novel, \"He, She, and It\", was published in 1991.\n\nLike her novels, her poetry--such as \"The Moon Is Always Female\"(1980) --explores feminism and feminity."
