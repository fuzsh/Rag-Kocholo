        "text": "It's my favorite month of the year, National Poetry Month, and I disagree with Eliot's claim about April, even though itwas written in irony, but his Wasteland is one of my favorite poems of all.\n\nI don't have a favorite poem because that would be like choosing which appendage would be best to keep, but if pressed, I could come up with a top ten, ranging from Homer to Billy Collins.\n\nOne of my top ten favorites for its staying power is Yeats' \"The Second Coming.\" Unfortunately, its theme never seems to feel dated.\n\nHere it is:\n\nThe Second Coming\n\nby W. B. Yeats\n\nTurning and turning in the widening gyre\n\nThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;\n\nThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\n\nMere anarchy is loosed upon the world,\n\nThe blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere\n\nThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;\n\nThe best lack all conviction, while the worst\n\nAre full of passionate intensity.\n\nSurely some revelation is at hand;\n\nSurely the Second Coming is at hand.\n\nThe Second Coming! Hardly are those words out\n\nWhen a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi\n\nTroubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert\n\nA shape with lion body and the head of a man,\n\nA gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,\n\nIs moving its slow thighs, while all about it\n\nReel shadows of the indignant desert birds.\n\nThe darkness drops again; but now I know\n\nThat twenty centuries of stony sleep\n\nWere vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,\n\nAnd what rough beast, its hour come round at last,\n\nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\n\n...and here's an interactive link to the poem at The Academy of American Poets, poets.org:\n\nhttp://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15527\n\nPost one of your top ten poems here. I'd love to know which poets have touched the most people.\n\nI hope all of you have a wonderful April, brimming with excellent words.\n\nTO ELSIE\n\nby William Carlos Williams\n\nThe pure products of America\n\ngo crazy—\n\nmountain folk from Kentucky\n\nor the ribbed north end of\n\nJersey\n\nwith its isolate lakes and\n\nvalleys, its deaf-mutes, thieves\n\nold names\n\nand promiscuity between\n\ndevil-may-care men who have taken\n\nto railroading\n\nout of sheer lust of adventure—\n\nand young slatterns, bathed\n\nin filth\n\nfrom Monday to Saturday\n\nto be tricked out that night\n\nwith gauds\n\nfrom imaginations which have no\n\npeasant traditions to give them\n\ncharacter\n\nbut flutter and flaunt\n\nsheer rags—succumbing without\n\nemotion\n\nsave numbed terror\n\nunder some hedge of choke-cherry\n\nor viburnum—\n\nwhich they cannot express—\n\nUnless it be that marriage\n\nperhaps\n\nwith a dash of Indian blood\n\nwill throw up a girl so desolate\n\nso hemmed round\n\nwith disease or murder\n\nthat she'll be rescued by an\n\nagent—\n\nreared by the state and\n\nsent out at fifteen to work in\n\nsome hard-pressed\n\nhouse in the suburbs—\n\nsome doctor's family, some Elsie—\n\nvoluptuous water\n\nexpressing with broken\n\nbrain the truth about us—\n\nher great\n\nungainly hips and flopping breasts\n\naddressed to cheap\n\njewelry\n\nand rich young men with fine eyes\n\nas if the earth under our feet\n\nwere\n\nan excrement of some sky\n\nand we degraded prisoners\n\ndestined\n\nto hunger until we eat filth\n\nwhile the imagination strains\n\nafter deer\n\ngoing by fields of goldenrod in\n\nthe stifling heat of September\n\nSomehow\n\nit seems to destroy us\n\nIt is only in isolate flecks that\n\nsomething\n\nis given off\n\nNo one\n\nto witness\n\nand adjust, no one to drive the car\n\nAt the Fishhouses\n\nAlthough it is a cold evening,\n\ndown by one of the fishhouses\n\nan old man sits netting,\n\nhis net, in the gloaming almost invisible,\n\na dark purple-brown,\n\nand his shuttle worn and polished.\n\nThe air smells so strong of codfish\n\nit makes one's nose run and one's eyes water.\n\nThe five fishhouses have steeply peaked roofs\n\nand narrow, cleated gangplanks slant up\n\nto storerooms in the gables\n\nfor the wheelbarrows to be pushed up and down on.\n\nAll is silver: the heavy surface of the sea,\n\nswelling slowly as if considering spilling over,\n\nis opaque, but the silver of the benches,\n\nthe lobster pots, and masts, scattered\n\namong the wild jagged rocks,\n\nis of an apparent translucence\n\nlike the small old buildings with an emerald moss\n\ngrowing on their shoreward walls.\n\nThe big fish tubs are completely lined\n\nwith layers of beautiful herring scales\n\nand the wheelbarrows are similarly plastered\n\nwith creamy iridescent coats of mail,\n\nwith small iridescent flies crawling on them.\n\nUp on the little slope behind the houses,\n\nset in the sparse bright sprinkle of grass,\n\nis an ancient wooden capstan,\n\ncracked, with two long bleached handles\n\nand some melancholy stains, like dried blood,\n\nwhere the ironwork has rusted.\n\nThe old man accepts a Lucky Strike.\n\nHe was a friend of my grandfather.\n\nWe talk of the decline in the population\n\nand of codfish and herring\n\nwhile he waits for a herring boat to come in.\n\nThere are sequins on his vest and on his thumb.\n\nHe has scraped the scales, the principal beauty,\n\nfrom unnumbered fish with that black old knife,\n\nthe blade of which is almost worn away.\n\nDown at the water's edge, at the place\n\nwhere they haul up the boats, up the long ramp\n\ndescending into the water, thin silver\n\ntree trunks are laid horizontally\n\nacross the gray stones, down and down\n\nat intervals of four or five feet.\n\nCold dark deep and absolutely clear,\n\nelement bearable to no mortal,\n\nto fish and to seals . . . One seal particularly\n\nI have seen here evening after evening.\n\nHe was curious about me. He was interested in music;\n\nlike me a believer in total immersion,\n\nso I used to sing him Baptist hymns.\n\nI also sang \"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.\"\n\nHe stood up in the water and regarded me\n\nsteadily, moving his head a little.\n\nThen he would disappear, then suddenly emerge\n\nalmost in the same spot, with a sort of shrug\n\nas if it were against his better judgment.\n\nCold dark deep and absolutely clear,\n\nthe clear gray icy water . . . Back, behind us,\n\nthe dignified tall firs begin.\n\nBluish, associating with their shadows,\n\na million Christmas trees stand\n\nwaiting for Christmas. The water seems suspended\n\nabove the rounded gray and blue-gray stones.\n\nI have seen it over and over, the same sea, the same,\n\nslightly, indifferently swinging above the stones,\n\nicily free above the stones,\n\nabove the stones and then the world.\n\nIf you should dip your hand in,\n\nyour wrist would ache immediately,\n\nyour bones would begin to ache and your hand would burn\n\nas if the water were a transmutation of fire\n\nthat feeds on stones and burns with a dark gray flame.\n\nIf you tasted it, it would first taste bitter,\n\nthen briny, then surely burn your tongue.\n\nIt is like what we imagine knowledge to be:\n\ndark, salt, clear, moving, utterly free,\n\ndrawn from the cold hard mouth\n\nof the world, derived from the rocky breasts\n\nforever, flowing and drawn, and since\n\nour knowledge is historical, flowing, and flown.\n\nElizabeth Bishop\n\nIt's not often I have the pleasure of reading a poem by someone I know and realizing that I am reading a profound work. My friend Shara McCallum writes such poems. She has three books available, and her latest is This Strange Land, published by Alice James Books. She has been asked to put together a book of selected poems for publication in the near future. Her success was hard won and deserved, and I hope I am introducing her to a wider audience. Here's a poem of Shara's that moved me:\n\nHistory is a Room\n\nThe study of History is the study of Empire.\n\n—Niall Ferguson\n\nI cannot enter.\n\nTo enter that room, I would need to be a man who makes History, not a girl to whom History happened.\n\nMother to two daughters, I guard their lives with hope, a pinch of salt I throw over my shoulder.\n\nTo enter that room, I would need to wield a gun.\n\nHere, I brandish weapons that serve an art my mother and grandmother knew: how to make of plantain and eggs a meal.\n\nTo enter that room, I would need to live in the past, to understand how power is amassed, eclipsing the sun.\n\nBeneath my children's beds, I scatter grains of rice to keep duppy at bay.\n\nTo enter that room, I would need to live in the present: This election. This war.\n\nBeneath my children's pillows, I place worry dolls to ensure their peaceful sleep.\n\nTo enter that room, I would need to bridge the distance between my door and what lies beyond.\n\nStanding in my foyer at dusk, I ask the sea to fill the crevices of this house with its breath.\n\nHistory is recounted by the dead, returned from their graves to walk in shriveled skins.\n\nIn our yard, I watch my daughters run with arms papering the wind.\n\nHistory is recounted by children in nursery rhymes, beauty masking its own violence.\n\nIn my kitchen, I peel an orange, try to forget my thumb must wrest the pulp from its rind.\n\nHistory is recounted in The Book of Explanations: AK-47 begat UZI, which begat M-16 ... and all the days of their lives were long.\n\nPausing at the sink, I think of how a pepper might be cut, blade handled so the knife becomes the fruit slit open, its seeds laid bare.\n\nHistory is recounted in The Book of Beginnings: the storey of a people born of forgetting.\n\nIn our yard, I name the world for my children—praying mantis, robin's egg, maple leaf—words for lives they bring me in their palms.\n\nTo enter that room, I would need to look into the mirror of language, see in collateral damage the faces of the dead.\n\nIn our yard, I sow seeds, planting myself in this soil.\n\nTo enter that room, I would need to uncover the pattern of a life woven onto some master loom.\n\nHere, I set the table, sweep the floor, make deals with the god of small things.\n\nTo enter that room, I would need to be armed with the right question: is History the start of evening or dawn returning the swallow to the sky?\n\nHere, I light candles at nightfall, believe the match waits to be struck.\n\nHere's one by my first poetry professor Dick Allen. Since I sat in his classroom at The University of Bridgeport in 1977 he has gone on to become Connecticut's Poet Laureate and a grand old man in poetry circles. I still picture him in his brown suede jacket with the wishbone tear on its shoulder, flicking cigarette ashes into an ashtray perched on his desk in the classroom. Times were different then:\n\nIf You Get There Before I Do\n\nby Dick Allen\n\nAir out the linens, unlatch the shutters on the eastern side,\n\nand maybe find that deck of Bicycle cards\n\nlost near the sofa. Or maybe walk around\n\nand look out the back windows first.\n\nI hear the view's magnificent: old silent pines\n\nleading down to the lakeside, layer upon layer\n\nof magnificent light. Should you be hungry,\n\nI'm sorry but there's no Chinese takeout,\n\nonly a General Store. You passed it coming in,\n\nbut you probably didn't notice its one weary gas pump\n\nalong with all those Esso cans from decades ago.\n\nIf you're somewhat confused, think Vermont,\n\nthat state where people are folded into the mountains\n\nlike berries in batter. . . . What I'd like when I get there\n\nis a few hundred years to sit around and concentrate\n\non one thing at a time. I'd start with radiators\n\nand work my way up to Meister Eckhart,\n\nor why do so few people turn their lives around, so many\n\ntake small steps into what they never do,\n\nthe first weeks, the first lessons,\n\nuntil they choose something other,\n\nbeginning and beginning their lives,\n\nso never knowing what it's like to risk\n\nlast minute failure. . . .I'd save blue for last. Klein blue,\n\nor the blue of Crater Lake on an early June morning.\n\nThat would take decades. . . .Don't forget\n\nto sway the fence gate back and forth a few times\n\njust for its creaky sound. When you swing in the tire swing\n\nmake sure your socks are off. You've forgotten, I expect,\n\nthe feeling of feet brushing the tops of sunflowers:\n\nIn Vermont, I once met a ski bum on a summer break\n\nwho had followed the snows for seven years and planned\n\non at least seven more. We're here for the enjoyment of it, he said,\n\nto salaam into joy. . . .I expect you'll find\n\nBibles scattered everywhere, or Talmuds, or Qur'ans,\n\nas well as little snippets of gospel music, chants,\n\nold Advent calendars with their paper doors still open.\n\nYou might pay them some heed. Don't be alarmed\n\nwhen what's familiar starts fading, as gradually\n\nyou lose your bearings,\n\nyour body seems to turn opaque and then transparent,\n\nuntil finally it's invisible--what old age rehearses us for\n\nand vacations in the limbo of the Middle West.\n\nTake it easy, take it slow. When you think I'm on my way,\n\nthe long middle passage done,\n\nfill the pantry with cereal, curry, and blue and white boxes of macaroni, place the\n\ncheckerboard set, or chess if you insist,\n\nout on the flat-topped stump beneath the porch's shadow,\n\npour some lemonade into the tallest glass you can find in the cupboard,\n\nthen drum your fingers, practice lifting your eyebrows,\n\nuntil you tell them all--the skeptics, the bigots, blind neighbors,\n\nthose damn-with-faint-praise critics on their hobbyhorses--\n\nthat I'm allowed,\n\nand if there's a place for me that love has kept protected,\n\nI'll be coming, I'll be coming too.\n\nHere's one by my friend John Oliver Simon for his friend, the poet Donald Schenker, who died from cancer. I \"met\" John years ago on a raucous poetry workshop board at AOL. We have kept in touch for over a decade. He will be celebrating his 70th birthday in May. John spent his youth hanging around with poets in Berkeley and San Francisco such as Gary Snyder, Robert Duncan, Jack Spicer, and Lew Welch I want to think John is one of the best poets no one knows. This poem made me fall in love with his work:\n\nALL OVER THE PLACE\n\nfor Donald Schenker\n\nDon says there's poems all over the place\n\nit's practically embarrassing, and I nod\n\nwithout enthusiasm, driving into downtown\n\nOakland thinking yeah, those two pigeons\n\nsquatting on the blue-gray sign HOTEL MORO,\n\nhow the part of it that's a poem could fall out\n\nbetween the word and the bird, or the word Moro\n\nall the way back to the reconquest of Spain\n\nand all the bloody hemisphere ending up\n\non this block I don't care if I see again.\n\nDon says he could just stop anyone\n\nand look at them, they're all so deep\n\nand beautiful, and I say what's interesting\n\nis the stories they all carry around\n\nstranger than fiction, stronger than truth\n\nall these gente waiting to cross the street\n\neach one forgetting their great-grandparents\n\neach one forgetting to tell their children\n\nand I'm no novelist, I can't move a\n\ncharacter across the room, much less two guys\n\nto lunch at a Vietnamese place on Webster.\n\nOver bowls of translucent noodles and odd meat\n\nDon says he always felt like the other poets\n\nwere the big boys, and I see how the grand\n\nfamous names of his peers, now pushing sixty\n\nhave turned into the padded artifacts\n\nof their own careers, while Don's obscurity\n\nhas kept him fresh and sweet, and Don says\n\nhe loves his tumors, the big one that hurts\n\nin his left hip, the one that's hammering out\n\namong sparse hairs inside his baseball cap,\n\nand though it's his own death that gives him truth\n\nI'm stuck in my heart without any words\n\nwhile poems in Vietnamese are fluttering up\n\nfrom all the restaurant tables around us\n\nand escaping into so much empty light.\n\nHere's a link to an interview with John about his poetry, his teaching of poetry in the schools, and his journeys through South America, intent on the art of translation: http://www.thiszine.org/interviews/simon-interview-full\n\nHere's another for you, Joani. This might be my favorite poem. It has everything you want in a poem. It's clear, meaningful, and powerful. Only a master can write like this.\n\nLocking Yourself Out, Then Trying to Get Back In\n\n--Raymond Carver\n\nYou simply go out and shut the door\n\nwithout thinking. And when you look back\n\nat what you’ve done\n\nit’s too late. If this sounds\n\nlike the story of life, okay.\n\nIt was raining. The neighbors who had\n\na key were away. I tried and tried\n\nthe lower windows. Stared\n\ninside at the sofa, plants, the table\n\nand chairs, the stereo set-up.\n\nMy coffee cup and ashtray waited for me\n\non the glass-topped table, and my heart\n\nwent out to them. I said, Hello, friends,\n\nor something like that. After all,\n\nthis wasn’t so bad.\n\nWorst things had happened. This\n\nwas even a little funny. I found the ladder.\n\nTook that and leaned it against the house.\n\nThen climbed in the rain to the deck,\n\nswung myself over the railing\n\nand tried the door. Which was locked,\n\nof course. But I looked in just the same\n\nat my desk, some papers, and my chair.\n\nThis was the window on the other side\n\nof the desk where I’d raise my eyes\n\nand stare out when I sat at that desk.\n\nThis is not like downstairs, I thought.\n\nThis is something else.\n\nAnd it was something to look in like that, unseen,\n\nfrom the deck. To be there, inside, and not be there.\n\nI don’t even think I can talk about it.\n\nI brought my face close to the glass\n\nand imagined myself inside,\n\nsitting at the desk. Looking up\n\nfrom my work now and again.\n\nThinking about some other place\n\nand some other time.\n\nThe people I had loved then.\n\nI stood there for a minute in the rain.\n\nConsidering myself to be the luckiest of men.\n\nEven though a wave of grief passed through me.\n\nEven though I felt violently ashamed\n\nof the injury I’d done back then.\n\nI bashed that beautiful window.\n\nAnd stepped back in.\n\nSTANDING AMID THE EXECRATIONS OF TIME\n\nten years after Tiananmen\n\nLiu Xiabo\n\n1\n\nTen years ago this day\n\ndawn, a bloody shirt\n\nsun, a torn calender\n\nall eyes upon\n\nthis single page\n\nthe world a single outraged stare\n\ntime tolerates no naivete'\n\nthe dead rage and howl\n\ntill the earth's throat\n\ngrows hoarse\n\nGripping the prison bars\n\nthis moment\n\nI must wail in grief\n\nfor I fear the next\n\nso much I have no tears for it\n\nremembering them, the innocent dead,\n\nI must thrust a dagger calmly\n\ninto my eyes\n\nmust purchase with blindness\n\nclarity of the brain\n\nfor that bone-devouring memory\n\nis best expressed by refusal\n\n2\n\nTen years ago this day\n\nsoldiers stand at attention\n\nposes dignified and correct, trained\n\nto uphold a hideous lie\n\ndawn is a crimson flag\n\nfluttering in the half-light\n\npeople crane and stand on tiptoe\n\ncurious, awed, earnest\n\na young mother\n\nlifts her baby's hand\n\nto salute that sky-eclipsing lie\n\nAnd a white-haired mother\n\nkisses the image of her son\n\ndelicately pries his fingers apart\n\nand washes the blood from his nails\n\nshe can find no soil, not even a handful\n\nin which her son may rest\n\nshe has no choice\n\nbut to hang him on the wall\n\nNow she walks among unmarked graves\n\nhoping to expose the lie of a century\n\nfrom her sealed throat she exhumes\n\nthe long-stifled name\n\nlets her freedom and dignity be\n\na denunciation of amnesia\n\npolice listen on the wiretap\n\nand dog her footsteps\n\n3\n\nThe world's largest square\n\nhas been given a new face\n\nWhen the peasant Liu Bang became\n\nHan Gaozu, founder of a dynasty\n\nhe invented a tale about his mother and a dragon\n\nto inflate his family history\n\nthis ancient pattern continues\n\nfrom the Ming tombs to the Memorial Hall\n\nbutchers lie in state\n\nin resplendent underground palaces\n\nacross millennia, tyrants and autocrats\n\nexchange tips of dagger technique\n\nwhile their entombed vassals\n\noffer obeisance\n\nIn a few months time\n\namid glorious pomp\n\nmurder weapons will roll once again across this square\n\nand the corpse in the Hall\n\nand the butchers dreaming their imperial dreams\n\nwill look on with approval\n\nwhile beneath the earth the Emperor of Qin\n\nreviews his clay troops\n\nStill that old ghost\n\nmulls his past glories\n\nwhile his heirs glut themselves\n\nupon his legacy\n\nwith his blessing they wield scepters of bone\n\nand pray the next century\n\nwill be even better\n\nAmid tanks and flowers\n\nsalutes and daggers\n\namid doves and bullets\n\njackboots and expressionless faces\n\na century concludes in blood-reek and darkness\n\nand a new era begins\n\nwithout a glimmer of life\n\n4\n\nRefuse to eat\n\nrefuse to masturbate\n\npick a book out of the ruins\n\nand admire the humility of the corpse\n\nin a mosquito's innards\n\ndreaming blood-dark dreams\n\npeer through the steel door's peephole\n\nand converse with vampires\n\nno need to be circumspect\n\nyour stomach spasms\n\nwill give you the courage of the dying\n\nretch out a curse\n\nfor fifty years of glory\n\nthere has never been a New China\n\nonly a Party.\n\nLiu Xiabo, presently serving an eleven year sentence in a Chinese Prison for crimes of thought and word.\n\nThe poem here was written when he served a previous sentence in a labor camp, June, 1999.\n\nOne of my favorite volumes of poetry EVER is Peter Handke's \"The Innerworld of the Outerworld of the Innerworld.\" Essential reading as far as I am concerned.\n\nHere's one poem from the volume.\n\n\"Changes during the Course of the Day\"\n\nby Peter Handke\n\nAs long as I am still alone, I am still alone.\n\nAs long as I am still among acquaintances, I am still an acquaintance.\n\nBut as soon as I am among strangers—\n\nAs soon as I step out on the street— a pedestrian steps out on the street.\n\nAs soon as I enter the subway— a subway rider enters the subway\n\nA soon as I enter the jewelry shop— a gentleman enters the jewelry shop.\n\nAs soon as I push the shopping cart through the supermarket— a customer pushes the cart through the supermarket.\n\nAs soon as I enter the department store— someone on a shopping spree enters the department store.\n\nThen I walk past some children— and the the children see an adult walking past. Then I enter the off-limits zone— and the guards see a trespasser enter the off-limits zone. Then I see children running away from me in the off-limits zone— and I become a guard whom the children flee because they are unauthorized persons in an off-limits zone.\n\nThen I sit in the waiting room as an applicant. Then I write my name on the back of the envelope as a sender. Then I fill out the lottery ticket as a winner.\n\nAs soon as I am asked how one gets to Black Road— I become someone who knows his way around town.\n\nAs soon as I see the incredible— I become a witness.\n\nAs soon as I enter the church— I become a layman.\n\nAs soon as I don’t ignore an accident— I become a busy-body.\n\nAs soon as I don’t know how to get to Black Road— I am again someone who doesn’t know his way to Black Road.\n\nI have just consumed the meal— already I can say: We consumers!\n\nI have just had something stolen from me— already I can say: We proprietors!\n\nI have just placed the obituary— already I can say: We mourners!\n\nI have just begun to contemplate the universe— already I can say: We human beings!\n\nI read the novel in the mass publication— and become one among millions.\n\nI don’t fulfill my duties toward the authorities— and am no longer a dutiful citizen of the state.\n\nI don’t run away during the riot— and I’m an inciter of riots.\n\nI look up from the novel I’m reading and observe the beauty opposite me— and we become two among millions.\n\nThen someone does not leave the moving train— someone? — A traveler.\n\nThen someone speaks without an accent— someone? — A native.\n\nThen someone has a vis-à-vis— and becomes a vis-à-vis.\n\nThen someone no longer only plays by himself— and becomes an opponent.\n\nThen someone crawls out from under a thicket in the park and becomes a suspicious subject.\n\nThen someone who is being discussed becomes an object of discussion.\n\nThen someone is recognized on a photo— and becomes an X.\n\nThen someone takes a walk in the country— someone? A wanderer.\n\nAnd when the car makes a sudden stop in front of me— I become an obstacle.\n\nThen I am seen by a figure in the dark— and become a figure in the dark.\n\nAnd when I am then observed through binoculars— I am an object.\n\nThen someone stumbles over me— and I become a body.\n\nAnd when I am then stepped upon— I become something soft.\n\nThen I am wrapped up in something— and become a content.\n\nThen one notices that someone has run barefoot over the dirt road and that a right-hander has fired the shot and that someone whose blood group is O has lain there and that I, judging by the my shabby looks, must be a foreigner.\n\nAs soon as someone challenges me then— the one who’s been challenged doesn’t stop when challenged.\n\nAs soon as I am then far enough away from the observers— the object is nothing but a dot.\n\nAs soon as I, as an observer, challenge someone— I give the one who has been challenged quite a fright.\n\nThen, finally, I meet an acquaintance— and two acquaintances meet.\n\nThen, finally, I am left alone— and a single person remains behind alone.\n\nThen, finally, I sit down next to someone in the grass— and am finally someone else.\n\n--From The Innerworld of the Outerworld of the Innerworld by Peter Handke, translated by Michael Roloff\n\nAfter years of reading and writing poetry I have finally found, via serendipity, the lines I want engraved on my tombstone. The poem is The Idea Of Order At Key West by Wallace Stevens:\n\nShe sang beyond the genius of the sea.\n\nThe water never formed to mind or voice,\n\nLike a body wholly body, fluttering\n\nIts empty sleeves; and yet its mimic motion\n\nMade constant cry, caused constantly a cry,\n\nThat was not ours although we understood,\n\nInhuman, of the veritable ocean.\n\nThe sea was not a mask. No more was she.\n\nThe song and water were not medleyed sound\n\nEven if what she sang was what she heard,\n\nSince what she sang was uttered word by word.\n\nIt may be that in all her phrases stirred\n\nThe grinding water and the gasping wind;\n\nBut it was she and not the sea we heard.\n\nFor she was the maker of the song she sang.\n\nThe ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea\n\nWas merely a place by which she walked to sing.\n\nWhose spirit is this? we said, because we knew\n\nIt was the spirit that we sought and knew\n\nThat we should ask this often as she sang.\n\nIf it was only the dark voice of the sea\n\nThat rose, or even colored by many waves;\n\nIf it was only the outer voice of sky\n\nAnd cloud, of the sunken coral water-walled,\n\nHowever clear, it would have been deep air,\n\nThe heaving speech of air, a summer sound\n\nRepeated in a summer without end\n\nAnd sound alone. But it was more than that,\n\nMore even than her voice, and ours, among\n\nThe meaningless plungings of water and the wind,\n\nTheatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped\n\nOn high horizons, mountainous atmospheres\n\nOf sky and sea.\n\nIt was her voice that made\n\nThe sky acutest at its vanishing.\n\nShe measured to the hour its solitude.\n\nShe was the single artificer of the world\n\nIn which she sang. And when she sang, the sea,\n\nWhatever self it had, became the self\n\nThat was her song, for she was the maker. Then we,\n\nAs we beheld her striding there alone,\n\nKnew that there never was a world for her\n\nExcept the one she sang and, singing, made.\n\nRamon Fernandez, tell me, if you know,\n\nWhy, when the singing ended and we turned\n\nToward the town, tell why the glassy lights,\n\nThe lights in the fishing boats at anchor there,\n\nAs the night descended, tilting in the air,\n\nMastered the night and portioned out the sea,\n\nFixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles,\n\nArranging, deepening, enchanting night.\n\nOh! Blessed rage for order, pale Ramon,\n\nThe maker's rage to order words of the sea,\n\nWords of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,\n\nAnd of ourselves and of our origins,\n\nIn ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds.\n\n(I want these lines: And when she sang, the sea,\n\nWhatever self it had, became the self\n\nThat was her song, for she was the maker. Then we,\n\nAs we beheld her striding there alone,\n\nKnew that there never was a world for her\n\nExcept the one she sang and, singing, made.)\n\nnot my favorite Plath (Fever 103 is my favorite) but I am feeling the fuck out of this one these days...\n\nLesbos\n\nViciousness in the kitchen!\n\nThe potatoes hiss.\n\nIt is all Hollywood, windowless,\n\nThe fluorescent light wincing on and off like a terrible migraine,\n\nCoy paper strips for doors --\n\nStage curtains, a widow's frizz.\n\nAnd I, love, am a pathological liar,\n\nAnd my child -- look at her, face down on the floor,\n\nLittle unstrung puppet, kicking to disappear --\n\nWhy she is schizophrenic,\n\nHer face is red and white, a panic,\n\nYou have stuck her kittens outside your window\n\nIn a sort of cement well\n\nWhere they crap and puke and cry and she can't hear.\n\nYou say you can't stand her,\n\nThe bastard's a girl.\n\nYou who have blown your tubes like a bad radio\n\nClear of voices and history, the staticky\n\nNoise of the new.\n\nYou say I should drown the kittens. Their smell!\n\nYou say I should drown my girl.\n\nShe'll cut her throat at ten if she's mad at two.\n\nThe baby smiles, fat snail,\n\nFrom the polished lozenges of orange linoleum.\n\nYou could eat him. He's a boy.\n\nYou say your husband is just no good to you.\n\nHis Jew-Mama guards his sweet sex like a pearl.\n\nYou have one baby, I have two.\n\nI should sit on a rock off Cornwall and comb my hair.\n\nI should wear tiger pants, I should have an affair.\n\nWe should meet in another life, we should meet in air,\n\nMe and you.\n\nMeanwhile there's a stink of fat and baby crap.\n\nI'm doped and thick from my last sleeping pill.\n\nThe smog of cooking, the smog of hell\n\nFloats our heads, two venemous opposites,\n\nOur bones, our hair.\n\nI call you Orphan, orphan. You are ill.\n\nThe sun gives you ulcers, the wind gives you T.B.\n\nOnce you were beautiful.\n\nIn New York, in Hollywood, the men said: 'Through?\n\nGee baby, you are rare.'\n\nYou acted, acted for the thrill.\n\nThe impotent husband slumps out for a coffee.\n\nI try to keep him in,\n\nAn old pole for the lightning,\n\nThe acid baths, the skyfuls off of you.\n\nHe lumps it down the plastic cobbled hill,\n\nFlogged trolley. The sparks are blue.\n\nThe blue sparks spill,\n\nSplitting like quartz into a million bits.\n\nO jewel! O valuable!\n\nThat night the moon\n\nDragged its blood bag, sick\n\nAnimal\n\nUp over the harbor lights.\n\nAnd then grew normal,\n\nHard and apart and white.\n\nThe scale-sheen on the sand scared me to death.\n\nWe kept picking up handfuls, loving it,\n\nWorking it like dough, a mulatto body,\n\nThe silk grits.\n\nA dog picked up your doggy husband. He went on.\n\nNow I am silent, hate\n\nUp to my neck,\n\nThick, thick.\n\nI do not speak.\n\nI am packing the hard potatoes like good clothes,\n\nI am packing the babies,\n\nI am packing the sick cats.\n\nO vase of acid,\n\nIt is love you are full of. You know who you hate.\n\nHe is hugging his ball and chain down by the gate\n\nThat opens to the sea\n\nWhere it drives in, white and black,\n\nThen spews it back.\n\nEvery day you fill him with soul-stuff, like a pitcher.\n\nYou are so exhausted.\n\nYour voice my ear-ring,\n\nFlapping and sucking, blood-loving bat.\n\nThat is that. That is that.\n\nYou peer from the door,\n\nSad hag. 'Every woman's a whore.\n\nI can't communicate.'\n\nI see your cute décor\n\nClose on you like the fist of a baby\n\nOr an anemone, that sea\n\nSweetheart, that kleptomaniac.\n\nI am still raw.\n\nI say I may be back.\n\nYou know what lies are for.\n\nEven in your Zen heaven we shan't meet.\n\n(Sylvia Plath)\n\nThis poem, \"True Stories,\" by Margaret Atwood, has stayed so monumentally with me through all the years since college.\n\nTrue Stories by Margaret Atwood\n\ni.\n\nDon't ask for the true story;\n\nwhy do you need it?\n\nIt's not what I set out with,\n\nor what I carry.\n\nWhat I'm sailing with,\n\na knife, blue fire,\n\nluck, a few good words\n\nthat still work and the tide.\n\nii.\n\nThe true story was lost\n\non the way down to the beach, it's something\n\nI never had, that black tangle\n\nof branches in a shifting light,\n\nmy blurred footprints\n\nfilling with salt\n\nwater, this handful\n\nof tiny bones, this owl's kill;\n\na moon, crumpled papers, a coin,\n\nthe glint of an old picnic,\n\nthe hollows made by lovers\n\nin sand a hundred\n\nyears ago: no clue\n\niii.\n\nThe true story lies\n\namong the other stories,\n\na mess of colors, like jumbled clothing,\n\nthrown off or away,\n\nlike hearts on marble, like syllables, like\n\nbutchers' discards.\n\nThe true story is vicious\n\nand multiple. and untrue\n\nafter all. Why do you\n\nneed it? Don't ever\n\nask for the true story.\n\nI made a list of all the poems/poets collectively that we posted for the National Poetry Month 2012!!!
