        "text": "Template:BLP sources\n\nMarge Piercy (born March 31, 1936)[1]) is an American poet, novelist, and social activist. She is the author of the New York Times bestseller Gone to Soldiers,[2] a sweeping historical novel set during World War II.\n\nLife[]\n\nPiercy was born in Detroit, Michigan,[1] to a family deeply affected by the Great Depression. An indifferent student in her early years, Piercy developed a love of books when she came down with rheumatic fever in her mid-childhood and could do little but read. \"It taught me that there's a different world there, that there were all these horizons that were quite different from what I could see,\" she said in a 1984 interview.[3]\n\nShe was the 1st in her family to attend college, studying at the University of Michigan.After finishing college she spend some time in France. Her formal schooling ended with an M.A. from Northwestern University.\n\nHer debut collection of poems, Breaking Camp, was published in 1968. As of 2004 she was the author of 17 volumes of poems (among them The Moon is Always Female, considered a feminist classic), as well as 15 novels, a play (The Last White Class, co-authored with her 3rd husband Ira Wood), one collection of essays (Parti-colored Blocks for a Quilt), one nonfiction book, and one memoir.\n\nShe lives in Wellfleet on Cape Cod, Massachusetts with her husband, Ira Wood.\n\nWriting[]\n\nNovels[]\n\nHer novels and poetry often focus on feminist or social concerns, although her settings vary. While Body of Glass (published in the USA as He, She and It) is a science fiction novel that won the Arthur C. Clarke Award, City of Darkness, City of Light is set during the French Revolution. Other of her novels, such as Summer People and The Longings of Women are set during the modern day. All of her books share a focus on women's lives.\n\nWoman on the Edge of Time (1976) mixes a time travel story with issues of social justice, feminism, and the treatment of the mentally ill. This novel is considered a classic of utopian \"speculative\" science fiction as well as a feminist classic. William Gibson has credited Woman on the Edge of Time as the birthplace of Cyberpunk. Piercy tells this in an introduction to Body of Glass.\n\nBody of Glass (He, She and It) (1991) postulates an environmentally ruined world dominated by sprawling mega-cities and a futuristic version of the Internet, through which Piercy weaves elements of Jewish mysticism and the legend of the Golem, although a key story element is the main character's attempts to regain custody of her young son.\n\nMany of Piercyâ€™s novels tell their stories from the viewpoints of multiple characters, often including a first-person voice among numerous 3rd-person narratives. Her World War II historical novel, Gone To Soldiers (1987) follows the lives of 9 major characters in the United States, Europe and Asia. The first-person account in Gone To Soldiers is the diary of French teenager Jacqueline Levy-Monot, who is also followed in a third-person account after her capture by the Nazis.[4]\n\nPoetry[]\n\nPiercy's poetry tends to be highly personal free verse and often addresses the same concern with feminist and social issues. Her work shows commitment to the dream of social change (what she might call, in Judaic terms, tikkun olam, or the repair of the world), rooted in story, the wheel of the Jewish year, and a range of landscapes and settings.\n\nRecognition[]\n\nPiercy won a Hopwood Award for Poetry and Fiction, 1957.\n\nPublications[]\n\nPoetry[]\n\nBreaking Camp.
