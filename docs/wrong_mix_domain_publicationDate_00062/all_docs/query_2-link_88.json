        "text": "Thank you for chatting with us and congratulations! Since every project has a story, what’s the story behind your newest single \"Wanderer\" that released today? “Wanderer” was born organically and has stayed that way through the whole writing, playing, and recording process. From a midnight campfire in the woods where I first wrote the chorus, to my annual February songwriting marathon where I wrote out the rest of the song while recalling that vivid campfire scene, to recording a one-take acoustic demo, to playing it out live with my drummer Troy Pruett, to then having the honor of recording it in studio with producer Billy Smiley and some of the best musicians in Nashville, this song has stayed true to itself. It's become something of an anthem for me that has stayed close to my heart through the ups and downs of my own journey. I'm incredibly excited to see this one out in the wild because it means so much to me. I feel like it's a song that really encapsulates me as an artist. The highs and lows, the raw acoustic backed by a rocking band, the slow-burning crescendo, the vivid story, all of it. It's really just me in a song.\n\nIs there any news for the forthcoming album? I'm an album guy. I love a full length record that takes the listener on a complete journey. But right now I'm focusing my artistry on crafting songs that I can begin to release more regularly than the typical “album every other year” model. I'm a songwriter first and foremost and with fans craving content more regularly I want to be able to do that both for myself and for my listeners. “Wanderer” is the first offering of that new focus. I hope to be able to soon release a new song each month.\n\nIs there anyone in your family that you can credit as being instrumental in your decision to go into the music field?My whole family is musical or loves music. My dad inspired me to learn guitar. My mom encouraged me to write. My brothers are all musical too. We grew up with a living room full of instruments where we'd spend lots of time learning and practicing while we worshipped, sang, and prayed together. My family has been integrally supportive of my musical journey and I'm beyond grateful for them.\n\nWhat was the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given about pursuing a career in music? An unknown internet message board user once offered me a succinct piece of advice about writing that I've never forgotten: “Have a take and don't suck.” I've applied that principle to all areas of creativity. It's a two-fold message which means be original, be authentic, tell the truth, don't compromise, and pursue excellence in your craft while you're at it.\n\nIs there anything left on your musical bucket list? So many things! I've been very blessed in my musical journey already but I'm always pushing myself to grow as a musician and artist. Every release is an opportunity to build on the previous ones. My bucket list is more of a desire to keep building and growing my craft. It's always one heart at a time.\n\nAt the end of the day, what do you hope is the message of your music? What do you hope people take away from your songs? My message is always the same: You're not alone. My faith in Christ in an integral part of my identity and that sacred hope that I'm not alone is the cornerstone of all my writing, even amid the questioning and pondering and even the times of doubt. Even in the darkest, grittiest, messiest, and most vulnerable moments I hope that light shines through. That's what keeps me going. My songs are an extension of myself. I only write what I know, what I've been through, or what I'm trying to understand. I hope that listeners can relate to my journey and be encouraged.\n\nCan you tell us a little more about how you have been serving the community and partnering with several national disaster response organizations? One of my life goals is to become a chaplain in the disaster response field. In the meantime, I volunteer as much as I can. More recently I was a citizen first-responder during rescue operations in the chaotic aftermath of Hurricane Harvey on the Texas coast. It was like a battlefield out there. It was inspiring to see so many people come together to help their neighbors. It was also heartbreaking to see so much destruction and hear so many stories of people struggling to survive. I wrote about some of those experiences in my song “Valley Forge (Stitches)” from my “Arrows” EP and hosted a fundraising show to contribute toward rebuilding. I went back a month later to where the epicenter of the storm hit the coast in Rockport, Texas, causing near complete devastation of their community. I partnered with Samaritan's Purse for cleanup operations. They're an incredible organization!\n\nHow do you stay connected with your fans? We certainly live in interesting times right now! Social media has become very important, especially with current world events. I'll be honest, I'm not a big social media guy but I believe it's important to continue to use our platforms to inspire and encourage. Whether that's at a show where I can personally interact with people and share stories, or use my social platforms to share my heart and stories, it's all working toward that same goal of being able to engage one heart at a time. We all need that more than ever!\n\nConnect with Jacob Everett Wallace: Website | Instagram | Spotify\n\nJacob Everett Wallace is a burgeoning singer-songwriter from Texas. He sings stories and asks questions; those deeply intimate, somewhat scary questions best explored through song. Jacob’s dynamic acoustic-driven indie-rock style engages introspective thought.
