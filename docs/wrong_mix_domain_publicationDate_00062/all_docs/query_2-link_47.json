        "text": "Back in November I shared the “Lament for the Rohirrim,” by J.R.R. Tolkien on Remembrance Day. Tolkien was a gifted poet, but because much of his poetry as we know it is contained in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, it tends to be overshadowed by his substantial prose. However, a decade spent steeped in The Lord of the Rings has brought me into continual contact with it, and a semester-and-a-half spent messing about in Old English poetry revealed that Tolkien took inspiration from Old English for his poetry as well as his vocabulary.\n\nThe Wanderer is perhaps the most famous of the Old English elegies and Tolkien’s “Lament for the Rohirrim” contains substantial similarities to a section of it. To begin, here is the “Lament for the Rohirrim” as Aragorn recites it in The Two Towers,\n\nWhere now the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing?\n\nWhere is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing?\n\nWhere is the hand on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing?\n\nWhere is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing?\n\nThey have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow;\n\nThe days have gone down in the West, behind the hills into shadow.\n\nWho will gather the smoke of the dead wood burning,\n\nOr behold the flowing years from the Sea returning?1\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings, Aragorn explains that these are lines from a poem about Eorl the Young. This selection bears significant resemblance to lines 92-96 of The Wanderer. The Wanderer is a long poem about an exile who has lost his ring-lord. In the latter half of the poem, he dwells on the passing of earthly joys and says,\n\nHwær cwom mearg? Hwær cwom mago? Hwær cwom maþþumgyfa?\n\nHwær cwom symbla gesetu? Hwær cwom seledreamas?\n\nEala beorht bune! Eala byrnwiga!\n\nEala þeodnes þrym! Hu seo þrag gewat,\n\ngenap under nihthelm swa heo ne wære.\n\nWhere is the horse? Where the young warrior? Where now the gift-giver?\n\nWhere are the feast-seats? Where all the hall joys?\n\nAlas for the bright cup! Alas byrnied warrior!\n\nAlas the lord’s glory! How this time hastens,\n\ngrows dark under night-helm, as it were not!2\n\nBoth Tolkien and the Anglo-Saxon poet have used the Ubi sunt “Where now” motif, which is common in Latin and Old English poetry. This is a topic for another day, but it is enough to mention that this Ubi sunt motif was not unique to this Anglo-Saxon poet, but rather a common poetic element.\n\nNotice the distinct similarities in the first line, “Where is the horse? Where the young warrior?” which Tolkien rephrases as “Where now the horse and the rider?” The word mago “young warrior” is right next to the word mearg “horse,” so it is tempting to translate mago as “rider” like Tolkien did. In fact, the young warrior probably was riding a horse. Though the direct similarities end here, the inspiration continues. Tolkien lumps the themes of the hall, “feast-seats,” “hall joys,” and “bright cup,” under “Where is the hand on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing?” The “byrnied warrior” he inserts earlier as “Where is the helm and the hauberk?”\n\nTolkien then closes with the same image as the Anglo-Saxon poet: that of the days slipping into darkness—þrag…genap under nihthelm “time…grows dark under night-helm.” Tolkien rephrased and expanded this into “the days have gone down in the West, behind the hills into shadow.” Another translator phrased the line in The Wanderer as “time…slipped into nightfall,” which is a bit closer to Tolkien’s rendition.\n\nAs with Eärendil, Tolkien has taken a segment of Anglo-Saxon lore and grafted it into Middle-earth. Tolkien continually stated that he was creating a mythology for England, and that his Middle-earth was intended to be our own world—unlike Lewis’s Narnia. Tolkien’s use of real Anglo-Saxon poetry in The Lord of the Rings glues his Middle-earth every more tightly to our middangeard, securing his legends in the tapestry of our own.\n\nNotes:\n\n1J.R.R.
