Her parentage remains disputed, and her early years unknown. She was a traveler; a widow; a spy for a King who then didn’t pay her, so she was thrown into debtor’s prison, then wrote her way out; and a novelist. One of the few women of her time to write under her own name and earn her living by her pen, she was vividly talented, outspokenly opinionated, self-supporting, scandalous, and legendary —Aphra Behn refused to accept the restrictions society imposed on women. She lived by her own rules, even in her last years, when illness made it difficult for her to write.\n\n____________________________\n\n.\n\nThe Day the Mountains Move\n\n.\n\nby Yosano Akiko\n\n.\n\nThe day the mountains move has come.\n\nI speak, but no one believes me.\n\nFor a time the mountains have been asleep,\n\nBut long ago, they all danced with fire.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you believe this,\n\nMy friends, as long as you believe:\n\nAll the sleeping women\n\nAre now awake and moving.\n\n.\n\n“The Day the Mountains Move” from Feminist Theory Reader, © 2016, edited by Carole R. McCann and Seung-kyung Kim – Routledge Books\n\nYosano Akiko (1878-1942) born as Shō Hō, Japanese author, poet, pioneering feminist, and social reformer. Published in 1901, Midaregami (Tangled Hair), her first of several collections of tanka, a traditional Japanese poetry form, contained around 400 poems, the majority of them love poems. It was denounced by most literary critics as vulgar or obscene, but was widely read by freethinkers, as it brought a passionate individualism to this traditional form, unlike any other work of the late Meiji period. The poems defied Japanese society’s expectation of women to always be gentle, modest and passive. In her poems, women are assertively sexual. She frequently wrote for the all-woman literary magazine Seitō (Bluestocking.) Even though she gave birth to 13 children, 11 of whom survived to adulthood, she rejected motherhood as her main identity, saying limiting a sense of self to a single aspect of one’s life, however important, entraps women in the old way of thinking.\n\n____________________________\n\n.\n\nPanic\n\n.\n\nby Dorothy Keeley Aldis\n\n.\n\nShe says she cannot sleep, when he’s away,\n\nUntil her eyes are burning in her head\n\nWith too much reading. When he’s here she’ll say\n\nGoodnight quite happily, and comforted\n\nAnd smiling drift to sleep. It’s desolate\n\nTo be without him when it is so late.\n\n.\n\nShe’s like to pray more easily to God,\n\nFor life that seemed so safe is suddenly\n\nCut loose and drifting like a milk-weed pod;\n\nAnd she is frightened as she used to be\n\nWhen she was little, and the dark was more\n\nThan dark, and there were things behind the door.\n\n.\n\n“Panic” by Dorothy Keeley Aldis appeared in Poetry magazine’s August, 1930 issue\n\nDorothy Keeley Aldis (1896-1966) was born in Chicago, the youngest of four girls. Her father was managing editor of the Chicago Tribune, and her mother had been a reporter. She was educated privately, then went to Smith College for two years. Her career began at the Sunday Tribune, writing columns on decorating, pets, and personals. She married Graham Aldis in 1922, and they had four children. Dorothy Aldis began writing books of poetry and fiction for children, but also wrote poetry and short stories for adults, which were published in magazines like The New Yorker and Poetry. She wrote a biography of Beatrix Potter titled Nothing is Impossible, published posthumously in 1969.\n\n____________________________\n\n.\n\nHanging Fire\n\n.\n\nby Audre Lorde\n\n.\n\nI am fourteen\n\nand my skin has betrayed me\n\nthe boy I cannot live without\n\nstill sucks his thumb\n\nin secret\n\nhow come my knees are\n\nalways so ashy\n\nwhat if I die\n\nbefore morning\n\nand momma's in the bedroom\n\nwith the door closed.\n\n.\n\nI have to learn how to dance\n\nin time for the next party\n\nmy room is too small for me\n\nsuppose I die before graduation\n\nthey will sing sad melodies\n\nbut finally\n\ntell the truth about me\n\nThere is nothing I want to do\n\nand too much\n\nthat has to be done\n\nand momma's in the bedroom\n\nwith the door closed.\n\n.\n\nNobody even stops to think\n\nabout my side of it\n\nI should have been on Math Team\n\nmy marks were better than his\n\nwhy do I have to be\n\nthe one\n\nwearing braces\n\nI have nothing to wear tomorrow\n\nwill I live long enough\n\nto grow up\n\nand momma's in the bedroom\n\nwith the door closed.\n\n.\n\n“Hanging Fire” from The Collected Poems of Audre Lorde, © 1997 by the Audre Lorde Estate – W.

She became an associate of the Women’s Institute for Freedom of the Press in 1977, and was a co-founder of Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press in 1980. She survived breast cancer in 1978, but died at age 58 of liver cancer in 1992.\n\n____________________________\n\n.\n\nWhat Are Big Girls Made Of?\n\n.\n\nby Marge Piercy\n\n.\n\nThe construction of a woman:\n\na woman is not made of flesh\n\nof bone and sinew\n\nbelly and breasts, elbows and liver and toe.\n\nShe is manufactured like a sports sedan.\n\nShe is retooled, refitted and redesigned\n\nevery decade.\n\nCecile had been seduction itself in college.\n\nShe wriggled through bars like a satin eel,\n\nher hips and ass promising, her mouth pursed\n\nin the dark red lipstick of desire.\n\n.\n\nShe visited in ’68 still wearing skirts\n\ntight to the knees, dark red lipstick,\n\nwhile I danced through Manhattan in mini skirt,\n\nlipstick pale as apricot milk,\n\nhair loose as a horse’s mane.

She was born in India. Inspired by girls who were students at the Women’s College of Aligargh Muslim University in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, she was determined to go to college, but her family migrated to Pakistan after the 1949 Partition. The bloodshed and violence against women during that time made a lasting impression on her. She was a voracious reader, but struggled to get an education, as girls were not allowed to go to school in Pakistan then. She took correspondence courses and earned a high school diploma. There was a lot of family resistance to her seeking admission to college but her brother, Syed Iftikhar Zaidi, paid for her tuition and helped her continue her formal education. She earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1959 and Master's in Economics in 1961 from Punjab University, Lahore. Kishwar married her friend Yousuf Kamran, also a poet, and they had two sons. After her husband's death, she worked to raise her children and support them. She has published 12 volumes of poetry in Urdu, and some of her work has been translated into other languages. “We Sinful Women” is one of her most well-known poems. She has also written eight books for children, and won a prestigious UNESCO award for children's literature. She served for a term as Director General of the Pakistan National Council of the Arts.\n\n____________________________\n\n.\n\nMy Wisdom\n\n.\n\nby Naomi Shihab Nye\n\n.\n\nWhen people have a lot\n\nthey want more\n\nWhen people have nothing\n\nthey will happily share it\n\n*\n\nSome people say\n\nnever getting your way\n\nbuilds character\n\nBy now our character must be\n\ndeep and wide as a continent\n\nAfrica, Australia\n\ngiant cascade of stars\n\nspilling over our huge night\n\n*\n\nWhere did the power go?\n\nDid it enjoy its break?\n\nIs power exhausted?\n\nWhat is real power?\n\nWho really has power?\n\nDid the generator break?\n\nDo we imagine silence\n\nmore powerful because\n\nit might contain everything?\n\nQuiet always lives\n\ninside noise.\n\nBut does it get much done?\n\n*\n\nSilence waits\n\nfor truth to break it\n\n*\n\nCalendars can weep too\n\nThey want us to have better days\n\n*\n\nWelcome to every minute\n\nFeel lucky you’re still in it\n\n*\n\nNo bird builds a wall\n\n*\n\nSky purse\n\njingling\n\nchange\n\n*\n\nWon’t give up\n\nour hopes\n\nfor anything!\n\n*\n\nNot your fault\n\nYou didn’t make the world\n\n*\n\nHow dare this go on and on?\n\ncried the person who believed in praying\n\nGod willing God willing God willing\n\nThere were others who prayed\n\nto ruins & stumps\n\n*\n\nOpen palms\n\nhold more\n\n*\n\nRefuse to give\n\nmistakes\n\ntoo much power\n\n*\n\nAnnoying person?\n\nPerson who told me to stay home\n\nand do what other girls do?\n\nIf you disappeared\n\nI still might miss you\n\n*\n\nBabies want to help us\n\nThey laugh\n\nfor no reason\n\n*\n\nPay close attention to\n\na drop of water\n\non the kitchen table\n\n*\n\nYou cannot say one word about religion\n\nand exclude Ahmad\n\n\"My Wisdom\" from The Tiny Journalist, © 2019 by Naomi Shihab Nye – BOA Editions, Ltd.\n\nNaomi Shihab Nye (1952 – ), born in St. Louis, Missouri.
