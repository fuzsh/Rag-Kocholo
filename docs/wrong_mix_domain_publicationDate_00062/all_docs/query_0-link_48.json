        "text": "Marilyn Hacker\n\nIntroducing Venus Khoury-Ghata\n\nTHE POET AND novelist Venus Khoury-Ghata was born in northern Lebanon, one of four children of a local policeman who had served as an interpreter under the French mandate and a housewife whom the poet describes as “illiterate in two languages.” Arabic was her own first language; French her language of adoption, with which she made her way in the world, including the literary world of France, where she has lived for thirty years. When she began to write, she wrote in both languages, and often felt, as she puts it, that she was writing in French from left to right on the page and in Arabic from right to left, with the text meeting in the middle in a forbidden, incestuous marriage. While she made the choice of French, in which she has since published fourteen novels and twelve collections of poems, the rhythms and tropes of Arabic, its poetry and its oral traditions, can still be heard in the undulations of her sentences, her poems’ sinuous and knotty lines.\n\nIf Arabic is her mother tongue, French is more a fraternal language than that of the real or the Lacanian Father. It was the poet’s one brother, Victor, who first harbored the desire to become a writer. Her novel Une maison au bord des larmes (Editions Balland, 1998), the only one that could be characterised as “autobiographical,” recounts the tragic story of this apprentice poet, torn between genius and madness, haunted at once by Victor Hugo and Rimbaud, the Alexandrine and the Illuminations, lost first to drug addiction and then to the electroshock treatments in a mental hospital to which he was committed by a vengeful, uncomprehending father: shock treatments which effaced his knowledge of the French language along with his aspirations.\n\nIt was the brother’s tragedy which awoke the desire to write in his young sister. (Another sister, the journalist May Menassa, who remained in Lebanon, also wrote a novel, in Arabic, about her brother’s tragedy — but the two sister-writers were unaware of each other’s projects until they were published, in the same month and year.) Now, the poet herself has said that, while she is and always will be “inhabited” by Arabic, the French language itself has become her homeland, more than any terrestrial location.\n\nAs the passage between countries and languages has characterized her life, passage of one sort or another is an underlying theme of her work. Her novels range from the picaresque (five Frenchwomen shipwrecked on the Algerian coast in 1802; a Trinitarian monk sent to bring back a dignitary’s wife eloped with a Turkish merchant in 1789) to the familial (her brother’s descent to electroshocked silence in war-torn Beirut) to the fantastic (a widow’s return to a Mediterranean island where the dead cohabit with the living). They almost always deal with a movement between Europe and the Middle East, with the ensuing misunderstandings and enlightenments, and with the passage, equally two-way, between life and death. Her poems, composed for the most part in sequences, often have the quality of exploded narratives, re-assembled in a mosaic in which the reader has at least the illusion of being able to find a more linear connecting thread. But in the end, it is the design of the mosaic itself which is most memorable. The same themes which animate her fiction are predominant in the poems: the tension between movement/change and tradition/sources, with all that is positive and negative in both; the unceasing commerce between human beings and the rest of the natural world, and between the dead and the living; the independent, puissant and trans-cultural life of words.\n\n“The Sailors Without a Ship” is from a new collection, Les Ortises (The Nettles) to be published by Mercure de France this year. It includes the long title poem, interrogating the Muse-like figure of her mother, humble but tireless even after death, and touches on the impact of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon; but it also introduces a playful sequence of poems built on “faux” Arabic proverbs — invented by the poet. “The Sailors. . .” continues the primary interrogations of Khoury-Ghata’s work: there is the idea of exile, and of the permeability of death; there is that which is far-ranging and that which is homely. Yet the “sailors,” quintessential expatriates, create their own peculiar domesticity, not bereft of tenderness and vulnerability, while the singular “she” in her house interrogates death with the courage of a great traveler, a mental traveler perhaps, one of Khoury-Ghata’s female figures with something of Antigone and something of the exiled Zainab about her.\n\nVenus Khoury-Ghata’s work has been translated into many languages-Arabic, Russian, Italian, and Polish among them-but she has been particularly pleased by the warm and intelligent reception of her poetry by Anglophone audiences.\n\n—Paris, France, December 2003\n\nBibliography:\n\nHere There Was Once a Country, translations by Marilyn Hacker, Oberlin\n\nCollege Press, 2000.\n\nShe Says, bilingual edition with translations by Marilyn Hacker,\n\nGraywolf Press, 2003.\n\nVenus Khoury-Ghata\n\nThe Sailors Without A Ship\n\nThe sailors without a ship have strange hallucinations when the sea\n\ndoes its spring cleaning\n\nThe bare-armed fronds of gesticulating seaweed are defunct sweethearts\n\nThe taut swings between the continents are filled with seagulls and\n\nchildren’s laughter\n\nThe cabin boys’ distress is infinite when they think of the little girls’\n\nscraped knees\n\ntheir sobs pierce the waves\n\nand the sharks which bow before the waves don’t wish them well\n\nunder their tight jackets they hide unfriendly fins\n\nand the sailors who know it forget to put out their lanterns\n\nThe sailors without a ship link the fixed to the mobile\n\nthe opaque to the transparent\n\nthe horizon would have stretched its cord between two apple trees\n\nwithout their intervention\n\nblack water is their fifth element\n\nthe sick sweat of the earth\n\nthe watered blood of coalmines\n\ntheir fixed abode when the continents smash their dishes\n\n*\n\nShe doesn’t sweep in front of her door any more\n\nno longer argues with the wind which tousles her false pepper tree\n\nshe reads the rain in her disorder\n\nlearns that March stole December’s ink\n\nand two days from February’s pencil-case\n\nher lamp won’t let itself sleep in winter when the books think that\n\nthey’re pillows\n\nwhen fireflies make a pyre of their wings to warm up chilled things:\n\nsingle beds\n\nDear John letters\n\nand those dead women who imperturbably cross rooms with a rustling\n\nof fabric\n\n*\n\nThe road which leads from the Compass to the Great Bear passed\n\nunder our windows\n\nchildren took it to go to school\n\npassing by, their school smocks caught on a sleeping star\n\na cry rose up in the form of a spark\n\nchilly Bérénice dreamed of a quilt\n\nand Betelgeuse the wanderer of an enclosed garden and a six-leafed\n\nclover\n\nIt was a time of honeysuckle and laziness\n\npeople walked in their sleep\n\nschools followed the wind\n\nthe children were made of crepe paper\n\n*\n\nSurrounded by mountains\n\nshe waits at her window for the sea with its crowd of rowdy sailors\n\nto help her beat down the fruit from the walnut tree that’s grown taller than her ladder\n\nA long time ago\n\nshe owned a house with its plot of ocean\n\na roof with its share of wind\n\nthere were seagulls instead of a dog\n\nHer clothesline had no reason to envy the horizon\n\nShe assumed the intrusion of waves in her bedroom was an optical\n\nillusion\n\nwent to sleep as the water rose\n\ntheir din contained the sorrowful silence of unmoored boats\n\nbecome mute since their mouths filled with sand\n\n*\n\nShe realized that the house was dead when the walls grazed on the\n\nhedge’s shadow\n\nin fact the house was not a house\n\nbut a succession of opacities and transparencies which transcribed the\n\neagles’ flight\n\nthe cemetery was not a cemetery either\n\nbut a place through which tears could pass\n\nan escort for petitions the stones drank\n\nMourning made those who crossed it seem taller\n\nThe graves were laid out like dollhouses\n\nto jump in feet together was part of the festivities\n\nthe visitors imitated the blackbird\n\nthe woman who followed the tree had green armpits\n\nthe hem of a branch taken down made her topple over\n\nthe axe hidden under her skirt cut through water and fire not grief\n\nand the tree’s bark slit like a raped girl’s skirt hid another layer of\n\nbark\n\n*\n\nWhen everything was extinguished\n\nso that shadows slipped from the walls and flattened themselves the\n\nlength of the graves\n\nthere were those dead leaves that walked on the windowpanes\n\ntheir veined palms turned towards the sleepers\n\nthe little girl who bores a hole in the night with her translucent finger\n\nmistakes them for dead bridal couples and throws handfuls of rice\n\nat them which fall on the other side of the rain which is knitting a\n\nwarm suit for the impoverished garden\n\n*\n\nThe fatherless children sweep the streets with their rage\n\nThey look for sailors with a wealth of bread-trees and centenarian\n\noceans\n\nTheir feet trampling the river-mouths become transparent\n\nTheir minuscule toes serve as lighthouses for sinking ships\n\nThey throw earth on the earth before embarking erase everything not\n\nendowed with speech:\n\nisolated houses\n\nunmarked graves\n\ndead-end streets\n\nmeticulous rains will erase the mountains they leave behind them\n\nThey go away on the same wave\n\ntheir blood thickens as the sea ages\n\n*\n\nHer belief that death will emerge from her mirror\n\nor from the palm of her hand\n\nor even from the bark of the lime-tree she neglected to prune\n\nshe will lay siege to transfixed things:\n\nchipped plates\n\ncold teapot\n\nsheet folded inside-out\n\nher certainty that the parquet will cry out for her\n\nthat the shutters will gnash their teeth\n\nthat she will be buried in the mirror’s silvering\n\nwithout having comforted the lime-tree which will look elsewhere\n\n(Translated from the French by Marilyn Hacker)"
