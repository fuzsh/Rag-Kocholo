        "text": "Dion DiMucci, better known as Dion, is back with his third new album in less than four years. Girl Friends, which dropped last Friday (March 8), continues the impressive late-career streak of the soon-to-be-85-year-young wanderer. Like its two predecessors Stomping Ground (2021) and Blues With Friends, it features collaborations with high-profile artists with a twist: All are women or as Dion playfully calls them ‘my girl friends.’\n\nWhile at first sight it may appear Dion follows an old playbook where a mature artist packs their album with popular peers, he always remains a true equal and is never outgunned by his collaborators, both musically and vocally. It’s also noteworthy Dion co-wrote all of the 12 original tracks, as stated in the official press release: 11 with Mike Aquilina with whom also wrote most of the tracks on Stomping Ground, and one with the late Scott Kempner. Girl Friends is Dion’s third consecutive album to appear on Joe Bonamassa’s label Keeping the Blues Alive Records.\n\nTime for some music. Let’s start with the amazing opener Soul Force, featuring Susan Tedeschi who is best known as Derek Trucks’ partner in crime in Tedeschi Trucks Band. They’ve also been married since December 2001. “It’s amazing that someone so unassuming can play with such grit,” opined Dion. Spot on, IMHO – here are the goods to prove it!\n\nSince I just included I Aim to Please (feat. Danielle Nicole) in my most recent new music review, I’m skipping it here and go right to Stop Drop and Roll. For this song Dion teamed up with Valerie Tyson who fronts the Valerie Tyson Band and has been lauded for her “flamethrower vocals.” I love the soul and gospel vibe Tyson brings to the song. “I call her up when I have a tune that’s 100% fun,” Dion recalled. “This kind of groove requires that kind of company and it’s why I got into this business in the first place.” Smart pick!\n\nAn American Hero is a beautiful country-flavored ballad featuring Carlene Carter, who first entered my radar screen in 2017 when John Mellencamp collaborated with her on the excellent Sad Clowns & Hillbillies album. “Carlene’s voice can turn your head, and it can break your heart,” stated Dion – yep!\n\nHey Suzy is a tasty country-flavored blues. Dion’s great partner in crime here is Canadian blues guitarist and singer-songwriter Sue Foley. “It’s a dream come true to work with her,” Dion said, adding, “I felt like I was one of the Everly Brothers.” That’s a really sharp observation – check it out!\n\nI’d like to close with another highlight on the album: Mama Said, featuring the amazing Shemekia Copeland. “One conversation with Shemekia Copeland you fall in love with her,” Dion gushed. “And this girl can sing! Girl’s got the blues in her blood.” Evidently, the admiration is mutual. “Dion is so special to me; it’s an honor and thrill to have been asked to collaborate with him,” Copeland said. “I mean, what woman wouldn’t want to sing with Dion?” The playful lyrics are fun, but it’s Copeland’s incredible vocals that take the song to a different level – damn!\n\nIn case you’re wondering why making an album with female artists, here’s what Dion had to say about it. “I write about my preoccupations, and I know no better preoccupation than the female of the species. A friend of mine is a philosopher, and he talks often about ‘the feminine genius’ — the undeniable difference that’s in women and the difference that they make in the world. I’m grateful to my friend for giving it a name because the fact has always been plain to me, but I could never put it into words.”\n\n“I’ve noticed that men play a different tune when there are women in the room — and it’s a different kind of jam when women are in the mix. I don’t know why this is so, but it is. Maybe we men, at some primitive level, are competing for their attention. As I said, I don’t know why or how. I do know it makes better music and we’re all better for it.”\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Girl Friends press release; YouTube; Spotify"
