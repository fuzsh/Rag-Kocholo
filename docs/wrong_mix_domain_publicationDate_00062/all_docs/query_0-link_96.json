Tepper takes the mental risks that are the lifeblood of science fiction and all imaginative fiction.\"\n\n--Ursula K. Le Guin, Los Angeles Times\n\nHer first new novel since The Margarets, The Waters Rising marks the glorious return of the extraordinary Sheri S. Tepper, the award-winning contemporary master whom Locus has called, \"one of sf's most distinctive voices.\" The Waters Rising tells a gripping story of a future already ravaged and now in even graver peril when a dreadful, awesome killing power is resurrected from the past. Readers of Margaret Atwood and Marge Piercy will join with fans of literary sf in praising this stunning masterwork of speculative fiction from one of the acknowledged greats.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nA dreadful, awesome killing power is resurrected from the past . . .\n\nPowers are invoked and curses are being laid . . .\n\nGreat waters are rising and changing the world . . .\n\nLong ago was the \"Big Kill,\" horrible, apocalyptic events that destroyed nearly every living thing on earth. Since then the last of humankind has scattered into widespread small kingdoms separated by superstition, war, and fear. And now, while facing a natural catastrophe that threatens to drown a world, an ancient evil resurfaces and may prevent any chance of survival.\n\nWith the future of humankind at stake, a small band of disparate charac-ters--a lonely child, a loyal servant, a mysterious wanderer, and a most unusual horse--sets out on a journey fraught with peril and wonder . . . a sacred mission that leaves no room for failure. . . .\n\nDeeply original in scope and vision, The Waters Rising is a daring and remarkable work of speculative fiction--a tour de force from one of the most revered writers of our time.\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"Tepper balances pointed criticisms of our era with a calamity that appears to owe far more to Genesis than to science...the writing is slick and crafeully crafted, Xulai has plenty of pluck, and her companions possess a nearly ideal mixture of virtues, flaws, and enthusiasm for redemptive sacrifice.\" -- Publishers Weekly\n\n\"The Waters Rising\" delivers a strong, complex story that poses tough questions and demands a new look at the possibilities of the future.\" -- Wichita Eagle\n\n\"Full of fascinating characters and beautifully detailed settings . . . complex and multifaceted . . . As always, Locus Award-winner Tepper wields grand science fiction themes with skill, vision and a twist of black humor.\" -- Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\n\"Tepper holds up a funhouse glass to customs and mores many of us take for granted. . . . She provides a good story, with sympathetic characters and plenty to think about.\" -- Denver Post\n\n\"This lyrical, beautifully written novel transcends the sum of its parts to become a parable of survival and hope in hopeless times.\" -- The Guardian\n\n\"Tepper has developed a dependable following with works that have an epic fantasy feel but that ultimately reveal logically consistent scientific trappings. This work is no exception, a successful blend of dying-earth fantasy and wicked-witch fable.\" -- Booklist\n\n\"The Waters Rising, stands as a thoughtful allegory for environmentalism.\" -- Iron Mountain Daily News"
