        "text": "This week I go back once again to 1984 and this time it’s to dig up an artifact that marks the true beginning of heavy metal’s most infamous subgenre.\n\nBathory – self-titled\n\nReleased October 1984 via Tyfon Grammofon Records\n\nThe story of Bathory is a fairly simple one. The project was the mastermind of young Swede Thomas Forsberg, aka Quorthon. Quorthon’s father, Borje Forsberg aka Boss, owned the record label Tyfon Grammofon and Quorthon’s fledgling band would fill out songs on a compilation when a planned act dropped out. Those recordings generated a high degree of interest and Boss commissioned Bathory for a full-length debut album.\n\nThe work of Bathory would later fall under the sub-label Black Mark Productions, which Tyfon Grammofon is more commonly known as today.\n\nQuorthon handled guitar and vocals on this release, he was joined by Stefan Larsson on drums and Rickard Bergman on bass. The lineup of Bathory would change often, with Quorthon being the only constant member and years down the line the only member.\n\nThe album cover was fussed over a little bit, with a pentagram originally planned but the idea was scrapped in favor of the goat artwork. After the first pressings of the album, Quorthon found the yellow coloring of the goat an eyesore and the cover was changed to black and white for all subsquent pressings. The back cover also features an error due to supply issues. Quorthon found some kind of rub-off lettering in a font he wanted to use, but he ran out of the letter C, so the song Necromansy is spelled as I just typed it instead of “necromancy” as the dark art is typically known as.\n\nThe influence of Bathory was a huge question mark during the early years – Quorthon cited acts like Motorhead and GBH as his primary guides, while everyone on the planet Earth thought that the early Bathory recordings sounded much like Venom. Quorthon chafed at comparisons to Venom and even suggested that the two bands were completely different – he isn’t wrong, per se, but there is a definite vibe that’s similar to Venom in these early Bathory recordings. In this 1987 interview with Metal Forces, Quorthon did clarify that he thinks Venom’s Black Metal is a masterpiece and he goes further into what led him to make the music he did.\n\nI’m going to handle this album differently than my usual format. Today I’ll offer up the tracklist and then give a summary of what we have here, I’m not going to jump into detail track by track like I usually do.\n\nStorm Of Damnation (intro)\n\nHades\n\nReaper\n\nNecromansy\n\nSacrifice\n\nIn Conspiracy With Satan\n\nArmageddon\n\nRaise The Dead\n\nWar\n\nThe Winds Of Mayhem (outro)\n\nThis album takes less time to listen to than it takes to get a Domino’s pizza – this one is in and out in 26:58, and 3:30 of that is the intro and outro.\n\nThe music on tap is rooted in thrash, but is very lo-fi production and a bit more “messy” than the polished offering thrash would mostly become. It bears some comparison to Slayer’s Show No Mercy with the “evil” imagery and creepy music, but even Slayer’s debut was refined compared to this. This is a ghastly, cavernous listening experience that isn’t for the faint of heart.\n\nThe concept of “under producing” might be strange but it’s also perhaps the most important part of this record. The lo-fi production turned off some listeners but brought others in, and some of those listeners would seek to emulate this “sloppy” work. It’s one direct link from this to the genre of black metal, and its infamous “second wave” which would show up in the late 1980’s and terrorize the world by the early ’90’s.\n\nIt’s actually a bit inaccurate to call this album and black metal two separate things – while black metal was influenced by Venom, Celtic Frost, Slayer and Mercyful Fate, none of those acts were playing the style of music. Bathory, on the other hand, offered up an early blueprint on what black metal could actually sound like. Songs like Sacrifice and Armageddon are not far removed from what the Norweigian scene would put on display when black metal truly got rolling. Nothing wrong with calling this the world’s first black metal album, though it’s a subgenre whose listeners like to argue about everything so the point could be debated.\n\nFor me personally this wasn’t a part of my collection until a lot later down the line, when the most infamous events of black metal’s early days had played out and Quorthon himself had moved on to other styles. But it is absolutely worth a visit to truly understand where the depths of extreme metal got their influence, and this album is the birth of black metal.\n\nThis album basically starts playing and bashes for its 27 minutes of existence, save the eerie intro and outro. If there is a standout track I find Raise The Dead to be it. This one peels the speed back just a touch and is a savage, noisy march about coming back from the grave. This is the song that does grab out a little bit and offers something perhaps “catchy.”\n\nBut this album is an all or nothing proposition as a whole. You’ll either like it or not. There is no range of dynamics to consider here or a few songs that leap out and others that are “less than.” It also makes grading a bit of a chore – honestly the album sounds like shit and could be given an F for that alone. It’s also the start of something that became massive within heavy metal and could be given an A or even an S for that factor.\n\nThe actual grade lies somewhere inbetween – for me personally I have listened to black metal for decades now so the sound is not an adverse factor – this is exactly what black metal is supposed to sound like, and it’s primarily because of this album that black metal sounds like that. This is worthwhile to listen to and is interesting on its own merits, not just because it’s a historical marker.\n\nAlbum Grade: B+\n\nBathory’s first offering got the ball rolling on Quorthon’s own lengthy career and also the genre of black metal. The next few Bathory albums, including the classics Blood Fire Death and Under The Sign Of The Black Mark, would cement Bathory’s status as early extreme metal legends and draw a line to the start of Mayhem’s career, thus kicking off black metal in earnest. Quorthon would leave black metal behind after awhile, serving up several albums of more melodic fare that now classify as Viking metal and also experimenting from time to time. Bathory would run until 2004, while Quorthon died of heart issues.\n\nBathory did not run the usual course of a band – they rarely played live and gave up on that pursuit after a few years. Bathory was simultaneously world famous and totally obscure – not known to the larger world but hailed as legendary among the denizens of the metal underground. And this debut album was a fitting start to a heavy metal legacy.\n\nFor more on the grading scale I didn’t really use much this week, head here.\n\nQuestions, comments or concerns? Use the comment form below or head to my contact page.\n\nThis week’s song looks back to 1984 and was the third and final single from Twisted Sister’s landmark album Stay Hungry. I talked about the album to help lead off my celebration of 1984’s 40th anniversary. The song has its origins in the album prior, 1983’s You Can’t Stop Rock n’ Roll, as we’ll soon get into.\n\nThe Price did not have the same singles success that the other two songs from Stay Hungry did – it would get to 19 on the Top Rock Tracks chart and 24 on the long defunct Radio and Records chart, but it did not crack the Billboard 100, only hitting 8 on the Bubbling Under chart. It was a different style and theme to the prior singles, with We’re Not Gonna Take It and I Wanna Rock being balls-out rockers. The band cites a lack of a radio mix from producer Tom Werner as a factor, Werner was not given enough heads up to do up a radio edit of the song the same way he did for the two other singles. Not necessarily related but worth noting is that Dee Snider has been critical of Werner’s production (and Werner has fired back at Snider and all of his various critics).\n\nOn our hands today is a ballad, and one with more lofty concerns than the typical love song. It is an existential question of whether or not it is worth it to carry on, as the powerful chorus asks. This song doesn’t answer the question – it’s up to the listener to come to their own conclusions. There’s nothing over the moon about the song’s music but the basic approach fits this one very well.\n\nDee Snider was inspired to write this one while away in Europe recording the previous album. He relays the story in this 2016 interview with Carl Wiser on Songfacts. Dee and the band were holed up recording their album with not even money to make phone calls back home. Jay Jay French’s sister-in-law called to the band to check on them and Dee relayed that he was missing his family, the reply was “I guess that’s the price you have to pay.” Dee gave the phone to Jay Jay, then went into the bathroom and began working on the song.\n\nThe Price really does raise those kinds of questions, and well beyond the specific scope of if it was worth it for Twisted Sister to be pushing for their career. The grind can be a tough one, trying to figure out how to “make it” or even how to just get by in life. This song resonates, sometimes as encouragement and sometimes as a point of reflection, on that journey.\n\nWhile The Price wasn’t a hit in the same way the other singles from Stay Hungry were, this one did become a fan favorite. It’s the band’s sixth most-played song live and Dee frequently played the show on his long-running House of Hair radio show, speaking highly of the track that many fans have listens to in order to help them pull through. Especially in tough times like these, it doesn’t hurt to have some encouragement.\n\nQuestions, comments or concerns?

In 2007 a greatest hits compilation of the Dio-Sabbath albums was released. Tony Iommi did not have a wealth of usable material from these albums in the vault, so he convened with the other members to record a few new songs for the comp.\n\nThis led to touring and rather quickly morphed into recording a new studio album. The only roadblock present was one sprung by her grace Sharon Osbourne – this band could not use the name Black Sabbath, as Camp Osbourne had secured full control of Sabbath’s rights from Iommi several years prior. This led Sharon to release a flimsy PR statement declaring that there was “only one Black Sabbath,” even though anyone with even a passing knowledge of heavy metal is familiar with the several Ozzy-less versions of the band. At any rate, Iommi, Dio, Geezer Butler and Vinny Appice chose to rechristen themselves Heaven & Hell in order to tour and record. It was Black Sabbath in all but name, and many record stores even filed the release under Black Sabbath on the shelf.\n\nThe album features 10 songs with a 54:01 runtime. There were some digital editions with bonus tracks, these were live cuts and I don’t know of any studio material that was left on the cutting room floor.\n\nAtom And Evil\n\nThe opener keeps a slow pace in fitting with the doom aspect of Sabbath’s music. Dio gets to shine on the verses while Iommi opens up the riffing in the chorus and solo break. While not outright headbanging, it’s honestly a great listening experience with the more droning tempo.\n\nAnd the theme here is very deep, interwoven and well done. Atom And Evil is clearly a play on the Adam and Eve story and the song explores the concept of someone finding forbidden knowledge, just as in the creation story. In this case the knowledge is that of nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd also of note – this isn’t the first time someone used this song title to express the same sentiments. In 1947, the gospel act Golden Gate Quartet released a single with the same title and theme. Rather different songs, but same idea. Grade: A+\n\nFear\n\nThis one gets going with a fair bit of power and has one hell of a doom riff running through it. The song is simply about being afraid of the dark. This one is actually more about the reality of nyctophobia, which is a feature of prehistoric times when light sources at night were quite scarce and a fear of the dark was perfectly rational. It has lingered with humans ever since and now we have this great song about it. Grade: A\n\nBible Black\n\nUp next was the advance single from the album. This one builds from a softer intro into a full-on vintage Iommi pounder of a riff. The song is about a guy who becomes possessed by a book of dark knowledge. It’s easy to see why they picked this as the single – this song is full and rich and hits all the right notes. Grade: A+\n\nDouble The Pain\n\nThis one comes out at a more uptempo, rocking pace. The premise here is of someone who isn’t happy unless they’re miserable, so “double the pain” and make them euphoric. Interesting concept, but honestly I can’t help but feel like I’m listening to a heavy metal commercial jingle for Doublemint gum (that stuff still around?). A good song but maybe just a bit off. Grade: B-\n\nRock And Roll Angel\n\nThis one moves in a straight line with a simple yet effective Iommi riff. This was first called Rock and Roll Jesus, but then Kid Rock released something with that name so this one got changed up. It’s a nice song that’s far from the standout of the album but it’s not bad by any stretch. Grade: B-\n\nThe Turn Of The Screw\n\nA song with a fairly upbeat rhythm to it, even Iommi’s riffs have a bit of lift to them on here. A bit juxtaposed with the subject matter as this is about using people up and discarding them. Another song that doesn’t leap out of the speaker but still offers up something worth listening to. Grade: B\n\nEating The Cannibals\n\nAn outright speed song here, this one picks up the tempo and bashes out from start to end. There are even a few melodic rock runs from Iommi over the top of this one, not something you hear from him every day. The theme here is one of violence and also a sort of twist on the “eat the rich” concept. I don’t know that it entirely comes off but the song works just the same. Grade: B+\n\nFollow The Tears\n\nAnother more standard Dio doom offering with a few keyboards up front to help differentiate things a bit. It’s a dark tale of how human generosity can be self-serving and ultimately a trap. Another song that’s fine but doesn’t quite go over the hump. Grade: C+\n\nNeverwhere\n\nOne more fast and fairly upbeat and tempo track as we wind to album’s end. It’s one of Dio’s fantasy tales though this one is really dark, about someone giving in to the temptation of witchcraft and the like. Pretty good stuff here. Grade: B\n\nBreaking Into Heaven\n\nThe final song is a more plodding doom track with the vintage Iommi guitar work. This one’s about the rebel angels who left Heaven with Satan, now they are plotting to return to Heaven and they aren’t going to ask politely to get back in. Not a bad way to close out the album and the Dio era of Black Sabbath. Grade: B+\n\nThe Devil You Know was hotly anticipated and would see a rush of success upon release. It charted all over the world, though in fairness many of the chart positions were modest. In the US it did very well, landing at number 8. This would match Master Of Reality for best US chart position of any Black Sabbath album, though a few years down the line the original version of the band would land the number 1 spot with the band’s final album 13.\n\nWhile the stage was set for Heaven & Hell to take off and run, this chapter would sadly close after less than 50 shows. Ronnie James Dio was diagnosed with stomach cancer and died in May of 2010. For a group who had formed and split up twice over infighting but had come together older and wiser for this last run, it was a tragic way for everything to have to end. The end of Heaven & Hell left Tony and Geezer available to work with Ozzy as Black Sabbath one final time, a run that concluded in 2017.\n\nToday’s album does have a mixed reception. Some people ate up anything that Dio Sabbath released, I am generally among that number. Others didn’t find much worthwhile in the album, longing more for the prior classic albums of the group.\n\nFor me this is a solid effort. It has a few standout cuts that show up at the beginning of the record, then the remainder offers up secondary tracks that are still quality and a bit above the “filler” line. It’s a good listening experience front to back, nothing on here sticks out as not fitting.\n\nAlbum Grade: B+\n\nThis last chapter of work between Dio and Iommi blessed us with another round of their somewhat unique blend of doom and high fantasy metal. It is a Black Sabbath album in all but name, a policy enacted by her benevolent grace Sharon Osbourne. But there is no quashing the legacy that “Dio Sabbath” were able to forge, and The Devil You Know serves as a fitting conclusion to that legacy. It’s also the final testament of bona fide heavy metal god Ronnie James Dio.\n\nFor the details of my grading scale, head here.\n\nQuestions, comments or concerns?

Part One is back this way if you want to catch up.\n\nPrince And The Revolution – When Doves Cry\n\nRight off the bat we get to the other song to stay on top for five weeks during the year. We also get to what was crowned the single of the year in many contexts, including being the best seller. It was also a soundtrack song to the film Purple Rain, landing Prince the rarity of having the number one album, song and movie all at the same time. Only Elvis and The Beatles can also brag about that.\n\nWhen Doves Cry is a masterpiece of a song. Equal parts pop, synth and funk, this track has all the emotions in it. It’s fairly complex lyrical fare, revolving around a complicated childhood and a love affair. It’s considered one of Prince’s greatest tracks and it is the reigning winner, with a few qualifications to discuss later, of 1984.\n\nRay Parker Jr. – Ghostbusters\n\nUp next is yet another soundtrack song, and no we’re not done with those. Movies and music were huge business in the 1980’s. Ray Parker Jr. got a lot of mileage off of his hit theme song for the smash movie, it stayed on top of the charts for three weeks.\n\nHere is where I get to save a lot of time – I talked about this song earlier this year and I can just link that post here. Needless to say I love the song, I don’t often write about songs I don’t like in full posts. But I’m sure it will happen someday.\n\nTina Turner – What’s Love Got To Do With It\n\nAnd now it’s on to a much deserved comeback and career-defining achievement. Tina Turner’s only number one hit came from her 1984 album Private Dancer and logged three weeks on top in September of ’84. This song also cleaned up at the Grammys, being the huge winner for 1984 songs at that awards show.\n\nThe song is smooth and deceivingly upbeat musically as the subject matter is pretty complex and a bit down. For Tina it was a smash success, the second best-selling single of the year, and launched her into a new phase of superstardom that was well-earned after all she’d been through. Quite the triumphant story here.\n\nJohn Waite – Missing You\n\nWhen I first looked over the list I honestly couldn’t remember this song, but it came back pretty quickly when I pressed play. This song occupies a unique spot on the 1984 number one list – it was the only song to be in the top spot for only one week. It would be John Waite’s only number one as a solo act – he would score another as the singer for Bad English a few years later on.\n\nAfter looking back on it I don’t mind this song. I’m not all that into it, it’s a bit too soft rock for my tastes really. I’m literally writing about Exciter’s Violence And Force album for a future album post so this here isn’t totally my cup of tea. But it’s ok and a bit better than what I was expecting going in.\n\nPrince And The Revolution – Let’s Go Crazy\n\nPrince logs his second number one of the year, the only artist to pull that off in 1984. This spent two weeks on top and gave Prince the most weeks at number one for the year. The song is fun and fast and, like the title and its creator, crazy.\n\nStevie Wonder – I Just Called To Say I Love You\n\nOne of the world’s most innovate musicians took a career turn in the ’80’s to more commercial accessibility, and this song was the ultimate payoff. Crafted as a song for the movie The Woman In Red, this spent three weeks at the chart’s top. It didn’t just go number one in the US either – the world charts show bunch of 1’s in the chart positions list.\n\nThis is another one I remember being all over the place back then, no real getting away from it. I won’t call it my favorite song in the world but I do enjoy hearing it again, it does take me back to that glorious time.\n\nBilly Ocean – Caribbean Queen\n\nBilly Ocean would land the first of a handful of number one hits with this track. The funny thing was this song bombed originally in Europe with a different name, then won over the same audience after the reworked Caribbean theme caught hold in the US. This had two weeks topping the chart.\n\nThis may seem odd but I’m honestly enjoy Billy Ocean’s music quite a bit. There’s something maybe a bit more accessible or fuller about his songs and I’ve always had an ear for when he had a song on radio or TV. I clearly wasn’t the only one, Billy caught on with a hell of a lot of people given his solid run through the years.\n\nWham! – Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\n\nIt was now go-go time for Wham!, as George Michael would kick off a stellar career with, well, a pretty goofy song and an extremely goofy video. It hung out at the top of the chart for three weeks and was the start of a run of three number one songs for the group as Michael morphed into a solo artist in the next year.\n\nThis song is, well, it’s certainly a song. I don’t mean to dump on it as it was intentionally crafted to be bubblegum pop as opposed to a song like Careless Whisper that has something deeper going on with it. The video might call for actual eye bleach depending on just how ’80’s you wanna get and it was an outlier even then. But overall I do enjoy Wham! And I can even jam out to this one now and again.\n\nHall and Oates – Out Of Touch\n\nThe dynamic pop duo would land their sixth and final number one hit with this snazzy dance number toward the end of 1984. The song got two weeks at the top.\n\nI can again save a lot of time here since I wrote about this one not too long ago, so here’s that post.\n\nMadonna – Like A Virgin\n\nThe year wrapped up with one hell of a bang, as Madonna landed the first of 44 singles at the top of the Billboard chart. Yes, 44. The Queen of Pop had arrived. Like A Virgin held the spot for one actual week in 1984 though the calendar shows two – Billboard didn’t do a last-week chart so positions were frozen for the holidays. It held on to the top spot for four weeks in 1985, so it matched When Doves Cry and Jump with five weeks at the top of the chart.\n\nEven with such a long line of hits, Like A Virgin is extra iconic. It was both a catchy song and a provocative statement, the open sexuality of the song being a massive topic of conversation. 1984 went out with one hell of a bang and one of music’s biggest stars was on the big stage.\n\nThat does it for the number one songs of 1984. When Doves Cry is generally hailed as the “winner” of the year, though Madonna has a hell of an argument for that title. Tina Turner also came away with a ton of accolades for her signature song. There were a few last-time number ones, a few first timers and a hell of a lot of soundtracks.\n\n1984 was curious chart-wise for a few reasons. When I did the top albums list that was one short section, with only five albums when other years see over twenty. The songs were a stable rotation of stuff up and down – many other years see songs bounce in and out of the top spot but that never happened once in 1984.\n\nAnd none of these can be considered one hit wonders. Everyone had other hits on the charts and many of these folks had other number one hits. It was a true hit maker’s parade at the top of the Billboard in 1984.\n\nThat does it for this post. I will continue my year-long celebration of 1984 with more album and song discussions as the second half of the year winds along, and probably a few more special looks at other things from the year. Enjoy the ride, because we’re not ever getting the 1980’s back again.\n\nQuestions, comments or concerns? Use the comment form below or head to my contact page.\n\nIt’s time to have a look at the songs that hit number one on the Billboard charts during 1984. It’s a pretty memorable selection overall so this will be fun to go through. There is a fair bit of trivia and whatnot to go through and it cuts through a fair cross section of music, while of course being mainly oriented toward pop.\n\nThere were twenty total number one songs so that makes it easy for me to divide this into two parts. Part two will arrive tomorrow.\n\nPaul McCartney and Michael Jackson – Say Say Say\n\nUp first is one of three holdovers from 1983. This song comes from Macca’s 1983 album Pipes Of Peace. The album itself wasn’t fawned over but this song was a massive hit, hanging out on the top of the chart for six weeks, two of those being in 1984. It of course doesn’t hurt that it had Michael Jackson on it, who had cemented himself as the King of Pop after the world-conquering run Thriller had been on.\n\nSay Say Say is a pretty simple pop track, there isn’t a whole hell of a lot to it. I don’t find it all that interesting, though Jackson does add some spice to the song and is the worthwhile part of it. It honestly sounds more like a Jackson song that McCartney showed up on rather than the other way around. Nothing really wrong with it, but it was number one because of Michael and everyone knows it.\n\nYes – Owner Of A Lonely Heart\n\nThis next song from 1983 became the one and only chart topper for the progressive rock act. There’s a whole story behind this song but it’s too long and windy for here. Basically the band got back together with a few new members, one being Trevor Rabin, who brought this song with him. The band fussed over recording it for several months before finally nailing it down.\n\nThis is a really cool song that I remember fondly from back then. It has the fit of a nice synth rock track from the era, though it does incorporate some noisy zaniness as well. I’m not familiar with Yes’s initial era so I didn’t feel “burned” by their pop turn, hell I wasn’t even alive for most of their 70’s stuff. So I can enjoy this one with no reservations about the band’s changes. This one held down the top spot for two weeks.\n\nCulture Club – Karma Chameleon\n\nThis is the final song from 1983 on the list and also the only number one US hit for the British pop merchants. This song was massive and sold millions of copies, both of single and album. Culture Club were a relatively brief phenomenon and Boy George’s tabloid presence long outlived the music itself, but this band sold records like hotcakes back in the day. I’m sure one thing helped the other there, of course.\n\nThis one is a fun, upbeat new wave number with just a small twinge of country in it. The music video is also fun, filled with vibrant colors that catch attention. It’s probably fun to watch the video while on certain drugs but I wouldn’t know. The song spent three weeks at number one though it was a cultural moment that hung around for quite awhile after its run at the top. I also can’t imagine what people a lot younger than me think of it, especially the video, but hey it was the 1980’s and this is what we did.\n\nVan Halen – Jump\n\nAnd now we’re on to one I’m very, very familiar with. Van Halen turned gears a bit for their 1984 album and Eddie used synth lines to full effect, including as a foundation for this song. The recipe was a successful one and Van Halen rode this to their one and only number one single.\n\nJump hung out on the top of the chart for five weeks. Only one other song did five weeks at number one in 1984 and one other did six weeks bleeding into 1985, both obviously will be covered tomorrow.\n\nI personally love this song. Van Halen and specifically this album got me really into rock music at a young age so this is kind of where things really kicked off for me. It’s easily my favorite of the number one list, though there are plenty of other worthy songs to go over.\n\nKenny Loggins – Footloose\n\nThis is the first of two songs from the film soundtrack that hit number one. It hung out on top for three weeks as soundtracks took over the top spot for awhile in this period of the year.\n\nI don’t have a ton to say about this one. I honestly was never into the movie and I have no affinity for it. I do like Kenny Loggins’ music though and this song is fine, I get why it caught on like it did.\n\nPhil Collins – Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now)\n\nUp next is a song from a different soundtrack, as Phil Collins cut a song for a film of the same name. The song was Phil’s first US number one hit, he would go on to have several more. This one did what seems to be a standard run of three weeks at the chart’s peak.\n\nI only very, very vaguely recall the movie and I can only recall that I think it sucked. The song isn’t nearly that bad although it’s also maybe a bit meh. I’m not down on Phil Collins like a lot of people can be, I’m pretty sure he’s taken so much shit that it makes Nickelback hate look like child’s play. I even like some of Phil’s stuff, both with Genesis and his solo songs. But this one doesn’t quite move me the same way as other songs of his. It’s ok but not one I’d playlist or anything.\n\nLionel Richie – Hello\n\nWe get a brief respite from soundtrack songs as Lionel Richie jumped into the number one fray for two weeks with this slow jam. Richie was becoming quite the megastar during this time, by 1985 he’d be pretty well on top of the world and solidified himself as one of the best-selling artists of the 1980’s. He was all over the place back in the day and this was a time when there were only like three real TV channels, not the wall-to-wall coverage like we have today.\n\nHello is a quiet, soft ballad in the style Richie had taken up for his solo run. It was one of his biggest hits so obviously he got it right. He put together quite the concept piece for a video too, with full on acting and an actual story as opposed to just flashy images and clothing.\n\nDeniece Williams – Let’s Hear It For The Boy\n\nBack to the Footloose soundtrack here for the other number one hit from that record. This was Williams’ second of two number one hits and this one did two weeks on the top. Also of note are backing singers George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam, who would go on to form the writing and performing duo Boy Meets Girl. They would craft a pair of Whitney Houston’s number one hits a few years down the road.\n\nAgain not a whole lot to say here. It’s a fun, upbeat track and I remember this being on radio and TV all the time. A very easy, inoffensive song to play for most any occasion.\n\nCyndi Lauper – Time After Time\n\nUp next is this pop ballad from Lauper, who found her first number one with this and kept the spot for two weeks. She would hit the top again but not for several years, though she had a lot of other hits that were not far off of the top. And she’s an artist that many people might not realize is as successful as she truly is, she’s had quite the career.\n\nThis is a song I do really like and one again I remember fondly from 40 years ago. It’s a nice ballad with some tempo and atmosphere to it and it’s a very sweet and affirming message. Always nice to hear this song.\n\nDuran Duran – The Reflex\n\nWe’ll close out part one of the list with one of two songs to go number one for the iconic British new wave group. The song spent the customary two weeks on the chart before giving way to what became the single of the year. This was also part of a two-song “block” that prevented Bruce Springsteen from having a number one single, a feat the Boss hasn’t accomplished with work he has performed to this day.\n\nThe Reflex is a crazy ass song, in fact this is a dance remix that is different from what is on the studio album. This isn’t my favorite Duran Duran song but I don’t have anything bad to say about it, just not my cup of tea really.\n\nThat wraps up part one. Tomorrow I’ll kick things off straight away with the top song of 1984, a few other titanic cuts including Tina Turner’s massive comeback and Stevie Wonder’s best-charting song, and also what actually counts as the most successful charting song of 1984. Oh, and after nearly three years of writing this blog, I’ll finally get to talk about Wham! Looking forward to it.\n\nFor questions, comments or concerns, use the comment form below or head to my contact page.\n\nThis week’s song pick goes back to 2004 and was the opening track from Lamb Of God’s fourth studio album Ashes Of The Wake. The song was the opening track and was also the “feature” song from the album, though it doesn’t seem to have been “officially” recognized as a single. There is a promo CD single around so it did get a standalone release but not terribly widespread.\n\nThis was a huge step for Lamb Of God. The band were a part of what was termed the “New Wave of American Heavy Metal” movement alongside bands like Shadows Fall, God Forbid and Killswitch Engage. While those other bands would continue to ply their trades on the metal-centric record labels like Nuclear Blast and Century Media, Lamb Of God had struck a major label deal with Epic Records. It was a huge leap for a group that was working day jobs even through the release of their acclaimed prior album As The Palaces Burn.\n\nAs a quick note – the term New Wave of American Heavy Metal is not nearly as developed in a scholarly fashion as the much more familiar New Wave of British Heavy Metal. Thoughts and writings about the American scene are all over the place and can encompass bands from as far back as the 1990’s. But it was commonly used in the early 2000’s for this group of bands.\n\nWhile Lamb Of God were wrapped up with a newer scene term, the basis of their sound was groove metal. It was a noise struck up by thrash acts like Overkill and Exhorder and made popular by Pantera. Lamb Of God released this album awhile after the bitter dissolution of Pantera and just months before the murder of Dimebag Darrell Abbot. It’s not specifically important to know when discussing today’s song, but it does provide background on Lamb Of God’s ascent during this time.\n\nLaid To Rest is an impossibly brutal song in both music and theme. The core of the song is built around guitarist Mark Morton’s absolutely monstrous riffing. According to this 2020 interview with Louder Sound, Morton worked to incorporate more melodic guitar passages to work in contrast with singer Randy Blythe’s harsh vocals. It’s quite the run that Morton makes through this song on six strings and this new focus on working with guitars as Morton did would lead to a new golden age for Lamb Of God.\n\nThe theme of Laid To Rest is a bit buried in vague terms, which was a deliberate act by Morton, who also wrote the lyrics. In the same interview cited above, Morton discussed that the song was about personal issues he was enduring at the time. He covered the specifics of his own issues to dress the song up a bit in a guise that would fit the rest of the album’s general theme, which was taking aim at the Iraq War.\n\nLaid To Rest honesty sounds like a breakup song. It’s not just any kind of breakup, but the harsh, dreadful kind that eats away at your core. Screaming out “destroy yourself – see who gives a fuck” might not be the most healthy way to get over a deep emotional trauma, but hey it works so why not. And while I obviously can’t speculate what Mark Morton’s issues were at the time, I would have to guess that they were along the lines of relationships, but again I don’t know. While very brutal, it can be a cathartic release from any sort of angst or trouble.\n\nBut Laid To Rest can also be taken to fit in the context of war – this song could be about someone who was killed and their remaining spirit looking to see their killer handled. There was certainly a lot of aggression and atrocity in the Iraq War and this could be a tragic tale from someone unjustly killed there.\n\nThe music video does not offer any more clarity as to meaning – instead, it features the band playing in an empty warehouse of some sort, which was a mandatory shooting location for metal videos in the early 2000’s. Interspersed is footage of a guy running from another guy wearing a red hoodie. At the end of the video, the chaser catches the chasee but then the guy being pursued winds up with the hoodie. The off-screen confrontation could have been a violent one, or perhaps the guy in the red hoodie was simply chasing the other guy to try and sell the hoodie to him. We’ll never know.\n\nFor Lamb Of God, Laid To Rest opened the band to a new, wider audience and has become the band’s signature anthem. Ashes Of The Wake would be certified gold in the US and Laid To Rest is the band’s most-played song live. There is stiff competition for that spot as the band’s anthem, as songs like Redneck and Walk With Me In Hell are also up there in popularity, but at the end of the day it appears that Laid To Rest wins that overall battle.\n\nThis was all a huge deal for Lamb Of God as they rose out of the independent metal scene and became players on the upper end of the metal market. They became the new kings of groove metal just as the prior occupant of the throne went away. It’s been a monstrous run and it all kicked off with some guitar work and the use of the word fuck.\n\nQuestions, comments or concerns?

For German metal titans Grave Digger, that first album came in the hallowed metal year of 1984.\n\nGrave Digger – Heavy Metal Breakdown\n\nReleased April 7, 1984 via Noise Records (European release)\n\nGrave Digger formed in 1980 and spent a few years on the live circuit before stepping into recorded music. The band was comprised of Chris Boltendahl on vocals, Peter Masson on guitar, Willi Lackman on bass and Albert Eckardt on drums. Boltendahl remains as the lone original member of the band and even by 1984 the group had replaced a few members.\n\nAll music on Heavy Metal Breakdown is credited to Grave Digger as a collective, while all lyrics were credited to Boltendahl. (with two exceptions noted below) This was due to legal reasons, as the band only had the money to register one person with Germany’s publishing rights group. The album was produced by Grave Digger and Karl-Ulrich Walterbach, the head of Noise Records. Harris Johns engineered the album, he would also produce many of the essential Noise Records releases.\n\nThis album exists in several versions with different tracklists and sequencing. I will be covering the original European release as that’s the LP I have in my collection. The US version was released a bit later in the year and has an extra song and also omits a cover song. Several reissues of this album also exists with plenty of bonus tracks, but again I’m sticking with the original today.\n\nHeadbanging Man\n\nThe opener is a barn-burning speed metal outburst. Boltendahl establishes his trademark snarl on vocals right off the bat while the song bashes through in heavy as hell fashion. No deeper meaning to dig into here – this song is an ode to the now-established metalhead, the headbanging man. The song is quite simple but it’s also very nice and gets the ball rolling well. Grade: A-\n\nHeavy Metal Breakdown\n\nThe title track does not veer too far off of the tone set in the opener. It’s another burst of fury paying homage to the headbanger. It’s easy to laugh at a lyric like “we come to shake your hands and legs as fast as we can do,” but the song rises above any simplicity and offers up a heavy metal triumph. Even in a career spanning 22 albums, this one stands out as the band’s signature song. Grade: A+\n\nBack From The War\n\nThis one starts off with a very cool, ominous intro and first verse passage before kicking into a more thrashy passage that remains through the rest of the song. The song recounts the horrors of war, a tried and true subject within metal. It also has a very long fade-out at the end, which has next to nothing to do with anything, I just wanted to bring it up. Grade: B+\n\nYesterday\n\nGrave Digger decided to switch things up here and offer up something that could be considered a ballad. The song writing here is credited to Beate Marquardt, who I am totally unfamiliar with. It’s not an outright, sap on sap 80’s ballad but it’s a bit of a curveball for the record. It has a few quiet passages in the beginning and middle, but does thrash it up a little bit for the song’s very few lyrics. This one is fine to listen to but also doesn’t really move me all that much. Grade: C\n\nWe Wanna Rock You\n\nWe are back to the main point of the album, which is headbanging. This is another meat and potatoes metal song about heavy metal. Sure it’s basic, but this is the kind of stuff kids lived for in the 1980’s. Another finely done slab of headbanging. Grade: A\n\nLegion Of The Lost\n\nThere’s an acoustic intro here that transitions into a mournful first verse passage, then the speed metal comes back a few minutes in and takes us to the end. This song really goes for the throat and slams the heavy metal home. Grade: A\n\nTyrant\n\nIn shocking news, it’s another crisp headbanging track. Boltendahl gets some screams going here and this one is heavy and also showcasing dynamics. Groovy guitar solo in this one, too. Grade: A-\n\n2000 Light Years From Home\n\nOn the original version of the album we get this cover of the 1967 Rolling Stones song. This cover does not resemble the original song in any way, shape or form – rather than implementing the psychedelia of the Stones song, Grave Digger pound their way through this one in the same fashion they’ve done the rest of this album.\n\nThe production here is pretty rough, this sounds like it was taken from a different session than the other songs. It is a decently done cover song and it’s interesting how Grave Digger twisted the song up to fit their sound, but this is really more of a trivia piece than anything. Grade: C+\n\nHeart Attack\n\nThe closer gets going right away and goes all out, it’s an extra bit of speed on top and this is honestly an outright thrash song. It’s just the right kick in the ass to end the album with, even if the lyrics themselves have absolutely nothing to do with a heart attack. Grade: B+\n\nHeavy Metal Breakdown was a loud and noisy debut for Grave Digger. Like most Noise Records albums, this one did not chart on release. Like many of the Noise releases, this one would spread around the tape traders and heavy metal parking lots of the day as Grave Digger slowly built their name. Separately, Grave Digger didn’t seem to chart at all until 2010, though I can’t totally verify that information.\n\nAnd it would be quite awhile for Grave Digger to get their notoriety – the band scratched through the rest of the 80’s without any real breakthrough. They even shortened their name to Digger and tried to emulate the sounds of the day for a bit. The band then went on hiatus for several years, returning in the early 90’s with a sound somewhere between speed and power metal that Grave Digger would then run with for the ensuing decades.\n\nIt was quite the long road for Grave Digger to get where they were going, but it started in grand fashion with the release of this killer debut album. The production was a tad rough around the edges but the album is still perfectly listenable, and there is no doubt this a heavy metal loving band.\n\nAlbum Grade: A-\n\nWe have plenty of esteemed and celebrated heavy metal albums from 1984, and while Grave Digger never earned the profile of the likes of Maiden or Priest, this band still offered up a fine slab of metal to headbang along with. Germany is one of heavy metal’s most prolific nations and Grave Digger are without a doubt a highlight of that country’s pantheon.\n\nTo see the details of my grading system, head here.\n\nFor questions, comments or concerns, use the comment form below or head to my contact page.\n\nToday I keep rolling with my mini-concept of visiting a song from the years ending in 4. Today I head back to 1994 and I’m finally going to address a song I’ve been dying to write about for awhile now. This was the song from the debut album that really got the ball rolling for England’s revered (and reviled) Oasis.\n\nLive Forever was the third single from the 1994 debut Definitely Maybe. The album is cited for selling over 8 million copies, though no telling how much of that was the white-hot success of the follow-up record. The single did great business, earning Oasis their first UK top 10 hit and also placing at number 2 on the Billboard Alternative Airplay chart, as well as 10 on the Mainstream Rock chart in the US. The single is double platinum in the UK for sales of 1.2 million.\n\nThis song is a bright, positive one with a simple beat and riff that keeps things moving along. The lyrics visit the concept of wanting to shed a mundane life and finding happiness with a close friend or family member. It doesn’t wallow in the angst of being downtrodden, rather the song embraces reality and hopes for something better, coupled with the bond of friendship. While a lot of Oasis songs have lyrics that mean absolutely nothing, the words to Live Forever have a simple yet very powerful meaning to them.\n\nThis was one of the first songs Noel Gallagher started putting together, and it was the one that made him and the other members of Oasis realize they had something special. It was also the song that helped push Oasis over the edge when being offered a record deal by Creation Records. When it was released as a single just in advance of the album, music critics found something a bit more special than the average band in this song.\n\nThere a few bits of trivia here. One is that the vocal melody in the beginning was inspired by the Rolling Stones song Shine A Light. It’s not a rip off or anything like that, but there’s a link there for sure between the chorus of the Stones’ song and the opening line of this one.\n\nAlso, Noel Gallagher was inspired in part by Nirvana to write this song. Not due to any similarity in sound, it was Nirvana and grunge’s bleak outlook that caused Noel ire. Noel heard the Nirvana track I Hate Myself And Want To Die and wound up completing Live Forever. Gallagher was not offering a direct response to the down and out grunge tune – rather he fashioned an antidote.\n\nLive Forever was played 570 times during Oasis’ run, making it their third most played song. It has also been aired out 72 times by Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds since Oasis ended. That is nearly doubled by brother Liam, who has played it out 139 times as a solo artist.\n\nI do hold Live Forever in high regard – awhile back when I ranked my 20 favorite Oasis tracks, this clocked in at third place. It’s a beautiful song that’s honestly perfect for just about any occasion. Feeling bad? Put it on and feel better. Feeling good? Put it on and keep feeling good. It can fit weddings, funerals, celebrations and tragedies of about any kind. Maybe the biggest shame of Live Forever is that Oasis kind of outdid themselves with another song on the next album that fills a similar purpose, though there’s nothing wrong with having both this song and Don’t Look Back In Anger around.\n\nThat about covers it for today. I will be giving Definitely Maybe another look on its 30th anniversary date near the end of August. I covered it in one of my first posts on this site and only three people ever read it so I guess repeating myself is ok in this case. Tomorrow I’ll be back with a song from 2004 and on that is much, much less positive and upbeat than this one. Look forward to it!\n\nLet’s kick off a short run through songs from “The 4’s” and start with the feature year of my site this year, 1984. In shocking news, it’s a song from my favorite band and also just happens to be my favorite song from them.\n\n1984 would be Iron Maiden’s banner year – with the release of Powerslave and the subsequent world tour that went on forever, Maiden were at the forefront of heavy metal during its boom period. The album would go on to pop platinum and gold awards around the world, and todays’ song hit number 11 on the UK charts as the lead single from the album.\n\nAnd yes, before I go on, I have discussed this song a bit previously as part of the singles series I did. Oh well, gonna do it again.\n\n2 Minutes To Midnight is a fast, hard hitting song that keeps it basic. It’s meat and potatoes metal, which Maiden execute well despite being known for their more epic fare. We do get a soaring chorus and a nice guitar solo section, but this tune written by Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson does generally plunge straight ahead.\n\nThe theme here is how the powers that be perpetuate a state of war to keep raking in the money from selling instruments of war. It was a common and corrupt practice through the 1980’s and hasn’t really gone away today. The rank and file people suffer while corporations and politicians feed at the trough, it’s a well-worn theme that hasn’t gotten any better over the past 40 years.\n\nThe song’s title is a reference to the Doomsday Clock, a symbolic device issued by a group of scientists to gauge how close civilization is to a global catastrophe. This classicly meant nuclear war but can also refer to other wild disasters and non-nuclear war threats. 2 minutes was the closest the clock had ever been to midnight, this was set in 1953 during the build-up of the Cold War. Iron Maiden used it as a symbol of world destruction to set with their song about warmongering, a fair pairing if there ever was one.\n\nThe only issue is that the Doomsday Clock has now moved closer than 2 minutes – in 2023 it was set to 90 seconds to midnight, and remains there as of mid-2024. We are setting records, baby!\n\n2 Minutes To Midnight has been one of Maiden’s more recognizable tracks over the years. It’s not quite at the same level as stuff like The Trooper or Hallowed Be Thy Name but the song does qualify as a “greatest hit.” It has been played nearly 1,400 times live, good for 6th-most in the Maiden live pantheon.\n\nThe song’s main riff has been the subject of some funny speculation. The riff is a very generic one that’s easy to play and also can be found all throughout rock history. There’s no telling where it actually first came from – my rough guess is Ritchie Blackmore but I’m honestly not sure about that, it could go back even farther. But some astute listeners picked up on a 1980 song by British group White Spirit, fittingly called Midnight Chaser, with a guitar run that sounds suspiciously familiar to this song. I’ll post the song below so everyone can do their own comparisons if they wish.\n\nIn and of itself this isn’t a huge deal – one, this riff is very stock and I would hesitate to think it could even be copyrighted or whatever. Two, Iron Maiden have “borrowed” from more obscure British acts from time to time, usually with proper settlements in place (depending on who you ask).\n\nBut there is a hilarious coincidence here, and that revolves around White Spirit’s guitar player. He was none other than Janick Gers. Six years after the release of the Iron Maiden song, Janick would find himself in Iron Maiden, replacing Adrian Smith and remaining with the band even when Smith returned in 1999. So maybe, not really but it’s funny to say anyway, maybe Iron Maiden ripped off their future guitar player’s super generic riff. I don’t know.\n\nAs I said above, this is my favorite Iron Maiden song. Yes, I do mean of all their catalog. People do sometimes look at me weird when I tell them that – this one is usually held in high regard but not on the same degree as other songs. And some fans do feel it’s too basic. But it all struck the right chords with me, and I’ve always been a fan of “brink of nuclear disaster” kind of stuff so this checked that box. It was also featured in my favorite video game of all time, the often-mentioned Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, with how much I’ve played it I’ve easily heard this Maiden song more times than any other.\n\nThat’s about all I have to go over today. As part of my 1984 celebration and my perpetual Iron Maiden celebration, I will be giving Powerslave a second look and a proper grading on its 40th anniversary date of September 3rd. The day before will be the normal Album of the Week slot and I’ll have a Maiden double feature then – another Maiden album released on September 3rd will get a reassessment and grading on the 2nd. But we have two months to worry about all of that.\n\nI wanted to drop in real quick and provide an update. This wasn’t planned but I haven’t posted in about two weeks now.\n\nNothing terribly drastic has happened. The short of it is that we were looking to buy a house and it took up a ton of our time. Also we were running into various issues that were slowly sapping time and money away from us, so we made the call to pause our house search until the beginning of next year when we’ll have a bit more money to play with. Things are totally psycho in house-buying land right now.\n\nSuspending our house hunting leads me to some unfortunate news for you, the reader – I will be back to posting next week. I am going to switch up the format a bit for one week. I’ll have four posts and each will be on a song. The songs will hail from 1984, 1994, 2004 and … well, I’ll let you guess the fourth one. After that I’ll resume my normal posting and also get more into the year-long celebration of 1984.\n\nAnd on that note, let’s go ahead and use the rest of this post to talk about a song from 1984, that being the hit single Smooth Operator from Sade.\n\nSmooth Operator hails from Sade’s debut album Diamond Life. This was the third single from that album. The song was originally written by Sade Adu and Ray St. John in their prior outfit Pride. St. John did not follow Adu into her new namesake band, but the song did.\n\nThis single would be a hit, scoring spots on a great deal of international charts but showing especially well in the US, where it landed at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 and took the top spot on the Adult Contemporary Chart.\n\nAs a quick note before I go on, the name Sade clearly references singer Sade Adu, but she very much intended for this group to be considered as a band unit, something she was adamant about through the years.\n\nI’m not going to get too much into it, let’s just kick back and enjoy this great song. It’s a smooth, jazz-based track that gathered about as much crossover appeal as an artist could manage. The song’s about a con artist who gets by with their double crossing ways, though in some extended versions of stuff featuring another song from the album, the perpetrator does get busted. The song would help launch Sade’s career internationally, and the band would go on to have massive sales in the decade after. Cheers to a fantastic cut from 1984."
