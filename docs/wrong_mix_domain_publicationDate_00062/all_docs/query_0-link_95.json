        "text": "The Dispossessed\n\nBy Ursula K. Le Guin,\n\nFrom my list on fantasy-science fiction books that explore class and inequality.\n\nBy Joseph Pitkin Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nMy science fiction and fantasy writing is concerned with the values I was exposed to growing up. As a lifelong Quaker, I have struggled—often unsuccessfully—to live out Quakerism’s non-conformist, almost utopian commitment to equality, simplicity, peace, and community. Not only have I tried to bear witness to those values in my writing, but those ideals led me to my career as an instructor at a community college, one of America’s great socioeconomic leveling institutions. My background as a speculative fiction writer has also made me into a teacher of science fiction and fantasy literature at my college, where I read and came to love the books I recommend here.\n\nJoseph's book list on fantasy-science fiction books that explore class and inequality\n\nWhy did Joseph love this book?\n\nI found this book (whose subtitle is “An Ambiguous Utopia”) one of the most thought-provoking works of fiction I have read.\n\nThe Dispossessed was my first introduction to anarchism as a political platform, and while it didn’t make an anarchist out of me, it was the book that allowed me to imagine anarchism as a coherent political philosophy. Practically every page of the book offers a critique of modern capitalism, and it’s impossible to read this book without considering the structures in our world today that ensure a system of haves and have-nots.\n\nBy Ursula K. Le Guin,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n15 authors picked The Dispossessed as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nOne of the very best must-read novels of all time - with a new introduction by Roddy Doyle\n\n'A well told tale signifying a good deal; one to be read again and again' THE TIMES\n\n'The book I wish I had written ... It's so far away from my own imagination, I'd love to sit at my desk one day and discover that I could think and write like Ursula Le Guin' Roddy Doyle\n\n'Le Guin is a writer of phenomenal power' OBSERVER\n\nThe Principle of Simultaneity is a scientific breakthrough which will revolutionize interstellar civilization by making possible instantaneous…\n\nPreview\n\nWoman on the Edge of Time\n\nBy Marge Piercy,\n\nFrom my list on utopian visions of feminist economics.\n\nBy Karin Schönpflug Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI studied economics and found it incredibly boring, exclusive, and confusing at the same time. Eventually, I discovered feminist economics and realized that economics is loaded with crazy mathematical jargon aiming to hide exploitation processes such as unpaid work in the household, precarious production especially in former colonies of the “Global South”, as well as environmental destruction. I found that utopian and sci-fi novels are not only fun to read but may also carry antidotes to reshape traditional economic thinking. Check out my TEDx talk where I can tell you more about all this.\n\nKarin's book list on utopian visions of feminist economics\n\nWhy did Karin love this book?\n\nThis is an amazing book to really get sucked into.\n\nWritten in 1976, it is a fantasy to go hide in from today’s dystopia of post-COVID and early climate change. You can join 1960s Consuela Ramos in her escape from a forced hospitalization in a mental institution to a utopian world that she visits with Luciente, a time-traveler.\n\nThat future is full of amazing people who do not celebrate hierarchies of race and gender but live in anarchist poly-amorous villages where hard labor is performed by machines and babies are produced in breeders with biological components of three parents.\n\nThe book is rich in blueprints for liberated education, conflict resolution, socio-economic innovation, and relationships. The beautiful world is threatened by a wicked parallel future world that Consuela must help to prevent.\n\nBy Marge Piercy,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked Woman on the Edge of Time as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'One of those rare novels that leave us different people at the end than we were at the beginning.' GLORIA STEINEM\n\n'She is a serious writer who deserves the sort of considered attention which, too often, she does not get...' MARGARET ATWOOD\n\n_______________________________________\n\nOften compared to Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale and Naomi Alderman's The Power - Woman on the Edge of Time has been hailed as a classic of speculative science fiction. Disturbing and forward thinking, Marge Piercy's remarkable novel will speak to a new generation of readers.\n\nConnie Ramos has been unjustly incarcerated in a mental institution with…\n\nPreview\n\nAssata\n\nBy Assata Shakur,\n\nFrom my list on to ignite the revolution and smash patriarchy.\n\nBy Wendy-O Matik Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs a rebellious woman who is passionate about words and the revolutionary force of books, I know the power of stories.

Assata Shakur is a Black revolutionary woman who barely escaped U.S. police corruption, systemic racism, and state oppression, in order to find political asylum in Cuba. To know her story is to acknowledge how White supremacy and anti-Black oppression play out in the lives of Black Americans.\n\nBy Assata Shakur,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Assata as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nOn May 2, 1973, Black Panther Assata Shakur (aka JoAnne Chesimard) lay in a hospital, close to death, handcuffed to her bed, while local, state, and federal police attempted to question her about the shootout on the New Jersey Turnpike that had claimed the life of a white state trooper. Long a target of J. Edgar Hoover's campaign to defame, infiltrate, and criminalize Black nationalist organizations and their leaders, Shakur was incarcerated for four years prior to her conviction on flimsy evidence in 1977 as an accomplice to murder.\n\nThis intensely personal and political autobiography belies the fearsome image of…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Female Man\n\nBy Joanna Russ,\n\nFrom my list on genre mashups in science fiction and fantasy.\n\nBy David Wellington Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nScience fiction and Fantasy have always been about exploring new ideas in novel ways—right from the beginning, Mary Shelley saw the story of Frankenstein as a chance to explore ideas of liberation and equality that, at the time, were too uncomfortable for mainstream stories. Since then many writers have found success by mashing up sf with other literary genres to discover the boundaries—and the gray areas—between them. In my latest book I explore the deep connection between horror (the fear of the unknown) and sf (the drive toward wonder). Some of my most cherished books have similarly charted these murky borderlands.\n\nDavid's book list on genre mashups in science fiction and fantasy\n\nWhy did David love this book?\n\nThis science fiction and mystery story is about an astronaut from a world without men crashes on Earth and blows all our minds… except we’re also reading a story about a woman living in our 1970s, and a parallel Earth where WWII never happened… it gets a little confusing, in a really fun way.\n\nRuss uses this engaging, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic multiverse story to explore topics of sex essentialism and gender fluidity in a way that still feels bracing and mind-expanding today.\n\nYou could say this is as much a philosophical treatise as a novel but that makes it sound like it isn’t any fun, when in fact it’s a blast. If you’re open to a far-out read you will not be disappointed.\n\nBy Joanna Russ,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked The Female Man as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA landmark book in the fields of science fiction and feminism.\n\nFour women living in parallel worlds, each with a different gender landscape. When they begin to travel to each other's worlds each woman's preconceptions on gender and what it means to be a woman are challenged.\n\nAcclaimed as one of the essential works of science fiction and an influence on William Gibson, THE FEMALE MAN takes a look at gender roles in society and remains a work of great power.\n\nPreview\n\nRumi\n\nBy Jalal Al-Din Rumi,\n\nFrom my list on to ignite the revolution and smash patriarchy.\n\nBy Wendy-O Matik Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs a rebellious woman who is passionate about words and the revolutionary force of books, I know the power of stories.

White people are so damn afraid to say the wrong thing or to offend anyone when it comes to the topic of race, that we end up not saying anything at all. And silence is death to a movement. If you care about Black and Brown lives, then this book will shake you up in a good way, and remind you of the importance of being a good listener to the concerns of people of color.

Why do I have to choose between male or female? I resent being given only one gender with no option to explore a spectrum of gender possibilities. The gender battle is raging at the forefront of American politics. If you don’t understand the debate, this is a great book to start with to learn more about gender and identity. The writing is bold, courageous, and hilarious, and does a great job of smashing gender conformity.\n\nBy Kate Bornstein,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Gender Outlaw as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nGender Outlaw is the work of a woman who has been through some changes--a former heterosexual male, a one-time Scientologist and IBM salesperson, now a lesbian woman writer and actress who makes regular rounds on the TV (so to speak) talk shows. In her book, Bornstein covers the \"mechanics\" of her surgery, everything you've always wanted to know about gender (but were too confused to ask) addresses the place and politics of the transgendered and intterogates the questions of those who give the subject little thought, creating questions of her own.\n\nPreview\n\nLilith's Brood\n\nBy Octavia E. Butler,\n\nWhy did Ai love this book?\n\nI recall reading this book during my undergraduate studies, and it was one of the ones I will never forget.\n\nIt speaks about the ways in which humans interact with alien species and how we might come to accept them despite our differences, what we can learn from them, and how it can reshape us for the better. This book explores identity and Otherness and whether we can coexist with a species other than ourselves.\n\nBy Octavia E. Butler,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Lilith's Brood as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe acclaimed trilogy that comprises Lilith's Brood is Hugo and Nebula award-winner Octavia E.

Le Guin,\n\nWhy did Valerie love this book?\n\nThis is an incredibly intricate book, braiding many strands together to tell the story of people who “might be going to have lived a long, long time from now in Northern California.” One thread tying it all together is Stone Telling, a young girl caught between her mother’s rich tribal life and the militaristic city life of the man who is her father. She tells him, “I am a woman, and make my own choices,” but learns that is not the case in the land of the Condors. Her story illuminates two of the many ways to be human. (I’m re-reading this now.)\n\nBy Ursula K. Le Guin,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Always Coming Home as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAn \"ethnographic\" novel that portrays life in California's Napa Valley as it might be a very long time from now, imagined not as a high tech future but as a time of people once again living close to the land.\n\nPreview"
