        "text": "The first poem I would like to introduce is an Anglo-Saxon text called The Wanderer. It is one of the few texts to have survived from the time of the first manuscript poetry. Most of the manuscript poems that survive today were probably written down (according to the Oxford scholar, Richard Hamer) ‘ in Wessex at the end of the tenth century, though in many cases the the poems must have been composed long before in other parts of the country’, Introduction to A Choice of Anglo-Saxon Verse, p.13 (Faber: London, 1970). Only four books, or ‘codices’ of Anglo Saxon poetry from this time survives. And only one version of this poem exists, in a collection of texts which came to be called ‘The Exeter Book’, because the first Bishop of Exeter gave the codex to Exeter Cathedral when he arrived to take up his post in 1050. Read the original Anglo-Saxon text http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/ascp/a03_06.htm.\n\nThroughout this essay I will quote from Hamer’s translation of the The Wanderer.\n\nI mention the fact of The Wanderer‘s historical context because this period in history marks a transition from oral to written poetry. It may be assumed that most Anglo Saxon poetry was oral, and that the written text we see below was one version of a poem that might have been told and re-told for many many years before it was committed to paper. Its oral ‘roots’ can be detected in its written form. In its rarity it is already a treasure. But that isn’t why I am writing about it. It is also a poem of great beauty and emotional and philosophical depth.\n\nThe poem relates the story of an exile, the ‘wanderer’ of the title, who recounts for the poet/ reader his personal experiences since the loss of the life he once led as a warrior under the patronage of his liege lord. This lord once gave him a home, food and good counsel but after his death the warrior is condemned to wander the earth, alone and friendless. ‘Fate is relentless’, he opines.\n\nBut this is a poem of stoic resistance, of hope in the face of despair, as the opening of the poem confirms:\n\n‘Often the solitary man enjoys\n\nThe grace and mercy of the Lord, though he\n\ncareworn has long been forced to stir by hand\n\nThe ice-cold sea on many waterways\n\nTravel the exile’s path’ (Hamer, transl., The Wanderer, op.cit.)\n\nThe picture of physical cold and hardship created in the imagery of stirring the ice cold sea with his hands also reflects the wanderer’s psychological and emotional pain, and yet he still ‘enjoys/ The grace and mercy of the Lord’. In the newly emerging Christian tradition, the exile places his hope in God. Although the social structures he lives within are reminiscent of the pagan Viking world, the wanderer directly links his fate with the fate of the Christian doomed to be an outsider from the world of men.\n\nThis isn’t a work of fundamentalism however, but a poem that shows a transitional movement away from the fatalistic paganism of the the past to the Christianity of the (11th century) present. It is probably because the poem takes an overtly Christian theme at its beginning that it survived at all. And who can say whether the (most likely) monk who wrote it down did not adapt its more pagan aspects to a fit a Christian ideal? It is interesting that the overtly Christian aspects of the poem are at the beginning and the end, while elsewhere the primer mover is ‘fate’. The truth is indiscernible now. What we can see is the delicacy with which the poet describes the emotional struggle of the wanderer as he comes to terms with his fate:\n\n‘Now no living man\n\nExists to whom I dare reveal my heart\n\nOpenly; and I know it for a truth\n\nThat in a man it is a noble virtue\n\nTo hide his thoughts, lock up his private feelings\n\nHowever he may feel. A weary heart\n\nCannot oppose inexorable fate’ (Hamer, ibid.)\n\nThe exile is still a proud man who struggles with himself to retain his outward composure. He cannot reveal his emotions, but locks them away within as so many of us do even today. His sense of isolation is palpable: ‘no living man/ exists to whom I dare reveal my heart’. To me the word ‘dare’ is the most revealing. There is a lot of pain and fear and loss locked away inside him, and it is so great that letting it be seen is a great risk. He is frightened of the consequences, and instead places his hope in spiritual release. Implicitly, God will understand where Man can or will not. Of course, the poet places us, as readers, in precisely this omniscient position. We are witness to the wanderer’s internal struggles, so in fact, even the aethists among us become gods, sympathising with his difficulties.\n\nOne of the real beauties of this poem lies in its depiction of the bleak landscape that the exile now wanders in. It is permanently winter it would seem, with the harsh temperatures and barren landscapes a clear metaphor for the suffering of the man. In one passage, the wanderer describes dreaming of the ‘lordly patron’ who feasted him and his other loyal retainers in his mead hall, remembering the moment where he knelt before him:\n\n‘How in his mind it seems that he embraces\n\nAnd kisses his liege lord, …\n\nBut then the joyless man\n\nWakes up instead and sees instead the yellow waves,\n\nThe sea-birds bathing, stretching out their wings,\n\nWhile snow and hail and frost fall all together.\n\nThe heart’s wounds seem by that yet heavier,\n\nGrief for the dear one gone: care is renewed’ (Hamer, ibid.)\n\nThe vitality of the memory is conveyed in the verbs, ’embraces’, ‘kissing’, emphasising the importance of the close human connection that has been lost. There was affection, respect and belonging in that world, we see. When he wakes up, the wanderer is still, the warmth chilled, an observer rather than an actor. The indifferent birds and the harsh weather simply intensify his grief for the ‘dear one gone’. How can these simple words not create pity and sympathy in the reader? We call to mind our own ‘heart’s wounds’ just as we read of his.\n\nThe wanderer goes on to explain his stoic philosophy, implicitly linked to his ability to survive despite the terrible losses he has suffered:\n\n‘Certainly no man may be wise before\n\nHe’s lived his share of winters in this world’ (Hamer, ibid.)\n\nTherefore, the poem seems to suggest, the suffering that the exile experiences are part of what makes him wiser. But it is undoubtedly a hard lesson. The images of those destroyed by the hand of fate are affectingly described, among them\n\n‘one the grey wolf\n\nConsigned to death; and one a tear-stained hero\n\nConcealed from daylight in an earthly cave’ (Hamer, ibid.)\n\nAs much as this is a poem about a certain attitude to death and human salvation, this is also a poem about the pain of suffering and loss. The ‘tear-stained hero’ is a symbol of someone who was victorious once, over what we will never know. Are the tears on his cheek the hero’s own tears, or the tears of those who mourn him? Grief and regret are intermingled. The image is so compact, and yet so deeply affecting. We readers, almost a millennia later, still know this pain.\n\nFor me, as I have suggested above, the power of this poem is in its emotion resonance. The metaphors and imagery of the exile’s life speak to us of our own humanity. In this world of climate change and economic meltdown it articulates our own fears:\n\n‘Here property and friendship pass away,\n\nHere man himself and kinsmen pass away\n\nAnd all this earthly structure comes to nought’ (Hamer, ibid.)\n\nThis is the impermanent, mortal state of human existence. But there is salvation for the poet, and the exile. For them, heavenly God is their security and their reward lies in heaven. In a secular world however, I believe this poem also offers hope. For all the fact that this is a poem of exile, it is also a poem of encounter. It ends, not with a man walking out into a blizzard of oblivion (or to the easy conclusion of the pearly gates), but to an uneasy acceptance, sheltered, but apart from others. The poet tells the wanderer’s story, and confers on us all the warmth of mutual understanding; the knowledge that no matter how isolated we may feel in our struggles, we are not alone.\n\nIf you are interested in reading more Anglo-Saxon poetry, I would heartily recommend that you purchase Richard Hamer’s collection of poetry referenced above.
