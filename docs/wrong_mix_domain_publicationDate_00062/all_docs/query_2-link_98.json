        "text": "Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, On Revisiting the Banks of the Wye during a Tour. July 13, 1798\n\nBy William Wordsworth\n\nFive years have past; five summers, with the length\n\nOf five long winters! and again I hear\n\nThese waters, rolling from their mountain-springs\n\nWith a soft inland murmur.—Once again\n\nDo I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,\n\nThat on a wild secluded scene impress\n\nThoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect\n\nThe landscape with the quiet of the sky.\n\nThe day is come when I again repose\n\nHere, under this dark sycamore, and view\n\nThese plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,\n\nWhich at this season, with their unripe fruits,\n\nAre clad in one green hue, and lose themselves\n\n'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see\n\nThese hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines\n\nOf sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,\n\nGreen to the very door; and wreaths of smoke\n\nSent up, in silence, from among the trees!\n\nWith some uncertain notice, as might seem\n\nOf vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,\n\nOr of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire\n\nThe Hermit sits alone.\n\nThese beauteous forms,\n\nThrough a long absence, have not been to me\n\nAs is a landscape to a blind man's eye:\n\nBut oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din\n\nOf towns and cities, I have owed to them,\n\nIn hours of weariness, sensations sweet,\n\nFelt in the blood, and felt along the heart;\n\nAnd passing even into my purer mind\n\nWith tranquil restoration:—feelings too\n\nOf unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,\n\nAs have no slight or trivial influence\n\nOn that best portion of a good man's life,\n\nHis little, nameless, unremembered, acts\n\nOf kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,\n\nTo them I may have owed another gift,\n\nOf aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,\n\nIn which the burthen of the mystery,\n\nIn which the heavy and the weary weight\n\nOf all this unintelligible world,\n\nIs lightened:—that serene and blessed mood,\n\nIn which the affections gently lead us on,—\n\nUntil, the breath of this corporeal frame\n\nAnd even the motion of our human blood\n\nAlmost suspended, we are laid asleep\n\nIn body, and become a living soul:\n\nWhile with an eye made quiet by the power\n\nOf harmony, and the deep power of joy,\n\nWe see into the life of things.\n\nIf this\n\nBe but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft—\n\nIn darkness and amid the many shapes\n\nOf joyless daylight; when the fretful stir\n\nUnprofitable, and the fever of the world,\n\nHave hung upon the beatings of my heart—\n\nHow oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,\n\nO sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods,\n\nHow often has my spirit turned to thee!\n\nAnd now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,\n\nWith many recognitions dim and faint,\n\nAnd somewhat of a sad perplexity,\n\nThe picture of the mind revives again:\n\nWhile here I stand, not only with the sense\n\nOf present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts\n\nThat in this moment there is life and food\n\nFor future years. And so I dare to hope,\n\nThough changed, no doubt, from what I was when first\n\nI came among these hills; when like a roe\n\nI bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides\n\nOf the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,\n\nWherever nature led: more like a man\n\nFlying from something that he dreads, than one\n\nWho sought the thing he loved. For nature then\n\n(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days\n\nAnd their glad animal movements all gone by)\n\nTo me was all in all.—I cannot paint\n\nWhat then I was. The sounding cataract\n\nHaunted me like a passion: the tall rock,\n\nThe mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\n\nTheir colours and their forms, were then to me\n\nAn appetite; a feeling and a love,\n\nThat had no need of a remoter charm,\n\nBy thought supplied, nor any interest\n\nUnborrowed from the eye.—That time is past,\n\nAnd all its aching joys are now no more,\n\nAnd all its dizzy raptures. Not for this\n\nFaint I, nor mourn nor murmur; other gifts\n\nHave followed; for such loss, I would believe,\n\nAbundant recompense. For I have learned\n\nTo look on nature, not as in the hour\n\nOf thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes\n\nThe still sad music of humanity,\n\nNor harsh nor grating, though of ample power\n\nTo chasten and subdue.—And I have felt\n\nA presence that disturbs me with the joy\n\nOf elevated thoughts; a sense sublime\n\nOf something far more deeply interfused,\n\nWhose dwelling is the light of setting suns,\n\nAnd the round ocean and the living air,\n\nAnd the blue sky, and in the mind of man:\n\nA motion and a spirit, that impels\n\nAll thinking things, all objects of all thought,\n\nAnd rolls through all things. Therefore am I still\n\nA lover of the meadows and the woods\n\nAnd mountains; and of all that we behold\n\nFrom this green earth; of all the mighty world\n\nOf eye, and ear,—both what they half create,\n\nAnd what perceive; well pleased to recognise\n\nIn nature and the language of the sense\n\nThe anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,\n\nThe guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul\n\nOf all my moral being.\n\nNor perchance,\n\nIf I were not thus taught, should I the more\n\nSuffer my genial spirits to decay:\n\nFor thou art with me here upon the banks\n\nOf this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,\n\nMy dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch\n\nThe language of my former heart, and read\n\nMy former pleasures in the shooting lights\n\nOf thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while\n\nMay I behold in thee what I was once,\n\nMy dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,\n\nKnowing that Nature never did betray\n\nThe heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,\n\nThrough all the years of this our life, to lead\n\nFrom joy to joy: for she can so inform\n\nThe mind that is within us, so impress\n\nWith quietness and beauty, and so feed\n\nWith lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,\n\nRash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,\n\nNor greetings where no kindness is, nor all\n\nThe dreary intercourse of daily life,\n\nShall e'er prevail against us, or disturb\n\nOur cheerful faith, that all which we behold\n\nIs full of blessings. Therefore let the moon\n\nShine on thee in thy solitary walk;\n\nAnd let the misty mountain-winds be free\n\nTo blow against thee: and, in after years,\n\nWhen these wild ecstasies shall be matured\n\nInto a sober pleasure; when thy mind\n\nShall be a mansion for all lovely forms,\n\nThy memory be as a dwelling-place\n\nFor all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,\n\nIf solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,\n\nShould be thy portion, with what healing thoughts\n\nOf tender joy wilt thou remember me,\n\nAnd these my exhortations! Nor, perchance—\n\nIf I should be where I no more can hear\n\nThy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams\n\nOf past existence—wilt thou then forget\n\nThat on the banks of this delightful stream\n\nWe stood together; and that I, so long\n\nA worshipper of Nature, hither came\n\nUnwearied in that service: rather say\n\nWith warmer love—oh! with far deeper zeal\n\nOf holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,\n\nThat after many wanderings, many years\n\nOf absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,\n\nAnd this green pastoral landscape, were to me\n\nMore dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!"
