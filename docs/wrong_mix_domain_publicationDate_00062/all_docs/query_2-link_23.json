        "meta_description": "\"The Wanderer\" is a song by Irish rock band U2, and the tenth and final track from their 1993 studio album, Zooropa. It is one of the few U2 songs without Bono on lead vocals, instead featuring country singer Johnny Cash. Based on the Old Testament's Book of Ecclesiastes and its narrator \"The Preacher\", the song lyrically describes the narrator wandering through a post-apocalyptic world \"in search of experience\", sampling all facets of human culture and hoping to find meaning in life. Cash's haggard voice is juxtaposed against a synthesised bassline and mostly electronic instrumentation.",
