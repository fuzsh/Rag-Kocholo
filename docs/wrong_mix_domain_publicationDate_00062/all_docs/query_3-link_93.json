Now the question is, will they rise to the challenge, or will they succumb to the gathering darkness?\n\nWelcome to the World of Atlaran, where ancient wilderness and ancestral runes clash with modern innovation and arcana.\n\nMany stories unfold every waking moment, but our particular window in time falls around the journey of strangers brought together by chance. In the ancient city of Siger Rejafyr, the rediscovered wonder of flying ships and a grand festival draws in all kinds.\n\nSylfie, a wayward musician whose songs fuel her magic, has taken a job protecting the Kestral airship during her maiden flight at the festival. She meets Jax, a wandering Kotala mage with questionable control of his abilities thanks to a mysterious whalebone ring. Together they happen upon a path that leads them across continents, challenges their morality, and forces one to come face-to-face with demons of their past.\n\nThe Obsidian Archive is a fantasy series of epic proportions based on a Dungeons and Dragons campaign in the homebrew world of Atlaran. The series is penned by Astrid Knight (fantasy author), Blake R. Wolfe (fantasy author), and Taiylor R. Wallace (dungeon master/editor) and is sure to not only take you on a wild adventure through the heart of this incredibly lush world, but also pull on your heartstrings in all the right ways. Perfect for fans of Critical Role, Dimension 20, The Adventure Zone, and The Lord of the Rings.\n\n(NOTE: SIGNATURE WILL BE FOR ASTRID KNIGHT ONLY.
