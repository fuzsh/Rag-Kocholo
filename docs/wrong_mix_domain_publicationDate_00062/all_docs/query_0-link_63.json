If you have anything negative to say about Octavia Butler or Philip Pullman, neither I nor anyone on Earth needs to hear from you. Please no Orson Scott Card suggestions. A favourite when I was in high school, in college I found out that he’s a publicly homophobic bigot (you can google his name + homophobia if you want to know more) and that Ender, which most readers assume is a castigation of child abuse and the use of child soldiers, is actually a prescription for those things. When I (with hesitation) broke the news to my friend’s daughter, she was upset, as I had been, but very brilliantly responded: “I think the author’s intention doesn’t really matter after a certain point. The reader gets to interpret what they’ve been given however they want to. Sometimes the author thinks they’re saying one thing, but really they’re saying something completely different.”\n\nIt turned into an interesting discussion about how, often, bigotry is rooted in self-hate and the suppression of the hater’s own desires, or their jealousy of someone else’s ability to self-express and live a genuine life. Many of the titles on this list take place in dystopian futures, but conversations with kids like her give me a lot of hope for this world."
