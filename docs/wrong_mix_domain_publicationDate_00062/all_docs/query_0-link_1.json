        "text": "Alec Weisbrot Ms. Lovegren English IV\n\nThe Exterer was created by Anglo Saxon poets. They created this manuscript with poems and religious verses inside. There are three poems that stand out and each has a shared theme. In “The Seafarer,” “The Wanderer,” and “The Wife’s Lament,” the Anglo Saxon poets exemplify the idea that life has only one true meaning and that meaning results in death. “The Seafarer” discusses the life of a man alone traveling the seas. It describes his loneliness and grief. The lone man explains the weaks’ power and that the power and riches doesn’t have true value. “The Wanderer” explains the life of men exiled and alone.

She suffers profound emotional pain once she is separated from her husband. She is longing for him only to learn that it was her husband that had plotted behind her back. He had abandoned her, all his moves were calculated, and she realizes that “behind his smiling face,” her life was as she knew, was lost with her love for her lying husband, as if to death. Through this poem, we see an Anglo-Saxon life from a perspective of a woman and we understand the lives and roles of women in that"
