        "text": "Quick Overview\n\nThe Eternal Wanderer interweaves history and myth as it follows two main characters that strive to understand the purpose with which God has endowed them. The first is the eponymous wanderer, a man cursed by God for refusing one of His blessed the grace of resting against the wall of his home. The wanderer, who is based on the medieval European legend of the Wandering Jew, is punished to traverse the earth forever, never knowing shelter nor companionship. Readers journey with him as he struggles to comprehend the meaning behind his punishment, visiting the 14th-century Louvre and Sulton’s mythical eternal city of Khaybar. The second character is the genetic scientist Professor Ziyo (Ziyo means intellect in Uzbek). Through his narrative, we learn of a new eternal being created by genetic engineering, and we see how this Uzbek intellectual endeavors to reconcile his empirical mind with his belief in God. Sulton leaves us to contemplate whether Ziyo accepts God or not or whether his acceptance matters at all because he and most life on earth are destroyed by an apocalypse. Ziyo’s struggle ends, while the wanderer’s continues. The apocalypse that ends the novel is not the last one.\n\nThe novel is written very much in the magical realist style for which Central Asia and the Caucasus have come to be known through writers like Chingiz Aitmatov and Fazil Iskander. However, Sulton presents a unique perspective, writing from his spiritual experiences and knowledge of Islam, which his Soviet predecessors were not allowed to address. Through a syncretism that combines Quranic stories, a knowledge of Islam local to the Ferghana valley, Christian legends, and Eurasianist mythology, Sulton suggests that all of us are, like his eternal wanderer, beings in search of a path to God. The universalism of this novel is of particular interest because it undermines both the ethno-centric nationalism and the state-enforced Islamic orthodoxy of post-Soviet Uzbekistan."
