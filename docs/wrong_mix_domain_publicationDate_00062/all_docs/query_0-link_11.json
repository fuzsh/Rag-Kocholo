        "text": "Dear Friends,\n\nIt’s time to start writing for this space. I begin with transposing thoughts and analysis of three books I read recently which meant much to me.\n\nThree weeks ago now, most of this reading late at night or in the early morning hours (watching the pre-dawn blue show up in the sky), I read one of the finest memoirs I’ve read in a while: Suzy McKee Charnas’s my father’s Ghost: the return of my old man and other second chances The central story line of the book is a moving and truthful account of Charnas taking her father in when he was no long able to support himself at all and seemed to be going blind, a father who abandoned her and her sister when they were young: she is told the mother had told him to get out, but with good reason. Charnas wants to show truthfully what a parental child relationship really is; about half-way through she’s exposing the US lack of any help for aging people and what their adult children end up having to do late in life. This is sobering and for anyone in their sixties (like me) who has an aged P it gives pause. She does manage to find a decent place for the old man as these things go. I doubt I do anywhere near as well for my mother if I had to do such a thing; luckily my mother has much more money and has been able all her life to manage this sort of thing, even if awkwardly and with stress. Charnas’s father lacked the tact and will.\n\nAs the book opens Charnas has moved with her husband, Steve Charnas, from NYC to New Mexico to find a cheap enough place & area of quiet peace to allow her to be a writer for life. She never made big sums in the years to come but did make a modest (she never had a book become a movie, but has had them made into plays) living from her books and still does. They lived in a cottage with a corrugated roof and she wrote in a shed. The husband worked as an attorney. They had and have no children together, but rather a stepchild (or two, it’s not clear) from his previous marriage. Over the course of the book we learn about her mother, that she is half-Jewish, that the wedding she had with Steve is Jewish in its ceremony, about her sister, a half-brother, and a little about her writing career (very candid here). Her own autobiography is glimpsed in the stages of telling her relationship with her father then and now.\n\nCharnas seems to me a good example too of a woman not quite making it the way she should and bending to the marketplace in order to survive — as Marge Piercy did not have to (or not as much). I loved Piercy’s Sleeping with Cats which I compared to Charnas for equal honesty. Piercy is bolder, less conscious of how she will come across and contradictory currents, more passionate, and also capable of more shmaltziness, less truthful. I remembered Bobbie Ann Mason’s Clear Springs too, at least up to the time Mason becomes an adult and goes into her career, then she shuts down and hides the realities. Perhaps the reason it’s often been noted chapters on the early life of someone are much more vivid is the writer is willing to tell much more, not ashamed, not worried about who will be exposed since it’s long ago the people are dead. Charnas takes the other tack: the woman in the middle, in her forties is where she begins, ending in the women in her early sixties.\n\nCharnas has a real sense of what’s funny too: about cats she is wry. Marge Piercy came to mind since Suzy’s father kept a cat he cannot take with him to the retirement home, and at the end of one chapter she muses what it is we feel for cats we call love.\n\nThe memoir was for me unbearably touching at the close. I think Charnas’s unflinching honesty and the sheer plainness of the style as if only by saying what is without ornamentation could she hope to commemorate and understand this relationship adequately. Any false sentiment or gliding over would falsify and thus ruin the text by which she sought to do justice to her father’s failed (as he saw it) life. I made me feel guilty about my mother but like her in the book (worse, I’m worse) I can’t do what I can’t do, and it’s no good to sentimentalize for what you confront the person again the reality check is a wall all over again.\n\nShe does dream of him after he dies, but the metaphor of the ghost is that he was a ghost of himself when he arrived in her life in 1972. Thinking about his solitary person-apart life she has this to say about her fiction:\n\n“So much of my fiction centers on unlikely bridge-building over yawning gulfs — between humans and animals, between aliens and earthlings, between natural an supernatural beings, between plain men and women, … The solitary man, the alienated intelligence gifted with insight and intelligence often shows up in my work — as victim, as predator, as baffled, struggling creature, fascinated and appalled by the frightful power of and necessity for love, the need for intimacy that expresses our deepest humanity (p. 301)\n\nIs not this a portrait of Weyland in Charnas’s intelligent gothic, Vampire Tapestry (one of the books I read with my students this term)? He is victim and predator. In my last choice too, a modern serious gothic, Michel Faber’s horror gothic, science ficition, allegory Under the Skin there too we have a monster at the center of a story we are asked to empathize with, baffled & struggling. Weyland is baffled in the last story and the urge is towards death, as the central character of Under the Skin.\n\nMore broadly, the memoir is (like Obama’s Dreams from my Father), a depiction of American life. We see how disparate is the family, not a tight-knit domestic unit which keeps well apprised of one another, but living at a distance more both emotionally and spatially. I compared it to the equally moving and more intellectually probing memoirs of Margaret Forster (which I’ve talked about on “Ellen and Jim have a blog, too”): Hidden Lives & Precious Lives. Forster similarly addresses many painful realities of growing old, of family relationships, of existences deprived and thwarted by social demands and arrangements most private selves can’t cope with. She too had a father who had a mean tongue. This I cannot take myself. There were striking contrasts I saw as I went along too, mostly showing how much closer (whether for good or bad) English family life is, lived nearer the edge and (paradoxically because so controlled on the surface) sharing inner thoughts and needs more, though not explicitly. Kinder on the surface.\n\nI did so like Charnas’s Dorothea Dreams, about a poet, a solitary women (a Dorothea who is a lesbian turns up in Chapter 5 of The Vampire Tapestry). I wish Charnas would write more realistic fiction for adults, more memoirs.\n\n*************\n\nA second book that’s meant much to me in the hours of the night — and also on buses, trains, waiting for the Admiral to pick me up at a train station, has been Colm Toibin’s The South. I’ve learned to love this man’s fiction (as I do Kazuo Ishiguro’s) as well as eagerly look for essays by him in the LRB and NYRB. This one I read to know more about the man who wrote the remarkable The Blackwater Lightship which I read with my class. It takes us through the life of Katherine Proctor: we watch her leave her husband & son in southwest Ireland and meet in Barcelona & take up a new life with Miguel, an anarchist veteran of the Spanish civil wars. They meet, go to bed with one another, and spend long hours drinking and sitting and looking at the landscape. Then they begin to paint together in a humble hut deep in the mountains near Barcelona. Gradually they are joined by another Irish wanderer, Michael Graves, and other Spanish friends of Miguel. They have a child; they claim to be married.\n\nWhat emerges is both are walking wounded from war, she from her experience of civil war in Ireland, he from memories of torture (and he is tortured again during the novel). She cannot live with those who do not sympathize or understand her. I don’t think it’s about her desire for freedom so much as to be left alone to express herself which her husband & son would not permit. Miguel commits suicide, taking with him the child she has by him, and she has to return to Ireland for lack of funds. Her mother supports her for a while, and at the end of the book in old age, her son (whom she abandoned) has provided a cottage for her to paint in. Her son has compromised; he lives with a wife much inferior to him in understanding and dissipates his life away in socializing, which he defends as cheering.\n\nIt’s hard to say why this is so good. It is again the honesty but also the lyricism of the prose which is addictive (rather like Faber’s hauntingly at times beautiful Under the Skin). Toibin’s connects to Blackwater Lightship where again we have candid portraits of jagged family lives. Also to his The Master about Henry James, another solitary person separated from his family, creating a new world for himself from his writing and a few friends. I found it comforting to spend time with Katherine even though she experiences such tragedy precisely because the surface of this book is based on an utter anomie. It is a book without cant.\n\n*************\n\nI keep up my comfort women’s books: my latest was Miss Webster and Cherif by Patricia Duncker. Its secret I finally decided is that the narrator, a spinster forcibly retired from her job teaching French on the grounds she persisted in really teaching the subject and then left to rot by herself, whereby she has a complete breakdown, ends up in hospital and goes to Africa to recuperate (!), and her young black male Muslim companion, Cherif, are naifs, kindly honest innocents abroad (abroad being the world), from different points of view, who look out at the mad world and go about failing in good spirits. One beautiful paragraph about how much her home means to her:\n\n“She looked around at her books, pictures, heavy lined green curtains, the framed photographs of landscapes in France, the new DVD player, and realised that she was speaking the truth [she has just said ‘I’d never leave the cottage. I’d rather die here’]; this was her tomb, her pyramid, the final resting place” (p. 161).\n\nI love how she and he walk through St James park, and “settle down with a thermos of tea before the ducks and daffodils” and later “ponder the assembled ducks and floods of daffodils, sweeping across the greening lawns” (p. 171-72).\n\nEllen"
