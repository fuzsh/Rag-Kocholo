        "text": "Travel has been in Jim White's bones since before he was born. His father was a US navy flight surgeon - \"he was a pilot and a doctor, he could fly a plane or take care of somebody if they got sick\" - and spent much of his time driving across America between naval bases in San Diego, California and Pensacola, Florida. Jim was conceived during one of these gruelling trips, and he can identify when exactly.\n\n\"I don't communicate much with my mom,\" says White, \"but one day she told me how I was conceived. They were having dinner in a restaurant while driving across country and some priests were sitting across from them. My poor sisters lived in mortal fear of my father, who was a real strict authoritarian, and the priests saw this terrified young family and thought they must be Catholics. So they sent them complimentary drinks, and my father toasted the Pope, thinking, 'Here's a free drink'. Then they sent him a bunch more drinks and my parents got really drunk. And I guess the infrequency of their relations at that time meant that they could tell the precise moment that I was conceived.\"\n\nNext morning the family piled back into the car and drove away, imparting a sense of perpetual motion into the baby-to-be. \"So,\" says White, \"my whole life I've been obsessed with getting in the car and driving at 50mph away from wherever I was. I still have to do it because I'm a musician.\" And that's why White wrote a song called God Was Drunk When He Made Me.\n\nWhite and I meet in Paris, at a friendly little venue called La Maroquinerie, where he has just spent the soundcheck trying to knock his new band into shape. They're playing a string of European concerts in support of his new album, Drill a Hole, and translating the disc's fragile atmospherics and subtle layerings into a regular rock band format is proving tricky. White's excellent squad of musicians can swap between two or three instruments, but they still have to play defined parts, and songs like Static on the Radio or If Jesus Drove a Motorhome need to drift past in a haze. White's soft Florida accent and courteous manner suggest he is amiable and laid-back, but from the way he pounces on a faulty harmony or an ill-timed instrumental break, it seems he has inherited dad's military discipline.\n\nWhite says that \"sometimes I'm labelled an oddball\", but he must have been called worse things than that. His life story has been a hair-raising ride through rejection, drug abuse and breakdowns, except for the past few years when he finally found his identity, and began making some of the most haunting, tantalising music you could wish to hear. Drill a Hole is his third album for David Byrne'sLuaka Bop label, following on from Wrong-Eyed Jesus and No Such Place, and it's remarkable for the way it blends White's dense imagery with a funk/blues/Cajun/ambient fusion that seems to exist as much in the mind as in a defined physical space.\n\nIt was the Wrong-Eyed Jesus album that seized the attention of film-maker Andrew Douglas, whose documentary for the BBC's Arena, Searching For the Wrong-Eyed Jesus, uses White's music and natural talents as a mythologiser as guides on a mysterious journey through the hinterlands of the American south. From bayou shacks to trailer parks, ecstatic Pentecostal services to the Where Jesus is Lord truckstop diner, it illuminates a land that time forgot, riddled with folklore, poverty, raw and soulful folk music and a sense of holy dread that most city-dwellers have lost touch with.\n\n\"It was real nice suddenly having something that brings a little more clarity to my peculiar perspective,\" White says. \"I wanted them to use Johnny Dowd in the film, because I thought he was better to present what they were interested in in the south, but they liked the idea of somebody who wasn't a southerner presenting it, somebody familiar with the ideas and hidden currents in the south but not an insider.\"\n\nWhite considers himself a rootless person who was southernised, rather than a true southerner. Maybe his outsider's eye gives him a sensitivity to details the locals miss, like the guy dressed as Jesus who drives a motorhome with a cross on the back (the source for If Jesus Drove a Motorhome), or Pensacola's 10 Mile Road and Nine Mile Road, which prompted the song Ten Miles To Go on a Nine Mile Road.\n\nAs a teenager, he came into contact with the hysterical rituals of the Pentecostal church and thought he'd found an answer to being \"a lost soul drifting in the drug world. A couple of my friends had died from overdoses, and I was lost. In Pensacola there's this big fat soul-dead middle class, then there's the crazy sinners in the bars, and there's the Pentecostal people.\"\n\nInstant salvation was on offer, and the 15-year-old White took the bait. But his new off-the-peg personality never fitted, and he spent the next couple of decades trying to work out what he was looking for. He became an expert surfer, and was about to attend the US surfing championships in Hawaii when he broke his leg. Laid up and depressed, he started learning the guitar, though he didn't begin to develop a distinctive style of his own until he damaged three fingers in a carpentry accident, which forced him to simplify his technique.\n\nBut he had no idea music would earn him a living, and in his 20s the tall, cowboy-thin White drifted around Europe as a fashion model. \"I'd go to Milan when I knew the other models weren't there, like in August. Vogue or Linea Italiana have to do reshoots in August for their big October issues, so I'd sit in a hotel room all month hoping I'd get a job.\" Fast-forward to Jim as a taxi-driver in New York, after he'd suffered a nervous breakdown because of \"a crisis of faith\". Having climbed aboard the Lord's glory train, he couldn't comprehend all his disasters. \"I was a fundamentalist Christian and a series of tragedies befell me, and it made me say, 'What is that Nick Cave thing? I don't believe in an interventionist God.' I suddenly didn't think God was up there pulling puppetstrings. To say that when you've been indoctrinated for 15 years feels like betraying God.\"\n\nDriving a cab during the New York crack epidemic - when drivers would regularly be shot and robbed of $10 by desperate addicts - almost finished him off, and he remembers driving around the city in tears in \"a life-threatening depression\". He recalls a bizarre incident when he spotted David Byrne on the pavement and cruised up behind him, shouting \"super-white\", apparently intending it as an accolade for Byrne's ability to be cool yet also white and nerdy. White had shaved his hair into a Mohican like Travis Bickle in Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, and Byrne wisely fled into the nearest shop.\n\nBut it was Byrne who flung White a lifeline three years later, responding to the demo tape he'd sent in and letting him make an album. Not that it has brought him untold riches. \"I do this for the minimum wage,\" he says, preparing to take the stage in Paris. \"The only way I make money is by selling CDs and T-shirts.\" After the show, he unpacks boxes of discs at the front of the stage, and urges the crowd to come on down. He's just happy he's found a place in the world."
