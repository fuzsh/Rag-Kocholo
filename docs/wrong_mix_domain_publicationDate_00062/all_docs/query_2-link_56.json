        "text": "\"The Wanderer’s Tethering\" premiered last year in June at Hibernian Hall in Roxbury and will stage its second performance April 6 at the Prior Performing Arts Center at the College of the Holy Cross. The piece was commissioned by the Boston Lyric Opera, with poetry written and performed by Boston Poet Laureate Porsha Olayiwola, music by composer, multimedia artist and vocalist Mason Bynes, and performances by Castle of Our Skins and Boston Lyric Opera vocalists.\n\nThe piece is the second installment of the Boston Lyric Opera Poetry in Music Series that creates collaborations between Boston-based poets and composers to create new musical works and experiences.\n\nMaking connections\n\nThe plot of \"The Wanderer’s Tethering\" is centered around the 1803 Igbo revolution in Georgia, where a group of Igbo slaves engaged in an act of mass resistance, choosing drowning by suicide in the Dunbar Creek over enslavement. The piece imagines a contemporary Igbo descendant, Tobi, reflecting back on her ancestors through a series of vignettes.\n\nThe libretto was the first element created in the making of the piece, Bynes explained. After Olayiwola wrote the poetry, the Boston Lyric Opera approached Bynes to compose the music. The project was presented as a reflection on being part of two diasporas, both as a Nigerian American and a Black American, something the main character and Olayiwola have in common.\n\nBynes identified with the piece as well: “for myself, as being a Black American and not having all the parts of my own history or where in the diaspora me and my family come from, the story really resonated with me.” Ultimately, this connection led her to agree to the collaboration.\n\n'To tell the truth about something'\n\nIn the end, Bynes had to create a relationship between the three main elements: vocalist Brianna J. Robinson, a string quartet (a collaboration with Black Arts Institution, Castle of Our Skins), and Olayiwola’s spoken word. While composing, she looked for moments that the two identities of the character interacted within the series of vignettes Olayiwola wrote, and began to create motifs of ways that the two identities were connected.\n\nAdditionally, she had to choose how the three elements would work together to tell a complete story, studying how they complimented each other, choosing which would take the foreground and which would be the background as the story unfolds.\n\n“Jokingly, I like to express myself as a sound sommelier, “ Bynes said. “It is fun to find ways to mix and pair things to tell the truth about something. I really enjoy it when there are a lot of crayons to color with.”\n\nMore: Building tomorrow today: For Women’s History Month, profiles of movers and shapers\n\nMore: 'April Sweepers': A prose poem by Oliver de la Paz\n\nThis resulted in a multi genre performance, combining Negro Spirituals, Igbo folklore music, and classical music. Specifically, Bynes looked for Spirituals about “resisting while embracing who you are” while combining them with elements of Black classical literature, such as Langston Hugh’s poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” and parts of Igbo folklore. While writing the music, Bynes asked Porsha to send her recordings of her reading the poetry and studied her inflection and what parts were read more intensely or with more emotion.\n\nBynes saw this as a chance to further explore interactions between dialogue and music when they exist on the same plane.\n\nAllowing identities to be represented\n\nPrior to its premiere performance, Bynes sought the advice of musician, Pulitzer Prize winner and MacArthur Fellowship recipient: Rhiannon Giddens.\n\n“One thing that I was concerned about or just had anxiety about as a composer,” she shared, “was allowing both identities to be represented correctly or just represented authentically.” Giddens challenged Bynes to instead think about how the two identities could be musically stitched together, “that was a brilliant piece of advice that took the piece where it needed to go.”\n\n\"The Wanderer’s Tethering\" is an operetta where the main character seeks to be grounded in her identities. Through its multidisciplinary and multi genre performance, the audience explores the question with Tobi, a question still relevant today to the many members, robbed of the knowledge of their own family origins, of the Black diaspora in the United States. It itself is a monument to untold histories, both in events, such as the 1803 Igbo rebellion and musical landscapes, such as the influence of Igbo folk music in the United States.\n\nTickets for the April 6th performance are available on the Prior Performing Arts Center’s website.\n\n'The Wanderer’s Tethering'\n\nWhen: 3 p.m. April 6\n\nWhere: Prior Performing Arts Center, Luther Concert Hall, College of the Holy Cross, 1 College St., Worcester"
