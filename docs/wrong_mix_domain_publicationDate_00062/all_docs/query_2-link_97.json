        "text": "Ernie Maresca wrote a wealth of great Rock 'n' Roll and DooWop songs - perhaps most famously The Wanderer and Runaround Sue for Dion.\n\nHis songs were recorded by many other bands of the era, and Maresca also released many as an artist in his own right.\n\nThis 30 track collection features both his own performances, together with his songs performed by Dion, The Regents, The Runarounds, The Delrons, The Belmonts, The Hubcaps and many others.\n\nNotable inclusions are two versions of The Wanderer - the first is an alternate version by Dion (actually Dion's first take of the song), and the second being Maresca's original demo recording."
