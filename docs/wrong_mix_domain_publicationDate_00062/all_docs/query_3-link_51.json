        "text": "If you enjoy postmodern writing, read this book. If you have not yet\n\nexperienced postmodern writing, read this book and start enjoying\n\npostmodernism. As defined by Régine Robin, teacher, novelist, and\n\nwinner of the 1987 Governor General’s Award for nonfiction, postmodern\n\nwriting has “NO ORDER. No chronology, no logic, no lodging. Nothing\n\nbut a desire for writing and this proliferation of existence.”\n\n“Montreal’s grande dame of postmodernism,” as Robin was called by\n\nLe Devoir for her work on literary theory, “makes her reader travel\n\nthrough the carnavalesque … the multicoloured stuff of this wandering\n\nhumanity.”\n\nHer book tells no story. It expresses instead the thousand faces of\n\nwandering, of exile—a world in which a Gauloise may be the only\n\npermanence. Yet no such cigarettes exist in Auschwitz, a place that\n\ncannot be signified by a metaphor. Robin’s female protagonist\n\nsimultaneously experiences London, Berlin, Budapest, Paris, New York,\n\nand Montreal. In each city, she has “the eternal feeling of being\n\nelsewhere, uprooted.” Restaurant menus, hockey timetables, real-estate\n\nlistings, lists of subway stations, and excerpts from literary and\n\nphilosophical texts are juxtaposed in a novel that brings together a\n\nmultiplicity of languages and voices.\n\nRobin’s translator, Phyllis Aronoff, has done a magnificent job of\n\ntranslating this nonstory of a migrant writer. First published in 1983\n\nunder the title La Québécoite, The Wanderer is a disconcerting,\n\npolitical, and entertaining work of (auto)fiction."
