Sophie’s cousin Cody isn’t so sure he has the strength to prove himself to the crew and to his father.\n\nThrough Sophie’s and Cody’s travel logs, we hear stories of the past and the daily challenges of surviving at sea as The Wanderer sails toward its destination—and its passengers search for their places in the world.\n\n“Sophie is a quietly luminous heroine, and readers will rejoice in her voyage.” —BCCB (starred review)"
