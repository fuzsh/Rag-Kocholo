        "text": "WHEN THE DEAD STOP BY by Joan L. Siegel\n\nThe screen door swings wide open from\n\nan autumn long ago. This time\n\nhe enters without knocking, wears\n\nhis old brown shoes. Between the moon-\n\nlight and his face, the leaves rain gold\n\nand orange on pale meadow sweet.\n\nTwo Adirondack chairs lean in.\n\nAmazed he sees impatiens bloom\n\nred hot. He won’t account for time.\n\nTell how it feels to be outside\n\nof time. Instead he asks about\n\nmy mother. Isn’t she with you?\n\nJust then the picture sputters, blinks,\n\nunreels itself. The screen goes blank.\n\nBLOOD by Joan I. Siegel\n\nThis morning a missile exploded\n\nthe house. His sister and brother blew up\n\nwith the chairs and windows. It rained\n\nsister and brother on his face.\n\nNow he sits on the hospital floor. Bleeding.\n\nWaiting. His mother so still, her face\n\nturned his way on the gurney. Her blood\n\nfinds his on the floor.\n\nLong before he was born, their river\n\nof blood was one. She told him –\n\nwhen the world was a still place,\n\nshe’d listen to it murmuring through them.\n\nJoan I. Siegel is co‑author of Peach Girl: Poems For A Chinese Daughter (Grayson Books, 2001). Her poetry has appeared in The Atlantic Monthly, Commonweal, The Gettysburg Review, Prairie Schooner, Witness, and in the anthologies Poetry Comes Up Where It Can (University of Utah, 2000), Beyond Lament (Northwestern, 1998), and Blood to Remember: American Poets on the Holocaust 2nd edition (Time Being Books, 2007). This is her third appearance in Alaska Quarterly Review.\n\nNEW YEAR’S EVE by Catie Rosemurgy\n\nThe lake wouldn’t let us in. We had to walk on it\n\nlike a family of children talking to a mother’s grave.\n\nThe snow lifting from the ice was like a face\n\nbreaking apart. Our own skin held tight\n\nbut smelled crushed\n\nlike mint. The wind had licked the sky clean,\n\nbut then we showed up with our pulses\n\ntucked in gloves. We stood out\n\nagainst the blankness like creatures\n\nthat needed to be studied. Even the color\n\nof my cousin’s jacket was portentous.\n\nThe darkness we stood on\n\nwould’ve been bottomless if it were summer\n\nand we would’ve stood on it anyway.\n\nWhat had crawled into our hearts?\n\nWe were losing track of one another\n\nand the shore. My aunt appeared briefly\n\nand touched my cheek\n\nto reacquaint herself with flesh. We were at home in nothing\n\nwe could survive. The night had hardened\n\nand gotten heavier. The stars dropped it.\n\nWe were sent to witness\n\nour inability to pick it up.\n\nWe were our true selves briefly.\n\nCatie Rosemurgy is the author of the poetry collections My Favorite Apocalypse (Graywolf Press, 2001) and the forthcoming, The Stranger Manual (Graywolf Press). Her recent poems appear in American Poetry Review and Boston Review.\n\nHEAVEN AND THE FALLEN WORLD by Eva Saulitis\n\nTo stand in the woods and watch the St. John’s Day fire,\n\nthe Latvians holding glasses of schnapps, to stand\n\nin the woods unseen, to watch the women in knee-length\n\nskirts, in pantyhose and pumps, the men stripped\n\nof their ties and jackets. To see them\n\nagain, Mr. and Mrs. B, oak leaf wreaths crowning\n\ntheir heads, leaning against each other\n\nand singing, as if nothing’s happened.\n\nAs if Mr. B had never collapsed dead\n\nat his carpentry bench, as if Mr. K had never\n\ndiscovered the spot on his lung. To see the men light\n\neach other’s smokes between songs, light them from\n\ntheir own burning ends, tossing the butts into the fire.\n\nTo see anorexic Mrs. K crunching almonds\n\nsnuck from her pocket. As if she still had a stomach.\n\nTo see her again in her tan pantsuit, the amber\n\nrings loose on her fingers, as if she still had limbs.\n\nThe men heave more logs onto the fire like there’s no tomorrow.\n\nThrough the dark back yard, my mother strides to the house\n\non two strong legs, she’s going to fetch the janu siers,\n\nyellow and dense, studded with seeds.\n\nJust this morning she must have unpeeled\n\nthe cheesecloth, placed the loaves on platters.\n\nTo see her hurrying like she’d never\n\nhad an aneurysm. To see my father reaching\n\nfor the next bottle. Like the past wasn’t banging\n\non the door of the house, wearing an SS uniform.\n\nTo see him pulling out the cork,\n\nas if he had never, at 85, opened that door,\n\nand invited the war back in.\n\nJust like the old times. Soon the neighbors will call\n\nthe police, now that the fire’s so big, now that it’s\n\nmidnight and the ancestors have arrived, armed\n\nwith their kokles and pranks. To see them jumping\n\nover the flames, singeing the hems\n\nof their tautus terpas, chasing each other through\n\nthe garden. To hear the songs\n\ngetting older, calling up the gods\n\nof thunder and fire. To see Mr. K\n\nfeeling up my mother, his big hand crawling along\n\nher thigh. To see my father checking out\n\nthe breasts on a Baltic beauty who’s just arrived\n\nfrom 1904, a basket of blackberries in her arms.\n\nAnd that’s the last straw. I slip into\n\nthe woods like I did as a girl after crawling\n\nout my bedroom window. I run through the trees,\n\nup the bank to the vacant lot where the boyfriend\n\nsits in the car, smoking, waiting for me,\n\nwaiting to take me out\n\nof this nightmare, into his own American version,\n\nhis right hand on my thigh, the left handing me\n\nthe bottle of wine, the sweet kind that tastes\n\nlike blackberries, that makes me believe\n\nthere might be a heaven.\n\nSONG OF THE JEALOUS BIRD by Eva Saulitis\n\nIn this perpetual\n\nApril light, how drab,\n\nmy garments. But not you,\n\nmy baby, my bunting, indigo,\n\nor you the scarlet\n\ntanager. I am jealous,\n\nbirds. You undo\n\nmy buttons. Rest, you say,\n\nbut there is much\n\nto protect, so I sing night\n\nand day, no matter that it comes\n\nout as sobbing. And your buzz\n\nand chortle. Don’t cross\n\nover this line, bobolink.\n\nwhite-crowned sparrow.\n\nBirch trees, I drink your sap, I cast\n\na spell lest the telephone\n\nring, and you all asquabble.\n\nTest me now. Why, you’ve\n\na glaucous gown, a veil\n\nof ambition. Who shall\n\nyou wed, oh black-\n\nbacked woodpecker, oh violet-\n\ngreen swallow? Succor of snowmelt\n\nto hold you under. Silence\n\nthe jabber, whippoorwill\n\nbig mouth talker. Here, and here,\n\nI mark my limits, with these bright\n\nacoustics and this my\n\ncape of rare feathers, skins\n\nof small, precious birds\n\nI’ve murdered.\n\nEva Saulitis is the author of the poetry collection Leaving Resurrection (Boreal Books/Red Hen Press, 2008). Her poems have appeared in Crazyhorse, Sow’s Ear Poetry Review, Cimarron Review, Seattle Review, and Carnet de Route. This is her third appearance in Alaska Quarterly Review.\n\nODYSSEUS by Thom Satterlee\n\nYou know who you are? The original absentee father.\n\nI was nearly thirty before I found you out.\n\nA latecomer to literature, I read the books\n\nI should have read when I was twelve.\n\nYou would have done me good then.\n\nYou would have been a model\n\nby which to measure my own father,\n\nwho left me on Monday and returned to me on Friday,\n\nsometimes of the same week, sometimes the next.\n\nLike your son, Telemachus, I waited;\n\nI doubled my practice at sport.\n\nCome Saturday he arrived\n\nand took his place on the sidelines, watching.\n\nHe promised me a dollar for every goal I scored,\n\nand I scored – Lord, I scored! Four goals in one game,\n\nseven in another, until he joked I’d bankrupt him\n\nand we laughed together, which is all I ever wanted –\n\nthat and to ask him, “Why were you gone so long?”\n\nNow I know what his answer would have been, your own:\n\n“It wasn’t that long. And now I’m back home, safe.”\n\nThom Satterlee is the author of the poetry collection Burning Wyclif (Texas Tech University Press). His poems have appeared in Crazyhorse, Notre Dame Review, Southern Review, Southwest Review, and featured on Poetry Daily. This is his second appearance in Alaska Quarterly Review.\n\nFRIEDA LAWRENCE: BLOOD, LUST, DESPERATION by Sue Walker\n\nAlthough she wouldn’t cook or clean,\n\nseldom changed bed sheets,\n\nhad four affairs the first four months\n\nof marriage, she loved him\n\nlike a cat asleep on a chair\n\na beast she would stroke,\n\nrunning her fingers through mottled fur,\n\nmeow meow lost in her throat. Yes,\n\nshe believed in the purity of his work,\n\nsapphires cooled out of molten chaos.\n\nGod, she hated poverty. A man should be rich.\n\nDavid was thin as a slice of gammon,\n\nnot tall enough, and his mother, damn her,\n\ncrusted in hate and dissatisfaction.\n\nIn the great struggle of intangible chaos,\n\nshe would crawl nights into bed with her son\n\nand his wife, scrunch up between them, a poor\n\ndesperate ghost who refused to vanish.\n\nShe smelled of lavender and loam, wrote\n\n”Corporal existence is a kind of death,”\n\non a pad and left it on the kitchen table.\n\n“You’ll never love him as I did,” his mamma said.\n\n“He is my boy, my blood.” The rasp in her voice\n\nchilled ardor. There is such a thing as too much love,\n\nand when the seizure of morning came,\n\nwhen the little eggy amoeba emerged out of foam,\n\nFrieda washed in a brook of broken dream\n\nand gave herself to a nameless carpenter\n\nfor a handful of nails, wormwood, and random screws.\n\nSome nights she would imagine how sex might be:\n\nA moment, pure in the yellow evening light, he was\n\nthe rise and rush of river, and she could\n\nbelieve something more would come\n\nof gambling and bet on rocking horses\n\nwithout riders, without the constriction of reins as\n\na breath of vapour began to rise up.\n\nFrieda Lawrence, Blood, Lust, and Desperation\n\nThen, when her husband claimed she’d never loved her children\n\nor she would not have left them to elope with him, he taunted her\n\nsaying: “Your son does not love you,”\n\n“A slivered shard of betrayal cuts and is\n\nforever felt in the soul,”\n\nuntil there is nothing to look forward to,\n\njust a limp, dry, bloodless marginal existence,\n\njust the smell of spoiled uneaten fruit,\n\njust the failures of a woman and a man ripped\n\ndarkly from the fecund cosmos, from the angry red sun.\n\nNote: The lines in italics are from D.H. Lawrence’s The Body of God.\n\nSue Walker has published seven books of poetry as well as fiction and critical articles on Flannery O’Connor, Carson McCullers, James Dickey, and Marge Piercy. She is the Poet Laureate of Alabama.\n\nTHE REMORSE OF NARCISSUS by Bruce Bond\n\nIt feels older, blinder, this April fog,\n\nolder than the ground it rises out of\n\neverywhere, it seems, or no one place,\n\nas if all of morning covered up its ears\n\nto listen. Self, I say, you may not know me.\n\nI am the keeper of the name you bear\n\ninto the plain speech of difficult hours.\n\nI am the kindling of hands beneath you\n\nas you sleep, the death-bed words too small\n\nto whisper. I am smoke. I see that now.\n\nI see time as a coin I never give, take,\n\nreturn at last, flashing in a pool of coins.\n\nTo ask more is to ask forgiveness. I ask\n\nforgiveness. I am the child lost in traffic,\n\nthe leaden brood of the anvil cloud\n\ndragging a shadow of sirens into day.\n\nI am the bridge that burns its way to see.\n\nTell me, self, where is your mentor now,\n\nwhere the gentle smolder of his beard.\n\nWhere the spontaneity of wings\n\nthat weave a veil about the steeple.\n\nI would walk into death and back for you.\n\nI would eat my bitterness like a starved dream.\n\nI would call out to the father buried\n\ninside you, tell him I am trying, always,\n\nthe roof of my house in shambles, a storm\n\nof needles crackling at my window. Self,\n\nI say, come into the sphere by the fire,\n\ntake off your gloves. There’s more of the world\n\nthan sky to hold it, more ebb and flow\n\nthan a shore can bear. And the self turns\n\naround to say what any echoing canyon\n\nsays, any vast, hard, and empty place.\n\nBruce Bond’s six full-length collections of poetry include Blind Rain (forthcoming from LSU Press), Independence Days, The Anteroom of Paradise, Radiography, The Throats of Narcissus, and Cinder. This is his second appearance in Alaska Quarterly Review.\n\nA PERSONAL APOCALYPSE by Jennifer Gresham\n\nIf it happens now, Visa will get paid\n\nbut the lights will go out. A trip\n\nto the grocery store means extra eggs\n\nfor the neighbor who discovers\n\nher still warm body. Thirty minutes more\n\nand her husband, home from a long day\n\nsmoothing asphalt onto cracked streets,\n\ncan have dinner before calling 911.\n\nBy tomorrow, clean clothes for the funeral.\n\nFor every action, there’s an equal\n\nand opposite reaction, which is not to say\n\nshe’ll see it coming. She doesn’t know\n\nwhat makes her count life’s progress\n\non death’s bony fingers, except the comfort\n\nof preparing for his perpetual arrival.\n\nWhile the fervent spend time praying\n\nfor world peace, the atheist makes hers\n\none bed at a time. There is only the chopping\n\nof onions until she cries, sweeping clean\n\nthe walk of leaves. She knows there won’t be time\n\nfor haunting a horrible dictator in the afterlife,\n\nno ordering a flood for those sickened\n\nwith sloth, but at least her hands will be clean.\n\nShe knows that the only divinity lies\n\nin diligence and a well mopped, shiny\n\nkitchen floor. Even now, she’s counting down\n\nas she scrapes the plates, knots the garbage, hangs\n\nlilac-scented laundry in the back yard.\n\nShe’s listening hard for that loud, final click\n\nof the clock, the one she’s imagined since\n\nshe was young, followed by the deep voice\n\nthat comes from faraway and always from behind.\n\nThe one that says your time is up, please\n\nput your pencils down.\n\nJennifer Gresham is the author of Explaining Relativity to the Cat (Pudding House Press, 2004) and Diary of a Cell (Steel Toe Books, 2005). Her poems have appeared in Prairie Schooner, Gargoyle, The Atlanta Review, Crab Orchard Review, Rock & Sling, and Rattle.\n\nFIMBULWINTER by Maggie Smith\n\nWhat the ice gets, the ice keeps.\n\n– Ernest Shackleford\n\nAt first the frost is like a second skin,\n\nall silvery. It makes you look like magic,\n\nyour skyline like a row of wedding cakes –\n\ndomes, arches, spires frosted white.\n\nOh my city, my icebox full of sweets.\n\nEverywhere, ice sculptures are hailing\n\ntaxi cabs, walking their dogs. Thick\n\nribbons of birds are fleeing. Oh my city,\n\nthe little bergs on your river interlock\n\nlike puzzle pieces. I could walk on water\n\nfrom here to the edge of the earth if there\n\nwere anything left. But I won’t leave you.\n\nI won’t stand on a rooftop, waving my arms,\n\nstriking the last spent match over and over.\n\nNo one’s coming. No one’s getting out.\n\nEven the birds freeze into paperweights,\n\nfall, and shatter. Oh my city, you’re still\n\nand dark at the end. But when the moon\n\ndangles overhead like a mirror ball,\n\nevery inch of you sparkles and writhes.\n\nTWENTIETH CENTURY by Maggie Smith\n\nI must have missed the last train out of this gray city.\n\nI’m scrolling the radio through shhhhh. The streetlamps\n\nfill with light, right on time, but no one is pouring it in.\n\nTwentieth Century, you’re gone. You’re tucked into\n\na sleeping car, rolling to god-knows-where, and I’m\n\nlonely for you. I know it’s naïve. But your horrors\n\nwere far away, and I thought I could stand them.\n\nTwentieth Century, we had a good life more or less,\n\ndidn’t we? You made me. You wove the long braid\n\ndown my back. You kissed me in the snowy street\n\nwith everyone watching. You opened your mouth a little\n\nand it scared me. Twentieth Century, it’s me, it’s me.\n\nYou said that to me once, as if I’d forgotten your face.\n\nYou strung me out until trees seemed to breathe,\n\nexpanding and contracting. You played “American Girl”\n\nand turned it up loud. You said I was untouchable.\n\nDo you remember the nights at Alum Creek, the lit\n\nwindows painting yellow Rothkos on the water?\n\nAre they still there, or did you take them with you?\n\nSay something. I’m here, waiting, scrolling the radio.\n\nOn every frequency, someone hushes me. Is it you?\n\nTwentieth Century, are you there? I thought you were\n\na simpler time. I thought we’d live on a mountain\n\ntogether, drinking melted snow, carving hawk totems\n\nfrom downed pines. We’d never come back. Twentieth\n\nCentury, I was in so deep, I couldn’t see an end to you.\n\nMaggie Smith is the author of the poetry collection Lamp of the Body (Red Hen Press, 2005). Her poems have appeared in The Paris Review, The Iowa Review, Prairie Schooner, Gettysburg Review, and Massachusetts Review. This is her second appearance in Alaska Quarterly Review.\n\nSKIPPING STONES by Heather Kirn\n\nThink of the way you cast that apple core\n\nbetween the trees. Your dad derided, girl throw!\n\nand you thought he meant, not hard enough.\n\nYou thought he meant, annihilate the seeds,\n\nwhite meat, and stem with Popeye arms. Be male,\n\ndestroy, smash it at the trunk. But now,\n\nYou have to pivot from the waist, like this,\n\nyour husband shows you when you sink the stone\n\nyou want to skip. His hips torque like a dancer,\n\nor a woman baiting come-hither with her hour-\n\nglass shape. Just choose another bit, the flattest\n\nlimestone shard. No matter. Down it plunks.\n\nYou’ve got it wrong, still willing the rock\n\nto skip by force, the way your father hacked\n\nthe hedges, opened jars, plowed snow, built walls\n\nbetween his son and him. Not mine, he said,\n\nnot anymore, not since your brother hit\n\nhis own bride. Once in the jaw, twice in the eye.\n\nTry again, your husband says. Whip your body\n\nlike a trebuchet. Turn it, snap the hip\n\nand let your elbow follow, see, and there\n\nhis stone skims clear across the water like\n\na finger feeling glass, like your mother’s hand\n\nwould wipe the kitchen table. Therapy,\n\nshe called it, rope-spine taut and curled above\n\na stain. Like prayer, like pleading, she gave over\n\nevery cell to cleaning floors. You have to use\n\nyour whole body. He rests his fingers at\n\nyour sides, pulls the left back, thrusts the right,\n\nsays pop, repeats the motion. Feel that?\n\nYou hear the Pop your brother cried before\n\nyour father’s casket closed, the sobs your mother\n\nwears in every bone, your brother’s lone\n\napology, the time you told your husband,\n\nfuck yourself. How masculine it felt,\n\nso you threw a hammer too. And now\n\nyou feel your husband’s ring against your side,\n\nthe swerve his body makes from behind, the way\n\nhe moves you from the core, the grace that follows\n\nforce, the reward. You feel the distance\n\nto the other shore, his breath on the back\n\nof your neck, the smooth stone, and you let go.\n\nHeather Kirn’s poems have appeared in The Southern Review, Crab Orchard Review, Fourteen Hills, and Unsplendid.\n\nTO THE MISTRESS OF THE MASTER\n\nOF THE FEMALE HALF‑LENGTHS by Michael Salcman\n\n– (c. 1520–1540)\n\nAt the day sale, you were not quite fit for the bins\n\nso you settled into an auction of the Circle of,\n\nin the Manner of, from the School of and other has-beens\n\nin the house of Art, where your delicate porcelain face\n\narched brows and hair parted in the middle,\n\nmight better startle the casual reader of the catalog\n\nlooking upon your slender manicured fingers and,\n\nbalanced above, an oval head and bare shoulders\n\nturned three-quarters at your writing desk.\n\nOne hand lifts a book page, the other rests near a metal pot\n\nof salve, the emblem of the Magdalene,\n\nand through the window a balustrade and beyond that\n\na blue and green smoky landscape lifted from Leonardo.\n\nWhat does it mean if your painter is known today only\n\nas a Follower of the Master of the Female Half-Lengths,\n\nan unknown epigone or sly copyist of some other artist\n\nbarely better limned than you, a man without a proper name\n\nor history, rescued from the Flemish dark at the start\n\nof a more modern era?\n\nIn this sale of authentic unknowns, among the sad pieties\n\nof forgotten old masters who never were more inspired\n\nthan a carpenter plumbing a joist for a door,\n\nhis picture of you carries the meanest price;\n\nit seems at least two men painted you over and over\n\nas if sawing in half the same woman in their minds,\n\nand their bootless fame, free of any personal gain\n\nhas lit your face with the grace of anonymity.\n\nMichael Salcman is the author of the poetry collection The Clock Made of Confetti (Orchises Press, 2007) and the chapbook, Stones In Our Pockets (Parallel Press, 2007). His poems have appeared in New Letters, Ontario Review, Harvard Review, River Styx, New York Quarterly and featured on NPR’s All Things Considered and in Euphoria (2005), a documentary on the brain and creativity.\n\nTHE DEAD GUY CLEARS THE AIR ABOUT ROADKILL by William Notter\n\nThe Denver talk show station had a lady call\n\nand rave about rendering plants collecting pets –\n\ngrinding up cats with hair, flea collars,\n\nlittle bells and all, making dog food\n\nfrom people’s passed‑on dogs.\n\nShe said the drivers will even stop\n\nto pick up roadkill deer, coyotes, prairie dogs,\n\nand imagine the diseases that could pass\n\nfrom kibble to pets to owners.\n\nNow I can’t say how they do it\n\nin the city, but I’m paid to pick up cattle –\n\nbeef mostly, sometimes dairy –\n\nand every now and then a horse.\n\nA full-grown hog is fine if it’s on my route,\n\nbut big operations usually bury theirs.\n\nI’ve hauled away a donkey, and exotics\n\nlike one man’s ostrich, but left his neighbor’s dog\n\nright where he’d shot it going under the fence.\n\nSkunks, raccoons, possums, badgers, and deer\n\nare a job for the county road crew,\n\ntrusties from the jail, or coyotes and crows.\n\nI will not pick up a dog or cat for anyone\n\nwho needs to bury it or sneak it into the dump himself.\n\nIf you see me stopped along the road,\n\nI’ll be checking tires or taking a leak,\n\nnot peeling bullsnakes off the blacktop\n\nor hunting for smashed‑up turtles\n\nto try and add more weight to my load.\n\nWilliam Notter is the author of the chapbook More Space Than Anyone Can Stand (Texas Review Press, 2002). His poems have appeared in Ascent, Chattahoochee Review, Crab Orchard Review, Southern Poetry Review, and featured in Garrison Keillor’s anthology Good Poems for Hard Times and NPR’s The Writer’s Almanac.\n\nBENEATH A SOMBER MOON by Dan Stryk\n\nNot certain if you’ve ceased to dream,\n\nyou wriggle in the dark: the cat has brought\n\nback something & left it in a moonlit pool\n\ninside the slight-cracked door, something\n\nthat you deeply sense he doesn’t, & would\n\nnever, hunt. What’s more, he’s too old\n\nnow, & limps – you try to laugh – to catch\n\nmuch anyway, beyond the swill he gobbles\n\nfrom his cans. Still, you want to dress,\n\nslip out, escape . . . But instead sit upright\n\nin the bed, fixed there it seems – alone in\n\nsome vague trance. The cat only a dumpy\n\ngrey-furred surrogate of thought. Because\n\nlittle bones that might be human, or might not,\n\nlie ratlike under moonbeams near\n\nthe wardrobe,\n\nwhere he’s left them,\n\nin a heap.\n\nDan Stryk is the author of the poetry collections The Artist and the Crow (Purdue University Press, 1984), Solace of the Aging Mare (The Mid-America Press, 2008), and Dimming Radiance (Wind Publications, 2008).

The door to the basement propped open,\n\nand we taste the cinderblock cool from below, hear the scrape and sweep, a man pushing water with a broom, the perfect vision of futility, this moment all hunch-shouldered and shirtless in the heat, muttering who knows what to whom, me calling down the stairs before he finds us hovering over him like this.\n\nAnd did I mention it was hot?\n\nThat it was August?\n\nThat I never really knew\n\nmy father? That he died when\n\nI was ten? Met him twice? That\n\nmy uncle, a version of my father, is dead\n\nnow, too, gone a few weeks after this visit,\n\none of how many times I went to see him?\n\nThree? Four? Five at the most?\n\nOut in the bright of day, even after I remind him again who I am and how he should know me, he squints and doesn’t seem to recognize whose hand he’s shaking right now. Bob’s boy, he says, Billy Joe – so, what d’you need? And it has, I realize, taken me forty years to say nothing – I don’t need anything,\n\nI say – just wanted to introduce him to my son. We stand there in the garage a moment and wait, as if this man is about to become my father, my father almost becoming me now, and the boy? In every version of this I set him down, the kid off quick suddenly, the two of us toddling after him, smiling – sometimes more wistfully than we wish, sometimes less.\n\nWilliam Lychack is the author of the novel The Wasp Eater (Mariner Books, 2005), and a forthcoming short story collection The Architect of Flowers (Houghton Mifflin).\n\nTHE WAY A DOG MEETS THE DAY by Diane Seuss\n\nEven a bad dog, one with tricks up his sleeve.\n\nOne who draws blood the old fashioned way.\n\nHow the dog steps into the world\n\nlike a bridesmaid into a green dress\n\nshe wouldn’t have chosen herself,\n\na dress she nonetheless paid for.\n\nTo honor the bride.\n\nA friend? No,\n\nthe girl on the cake,\n\nthe girl who brings blossoms,\n\nthe blue-tinged, heavenly ones.\n\nAnd frosting. The kind piped\n\ninto doves and rosettes.\n\nThe dog like a bridesmaid who will never be a bride.\n\nTo be a bride is not her way.\n\nWalks into the world as into an ill-fitting dress,\n\nbut zips herself into it anyway.\n\nThe dog walks with intention, but carefully,\n\nlike a bridesmaid in unaccustomed\n\nshoes. Shoes dyed an earth-tone\n\nto match a color scheme she does not comprehend.\n\nThe dog raises\n\nhis head and takes in the morning\n\nair but not ravenously,\n\nlike a bridesmaid at the buffet table.\n\nA little rice. A bit\n\nof chicken with mushroom sauce.\n\nFive unsnapped green beans, steamed\n\nto retain their bright color. A dinner\n\nroll. One, though she likes bread,\n\nthough she’d like to eat five rolls\n\nwith real butter, she’d like to never\n\nstop with the rolls.\n\nThen the dog walks the periphery of land that is not his.\n\nHe notices, but does not act. Mourning doves\n\nwithin easy reach, ground-feeders.\n\nSquirrel in the redbud, plotting out its day.\n\nSpider, waiting at the hub of its damp web.\n\nPink fists of the wild roses.\n\nLike a bridesmaid dwarfed by a cathedral\n\nof someone else’s design, in whose canon\n\nshe does not participate, yet still she walks\n\nforward, always forward, past the stages\n\nof the cross in stained glass, following the hem\n\nof the bridal train, the train sewed with seed pearls\n\nand crystals, following a bride whose face she cannot\n\nremember, toward a groom whose smile is lopsided,\n\nwhose character is suspicious,\n\nwho may or may not like dogs.\n\nDiane Seuss is the author of the poetry collection It Blows You Hollow (New Issues Press, 1998). Her poems have appeared in The North American Review, Indiana Review, The Georgia Review and in the anthologies Boomer Girls (University of Iowa Press, 1999), Are You Experienced (University of Iowa Press, 2003), and Sweeping Beauty (University of Iowa Press, 2005). This is her second appearance in Alaska Quarterly Review.\n\nTHE SLEEPWALKER MAKES PLANS by Sigman Byrd\n\nDon’t wake him, the old wisdom says.\n\nBut let him traipse the dreaming\n\nplanks of this world\n\nas if he were walking on board\n\na ghost ship about to set sail for that remote\n\nand tropical island paradise called the future.\n\nIt’s the story of his life and won’t let go.\n\nHe scribbles his name to it and gnaws\n\nat the bitter root because his departure is delayed again.\n\nHe complains with words he finds on his lips,\n\nsea-wracked, foam-heavy words\n\nas if he were actually speaking.\n\nEven now, he believes,\n\npeople like him dressed in festively colored,\n\nmicro-fiber sunwear somewhere are\n\nsipping drinks with exotic names\n\nand listening to the pleasing cadences of pulsing\n\nsteel drums. Even now the earth is turning\n\nand tomorrow, somewhere, knit from\n\npremium combed air for exceptional softness\n\nand durability, is rising.\n\nWake up, sleepwalker. But it’s too late.\n\nThe mind, like a ship’s engine grumbling to life,\n\nshreds the moment, as if it, too, had somewhere\n\nnecessary to get to.\n\nHe stands on the deck and waves,\n\namong others like him,\n\npassengers who think they are leaving,\n\nlike him with their voice-activated mouths,\n\ntheir eyes burdened and blinking with images.\n\nAPOTHEOSIS OF THE SLEEPWALKER by Sigman Byrd\n\nSo the years began to pass like a giant sequoia\n\non the slow road to becoming a hand-carved footstool.\n\nEverywhere I turned there I was: the street of sleepwalkers\n\non their secret pilgrimage, that dark, anonymous\n\nstreet of original sorrow. As if God were everywhere,\n\nsaid an old man I saw there once who had stumps for legs\n\nand little lichen-flesh handkerchiefs for arms.\n\nHe was dancing across a greasy cardboard stage,\n\nhobbled and weaving in the grip of some private tarantella.\n\nAs if God were everywhere, he kept saying,\n\nand I, who knew nothing about the intimate\n\nchoreography of flesh, suddenly without warning,\n\nas if for the first time, felt my arms\n\nbegin to sway and my feet begin to tap.\n\nSigman Byrd is the author of the poetry collection Under the Wanderer’s Star (Marsh Hawk Press, 2006). His poetry has appeared in American Poetry Review, Poetry, Ploughshares, Georgia Review, and Prairie Schooner. This is his second appearance in Alaska Quarterly Review.\n\nTHE DEFT TOUCH OF ANGELS by John Rybicki\n\nCan you see my love outside,\n\na pink and white swan there\n\non the moonless side of our cottage?\n\nThere’s a rose-like flame\n\nrising from the earth where she stands.\n\nWhen I reach for her the tips\n\nof my fingers go drowning in it,\n\npress through the flames to touch\n\nthe little blood house she lives in.\n\nShe’s weeping inside a barn\n\nthat’s held underwater, the roses spawning up\n\nso they brushstroke and burn.\n\nIf I had the proper arms, say,\n\nthe deft touch of angels, I’d tend her from above,\n\nmake one flag from the rag flames\n\nmoving through her, run that flag\n\nup every pole, flutter it over the nations.\n\nThe red bird in my chest\n\nkeeps repeating, you’re just a man,\n\njust a man who wants to push\n\nthe tombstones away and live,\n\nto eat my oats and run long miles\n\nuntil the beasts lie down in my blood\n\nto chew a blade of grass and rest.\n\nI will row with my breath and greet her\n\nin that country, rub another sunset over her skin,\n\nsit across from her on our porch,\n\ntwo elementals with our morning coffee,\n\na slender stick of lightning\n\nin each of our hands.\n\nJohn Rybicki is the author of the poetry collection We Bed Down into Water (TriQuarterly Books, 2008). His poems have appeared in The Quarterly, Poetry East, Yankee, New York Quarterly, and The Best American Poetry. This is his second appearance in Alaska Quarterly Review.\n\nPOLAR EXPLORER # 8\n\nRobert Falcon Scott – 1912 by Elizabeth Bradfield\n\n”He cried more easily than any man I have ever known.”\n\n– Apsely Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World\n\nEach icefall and massif he’d search for a touch\n\nof his sculptress wife’s hand. By all reports,\n\nhe was a mess. Ambitious and sensitive,\n\nsputtering at each gripe\n\nof his disenchanted crew, and\n\nromantic past all sense. Take,\n\nfor example: man-hauling –\n\nWhile Amundsen slid to the pole\n\non Nordic skis, the English under Scott\n\ntrudged – better to know each jar, each pound\n\nof need pulled along, better to have felt\n\nthe hard accomplishment of each mile. Ah, Kathleen,\n\nhe thought to his own slogged pace,\n\nyou’d be proud. But she was off\n\nflirting with his rival, Nansen, wreaking havoc\n\nwith the image of the stoic wife, hungry\n\nfor her own adventures.\n\nAnd when at last he reached the pole he found\n\nanother flag, fresh and untattered, waving\n\nthe news of his defeat. Then\n\nhis doomed march home . . . O\n\nthink of Shelley lost to suspect drowning, Byron\n\nslain by passion’s fever, and then Scott, starving\n\nin his tent eleven miles from cached supplies\n\nhe couldn’t find.\n\nAnd now, as I’m telling this, ninety years later,\n\nhis body, still wrapped in its reindeer bag, still swaddled\n\nin his tent’s frayed silk, flag still tattering, his body\n\nmay have reached the Ross Sea\n\nthrough the slow torrent\n\nof the ice shelf. All the days he plodded,\n\nthe land was sliding back beneath him, treadmill\n\nto the sea where he at last is given\n\na sailor’s burial,\n\nmaybe today, sunk and drifting.\n\nCROCKER LAND by Elizabeth Bradfield\n\nThere are atmospheric tricks of cold\n\nto explain it: how Peary saw the peaks\n\nand shores, how MacMillan, seven years\n\nlater, did too. Pujok, said Peeawahto. Mist\n\nthat in frozen air seemed\n\nlike a broad shore, like hills.\n\nFor symmetry, there should be land. The North\n\nshould be a beautiful stipple from Maine\n\nto Siberia, point after point to name.\n\nOnly when they stood on the map’s brown spot,\n\nthirty miles in on its vague outline, they felt\n\nthe sea beneath them, new ice flexing like leather,\n\nand saw\n\nfurther off, another summit. Pujok. Another\n\nfog. Months ago, when rations weren’t considered\n\nand when known shores made the horizon,\n\nsomeone baked a cake and iced it thickly white.\n\nThey gathered around a table in the main saloon,\n\nraised forks, Crocker Land in their mouths, a confection\n\nso sweet their teeth ached and dreams warped strange.\n\nElizabeth Bradfield is the author of the poetry collection Interpretive Work (Arktoi Books/Red Hen Press, 2008). Her poems have appeared in The Atlantic Monthly, Poetry, and Field. This is her fourth appearance in Alaska Quarterly Review."
