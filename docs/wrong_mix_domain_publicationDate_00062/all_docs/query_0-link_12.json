        "text": "\"Who has the power to bless?\" asks O'Donohue, and answers:\n\nThis question is not be be answered simply by the description of one's institutional status or membership. But perhaps there are deeper questions hidden here. What do you bless with? Or where do you bless from? When you bless another, you first gather yourself; you reach below your surface mind and personality, down to the deeper source within you - namely, the soul. Blessing is from soul to soul. And the key to who you are is your soul.\n\nThe short answer to who can bless is: anyone, everyone. O'Donohue also says, \"Wherever one person takes another into the care of their heart, they have the power to bless. There are things we never do, simply because it never occurs to us that we can do them. To bless someone is to offer a beautiful gift.\"\n\nI don't know if you've read Gilead by Marilynne Robinson but there is a scene at the very end when the Reverend Ames blesses Jack Boughton and I think it's about the most powerful thing I've ever read. I won't quote from the book, but I like to mention it every chance I get, and this seemed a good one for it.\n\nThe following poem is from Marge Piercy's book of the same title, The Art of Blessing the Day.\n\nThe Art of Blessing the Day\n\nby Marge Piercy\n\nThis is the blessing for rain after drought:\n\nCome down, wash the air so it shimmers,\n\na perfumed shawl of lavender chiffon.\n\nLet the parched leaves suckle and swell.\n\nEnter my skin, wash me for the little\n\nchrysalis of sleep rocked in your plashing.\n\nIn the morning the world is peeled to shining.\n\nThis is the blessing for sun after long rain:\n\nNow everything shakes itself free and rises.\n\nThe trees are bright as pushcart ices.\n\nEvery last lily opens its satin thighs.\n\nThe bees dance and roll in pollen\n\nand the cardinal at the top of the pine\n\nsings at full throttle, fountaining.\n\nThis is the blessing for a ripe peach:\n\nThis is luck made round. Frost can nip\n\nthe blossom, kill the bee. It can drop,\n\na hard green useless nut. Brown fungus,\n\nthe burrowing worm that coils in rot can\n\nblemish it and wind crush it on the ground.\n\nYet this peach fills my mouth with juicy sun.\n\nThis is the blessing for the first garden tomato:\n\nThose green boxes of tasteless acid the store\n\nsells in January, those red things with the savor\n\nof wet chalk, they mock your fragrant name.\n\nHow fat and sweet you are weighing down my palm,\n\nwarm as the flank of a cow in the sun.\n\nYou are the savor of summer in a thin red skin.\n\nThis is the blessing for a political victory:\n\nAlthough I shall not forget that things\n\nwork in increments and epicycles and sometime\n\nleaps that half the time fall back down,\n\nlet's not relinquish dancing while the music\n\nfits into our hips and bounces our heels.\n\nWe must never forget, pleasure is real as pain.\n\nThe blessing for the return of a favorite cat,\n\nthe blessing for love returned, for friends'\n\nreturn, for money received unexpected,\n\nthe blessing for the rising of the bread,\n\nthe sun, the oppressed. I am not sentimental\n\nabout old men mumbling the Hebrew by rote\n\nwith no more feeling than one says gesundheit.\n\nBut the discipline of blessings is to taste\n\neach moment, the bitter, the sour, the sweet\n\nand the salty, and be glad for what does not\n\nhurt. The art is in compressing attention\n\nto each little and big blossom of the tree\n\nof life, to let the tongue sing each fruit,\n\nits savor, its aroma and its use.\n\nAttention is love, what we must give\n\nchildren, mothers, fathers, pets,\n\nour friends, the news, the woes of others.\n\nWhat we want to change we curse and then\n\npick up a tool. Bless whatever you can\n\nwith eyes and hands and tongue. If you\n\ncan't bless it, get ready to make it new.\n\nBless whatever you can today, the small, the insignificant. It's both an art and a discipline. So let us compress our attention, savor, let us love.\n\nThis next blessing is from a book called, Knitting into the Mystery, which is about contemplative knitting and which I like because it begins with sunlight, but doesn't overlook the rain.\n\nA Blessing\n\nMay the blessing of light be on you,\n\nlight without and light within\n\nand light inside the darkness within.\n\nMay the blessed sunlight shine upon you\n\nand warm your heart till it glows,\n\nlike a great peat fire, so that strangers may come\n\nand warm themselves; and that friends may come.\n\nAnd may the light shine out of the eyes of you,\n\nlike a candle set in the windows of a house,\n\nbidding the wanderer to come in out of the storm.\n\nAnd may the blessing of the rain be on youâ€”\n\nthe soft, sweet rain.\n\nMay it fall upon your spirit so that the seedlings of light\n\nin your shadow may spring up,\n\nand shed their sweetness on the air.\n\nAnd may the blessing of the great rains be on you,\n\nthat they beat upon your spirit and wash it fair and clean,\n\nand leave there many a shining pool,\n\nand sometimes a star.\n\nAnd may the blessing for the earth be on youâ€”\n\nthe great round earth\n\nwho carries all; the great round earth\n\nwhose suffering has already become radiant.\n\nMay you ever have a kindly greeting for people\n\nyou pass as you are going along the roads.\n\nAnd now may the Lord bless you, and bless you kindly,\n\nyour kin and all creatures.\n\nThis last one is from The Art of Being Alone by Tanikawa Shuntaro and is perhaps a form of self-blessing. Simple words we can invoke each morning, these words that come out of a dream and keep you from harm: good morning!\n\nOne morning last week I was out for a walk a little earlier than usual because I had a 10am library shift. As I turned the corner onto the path by the utility corridor I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the pink sky. It reflected onto the trees, so that some of them also appeared pink. I myself was bathed in the pink light. It felt like a blessing, a gorgeous glowing benediction. A holiness, a colour out of a painting by Piero della Francesca. The morning, I often think, is a blessing unto us all.\n\nA Morning Takes Shape\n\nby Tanikawa Shuntaro\n\nWhat has tormented my mind since last evening\n\nappeared in a dream like an endless barren land\n\nSomewhere in the dream my alarm clock rang\n\nMy dog was wagging his tail beyond the glass doors\n\nThe sunlight shot sideways at a glass on the table\n\nThere it was, it was morning\n\nThe morning was bright that day, too\n\nIts light bared me to all the corners of my soul\n\nfrighteningly clearly\n\nI could no longer fool myself\n\nI said, \"Good morning!\"\n\nI felt the words keep me from harm\n\nThe morning was there\n\nCold water rushed out of the faucet\n\nThe smell of miso soup filled the room\n\nPeople were intent on walking in all the walks of the country\n\nI saw the morning take shape\n\nsurer than happiness, brighter than hope"
