        "text": "Author Erik Calonius became familiar with downtown Savannah while researching his new book \"The Wanderer: The Last American Slave Ship and the Conspiracy That Set Its Sails.\"\n\nHe researched journals and publications at the Georgia Historical Society, looked inside the U.S. Customs House on Bay Street (to see just how the light would have fallen on the courtroom) and retraced the footsteps of major characters.\n\nThursday evening, he'll be back - this time to speak about the ship, the slaves it carried and the high-profile drama that played out here in 1858-59.\n\nCalonius, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, said he became interested in the Wanderer about five years ago during a visit to a museum on Jekyll Island. A painting of the ship piqued his interest and launched a personal voyage to find out as much as he could about the notorious vessel and the men who controlled it.\n\nThe Wanderer case\n\nThe Wanderer was carefully constructed in 1856 as a luxurious racing yacht.\n\nIt was appointed with crystal china and carried the finest brandy and cigars. It seemed hand-chosen for a career of racing and raffishness, until a series of decisions sent it horribly off course.\n\nA surreptitious refit greatly enlarged its cargo capacity, and a swift voyage to the Congo filled that space with 480 slaves.\n\nThe Wanderer then returned to the United States and landed the 400 surviving slaves at Jekyll Island on Nov. 28, 1858.\n\nIt was a bold and deliberate defiance of federal laws outlawing the importation of slaves, and at the center of the decision was a contentious Savannah businessman, Charles Augustus Lafayette Lamar.\n\nTime has largely erased the ensuing federal case that was heard at the U.S. Customs House and presided over by Savannah native and Supreme Court Justice James Moore Wayne.\n\nBut Calonius said that the Wanderer case - seen through the proper context - was one of the most important events of that era.\n\nThe New York Times archive for 1858-'59 shows some 140 stories about the Wanderer, Calonius said, a statistic that reveals the size of the stage provided for Lamar and his \"fire-eater\" friends as they actively sought the North-South split that would occur in 1861.\n\nAs the Wanderer case played out in Savannah, another slavery-driven situation splashed onto the nation's front pages - John Brown's seizure of the armory at Harpers Ferry, Va.\n\nThe two controversial cases should be considered together, the author said.\n\n\"John Brown's presence hung over the (Savannah) courtroom,\" wrote Calonius in his book, \"and nothing would escape it in the days ahead.\""
