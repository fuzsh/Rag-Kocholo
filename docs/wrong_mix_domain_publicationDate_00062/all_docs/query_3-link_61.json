        "text": "The Wanderer was born out of words and urgency. They seem to be human, they try to find out what that means, but in order to do that, they have to become animal, river, object, equals and opposites, the same in their differences. In the beginning there were ideas. They were dwelling places.\n\nThe Wanderer spent time in all of them, slowly growing, changing, becoming. Moving from one to the other, mirroring them, absorbing them. They became a map. A map for the future.\n\nMonique Besten is an artist and writer researching notions of home by moving through the world, life and media in search of narratives of all scales. The Wanderer is the winner of dpr-barcelona writing grant 2020 for Future Architecture."
