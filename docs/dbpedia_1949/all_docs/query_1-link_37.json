        "text": "Ubisoft has finally put a release window on the Prince of Persia Sands of Time Remake: 2026.\n\nThe Sands of time remake’s release year, announced during the Ubisoft Forward 2024 event alongside a brief teaser video, comes after what was reportedly a troubled development. In November last year, Ubisoft said the Ubisoft Montreal project had passed an “important” internal milestone and that development was “progressing.”\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nPrince of Persia's first delay arrived in December 2020, just months after its initial announcement, with an indefinite delay following in February 2021. Ubisoft made its most drastic shift yet when development was moved from Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal in May 2022. Work has continued at the Assassin’s Creed Valhalla studio since, with the publisher confirming it had moved into the “conception” phase of development in May 2023.\n\nThe Sands of Time first launched on PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and PC back in November 2003 to criticial and commerial acclaim. This hotly anticipated remake has been in the works for at least four years. In a blog post, Ubisoft said the remake is now entering its \"full production phase\", with Ubisoft Montreal receiving support from co-dev studios in Toronto, Bucharest, Paris, and Pune.\n\nMeanwhile, Ubisoft announced updates for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, which gets a story DLC in September, and The Rogue Prince of Persia, which dropped its first major free title update today, June 10. For more on what Ubisoft has coming up, check out everything announced at Ubisoft Forward 2024.\n\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
