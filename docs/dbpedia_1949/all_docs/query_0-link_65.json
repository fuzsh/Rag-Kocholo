Some of the research based on this original idea shows up in chapters 2 and 3, but in pursuing this topic I became fascinated with Jewish converts to Catholicism, as they struggled with themselves, their families, and their communities in the borderlands between two religions. The stories of these converts opened up a broader question, about how and why people make religious choices, and the contexts that both allow and constrain these decisions. As often happens with historical research, I did not plan the journey I ended up taking, as I moved from Jewish-Christian relations, to conversions, and eventually to religious liberty as my subject. The freedom to choose a religious identity is for me a personal as well as a scholarly concern. Family bonds tie me to both Catholicism and Judaism, but I stand at the margins of both traditions, regarding them with a combination of affection, respect, and skepticism. Writing this book has allowed me to study a time and a place where the religious liberty available to me and others in the West emerged in ways that continue to resonate in the modern world. I hope that the story I tell here will add to our knowledge of French history, but also to our understanding of the complex ways in which religious liberty in the modern world challenges individuals, families, and communities to adopt tolerant and open-hearted approaches toward religious differences. Many people have helped me along the way. I owe a special debt of gratitude to the colleagues who have participated in the modern European reading group of the Nanovic Institute for European Studies at Notre Dame. Over the past several years members of the group have read and commented on all of the chapters, providing insight from a variety of disciplines and, perhaps ix\n\nx p r e fa c e\n\njust as important, setting deadlines for circulating texts that I might otherwise still be revising. Thanks to Julia Douthwaite, who founded and led us for many years, and to Tobias Boes, John Deak, Robert Fishman, Lauren Holland, Alex Martin, Ian Newman, Pierpaolo Polinzetti, Yasmin Solomenescu, and Lesley Walker. I have also benefited from the support of colleagues in the history department, who have listened to me talk about this project in departmental seminars, but also in friendly conversations in Decio Hall. I especially thank my department chairs, John McGreevy, Tom Noble, and Pat Griffin, who were generous, confident, and patient as they waited for me to finish a book that kept changing shape over the last several years. The seminars sponsored by the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism, led by Timothy Matovina and now by Kathleen Cummings, have been a stimulating forum for me and other scholars to discuss broad issues relating to the place of religion in the modern world. From outside Notre Dame a number of colleagues offered comments on chapters that took me into their own areas of expertise: Dominque Avon, Tatyana Bakhmetyeva, Sarah Cramsey, Rob Priest, Ron Schechter, and David Troyansky. I have profited from the opportunity to present material from this book to panels at the American Historical Association, the American Catholic Historical Association, and the Western Society for French History. In conversations at conferences and dinners I have learned much from Guillaume Cuchet, Sarah Curtis, Jean-Dominique Durand, Frédéric Gugelot, Ray Jonas, Jacqueline Lalouette, Claude Langlois, John Merriman, Florian Michel, Jean-Pierre Moisset, Jason Neidleman, and Tim Tackett. My former students Sean Phillips and Sheila Nowinski did some valuable digging for me on the history of toleration and religious liberty in Old Regime France. Thanks are due as well to the universities where I’ve given talks that allowed me to develop many of the stories and ideas that evolved into this book: the University of Bordeaux, the University of Chicago, Holy Cross University, the University of Louvain, Texas Tech University, and Yale University. In the final stages I was fortunate to have responses from two anonymous readers for Yale University Press who combined enthusiasm for the project with some trenchant suggestions for improving it. Some of the material in chapter 3 appeared in a different form in “The Bautain Circle and Catholic-Jewish Relations in Modern France,” Catholic Historical Review 92 (2006): 177–196, and “Turbulent Souls in Modern France: Jewish Conversion and the Terquem Affair,” Historical Reflections/Réflexions Historiques 32 (2006): 83–104.\n\np r e fa c e\n\nxi\n\nA number of institutions provided crucial financial support for this project. In the earliest stages of the research the Lucius Littauer Foundation provided a grant that got me started on Jewish-Christian relations. The Nanovic Institute at Notre Dame, led by Jim McAdams and Anthony Monta, never turned down a request on my part for funds to support work in France during the summer months. The Department of History provided sabbatical leaves and travel funds on several occasions. A grant from Notre Dame’s Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts covered the costs of the index. I am grateful to Phil Nord and Jan Goldstein, for supporting my application for a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities, and to the Endowment, which provided a grant that allowed me to spend a year of research and writing in 2008–2009. All of the staff I encountered at the archives where I worked were friendly, professional, and efficient, but I want to single out Father Robert Bonfils, S.J., the archivist at the Jesuit archives in Vanves, and his successor, Barbara Baudry, for helping me with the sources on Alphonse Ratisbonne and Ivan Gagarin. Céline Hirsch Poynard, the archivist for the Sisters of Notre-Dame de Sion, went out of her way to help me find conversion narratives from the members of the congregation and caught some mistakes in my chapter on the Ratisbonne brothers. Thanks are also due to Marie-Claude Sabouret, who directs the archive at the Musée de la Vie Romantique, for her help in identifying valuable sources, and for stimulating conversations about Ernest Renan. I have never met Louis Le Guillou, Jean Balcou, or Georges Lubin, but this book could not have been written without their monumental achievements, multivolume editions of the correspondence of Félicité Lamennais, Ernest Renan, and George Sand. Over the past few months I have enjoyed working with Heather Gold, my editor at Yale University Press, a model of friendly efficiency in finding readers and moving the manuscript along through the publication process. On a personal level, my time in Paris has been enriched by the friendship and hospitality of Claude and Ann Langlois and of Florian Michel and Séverine Blenner-Michel. Over the last few years I have been subjected to some goodhumored teasing from my family about this book, which seemed always just one more year away. Behind the jokes I always felt their love and support, so thanks to my children, Dan, Joseph, and Julie, and to their spouses, Clara, Cristeen, and Conor. Claudia Kselman has read Conscience and Conversion in all its versions and responded thoughtfully and patiently when our conversation turned to converts, religious identity, and religious liberty. This book is dedicated to Claudia, who has meant everything to me for over forty years.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nConscience and Conversion\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlthough those of us who live in western democracies argue passionately about the meaning of religious liberty, it is a right we take for granted. Of course, some of the current debates in the United States express alarm about threats to religious liberty coming from state regulation or, conversely, the overreach of religious communities that seek to impose their views on the broader society. In Europe the growing numbers of Muslims have made religious liberty a controversial issue, particularly in France, where the policy of laïcité, built on the restriction of religion to the private sphere, has led to laws restraining the display of religious identity in schools, on the street, and most recently, on beaches.1 Although participants in these debates differ widely in their particular understanding of religious liberty, the vast majority of them accept it as a fundamental right. This book tells one part of the story about how we became accustomed to living in a world where we can believe in and practice a religion of our own choice. It is beyond my capacity, and the capacity of any one person, to tell the whole story, but I propose that exploring religious liberty in France, and especially in Paris, in the aftermath of the French Revolution can illuminate some of the central dilemmas that individuals and societies face as they struggle to understand and apply what has been referred to as the “first freedom.”2 Debates about religious liberty often turn on the expression of religious beliefs in the public sphere, set against the limits that the state imposes to maintain public order. Do religious communities have the right to open churches for public worship, and to establish schools to educate their children within their religious traditions? Can symbols of religious identity be 1\n\n2 introduction\n\ndisplayed on buildings, or on bodies, when these are in the public sphere? Conceived in this manner, freedom of religion is primarily a matter of the relationship between religious communities and the state.3 The issue of church-state relations is of central importance for any study of religious liberty in the modern world and will come up frequently in my account. But focusing on religious liberty as situated primarily within religious communities can veil another dimension of this right, as it plays out in the lives of individuals who decide to convert, to cross a religious boundary, to change their religious identities.4 Approaching religious liberty from the perspective of converts and conversions can bring more sharply into focus what Charles Taylor has defined as the essential characteristic of our secular age. Taylor rejects any simple sense of the modern era as one of religious decline and instead sees it as taking us “from a society in which it was virtually impossible not to believe in God, to one in which faith, even for the staunchest believer, is one human possibility among others.”5 Religious conversions have long drawn the interest of memoirists, novelists, and scholars fascinated by the personal dramas of “turbulent souls,” from Paul and Augustine through contemporary tales of religious exploration and choice, such as those of Stephen Dubner and Emmanuel Carrère.6 An older tradition of conversion studies, represented by William James and Arthur Nock, emphasizes sudden turns and complete transformations in the lives of converts.7 Recent approaches suggest a more ambiguous process, as in Gauri Viswanathan’s argument that “interweaving and disentangling are the metaphors that most accurately describe the conversion experience, which meshes two worlds, two cultures, and two religions, only to unravel their various strands and cast upon each strand the estranged light of unfamiliarity.”8 From my perspective these approaches are not mutually exclusive, for the converts I study struggled with varying degrees of success to reconcile the clear choices presented to them by families and religious institutions with their own complex religious identities. As Lewis Rambo has proposed, conversion is best understood as a process rather than a single event, a move that needs to be understood from a variety of perspectives— psychological, social, and religious.9 Rambo has made some useful distinctions in his typology of conversions, which he breaks down according to the categories of apostasy (“the repudiation of a religious tradition”), intensification (“revitalized commitment to a faith”), affiliation (“the movement of an individual or group from no or minimal religious commitment to full\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\ninvolvement”), institutional transition (“change of an individual or group from one community to another within a major tradition”), and tradition transition (“movement of an individual or group from one major religious tradition to another”).10 We will observe all of these kinds of changes in the converts who will take up most of this book, and often we will see a single individual embodying several of these experiences, moving first within and then departing from a particular religious tradition. I would add that the converts I study end up in a more ambiguous position than typologies such as Rambo’s might suggest, an unsurprising result for a historical approach concerned with individuals in a particular time and place. France is an especially interesting site for observing religious liberty as manifested in the lives of converts. After more than two decades of political and religious turmoil, France in 1814 adopted a constitutional system that endorsed religious liberty, which opened up new possibilities for individual religious choice. Religious liberty was also advancing elsewhere in this period: in the United States, where it was enshrined in state constitutions and the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights (1791), and in Great Britain, where the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829 revoked the penal laws that restricted the property rights of Catholics and denied them the right to sit in Parliament.11 The Bourbon kings who returned in 1814 were thus part of a larger movement when they endorsed religious liberty, but at the same time they declared Catholicism the official state religion and supported a vigorous religious revival in which the Catholic Church sought to recover its position of religious primacy. This combination of Catholic revival and religious liberty produced heated debates about the relationship of church and state in this period, but it also raised perplexing questions for individuals who were struggling to achieve a coherent religious and social identity, searching for what Jan Goldstein refers to as a “post-revolutionary self.”12 The converts whose lives form the basis of this book include some well-known figures, such as Félicité Lamennais, George Sand, and Ernest Renan, as well as several who have left less of an impression in the contemporary world—the brothers Théodore and Alphonse Ratisbonne and the Russian diplomat Ivan Gagarin—though they achieved a certain notoriety in their day. All of them, however, left behind a rich store of materials that allow us to observe them as they made religious decisions that they and their contemporaries understood to be momentous. They were cosmopolitan figures, traveling widely and passionately engaged in the shifting relationships\n\n4 introduction\n\nbetween religion, politics, and society not only in France but in Europe. None of the converts were native Parisians, but it is not coincidental that they often found themselves in the French capital, where they found the freedom to explore their religious choices. Paris has been awarded its titles of “capital of the nineteenth century” and “capital of modernity” for its innovations in urban design and living and for its turbulent social history.13 But it was also a center for religious experimentation, where writers, musicians, political revolutionaries, socialists, and bohemians argued about art, life, and politics, and also about religion.14 To borrow again from Rambo’s vocabulary on conversion, Paris provided an unusually open context within which individuals faced religious crises and pursued quests that would satisfy their desire for lives that had some form of transcendent meaning.15 Unsurprisingly, the converts I have studied sometimes crossed paths, and even those who did not run into each other directly may have passed each other in the streets around the church of Saint-Sulpice, in the neighborhood of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Saint-Sulpice was where George Sand sought relief from a religious crisis, and where Ernest Renan preached his first sermon, just next door to the seminary where he first entertained his serious doubts about Catholic orthodoxy. During his time at the seminary Renan looked forward to a visit from the recently converted Alphonse Ratisbonne, which never materialized. Not far away to the west, on the rue Saint-Dominique, Madame Swetchine hosted at times the Ratisbonne brothers, Ivan Gagarin, and two close associates of Lamennais, Henri Lacordaire and the Count de Montalembert. She also assisted at some of the baptisms in the orphanage for Jewish girls established by Théodore Ratisbonne on the rue de Regard, a short walk from Saint-Sulpice and from her apartment. Lamennais, after he broke with Lacordaire and Montalembert, lived for a time nearby on the rue de Vaugirard. Dinner parties sometimes brought together these and other individuals from a variety of religious traditions in a convivial atmosphere that allowed for the free expression of their ideas. At a dinner given by Franz Liszt in 1835 the guest list included Félicité Lamennais, George Sand, the Baron d’Eckstein (a Protestant from a Jewish family who converted to Catholicism), the Saint-Simonian Emile Barrault, the poet Heinrich Heine (a German Jew who converted to Protestantism and who was sympathetic to Saint-Simonianism), the Catholic philosopher Pierre Ballanche, and Hermann Cohen, a fourteen-year-old Jewish piano prodigy who was later to convert to Catholicism.16 Ivan Gagarin, in a journal\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\nentry from 1838, described with enthusiasm a long conversation with Lamennais at a dinner hosted by the Baron d’Eckstein. Gagarin, soon to convert to Catholicism, was deeply impressed with Lamennais, who had recently left the church, admiring his “impartiality” and “spiritual irony” and his “lively sympathy for all the questions that face humanity.”17 With religious liberty, as with so many other issues, Paris plays a role of capital importance because it channeled concerns that affected all of Europe in the wake of the French Revolution. Scholars who study conversions in other times and places offer both warnings and guidance over how we might interpret the testimony that comes in the form of narratives intended both as self-justification and as public statements designed to influence the religious choices of others. Keith Luria, in an astute examination of conversions in early modern France, argues skeptically that “we cannot assume that [conversion accounts] give us direct access to the personal experience of conversion.”18 In telling their stories Luria’s converts were following models that tell us more about the desire of Protestant and Catholic communities to distinguish themselves from each other than they do about an intimate spiritual transformation. Accepting the doctrines of a church as true, and submitting to its discipline, were at the center of these accounts. Doctrine and church authority continued to be burning issues for converts in the nineteenth century, but their stories emphasize as well the emotional struggles of the individual conscience, drawing on the romantic culture of self-exposure in the tradition of Rousseau’s Confessions. But the problem identified by Luria remains, for a heightened emotional atmosphere in a conversion narrative does not necessarily mean we are closer to a transparent reflection of religious transformation. In the case of my subjects we have a great deal of evidence beyond narratives intended for public consumption, including personal correspondence and private diaries, not to mention accounts by friends, family members, and journalists, but a similar hermeneutic suspicion might be directed at these texts, which can be seen as designed to construct, or reconstruct, a religious decision that seems always somehow out of reach. Rather than despair at this problem of the fraught relationship between narrative and experience, I will approach the words of my subjects, and their colleagues, as indications of deeply felt but imperfectly grasped religious feelings and beliefs that they struggled to express. Their narratives might be understood as “emotives,” to borrow a term from William Reddy’s history\n\n6 introduction\n\nof the emotions, a means for navigating the turbulent passage from one religious identity to another, expressing their freedom “not to make rational choices, but to undergo conversion experiences and life-course changes involving numerous contrasting, often incommensurable factors.”19 I am committed, along with my subjects, to using their words to try to get to their primordial religious experiences, knowing that the effort can never fully succeed. Karl Morrison makes this point nicely when he writes that “the challenge and reward of studying the idea of conversion and its history lie in the obscurity and incommunicability of the experience known metaphorically as conversion.”20 In taking this approach I hope, like Bruce Hindmarsh in his study of English evangelical conversion narratives, to balance trust and suspicion, to reject both a naïve reading of texts and a critique that would prevent us from seeing in their words the human beings who wrote them.21 As the work of Luria, Hindmarsh, and others suggests, the meaning of conversion shifts over time, reflecting the different religious, political, and social contexts that shape religious choice and identity. In the Middle Ages, for example, Karl Morrison has argued that “conversion” came to mean a long process “identified with penitential asceticism, suffering, and martyrdom,” practices institutionalized in monasticism and not necessarily associated with a dramatic moment of transformation, such as Paul experienced on the road to Damascus.22 In the early years of the Reformation, as sharp confessional differences emerged on matters of doctrine and ritual, Protestant converts made painful individual choices that “ended friendships, caused division between neighbors and kin, damaged relations with parents beyond repair, sometimes even caused rejection by a spouse or children.”23 We will observe similar scenes in the lives of the nineteenth-century converts I study, but played out against a very different political and religious background. Although the seeds of religious liberty were planted during the Reformation, Catholics and reformers generally looked toward a period when religious unity would be restored, when there would be no further need to choose. This was the principle established in the Peace of Augsburg (1555) and the basis for settling the religious wars in the Peace of Westphalia (1648), which famously embraced the model of “cuius regio, eius religio” (whose realm, his religion), imagining a Europe in which kings would determine the religious identities of their subjects. We know in practice that religious minorities continued to exist in many states, including France, where a Huguenot minority was granted limited rights to practice by the Edict of Nantes\n\nintroduction\n\n7\n\n(1598).24 We know as well that this apparent violation of “cuius regio” and its corollary of “one king, one law, one faith” was rectified, from the perspective of Catholics, by the revocation of Nantes in 1685, and the subsequent persecution of Protestants for much of the eighteenth century.25 In this context conversions to the state religion of Catholicism were sometimes encouraged, sometimes coerced, and it was difficult if not impossible to imagine a move away from the established church. As we will see, converts struggled painfully over their religious identity in the nineteenth century, and in France the pull of the Catholic Church remained powerful. But they struggled in a context that gave them legal space for religious choices that did not previously exist, and in a cultural climate that encouraged them to reflect anew on what they believed, on how their religious values and commitments shaped their personal identities, family relations, and political loyalties. Conversion narratives thus offer us privileged access to the interplay between individuals and the world they both inhabit and interpret. I accept Hindmarsh’s argument that these accounts are particularly valuable because they reveal the “the explanatory potential of religious conversion and belief for our understanding of the human person as inveterate storyteller and self-biographer,” but with an important amendment.26 Religious motives work powerfully in all of the converts I study, but in some cases doubt wins out, a conclusion that does not seem to emerge from the narratives studied by Luria and Hindmarsh for early modern France and England, nor does it seem to be envisioned by the stages enumerated by Rambo. But if we extend “conversion narrative” to include “disenchantment narrative,” to borrow a term from David Hempton, it becomes capacious enough to cover my subjects, and the complex back-and-forth moves they made in the increasingly liberated religious atmosphere of the nineteenth century.27 Finally, I want to emphasize that although the converts I study were in many ways exceptional individuals, their stories fascinated and troubled both friends who corresponded with them in private and readers who learned about them in a variety of published texts. Some of this interest came from the dramatic or even melodramatic quality of their lives, which I hope will come through in my accounts of their conversions. But contemporaries were also drawn to these converts because their stories revealed an expanding range of religious choices and the ways in which these were linked to the ideologies and institutions that were being reconstructed in the aftermath of the\n\n8 introduction\n\nFrench Revolution. In a sense, my interest in converts parallels that of their contemporaries, for like them I approach my subjects with a specific concern for the ways in which they played along and moved across religious borders.28 Conversions allow us to observe the shifting and problematic contours of religious life marked by pluralism, voluntarism, and experimentation that were on display in post-revolutionary France, and which continue to define our modern religious landscape.29\n\nChapter Outline I open my book with two chapters that present the broad intellectual, political, and cultural contexts within which converts explored their religious choices. In chapter 1 I place the heated debate over the language of religious liberty employed in Article 10 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man within the history of this concept going back to the religious wars of the sixteenth century. Toleration and freedom of conscience were the terms most commonly used to defend the rights of religious minorities in early modern France, deployed against a state preoccupied with what it saw as the threat dissenters posed to domestic and international peace. During the eighteenth century discussion of this issue led beyond arguments about whether or not the monarchy should “tolerate” such worship to assertions that religious liberty was a fundamental right rather than a grant from a generous monarch. But even as the terms of the debate were expanded, religious liberty was still understood primarily as a communal right to worship, as seen in some of the major works of Montaigne, Bayle, Rousseau, and Voltaire. During the French Revolution conflict over religious liberty focused on the status of the Catholic Church, which faced both brutal repression when it was perceived to be an enemy of the new regime and competition from state-sponsored alternative liturgies.30 Individuals were sometimes faced with difficult choices, such as the clergy who had to decide whether or not to take an oath to accept the new constitutional arrangement between church and state.31 But the battle between the Catholic Church and the revolution meant that once again religious liberty was approached primarily as a collective rather than an individual right. I conclude this chapter with a discussion of the status of religious liberty within the constitutional system introduced by the charter granted by the Bourbons in 1814. Although church-state relations continued to be politically controversial, and the cultural authority of the Catholic Church was\n\nintroduction\n\n9\n\nstill an important force in French society, the charter as it was applied during the Restoration and July Monarchy provided a setting that allowed individuals to contemplate with increased self-consciousness and intensity the right to change a religious identity. In chapter 2 I move from philosophical texts and constitutional structures to the world of literature and theater, and in particular to the revival of interest in the “wandering Jew,” a figure I take to be emblematic of the cultural anxiety that accompanied the enhanced understanding of religious liberty as an individual right. Eugène Sue ’s enormously popular novel The Wandering Jew (Le Juif Errant, 1844–1845) is the most noteworthy example of the cultural resonance of Ahasvérus, forced to wander the world until Christ comes again, but he turns up as well in broadsheets, in plays, and on the operatic stage. I see the “wandering Jew” as set in a broader context of cultural anxiety over religious choice and identity, on display in the works of some of the most prominent authors and artists of the first half of the nineteenth century. The most popular opera on the Paris stage in the nineteenth century, Fromental Halévy’s La juive, concludes with the tragic death of a Jewish father and daughter who accept death rather than convert to Christianity. Taken together, this evidence suggests a cultural environment in which readers and audiences were fascinated by stories in which individuals made difficult choices about their religious identities, which brought them into painful conflicts with their families and communities, and with themselves. In chapter 3 I begin considering the ways in which individuals confronted the possibilities for religious choice that they found in the constitutional and cultural setting of post-revolutionary France. I open with an account of the conversion of Alphonse Ratisbonne, a story that rivals La juive in its melodrama and fantastic plotline. In January 1842 Alphonse Ratisbonne, a young Jewish banker from Strasbourg, engaged to be married and known to dislike Christianity, was converted suddenly by what he claimed was a Marian apparition in the church of Sant’Andrea delle Fratte in Rome. Alphonse ’s sudden conversion led to a family crisis and religious controversy, both of them centered in Paris. Following his conversion Alphonse collaborated with his brother Father Théodore Ratisbonne, whose own conversion in the 1820s had also created a public uproar, in founding the Congregation of Notre-Dame de Sion in 1844. The congregation, dedicated to the conversion of Jews, was at the center of a number of dramatic confrontations over conversions in Paris in the 1840s that drew the attention of the\n\n10 i n t r o d u c t i o n\n\nFrench public. Many of these converts were young girls from Jewish families unable to care for them. Their stories reveal the ways in which poverty and gender shaped the ways in which individuals confronted religious choices and constrained their experience of religious liberty. The story of the Ratisbonne brothers and the Congregation of Notre-Dame de Sion shows us both the personal struggles that accompanied decisions to cross a religious boundary and the public fascination with them, confirming the significance of the “wandering Jew” as a symbol for the cultural anxiety that accompanied the arrival of religious freedom. In chapter 4 I turn to the circle of Catholics who gathered in the home of the Russian exile Madame Sophie Swetchine in the 1830s and 1840s on the rue Saint-Dominique, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Madame Swetchine was herself a convert, influenced as a young woman by Joseph de Maistre when he served in St. Petersburg as the Savoyard ambassador to Russia (1803– 1817). After settling in Paris in the 1820s, she established herself as an important salonnière, serving as a bridge between French Catholicism and Russian Orthodoxy. One of her guests, Ivan Gagarin, was a prominent Russian aristocrat and diplomat, preoccupied with the political and spiritual condition of Russia, and an important figure in the debates between the “Slavophiles” and “Westerners” that defined this period in Russian intellectual history. Gagarin’s conversion, finalized in the chapel of Madame Swetchine’s apartment in April 1842, was accompanied by a very difficult period of separation from his family and his career, a liminal state that came to an end with his entry into the Jesuits in August 1843. Deeply attached to Russia and bound by a sense of filial affection and obligation to his family, Gagarin was at the same time critical of the autocracy of Nicholas I (1825–1855) and alienated from the orthodox piety of his parents. In many ways the conversion of Ivan Gagarin resembles that of the Ratisbonne brothers, as he struggled to resolve competing claims of religious belief, family feeling, and national identity. But Gagarin’s conversion suggests more clearly the intellectual appeal Roman Catholicism could exercise in the post-revolutionary age, seen by him as a way of reconciling freedom and authority, Russia and the West. Gagarin found in Madame Swetchine’s salon a place of open-minded religious and political discussions in which tolerance for the opinions of non-Catholics was combined with a profound commitment to the authority of the Roman Church. Catholicism could exert a powerful appeal in this period, but it could also drive people away, a process in which believers came first of all to doubt\n\nintroduction\n\n11\n\ntheir faith and their allegiance to the church and then to make the painful choice to leave it and embrace a new set of principles. The decision to abandon Catholicism was another form of conversion, another way of taking advantage of newly available religious liberty. To consider this dimension my study will take up the lives and works of three prominent intellectuals, Félicité Lamennais (1782–1854), George Sand (1804–1876), and Ernest Renan (1823–1892). All of these figures left extensive accounts of their lives, memoirs that look back on their decisions, but also correspondence that allows us to observe them in the act of making their choices in relationship with families and friends and in dialogue with the social and religious issues of the day. Félicité Lamennais is known for a career that brought him from a position defending Catholicism as the only possible source of legitimacy and order in the post-revolutionary world, to one in which he advocated the marriage of “God and Liberty” under the leadership of the pope, and finally to a violent attack on the church as an enemy of freedom, which led to an excommunication that riveted public attention in the 1830s. In chapter 5 I focus in particular on the crisis that developed following the condemnation of his ideas in the encyclical Mirari vos (1832). For the next five years Lamennais struggled to reconcile his Catholic faith and institutional commitment with his growing sense that the church had abandoned its historical role as he had discerned it—to stand for democratic rights in the face of political tyranny and social injustice. Although Lamennais at times wavered in the face of papal pressure, in 1834 and 1835 he moved toward and finally reached an unequivocal position in which his personal conscience trumped papal authority. In discussing Lamennais’s career I highlight his extensive correspondence with the Count Montalembert, a colleague who struggled with the same issues but who came to an opposite conclusion and ended by accepting church authority. In the end Lamennais came to understand religious liberty as a matter of individual conscience, while Montalembert embraced a definition that emphasized the collective rights of the Catholic community. George Sand is known primarily as a novelist whose life and work make her an iconic figure for the history of feminism. But Sand was also one of the many in France drawn to Lamennais in support of his battle with the Catholic Church and his prophetic call for social justice based on religious principles. Using Sand’s novels, memoir, and correspondence I follow the story of her development from an agnostic upbringing by her unorthodox grandmother to a Catholic schoolgirl whose mystical experience in the\n\n12 i n t r o d u c t i o n\n\ncollege chapel led her to contemplate a religious vocation. As an adult Sand began pulling away from Catholicism at the same time as her marital troubles began, suggesting the connection between religious liberty and female emancipation. Sand’s choices, like those of Madame Swetchine, suggest how women as well as men were able to take advantage of individual religious liberty. But their decisions were made possible in part by their elite status, and in both cases they were guided at times by authoritative male religious figures. In leaving behind orthodox Catholicism Sand was drawn at first to the ideas and person of Lamennais but became even more enamored of the mystical religiosity of Pierre Leroux, who believed in the successive reincarnation of souls, constantly evolving toward spiritual and social perfection. Sand’s religious views coalesced in the 1830s around a belief in a God who calls for justice, a rejection of Catholicism and of religious institutions generally, a denial of an afterlife that would allow for eternal hellfire, and a conviction that all souls are on a path of spiritual progress. Ernest Renan, one of the most prominent French intellectuals of the nineteenth century, is known primarily for his controversial The Life of Jesus (La vie de Jésus), in which he denied the miracles of Christ and expressed a general skepticism about the supernatural. In my chapter on Renan I ponder the question of how a pious young man from Brittany, the most devout region in France, raised in a fervent Catholic family and treated with generosity and solicitude by his clerical mentors, could, in the 1840s, abandon a priestly vocation and, within three years, reject not only the dogmas of the church but belief in the supernatural. Like other converts I study, Renan’s religious choices involved family drama, as he struggled with guilt for disappointing his devout mother. But Renan’s “disenchantment narrative,” contained in his correspondence and critical writings from the period as well as in his memoir, emphasizes how religious choice might be based on a critical scrutiny of the Bible, and on a philosophical commitment to rational inquiry that rejected any appeal to the authority of the Catholic Church. Even while he moved away from Catholicism, however, Renan retained a deep affection for the clergy who were his first teachers and combined his rejection of church doctrine and authority with a profound regret for the Catholic world he had lost. By closing with his story, I bring back into the picture the sustained appeal of Catholicism and suggest the ambiguous quality of religious belief in an age of religious liberty.\n\n1. From Toleration to Liberty Religious Freedom as Concept and Constitutional Right\n\nNo one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious views, provided their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by law. (Nul ne doit être inquiété pour ses opinions, même religieuses, pourvu que leur manifestation ne trouble pas l’ordre public établi par la loi.) —Article 10, Declaration of the Rights of Man\n\nArticle 10 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man can be read today as a straightforward affirmation of the freedom of thought, and in particular of the freedom of religion. But the debates that led to Article 10 were anything but serene. Just over a month after the storming of the Bastille had ensured the survival of the National Assembly, representatives were struggling to draft a document laying out the basic human rights that would undergird the constitution they would write. Of all the heated debates that accompanied this process, those that occurred on August 22 and 23 dealing with religious liberty were the most contentious. The editor of the Gazette Nationale/Moniteur Universel wrote in despair that it was impossible to describe accurately the session of August 23 at which “the most remarkable disorder dominated, where partiality was in control. . . . The motion of M. de Castellane was amended, sub-amended, divided, tortured, twisted in a hundred ways. One heard on all sides: I propose an amendment. . . . I demand to speak.”1\n\n13\n\n14 f r o m t o l e r a t i o n t o l i b e r t y\n\nAt one level the passion that had representatives shouting at each other in the Assembly is easy to grasp. These men were staking out positions on the appropriate role of religion in the reformed French state, a tendentious issue that bedeviled French regimes throughout the revolutionary era and beyond. The Count de Castellane ’s motion, which became the basis for the final version of the article, established a position that maximized individual freedom, asserting that “no one ought to be disturbed for his religious opinions, nor troubled in the exercise of his religion.”2 From Castellane’s perspective, shared by the Count de Mirabeau, the leading voice for reform in the Assembly, Catholics and non-Catholics had equal rights to believe and practice the religion of their choice, and the state had no role to play in policing how this religious freedom was exercised. Castellane ’s motion provoked controversy because it replaced drafts of three articles that looked back to the Old Regime in declaring that a stateendorsed religion was essential for the public order. Article 18 of this earlier proposal included an explicit reference to an established religion as a legitimate constraint on individual religious liberty: “No citizen who does not trouble the established cult should be disturbed.”3 Castellane’s attempt to discard language supporting a public cult and a regulatory role for the state provoked heated responses from defenders of Catholic interests in the Assembly, most notably the abbé d’Eymar. As the debate drew to an end, Eymar proposed to substitute for Castellane’s motion Article 16 of the earlier proposal: “Law, being unable to control secret crimes, needs the support of religion. It is thereby essential and indispensable for the good order of society, that religion be maintained, conserved, and respected.”4 Mirabeau and the Protestant pastor Jean-Paul Rabaut de Saint-Etienne fought back hard against this assertion of the state ’s interest in maintaining religion, pushing the Assembly to reject Eymar’s motion and vote on Castellane’s instead. But it was at this point that the chaos described by the Moniteur broke out, and at the last minute the motion was amended to add the clause that preserved a tutelary role for the state. In the final wording Article 10, following Castellane, affirmed that no person would be troubled for his religious opinions, but only if “their manifestation does not trouble the public order established by law.”5 Although it substituted “public order” for “established cult” as the basis for warranting limits on religious liberty, this last-minute amendment amounted to a concession to those Catholics who wished the state to retain the right to monitor and control the public expression of religion. It also\n\nf r o m t o l e r at i o n t o l i b e rt y\n\n15\n\nopened the door for all future regimes to intervene in religious matters based on shifting interpretations of what constituted a threat to “public order.” Looking back on the debates over Article 10 it is easy to see the relationship between church and state, Catholicism and the emerging regime, as the central point of contention. But in stating their positions on this question the representatives in the National Assembly also reformulated the terms used for understanding religious liberty, and their relationship to each other. This shift was dramatically emphasized in the speeches of François JeanJoseph de Laborde and Mirabeau on August 22. Laborde began by calling on the delegates to embrace the idea of tolerance, and to remember all the blood shed by intolerance over the past two centuries. He referred as well to the “freedom of conscience” and the “freedom of religion,” but he used these phrases, along with “tolerance,” indiscriminately. No one could doubt that Laborde favored Castellane ’s proposal, but his language suggests a fuzzy conceptualization of the basic terms used to define and defend religious liberty. Mirabeau’s speech, which followed Laborde’s, suffers from no such confusion. Mirabeau publicly rebuked his colleague, not because they disagreed on the need to defend religious liberty but because of the terms he employed to defend this right. Mirabeau proclaimed that “I do not come to preach tolerance. The most unlimited freedom of religion is in my eyes a right so sacred that the word tolerance, which attempts to express it, appears to me itself tyrannical, since the existence of the authority that has the power to tolerate undermines the liberty of thought, for that which it tolerates, it might choose not to tolerate.”6 The following day Rabaut de Saint-Etienne came back to this point forcefully: “But Gentlemen, it is not even tolerance that I demand; it is liberty. . . . Tolerance! I ask that it be banned in turn, and it will be, this unjust word, which presents us as citizens worthy to be pitied, criminals to be pardoned.”7 This assault on “tolerance” might seem surprising, given how proponents of reform had previously used the term to criticize official persecution of religious minorities. Toleration developed as a practice and also as an idea throughout the eighteenth century, culminating in a series of measures in France, Prussia, the Hapsburg Empire, the Dutch Republic, and Great Britain that granted religious minorities limited civil rights.8 In France the revolutionary decade of the 1790s produced a paradoxical situation in which the religious liberty affirmed in Article 10 of the Declaration of the Rights of\n\n16 f r o m t o l e r a t i o n t o l i b e r t y\n\nMan was compromised by the intermittent and sometimes violent repression of organized religious practice.9 This gap between theory and practice contributed to a further elaboration of the terms used to define religious liberty, a development that was passed on to the constitutional regimes of Napoleon, the Bourbon Restoration, and the July Monarchy. The experience of religious liberty in the post-revolutionary era took place in a historical context shaped by philosophical debates and state policies that evolved over the three centuries that began with the Reformation. It is beyond the scope of this book to trace in detail the history of religious liberty during this period, but an overview of how its definition and practice evolved from the Reformation through the early nineteenth century can suggest the complicated political and spiritual landscape within which the converts I study lived and moved. In this chapter I will review the evolution of religious liberty in some major texts and in state policy from the sixteenth through the early nineteenth centuries. Starting in the sixteenth century French writers such as Montaigne, concerned with the violence and disorder that followed from the Protestant Reformation, developed an evolving set of concepts that form an important part of the history of religious liberty. These concepts, in particular liberté de conscience and tolérance, were not always clearly distinguished from each other, nor was their relationship fully articulated, an ambiguity that helps explain the confusion in the debates of 1789.10 But they played a major role in the philosophical discussions and state policies of the period and laid the groundwork for an expanding language of religious liberty enunciated during the French Revolution and embedded in the liberal political systems that emerged in the nineteenth century. Laying out the history of these terms is complicated, in part because of the shifting and fluid ways in which they were used and in part because they become entangled with the overarching concept of religious liberty, which concerns me here. In order to be clear, I will generally retain the French (tolérance, liberté de conscience, liberté religieuse, liberté des cultes), or place the specific English term in quotation marks, but will use “religious liberty” without emphasis to indicate the general category within which they operate. The language and policies that define the history of religious liberty in the Old Regime troubled and engaged writers from Montaigne through Benjamin Constant on a personal as well as a theoretical level. As with the individuals whose religious choices will take up much of this book, religious liberty in the Old Regime was not only a philosophical issue involving state\n\nf r o m t o l e r at i o n t o l i b e rt y\n\n17\n\npolicy but a question of personal identity with profound existential resonance. Converts in the post-revolutionary decades made their decisions within a religious culture shaped by language and memory inherited from the Old Regime. My goal here is to examine this culture so we can better grasp the individual and collective dimensions of religious liberty that the Ratisbonne brothers, Ivan Gagarin, Félicité Lamennais, George Sand, and Ernest Renan grappled with and reformulated, thereby helping to define the modern experience of this fundamental right.\n\n“Freedom of Conscience” in Montaigne Montaigne ’s Essays provide an invaluable starting point for probing the complicated ways in which religious liberty was understood in the crisis of the religious wars of sixteenth-century France (1562–1598) and in the aftermath of the horrors of the St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre of 1572, when Catholic mobs in Paris slaughtered several thousand Protestants.11 Questions of religious identity and liberty were a preoccupation if not an obsession in this period, as Protestants and Catholics struggled against each other and sought to construct a political and religious regime that would restore peace and order in France. It is well known that Montaigne played a significant diplomatic role in mediating between Henri III, the Catholic League, and the Protestant forces led by Henri de Navarre.12 These efforts at reconciliation align with some of his reflections in the Essays, but this work reveals as well the ambiguity and tension built into debates over religious liberty. As sensitive and sympathetic as he is in confronting individual uncertainty and volatility, Montaigne gives serious weight also to the obligation of an individual to accept the religion of the state as essential for a well-ordered society. Montaigne takes up directly the issue of freedom of conscience (liberté de conscience) in an essay of that title, which focuses primarily on the Roman emperor Julian the Apostate and his religious policies with regard to Christians.13 The essay opens, however, with a direct comment on the French civil wars. Although Montaigne approves of those “upholding the religion and constitution of our country,” he condemns those who reject a policy of moderation in favor of “decisions which are unjust, violent, and rash.” Shifting quickly from contemporary France to the Roman Empire, Montaigne claims that Julian was “harsh . . . but not cruel” in his treatment of Christians and in the end adopted a policy of liberté de conscience, hoping that this would create\n\n18 f r o m t o l e r a t i o n t o l i b e r t y\n\nreligious divisions that would weaken any potential resistance to his reign.14 The concluding passage of this essay is characteristic of Montaigne’s thought, with its subtle appreciation of the different strategic uses made of liberté de conscience and its ironic description of royal policy. “It is worth considering that, in order to stir up the flames of civil strife, the Emperor Julian exploited the self-same remedy of freedom of conscience which our kings now employ to stifle them. On the one side you could say that to slacken the reins and allow the parties to hold on to their opinions is the way to sow dissension broadcast: it is all but equivalent to lending a hand to increase it, since there is no obstacle to bar its course and no legal constraint to rein it back. For the other side you could say that to slacken the reins and allow the parties to hold on to their opinions is to soften and weaken them by ease and laxity; it blunts the goad, whereas rareness, novelty and difficulty sharpen it. Yet for the honor and piety of our kings I prefer to believe that, since they could not do what they wished, they pretended to wish to do what they could.”15 What are we to make of this curious and complex passage? As M. A. Screech notes, Montaigne’s concept of liberté de conscience in this essay can be taken to mean “freedom of worship granted to a rival sect of Christians,” that is to say, a policy of state toleration directed at a dissident religious minority. Although the term “conscience” carries with it a sense of individual right, compatible with Montaigne’s sympathetic consideration of the subjective self, in the context of the murderous religious wars of this period liberté de conscience was understood to refer primarily to the right of public worship.16 Furthermore, despite the positive tone in describing Julian’s policy, Montaigne’s conclusion emphasizes the different motives that led to arguments favoring this liberty, and the uncertain consequences that might follow from allowing it. Julian expected that a policy of liberté de conscience would lead to religious pluralism, shoring up his regime by dividing potential enemies into competing sects. For French kings (presumably Charles IX, Henri III, and Henri IV), however, liberté de conscience and pluralism would lead to social peace, as communities would be grateful for the chance to worship openly, free from persecution. Montaigne’s closing jab suggests that the Valois kings had chosen to accept the principle of liberté de conscience because they had no choice. Montaigne ’s concern with following his thoughts wherever they might lead produces an ambivalent posture that is both sympathetic and critical toward “freedom of conscience,” interpreted primarily from the perspective of rulers considering how best to maintain peace and harmony in their\n\nf r o m t o l e r at i o n t o l i b e rt y\n\n19\n\ndomains. Montaigne has thought his way into the royal policy that he supported, a process that results in a profound but telling paradox. Since enforcing the ideal of religious uniformity has generated civil war, he argues, kings (and their advisers?) have taken the less attractive but prudent alternative of allowing different cults to practice within their states. But in the course of making this move, kings (and their advisers?) turn pragmatic policy into principle. This subtle move may be an act, a pretense, but it nonetheless shifts the basis for defending “freedom of conscience” from practical necessity to social ideal. The open-ended quality of Montaigne ’s position on liberté de conscience is in sharp contrast to comments made elsewhere in the Essays. As Quentin Skinner and others have observed, Montaigne combines skepticism about absolute claims of religious truth with an insistence on the value of religious uniformity. This principle is affirmed at the outset of “An Apology for Raymond Sebond,” where Montaigne argues that the “novelties of Luther . . . would soon degenerate into loathsome atheism.” But the consequences of admitting religious difference would be social and political as well as religious: “Once you have put into [the hands of ordinary people] the foolhardiness of despising and criticizing opinions which they used to hold in the highest awe (such as those which concern their salvation), and once you have thrown into the balance of doubt and uncertainty any articles of their religion, they soon cast all the rest of their beliefs into similar uncertainty. They had no more authority for them, no more foundation, than for those you have just undermined; and so, as though it were the yoke of a tyrant, they shake off all those other concepts which had been impressed upon them by the authority of Law and the awesomeness of ancient custom.”17 Here Montaigne establishes religious uniformity as an ideal, even while his efforts at reconciling the warring factions in 1588, and his opposition to all forms of cruelty and violence, align him with the alternative policy of the politiques. This group was central to the eventual resolution of the religious wars, but their advocacy of toleration was prudential, based on the need to establish social peace. Given the terrible costs of the war, the politiques advocated a policy of tolerance as a lesser of two evils, an unfortunate concession made necessary in order to avoid the destruction of the commonwealth, “the only alternative to endemic civil strife.”18 Montaigne ’s position was part of a powerful tradition that helps explain the qualified nature of the Edict of Nantes (1598), in which Henri IV\n\n20 f r o m t o l e r a t i o n t o l i b e r t y\n\nallowed Protestants to worship within clearly specified geographical limits, looking ahead to a time when they would be “better instructed, or convinced in their consciences by the Holy Spirit of their error and heresy.”19 Not all those who argued in favor of “freedom of conscience” during the sixteenth century looked forward to the restoration of religious uniformity. But Sebastian Castellio, Guillaume Postel, and Jean Bodin, like Montaigne, nevertheless regarded religious pluralism with a heavy sense of regret.20 Defenders of “freedom of conscience” in the sixteenth century did not celebrate religious liberty as a source of healthy pluralism; they viewed it as a regrettable concession to the flawed human condition. Montaigne ’s skepticism led him to a qualified and complex defense of “freedom of conscience.” It led him as well to a paradoxical position critical of dissent, and an argument that individuals should accept the reigning religious system. Montaigne ’s defense of religious uniformity is hard to reconcile with the profound exploration of the individual that is the dominant characteristic of the Essays. Montaigne comes back repeatedly and often to reflections that show him to be unsure of his position and open-minded about alternatives, a posture already on display in the conclusion of his essay on “freedom of conscience.” In “On Presumption” he writes that “philosophy never seems to have a better hand to play than when she battles against our presumption and our vanity; when in good faith she acknowledges her weakness, her ignorance, and her inability to reach conclusions.”21 Passages such as this make it easy to understand Charles Rosen’s comment that “fundamental to Montaigne is the conclusion that casts doubt upon itself, and thus reveals him at his most profound.”22 Taking Montaigne at his word, he manages to combine a fascination with the individual self, understood in all its volatility and uncertainty, with a sincere attachment to Catholicism, based on his respect for social convention and religious authority. In the Essays Montaigne captures the origins of the tense and ambiguous relationship between individuals, religious communities, and states whose evolution we will follow throughout this book.23 The Edict of Nantes, proclaimed by Henri IV in 1598 in order to settle over thirty years of intermittent violence and civil war, employs language similar to Montaigne ’s in allowing for the protection of Protestant “freedom of conscience” that had been under assault during the wars of religion.24 Although the edict allowed Protestants limited rights of public worship and representation in courts, it looked forward to a future when God would be\n\nf r o m t o l e r at i o n t o l i b e rt y\n\n21\n\nworshiped in the same form by everyone, thus replicating the ambiguous posture of Montaigne regarding religious minorities. Although it is often referred to as the “Edict of Toleration,” the document makes no use of tolérance, a term that had only recently been introduced to describe a state policy of permitting more than one religion, adopted out of necessity.25 By the end of the sixteenth century, in the Edict of Nantes, “freedom of conscience” had emerged as a principle concept for defending religious liberty, but at this stage it was laden with a sense of regret and constraint and referred ambiguously to both individuals and religious communities.\n\nBayle, Bergier, and Bourbon Policy in the Eighteenth Century The revocation of the Edict of Nantes, enacted by the Edict of Fontainebleau (1685), was a catastrophic political mistake on the part of Louis XIV and his advisers. As a result, as many as two hundred thousand Protestants who had contributed to the prosperity of the kingdom fled the country, contributing to a wave of negative public opinion that fueled the international coalition that would oppose France over the next thirty years. Apart from such tactical considerations, it is difficult not to be shocked and disgusted by the repressive policies that led up to and followed the revocation. Bribes and harassment were designed to coerce conversions, practices that seem mild compared to the billeting of troops with Protestant families, which led thousands to convert in the early 1680s. I will not rehearse here the details of the repression that led up to and followed the revocation and that produced a major rebellion in the early seventeenth century.26 It is worth remembering that in several places local communities maintained peaceful relations for much of the seventeenth century, in the face of increasing royal pressure for religious uniformity.27 But the Edict of Fontainebleau was a landmark event, forcing Protestants to flee, convert, or go underground and provoking an intellectual response that led to a new stage in the history of religious liberty. To grasp this change no figure is more important than Pierre Bayle (1647–1706). Bayle’s approach to religious freedom was not just an academic matter for him, for his life was marked by several movements across religious boundaries and a personal tragedy that resulted from the repression of the 1680s. The son of a Calvinist minster, Bayle converted to Catholicism as a young man before returning to the faith of his father and becoming a professor at the Protestant Academy in Sedan. In the face of the intensified persecution\n\n22 f r o m t o l e r a t i o n t o l i b e r t y\n\nthat began in 1681 Bayle fled to the Dutch Republic, where he published a series of works that helped establish the foundation for the Enlightenment, including the Lettre sur la comète (1682) and the Dictionnaire historique et critique (1696). Because officials could not prosecute Bayle for heresy, they arrested his brother Jacob, who died in prison in 1685, adding a personal dimension to Bayle’s assault on intolerance.28 The revocation of the Edict of Nantes provided the immediate context for Bayle’s groundbreaking defense of religious liberty in his Philosophical Commentary on These Words of the Gospel, Luke 14:23, ‘Compel Them to Come In, That My House May Be Full ’ (Commentaire philosophique sur ces paroles de Jésus-Christ: Contrains-les d’entrer) (1686).29 Bayle ’s work is an extended refutation of the Catholic interpretation of the passage from the Gospel of Luke (14:23) where Jesus instructs his listeners with the parable of the wedding feast to which the invited guests refuse to come. After the host has replaced those on the guest list with the poor, lame, and blind there are still places left at the table, which leads Jesus to order his servant to “go into the roads and lanes, and compel people to come in, so that my house may be filled.” Catholic apologists, starting with Augustine, had used this passage to defend the state repression of heresy and the enforcement of religious uniformity, an argument renewed in the wake of the Edict of Fontainebleau. Bayle ’s attack against this position is based first of all on its failure to meet a basic standard of reason that must be applied to religious claims. Bayle is careful to identify reason as a God-given ability, not an attribute derived solely from human nature, though such a claim was not enough to protect him from charges of atheism. But for Bayle coerced acts have no religious value, for the nature of religion requires first of all “a certain persuasion in the soul with regard to God,” which would then manifest itself in “outward signs.” But if “these outward signs exist without that interior state of the soul which answers to them, or with such an inward state as is contrary to them, they are acts of hypocrisy and falsehood, or impiety and revolt against conscience.”30 From this perspective a state policy of intolerance and repression forces a division between the conscience and outward behavior, an unreasonable posture and therefore an inappropriate interpretation of Luke. Bayle draws as well directly from biblical texts and insists that any reasonable interpretation of the New Testament would conclude that the “principal character of Jesus Christ . . . the reigning qualities of his soul, were humility, meekness, and patience,” attributes that clearly contradict any policy of force carried out in his name.31\n\nf r o m t o l e r at i o n t o l i b e rt y\n\n23\n\nBayle does not deny that clergy and statesmen had the right to make efforts to convince dissenters that they were mistaken, but no such arguments could rely on force. In taking this position Bayle uses the term “freedom of conscience” as an individual right as the basis for a state policy he refers to as “tolerance.” “That it is the duty of superiors to use their utmost endeavors, by lively and solid remonstrances, to undeceive those who are in error; yet to leave them the full liberty of declaring for their opinions, and serving God according to the dictates of their conscience, if they have not the good fortune to convince them: neither laying before them any snare or temptation of worldly punishment in case they persist, nor reward if they abjure. Here we find the fixed indivisible point of true liberty of conscience [liberté de conscience]; and so far as any one swerves more or less from this Point, so far he more or less reduces tolerance [tolérance].”32 Bayle’s Commentary is a passionate defense of “freedom of conscience” as the basis for a policy of “toleration” of religious minorities and represents a major shift in the ways in which these terms had been deployed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Unlike Montaigne, Bayle uses both terms in his work, and again unlike Montaigne, he defends them without the irony of the Essays. Barbara de Negroni sees Bayle ’s work as a “Copernican revolution” in the history of religious liberty, insofar as “tolerance is no longer based on objective criteria, but on the position of the subject; it derives not from revealed dogmas, but from the rights of conscience.”33 On the basis of his robust argument for “freedom of conscience” and “toleration” Bayle perhaps merits Jonathan Israel’s judgment that he was a key figure in a “radical Enlightenment” characterized by rationalism, religious skepticism, and political principles that form the basis for modern liberal and democratic societies.34 But Bayle at one point does pull back from a “radical” position and asserts, as does John Locke, a “moderate” in Israel’s terms, that atheists should not share in the “freedom of conscience” granted to Christians.35 This position does not fit well with the overall argument in his Commentary, nor with Bayle ’s other writings that defend the possibility of the “virtuous atheist.” Based on such inconsistencies, Israel dismisses Bayle’s comment on atheism as “de rigueur,” suggesting that his position was not meant to be taken seriously, since it is so deeply incompatible with his otherwise unequivocal defense of freedom of conscience.36 Perhaps this is so, but it is also possible that Bayle meant what he wrote, a position that would put him more in line with Locke, and with a prior tradition in which defenders of toleration made a\n\n24 f r o m t o l e r a t i o n t o l i b e r t y\n\npoint to exclude atheists, seen as incapable of participating in the civil order.37 However we interpret this passage, it is telling that Bayle was still willing to make at least some concession to the right of the state to enforce a certain level of religious belief.38 Nonetheless, Bayle’s powerful endorsement of “freedom of conscience” and “tolerance” formed the basis for subsequent defenses of religious liberty, while the persecution of the Huguenots that was renewed in 1685 kept the focus of such discussions on the issue of state policy toward the public worship of religious minorities. “Freedom of conscience” was an individual right, but its exercise was understood to take place in specific communities whose “toleration” by the state was the principal concern.39 The arguments in favor of “freedom of conscience” and “tolerance” did not go unchallenged. At the General Assembly of the Clergy in 1651 the bishop of Comminges called on the young Louis XIV “to banish from his kingdom this unfortunate liberty of conscience, which destroys the true liberty of God’s children.”40 Throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries “semantic associations of tolérance were largely negative, so the strongest traditions that French political culture inherited from its medieval past were profoundly antithetical to the acceptance of religious division within the kingdom.”41 This tradition of hostility to a policy of toleration endured throughout the eighteenth century, as illustrated in the Dictionnaire de théologie of the abbé Bergier (1718–1790), a standard manual well into the nineteenth century as well. Bergier’s position is particularly significant because it came from a writer identified with the “Catholic Enlightenment,” known for his engagement with the philosophes and their discussions of reason and nature as the basis for knowledge.42 Bergier subjected Bayle’s concept of “freedom of conscience” to what he understood to be a withering attack, arguing that to accept the position that we are obligated to follow our conscience wherever it leads opens the door to heresy, crime, and disorder. Conscience can claim its rights over us only when it has been properly instructed in the truths of the Catholic faith. “It is not true that in forcing [Protestants] to allow themselves to be instructed, one obliges them to act against their conscience; they are constrained only to be enlightened and reformed; when they refuse it is not because of their sensitivity to their conscience, but the result of pure obstinacy.” For Bergier, claims made on the basis of “freedom of conscience” were a mere pretext for Protestants who “wanted to profess their religion publicly, to exercise with the greatest possible display a religion\n\nf r o m t o l e r at i o n t o l i b e rt y\n\n25\n\ndifferent from the dominant religion, to take possession of churches, banish Catholics, hunt down and exterminate priests, as they have done in those places where they became masters.”43 As for “tolerance,” Bergier regarded as “an absurdity” the idea that “all religions ought to be equally permitted, none ought to be dominant or favored over another, and every individual ought to decide for himself whether or not to have one.”44 Bergier clearly grasped the principles of “freedom of conscience” and “tolerance” and just as clearly dismissed them as incompatible with Catholic orthodoxy. Although Protestants had certainly acted with intolerance and violence during the wars of religion, by the middle of the eighteenth century Bergier’s description of them much more aptly described recent practices of the French state. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes was celebrated by the Catholic clergy as a triumph of truth over heresy, and when Protestant communities in the Cévennes mountains in southern France resisted they were brutally repressed in a bloody civil war.45 The death of Louis XIV in 1715 led to a brief respite, but when Louis XV came of age one of the first acts of his reign was to reaffirm the absolute prohibition of any religion other than Catholicism in a decree of 1724: “It is our will that the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman Religion alone be practiced in our Kingdom, and all the lands under our authority; we forbid to all of our subjects of any estate, quality, and condition to exercise in any way a religion other than Catholicism, and to gather for such a purpose in any place under any pretext, under pain of being sentenced for life to the galleys, for men, and to be shaved and imprisoned for life, for the women.”46 Despite these prohibitions and threats, Protestant communities managed to survive in what became known as the “church of the desert,” but without any legal protection they were dependent on the forbearance of local officials. A crackdown occurred, for example, in Bordeaux in 1749, where the courts sentenced nine men to life terms in the galleys, and their wives to be shaved and imprisoned, for having been married in a Protestant ceremony.47 In the second half of the eighteenth century such persecution was still possible, as evident in the famous Calas affair, discussed later in this chapter. But after 1750 what had been formerly regarded as orthodox doctrine and standard state policy in support of “one King, one law, one faith” came increasingly to be regarded as unreasonable, cruel, and counterproductive. But even as “freedom of conscience” and “tolerance” became more acceptable, they continued to evoke complex attitudes and unresolved tensions about the meaning of religious liberty.\n\n26 f r o m t o l e r a t i o n t o l i b e r t y\n\nVoltaire, Rousseau, and the Encyclopédie: Tolérance and Conscience in the Enlightenment For the philosophes religious liberty was a central concern, evident in three key texts that all appeared within the two-year period of 1762–1763: JeanJacques Rousseau’s Emile and The Social Contract, first published in 1762, and Voltaire ’s Treatise on Tolerance, which appeared in 1763.48 Voltaire and Rousseau were writing in a context in which intolerance was still state policy, with the Edict of Fontainebleau (1685) officially in effect. But in the second half of the eighteenth century, Protestant communities began to profit from a policy of benign neglect.49 When this de facto toleration was abandoned it was shocking and offensive in part because open persecution had become unusual. This emerging experience of religious liberty was nonetheless fragile because it could still be and was at times violated by an intolerant state. The philosophes regarded Bayle with enormous respect, and their defense of “freedom of conscience” and its link to “toleration” follows closely his reasoning. But Bayle also devoted hundreds of pages to a close reading of the church fathers, understood as authorities who could help provide the proper interpretation of Luke 14:23. For Voltaire and Rousseau, scriptural texts and church fathers were irrelevant in considering religious liberty, which derived from a natural right inherent in each individual. But in their aggressive and rationalistic defense of religious liberty Voltaire and Rousseau still struggled to articulate clearly the nature of an individual right to freedom of conscience in its relationship to the duties to family, community, and state. Voltaire, in his Treatise on Tolerance, condemns in the most forthright manner the persecution of the Protestant religious minority in France. In doing so he relies on the concepts of liberté de conscience and tolérance inherited from Bayle, but he does not distinguish these with the same clarity as his predecessor, and he uses them interchangeably, in a manner similar to some of the speeches in the National Assembly of 1789. In chapter 5, for example, when he proposes that Germany demonstrates how tolerance produces social harmony, he refers to liberté de conscience, even though the context suggests he is concerned with communal and not individual rights. For Voltaire, Germany would be “a desert covered with the bones of Catholics, Evangelicals, Reformers, and Anabaptists, all massacred by each other, were it not for the Peace of Westphalia which eventually established in the country the right to freedom of conscience.”50\n\nf r o m t o l e r at i o n t o l i b e rt y\n\n27\n\nVoltaire may have been sympathetic to the freedom of individual religious choice, but in the Treatise on Tolerance he tends to look aside from this issue to focus instead on Catholic persecution of the Protestant community. As with Bayle, he saw freedom of conscience as inextricably bound to the issue of state toleration of religious dissidents, which remained in the foreground of his thinking. This tendency to look first of all at the state in considering religious liberty can be seen in Voltaire’s interpretation of the treatment of the Calas family by the French judicial system, the cause célèbre that prompted Voltaire to write the Treatise.51 In his essay Voltaire reviews the tragic story, in which a mentally disturbed son in a Protestant family who had perhaps been considering conversion to Catholicism committed suicide. The Parlement of Toulouse subsequently found the father guilty of murder on flimsy evidence, which led to his execution and the persecution of the entire family. For Voltaire and his enlightened colleagues, the Calas affair became a symbol of official Catholic intolerance toward a minority community. But Voltaire spends no time in his essay explicitly defending liberté de conscience from the perspective of individual choice, despite the pivotal role this played in the affair. For Voltaire, religious liberty centered on the right of Protestants to worship publicly and to be protected against state violence, with individual freedom of conscience a prior but unexamined assumption. Voltaire condemns the Catholic judges of Toulouse for intolerance directed at the Calas family and the Protestant community. But he never probes the basis for their unreasonable decision, the conviction on the part of Catholics that families would regard with murderous hatred a member who chose to leave the family’s religion. The Catholic judges of Toulouse could not imagine that Protestants might accept such an act of communal disloyalty based on the rights of individual conscience. Voltaire did not bother constructing an argument against such an assumption, which would have distracted him from his main goal of advocating for a policy of state tolerance.52 Voltaire ’s passionate defense of toleration is echoed in Laborde’s speech in the debate over Article 10, but in that debate as well the communal dimension of religious liberty, not the freedom of the individual conscience, remains the principal focus. The freedom of the individual is very much in the foreground of JeanJacques Rousseau’s reflections on religious liberty, but his writings on this topic further illuminate the tension inherent in this issue as it was understood in the eighteenth century.53 Rousseau’s struggle to make sense of religious\n\n28 f r o m t o l e r a t i o n t o l i b e r t y\n\nliberty comes as no surprise given the complicated religious journey he took in his own life, as described in his Confessions. Rousseau abandoned his Calvinism in 1728 as a young man of sixteen, converted not by any change in his religious convictions but because of the charm of a young woman, Mme de Warens, who later became his mistress.54 After their initial, brief meeting, Mme de Warens, herself a convert supported by the king of Savoy because of her success as a proselytizer, sent Rousseau off to a hospice for converts in Turin. There he would be instructed and accepted into the Catholic faith, but the completion of his conversion was a painful process in which a supposedly free choice of a new religion was compromised, even coerced, by the circumstances in which he found himself. In the Confessions Rousseau describes a horrific institution whose ignorant teachers failed to convince him of the truths of Catholicism, and which was a haven for pederasts, one of whom attempted to seduce him.55 Impoverished and alone in the world, Rousseau nonetheless went through with the charade of a conversion that was fundamentally insincere. Reflecting on his decision to convert in the Confessions, Rousseau takes a position that belies his own experience: “It is clear, I think, that for a child, and even for a man, to have a religion means to follow the one in which he is born.”56 While it is easy to see why Rousseau would take such a position given the troubled transition that he lived through at Turin, affirming the value of religious constancy, of fidelity to the faith of one ’s fathers, nonetheless runs counter to Rousseau’s commitment to independence and liberty in matters of religion, a tension that is developed in more detail in Emile and The Social Contract. In Emile Rousseau’s struggle with religious liberty takes center stage in book 4, which includes the famous “Creed of a Savoyard Vicar.” In scrutinizing this text from the perspective of religious liberty we should recall Rousseau’s general principle that individuals who have reached adolescence, at twelve or thirteen, should learn through a process of independent discovery. As articulated in book 3, Rousseau applies this principle to the study of nature, but the language suggests as well an underlying commitment to intellectual independence: “Put the problems before him and let him solve them himself. Let him know nothing because you have told him, but because he has learnt it for himself. . . . If ever you substitute authority for reason he will cease to reason; he will be a mere plaything of other people’s thoughts.”57 As we shall see, Rousseau struggles to reconcile this principle, which might lead to a defense of the absolute liberty of conscience in religious matters,\n\nf r o m t o l e r at i o n t o l i b e rt y\n\n29\n\nwith the right of the father to raise his children in the religion he chooses and the need for an overarching set of religious values embraced by all members of a society. In Emile Rousseau’s pupil has been raised to be a student of nature, which he discovers on his own, though with the help of the guiding and at times intrusive hand of a tutor. But while the tutor subtly assists and shapes the education of Emile, he adamantly refuses to present him with doctrines that do not arise from personal experience. Consequently, the regime advocated by Rousseau includes no formal religious education, a point that Rousseau acknowledges might surprise his readers: “At fifteen he will not even know that he has a soul, at eighteen even he may not be ready to learn about it.” Such ignorance is an advantage compared to the “heart-breaking stupidity” that comes from the mindless memorization of the catechism. For Rousseau, a child “understands so little of what he is made to repeat that if you tell him to say just the opposite he will be quite ready to do it. . . . When a child says he believes in God, it is not God he believes in, but Peter or James who told him that there is something called God.”58 Not only are religious ideas mindlessly parroted, they vary widely from place to place; faith is, according to Rousseau, a matter of geography.59 This variability of religious ideas carries with it an insidious consequence, for children are instructed to disparage the religions of other people and thereby form ideas of God that are “mean, grotesque, harmful, and unworthy.” This religious formation lasts throughout their lives, so that “as men they understand no more of God than they did as children.”60 Rousseau’s ideal education, in which children would not receive any religious instruction, raised a difficult question. If the religions fathers teach to children, based on the accidental circumstances of their place of birth, are to be rejected, what should take their place? In what religion should Emile be raised? At first Rousseau’s answer seems clear: “What religion shall we give him, to what sect shall this child of nature belong? The answer strikes me as quite easy. We will not attach him to any sect, but we will give him the means to choose for himself according to the right use of his own reason.”61 It is precisely at this point in Emile that Rousseau breaks away from a style in which he directly addresses the reader and passes the word to the famous “Savoyard Vicar,” a text in which Rousseau recalls (and reinvents) his own experience in Turin and the help he received from a sympathetic and heterodox Catholic clergyman.62 In Emile Rousseau passes over the fact that he\n\n30 f r o m t o l e r a t i o n t o l i b e r t y\n\nactually went through with his conversion and instead emphasizes his skepticism and despair as a young man who had come to see religion as “a mask for selfishness, . . . its holy services but a screen for hypocrisy.”63 The “creed of the Savoyard Vicar” has become one of the most famous of Rousseau’s texts, a powerful argument for a religion that rejects the divisive dogmas of established churches in favor of a belief shaped by the feeling individual’s communing with a harmonious natural order. Rousseau’s theological speculations, which he intended as a refutation of atheism, earned him the condemnation of the Paris Parlement, which reacted against his explicit critique of ritual and revelation.64 Forced to flee to Switzerland to avoid prosecution, Rousseau paid a personal price for embodying his insistence in Emile that the heart of all authentic religious experience is the individual human conscience, the point where the divine and the human meet: “Conscience! Conscience! Divine instinct, immortal voice from heaven; sure guide for a creature ignorant and finite indeed, yet intelligent and free; infallible judge of good and evil, making man like to God!”65 The Savoyard’s theological emphasis on the divinized individual conscience leads him inevitably back to an affirmation of the absolute right of the individual to choose his religion: “Let us therefore seek honestly after truth; let us yield nothing to the claims of birth, to the authority of parents and pastors, but let us summon to the bar of conscience and reason all that they have taught us from our childhood.”66 Unlike Voltaire, in Emile Rousseau approaches religious liberty through a concentrated exploration of the individual conscience. This prescription for the pursuit of religious truth apart from “parents and pastors” seems clear enough, but the Savoyard Vicar soon confronts an obstacle that leads him to an entirely different place from where he (and Rousseau) began. The vicar describes his long investigation into the arguments in favor of the different religions, which depend on competing claims of absolute truth. But despite his most strenuous efforts, he is unable to come to any certain conclusion. And if the vicar, with his education and intelligence, is unable to decide, what of the common workman? In language that recalls the anxiety of Montaigne about religious pluralism, Rousseau writes that if people were to indulge themselves in a quest for certain religious truth, the result would be a social catastrophe: “Then farewell to the trades, the arts, the sciences of mankind, farewell to all the peaceful occupations; there can be no study but that of religion, even the strongest, the most industrious, the most intelligent, the oldest, will hardly be able in his last years to know where he is;\n\nf r o m t o l e r at i o n t o l i b e rt y\n\n31\n\nand it will be a wonder if he manages to find out what religion he ought to live by, before the hour of his death.”67 Religious freedom if taken seriously and pursued as a duty thus leads to social chaos, not to mention personal despair. Here, as with Montaigne, an appreciation of the value of the individual conscience runs up against the need for harmony and social order. The Savoyard Vicar’s own solution after his failed religious quest is to accept an “unwilling scepticism” that is “in no way painful to me, for it does not extend to matters of practice.”68 Speaking more generally, the vicar takes a position that is surprising, even shocking, when compared with his earlier castigation of the “heart-breaking stupidity” of priests who teach children their catechism lessons, which might contain ideas about God that are “mean, grotesque, harmful, and unworthy.”69 For the vicar now states that “I regard all individual religions as so many wholesome institutions which prescribe a uniform method by which each country may do honor to God in public worship; institutions which may each have its reason in the country, the government, the genius of the people, or in other local causes which make one preferable to another in a given time or place. I think them all good alike, when God is served in a fitting manner.”70 Moreover, since all religions are “wholesome” and “good alike” there is no reason for people to change from the one in which they were born. In fact, “to ask anyone to abandon the religion in which he was born is, I consider, to ask him to do wrong, therefore to do wrong oneself. While we await further knowledge, let us respect public order; in every country let us respect the laws, let us not disturb the form of worship prescribed by law; let us not lead its citizens into disobedience; for we have no certain knowledge that it is good for them to abandon their own opinions for others, and on the other hand we are quite certain that it is a bad thing to disobey the law.”71 As he nears the conclusion of their conversation, the vicar advises Rousseau to “go back to the religion of your fathers, and follow it in sincerity of heart, and never forsake it. . . . In our present state of uncertainty, it is an inexcusable presumption to profess any faith but that we are born into, while it is treachery not to practice honestly the faith we profess.”72 Over the course of his analysis of religious liberty in Emile Rousseau has thus come to a position that contradicts his earlier embrace of the absolute authority of the individual conscience. Religious liberty is also evoked in powerful but ambiguous terms in The Social Contract, the other famous text that Rousseau published in 1762.73 In the closing pages of the Contract Rousseau discusses in a more schematic\n\n32 f r o m t o l e r a t i o n t o l i b e r t y\n\nfashion the tension between individual conscience and public cult that he explored in depth in Emile. In his chapter on “Civil Religion” he draws a sharp contrast between “the religion of man and the religion of the citizen.” The first, “without temples, altars, or rites, [is] limited to the purely inward worship of the supreme God and to the eternal duties of morality.” The religion of the citizen, on the contrary, “has its dogmas, its rites, its outward form of worship prescribed by law.” Rousseau also describes a third form of religion, exemplified in Roman Christianity, in which both the state and the church claim the authority to prescribe laws. Rousseau dismisses this hybrid as “obviously bad” because it “breaks down social unity. . . . All institutions that place man in contradiction with himself are worthless.”74 In developing his thoughts on the religion of the state Rousseau repeats ideas found in Emile, but in sharper language that adds a punitive dimension that the Savoyard Vicar avoided. The articles of this civil religion are to be determined by the sovereign, and all are obliged to follow them, for otherwise “it is impossible to be a good citizen or a faithful subject.” Citizens who refuse to accept the civil religion are liable to banishment and death. But the passage in which Rousseau establishes the right of the sovereign to punish religious dissent is a telling illustration of the curious and convoluted way in which Rousseau thought about religious liberty: “Without being able to obligate anyone to believe [the articles of a civil religion], the sovereign can banish from the state anyone who does not believe them; it can banish him not for being impious but for being unsociable.” Despite his attempt to preserve the right of the individual conscience, Rousseau condemns citizens who at one time accepted the civil religion and then rejected it. In granting the state such coercive power, Rousseau seems to contradict prior statements that condemned state religions for making people “bloodthirsty and intolerant” and for believing that “[the state] performs a holy act in killing anyone who does not accept its gods.”75 In The Social Contract, as in Emile, Rousseau fails to reconcile his commitment to the rights of the individual conscience with those of the state, and as in Emile he ends up in a paradoxical position in which the individual can be seen as torn by a choice between faithfulness to his conscience or to his state. Rousseau’s convoluted reasoning on religious liberty, and his deference to the power of the family and the state to impose and regulate religious belief, helps explain his lack of interest in participating in the defense of toleration along the lines of Bayle or Voltaire. He took no great interest in the Calas affair and on one occasion refused the appeal of the\n\nf r o m t o l e r at i o n t o l i b e rt y\n\n33\n\nProtestant community to intervene in favor of the pastor Rochette, imprisoned for leading clandestine services and eventually hanged.76 In responding to this appeal Rousseau opposed freeing any prisoner of the state “even if he has been wrongly detained.” Any such attempt “is a . . . rebellion that cannot be justified, and those in power always have the right to punish it.”77 Emile and The Social Contract are puzzling texts in their consideration of religious liberty. On the one hand Rousseau unequivocally affirms the absolute right of the individual conscience to make a free choice of religion, advises readers that in an ideal world children should not be given a religious education, and ridicules the grotesque diversity of religious beliefs. On the other hand he insists that children ought to be raised in the different religions of the countries where they are born, stay faithful to the religions prescribed by law, and face banishment or death for becoming religious dissenters.78 Rousseau’s contending positions expose the enduring tension between individual conscience and the claims of family, church, and state. This conflict surfaces again in the confusing exchanges between Mirabeau and Rabaut de Saint-Etienne on the one hand and the abbé d’Eymar and his supporters on the other in the debates of August 22–23. The public chaos in the National Assembly over how to understand religious liberty echoes as a public manifestation of the contradictions of Rousseau. It seems inevitable that conscience and tolérance would be taken up in the Encyclopédie, the central text of the Enlightenment, edited by Diderot and d’Alembert, that began appearing in 1751. Louis de Jaucourt’s article on liberté de conscience and Jean-Edme Romilly’s on tolérance defend the rights of individual judgment and religious minorities in terms that recall arguments drawn from Bayle, whose work is cited favorably by Romilly.79 Conscience earns two entries, one by Jaucourt under the rubrics Philosophie, Logique, Métaphysique, which defines the term as the equivalent of the English “consciousness” and restricts it to the self-awareness of one’s perceptions. The second entry, by an anonymous author under the rubrics Droit naturel, Morale, defines conscience as “the judgement that each person makes with regard to his own actions, compared with the ideas that he has of the law that binds him.” But this faculty is also responsible for establishing the standard it will apply in the first place, which explains why this “interior forum” is not a stable entity, for it might at different times be “decisive, doubtful, correct, bad, probable, erroneous, irresolute, scrupulous, etc.” Individual reason is accorded an important role in the operation of conscience but is also\n\n34 f r o m t o l e r a t i o n t o l i b e r t y\n\npotentially limited by the value attached to external sources of authority. It is once again conscience that establishes how to balance these forces. Conscience is thus a fundamental source of moral judgment and personal identity but also observed by the individual who possesses it, and so is separated from as well as identified with the self.80 All of the converts I study struggled with their consciences, understood as both a source of their religious freedom and a constraint on it. In reflecting on this dilemma they were working within the rich conceptual vein inherited from the Enlightenment, trying to understand how a conscience could be, as Rousseau put it, “a sure guide for a creature ignorant and finite indeed, yet intelligent and free.”81\n\nFrom Tolérance to Liberté des Cultes In the years just before the revolution royal policy finally made a small but significant concession to the rights of religious minorities in the Edict of Versailles, issued in November 1787. Influenced by public officials, including his minister Chrétien-Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, Louis XVI declared that Protestants would now be able to register their marriages legally without going through the subterfuge of a Catholic ceremo"
