        "text": "Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake has had a troubled development journey so far. Announced back in 2020, the game’s lead developers were Ubisoft’s Pune and Mumbai studios. Later, the project was handed over from these Indian studios to Ubisoft Montreal, and while an update about its progress stated that an ‘important milestone’ has been passed, there’s hardly anything tangible that fans know about the remake.\n\nNow, a new report from Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson makes a bold claim that fans should simply “forget everything” that they have seen or heard in the reveal trailer. The report goes on to explain that the remake has been remade from the ground up again, with all development progress made so far getting scraped. This is a conflicting report to Ubisoft’s public announcement that the Montreal studio would be “building upon” the work already done by Ubisoft Mumbai and Pune.\n\nTom Henderson says that he has seen footage for the remake in its early stages and that the game is “ways off from release.” The efforts to start from scratch have resulted in graphics overhaul, new animations, combat and parkour mechanics, and more, as per Henderson who also adds that the game has been rewritten and recaptured in motion capture.\n\nThis report also claims that Yuri Lowenthal who voiced the protagonist for the original game, is not going to reprise the role, even though his voice was featured in the reveal trailer. Yuri Lowenthal is also known for voicing Peter Parker in Insomniac’s Spider-Man games.\n\nThere has been no official word from Ubisoft to suggest the same, so it is advised to take this information with a grain of salt. The company also told Insider Gaming that they “do not comment on rumours and speculation”, when asked about the report before Insider Gaming published it. Make of it what you will."
