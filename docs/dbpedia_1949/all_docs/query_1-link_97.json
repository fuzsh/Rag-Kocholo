        "text": "After being subject to numerous delays, reports suggest Ubisoft’s Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time remake has been completely reworked from the ground up.\n\nWhile the future of Ubisoft’s Prince Of Persia franchise seems relatively positive, between The Lost Crown and a rumoured upcoming roguelite, there’s a big question mark over the long-delayed remake of 2003’s The Sands Of Time.\n\nThe remake was originally announced back in 2020, to be developed by Ubisoft Mumbai and Ubisoft Pune, but it was subsequently delayed following criticism regarding the game’s graphics. In 2022, development switched hands to Ubisoft Montreal, who created the original in the PlayStation 2 era.\n\nThere’s currently no release date, but the studio tweeted last November that the project had passed ‘an important internal milestone’. However, a new report suggests the remake has been reworked entirely since then.\n\nAccording to one source, the remake has been overhauled with a more ‘realistic approach’ in comparison to the initial reveal trailer – with everything built from the ground up, including new graphics, animations, and mechanics for combat and parkour.\n\nThis is according to footage seen by Insider Gaming, who state the title is still ‘in an early stage’, with missing textures and assets – suggesting it might still be a while before it comes out.\n\nThe outlet also claims actor Yuri Lowenthal, who voiced The Prince in the original game, will no longer reprise his role – despite doing so in the remake’s trailer (and discussing his involvement in a blog post). No reason is given as to why.\n\nWhile an overhaul might be good news if true, the push for a ‘realistic approach’ is perhaps a cause for concern – especially as the original Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time stands out because of its lighter, swashbuckling tone.\n\nThe report also suggests Ubisoft is planning to give a more ‘prominent update’ on the remake soon, so it’s possible we could hear more at the Ubisoft Forward presentation on June 10.\n\nPrince Of Persia: The Lost Crown, meanwhile, is set to receive new story DLC in the next few months, along with additional combat and puzzle challenges.\n\nEmail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, follow us on Twitter, and sign-up to our newsletter.\n\nMORE : Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown interview – ‘timing is music’\n\nMORE : Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown is really great – as long as no one’s talking\n\nMORE : Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown is a 2D Metroidvania where you don’t play as the Prince\n\nFollow Metro Gaming on Twitter and email us at gamecentral@metro.co.uk\n\nTo submit Inbox letters and Reader’s Features more easily, without the need to send an email, just use our Submit Stuff page here.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our Gaming page."
