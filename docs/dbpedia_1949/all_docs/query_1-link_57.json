        "text": "There had been more than a decade of anticipation for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown when its debut trailer was unveiled last year. Fans hoped the first major installment in the video game series since 2010’s Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands would be another lavish 3-D adventure, with state-of-the-art graphics and boundary-pushing sword-and-sandals action.\n\nMounir Radi, the director of The Lost Crown, had carefully chosen a propulsive, high-energy rap song written and recorded for the trailer by Joznez, 2WEI and Kataem. It was perhaps an odd choice for a high-fantasy swashbuckler set in ancient Persia. But Radi, who works for the French game developer Ubisoft Montpellier, felt it struck the right note of startling energy.\n\n“I wanted to come in, bam bam, with a big surprise,” he said."
