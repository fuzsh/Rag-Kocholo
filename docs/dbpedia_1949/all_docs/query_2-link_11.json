        "text": "Old notebooks\n\nI started keeping a journal my freshman year in college, and kept the habit for years afterward. I'm still not sure whether it was a good habit or a bad one. A few months ago, when I sat down to write an afterword for the Prince of Persia graphic novel, I pulled out those old notebooks and started to browse through them, figuring it might help me wrap my mind around Prince of Persia's 20-year history.\n\nIt's all there. The story of how Prince of Persia came to be, and almost didn't. It occurred to me that as a case history, a time-capsule view of the videogame industry as it was in the 1980s, this was a story others might find interesting too.\n\nSo even though the last thing I need is another hobby — especially one that involves spending more time at the keyboard — I've begun posting those old journal entries, a kind of blog from the past, starting in 1985. Check out the \"Old Journals\" and let me know what you think. If enough people are interested, I'll keep posting — ideally, at least through the end of 1989, when... well, you'll find out.\n\nThe entries are selected and abridged — most of what I had on my mind at age 21, you don't want to hear about — but on principle, I've let things stand as I wrote them, and avoided the temptation to revise with hindsight.\n\nDate Published: 2008-10-02 00:01:31\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Old School\n\nComments (...)\n\nMy first day on Prince of Persia set\n\nHere's a page I started on the midnight flight from Casablanca to Ouarzazate and finished the next morning when I arrived on set.\n\nWhat the drawing doesn't show is that it reached 125 degrees that day (52 Celsius).\n\nDate Published: 2008-10-02 12:56:26\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Film, Prince of Persia, Sketchbook\n\nComments (...)\n\nWriting a video game\n\nThe Sands of Time: Crafting A Video Game Story, an essay I wrote a couple of years ago for MIT Press, is now available online. If you're curious about the nuts and bolts of video game writing — and how it's different from screenwriting — check it out.\n\nDate Published: 2008-10-04 23:16:53\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Games, Making Games, Prince of Persia\n\nComments (...)\n\nSketchbooks\n\nAs a kid I was pretty good at drawing... until I got my first Apple II computer. After that, I did the occasional scribble-sketch, but my level of skill basically remained frozen for the next 30 years. When you stop drawing, you get rusty very fast.\n\nOver three decades of writing, programming, and other left-brain activities, I pretty much forgot that I'd ever known how to draw.\n\nUntil ten months ago. It was in Paris, a city where unexpected things often happen to me. The first day after flying in from California is always a bit surreal anyway; you force yourself to stay up and walk around in the bright daylight, even though your body wants to be asleep and dreaming. On that day, to stay awake I went to the Jewish Museum in the Marais. They had an exhibit called \"From Superman to The Rabbi's Cat\" about the history of comics.\n\nAs I prowled the museum, it gradually became intolerable to me that I had gotten to a point in my life where I could no longer express myself through drawing. I don't know if it was the comics or the Holocaust memorabilia that tore it, but the next morning I bought a sketchbook and a pen and started drawing people in the street, in cafés, at train stations. That was last December. I've gone through three notebooks since then.\n\nNow, I'm addicted. These days, when I'm in an airport and my flight is delayed, I hardly mind, because it's a chance to draw. I love drawing even when the drawings don't come out right. It's a trance state, like playing music or skiing: Even when it's bad, it's good.\n\nDate Published: 2008-10-22 15:56:30\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Sketchbook\n\nComments (...)\n\nPrince of Persia and Persia\n\nReader Masoud Shoushtarian asks about the Prince of Persia movie:\n\ndo know about persian culture and persian civilization?\n\nwhy do you make this movie without iranian actor or actress?\n\nwhy don't you make this movie in iran?\n\nThe story and screenplay for Prince of Persia were inspired by many sources, especially the tales of the 1001 Nights and Ferdowsi's Shahnameh (Book of Kings). In doing the research I read pretty widely, including the lives and writings of Omar Khayyam, Rumi, and Ibn Battuta, and modern histories such as Frye's The Golden Age of Persia, but my goal was to create an entertaining fantasy in the spirit of the 1001 Nights.\n\nIn my afterword for the Prince of Persia graphic novel (which was written by an Iranian author, A.B. Sina) I talk a bit more about the origins of Prince of Persia and its connection to Iranian history and legend. The graphic novel site also has an interview with A.B. offering some of his thoughts on the subject.\n\nThe movie casting and location decisions weren't mine to make, but the choice to shoot in Morocco and the UK was certainly based on practical considerations including availability of locations and production facilities. For similar reasons, Kingdom of Heaven, Black Hawk Down, and Asterix and Obelix Meet Cleopatra were also shot in Morocco, although those stories take place in Jerusalem, Somalia and Egypt respectively.\n\nDate Published: 2008-10-27 11:57:51\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Comics, Film, Games, Prince of Persia\n\nComments (...)\n\nOld journals, continued\n\nJust posted a new batch of old journal entries, bringing us up to September 1986.\n\nMany thanks to all the readers who have written in to comment on the old journals. The October 1985 animation reference video seems to be especially popular.\n\nSo OK, the die is cast... I'll continue this \"blog from the past\" so you can follow the development of Apple II POP (and related matters) in all its gory details. True diehards can subscribe to the old-journals RSS feed here. And yes, there will be more videos to come!\n\nDate Published: 2008-10-29 10:58:55\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Old School\n\nComments (...)\n\nAn Albanian motorway\n\nThis tunnel is part of a highway being built through a mountainous region of northern Albania, connecting the Adriatic port of Durres to southern Kosovo.\n\nI showed my sketch to a Turkish engineer who'd been watching me draw. He studied it briefly, then shook his head and handed it back to me with one comment: \"You drew that pipe crooked, but in reality, it is straight.\"\n\nI couldn't help thinking it would have been a great setting for an episode of Ops.\n\nDate Published: 2008-11-06 16:48:28\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Sketchbook\n\nComments (...)\n\nLittle Big Planet\n\n...is beyond amazing.

The Pinewood studios, originally built in the 1930's, still feel very much of that era, at least to my L.A.-accustomed eyes. The contrast between the dilapidated physical infrastructure, and the state-of-the-art technology being used inside the stages, is striking.\n\nWhereas the state-of-the-art technology we used to make The Last Express is now as quaint and dated as the 1914-era steam locomotives that were still in service when the Pinewood stages were built.\n\nPinewood is in an industrial park west of London.

He needed a name.\n\nI found it in this passage from Ferdowsi's Shahnameh (the Persian Book of Kings):\n\n[The Simorgh] went to the youth and said, \"O brave young man, until today I have brought you up as if I were your nurse, and I have taught you speech and the ways of virtue. Now it is time for you to return to your own birthplace. Your father has come searching for you. I have named you Dastan (The Trickster) and from now on you will be known by this name.\"\n\nDespite what the Simorgh says, the new name doesn't stick; everyone goes back to calling him by his real name, Zal. But Dastan seemed like the perfect name for my prince (especially since Zal wasn't using it). So I borrowed it.\n\nThe Trickster has been a popular heroic archetype for thousands of years (Joseph Campbell called him the \"Hero with a Thousand Faces\"). From his first incarnation as an Apple II sprite, the prince has run, jumped and scrambled firmly in the footsteps of other well-known Tricksters like Robin Hood, Zorro, Han Solo, Indiana Jones, and (of course) the Man with No Name.\n\nAs it turns out, the word dastan has shadings I wasn't aware of — shadings that make it an even more appropriate name for the prince than I realized.\n\nFirst, several people (including Jake Gyllenhaal the first day we met) have pointed out to me that Dastan is also a Persian word meaning \"story.\" And so it is, although the vowel is pronounced differently. According to wikipedia, a Dastan is a type of Central Asian oral history \"centered on one individual who protects his tribe or his people from an outside invader/enemy.\" Hey, just like every video game.\n\nThen, I came across this fascinating article by Dick Davis (the translator of the English edition of the Shahnameh I quoted above). He's discussing the qualities of the Trickster Hero as they pertain to Rostam, Persia's greatest epic hero (think Hercules, Siegfried, etc), who is way more famous than Zal or Dastan. It's a great example of the kind of nuances that get lost in translation:\n\nThere is also the curious nature of his name to be taken into account. He is often referred to as \"Rostam-e Dastan,\" which can have two different meanings. One, \"Rostam the son of Dastan,\" is the meaning the poem foregrounds, and his father, Zal, is seen as having somewhere along the line acquired a second name, Dastan. But the phrase can also mean \"Rostam who possesses the quality of dastan\", and the word \"dastan\" means \"trickery.\" This, I believe, was the original meaning of the phrase \"Rostam-e Dastan\" (probably long before the Shahnameh was written, while the stories of Rostam still had a solely oral existence), i.e. \"Rostam the trickster\", the equivalent of Homer's \"Odysseus of many wiles\", and only later did the word dastan come to be identified as the name of his father (after all, his father already had a name, Zal).\n\nThe prince in Sands of Time (the video game) at one point wishes aloud that he had the strength of Rostam so that he could smash through a certain wall. I figured a seventh-century Persian prince would have grown up hearing those tales and would use them as a point of reference.\n\nNow he's got a name of his own.\n\nDate Published: 2009-03-02 18:05:19\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Film, Games, Prince of Persia\n\nComments (...)\n\nFathom\n\nIt's official: I'm writing a film adaptation of Fathom, the comic book series created by the late, great Michael Turner. Megan Fox is attached to star.\n\nThe first time I read the book about ten years ago, my immediate reaction was \"I wish I'd thought of that!\" (It's about a young girl who discovers that she belongs to an ocean-dwelling race that has existed secretly alongside humans for thousands of years.)\n\nAt that time, the film rights were with James Cameron's company, they already had a writer, and Ubisoft and I were in early discussions about the project that would become Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. So I put Fathom out of my mind... for ten years.\n\nLast October, out of the blue, I got a call from Fox Atomic saying they were starting over with Fathom and would I be interested in writing the screenplay? Were they kidding? I pitched my take to Fox execs Zak Kadison and Eric Lieb and producers Peter Safran, Steve Bessen, Brian Austin Green, and Frank Mastromauro. They liked it, so I got to pitch it again to a slightly larger group including Megan and studio head Debbie Liebling. (If that sounds like an intimidating roomful of people, it kind of is.)\n\nNow the news is out, and I'm incredibly stoked. Megan is a Michael Turner fan from way back and was instrumental in making this project happen. She's perfectly cast as Aspen Matthews.\n\nWatch this space for updates. It may take a while till the next one, though. I need to go write now.\n\nDate Published: 2009-03-04 10:26:28\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Comics, Fathom Film\n\nComments (...)\n\nThe Last Express Remixed\n\nA couple of years ago, for a fun weekend project, I captured a dozen hours of gameplay footage from my 1997 adventure game The Last Express and edited it down into a single, 75-minute linear narrative.\n\nOther than a walk down memory lane, I'm not sure what it's good for. It doesn't work as a movie — the demands of game vs. film storytelling are too different — and the low-res, dissolve-between-still-frames animation looks awfully clunky now. But for anyone who's interested, here it is (in eight 10-minute segments).\n\nSpoiler alert: If you haven't played the game, Part 8 gives away the ending.\n\nParts 2-8 are available here.\n\nDate Published: 2009-03-07 21:16:57\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Film, Games, Last Express\n\nComments (...)\n\nThe birth of Indiana Jones\n\nJohn August and Mystery Man have already posted about this priceless document: a 125-page typed transcript of a series of 1978 meetings between producer George Lucas, director Steven Spielberg, and screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan in which they figure out the story line of their next movie, about an archaeologist hero named \"Indiana Smith,\" so that Kasdan can go off and write it.\n\nDiscovering this transcript has made my week (and it's only Monday). I recommend it not just to screenwriters but to anyone interested in the process that goes into creating an iconic hero. Reading it, witnessing the characters, scenes and plot points of a familiar masterpiece emerge in real time from the mass of alternative possibilities, gave me chills. I couldn't help thinking of Michelangelo's apocryphal advice to \"take a block of marble and chip away everything that doesn't look like a Pieta.\"\n\nThe classic Well of Souls snakepit scene, for example, is first envisioned as a flood, and evolves from there:\n\nG [Lucas] — And then all the water rushes through?\n\nS [Spielberg] — And he swims out with the water. It's a waterfall.\n\nG — The only problem with the water is it's going to be hard to do, and it's going to be hard to rationalize it. We can't. We can call it the temple of life and establish that it has a lot of water in it. But, at the same time, it's like the sand. Plus it's such a classic thing.\n\nS — What about snakes? All these snakes come out.\n\nG — People hate snakes. Possibly when he gets down there in the first place.\n\nL [Kasdan] — Asps? They're too small.\n\nS — It's like hundreds of thousands of snakes.\n\nAs they discuss \"the girl,\" it's fascinating to see what could have been a stock character take shape into one that sets the bar, not only for all later Indiana Jones movies, but pretty much for action-adventure blockbusters in general for the next thirty years. Some of Marion's best scenes arise from their struggle to logically justify her presence (or absence) in certain setpieces:\n\nG — We have to figure out a reason for them to take the girl at this point. Before I had it because she was a double agent.\n\nL — Maybe here is where we can save the other thing. The Frenchman wants her, even though she's not receptive to it. We can do that in a scene when he comes in to question her. Say he's the Claude Rains character, it makes sense that he's attracted to Barbara Stanwyck. The German says it's time to get rid of her, the French guy says no.\n\nG — The big thing with these movies is the damsel is going to get screwed by the bad guy. What we do is, in the interrogation scene the Frenchman is in love with her, coming on to her. The German torture guy could care less: \"Get out of my way.\" When they push her down into the snake pit, it's the German guy who does it, and the Frenchman is very upset about it. \"The girl was mine.\" \"She's a waste of time, and we don't need her.\"\n\nThen there are moments like this:\n\nL — How do you see this guy?\n\nG — Someone like Harrison Ford, Paul LeMat. A young Steve McQueen. It would be ideal if we could find some stunt man who could act.\n\nS — Burt Reynolds. Baryshnikov.\n\nFor great commentary and more excerpts, check out Mystery Man's and John's posts. MM's comments section offers various possible links to the full transcript in .pdf and html.\n\nI have no idea how this got on the internet, and I hope Lucas, Spielberg et al don't mind... but I'm really glad.\n\nI saw Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time the summer I graduated from high school, on a giant screen in Leicester Square in London. I still remember the excitement of that packed theater. To state the obvious, Raiders was the inspiration and template for Prince of Persia... the original 1989 Apple II game, as well as what came after.\n\nDate Published: 2009-03-10 23:25:03\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Film\n\nComments (...)\n\nPrince of Persia movie sketchbook\n\nHere are some sketches I made on the Prince of Persia set in Morocco.\n\nIndia is the assistant script supervisor.

A spectacular setup with about 350 extras, horses, camels and goats lined up on a ridge. That afternoon a sandstorm rose up suddenly, prompting the decision to wrap early.\n\nA huge exodus of cars, trucks, animals and extras ensued. I had the bright idea of walking the five minutes back to base camp along with the extras, instead of getting a ride, so I could take pictures of the exodus. This was how I found out that (a) a five-minute walk in a full-on sandstorm takes a lot longer than five minutes, and (b) it only takes about thirty seconds for a camera to get so full of sand that its moving parts won't move any more.\n\nWhen I got to the air-conditioned sanctuary of Mike Stenson's trailer, he remarked: \"You're a different color than when I saw you last.\"\n\nThen it rained.\n\nDate Published: 2009-04-30 22:32:08\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Film, Prince of Persia, Sketchbook\n\nComments (...)\n\nParis in springtime\n\nI've been experimenting with those watercolor pencils.

Originally, I'd planned to end the feature here — in October 1989, with the release of Apple II Prince of Persia, four years in the making.\n\nNow that we've reached that milestone, though, I realize that no self-respecting storyteller would end at such a critical moment, with my worst fears about the game's commercial prospects soon to be horribly confirmed. So I'll let my 20-years-younger self keep on blogging from the past a while longer.\n\nMeanwhile, here are answers to some nostalgia-oriented readers' questions — this one from Ugur Mengilli:\n\nIn which programming language was PoP written?\n\nFrom Nabil Nawaz:\n\nWhat language did you program Karateka in? How long did it take to code the game?\n\nI coded both Karateka and POP in 6502 assembly language. Looks like this:\n\nCLRMEM LDA #$00 ;Set up zero value\n\nTAY ;Initialize index pointer\n\nCLRM1 STA (TOPNT),Y ;Clear memory location\n\nINY ;Advance index pointer\n\nDEX ;Decrement counter\n\nBNE CLRM1 ;Not zero, continue checking\n\nRTS ;Return\n\nKarateka took me about two years and POP four. Both were significantly slowed down by other things I was attempting at the same time (like finishing college, and writing my first screenplay), as the old journals show.\n\nFor true die-hards (thanks, Maurice Kaltofen, for tipping me off to the existence of this site), and anyone who's interested, I've posted the POP source code documentation here.\n\nFrom Sam Assenberg:\n\nI am Sam and I still play the original Prince of Persia almost every day. I'm a big fan of you and Prince of Persia!\n\nSoon, Prince of Persia exists 20 year and we, my uncle and I, are planning a Prince of Persia anniversary! He played it during a few years after it had been released and I started to play when I was about seven years old, almost nine years ago. We love it very much.\n\nWe've searched all over the web for the exact release date of PoP (we need that for the anniversary), but we couldn't find it. And that's our question for you: when has PoP been released exactly?\n\nI had to check the old journals myself to find the answer. The first Apple II version was published in the U.S. on October 3, 1989. So, still six months away. Thanks, Sam and your uncle, for reminding me!\n\nIf you'd like to read the old journals from the beginning, they start here.\n\nDate Published: 2009-05-03 11:37:21\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Games, Making Games, Old School, Prince of Persia\n\nComments (...)\n\nGetting Adults to Draw\n\nThis NPR interview with Mo Willems really struck a chord with me.

The same thing should apply to cartooning.\"\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I started carrying around a notebook and sketching what I saw.

He dares to ask: Why do today's video games (and the movies based on them) tend so relentlessly toward the epic, at the expense of other kinds of stories?\n\nIs it because games are often played as power fantasies? Is it because, when the default progression mechanic in most games is combat, grand conflict and badassery just make the most sense?\n\nIt's a good question. I saw Star Trek last week at the Arclight Hollywood with friends whose movie tastes run more towards art-house fare. (I loved it, they didn't.) After the first three trailers (Transformers, Terminator, and GI Joe), my friend leaned over to me in some perplexity and said: \"I feel like I've just seen the same trailer three times in a row.\"\n\nCoincidentally, Terry Gilliam made much the same remark in today's LA Times:\n\nTerry Gilliam went to the movies the other night, and this is what he saw. \"Trailers from 'Transformers,' ' G.I. Joe,' ' Harry Potter'; they all had the same explosions, the same sound mix, the same rhythms, it was all the same film,\" the director says, still not quite believing it. \" Hollywood's been doing this for 20 years. When's it going to end?\"\n\n[Small world: Gilliam's new film, The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus, was edited by Mick Audsley, who is also one of the editors of the POP movie.]\n\nKurosawa once said that he made movies for people in their twenties. For me, that's the key. Epics are the kind of movies I loved most when I was in my teens and early twenties. I liked other kinds of movies too, but I lived for epics. Movies (and video games) mattered more to me at that time in my life than they ever have since. This being a business, it's fair to note that I spent a far greater proportion of my time and disposable income consuming them than I do now. So in a way, I'm still making movies and games for my 20-year-old self.\n\nThese days, when I go to the movies (or the Xbox), be it Star Trek, Bioshock or whatever, what holds my interest most are the small, quirky, human moments that somehow transcend the familiar epic framework, make it come alive one more time. They're getting harder to find.\n\nDate Published: 2009-05-22 15:12:22\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Film, Games\n\nComments (...)\n\nThe first five years of Old Journals have now been posted, covering the development and first release of Prince of Persia.

The invitation included spending a night at the Skywalker Ranch — the stuff of dreams, for me.\n\nI'd been to the ranch once before, in 1987. I was two years out of college, stalled halfway through the first Apple II version of Prince of Persia, and torn between pursuing a career in computer games or screenwriting. In fact, the old Broderbund Software building where I programmed POP is just down the road from the Skywalker Ranch (a long, winding, scenic road, often foggy and frequented by deer). So being invited back to tell Lucasfilm staff the story of POP's 20-year journey — from 8-bit computer game to summer movie — felt pretty cosmic.\n\nEspecially considering that it all goes back to the first ten minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nBoth the Skywalker Ranch and the Presidio campus are seriously nice places — in idyllic natural settings, with a level of luxury and attention to detail rarely found in movie or videogame studios. And filled with sacred artifacts like the Original Millenium Falcon.\n\nI got a tour and a sneak peek at some of the cool stuff the LucasArts guys have been working on, at least one of which I'm pretty sure I can mention without violating the NDA I signed along with the retinal scan.\n\nThanks, Lucasfilm, for a great and memorable visit.\n\nDate Published: 2009-07-11 17:29:21\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog encounters, Film, Games, Prince of Persia, Sketchbook, travel\n\nComments (...)\n\nSketchcrawling in LA\n\nMy friend Alex Puvilland tipped me off to the 23rd International Sketchcrawl happening today in many cities around the world, including L.A. Basically, the idea is for a bunch of people to get together and spend the day sketching what they see, and post the results.\n\nSo I made my way down to Echo Park to brave the summer heat with a dozen or so like-minded souls. I'm looking forward to seeing their sketches. Here are some of mine:\n\nView from Angelus Temple steps:\n\nFellow sketchcrawlers:\n\nNot too surprisingly, most everyone I met today is planning to attend San Diego Comic-Con in two weeks.\n\nDate Published: 2009-07-11 18:20:19\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Sketchbook\n\nComments (...)\n\nPrince of Persia panel at Comic-Con\n\nI'll be in San Diego next Friday for an 11:30 am Q&A panel about the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time graphic novel anthology I'm writing for Disney, with artists Todd McFarlane, Cameron Stewart, Bernard Chang, Tommy Lee Edwards, Josh Middleton, and Niko Henrichon, many of whom will be on the panel as well. (Check the Comic-Con schedule for updated details.)\n\nIt's been a very cool project and one I've had a lot of fun doing. The book is a prequel to the movie (I use the word \"prequel\" advisedly, for those who think time is like a river that flows swift and sure in one direction), with each chapter drawn by a different artist in a different style. It'll be published next April as part of the Prince of Persia movie pre-launch.\n\nThis is the second Prince of Persia graphic novel I've been involved with — the first, written by A.B. Sina and illustrated by LeUyen Pham and Alex Puvilland, was published last year by First Second Books — and they're very different projects. Whereas the First Second book is deliberately separate from the games and movie — linked thematically, rather than through plot and characters — the Disney book is firmly in the universe of the movie. It offered a chance to establish, and expand on, the characters' world and back stories beyond what's in the film.\n\nMost enjoyably, it's given me an opportunity to revisit the story and characters of the original game for the first time in two decades — though in a way that's kind of hard to explain, until you read the book.\n\nHope to see you next Friday, those of you who can make it!\n\nDate Published: 2009-07-14 19:41:07\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Comics, Film, Prince of Persia\n\nComments (...)\n\nFirst POP movie poster comps\n\n(Updated with latest versions.)\n\nDate Published: 2009-07-20 18:09:29\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Film, Prince of Persia\n\nComments (...)\n\nComic-Con sketchbook\n\nDate Published: 2009-07-24 16:45:58\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Comics, Film, Sketchbook\n\nComments (...)\n\nThe wilderness of childhood\n\nThis essay by Michael Chabon is so true, I just had to link to it.\n\nDate Published: 2009-07-26 19:12:22\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog\n\nComments (...)\n\nUnfinished Last Express Prequel\n\nBrowsing through my storage room in an attempt to avoid working on my current project, I stumbled across this printout of an unfinished screenplay (PDF) I'd started, then abandoned, back in 2002.\n\nEntitled \"Red Serpent,\" and set in 1904 Paris, ten years before the events of The Last Express, it would have been an early adventure of Robert Cath (still in medical school) and his best/worst friend Tyler Whitney (upgraded in this version to Cath's half-brother — a change I don't think I'd make today).\n\nThe plot bears a more-than-slight resemblance to The Da Vinci Code, which would be published the following year. No plagiarism was involved. I'd guess that Dan Brown and I had been reading the same pseudo-historical \"research,\" including Holy Blood, Holy Grail by Baigent and Leigh (who did, in fact, sue Brown for plagiarism, and lost). Whereas Brown treated their theory seriously, my approach was more tongue-in-cheek.\n\nI've posted it here (PDF) in case it interests anyone — as a glimpse into the early, rough-first-draft stages of the creative process. Mostly, the stories we read are ones that survive all the way to completion. This one, for many reasons, didn't.\n\nRereading the screenplay fragment today, I can see why I abandoned it. There are things in it that I like, but it's not really of a piece with The Last Express. It's more fluffy and lightweight. It can't quite decide whether it wants to be a movie in the Indiana Jones/Da Vinci Code spirit, or a spoof of that kind of movie. And, while I enjoyed the two main characters, I can't quite see them growing up to be Cath and Tyler as Tomi Pierce and I originally conceived them.\n\nAlso, in 2002, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (the game) was gearing up production at Ubisoft Montreal, and my excitement for that project was growing while my sense of conviction on this one was dwindling. Ultimately, I dropped \"Red Serpent\" to give me more time for POP. It was the right decision.\n\nDate Published: 2009-08-12 11:39:59\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Film, Last Express\n\nComments (...)\n\nGamasutra analyzes Last Express\n\nA thoughtful article by Tom Cross on Gamasutra about The Last Express and immersive game worlds:\n\nRead the article at Gamasutra.com\n\nDate Published: 2009-09-03 06:54:53\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Games, Last Express, last express, nostalgia, review\n\nComments (...)\n\nSpeaking at GDC China\n\nI'll be giving a keynote at the Game Developers Conference in Shanghai.

My friend Alex Puvilland gave me my notebook number two, a Moleskine sketchbook, which is the kind I've used ever since. I've filled seven of them.\n\nMoleskines are kind of the iPhone of sketchbooks: They're ubiquitous, pricey, and their marketing is so blatantly geared toward making you feel like possessing one will make you a cooler person that I feel a vague sense of embarrassment at having succumbed. But I keep on using them anyway, because they're just so well designed.\n\nNifty features: The pocket in the back is just right for holding airplane boarding passes and scraps of paper you don't want to lose. The binding doesn't fall apart no matter how much you kick it around. And there's a ribbon to mark your place.\n\nThe paper is really thick. At first, I found it almost intimidating (as if it required a worthier drawing than just a casual scribble), but I got over that. It's thick enough that I can draw on both sides without it showing through, which makes the book last twice as long.\n\nIt's not good for watercolor; the paper is so smooth that the water just beads up and rolls off the surface. It will accept an India ink wash, like this sketch I did in Union Square. Watercolor pencils also seem to work OK.\n\nMoleskine does make a watercolor notebook; I used one for these watercolor sketches, but I haven't really gotten comfortable with it.\n\nThe pen I use most often is a Staedtler pigment liner, black, 0.3 nib. It's not perfect, but it's waterproof, and cheap enough that I can buy them by the dozen and always have an extra handy when I lose one (or when the cap gets lost, which happens a lot, as it tends to fall off when I stick it on the back end). I'm still looking for the perfect pen. I'd also love to find a brush pen that uses indelible India ink cartridges, but can't seem to find one. Suggestions welcome.\n\nDate Published: 2009-10-08 15:13:01\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Sketchbook\n\nComments (...)\n\nPrince of Persia movie pitch trailer\n\nIn my GDC China keynote about Prince of Persia's 20-year journey from game to film, I showed a 2-minute trailer I made six years ago to pitch the movie to Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney execs. I'm posting it here for those who are interested.\n\nWhy did I cut a new trailer, instead of using one of the existing game trailers Ubisoft had already produced to market the Sands of Time game? Because the game marketing trailers were very specific about certain story points that weren't in the movie (freeze, fast-forward, sand monsters, visions). Co-producer John August and I didn't want to confuse the execs by showing them a different story from the one we were pitching.\n\nIt took me a week to cut on Final Cut Express, in late 2003. Assembling a trailer from existing PS2 game footage was an editing challenge, because key scenes, locations and characters from the movie didn't exist. So rather than attempt to explicitly tell the story of the movie in the trailer, I set out to convey the kind of movie it would be. (Don't worry, there are no spoilers — the trailer reveals nothing about the plot of the movie beyond what's in the game.)\n\nThe sound mix is rough — I didn't have the proper elements or the time to do a professional-quality mix — but it served its purpose of selling the pitch. Hope you enjoy it.\n\nDate Published: 2009-10-11 21:29:57\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Film, Games, Prince of Persia\n\nComments (...)\n\nDefending the Sands of Time\n\nAfter I spoke at GDC in Shanghai yesterday morning, Gamasutra posted a summary of my keynote. Their report was very good and accurate, but I want to clarify a comment that set off alarms with some Sands of Time game fans:\n\nFilm and games, though they have similarities, have important differences as well, says Mechner. \"There's no button on the controller for sit down with someone and have a nice conversation... The game story was just an excuse for getting the player to get from point A to point B and kill everybody he meets.\" It is not, in his words, \"this epic, romantic action movie that [the film version of] Prince of Persia was setting out to be.\"\n\nThis sounds like I'm saying the Sands of Time game story is somehow less ambitious or less fully realized than the film story. That definitely wasn't my intention.\n\nJust because a game story is designed to support and enhance a particular game play mechanic (which, in the case of Sands of Time, does indeed consist largely of getting from point A to point B in various challenging, acrobatic ways, while killing sand monsters along the way) does not mean that it can't be every bit as sophisticated and nuanced in terms of dialog, character development, emotional and thematic resonance, literary qualities, etc., as a movie story. Indeed, the Sands of Time video game achieves some narrative effects that are beyond the scope of film, or at least beyond the scope of a 110-minute action-adventure movie: for example, the counterpoint, sometimes emotional, sometimes ironic, between the voice-over narration, the onscreen banter between the Prince and Farah, and the Prince's actions under the player's control.\n\nThe 2003 Sands of Time game doesn't need me to defend it, but I hope this post helps clear up any misunderstanding.\n\nDate Published: 2009-10-13 17:53:16\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Film, Games, Prince of Persia\n\nComments (...)\n\nConversation with Eric Chahi\n\nI've met Eric Chahi (creator of Another World) twice: in Paris in 1992, and a couple of years later in San Francisco, where the Smoking Car team and I were toiling away on The Last Express, while Eric and his Amazing Studios were deep in the throes of finishing Heart of Darkness — both passion projects that had gone over schedule and budget, an ocean apart, exacting a psychic and financial toll for which the experiences of making Prince of Persia and Another World had only partly prepared us.\n\nI remember looking at Eric's tired face and thinking: He looks the way I feel.\n\nRecently, Mark Siegel, my editor at First Second Books, asked me if by chance I had Eric's contact info. I hadn't spoken to Eric in a dozen years (though the original Another World poster he signed for me is hanging in my office), so I asked my friend Eric Viennot.\n\nThat email sparked Eric to suggest a joint interview, which, after much patience and persistence on his part, he's now posted on his blog. Here it is, for those who read French.\n\nUpdate: An English translation (non-Babelfish) has been posted on Gamasutra.\n\nDate Published: 2009-10-14 12:17:38\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog encounters, Games, Making Games, making of Old School\n\nComments (...)\n\nShanghai sketchbook\n\nFrom my last day in Shanghai:\n\nThis is my new favorite skyscraper, the Jin Mao Tower.

Time is an ocean in a storm.\n\nIf you're curious to know how the Prince's journey began, back in those halcyon days when computers looked like this, it's all in the Old Journals.

Accept no substitutes. The hi-def version looks better.\n\nI got to see the trailer in a movie theater for the first time last week in San Francisco and L.A., when producer Jerry Bruckheimer and I did Q&As with journalists. It was quite a thrill seeing it on a big screen with a theater full of people.\n\nThere's actually one line of dialog in the movie trailer that's also in the homemade game-footage trailer John August and I used to pitch the project to Jerry and Disney six years ago. Which is funny, because the line's not actually in the movie (at least I don't think it is).

Here's what I gave them.\n\nReading it today, some of it feels dated (like the way I refer to the player throughout as \"he\"), but a lot is as relevant as ever. I especially like #8 and #9.\n\nThe story is what the player does, not what he watches.\n\nList the actions the player actually performs in the game and take a cold hard look at it. Does it sound like fun? (Resist the temptation to embellish. If a cinematic shows the player's character sneak into a compound, clobber a guard and put on his uniform, the player's action is \"Watch cinematic.\" Letting the player click to clobber the guard isn't much better.)\n\nThe only significant actions are those that affect the player's ability to perform future actions. Everything else is bells and whistles.\n\nDesign a clear and simple interface. The primary task of the interface is to present the player with a choice of the available actions at each moment and to provide instant feedback when the player makes a choice.\n\nThe player needs a goal at all times, even if it's a mistaken one. If there's nothing specific he wishes to accomplish, he will soon get bored, even if the game is rich with graphics and sound.\n\nThe more the player feels that the events of the game are being caused by his own actions, the better — even when this is an illusion.\n\nAnalyze the events of the story in terms of their effect on the player's goals. For each event, ask: Does this move the player closer to or further away from a goal, or give him a new goal? If not, it's irrelevant to the game.\n\nThe longer the player plays without a break, the more his sense of the reality of the world is built up. Any time he dies or has to restart from a saved game, the spell is broken.\n\nAlternative paths, recoverable errors, multiple solutions to the same problem, missed opportunities that can be made up later, are all good.\n\nDon't introduce gratuitous obstacles just to create a puzzle.\n\nAs the player moves through the game, he should have the feeling that he is passing up potentially interesting avenues of exploration. The ideal outcome is for him to win the game having done 95% of what there is to do, but feeling that there might be another 50% he missed.\n\nDate Published: 2009-11-08 23:35:49\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Games, Making Games\n\nComments (...)\n\nThe real Dagger of Time\n\nSketchbook pages from my first day on the Prince of Persia set in Morocco, last summer:\n\nJake offered to hold the Dagger of Time so I could sketch it. The one drawing you'd figure I could do in my sleep. Naturally, under pressure (we were between takes), I rushed it, and messed up the proportions.\n\nI asked him to hand me the dagger for a moment, thinking I might just turn back time and try that sketch again. Alas, it was empty. He must have used up the sand doing stunt work with 2nd unit.\n\nIt felt good to hold it, though.

But there were gaps in the song lyrics.\n\nSo I took the Manhattan white pages directory from my parents' bedroom and looked up E.Y. Harburg, whose name I'd seen in the credits. Our conversation went something like this:\n\nYH: Hello?\n\nMe: Hello. Is this E.Y. Harburg?\n\nYH: Yes...?\n\nMe: Did you write the lyrics for The Wizard of Oz?\n\nYH: Yes, I did.\n\nMe: Can you tell me the first line of the Cowardly Lion's song, because I didn't understand it.\n\nYH: \"It's sad, believe me, Missy / When you're born to be a sissy / Without the vim and verve / But I could show my prowess / Be a lion, not a mowess / If I only had the nerve.\"\n\nMe: OK. Also, what does the Tin Woodman sing after \"I hear a beat, how sweet...\"\n\nYH: \"Just to register emotion / Jealousy, devotion / And really feel the part / Just because I'm presumin' / That I could be kind of human / If I only had a heart.\"\n\nI got what I needed, thanked him, and hung up.\n\nIn retrospect, from an adult perspective, it does sort of make sense that a Broadway lyricist who'd been blacklisted by Hollywood would, in his 70s, be living in an apartment in Manhattan and answering his own phone in the middle of the afternoon. At the time, being a kid, I just took it for granted.

I wanted to share this sad news with readers of this site, who may know her thanks to her role in the creation of Prince of Persia (documented in the Old Journals) and as co-writer of The Last Express.\n\nThe obituary below doesn't begin to scratch the surface of what her friendship, good and wise advice, and creative genius have meant to me for the past 25 years. I wish I had a dagger of time that could have given me even a little bit more time with her.\n\nIN MEMORIAM\n\nTOMI PIERCE (1953-2010)\n\nTomi Pierce died on Monday, bowing finally to the ravages of ALS.\n\nThere can be few worse diagnoses — an inexorable, untreatable neurodegenerative disease — and for Tomi, just 54 when she was diagnosed and with so much to look forward to, it was especially brutal, especially unfair. Tomi certainly felt it was. She fought the disease, seeking out frontiers-of-medicine treatments and, Tomi-style, confronting it with a paradoxical and whimsical mix of maudlin resignation and I'm-going-to-beat-this verve. She organized her last birthday party in 2009, a \"wake without a corpse... yet\" as she liked to describe it, as a \"Memento Mori\" event: there were black balloons, an Izzi Kirkland-created skeleton piñata, and Tomi wore skeleton earrings. She was greatly amused by the guest who asked her what \"Memento Mori\" meant in Japanese. If you can't beat death, you might as well join it.\n\nTomi had no end of advantages over the rest of us — she died at 56 looking 26 and, despite her occupation, her brain was definitely a pre-internet model, with a photographic memory capable of storing and retrieving vast quantities of data, pieces of music, and reams of poetry in various languages.\n\nAs the daughter of a geophysicist, the early odds seemed to favor a scientific career for the extraordinarily precocious infant. By 18 months, she could recite the periodic table by heart. But Tomi's lifelong propensity for taking the *other* path asserted itself early (perhaps under the influence of her maternal grandfather Yojiro Ishizaka, one of Japan's most beloved novelists), and science ended up being relegated to her younger sister Naomi, while young Tomi turned to music, literature and poetry. When Tomi at age 8 wondered about a philosophical issue raised by C.S. Lewis's Narnia books (what happened after The Last Battle?), rather than bother her school teacher, she simply wrote directly to the author — and received a thoughtful reply, one which Lewis's biographers are still puzzling over. With Tomi's intellect and memory, toiling over schoolbooks was unnecessary. Standardized tests, it turns out, can have some benefit in identifying brains like Tomi's; despite attending a large public high school in suburban Denver that provided little in the way of actual education, she scored perfect 800s on her SATs and achievement tests. Harvard and Yale both accepted her, but Yale offered a scholarship. Yale it would be.\n\nTomi was fearless, and had an irrepressible zest for adventure. She was a consummate tomboy. There was the time she woke up her friend Claire Hill and insisted they take Claire's horse Trixie for a midnight ride. Where would you take Trixie at midnight? Onto the Lakewood Country Club golf course, which always looks so inviting for a ride but which, for some unfathomable reason, prohibits horses. Trixie's hoofs marked many a green that night.\n\nTomi was also calm under fire. Even at age ten, she was the one you'd want with you in a foxhole. When, on a subsequent escapade, Claire and Tomi found themselves lost in the Rockies with night fast approaching, Tomi kept Claire calm by insisting they sing all the Gilbert & Sullivan they knew (which was a lot), remaining unflappable throughout until the right trail finally materialized. Their singing wasn't bad either, as judged by the cellist Rostropovich, who overheard the two girls singing a Bach invention on a ski lift in Aspen and invited them home for a command performance. Claire's father was upset that they had spoken to a stranger until he discovered the identity of their mystery admirer.\n\nTomi has escaped more than her share of close brushes with death over the years, including amoebic dysentery and a bus accident high on the Khyber Pass, a military coup in Kabul, a near-fatal attack of peritonitis in the south of France, and severe injury in a car crash, whose aftermath caused her to drop out of Cornell Law School and enroll instead in Stanford Business School, where she graduated with an MBA in 1982. In her brief stint at law school, she dumbfounded her first-year torts professor when put on the spot by answering in class, \"Education is more than the simple recitation of facts.\" The exchange ended with the professor, his back against the wall, saying: \"This is a classroom, not a courtroom, young lady.\"\n\nTomi took a leap into the fledgling software industry to co-found Sensei Software in 1984 under the wing of Doug Carlston, founder of Broderbund Software. There were two results: First, an award-winning line of educational products, Calculus, Geometry, and Physics; and second, Tomi was forced, much to her chagrin, to actually learn calculus, geometry and physics.\n\nTomi's years of toil in the Broderbund attic at 47 Paul Drive launched a long creative association with game designer Jordan Mechner, who was programming Prince of Persia in the next room. Jordan's 1997 adventure game The Last Express showcases Tomi's storytelling brilliance as well as her wide-ranging acquaintance with European literature and culture. The research stage of this four-year labor of love included a journey into the bowels of Paris's Gare de l'Est to coax from retired French railway employees certain closely guarded secrets of the 1914 Orient Express, an odyssey Tomi documented in her Newsweek article about the making of the game.\n\nTomi cleverly escaped the scenic delights of a San Rafael industrial park to decamp for Paris, where she lived and worked for a year setting up the new European division of Broderbund. Whether Tomi was actually fluent in French at the beginning of this project, as she claimed when applying for the job, may never be known; what is certain is that by the end of it, she spoke French not only fluently, but poetically, sometimes expressing business matters in phrases so lyrical that her Parisian colleagues were left shaking their heads in respectful amazement.\n\nIn 1994, Broderbund Software founder Doug Carlston, having previously secured the publishing rights to Tomi's software products, secured even more valuable future rights by marrying Tomi herself. Doug's daughter Colleen served as flower girl, strewing rose petals across the Colorado landscape during the ceremony.\n\nTomi's love of cinema, tracing back to her undergraduate days as a director of Yale's Berkeley Film Society, found expression throughout her life, not only in her writing and photography, but in her participation in a myriad of diverse projects: from Chavez Ravine, an award-winning PBS documentary about the neighborhood displaced by Dodger Stadium, which Tomi executive-produced, to the catacombs, secret passageways and puzzle rooms woven throughout the magical home she and Doug designed and built in Snowmass, Colorado.\n\nTomi's unique intellect, and almost preternatural ability to unerringly home in on the crucial point in a bewildering mass of data, made her invaluable as a consultant to Applied Minds, MetaWeb, and other clients. During this time, she also devoted immeasurable care and attention to her son Denman through the most difficult stages of a childhood beset by life-threatening health challenges and autism spectrum disorder. Despite his disabilities, Tomi's loving care insured that Denman had a magical and fulfilling childhood. Even as her own abilities began to diminish through her long and difficult illness, she rejoiced in Denman's achievements of milestones that doctors had told her might never be possible. She never wavered in her complete faith in his potential. Den's world of nurses and caregivers became the focal point of her life and among her closest companions.\n\nThrough it all, Tomi and Doug lived a life rich in adventure and foreign travel, often including friends and family in their journeys to Africa, Albania, Iceland, and Japan, where Colleen developed strong ties with Tomi's Japanese family, becoming fluent in Japanese and attending Kyoto University.\n\nFor her last venture, Tomi returned to her tech startup roots, co-founding 24 Hour Diner with Patrick Tufts. Typically of Tomi, she insisted on working right up to the end, holding her last board meeting less than a week before her death. Tomi loved to think creatively and strategically about the challenges facing the young company as it found its way in the world.\n\nWhat no biography can capture is the extraordinary generosity that permeated all Tomi's relationships, from her nearest and dearest to people she met only once; from the world's great intellects, movers and shakers, to the toll-takers on the Golden Gate Bridge who knew her by name. Tomi had an extraordinary gift for connecting with people on the most personal, human level, seemingly without effort and often within moments of the first meeting. She had a charisma that couldn't be simulated or feigned, because she was only being herself. She thought constantly of other people — as anyone who has traveled with her can attest, having been subjected to the endless delays and inconvenience of her insistence on finding the right gift not only for her friends and family, but for a long list of others. When she mailed the final payment for her college loans to the financial office at Yale, she sent along a big box of chocolates to everyone in the office. They wrote back to thank her, noting that no one in the long history of that institution had ever thanked them so graciously before.\n\nTomi was generous not only with gifts but with her time, help, and advice, maneuvering and strategizing for others' benefit; most valuable of all, she was generous of herself. Deeply loyal, she inspired loyalty in others. (She could also hold a grudge for a remarkably long time.) In her wide-ranging interests, pursuits, and travels, she brought together people from universes that don't normally intersect.\n\nTomi lives on in the hearts of all of us, but especially of Doug, Denman, Colleen, Art and Rui, Naomi, and the rest of her family, as well as the countless friends around the world who have been touched by her unique spirit. A bright light has gone out but continues to sparkle in our memories. We miss her terribly.\n\nDate Published: 2010-02-04 12:24:42\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog encounters, last express, nostalgia\n\nComments (...)\n\nCaffeine habit\n\nI love coffee shops.

In today's post she discusses why, when making the transition to screenwriting, journalists often fare better than novelists. Her advice to film/TV writers:\n\nThink like a reporter — pare the story down, find the bones of it, and listen to your characters talk in the language of whatever street they come from — even if you let them ramble on a bit in the first draft, eventually try to find the succinct quote.\n\nYou get to make up the facts and the people, but the core truths that you're uncovering should be just as real as if the story had happened.

For readers curious about what that was like, I've posted these pages from my travel sketchbook.\n\nThe idea of a junket is to bring the talent — which in this case included Jerry Bruckheimer, Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton, Sir Ben Kingsley, Mike Newell, and me — to one destination so the press can come to us, instead of sending us on a tour from place to place. Having the global premiere of Prince of Persia in London rather than L.A. made it a short trip for European journalists, but a longer one for those from the U.S. and South America.\n\nThe junket took over several floors of the Dorchester hotel in London, where the interviews and press conference were held.\n\nAn inevitability of press junkets is that although the journalists come from different cities and countries, with a range of interviewing styles, you nonetheless tend to get asked the same questions, sometimes thirty or forty times in a single day.\n\nThe premiere was Sunday night at the London Westvue.\n\nNot pictured: Gemma dancing barefoot in her princess gown at the afterparty.\n\nSeeing the \"Coming Soon\" signs for Prince of Persia in the Odeon Leicester Square gave me tingles. That's the theater where I first saw Raiders of the Lost Ark in the summer of 1981, right out of high school, in a packed house. It set the bar for my summer moviegoing experiences to date, and was one of my major inspirations in creating Prince of Persia on the Apple II a few years later.\n\nNext: On to Moscow.\n\nDate Published: 2010-05-17 12:13:16\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Film, Prince of Persia, Sketchbook\n\nComments (...)\n\nSolomon's Thieves released\n\nI'm excited to announce that Solomon's Thieves, my first/second, First Second graphic novel illustrated by the terrific LeUyen Pham and Alex Puvilland, is now on sale in bookstores and on Amazon.

It was the nicest plane I've ever been on. I felt like Tony Stark for a few hours.\n\nEvery fun, relaxing hobby ought to contain an element of danger; for me, drawing people I know at close range is the halfpipe of sketching. When the result is a bad likeness, unflattering or both (which it often is), there's nowhere to hide. In this case, several of the people on the plane with me were world-famous, so the stage was basically set for a spectacular wipe-out. But I had to try.\n\nThe ones of Jerry and Mike Newell (above) are at least more recognizable than some of the others.\n\nNone of the ones of Gemma really look like her. Girls are harder to draw than guys to begin with, and the more beautiful they are the harder it is. It often ends up either looking like a generic \"pretty girl\" or a different girl entirely.\n\nGemma got her revenge, as you can see from her rendition of me on the right-hand page above.\n\nThe press junket, premiere and afterparty were on Tuesday, so I didn't get to do any sketching that day. Wednesday was our free day; Mike Newell and I began it with a three-hour tour of the Kremlin's incredible armory.\n\nThis was my first visit to Russia, a country I've long wanted to visit. At three days, it was much too short.\n\nDate Published: 2010-05-24 21:23:19\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Film, Prince of Persia, Sketchbook\n\nComments (...)\n\nPoP released for IMAX and iPhone\n\nI woke up this morning thinking \"Today's the day!\" One that's been emblazoned in my mind for weeks now, thanks to subtle reminders like this one:\n\nBut it wasn't until I picked up my iPhone and blearily checked email and Twitter while making breakfast (compulsive habit, I know; I'm trying to break it) that I received the surprising news that today is ALSO the release date of the original Prince of Persia for iPhone/iPad.\n\nYou'd think such perfect timing would have to have been coordinated months in advance, but it wasn't.

A series of other writers took it from there: Jeff Nachmanoff, Boaz Yakin, Doug Miro & Carlo Bernard, in that order, resulting in the shooting script that went into production in summer 2008.\n\nThe making of the movie is well documented in Michael Singer's coffee-table-worthy book and the movie DVD/Blu-Ray extras.

Now, here's the script of the videogame (PDF) that inspired it: 2003's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.\n\nOr rather, partial script. For writers interested in the differences between writing for movies and games, it's worth noting that there is no game design document equivalent to a film screenplay (i.e. an established format for the writer to communicate the story to producers, director, cast and crew).\n\nTypically, the larger part of my writing work on Sands of Time was conveyed through non-screenplay documents (dialog recording and tracking spreadsheets and the like) to the team of designers, artists and engineers. I've described that process in more detail in this article for MIT Press.\n\nThe \"readable screenplay\" posted here reads like a film screenplay, but that's because it contains only the cinematic cutscenes — not the in-game scripted events, dialog, and voice-over narration that are just as essential to the player's experience of the story. Those exist in no easily readable form.\n\nThe best way to experience a videogame story is to play the game. But for a quick read, this script offers at least a glimpse into Sands of Time's beginnings.\n\nDate Published: 2011-01-10 22:34:29\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Film, film, Games, games, Making Games, Prince of Persia, transmedia\n\nComments (...)\n\nClassic Game Postpartums\n\nIn a couple of weeks, I'll be speaking at Game Developers Conference 2011 in San Francisco, about the making of Prince of Persia (the original, 1989 side-scroller) as part of their \"Classic Game Postmortems\" series.\n\nI'm especially excited to hear from the other speakers — an awesome lineup including, among others, Eric Chahi, Will Wright, Ron Gilbert, Peter Molyneux, John Romero, and Toru \"Pac-Man\" Iwatani — about how their games, which sucked up so many hours of my youth, came to be.\n\n(A non-game-industry friend asked me, in some confusion: \"Why call it a post-mortem?\" These are retrospectives of games that shipped, not ones that got killed. But even though we game designers and programmers are supposed to be a logical bunch, I don't think the term \"post-partum\" is going to catch on any time soon.)\n\nSee you at GDC!\n\nDate Published: 2011-01-24 23:19:57\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: apple, Blog, Games, gdc, Making Games, making of nostalgia, Prince of Persia\n\nComments (...)\n\nInterviewing Leni Riefenstahl\n\nTwenty years ago, my friend George Hickenlooper asked me to come to Munich with him to interview Leni Riefenstahl, the brilliant/infamous director of Triumph of the Will.\n\nHere's the transcript of my notes (PDF) from that interview in case anyone's interested. I stumbled across it while cleaning out an old hard drive.\n\nIt was May 1991. She was 89 years old. She often spoke of herself in the third person. She had a strapping male secretary named Horst.\n\nAs we said goodbye, I realized I was shaking the hand of someone who'd once shaken hands with Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"And maybe did more than just shake hands,\" George added.\n\nDate Published: 2011-02-20 15:59:29\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog encounters, Film, film, history\n\nComments (...)\n\nSpicy Thai\n\nGiven a corner table next to the kitchen with a view of the entire restaurant, I had to at least try to take it all in.\n\nDate Published: 2011-02-26 15:44:01\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, la, neighborhood, sketch, Sketchbook\n\nComments (...)\n\nGDC 2011: The wheel turns\n\nNearly everyone I spoke to at GDC 2011 in San Francisco agreed that it was one of the most energizing GDCs of recent years.\n\nI loved the \"Classic Game Post-Mortems,\" a series of one-hour talks in which game designers spoke about the making of their early games: Eric Chahi on Another World (aka Out of This World), Peter Molyneux on Populous, John Romero and Tom Hall on Doom, Mark Cerny on Marble Madness, Toru Iwatani on Pac-Man were fascinating, inspiring, and touching to hear. (I gave a talk about making Prince of Persia, and really appreciated the generous response.)\n\nBut what really grabbed me was the energy and excitement surrounding indie games, especially on new platforms like mobile phones, iOS, Facebook, XBLA and PSN. More than in any previous year, I was reminded of the Apple II zeitgeist of the early eighties. It feels like we've come full circle, as an industry, to that time when a tiny team with few resources but talent, creativity and elbow grease has the potential to produce the next hugely influential mega-hit.\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure I just met some of them in San Francisco.\n\nDate Published: 2011-03-16 09:07:49\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, Games, games, gdc, indie, Karateka, Making Games, Prince of Persia\n\nComments (...)\n\nGDC: Making Prince of Persia\n\nFor those of you who missed GDC — or, inexplicably, went to GDC but missed my talk about the making of Prince of Persia on the Apple II in 1985 — that talk has now been posted online along with the other \"Classic Game Post-Mortem\" talks in the GDC Vault.\n\nYou can see higher-quality versions of the original \"making of\" videos I showed at GDC, including my brother running and jumping and lots more, here at jordanmechner.com.\n\nDate Published: 2011-03-23 09:33:36\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: apple, Blog, Games, Making Games, making of nostalgia, Old School, Prince of Persia\n\nComments (...)\n\nSketchbook: Hollywood hills\n\nDone during a break from a pickup game of Ultimate Frisbee.\n\nDate Published: 2011-03-23 20:53:59\n\nPermalink\n\nTags: Blog, sketch, Sketchbook\n\nComments (...)\n\nFuture of Games Symposium\n\nI'll be joining a UC Santa Cruz symposium in Silicon Valley on April 15, \"Inventing the Future of Games.\" Sims creator Will Wright will give a keynote.
