        "text": "This year saw the launch of two games in the Prince of Persia franchise: Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, which was launched in January, and The Rogue Prince of Persia, a new roguelike entry in the franchise that made its early-access debut on Steam in late May.\n\nHowever, another game in the franchise, Prince of Persia Sands of Time Remake, has been facing challenges on its path to launch. This game has finally been announced for a new 2026 release window at the Ubisoft Forward 2024 showcase.\n\nThe announcement of the new release window was accompanied by a teaser trailer, which depicts time reversing, as evidenced by a burnt-out candle relighting and a shooting star moving backward:\n\nThe remake of the 2003 classic has met a series of challenges, with repeated delays reported. It was first announced in September 2020, with an initial release date set for January 2021, then pushed back to March of the same year. In June 2022, it was announced to be delayed again as the studio switched to Ubisoft Montreal. Last November, Ubisoft announced that Prince of Persia Remake had passed an \"important milestone,\" giving fans quite some hope. This April, insiders shared that the remake has been made from scratch. It's reported that Ubisoft has overhauled the graphics and added new mechanics and animations for combat and parkour.\n\nRegarding this announcement of the new release window, fans have had mixed reactions. Some hope Ubisoft takes their time to ensure the game is fully ready by 2026, while others hope they won't postpone it again.\n\nDo you hold hope of the game being released in 2026? Let us know.
