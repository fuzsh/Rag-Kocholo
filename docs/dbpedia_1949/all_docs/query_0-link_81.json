        "text": "; The first and great piece of archaeology explained by the Bible is, of course, the crossing of the Gulf of Aqaba. This recently declared special, scientific reserve has a wealth of chariot hubs, spoked wheels, etc. Easily explained as Exodus detritus, datable to the 6 th and 18 th dynasties despite Prof.-Dr. Yadin's incredible attempt at proving otherwise. The next tranch so-to-speak of archaeology is a little less dramatic and in-your-face, to use a colloquialism. It consists of burials that do not accord with kingly status. It also relates to the model of kingship an archaeologist uses or should use. It is at this level we will demonstrate the total and complete connection-Near East-wide-between Bible and archaeology. It should be noted that any study of the Scripture cannot be bottled-up into a one-discipline bonding so, of necessity, we will have to expand into many non-archaeological areas and specifically geology.\n\nFor over a century, the archaeology of the Land of Israel went hand in hand with the Bible. Biblical Archaeology, the outcome of this interaction, has been normally conceived as the handmaiden of the biblical texts, authenticating and illustrating them. Whether motivated by theological or secular agenda, the main tenet of Biblical Archaeology was political history. In spite of recent claims for the emancipation of archaeology from the tyranny of the biblical texts, the archaeological agenda is still biblical, pursuing questions related to biblical historiography. Paradoxically, however, due to its problematic nature, the use of the Bible in archaeological discourse is considered today almost illegitimate. We envision a different integration between archaeology and the Bible. On the one hand, an archaeological agenda, independent of the biblical text, will open a much wider range of social and cultural questions. On the other, using the Bible as a cultural document to answer these questions will restore its central place in the archaeological discourse of the biblical period. Conceiving of both biblical texts and ancient material artifacts as cultural documents, we believe that their inspection will be fruitful and enlightening. Words and artifacts can give us access to the mindset of the people of the biblical period. Encapsulated in both are the worldviews, cosmology, perceptions of landscape, ideology, symbolism, etc. of the people who produced them. The insights gained by this approach will eventually result in a better understanding of biblical political history."
