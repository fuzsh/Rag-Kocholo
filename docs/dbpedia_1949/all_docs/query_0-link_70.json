        "text": "Young people in the West are more likely to encounter religion in videogames than in places of worship like churches, mosques or temples. This dissertation departs from observations by enthusiastic theologians who find religion everywhere in videogames – the largest cultural industry in the world. However, if religions are beliefs in supernatural substances given meaning to, culturally, through objects and social functions; then what is really religious about games? Playing at Religion takes an encoding/decoding approach to the appearance of religion in games by asking: “So what?” In other words, “What does the appearance of religion in games actually mean to the people making and playing them?” Chapter 1 reviews the literature on secularization, leading to the question of how religion’s mediatization changes it, and for whom. Chapter 2 contains notes on methodology. Divided into three parts, the empirical chapters concern developers, games, and players respectively. Part I on Encoding opens with Chapter 3, arguing on the basis of ethnography and 22 interviews with developers of Assassin’s Creed that commercial interests drive a corporation to create a nostalgic ‘Marketable Religion’ that commodifies belief by reducing it to an acceptable version for the largest possible audience. Chapter 4 argues on the basis of 35 interviews with independent developers that, despite the promise of their independence, religious and irreligious ‘indies’ alike similarly cannot escape a standardized, inherited conventions of religion in game design that are divorced from their own beliefs, and are as commodified as they are Eurocentric in the resulting use of religion in game design. Part II on the Games themselves contains Chapters 5 and 6: two content analyses of two genres – fantasy and the post-apocalypse – that show the extent of how games historicize and combine religious cultural heritages into ‘Eclectic Religion’ or even apply it in new ways, by using divine metaphors to deify ‘Awe-ful Technologies’ such as AI and the atom bomb. Part III on Decoding opens with Chapter 7, analyzing on the basis of 100 online forum discussions how games prompt players to discuss the meanings and meaninglessness of religion in videogames among themselves in a ‘Pop Theology,’ based on their personal religious beliefs. Chapter 8 further analyses the experiences of 20 such interviewed players to understand how ‘Playing the Other’ in videogames enables them to try on and drop others’ religious beliefs and identities as they wish. The dissertation concludes that developers, games and players engage in a playing ‘at’ religion which reduces religions as sources of ultimate meaning to commodified, mediatized simulacra which allow for a ‘ludic epistemology.’ In doing so, games inspire us to play at religion like children play soldier or house: a rethinking of religious worldviews as no longer a question of belief or disbelief in ultimate truths; but as something to be tried on, compared and discarded. Thus mediatized, millions of players globally have all the possible beliefs in the world available to them, playing at religion with the push of a button.\n\nOur contemporary digital games are filled with religion. Players battle Templars through the ages (Assassins Creed series [Ubisoft, 2007–]); fight for the Chantry (Dragon Age: Inquisition [BioWare, 2014]), and against the alien Church of Unitology (Dead Space [Visceral, 2008]). Players may summon and commune with gods from various pantheons – from angels to Greek gods and the ‘fictional’ Aedra of Tamriel (e.g., Shin Megami Tensei series [Atlus, 1992–]; Age of Mythology [Ensemble, 2002]; e.g., The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim [Bethesda, 2011]). Indeed, across genres and platforms, it has previously been assessed that games’ virtual worlds are suffused with such religious and spiritual narratives, cosmologies, narratives, symbols and rituals (Krzywinska, 2006; Aupers, 2007; Campbell et al., 2014). Given the fact that most of such studies are based on textual content analysis (e.g., Šisler 2008; Trattner, 2016; Bosman, 2016), which analyze in game representations of religion; the question remains: How and why, if at all, do players relate to religious content while playing such games? To address this question we took on the approach developed in cultural (media) studies, i.e. focusing on the process of “encoding/decoding” and consumer practices of “textual poaching” (cf. Hall, 1980; Jenkins, 2015). We adopt this perspective in studying religious meaning-making in games for two reasons. First of all: dominant representation-based studies in the field hold on to an approach that is more suitable with static or noninteractive (mass)media. Looking at representations in games is particularly problematic because it disregards the medium-specificity of digital game-play: players are not simply passive consumers but actively “reconfigure” games (Raessens, 2005) through the act of role-playing (partly) as their avatar (e.g., Rehak, 2003; Klevjer, 2007). Secondly, representation-based research neglects the specificity, divergence of and differences between individual players. Players’ accounts of meaning-making are variable, often resulting in mutually exclusive understandings of the same video game. Specifically in the case of religion, we hold, players from different religious backgrounds understand in-game religious meanings in vastly different ways (e.g., Aupers & Schaap, 2016). The research question, then, becomes specifically: in what ways do players with different (non-)religious identities play with the digital (role-play) identities provided by the characters and worlds of video games? In order to answer this question, we resorted to qualitative semi-structured interviews (N=20). A general call was put out on different video game forums to arrive at a set of theoretically selected Christian, Muslim, Hindu and different religiously non-identifying (atheist, agnostic, etc.) video game players. By interviewing them regarding their (non-)religious backgrounds, the religious content and characters of the games they played; and the connections they experienced between the two, we were able to formulate a number of conclusions. Our research indicates that, rather than alienating themselves from religious ‘others,’ players frequently have meaningful experiences role-playing as the religious other. This activity of role-playing the ‘Other,’ so we demonstrate in our analysis, has three implications. Firstly, they come to familiarize themselves with religious worldviews and practices that they could not normally access, such as the mosque-filled streets and Islamic calls to prayer of Assassin’s Creed. Secondly, they came to distance themselves from their own (non)religious worldviews as a particular construction, rather than a natural and taken-for-granted reality. This process we conceptualize as defamiliarization” (cf. Shklovsky, 1991). Thirdly, players suggested that their avatars allowed them to experience and temporarily believe what they could otherwise not. Religious players freely switched between worldviews that are otherwise in major disagreement with their beliefs; while also frequently reflecting on the assumed atheism of video game characters. In two cases, players underwent drastic de-conversions due to the roles they played. Meanwhile, religious ‘nones’ reported on the queerness and (re-)enchantment of a world with the certainties of rituals and gods. In all, players reported understanding and sympathy for the roles and worldviews they were brought to identify with, prompting one agnostic player to sum up: “What if I’m wrong? Is this how others in the real world use religion?” Based on our study, we argue that (role-)playing in video games motivates a form of religious relativization that destabilizes the ‘absolute truth’ claims of many religions (cf. Berger, 1969); while fostering a general inclusiveness towards religious Others by allowing players to bracket their own worldviews, in order to temporarily adopt the ‘absolute’ truths of others’ worldviews."
