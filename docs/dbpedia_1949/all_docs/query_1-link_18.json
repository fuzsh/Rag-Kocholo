        "text": "Do you still remember Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake? It has been struggling forever, with Ubisoft Montreal taking over the project in 2022. After a storm of criticism and a long silence, Ubisoft finally said that the game \"passed an important internal milestone and development is progressing.\" Since then, there's been no news again.\n\nIt seems like the developers have been working hard on it because Insider Gaming's sources say the remake has been made from scratch. Ubisoft has taken a more \"realistic approach\" and overhauled the graphics, adding new mechanics and animations for combat and parkour. The team has rewritten Sands of Time Remake, redone motion capture, and more.\n\nUnfortunately, the Prince won't be voiced by Yuri Lowenthal anymore, even though he did so in the reveal trailer. From what Insider Gaming has seen, Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake is still missing textures and assets, so we likely won't be able to play it for a while. However, some sources think Ubisoft might share an update on the project soon. The company refused to comment on \"rumours and speculation.\""
