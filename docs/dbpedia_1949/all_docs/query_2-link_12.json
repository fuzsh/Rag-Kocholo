The Creator\n\nb. The Publisher\n\nc. The Company\n\nd. Timeline\n\ne. Sales Figures\n\nThe Creator - Patrice Désilets\n\n[1]\n\nPatrice Désilets is the creator of Assassin's Creed. He's a French Canadian who worked at Ubisoft Montreal. Désilets was the creative director behind the first two Assassin's Creed games (Assassin's Creed and Assassin's Creed II). Désilets was also creative director on 2003's Prince of Persia: The Sands Of Time. Désilets left Ubisoft in May 2010 and then joined THQ during the summer of 2011 in their newly developed Montreal based studio. Désilets worked for Ubisoft for 13 years, starting on July 2, 1997 and ending on May 28, 2010. Désilets was under contract with Ubisoft still and had to wait a year before he could do any work with another company. So he took a year off from working after he quit Ubisoft and a year later joined THQ. It was rumored that Désilets was unhappy with the early release date of AC and didn't like the direction Ubisoft was taking AC and that's why he left.\n\nPatrice Désilets talks about Assassin's Creed:\n\nAn interview with Patrice Désilets on how he came up with the concept for Assassin's Creed:\n\nOthers Involved in the Creation of AC:\n\nJade Raymond\n\n[2]\n\nJade Raymond is a French Canadian video game executive who works as the Managing Director of Ubisoft Toronto. She first worked as a programmer for Sony, where she eventually helped in the creation of Sony Online’s first Research and Development group. This led to Electronic Arts where she worked as a producer on The Sims Online. In 2004, she started working for Ubisoft Montreal, where she was appointed as producer of Assassin's Creed. In July 2009, Raymond was named Managing Director of Ubisoft Toronto studio.\n\n[3] Interview with Jade Raymond:\n\n\"Xbox Gazette : How long has Assassin's Creed been in development ? Can you present the main designers?\n\nJade Raymond : Assassin's Creed has been in development for over two years. Immediately after shipping Prince of Persia the sands of time a small core team was given the mandate to create a new IP specifically designed to take advantage of next-gen hardware. Patrice Desilets: Creative Director, David Chateauneuf Level Design Director, Alex Drouin Animation Director and Richard Dumas Lead Gameplay programmer already had a ton of ideas of where they wanted to take next gen gameplay. Claude Langlais and Dominic Couture who led the technology for Sands of time had their own vision for the engine and tools of the future. The fact these people as well as other core members from The Sands of Time had already worked together means that they were up and running with a long list of ideas to prototype from day one. I joined the team a few months into conception to help give more focus to the team's pre-production efforts, add a little more structure to the milestones and build out the team. While the core team is same core team from The Sands of Time we have also added specialists from other teams at Ubisoft and the Game industry at large. Ubisoft asked us to redefine the action genre for the next-generation of consoles and the only way to achieve such an ambitious goal is to put together the right team: People who have proven that they can work together to deliver a hit as well as experts with diverse backgrounds.\n\nXbox Gazette : What were your sources of inspiration for Assassin's Creed ?\n\nJade Raymond : Obviously we had a lot of inspirations and references, but here's how it started: Patrice Desilets our Creative Director as well as some other key members of our Creative team read a book about the Assassins and then started to do a lot of research about the clan and the 3rd crusade. The more we discovered about these people, the more we wanted to make the game. Even the Assassin Motto \"Nothing is True, Everything is permitted\" fits the game medium perfectly. We developed our main character, Altair as a forward thinking missionary of sorts, on a mission to end the 3rd crusade.\n\nXbox Gazette : Is the game more directed towards fiction or History?\n\nJade Raymond : Actually the game is directed at the same time towards fiction and history. It's a speculative fiction, and it's a fun genre to work in. By grounding a story in reality, you increase its credibility. Suspension of disbelief becomes easier because it's happening in our world. You're exploring cities that still exist today - encountering infamous individuals whose names everyone knows - witnessing battles that really occurred.\n\nAt the same time, because our setting is far removed in time (this is nearly 1000 years ago), there's plenty of freedom to tweak people's personalities and motivations. It's fun to explore the idea that something else was happening beneath the information gleaned from historical textbooks. People are also fascinated by \"History's Mysteries\" and the Templar Treasure was ripe for exploring. What did the Templars find beneath Solomon's Temple? Why did they want it? Where is it today?\n\nXbox Gazette :\n\nHow will Assassin's Creed differ from other games like Prince of Persia?\n\nJade Raymond : I've heard a lot of comparisons: Splinter Cell, Hitman, Shadow of Colossus, Prince of Persia, GTA, … All of these are great games so it's quite flattering but our goal with Assassin's Creed was to use the new tech to deliver new types of gameplay and a more relevant experience. If we finish our work as planned then the feel of the final game should be quite unique. The biggest difference with Splinter Cell is that Assassin's Creed is not a stealth game. We do have a feature called social stealth. A rule that says that you are hidden as long as you are behaving in a socially acceptable way. But this rule results in a much more fast paced type of gameplay then traditional stealth that is based on staying hidden in shadow, especially since you are trying to blend into the chaos of a crowd in the midst of one the bloodiest wars in history. Besides the difference in pacing there is also a difference in the amount of freedom given to the player. We have recreated the entire Holy Land, 3 major cities as well as all of the countryside in between. The player is free to roam the countryside, explore cities, and participate in side quests and missions to help the population or complete main Assassination missions. All of these objectives can be accomplished in a variety of ways and in the order that suits the player's mood. We put a lot of emphasis on player creativity and set the whole game experience up so that you can develop your own playing style and adjust the level of difficulty and adrenaline to your liking.\n\nXbox Gazette : Can we travel freely from one city to another in the game?\n\nJade Raymond : As a matter of fact yes. Not only you'll be to able to travel freely from on city to another but we are also trying to do something a little different that was not possible before. We focused on building a character that can do over 1000 contextual moves, and paired this new freedom of movement with a highly interactive environment and crowd lets players develop their own style. Any architectural detail that sticks out more then 2 inches can be used as a hold for your hands or feet. Not only can create your own path on the rooftops you can also create your own flashy or subtle style for doing so or skip the roofs entirely and use a strategy through the crowd. Place a highly mobile and skilled Assassin in a fully interactive living environment and the possibilities are endless.\n\nXbox Gazette : Which new possibilities do the \"next gen\" consoles give you for this > kind of action game? What makes AC a \"next gen\" game?\n\nJade Raymond : This game would never have been possible on the last generation of consoles. Our goal with Assassin's Creed was to use all of the Next Gen processing power to deliver a totally new game experience, focusing on interactivity and immersion. We're aiming to create a world in which the player can interact with everything and where there is no suspension of disbelief because for example some doors can be opened but other can not. We have started with the concept that the player should have full control over the Assassin's body and that the Assassin should be able to interact with the world in an intuitive and natural way. The new gameplay comes from how the living and breathing world reacts to your second to second actions. The need for artificial puzzle elements like moving walls or fire traps disappears because for the first time we can base our gameplay on social rules and the natural traps found in real cities.\n\nSo each player will be able to tune the difficulty level of the game when choosing how he behaves in the world. He will make the challenge easier if he follows the social rules and achieve all sorts of side missions prior to his main assignments or harder if he decides to create havoc in the city before completing his mission.\"\n\nCorey May\n\n[5]\n\nCorey May co-wrote Assassin's Creed and Assassin's Creed II. He graduated from Harvard University in 1999 and founded Sekretagent Productions with Dooma Wendschuh which May is the president of. Wendschuh and May formed the company after graduating from the University of Southern California's Peter Stark Producing Program in 2001. [6] \"Sekretagent Productions is a production company based in Los Angeles, California working in the film, video, game, and internet industries.\"\n\nDooma Wendschuh\n\n[7]\n\nMichael \"Dooma\" Wendschuh is a co-founder with Corey May of Sekretagent Productions. He graduated from Princeton University in 1999 and founded Sekretagent with May in 2001 after their graduation from the University of Southern California's Peter Stark Producing Program.\n\nDooma along with May has co-written and designed videos such as the Prince of Persia Games and Assassin's Creed.\n\nPublishers\n\nUbisoft, the main publisher and distributer of the Assassins Creed games, was founded back in 1986 and has since grown to be the 6th largest video game publishing company in the United States. Created by the the Guillemot brothers, Ubisoft was initially a European based company, but expanded in 1996 to include countries all over the world.\n\nAs of November 2011, Ubisoft is the third largest video game publishing company in Europe and the sixth largest in the United states. Yyves Guillemot One of it's largest and most popular studios, Ubisoft Montreal, was responsible for publishing the Assassins Creed game series. The company has published 756 games for 23 different platforms, though Assassins Creed is only available for Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and PC's.\n\nThe Company\n\nUbisoft\n\n(Yves Guillemot, Chairman and CEO)\n\nUbisoft was founded by five brothers from the Guillemot family of France in March of 1986. Yves Guillemot (chairman and CEO) made deals with Electronic Arts (EA), Sierra On-Line, and MircoProse so they could distribute games in France. By the end of the 1980's Ubisoft expanded to USA, Germany, and the United Kingdom. in 1994 Ubisoft opened a studio in Montreuil, France; this studio ended up becoming their headquarters. In 1996 Ubisoft became a publicly traded company and continued to expand around the world. In 2000 and 2001 Ubisoft acquired many companies including Red Storm Entertainment and The Learning Company's entertainment division. Ubisoft currently has 29 studios around the world including four in Canada and two in USA. Ubisoft's first big game was Splinter Cell, which was made in the Montreal studio. Ubisoft then bought the Prince of Persia series after Prince of Persia 3D flopped. While searching for inspiration, Patrice Desilets delved into 12th century middle east history when he discovered an assassin's order with a strict code of conduct (harm no innocents, execute all targets publicly, in spectacular fashion, to instill fear.) This gave Desilets the idea for Assassin's Creed, an assassin traveling through the streets, blending with the crowds, jumping from rooftop to rooftop, and assassinating targets. Desilets assassin's also had a code of conduct, \"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.\" Assassin's Creed was released against some huge titles (Halo 3, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare) and it stood out above them all. Assassin's Creed put Ubisoft on the map and it has stayed there.\n\nTimeline\n\n[9]\n\nMain Games:\n\nAssassin's Creed ( November 14, 2007)\n\nAssassins Creed II ( November 17, 2009)\n\nSales figures for Assassin's Creed II have been released: the game has sold over six million units since its launch in November 2009, 40 percent higher than its predecessor's numbers. This incredible feat is only emphasised by the fact it was released alongside Activision's powerhouse Modern Warfare 2 -- a huge catch for gamers.\n\nThough the latter was thought to be the zenith of 2009 gaming, our review highlights how Assassin's Creed IItrumped MW2 as the better sequel, despite the lack of an online component.\n\nNo doubt these figures have inspired the developers to build on the Assassin's Creed experience, with the third installment due to launch in fiscal 2011. Ubisoft expects figures to reach nine million by the end of March.\n\nAssassin's Creed: Brotherhood ( November 16, 2010)\n\nAssassin's Creed: Revelations (November 15, 2011)\n\nOther games versions:\n\nAssassin's Creed: Altaïr's Chronicles (Released in Android, Nintendo DS, iOS, Web OSm, Window 7 on Feb 5, 2008)\n\nAssassin's Creed: Bloodlines (Released on November 19, 2009 which exclusive with Playstation Portable)\n\nAssassin's Creed II: Discovery (November 17, 2009 Nintendo DS, iOS, and Apple Inc.)\n\nAssassin's Creed: Project Legacy (Released online on September 30, 2010)\n\nAssassin's Creed: Lost Legacy (It was developed for Nintendo 3Ds, but On July 14, 2011, it was revealed that the game was completely cancelled).\n\nAssassin's Creed: Multiplayer Rearmed (September 15, 2011, Designed for ipad, iphone, ipod touch)\n\nSales Figures\n\nFrom it's debut in 2007 to June of 2011, over 30 million Assassins Creed games have been sold.\n\n(http://thesilentchief.com/2011/06/06/sales-of-assassins-creed-franchise-tops-30-million-copies/ )\n\nSales Figures\n\nTitle First Weeks sales (USA,Europe,Japan) total Assassins Creed\n\n(Xbox 360)--697,212 units\n\n(PS3)-------390,186 units\n\n(Xbox 360)--4,973,694 units\n\n(PS3)-------4,170,269 units\n\nAssassins Creed II\n\n(Xbox 360)--807,934 units\n\n(PS3)-------667,884 units\n\n(Xbox 360)--4,659,702 units\n\n(PS3)-------4,801,231 units\n\nAssassins Creed: Brother Hood\n\n(Xbox 360)--738,471 units\n\n(PS3)-------715,303 units\n\n(Xbox 360)--3,882,343 units\n\n(PS3)--------3,752,379 units\n\nAssassins Creed: Revelation\n\n(Xbox 360)--1,004,589 units\n\n(PS3)-------674,466 units\n\n(Xbox 360)--1,591349 units\n\n(PS3)--------1,205,510 units\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1. http://www.xboxgen.fr/patrice-desilets-patrice-zoom-8388,2700.html\n\n2. http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2011/sep/29/jade-raymond-interview\n\n3. http://www.xboxgazette.com/interview_assassins_creed_en.php\n\n4. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Raymond\n\n5. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_May\n\n6. https://plus.google.com/102994555603999339299/posts\n\n7. http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Corey_May\n\n8. http://www.neoseeker.com/news/12836-assassins-creed-ii-sales-soar-over-6-million/\n\n9. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed#Assassin.27s_Creed\n\nhttp://gamrreview.vgchartz.com/sales-data/12728/assassins-creed/\n\n---"
