Thanks to her energy and creativity as a researcher, we meet scores of people who might otherwise be “victims of the vagaries of existence,” from the first troupe of blind actors to the “individualist, dirty, noisy, and quarrelsome” residents of the Quinze-Vingts hospice, not all of whom were—to invoke her phrase—choirboys. Weygand uses these stories and better-known figures such as Denis Diderot and Louis Braille to offer a new understanding of the Enlightenment and its legacy. This is not a case of overcompensating for the seeming marginality of her subject by making a bold claim. Rather, Weygand’s in-depth study of the reciprocal relationship between the social treatment and representations of blind people from the Middle Ages to the middle of the nineteenth century invites readers to reconsider the ocularcentric roots of modernity. After all, what better place to think about the perverted power of the visual and visual culture than in an institution for the blind? Until just a few years ago, historians wouldn’t have had the gumption or the analytic tools to pose such a question. And even today a wary few might still find the history of blind people a useless, if quaint, undertaking. But thanks to the emerging field of disability history to which Weygand has been a tireless and highly original contributor, scholars will find questions and resources that breathe new life into the study of the French past. Influenced by work in gender, sexuality, and race, this critical approach to disability invites us to rethink everything from ideas about physical and cognitive normality to the role of the senses in shaping\n\nForeword ix discourses of the modern. Provocateurs laboring in this young field assert that disability must take its place alongside these other groups to help us unpack what we take for granted and why. Thus, just as anyone hoping to understand what it meant to be European must engage with questions of how Europeans described the world beyond, so too scholars analyzing the power of visual culture need to grapple with the people who appeared anathema to it. Like her forebears of the Annales school, Weygand ultimately offers a history of the present. “When it comes to attitudes toward disabled people,” she explains in the introduction, “it appears that our society remains, in many respects, a prisoner of a past that refuses to die.” Though largely spared the humiliation that made them buffoons of farce and the victims of trickery in the premodern era, blind people at the beginning of the twenty-first century remain misunderstood and marginalized, as evidenced by an unemployment rate of over 70 percent. They, like people with other disabilities, face rampant discrimination often disguised as benevolent paternalism or complete erasure from anything but maudlin, sentimental stories. In bringing a far richer and more complex world to life, Weygand has provided the golden hammer for driving nails into the coffins of old ideas and practices. Catherine Kudlick is Professor of History at University of California, Davis. She is the author of Cholera in Post-Revolutionary Paris: A Cultural History and, with Zina Weygand, Reflections: The Life and Writings of a Young Blind Woman in Post-Revolutionary Paris. She is currently President of the Disability History Association.\n\nPreface By Alain Corbin\n\nThere are works of history that satisfy the desire for a temporal change of scenery and stimulate reverie; others, more rare, deeply move their reader. This is the case with Zina Weygand’s book. It obliges each of us to interrogate that share of the irrational that remains deep within us when we confront blindness. Our culture of universals, so magnified during the celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution, distances us from the Anglo-Saxon culture of difference. There results an inevitable backwardness. In France, specialized histories of disabilities and handicaps are few and far between. In this barely cleared field, Zina Weygand is a vital figure. For several decades now, she has been methodically studying the representations and circumstances of blind people in the past. The point of departure for her research concerns the inheritance of the Age of Enlightenment. From Locke to Condillac, the adherents of sensationalism posited that sensory experience was at the center of cognitive processes. They expected that an operation on a newborn that would permit the child to see would reveal the truth of the sensible. This crucial experiment, Zina Weygand assures us, was the founding myth of Enlightenment philosophy. Diderot, from the publication of the Letter on the Blind to the drafting of his final Additions thirty-four years later, struggled, for his part, to penetrate the world of the blind, thenceforth desacralized by surgery. Thanks to him, the sightless person became “the subject of a dialogue between equals.” This discussion of difference led to a rereading of the hierarchy of senses and to the promotion of touch. It gave rise to a hymn to vicariance—the substitution of one sensation for another. This new way of seeing transformed attitudes. While the image of a blind citizen “capable of\n\nPreface xi attaining culture, employment, and dignity” slowly began to take shape, the sensitive soul was moved by disabilities. Philanthropy and a passion for pedagogy, not to mention the rise of silent reading among cultivated elites, led to the desire to educate the congenitally blind. Zina Weygand quickly understood the need for a genealogical approach. To accurately measure the importance of the revolution that took place in the Age of Enlightenment, it was necessary to plumb historic depths. Fabliaux, medieval theater, romance literature, not to mention fairground exhibits, reveal the great complexity of images, sentiments, and attitudes. Blindness long inspired terror. The figure of the blind buffoon, clumsy and coarse, exorcised this sentiment. Derision was directed at the drunken beggar, cynical and debauched, often duped by his guide. The disability, a visible mark of a hidden defect, also aroused repugnance. Blindness, along with its companions, ignorance and vice, symbolized blindness of spirit, a dimming of the intelligence. At the same time blindness solicited compassion. It called for charity. Confraternities of the blind multiplied in the thirteenth century. The good Louis XI founded the Quinze-Vingts. On Holy Thursday, he washed the feet of disabled people. These last benefited from the privilege to beg freely, something not taken away from them until the dawn of the nineteenth century. According to an exchange of gift and countergift, it was expected that the misfortunate pray for their benefactors. The miraculous cure of the newborn in the Gospels made of him an individual who was doubtless better able than others to reveal the grandeur of God. At the dawn of modern times, admiration grew for those who, already in antiquity, were celebrated for their rich interior visions. Deprivation of the spectacle of the world and useless knowledge facilitated spiritual illumination. The blind man of the thirteenth-century mystical theologians knew much more than did scholars, whom he was capable of confounding. In the century of the optical revolution and the Lessons of Darkness, there emerged the figure of the “blind subject, alone and singular,” and on many occasions, Rembrandt celebrated the dignity of the solitary blind man. Another tension, one that has to do with social issues, structures Zina Weygand’s book. A moving cohort of visually impaired members of the elite stands in contrast to the crowd of the indigent blind, and the\n\nxii Preface reader gets a good sense of the profound gap between them. At the end of the eighteenth century, steadfast souls outlined a model of cultivated sightlessness from which Valentin Haüy, protagonist of the book and creator of collective teaching for those blind since birth, took inspiration. February 19, 1785, the date of the establishment of the first free school, divides this history into two periods. From then on and through numerous incidents, the desire to educate, to encourage free speech, to allow blind people to attain happiness, to ensure their right to carnal relations preys on the minds of responsible parties. At the end of the ancien régime, demonstrations at court, spectacles staged for learned societies, public functions, and participation in religious ceremonies paved the way and won people over. The sad performance that, as late as 1771, had marked the festivities of Saint Ovid’s fair became a thing of the past. The fact remains that, with the political torment of the ensuing century, the history of the education of the congenitally blind, so carefully traced by Zina Weygand, is one of contradictory episodes. What persists is a faith in the possibility of apprenticeships, even when belief in the social usefulness of victims of blindness wavers. The incessant rearrangement of the taxonomies of jobs they are said to be capable of is evidence of this hesitation. Hopes peaked between 1791 and 1794. What followed was a long decline of the dream of citizenship. The desire for social control tended to replace the desire for promotion. But the concern for education and social integration expressed in the Law of July 29, 1794, was never abandoned. Recourse to archives enables Zina Weygand to paint a moving picture of the situation of blind children admitted into the institutions reserved for them. Their fate varied to a rhythm of displacements and disgraces. The Consulate and the Empire elaborated formidable regulations that we must measure by the yardstick of those who organized life inside secondary schools. The precision and rigor of the schedule, the putting to work, the elaboration of a range of punishments, the constant surveillance to control behaviors offends our current sensibilities. Zina Weygand also makes the crowd of blind people who contributed to the picturesque of the early nineteenth-century city come to life before our eyes. Singers and wandering musicians, animal trainers, peddlers, fortune-tellers, distributors of lottery tickets, and prostitutes make up a gallery of types whose variety reflects the multiplicity of causes of\n\nPreface xiii blindness. From 1749, the date of the publication of the Letter on the Blind, at the end of the monarchie censitaire,1 a process, far from linear, reshaped the history of blindness. As the decades passed, there arose a collective belief that the visually impaired individual could have a private life and could bloom in fields beyond that of music alone. Talented historian of culture that she is, Zina Weygand is able to reveal the process that allowed blind people to leave the sphere of otherness behind while revealing what a slow process it was. She is even better at displaying the simultaneous representations at work between 1800 and 1850. Three strata, in part consisting of cultural flotsam, are essential to the reading of moralizing novels and of melodrama. The burlesque, the derision that stigmatized the blind person, was still in evidence, as were the feelings of the sensitive soul, forged in the previous century. The main thing was nonetheless the sudden appearance of the romantic vision of blindness. The latter revived, in its own way, recent attitudes toward the ability to perceive invisible realities. The character of Dea gives meaning to The Laughing Man, the great nocturnal novel by Victor Hugo. It symbolizes the abandonment of all references to the blackness of the soul. The book concludes with the touching presence of Louis Braille. He gave the visually impaired access to silent reading and to written communication with the sighted. Here the talent of Zina Weygand becomes particularly evident. Her dense writing, limpid and without artifice, takes its strength from the quality of her restraint. In simple phrases, without ever falling into dithyrambs, she justifies the magnitude of the cult dedicated to the benefactor of the blind. Zina Weygand’s book does not only participate in the grande histoire of disabilities and handicaps. Beyond that, it contributes to the history of the senses, of their hierarchy, their equilibrium, their correspondences, and also to the history of vicariance, a fundamental concept throughout this work. The emergence of spectatorial attitudes has been much studied: the elaboration of new ways of seeing, the intensification and subsequent relaxation of a policing of the gaze, the revival of procedures of ocular infractions between the end of the ancien régime and that of the nineteenth century. Zina Weygand’s book participates decisively in this abounding sensorial anthropology.\n\nthe blind in french society from the middle ages to the century of louis braille\n\nIntroduction Ignorance of the past not only confuses contemporary science; it confounds contemporary action. —Marc Bloch, The Historian’s Craft 1\n\nDespite the progressive acknowledgment, over the course of the twentieth century, that so-called handicapped people have the right to education, professional training, and employment, blind people today still face great difficulties in fully integrating themselves into French society. Moreover, in a “disenchanted” world, they still face irrational behaviors that condition—at least partially—the place accorded them by society. When it comes to attitudes toward disabled people, it appears that our society remains, in many respects, a prisoner of a past that refuses to die. We believe that history, to the extent that it permits us to better grasp the origins of certain individual and collective behaviors, the sources of the exclusion and suffering of disabled persons, has a role to play in any reflection on the social problems engendered by handicaps today. This conviction and the hope to make a contribution, as small as it might be, to the construction of a society more hospitable to the blind are at the origins of the present study.\n\n Introduction\n\nThe Blind in French Society Today Words: From Etymology to Metaphor The word blindness [cécité in French] comes from the Latin caecitas, itself derived from caecus: blind person. As for the word for blind person [aveugle], it is likely a deformation of another Latin expression, ab oculus (literally, “without eyes”). In this way, from the word’s origins, we find the idea of a total absence of sight comparable to an enucleation. To this day, a blind person is generally considered to be living in the deepest darkness, even if we no longer think “without eyes” when we utter the word blind. It is worth noting the negative connotation of this term that designates a person by what he or she is supposed to absolutely lack. It is equally worth remembering in passing the pejorative value of the word blind in its metaphorical applications, particularly in the intellectual and moral domains: “whose judgment is clouded, who lacks light, reason; that which clouds judgment, which deprives of reason; that which does not allow for reflection, examination; who acts without discernment; oblivious, ignorant, etc.”2 Legal Definitions of Blindness If we move from semantics to legislation, there exists in France, since the ordinance of July 3, 1945, concerning the protection of persons disabled and incurable, a legal definition of cecity based on optometric criteria: practical blindness is recognized when visual acuity3 of the best eye is inferior to 1/20 or when the visual field4 is limited on either side by more than 20 degrees. Using a white cane is authorized when visual acuity is equal or inferior to 1/10. This legal definition conditions the allocation of social and financial aid and the indemnification that follows accidents. It does not take into account, however, what is commonly called the capacity for “practical vision.” This last depends on multiple factors and can be appreciated only after in-depth assessment that includes the following: • A test of the visual field far away and up close, if possible in attenuated daylight and not in a dark room\n\nIntroduction  • • • •\n\nA plotting of the central and peripheral visual field A study of color vision A study of light sensitivity Possibly, an electrophysiological exploration\n\nThe assessment should also take into consideration the ability of the subject—extremely variable from one individual to another—to adapt to his or her visual situation.5 In effect, “for the same category of visual impairments, affective, intellectual, motor and social reactions of a partially sighted or blind person can differ, facilitating or aggravating the consequences of the infirmity.”6 There exist, then, different types of blindness, and not all blind people are affected by the total absence of visual perception the vocabulary suggests. Some Epidemiological Data After having tried to define blindness and after having indicated the reductive and approximate character of all definitions, we can ask ourselves how many blind people currently live in France. Here again, nothing is simple: estimations effectively range from 40,000 to 62,000 depending on the sources. On the one hand, the numbers vary according to the type of blindness considered: legal blindness, locomotive blindness, professional blindness, total blindness, partial blindness. On the other hand, and most importantly, there is no obligation to declare generative diseases of blindness in France, and censuses themselves are sometimes contested. If this gives us cause to rejoice as far as individual liberty is concerned, epidemiologists deplore it. They bemoan the lack of prospective studies concerning the evolution of ocular ailments that cause blindness and partial sightedness in our country: the total number of blind people, probably already underestimated at present and of which persons over sixty-five doubtless represent more than half, stands to grow with the increase in life expectancy. Those responsible for public health regret the absence of precise and reliable data that would permit them to undertake effective preventive action in the area of blindness and partial sightedness. In spite of the insufficiency of precise epidemiological information, we can say that chronic glaucoma and ocular traumatisms are the highestranking causes of visual handicaps in Western Europe. The seriousness\n\n Introduction and the frequency of diabetic retinopathy, of detached retinas, and of congenital cataracts are equally known statistics for our country. That said, France has been spared trachoma, xerophthalmia, and onchocercosis, which are, respectively, and in order of importance, the first, second, and third causes of blindness in the world. And cataracts, in any event, are easily curable, even if they rank fourth in the world as the cause of blindness (due to the lack of necessary means to operate under good conditions in poor countries). Social Legislation Whatever their number, and whatever the causes and precise nature of their impairments may be, blind people in France today have their place in the juridical state and not just when it comes to financial assistance. The right to reeducation, to professional training, and to employment, granted to disabled ex-servicemen by the Law of April 26, 1924, on May 5 of the same year was extended to those injured in the workplace and then to all disabled people (who, at that point, officially began to be called “handicapped”) by the Law of Obligatory Employment of November 24, 1957. But it was not until the Law of Orientation in Favor of Disabled Persons of July 30, 1975, that obligatory education (included in vain for blind and deaf children in the Law of March 29, 1882) was finally realized—with mainstreaming as a priority. Resistance to mainstreaming and the need to legislate anew on July 10, 1987, in favor of the employment of the disabled attest to the difficulties encountered in the application of the 1975 law. This is not the place to discuss the issue, but we can ask ourselves if, when it comes to blind people, these difficulties are a consequence of what Pierre Villey calls “the prejudice of blindness”: “A society is composed of individuals who pass away and prejudices that remain. True or false, prejudices shape the lot of individuals. Even more than by his infirmity, the social status of the blind person has been fashioned by the incorrect idea the sighted conceive of it.”7\n\nIntroduction  Representations and Social Treatment of Blindness: The Interest of a Historical Study Pierre Villey attributes the origins of these prejudices to the almost visceral fear sighted people have of blindness: The sighted person judges the blind not for what they are but by the fear blindness inspires. . . . Stronger than all external observations, the revolt of his sensibility in the face of “the most atrocious of maladies” fills a sighted person with prejudice and gives rise to a thousand legends. The sighted person imagines himself struck by blindness. Since the blind behave in ways quite different from his own, he senses everything he will lose and not what he will find [through a better use of his other senses]. An abyss opens up before him.8\n\nFor Villey, the psychological origin of this prejudice explains its permanence and universality. Thirty years after Villey, another blind intellectual, Pierre Henri, taking into consideration theories that the former could not have known, dedicated himself to illuminating the social components of what he no longer called the “prejudice” of blindness, but rather its “concept.” The concept of blindness transmits itself and behaves like a social force, like one of the numerous collective representations that dominate knowledge and orient behaviors. It imposes itself upon the sighted person, constraining him to think in a certain way despite evidence and individual experience, and it determines his behaviors with respect to the blind. The concept also imposes itself externally on the latter, conditioning their reactions and shaping their mentalities such that their psychology would have been different had they not adjusted to or resisted the concept.9\n\n“Prejudice of blindness,” “concept of blindness,” Henri, like Villey, in order to explain resistance to the blind’s integration into the “world of the sighted,” “after two millennia of logical thinking and one hundred and fifty years of attempts at social reclassification of the visually impaired,”10 recurs to the notion of representation. If we follow these two authors, in order to understand what a blind person is and what the place of the blind is in society, it is not enough to define (with difficulty, moreover) blindness; it is not enough to enumerate and to legislate. We have to take into account the image the sighted\n\n Introduction have of blindness and the blind: “Sociologically, a blind person is not just an individual who does not perceive forms and is constrained to think and act accordingly. He is a being who, willy-nilly, incarnates the image the sighted have of the blind and is treated in conformity with this representation.”11 Villey and Henri were themselves blind. Their intellectual and human qualities, their careers, and the success of their personal lives testify to all that is possible in spite of the disability, and at times, thanks to it, to the extent that it obliges the people it affects to maximize their remaining abilities. These men must have suffered nonetheless from the ignorance and behavior of the so-called able-bodied toward the blind. That is probably one of the reasons they sensed the extent to which it was important to take representations into account in any study of blindness and its consequences: The prejudice of the blind . . . can be corrected by facts at any moment. It has persisted, however, by flouting these facts.12 Lacking objective data, the popular imagination has free reign. Suddenly, when it comes to a blind person, exaggerated expressions and epithets in the superlative rush in.13\n\nEven while adhering to Villey and Henri’s analysis of the weight of representations on the social treatment of blindness, it seems important to us to foreground the way in which this treatment, during different periods in history, was able to act in turn on individual and collective representations of blindness and the blind. The great significance of a historical study of the blind in French society will be to demonstrate the reciprocal though not simultaneous influence of representations and social treatment over the course of time. This is to say that such a study cannot but inscribe itself in the longue durée, and that, with respect to this history, we are not far from adhering to Jacques Le Goff’s thesis of “a long, very long, Middle Ages whose structures evolve but slowly [until] the middle of the nineteenth century.”14 There exist, however, in the course of this long process, pivotal periods when new sensibilities appear, sources of social mutations and the generation of new institutional structures that, in turn, cause representations to evolve. The period that stretches from the second half of the\n\nIntroduction  eighteenth to the first half of the nineteenth century is one of those “key moments” in the history of the blind. In 1749, Diderot published the Letter on the Blind for the Benefit of Those Who See in which he put the philosophical speculations of his time concerning the status of the sensorial in the elaboration of human knowledge to the test by observing “a sensible blind man.”15 In 1771, the Abbé Charles-Michel de L’Epée organized the first public presentation of the young deaf-mutes he had been educating for several years using the “language of methodical signs.” The same year, the spectacle of a burlesque concert by the blind of the Quinze-Vingts hospice, held up for ridicule to the visitors of Saint Ovid’s Fair, inspired Valentin Haüy, an obscure translator, expert in writing systems, and reader of Diderot, with the idea of helping the indigent blind escape their humiliating circumstances by educating them through the tactile reading “of books whose characters are in relief.”16 What amused the public of the fair without reservation, filled the heart of the philanthropist with “profound dismay,” and he judged the “display” [“monstration”]—to which the blind seemed to lend themselves willingly—“a dishonor to the human race.”17 The social innovation born of this new way of looking would contribute (albeit with difficulty) to the transformation of the collective sensibility toward blindness and the blind. In February 1785, at the initiative of Haüy and with the assistance of the Philanthropic Society, the Institute for Blind Youth was founded, the first school in the world whose mission was to give free instruction to the blind poor based on the principle of sensory substitution, previously used for the private education of a few individuals from well-to-do families. On September 28, 1791, two months after having nationalized the Institute for the Deaf and Mute, created thirty years before by the Abbé de l’Epée, the Constituent Assembly nationalized the Royal Institute for Blind Youth. The principle of state responsibility for the education of the sensorially impaired was thus posited. The Blind Youth obtained this right definitively with the Law of 10 Thermidor Year III (July 29, 1795) that christened the establishment created ten years earlier by Valentin Haüy the National Institute for the Blind and created “eighty-six free positions [one per administrative département] for as many blind pupils . . . , nourished and supported at the expense of the Republic.18 Subsequently, no\n\n Introduction government would ever revisit this principle. Instead, the modalities of custodianship would vary according to different political regimes. In the meantime, while the institute run by Haüy offered an intellectual, musical, and manual education to a small number of blind young people in order to render them “useful to themselves and to society,” the hospice of the Quinze-Vingts, founded by Saint Louis between 1254 and 1260, continued to help an equally limited number of blind adults from all over the country by lodging them as boarders or granting them nonresident pensions. Though the ideology of the moral, intellectual, and professional education of the indigent blind progressed, elsewhere there remained totally insufficient practices and support structures whose persistence and mode of functioning helped perpetuate the idea of the blind’s inability to fend for themselves. Resistance to the changes under way in the social treatment of blindness quickly translated, then, into a dialectic of assistance and education, one that particularly marked revolutionary committee debates concerning the Institute for Blind Youth that, in 1801, resulted in the unification of the educational establishment created by Haüy and the ancient hospice of the Quinze-Vingts. Their cohabitation lasted until the end of the Empire. The Restoration, by granting independence to the two establishments, turned the Quinze-Vingts into one of the memory sites of the monarchy, whereas the Institute for Blind Youth, despite a certain number of material difficulties, became the crucible in which the blind forged a new identity for themselves and gave themselves the means to fully accede to written culture, thanks to the invention of Louis Braille. The continuity of an institution and of age-old practices; the persistence of traditional representations of blindness and the blind; the difficult triumph of innovation. To understand the forces at work in this crucial historical period, a period ranging from the second half of the eighteenth century to the 1830s, we must step back in time, at least to the thirteenth century, age of the foundation of the hospice of the Quinze-Vingts and of the appearance of the blind in comic literature written in the French vernacular.\n\nchapter 1\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\nWe must begin with an outline of the situation of blind people in Western Europe during the millennium “Renaissance humanists saw as [but] a hiatus,”1 which they unfairly designated by two words forming a parenthesis: the “Middle Ages.” Only then can we examine in greater detail the ways in which medieval comic literature dealt with the stock character of the blind man—a character whose epigones would still be found on the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century stage—and only then can we recall the origins and operation of the hospice of the Quinze-Vingts, whose existence was to heavily impact the representations and treatment of blindness and the blind in France. First of all, what was the frequency and what were the causes of blindness at this time? Due to the malnutrition, lack of hygiene, and infectious diseases that chronically beset the inhabitants of cities and of the countryside, blind people were probably quite numerous in the Middle Ages. To get an idea of the prevalence of blindness in Western Europe during this long period of our story, we can turn to the present situation in third-world countries, where infections, parasites, nutritional deficiencies, and cataracts cause millions of cases of blindness and severe partialsightedness in perhaps 1 percent of the population. In the Middle Ages, just as today, people could be blinded accidentally, most notably as a result of work-related accidents, to which the building trade doubtless paid a heavy tribute. But they could also be victims of war or violence of another order: in 1449, a case of the mutilation and blinding of children kidnapped\n\n from the middle ages to the classical age by criminals and forced into begging was the talk of Paris. Moreover, penal corrections could be just as cruel as the crimes they were intended to punish. In several legal compendiums from the time of Charlemagne to that of Saint Louis, blindness is mentioned among the sanctions inflicted on thieves. That such a punishment figures in books does not prove that it was frequently applied. However, this atrocious punishment is cited in the twelfth-century Roman de Rou as one of the mutilations suffered by Norman peasants who revolted against Richard II.2 Finally, rich or poor, a person could be the victim of hereditary diseases, as was perhaps the case with John the Blind, Count of Luxembourg and King of Bohemia (1296–1348), whose father and uncle had had poor vision and who was ministered to in vain by the doctors of Montpellier faculty before completely losing his sight at age forty. The blind since birth or infancy; those who became blind later on; victims of illness, violence, or accidents: just who were the blind in the Middle Ages? Men, women, children, the elderly, adults in the prime of life; poor people, many poor people, most of the time nameless and yet quite present in hospice archives and in hagiographic literature; but also the not-so-poor, the rich, and even some heads of state whose exploits were the talk of the moment. They crop up here and there, in words and images, in the Lives of the saints, in collections of miracles and exempla. As in the Gospels, they are there to attest to a Light that heals the heart by healing the eyes. The blind are also to be found in the archives of charitable institutions: they bear witness to the rich who helped them. Prestigious blind people appear in the stories of the chroniclers. There are, for example, Bela II, King of Hungary from 1131 to 1141; Dandolo, Doge of Venice from 1192 to 1205 (the year of his death in Constantinople); John of Luxembourg, King of Bohemia from 1310 to 1356, whom we already mentioned, and Jan Žižka, leader of the Hussite revolt from 1419 to 1424. These men speak for themselves and their own courage, but they also attest to the values of the society of their times. The elderly Dandolo leading the Venetians in the 1203 conquest of Constantinople or John the Blind on horseback, commanding his men at the Battle of Crécy, where he met his death on August 26, 1346: these were things made to fire the medieval imagination in the way the exploits of the winners of the Paralympics astonish a public infatuated with sports and sensationalism.\n\nThe Middle Ages  Real or fictional, the blind appear, lastly, in religious or profane theater and in the fabliaux, usually to provoke laughter at their own expense, because disabilities were often perceived quite negatively, and no one hesitated to poke fun at them. All these blind people whose trace we find in the archives and in literature, where were they to be found? Throughout the Middle Ages, the blind poor could be found in the company of “children, widows, the elderly, the lame,”3 crowding in during the distributions of provisions and clothing organized in both city and countryside by the various institutions of ecclesiastical and lay charity that succeeded one another in France: hostels and monastic almonries, monastic hospices [Maisons-Dieu], communal charitable organizations, episcopal or princely almonries, and, finally, the Royal Almonry, whose founding seems to date to 1190,4 and which, from the thirteenth century on, played a particularly important role in the organization of aid to the blind in France. These indigent blind people could live with their families without leaving their town or village. They could also roam the highways to take better advantage of the distributions offered by various charitable institutions. Or they might try to benefit from the generosity of individuals by begging from door to door, on roads, in public squares, or at church portals. To do so, they might be itinerant singers, animal trainers, storytellers, or musicians,5 professions they still practiced in the middle of the nineteenth century. Finally, they might live in institutions founded especially for them as early as the eleventh century by gentlemen of renown or wealthy donors. If the poorest of the blind encountered each other on the roads of beggarly vagrance, both rich and poor could meet on pilgrimage trails. Indeed, the powerlessness of both “learned” and practical medicine to cure serious ocular ailments led those stricken to have recourse to prayer and miracles. The relics of healing saints, the fountains and the holy sites dedicated to them, and certain sanctuaries consecrated to Our Lady thus attracted numerous blind pilgrims from all walks of life. But there were also “specialized” pilgrimage sites under the patronage of saints reputed to cure diseases of the eye either because of the etymology or sound of their names (Saints Clair or Claire, Saint Lucy)6 or because of the specific details of their personal history: Saint Paul—temporarily blinded\n\n from the middle ages to the classical age at the moment of his conversion; Saint Odile—abbess of the monastery of Hohenburg in Alsace at the beginning of the eighth century; Saint Léger—bishop of Autun in the seventh century and a martyr whose eyes were gouged out under torture. Recourse to this category of saints and other practices linked to the doctrine of signatures persisted until the nineteenth century. If hagiographic literature of the thirteenth century shows us blind pilgrims of different stations seeking cures and sometimes alms without passing negative judgment, comic literature and theater in the French vernacular of the same period paint a very different picture.\n\nDerision and Blindness The character of the blind beggar, miserable and pathetic, appears in one of the first examples of profane theater in French, a short comic play in two parts: The Boy and the Blind Man. This farce, doubtless initially a fairground spectacle mimicking a street scene taken from everyday life, originated in Tournai in the second half of the thirteenth century.7 It presents a blind beggar seeking a guide: “I must have sunk really low,” laments the blind man, “to not have even a youngster to bring me back home.”8 Unfortunately for him, he finds his man in the person of a wily, penniless boy who, after gaining the blind man’s confidence, takes advantage of his disability by stealing his savings. This play, which turns on deception, paints a deliberately unpleasant portrait of the blind man: he is a hypocrite who feigns piety in order to better collect alms. (In this way, he is a perfect fit with the social practices of his day, according to which the rich man gave to the poor to assure his own salvation—and this, in particular, thanks to the prayers of the recipient of his offering.) Sanctimonious, he is also a pseudo-pauper. Made rich by public charity, he is a miser who exploits his malady to accrue more and more money. Little by little, as his confidant wins his trust, he reveals his true nature: he’s a drunkard and a glutton, coarse, cynical, and debauched. The public, therefore, will not pity him when his valet strips him of his possessions, taking leave with these words, which express all the contempt that could be had for blind beggars at this time: “ ‘Shame on you! . . . To me, you are nothing but a piece of shit. You’re deceptive\n\nThe Middle Ages  and envious. . . . If you don’t like it, come and get me!’ ”9 The theme of the blind man duped by his guide—staged for the first time in this secular farce—had a long, bright future and provoked the laughter of theatergoers and readers of comic romances for centuries. Various examples can be found in medieval religious theater, in which the misadventures of the blind man and his (often lame) valet allow for burlesque interludes. The two disabled men sometimes dread a cure for fear of having to work, or they are cured in spite of themselves by a saint whose life and miracles are then celebrated or by Christ, in commemoration of the Passion. The blind of comedy, suspected of every vice—laziness, foolishness, vanity, hypocrisy, drunkenness, a passion for gambling, lust—are at times, deception of deceptions, suspected of feigning blindness itself. This is precisely the point of departure for a story written by Cortebarbe, The Three Blind Men of Compiègne. This fabliau, which made its first appearance in thirteenth-century Picardy, had a long posterity. The fabliau tells of the misadventure that befalls three blind beggars deceived by a cleric. The three blind comrades, without “a single valet to guide or to lead them,”10 take off on the road from Compiègne to Senlis. A cleric coming on horseback from Paris, accompanied by his squire, crosses paths with them and suspects them of faking their blindness. To put them to the test, he pretends to give them a beggar’s pouch. Each man thinks his companion has received it, and they all decide to return to Compiègne to “live it up a little” thanks to the unexpected offering. The cleric trails them to enjoy the rest of the adventure. The blind men, true to their reputation as drunkards and gluttons, enter an inn; they eat and drink more than they should and have a good bed prepared, in which they sleep “until an advanced hour of the morning.”11 The next day, the innkeeper comes to ask for his due. No pouch to be found. A dispute ensues between the three thieves, each of whom thinks the other has betrayed him. The innkeeper gets angry, threatens to throw them into the latrines, and has two clubs brought so as to beat them thoroughly. The cleric, “so delighted that he is convulsed with laughter,”12 plays innocent, demands an explanation, and then, feigning pity, pays the bill of the three blind men, who get off with only a fright. In this story, meant to be read in public—and of which we have found adaptations for the theater into the eighteenth century13 —the blind\n\n from the middle ages to the classical age are still presented in a pejorative fashion that prevents the spectators from feeling any pity and renders them indulgent toward the rascally trickster. Even if there are scenes in medieval religious theater that are not comic in the least, “in which the blind man is there only to let the grandeur of God and his saints shine forth through a miracle,”14 the literature of the period often depicts the blind as buffoons whose crude manners, clumsiness, and getups provoke laughter, or as pseudo-paupers to be tricked without remorse. This very caricatural representation of the blind poor doubtless reveals a certain type of attitude toward poverty and disability in a society torn “between a too-human reality and a too-lofty ideal.”15 Indeed, poverty, “the antithesis of all values,”16 before some people made it the very condition of their mystical quest, first appeared to medieval man “as a degrading aspect of the human condition, a form of humiliation and infamy with the weight of a malediction.”17 From this perspective, the poor beggar, suspected of laziness, lying, and vice, is regarded with condescension and a certain contempt. Moreover, despite the efforts of some theologians, such as Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century and Jean Gerson at the cusp of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, disability was often perceived as the visible mark of a transgression or an invisible moral defect: “The lame and the blind . . . are too lowly to be mentioned in front of good and honorable persons; if nature has reduced them to this point and stigmatized them, it is because they have a sin to expiate.”18 This sin could be their own or even that of their parents (especially in terms of the transgression of sexual taboos at the moment of a child’s conception). It is therefore not surprising that medieval literature was able to cast the blind beggar—whose disability symbolized blindness of the spirit and the dimming of intelligence—as a negative character who could be mercilessly laughed at by the public of farces and fabliaux, a public that came from all strata of society (and not just its lower orders). In the midst of the Hundred Years’ War, in a capital ceded to the English and a kingdom torn by civil war, derision was taken so far as to make a spectacle of real blind people during a cruel joust evoking circus games. The scene, known to all historians of disabilities, is recounted in the Journal of a Bourgeois of Paris and took place in 1425:19\n\nThe Middle Ages  The last Sunday of August, there was an entertainment at the Hôtel d’Armagnac on the rue Saint-Honoré for which four armored blind men were placed in a lists, each one a baton in hand, and in the lists there was a piglet that they could have if they were able to kill it. And so it was; and this made for a battle so strange, because they administered so many great blows to each other, that they were the worse for it, because however much they thought to strike the piglet, they struck each other, and if they had really been armed, they’d have killed each other. On Saturday, following the Sunday vigils, the said blind men were led through Paris in suits of armor and were preceded by a large banner on which there was the image of a pig, and in front of them, a man playing a tabret.20\n\nIn this scene where poor fellows are treated as fairground animals akin to the pig they aim to kill, we can see the most extreme relegation of the blind to a sphere of otherness on the part of a society that felt it had nothing in common with them save a charitable duty.21 We still wonder whether, in this “other” that the blind person represented, medieval society could recognize that obscure part of itself that it did not know what to do with for lack of available solutions: disease, incurable; poverty, endemic; violence, omnipresent—sin, in a word, the trace of which spectators could equally detect in themselves.22 Otherness, then, but a familiar otherness that could be exorcised by laughter23 at the expense of an affliction that was, moreover, quite feared at the time, as it is to this day. Whatever the most relevant interpretation of this—sometimes cruel—attitude of derisiveness toward the blind may be, medieval society, under the influence of the Church, demonstrated much more charitable behavior toward them at the same time.\n\nA Different View of the Blind? Charity and Sightlessness Among the disabled poor, “suffering members of the Community of Saints to whom the monk has lent his title ‘Poor of Christ,’ ”24 who received aid from all sorts of charities, the blind alone benefited from foundations specifically established with them in mind.25 The founding of these confraternities of the blind [aveugleries]26 was part of a broad movement to create hospitals that culminated in the thirteenth century, when\n\n from the middle ages to the classical age numerous hospitals, hospices [hôtels-Dieu], and monastic hospitals [maisons-Dieu] opened just about everywhere in the cities and countryside. This movement was inspired by the Church, at the time influenced by great spiritual trends whose culmination was an ideal of poverty funded by lay people (the Cistercian reform and the canonial movement of the twelfth century; founding of the mendicant orders in the thirteenth). These last hoped to make amends for their sins through the gesture of almsgiving itself, but they also counted on the prayers of the assisted poor—considered privileged intercessors with Christ—to obtain the salvation of their souls. Lastly, almsgiving was one ostentatious gesture among others for the wealthy, one that permitted them to show off their riches and grandeur. None of these reasons precludes a veritable generosity and a real concern for the poor on the part of some rich people. Whatever the profound motivations may have been, there was a general emulation from top to bottom of the social hierarchy,27 and it was inevitable that royal power, subject to “a double duty of justice and charity,”28 played an important role in these charitable foundations. Royal Power and the Blind: The Founding of the Quinze-Vingts The desire to provide for the most widespread miseries, to assist the greatest number of the sick and needy, often meant turning people afflicted with incurable diseases away from the new hospitals. It thus seemed necessary to found special institutions for them, of which the blind were often the first beneficiaries.29 Louis XI, who stayed frequently with the Cistercians of Royaumont and surrounded himself with Dominican and Franciscan counselors, took royal charity to its highest level. He also personally took care of the poor, particularly the blind poor. William of Saint Pathus recounts that once a week, generally on Saturdays, the king, wrapped in a shroud and on his knees, received the blind and washed their feet before sitting down with them to eat, at which point he himself helped them: “He guided the hands of the poor man to the platter and taught him how to hold it. And when there was a blind or paralyzed person and there was fish before him, the blessed king took the piece of fish and diligently removed the bones with his own hands, dipped it in sauce, and then put it in the mouth of the sick person.”30\n\nThe Middle Ages  After the failure of the Seventh Crusade (1248–54), the circumstances and the king’s piety, redoubled by a keen concern for justice and penitence, favored the establishment of a hospice destined to welcome a congregation of three hundred “poor blind people from the city of Paris,”31 and called for that reason the “Quinze-Vingts.”32 Perhaps a confraternity of the blind existed before the foundation of the hospital. That, after all, would have been in keeping with the spirit of free association born at that time along with the communal movement.33 We do not know, just as we do not know the exact date of the founding of the Quinze-Vingts, whose original charter has been lost.34 According to a bull of July 23, 1260, we know only that construction had been finished at the end of the preceding June—the chosen location having been situated outside the PhilippeAuguste’s city walls near the Porte Saint-Honoré, where the home for the blind remained until 1780. In any case, for almost three centuries (until 1546), the Quinze-Vingts functioned as a congregation, and its “government,” relatively democratic, resembled that of the mendicant orders. The blind lived together according to a common rule, after having given the home both their persons and their property, of which they conserved the usufruct, contrary to true monks or friars. They pronounced no vows of chastity either and could be admitted to the community with their spouses. A master or headmaster, named by the king at the suggestion of his almoner, directed them with the help of a minister and six sworn members chosen by the community, whereas all members participated in running the home through weekly chapter assemblies. The minister—in contrast to the master—had to be married, since certain tasks fell to his wife, who assumed the role of nurse and foster mother. Upon entering the brotherhood, each member had to swear before the entire chapter to keep the secrets of the house and not to reveal them to anyone, even to his family, a feature common to all confraternal societies of the period. Though secular, the congregation obtained authorization to build a chapel35 dedicated to Saint Remy and ministered by a chaplain appointed by the king. On July 23, 1260, a bull of Alexander IV granted indulgences to all those who left alms in the collection box of the hospital. From its founding, the Quinze-Vingts thus benefited from numerous privileges granted by both ecclesiastic authorities and temporal powers. Straightaway, Louis IX accorded it an annuity of thirty livres parisis\n\n from the middle ages to the classical age from the Chatelet to be used for food for the blind. Royal benevolence toward the Quinze-Vingts remained unfailing, and donations in perpetuity, occasional alms, and, especially, exemption from taxes contributed to the fortune of the community. In addition, numerous bequests and private donations,36 stimulated by royal patronage, enhanced the hospital’s legacy. In theory, only the king decided upon the admission of boarders, who were proposed by the almoner or the master; in practice, the almoner mostly made his selection single-handedly. The Royal Almonry, which seems to have been established around 1190,37 actually managed all the hospices founded by royalty. According to the rule given to the QuinzeVingts after 1350 by Michel de Brache, almoner of King John the Good, a blind person applying to the Quinze-Vingts had to be at least sixteen years of age and self-sufficient. It may be that in the beginning, the congregation included only blind people. In any event, the regulations of Michel de Brache anticipated: “in the home and hospice of the Quinze-Vingt . . . 300 persons, no more no less, or 152 blind men, 60 sighted people, as much to go to distant places as to guide and advise the others within Paris and . . . 88 women . . . both blind and sighted, according to the discretion of the almoner or the request of pledged members.”38 In exchange for the privileges and donations accorded the hospital, community members prayed day and night and as often as possible for the king, queen, royal family, and, more generally, for all benefactors. It was also their task to aid those condemned to death in their final moments and, in the manner of mendicant brothers and certain confraternities, to keep vigil and pray at the side of the deceased if asked to do so in the event of a Parisian burgher’s death. Beyond these various religious obligations, and apart from a few individual tasks that fell to blind men within the community (the bell ringer and the crier were blind, as well as the managers of taverns situated within its walls), the main job of the blind poor of the Quinze-Vingts was the solicitation of charity: the quest for money that, in its totality, had to be brought back to the community and deposited in the Treasury, and the solicitation of bread, the so-called besace,39 which was divided equally between the master of the hospital and the collector. When they took up the collection, the blind were usually accompanied by sighted or partially\n\nThe Middle Ages  sighted brothers and sisters whom the Rule stipulated must “gently and truly lead the blind on their quests for alms and elsewhere.”40 When they went outside their community, the brothers and sisters had to don the “uniform” of the hospital—a robe and a coat slit on the side for the men and a robe and apron for the women. After 1312, the clothing had to be embroidered with the insignia Philip the Fair at that time gave the Quinze-Vingts in memory of the establishment’s royal founding: a full fleur-de-lis in saffron-colored brass (situated above the container they wore around their necks for the collection). This insignia made it possible to distinguish them from the jumble of other blind beggars.41 The importance accorded collections—undertaken daily—and the uniform and insignia they donned meant the blind of the Quinze-Vingts were first and foremost beggars, but privileged beggars, favored with royal protection in an age when mendicant orders were held in high esteem. Their cry: “For the Quinze-Vingts, the bread of God!” and their silhouette supported by the double-tipped cane, “indispensable element of the brothers’ personal property,”42 were well known in Paris and even beyond, since the group was authorized to beg outside city walls. If their uncertain step and their insistent supplications provoked the mockery of a Rutebeuf,43 the Quinze-Vingts aroused envy, and Saint Louis’s establishment soon gave rise to imitations, most notably in Chartres, where, in 1292, Renaud Barbou the Elder, former counselor of Louis IX and Philip the Bold, constructed a house destined to “lodge, take in, and console the blind poor and other wretches from the city”44 outside the city walls. The founding of this hospital was authorized by letters patent of Philip the Fair in 1291, and in 1294, the bishop of Chartres permitted the consecration of a chapel for the blind. The establishment was a smaller but faithful copy of the Parisian congregation, and it welcomed 120 poor people, blind and sighted, who lived communally from the fruit of their solicitations. Even their name, the “Six-Vingts,” was modeled on that of the hospice in Paris, and in 1356, De Brache gave them a rule comparable to the one he had drafted some time earlier for the Parisian hospice. Like the Quinze-Vingts, the Six-Vingts had the right to collect charity throughout the kingdom and, claiming also to be of royal foundation, they obtained authorization to wear the fleur-de-lis topped by a little crescent. However, in the streets of Paris where they came to beg,\n\n from the middle ages to the classical age disagreements arose between them and the mendicants of the QuinzeVingts. It was thus that in 1350, John the Good had to settle the matter: the Chartres contingent would keep the fleur-de-lis but had to wear it below their collection container. The form of the insignia worn by each hospice was also carefully established. Lastly, the Six-Vingts would be able to send but four collectors and a servant to Paris.45 Other hospices for the blind would be founded in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. As Brigitte Gauthier noted in her dissertation on blindness and the blind in the Middle Ages, all these foundings took place in provinces north of the Loire, in a zone of great urban concentration.46 The city, then as now, was a place where a significant population of the poor and the marginal gathered together. Among them were numerous disabled people who the spiritual and temporal powers felt the need both to assist and to control. Before the fifteenth century, though, it seems that these institutions were not of a coercive nature. On the contrary, far from considering themselves victims of some kind of “police” power, the blind of the Quinze-Vingts—who were housed, partly fed and clothed, nursed when sick, exempt from all kinds of taxes, had a say in their own affairs, and whose children were educated within the community—were quite conscious of their privileges and ready to defend them bitterly, as they demonstrated in the conflict with the blind from Chartres. It was thus that the royal hospice, soon open to blind people throughout the kingdom, shortly found itself unable to meet too numerous demands, while the confraternities founded outside of Paris never managed to sufficiently develop themselves to relieve the Parisian establishment. By founding the Quinze-Vingts at the same moment that he was undertaking a major reform of the royal administration in the name of morality and justice,47 Saint Louis did not, then, bring a comprehensive solution to the misery suffered by the poor of his kingdom, nor even of the city of Paris. Besides, that had not been the goal of the foundation, which, for all its royal pedigree, was in certain respects a private act of charity by which the most prestigious suzerain of a still-feudal state manifested his piety as much as his interest in social control. Nor did the establishment of the Quinze-Vingts contribute to transforming the representation of blindness and the blind. On the contrary, the statutes of the hospice, by making alms collection the principal activity of its members, guaranteed\n\nThe Middle Ages  the association between blindness and begging, already so entrenched in practice and perception. Even privileged, the blind of the Quinze-Vingts remained beggars, and as such, they were still objects of mockery as much as pity. Though not without compassion, charitable disposition toward blindness therefore tended to maintain the blind in a sphere of alterity. But by supporting the congregation of the blind poor in Paris, Saint Louis demonstrated, for the first time in the history of the French kingdom, the responsibility the institution of monarchy had for disabled people, and he paved the way for the state to take on a social problem previously abandoned to the Church or to individual generosity. The close ties between the Quinze-Vingts and the monarchy were confirmed in 1387 by a bull of the Pope of Avignon, Clement VII, who took the hospice out from under the authority of the bishop of Paris and entrusted its spiritual jurisdiction to the king’s almoner. This measure turned the Quinze-Vingts into a veritable fiefdom of the almoner (who had lodgings and a personal office there) and the nucleus from which he progressively extended his authority—and that of royal power—over a greater number of charitable institutions. “Never really excluded because always spiritually integrated; never integrated because always socially on the fringes,”48 the indigent blind of the Middle Ages seem to be the archetype of the disabled poor, “suffering members of the community of saints.”49 The essentially religious and eschatological ambitions of the founders of specialized hospices—without excluding the idea of a certain social control—dispensed with any notions that the individuals assisted could be economically viable. The possibility of some kind of intellectual or professional formation of the residents doubtless never crossed the minds of those in charge. It would take the evolution of religious sentiment and attitudes toward poverty, followed by the emergence of the subject and the advent of a new anthropology, for pedagogues and reformers of public services to conceive of educating the blind by appealing to the resources of vicariance and of putting the poor in their midst to work.\n\nchapter 2\n\nThe Beginning of Modern Times\n\nThe impoverishment of the laboring masses and the growth in the number of mendicants and vagabonds at the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of modern times have been commented on at length by historians of poverty in the West. Victims of wars, economic crisis, and unemployment, the “new poor,” errant and undernourished, were also the first victims of plagues, whose cycles cast a pall over Europe beginning in 1348. The attitude toward beggars—and especially toward vagabonds— went from ambivalent to increasingly hostile, and for sanitary as well as social reasons, the end of the Middle Ages began to conceive of policing the poor in several European cities.1 At first, however, these measures were directed only at able-bodied beggars: mendicancy (but not vagrancy) was still tolerated for poor people incapable of working because of age or infirmity. Ecclesiastical institutions, confraternities, and municipalities shared responsibility for charitable organizations, while in France, the almoner of the king did not yet oversee the royally founded hospices (or those reputed to be so).\n\nThe Evolution of Public Institutions and the Reform of the Quinze-Vingts Things began to change dramatically in the first quarter of the sixteenth century, a time of “decisive social and economic crisis, after which\n\nThe Beginning of Modern Times  it was no longer possible to live or govern in the same way as before.”2 A great reform movement seeking to laicize urban charitable institutions tried to respond to the widespread nature of destitution, while theoreticians became aware of correlations between poverty and employment. In France, state intervention in hospice affairs rivaled municipal intervention, and in 1519 the king’s almoner was given the title “Grand Almoner of France.” In 1520, Francis I entrusted him with the administration of the hospices and asylums of the realm: different establishments not founded by the king also fell under his control, while parliaments increasingly exercised their jurisdiction over hospice matters. Thus, on September 6, 1522, the Parliament of Paris registered the new rule given to the Hospice of the Quinze-Vingts by the Grand Almoner, François de Molins.3 This reform came at a time when numerous abuses on the part of the hospital administration had led to a serious misunderstanding between the Grand Almoner, the master, the minister, and the chapter, and when the community, having run out of resources, consisted of no more than “twenty-five or thirty-five brothers and sisters, both blind and sighted.”4 The rule took up the essentials of Michel de Brache’s statutes, while adding a certain number of items accentuating their coercive nature, most notably when it came to religious obligations (items 1 and 3); chapter attendance and “good behavior” during assemblies (items 9 and 10); religious education (item 4); and the apprenticing of the sighted children of congregation members (item 41). Finally, the comings and goings of the brothers and sisters were monitored through the creation of the position of porter (item 18). It was specified that the ordinances must “be read within the chapter four times a year . . . lest the officers, brothers, and sisters of the said household claim ignorance of them” (item 50).5 The obligation to wear the fleur-de-lis “when attending royal processions, Mass and all solemn festivals, when going to the chapter [and . . . ] when taking up the collection . . . in the churches of Paris and beyond” was not mentioned in the Rule of 1522. It was, on the other hand, the object of the last two items (14 and 15) of the oath of the Quinze-Vingts decreed on October 12, 1523, by the Parliament of Paris, an “oath that every brother and sister must take upon their admission.”6 In an age when authorized mendicants were obliged to wear a badge in a certain number of cities,7 the reminder of this obligation may indicate that there was reluctance on the part of blind people to wear the hospital emblem, which previously had not been a sign of stigmatization, but this is just a hypothesis.\n\n from the middle ages to the classical age Beyond these diverse measures, the Rule of 1522 fixed the number of blind and sighted brothers and sisters at “one hundred and forty [sixvingts] blind brothers,”8 “sixty sighted brothers . . . and eighty-eight blind and sighted women,” and prescribed that “all be native to this kingdom and provide letters of naturalization.”9 That said, the Quinze-Vingts was open to blind people from throughout the realm (and this, from the first third of the fifteenth century at least) and authorized its members to reside in the provinces if they so desired. But the most important measure Francis I took with regard to the Quinze-Vingts concerned the hospital’s form of government. The statutes of François de Molins had endowed the chapter with a council consisting of six governors, to whom the Grand Almoner intended to delegate a part of his responsibilities. Dissension between the governors and the chapter, the feeble rate of the participation of the blind in the assemblies, and their unruliness during meetings inspired the king to make another reform, the edict of 1546 “enacted at Fontainebleau, in the month of May,” which took “from the brothers and sisters of the Quinze-Vingts the right to determine together the interests of the establishment.”10 From then on, those who attended and had a say in the chapters, assemblies, and congregations were the six governors, the master, the minister, the two sworn sighted members, the porter (as a brother), and the clerk or his assistant. Also in attendance would be eight hospital brothers—four sighted and four blind—elected “by all the said governors, masters, ministers, sworn members, and brothers together or those who will be present the day of the general chapter of the said hospital, which is the day of Saint John the Baptist.”11 On February 26, 1547, by request of the governors, master, minister, sworn members, and brothers, the court modified the edict by adding four blind men to the chapter and revoking the porter’s deliberative voice.12 As the Abbé Prompsault remarked in his Notes on the QuinzeVingts, this reform was a “veritable revolution that took authority out of the hands of the blind and distorted the work of Saint Louis. In place of a republic protected by a king who named its president, there was a simple aggregate directed by the Grand Almoner of Paris, under special protection of the sovereign, and to which was accorded the right of surveillance and of appeal.”13\n\nThe Beginning of Modern Times  These arrangements, whose consequences would still be measurable at the end of the eighteenth century, are hardly surprising on the part of a sovereign who favored lay control of hospitals and the creation of the Bureau of the Poor of Paris in 1544. Nevertheless, while the repression of vagrancy and mendicancy was being organized in France, the Parliament of Paris and several provincial parliaments confirmed the rights of the Quinze-Vingts alms-seekers, whose freedom to circulate throughout the kingdom was facilitated and to whom the Parliament of Paris granted, with regard to begging, the same privileges as the alms-seekers of the Hôtel-Dieu. Brought to heel when it came to running their own house and better monitored by the imposition of a more restrictive rule than that of the past, the blind members of the Quinze-Vingts remained “good poor people,” and apparently it occurred to no one to insist they do “work” beyond alms-seeking. This did not prevent some of the Quinze-Vingts members from practicing a trade to supplement insufficient incomes. Le Grand mentions, for instance, that at the time, blind women assiduously spun thread at home and that the spinning wheel often figured in the inventory of goods they left behind at their death.14 Blind brothers, for their part, owned some of the taverns built on hospice grounds to provide the enclosure’s inhabitants with wine and other foodstuffs necessary to their subsistence. Attempts of the Grand Almoner to introduce the use of a shared table during the course of the 1520 reform having come to naught, the blind continued, in effect, to take their meals in their little lodgings and to get provisions at the stores set up inside the walls.15 A few decades later, in 1602, one blind fabric weaver requested permission to have a companion to “set up his work.”16 These same professions, and some others, would be inventoried at the Quinze-Vingts right in the middle of the nineteenth century. But if the various administrations that succeeded one another at the helm of the hospital always encouraged these industrious activities, before the Consulate and the Empire, none obliged the blind to work, because their disability was widely perceived as a major obstacle to practicing a trade. And yet—\n\n from the middle ages to the classical age\n\nThe Reformers of Assistance and Work for the Blind In 1526, in Bruges, Juan-Luis Vivès, a Spanish humanist living in the Netherlands, published a treatise, De subventione pauperum,17 considered the “cornerstone of the humanist program for reform and social welfare.”18 Following Thomas More and Erasmus, Vivès had praise for work: “Above all else, we must decree the law the Lord imposed on all mankind as penalty and reparation for original sin, namely: that each man eat the bread acquired by his own sweat and toil. . . . No poor man, whose age and health permit him to work, should be allowed to remain idle.”19 If he recommends “taking into consideration age and failing health,”20 a bit later he still decrees: Not even the blind shall be allowed to remain idle; there are many things they can do. Some have a literary disposition, provided that someone read to them. Let them study, for we observe that a number of them make progress in erudition that is not to be disdained. Others have a talent for music: let them sing and play string and wind instruments. Let others work at the press houses to help maneuver the wine presses, and may others do their utmost at the bellows in the workshops of blacksmiths. We know that the blind make boxes, baskets, trays, and cages, and that blind women spin and wind skeins. In sum, if they neither wish to be unemployed nor to flee work, they will easily find something to keep themselves occupied. Laziness or indolence, and not a bodily defect, is the only excuse they may put forward for doing nothing.21\n\nThis text is of interest for several reasons. First of all, it provides a detailed and argued list of intellectual, artistic, and manual work accessible to the blind at the time of Vivès, who presents these examples as empirical facts: “we observe,” “we know that,” and not as petty hypotheses. Furthermore, in Bruges at the beginning of the century, there was a home for the blind [aveuglerie] where Vivès had perhaps observed boarders engaging in some of these occupations—in the manner of the blind of the QuinzeVingts in Paris. Regarding the blind with “a literary disposition,” Pierre Villey evokes the existence of two blind men of the day hailing from the Netherlands, men Vivès doubtless knew by reputation. The first, Nicasius van Voerden, born around 1440 in the region of Malines and blind as a result of\n\nThe Beginning of Modern Times  smallpox, had studied philosophy at the University of Leuven. A master of arts and then bachelor of theology and doctor of law, he had taught humanities at Malines, then canon law and civil law at the University of Cologne. Furthermore, the pope had authorized him to receive the sacrament of the order in spite of his blindness.22 The second, Petrus Pontanus, born in Bruges between 1475 and 1479, taught humanities at the college of Boncours in Paris, where he himself had been a student. Perhaps Vivès had met this accomplished humanist, an admirer of Erasmus and correspondent of Lefèvre d’Etaples, who died in Paris in 1529.23 Whatever the case, and whatever the examples that inspired him, Vivès was certainly qualified to prove, as he affirmed, that the blind “if they neither wish[ed] to be unemployed nor to flee work [ . . . would] easily find something to keep themselves busy.”24 But the interest of this text does not only reside in its enumeration of activities engaged in by a certain number of blind people at the beginning of the sixteenth century—and doubtless earlier. Indeed, Vivès, proponent of a desacralization of poverty and of almsgiving that would have as its consequence the secularization of welfare, grounded his theories in a new religious morality, according to which work acquired the value of redemption. He therefore intended to impose the law of salvific work on everyone and to prove, in support of his theory, that even the blind, who were traditionally turned into mendicants, could be educated and put to work. Vivès was neither particularly interested in blindness nor in the blind: he only cited them as an example to better prove the cogency of a theory that aimed to integrate inactive groups into the economic life of the city so as to render them productive. However, by claiming to subject the blind to “the law the Lord imposed on all mankind,” Vivès was, to our knowledge, the first theoretician who refused to treat them differently from humanity as a whole. This, in our opinion, is the major interest of his text. Vivès’s treatise, which served the movement to reform municipal charity by providing it with ideological arguments and by suggesting certain practical steps to combat mendicancy, was quite popular in Europe. It had, however, no effect on putting the blind to work, which in the short term was rather to their advantage, given the way mercantilist theses were being applied to able-bodied beggars at the time. Already divided over the interdiction of begging, people were doubtless\n\n from the middle ages to the classical age even more hesitant to implement forced labor for the disabled—particularly for the blind. What we can retain from the humanist theories of welfare is that they prepared the ground for the process of desacralization of poverty and disability that would result, at the end of the eighteenth century, in the first attempts at mainstreaming the blind poor through education and work.\n\n“How a Blind Man Can Be Taught to Write” Whereas Vivès recommended rendering the blind useful to society through studies, music, or manual labor, two other humanists, Pedro Mexia and Girolamo Cardano, inspired by a dialogue by Erasmus,25 evoked the possibility of teaching them to write using tablets engraved with the letters of the alphabet. Pedro Mexia, a Spaniard like Vivès, was the author of a compilation, Silva de varia leccion, published in Seville in 1543, translated into French by Claude Gruget in 155226 and reprinted until 1619 with ample augmentations. In the third part of this work, consecrated to the invention of letters, Mexia vaunts the merits of printing, according to him “the best invention in the world.”27 Then he comes to speak, not of the blind’s access to culture thanks to the distribution of printed books, but of the way some of them have learned to write: Tablets were made of porphyry or bone or metal, and on these were engraved all the letters, beginning with a, b, and c. The blind person then took a burin with a tip so sharp and fine that he could easily move it through all the letters engraved on the tablet, having someone guide his hand. And he did this so many times that he could feel, by exploring with his fingertips, the form of each of the letters. And he got so accustomed to this that little by little, and with great care, the image of each of the letters impressed itself upon his memory, and afterward, he taught himself to make them on something other than the tablet such that sometimes he failed and sometimes he succeeded. He finally learned, so he wrote with a pen what he represented to himself in his mind.28\n\nNot long after Mexia, Girolamo Cardano, who at the time was the most reputed doctor in Europe after Vesalius, explained in turn, in a work entitled De Subtilitate, published in Nuremberg in 1550, “How a blind\n\nThe Beginning of Modern Times  man can be taught to write.”29 This work, translated into French by Richard Le Blanc in 1556, was to be reedited in France up until 1642. The method described by Cardano is identical to that depicted by Mexia a few years earlier, but the Milanese scholar insisted more than his predecessor on the difficulties of this training, which could only be accomplished, he said, “with great difficulty and labor”: “And he will have to be faithfully admonished and to continue for a long time.”30 He thus concluded that such an undertaking was futile: “It’s an admirable thing but of little use.”31 Upon reading these texts, which were widely circulated in several languages and for nearly a century, we may ask ourselves why the principle of blind people’s access to written culture did not hold the attention of a period otherwise favorable to the spread of writing, thanks to the invention of printing and the influence of the Reformation. Cardano’s conclusion provides a partial response to our question: in effect, since antiquity, there had been cultivated blind men who, in order to read and write, made do with readers who also served as secretaries. Vivès, in the text cited above, even alluded to this practice. That some of these scholars felt the desire to learn (or relearn) how to write in order to acquire a certain independence—and that they were able to do so—must certainly have been seen as an admirable but superfluous thing, given the customs of the time in the circles in which such people were to be found. In well-to-do circles, it was perfectly normal to employ all kinds of servants, including secretaries, and in clerical circles, it was equally easy to recruit readers and scribes. As for having blind commoners read or write, that was a long ways away, despite pedagogical efforts with regard to the populace inspired by the two Reformations. If people had been ready, it is probable that the century of the printing press would have not only found the means to teach the blind to write—which is effectively difficult and can be taught only with limited success to formerly sighted people who already know how—but especially to read, by printing books in relief. In this regard, as Le Grand noted in his book on the Quinze-Vingts, “it would be interesting” to know the nature and methods of instruction that the hospice school employed for the twenty or so blind children taken in and raised at the infirmary from that time on. Unfortunately, the texts we possess are absolutely silent on the subject.32 Doubtless they were\n\n from the middle ages to the classical age taught first of all “to practice Christian piety and to judge things with rectitude,” as Vivès recommended in the chapter of his treatise on welfare dedicated to the care of children.33 Doubtless, too, they were taught, as were the sighted children of congregation members, chant and psalmody. But we don’t know if they were, as these last, introduced to the rudiments of primary education. Whatever the germ of an evolution of mentalities suggested by Vivès’s proposals and the elaboration of palliative techniques reported by Mexia and Cardano may have been, it would seem that they were seriously threatened by ideas and attitudes hardly favorable to both putting the blind poor to work and educating them. On the one hand, as we have already stressed, the traditionally minded religious were troubled by the theses recommending that the disabled poor be put to work; on the other, the education of the blind came up against prejudices about disabilities that Cardano himself—despite being one of the most illustrious scholars of his time—had echoed. Indeed, we can read in the twelfth book of De Subtilitate:34 “We are accustomed to calling “cripples” those who are blind, deaf, one-eyed, six-fingered, and such monsters of nature that have loose morals”35 [emphasis ours]. Cardano’s judgment of the disabled is particularly severe when it comes to hunchbacks, the blind, and those blind in one eye: “If all cripples are bad . . . the worst of all are hunchbacks, seeing as how the imperfection is in the area of the heart, principle of the whole body. Next come the blind and those blind in one eye, because nature failed in the area of the brain.”36 To prejudices against disabilities linked to the state of medical knowledge at the time can lastly be added the arguments of Platonizing philosophers in favor of vision, which the invention of printing, the birth of modern optics, and the development of optical instruments definitively placed at the top of the hierarchy of senses. Many people of the day probably thought—as Leonardo Da Vinci wrote in Paragone—that “to lose one’s sight was . . . to be like a man shut alive inside a tomb where he could live and move.”37 Under these conditions, even if it was known that “there have nevertheless been several blind men who were persons of great renown, in whom nature compensated with understanding what was lacking in vision,”38 it could indeed seem futile to torment the poor wretches, “deprived of the beauty of the universe,”39 with training at once painful and “of little use,” to take up the expression used by Cardano.\n\nThe Beginning of Modern Times \n\nThe Representations of Blindness in Fiction and in Iconography In fictional literature, the combination of old representations and new observations is illustrated by the first episode of a short narrative, The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes, His Fortunes and Misfortunes, the first of the picaresque novels. This facetious work, of which the oldest editions date to 1553 or 155440 and of which a French translation was first printed in Lyon in 1560, had great success in France and went through numerous new editions.41 It tells the burlesque adventures of a young “picaro” rogue who begins his “active” life in the service of an old blind man who introduces him to the jargon and all the ruses of the profession of roguery. “At his job, he was an ace,”42 recounts the narrator, identifying with young Lazarillo:43 What’s more, he had a thousand other ways of extracting money. He claimed to know prayers for multiple situations. . . . In the way of medicine, he claimed to know two times as much as Galen. . . . So much so that everyone was after him, especially women, who swallowed whole anything he told them: he thus took great advantage of them . . . and he earned more in a month than a hundred blind men do in a year.44\n\nLazarillo, who is in good hands, does not miss an opportunity to dupe the malicious blind man, who nonetheless gives him a thrashing for the slightest prank and barely provides him with enough to eat. We can recognize, in this disagreeable blind man and the cheeky youngster who serves as his guide, the traditional “couple” of medieval comic theater. The association of the two characters was so successful in this short episode that the first name “Lazarillo” became a common way of designating, in Castilian, a child who guides a blind person.45 Yet the anonymous author of this “intentionally comic book . . . that incorporates a whole preexisting literature of playful tales”46 innovated with respect to his predecessors. A “master-in-beggary,” Lazarillo’s blind man is no longer the easily deceived fool of medieval farce. He uses touch, hearing, and smell remarkably well to compensate for his disability and to thwart the tricks of the scamp Lazarillo, who tests, at his own expense, the powers of observation, “intuition,” “sagacity,” and “subtlety” of the “clever blind man.” If it is true that these qualities are what the blind man uses to dupe the naive, they are also what enable him to survive and to avoid\n\n from the middle ages to the classical age the ambushes of an uncertain existence. Thus, from the beginning of this episode, which opens the story of his adventures, Lazarillo pays homage to his blind master, “because [he says] after God, it was really he who gave birth to me and who, blind though he was, enlightened me and put me on the road of life.”47 This paradoxical homage is probably not without irony, because the “lights” of such a master could only put Lazarillo on the dark road of sanctimoniousness and illegitimate mendicancy, “bêtes noirs” of religious reformers and humanist theoreticians of welfare. In addition, when describing his master, Lazarillo occasionally uses terms like crafty, wily, accursed, and satanic, which might suggest some diabolical connivance. Without engaging in a social critique of this text,48 we have to admit that the blind man is presented in a manner that, if not totally negative, is at least extremely ambiguous. We recognize the talent of the sensible man who fully avails himself of the resources of vicariousness, but we are wary of him, because “all cripples are bad,” as Cardano wrote at exactly the same time. What the blind man has lost in foolishness, with respect to the caricature of folkloric tales and medieval theater, he makes up for in malice. And the “satanic blind man’s” very qualities of perspicacity and keenness could be perceived, by those inclined to the irrational, as one more proof of his pact with the underworld. Whatever the possibilities for a dual reading of a text at the very least ambiguous with respect to blindness and the blind, this is a story that should, above all, be read as intentionally comic. With the pictorial representation of the blind and blindness offered by Bruegel the Elder about a dozen years later, laughter, in our opinion, gives way to shock, something that does not, however, authorize us to prejudge the public for which it was destined. The Parable of the Blind 49 in the National Museum of Naples was painted in 1568 to illustrate the adage of Christ in Matthew 15:14: “Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.” This parable, which originally applied to the Pharisees, was used by preachers from the thirteenth century on as an example of the senseless behavior of the blind in spirit.50 Before Bruegel, whose version is today considered “definitive”51 by art historians, the subject had been illustrated by several painters and engravers, and in particular by Hieronymus Bosch,\n\nThe Beginning of Modern Times  Breugel’s “spiritual father.”52 Though they fail in their attempts to explain Bruegel’s religious convictions, several of those who specialize in his work agree that the painting is “not about the blind, but about faith53 and heresy.”54,55 Hence, beyond the dreadfully realistic image56 of these beings with empty stares and a staggering gait, the painter made his contemporaries see something entirely different from the social and human condition alone of the poor wretches, subject by disability and poverty to the dangers of a wandering life. For us, “respectable voyeurs . . . roused from our torpor”57 by the spectacle of the blind man at the right of the painting who looks at us with his gaping stare, how can we not think of what Jean-Pierre Vernant wrote about the Gorgon: “To look Gorgo in the eyes is to find oneself face to face with the beyond in its terrifying dimension, to exchange glances with an eye that, endlessly staring at us, is the negation of the gaze, to welcome a light whose blinding brilliance is that of night.”58 Whether they provoked laughter or horror, the blind at the beginning of the modern era were on the side of misdeed—sin or heresy—and despite the open-mindedness of certain humanist authors, blindness was still the object of feelings too ambiguous to produce a real revolution in the social treatment of those afflicted with it. The Quinze-Vingts remained the sole important institution reserved for the blind poor, and aside from the strengthening of royal authority over the establishment, nothing really new happened with respect to the previous centuries. The boarders of the hospice—whose principal occupation remained alms-seeking—were looked on as privileged beggars at a time when mendicancy was nonetheless the object of ever more severe repression. By maintaining the prerogatives of the blind of the royal hospice, the monarchy thus contributed to the perpetuation of the age-old image of the blind beggar.\n\nchapter 3\n\nGroundwork for a History of Blindness in the Classical Age\n\nThe Blind and the “Great Confinement” We might expect the classical age to have contributed something new to the domain of welfare for the blind, and in fact, The Royal Edict Establishing the Hôpital Général to Confine Poor Mendicants of the City and Suburbs of Paris, decreed in Paris in April 1656, did concern blind and other beggars. Indeed, this text prohibited the poor from begging, whether they were “able-bodied or disabled [emphasis added], sick or convalescent, curable or incurable,” and the Rule the King Would Like Followed at the Hôpital Général 1 anticipated cases of blind people: “Beggars with incurable blindness will likewise be admitted to the said Hôpital Général until there is space for them at the Hospice of the Quinze-Vingts and at the Incurables, upon the advice and consent of the directors of the said hospices.”2 Yet, while the interdiction of begging came down on the poor “of the city and suburbs of Paris,” “without any exception . . . under penalty of whipping . . . for the first offense and of being sent to the galleys for men and boys and banishment for women and girls for the second,”3 article IX of the 1656 edict stipulated, “It is not our intention to extend the above interdictions to other people who have the right to take up the collection or to seek alms.”4 Thus, at the very moment the monarchy was putting an unprecedented system in place for the repression of mendicancy, the blind of the Quinze-Vingts had their particular status confirmed.\n\nGroundwork for a History of Blindness in the Classical Age  There is more: the article just cited from the 1656 edict ordered “the blind, children, and others having a right to seek alms” to remain “at the doors of churches or near their collection boxes, with a prohibition against begging elsewhere inside churches under penalty of being stripped of their right.”5 Now, by request of the hospice and thanks to the intervention of the Queen Regent,6 a letter from the king dated May 4, 1657, revisited this interdiction and accorded the Quinze-Vingts “the freedom to seek alms throughout churches in their customary manner.” 7 The Hôpital Général’s objection to this decision was rejected by parliament,8 and in letters patent of March 7, 1659, Louis XIV definitively confirmed the alms-seeking privileges that Saint Louis had granted the Quinze-Vingts.9 Far from being put to work as the mercantilist ethic would have had it—and which did lead, in 1666, to the creation of workshops within the confines of the Hôpital Général—the blind of the Quinze-Vingts continued to be treated according to the medieval ethos of charity, founded on the exchange of alms for prayer. Was not one of the reasons invoked to grant them freedom to seek alms “throughout churches,” that in remaining “at the doors of churches or near their collection boxes,” as ordained by the edict of 1556, “they would be unable to say the prayers the faithful desired of them?”10 Respect for dynastic engagements vis-à-vis the Quinze-Vingts, considered first and foremost to be a religious community? Distress of the devout in the upper echelons of the state (Anne of Austria had personally intervened on behalf of the blind) in the face of the application of new legislative and police measures against mendicancy of every category without exception? It was always during those times particularly harsh for idlers recalcitrant to the ethos of salvation through work that the blind of the Quinze-Vingts seemed the quintessential aristocrats of mendicancy. But behind all that, we should see the implicit conviction that if blindness made people de facto “incapable of work,” mendicancy continued, of necessity, to be the only means of subsistence for the blind of the laboring class. Alms-seeking remained, in any event, the only contribution to the hospice required of Quinze-Vingts members. And we can easily imagine, from certain documents pertaining to the Quinze-Vingts, that no work was required of the blind who were promptly locked up there, along with other beggars of the city of Paris.11 For the blind were among the poor that\n\n from the middle ages to the classical age Pajot de la Chapelle,12 in a report of August 15, 1688, for the Intendant of Ile-de-France, proposed to take off the hands of the Hôpital Général.13 There, they were doubtless considered—as were those “ordinary sick people,” the venereally diseased, madmen and madwomen, and abandoned children—a completely useless burden, incapable of being rehabilitated through work. The evolution of welfare practices during the seventeenth century, if it allowed for the confinement of a number of blind mendicants and vagabonds, contributed nothing to their education through work. Condemned to idleness inside the walls of the Hôpital Général, restricted to their role of “authorized mendicants” when they were admitted to the Quinze-Vingts, the blind poor maintained an official status as inactive at the very heart of a society hostile toward inactivity. The century of the “Great Confinement” was also, for similar reasons and more, that of the creation of schools of charity, the collèges"
