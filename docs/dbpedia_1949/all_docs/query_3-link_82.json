While those who knew Gilles, who was perhaps more familiar to them under the name of Hans Miller, insist that his relative in the west is wealthy and that he comes from well to do parents in Germany, failure to get any response of messages, led to the decision to bury Gilles in Two Rivers. Martin Smith, Port Washington, a fellow baker came here yesterday and although he said he had known Gilles ever since the latter came to this country from Germany, he said he did not feel that he could provide for the burial of the deceased, but believed that the relatives would be heard from shortly. It was reported that Gilles carried a $2000 insurance policy, but investigation developed that he had allowed the payments to lapse. Gilles came to Two Rivers five months ago to be employed at the Sally Ann bakery here. Little was known of his relatives and little information was gained from letters found among his effects. His fiancée, a Two Rivers young lady, could throw little light on the matter of Gilles' relatives. This resulted in a decision to bury Gilles at Two Rivers. Since the death the body had been at the Charles Jansky undertaking parlors. Manitowoc Herald News, September 7, 1927 P.6\n\nHENRY B. GIRONIMI Henry B.
