        "text": "Anvil Game Engine is a proprietary game engine developed by Ubisoft for creating and powering video games. It has been notably used in the development of several Ubisoft titles, including the Assassin’s Creed series. Anvil is designed to support open-world game environments and provides tools and features to handle large and detailed game worlds. There have been many updates and changes to the Anvil Game Engine since it was first developed.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAnvil Game Engine (Scimitar)\n\nAnvilNext\n\nAnvilNext 2.0\n\nFeatures and Specifications\n\nGames Developed using Anvil\n\nUseful Resources\n\nAnvil Game Engine (Scimitar)\n\nAnvil is a 3D game engine developed in 2007 by Ubisoft Montreal game developers. It was known as Scimitar until 2009.\n\nFor Anvil Game Engine (Scimitar), modeling for characters is done in ZBrush which is a digital sculpting tool that combines 3D/2.5D modeling, texturing and painting. The environment of the game is designed 3D Max which is 3D modeling and rendering software for design visualization, games, and animation.\n\nThe game engine uses HumanIK Autodesk middleware for the correct placement of the character’s body parts like hands and feet while pushing and climbing animations at run-time.\n\nAnvilNext\n\nUpdated version of the Anvil (Scimitar) was released in 2012. It was specifically released for Assassin’s Creed III and IV games.

Game renderer was completely re-written for higher efficiency and support for additional post-processing techniques. It also added new water technology and dynamic sandbox environment.\n\nMost of the engine & tools used for Assassin’s Creed were built from scratch. We have reused some internal common libraries (sound, menus, etc.) and some external middlewares (physics, IK), but the entire pipeline was built from the ground up with next-gen architectures and reusability in mind\n\nClaude Langlais, a technical director at Ubisoft\n\nAnvilNext 2.0\n\nAnvilNext 2.0 engine was released in 2014 for Assassin’s Creed Unity game. The game was quite popular for its stunning visuals, improved game and mission design, and options to customize the game.
