        "text": "Back in 2020, Ubisoft announced the grand return of the long-dormant Prince of Persia franchise, with a remake of the classic entry ‘Sands of Time’ set to arrive in January of 2021. Poor reception towards the game’s trailer ultimately led to a change in development team alongside a bunch of delays. According to insiders, the Sands of Time Remake essentially had to be re-remade.\n\nAccording to Insider Gaming, “forget everything you've seen or heard from the reveal trailer, as the remake has been… remade from scratch”. This marks a notable change from Ubisoft’s original statement regarding the game’s change in development studios.\n\nAt the time of the announcement, the publisher claimed that Ubisoft Montreal will be taking over dev duties from the Mumbai/Pune branches, and that they would be “building upon” what was already created. It seems this is no longer the case, with Insider Gaming revealing that:\n\n“Everything has been built from the ground up, which includes a complete graphical overhaul, new animations and mechanics for combat and parkour, and much more. Starting from scratch has meant that the game has been rewritten, recaptured in mocap, and more.”\n\nFinally, among all this mess, the original voice actor for the Prince in the 2003 original ‘Yuri Lowenthal’ is no longer reprising his role – despite coming back for the remake’s original trailer.\n\nAll in all, it seems as though the Sands of Time Remake has wound up being a much more complicated affair than Ubisoft likely planned for. Though probably still years away from release, it is encouraging at least to see that Ubisoft are trying to do the classic franchise and title proper justice.\n\nDiscuss on our Facebook page HERE.\n\nKitGuru says: What do you think of the Sands of Time Remake’s original trailer? Do all the latest leaks paint a more positive or negative picture for the project? Let us know your thoughts down below."
