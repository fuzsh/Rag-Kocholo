        "text": "Luminaire (2023)\n\nLuminaire is our newest album, exploding with rhythmic and soloistic energy as the post-pandemic Aires return to the studio. It spans a variety of artists, from Olivia Rodrigo to John Mayer to Chaka Khan.\n\nOn Aire (2017)\n\nFeaturing songs that cover a timespan of five decades, On Aire is a smooth amalgam of pop, alt-pop, and R&B. With the likes of Marvin Gaye, Marian Hill, and Destiny's Child, this record is not to be skipped!\n\nTruth or Daire (2014)\n\nAn album with a myriad of pop and musical theatre bops, Truth or Daire is probably our catchiest record, with hits like our infamous Kanye Medley, 'Levels', and 'Dark Horse.'\n\nFresh Aire (2011)\n\nFeaturing a fusion of comedic originals, music theatre, and our iconic anthem 'Up the Ladder to the Roof', Fresh Aire is very aptly named!\n\nExtraordinaire (2009)\n\nShowcasing the likes of Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder, and Kanye West, Extraordinaire features a wide amalgam of Aire talents, including beatbox, rap, and voice-synth processing. There's most definitely something for everyone here.\n\nImpaired (2004)\n\nFeaturing our most popular tracks to this day, Impaired includes fun, serious, and jubilant songs from the R&B, punk rock, and pop disciplines.\n\nDartmouth Undying (2004)\n\nOur compilation album of traditional Dartmouth songs, this record is near and dear to the hearts of many Big Green alumni. From 'Hanover Winter Song' to the Alma Mater, this record is a must for the friends and family of the College on the Hill.\n\nBlack Tie Affaire (2003)\n\nWith hits like 'Bicycle Race' and 'Working for the Weekend,' this paradoxically named album is prime early-2000s collegiate a cappella, the first of eight Aires recordings featured on BOCA (but who's counting).\n\n'90s Albums\n\nDon't let the goofy cover arts fool you - these CD releases boast a huge diversity of genres, impressive harmonies, consistent humor, and experimental editing.\n\n'80s Albums\n\nIndependent from the Glee Club, the Aires of the 1980s began to to define themselves with a boisterous but uncomplicated sound, lively arrangements, and plenty of Nylons covers.\n\n'70s Albums\n\nThe 1970s are a crucial era in the Aires' history, seeing the genesis of pun album titles and our infamous -O nicknames, with arrangements we still sing today catalyzing shift to folk & pop.\n\n'60s Albums\n\nWith contributions from Glee Club director Paul Zeller, the group entertained continued nationally with jazzy chords and clever medleys. The Harvard Crimson described us as \"hopelessly addicted to modern harmonies...They, like Yale, make a few miserable attempts at humor, but at least Dartmouth's is crude.\""
