        "text": "The class of 1958 will be holding its fall mini-reunion during the first weekend in October. On that Saturday, October 5, during the football game versus Penn, the College will commemorate the Buddy Teevens Stadium at Memorial Field. About the time this issue of Dartmouth Alumni Magazine is published, Frank Gould will be sending out his normal flyer announcing the weekend’s other activities. The weekend will be filled by the usual fare that Frank organizes so well. The Courtyard by Marriott has set aside several rooms for us at a reasonable rate and Frank’s material will include instructions on how to make a reservation. In other news, Jerry Manne writes that during his annual visit to Hawaii he was able once again to visit with widows Sue Bahrenburg Matthews and Jan Wysard. Marcia Armstrong also writes that she has moved to a continuing care retirement community in Shelburne, Vermont, to be near family. Joel Potash emailed that on May 23 he will receive a B.M.C. Durfee High School Distinguished Alumnus Award. He was a class of ’54 graduate at the school in Fall River, Massachusetts. John Hart emailed that Lu, his wife of 62 years, died two-plus years ago; he then found Carol. “We live in Mississippi and Wyoming unless we are somewhere else.” While the class continues to celebrate those many of us who are members of the 1769 Society and the Harold C. Ripley ’29 Society, which recognizes donors who have given to the fund every year since leaving Hanover, it also has a proud number of the Bartlett Tower Society members. Further, we support the Class of 1958 Scholarship Fund that was formed more recently and is now paired with two scholars. In conjunction with our continuing outstanding contributions to the Dartmouth College Fund, the class has been encouraging legacy gifts to the scholarship fund as we strive to reach the threshold for a third pairing. Sadly, we report the passing of Benny McAdams, Paul Duffy Jr., and Andy Peterson.\n\n—John Trimble, 99 Mooncussets Lane, Chatham, MA 02633; jtrim99@comcast.net\n\nAs our class shrinks, news of its comings and goings (too many of the latter) shrinks disproportionately. Since the last column we have received word of the following classmate deaths: Phalen G. Hurwitz, Peter J. Epstein, Cmdr. Peter B. Dodge, Charles G. Nessler, Frederick B. Bagnall,and Brendan V. McAdams Jr. Obituaries will appear in Dartmouth Alumni Magazine online and have been published in the class newsletter, The Sound and Fury. On a melancholy note, the class had dedicated its recent 65th reunion yearbook to Buddy Teevens ’79 and is delighted to learn of the College’s intention, with much input from classmates led by Bob Downey,to honor Buddy, naming his primary workplace “Buddy Teevens Field at Memorial Stadium.” It is always nice to learn about the love phoenix arising after a spousal death, and we have learned that has bitten Skip Coggin. Coleman Colla (known to most of us as “Butch”) continues to publish an occasional musing called Coleman’s Mental Meanderings available to the inquisitive on Substack. In a recent newsletter its editor (me) mused about human plumbing issues of the late octogenarian era and which washers, Teflon tape, or wrench best assuage leaks endemic to the age. Sam Smith, with his typical wisdom, opined on what tightens the best, with notable side effects, but concluded we all take a million pills already. In that same issue the editor published a picture of the pill bottles cluttering his bathroom vanity and it almost exceeded the capacity of his wide-angle lens! In February, in an attempt to escape the chill of the mid-Atlantic, Mary and Hal Bernsen traveled to Naples, Florida, and were hosted by Vicky and Tryg Myhren,but the weather was more coolth than warmth! They promptly repaired to Cabo St. Lucas, Mexico, where they were pictured with adult Mexican beverages! Once again the class is attempting to pad its reputation as a Dartmouth College Fund record-breaking machine but still needs all the participation it can muster to do that. And although dues and class project contributions are more modest, they pay the bills and fund those projects.\n\n—John Trimble, 2735 Golfside Court, Naples, FL 34110; jtrim99@comcast.net\n\nThe fall and early winter following the class’ 65th reunion have been very quiet. However, the swoosh of classmates making life-care decisions continues, with recent additions Marty and Larry Weltin moving from Aiken, South Carolina, to Tuscaloosa, Alabama; Martha and Ward Burian moving within Williamsburg, Virginia; and Joanne and Cack Bittner doing the same in Dallas, Pennsylvania. Pat and Jack Bennett made a similar move in Manchester, Vermont, earlier this year. Others who led the pack have been Mary and Hal Bernsen, who relocated from Virginia Beach, Virginia, toPittsboro, North Carolina, a stone’s throw from Chapel Hill; Ann and Dave Bradley, who stayed with Hanover when Nora and Frank Gould decided to leave their continuing care retirement center and return to Lyme, New Hampshire; Donna and Dan Wilder, who moved cross country from Connecticut to Boulder, Colorado; and Linda and John Trimble, who moved their winter residence just down the street to Naples, Florida, from Bonita Springs, where Dave Sharrock was already in residence. Earlier Gersh Abraham and Skip Coggin had moved with their now deceased wives from suburban Chicago to Evanston, Illinois; Robin and Sam Smith left Florida to be closer to family in South Weymouth, Massachusetts, while retaining their property in the Northern Kingdom; and Lenita and Ray Robbins came home from Switzerland to Hanover. Planning ahead when most of us won’t buy green bananas, the class has voted to hold its 2024 fall mini-reunion during the weekend of October 4-6. In a bid to return to pre-Covid conventions, Hal Bernsen and John Trimble joined 253 others in sending a letter to President Sian Leah Beilock strongly urging her to reinstate in-person alumni meetings and conferences that strengthen alumni’s bonds to the College. A recent letter valued the Class of 1958 Scholarship Fund as of June 30, 2023, at a smidge under $200,000. That fund now supports two scholar pairings: Amanda Adetula ’26 from Lagos, Nigeria; and new this year, Shade Hargis ’27 from Safford, Arizona. The class is looking to grow this fund and additions are always welcome!\n\n—John Trimble, 2735 Golfside Court, Naples, FL 34110; jtrim99@comcast.net\n\nThe class of 1958 mounted its 65th reunion in September that was considered a huge success.\n\nNew officers elected were Hal Bernsen, president; Frank Gould, vice president; John Trimble, secretary and newsletter editor; and Mike Simberkoff, treasurer. Sam Smith retired after a productive term as vice president. Mike Simberkoff agreed to continue as our money man and John Trimble switched roles so he could continue to write this stuff! A highlight of the 65th was a series of three storytelling sessions centered around favorite Dartmouth memories, sports in our lives and promises kept, the theme of the reunion. Twenty-eight participated telling tales that ranged from awe-inspiring to nostalgic, melancholy, and funny enough to produce a few belly laughs.\n\nThe Rev. Preston “Pete” Kelsey presided over a memorial service that recognized the more than 100 classmates who had died since our 60th reunion in 2018. President Sian Leah Beilock accepted our record-shattering check of $791,958 for the Dartmouth College Fund. Class interlocutor and raconteur Larry Weltin provided the right touch to close our class dinner. Although the College believes old fogies can only endure each other’s company for two days, 70 percent of the 71 registrants stuck around for a third day, enjoying the extension and additional time to do what we came for—reconnect, reminisce and relax. The Decibelles and Dartmouth Aires were melodic, the Irving and Arctic institutes were powerful reminders of climate-induced complexities, and the Hanover Inn took pretty good care of us. Hal Bernsen and Frank Gould, co-chairs, did spectacular jobs in putting this all together. Retired Ballard Spahr partner Morton P. Fisher Jr. has received the Frederick S. Lane Award, the highest individual honor of the American College of Real Estate Lawyers, a premier professional organization of real estate attorneys. Way to go, Morty!\n\nA note from Joel Portugal: “We went to the Ruscha exhibit at MOMA in N.Y.C. The lead painting in the exhibit is the Standard/Chevron gas station on loan from the Hood Museum that was donated to Dartmouth by Jim Meeker in honor of Lee English.”\n\n—John Trimble, 99 Mooncussers Lane, Chatham, MA 02633; jtrim99@comcast.net\n\nThe class’ 65th reunion, co-chaired by Hal Bernsen and Frank Gould with legion help from alumni relations’ Joe Piedrafite, director of alumni engagement, was put on during an eventful three days in early September.\n\nStanding out among the many reunion events was the presentation to President Sian Leah Beilock of the ceremonial check representing the record-shattering Dartmouth College Fund gift from the class of $791,958. This broke the previous record by 42 percent or $233,000! Reunion giving chairs Bob Downey and Walter Vail, ably assisted by co-head agents Gersh Abraham, Jack Bennett and Hal Bernsen, invigorated a team of class agents to exceed expectations! Special thanks to Sandy Bromwell and Pat Crim, who kept us on track from the fund office. Well done. Also standing out were the invigorating three storytelling sessions headlining the reunion program. Oh, the tales that were told!\n\nAt the class meeting, a new slate of officers and a revitalized executive committee were elected to lead the class toward the sunset. Hal Bernsen was elected president; Frank Gould, vice president. Mike Simberkoff, incumbent treasurer, was reelected and John Trimble shed the title of secretary pro tempore and was elected secretary. He will also continue as newsletter editor. The executive committee will be Gersh Abraham, Mel Alperin, Bob Downey, Dick Frisch, Pete Kelsey, Jerry Manne, Ben McAdams, Don McCree, Don McIntyre, Joel Portugal, Sam Smith, Walter Vail, Jane Yusen, and Ron Zwart.\n\nKudos were directed at Sam Smith, retiring class vice president who instituted a program of writing surviving family members when memorial books were purchased by the library in a deceased classmate’s name. Retiring president John Trimble had also initiated writing every surviving spouse upon the death of a classmate with condolences but also welcoming them as honorary members of the class. An informal 65th reunion yearbook was assembled and given to all who contributed. Classmates had been asked to update their profiles from our 50th The Journey Continues and close to 90 did so in a hodge-podge of submissions from neat computer writeups to handwritten scrawls that confirmed that cursive is a lost art!\n\n—John Trimble, 99 Mooncussers Lane, Chatham, MA 02633; jtrim99@comcast.net\n\nThe dribble effect of the paucity of news worthy of this column is like the proverbial Chinese water torture. Take that, oxymoron fans! Christine Fuller helped break that by sending along news that she and Ben Fuller had dinner with Jim Riffle and Mimi in May, when reminiscing was rife. Efforts to convince them to attend reunion proved fruitless, although you’ll read the Fullers’ names below! Skip Coggin has shareda comprehensive muse about what it took to get into Tuck. It concludes with, “What this all showed me is that if you want something badly enough, and you work hard to achieve it, you can just about accomplish anything. That was a valuable lesson that has served me well through life.” I caught up with Paul Robinson, who, with Wes, spends summers in an old family cottage in my backyard of downtown Chatham, Massachusetts. I never knew! Coleman Colla shared news common to us of a certain age: “I won’t make it to the 65th. I’m not traveling much anymore, and my wife just made me surrender my car keys too!” Our 65th reunion will be upon us when this column is published, and we expect those traveling to include Mary and Hal Bernsen, Linda and Jim Crawford, Jim Dougherty,Ann and Mort Fisher,the Fullers, Bill and Bruce Gemberling, Frances Wright and Craig Haines, Ted Kleinman and guest,Susan and Art Lindenauer,Brendan and Benny McAdams, Don McCree,Carleen and Don McIntyre,Vicki and Tryg Myhren, Helen and Joel Portugal,Sandra Hurd and Joel Potash,Lonita and Ray Robbins, Eleanor and Mike Simberkoff, Robin and Sam Smith, Jim Spence,Lucy and Walter Stackler,Linda and John Trimble,Scotty and Walter Vail,Pat Gregory and Otto Wagenbach,Marty and Larry Weltin, and Dick Norris andJane Yusen. A highlight of what’s to come will be storytelling sessions focusing on “Promises Kept,” “Sports in our Lives,” and “Favorite Dartmouth Memories.” Those should be mesmerizing! Sadly, look online for the obituaries for Cal Dyer, Dave Stevens, Bruce Barber, Phil Livingston, Pete Crane, Graf Berger, J.M. Engels,and John Sherwood.\n\n—John Trimble, 99 Mooncussers Lane, Chatham, MA 02633; jtrim99@comcast.net\n\nOnce again class news is dominated by our upcoming 65th reunion. Registration packages have been distributed and returns are being sent to alumni relations electronically and by U.S. Postal Service. Those with email can look on the reunion webpage in the alumni relations pages to see who has registered in case you’re on the fence. The events schedule that Hal Bernsen and Frank Gould have assembledoffers diverse programs that should please the discerning classmate! Bob Downey and Walter Vail remain confident that we will shatter the 65th reunion giving record and the class challenge is to break through the participation record as well. That will take all classmates and even though the reunion is in September, gifts must be recorded as usual by June 30 to count. In addition to the foregoing, early indications of those who will attend reunion include Doug Fusoni, Mike Simberkoff, Sam Smith, and Larry Weltin. The annual southwest Florida mini-reunion was held in April and the usual suspects turned out. Hosted by Linda and John Trimble at Vi at Bentley Village in Naples, Carolyn and John Otis,Fran and Craig Haines, Vicki and Tryg Myhren, Barbara and Roger Bruttomesso, Dick Norris and Jane Yusen, and Bill Allyn assembled for a fun lunch. Bill Allyn hosted his annual gathering to showcase the Dartmouth hockey program at his Naples home on April 25. Skip Coggin has emailed his regrets that he will miss the 65th because of a special birthday celebration of his daughter. Family trumps class every time! Helga and Larry Hampton continue to travel and write about those in Portugal Resident magazine. The latest was a special trip to Lisbon to celebrate his birthday. Mary and Hal Bernsen recently took time away from reunion organizing for a different reunion of his former flying compatriots in Pensacola, Florida. The E-2 Hawkeye he once flew still flies in highly modified form and its electronic gadgetry is so highly classified that Hal was not able to climb aboard even as a retired admiral who once enjoyed top-secret clearance!\n\n—John Trimble, 99 Mooncussers Lane, Chatham, MA 02633; jtrim99@comcast.net\n\nMany of our generation will remember the fear and trepidation we faced in passing the College’s swim test in order to graduate. Recently The Dartmouth published an opinion piece headlined “Dartmouth Removed its Only Useful Graduation Requirement.” Oh the perfidy of it all. One day sink or swim, the next who cares? To think 65 years ago many still faced this daunting challenge.\n\nThe challenge today is to get yourselves in gear to attend our September reunion. Registration materials should be in your hands or will be shortly for a full three days of reconnection and reminiscing. Reunion kicks off on Sunday, September 10, and concludes Wednesday, September 13. Hal Bernsen and Frank Gould have put together an outstanding program. We want to see you there!\n\nI recently received emails from two surviving significant others that reminded me of the importance of this segment of our class community. Michele McIsaac filled me in on the doings of the Bob Eleveld crew and all the way from Australia Heather Mullins, Bill Hartley’slong-time squeeze,remembered fondly his playing golf with Steve Quickel. Another long-distance email arrived from Idaho from Bill Sills with Frank Gato errata: “He was my roomie. No one could ever have a better roomie.” Jim Fannin, our intrepid preservation consultant, shared that he and Minxie have written a review for the Preservation Technology International Bulletin that was just published of the book, Stories in Stone. He noted that was not bad for a guy who majored in economic geography! Tryg Myhren let me know that he and Vicki are among the honorees at the upcoming National Jewish Health annual event in Denver. “This is a truly excellent and wonderful organization which does a lot of good for people around the world.” Four guys who did lots of good for the world have died recently—Harvey Grable, Phil McCaull, Steve Quickel, and Doug Wilder. Their obituaries can be found in the archives of Dartmouth Alumni Magazine.\n\n—John Trimble, 2735 Golfside Court, Naples, FL 34110; jtrim99@comcast.net\n\nIn the absence of an outpouring of class-specific news, I’ll correct misinformation provided earlier this year and speak to the class of 1958 65th reunion. Two months ago we published dates provided by alumni relations that now turn out to be wrong. So please note that the correct dates are September 10, 11, 12.\n\nSome may have made reservations based on the earlier news and those should be revisited. However, there is exciting news on that front. Hal Bernsen has agreed to chair the reunion and has enlisted Frank Gould to be his primary sidekick. Planning is well under way and we have used the experience of ’57 to help frame our approach. In addition, Bob Downey and Walter Vail have agreed to co-chair the reunion giving committee to pursue the Dartmouth College Fund goals approved at the class meeting in early October of $500,000 and 50-percent participation. Both believe based on past class performance that we should bust through that number and break the standing 65th record of $558,000! The class had chosen to hold its fall mini-reunion before the frost chilled the pumpkin and we were rewarded with a spectacular early October weekend and wonderful attendance enhanced by the reappearance of Cack Bitner and Rob Goodell, long absent from these annual festivities.\n\nRob has sent me a fascinating email: “A magazine reporter contacted me this week asking about Bill Friedman, who disappeared without a trace in May of our freshman year. Bill was in Gile, as was I, so the reporter interviewed me for a story he’s doing on the incident.” Rob and I would love to have feedback if anyone knows anything. Rob continues to produce beautifully written memorials for classmates who die and they can be found at DAM online.\n\nJoel Portugal emailed that he is very much looking forward to the 65th in September.\n\nJoel Potash wrote he received awards from Le Moyne College for Board Member of the Year and the Dorothy Reister Award from Stone Quarry Art Park in Cazenovia, New York.\n\n—John Trimble, 2735 Golfside Court, Naples, FL 34110; jtrim99@comcast.net\n\nThere’s been another resounding silence from the 424 of us who remained as of June 30. So you won’t read many ’58 names below. Since these notes were written in late August and won’t be read until late October, currency is of the least importance. Our mini-reunion will be past history and some of us will be creating plans for our 65th reunion that will take place September 15, 16, 17, 2023, headquartered at the Hanover Inn. Save those dates if you have not already done so! For many the winter diaspora to warmer climes will have commenced and then we’ll be looking down the throat of the holidays. Yikes! All has not been quiet, however. We’ve learned recently of two legacy gifts to the College and they provide a lesson for planners. One came from a classmate who had not been recently engaged either at the class or college level. He had achieved invisibility! It was a complete surprise of many millions, out of the blue. The other came from the estate of a familiar name who had given other gifts but a final distribution benefited Dartmouth again. Both are reminders it’s never too late to take the mostly simple steps to include Dartmouth in your estate plans. It’s easy for us to assume that old grunts like us have set those plans in concrete but sometimes that’s still only in gravel, so a shovel full can be easily moved from one spot to Dartmouth College. Do yourselves and Dartmouth a favor by promising to dig those estate plans out of their moth holes and modify your gift designations to include your alma mater or, as we have done, to improve a previous intent. We are always reminded that now may be too late when notices are received from the College of classmate deaths: Raydon C. Hitchcock, John B. McCloskey, David A. Shepard. Sometimes that news travels very slowly. Dave died more than a year ago and Ray, who spent just two years at Dartmouth, died very early in 2022. John died in July.\n\n—John Trimble, 99 Mooncussers Lane, Chatham, MA 02633; jtrim99@comcast.net\n\nGathering news for the DAM column is like snatching tidbits from a gale! We reach out but only occasionally succeed in picking something from the wind. But first a reminder: You will have received the annual brochure announcing plans for our mini-reunion that this fall will be the weekend of September 30 to October 2. Reserve your accommodations at the Courtyard by Marriott, where a block of rooms has been set aside for us. This is not Homecoming, so rates will be more favorable. Frank Gould has put together his usual high-quality program and the Penn-Dartmouth football game will be Saturday afternoon. Since the last column Rob Goodell has sent DAM obituaries for the classmates who were listed, and those should be available at its website. We have identified a number of deaths for which obituaries had not been written and Rob has done that. The two most recent deaths we know about are for Frank Gato and Al Gazzaniga. Coleman Colla has provided some interesting stats. “When our class of 1958 cohort was born, the life expectancy of a white American male was 63 years. That would have taken us on average to or past 1999. Now, at about 86, for those of us still alive, life expectancy is 92 years, or half of us will live to see 2028!” As of June 30, of our original class of 753, 424 remain or an extraordinary 56 percent! One death of note outside the class is of John Andersen, who with Donna, hosted us for several Homecoming years at Breakfast on the Connecticut. Among the living, I’ve heard from Bob Abbott, who has consolidated his home in Vero Beach, Florida, and left Massachusetts after many years. Carl Wentworth emails that “California remains attached to the mainland, although the San Andreas fault continues its inexorable movement and occasional earthquakes; the next ‘big one’ is always just ahead of us.” Hmm! Skip Coggin emails that he and Gersh Abraham hosted Buddy Teevens ’79 at a breakfast at their continuing care retirement community in Evanston, Illinois. Not recruiting, I suspect!\n\n—John Trimble, 99 Mooncussers Lane, Chatham, MA 02633; jtrim99@comcast.net\n\nAt a time when our college faces great change and the world is roiled by bald-faced Russian aggression, when the U.S. Supreme Court is roiled by politics and an historic nomination, and as our political differences rend civil discourse, the matters affecting our class mostly fade in relative importance. But these turmoils cannot overshadow the continuing loss of classmates. In recent weeks we have been informed of the deaths of Peter Heegaard, a stalwart of the Minneapolis scene, and Joe Blake, the Barrett Cup winner at graduation and an icon in the Denver area. After a lengthy pause, Rob Goodell has stepped up and agreed to be the class necrologist. Through time, obituaries for classmates who have died since Steve Quickel’s last efforts will appear in future editions of The Sound & Fury. There’s sparse news from classmates themselves. John Voll writes, “I have been keeping busy doing some academic reviews and research. It is really fascinating to compare world affairs now with the world that we were studying in the 1950s.” Indeed! Christine writing for Ben Fuller shares, “Ben goes to the gym three mornings a week and tries to walk about three miles in our neighborhood on the other two or three mornings. He sees other retired professors there and enjoys getting out of the house. For us, life is good and we are most grateful.” A note from Joel Potash with the subject “overcoming paltry” shares the news, “My wife, Sandra Hurd, and I commissioned an opera based on the life of a Black folk singer, Libba Cotton. It was performed in the fall at the Tucker Missionary Baptist Church in Syracuse, New York, and will be making the rounds of colleges in upstate New York. We hope to support a recording soon.” We have word that our 65th reunion will be the weekend of September 15-17, 2023, and will be headquartered at the Hanover Inn. Nearer term our fall mini will be September 30 to October 2 with Penn football and rooms blocked at the Courtyard by Marriott. Reserve early!\n\n—John Trimble, 2735 Golfside Court, Naples, FL 34110; jtrim99@comcast.net\n\nYou realize that you’ve reached a new pinnacle in the life when a submission (actually a missed submission) to DAM is acknowledged as follows from class gadfly Frank Gado: “Your November-December Class Notes piece in DAM is your best-written yet.” On a higher note, we received these greetings from expat Larry Hampton that outlive the season: “We are thinking of you this Christmas and sending you all our warmest and best wishes for happiness, good health, and prosperity in the coming year. In a time of great uncertainty, a most important constant is our friends, and we treasure ours—even if we see many of you less often than we would like.”\n\nSadly, we continue to collect word of classmate deaths. Letters of condolence have been written to widows of the following: Gene Laff, Gerry Polin, Joel Farrell, Ole Sundeen, George Hammel, Ted Striker, Dick Schaedle, and Chuck Bradford.Sadly, as this was going to press, we learned from Dick Shanahan that Dave Dingman had died. They were the subject of a picture that was published in the late fall edition of the Sound & Fury. Sam Smith reports that he is as current as possible in informing classmate survivors of the book titles purchased by the library in their loved ones’ memories. We continue to hunger for news other than classmate deaths to share with the class and DAM readers. I have spoken with Hal Bernsen who, by the time this is read, will have moved from Virginia Beach, Virginia, to a life care community in Pittsboro, North Carolina, near Chapel Hill. I have also spoken with Walter Vail, who tells me such a move is the furthest thing from his and Scottie’s minds! Two sides of a coin, but as someone who has recently joined the former camp, I am biased! The head agent team of Abraham, Alperin,Bernsen, Bennett, and Vail has made an impressive start to the Dartmouth College Fund annual campaign and thanks to all those agents who have agreed to propel us toward meeting our goals.\n\n—John Trimble, 2735 Golfside Court, Naples, FL 34110; jtrim99@comcast.net\n\nAfter missing the deadline for the last DAM column, I tattooed future submission dates on my forearm. Nonetheless, the flow of class news to this interim scribe has been paltry, so please feed me even if it’s just scraps from your banquet. The banquet, a.k.a., our class dinner, on October 9 was a fitting conclusion to a renewed Homecoming mini-reunion. Frank Gould working with moving targets put together a program that attracted a smaller but very vibrant group of ’58s and spouses. Attendees included Bob and Nancy Downey, Jerry Manne, Hal and Mary Bernsen, Mike and Eleanor Simberkoff, Walter andScottie Vail, Doug and Judy Fusonie, Joe and Sandy Slotnick, Ralph and Sally Manuel, Mel Alperin, Dick Frisch, Dave and Ann Bradley, Otto Wagenbach and So, Don McCree, Frank and Nora Gould, and John and Linda Trimble.Also attending bits and pieces were Jane Yusen and Dick Norris, plus Hobie Van Deusen and the redoubtable Sandy Bromwell.Messrs. Cutcliffe, Abraham, Bowman, Spence, O’Hara, Cohen, Hampton, and Wolcott Zoomed in for the class meeting. An overtime win vs. Yale was a suitable filler of the weekend sandwich.\n\nAttempting to reduce mailing costs, we sent postcards to all for whom we have no email address, of which there were 241, hoping to add significant numbers. The surprise was 164 of those were widows and there were “just” 77 classmates. In a cascade of responses, 18 widows and four classmates shared an email address. It’s a sad tale when 18 percent of the class is so disconnected from their classmates they won’t allow us to keep costs down and share an email address. The most recent Sound & Fury was sent only by email.\n\nOn a more uplifting note, we received a preliminary valuation of the Class of 1958 Scholarship Fund June 30, and its market value had reached $208,304!\n\nFinally, a note from Pete Danford: “Lou Bloomfield, Jay Davis, and I are still very close friends in Shaker Heights [Ohio] after all these years. Sue and I spend the winter in Sanibel, Florida.”\n\n—John Trimble, 2735 Golfside Court, Naples, FL 34110; jtrim99@comcast.net\n\nCircumstances propel us into surprise roles, and we are sometimes asked to step in and fill a void we hope will be temporary. Steve Quickel experienced a cardio event in May, a heartrending experience that many of us can relate to, whether through heartache, heart failure, arrythmia, or other heart diseases. As of late June he was rehabbing at his life care community in Media, Pennsylvania. From notes his son, Steve ’82, shared with me, I will pass along tidbits and observations. Send more tidbits, please!\n\nThe heartache comes through continuing news of classmate deaths that since Steve’s last column include those of Jim Meeker, Butch Pendergast, Robert Rudolph, David Wark, John Mehl, Arden Bucholz,and Richard Ballinger.\n\nOf a more sweetheart nature, Linda and I had a Florida visit in April with Michele McIsaac, Bob Eleveld’slongtime squeeze, who continues in Grand Rapids, Michigan, but is contemplating a return to her roots in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Prior to our visit Michele had seen Carolyn and John Otis, who are settling back in up in Tampa, Florida. We miss John in an occasional luncheon group that includes fellow soccer player Ward Burian, who splits his time betweenWilliamsburg, Virginia, and Chatham, Massachusetts.\n\nJim Spence chortled in a recent note: “As a passionate golfer I was excited to shoot my age (84) during the Two Rivers Country Club (Williamsburg, Virginia) Stroke Play Championship this week. Full disclosure: We 80-and-older folks were allowed to play a somewhat shorter course.” Let’s start a wall of fame of others who have done the same!\n\nSteve Dawkins sent a heavier note: “I’m dealing with a health problem that makes it difficult for me to travel. So I stay on my delightful tropical island, Key West [Florida], and enjoy the quiet island life. But I wish I could see the Big Green again and all of you. All the best.” How we wish the same!\n\nThrough a chance encounter we heard Harold Knapp continues his retirement in Glen Rock, New Jersey, after a distinguished career in local education.\n\n—John Trimble, 99 Mooncussers Lane, Chatham, MA 02633; jtrim99@comcast.net\n\nYou may not realize how lucky you are to read this column every issue. For some reason, the Class Secretaries Association has given it top billing in its latest ratings. Merit suggests the notes by my Phi Delt brother John Cusick ’57 (above) are far more deserving. But at this point in life, we’ll take any kudos that come our way.\n\nThe virus has depleted my inbox, with a few exceptions. One that’s specially Class Notes-worthy comes from Larry Farrar’s daughter, Sabrina Nelson ’92, who volunteers to “toot my dad’s horn.” Larry, it seems, after careers in the naval and diplomatic services, is devoting his golden years to writing short stories, 80 so far. Meant to be read at one sitting, Larry’s stories are so well-crafted they can be read in almost no time at all. See for yourself at www.northoakswriter.com.\n\nJohn Trimble tells of a golf cart accident that left him “battered, bruised with broken rib,” obliging him to avoid laughter. Now well-healed, he’s back in action, allegedly shooting his age. John reports a nice visit with Michelle McIssac, longtime companion of Bob Eleveld up in Michigan. He’s also texted with Dave Chapin about a “construction accident.” Says Dave: “Guess it’s time I retired.” John and Linda have also visited Carol and John Otis. But our president’s most ambitious adventure was mobilizing 30 snowbirds at an annual Florida mini-reunion April 14. Done via Zoom, and aided by Sandy Bromwell, attendees numbered two dozen—including usual suspects ranging (alphabetically speaking) from Roger Bruttomesso to Walt Vail, plus four undergrads marooned on the Hanover Plain and appearances by the likes of Myles Slosberg and Pete Durno.\n\nSadly, we note several 2021 deaths: Bob Rudolph, a Washington, D.C., oncologist who authored many peer-reviewed articles, on February 6; Robert Pendergast, a geotechnical engineer with residences in Minnesota, Puerto Rico, and Arizona, on February 16; Jim Meeker,who donated a valuable Edward Ruscha oil to the Hood Museum in memory of classmate Lee English,on January 24 in Albuquerque; and Glower Jones, an attorney who made Atlanta glow, of an aneurism on January 21 in the arms of Joanna at their mountain retreat in Georgia.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nIvy-educated, with little else to do, I’m guessing we’ve all been hitting the books. So what have you been reading lately? A brief review or two will do. Books with really good hooks might wind up in the Sound & Fury.\n\nTo prime the literary pump, my own reading has ranged from sublime to ridiculous. I loved Barack Obama’s A Promised Land describing his “go-for-it” presidential game plan. He tells of upstairs life in the White House with Michelle and the kids and grandma. He takes us for global spins in Air Force One. And he writes good, for a Harvard (law) grad. Yet this is only volume one, with more to come!\n\nFor more light-hearted enlightenment I’ve perused David W. Barber’s When the Fat Lady Sings: History of Opera as it Ought to be Taught. Chapters titled “Teutonic Tunesmiths” (Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven) and “Italian Sausage Machines” (Verdi, Puccini, et al.) are outdone only by the one headlined “A Cut Above” about the castrati, those unlucky guys who sang soprano back in pre-feminist days. Every Barberian sentence and cartoon is a gasser.\n\nSo please send something to help fill this column—and do it now, before you forget which room you are in and why you went there.\n\nAs for classmate notes, John Trimble writes that the southwest Florida folks will gather for their winter mini in late March, when spring will have sprung. Larry Weltin, the peripatetic ad agency founder, says he and Marty have moved to South Carolina, next to a Nicklaus-designed golf course. He also sent this witty ditty: “A Navy commander named Zwart/Well-schooled in starboard and port/Suggested that Quickel/With a beard like Ted Bikel/Tweak the name of his ’58 report.” This referenced Ron Zwart’s suggestion to rename class obits “The Quickel and the Dead.” That called for my retort, to wit: “Captain Larry, proud U.S. Marine/After steeping himself in Green/Detoured to Mad Ave./Found new flags to wave/Then settled on a Nicklaus scene.”Not bad on short notice! Yet clearly, the Marines won still another battle.\n\nSadly, we note the passing of three ’58s: most recently Atlanta attorney Glower Jones;Seattle native Dave Maryatt, who started an eponymous local conglomerate; and Richard Roth, who founded an ad agency in New York City.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA, 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nPhew! Somehow we made it through 2020. Now we’re off and running into 2021, which may be even tougher. The good news, though, is that more than half of the 749 pea greenies who matriculated in September 1954 are still standing (more or less) 64 years later—391 of us, at last reckoning.\n\nSo how are we doing as our journey continues (to parrot the title Larry Weltin suggestedfor our 50th reunion book)? Quite well, all things considered. Our unexpected high point in 2020 was the October 3 virtual Homecoming via Zoom organized by Frank Gould and Sandy Swain Bromwell,driven into reality by president John Trimble. Thanks to their efforts we got to see, in living technicolor, not only the usual East Coast suspects who come to Hanover each October, but also the likes of Hal Douglas in Oregon, Dave Bowman in Los Angeles, Tryg Myhren in Colorado, Glower Jones in Georgia, and a host of others rarely seen east of the Rockies or north of the Mason-Dixon line.\n\nAs a result, our mailbox is chock-full of notes from ’58s hither and yon. One received as 2020 ended came from Helga and Larry Hampton in Portugal’s Algarve, wishing ’58s holiday greetings in six different languages, from feliz Natal to frohe Weihnachten—with a fervent plea for a return to “normalcy” in the United States, to which I can only say hurray!\n\nAnother from president John reports that the Weltins have moved from Alabama to Aitken, South Carolina, to be nearer family, and that John Otis’ son has just graduated from Roanoke University. We also had word from other seldom-heard ’58s, including Fred Hart, Jim Crawford,and Mel Croner, plus reflections from John Whiteley’s widow, Kim, which space limits force into abeyance. On deck for future revelation is a book review by John Trimble about the sinking of the WW II cruiser Indianapolis. These and other entertaining tales must wait until the next Sound & Fury, which will appear when I recover from 2020. Stay tuned: I’m still standing too (more or less).\n\nLastly, and sadly, we note the passing of three classmates since the last DAM: Tom Green, a Tuck M.B.A. and highly regarded retailing exec; Donald Thomas of Sudbury, Massachusetts, a noted scrimshaw collector; and Tom Chementowski, an ex-Marine who once played Philadelphia area basketball against Wilt Chamberlain before Doggie Julian recruited Tom to Hanover.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nI am writing just days before the election, so let’s talk instead about the amazing October 3 virtual class of 1958 Homecoming via Zoom staged by John Trimble, Frank Gould,and, most of all, our adopted classmate Sandy Swain-Bromwell, who made two Zooms happen. The annual class meeting in the morning was mercifully brief, with VP Sam Smith subbing for John, who was rehabbing from eye surgery. Treasurer Mike Simberkoff reported we’re solvent and Dave Bradley and Dan O’Hara talked about class projects. The evening cocktail party kicked off with coach Buddy Teevins ’79 talking about Dartmouth football. Then came 60-second pandemic reflections from West Coast eastward. First we saw Hal Douglas in Oregon, then Vicky and Tryg Myhren in Colorado, Liz and Skip Coggin in Illinois, Joanna and Glower Jones in Georgia, Hal Bernsen in Virginia, Henry Hof in New Jersey, and all of the usual New England suspects. Bob Downey in New York said he lost 30 pounds. Someone else reported shooting his age at golf. Sam Silverstein chipped in with words of medical wisdom. We zoomed out to strains of “Dartmouth Undying” ringing softly in our ears on that October evening, thanks to Sandy Swain-Bromwell.\n\nOther classmate contacts include the following. All’s well with Gersh Abraham in Evanston, Illinois, where he hikes five miles daily but steers clear of Northwestern’s campus, where few students wear masks. Coleman Colla continues to send his views from western Los Angeles. A personal delight arose from Ron Zwart’s suggestion last issue to retitle the Sound & Fury as The Quickel and the Dead. That drew an email chuckle from John Cusick,the ’57 class secretary and a fellow Phi Delt.\n\nSadly, we note the passing of seven classmates: John Diggs, M.D., in Georgetown, South Carolina, who ran cross country; Oliver Witte of Wheaton, Illinois, who worked on the Milwaukee Journal and taught architecture; John Blunt at Village of Golf, Florida, who managed family trusts, including those of his uncle, Carleton ’26, for whom the alumni center in Hanover is named; William DeGraw in Newburgh, New York, in Rip Van Winkle country; and Paul Wysard in his hometown of Honolulu, where he taught at Punahou School; Norm Sylvester of Connecticut, an ex-Marine, advertising executive, and class VP; and Jaegwon Kim in Providence, Rhode Island, who taught philosophy at Brown and other Ivied schools.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nMuch ado about nothing, sense and sensibility: Call it what you will, the dustup over the Baker weathervane finally brought forth much ado about sensibility from Hal Bernsen and Bob Downey, who wisely advised classmates to keep their cool and see what happens.\n\nMissing this year is our usual Fall mini at Homecoming, a situation John Trimble and class officers and committee heads Sam Smith, Mike Simberkoff, Dave Bradley, Gersh Abraham, and Mel Alperin are working to ameliorate. In place of being locked out of Hanover, try dialing up the three-minute virtual campus drive-thru in the August 20 edition of the Dartmouth News Weekly at https://dartmouth.us1.list-manage.com/track/click or phone (603) 646-2258.\n\nWhen you receive this column in October the presidential election will be only weeks away. You may recall that in 2016 the Sound & Fury newsletter ran a prexit poll, patterned after exit polls with lots of demographic and political questions designed to dope out the results beforehand. An amazing 150 or so ’58s participated, most using their names. I won’t embarrass anyone by divulging their data. But in case you don’t remember, the round numbers showed that in October 2016 two-thirds of the class leaned Republican, but two-thirds thought Hillary Clinton was a shoo-in. What did the prexit poll miss? It missed James Comey and her emails, for sure; overconfident Dems who stayed home, cutting turnout to 57 percent; plus the creaky Electoral College that negated her 3 million popular vote win.\n\nAs for recent classmate departures, we note those of John T. Blunt on July 18, Norm Sylvester on June 13, John Germani on June 24, William A. DeGraw on July 11,and Paul Wysard on date unknown. John Trimble has been doing yeoman duty with personal letters of condolence to surviving spouses and families.\n\nKeep the emails coming! Love to see some new old names here next time. Guys are really interested in hearing about classmates, both known and unknown. Meantime I’m off to help my dear friend Woody Benson, who piloted B-17s in the Pacific when we were still in short pants, celebrate his 100th birthday.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA, 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nThis was written in June, just after the latest Sound & Fury, but I’ll try to keep it as fresh as I can when you read it in August.\n\nToday brought an email from Larry Hampton alerting us that Forbes (my former stomping ground) has designated Portugal’s Algarve (his and Helga’s longtime stopping ground) as the No. 1 place to live after the pandemic. We knew Larry was bright, and this proves it. Forbes cited chapter and verse—year-round sunshine, low-cost healthcare, great beaches, lots of golf courses, affordable cost of living. Says Larry: “You can live in the Algarve very comfortably indeed on $30,000 a year and less elsewhere in Portugal where prices are even lower.” Forbes’ second and third choices are Mazatlan, Mexico, and Cayo, Belize.\n\nTryg Myhren weighed in with upbeat thoughts: “Terrific newsletter. You and the contributors kept me turning the pages. I’m particularly sad about all of the fellows who died from the virus. But so many good ’58s are still alive.” We’ve had three Covid-19 victims: Brad Hubert, Ev Lindgren, and Arnold Tenenbaum (plus wife Lorlee, lost five days later to the virus). Also missing from our ranks since the last DAM are Frank Blatz, former mayor of Plainfield, New Jersey, in riotous times; Bob Rosenberg, a productive physician-biophysicist whose seminal work on the blood thinner heparin saved lives; Phillip McClanahan, whose no-load mutual funds benefitted clients of a large investment firm; Harvey Bloom, an Oregon physician who sent five kids to Dartmouth, classes ’87 through ’95; Mike Margulies, a linguist who was fluent in five languages, pianist, and pilot; and Rick Martin, a man of divine inclinations who roamed the world with his guitar seeking elusive peace.\n\nFinally, this tongue-in-cheek note from Ron Zwart in late June: “Thanks for continuing to publish the Sound & Fury—the glue that holds the class of ’58 together—including your ‘In Memoriam’ section with touching tributes to the classmates we have lost. With no disrespect to the deceased, and seeking pardon for the pun, have you thought of retitling this section ‘The Quickel and the Dead?’ ”\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nA rare delight of Covid-19 is the daily email by Coleman Colla from his Los Angeles home to classmates and friends (colemancolla@gmail.com). The following is a sampling. “Thursday, April 23: 7 a.m., sipping a cup of tea, looking out our front-room window, in 10 minutes only one car drove by. Friday, April 24: Weather forecast for today about 90; first time we have turned on the A/C this year. Sunday, April 26: We walk by John and Eileen’s place. They have a lovely sign in their window sending good wishes for Ramadan to all their Muslim friends. Tuesday, April 28: Our grocery order from Yummy.com arrives. Nadine thought she ordered three red potatoes, but what we got were three two-pound bags of red potatoes. Wednesday, April 29: We decide to take my 2005 Civic out for a spin to keep its battery charged. Auto traffic in our neighborhood is starting to pick up.” Coleman also reports that he’s finally had a letter to The New York Times published. To wit: “I appreciate your exhortation to younger Americans to get out and vote. Now the contest is reduced to two candidates and the choice is simple: Joe Biden or Donald Trump. If you have trouble deciding which of these is best, woe unto us.”\n\nHoyt Goodrich writes from Vero Beach, Florida: “A man called saying he had a letter sweater [lacrosse] with my name on it. Was he a classmate? No, he was considerably younger. But years ago he had a fling with an older woman and had found me through Dartmouth (not saying how). He and his wife were cleaning out a closet and there it was. He didn’t remember her last name but her first name was Dianne. I’ve been trying to remember a Dianne in my life back then, but there were so many—oh, don’t I wish! So this mystery remains unsolved, unless some classmate remembers Dianne. The sweater arrived and it does have my name in it, but for some reason it doesn’t fit!” Actually, it fits rather well, judging from the photo Hoyt sent.\n\nWe report the recent deaths of classmates Robert Rosenberg of New York City; Phillip McClanahan of Sea Ranch, California; Harvey Bloom of Portland, Oregon; and Brad Hubert of Beverly Hills, Michigan, of Covid-19.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nWriting on Washington’s birthday in this election year calls to mind, with a sigh, the caliber of past leaders such as Dr. Franklin, His Excellency George, Honest Abe, and the Roosevelt boys. “A house divided cannot stand,” Abe warned exactly 100 years before we left Hanover, and he was right—then and now.\n\nSo what’s new from you? Our snowbird classmates in southwest Florida had their Bonita Springs annual dinner on March 10, with Sandy Bromwell of the Dartmouth College Fund as a special guest, says John Trimble—with a possible “surprise” guest. Maybe some disoriented Philadelphian lured south during his city’s snowless winter.\n\nTwo surviving spouses—Joe Jacquet’s Lynne and John Whiteley’s Kim—who’ve long kept in touch sent kind words about the Sound & Fury. A note of thanks also came from Bill Hartley’s Heather Mallinson of Melbourne, Florida, for our coverage of his parting, here and in the S&F. Baltimore-based Morton P. Fisher Jr. wrote that his middle name is Poe, a namesake quoted evermore in the S&F to the evident displeasure of Frank Gado, who reminded us that Herman Melville could write a whale of a lot better. But as pure poetry, Poe stuff is easier on the ears.\n\nFor something uneasier, Charlie Pierce suggests The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming by David Wallace-Wells. In reviewing Wallace-Wells’ unrelenting 228-pager, he called it “the most frightening book I ever read”—and a must-read.\n\nA pleasant email exchange with Tryg Myhren recalled how on campus breaks we fellow Pennsylvanians dropped him at his boondocks hometown of Palmerton. “No one else from Palmerton ever went to Dartmouth,” he said. Tryg was a New York Times campus correspondent in those days. We also had a memory-refreshing catchup chat with Pete Flowers from Lebanon, the home of Pennsylvania’s famed bologna. Retired physician Pete and Ann now live in nearby Palmyra (she hailing from the same tiny town of Camp Hill as Ted Harris, Terry Doran, George Salkeld, and me).\n\nIn memoriam: Mike Bzullack notes the December 16 passing of Jack Conklin, a member of the large Torrington, Connecticut, delegation of ’58s; several guys sent clips of The New York Times of December 17 obit of Don Shagrin,a longtime class officer; and Phil Ranney of Cleveland left us on Christmas Day.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nNormally we mention lots of names in this space. This issue spotlights only one, our world-class journalist classmate Bill Hartley.\n\nYou’ll remember Bill as president of The Daily D and a familiar campus byline. In December Heather Mallinson emailed that her “beloved Bill” had died of a long, mind-numbing illness in Melbourne, Australia, her hometown. They’d lived there for 15 years after he retired from his remarkable career, and she said it cheered him when she read him news about Dartmouth.\n\nSeattle-born Bill had roamed the girdled earth as foreign correspondent and TV anchorman—“a wanderer, notebook in hand, asking embarrassing questions in Europe, then Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. I was shot at a couple times, fortunately by people who didn’t know one end of a rifle from the other.”\n\nWorking for The Wall Street Journal and U.S. News & World Report, he covered 70 countries on six continents, interviewing the likes of Saddam Hussein, Anwar Sadat, Menachem Begin, Ferdinand Marcos, and assorted prime ministers of Japan, India, Australia, and Rhodesia—plus heads of many “small nations and boardrooms full of corporate CEOs.” And, oh yes, Audrey Hepburn. He’d interviewed Audrey for his high school newspaper and never quite got over it.\n\nBill produced our 25th reunion book, “The Greying of the Green,” manually typing every word in that pre-PC era. In New York he switched to TV as a CNN anchor, then in the 1990s moved to CNBC-Asia in Hong Kong, where he met Heather. They came to our 50th together.\n\nWhen Ralph Manuel asked if he’d edit our 50th reunion book, Bill said, “See if Quickel will do it.” Which I did. But when I asked Bill to put his background to work writing a 50-year history of the world since we’d graduated, he growled a string of expletives—then said okay. Together, he and Heather researched and wrote the book’s masterful, 50-page “A ’58’s History of the World: 1958-2007.”\n\nIt took nearly a year, sending 10-year segments piecemeal, but was worth the wait. Haul down your dusty copy of the “The Journey Continues” to reread 50 pages of world-class journalist Bill Hartley at his erudite, entertaining best.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nBreaking news—sort of—as we went to press in October. The College has adopted ’58 vice president Sam Smith’s bright idea to hold all our autumnal get-togethers prior to October 15—midst warmer weather and better New England leaf-peeping. In 2020, for example, the College’s Homecoming (like ours) will be October 2-4, with Penn as the football opponent, instead of a blustery weekend in late October. In 2021 both will occur October 9-11.\n\nAmong the highlights of this year’s October 11-13 fall mini were the Williamson awards, presented to Bob Downey and Frank Gould at the Saturday banquet at Courtyard by Marriot—expertly arranged by Frank, of course. Before the football, where we crushed Yale 42 to 10, our crowd was serenaded by the Marching Band at the tailgate in Dave Bradley’s driveway. And before that, at the nearby Black Family Center, president John Trimble ran his usual brisk annual class meeting, at which the following was decided: Class dues remain at $58 for another year; our Dartmouth College Fund goals were set at $210,000 and a 50-percent participation rate; and class project contributions were ratified with a proviso to downscale them as the class headcount shrinks. John added that contributions to the Class of 1958 Scholarship Fund are now large enough to support two students.\n\nTwo weeks earlier, on October 1, 11 class officers and committee chairs held one of their periodic conference calls. Treasurer Mike Simbercoff assured us that the class remains solvent. Also on the line were Gersh Abraham, Jack Bennett, Hal Bernsen, Walt Vail,plus Sam, Frank, Dave, Sandy Bromwell, et moi. John wrapped it up by remarking on our remarkable longevity: Four hundred seventy-four of the 763 mostly white, all-male Pea Greenies who matriculated in September 1954 remain. But we do note the passing of six ’58s this summer: Phil Wood of Ada, Michigan, on July 1; Ray Hilsinger of Orinda, California, on July 4; Phil Drescher of Ventura, California, on July 15; Don Voss of New London, New Hampshire, on August 19; Bob Nathanson of Westboro, Massachusetts, on July 23; and Bob Hickin of Washington, Vermont, on September 16.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nThis column, written in late August, will appear in the November/December DAM. By then, our fall mini-reunion of October 11-13 will be history. This year, thanks to the efforts of Frank Gould, the venue was shifted from the upriver Lyme Inn to the closer, more accessible Courtyard by Marriott near the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. Presumably that produced more attendees when John Trimble called the annual class meeting to order on Saturday and when the Dartmouth Marching Band serenaded sandwich munchers at Dave Bradley’s nearby tailgate party on their way to the Yale football game at Memorial Stadium.\n\nAmong communiques from folks we don’t hear from very often is a thank-you note from Mary Ann Whitehead, widow of Arch Whitehead, for the Sound & Fury’s coverage of the latest bestselling novel, The Nickel Boys, from their son, Colson Whitehead. You may recall his Pulitzer Prize-winning The Underground Railroad. Says Mary Ann: “Thanks for your write-up on Colson’s new book and his picture on the cover of Time magazine. I am very proud, and Arch would be also. Keep up the good work on your Class Notes. I am still doing class notes for my 1959 Smith College class.” Colson’s book will be reviewed in the next issue of the S&F. It’s a harrowing but un-hyped read, based on a true Florida Panhandle story.\n\nCharlie Pierce weighs in from Florida to ask if the S&F might be interested in a book review. The title: The Uninhabitable Earth; Life after Warming by David Wallace-Wells. “It is the most terrifying book I have ever read,” says Charlie. Our reply: Please do. Also from Florida, Key West foreign service retiree Steve Dawkins notes that he was commissioned as a Marine second lieutenant with the Navy ROTC crowd in June 1958.\n\nMail from Larry Scoville, Jim Riffle, and Jack Stromberg will have to hold for the next S&F, since we must also pause to note three recent classmate deaths. Ray Hilsinger, M.D., of Orinda, California, died following a fall on July 4. Phil Drescher, a Ventura, California, attorney with an army of friends, died of a stroke on July 15. Bob Nathanson of Westborough, Massachusetts, died on July 23.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nJohn Trimble’s email to the class in June conveyed the details worked out by reunion honcho Frank Gould and treasurer Mike Simberkoff for this year’s fall mini during Homecoming on October 11-13. Festivities have been shifted to the Courtyard by Marriott, away from the Lyme Inn, where we were fiscally blindsided last year. By now it’s probably too late to find a room anywhere near Hanover. But if you’re within striking distance, it might be fun to drop by for a day and touch base with classmates.\n\nFrank says that 23 classmates and spouses attended June’s New England luncheon mini. This year’s speaker, professor Dennis Washburn, discussed a variety of pressing campus issues with them, interactively. Present for the lively give-and-take, besides Nora and Frank, were Brinna and Frank Sands,Ann and Dave Bradley, Robin and Sam Smith,Peregrine and Peter Spiegel,Pat and Jack Bennett,Julie and Dan O’Hara, andCorrinne and Dave Cassidy, Andy Petersen, Craig Haines, Ray Robbins, Ed Olney, Sheila Herman,andMary AnnHayward.\n\nYou read it first in our Sound & Fury! Late in 2018 the S&F learned that Dartmouth and Princeton would play football at Yankee Stadium on November 9. Possibly you recall the splashy photo of a gridiron digitally superimposed over the stadium’s baseball diamond. No one else paid much attention.\n\nNow the story has gained circulation. Last season the Green narrowly lost the Ivy championship to Princeton. So the league arranged a 2019 rematch to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the first college football game, fittingly in America’s most famous ballpark. It will also celebrate Dartmouth’s 250th anniversary. Of course, this presumes that both of us will field championship-caliber teams this year. Bob Downey’s friends of football will help there.\n\nWe note several departures. John Murphy,who edited the S&F for 25 years, died June 9 in Jersey City, New Jersey, where he’d moved to be near family. Leaving too were educator Gardner DeFoe of Kingfield, Maine, on January 25; prosecuting attorney Fred Kosmo of Oxnard, California, on March 13; and my unforgettable physician roommate Lee Wight of Newport Beach, California, on July 14, 2018.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA, 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nOne Saturday in April, a week ago as I write, yours truly watched the Big Green women’s lacrosse team come from down 2-6 to upset the favored Penn Quakers 15-10 at nearby Franklin Field in Philadelphia. (They beat Yale 23-9 for a share of the Ivy title April 29.) Nice to see Ivy sports for a change.\n\nSpring also brought some ’58 mini-reunions. John Trimble sent word of the annual southwest Florida winter mini by 19 classmates and spouses at the Bonita Bay Club in Bonita Springs on March 12. Adopted classmate Sandy Bromwell from the alumni office was on hand to lead attendees in a rousing singing of “Happy 250th Birthday” to the College.\n\nWalt Vail reported the six-person mini-mini he and his wife, Scottie, enjoyed with Patsy and Don McCree and Lucy and Walt Stackler. Look for a photo of their get-together in the next Sound & Fury newsletter, along with a bushel of pix Linda Trimble took at the southwest Florida wingding.\n\nThere are two obituaries to report. August VanDessel Jr. of Arlington, Virginia, succumbed to Parkinson’s disease at Northern Virginia Hospital on January 13. Augie was born to immigrant parents in Bloomfield, New Jersey, dropped out of Dartmouth in 1955 to join the U.S. Air Force, and earned a B.A. in accounting at Duke University. He remained active in Dartmouth alumni affairs. He worked for the National Park Service, then the U.S. State Department, and was an avid watch and clock collector.\n\nDonald Wood Mansfield of Florham Park, New Jersey, died on January 24. He was born in Brooklyn, New York, and lived for many years in Great River, New York, before relocating to New Jersey four years ago with his wife, Pamela, who survives him. A member of Delta Kappa Epsilon in Hanover, he majored in English and earned a double degree in language and theology at Hofstra University after a tour of duty in the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division. Known as a natural-born language teacher, at both high school and college levels, his hobbies were collecting antique cars and trucks and flying planes, including a lightweight aircraft Donald and his brother-in-law designed and built.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nBut for the Herculean efforts of Frank Gould, turnout at the upcoming October 11-13 fall mini-reunion in Hanover figured to be quite light—coming so soon after our 60th, and with the Lyme Inn, our usual haunt, jacking its rates into the stratosphere. But Frank, reunion organizer extraordinaire, has met the challenge.\n\nFrank presented his 2019 plan on a late winter class officer phone call. On the line were John Trimble in tropical Florida and Dave Bradley in minus-something Hanover. The others were Sam Smith, Mike Simberkoff, Jack Bennett, Gersh Abraham, Walt Vail, Hal Bernsen and yours truly.\n\nThis year we’ll shift to the Marriott Courtyard, near the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. Frank has negotiated a block of rooms at special rates. The Saturday night banquet there will be served by five-star-rated Maple Street Catering of White River Junction, Vermont. Frank’s also arranged for frequent shuttle service to and from Hanover. We can also view Friday’s Dartmouth Night festivities from the Hanover Inn while munching snacks in a room just off the lobby. Saturday’s class meeting and pre-game tailgate party at Dave’s office are walking distance from the football game against Yale.\n\nSkip Coggin writes that he loved the colorful Hood Museum reopening photos in the February Sound & Fury. He and Liz are wintering in Naples, Florida.\n\nWard Burian has published a second book, The Creation of the American States. Check out excerpts on Amazon. He and Martha alternate between residences on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and Virginia, where Betsy Jo and Jim Spence are Williamsburg neighbors.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA, 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nSomewhere—perhaps in a presidential tweet from John Trimble—I read that the great class of ’58 numbers 440 or so, but is projected to end 2019 at precisely 414. Is that why Pete Olsen just sent me wisecracks about “playing the back nine?”\n\nTwo well-earned Williamson awards were presented at the October 26-28 mini-reunion in Hanover—to Jack Bennett and Mel Alperin. Mel’s was accepted in absentia by Mark Alperin ’80, as his dad recovered from hip surgery.\n\nFive classmates need to be remembered.\n\nRudolph Struever of Greenville, Ohio, died on June 17, 2018. A sociology major, he belonged to the DCU, DOC, and International Relations Club.\n\nCarter Elwood of Ottawa, Ontario, died on September 22, 2018, following an accident. A Ph.D. in Russian history, he taught at Carleton University, wrote nine books, including The Non-Geometric Lenin, and owned four Siberian huskies.\n\nLarry Shaw of Seattle, his hometown, died on September 23, 2018. With an L.L.B. from Washington, he practiced general law; with an L.L.M. he specialized in estate planning and taxation. He loved to fly and sail.\n\nMike Dikman of Roslyn, New York, died on October 7, 2018. A graduate of Cornell Law, he was a handball hall-of-famer who won 23 national titles. He was also a talented magician who performed before the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers the night before he died.\n\nRichard Reycroft of Pembroke, New Hampshire, died on October 25, 2018. A botany major in Hanover and avid gardener, he was a budget supervisor for the State of New Hampshire. He enjoyed woodcarving and genealogical research.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA, 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nBlame it on an uncooperative calendar. The October 28 deadline for this column falls on the weekend of our Homecoming mini-reunion in Hanover, so new news and views from classmates gleaned thereat will have to wait for the next Class Notes column two months hence. Alas.\n\nIf past is prologue, those of us who couldn’t be there missed a lively Saturday class dinner at the Lyme Inn, arranged by Frank Gould and presided over by John Trimble. Not to mention the pre-Harvard game brunch hosted by Dave Bradley following the class meeting, where Sam Smith and Mike Simberkoff debuted in their respective new jobs of vice president and treasurer. Homecoming postscript from John: The weather was “awful” and the Green “won a squeaker” over Harvard.\n\nWe have three departures to report since our super 60th reunion in June. One is the tragic death of Bob Gilges and his wife, Carroll, in a flash flood last spring on their way home from a family function in Virginia. Bob retired in 1995 after a distinguished career in management consultancy at KPMG.\n\nJohn Kavanagh sends word of Dan Palant’s passing on August 18, 2018, of complications following a fall at his home in Lexington, Massachusetts. The musically adept Dan was John’s roommate in Hanover and lifelong buddy. His tribute to his pal will appear in the next Sound & Fury newsletter.\n\nThe most recent death notice from Hanover informs us of Stephen Jay Wilson’s September 6, 2018, passing from causes unknown in Rancho Santa Margarita, California. Steve spent his career in the paper industry, where he served in a series of top-level corporate positions.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA, 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nReverting to his traditional role, 60th co-chair Frank Gould will be hosting the ’58 mini-reunion during the October 26-28 Homecoming Weekend, as this column, written in August, reaches you. It’ll feature Friday’s post-bonfire to-do at Lewiston Depot in Norwich, Vermont, and Saturday’s class meeting at the Black Center in Hanover and the pregame tailgate at Dave Bradley’s nearby law office, and after the Harvard football game, the gala class banquet at the Lyme Inn. Late-deciders, contact Frank or treasurer Mike Simberkoff, per Frank’s “Go Big Green” July mailing.\n\nSpeaking of the fall mini, class veep Sam Smith proposes changing its timing permanently to an earlier, warmer, leafier, less-congested early October date. John Trimble has Sam’s proposal on his meeting agenda for this year’s mini. The consensus in an August conference call of class officers and committee chairs was keen on Sam’s idea. That call, by the way, marked John’s kickoff of his laudable, unprecedented presidential second term. Wah-hoo-wah, John!\n\nOther takeaways from that conference call (which occur at least bimonthly) included an affirmation of class solvency, even after the on-budget cost of June’s super 60th reunion; a reminder to remember the Class of 1958 Scholarship Fund in our wills; recognition of the multiple roles still played by Ralph Manuel (memorial books, Williamson awards, etc); and an excellent suggestion by Hal Bernsen to publicize administration contacts for classmates with grievances about the College and how it’s run today. Take note, Frank Gado, Cack Bittner,and others.\n\nSee future “Beef Box” sections of The Sound & Fury.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA, 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nWhen this column hits your mailbox, our 60th reunion, slated for June 11-14 in Hanover, will have just ended. Judging from late April signups received by registration chief Dan O’Hara,attendance could brush close to 150, somewhat better than par for 60th reunions. Not only is that a tribute to the meticulous year-long efforts of the reunion planning team co-chaired by Gersh Abraham and Frank Gould—jokingly dubbed “Gersh Gould and Frank Abraham” by John Trimble in a recent president’s letter—but success will also owe much to the home-stretch heroics of reunion communications chief Walter Vail, who’ll try to spur additional attendance by organizing a late-spring barrage of personal telephone calls and emails to fraternity brothers, athletic teammates, and other affinity groups of yesteryear.\n\nBesides the aforesaid efforts of Dan, Walt, and John, other stellar performances were apparent during an April 20 conference call held by Gersh and Frank to review, and make last-minute tweaks to, progress reports by more than a dozen planning team members. Weighing in, for instance, were Hal Bernsen, who is in charge of the post-reunion gathering at the Woodstock Inn in Vermont; Dave Bradley, who is in charge of both entertainment and beverages; Pete Kelsey, who will preside over the memorial service honoring deceased classmates at Rollins Chapel; Andy Toorock, who has organized a breakfast for the numerous ’58 U.S. Marines; and Skip Coggin, who is arranging both the golf and the reunion souvenirs (handsome green “Class of 1958” vests for each attendee).\n\nWinter, less happily, took its toll on our class with the passing of seven members since the last Class Notes column. Alphabetically, the departed include Richard Darby of Normandy Beach, New Jersey, on March 8; Clayton Freeman of Sherman Oaks, California, on August 16, 2017; John Goodnow of Peterborough, New Hampshire, on February 7; Louis Levy of Key West, Florida, on March 15; Robert Meyerson of Cleveland on April 15; Douglas Pease of Carmel Valley, California, on January 1; and Robert Thompson of Carefree, Arizona, on February 22. Look for fuller obits in the next Sound & Fury newsletter following the June reunion.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA, 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nAs I scribble these notes to meet the DAM’s late February deadline, not a single one of us is actually registered for the June 11-14 60th reunion. That process begins March 1, says registration maven Dan O’Hara, who reports still-rising intended attendance. Now, 84 classmates say they plan to come and 59 say they will probably attend. That portends a super turnout when you add all the spouses, family and friends who will also come. But remember: It is still necessary to register. How? Just notify Dan at danoh.lyme@gmail.com or (603) 795-2633. He adds: “The College handles the assignment of dorm rooms on a first-come, first-served basis, so register early.” For further details, contact reunion cochairs Gersh Abraham or Frank Gould.\n\nOur Florida crowd once again held two wintertime mini-reunions during February—both featuring spirited appearances by Dartmouth football coach Buddy Teevins ’79. The east coasters met on February 18, the west coasters the next day at Bonita Springs, after which John Trimble filed a report that will run in the March Sound & Fury newsletter. Both minis were attended by classmate Sandy Bromwell, who sent photos also destined for the S&F. There’s not space here to list the attendees, who totaled around 50.\n\nSince the last S&F we’ve lost five classmates. William Caley of Stephenson, Michigan, died on November, 22, 2017; Charles Henderson of Castle Rock, Colorado, died on November 27, 2017; Kynaston McShine, longtime curator of New York’s Museum of Modern Art, died on January 8; Doug Pease of Carmel, California, died on January 16; and John Goodnow of Peterborough, New Hampshire, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, died on February 7.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA, 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nAs our 60th reunion year dawns, and our girdled earth faces many challenges, we can take both pleasure and solace in reporting the latest attendance figures for our June 11 to 14 get-together in Hanover. Slated for the Monday through Thursday period following the hectic Commencement week, the reunion’s early-stage attendance figures look very promising indeed. In the latest conference call of our class officers and a dozen committee chairs convened by president John Trimble in mid-December, reunion co-chairs Gersh Abraham and Frank Gould reported the latest numbers. According to the attendance chief Dan O’Hara, no fewer than 70 classmates and 72 guests, or a total of 142, had indicated that they will attend the 60th, with 44 others saying they hope to be on hand in Hanover. That puts the attendance goal of 225 classmates and guests well within reach, with six months still to go.\n\nIf you are still sitting on the fence about attending, be advised that two equally enticing ancillary reunion events are also well along in the planning process. Prior to the reunion, there will be an overnight visit to the newly renovated Moosilauke Ravine Lodge in Warren, New Hampshire, for which you must make separate arrangements (apart from those for the reunion itself). Call (603) 764-5858 for details or contact the aforesaid class officers. According to Hanover-based Ralph Manuel, who attended last fall’s reopening of the Ravine Lodge after a year of reconstruction, the lodge is “beyond spectacular and well worth a visit.” Or words to that effect. Doubtless by then the Sound & Fury newsletter will have conveyed some photographic evidence to back up Ralph’s enthusiasm.\n\nIn addition, Admiral Hal Bernsen has stepped to the helm and taken command of organizing a post-reunion trip, something on the order of the memorable visit many of us made to the Trapp Family Lodge in northern Vermont after our 50th reunion in 2008. In making your reunion plans you will want to set aside a couple of extra days to enjoy that added opportunity, as Larry Weltin’s punchy reunion motto puts it, to “Relax! Reconnect! Reminisce!”\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Forest-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nRelax! Reconnect! Reminisce!That’s what our upcoming 60th reunion is all about. Hope to see you there June 11 through 14! That three-word theme—deftly crafted by Larry Weltin—drew a great initial response. Dan O’Hara reported in October that 135 classmates and others would attend, with many maybes. When you read this in December, the drum-beating by Walt Vail, reunion communications chief, and reunion co-chairs Frank Gould and Gersh Abraham will have upped the attendance count considerably. Those four days in June, after the Commencement hoopla in Hanover, should see abundant early-summer sunshine and moderate temperatures. And there’s still time to make plans to attend.\n\nWe’re assigned the same comfortable dorm on East Wheelock Street facing the old gym, as at our 50th, near planned events. It’s a great place just to hang out—to relax, reconnect and reminisce! There’ll also be an art exhibit and undergrad memorabilia exhibit in a secure space. But if you sally forth, vans will be available to haul us to meals, banquets and shopping.\n\nClarification regarding the pre-reunion and post-reunion options—that is, the preceding overnight at Moosilauke Ravine Lodge and the post-reunion get-together off-campus (like the delightful three days at Trapp Family Lodge after the 50th): Be advised that both are separate from the reunion itself. You must make and pay for your own reservations. Call the Ravine Lodge at (603) 764-5858 after March 1. When this was written, the post-reunion location hadn’t been determined, Also, Gersh and Frank were seeking volunteers to run it, as well as folks to run the reunion’s art and memorabilia exhibits. Memorabilia? Any personal items from undergrad days that might amuse or interest.\n\nWe will have one more “every-fifth-year” reunion in 2023, partially subsidized by the College. But we’ll still convene annually at Homecomings in October, wintertime banquets in Florida and luncheon minis in Vermont. So come to this major reunion if you can! Who knows? As often happens, you just might meet your “newest best friend”—a classmate you never really knew before—while you relax, reconnect and reminisce June 11 to 14.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nThe August Sound & Fury and a September formal invite have long since reported the salient details about our 60th reunion.\n\nThe dates are June 11 to 14, 2018, the week after Commencement. Running the show will be co-chairs Gersh Abraham and Frank Gould. Their reunion committee, the guys and gals in charge of everything from entertainment, special events to local transportation and daily meals, include Mel Alperin, Jack Bennett, Sandy Bromwell, Dave Bradley, Skip Coggin, John Coulter, Sheila Herman, Sheila Kabat, Pete Kelsey, Steve Nichols, Dan O’Hara, Skip Raymond, Frank Sands, Norm Sylvester and Walter Vail. (Walt, sorry that a fat-finger typing error left you out of the August Sound & Fury listing.)\n\nRelax! Reconnect! Reminisce! That alliterative triad is the theme of the reunion, crafted by the fertile mind of Larry Weltin, who ran the 55th in 2013. Short and sweet, his words say it all as far as the reunion planners are concerned. It will be held a week after the College’s Commencement week crush, we hope amid summery early June weather. Accommodations and principal events taking place will be readily accessible by all, be it on foot or via rented vans.\n\nIn the works too is a memorial service at Rollins Chapel with the Rev. Pete Kelsey officiating. And, of course, the ritual class photograph on the steps of Dartmouth Hall, plus a windup class banquet the final night, plus the class meeting at which successors to class officers Trimble, Sylvester, Bennett and Quickel will be voted into office for the next five years.\n\nThe 60th is the last reunion sanctioned by the College. But rest assured that we’ll still be getting together at mini-reunions—such as the Homecoming mini in the fall, the Florida minis in the winter and the luncheon mini Frank has staged every June at the Norwich Inn in Vermont.\n\nBy the time you receive this column, written in late August, there’ll still be plenty of time to arrange to meet old friends, brothers, teammates and surviving spouses next June 11-14. So get on the horn now while the thought is fresh in mind. See you there!\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nAs reported in the Sound & Fury by president John Trimble, the March 16 Florida mini-reunion at Cooper’s Hawk Winery & Restaurant in Naples, Florida, where they brew their own stuff, was a howling success. Organized by Roger Bruttomesso, Bill Cutcliffe andJane Yusen, the attendees also included Bill Allyn, Dave Sharrock, Ned Stedham, Myles Slosberg, Hank Milton, Tryg Myhren, Dave Chapin, Paul Robinson and Sam Smith, with numerous spouses. See the S&F for photos by First Lady Linda Trimble.\n\nThe S&F will also have covered the class luncheon staged during Commencement week each June by Frank Gould. Featured speaker was John Murphy, who regaled two dozen or so classmates with memories of his years as a football third stringer for the Big Green. As you read this, you may already have received Frank’s invite this year to the Homecoming mini on October 6-8 in Hanover, to be held during warmer weather and better leaf-peeping than usual. Mark your calendars for next summer’s 60th reunion the second week in June 2018.\n\nRecent communications with ’58s range from encouragement by Frank Gado to explore the College’s $112-million operating loss in 2016 to an upbeat report by Gersh Abraham about fundraising efforts by Dave Bradley in the annual Prouty Bike Race for charity and jointly by Mel Alperin, Frank Blatz, Ben McAdams and Gersh to remember the College in our wills.\n\nAlas, there are many ’58 departures to report. Chronologically, Hugh R. Fox of Lincoln, New Mexico, died August 8, 2016; Louis J. Vallone of East Greenwich, Rhode Island, died October 28, 2016; Samuel V. “Van” Gilbert of Pleasanton, California, died November 1, 2016; Stephen W. Dunn of Goshen, Connecticut, died January 23; Michael J. McKeown, M.D., of Beaverton, Oregon, died January 26; Walter E. Busker of Chicago died February 27; Robert W. Amis of Dallas died February 25; Paul H. Frankel of Oceanport, New Jersey, died February 28; Theodore K. Furber of Eden Prairie, Minnesota, died March 8; and Robert J. Eleveld of Grand Rapids, Michigan, died on March 18, one day after hosting a “NoBituary Party” attended by more than 500 well-wishers.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nAbout to shove off in late June for our family’s annual sojourn into the Adirondacks, a reminder from Hanover jogged my memory that this September-October Class Notes column was due. Happily, you guys have kept my inbox for the column and The Sound & Fury newsletter pretty full. In fact, you will have read one or two new S&Fs before you receive this column. So I’ll use this space to talk up two reunions.\n\nOur 60th reunion will be upon us before you know it—on June 11-14, 2018. Do try to make it if you can. Next year’s get-together will be held the week after Commencement, when we will share the post-50th honors with the 55-year-out ’63s. Our own 55th in 2013, masterfully managed by Larry Weltin, was a howling, if rainy, success. John Trimble and the enlarged executive committee have not yet named a 60th chairman. But chances are he will plan most of the events for, in and around Hanover to ease motoring between them.\n\nAlso consider the October 6-7 Homecoming Weekend and its customary class of ’58 fall mini-reunion. It has been advanced this year to a warmer weekend when the New England leaves will be at their colorful best. Mini planner Frank Gould will have long since sent out his first invite in July, though there’s still time for a last-minute decision to come to the mini. Frank says we’ll once again share the Lyme Inn with the ’57s for our Saturday night class banquet. The Saturday morning class meeting will be near Dave Bradley’s pre-game brunch and Memorial Stadium, where the Big Green will take on Yale. Friday night we’ll convene again at Lewiston Station in Norwich, Vermont.\n\nAmong the most interesting items to arrive in the S&F editor’s inbox, by the way, comes from Walter Vail about Libby Parker’s photography show at Boston’s Robert Klein Gallery called Vanishing in Plain Sight. It reflects on husband John Parker’s descent into Alzheimer’s for several years before his death last December. See the last S&F for details.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA 19093; steve58@quickel.net\n\nAttention, Northeastern ’58s! Don’t miss the annual Norwich Inn luncheon to be staged by Frank Gould on Friday, June 2. The star attraction will be John Murphy,reflecting, says Frank, “on football stories from his days as a third-stringer for the Big Green.” Socializing starts at noon, lunch at 12:45. Who knows when it will end? Roger Bruttomesso told us in February about the upcoming March 16 Florida winter mini-reunion. Previously held at toney country clubs, Roger moved it to the distinctive Cooper’s Hawk Winery and Restaurant in Naples. Among the expected attendees (all but one with a spouse): Dave Sharrock, Bill Cutcliffe, John Trimble, Jane Yusen, Tryg Myhren, Paul Robinson, Dave Chapin and Sam Smith.\n\nNote two upcoming big reunions in Hanover. At the October 6-8 Homecoming mini, overseen by Dave Bradley and Frank Gould,we will again pair with the ’57s at the Lyme Inn for the concluding class banquet—with the Friday bonfire, beer and pizza party at Lewiston Station, Vermont, and the Saturday class meeting and pre-football game brunch at Dave’s law offices .\n\nThe biggest biggie will be our 60th reunion the week after Commencement in June 2018. John Trimble is looking for a reunion chairman. Care to volunteer? Mark both events on your calendar now.\n\nWe note two recent partings. Van Gilbert of Pleasanton, California, died on November 1, 2016. Writes John Kavanagh, “Van, myself and Steve Nichols came to Hanover from Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, and remained friends.” Van, a ceramic engineer, moved west when his company was acquired by Kaiser Aluminum.\n\nOn December 8, 2016, we lost John Parker of Manchester, Massachusetts, to Alzheimer’s, says wife Libby. A Tuck graduate and Delta Tau Delta brother, John grew up in Waban, Massachusetts, and eventually formed a successful Boston investment company with his brother, Brooks Parker ’55, Tu’56, and served on a slew of prestigious boards. A true man of Dartmouth, John was a highly active alum and his son, daughter and sundry other relatives attended the College. John also chaired the Peabody Essex Museum in nearby Salem, Massachusetts.\n\n—Steve Quickel, 411 North Middletown Road, Apt. F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nThe last Class Notes column was written October 26, just before more than 50 of us convened for our autumn Homecoming mini-reunion. You’ll receive this column, written New Year’s week 2016, in the alumni magazine delivered in late February. If some of the news is four to six months old, blame DAM’s ill-timed deadlines.\n\nHomecoming weather in October was like February: very cold and very wet. (Yours truly encountered four inches of snow when I stayed overnight in Saratoga Springs, New York, on the way to Hanover!) Many folks skipped the rain-drenched Harvard game, which we lost by only two points. But we had a great time anyway, thanks to the efforts of principal arrangers Frank Gould and Dave Bradley. The class meeting on Saturday was better attended than previous Friday sessions, though it began late when some classmates were steered to the wrong room. Treasurer Jack Bennett chaired in veep Norm Sylvestor’s absence when prez John Trimble was unavoidably detained. It included a thank-you appearance by Mychaela Anderson ’20 from Oahu, Hawaii, the first recipient from the class of 1958 scholarship fund. Saturday’s banquet, with ’58s and ’57s taking over both Lyme Inn dining rooms, was boisterous and punctuated by much class mingling. Faraway travelers included Tryg Mhyren from Denver and Skip Coggin and Jerry Manne from Chicago-land.\n\nThere were two recent lifetime achievement award winners: Bob Eleveld, for service to “justice” by the Grand Rapids (Michigan) Bar Association, and Mel Alperin, who was named to the Pawtucket (Rhode Island) Hall of Fame for “helping to advance and grow the city in a variety of ways.”\n\nAtop everyone’s list of 2016’s best books is The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead, son of Archie Whitehead, and a 16-week New York Times bestseller as we write. It’s a “hard-to-put-down” novel about a runaway slave girl’s perilous journey from a horrific Georgia plantation on a network envisioned as actual tracks and tunnels. Don’t miss it!\n\nLou Vallone of East Greenwich, Rhode Island, died October 28. A Deke who was active in the DOC, Lou went to Boston University Law and practiced privately. Father of five, he was an avid fly fisherman.\n\n—Steve Quickel, Lima Estates, 411 North Middletown Road, F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nThis column was submitted back on October 28 as our Homecoming mini-reunion began, owing to DAM’s oddball deadline. Tonight, says mini-guy Frank Gould, more than 50 classmates and guests will meet at Lewiston Depot in Norwich, Vermont, for beer and pizza after the Dartmouth Night bonfire. Tomorrow we convene for the annual class meeting, Dave Bradley brunch, Harvard game and class dinner. The fall colors will have peaked.\n\nJohn Trimble reports that Bob Eleveld is Lifetime Achievement awardee of the Grand Rapids (Michigan) Bar Association. Bob “sounds terrific” as he rehabs from blood cancer treatments at Ohio State University. John notes that Mel Alperin’s son, Mark ’80, is “in line” to become president of the Class Presidents Association. Friends of Jim Meeker please note his new address: POB 6126, Alameda, CA 94501.\n\nThere are two passings to note. Word comes from Bob Bolinger of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, of the July 11 death of Clyde Bomgardner in Mifflintown, Pennsylvania. A graduate of Dickinson College Law in nearby Carlisle, Clyde was district attorney of Juniata County, where he practiced solo many years. Cack Bittner, Ted Harris, Terry Doran and yours truly competed with him in sports in the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, area. An NROTC scholarship student, he was buried with military honors. Note too the death August 6 of Hugh Fox, a Hanover High grad who was a member of the New Hampshire bar and specialized in legal publishing.\n\nMy heartiest thanks to the 100-plus who responded to The Sound & Fury’s revealing “Class of 1958 Prexit Poll” this fall.\n\n—Steve Quickel, Lima Estates, 411 North Middletown Road, F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nWhen you receive this August column in October, a record turnout of ’58s should be poised to converge on Hanover for Homecoming and our October 28-30 fall mini-reunion—judging from hefty advance signups. The weekend includes football vs. Harvard and more convenient class events orchestrated by mini planner Frank Gould and president John Trimble—namely, the Saturday banquet at the “new” Lyme Inn and class meeting Saturday morning at the Black Recreation & Senior Center across the street from Dave Bradley’s pregame brunch.\n\nIf you come for the day, you’re apt to see out-of-towners Tom Maguire (Michigan), Jerry Manne and Gersh Abraham (Illinois), Mike Wygant (Maine), yours truly (Pennsylvania) and new head agent John Coulter (New York), who’s taken over from the late Dick Pew. Also Hal Bernsen and his Virginia pal John Ryan, with wives Mary and Simone. Admiral Hal says the Virginia Maritime Association named sea lawyer John as its 2016 Distinguished Service Award winner. ButFloridian Charlie Pierce will be too busy to come: “Recently I was ‘elected’ a precinct captain for the Seminole County Democratic Party. No one else wanted the job. By a long stretch I am the oldest and least experienced precinct captain in the county. We are out-numbered 2:1.”\n\nTwo classmates have departed since last issue. Word comes from Bill “Moose” Morton ’59 via Coleman Colla that their friend Ed Burns died on July 3 in Kittery, Maine. He’d been in poor health for several years. Services were slated for July 23. Ed and Coleman were Theta Delta Chi roommates. A Deerfield Academy grad and Tuck ’59, Ed was an investment advisor at several household name firms. Nate Palmer of Coupeville, Washington, another Deerfielder, died July 21. A member of Kappa Sigma and Sphinx and an Air Force captain, Nate was born in Boston, grew up and spent his sales and marketing career in Illinois, where he was president of a truck and equipment company. His hobbies were sailing and building tree houses. An active alumnus, Nate wrote in our 50th reunion book that, “I’ve always been proud to be part of Dartmouth, a privilege afforded to so few.”\n\n—Steve Quickel, Lima Estates, 411 North Middletown Road, F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nThe annual Norwich Inn luncheon reunion on June 4 was a well-attended success. It was arranged by Frank Gould, entertained by the presence of John Murphy and enlightened by Peter Speigel, emeritus chairman of the DHMC radiology department. He gave an after-lunch talk titled “The First Clinical X-Ray: A Dartmouth Experiment.” Even a dubious Murphy said he enjoyed Peter’s presentation. Also present were Craig Haines, Frank Sands, Julie and Dan O’Hara, Pat and Jack Bennett, Sue and Ed Olney, Sally and Ralph Manuel, Sheila Herman, Sally Gundy, Sheila Kabat, Marcia Armstrong, Kent Woodger, Dave Payne, Corrine and David Cassidy, Bob Hicken and Barbara Ann Trowbridge, Ann and Dave Bradley, plus Nora Gould and Peregrine Spiegel. Frank also plugged our Homecoming reunion slated for October 28-30, which he orchestrates too, and features home football vs. Harvard and some new wrinkles. Do come!\n\nA note from Jerry Manne tells of attending “an excellent presentation by coach Buddy Teevens about the coming football season” with fellow Chicago area classmates Gersh Abraham and Skip Coggin. Coach also talked about “significant” NCAA and NFL interest in “Dartmouth’s work to minimize concussions with non-contact practices.”\n\nMarine officer Andy Toorock presided as grand marshal of the Memorial Day parade in his hometown of Westborough, Massachusetts. “The Marines sent some fine gentlemen to honor my dad and the other servicemen,” says daughter Lynn Landers. See colorful photo in the latest Sound & Fury.\n\nIt is our sad duty to report several deaths. Dick Pew, hardworking head of our Dartmouth College Fund effort until handing over the job to John Coulter, succumbed to cancer, an ailment he made public last year, in June in Portland, Maine. Andy Thomas of Pinehurst, North Carolina, died in May of his previously reported ailments—having held nearly every class officer job, been named Webmaster of the Year by the College and singlehandedly honchoed installation of the Class of 1958 Clock on Main Street, Hanover. In April Bill Glos reported we’d lost Bob Platt of Mooresville, North Carolina, also very active in class and alumni affairs. Full obits and photos are in the S&F.\n\n—Steve Quickel, Lima Estates, 411 North Middletown Road, F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nBy way of the grapevine, we’ve learned that Ralph Manuel celebrated his 80th in his favorite way—watching his beloved Detroit Tigers play the Orioles in Baltimore hosted by his four sons. Ralph grew up in nearby Brunswick, Maryland.\n\nJohn Sherwood, a Baltimore native who lives in nearby Annapolis, has continued his winning ways as a sailboat racer (begun in Hanover as All New England on the sailing team) and is a volunteer coach of the naval academy’s varsity offshore sailing team.\n\nWe note the passing of two classmates—William N. Kirchner of Chattanooga, Tennessee, on February 21, and David H. “Doc” Rice of Brooklin, Maine, on March 14 after a short illness.\n\nBill Kirchner entered Dartmouth with us in the fall of 1954, but graduated in 1961. We hope his widow, Linda, can fill in the many missing blanks about his life before the next Sound & Fury (S&F) newsletter appears. We do know that he grew up in South Hadley, Massachusetts, and graduated from Northfield Mount Hermon. We also know that he lived many years in Chattanooga with Linda, his second wife, but nothing of what he did there. He is survived by two children from his first marriage. We’re “all ears” to anyone who can tell us more about Bill Kirchner.\n\nDoc Rice is a different matter: We know almost too much about his illustrious and productive life. The short take is that he came to Dartmouth from Deerfield Academy, majored in art and architecture and was All-America captain of the lacrosse team. After Navy officer candidate school he rose to lieutenant commander. After earning a master’s in urban planning at the University of North Carolina, he spent his career in Norfolk, Virginia, heading the redevelopment authority, bringing, by one laudatory account, “downtown and surrounding neighborhoods back to life.” On retirement to Maine in 2001 he took up the fine art of wooden boat building, won renown for his landscape paintings and founded a nonprofit organization that uses boatbuilding to help disadvantaged youth in the Hampton Roads, Virginia, area. More to come about Doc in the next S&F.\n\n—Steve Quickel, Lima Estates, 411 North Middletown Road, F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nAs we write in late February, this year’s Naples, Florida, mini-reunion is slated for March 13. Organized by Barbara and Roger Bruttomesso and graciously hosted by Penny and Bill Allyn at their Royal Poinciana Club, the dinner’s early signups included Cynthia and Dave Chapin; Liz and Skip Coggin; Bill Cutcliffe and granddaughter Emily; Allen Ertel’s widow, Kay; Pat and Fred Hildebrandt; Gloria and Vince Hovenac; Hank Milton; Vicki and Tryg Myhren; Wes and Paul Robinson; Barbara and Dave Sharrock; Linda and John Trimble; and Walt Yusen’s widow, Jane, with husband Dick Norris.\n\nVirginia and Pete Kelsey have endowed the directorship position of the Hood Art Museum in Hanover to a sum “in excess of $10 million,” says the College. Wah-hoo-wah! for the Rev. Pete and talented sculptor “Wink.”\n\nWe note the passing of four classmates. U.S. Congressman Allen Ertel, who missed unseating Pennsylvania’s governor by just 100,000 votes in 1982, died on November 19, 2015. February’s Sound & Fury carried his full obituary, with the following three to appear in the spring newsletter.\n\nFrank Gado sent us the Boston Globe obituary of Delta Kappa Epsilon brother Jim Sullivan, a Massachusetts real estate developer who died of congestive heart failure November 15, 2015.\n\nJohn Murphy wrote of Leon Sinclair’sdeath on November 28, 2015, in Olympia, Washington. Pete, John’s fellow grad at Torrington (Connecticut) High School, was a world-class mountaineer and rescue leader who went west to teach literature at Evergreen College—and was a loyal non-graduate ’58.\n\nCharlie Pierce noted the death of close friend Dave Roak on January 27 in Spruce Head, Maine, after a long illness. Widow Sandra wrote that Dave died of frontotemporal dementia.\n\nSkip Coggin and Liz sold their sumptuous home in Naples to live full-time at the Mather, a “lovely life-care community” in Evanston, Illinois, where he plays tennis with neighbor Gersh Abraham. Count Skip and Pete Flowers amongst possible attendees at the October 28-30 Homecoming miniin Hanover.\n\nMy own “lovely (and lively!) life-care community” near children just west of Philadelphia is the new place to send ’58 news and views—please.\n\n—Steve Quickel, Lima Estates, 411 North Middletown Road, F-310, Media, PA 19063; steve58@quickel.net\n\nIt’s year-end as I write this column, seven years after becoming ’58 secretary, but as it won’t appear until late February, it’s not too soon to make plans to meet at the fall mini-reunion in Hanover. This marvelous get-together will be on Homecoming Weekend, October 28-30, says mini organizer Frank Gould—but with some important changes. We’ll be moving the action back to the Lyme (New Hampshire) Inn, now handsomely renovated by the heirs of Peter Williamson, where we convened years ago. With Breakfast on the Connecticut being sold, most attendees will stay at Lyme Inn. We’ll also meet there for the class banquet on Saturday, October 29 (after football against Harvard!). “It’s really a double Homecoming,” says Frank. Another change: At the suggestion of Mel Alperin and Norm Sylvester, the Friday afternoon class meeting will be moved back to Hanover on Saturday morning, just before Dave Bradley’s pre-game brunch and Marching Band concert near Memorial Stadium (now renovated with safer access and comfier seats). All this should draw greater mini-reunion attendance and enhance opportunities for camaraderie. So start planning now for Hanover in October.\n\nJohn Trimble’s presidential letter about the Black Lives Matter fracas at Baker Library just before the College’s month-long December winter break, went out to all classmates. With eyewitness input from Hanover resident Ralph Manuel, John clarified media reports reflecting ill on Da"
