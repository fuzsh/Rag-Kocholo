The ending certainly wasn't what I had expected; brain cancer sucks. Not going to dwell on what I had no control to change. My life began in Placentia, N.L. on May 13, 1971. I was born the second son to John and Madonna Collins. My eldest brother Gerard (Dana) and I had a very close relationship, best friends from day one. Our youngest brother Mark (deceased) (Grant) who came along four years later made the family whole. We lived a good life with parents who gave everything they could. I have had a great life with the love of my life Michelle. We have been together for 24 wonderful years. We have a son Dylan who is quite an intuitive and clever boy for the tender age of 10. I will miss them both, but will always be there for them in their hearts and in all of the wonderful memories we have had. We have always had a passion for travel, movies and all outdoor activities. I will certainly miss swim ming, skating and sliding with Dylan. Michelle's parents, Gordon and Theresa Whittle of Bay L'Argent, N.L. have lovingly welcomed me into their lives from the first day I met them. Her brother Gordie (Beth), sisters, Rita (Peter), Connie (Chris), Darlene (Daniel), Paula (Keith), Tanya (Dwayne) and Patricia (Chad) have all been a great support to us over the years. Much love to my nieces and nephews: Hayley, Noah, Nicholas, Aaron, Katie, Tiffany, Whitney, Tristan, Matthew, Adam, Caelan, Avah, Brooke, Eugene, Cameron, Chloe, Gabrielle, Thomas, Charlotte and Ryan. I joined the Canadian Forces in 1992 at age 21. My first ship was HMCS Iroquois. In 2000, I joined HMCS Athabaskan. Shortly after the attacks of 911, I was attached to Iroquois again as we sailed for Op Apollo in the Persian Gulf. In 2012, as a Lieutenant, I left my military career after 20 years of service with the Royal Canadian Navy. The military gave me a great life. After retirement, I joined the Department of Community Services for two years. My last position was with Defence Research and Development Canada. So as I sign off, I would like to recognize and thank some special people who have been near and dear to my heart over the years. Aunt Eileen (deceased), Margaret, Serge (deceased), Trent, Rick - you have been good people. A huge thank you for your support to our friends and colleagues at the Defence Research and Development Canada Atlantic and the Nova Scotia Public Service Commission.

On the day before the Shawinigan left port on its final mission, Don Lovell came down with appendicitis. He was removed from the ship almost as it was leaving the pier. His removal so sudden and quick that there was no time to change the listing of the ships crew members. As a result, when the ship left harbour he was still listed as part of the ships' complement. A few days later, while still in hospital, he received word that the ship had been sunk with the loss of all hands. He knew that the Navy would send his wife a telegram stating his death, so he phone her from the hospital telling her his story. A few days later his wife did indeed receive a black-bordered telegram announcing his death. Upon recovery and discharge from hospital, he was reassigned to HMCS Toronto. His family remembers him telling them that his primary duty on the Shawinigan was as a radio operator.

(The North Shore News 08 Jan 2017)\n\nHMCS PRINCE ROBERT - Appointed to Prince Robert as SLt, RCNVR, promoted to Lt (E), RCNVR 07 Jun 1943\n\nPOLLARD, Edward - Born Nov 9, 1925, entered into rest peacefully on December 28, 2016 after struggles with dementia and pneumonia at the Kelowna General Hospital aged 91 years. Edward will be lovingly remembered by daughter Dale, grandson James Pollard Field, nieces Pamela Kertland, Heather Kertland (Tom Brown), nephew Scott Kertland (Cherie), half stepsister, Dorisa Faith, and fellow matelots of the Kelowna Naval Veterans Association. Edward was predeceased by his wife, Joann, parents Roscoe and Elizabeth Pollard, brothers John and Richard, and far too many dear friends and shipmates to list As a boy, he delighted in joining his pals on their bikes, riding all day and chasing through the streets of Toronto whenever an aircraft flew overhead. His idyllic boyhood was shattered when his father, a CPR workman died far from home. Without social services to help, his fragile mother lost her boys to foster care, and they were scattered. Starting his naval life as a boy sailor in the Merchant Marine at the start of WWII, Edward joined the Royal Canadian Navy in 1941. Primarily serving on the HMCS Uganda (the only ship of the entire war to serve in every battle station) Edward was discharged in Vancouver at war's end. After the war, he trained as a surveyor, and spent several years surveying the North of Superior section of the new TCH. He met a pretty, shy, blonde in Winnipeg, named Joann Nielsen, and they ran off to be married in Sault Ste. Marie, honeymooning in the caboose of a CPR train. Wishing to establish roots, he began work for General Motors in Oshawa and took advantage of the Veterans Land Act to purchase their first home on Harmony Road. Following their daughter west, Ed and Joann moved to Kelowna in 1987, after Ed's 1985 retirement from GM. It was after his retirement that Edward and his brother John were re-united with his long-lost mother, Elizabeth (shortly before her death), brother Richard and step-sister Dorisa. Hobbies included fishing, writing poetry and amusing newsletters on his computer, golf, horseback riding, reading Shakespeare, and running in the Terry Fox run for nearly ten years. After his wife passed away, Edward loved to spend mornings with his great pals, The Capri Coffee Gang; Keith, Big Al, Fred, Mel, Len, Bill and Charlotte. His great happiness was meeting with his fellow naval vets for barbeques and fundraisers for cancer research, retired veterans and widows in need, and several local groups. Edward's family would like to thank the doctors and nurses of 4B KGH, the staff of Orchard Manor who took such loving care of him in his last months, and the good men and women of the KNVA, especially Dick Fletcher who, while dealing with their own health issues have stayed together to help those in need. A celebration of Edward's life will take place Saturday, January 14, at 1915 Pacific Court, 11:00 AM, followed by a reception. No flowers, please. Donations gratefully accepted by the KNVA's Tom Morgan Benevolent Society for the benefit of naval vets in need.

Naval veterans of every age are still in need, though there are many dedicated people who work for Veterans Affairs, like Cindy in Penticton, who strive tirelessly for our veterans. (The Okanagan Valley Newspaper Group 10 Jan 2017)\n\nHMCS UGANDA\n\nMcBEAN, Frederick Allan Donald (Al) - of Calgary, Alberta, peacefully \"slipped the surly bonds of earth\" in the early evening of Thursday, January 5, 2017, surrounded by family. Al was born on November 7, 1925, a third-generation Calgarian and younger brother to his twin sisters, Doris and Norma. He graduated from Crescent Heights High School before joining the Canadian Navy at the age of seventeen. Upon his return from service, he worked briefly for Canadian Pacific Railway. It was on a fateful train trip to Edmonton that Al met the love of his life, Esther McAllister, who was returning home to Innisfail, AB. Al and Esther married in the summer of 1948, and celebrated their sixty- ninth wedding anniversary in July of 2016. Children Linda, Karen and Ken completed the family in that order. Al was an employee of the Calgary Board of Education for most of his working life. He retired from the position of Corporate Secretary in 1981. His retirement was filled with friends, projects, golf, gardening, cross-country skiing, travel, genealogy research, lunches at the Kensington Legion, getaways to Victoria, BC, and volunteer work. He was a docent at the Naval Museum of Alberta at Tecumseh and at the Military Museums of Calgary for many years, giving up that role only in September 2016, when forced to do so by failing health. Al, also affectionately known as \"Mickey\" (for a propensity to draw the famous Mouse) and \"Rugged\" (a self- assessment that apparently preceded a dramatic collapse at a local blood drive), was a great man by any measure. He was a consummate gentleman with a strong love of family, a wicked sense of comedic timing, and a glorious head of hair. He was immeasurably considerate, quietly gregarious, and intensely loyal. He gathered, and kept close, countless friends over the years, many from as early as Grade 1. He was a long-time member of the Elks Golf Club before moving to Shaganappi as his 'home course' after he and Esther moved from their Highwood home to the Manor at Garrison Woods in 2010. At the Manor, he quickly surrounded himself with more good friends and settled into his new surroundings with ease and enthusiasm. He was always vitally interested in the lives and activities of everyone he knew but maintained an equally abiding curiosity in the world around him. He was current on everything from world politics to celebrity gossip to the last. He made us proud. Al leaves behind his loving wife, Esther; his sister Doris McBean; sister-in-law Muriel Reidy; his children Linda Raasveldt, Karen McBean (Paul Murray), and Ken McBean (Carol Chapman); grandchildren Brian Murray, Erin Murray, Barbara McBean, Jacqueline McBean, Kiri McBean; niece Kathy McLellan; nephew Duane Sharman (Maureen Sullivan); nieces and nephews Nicki Wilson and Jack, Garth and Bob Burak; surrogate daughter Donna Crawford; and lifelong friends Jack McDonald and Don Flemons. Al's final months were trying ones. They were made more bearable for all of us by the support of family and friends, and by the staff at the Foothills Medical Centre, Tom Baker Cancer Centre, and Rosedale Hospice. We would particularly like to acknowledge the staff and volunteers at Rosedale Hospice for the care and compassion they extended to us all over the last three weeks. We could not have imagined a more nurturing environment. You are very special people and we thank you.

Born in Victoria in 1924, Alan was a World War II veteran who served as a Royal Canadian Navy wireless operator on a corvette during the Battle of the Atlantic and later as a physical training instructor (PTI). Upon returning to Victoria in 1946, he married Jean Anne Maggs of Vermilion, Alberta who became the rock of his life. That year, he became one of the first members of the Saanich Fire Fighters Union. In 1952, Alan signed up for a three-year stint as a Royal Canadian Air Force Training Officer at the Royal Military College Saint-Jean, Quebec, after which the family returned to Victoria when Alan joined the Department of National Defence (DND) as a fire fighter. Over the years, Alan rose to become Base Fire Chief of DND Dockyard, Esquimalt until his retirement in 1989. Jean passed away in 2004. Despite this huge loss, Alan continued to live a remarkably healthy and independent life. Always physically active, Alan had been an occasional amateur boxer and wrestler, but his real enthusiasm was for weight training, an activity he began at 17, and continued for 75 years. Extraordinarily, at the age of 91, Alan gained national and international fame as an elite senior athlete after entering his first powerlifting competition at the 100% Raw Powerlifting Federation Championships in Calgary. On June 5, 2016, he set the federation's national and world records for the bench press in the 90-Plus Age Category. True to form, Alan passed away while exercising in his home gym.

Born in Hamilton, Ont., he was a son of the late Richard and Florence (Scrivens) Freeman. A veteran of the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), he retired after 35 years of service. In 1935, he joined the RCN as a 16-year-old Boy Seaman and, displaying outstanding seamanship and academic prowess, he quickly rose up the ranks. He served at sea throughout the duration of the Second World War, initially on patrol and escort duty in the North Sea and throughout the Iceland-Faroes-UK gap and then escorting convoys on the treacherous North Atlantic and Murmansk Run, always on destroyers. Russ was promoted to Torpedo Officer in February 1943 at the age of 24, a remarkable achievement after just over seven years in the RCN. As a Torpedo Officer, he served in the renowned HMCS HAIDA, where he was recognized with a Mention in Dispatches on January 1, 1945. Post-War duties included an appointment as Mine Disposal Officer, West Coast. Service in the Korean War was in the Tribal-class destroyer HMCS HURON. After the Korean War, he was granted Command of HMCS CORDOVA, a minesweeper on the West Coast which always remained one of his fondest memories of service. In Ottawa, he was the Director of the Undersea Warfare and Mine Countermeasures section before being seconded to the Royal Navy in the early 1960s. After three years in Portsmouth he returned to Halifax to finish his career at Maritime Command in Halifax as Commander of the First Canadian Escort Squadron. Following his military career, he served many years on the Nova Scotia Voluntary Economic Planning Board responsible for the tourism sector. He was very well-respected in the RCN and the NS Government and greatly admired and loved by his three children, seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild. As a reflection of his penchant for lifelong learning, he amassed an impressive library throughout his lifetime and never stopped acquiring new skills, whether scuba diving or learning to fly at the tender age of 70! He loved sailing, reading, his cats and his summer home on Zwicker Island in Mahone Bay. He is survived by daughter, Laura Penelope Freeman, Halifax; son, Kim Freeman (Marilyn), Johannesburg, South Africa; daughter, Pamela Florence Farner (Shawn), Toronto, Ont.; grandchildren, Sean, Sabrina, Nadja, Mikhail, Julia, Charles, James and greatgrandchild, Sebastien; and his nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his wife, Margaret Elizabeth (Elliott) Freeman and brother, Alfred 'Fred' James Freeman (Ethel). Cremation will take place. Donations in memory may be made to the Royal Canadian Naval Trust, Canadian Cancer Society or a charity of your choice. He will be greatly missed.\n\nPhoto of Russell Freeman\n\nHMCS SAGUENAY\n\nHMCS KOOTENAY\n\nHMCS HAIDA - Served in HAIDA in 1944 as Gnr (T), RCN\n\nHMCS HURON\n\nHMCS CORDOVA - 2nd Commanding Officer"
