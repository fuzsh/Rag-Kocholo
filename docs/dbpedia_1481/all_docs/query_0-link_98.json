        "text": "Biography by James H. Capshew, Associate Professor of History and Philosophy of Science\n\nBRYAN, William Lowe (11 Nov. 1860-21 Nov. 1955), philosopher, psychologist, and educator, was born William Julian Bryan on a farm near Bloomington, Indiana, the son of John Bryan, a Presbyterian minister, and Eliza Jane Philips. In 1876 he entered the preparatory department of Indiana University in Bloomington, which served as the local high school, and the next year he matriculated as a university student. As an undergraduate he developed his skills in public speaking and helped to revive the Indiana Student newspaper in 1882. He became a member of the Specialists' Club organized by David Starr Jordan, professor of natural sciences, to encourage promising students to pursue research careers. Bryan was graduated in 1884 with a bachelor's degree in ancient classics.\n\nAfter graduation Bryan was hired as an English instructor in the preparatory department. Within a few months he received an unexpected opportunity to join the regular faculty when the president of the university, Baptist minister Lemuel Moss, and Katherine Graydon, the professor of Greek, were caught up in a romantic scandal and left the university. Bryan was hired as Graydon's replacement, and in early 1885 Jordan was appointed president. Jordan, a noted ichthyologist, placed science at the center of his ideas on educational reform and stressed that \"the highest function of the real university is that of instruction by investigation.\" Working with limited financial support from the state he relied heavily on local talent to fill the ranks of the faculty.\n\nAlthough Bryan earned a master's degree in philosophy at Indiana in 1886 with a thesis on ancient Greek logic, his interests shifted toward the \"new psychology\" that promised to revolutionize the study of human nature through laboratory experimentation and other empirical techniques. He went to Germany, the center of scientific psychology, in 1886-1887 to study at the University of Berlin; after returning he was promoted to full professor and granted $100 to purchase a Hipp chronoscope for experimental studies of human reaction times. In January 1888 Bryan opened the Indiana University Psychological laboratory, the second such facility established in the United States.\n\nBryan married Charlotte Augusta Lowe in 1889 and in her honor replaced his given middle name with her last name. His wife was a graduate of Indiana University, having earned a bachelor's degree (1888) and a master's degree (1889) in Greek. They collaborated on two books, Plato the Teacher: Selections from Plato (1897) and Studies in Plato's Republic for Teachers (1898). They had no children.\n\nBryan carried a heavy teaching load, and at first the psychological laboratory was used mainly for classroom demonstrations rather than original research. In 1891 he went to Clark University to pursue a doctorate under G. Stanley Hall, a prominent advocate of the new psychology. Bryan received his Ph.D. in psychology in 1892 for a dissertation on the development of voluntary motor abilities in children. He was also recruited by Hall to help organize the American Psychological Association, founded in July 1892, and became one of its twenty-six charter members.\n\nAfter returning to Indiana University, Bryan expanded the psychological laboratory and was appointed vice president of the institution. He resisted repeated offers by Jordan, who had become president of Stanford University in 1891, to join the faculty of the California school. Bryan also became involved in the child-study movement, an effort to develop a scientific foundation for pedagogical techniques. He served as an officer in several national organizations, including the secretary of the h Association for the Study of Children (1893) and the president of the Child-Study Section of the National Educational Association (1894).\n\nIn the 1890s Bryan conducted pioneering psychological experiments. He investigated the process of learning to send and receive messages in Morse code on the telegraph. The research, published in the Psychological Review (1897, 1899), was among the first such studies to graphically represent its data in the form of \"learning curves\" and became a classic in the study of human learning. Because of Bryan's efforts, during this period Indiana University became an undergraduate training ground for notable future psychologists, including Edwin D. Starbuck, Ernest H. Lindley, and Lewis M. Terman.\n\nIn 1902 Bryan was appointed the tenth president of Indiana University. The next year he was elected president of the American Psychological Association and delivered his presidential address on the problem of \"Theory and Practice\" (repr., Psychological Review 11 [1904]: 71-82). His remark that \"the scholar may at great price become a statesman\" suggested his ambivalence about leaving the laboratory for administration.\n\nPious and scholarly, Bryan presided over the transformation of Indiana University from a small, traditional liberal arts college into a modern research university. He led the institution for thirty-five years and oversaw an era of enormous growth in student enrollments, physical facilities, and curricular offerings. He considered administration an exercise in practical psychology and viewed the university as a key institution for the transmission of cultural values as well as specialized knowledge. His most notable accomplishment was the expansion of graduate and professional training. During his administration, schools of medicine, education, nursing, business, music, and dentistry were established, along with many graduate programs and several satellite campuses around the state. By the time Bryan retired at the age of seventy-six, Indiana University had significantly broadened access to its programs and had dramatically increased the quality of graduate and professional education.\n\nBryan was known as a pithy orator, and his speeches were highly moralistic. His strong belief in the scientific study of human nature was tempered by an equally powerful conviction that it was not sufficient to provide moral and spiritual guidance. Hence he maintained an interest in ethics and metaphysics throughout his life. In 1940 Bryan published Wars of Families of Minds, a book that reflected on the consequences of different ways of knowing the world. A colleague once called him \"a philosopher tamed by science\"--a characterization that could have easily been applied to Bryan's intellectual hero, William James.\n\nAfter retirement Bryan continued to live on campus in the president's house, and he remained a familiar sight walking along its wooded paths. He died in Bloomington. The institution he developed commemorated his work with many memorials, including the William Lowe Bryan Hall, the main administration building at Indiana University, and his hometown also named in his honor Bryan Park, a large municipal park.\n\n* Bryan's papers are in the Indiana University Archives. On his university administration, see Thomas D. Clark, Indiana University: Midwestern Pioneer, vol. 2 (1973), and Burton Dorr Myers, History of Indiana University, 1902-1937, the Bryan Administration (1952). Bryan's career as a psychologist is described in Eliot Hearst and James H. Capshew, eds., Psychology at Indiana University: A Centennial Review and Compendium (1988), which also contains a comprehensive bibliography of his writings. Additional biographical material can be found in Manfred Wolfe Deputy, \"The Philosophical Ideas and Related Achievements of William Lowe Bryan\" (Ph.D. diss., Indiana Univ., 1947). Major obituaries are in the American Journal of Psychology 69 (1956): 325-27; Science 123 (1956): 214; and the New York Times, 22 Nov. 1955.\n\nThe administrative files of IU President William Lowe Bryan are divided into two large series: his presidential records for the period 1902-1913, and those records for the period from 1914 to the end of tenure in 1937. This finding aid describes the records in the earlier period. The records from 1914-1937 are contained in a separate collection, C286, and the finding aid for that collection can be found at http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/findingaids/archives/InU-Ar-VAA8687. Consult Archives staff for further information.\n\nThis collection is comprised almost entirely of incoming correspondence to various members of the Bryan administration. The files are arranged alphabetically, most often by the name of the individual writing the letter, but also by subject or by name of institution or department. The original order has been maintained with one major exception. Whenever there were two or more incoming letters to or from a correspondent, a separate file for that individual was created. Where there is only one letter to or from an individual, it is filed alphabetically under the first letter of the last name.\n\nRoughly 50% of the correspondence is addressed to IU President Bryan. The remaining half is addressed to other highly ranking IU administrators including Registrar John W. Cravens, Clerk to the Registrar John E. Edmondson, Dean of Women Louise Ann Goodbody, and University Secretary Ulysses Howe Smith. Correspondence in the collection falls into four primary categories: correspondence with and reports from IU administrators and faculty; correspondence with various businesses regarding finanacial transactions; correspondence with students and alumni; and correspondence with professional colleagues, such as other university presidents, faculty and administrators and high school principals, and with representatives of professional associations.\n\nThe correspondence with IU faculty and administrators is most often arranged under the name of the individual. Prominently featured are files for the deans of the various schools and chairs of the departments. Consequently in most cases if one is researching the history of a department or school, one would look for correspondence filed under the name of the department chair. There is one exception to this rule: annual reports for the schools and departments are listed under the name of that unit. Administrators prominently featured are John Cravens, Registrar and Secretary to the Board of Trustees; Carl Eigenmann, Dean of the Graduate School; Charles Emerson, Dean of the School of Medicine: Enoch Hogate, Dean of the School of Law; Pearl Holloway, Registrar f the School of Medicine; Charles Sembower, Editor of University Publications and Professor of English; and Ulysses Howe Smith, Bursar. Trustees prominently featured include James Fesler, Robert Hamilton, Theodore Rose, Joseph Shea and Benjamin F. Shively. Faculty prominently featured include Alfred Brooks, Professor of Fine Arts; Arthur Lee Foley, Professor of Physics; Ernest O. Holland, Professor of Education; Will D. Howe, Professor of English; William Evans Jenkins, Librarian; Albert F. Kuersteiner, Professor of Romance Languages; Robert E. Lyons, Professor of Chemisty; Wilfred H. Manwaring, Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology; Burton D. Myers, Professor of Anatomy; and Guido H. Stempel, Professor of Comparative Philology. Some of the prominent subjects included in the files include athletics, arbutus, commencement, committees, legislature, Rhodes Scholarships, schedule of classes and exams, speeches, statistics, Student Building subscriptions, Treasurer's reports, and Board of Trustees – Executive Committee.\n\nThe business correspondence consists primarily of bills, purchase orders and inquires as to the financial needs of the University. The companies are largely from the Bloomington and the surrounding area, and offer such every-day services as paper supplies, office cabinets, water and electricity services, and building construction. Some of the companies prominently featured in the files are Bausch and Lomb Optical Company, Bobs-Merrill Company, William B. Burford- Stationer, G. Cramer Dry Plate Company, Crane Company, Electric Appliance Company, Henry Heil Chemical Company, Knight and Jillson Company, Ernest Leitz Company, Montgomery Ward Company, Remington Typewriter Company, E.H Sargent and Company, Sears, Roebuck and Company, and George Welsby Scott, Consulting Engineer. Among the more prominent subject terms in this category are bids, coal, contracts, and notices.\n\nStudent and alumni correspondence consists largely of requests for diplomas, teaching certificates, transcripts, recommendations, and tickets to sporting or theatrical events. There are also some personal letters from students and alumni describing trips to Europe or their lives since graduation. This correspondence if filed either under the student's name (if there are 2 or more letters) or alphabetically under the first letter of their last name. There are many alumni letters filed under the subject category of \"Alumni Letters re: state of University.\"\n\nThe correspondence with professional colleagues and associations is almost entirely addressed to Bryan. Included in this category is correspondence from other university presidents relating to professional organizations or to general administrative issues. The majority of this correspondence is filed under the name of the individual. However, there is general correspondence to and from various universities filed under the name of the institution. Included in these files are correspondence from the University of Chicago, University of Cincinnati, Columbia University, DePauw University, Harvard University, University of Illinois, University of Kansas, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, Oberlin, Ohio State University, University of Pennsylvania, Purdue University, State College of Physicians and Surgeons, Wabash College, University of Wisconsin, and Yale University. There is also considerable amont of correspondence to and from professional organizations, such as the Association of American Universities, American Psychological Association, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and the Indianapolis News, Indiana State Teachers Association, National Association of State Universities, Religious Education Association, School and College Bureau, Y.M.C.A, and Y.W.C.A. Prominently featured in these files are correspondence from Fassett A. Cotton, Superintendent of Public Instruction for the State of Indiana, and C.N. Kendall, Superintendant of Indianapolis Public Schools."
