A. The Village of Gildersleeve, Middlesex County, Conn. Gildersleeve, ghildersleev, a post village of Middlesex Co., Conn., in Portland on the East bank of the Connecticut River, 2 miles above Middle' town. It has 2 churches, a noted shipyard, a steam saw mill, and manufac' tures cigars, flour, carriages, etc. Ice harvesting and tobacco packing are carried on here. Population about 1,500. (Lippincott’s Gaz;eteer of the World, 1893.) Gildersleeve, manufacturing village in the town of Portland, Middle' sex Co., Conn., population about 1,00U. (Proper Names, Funk 6? Wagnall’s Standard Dictionary, 1912.) Gildersleeve (altitude 60), town of Portland, is a beautiful shaded village at the top of a small hill near a bend in the Connecticut River. Residences border the main street and small farms fringe the outskirts. The village grew up around the Gildersleeve shipyard which ceased operations in 1930 after almost a century of existence. Starting in October, 1741 with a schooner of 90 tons, the yards swung into speedy production. At die top of a slight rise a fine view stretches to the west over acres of shade grown tobacco sloping down to the river bank. (Connecticut — W. P. A. Project, page 442, Federal Writers). Its history starts with the founding of Middletown in 1650. Grants of land in 1652 on the east side of the river were recorded and a highway in 1659. For protection of the Wangunk Indians, a reservation was set up in 1673, extending from the river at the foot of Indian Hill Avenue and east' erly along the northern slope of high land with Wangunk Meadows to the north. After 1752 scattered tracts only were left to the Indians. East Middletown became the town of Chatham in 1767. In 1841, Portland broke away from Chatham which in 1915 changed its name to East Hampton. In 1879, School District No. 1 of Portland which included Gildersleeve was bounded westerly by the river. Its southern limits began at the river near Coe’s Avenue and ran up the hill near Church Street including most of Crow Hill and along the old Pest House path to Somerset Place, corner of William Street and then to Gospel Road, corner of William Street. From there a line was drawn northerly in Gouty Swamp and up the hill, including Center Cemetery and Center Congregational Church with two houses on Strickland Street. The northerly line then continued through Wangunk Meadows to the stream flowing from the Portland Reservoir and then west' erly along the stream or drain to the river above the then northern tip of Gildersleeve Island. The Congregational Church, soldiers monument, old Gildersleeve High School, Indian Hill, the site of the old shipyard, postoffice and store, the tobacco packing house, shade grown tobacco in season and small factories are objects of interest. Its present name is derived from the Gildersleeve family who came as refugees of 1776 from Long Island, N. Y., who continued their shipbuilding business until 1933. 1 Sylvester Gildersleeve’s Descendants The Ancient Gyldensleve Family of Old England The ancient family of Gyldensleve or Gildersleeve arose in County Norfolk, England. It was recorded in East Anglia for seven hundred years. East Anglia took in two counties, Norfolk and Suffolk. It was peopled by Angles from whom England got its name. These Teutonic folk swarmed over from the lowlands and coasts, northeast of the River Rhine and couth of Denmark, during the Fifth and Sixth centuries. The East Angles sailed directly across the North Sea to the nearest land, the most eastern part of Britain where they drove the Britons inland. These Angles were known as North Folk and South Folk. Counties Norfolk and Suffolk are named for them. The Middle Angles extended their conquests north of them in Britain. In the Eighth century, from Sweden, Norway and Denmark, the vik- ings came, first as raiders and pirates, and finally, a Danish kingdom was set up. Some parts of East Anglia were never conquered by the Danes, al¬ though in 870 A.D., the kingdom of East Anglia was a part of Danelaw. In the Tenth century, the English gradually won back control — the Danish folk were not disturbed. However, a Danish army landed in 1017 A.D. Canute, the Dane, became king of England. In 1042 A.D., the old Anglian or English line of kings succeeded the Danish line; Old English or Anglo-Saxon language and customs still prevailed. The Normans came over in 1066 A.D. and brought in a decided French influence, although fellow countrymen of the Danes, for they had lived in Normandy long enough to adopt new customs and language. The Middle English period, 1100-1500 A.D., showed strong development of cus¬ toms, laws, literature and consolidation of the English people into one nation. The Gyldensleve or Gildersleeve family is of East Anglian stock, prob¬ ably tempered by Danish blood in the Eighth century. Adoption of a family name seemingly came about in the Twelfth century to avoid confusion. Family names did not generally become hereditary, that is, passed on from father to son until the Thirteenth century, 1200-1300 A.D. Some of the Gyldensleve men were landholders while others were priests or tradesmen. Confined to County Norfolk at first, they lived in a flat low country, mostly reached by tidewater of the sea. At an early period, Norfolk had important cloth trades especially in Norwich. It had also a great number of monasteries — one being at Atleburgh where John Gilden- sleve, a priest, was a fellow of the college in 1421 A.D. Gyldensleve of Norfolk, England • The first recorded member of the family is Roger Gyldenesleve in the Hundred Rolls of 1273 A.D. These rolls or lists of substantial men of the hundreds, divisions of the county, were made after the long rule of King Henry III, 1216-1272, for the new king, Edward I. Members of this ancient Norfolk family are in Bardsley’s Dictionary of English Surnames: — Gildersleve, Gildersleeve, Gilderslieve, meaning “with sleeves braided with gold”. (Authority, “Writs of Parliament11, “Rotuli Litterarum Clan- sarum in Turri Londinensi11) M.E. gilden A.S. gyldan, to gild. Gilder is a corrupton of Gilden as these instances below will show. It is curious that 7 Sylvester Glldersleeve’s Descendants the name should still survive. The surname arose in Co. Norfolk. Roger Gyldenesleve, 100 Rolls, Co. Norfolk, 1273.

Gildersleeves in County Suffolk The period comprising the reigns of King Henry VII and King Henry VIII, from 1485 to 1553, with the early part of the 16th century had many fundamental changes in addition to the Reformation in religion then in progress. The country districts underwent a complete change where the Gyldensleve or Gildersleve families lived. King Henry VIII had spent the treasure carefully gathered by his father, Henry VII, SO' that by 1523, he needed money badly for his wars on the continent of Europe. He called on Parliament for funds. It was raised by taxes, subsidies collected from the people. Previous to this time, Gildersleeve families had been recorded only in Norfolk but in 1524, many families appeared in County Suffolk.

England unlike other European countries had been chiefly a country of small yeoman farmers. Whether he was a tenant or freeholder, his acres were few, scattered around in the open fields of the village. Inclosures for sheep raising came in the 15th century (1400-1500). The Close Rolls of King Henry VI in 1437 lists Robert Gyldensleve of County Norfolk. None of the names were listed for the Close Rolls of Edward IV from 1461 to 1466. This inclosure of farms drove out and hurt small independent farm¬ ing. Revolts and uprisings came in 1549 — put down by military force and thousands of people killed. Improved grain farming came in near the end of the 16th century (1550-1600) and inclosures of big amounts of land went out of fashion as the increase of manufacturing and trade took in more country workmen. In the 16th century, 1500-1599, Gildersleeve families appeared to settle in a narrow strip of County Suffolk running through the central part from the County Norfolk lines to County Essex. County Suf¬ folk is bounded mostly by the North Sea and many rivers. It is one of the most fertile counties and very dry in climate, essentially a farming country although Ipswich, Bury St. Edmunds, Lowestoff, Sudbury and other towns are industrial. Its greatest length is 50 miles and greatest breadth, 55 miles, bounded mostly by Norfolk, west by Cambridge, east by the North Sea, and south by Essex. It is to be noted that Gyldensleve — Gildersleeve families did not go away from that east central strip of County Suffolk. This strip followed a line drawn from Atleburgh in Norfolk to Shotley, southeast of Ipswich, to the River Stour that separated Suffolk from County Essex. These families lived on lands or in villages watered by the River Orwell, Deben, and Stour; some near the River Aide, particularly at Aldeburgh in 1585. Near the County Norfolk line in Hartismere Hundred was the village of Thorndon. One family of Gildersleeves lived there. Parish Register of Thorndon, Suffolk. (Mss. of Col. E. S. Banks) notes: — Thomas Gildersleeve married Julian Clodde, 22 Oct. 1559. Nicholas Gildersleeve married Martha Flatte, 10 Dec. 1587. Richard Gildersleeve married Anna Swayne, 17 Oct. 1591.

The seclusion of an English village then as Cheyney, the historian, aptly terms it — “was like having an impassable wall surrounding it. Few of the vil¬ lagers were daring enough to leave their birthplace; and a trip to London would be the subject of the talk of a lifetime.” “Counties were then more widely separated than foreign countries now.” (1900) Between 1500 and 1640, there were more than sixty villages in Suffolk having Gildersleeves recorded — all packed into an area, 30 miles wide and 50 miles long. Thus it was a flourishing family and many were the ways of spelling the name. Careless recording, difficulties in copying, and personal whims show diverse spellings. On a muster roll, 1534-1540, was listed W. Gyldersleve, able archer, Aldham, Suffolk. (Suffolk Institute of Archaeology 6? Natural His¬ tory, 16:218) England was famous for the longbow, the most dreaded weapon of war then wielded by an able archer.

In the history of the Gildersleeve Family, published in the Suffolk Green Books (No. 16 (2), p. 308, etc.), it is stated that Mr. Bardsley gives some instances of the name in Norfolk from 1273-1588 and he says there 5 Sylvester Gildersleeve’s Descendants are several now in New York directory. In Suffolk, it was shown that the family has been in continuous existence from 1500 to the present moment. In 1524, it is found in Suffolk at Blakenham, Elmsett, Grundisburghe, Mick' field, Stoke by Nayland, Thornham Magna, Wetheringsett. In 1568, at Bricett, Brundish, Newton in Stow, Grundisburghe, Wetheringsett. In 1674, at Bramford, Bucklesham, Crowfield, Falkenham, Framsden, Hasketon, Ip' swich, Monk Sohan, Occolt. These are confined to East Suffolk. Towards the end of the 17th century, a branch of the Gildersleeve family found its way to Erwarton and Shotley. The Gildersleeves stayed in Shotley and will be found in the registers from 1750 till after 1850 living close to the church. In January 1859 was buried Mary Gildersleeve aged 99 years. A member of the former Shotley family will be f,pnd in Bury St. Edmunds in Mr. Gildersleeve, organ builder (Robert 4th). In the London d:rectoryl887, Joseph Gildersleeve, organ pipemaker (this was Robert’s brother) and John Gildersleeve saddlers embroiderer. Some of this former Shotley family were contacted in 1930. Francis Stanton Gildersleeve, born in Hastings, Sussex, England, 20 Dec. 1880, is an architect in Vancouver, British Columbia, who has a son Wilfred, avi' ator in the Canadian Air Corps, and wrote that his father, Francis Gilder' sleeve of Hastings, Sussex, owner of a private hotel and catering business, could explain about the Gildersleeve coat'of'arms and family crest, that he was using on his letter heads and envelopes. (Motto — “Justus esto ct metue”). He, in turn, generously gave all his family records and permis' sion to any one of the name in the United States to use the coat'oTarms as it had not been copyrighted there. His father, Robert, was born in 1814 at Stutton, Suffolk, dying at the age of 93 in Bexhill, Sussex, and had seven sons. He was the son of Robert born in 1778 in Shotley, Suffolk, son of Robert. Of the seven sons, the second was Joseph, organ builder, and voicer who died in 1925 aged 84 in London. The fourth son, Robert 4th, died 23 July 1925, aged 78, in Bury St. Edmunds. He had a famous music shop there having been an organ builder himself. He voiced the organ of the Hereford Cathedral, tuned the organs of St. Paul’s Cathedral, Albert Hail and Alexandra Palace — “a noted character’’. The fifth son was John Robert Gildersleeve born in Stutton, Suffolk, 2 Feb. 1851, and was an actor and manager of Miner’s Bowery Theater and Eighth Avenue The' ater, New York City, from 1879 to 1897. Francis Gildersleeve, the seventh son, born 22 Feb. 1855, in Stutton, Suffolk, started his catering and private hotel in 1880, “Gildersleeves” at Hastings, Sussex, whose second son William born 18 Dec. 1882, in Hast' tings, succeeded his father in catering in “The Metropole”, Hastings, Sussex. In 1900, Mr. Gildersleeve obtained at an annual fee of £5, permission to use his coat'of'arms and family crest from the Royal College of Heralds :’n his business. The author tried to find out if it was on record by paying the demanded search fee of a guinea to the proper official, the Blue Mantle Pursuivant of the Royal College of Heralds. He in turn replied that there was no record but that he would for other fees search for the pedigree of 6 Sylvester Gddersleeve’s Descendants Richard Gildersleeve, the pioneer. Needless to say, the matter was dropped. In colonial days, it was notorious for the fact that in Boston, Mass., coats- of-arms were peddled on the streets. (Cosmopolitan Magazine for Mar., 1940). Quote from New Yorker, Dec. 14, 1940, page 21 — English College of Heraldry exists on a sort of royalty-payment system — arms on silver¬ ware costs you <£5 a year. On the southeast coast of Suffolk, the River Aide empties into the North Sea and there in 1585, several families resided. William Gildersleeve was the “wrighter hereof'1 of the will of George Fiske, cooper, of Alde- burghe, 25 Jan. 1584/5, probated in Ipswich, County Suffolk. (N. E. Hist. & Gen. Register, 86:246).

(See Gib dersleeve Pioneers, 1941). — Gilders’eeves of New England — In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, 1558-1603, over England, there were a goodly number of people who desired a “purer form of religion” than the Church of England — they were called Puritans. They were greatly influenced by the Swiss, Dutch, and French reformers of the time. King James I, 1603-1625, because the Puritans wished to stay within the church, was petitioned for further changes In 1604, the king said: — “If this ail that they have to say, I shall make them conform themselves or I will harry them out of the land or else the worse.” So, if Puritans refused to attend church or held services of their own, they were fined and put in jail. Their leaders later were tortured or executed. Puritans then became involved in 7 Sylvester Gildersleeve’s Descendants politics and supported Parliament against the king. Charles I, 162 5' 1649, was forced to yield in 1628, to the Petition of Right passed by Parliament. Enforced quartering of soldiers in people’s homes, trial by martial law, loans or taxes not imposed by Parliament, and imprisonment without specific charges were illegal and were not to be practiced in the future. The name Puritan was applied loosely whether Low Churchmen, Pres\" byterians or Independents advocating a godly life and opposing popular pastimes especially on Sunday. Charles I dissolved Parliament in 1629 as he determined to rule himself. Many Puritans started to leave England as had the Pilgrims in 1620 in the “Mayflower” and later, to Plymouth, Mass. Many Suffolk families were Puritans. Among them was Richard Gilder\" sleeve and his family who first were recorded in Wethersfield, Connecticut Colony, in New England. 1. — Richard Gildersleeve, Puritan. — his biography is in “Gildersleeve Pioneers”, p. 16\" 132, published 1941 — born in County Suffolk, England, in 1601, died in Hempstead, Long Island, N. Y., in 1681; his wife not re\" corded. Children: — born in County Suffolk, England. 2. — Elisabeth, b.xl624, d.1664, m. Capt. William Lawrence. 3. — Richard, b.xl626, d.1691, m. Dorcas Williams. 4. — Anna, b.xl629, d. 168\", m. John Smith Nan. 5. — Samuel, b.xl631. He came to America in the wave of Puritan emigrants, 1630\" 1640, to New England by way of Watertown, Mass, He was a first settler of Con\" necticut in 1635, a surveyor in Wethersfield, having lands also in Glaston\" bury across the Connecticut River on Frog Brook. His home was on High Street near the fort in Wethersfield. In 1639, he was an original signer of the New Haven Colony and was a first settler of Stamford, Conn., in 1641. Elected in 1643 as a deputy to New Haven Court, he helped organise the New England Confederation or United Colonies, the germ of the future United States. In 1644, he became one of the 50 original proprietors of Hempstead, on Long Island, N. Y., under Dutch rule. He was a magistrate, 1647' 1664 and also of Newtown, 1652\" 1656, which he surveyed by the orders of Gov. Stuyveseant. He was a delegate in 1653 to the United Colonies at Boston with the Hempstead propositions signed by him. He was sergeant of militia in 1656 and led the revolt against the Dutch in 1663. Previously under Dutch orders, he carried out the first persecution of the Quakers in 1657. He was appointed commissioner in 1664 by Connecticut Colony but the Duke’s Laws of New York changed conditions for Hempstead where he was a patentee in 1667. He was elected constable in 1668 and also town attorney 1665\" 1677, in defense of town rights against the royal governors. Events in his career show the continued struggle for liberty carried forward from England which was laying the groundwork in the colonies that led up to the American Revolution only a century later. These events are his public stand in a lawsuit in 1639 for individual rights in Connecticut Colony, his part in forming the United Colonies in 1643 with New Haven 8 Sylvester Gildersleeve’s Descendants Colony, his active part in the Hempstead Propositions of 1653 at Boston before the New England Confederation, his share in the Indian treaty of 1657 for Hempstead lands, his leadership in revolt against the Dutch and in exposing the conspiracy to take over Long Island as recorded at Hart\" ford in 1664 where he was appointed commissioner. Under the Duke’s Laws, he started the organised agitation against them at Jamaica in 1669 and led in the Hempstead Petition (later in 1669.) Its declaration of “No taxation without representation” was the first recorded in the English colonies after the one in Watertown, Mass., in 1636, noted by John Fiske, the historian. As town attorney, he led the fight for selLgovernment, for representa\" ticn, and for the defense of “rights of an Englishman” against the “Patents within patents”, by constantly appearing in the lawsuits and hearings be\" fore the Governor and Council and various courts of New York. New York was termed by an eminent historian*, “the worst governed province in America.” He and his son Richard 2d were also kept busy surveying land grants due to the “patents within patents” inflicted by royal governors. Almost 50 citations from Oyster Bay town records testify to the active career of “Mr.” Gildersleeve although he owned no lands in that town or ever lived there. It is an impressive fact how much of the records of New York are devoted to the affairs of the Long Island town of Hempstead under con' stant persecution of its governors. Documentary evidence shows how strong were the foundations of self'government laid by the early English colonists that educated the people. So, that later at the proper time the Bill of Rights was added to the U. S. Constitution. 3. — Richard Gildersleeve 2d. His biography is in “Gildersleeve Pio\" neers” 1941, p. 1 3 3'1 83 . Born in County Suffolk, England, in 1626; died in Hempstead, L. I., N. Y., in 1691; married in 1654, Dorcas Williams, born 1634, died in 1704 in Hempstead, daughter of Miles who died in 1644 and Ann.

Mary - - . 8. — Elizabeth, b. 1663. 9. — Dorcas, b. 1665, d. - , m. Thomas Lester. Richard 2d was an able son of an able father. He was closely con' nected with him as the people’s champion in the continued battle against the spoliation and exploitation by royal governors that blighted the growth of New York. The most peculiar fact was “the patents within patents” * — overlapping grants of land without regard to what had been granted before. No wonder he was kept busy as a surveyor. New York was a weak fourth among the states after the Revolution notwithstanding advantages of posi\" tion and resources for settlers — it had 33 governors, 1665\" 1775, while Pennsylvania had 25, and Massachusetts 21. *Chas. M. Andrews, author — Colonial Period of Am. Hist., 3 vols., 1.939, wrote a special article extolling Richard Gildersleeve in the New Eng¬ land Magazine, February, 1893 — “A Biographical By-Path through early New England History”. 9 Sylvester Glldersleeve’s Descendants He was one of 56 men who bought the lands of Newtown on Long Island in 1656 from the Indians. He was chief court witness for Newtown in its lawsuit with Bushwick later. He became proprietor of Hempstead :n 1658 after selling out to his “brother” William Lawrence (Newtown Rec. 1:1 and 156) and William Bloomfield. In Hempstead, he was rate collector, town clerk, constable, surveyor and tax collector. In 1664, he was signer of the Hempstead petition to Connecticut Colony and leader in the revolt against the Dutch. He was a signer of the Hempstead Petition of 1669 after being a freeman of Connecticut Colony with his father. However the Duke’s Laws took over and he was deprived of representation and taxed. In 1678 as constable, he incurred the wrath of the Quakers who protested about him to the New York governor as he enforced the tax laws tor church support. He was a Presbyterian. His younger son Thomas has his biography in “Gildersleeve Pioneers” 1941, p. 206. He was founder of the younger line of the family in America and British Columbia. He had five sons: — Asa, George, Thomas, Richard, and Elisha of Hempstead. He held many town offices and with his son George was a charter member of St. George’s Episcopal Church. His daughter Dorcas married (1) Isaiah Rogers of Northport; having a large family, and (2) in 1751, Thomas Hendrickson. Her will was proved at Riverhead, Suffolk County, N. Y., in 1789.

His first home was on the east side of Meadow' brook in West Merrick, Hempstead, which he and Experience sold :n 1687 to the Rock Smiths. In Northport, he bought a farm at Crab Meadow with its north bounds, a sandy beach on Long Island Sound in the town of Huntington, managed by his son Thomas and later by his grandson .Ben' jamin Gildersleeve. He and a partner bought Little Neck in Babylon from the Secatogue Indians and also a farm in Smithtown west side of Nissa' quoge River.

After a drive of six or seven miles to the town spot in Huntington village, h;s family attended church. There, Rev. Ebenezer Prime, Presbyterian, baptized four and married seven of his children. Thomas Gildersleeve witnessed for Henry Scudder, 10 Nov. 1733, his quit¬ claim for Queens Village to Henry Lloyd, Huntington, L. I. (N. Y. Hist. Collect. 1926). He served two terms as town trustee in 1739 and 1740. (Hunt^n JTown Rec.). His landholdings between Northport and Long Island Awere often recorded. He fought 38 acres, 26 July 1717, at Crab Meadow, from Thomas Skidmore. Ten acres were between the house of Skidmore and Jonas Smith bounded by a highway around as the fence stood while 28 acres were \"boggy meadow bounded in part by land in Common but on the east by Alexander Eryant and on the Sound by the said Thomas Gildersleeve and part by land in Common.

Obadiah Sr. was reared on his father’s farm on the cliffs of Crab Meadow Neck with its beach cn Long Island Sound east of Eaton’s Neck and Northport Harbor. Sloops and schooners in coastwise shipping and other trade engaged his attention so that he became a shipbuilder. He was a Presbyterian, being baptised and married by Rev. Ebenezer Prime, Hunt' ington, Suffolk County, L. I., who also baptized his wife and six children. On Northport Bay, there was a shipyard to work in when not farming. He was taxed for a small farm.

Obadiah and his family moved to the east end of Long Island into the town of Southampton at Bridgehampton village. At Sag Harbor nearby, 15 Sylvester Gildersleeve’s Descendants shipbuilding prospered. Whaling was important. In 1761, a new wharf and try house were built for trying out the whales. There the blubber was tried out into oil mainly used for lighting people’s homes. John Foster, the largest shipowner, often made trips to Europe. Here, at Sag Harbor, Obadiah, ship' carpenter was “boss” on contracts, while his two sons, Henry and Philip, learned shipbuilding. At that time, the people were all stirred up by acts of England towards her American Colonies. The town of Southampton voted to have John Foster of Sag Harbor secure a vessel and sail to different ports and collect donations for tne relief of the starving in Boston, Mass., which port had been closed by Act of the English Parliament — the Boston Port Bill. A circular had been sent out asking relief. In Southampton, a com¬ mittee of safety was appointed in 1774 and also a sub-committee :n Sag Harbor, according to the directions of the New York Convention. These requested 2 Apr. 1775, ammunition and warlike stores. Companies of minute men were raised in the villages. Obadiah Gildersleeve signed the Associa¬ tion in May 1775 from Suffolk County, to withstand all oppressive acts by England. (Calendar N. Y. Hist. Mss. Rev. Papers). His two oldest sons enlisted in the 3d N. Y. Regt. of the line, Capt. Hurlburt’s company, which remained to guard 2,000 cattle and 3,000 sheep at Montauk from the rav¬ ages of the enemy, 31 July 1775. (Onderdonk’s Suffolk). Thirteen sail of British shipping, 7 Aug. 1775, were off Oyster Ponds or Orient Point, Long Island. The British were under Col. Abijah Willard, a loyalist from Massa¬ chusetts, and raided Gardiner’s Island, taking away 50 cattle and 2,000 sheep. Obadiah’s two sons were ordered in August 1776 to march with Capt. Peirson’s Minute Company to the opposite end of Lang Island to meet the British invasion around Brooklyn, N. Y. The disastrous result of the Battle of Long Island, 29 Aug. 1776, created a panic in the town as in all parts of Suffolk County. Exaggerated rumors of the rapacity and greed of the British troops especially of the Hessian soldiers hired from Germany spread far and wide. Proclamations of the victorious British officers, showed that the lives and property of those connected with the American cause were :n serious danger. Prominent men and especially those conspicuous in ihe Revolutionary acts connected with the American cause were in peril. They deemed it prudent to remove their families and personal effects to Connec¬ ticut. Obadiah with many other Refugees of 1776 procured passes from the committee of safety to leave town, 1 Sept. 1776. (F. G. Mather, Refugees of 1776, from Long Island). Census of 1776, Southampton East — Obadiah Gildersleeve, males, none above 50 yrs. of age; 3 above 16; 2 under 16; fe¬ males, 3 above 16; 1 under 16; no negroes. (Southampton Town Records 3:392). They and their effects were soon moved to the wharf at Sag Har¬ bor and there taken on board a waiting vessel under Capt. Zebulon Cooper, the next day. Capt. James Wiggins, in his sloop, carried some of the family goods to Moodus, Conn. The family of eight children crossed Long Island Sound to Saybrook, Conn., in safety and there embarked on Capt. Daniel Hale’s vessel and 16 Sylvester Gildersleeve’s Descendants sailed up Connecticut River to Middletown. Across the river to the east was the little but important shipbuilding town of Chatham — in the north' ern part of which there were two and later five shipyards. For a long time the towns along the river carried on a brisk trade with the West Indies, employing a fleet of sailing vessels. The village of Chatham, now called Gib dersleeve, was the most active part of the town with its shipyards and town hall. The town of Chatham was a part of Middletown until 1767 as East Middletown society. During the Revolution there was built here, the United States warship, “Trumbull” of 700 tons and 36 guns. The “Bourbon”, 900 tons and 46 guns was not armed because of the declaration of peace. The Navy Yard was north of the end of Shipyard Lane, now Indian Hill Ave' nue, near Stevenson Wharf, built in 1767. (Chatham Town Rec.) North of Parsonchauge meadow but south of Wangunk meadows, was Shipyard Lane. On it, Obadiah Gildersleeve and family made their home in a house torn down in 1901, located on what was later the Gildersleeve Shipyard frontage. Besides the personal effects, brought “from old Long Island’s sea-girt shore”, by Capt. Wiggins, Capt. Robert Knight brought up the river the other goods left in Moodus by Capt. Cooper’s sloop while Capt. Starr Greenfield brought the rest from Long Island. Obadiah worked several years in the local shipyards as “boss” carpenter being in New Haven, Conn., from November 1776 to October 1778 as noted in Onder' donk’s “Suffolk County”. His wife dying in 1798, he bought a small farm in South Glastonbury on high land across the Wangunk Meadows several miles north on the main road. (A few houses north of the g.'g. 'grandson W. H. H. Miller). Here he lived until his death in 1816 aged 88 with his oldest daughter Esther, a spinster, a woman of property, lending money to many relatives for busi' ness. “She was so stout that she had no lap when sitting down”. Her estate was equally divided among her heirs in 1827. (Chatham Probate). “14 Oct. 1799. Hiel Hollister of Glastonbury, Conn., for £112 money received from Obadiah Guildersleeves of Chatham do sell land and build' ings in Glastonbury — one acre 28 rods bounded by heirs of Sam Bill Jr., by Oliver Talcott, by Roger Hale and by the county road, except a small barn of Bill. Wit.: Ephraim Strong, Josiah Hale, justice.” “7 Jan. 1800. Abijah Miller of Glastonbury, for $80 reed, of Obadiah Guildersleve of Glastenbury released 6 acres in Glastenbury bounded by highway, by John Miller, Josiah Hale and Elijah Miller. Wit.: Jonah Chap' man, Josiah Hale, justice.” “18 Jan. 1802, Esther Guildersleeve of Glastenbury for $400 reed, from my honored father Obadiah Guildersleeve of Glastenbury do devise unto my said father lands in Glastenbury with buildings, one acre 28 rods, as in deed of 14 Oct. 1799. Wit.: Josiah Hale, justice; Anna Hale.” Thus, Obadiah in the 5th generation returns to the town that Richard the Puritan had land — 225 acres on Frog Brook besides a 40'acre lot in 1640. Esther gave up the home after her father's death to live with her sister, Mrs. Mary Russell, in Portland, Conn. Obadiah, his wife Mary, and son Richard were buried in the old Portland Quarry cemetery. When the 17 Sylvester Gildersleeve’s Descendants quarries took over the lots, their remains were moved east to the cemetery one mile east of Gildersleeve postoffice. The following facts show the unique state of affairs on Long Island in the Revolutionary War. F. G. Mather’s masterly volume, “The Refugees of 1776 from Long Island — ’’ 1913, contain much data from original sources, p. 142. Acting on the suggestion of the Continental Congress, the inhabit tants of the City of New York on Apr. 29, 1775, adopted a Form of Asso¬ ciation pledging support to the Continental Congress and to the Provincial Congress. This form was sent to all the Counties in the Province of New York. In Suffolk County, the great majority of the people signed the Asso¬ ciation — only 236 in the whole county refused to sign. As soon as the British had secured possession of Long Island in September 1776, Gov. Tryon recommended that all these unlawful associations be dissolved. The Associators had to choose between a miserable existence at home, or flight across the Sound to Connecticut. Thousands fled. p. 1054. Obadiah and Philip Gildersleeve signed the Association :n Suffolk County, N. Y., May 1775. p. 166. — Sag Harbor was the natural place for debarkation of all Refugees from the Hamptons. Onderdonk in his “Suffolk County, p. 48” stated “Septr. 15th (1776) Wharves at Sag Harbor crowded with emigrants.” Two days after the Battle of Long Island, the convention recommended to the inhabitants of Long Island, “to remove as many of the women, chil¬ dren, and slaves, and as much of their livestock and grain, to the main, as they can and that this convention will pay the expense of removing the same.” (Journal of N. Y. Provincial Congress 1775, 1776, 1777). p. 172. Messrs. Obadiah Jones, Col. John Hulbert and Thomas Dering were located at Middletown, Conn., in 1777 as agents of New York State for the Refugees from Long Island, p. 739 — Accounts of the Auditors and claims of the Refugees against the State of New York.

(Not recorded until 1781 as commissioned) — “Maritime, Conn., in Rev. War” by Middlebrook) . As one of the crew of 16 men, he shared in the prize money from captured British ships cruising along the Long Island Sound and out¬ side.

Y. and became proficient in two trades, shipbuilding and fulling cloth. Fullers im' proved the texture of cloth after it had been woven, by beating and washing it with fuller’s earth, a clay which absorbs the grease from the wool — the cloth loses length and breadth but gains in body and thickness. About 1772, he moved from Northport to Bridgehampton in the came county but on the east end of Long Island in the town of Southampton. Sag Harbor had then become a whaling port and shipbuilding made the port teem with activity. Many sheep were raised nearby and wool instead of linen formed the basis of most of the people’s clothes. The people of Southampton with the rest of the Suffolk County towns were greatly stirred up in 1774 by the Acts of the English Parliament. As a result of the Boston Port Bill by which England shut up this port for commerce, Boston people were in great distress and want. The American colonies finally united to withstand all oppressive acts. The committees of correspondence of Suffolk County met at Riverhead, 15 Nov. 1774, and voted to have John Foster of Sag Harbor secure a vessel and get supplies for the relief of Boston. In 1775, committees of safety were appointed ac' 20 Sylvester Gildersleeve’s Descendants cording to the directions of the convention, elected in the province of New York. They requested ammunition and stores from the Provincial Congress, 2 Apr. 1775. Companies of minute men were raised in the village and drilled on the green. A company of “Liberty Boys” under command of Capt. John Hurlburt was raised at Bridgehampton to join Gen. Philip Schuyler’s Army. Tradition states this notice to raise the company was received by Capt. Hurlburt on Sunday afternoon. Taking his stand at the church door after services, he stated his authority and called in stirring words for volunteers and before night the ranks were full. Philip, just 18 years old, enlisted as a private, 5 July 1775, in Capt. Hurlburt’s company raised for Schuyler’s Army, 3d. New York Regiment of the line, commanded by Col. James Clinton, (p. 1015, Refugees of 1776 from L. I.) A petition from Southampton and East hampton resulted in per- mission from Congress for this company to remain to guard the stock at Montauk — 2,000 cattle and 3,000 sheep, from the ravages of the enemy, 31 July 1775. (Onderdonk’s Suffolk) Thirteen sail of British shipping were seen, Aug. 7, 1775, off Oyster Ponds, Orient, Long Island, looking for stock, as it was supposed. The British had taken 50 cattle and 2,000 sheep in a raid on Gardiner’s Island, 7 Sept. 1775. Capt. Hurlburt marched his men from Montauk but had borrowed guns. Capt. David Peirson’s company was complete in arms, 30 May 1776. (Onderdonk’s Suffolk) Philip signed the Association in May 1775, an agreement of the Amerh can colonies to withstand all appressive acts by England, (p. 1054, Refugees of 1776 from L. I.) The minute men were the first soldiers who were ready at a minute’s notice to answer to a call for war meanwhile pursuing their daily work. Their service was short and irregular. Philip left the service 15 Jan. 1776. “A Return of Capt. David Peirson’s Minute Company in Suffolk County in the Regiment whereof Josiah Smith is Colonel’’ dated Bridge' hampton, 1 Apr. 1776. Philip was entered as “corporal possessing 1 gun, 1 bayonet, 1 car. box, 19 cartridges, 5 flints, 1 knapsac, 1 brass, 1 wire”. As corporal of the Liberty Boys, he was present Mar. 18, Apr. 22, May 20, and May 29, 1776 at muster, (p. 995, Refugees of 1776 from L. I.) (N. Y. in Rev. p. 169' 172). The diary of Col. Josiah Smith recounts their doings. In a letter, 20 July 1776, Nathl. Woodhull, Pres, of Prov. Congress, in' formed Col. Smith that Congress resolved to embody oneTourth of the militia on Long Island for defense and appointed him to command. Orders were received, 23 July 1776, to muster his troops from the east end of Long Island and march at once to join Gen. Greene’s command at Brooklyn. Col. Smith visited Huntington to have Maj. Jeffrey Smith muster Capt. John Wicke’s company and set out with Col. Sands and Maj. Rcmsen to Queens County to inspect the guards at Cow Neck (Manhasset) and Great Neck. Returning to Sag Harbor, he came back to Southampton where he received orders. He marched his men, 12 Aug. 1776, to Huntington. Capt. David Peirson’s company had John Foster, lieut., Abraham Rose, 2d. lieut., Edward Topping, ensign; Samuel White, David Woodruff, Syh vanus Wick, David Lupton, sergeants; Isaac Peirson, Matthew Jagger, 21 Sylvester Gildersleeve’s Descendants Philip Gildersleeve, Joshua Hildreth, Antony Sherman, corporals; Hugh Gelston, clerk; Wm. Gelston, fifer; James Foster, drummer. There were seventy privates, among them, Philip’s older brother Henry. They set out from Huntington, 13 Aug. 1776, and reached Lt. Increase Carpenter’s inn and the next day were at Brooklyn ferry, Gen. Greene’s quarters; and camped at Rem Cowenhoven’s. Gen. Greene had made a line of fortifica' tions extending from Wallabout Bay (where the Navy Yard is) to Gowanus Creek. They encamped for six days in a welter of confusion; for, they were raw country militia never tried in battle and not used to order or discipline. The British came over from Staten Island, 22 Aug. 1776, and landed at New Utrecht while the Americans retreated. Col. Smith took his regri ment out to Flatbush and came very near the British, being out all night, with his advance guard killing several of the enemy. They spent the next day in the woods where an incessant fire of musketry was kept up all day. Their marksmen killed many while they lost only one and four wounded. They camped Aug. 24 when their sentries wounded several of the British and had seven of their own wounded. The next day while on duty in the woods all night on guard against attack, a dreadful thunderstorm came Up. They were released from sentry duty in the afternoon and returned to the fortifications near Wallabout Bay. At 2 A. M., Aug. 27, Col. Smith’s men were aroused from their sleep by the enemy’s attack but they repulsed them and lay in the trenches all night. The Hessian troops, hired by the British from Germany, were harassed exceedingly, since they were not trained to fighting in the woods where the Americans skulked behind trees and picked off the officers and men, massed in formations. Their skirmishes made it needful for the British to change their plans for battle so these Hessians were marched on to Flatlands, leaving the best part of the American army on Brooklyn Heights to be surrounded and defeated in the Battle of Long Island. Col. Smith’s regiment having laid in the trenches all night in Brooklyn had to lay there the next day and night also, Aug. 28, in the heavy rain, a continued exchange of shooting with the British being kept up. They still lay behind their breastworks, Aug. 29, until the afternoon when orders were received to march over to New York. The battle had been lost with ter' rible slaughter of the American troops under Gen. Sullivan on Brooklyn Heights with many captured. About 2 A. M., Aug. 30, Col. Smith’s regiment was roused. Gen. Washington had already decided to abandon Long Island to the British. Under cover of darkness and a heavy fog, they slipped away over to New York City on Manhattan Island. They marched over the Harlem River at Kingsbridge to Westchester. The next day, Col. Smith’s men marched to New Rochelle and tried to get passage home by water to Long Island. They finally embarked, Sept. 1 on vessels at Mamaroneck and landed at Capt. Platt’s at Smithtown, getting home to Bridgehampton the day after, Sept. 2. The regiment disbanded, the colonel giving orders for every man to shift for himself in getting their families and effects off Long Island. From that Sylvester Gildersleeve’s Descendants time to the end of the war, Long Island was fully occupied by the British army for six years. Philip and his brother Henry quickly left Sag Harbor to follow the family whose effects were being carried away on four different vessels, go great was the hurry to escape the British Army. Safely escaping to Saybrook across the Sound, they sailed up the Connecticut river to Middletown and then ferried across to Chatham village. There they settled on Indian Hill, a small knoll, with Shipyard Lane crossing it, north of Personchauge and south of Wangunk Meadows where two shipyards were. After his father finished his contract as “boss’\"’ shipbuilder in New Haven — November 1776 to October 1778 — Philip and his father took over the Navy Yard at Stevensons Wharf, built in 1767, north of the west end of Shipyard Lane or Indian Hill avenue in Chatham village, (now called Gildersleeve) Nearby were the hot holes or sweating places east of their yard formerly used by the Indians on the river bluff • — the “hot house lot”. Indian Hill had an Indian burial place located there. This section of the village had been an Indian reservation until 1752, when the Indian lands were sold. Philip bought land from Dr. Thomas Wells in 1786, and built a two- story frame house where he also carried on the business of fulling cloth and as clothier between his shipbuilding contracts. He was listed twice in the U. S. Census of 1790, Chatham, Conn., 1:3:2. He built two privateers and other vessels. In 1798, he was master carpenter of the U. S. Ship, “Con¬ necticut” built at Stevenson’s Wharf of 514 tons, mounting 24 guns and commanded by Capt. Moses Tryon. This frigate was contracted for by Gen. Seth Overton. In Barber’s History of Connecticut, a short sketch of the town of Chatham had an account of the ship’s launching and its super¬ vision by its naval architect, Philip Gildersleeve. Middletown, June 7, 1799. The Launch — More of the wooden walls of Columbia. Yesterday at 35 min. and four sec. past five p.m. the U. S. ship Con¬ necticut was safely deposited on the bosom of the majestic stream and hence she derives her name. No words can convey an adequate idea of the beauty and brilliance of the scene. Nature as inclined to do honor on the occasion had furnished one of the most delightful days that the vernal sea¬ son ever witnessed. While old Father Connecticut, eager to receive his beautiful offspring, had swollen his waters by the liquefaction of snows reserved for the occasion near his source in order to facilitate her passage to his waves; and extending his liquid arms welcomed her to his embrace. Flora decked in her richest attire smiled gleefully around and a brilliant con¬ course of spectators from this and neighboring towns whose countenances expressed the liveliest sensibility at thus witnessing the progress of our nau¬ tical armament destined to protect our commerce and hurl the thunders of Columbia on her shrinking foes, formed a most magnificent moving picture in addition to the brilliance of nature which shone around. The preparation for the launch was exquisite and evincive of the con¬ summate skill of the architect who superintended the operations of the day 23 Sylvester Gildersleeve’s Descendants and whose orders were given with dignity and obeyed with punctilious nicety when the moment arrived at which the elegant fabric was to leave her earthly bed never more to return. The anxiety of the crowd was wit' nessed by solemn silence awful and profound. The stroke was struck, the blocks were removed, when lo, with the grace and majesty of the divine Cleopatra or the wonderful Cygnus, she glided into the arms of her parent river and, as if reposing herself to sleep upon a bed of roses, sunk upon his breast. In a moment, the peal of federal¬ ism burst forth. The peans of the gating thousands met the heavens and echo faintly expired on the distant hills. While shad and salmon feel the patriot glow And throng in numerous shoals the waterway And sturdy sturgeon from the depth below, Leap up her matchless beauty to survey. A footnote says: “This paragraph was taken from a Boston news¬ paper.” War with France had broken out and by act of Congress, 30 June 1798, the frigate U.S.S. Connecticut was built with others, Capt. Tryon was ordered in September 1799 to sail to Porto Rico. Arriving Oct. 27, he cruised a month and then sailed to St. Christopher’s arriving Dec. 15 and joining the squadron under Commander Morris. Capt. Tryon left for Guad¬ eloupe and, Dec. 29, 1799, captured the French privateer brig “L’ltalic Conquest”, and recaptured two American vessels and ran a valuable French ship ashore. (Conn. Journal, Jan. 30, 1800) In June 1800, she captured two privateers. In his Account Book, 1790-1841, Abel Lewis sold beef to Philip Gil- dersleeve acting as quartermaster for militia training in 1799 and also for the War of 1812 when Chatham militia did coast guard duty at New Lon¬ don. Dr. Thomas Wells of Chatham sold two acres for £30 to Philip Gilder- sleeve Nov. 30, 1786, west by Benjamin Johnson, north by highway, cast and south by George Lewis. (Chatham Rec. 4:381) The will of Philip Gildersleeve of Chatham in 1822 left the house and homelot to his wife Temperance. (Middletown Probate 2:379) The will of Temperance Gilder¬ sleeve of Chatham in 1831, left her personal effects to Betsy Abbey, Cynthia Lewis and Temperance Gildersleeve, granddaughter, and confirmed the deed to her son Henry of Canada. (Portland, Conn., Probate 2:43) “Temperance Gildersleeve, Oct. 3, 1826, to her son Henry Gilder¬ sleeve of Kingston, Canada, 2 acres of land with dwelling house, barn, and other buildings, bounded east and south by Abel Lewis, west by Sylvester Gildersleeve, north by a highway — also lJ/2 acres of meadow • — reserving to myself the use and improvement during my natural life.” (Chatham Rec. 19:440) Henry of Canada (see No. 46), Feb. 13, 1841, “to his nephew Henry Gildersleeve son of Sylvester Gildersleeve of Chatham” • — (25:476).

He donated the site of the present Trinity Episcopal Church when it moved in 1832 from Bart' lett Street in Gildersleeve village. He owned a valuable tract which covered a vast deposit of “brownstone” which was quarried by his son Daniel. This stone was in demand on fashionable Fifth Avenue, N. Y. City. In 1819, Robert Patten and Daniel Russell opened a quarry above the old Shaler u? Hall Quarry. The firm became afterwards Russell 6? Hall. In 1841, this quarry was united with the old Shaler 6? Hall property and the firms were incorporated as the Middlesex Quarry Co. In 1885, Timothy’s g. 'grandson, F. G. Russell, was president; Chas. A. Jarvis, Sec. 6? Treas.; and Ferdinand and Henry Gildersleeve were among the directors. They used five schooners built in the Gildersleeve shipyard to ship the stone and employed a large force of men and many huge oxen to haul the stone. (Hist.

He also built vessels in Middle Haddam with his son and for a while in Georgia. He saw active service in the war of 1812 as sergeant Aug. 18' 29, 1814, under Nathaniel Johnson, commander; also at Saybrook under Isaac Webber, commander Aug. 30'Oct. 25, 1814.

After a contract in New Haven, Conn., he was engaged by Henry Eckford, noted shipbuilder of N. Y. City, to go to Sackett’s Harbor on Lake Ontario as an expert for the U. S. Gov¬ ernment. The ships were not completed as the War of 1812 came to an end. He moved to Canada and settled in Bath, Ontario, July 1, 1816, becoming the “Father of Navigation” upon the Bay of Quinte. He was the first to build and launch a steamboat on the upper St, Lawrence River. “A syndicate of shareholders in Kingston, Niagara, York, and Prescott, contracted with two Americans, assistants of Eckford’s at Sackett’s Harbor, N. Y., to build a steamer at Finkle’s Point, Ernestown, 18 miles up the lake from Kingston.” (p. 318, “Lake Ontario” by Arthur Pound). There the ”Frontenac” was launched. Sept. 7, 1816, 170 ft. long, 32 feet beam and 700 tons displacement, nearly three times that of the rival, “Ontario” built at Sackett’s Harbor, N. Y. She was burned in 1826 by incendiaries. He built the steamships, “Queen Charlotte”, “Sir James Kempt”, “Commodore Barry”, “Henry Gildersleeve”, “Prince of Wales”, “The New Era”, “The Bay of Quinte”. (“Pioneer Life on the Bay of Quinte” — Gil- dersleeve Family — Toronto, 1905, p. 339). He was a noted shipbuilder and ship owner of Canada. He sold the homestead on Indian Hill, Gildersleeve, Conn., in 1841. (Chatham Rec. 25:476).

Sylvester attended the district school until eighteen, when he began work in his father’s shipyard at the Navy Yard. He also worked in Church' ill’s shipyard at Siam Dock building privateers during the War of 1812. From 1806 to 1816, over 12,500 tons of shipping were built in this locality. From Mashomesic Mountains close by were obtained immense first growth logs of white oak 80 feet long, the ideal material for shipbuilding. The ship' carpenters worked from “sun to sun” — begin at sunrise, take one hour from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. for breakfast, one hour at noon for dinner, then work until sundown. The highest pay was $1 per day. Carpenters went out into the surrounding forests, cut down the trees, and hewed the logs into shape with broad axes. Small saw mills, driven with a little water power, slowly worked out the planking from the tough native oaks. Cattle teams hauled the timber into the shipyard where hand labor slowly did the work. It was customary to carry around in the shipyard and distribute to the men four times a day, a bucket of rum or cider brandy, a home product. The Account Book, 1790' 1841, of Abel Lewis shows payroll deductions for rum partial' larly for sawing and boring holes for ship fastening. In 1815, owing to the operations of the British Army in Canada, the U. S. Government was engaged in constructing vessels of war on the west' ern lakes. Sylvester went with some 500 workmen, engaged by Henry Eck' ford, noted shipbuilder of N. Y. City, to Sackett’s Harbor, on Lake Ontario, to build a 100'gun ship — the largest built in this country then • — the combined fleet of Commodore McDonough at the Battle of Lake Champlain mounting but 86 guns. The weather was clear and cold — the men supplied with “grog” then considered lawful. The ships were never completed, as the War of 1812 soon ended. The men returned home, some of them walking the entire distance to the Connecticut River. His older brother Henry, rec' cgni2;ed as an expert shipbuilder by Henry Eckford of N. Y. City, after a contract in New Haven, Conn., was called to Canada where he build up a flourishing steamboat business in Kingston, Ontario. In 1820, Sylvester obtained a contract at home from Gen. Seth Over' ton of 506 Main Street, to build the “Boston Packet”, 70 tons, cost $3500, Capt. Seth Overton Jr. With this start, he began his long and successful career as one of the most noted shipbuilders in the United States. In 1823, for Gen. Overton, he built his second sloop, “Caravan”, 50 tons, cost $2500, Capt. Seth Overton Jr. His reputation spread as a shipbuilder so ;n 1824, Capt. Gordon Wetmore, merchant, of Middletown, Conn., with 30 Sylvester Gildersleeve’s Descendants others, engaged Sylvester to build his third sloop, “Gordon”, 80 tons, while in 1826, schooner \"Stranger”, 175 tons, cost $5,u00, was built for Joel Hall, the quarryman, and others — the first of many schooners built for the next seventy years. This period was the busy one for the famous “brownstone” of the Portland, Conn., quarries over a mile south down the river of which Sylvester became an investor and director. He built afterwards more than 100 vessels, aggregate value being $2,000,000 of various kinds • — propellers, pilot boats, sloops, ships, barques, brigs, schooners, scows, steam gunboats, barges and lighters. In 1828, he bought out the Churchill shipyard at Siam Dock in Gilder- sleeve, Conn., where the largest privateers for the War of 1812 had \"been built. He bought the Lewis Shipyard, 20 Nov. 1838, in operation from 1743 until about 1825, when he leased it, from Abel Lewis, son of George Jr., and made that site famous as the Gildersleeve shipyard. He had started a brick store, corner of Indian Hill avenue and Main street, Gildersleeve, Conn., in 1821, with general merchandise and shipping stores. He built his home in 1834, at 617 Main street. (Sold by heirs in 1948). At this time, American colonists, invited by the Mexican government to settle in Texas, revolted against Mexico and set up an independent re¬ public. They won their independence in 1836. Capt. Joseph J. Hendley of Middletown, Conn., then 29 years old, came to Sylvester Gildersleeve and urged him to take part in building up a trade with the Republic of Texas. He had been first officer, 1830-1833, with Capt. William H. Pratt of Deep River, Conn., in the New Orleans and Florida trade. He then commanded a schooner from New Orleans making a voyage to the Brazos River, Texas. In 1833, there was one house on the island of Galveston and Texas was a part of Mexico. In the fall of 1834, Capt. Hendley made regular trips to the Brazos River although active war had begun against Mexico. Twice he was chased into the river by the Mexican man-of-war, “Montezuma”, com¬ manded by Capt. Davis, blockading the coast of Texas and a terror to ail blockade runners. Sylvester Gildersleeve built the schooner “William Bryan”, 150 tons, cost $8,000, in 1836, financed by himself, Capt. Hendley and Alexander Keith for the Brazos River trade. She was successful as a vessel in that trade and was commanded by Capt. Hendley until 1839. Then Sylvester under¬ took to build the schooner “Robert Mills”, 200 tons, cost $10,000, for the same trade with Capt. Hendley and his brother William Hendley. In 1842, he built the barque “Star Republic”, 476 tons, cost $22,000, commanded by Capt. Hendley and sailed by him between Galveston and New York up to 1845. On the trip between New York and Galveston, Oct. 6, 1843, he met a hurricane off the N. E. point of Abaco, one of the Bahama Islands. The whole coast of Florida was desolated and Sand Key light house blown down in which the keeper and his w'hole family perished. Great damage was done also at Key West, but the little ship came through safely, losing part of her spars and most of her sails. In 1845, before the annexation of Texas, Capt. Hendley, his brother William, with Philip Gildersleeve, the second son of Sylvester, and John 31 Sylvester Gildersleeve’s Descendants L. Sleight formed the William Hendley 6s? Company at Galveston and in connection with John H. Brower of New York set up the New York and Texas line of packets. The “Star Republic1’ was the pioneer ship and with other vessels owned by the Wakemans of Southport, Conn., made up the Texas 6? New York Line of packets. The Wakemans engaged Sylvester Gildersleeve to build in 1841, the brig “Mary”, 280 tons, cost $14,000; in 1842, the brig “Empire”, 350 tons, cost $17,500; in 1845, the ship “Hart' ford”, 700 tons; in 1862, brig “Rival”, 600 tons; steamship “America”, 900 tons, in 1863 and the steamship, “United States”, in 1864, 1600 tons; which last three did not engage in Texas trade. In 1848, the William Hendley & Company disposed of their vessels, the line reorganized and eight vessels of larger capacity were built from time to time by Sylvester Gildersleeve and his oldest son Henry at Gildersleeve, Conn. They had already built the sloop “Lone Star”, 85 tons in 1844, the schooner “J. G. McNeal”, 90 tons in 1846; the schooner “Uncle Bill”, 90 tons, in 1846, for coasting traffic near Texas. The eight new vessels were the ships “Stephen F. Austin”, 625 tons, in 1847; “B. R. Milan”, 1848, 650 tons; “William B. Travis”, 850 tons, in 1848; “J. W. Fanning”, 500 tons, in 1849; “William H. Wharton”, 1000 tons, in 1850; the “S. Gildersleeve”, 1400 tons in 1854; “National Guard”, in 1857, 1500 tons; and “J. C. Kuhn”, 1100 tons in 1859; the last three were busy on other trips. They were mostly owned by Sylvester, Henry and Philip Gildersleeve, William Jarvis, Joseph J. Hendley, William Hendley, J. H. Watkinson and John H. Brower of New York. A great loss occurred in 1853, when Philip Gildersleeve died. He was a competent, clear headed man and had but few equals. He was corresponding and financial partner. Because of his death, the business of the firm suffered but on a reduced scale again prospered. (Middlesex County, Conn., Hist. 1885, p. 166). The line was successfully conducted until the Civil War broke out. Before that the “Stephen F. Austin” was wrecked on the N. E. point of Abaco, the “B. R.
