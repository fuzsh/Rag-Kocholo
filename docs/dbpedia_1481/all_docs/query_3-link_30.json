Just over 3 acres in size, the park and its playground are popular among neighborhood families for picnics and children’s birthday parties.\n\nDartmouth Park has two pavilions, a small open lawn, and lots of shade from the mature Oak and Pine trees that grow on the site. The park also has an ADA accessible swing. A perimeter sidewalk with benches and a multi-station exercise course makes Dartmouth Park a popular neighborhood destination. Limited parking is available on side streets.\n\nLocation\n\n822 Dartmouth Street, Orlando, FL 32804 View Map\n\nPhoto Gallery"
