        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Modern Biographical Files are located in the Navy Department Library's Rare Book Room. They are a combination of files collected by the Library and a ready reference collection of duplicate flag officer files formerly housed in the Archives Branch of the Naval History and Heritage Command.\n\nThese files have been accumulated since the early 20th century by the Navy Department Library to provide historical information to US Navy personnel and other researchers, both official and unofficial. The files are particularly noted for biographical coverage of senior U.S. Navy officers who served during the Second World War and the Cold War-era, though their contents range from the Interwar period (1919-1939) through the War on Terrorism. For biographical information from the late 18th through the early 20th centuries, see the Navy Department Library's ZB files and Officers of the Continental and U.S. Navy and Marine Corps 1775-1900 ]. Also see Navy Personnel: A Research Guide.\n\nMany of the files consist of individual officer biographies produced during the 1950s through the 1970s by the Navy Office of Information, Internal Relations Division; the Navy Office of Information, Biographies Branch; and the Division of Naval Records and History (OP 29). Additional material consists of newspaper clippings, journal articles, change of command/retirement brochures, and biographies printed from the websites of the Navy Chief of Information and Arlington National Cemetery. Materials continue to be added to these files. Although a majority of the files consist of between two to four pages, a few contain up to four linear inches of material.\n\nUse and Reproduction Policy\n\nBiographical files are unavailable for loan and must be consulted in the library. With regard to non-copyrighted materials, the use of digital cameras without flash is encouraged. Photocopying is generally prohibited, though permission to photocopy a few pages may be granted by the Reference staff, contingent upon the physical state of the documents. All photocopying of materials shall be done by the Reference staff, or under their close supervision. The use of personal scanners by non-library staff must be approved by the Reference staff on a document-by-document basis (Reference: Naval Historical Center Instruction [NAVHISTCENTINST] 5070.1C.).\n\nWeb Accessibility Statement\n\nMany of the documents on the NHHC Web site are in HTML or ASCII (plain text) formats. These formats are generally accessible to people who use screen readers. We also have a large number of documents in Adobe Acrobat® Portable Document Format (PDF). PDF format is used to preserve the content and layout of our hard copy publications. Publications in PDF can only be viewed and printed using the Adobe Acrobat Reader®, version 3.0 or higher. You can download and get help using the Acrobat Reader at the Adobe Systems, Inc. site. The downloadable Acrobat Reader software is available at NO CHARGE from Adobe.\n\nPlease note, there is a known issue with paragraph, or <p></p> tags appearing at the beginning of PDF files, which may cause difficulties with some screen readers. We are working with our vendor on a fix for this issue. If you are experiencing difficulties, and would like obtain this information in a different format, please email us: NHHC-Library@us.navy.mil."
