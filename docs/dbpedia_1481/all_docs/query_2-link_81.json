The date of its christening is February 3, 1854, and its thirty-seventh year has already ended. Four years after the village was named and platted, and when it numbered hardly more than five hundred inhabitants, my parents came here to live; here their three children were graduated, and from here three of the five who constituted our family have been laid to rest in Rosehill Cemetery.\n\nBut very likely it would never have occurred to me to try to put on record the history of the town that has been my home since I was eighteen years of age, had not Rev. Dr. Ridgaway, President of Garrett Biblical Institute, asked me to speak to the students on the anniversary of Mrs. Garrett's (the founder's) birthday in 1886. For that occasion I wrote a familiar sort of \"retrospect,\" and out of it has grown this more extended yet wholly informal account of the origin, history and present condition of our well-beloved town.\n\nI speak as one of the earliest pioneers who yet survive in Evanston. No professor in Institute or University carries his experience of local chronology backward to a period of antiquity so remote as the spring\n\n6\n\nof 1858, at which date I cast in my lot for all the rest of the time, with this Methodist Cambridge of the prairies. The University was but three years and a half old then, the Garrett Biblical Institute some six months older. Not a building now pertaining to either institution was visible save the preparatory department, which, shorn of half its present glories, stood, in glaring white, on the corner facing the home of Mr. T. C. Hoag, and was, in and of itself, \"the university.\" The campus was bare of fences or buildings as the aborigines had left it, and traces of an Indian trail were noted by antiquarian eyes along the shore.\n\nSeveral animate abridged editions of the rise and progress of Evanston are still accessible to the student of local history. All of it they have seen and part of it they have been. \"On the ridge\" they have lived anywhere between forty and fifty years, having at an early day drawn up their feet out of the swamps on either side, by which less hardy pioneers had been discouraged, and planted them upon the firm vantage-ground of what later comers have developed into Evanston's most aristocratic street.\n\nWe will not try to penetrate the legendary period still more remote, when Indians skimmed the great lake in their skiffs, and wigwams wafted their smoke to the skies from among the trees that crown the college campus. After the Indian, came, in the inevitable order of evolution, the hunter and trapper, the soldier and trader; but all these periods, well accentuated\n\n7\n\nas they are in Chicago's history, left small impress on the wilds of Evanston. It is the pioneer who built a home and tilled the peaceful acres his industry had won with whom all actual history begins.\n\nLet us try to picture to ourselves that early day when there was no Evanston, but when the headland, now surmounted by our lighthouse, gave to the territory as far south as Graceland Cemetery the name \"Grosse Point,\" and from the ridge to the lake was one truly \"dismal swamp,\" without a road, and but faintly humanized here and there by the home-hearth of a log cabin.\n\nThe first road across the swamp was built at Rosehill by Mr. Samuel Reed, who still dwells among us, the almost immemorial \"pathfinder,\" or roadmaster of this region. A local chronicler gave to the public some time ago an account of the Reed family and its early experiences, which may fairly be taken as a type. Their log house was on the ridge, nearly opposite the present site of the South Evanston railroad station. It was surrounded by water a good share of the time, and an old-fashioned cradle in which Mrs. Reed had rocked her first-born was used by her boys as a boat in which to go duck-shooting. In ranging over to the lake shore to look after his cattle, Mr. Reed was wont to wade through water up to his waist. Game was abundant and the enterprising housewife arranged a trap near by with a rope tied to her kitchen window from which it could be sprung. In this ingenious\n\n8\n\nfashion she did her marketing almost as conveniently as modern matrons do by telephone; twenty-one prairie chickens at one fell swoop having become her prey. She used to see the agile deer go by in herds, and one day, by way of reprisal, a big wolf slipped into her barn-yard and before a gun could interrupt his mad career had snatched a squealing pig away. Mrs. Reed laughingly describes her little home with its loose board floor, and its roughly-chinked crevices through which the wind was wont to whistle, and tells of climbing the ladder to the loft on winter mornings and brushing the snow off her children's bed before she awakened them.\n\nThis enterprising woman planted an apple tree near her house over forty years ago that usually furnishes its thirty-bushel quota of choice fruit and is the only landmark of those good old times.\n\nA picture like this shows at first glance how long is the road of progress that has been trod, with sometimes halting, sometimes striding steps, by our lovable old town. A few of these fast-fading daguerreotypes I hope to preserve in these pages, to be pointed out to visitors and future comers, along with the queer, gnarled oak and the bowlder with a history on the college campus, the university buildings and the Sheridan Road.\n\n9\n\nPreface.\n\nThe only satisfaction that I have in contemplating this desultory piece of work is that, as a loyal Evanstonian, and pioneer pilgrim to this human oasis, I have helped to preserve some dates, facts and personalities for the use of that staid and dignified individual who will in due season materialize, i.e., \"The Future Historian.\"\n\nFinally, to \"Evanston proper,\" Evanston South, North and West, Evanston as she was, and is, and is to be, let me offer the humble and earnest good wishes of her affectionate and loyal daughter,\n\nFrances E.

Of course the Evanston shore has its ice-bound days and its nights when thunderous waves beat ceaselessly. But the picture that is bright on memory's walls for those who no longer call Evanston their home, is not of these. It is of a quiet city that still prefers to call itself a village; kissed on one cheek by Michigan's waves, fanned from behind by prairie breezes, jeweled with happy homesteads set in waving green, and wreathed about with prairie wild flowers, a town as comely as a bride, even to strangers' eyes. The peculiar glory of the village is its trees — its long avenues bordered with wide-spreading elms and maples and grand old oaks, that stood proud sentinels over Indian wigwams in ages past. Broad streets bordered with parks and\n\n14\n\nwalks that run by unfenced velvet lawns, tell of freedom and peaceful security. A large fountain plays on the public square, and about a small park a block or two away are clustered three churches and a fine club house, while the stately Methodist spire is not far to seek. The college campus by the shore is still a grove of massive oaks amid which stand the noble buildings of the university. Winding along the beach, by the jaunty boat house and life-saving station, skirting the campus, runs the famous new driveway from Chicago — Sheridan Road — which, half a mile north of the college halls, passes the waterworks and lighthouse and leaves Evanston to pursue its winding way to Fort Sheridan. Count half a dozen blocks of stores, half a score of smaller churches, four spacious public school buildings and a fine high school, and fill in the rest with comfortable and often palatial homes for about twelve thousand people, and you have a faint outline of the picture which Evanstonians love.\n\nEvanston; how wholly unexceptionable is this familiar designation! Suppose it had been Evanstown, as some profane ones have been known to write it, or Evansville, as my letters are not unfrequently addressed — the choiceness would be gone. Let us applaud the rare discernment that invented a name not then borne by any town on earth and since then by but one, — Evanston, Wyoming, — doubtless named in honor of our own. Consider, too, the wise adaptedness of the university's cognomen. It was then\n\n15\n\nembodied prophecy; it is embodied history now. Men of more restricted vision planned a \"Chicago\" and a \"Lake Forest\" University, but our trustees looking with prescient gaze adown the future's mystic maze, saw \"all the wonder that should be\" in that \"long result of time,\" of which we have seen nearly forty years, and wrote, not \"Excelsior\" but \"Northwestern\" on their banners. Mighty as the word was then, it is an hundredfold more mighty now. The old Northwest stopped with Minnesota, Iowa and Kansas; the new Northwest stretches to Puget Sound and the Pacific Sea. But iron links now tie those gigantic young commonwealths \"where flows the Oregon\" to the electric city beside Lake Michigan. Northwestern's vigorous sons and dauntless daughters are out yonder; I have found them as far away as my adventurous feet have wandered, and always they were preaching, teaching, toiling to lay broad and deep foundations for Christianity, for education and for the protection of the home.\n\nFigure-heads have their value as character lessons, and enshrined history tells upon a town. When I visited Concord, Mass., it pleased and instructed me not a little to find its whole heroic story \"writ large\" on bowlder, tablet and emblazoned window, for the wayfaring man's especial benefit.\n\nAs a rule our college buildings have names that are significant. That noble pile called University Hall might well bear the name of some great light once\n\n16\n\nwith us, but now passed to holier regions, and the \"Woman's College\" will no doubt become \"— Hall\" some day; while Science Hall should be called after him (or her) who built it, whenever that modest name shall be divulged. Garrett Biblical Institute forever enshrines the memory of an earnest-hearted, Christian woman, Mrs. Elizabeth Garrett, whose husband was mayor of Chicago in 1843-46, and who willed her fortune to the training of theological students in a day when our church lacked facilities in this regard more than in any other. Barbara Heck, \"Founder of American Methodism,\" was honored by associating her name with Heck Hall in 1866, the one hundredth year after her \"call\" to Philip Embury, the neglectful young preacher in New York City, who had \"fallen away\" until her expostulations aroused his conscience. Memorial Hall enshrines in the rich but chastened light of its great windows three of Evanston's most hallowed names: — Dempster, Bannister, and Hemenway, of the Institute, and two of our honored citizens, Queal and Button. The Dearborn Observatory, built by Hon. J. B. Hobbs, reminds us of a prince in our Israel, and I hope the name of L. L. Greenleaf, the past, and William Deering, the present Mecaenas of our town, may yet be associated with the institution they have done so much to build.\n\nSignificant figures rather than ciphers are good\n\n17\n\nmeans by which to designate a street. Thus we have \"Orrington avenue,\" for the discoverer of Evanston, and our chief business thoroughfare is named for Dr. N. S. Davis, once a resident here, and for well nigh half a century the chief physician in the northwest. We have already Greenleaf avenue; while Hinman avenue enshrines the memory of our university's first president. I would we had Noyes avenue, rather than street, for that great man who bore the brunt of battle as \"acting president of the university\" for many years, and laid his life upon its altar. Surely, too, the names of Bishops Simpson and Harris, Fowler, Thompson and Ninde, all of whom have been residents here, and all connected with our institutions, should be, as that of Bishop Foster already is, perpetually associated with our municipality, if not with our university nomenclature. Chicago avenue, a name of small appropriateness, will, probably, one day be exchanged for some other that embalms more of local history, and it would be well if, in addition to Hamilton, Botsford and Brown, other honored names of Evanston's heroic fathers, including Judges Goodrich and Hurd, and those later but not less devoted trustees, the lamented Robert J. Queal and James S. Kirk, might be preserved perpetually here. I am glad there is a Judson avenue, recalling that wise and witty chief, whose mind had the rare scintillant quality and whose manner the quaint originality that is so unforgetable and so refreshing. But Rev. Philo Judson,\n\n18\n\nthe man who at sixty-nine years of age had not a gray hair; whose constant cheer carried him so many years as a circuit rider through the wilds of Illinois, making hard work perpetual holiday; whose powers of observation were so keen that in his last agonizing illness, being unable to turn his head that he might look out of the window, he had a mirror brought that he might watch the falling snow — he merits a chapter by himself.\n\nI am sincerely glad we have the \"Haven School\" in memory of Dr. Otis Haven, that bright and brotherly intelligence, beloved by all of us as few men are, who passed away in the glorious morning of his prime and left no voice behind that was not charmed to speak his praise.\n\nFor the rest we have Wesley avenue and Wesley public school, as a town with Evanston's traditions could hardly be pardoned if it had not; and Asbury, for the first Methodist bishop in America.\n\nFor patriotism we have Washington, Lincoln and Colfax streets, — the last two furnishing indications altogether accurate concerning Evanston's prevailing politics! — while honored early settlers will be forever associated with our classic suburb by such streets as Mulford and Crain, Benson and McDaniel, Kedzie and Lyons.\n\n19\n\nEarliest Memories\n\nThe first schoolhouse and church of our little pioneer settlement was a log cabin of small dimensions which stood near where Mr. Charles Crain now lives, in South Evanston. The school teachers were hired by individual subscriptions, the ministers were Methodist itinerants, and they all \"boarded around.\" The first quarterly conference of the M. E. Church in Evanston was held in this house in July, 1854. The preaching and teaching, the frolics and spelling bees that came off in that old log schoolhouse recall the frontier stories familiar to us all as among the most redeeming features of the olden time. Speaking of this historic cabin, Mrs. John L. Beveridge says:\n\n\"The first Sunday we went there to church [1854] the congregation numbered fourteen people, young and old, men and women. My mother, myself and Mrs. John A. Pearsons, I think, were the only women that had on bonnets such as ladies wear now; the rest had on large sun-bonnets and were dressed in primitive style. A Methodist minister who came through from Vermont, on his way to Minnesota, was appointed by the presiding elder as our pastor. His name was characteristic of everything about him — John G. Johnson. He was a tall, lank individual, dressed in dark blue cotton overalls, with large\n\n20\n\npatches of new cloth on each knee, while the rest of the cloth had been washed until it was almost white. He always carried a big blue cotton umbrella, bulged in the center.\"\n\nMr. B.F. Hill, now of Llewellyn Park, our newest suburb, has written a very interesting sketch of his residence in this locality, going back even so far as 1836. I must give some of his words just as he wrote them:\n\n\"Following the lake shore north as far as Mr. Westerfield's present residence, we came to a tavern kept by Joel Stebbins. This building, I think, tumbled off into the lake about 1838. Mr. Stebbins afterward built a log house on the Ridge, or Green Bay road, as it was then called, a little north of Mr. Bailey's greenhouse. Traces of this house are still to be seen. Proceeding north from the Hathaway place, we came to the lake shore, a little south of the ravine which enters the lake just south of the Swedish theological school. This ravine was afterward known as Hazzard's Glen, taking its name from Captain Hazzard, who settled there, sailing summers and residing in his house winters. The old road along the lake shore has long since been washed away, and the more classic character of the present inhabitants is shown in the changed name of the old ravine, which students and professors now call ‘the Rubicon.’\n\n\"Grosse Point was the name given to the point at the head of the Ridge more than a century ago, and it might properly be so called to-day out of respect to the Indians and pioneers. This was the burial place of the Indians — a sacred spot to them, where they were wont to meet annually from time immemorial, to mourn their departed. To this day I walk over this spot instinctively feeling that I tread on sacred ground. The land belonged to the Pottawatomies, though well known to the Chippewas who now inhabit the north of Michigan.\n\n\"From the Mulford place where the old Kirk homestead\n\n21\n\nnow stands up past Grosse Point to Stebbins' tavern, there were no houses, and the road was scarcely more than an Indian trail, though wagons did pass through. Three brothers of us, of whom I was the youngest, had occasion to go along this way. A little south of the spot where Mr. Bailey's house now stands, the body of an Indian had been deposited, sitting upright in a little pen about six feet long by four wide. His dog, gun and tomahawk were placed with him, it being expected that he would find abundant use for them upon his entrance into the happy hunting-grounds. As we neared this spot our pulses quickened, and we could not forbear glancing at the, to us, awful object. To our horror the flesh had crumbled from the face, leaving the teeth exposed. This proved too much for our bravery, and we broke into a dead run. It was a long time before I conquered my fears enough to go along this road any other way than on the run, always looking back, in the fear and expectation of being followed.\n\n\"When Mr. Stebbins had completed his new log house and got in a full supply of whisky, he was ready for business, and business began. All the ‘claim meetings,’ elections and meetings to transact public business were held here. I recall going many times with my father to these gatherings, and the impressions left upon my youthful mind by seeing the drinking and the conduct resulting therefrom were all the temperance lectures necessary for me.\"\n\nAt a meeting of the university trustees March 28, 1854, it was directed that the Chicago & Milwaukee railroad be requested to locate the station at Evanston on a line west of Davis street, on the small ridge Carney farm. This land was bought of the Carneys October 7, 1853, by Messrs. Brown, Hurd and Benson. The plat of ground, showing the depot where it now\n\n22\n\nstands, dated July 20, 1854, and recorded July 27, 1854, is still in existence. A. J. Brown deeded the depot grounds, and the right of way, consisting of about seven acres, was then staked out, April 15, 1854.\n\nAt that time Mr. John A. Pearsons occupied an old log house near where the Congregational church now stands, and he was one of the first to build a new house after the University had platted the village. In April, 1854, Rev. Philo Judson bought a little house on the ridge, where Mr. B. F. Hill now lives, and began, to build a larger house beside it. During that summer he bought the lumber in Michigan for the building of Dempster Hall. Mrs. Governor Beveridge, Mr. Judson's daughter, gives this interesting reminiscence concerning the erection of that pioneer building — the beginning of Evanston's fame as a theological Mecca:\n\n\"My father came in one morning and said he had a propeller and a schooner both loaded with lumber lying off the point just above here. The lumber had all to be landed, and he had sent around to call out all the farmers and had succeeded in getting forty five men together, who would want dinner. There were no markets near; but we sent out a boy with a horse, who bought up all the bread and early lettuce and a few radishes. We all went into the kitchen and fried and broiled and cooked all the morning, and at noon we got out the farm-wagon and filled two or three clothes baskets with dishes and drove up to where old Dempster Hall afterward stood. Part of the cargo of wet timbers lay there on the knoll and the men stood in the lake, barefooted, some wet to their shoulders and some wet to their waists, getting that lumber ashore. We spread the plates\n\n23\n\nalong the timbers, and the men came out while we served their dinner. Then, gathering up the dishes, we went to the house and cooked again the whole afternoon. At six o'clock we were back to serve their supper. Those men worked for thirty-six hours without lying down, to get that lumber ashore and up the bank. This was the first picnic in Evanston.\n\n\"The Institute was soon begun, and not long afterward Mr. Danks' hotel, which has since grown to be the Avenue House; my husband's house, on Chicago avenue, was next. My father's house was the first built in Evanston, but his property was not then included in the village plat, though it now is, so that ours was the first residence built in the village plat. We got into our house early in December, 1854. In the spring Mr. Pearsons moved into his new house. Then came the building of the railroad, which was in operation by the next year, and the opening of the hotel, and the moving in of several other families. A year or two afterwards the Willards made their home on the spot where Mr. William Deeriug has since built. Next to my father's family and our own, came Judge Hurd, ‘up on the ridge.’ Then Dr. Evans followed, building by the shore, on the site where Mr. L. D. Norton's house now stands.\n\n\"Dempster Hall was, of course, full of students, and whenever there was a case of sickness, or any accident happened, it was the custom to send for Mrs. Pearsons or Mrs. Beveridge, for we were the only two women here who could go; and so it happened that our names were like household words to the first students of Evanston, who are now scattered all over the world as Methodist preachers.\n\n\"The first visit I paid in Evanston was to return a call that Mrs. Pearsons made on me, ‘up on the ridge.’ When I returned it, I came in a farm-wagon, with my feet laid across a board to keep them out of the water, so deep was it across the flat of land on which the depots are now built.\n\n\"Early in the winter of 1854, when the Institute building\n\n24\n\nwas completed and dedicated, our services were carried on there. Previous to this, the church had been moved from the old log schoolhouse into a little room over a store which had been built on Davis street by my father. The building was known as Colvin's store, and stood on the corner now occupied by Mr. Garwood's drug store. The identical building still stands a few hundred feet west, facing Orrington avenue, and is used as a barber shop. My father had fixed the upper room for a congregation of forty people, and gave the use of the room and furnishings to our little church, which had grown to fourteen or fifteen members.\"\n\nPage Image\n\n25\n\nDiscovery and Purchase of Evanston.\n\nHow did this particular site come to be selected for the University, and consequently for our university town? By way of answer, I give this curious narrative, from the lips of the discoverer, the Christophero Colombo of these classic shades, the man but for whom our village would have been located at Jefferson, where the county poorhouse is established; I refer to that indomitable \"Father of Evanston.\" Orrington Lunt. He says:\n\n\"The executive committee were always favorably inclined to go north of the city, to some point on the lake shore, for a location. There was no railroad built at that time, but one was being surveyed — the Chicago & Milwaukee. The committee made several trips, as far north as Lake Forest, but all seemed too far from the city, excepting Winnetka, which was satisfactory; but on trying, we found the site could not be bought at any such price as we could afford, being owned by several parties. The present Rosehill was recommended by Hon. W. B. Ogden, but we found the same objection. It will be remembered that in going north, the travel was over what is now the Ridge road; between that and Chicago avenue there was a wet, almost impassable slough or swamp, and so, in going north, we passed by the lake shore part, without knowing there was any suitable ground for our purpose.\n\n\"After several trips we gave up the idea of finding a suitable\n\n26\n\nplace on the lake shore at the price we could afford. The committee then went out to Jefferson, west of the city, where we obtained options for the purchase of John Gray's and other farms on the ridge, and were about to close the trade. But I had such a strong prejudice in favor of the lake shore, that I could hardly give it up. I one day embraced an opportunity to come again to this locality with a friend, and while he was engaged with his business, I took a stroll over to the shore, through the wet land; I well remember walking over logs or planks on a portion of it. In looking south, it was wet and swampy. Looking north, I noticed the large oak forest trees. The thought first struck me that here was where the high and dry ground began! I wanted to look at it, but it was so near night that I gave it up; but on the way back, I began to think possibly this might be the place we were seeking for. It continued in my dreams all that night, and I could not rid myself of the fairy visions constantly pressing themselves upon my thoughts, — fanciful, beauteous pictures of the gentle, waving lake, its pebbly shore and its beautiful bluffs. These impressions settled it in my mind that I would not vote to accept the options for Jefferson, until the committee should make another trip north. They were to meet that morning, to close the trade. In accordance with my request, the matter was laid over, and a number of the committee went to examine the property. It was a pleasant August day. We drove into what is the present campus, and it was, in its natural condition, just as beautiful as now. We were delighted and some of the brethren threw up their hats, shouting, ‘This is the place!’\"\n\nDr. J. H. Foster, the owner of this tract, was at first unwilling to sell on any terms, though he said the land was worth fifteen or twenty dollars an acre. He was finally induced to make a price, which was accepted and was as followsr twenty-five thousand dollars\n\n27\n\nfor the site (about seventy-one dollars an acre), one thousand dollars cash, balance in ten years, at six per cent interest, the trustees to execute their bond for the payments, secured by mortgage on the land, and guaranteed by the legal trustees present individually; any portion of the land to be released from mortgage from time to time, provided that one hundred dollars per acre should be paid for such release; all taxes and interests being paid. Mr. Lunt, in speaking of the transaction, recently remarked: \"I well remember when I called on Dr. Foster and notified him of the acceptance of this proposition, that his countenance fell, showing that he was not really pleased with the transaction.\"\n\nOrrington Lunt was a Maine man at the start and has been a \"main\" man ever since. I have often wondered if a love of the sea, which is the natural inheritance of those born, as he was, almost in sight of its billows, may not have confirmed in him, whose Chicago home was on the lake shore, the purpose to persist, as his associates did not, in the effort to discover a lake shore rather than an inland Evanston.\n\n28\n\nGarrett Biblical Institute.\n\nTwo important streams of influence united to form our theological seminary, each of which might be traced almost indefinitely by the curious historian. The most direct we shall follow back to March 5, 1805, when, near Newburg, N. Y., Eliza Clark was born. At the age of twenty she was married to Augustus Garrett and in 1834 came with her husband to reside in Chicago, then a small town of about 400 inhabitants. Mr. Garrett acquired quite a fortune and was one of the early mayors of the city. In the year 1839 under the pastorate of Rev. Peter R. Borein, there was a great religious revival in the First Methodist Episcopal Church. As a result of this many were received into the church, and among them Mr. and Mrs. Garrett. After her husband's death in 1848, Mrs. Garrett, a lady of beautiful character and earnest piety, desired to devote a large portion of her property to religious purposes, and consulted trusted advisers with this intent. Among those to whom she applied was her attorney, Hon. Grant Goodrich. When he suggested the founding of a theological school she said that \"such a purpose had for some time been the subject of her thoughts.\" Rev. John Clark, her pastor,\n\n29\n\nRev. Dr. Daniel P. Kidder, and Rev. Hooper Crews, independently gave her the same counsel. A small book on Ministerial Education by Rev. Dr. Stephen M. Vail, also influenced her decision. In December, 1853, her will was signed, as drawn up by Judge Goodrich, bequeathing the larger part of her property to found the Garrett Biblical Institute. The income of the estate being seriously impaired by financial fires and incumbrances, Mrs. Garrett would only accept $400 per year for her own support, that as much as possible might be applied to clear it.\n\nTurning now to the other important source, we notice that among the missionaries sent by John Wesley to America was a Scotchman named James Dempster, who had been educated in the University of Edinburgh. To a son, born to him in Florida, N. Y., Jan. 2, 1794, he gave the name of John. Converted at the age of eighteen at a camp-meeting, John Dempster responded to a call to the ministry, and during the next thirty years experienced all the vicissitudes of a Methodist minister's life. He was a circuit rider in the Canadian wilderness, a pastor of important churches, a presiding elder, a missionary to Buenos Ayres and a popular preacher in New York City. Meanwhile he had always been a diligent student and had made himself familiar with Latin, Greek, Hebrew, philosophy and natural science. He would rise regularly at four o'clock in the morning for study. His observation, especially that as a presiding elder,\n\n30\n\nwrought in him the profound conviction that the Methodist Church stood in pressing need of theological schools, and to the founding of these he resolved to devote all his powers. He was widely known in the church as an able preacher, a scholar of varied accomplishments, and particularly as a metaphysician.\n\nWith little encouragement and in the face of strong opposition Dr. Dempster began the work of the first theological seminary of the Methodist Episcopal church at Newbury, Vermont, in the year 1845. Closely associated with him in the new movement were Professors Osmon C. Baker, Charles Adams and Clark T. Hinman. In 1847 this Biblical Institute was transplanted to Concord, N. H., and ultimately became the School of Theology of the Boston University. To show the spirit of the man and the good fight he fought, I transcribe his own references to the conflict from a letter found among his manuscripts. It is dated June 27, 1856, and says: \"For the last twelve years I have, from an overwhelming sense of duty, been occupied in an enterprise in the face of fierce and persistent opposition on the part of at least two-thirds of our entire ministry. Some of the highest dignitaries of the church have exerted official influence to embarrass and subvert the enterprise. Many friends of my tenderest remembrance forsook me for having allied myself to this cause, and even transferred their hostility from the cause to him who advocated it. To insure success to this persecuted enterprise I found\n\n31\n\nsuch devotion to its interests indispensable as involved the almost total neglect of private friendships and the interchange of kindly courtesies.\"\n\nSuch was the history and spirit of the man who, seeing his first school well established at Concord, turned his face westward to found similar institutions in the Mississippi Valley and on the Pacific Coast. Filled with this purpose he accepted the presidency of the college at Bloomington, Ill. Upon coming west, however, he learned of Mrs. Garrett's generous provisions and was invited by those who represented her to co-operate in carrying out her plans.\n\nThe day after Christmas, 1835, a meeting was called of those favoring higher education for Methodist ministers, in the old Clark street church, Chicago. Rev. Philo Judson presided, and Dr. Dempster, then on his way to Bloomington, addressed the meeting. The next day the organization of a Biblical Institute Association was effected, with five directors to act as trustees for a period of five years or until a charter for a permanent institution should be obtained. Two days later it was agreed between this directorate and Dr. Dempster that they were to provide a building at Evanston and $1,600 a year, and he was to serve as professor, secure two associates, and collect such additional funds as should be necessary for current expenses. A\n\n32\n\nsubscription was immediately taken. In April of the next year a contract was let for the building, and in July the Revs. William Goodfellow and Wesley P. Wright were elected to professorships. In January, 1855, the new building, known in later years as Dempster Hall, was formally dedicated. Mrs. Garrett was among those present. The Chicago friends drove out in sleighs. The term inaugurated began with four students and closed with sixteen.\n\nThe charter of the Garrett Biblical Institute is dated Feb. 15, 1855. The incorporators are Orrington Lunt, John Evans, Philo Judson, Grant Goodrich and Stephen P. Keyes. The first meeting of this board occurred June 22, 1855. Judge Grant Goodrich was elected president, and Mr. Orrington Lunt, secretary; the former retained his office until his recent decease, and Mr. Lunt continues to devote himself unsparingly to the arduous duties of secretary and treasurer.\n\nThe first term under the new organization opened Sept. 23, 1856.\n\nDr. Dempster was formally constituted professor of systematic theology; Dr. Daniel P. Kidder, professor of practical theology; Dr. Henry Bannister, professor\n\n33\n\nof Greek, Hebrew and Sacred literature, and Rev. John K. Johnston, principal of the preparatory department. Rev. Obadiah Huse was appointed house governor in charge of the school building.\n\nDr. Kidder, a graduate of the Wesleyan University, had been a missionary in Brazil, and also for twelve years corresponding secretary of the Sunday-school Union and Tract Society of the M. E. church. Of his seven publications those on \"Homiletics\" and \"The Christian Pastorate\" are the most noteworthy.\n\nDr. Bannister was graduated at the Wesleyan University and the Auburn Theological Seminary, and had taught for eighteen years before coming to Evanston, chiefly in the Oneida Conference Seminary. Professor Johnston was a graduate of Dublin University.\n\nThe history of the thirty-seven years since this seminary opened its beneficent doors can not be attempted here. Many references to it and especially to its trustees and faculty will be found in the following pages.\n\nTabulated lists of its trustees and professors have been formed from official sources, and will not only be convenient for reference, but prove suggestive to the older friends of the Institute.\n\n34\n\nTRUSTEES.\n\nHon.

Cumnock, A.M., 1884 —\n\nThe bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church constitute an official Board of Council and no professor can be elected without their approval.\n\nDr. John McClintock was elected to the chair of Ecclesiastical History in 1856, but did not accept it. From 1861 to 1865 Bishop Simpson was nominally president of the Institute, but his relation was not an active one. Professor Cumnock's connection with the Institute dates back to 1869, from which year he served as instructor until his election to a professorship in 1884. The Revs. Moses S. Cross, B. D., Milton S. Vail, A. M. and Charles Horswell, B. D., have been regularly appointed instructors in Elementary Greek and Hebrew. From 1879 to 1884 Dr. Ninde occupied the President's chair most acceptably. Since that time the position has been ably and successfully filled by Dr. Henry B. Ridgaway.\n\nHeck Hall, a substantial and commodious dormitory costing sixty thousand dollars, was built in 1866-67, when Rev. Dr. James S. Smart was financial agent, and his efforts were nobly seconded by the Ladies' Centenary Association, of which Mrs. Bishop Hamline was president, and Miss Frances E. Willard\n\n36\n\ncorrespending secretary. I think Miss Willard regards this work as her introduction to public life. It is not unfitting here to make grateful acknowledgment of the large part women have borne in the support of the Institute. Its founder is the first of a noble succession. Mrs. Cornelia A. Miller's generous endowment of the chair of Practical Theology by the gift of thirty thousand dollars has linked her name forever with that of Mrs. Garrett. It was appropriate that the new hall built so largely by the efforts of the ladies should bear the heroic name of Barbara Heck. Another revered name, that of Mrs. Sarah Stewart, has been, by the liberal gift of her sons, assured of perpetual remembrance among those of the school's benefactors. Other names, which can not yet be recorded, will soon prove their claim to a place in this goodly list.\n\nAll the liberal friends who have contributed to the prosperity of the seminary can not be mentioned here; but the constant devotion of the trustees and their wise administration commands the admiration and gratitude of all concerned. It is fitting to make special mention of Judge Grant Goodrich, who for thirty-five years devoted unremitting attention to its welfare; and to Mr. Orrington Lunt, who throughout the same period, as secretary and treasurer, has made the interests of the Institute of equal importance with those of his own family. A worthy successor to Judge Goodrich in the presidency of the board has been found in Mr. William Deering.\n\n37\n\nWe quote from a historical sketch by Judge Goodrich some interesting facts concerning the finances of the school.\n\n\"The financial history of the Institute has been one of marked vicissitude, but under the unremitting labors and skillful management of the trustees, the generous liberality of the church, and the blessing of God, it has been one of marvelous success. The endowment left by Mrs. Garrett was in real estate, most of it in the business part of Chicago. When it passed from the executors of Mrs. Garrett to the trustees it was mostly unproductive. The trustees put as much of it as possible under ground rents, in which they were satisfactorily successful, but the financial embarrassments of 1857 compelled the lessee of the most valuable part to give up his lease in the succeeding year. In 1860 the Wigwam in which Mr. Lincoln was nominated, was erected upon it at a comparatively nominal rent. This building was afterwards purchased and converted into business tenements, but was burned in 1867. In 1870, a block of brick stores was built upon it at a cost of $65,000, which with $25,000 assumed in the erection of Heck Hall, and $2,000 paid on the purchase of the Wigwam, constituted an indebtedness of $92,000. This building, with two other brick stores, was swept away in the great fire of October, 1871, leaving most of the property not only unproductive, but incumbered with the whole debt of $92,000. This great calamity left the financial affairs of the institution in a most deplorable condition; but by the generous liberality of the entire church in its contributions for the relief of the suffering brethren of Chicago, the Institute realized as its share $62,500, and the trustees, as the only means of paying the debt and securing the support of the school, erected in 1872 a larger building at a cost of $110,000. For the ensuing year the property yielded an income of $25,000, but the panic of 1873 so bankrupted lessees\n\n38\n\nand depressed rents that in 1878 we had run behind $1,500, and the estimated deficiency for the ensuing year was $5,000. The trustees called the faculty together, and having submitted the financial condition, informed them that they had resolved to sell none of the property and contract no liabilities for the current expenses of the school; that the only way it could be continued was by an appeal to the church for relief, and if that failed, the school must be closed until its endowment could be relieved of incumbrance. A meeting of the friends of the institution was then called, and it was resolved to make an appeal to the church to cancel the indebtedness and increase the endowment. The faculty generously contributed one-fourth of their salaries, but little progress was made until, by appointment of the Rock River Conference in 1879, the services of the Rev. W. C. Dandy, D.D., were procured. He entered upon the work with a thorough appreciation of its importance, and prosecuted it with an intelligent zeal, an earnest but kind persistency, which gave him a wonderful success, not only in obtaining pecuniary relief, but in awakening an interest in behalf of ministerial education in the church at large. Among the numerous gifts obtained during this period was the noble benefaction of Mrs. Cornelia A. Miller, of Joliet, of thirty thousand dollars for the endowment of the chair of Practical Theology. Through Dr. Dandy's labors and the fortunate sale of some riparian rights, we are able to make the gratifying announcement to the church that all the debts of Garrett Biblical Institute have been paid. Reliable progress is also being made towards a handsome increase of the endowment, and the income will be adequate to meet all current expenses, unless an unforeseen depreciation in rents should occur. It is earnestly hoped that as the wants of the school are constantly increasing, the worthy example of Mrs. Miller will be followed by others, that thus the Institute may be placed fully abreast with all the requirements of the age.\"\n\n39\n\nThe history of the beautiful Memorial Hall is officially given as follows:\n\n\"The building originated with the Centennial year of the Methodist Episcopal Church, 1884, as Heck Hall had with the Centenary of American Methodism, 1866.\n\n\"Three of the professors, feeling the need of such a structure, pledged themselves to the amount of eight hundred dollars when it should be undertaken. There was no further movement until the spring of 1885. The President, Dr. Ridgaway, received from Rev. E. H. Gammon, a member of the Board of Trustees, the generous pledge of five thousand dollars toward the object. Soon after, at the annual May meeting of the trustees, Mr. Wm. Deering, another member of the Board, pledged an additional five thousand dollars; whereupon the trustees, in their corporate capacity, promised six thousand dollars, or one-fifth of the cost, provided it should not exceed thirty thousand dollars. With these subscriptions for a beginning, the work of raising subscriptions was steadily prosecuted, until, in the spring of 1886, it was thought the amount of subscriptions justified contracting for the building.\n\n\"The contract was accordingly made after plans and specifications by W. W. Boynton, Esq., of Chicago. These plans were worked out from drawings by Prof. Charles F. Bradley, who had embodied the result of observations in some of the tails in the east.\n\n\"Ground was broken for the foundation by the venerable Judge Goodrich, president of the Board of Trustees, on Thursday, May 13, in the presence of the trustees, official visitors, members of the faculty and a large number of friends.\n\n\"The building is made of red pressed brick with a foundation of gray limestone, and with trimmings in buff Bedford stone and red terra cotta; the whole length, including apse, is one hundred and fifteen feet, and average width, sixty feet. It stands facing the south, with the entrance by the base of a tall\n\n40\n\ntower, in the open belfry of which at some time it is purposed to place a bell or chime of bells. The architecture is peculiar, but might be called Romanesque in its general outline.\"\n\n\"It was dedicated with appropriate services on May 10, 1887, Bishop C. D. Foss, D.D., LL. D., preaching the sermon, and Bishop S. M. Merrill, D.D., LL. D., performing the dedicatory services.\n\n\"It contains fine large lecture rooms, library, reading-room and chapel, besides offices for the president and professors. The spacious and beautiful chapel contains rich memorial windows of exquisite coloring and appropriate designs. The plans for these are mostly due to the pains-taking care and critical taste of Prof. C. W. Bennett. They commemorate the deceased professors, Doctors Dempster, Bannister and Hemenway, Bishops Simpson and Wiley, the Reverends Hooper, Crews, A. G. Button, and S. G. Lathrop, Judge Goodrich and Mr. Robert F. Queal. The donors of these windows were the Alumni, the First Methodist Episcopal church of Evanston, the Cincinnati and Rock River Conferences, Mrs. A. G. Button, and Messrs. H. N. Higinbotham and Wm. H. Craig.\"\n\nBiographical sketches of the presidents and professors will be found elsewhere in this volume with an account of the important contributions made by several of them to theological literature. It is worthy of notice that most of the bishops and leading men of the church have been brought to Evanston to lecture before the students of the Institute, and that the annual lecture course is greatly enjoyed by many of our citizens.\n\nIn all, up to 1891, five hundred and twenty-four have been regularly graduated from the Institute, but over twelve hundred have received instruction during these thirty-seven years. The Alumni are\n\n41\n\nministering in all parts of the church, about thirty having gone into foreign mission fields. Thirty-four have received the degree of Doctor of Divinity. Among those who have been appointed to official position are Bishop Charles H. Fowler; the General Conference Secretaries, Doctors James S. Chadwick, William A. Spencer, and Joseph C. Hartzell; the college presidents, Wm. H. H. Adams, Thomas F. Berry, Edmund M. Holmes, Thomas Van Scoy, Horace N. Herrick and Joseph H. Sparling; the professors, F. Wm. Heidner, J. Riley Weaver, John Poucher, Henry J. Crist, Benton H. Badley, Robert D. Sheppard, Nathan Burwash, Melville C. Wire, Eli McClish, George E. Ackerman, Charles F. Bradley, George T. Newcomb, Edward L. Parks, John J. Garvin, Edward Thomson, Nels E. Simonsen, George H. Horswell, William H. Crawford, Charles Horswell, Gerhardt C. Mars and William Rollins. It is significant, as showing the radiating influence of the seminary, that twelve of the above are teaching in some department of theology. Our journalists are Oliver A. Willard, William S. Harrington, Charles H. Zimmerman and Charles M. Stuart. The preachers and pastors sent out, constitute a noble army, whose work is of the utmost importance, but it seems impossible to name any without making unfair distinctions. The distinguished need no record here.\n\nThe founding of the Norwegian-Danish Theological\n\n42\n\nSeminary and its affiliation with the Institute as a department, has been accomplished under the wise administration of Principal Nels E. Simonsen. It has an excellent building and an encouraging attendance, and is doing admirable work.\n\nThe growth of the past ten years has been rapid and gratifying, and the standard of instruction has been steadily advanced. The attendance for the year 1889-90 was one hundred and eighty-six, including twenty in the Norwegian-Danish department. With twenty-six students in the Swedish theological seminary, our neighboring school, the total of two hundred and twelve places Evanston as a theological centre in the front rank. Together with the four other Protestant theological seminaries of Chicago, a strength in numbers of over five hundred students and an aggregate of ability in theological instruction is secured, such as would surprise those who know Chicago only as a commercial city, and gives assurance of immeasurable Christian and educational influence.\n\nThe material equipment of our Evanston theological school in buildings, library and endowment is generous if not wholly adequate. Its faculty includes men of ability, learning, and distinguished reputation. Its alumni are exerting a wide and extending influence in the Methodist Church in all lands. Its history, location and present prosperity justify large expectations for its future.\n\n43\n\nOrigin of Northwestern University.\n\nOur great institution, the University, always the central figure of Evanston's lengthening and varied panorama, has had a growth notably slow and sure. The men who laid its strong foundations and imparted to it their own exact and masterful character, were in no hurry to have it become famous. They had studied the institutions of the Old World and knew that a century is of small account in the growth of a great seat of learning. The banyan tree is perhaps its truest emblem — sending its roots deeply into the soil, spreading them out far and wide, while its broadening canopy does not outgrow its hidden basis of supply, and when its life force warrants the new venture, not before, sending out strong arms, which, striking downward, take fresh root and hold in gigantic steadfastness the whole, great tree. A strong financial groundwork has always been beneath the gradually growing structure that gives to Evanston its fame, and is, as it will always be, its chief determinative force.\n\nIn the order of evolution, University and Theological School Preceded Evanston and gave it being.\n\n44\n\nWere this not true, our little burg could not boast of fourteen Doctors of Divinity! But Evanston began in a prayer-meeting, and I can prove it. On the 31st of May, 1850, half a dozen earnest Christian men met by appointment, in the law office of Hon. Grant Goodrich in the city of Chicago. Their object, often talked and prayed about before, was the founding of a university that should be a fountain of Christian scholarship for the northwest. Rev. Zadoc Hall, pastor of Indiana Street M. E. Church, led in prayer, and if others did not pray audibly I know that Richard Haney, pastor of Clark Street M E. Church, and Rev, R. H. Blanchard, pastor of Canal Street M. E. Church, were lifting up their hearts to God as they knelt there together, and I am equally sure that this was true of Judge Goodrich, Orrington Lunt, John Evans, J. K. Botsford, Henry W. Clarke and Andrew J. Brown, the chief laymen with whom Chicago was then blessed in the M. E. Church. So, as I said before, our town began in a prayer-meeting, and that fact prophesied its beautiful career.\n\nMr. Lunt gives the following statement in relation to this first meeting and other preliminary steps in this great movement:\n\n\"Grant Goodrich was called to the chair, and Andrew J. Brown appointed secretary. Addresses were made by Rev. Richard Haney and Dr. Evans, after which the following preamble and resolutions were offered, and unanimously adopted:\n\n\"WHEREAS, The interests of sanctified learning require the\n\n45\n\nimmediate establishing of a university in the northwest, under the patronage of the Methodist Episcopal Church; be it\n\n\"Resolved, That a committee of five be appointed to prepare a draft of a charter, to incorporate a literary University, to be located at Chicago, to be under the control and patronage of the Methodist Episcopal Church, to be submitted to the next General Assembly of the State of Illinois.\n\n\"Resolved, That said committee memorialize the Rock River, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Northern Indiana Conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church, to mutually take part in the government and patronage of said university.\n\n\"Resolved, That a committee of three be appointed to ascertain what amount can be obtained for the erection and endowment of said Institution.\n\n\"At the next meeting, Dr. Evans, on the part of the committee, reported a draft of a charter, which, on examination, was adopted. It was substantially the same as the present charter.\n\n\"Pursuant to public notice for the purpose of organizing the Northwestern University, a meeting was held at the Clark Street Church, in the city of Chicago, on the 14th day of June, 1851. To fill the place of Eri Reynolds, Dr. N. S. Davis was elected. A ballot for officers resulted as follows: John Evans, president; A. S. Sherman, vice-president; Andrew J. Brown, secretary; J. K. Botsford, treasurer. The Presidency of the Institution was established, with a salary of one thousand two hundred dollars; the person occupying the Presidency was also to be professor of moral philosophy and belles-lettres. A Professorship of Mathematics, one of Natural Sciences, and another of Ancient and Modern Languages, were established.\n\n\"It was resolved at that meeting that a Preparatory Department should be established; it was to be located in Chicago, and the executive committee was given power to purchase a site for the same. This committee opened negotiations with the Universalist Church of Chicago, for the purchase of eighty\n\n46\n\nfeet on Washington street, but the offer of four thousand eight hundred dollars for both lot and church was not accepted; they wanted five thousand five hundred dollars.\"\n\nThere were no schools to prepare for college or university at that time in the city of Chicago, no high schools or anything of that kind; and it was thought best to commence with an academy or Preparatory School in Chicago. John Evans and O. Lunt were appointed committee to search for a site for a preparatory building. They finally hit upon the block now occupied by the Grand Pacific hotel. The owner, Mr. P. F. W. Peck, asked eight thousand dollars for it — one thousand dollars cash and the rest on two years' time. The trustees had no money as yet, so to raise the one thousand dollars cash the following men showed their loyalty to the cause by subscribing the money: O. Lunt, two hundred and fifty dollars; Dr. John Evans, two hundred and fifty dollars; J. K. Botsford, two hundred dollars; A. S. Sherman, two hundred dollars; Grant Goodrich, one hundred dollars; George F. Foster, one hundred dollars; A. J. Brown, fifty dollars; Dr. N. S. Davis, twenty-five dollars.\n\nThe trade was closed by Dr. Evans, who took a deed of the land in his own name, and gave Mr. Peck a mortgage, and the trustees became personally responsible.\n\n47\n\nThis property is still in the possession of the University. Mr. Lunt recently remarked:\n\nThis was the smartest thing we ever did. There was nothing particularly smart in the purchasing, but the smart thing was in the keeping of it, for it is now worth about a million dollars.\n\nAt the next annual meeting the plan of having a preparatory school in Chicago was abandoned, so that the land was never used for a university building.\n\nSoon after this purchase, a subscription paper was circulated, to raise funds for the university, and to erect a preparatory building. That subscription amounted to about twenty thousand dollars; the names and exact amounts will be found in the appendix at the end of this book.\n\nAt a meeting held October 1, 1852, Rev. Philo Judson was appointed agent for the university, to solicit funds. At the third annual meeting, June 22, 1853, Rev. Clark T. Hinman, trustee from the Michigan Conference, was elected president of the university. He was decidedly in favor of beginning a University proper, instead of a preparatory, in Chicago. At the next annual meeting he was formally elected Professor of moral philosophy and logic. Rev. Dr. Abel Stevens was elected professor of rhetoric and English literature, but did not accept. Rev. Dr. Wm. D. Godman was made professor of Greek, and Henry S. Noyes, of mathematics. At the latter meeting the agent reported the estimated valuation of the university\n\n48\n\nproperty at $191,000, with liabilities of $32,000. Perpetual scholarships had been sold to the amount of $90,000, but this amount was never all collected.\n\nAt a meeting of the executive committee, held March 15, 1855, a committee of five, consisting of Dr. N. S. Davis, John Evans, O. Lunt, Grant Goodrich and Philo Judson, were appointed to correspond and make preliminary arrangements for the election of a president at the approaching annual meeting of the Board, Dr. Hinman having died.\n\nIt was resolved that the university be opened on the first day of the following November, and the committee was appointed to procure plans and estimates for the building, and report at the next meeting of the Board.\n\nIt was in the fall of 1869 that the preparatory was first opened to ladies. There were less than twenty the first year, but the experiment finally resulted as favorably as its warmest advocates could wish. In the fall of 1871, owing to the large increase of lady students through the connection of the Evanston College for Ladies with the university, the first lady teacher was employed. Mrs. Lizzie Winslow was the person upon whom the honor was conferred. In 1889 we had three — Miss Harriet Kimball, Miss Leila Crandon and Miss Ada Townsend; and the young lady students in the department numbered 161; young men, 436.\n\nDuring the summer of 1871 the preparatory building was moved to its present site, and greatly enlarged\n\n49\n\nand refitted to meet the new demands, for which, as it was, it was entirely inadequate.\n\nIn 1873 Prof. (now Dr.) Herbert F.; Fisk succeeded Rev. Mr. Winslow, and the subsequent years of prosperity bear everywhere the impress of his strong personality and hard work.\n\nThe University museum, a monument to the devoted labors of Dr. Oliver Marcy, deserves more than a passing mention, but must be seen to be understood and appreciated. From the time of its origin, under Robert Kennicott, in 1857, to the present hour, it has been steadily growing, mostly through the contributions of graduates, who delight thus to show their love for their alma mater and for the revered doctor who has lavished his days and years upon the great collection.\n\nIn 1873 it was thought wise to erect the first permanent building of the noble group that makes our otherwise commonplace village a \"classic town.\" The best models on both sides of the water had been studied; Chicago's then chief architect, G. P. Randall, was chosen to superintend the work, but it is well known that Dr. Bonbright was the good genius of the building that elder Evanston was wont to call \"a poem in stone,\" but which technically bears the proud designation of \"University Hall.\" If there is anywhere a fairer or more noble single structure, devoted to scholastic purposes, \"old timers\" would be glad to have it pointed out. Already the university had\n\n50\n\nrejoiced and sorrowed over the gain and loss of three great presidents, Drs. Hinman, Foster and Cummings, sketches of whose lives will be found among the Personalia. The former died after having been at the head of affairs but a brief period; the latter, great and gifted, resigned in 1860 and returned universally bemoaned, to New York city, whence he had come. Thereafter for nine years (1860 to 1869), Prof. Henry S. Noyes had the title of \"Acting President,\" and during his incumbency the beautiful new hall aforesaid was built and dedicated, a number of distinguished men participating in the exercises.\n\nProf. Noyes had the department of mathematics, in which his acquirements reached the height of genius, and, unlike most men of that stamp, he was equally good in mathematics applied to everyday affairs. Nobody better understood the potential value of real estate, or planned more wisely for building up the finances of the university, which was beloved by him as if it were his child. During his period of management the Snyder farm was added to the real estate basis of the enterprise. He attended to the leasing of property, opened new streets, collected debts; indeed, looked after every detail with the scrupulous exactness which was one of his most pronounced characteristics; conciliated everybody with whom he dealt, so that to this day I have never heard a harsh word spoken of him; went to the city to endless executive committee meetings, for the institution\n\n51\n\nhad then no office here save in his study, and no quorum of its trustees nearer than the office of Judge Goodrich. Few sights were more familiar on our streets than the bay horse and light covered buggy, in which at all hours and in all weathers, that indefatigable man fulfilled the duties of business factotum to the university. Beside these he carried his full complement of heavy college classes, attending to the ceaseless hospitalities incumbent upon the president, maintaining discipline, pronouncing baccalaureate addresses that were gems of classic thought and diction, presenting the diplomas in sonorous Latin, greeting every body with a brother's hand of kindness at the levee, and never missing a church prayer-meeting in all those crowded years. If his mental processes had not been lightning-like, his temper perfect and his physique phenomenal in power, this remarkable man could never thus have wrought. What wonder that under such pressure his health began to break! I met him in Paris in the spring of 1870, whither he came with Mrs. Noyes and their only daughter, Maggie, hoping for recuperation. But disease had gone too far, and on May 24, 1872, the whole town sorrowfully followed him to his rest in Rosehill Cemetery. No one ever connected with the institution has placed upon it a more skillful hand or at a time when it was more plastic to his touch. \"To the last syllable of recorded time\" that honored name should be associated with Northwestern, and doubtless it will some day be\n\n52\n\npermanently connected with some building of the growing group upon the college campus.\n\nRev. Dr. E. O. Haven, later known still more widely as Bishop Haven, was elected to succeed Prof. Noyes, in 1869, and resigned in 1872.\n\nRev. Dr. Charles H. Fowler, now a bishop of the Methodist Church, was elected president of the university in 1872 and resigned in 1876, after which Dr. Oliver Marcy, professor of natural history, was acting president until 1881. From that time until May 7, 1890, Rev. Dr. Joseph Cummings ruled in love and wisdom over this now great institution, and impressed upon it his strong personality; lavishing in its interest the best thoughts and unsparing labor of his days and nights. Short personal sketches of these noble men will be found in the chapter devoted to those salient Evanston personalities which circumstances have brought within my individual ken.\n\nWhen we consider the grain of mustard-seed planted in that Chicago lawyer's office forty years ago, the old-timer looks with a feeling very like admiration on statements like this, which recently appeared in a leading newspaper:\n\n\"Northwestern University now has an endowment of nearly $3,000,000, largely productive, and a total attendance of 1,692 students, with 112 professors and instructors. It has a large equipment of buildings and implements of instruction, with its departments of letters and theology situated directly upon the shore of the lake, in an ideal campus of fifty acres, chiefly\n\n53\n\ngrove land of ancient white oak. Its standards of admission are high, and yet they are advanced almost annually. It admits women to all departments, and they do good work. Its several colleges are liberal arts, law, medicine, theology, dentistry, pharmacy, fine arts, music and oratory. Its founders bought farm lands, platted the village, now of 10,000 people, and secured in its legislative charter two remarkable benefits: (1) that no property it might acquire should ever be taxed; (2) that no intoxicating liquor should ever be sold as a beverage within four miles. In both cases prohibition has prohibited.\"\n\nTHE PREPARATORY DEPARTMENT.\n\nAt the annual meeting of the trustees in 1857 it was voted that the use of a portion of the university building be granted for an academic institution, such as should meet the approval of the faculty of the university. This was the beginning of the Preparatory School which now overcrowds the whole of the building which was then the ‘University,’ and whose 671 students in 1891 are a convincing argument for new and larger quarters in the near future.\n\nFor nine years the college and Preparatory School were under the same faculty. But in 1866, Prof. Kistler made out separate courses of study for the preparatory, and in the fall of that year it started in its new life. Both departments continued in the old building until the university moved into its present quarters, in 1873. Prof. Kistler, in addition to his work in the university, had charge of the preparatory and continued his work there for two years, achieving a grand success\n\n54\n\nin getting the department fairly on its feet. At the end of that period, finding the double work too hard, he resigned his position in the Preparatory School, and Dr. D. H. Wheeler, acting president of the university, was put in charge. Almost at the commencement of this school year the management of the department was left to Rev. Geo. H. Winslow, who had been an instructor in the department since its organization, and at the close of the year, on Dr. Wheeler's recommendation, he was elected principal. This position Mr. Winslow held for four years, during which time the attendance more than doubled. (1869-73.) Science Hall.\n\nScience Hall as a feature of the university, had its inception in the recognition on the part of the faculty and trustees that the most pressing need of the institution was for proper facilities for laboratory instruction in physics and chemistry, in order that these departments might be brought up to the standard demanded of higher institutions for scientific education. The next step, a very important one, was taken by the energetic agent, who bestirred himself and found a liberal friend of the institution to make the gift of forty-five thousand dollars to be devoted to this specific purpose. The building, especially designed from the start for the accommodation of these departments, was begun in the spring of 1886. It was first used for class work in April of the following year. At the present\n\n55\n\ntime it provides for each of the two departments a lecture room, apparatus loom and professor's room; in addition for physics, a general laboratory, five smaller rooms for special work, and a workshop; for chemistry two laboratories, an assistant's room and store rooms. The two laboratories contain together fifty-eight individual work tables. This provision, three years ago, was considered a liberal one. At the present time it is not equal to the demand. DEARBORN OBSERVATORY.\n\nIn June, 1889, the telescope and other astronomical apparatus belonging to the Chicago Astronomical Society were permanently remounted in the elegant new Observatory building which stands on the north campus of the university, a monument to the generosity of Hon. James B. Hobbs. This apparatus had been in use by the Chicago University since 1864, but when that institution lost its realty by the foreclosure of a mortgage, the Astronomical Society found it necessary to find new quarters, and the dome on our campus is the result of liberal offers from our university and of a generous gift by Mr. Hobbs.\n\nFrom 1877 to 1882, Mr. S. W. Burnham, now at Lick Observatory, used the great equatorial a portion of the time, for double star observation. During this period he discovered more than four hundred new double stars, and made micrometrical measurements\n\n56\n\nof about thirteen hundred double stars previously known.\n\nSince 1879, the genial and devoted astronomer, Prof. Geo. W. Hough, has been director of the Dearborn Observatory, and the present almost perfect building was constructed under his supervision. His special work with the great equatorial has been a continuous and systematic study of the planet Jupiter, and the observation and discovery of difficult double stars, of which he has discovered about three hundred.\n\n57\n\nThe Northwestern Female College and its Evolutions.\n\nThe \"higher education of women\" is now so much a matter of course that when a \"university girl\" leads her class in Greek or mathematics or wins the prize in an oratorical competition it surprises no one; but it was a new idea in 1855. A woman's college course equal to that arranged for young men was unheard-of, except at Oberlin and Antioch, Ohio. Vassar was unknown, and the Harvard annex would have been looked upon as an impiety. The founders of our university, although they were keen-sighted beyond their contemporaries among Chicago's Christian men, had not perceived what Goethe's prescient eye had seen so long before, that \"the ever-feminine draweth on,\" and no provision had been made for women in their far-reaching plans. Even good Mrs. Garrett, while she made mention in her will of doing something for women's education, conditioned this upon a contingency so remote that it is practically certain never to arrive. Yet Evanston was to be the classic suburb of Chicago, the western Athens, with its face to the\n\n58\n\nfuture and its keynote caught by college towns along the opening ways of civilization. How much it meant then, that at the very beginning of the active educational movement here, even on October 29, 1855, the \"Northwestern Female College\" quietly took its place as one among a trio of schools, founded in the name of Christian education, and having the whole northwest as their territory of supply! Evanston has thus been, from its first hour, a paradise for women. Here they began to study Homer and Horace while the Indian's trail was yet visible along the shore; here they wrought out intricate problems in calculus when Greenwood avenue was an unexplored morass. With no forceful business men back of the enterprise; no real estate basis; no distinguished names adorned with \"lunar fardels\" to lend prestige to the movement, it moved all the same; it came, not welcome over-much, and came to stay.\n\nMrs. John L. Beveridge, in a bright reminiscent letter, has mentioned that in 1854 she began to gather a few children in a school, when a young man whom she had met at Rock River Seminary, Mt. Morris, asked her to let him undertake the tiny enterprise, and opened a preparatory department in that room over Colvin's store where the early church assembled; from this nucleus rapidly developed a college for women. This young man's views were met with disgust and scorn by many good, influential and wealthy men. They said that academies and seminaries for girls were very well, but\n\n59\n\nto associate the sacred name of \"college\" with the unscholarly name of woman was to cheapen and degrade an appellation pertaining always and only to institutions for the education of men. Besides, it was a foregone conclusion that girls had not the intellect to grasp live mathematics and dead languages. Had not the young educator been gifted with a rarely resolute and liberal mind, he would not, at twenty-three years of age, have begun speaking herein Illinois, on Sunday evenings, whenever the pastor would permit, upon that unpopular theme, the higher education of women; he would not have gone, as he finally did, before the ever wide-awake Rock River Conference with his plans. Several of the ministers fell in with his views, urged him to \"go up to Evanston,\" and promised influence and pupils. Beyond this he did not ask for aid, believing that while it is desirable to have educational institutions under the patronage of the church, they should be self-supporting. The young man came to Evanston, and was taken by Rev. Philo Judson to see the fine block on Chicago avenue, between Lake and Greenwood streets, which he selected and bought.\n\nWhen the trustees were chosen from Rock River Conference and from good men in Chicago, a difficulty arose as to the selection of a name. Northwestern Female College was the young founder's choice, even he not having then perceived the absurdity of the word \"female\" as involving a generalization whimsically indeterminate.\n\n60\n\nThis young man's name was William P. Jones, and of the three buildings that climbed above the aboriginal groves of Evanston thirty-five years ago, or thereabouts, the most expensive and ambitious was the one built by him. He had no money, but his generous brother, Col. J. Wesley Jones, who loved and believed in this courageous educational pioneer with a chivalric devotion beautiful to see, came to the front with the necessary funds. Bishop Simpson, a lifelong friend of the young founder, and a noted champion of women's rights, dedicated the \"Female College.\" Special trains were run from Chicago to the new village on this occasion, three hundred friends of the infant enterprise thus testifying their faith in its success, — among them John L. Scripps, then editor of the Chicago Tribune, Chas. L. Wilson, of the Chicago Journal, many pastors, and earnest-hearted women not a few. This was on December 20, 1855, several months after the school began.\n\nOne year from the day of moving into the new college came the burning of the building, caused by defective heating apparatus. The insurance also was lost, as repairs on the furnace had been made only a week before, and the insurance companies were not satisfied in regard to them. To add to these troubles, Professor Jones was taken violently ill with inflammatory rheumatism caused by exposure in his heroic efforts to save the building. The school continued, however, temporary rooms having been kindly offered\n\n61\n\nby the university professors, and the teachers cheerfully doing additional work. When the term closed, the \"Buckeye,\" a tavern building on the ridge, was secured, where the pupils boarded, and the school was opened February 25, 1857.\n\nOn the first of May Professor Jones went to Chicago for the first time after his long illness to engage materials for the new building. He was thin and pale, but full of enthusiasm and hope. Two weeks after the fire, a committee had waited upon him, bringing a proposition to start another college on the ridge, but it was a movement not in reality friendly to him. They said: \"You are very ill. It is probable you can not live. You have lost everything in the fire. Your plans must be given up.\" He replied: \"It is true I may die, but I do not expect to; I fully intend to rebuild, and I will not give up my plans.\" He then sent for his brother Wesley, who went immediately to Springfield and secured a charter from the legislature then in session. The other scheme was abandoned, and the \"old original\" college went on, its founder and his friends working with so much vigor that he moved into the second building, five stories high and fitted up as both home and college for the pupils, nine months after the first one burned. The term opened with a large attendance, in September, 1857, and the\n\n62\n\nenterprise continually prospered. In the winter of 1862 came a second attack of inflammatory rheumatism, involving the heart, and Professor Jones was ordered abroad for a year. Then came the same good brother to his aid, and, through influential friends, secured for him from President Lincoln the appointment of consul to Macao, China. Thither he sailed, with his wife and two babies, October 25, 1862.\n\nDuring the interregnum Mrs. Lizzie Mace McFarland became lady principal of the Female College. Miss Luella Clark was teacher of \"Belles-lettres,\" and I led the young women in what Oliver Wendell Holmes calls \"barn door flights\" of natural science, while Rev. and Mrs. Jones, parents of the college proprietor, conducted home affairs. After two years Rev. Dr. L. H. Bugbee came, in 1865, and was president until 1868; building up the institution into prominence and power.\n\nIn 1868 Professor Jones returned, and continued at the helm until 1871, having with him as associate principal and acting president, Prof. A. F. Nightingale, an educator of the first rank, under whom the institution went prosperously forward.\n\nBut, meanwhile, the arrest of thought had come to many women's minds in Evanston. They knew that Mrs. Eliza Garrett had hoped the fortune left by her might some day warrant the founding of a college for women; they knew this was not likely to occur, as the theological school rightly demanded all the\n\n63\n\nmoney given by that elect lady of Methodism, and needed much more. Their work in building Heck Hall had given them knowledge of their own powers, and Mrs. Mary F. Haskin, always one of our most public-spirited women, was led to speak out the purpose she had long cherished: \"The next work of this kind that we do will be for girls.\" She did not fail to recognize the invaluable pioneer work done by Professor Jones, but felt that no private enterprise could measure up to the occasion. Mrs. Haskin went first to Mrs. Bishop Hamline, of blessed memory, who pledged her interest and co-operation. Rev. Dr. Bannister, president of the Board of Trustees of the Northwestern Female College, was the next one visited, and he said in his hearty tones, \"It is just the thing to do.\" So a meeting was called in September, 1868. Mrs. Hamline presided, and an \"Educational Association\" was formed, of which Mrs. Haskin was made president. In 1869 this society petitioned the town authorities to set apart as a site for the new college one of the chief parks of Evanston, which was generously done by the village board. A charter granting the power of conferring diplomas and degrees was secured from the legislature in 1869 through the efforts of Hon. Edward S. Taylor, and fifteen ladies were chosen trustees.\n\n64\n\nOn Feb. 13, 1870, (soon after my return from two years and a half of foreign study and travel), I was elected president of the new college, for these women had the courage of their convictions and believed a woman had as good right to be president as they had to be trustees of an educational institution of high grade. Its name was \"Evanston College for Ladies,\" and through the influence of Rev. Dr. Haven, the new president of the university, Professor Jones consented to merge the old school in the new, surrendering his charter to the ladies' board, who in return agreed to perpetuate the history of the Northwestern Female College, and to adopt its alumnae as their own. On the day of the 16th annual commencement (June, 1870), the work of the old college ended and the transfer was completed. The new college was opened with 236 pupils, in the buildings of the old, in September, 1871. On June 3d of that year the ground was broken for the Evanston College for Ladies, and on \"the women's Fourth of July\" its corner stone was laid. That \"Fourth\" was one of the most memorable days in the annals of our village. Ten thousand persons came up from the city to witness the Zouave drill, regatta, base-ball match, and other entertainments provided by the ladies, also to hear the address of United States Senator Doolittle, and witness the laying of the corner stone. About thirty thousand dollars were subscribed that day, Governor Evans, who had\n\n65\n\ncome from Colorado, leading off with a gift of ten thousand dollars. Rev. Obadiah Huse and L. L. Greenleaf had already subscribed like sums. But on October 9, 1871, the greatest fire of modern times devastated Chicago, and shriveled the subscriptions of Chicago men. Still the college went on, a self-supporting institution, in the old buildings, established its own departments, of art, of music, a preparatory school, and adopted a Kindergarten founded by Edward Eggleston during his sojourn in Evanston. From the first the older students of the college paid tuition and recited in the university, which, since 1869, has been open to women, Dr. Haven making this a condition of accepting the call to become its president.\n\nIn 1872 the first and only commencement exercises were held in the M. E. church, and diplomas given to a graduating class of six; and the degree of A. M. was bestowed on Mrs. J. F. Willing.\n\nJune 25, 1873, by an agreement between the two boards of trustees, the Evanston College for Ladies became the Woman's College of Northwestern University; four of its trustees being added to the University board, and its president becoming Dean of the Woman's College. An Aid Association had been organized by the ladies, Rev. Obadiah Huse having suggested the plan and given the first money for carrying it out. College Cottage was built, and is not\n\n66\n\nonly a benevolent but a self-supporting institution, in which some of the best scholars that Evanston has produced have had their home. Dr. D. K. Pearsons and Isaac R. Hitt have helped on this enterprise, and the committee of ladies has had, throughout the years, no more steadfast central figure than Mrs. John A. Pearsons.\n\nThe Conservatory of Music has been, since 1877, under the management of Prof. Oren E. Locke. Previous to his coming it existed chiefly on paper. He established four courses of study for pianists, vocalists, organists and performers on orchestral instruments. The largest number of pupils thus far has been 200, from almost every state in the Union.\n\nThe art school, which also finds its home in the Woman's College, was long under the care of Miss Catharine Beal; but this talented lady has resigned, and Miss Eva Hutchison, who has already made a name for herself, will hereafter be at the head of this important department.\n\nThe following ladies have been deans of the Woman's College: Miss Willard, Miss Ellen M. Soule (now Mrs. Prof. Carhart, of Ann Arbor), Mrs. A. E. Sanford (of Bloomington, Ill.), Miss Jane M. Bancroft (now Mrs. George Robinson, of Detroit), and the present dean, beloved by all her great household of girls, Miss Rena M. Michaels. The number of ladies in the college increases yearly, and at present is about seventy-two.\n\n67\n\nCorporate Records.\n\nAway back in 1850 they had a town hereabouts called \"Ridgeville,\" mustering at the first election, on the second of April in that year, ninety-three votes, Edwin Murphy being the first supervisor. The postoffice of this now mythical center was \"down to Major Mulford's,\" he being also a tavern keeper and justice of the peace. At a special meeting the new city fathers voted down a proposition that one hundred and seventy-five dollars must be raised to meet township expenses that year. Later on they seem to have thought better of it and voted two hundred dollars for general expenses and a survey of the \"Ridge Road.\" The first recorded township assessment was in 1853, at which time its taxable property was estimated at six thousand dollars. We find familiar names on the old tax list: George Huntoon, Eli Gaffield, William Foster, Paul Pratt, Mrs. Pratt, O. A. Crain, Charles Crain, and others. In view of the \"peace and good neighborhood\" for which Evanston has been remarkable, such a form of oath as was required a generation ago strikes us oddly enough:\n\n68\n\n\"Peter Smith, having been elected clerk of the town of Ridgeville, made the following affidavit before E. Bennett, J. P., on the 9th day of April, 1853: ‘I do solemnly swear that I have not fought a duel, nor sent or accepted a challenge to fight a duel, the probable issue of which might have been the death of either party, nor in any manner aided or assisted in such duel, nor been knowingly the bearer of such challenge or acceptance since the adoption of the constitution, . . . nor will I be during my continuance in office; so help me God.’\"\n\nThe village of Evanston, was laid out and platted in the winter of 1853-54, under the superintendence of Rev. Philo Judson, the university agent, who did very effective work in church and state. The plat was dated July 20, 1854, and recorded July 27, 1854. The streets were laid out during the winter and spring, and the agent was authorized to sell lots one-fifth down, and the balance in five annual payments.\n\nOur town of Evanston, as distinct from the village aforesaid, was not organized until 1857. George Reynolds was the first supervisor, holding that office until 1863. He built our first hotel, the Reynolds House, which was to the primitive Evanston what the Avenue House or French House is to the elegant Evanston of to-day. He built \"Swampscot,\" as we used to call it, my own early home that once stood where William Deering's beautiful residence stands now. Edwin Haskin was the next supervisor, George F. Foster, Edward S. Taylor, E. Haskin again, George Reynolds again, Eli Gage, H. A. Grover, H. Humphrey, James Curry, George Huntoon, Jr., Max Hahn\n\n69\n\nand James McMahon having severally filled the office.\n\nBrother J. B. Colvin, who was the first \"storekeeper\" of whom I have cognizance, and whose anything-and-everything shop stood where Garwood's drug store now gleams resplendent, was our first town clerk. The others were J. W. Clough, L. Clifford, Edwin A. Clifford, Captain J. R. Fitch, H. M. Walker, George Ide, and Harry Belden, who is the present incumbent.\n\nNot until December 29, 1863, was the village incorporated. The first trustees were chosen January 6, 1864; Mr. H. B. Hurd, president of the board. Brother John Fussey, the good and quaint-speaking class leader, whom old settlers thought so much of, was commissioner of streets, and reported in the following August the expenditure of ninety-seven dollars and twenty-five cents, the first record of a corporate effort to ameliorate our lot — or lots! The total valuation of property was then one hundred and twenty-five thousand four hundred and eighty dollars. The presidents of the board from that day until the village organization was completed were E. Haskin, J. F. Willard, Eli Gage, E. R. Paul, J. L. Beveridge, H. G. Powers, and C. J. Gilbert.\n\nOur wise men decided to evolute once more, and a village organization was voted April 5, 1873. C. J. Gilbert was made first president, and the other members of the new board were H. G. Powers, Lyman Gage, William Blanchard, Wilson Phelps, and Oliver\n\n70\n\nA. Willard; with Charles K. Bannister, clerk. Other presidents were O. Huse, Dr. N. S. Davis, J. M. Williams, Thomas J. Frost, T. A. Cosgrove, J. J. Parkhurst, C. H. Remy, M. W. Kirk, James Ayars, H. H. C. Miller and Dr. O. H. Mann, the present incumbent of that office. Mr. Miller was the first president elected by the people, the others having been chosen by the members of the board. Mr. Miller served three terms. Page Image\n\n71\n\nOur Public Schools.\n\nIt will doubtless be a matter of surprise to the boys and girls in the Evanston schools of to-day to learn that some of their fathers and mothers took their first steps in knowledge in a cemetery. Long before the town of Evanston was organized, a school had been in operation in an old log schoolhouse which stood on the east side of the Ridge road, as it was then called, and just south of the present Crain Street. This lot, an acre in area, had been deeded to the town by Henry Clark, grandfather of our townsman, F. W. Clark, for the rather incongruous use of educational and burial purposes. As such it was held in trust by the township trustees; and the school treasurer, in addition to paying the teacher's salary, had, as his official business, the further duty of selling lots in the cemetery. This schoolhouse did service for many years. It was not an uncommon thing in wet seasons for children to have to be carried on horseback from the east side of the town to the schoolhouse, as the region lying along Benson and Maple avenues was frequently under water.\n\nSoon after the town of Evanston was projected, about 1855, District No. 1 was organized. As the old\n\n72\n\nlog house fell outside of the district, a new building had to be provided. Accordingly a one-story building was constructed about on the site of J. F. Tait's wagon shop, just beyond the Haven school on Church street. This building still stands, though removed and enlarged. At present it is located on Orrington avenue, just north of the police station, and is occupied by a laundry. It is a pleasant thought, and one that should encourage the promoters of educational facilities among us, that this structure, the first nursery, in our district, of the young plant that has since attained such vigorous growth, has thus never been diverted from its original lofty purpose — that of elevating and purifying the community of Evanston. Our district was growing then as now, and better educational accommodations had to be provided. Accordingly, the Benson avenue building was erected about 1860, was located in the precise geographical center of the district, and in its construction the district first contracted a bonded debt. The building consisted at first of the main upright. Afterwards a wing was added to the rear, and in 1870 the north and south wings were added at an expense of about three thousand seven hundred dollars. During the same year the district bought the lots on which the Hinman avenue building and the north ridge school now stand. Of the buildings originally erected, the north ridge school remains, while the Hinman avenue building was removed in 1881 to make place\n\n73\n\nfor the more commodious structure which now ornaments that lot. The old building after its removal stood on Benson avenue and was used as the Second Baptist church until its destruction by fire on the 14th of September, 1889.\n\nAbout 1879 as more room was needed, some people of the village advocated the plan of building all the schools of the district in one locality. The ground whose purchase was contemplated, is the block just south of the Baptist church, known as the Lakeside property, and formerly a beautiful park, in the midst of which stood the Northwestern Female College. A special election was called for the purpose of deciding the question of purchase. The opponents of the plan carried the day, urging as an objection the danger to children of the west side arising from their crossing the railroad track, and a further objection to buildings of two or more stories, which would have to be erected. Upon the rejection of this plan, almost immediately measures were instituted for the construction of the Hinman avenue and Wesley avenue buildings, which were erected respectively in 1881 and 1882. These buildings are models of convenience and excellence, and will stand for years to come as monuments of the wisdom and good taste of the board under whose direction they were built.\n\nThe Benson avenue building served its day and\n\n74\n\ngeneration well, till the omnivorous railroad forced its removal, and in 1888, our elegant Haven school, a noble building, named after a noble man, was built in the anticipation that it would furnish sufficient room for years to come, but it may be worthy of mention that such has been the phenomenal increase in our school population that our buildings to-day are hardly capable of containing the pupils in actual attendance.\n\nSo much for our buildings. Evanston seems to have furnished little or nothing in the line of anecdote or personal reminiscence among her teachers. Mr. and Mrs. W. L. S. Bayley and Mrs. Wilbur were the most notable, of earlier annals; Frances E. Willard and Mary Bannister Willard, carried on the school in 1862, and Mary E. Willard, of \"Nineteen Beautiful years,\" \"supplied\" for Mrs. Wilbur a few weeks. The names of Jenny L. Wells (now Mrs. Thomas Craven) and Miss Mary Woodford (now Mrs. Merrill) should also be included, with affectionate memory, in the enumeration of Evanston's earlier public school teachers. Among our later principals and superintendents may be mentioned Mr. Hanford, who was shot some years ago in Chicago by Alexander Sullivan. Mr. Charles Raymond was superintendent from 1869 to 1873. He was succeeded by Mr. Otis E. Haven, under whose nine years' administration the schools were brought to their utmost efficiency. Superintendent Haven was a born teacher, and to rare executive ability united an earnestness and\n\n75\n\nconscientiousness which never flagged, and personal qualities which endeared him alike to associates and pupils. The high school was organized by Professor Haven, and, in lieu of other accommodations, was held in Lyons Hall. The high school was a great success, and did very efficient work, maintaining so high a standard as to prepare pupils for many of the Western colleges. Among Professor Haven's associates in this school may be mentioned Professor E. J. James, at present of the University of Pennsylvania, a young man who is rapidly gaining a national reputation as a political economist. On the organization of the Evanston township high school, in 1883, our village high school was merged in that, and thus surrendered up its individual being. The history of our present High School under the efficient management of Professor H. L. Boltwood is too well known to need comment. In 1882 Professor Haven gave up school work to enter upon the study and practice of medicine, which he had long had in contemplation as his life work. He was succeeded by Mr. George S. Baker, under whose supervision there was no lack of earnest work, and during his four years of superintendence our schools enjoyed a period of great prosperity and usefulness. In 1886 Mr. Baker resigned, and took up the practice of law, since which time the superintendence of schools has been in the very efficient hands of Mr. H. H. Kingsley, who is universally esteemed. There are twenty-five teachers in the public schools,\n\n76\n\nall, with the exception of Superintendent Kingsley being ladies. A list of their names will be found in the appendix. The number of pupils in the schools, by the last report, is 1,111, of whom 589 are boys and 522 girls.\n\nAs to the financial management of our schools much might be said both of commendation and otherwise. While there may be no charge of mismanagement, there are certain indications that great lethargy and \"masterly inactivity\" must have prevailed at some time. All the records of the district previous to 1872 were burned in the Chicago fire. Since that time, however, the records have been kept in perfect shape. When the board of education came together in 1879, they found eight thousand dollars in bonds due in 1880. Of these bonds there was no record of when, why, or how they were issued. It was not even known whether or not they were legal. All that could be learned about them was traditional, and the only satisfactory explanation of their existence was that they must have been the old Benson avenue school bonds, issued back in 1860, and that, when they became due in 1870 they were called in and new issue made to cover the old. Their legality, however, was not disputed. Messrs. A. N. Young and Simeon Farwell were then on the board, and it is due to their clear-headed financial management that the matter was promptly and satisfactorily settled. Under the direction of these men a tax of four thousand dollars was\n\n77\n\nspread on the district. As to the other four thousand dollar bonds, arrangements were made with Preston, Kean & Co., to take them up and carry them for one year, Messrs. Young and Farwell giving their personal guarantee to secure the bankers against loss. They made no mistake in their faith in the people of the district, and in 1881 a further tax of four thousand dollars was levied, which wiped out the balance of the debt. Since 1880, the board have displayed great discretion and energy in the management of school matters. There are no bonds on the market that command a higher premium among bankers "
