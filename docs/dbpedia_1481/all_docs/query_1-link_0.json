Oct. 20, 1755, d. Jan. 2, 1846; m. Oct. 25, 1774 at Hebron, Patience Barber, dau. of David Barber and Abigail Newcomb, b. Hebron Apr. 5, 1757. She d. May 14, 1838 (g.s.).\n\nJudge Sylvester Gilbert had 13 children; 10 lived to adult age, and five were born deaf, \"but were sensible and active\". He himself lived to the age of \"90 years, 2 months, and 13 days, retaining his mental faculties in a remarkable degree\", according to a family record which notes that he died \"feeling an assurance that for him 'to die was to gain'\" (compare with the Apostle Paul's words in the Holy Bible).\n\nSylvester married Patience Barber, like himself a native of Hebron, Connecticut, in the fall of 1774. Handwritten marriage records appear to show Patience as a (presumably widowed) \"Mrs.\"; these are errors that evidently originate in the earliest record, which in a scrawled hand appears to incorrectly title Patience and at least one other unmarried woman, Deborah Champion -- bride of Sylvester's brother Samuel -- as \"Mrs.\" Patience Barber bore the name she acquired at birth.\n\nThe brief biography on his FindAGrave page [1] \"U.S. Congressman. He graduated from Dartmouth College New Hampshire, in 1775, studied law, was admitted to the bar in November 1777 and commenced the practice of law in Hebron, Connecticut. He was a member of the Connecticut State House of Representatives, (1780-1812) Connecticut State attorney for Tolland County, (1786-1807), a member of the Connecticut State Senate, (1815-16) and chief judge of the county court (1807-18). In 1818, he was elected as a Republican to the Fifteenth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Uriel Holmes, serving until 1819. After leaving Congress, he resumed the practice of law, was judge of Tolland County, (1820-25) and again a member of the Connecticut State House of Representatives, in 1826.\"\n\nSources\n\nâ†‘ Find A Grave: Memorial #7369025\n\nBirth: \"Connecticut Births and Christenings, 1649-1906,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:F732-HYF : 11 February 2018), Sylvester Gilbert, 20 Oct 1755; citing Hebron, Tolland, Connecticut, United States; FHL microfilm 1,376,165.\n\nMarriage: \"Connecticut Marriages, 1640-1939,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:F7LW-BJ5 : 12 May 2016), Silvester Gilbert and Patience Barber, Marriage 25 Oct 1774, Hebron, Tolland, Connecticut, United States; Connecticut State Library, Hartford; FHL microfilm 1,376,165.\n\nCogswell, William.
