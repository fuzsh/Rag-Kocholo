        "text": "Carol Brach, Emily Gibson, Casey Hayden, Sue Hoidal, Lloyd Hungate, Derek Jones, Diane Knutson, Dina Murphy, Pam Smith - Journalism, Student Health Center, AS Productions, Colleges of Science & Technology, Facilities Management, University Police, Environmental Studies, Financial Aid, University Communications\n\nCarol Brach, Journalism\n\nCarol Brach is the glue that holds the Department of Journalism together. But that has been more the case than ever in the past year and a half as the department has dealt with the declining health and subsequent death of our chair, Shearlean Duke. Carol is dedicated to the faculty and, especially, the students, but her nomination is more fitting this year than ever because of the difficult circumstances she has worked under. Through it all, she has maintained her composure and positive attitude, and that has rubbed off on everyone around her. It comes to this: if Carol be so magnanimous and dedicated at this time, how can the rest of us not be? In short, without her the Department of Journalism would not have been able to function at such a high level during such a difficult time.\n\nEmily Gibson, Student Health Center\n\nDr. Emily Gibson works tirelessly to meet the health care needs of the students of WWU. She is on call every night for student's urgent needs, and she sees patients in clinic during the day, many times overbooking her schedule so that every student gets seen as quickly as possible and receives quality medical care. She also serves on several committees, including the Suicide Prevention Team, keeping our students safe and in school so they can be successful. Dr. Gibson's expertise in mental as well as physical health issues, and her coordination of services with the consulting psychiatric providers and the Counseling Center, helps many students complete their academic coursework successfully. Dr. Gibson is exceptionally supportive and accommodating of the needs of the health center staff members and has fostered a true team spirit in a high-pressure work setting. She makes very hard decisions about staffing, schedule changes, policies and budget, all while trying to balance the needs of the students and the health center with the budget restrictions. She has found innovative ways to use specific staff expertise and creative scheduling to continue to meet the expanding mental and physical health care and education needs of our students.\n\nCasey Hayden, AS Productions\n\nCasey serves as the adviser for AS Productions, which is comprised of six student programming offices including Pop Music, Films, Underground Coffeehouse, Viking Union Gallery, Civil Controversy, and Special Events. During the summer of 2010, Casey went from co-advising the club system to taking on full responsibility for management of the AS club system (which includes more than 200 clubs) and advisement of these clubs and the AS Activities Council. Casey consistently provides high quality advisement to students and provides them the resources and support necessary to help them achieve their goals. He does an excellent job of working with students on both the process of planning and organizing their clubs or events, as well as the intended outcome or product of their efforts. He is adept at working with students on a wide variety of topics and interests, and always keeps a focus on student learning and development at the forefront of his work. Casey has developed very positive and effective working relationships with colleagues, student employees and student club leaders and members. Casey is never hesitant to get his hands dirty and get excited about creative ways of reaching students.\n\nSue Hoidal, Colleges of Science and Technology\n\nIn her role as assistant to the dean of the Colleges of Science and Technology, Sue is continually called upon to be in contact with other departments, divisions and offices throughout the campus, obtaining information, problem solving and most importantly, creating solutions. Her phone does not stop ringing throughout the day, as the go-to person that so many on campus look to for answers and assistance. Sue is gracious, helpful and respectful of everyone she speaks with. She has regular interaction with the department managers in the college, and she sets the bar high in her example of service to the college - but more importantly, she does everything she can to help those around her attain that same level of excellence. Sue has recently been instrumental in facilitating the transition to Millenium with the other department managers. Sue also actively pursues personal interaction through her service as the current president of the PSO and also on the President's Council.\n\nLloyd Hungate, Facilities Management\n\nLloyd Hungate, Facilities Management's academic maintenance supervisor, was assigned the project lead on the recent Old Main flood repairs. He exceptionally stands out for his thoroughness, his always-friendly and helpful approach, his constant smile, and his desire to go above and beyond the call of duty during his leadership and supervision of the recent Old Main repairs after a frozen sprinkler pipe decided it was time to take Western and Facilities Management down yet another emergency rabbit trail. Lloyd worked with many occupants who all noticed the job would get done because someone actually cared for each person's concerns and needs. Lloyd coordinated many unique solutions, difficult scheduling, many different skilled trades and other involved campus departments accomplishing the work considerably ahead of schedule and estimate. Lloyd worried and willed the Old Main repairs to completion, tapping his creative and personal interaction skills and often working many extra hours and impacting his personal life. Old Main, campus and Facilities Management are fortunate to have Lloyd's exceptional attitude, skills and expertise on our side.\n\nDerek Jones, University Police\n\nOfficer Derek Jones is a fairly recent addition to Western's Police Department, but his service and dedication to the university are unparalleled. Derek is one of Western's most proactive officers, constantly seeking opportunities to interact with the public and effect positive change at Western. Derek volunteered last year to be one of two WWU Police representatives on the Bellingham Police SWAT team. The extra time and effort Derek puts into participating as a SWAT officer is something it is hoped the university will never have to call upon. However, if needed, Derek's knowledge of Western and his training as a SWAT officer will surely be invaluable to the entire campus community. Derek is also captaining a team for the 2011 Whatcom County Emergency Responders Fitness Challenge. He cares deeply for everyone he works with. To him, his co-workers are all part of his extended family. Though Derek is young, it's clear to those who know him that he is gifted in many ways. He is the kind of officer Western needs, and the kind of person we all should hope to be. His courage, strength, passion, and humility are what make him a real-life hero.\n\nDiane Knutson, Environmental Studies\n\nEverything Diane does, she takes to a new level compared to how it was done before and constantly challenges herself to do even better. All around she is an excellent performer. Diane uses common courtesies in every interaction. She is poised and pleasant, even when there are tensions. The Department of Environmental Studies has been undergoing a major revision in its curriculum for the past two years. This required the pulling together of a vast amount of information, and requires preparation of the new curriculum and the hundreds of forms that requires. Diane has been the point-person on all of the detail work in this long, laborious and sometimes contentious process. Diane is an incredibly hard and efficient worker, and an unbelievably compassionate and pleasant friend. The Department of Environmental Studies has depended totally on her for a million wonderful things that have made the department's ambitious work possible. She is the sort who goes far beyond the call of duty or job definition. She has worked with faculty and staff wonderfully well, both the few under her supervision, and the many \"above\" her. Along with this task she was also appointed the Secretary of the HCC.\n\nDina Murphy, Financial Aid\n\nFinancial Aid Manager Dina Murphy epitomizes the best of Western through her dedication to students, the care with which she stewards scholarship dollars in accordance with donor wishes, her collaboration with academic and Student Affairs departments to select scholarship recipients, and her leadership in designing and implementing software that will result in more effective delivery of scholarship funding to students. Dina works well beyond 40 hours per week to ensure that Western students receive not only their scholarship funds, but their federal, state and institutional financial aid. Dina serves as the liaison with the College Success Foundation to help ensure that high-achieving, at-risk students receive the funding they need to access higher education at Western. She also provides guidance and support to the state Washboard scholarship program hosted by the State of Washington Higher Education Coordinating Board, has led College Goal Sunday financial aid outreach efforts, and routinely gives financial aid presentations at area high schools. Through Dina's leadership, software to support private donor scholarship processing has been fully implemented within the Scholarship Center. Despite the demands placed on delivering $7.5 million annually in scholarship dollars and resolving the aid-related concerns of students and parents, Dina maintains a positive, can-do attitude and a good sense of humor.\n\nPam Smith, University Communications\n\nWhile she has worked at the Office of University Communications, Pam Smith's strong organizational skills and tireless efforts have greatly increased the effectiveness of the office in getting out the many messages and stories that showcase the excellence at Western. Pam's work is always exceptional. The very busy office deals with offices throughout campus, as well as with the media, students, parents and members of the community, sometimes in stressful, fast-moving situations. Pam represents Western to all these groups with a high degree of courtesy and professionalism, and it is evident in all her interactions that she cares deeply about Western, its students and its mission. In addition, she also regularly volunteers to help with university commencements and helps with the Employee Arts & Crafts Show. Her interaction with students, faculty, staff and the greater community always is superb; she tackles all new projects with a great deal of creativity and initiative and the result of her efforts are outstanding achievements by the entire staff of the Office of University Communications, as well as many others. She makes a difference, every day, in the lives of our students and campus community members.\n\nDerek Bryson, KaSandra Church, Holly Diaz, Julie Larmore, Ron Marks, Elaine Mehary, Karen Peila, Shannon Warren - University Communications and Marketing, Counseling Center, University Residences, Facilities Management, Human Resources, Secondary Education, Communication Sciences and Disorders, SMATE\n\nDerek Bryson, University Communications and Marketing\n\nBeyond the outstanding graphic design work that he produces on quick turnaround, Derek is admired and respected for his gracious demeanor, great sense of humor, and patient partnership in helping stakeholders from all over campus bring their ideas to life. While his plate is always overflowing with new projects, he always makes time to support his co-workers and field new projects with an open mind and heart. Derek makes Western and the University Communications and Marketing team look great!\n\nKaSandra Church, Counseling Center\n\nKaSandra is responsible for developing a systematic approach to suicide prevention and the promotion of emotional wellness on campus. In addition to offering suicide prevention training across campus she more recently began coordinating the efforts of additional trainers to support a zero suicide campus, and created a faculty and staff resource guide that was disseminated across campus in support of students. By encouraging students to coordinate the annual juried Building Resilience and Voicing Empathy art show and the seasonal affective disorder screening day, KaSandra helps students learn about mental health and serve the campus in creative ways.\n\nHolly Diaz, University Residences\n\nHolly is an exceptional role model within Residence Life. In a highly people-oriented unit, Holly is consistently able to bring a refreshing honesty and perspective to her work that pulls people in. She is regularly consulted by University Residence Staff and is always willing to listen and provide helpful feedback. She brings empathy to everything she does and is an example of what it means to be a professional in higher ed.\n\nJulie Larmore, Facilities Management\n\nJulie's contributions to building a better business platform for Facilities Management are truly exceptional. Most recently, she led Facilities Management in the deployment of the AssetWorks database management system, a daunting project with millions of data fields to coordinate. Julie's detailed grasp of the inner-workings of the AiM software and how it interfaces with best practice business processes make her an invaluable asset to her colleagues. With such a volume of information, it is tempting to just say \"good enough,\" but Julie has had the tenacity and forethought to hold the end vision in mind and inspire the rest of the deployment team to do the same.\n\nRon Marks, Human Resources\n\nRon was initially hired to help create an entire training platform for employee professional development. In three short years the program has grown from being an independent training hub to a multi-functional partner for individuals and departments across campus. Ron has gone above and beyond in creating the \"Leader as Coach\" cohort program, and assisting employees with their personal and professional growth. Ron has a passion for organizational development and has become a highly respected partner making a positive impact across the institution.\n\nElaine Mehary, Secondary Education, Education and Social Justice\n\nElaine has transformed the Education and Social Justice minor from an academic program into a thriving home for students and the source of several new initiatives on campus. Her commitment reflects the vast experiential knowledge and wisdom she continues to build and refine in her daily work. Elaine’s position has many complex parts, including academic support to students, connecting students with other support services on campus; coordinating the peer mentoring program; and supporting the recruitment and retention of historically underrepresented students. As a result of her leadership with Justice Speaks, a student-organized forum for exploring topics related to social justice, each event resulted in packed auditoriums, reaching a broad base of participants from Western and the larger community.\n\nKaren Peila, Communication Sciences and Disorders\n\nKaren consistently exceeds expectations overseeing the managerial and operational responsibilities of the Communication Sciences and Disorders department. Karen prepared and proposed a budget that would allow the clinic to shift to a no-fee clinical service provision model, benefiting both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the greater Bellingham community. Karen also supported the development and implementation of the Clinical Doctorate in Audiology, Western’s first doctoral level program, and was indispensable in organizing the Pacific Northwest premier of the film “When I Stutter.”\n\nShannon Warren, SMATE\n\nShannon has been instrumental in assisting over 80 faculty in the College of Science and Engineering and Huxley College in the creation of partnerships between Western, community colleges, K-12 schools, and other community partners around science education reform. In her work within and beyond Western, Shannon is seen as a source of expertise and wisdom, creating an environment where participants feel cared for, appreciated, and understood. A true treasure to Western and well-deserving of recognition for her efforts, passion, and ongoing commitment to improving teaching and learning at Western.\n\nDoug Adelstein, Max Bronsema, Clint Burgess, Clara Capron, Jeanne Gaffney, George Liu, Marcia Merth, Stan Wolf - Human Resources, University Relations & Community Development, Scientific Technical Services, Enrollment & Student Services, Admissions, ATUS , Registrar's Office, Facility Management\n\nDoug Adelstein, Human Resources\n\nAs Associate Director for Human Resources Doug works closely with local union representatives. His outstanding achievement has been his ability to hit the ground running and be a pivotal player in his role as a contract bargaining negotiator and labor relations representative for the university. Doug is admired not only for his professional skills and abilities but also his efficient, thorough, and thoughtful approach. Doug is a very likable, friendly, engaging and caring individual, who has a knack for keeping the big picture in view while respecting individual concerns.\n\nMax Bronsema, University Relations & Community Development\n\nMax and the team he leads in WebTech are the linchpin in the Academic Affairs Drupal websites. He uses innovative tools to provide rapid response to requests for features and improvements. He reaches out to ascertain needs and minimizes downtime on the sites. He has organized a \"Drupal Coffee Hour\" to bring together those using the platform on a regular basis to share best practices and ideas to improve the sites. Max is thoughtful, humble, and good-natured. There is comfort when bringing him questions and challenges; he is genuinely excited to meet the challenges. He is a pleasure to work with, and has been a unifying force in regards to building a community of Drupal users and web developers.\n\nClint Burgess, Scientific Technical Services\n\nClint is “instrumental” in maintaining the wide array of highly sophisticated scientific equipment at the College of Science and Engineering. He’s a reliable colleague and is extremely attentive to the needs of faculty and staff, and directly supports positive outcomes for the many students in lab courses and research labs. All of his excellent work is carried out with respect, attentiveness, and a willingness to go above and beyond. Known as \"Clint the Wizard\" he has a reputation for bringing instruments “back from the dead.” For nearly 30 years Clint’s “can do” attitude” and professionalism has been an invaluable asset to scientific and technical support at Western.\n\nClara Capron, Enrollment & Student Services\n\nSeveral years ago Clara was asked to step out of her comfort zone in Financial Aid, where she had been an excellent administrator for many years, to act as interim Director of Admissions in addition to her financial aid duties. During this challenging time, Clara demonstrated the many fine qualities that make her an exceptional administrator. With dedication, organization, creativity, and just plain hard work, she successfully met each challenge while fostering increased collaboration between Admissions and Financial Aid for the betterment of Western and Western's students. In her relatively new position Clara provides inspiring and skillful leadership over the areas of Admissions, Financial Aid and New Student Services/Family Outreach. Her ability to integrate the strengths and resources from each of these areas has furthered Western's ability to serve the needs of the state of Washington by increasing our capacity to attract and enroll an academically talented and diverse group of students. Under her leadership, Western received a record number of freshman admissions applications for fall 2015.\n\nJeanne Gaffney, Admissions\n\nDespite Jeanne’s impressive workload as Associate Director of Admissions, she never shies away from a request. She keeps her door open and if you stop by her office, she will greet you with a kind \"Come in\", put her project aside, and give you her undivided attention. Jeanne is responsible for overseeing transfer and international recruitment initiatives and related admissions procedures, community college relations, and matriculation and credit acceptance policies. Jeanne was instrumental in changing the transfer application deadline from April 1 to March 1, after noting that Western was losing opportunities to recruit high-achieving transfer students to other universities with earlier transfer deadlines. Jeanne's experience at Western and in higher education, combined with her keen insight, are invaluable assets to the Office of Admissions and Western as a whole.\n\nGeorge Liu, ATUS\n\nRecently assuming the position of Information Technology Specialist Manager for the ATUS computer maintenance office, George has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep everything running smoothly and efficiently. George has a strong work ethic, supports his fellow workers, and is gracious with his colleagues by encouraging self-care. He is an expert technician in all phases, and is an efficient, effective and thoughtful manager who truly wants to make everyone’s job easier to get done. He has the ability to fix small parts that are not available for replacements thereby greatly extending the useful period of a particular piece of equipment.\n\nMarcia Merth, Registrar's Office\n\nMarcia is an integral part of the Registrar's Office, looking at issues from every angle and using her extensive knowledge, experience and sound judgement to contribute to the issue at hand. She has been responsible for the confidential safekeeping and processing of over four and a half million grade records and over a quarter of a million transcript records. She comes in early and stays late during grade week to make sure all the grades get entered and rolled to academic history in a timely manner so degrees can be awarded as soon as possible.

This work upgraded and optimized heating, ventilation, and air conditioning controls. This excellent work cost just under $254,000, took over 2,500 hours of FM’s crew time to complete, resulted in $250,000 in rebates, and has a verified annual utility savings of $30,000 per year. The programming within campus’ control system was highly innovative, beyond anything PSE has seen from any of their customers to date. In fact, the vendor was looking to Western to teach them! FM’s crew innovation went one step further by packaging the control software programming code in templates that can be applied to many other locations across campus for yet more energy savings.\n\nJoe Attolini, Debbi Baughn, Esther Harris, Donna Janigo, Timothy Kraft, Lori Larkin, Paul Madison, Joan Vandersypen, Tim Wynn - Facilities Management, Accounts Payable, College of Humanities & Social Sciences, University Advancement, Communication Sciences & Disorders, Admissions, Athletics, Institute for Watershed Studies, Facilities Management\n\nJoe Attolini, Facilities Management\n\nWherever the job is the toughest or the dirtiest, you’ll find Joe.

As the Program Coordinator in Accounts Payable, Debbi has spearheaded the development of several significant efforts in serving the Campus Community.

Her hard work has provided a means to deliver excellent service and efficiency with minimal impact on an increasingly limited staff through her innovation and knowledge.\n\nEsther Harris, College of Humanities and Social Sciences\n\nMany would agree, there are few individuals who have supported the academic mission of Western with such unflagging energy, keen intelligence, and professional acumen as Esther Harris. As Assistant to the Dean of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Esther supports 15 academic departments working tirelessly with each in providing leadership, support, and direction in significant contribution of the University and College mission. Her prowess has made possible the smooth and strong transition of the new college in its formation, and her outstanding leadership during the recent economic downturn in supporting a diverse array of needs from faculty, staff, and students has made the challenges that face the college, the seeds of her success. Esther demonstrates and models the absolute highest of performance standards, a reason why much of her work has become the process that is adopted across the entire campus. With nearly half of all graduating students and the largest cadre of faculty across numerous disciplines, the demands on the Dean’s office could not be higher. To Esther, this is just another day at the office.\n\nDonna Janigo, University Advancement\n\nIt is impossible to overlook the work of Donna Janigo, or as many of us know her, Data Donna. Donna’s work as Director of Constituent Records in University Advancement makes a significant impact on the quality and operation of the entire division. She sets a high bar for customer service, and meets countless requests for information day after day with a positive attitude and infectious enthusiasm.

His positive spirit in serving as the Biomedical Electronic Technician Lead is both a contagious and remarkable contribution to the success and excitement of working in the department of Communication Sciences and Disorders. Through the years that Tim has been with at Western, he has been a major contributor in placing Western’s program among the best equipped in the nation. Some examples include the implementation of improvements to the closed-circuit TV system, and the successful migration of the clinic into the new AIC space. Through Tim’s expertise the potential for constant improvement and upgrades have been limitless and made the Clinic and the department more effective in teaching and serving the community. Tim’s ability to troubleshoot and problem-solve allow for a superior system at a considerable cost savings. Tim exemplifies what it means to create excellence through engagement of the students, faculty, and the staff around him in the interest of supporting both education and client service.\n\nLori Larkin, Admissions\n\nIn many ways, the Office of Admissions often stands on Lori Larkin’s shoulders. Particularly in this year of tremendous staff turnover; her efforts as an Information Technology Specialist have been an instrumental part of the success of the Admissions office. Lori takes tremendous pride in her work. She is always assisting in the completion of projects, finding answers, or brainstorming on what changes could be made for improvement. Her role as leader and mentor in the office with new staff is tremendous and raises the level of success of the office, and their careers. She is peerless in her ability to work with both students and permanent employees, and she bridges effectively scholarship-related efforts with Financial Aid, the Western Foundation, and Student Accounts, not to mention the dozens of students and parents she talks with throughout the scholarship awarding process.\n\nPaul Madison, Athletics\n\nPaul Madison is a Viking’s Viking. For over 40 years of service as the Sports Information Director one thing is certain about Paul: His blood runs blue. Two things to recognize about Paul, first he never stops caring for his students and staff, and he is always striving to tell the Western story. He spends each day scouring a multitude of media sources for both past and present Western student-athletes, always keeping the Athletics connection active for all who participate. Always supportive, always positive, Paul delights in his interaction with students, faculty, staff, and Viking Fans, getting the word out, and preparing each student-athlete and staff member for the rigors of media inquiries and interview requests. Whether it is large scale projects, such as the creation of the highly regarded Athletics website, or departmental leadership and connection to students, Paul is always out front and giving his all to Western and its students.\n\nJoan Vandersypen, Institute for Watershed Studies\n\nJoan on the surface is the laboratory supervisor for the Institute for Watershed Studies, a state-certified water quality testing lab. But in reality, Joan is a scientist, an educator, a supervisor, and a mentor of student research and development all wrapped into one. Whereas, most labs have trained and paid technicians to conduct analysis, Joan spends countless hours training and preparing students to perform their own analyses. This model of student empowerment has provided a huge benefit for student growth and experience, while maintaining a competitive standard of excellence rarely exceeded by other laboratories in the state. The testament of Joan’s success is exemplified in numerous letters of commendation from the Wash. State Dept. of Ecology. With each step, Joan is the primary individual teaching field and lab techniques, quietly and calmly approaching a standard that many could scarcely dream, let alone achieve. Joan has for nearly 20 years consistently served as an exceptional role model for our students. In providing superior training and mentorship whilst never sacrificing consistency and excellence, Joan represents the perfect balance of performance, excellence and scholarship.\n\nTim Wynn, Facilities Management\n\nWith significant funding reductions and marked increases in service requirements, Tim has personified leadership and poise throughout, calmly guiding the Facilities Management department through each challenge strategically to support his staff and the university effectively. Some of the many key initiatives requiring Tim’s participation include: re-engineering of the Capital Planning Process, the Buchanan Towers Addition project, the climate action plan initiative, the opening of the AIC, the new energy risk management committee, and the means to communicate them all through the development of a bi-monthly campus e-newsletter. Each of these initiatives involves complex collaboration with numerous off- and on-campus offices and departments. The only link in common from the above list initiatives is Tim and Facilities Management. To grasp the scope of Tim’s involvement on campus is an exercise in futility, as there is no part of campus he does not touch or influence. With dignity and class, through challenge and hardship upon Western and his Facilities team, Tim has been the example of excellence in the face of difficulty. A true model for our time.\n\nJuliet Barnes, AJ Barse, James Brady, John Dlouhy, Dan Hanley, Ted Pratt, James Suh, Anne Marie Theiler, Samantha Zimmerman - Advanced Materials Science & Engineering Center, ATUS, Facilities Management, University Advancement, SMATE, Student Life, Athletics, Counseling Center, Procurement\n\nJuliet Barnes, Advanced Materials Science & Engineering Center\n\nThe quality of Juliet’s work is exceptional.

These efforts have led to new insights about effective mentoring practices by both teacher mentors and student mentees.

However, his love of Western started much earlier when he became a student in 1981. His love of the University and of students has allowed him to translate even the most difficult situations into a compassionate interaction with human touch and a caring outcome. Walking across Western’s campus with Ted you begin to know why he has trouble making it to meetings on time. He pauses repeatedly to say hello, and is constantly stopped by students, faculty, and staff for a quick hug or to share a word or two. Whether it is walking and talking, time for coffee, or after meetings he always keeps his door and heart open to those around him. Ted has provided leadership in expanding cultural competence with sponsoring speakers to campus and has added assessment and accountability measures for his unit and has shared those resources for the assessment of campus wide equity and inclusion training.

Throughout the process Kate kept plugging away, methodically testing all the changes, and making improvements as required. Kate’s leadership, skills, patience, and troubleshooting abilities have made it possible for the library to function, improve, and serve not only Western but additonal sites throughout Washington and Oregon.
