The 90-year-old spends many of his winter nights calling games for the Ft. Wayne Komets of the East Coast Hockey League and has done so for the past 63 years. His tenure as the voice of the Komets is the second-longest in professional sports history, trailing only Dodger legend Vin Scully.\n\nWallenstein began his broadcasting career with WDMJ-AM in Marquette. In 1950, while attending NMU, he married Muriel (Murph) Chase and the couple celebrated their 65th anniversary on April 6th, 2015. After graduating from NMU in 1953, Wallenstein accepted a job with WOWO-AM to be a staff announcer. The station manager insisted his name was too long for broadcasting, so, while on the air, Robert Wallenstein took Muriel’s maiden name, and the legend of Bob Chase began.\n\nFour months after his hire, Wallenstein was promoted to sports director of WOWO-AM. During his tenure, he called Big Ten football and basketball games, the Indianapolis 500, and a plethora of high school sporting events, along with his regular Komets announcing. He was also the first radio DJ to be aired on the Westinghouse System at WOWO-AM, a revolutionary radio format for the time that introduced DJ’s to the airwaves in an attempt to boost the medium’s popularity during the popularization of television. In 1954, Wallenstein had the call for the Indiana high school state basketball championships in which the Milan Indians, a high school of only 162 students, defeated the heavily favored Muncie Central Bearcats. Milan’s victory was the inspiration for the 1986 film Hoosiers.\n\nOver the course of his tenure, Wallenstein gradually took on more responsibilities with WOWO-AM, including time as the station’s Public Service Director, Assistant Programs Director, and Sales and Marketing Director.\n\nThough he retired from his full-time position in 2009, Wallenstein continues to call Komets games. He is a member of the Indiana Sportswriters and Broadcasters Hall of Fame, Upper Peninsula Sports Hall of Fame, and Indiana Co-celebrity of the year alongside Indiana University’s Men’s Basketball Coach Tom Crean. In 2012, he was awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy for outstanding service to hockey in the United States—one of the most prestigious awards in professional sports.\n\nStephen DesJardins '83\n\nA noted expert in the field of higher education administration, Dr. Deslardin 's research has influenced institutional, state, and national educational policy in an effort to improve the life-chances of our citizenry.\n\nA Marquette native, Stephen DesJardins received his BS in economics at Northern Michigan University in 1983. Following his undergraduate degree, while working as a policy analyst and institutional researcher in Minneapolis, Steve completed his master's and Ph.D. at the University of Minnesota.\n\nIn 1998 he joined the faculty at the University of Iowa. After only three years, Dr. Desjardins was promoted to associate professor with tenure. In 2002, a position opened at the University of Michigan and Steve was able to return to his home state to further his academic career. Last year, he was promoted to full professor at the University of Michigan, the highest faculty rank one can receive from one's institution.\n\nHis areas of expertise include how students make their college choice decisions, student departure from college, the economics of higher education, and quantitative research and evaluation methods used to study higher education issues.\n\nAlthough Dr. DesJardins advocates never underestimating the capabilities of students, his research demonstrates that it is possible to use rather simple concepts from the social sciences to help better understand how and why students choose whether to go to college and whether they will be successful if they do attend.\n\nHe was honored by his academic peers when selected to chair the University of Michigan's Center for the Study of Higher and Postsecondary Education (CSHPE). For more than five decades, the center has been the nation's premier preparation program for higher education leadership and has been consistently ranked No. 1 or 2 by-polls within and outside of education.\n\nThe research methods Dr. DesJardins has developed and applied have changed the way student choice and departure from college research is conducted, thereby leading to interventions that can improve student chances of succeeding in the attainment of a college degree. This research has been widely published and has influenced policymaking at the international, federal, state and institutional levels.\n\nProfessor DesJardins is the rare scholar who has managed to traverse the border between education and economics, to the betterment of both professions. For that accomplishment, his alma mater honors him.\n\nJames \"Brig\" Sorber '86\n\nOne of the original \"two men\" of Two Men And A Truck, James \"Brig\" Sorber started a company with his brother, Jon, a homemade stick figure advertisement and a 1967 pickup truck. The family business has become the nation's largest franchised moving company with over 1,200 trucks.\n\nTwo Men And A Tmck started in the early 1980s as a way for two brothers in high school to earn extra money. With a stick figure logo designed by their mother, Mary Ellen Sheets, the boys began moving customers in the Lansing, Mich. area, never imagining where their after-school business would take them.\n\nAfter the brothers headed north to pursue degrees at Northern Michigan University, Mary Ellen Sheets picked up where her boys left off, purchasing a larger truck and hiring two employees. In 1988, Mary Ellen franchised her business and the first Two Men And A Tmck franchise was awarded to her daughter, Melanie Bergeron.\n\nAfter graduation, Brig and his wife, Francine, whom he met at Northern, operated their own franchise in the U.P., while also selling insurance. In 1996, growth of the family business lured Brig back home to Lansing and he began helping with the first restructuring and franchise development plan.\n\nThe success of Two Men and A Truck is due in large part to the company's family foundation of honesty, trust and hard work. The company's long track record of aggressive growth continues under the family's progressive leadership and keen business strategies.\n\nBrig played a key role in bringing on 152 franchises in 33 states and Canada, as well as Ireland and the United Kingdom. This expansion brought more than $60 million back into the state of Michigan and employed more than 3,500 people nationwide.\n\nIn 2009, Brig became CEO and undertook an aggressive restructuring plan when it became evident that Michigan's recession meant change was needed, successfully turning the company into a smarter, tougher competitor in the moving industry.\n\nWith a strong belief in giving back to the community, Two Men And A Truck has generated nearly $1 million for charities around Lansing, with 10 cents of every move given to the American Cancer Society.\n\nHe holds the 2008 Distinguished Alumnus Award from Okemos Public Schools, an honor he is very proud of having received, being a second-generation graduate of the school district. He also serves on the board of the Michigan Freedom Academy.\n\nLike the company he and his brother founded, Brig is known in the business and the moving industry to be fair, honest and hard working, but as a leader unafraid of change and focused on the future health and welfare of his family's company and its employees, franchise members and customers.\n\nLarry Inman '76\n\nFocused on public service, Larry Inman has served his alma mater and his community for nearly thirty years, Few individuals approach these responsibilities with such enthusiasm and dedication. He understands the importance of giving back and has used the skills he learned at NMU to make a significant impact on the university, the Traverse City region, and the state of Michigan.\n\nLarry graduated from Northwestern Michigan College in 1974 and further pursued his education at Northern Michigan University where he received a bachelor's of science degree in 1976. A lifetime career in banking began in 1979 when he accepted a position as loan adjuster for Empire National Bank. He was quickly and repeatedly promoted and, by 1987, he was a vice president.\n\nHe continued his education on a variety of important banking issues at the Universities of Delaware, Maryland, Oklahoma and Central Michigan. In 2000, Empire National Bank was purchased by Huntington National Bank, and the new owners quickly recognized the value in Lan-y's experience and commitment. He continued with various responsibilities at a high level until retirement in 2007. He retired from Huntington National Bank as Vice President of Commercial Lending,\n\nLarry was not content to limit his success to the banking industry. Since 1993, he has been an elected commissioner for Grand Traverse County. Two Michigan governors have appointed him to boards. He has been Chairman of the state's Community Corrections Board and served as a Northern Michigan University Trustee for five years. Additionally, he has been chairman of the Northwest Michigan Council of Governments, served on the Association of Counties Service Corporation, the Counties Judiciary Committee, the Counties Board of Directors, and the Committee on Juvenile Justice.\n\nOn a national level, he has been chairman of the National Association of Counties Finance and Intergovernmental Affairs Committee, worked on the Counties Homeland Security Task Force, the Counties Justice and Public Safety Committee and the National Association of Counties Board of Directors.\n\nLarry has also been involved with organizations such as United Way, Junior Achievement, the YMCA, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, Country Conservation District Board, Area Agency on Aging, the Veteran's Affairs Board, and his local church, Christ the King.\n\nLarry Inman takes great pride in advocating for his friends, his community, his county, his state, his schools and his profession. And most importantly, as an alumnus ofN01ihern Michigan University, he reflects the values that his alma mater tries to instill in all of its graduates with energy, pride and dedication.\n\nDuane VanDenbusche '59\n\nThe leader of one of the most successful track and cross country programs in the nation, Duane Vandenbusche has distinguished himself as an outstanding and popular history professor, author and conch.\n\nA 1959 graduate of Northern Michigan University, Duane earned his masters and doctorate degrees from Oklahoma State University. In 1962 he accepted a teaching position in the history department at Western State College in Gunnison, Colorado, a position he still holds.\n\nA dedicated coaching career began in 1971 when he became the head coach of the Western track and cross country teams. What that program evolved into is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nDuring a 25-year tenure with the women's cross country team, WSC won one NAJA and three consecutive NCAA National Championships. His women's teams have consistently finished in the top ten in the country at national finals.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Western State men's cross country teams have won seven NCAA National Championships, a national record for most NCAA titles by one school in cross country.\n\nThe list of accolades this coach has garnered is long. His cross country teams-men and women combined-have won 12 national championships; IO competing in the NCAA Division II, two while members of the NCAA. He's coached 51 individual national champions in track and cross country and more than 300 All-Americans.\n\nSeven times he's been named the NCAA-II National Coach of the Year.\n\nA man with three rules for his runners: be a good person, a good student and a good athlete-in that order. A man who's greatest lasting legacy will be the lessons he instilled in young people-lessons that are every bit as relevant outside of the field of competition.\n\nDuring his 40 years of teaching he has found time to author six books and two historical videos. His area of expertise focuses on the history of the West and Colorado. He is a sought-after speaker, making more than 25 presentations a year.\n\nIt is undeniable that he put Western and Gunnison on the map, nationally and internationally, as a mecca for distance runners. A native of Rock, Mich., he was inducted to the Upper Peninsula Sports Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nIt is clear that Duane's accomplishments in the academic, literary and athletic fields make him a deserving recipient of the highest honor awarded to NMU alumni. It is with pride and admiration that his alma mater accords him this honor for his dedication to history and student athletes.\n\nMark Lovell, '77\n\nIn honor of an impressive career as a nationally renowned sports concussion researcher whose work involving the study of neurocognitive effects of sports concussion injuries has earned him the respect and admiration of his colleagues and nationwide professional recognition.\n\nMark Lovell came to Northern Michigan University from Grand Rapids, where he was born and raised. His family often camped in the Upper Peninsula while he was young and it was from those experiences that he developed a love for the area.
