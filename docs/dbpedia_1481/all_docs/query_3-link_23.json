Her recent work examines within group experiences of native and non-native Blacks in higher education as well as issues of campus racial climate. Dr. Fries-Britt is one of the faculty co-leads and authors of the ACE report Speaking Truth and Acting With Integrity Confronting Challenges of Campus Racial Climate.\n\nDr. Fries-Britt’s research has been funded and supported by the Lumina Foundation, National Society of Black Physicists and the National Science Foundation where she is co-principle investigator to examine the academic trajectories of Black transfer engineering students from community colleges. A recipient of numerous awards she was named a 2019-2020 University of Maryland Distinguished Scholar Teacher.\n\nSylvester James Gates\n\nA world-renowned theoretical physicist, Dr. Gates is the Brown Theoretical Physics Center Director and Ford Foundation Physics Professor at Brown University. This follows his appointment as the John S. Toll professor of physics at the University of Maryland, College Park. He has served on national committees including the U.S. Presidential Council of Advisors on Science & Technology (PCAST) and the National Commission on Forensic Science. Throughout his career, he has been an outspoken national advocate for diversity in physics and was cited regarding an amicus brief to the Supreme Court on the value of minorities in physics. Currently Dr. Gates is a Fellow and vice-President of the American Physical Society (APS) also a Fellow and Past-President of the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP).\n\nJedidah Isler\n\nJedidah Isler is currently an Assistant Professor of Physics & Astronomy at Dartmouth College. Dr. Isler was formerly an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at Vanderbilt University and was the first African American woman to receive a PhD in astrophysics from Yale University. She is an award-winning astrophysicist, TED Fellow, and a nationally recognized speaker and advocate for inclusive STEM education. Dr. Isler is also the creator and host of the monthly web series “Vanguard: Conversation with Women of Color in STEM.”\n\nMia Ong\n\nMaria (Mia) Ong, Ph.D., is a Senior Research Scientist at TERC, a science and mathematics education non-profit organization in Cambridge, MA. For over twenty years, she has conducted empirical research focusing on women of color in higher education and careers in STEM and has led the evaluation of several STEM equity and inclusion programs. She specializes in qualitative methods, gender and race/ethnicity issues in STEM, and higher education. Dr. Ong is a former member of the National Science Foundation’s Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering, a Congressionally mandated advisory committee, and she currently serves on the National Academies Committee on Addressing the Underrepresentation of Women of Color in Tech. Prior to her work at TERC, she directed an undergraduate physics program for students of color and women at the University of California at Berkeley; for this work, she co-received a U.S. Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring. Dr. Ong holds a doctorate in Social and Cultural Studies in Education from U.C. Berkeley.\n\nArlisa Richardson\n\nCurrently a faculty member in the physics department at Chandler-Gilbert Community College, Dr. Richardson has had a rich and varied career. She received her physics bachelor’s degree at Grambling State (HBCU), her physics Master’s degree at UT Dallas, a second Master’s degree in materials & engineering, and a PhD in science curriculum, both from the University of Arizona. Dr. Richardson also spent a significant amount of time working as an engineer in private industry before returning to academia. In that time, she has worked with diversity organizations to increase access to science for underrepresented minorities and she is now running as a candidate for the AAPT Board of Directors.\n\nQuinton Williams\n\nProfessor and chair of physics at Howard University, Dr. Williams has a history of leadership in APS, AAPT and AIP diversity efforts. As a former Provost at Jackson State and current physics chair at Howard, he is a staunch advocate for the health and well-being of HBCUs and for their recognition as the leading producers of African American physics bachelor’s degrees. Dr. Williams is a former member of the AIP Governing Board and was a member of the APS and AAPT Joint Task Force on Undergraduate Physics Programs, which recently released their report, Physics 21: Preparing physics students for 21st century careers. Quinton is also a Past-President of the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP).\n\nAIP Project Staff\n\nArlene Modeste Knowles\n\nArlene Modeste Knowles is the American Institute of Physics TEAM UP Project Manager. Ms. Knowles selected and convened the TEAM-UP members to execute their charge and complete this project. Additionally, Ms Knowles co-led initial efforts on the development of the SEA Change Physics and Astronomy Departmental Awards and is the 2020 Chair of the American Association of Physics Teachers Committee on Diversity in Physics (CoDP). Formerly, Ms. Knowles spent more than two decades managing and coordinating diversity programs for the American Physical Society including the now retired, Scholarships for Minority Undergraduate Physics Majors, and the National Mentoring Community, a mentoring program to increase the number of minority physics bachelor’s degrees. She advocated for the creation of the APS ad-hoc Committee on LGBT+ issues and worked with them to elevate the presence of LGBT+ physicists within the APS community and produce the first ever, LGBT Climate in Physics Report. Ms. Knowles also served on the Program Management Team of the multi-million dollar grant-funded, APS Bridge Program, and has been instrumental in establishing and advancing several APS diversity initiatives.\n\nFor more information, contact:\n\nArlene Modeste Knowles\n\n+1 301-209-3164\n\n[email protected]\n\nPhilip “Bo” Hammer\n\nBo Hammer is a Senior Director at the American Institute of Physics (AIP) and the Staff Liaison to the AIP Liaison Committee on Underrepresented Minorities (LCURM). Dr. Hammer, in partnership with LCURM, wrote the proposal to the AIP Board to authorize and fund a national Task Force on the underrepresentation of African Americans in physics & astronomy. Prior to assuming his role at AIP, Dr. Hammer was Associate Executive Officer of the American Association of Physics Teachers and a Vice President at the Franklin Institute Science Museum.
