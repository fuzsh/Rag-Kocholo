In addition to the Commission’s programs and events, such as the MLK Youth Humanitarian Program, the MLK Concert and the Great Day of Service, the Commission is responsible for fundraising, supporting, promoting and coordinating events throughout the Greater Orlando area, primarily occurring around the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday in January. The Commission is led by an executive team and supported by City of Orlando staff.\n\nThe executive team meets year round, and the Commission meets throughout the fall and winter with concentrated times during the weeks before and after the King Holiday (the third Monday in January). Members are expected to attend the Commission meetings and as many of the Holiday weekend events as possible:\n\nto help “spread the word” to their workplaces and other communities.\n\nparticipate in the Mayor’s MLK Humanitarian Award Service which is usually held in February.\n\nThere are six to eight MLK Commission meetings and numerous events during the two weeks before and after the King Holiday. This includes a Great Day of Service (GDOS) on the King Holiday. Meetings are held at Orlando City Hall. The events take place throughout the city.\n\n2024 Commission Roster\n\nKyle Alexandre\n\nOrlando Regional Realtor ® Association\n\nEdwanna Andrews, Ph.D.\n\nUniversity of Central Florida\n\nJosh Bell\n\nMember-At-Large\n\nVicki J.

These workshops focus on our shared humanity with an exploration of race, privilege, religion, gender, sexual orientation, bias, systems of privilege and oppression and practical application.\n\nThrough these dialogues, a sense of honesty, reflection, critical thinking and openness in the community is fostered. These workshops create a safe space for dialogue within our local communities. The Dream Series consist of six highly interactive, multi-media workshops over a selected period, creating sustained dialogue and culture, while building trust and relationships within the community. The workshops are custom tailored to address the concerns of the organization and our Metro Orlando community. The workshops build on each other, to create an integrated series with an end game in mind- a renewed mindset about the value of relationships, community and trust within the local community. Each workshop will be from 6:30 – 8:30 p.m.\n\nView the full list of workshops\n\nThe national holiday commemorating the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. began in 1986. In anticipation of the new holiday, Orlando City Commissioner Mable Butler urged the City of Orlando to formally establish a committee to recognize and honor the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. during the national King Holiday. Mayor Bill Frederick established the Martin Luther King Celebration Day Committee in 1985. Although the city had provided funding for activities, this group was also charged with planning and coordinating holiday activities. The group saw the holiday as an opportunity to bring the community together.\n\nShortly thereafter, the small group was expanded by Mayor Frederick to include appointed members from the public, private and non-profit sectors to fundraise and coordinate celebration and recognition events each January and was renamed the Mayor’s Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday Commission. It is important to note that two community organizations have partnered with the Commission since its inception: the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. and the Southwest Orlando Jaycees.\n\nThe work of the Commission continued to increase under the administration of Mayor Glenda E. Hood. In order to show the importance of the MLK Holiday to the City of Orlando, she initiated the vigil at City Hall and the community candlelight walk to the annual interfaith service. Mayor Hood challenged the Commission each year to reach out to different populations in the community. As a result of her request to reach out to our community’s youth, the Mayor’s MLK Youth Humanitarian Award program began in 2000. One student from each middle and high school in Orange County Public Schools was selected each year because he or she demonstrated specific ideals of Dr. King. This program, which is now a leadership program for OCPS high school students, has grown to be the Commission’s own signature event with nationally-known speakers inspiring the students, families, school personnel, Commission sponsors and guests at the annual award service.\n\nUnder the committed leadership of current Mayor Buddy Dyer, the Commission has evolved from concentrating primarily on holiday events to a year-round commission which focuses on specific aspects of Dr. King’s legacy - service, equality, peace, justice and inclusion for all. A name change as well as a new mission statement came with that expanded focus.\n\nThe name change and expanded mission have resulted in the Commission participating in, supporting and leading community events, such as the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Like Mayor Hood, Mayor Dyer challenges the Commission each year to continue to broaden its outreach into the community each year."
