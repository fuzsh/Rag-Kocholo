        "text": "1. Overview\n\nWhat are Accessory Dwelling Units?\n\nAccessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) are commonly known as:\n\ngarage apartments\n\ngranny flats\n\nin-law suites\n\nADUs are self-contained residential units on the same property as a single-family home, as long as the property meets zoning requirements. ADUs can be:\n\nattached to the main dwelling unit\n\ndetached and be a separate unit\n\na converted garage or above the garage\n\nfully separated units within the main dwelling unit\n\nOther requirements include:\n\nkitchen (or efficiency kitchen)\n\nseparate units without a permitted kitchen will be classified as an addition, not an ADU\n\nbathroom\n\nplace to sleep\n\nseparate entrance from the main property\n\nonly one (1) ADU is allowed per lot\n\nWhy have an Accessory Dwelling Unit?\n\nADUs provide the following benefits:\n\nearn extra income from renting to a tenant\n\nan ADU may be rented via a standard residential lease. Note, short-term rentals under 30 days are restricted\n\nprovide a home for a relative in need of care\n\nprovide housing for relatives or friends\n\nspace for guests\n\nliving quarters for on-site caregivers\n\nincrease home value\n\nThe early design stage is a good time to consider how you might use your ADU in the future. In some cases, how you use your ADU may change based on your needs. For example, you might be building the ADU for rental income today, but it might become a residence for a parent in the future. If your ADU might become a home for someone with mobility challenges in the future, it is typically more economical to incorporate aging in place or universal design standards in the original building design.\n\n2. Find out if you're eligible for an ADU\n\nTo find your eligibility, you can look up your property to ensure it's in the city limits and what are its zoning categories.\n\nUse the Orlando Information Locator to find your property's information\n\nAfter entering your address, on the left-hand side menu look at the first box that says \"Jurisdiction,\" if it says \"City of Orlando,\" you're good to continue\n\nScroll down the left-hand side menu and click on the \"Zoning\" box to view the information\n\nIf your zoning category starts with R-1, R-2, R-3, MXD, O-1, O-2 or PD, you may be eligible for an ADU, depending on your lot size.\n\nYour property must also meet additional standards, which can be found in the city code.\n\nAdditional standards - Chapter 58, Part 3A\n\nBuilding standards - Chapter 14, Sections 14.10 and 14.11 of the City Code and are also found in the Florida Building Code\n\n3. Lot size requirements and allowable ADU size\n\nMinimum ADU size\n\nThe minimum size of your unit depends on the number of people who will live in the ADU. The City of Orlando code does not have a minimum allowable size for ADUs, but does require your lot to be a certain size to meet eligibility. If you are proposing an ADU less than 300 square feet, please review the minimum code standards. See Section 404 of the International Property Maintenance Code for details.\n\nMaximum ADU size\n\nThere are two steps to determine the maximum size of your ADU and whether you meet the minimum lot size requirements to be eligible for an ADU.\n\nStep 1: Check your zoning category's minimum lot size requirement\n\nYour property may be zoned to allow an accessory dwelling unit depending on the zone's minimum lot size requirements. Check the table below to see if your lot meets its zone's minimum lot size.\n\nReminder, you can use the Orlando Information Locator to determine your zoning category, which corresponds with the categories below\n\nZoning Minimum lot size for an ADU\n\nup to 500 sq. ft. * ✝ Minimum lot size for an ADU\n\nup to 1,000 sq. ft. * R-1AA 10,000 15,000 R-1A 7,700 11,550 R-1 6,000 9,000 R-1N 5,500 8,250 R-2A 5,500 ** R-2B 5,000 ** R-3A 5,500 ** R-3B 5,000 ** R-3C 4,500 ** R-3D 4,500 ** MXD-1 5,000 ** MXD-2 4,500 ** O-1 5,500 ** O-2 4,500 **\n\n* All accessory dwelling units must be smaller than the main dwelling. If the lot does not meet the minimum size, check with City Planning staff to see if it is a “legally non-conforming lot of record.” If so, it may be eligible for a variance to allow an ADU.\n\n✝ Historic District: If your property is located within a Historic District (Historic Preservation), your maximum ADU size is 700 square feet. You will need to go through the Major Review process to apply for a Certificate of Appropriateness with the Historic Preservation Board before applying for building permits.\n\n** Must comply with city Tandem Code - Part 3C of Chapter 58.\n\nPlanned Development (PD)\n\nIf your property is zoned PD, please contact the Planning Division to find out if an ADU is permitted on your property.\n\nSoutheast sector\n\nAll residential properties located within the Lake Nona PD are eligible for one (1), 1,000 square foot ADU, regardless of the lot size.\n\nStep 2: Floor Area Ration (FAR)\n\nThe maximum square footage of the house plus the ADU must not exceed 50% of the total square footage of the lot (0.50 FAR). This may further limit the maximum size of the ADU.\n\nExample for a 2,300 square-foot house in a R-2A, 5,500 square-foot lot:\n\nFAR: 5,500 x 0.5 = 2,750 square feet maximum remaining\n\nIf the house is 2,300 square feet, the maximum remaining area is 450 square feet (2,750 - 2300), so that is the maximum ADU size\n\nADUs in the Lake Nona PD are not limited to FAR standards, but they must comply with the Planning Standards.\n\n4. Planning Standards\n\nIn addition to the zoning and lot size, there are additional standards that your property must meet to know if an ADU is possible on your property. Overall standards are provided in Chapter 58, Part 3A.\n\nLocation on the lot\n\nMay be attached to the main house, detached in a separate building or attached to a garage\n\nIf detached, may not be in front of the main house\n\nMust meet zoning district setbacks (see below)\n\nSetbacks\n\nSetbacks are the minimum required distance between the property lines and a structure.\n\nAn ADU that is attached to the main house must meet the principal structure standards in the zoning tables shown in Chapter 58, Part 1B\n\nAn ADU that is in a detached building, including a garage apartment, must meet accessory structure standards in Chapter 58, Part 5A\n\nIn the R-2, R-3, MXD and O zoning districts, any detached ADU more than 500-square-feet must meet tandem single family development standards, and any attached ADU more than 500-square-feet must meet duplex development standards\n\nIf located in a PD based on information provided in the Orlando Information Locator, contact City Planning staff to verify your setbacks\n\nParking\n\nThe main house must have one parking space behind the front yard setback\n\nIf the ADU is larger than 500-square-feet, an additional parking space is required\n\nParking space access and location must meet code requirements according to our Standards for Construction of Driveway Approaches, Section 61.240\n\nImpervious Surface Ratio (ISR)\n\nImpervious surfaces are surfaces that let little to no water seep through into the ground. The Impervious Surface Ratio is the maximum amount of impervious surfaces allowed on a lot (how much can be paved versus how much needs to be grass for water absorption). Buildings, concrete, asphalt, pavers and artificial turf are all considered impervious surfaces.\n\nEach zoning district limits the amount of impervious surface on a lot. Check the tables shown in Chapter 58, Part 1B to find your district’s limit.\n\nImpervious Surface Ratio = Impervious Surface Area / Lot Area.\n\nDistance from waterbodies\n\nIf you own a property that abuts a body of water, a surveyor must provide a survey that includes that body of water’s average water line.\n\nDetached ADUs must be located at minimum 15 feet from the normal high-water elevation or wetland boundary and have a maximum height of 12 feet. Attached ADUs must meet the principal structure setback of 50 feet.\n\nAppearance\n\nThe ADU must have the same exterior finish as the main house and must include similar architectural details. This will be reviewed as part of the building permit application. Alternative design may be requested via an Appearance Review Determination before applying for building permits.\n\nIf your ADU is located on a corner lot, an Appearance Review Determination is required before building permits. Email City Planning staff for details: cityplanning@orlando.gov.\n\n5. Building Standards\n\nMinimum building standards are in Chapter 14, Sections 14.10 and 14.11 of the City Code and are also found in the Florida Building Code.\n\nType of structure\n\nAn ADU must be located in a permanent structure built on a permanent foundation and must meet all relevant residential building code requirements\n\nAny structure that meets the city’s definition of a recreational vehicle or a mobile home may not be used as an ADU\n\nKitchen\n\nMust include a kitchen sink with hot and cold running water, food preparation surfaces, food storage areas (shelves, cabinets and/or drawers), stove (portable equipment such as a microwave or hot plate are not sufficient), and refrigerator\n\nBathroom\n\nMust include a sink and tub or shower with hot and cold running water\n\nA toilet with running water\n\nThe room must be at least 30 square feet and include appropriate accessories (towel rod, etc.)\n\nMust have mechanical ventilation or an operable window\n\nHeat and air conditioning\n\nThe ADU must have heating\n\nAir conditioning is not required. However, if air conditioning is not provided, windows must be operable and screened to allow proper ventilation\n\nElectricity\n\nThe ADU must be connected to the electric utility network\n\nSolar power may be used as a secondary supply only\n\nWater supply\n\nIf the main house has a public potable water connection and is served by a public utility, the ADU must be connected to the public utility service\n\nIf the main house has well water, please work with your contractor to determine which health codes apply. It is possible you will be required to connect to a public potable water supply\n\nSanitary sewer (wastewater)\n\nIf the main house has a sanitary sewer connection and is served by a public utility, the ADU must be connected to the public utility service\n\nIf the main house is on a septic system, please work with your contractor to determine which health codes apply. It is possible you will be required to connect to public utilities or replace the septic tank\n\nA properly permitted gray water system may be used only as a secondary option\n\n6. Ownership and Impact Fees\n\nOwnership\n\nThe main house may be owner-occupied or rented to a long-term tenant\n\nThe ADU may be owner-occupied or rented to a long-term tenant\n\nIf you would like to do short-term rental or home sharing, special rules apply, and is not allowed in all situations\n\nThe same person or entity (business, trust, etc.) must own both the main house and the ADU. The ADU cannot be sold to a separate owner\n\nThe lot that the main house and the ADU are located can be split into two separate lots, if the future/resulting lots meet Tandem Single Family Development, Section 58.516\n\nImpact Fees\n\nADUs are subject to transportation and park impact fees. Sewer benefit fees, electric connection fees and water connection fees may also be required\n\nADUs are exempt from school impact fees\n\nImpact fee rates can be found on the Permit Development and Impact Fees page. ADUs are classified as “multifamily”\n\nIf a single-family home already exists on the lot, the lot will get a credit for one single family home, and impact fees will be charged for two multifamily units. This net increase is less than the stand-alone rate\n\nOn a vacant lot where a new single-family home and an ADU are being built at the same time, impact fees will be charged for two multifamily units\n\nQuestions?\n\nPlease refer to our Impact Fees page.\n\nOr contact Nancy Ottini, Impact Fee Manager\n\nEmail: nancy.jurus-ottini@orlando.gov\n\nPhone: 407.246.3529\n\n7. Permitting Process\n\nThe City of Orlando’s Permitting Services is responsible for overseeing residential and commercial permits.\n\nFigure out what permits you need\n\nTo determine which specific permits you will need to apply for, you can use our Digital Permitting Portal which will walk you through the process, step-by-step. This portal guides users through a series of questions about their ADU project and preliminarily identifies and calculates permit costs for your project. To begin, go to the guide and click on \"Residential Portal.\"\n\nFor best results, gather the following information before starting:\n\nGeneral project information\n\nSite improvements\n\nAnticipated electrical upgrades\n\nPlumbing fixtures\n\nCost estimates for such improvements\n\nYou will be able to download and/or save this project on the portal.\n\nVisit the Digital Permitting Portal\n\nOther information for permits and inspections\n\nScheduling an appoint to discuss general permitting questions\n\nApplying for a building permit\n\nPaying for permit fees\n\nSubmitting construction plans\n\nRenewing, extending, closing or withdrawing a permit\n\nChecking the status of your permit\n\nFiling a notice of commencement\n\nScheduling or cancelling an inspection\n\nLinks to other permitting services such as expired permits, contractor changes and more\n\nQuestions?\n\nContact Permitting Services\n\nEmail: digitalpermits@orlando.gov\n\nPhone: 407.246.2271\n\n8. Universal Design\n\nIt is important to consider whether the ADU will be used now – or potentially in the future – as a residence for a family member who has mobility challenges or an aging parent. Individuals with mobility or chronic illnesses may need help with “activities of daily living” such as bathing or dressing – or – “instrumental activities of daily living” such as managing medications or meal preparation. Incorporating “aging in place” or “universal design standards” in the original building design is typically more economical than retrofitting these features into an ADU at a later date.\n\nUniversal Design features\n\nUniversal design features focus on making homes and environments safe, navigable and comfortable for people of all ages and abilities. A search for “home-fit guide” or “universal design” or “aging in place features” will provide an overview of common universal design features, such as:\n\nZero-entry door (no steps to house)\n\nZero-entry shower\n\nNon-slip flooring\n\nLevered handles on doors and faucets\n\nLight switches that are accessible from a wheelchair\n\nGood lighting\n\n9. Do Your Research\n\nBefore getting started with your own ADU, we recommend you conduct your own research to get familiar with the ADU concept and how they are designed and built. Several research steps that may be beneficial are listed below. You are also encouraged to add or modify these steps to fit your needs.\n\nGet basic information\n\nThere is a wealth of information about ADUs on the internet. The nonprofit website aarp.org/adu has helpful links to articles, guides, checklists, videos and photo albums about building ADUs. A web search for \"ABCs of ADUs\" can also provide an overview of what ADUs are and how ADUs expand housing options for people of all ages.\n\nReview basic floor plans\n\nThe internet has plenty of great ADU examples. Some construction companies specialize in ADUs, and many cities throughout the country have adopted “pre-approved” ADU building plans that meet their own city codes and permitting processes. While these plans don't necessarily meet the City of Orlando standards, they can provide visuals and examples of different floor plans, types of ADUs and architecture. An internet search for “cities with pre-approved ADU plans” is a good start to learn more. You can also search for “ADU floor plan”, “ADU 500 square feet” or even “ADU ideas” for inspiration.\n\nConsider visiting local furniture stores\n\nLook for opportunities to see how professionals stage small apartments and spaces. One place to visit is local furniture stores that often have “room displays” that depict how their furniture can be configured in smaller spaces.\n\n10. Discover More About ADUs\n\nBenefits of supportive housing for a family member\n\nADUs are a solution to families who wish to care for their aging parents or relatives with physical or cognitive health issues. This proximity to family provides caregivers with a sense of security and the ability to provide accessible care, while at the same time providing a sense of independence for the family member. This multigenerational approach may replace or delay the need for more structured assistive residential options such as assisted living or skilled nursing facility.\n\nEmotional benefits\n\nSeparate living space\n\nQuality of life / sense of independence\n\nSense of security\n\nHealth benefits\n\nPhysical activity\n\nMental health\n\nAccess to health care\n\nSocial benefits\n\nClose to family / social interaction\n\nIntergenerational relationships\n\nFinancial considerations\n\nFamilies that are considering building an ADU to provide supportive housing for a family member that can no longer live safely alone, should conduct a “cost analysis” that compares the cost of building an ADU with the cost of an assisted living or nursing home. Considerations should include ADU construction costs, on-going ADU costs such as homeowners insurance and increase in property maintenance, and the reoccurring cost of either an assisted living facility or nursing home.\n\nADU costs to consider\n\nConstruction costs (one-time allocations) – Each ADU has different line-item costs that will vary based on the property characteristics, type of ADU being constructed and more. However, an internet search for “complete ADU development cost breakdown” can provide a list of typical items that should be factored into your cost estimates for building an ADU.\n\nADU design and planning costs (i.e., architectural drawings, engineering calculations, energy calculations, land surveys)\n\nCity fees association with construction (i.e., plan reviews, utility fees, building fees and impact fees)\n\nLabor and material costs (for interior and exterior)\n\nAppliances and furniture costs\n\nLandscaping costs\n\nOn-going costs\n\nProperty taxes\n\nHomeowners insurance\n\nUtility costs\n\nMaintenance costs\n\nAverage costs for other residential care options\n\nAn internet search for “annual cost of care survey” should provide an estimate for reoccurring costs associated with an assisted living facility or skilled nursing facility. Note: Some care comparisons for assisted living facilities may not factor in costs associated with higher levels of care\n\nAnnual cost of a skilled nursing home or assisted living facility\n\nAdditional level of care costs\n\n11.
