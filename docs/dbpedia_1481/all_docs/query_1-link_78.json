        "text": "Saving Winter: New Hampshire Skiing in the Era of Climate Change\n\nIn New Hampshire, the winter ski industry provides roughly 10,000 jobs, $500 million in yearly economic output, and forms an unmistakable part of the state's identity. Researchers estimate a loss of over $50 million in yearly revenue during recent lower-snow winters. Due to climate change, winters are warming and snowfall is decreasing in NH, portending more such winters to come. If climate change continues as usual without major actions to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, the state is projected to see roughly 40 percent less snowfall, 60 percent fewer days of deep snow cover, and a 20 to 50 percent reduction in days cold enough for ski areas to make snow by the end of the century.\n\nThis exhibit and accompanying article series look at what warming winters mean for NH's culture, economy, and environment, and particularly at how skiers and the ski industry are responding to the changing climate. Learn more by following the links below to read the accompanying articles.\n\nCase 2: A Century of Skiing in New Hampshire\n\nCase 3: Snowmaking is a Matter of Survival for Southern New Hampshire Ski Areas\n\nCase 4: Variable Weather and Low Snowfall Force Nordic Skiers onto Shorter Trails\n\nCase 5: When Natural Snow is Hard to Find, Uphill Skiing Moves to Resorts\n\nCase 6: Two Futures for New Hampshire Climate and Skiing\n\nExhibit curated and written by Bea Burack '25; designed by Dennis Grady.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Reiss Hall, March 10 – June 1, 2024\n\nAnimal Architecture\n\nBecause animal architecture changes the world, it may have far-reaching impacts on social life and collective behavior, transforming whole ecosystems, modifying interactions among communities of species, and even fundamentally altering the course of evolution. Lastly, animal architecture is not only a fascinating topic for scientific inquiry: it can also be considered a work of art made by nature.\n\nExhibit curated and written by Mark Laidre, Department of Biological Sciences; designed by Dennis Grady.\n\nRead about Mark's research and the exhibit on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences news page: Coconut Crabs And Other 'Animal Architects'.\n\n\"Animal Architecture\" illustration created by Bella Li.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street, February 5 – March 29, 2024\n\nThe White Mountains from a Hiker's Point of View\n\nEvery year, thousands of hikers hike on more than 500 trails that cover over 1,400 miles in the White Mountains. As the tallest mountains in New England, the White Mountains have long appealed to people, from the Paleoindians and Abenaki who lived in the fertile mountain valleys long before Europeans arrived, to the farmers, tourists, hoteliers, and lumbermen of the 19th and 20th centuries. The rich ecological history is equally matched by the rich human history.\n\nNo longer the wild, untamed wilderness that attracted artists and tourists in the 19th century, the White Mountains are now surrounded by civilization. Roads are never very far from the hikers on White Mountains trails. Yet, within 20 minutes of hiking, the sounds of cars give way to the rustling of trees in the wind and the crunch of boots on the trail. This combination of proximity and remoteness makes hiking in the White Mountains an experience accessible to millions of people within a day's drive of the region.\n\nMany hikers focus on the crown jewels of the Whites, such as the Presidential Range, known for its above-treeline hiking and striking views. Still, other hikers seek the solitude of the more remote mountains, while a few hardy souls forgo trails altogether to bushwhack wherever they please. This diversity in pursuits highlights the allure of the White Mountains, offering something for every hiker.\n\nThe White Mountains offer a landscape of wilderness and civilization, adventure and connection to the vast tapestry of time. These are the White Mountains from a hiker's point of view.\n\nExhibit curated by Daniel Abosso, Research & Learning Librarian for Humanities and Social Sciences; designed by Dennis Grady.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Reiss Hall, September 4 – December 1, 2023\n\nFaded Glory: The Decline in American Exceptionalism\n\n\"Faded Glory\" presents metaphorical photographs that reflect the many issues integral now to American society, with a gradual decline in its exceptionalism. In their subtlety and pervasiveness, these images serve as a call to awareness and action, not to rebuild an empire or recover world power supremacy but to build a better, stronger, and more enduring democracy for all of its citizens.\n\nPhotographs and text by Julian Fisher. Exhibit design by Dennis Grady.\n\nJulian Fisher studied with Walker Evans as part of his American Studies major at Yale, photographed for the Yale Daily News, and freelanced while at Yale and after for the New York Times, Time, Newsweek, Life, and The Atlantic.\n\nHe pursued a medical degree at Johns Hopkins, becoming a pediatrician and neurologist on the Harvard medical faculty. He returned to photojournalism to produce the projects \"Trapped in the Middle: The Effect of Income Inequality on the Middle Class in America\" (2014-2016) and \"Faded Glory: The Decline of American Exceptionalism\" (2020-2022). The projects have toured nationwide to major higher educational institutions, serving as the centerpiece for coursework, panel discussions, and student projects.\n\nHe lives and works in Brookline, MA.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street, September 8 – December 1, 2023\n\nCHILE 1973–2023: Between the Pinochet Machine & Thousands of Imagined Nations\n\n\"Between the Pinochet Machine and Thousands of Imagined Nations\" is an invitation to explore the 50th anniversary of the Chilean coup d'état and its consequences for contemporary politics and culture in Chile and the Americas.\n\nThe first banner offers a brief perspective on Salvador Allende's Government (1970-1973) and the Military Regime (1973-1990), emphasizing the popular engagement in the first case and the human rights violations in the second.\n\nThe second banner displays an artistic intervention created by Elías Adasme in 1979-80, titled Corporal Intervention in a Private Space.\n\nThe third banner jumps into contemporary issues of the Chilean experience, particularly the recent massive manifestations and conflicts known as \"Estallido Social.\" This recent disruption is understood as part of a citizen reaction against the legacies of the \"Pinochet Machine\" and in search of \"thousands of imagined nations\": indigenous rights, feminist protests against inequality and violence, demands for social justice, public and free education, defense of the environment and ecology policies, reform of the pension system, and access to health are some of the issues at stake.\n\nThe name of this exhibition is inspired by Diamela Eltit's essay La máquina Pinochet and Patrício Guzmán's movie Mi país imaginario.\n\nExhibit curated by Mauricio Acuña, Mellon Faculty Fellow of Spanish and Portuguese, and Jill E. Baron, Research & Learning Librarian for Humanities & Social Sciences. Designed by Dennis Grady.\n\nWe are thankful to the people in Chile, Brazil, and the Dartmouth community who supported this initiative.\n\nTo learn more about this period in Chile’s history, please refer to our research guide for books, articles, and films at dartgo.org/chile.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Brickway Gallery, September 1 – 30, 2023\n\nUkrainian Folk Art Traditions\n\nTranscribing Through Centuries the Code of National Identity\n\nThrough its folk art traditions, Ukrainian identity has been carefully preserved and encoded, often secretly, into symbolic messages which you are about to discover and experience.\n\nDifferent regions of Ukraine are known for their signature styles and designs, each connected to their unique natural environment. The works on display include decorative painting, embroidery, egg decorating (pysanky), ceramics, woodworking, and weaving.\n\nLook closer, folk art is rich in symbolism: crosses mark four corners of the world, the rooster stands for fire and spiritual awakening, and birds represent harmony, happiness, and light.\n\nThis exhibit features selections from the collection of exhibit curators Sophia Sushailo and Maxime Guinel de France. Exhibit designed by Dennis Grady.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street, May 23 – August 10, 2023\n\nThe Student Library Service Bookplate Program: Class of 2023\n\nThe Student Library Service Bookplate Program honors the Library's graduating student employees by inviting them to choose books and other items for the Library's collections. Each item receives a bookplate that acknowledges the student's selection and honors their service to the Library. Students are eligible if they worked at least two terms in any Library department, including the Writing Center (RWIT).\n\nThe Library is honoring forty-four students from the class of 2023 with selections ranging from fiction, non-fiction, poetry, inspirational works, historical scholarship, and favorite reference titles.\n\nExhibit curated and designed by Dennis Grady, Library Teaching & Learning.\n\nMany thanks to the students who volunteered to participate in this exhibit, and to: Richard Langdell, Library Services Specialist; and Lori Heath, Acquisitions Assistant.\n\nPhotography by Khonzumthetho Masuku, Jones Memorial Digital Media Fellow.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Reiss Hall, May 12 – August 10, 2023\n\nErnst Haeckel's Artforms in Nature - A Collections Showcase Exhibit\n\nCurators' Statements:\n\nMy first encounter with Ernst Hæckel's amazing illustrations of single-celled radiolarians was during a YouTube lecture delivered in 2019 by Rupert Sheldrake at the International Conference on the Physics, Chemistry, and Biology of Water, in Bad Soden, Germany. Sheldrake's talk, \"Dynamic Patterns in Water as Analogue Models\" used a page from one of Hæckel's volumes on radiolarians to illustrate the point that \"Biological morphogenesis is very largely vibration-based, electrical or acoustic vibrations; and ... morphogenetic fields are fields of vibration.\"\n\nIntrigued by Hæckel's ornate aesthetic skill, I searched the Dartmouth Library catalog for more. My first find was Hæckel's 1924 edition of Kunstformen der Natur, and my first thought was that these exquisite plates would make a beautiful exhibit in Baker Library's Reiss Hall. It was while designing the exhibit and researching Hæckel that the controversies surrounding his methods, his speculative anthropology, and his influence on the development of 20th-century ideologies came to the fore. So then the question came up: Can we show Hæckel's work and celebrate his aesthetic achievements despite the negatives? My co-curator, Lilly Linden, sought advice from members of Dartmouth's scientific community, and we have taken their concerns into account. We present here an opportunity to be amazed by Hæckel's draftsmanship and design while considering the flaws in his methods and the dangers of speculative theory.\n\n—Dennis Grady, Baker-Berry exhibits designer\n\nI had the good fortune of running into Dennis Grady on my first day of work at Dartmouth (Feb 21st, 2022). He mentioned an exhibit about Haeckel's illustrations in the pipeline after he learned of my prior career as a Biologist. Laura Barrett, Dennis, and I touched base and decided that we would reach out to the Ecology, Evolution, Environment and Society (EEES) group at Dartmouth to hear and learn more about Haeckel's influence. While we were aware of some problems around Haeckel's work, none of us realized the true extent of it. With feedback and resources from faculty, postdocs, and graduate students from the Biology and Anthropology departments at Dartmouth, we redesigned the exhibit to bring to the Dartmouth community an exploration of exquisite illustrations from a man who continues to be an integral part of the story of evolutionary biology, albeit colored by his racist ideologies.\n\nWe are repeatedly faced with disappointing instances of discovering problematic ideologies supported by researchers of the past. As a community, we can engage with these tensions to situate the role that such individuals play in our scholarship.\n\n—Lilly Linden, Research and Learning Librarian - STEM\n\nA research guide has been provided to accompany the exhibit. Each panel of the exhibit asks the viewers to reflect on different aspects of Haeckel's work.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Reiss Hall, January 2 – March 14, 2023\n\nWelcome, Dartmouth Class of 2026!\n\nDartmouth Library welcomes the Class of 2026 with an exhibit highlighting Library resources.\n\nVisit the Library's Canvas site for 1st years.\n\nExhibit curated by Yolanda Hood, Laura Barrett, Amelia Looby, and Susan Simon. Designed by Dennis Grady. A-maze-ing logo by Sarah Thompson.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street, August 26 – November 23, 2022\n\nFifty Years of Coeducation @ Dartmouth - Resistance, Persistence, and Empowerment\n\nThis exhibit marks the 50th anniversary of coeducation at Dartmouth, the most momentous change the institution has ever seen in its history. The exhibit explores the lead-up to that decision, the experiences of the first women students at Dartmouth, and the ways campus life and traditions have evolved in the half-century since then. This long and contentious story of coeducation at Dartmouth is told through primary source documents, including photographs, newspaper articles, student performances, flyers, and pamphlets.\n\nPlease visit the digital version of this exhibit, which includes more extensive documentation.\n\nExhibit curated by Peter Carini, College Archivist and Records Manager, and Julia Logan, Assistant Archivist for Acquisitions. Design by Dennis Grady. Digital exhibit by August Guszkowski, Edward Connery Lathem '51 Digital Library Fellow.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Reiss Hall, September 8 – December 5, 2022\n\nBlacks @ Dartmouth, 1828 to 1960 - Celebrating a Legacy on the 50th Anniversary of the Black Alumni of Dartmouth Association\n\nIn the nineteenth century, forty Black men entered Dartmouth to gain a classical education and to learn the practice of medicine. Another 140 followed in the first half of the twentieth century. In their stories, we find early examples of Black Americans’ passion for education. Dartmouth encouraged their aspirations four decades ahead of the other colleges later known as the Ivy League. To credit Dartmouth with having “thrown open its doors to the colored man,” as was once said, would be generous given the small numbers who were able to breach racial barriers and century-long Jim Crow norms. But in its isolation and self-governance, Dartmouth did establish a notable legacy of educating America’s first Black collegians. In this exhibit, we present highlights of their story. A fuller version is available on a companion website.\n\nBe sure to visit the companion exhibition, Finding Community: The Life of Edward Mitchell 1828 in Rauner Special Collections Library's Class of 1965 Galleries from April 8, 2022, until June 17, 2022.\n\nThis exhibit was sponsored by the Class of 1968 and curated by Forrester “Woody” Lee ’68, with assistance from John Pfeiffer ’68, Christian Dawkins ’22, and Eileen Cave ’76. The project was overseen by Jay Satterfield, Head of Special Collections and Laura Barret, Head of Teaching and Learning, with input from Professors Deborah King and Monica Ndounou, and the Black Alumni of Dartmouth Association. Generous donations were received from Natalie Boll and Steve Casey. Exhibit design by Dennis Grady.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Reiss Hall, April 25 – August 16, 2022\n\nThe Student Library Service Bookplate Program: Class of 2022\n\nThe Student Library Service Bookplate Program honors the Library’s graduating student employees by inviting them to choose books and other items for the Library’s collections. Each item receives a bookplate that acknowledges the student’s selection and honors their service to the Library. Students are eligible if they worked at least two terms in any Library department (including RWIT: Dartmouth’s peer writing center).\n\nThe Library is honoring forty-five students from the class of 2022 with selections ranging from fiction, non-fiction, poetry, inspirational works, historical scholarship, and favorite reference titles.\n\nAn online exhibit features the twenty-one students who volunteered to participate in the annual exhibit.\n\nCurated and designed by Dennis Grady.

Wall Street in particular has lost its luster as a destination for smart and ambitious young people. Out of the current confusion of ideals and confounding of career hopes, a calm recognition may yet emerge that productive labor is the foundation of all prosperity.\"\n\n—Matthew B. Crawford, Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry into the Value of Work\n\nThough published in 2009, Crawford's words ring just as true in the winter of 2022. The Montgomery Fellows Program invites you to look at the productive labor of three remarkable craftspeople and discover within their work—and within yourselves—a sense that shaping a world with one's hands brings value and purpose to all our lives.\n\nThis exhibit is offered in conjunction with the Montgomery Fellows Program winter term series, bringing metalsmith and sculptor Marilyn da Silva, ceramicist Diego Romero, and woodworker and furniture maker/designer Michael Hurwitz to Dartmouth for public lectures and interactions with the Hopkins Center Student Workshops.\n\nFor details visit The Montgomery Fellows website.\n\nExhibit curated by Jenny Swanson (director, Dartmouth’s ceramics workshop), Jeff Georgantes (director, Dartmouth’s jewelry workshop), Greg Elder (director, Dartmouth’s woodworking workshop), and Dennis Grady (Baker-Berry Exhibits designer).

The eight leaders featured are scholars, activists, and creatives, who are change agents in every aspect of campus life. They have been steadfast in their commitment to advocating for and uplifting the Black community, and their work has transformed Dartmouth College for all students. These leaders are inspiring examples of Excellence at Dartmouth!\n\nAwo Adu ’22\n\nMiles ‘Mac’ Battle ’21\n\nMarina Cepeda ’21\n\nLaura Logan ’22\n\nMaya Perkins ’20\n\nIan Neville Scott ’24\n\nAna Sumbo ’22\n\nVitallia D.

He became the first professor of modern languages at Harvard and revolutionized the teaching of modern languages and literatures in the United States.\n\nHe traveled extensively in Europe, first in 1815-19 to complete his education, again in the mid-1830s with his wife Anna Eliot Ticknor, and a final trip in the 1850s. Empowered by Anna's considerable fortune, the two traveled in style. They revelled in the history and culture of Europe while being suspicious of the entrenched political and social powers that held sway. They were, after all, Americans, and thoroughly invested in the great experiment of a democratic republic.\n\nPerhaps most famous for authoring the first history of Spanish literature and being one of the original organizers of the Boston Public Library, he, along with Anna, maintained an active literary salon and amassed a phenomenal personal library, a significant portion of which came to the Dartmouth Library in 1946 and is currently housed in Rauner Special Collections Library.\n\nExhibit curated by Humanities and Social Sciences Librarian Daniel Abosso; Jill Baron, Librarian for Romance Languages & Latin American Studies; and Jay Satterfield, Head of Special Collections. Design by Dennis Grady.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Reiss Hall & Berry Main Street, January 15 through April 30, 2021\n\nGobbledygook & Baloney! – The 1984 Democratic Presidential Debate at Dartmouth\n\nIn January 1984, Dartmouth College hosted the first-ever televised presidential primary debate. The eight major Democratic presidential candidates met onstage in Spaulding Auditorium for a free-form debate followed by audience questions. While the debate is remembered for the mutual recriminations of \"Gobbledygook!\" and \"Baloney!\" between Senator John Glenn and Vice President Walter F. Mondale, it also saw the emergence of Reverend Jesse Jackson as a national political figure, made gender an essential consideration for presidential tickets, and inaugurated the Rockefeller Center's role on campus and its place in national civic life and political debate.\n\nSee the online exhibit.\n\nExhibit curated by Research & Learning Librarian J. Wendel Cox and Laura Barrett, Head of Library Teaching & Learning. Design by Dennis Grady, Baker-Berry Exhibits Designer.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Reiss Hall and Berry Main Street: October 1 - December 31, 2020\n\nJohn R. Scotford Jr. '38 – Designer for Dartmouth and Community\n\nJohn R. Scotford Jr. loved his years at Dartmouth, even though the College offered no studio art classes in the 1930s. Always creative, he found outlets during his undergraduate years making posters for Ward's Department Store in Hanover and designing a contest-winning cover for Dart, the college literary magazine.\n\nAfter graduation, John Scotford moved to New York City, studying practical art and design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. The first time he returned to Dartmouth, in 1940, he had won the Winter Carnival poster contest. At the time, Scotford was just starting an advertising career in New York, specializing in book promotions for publishers and book jacket design. Throughout his 16 years in New York, Scotford maintained ties to the College by volunteering on fundraising campaigns. He wanted to use his skills and knowledge to benefit his alma mater. In 1956, he moved back to Hanover with his family to work on the proposed Hopkins Center for the Arts.\n\nThis exhibit celebrates the work of John Scotford Jr. '38 as Designer for Dartmouth and the wider community.\n\nExhibit curated by Martha Scotford, Professor Emerita Graphic Design, North Carolina State University; with help from Dennis Grady (designer), Phyllis Gilbert (photo archivist), Deborah Howe (Collections Conservator), and Lizzie Curran (Assistant Conservator).\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Reiss Hall: January 13 through April 30, 2020\n\nPanel discussion with curator, family and design colleagues Thursday, April 2 at 4:30, followed by a reception at 5:30.\n\nSpecimens: Artist Books and Their Kin from the Dartmouth Collection\n\nOver the years, artists, designers and craftsmen working in the realm of \"book arts\" have influenced each other in many ways—sometimes without knowing. The works in this exhibit, whether called artist books, fine press books, zines, or examples of design bindings, involve an artistic approach to the book as a form and method of conveying beautiful design and/or provocative content and in so doing reveal the book as an art form itself.\n\nThis exhibit presents a range of works from the wonderful collection available for viewing and reading at Dartmouth Library. They can be found in Rauner Special Collections, Sherman Art Library's Special Collections as well as in the open stacks. We've included the call numbers and other information to help you find these books and others like them. Hopefully, you too will be inspired by these books to learn more and maybe even make one!\n\nSpecimens was curated by Sarah Smith, Book Arts Workshop Program Manager. Graphic design by Dennis Grady.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street: January 8 through March 20, 2020\n\nPoster image: David Stairs, Boundless. Hand-made spiral-bound book, 1983. Available in Sherman Art Library: Art Special N 7433.4 S734 1983.\n\nStudent Library Service Bookplate Program, Dartmouth Class of 2020\n\nThe Student Library Service Bookplate program honors the Library's graduating student employees by inviting them to choose books and other items for the Library's collections. Each item receives a bookplate that acknowledges the student's selection and honors their service to the Library. Students are eligible if they worked at least two terms in any Library department (including RWIT, The Student Center for Research, Writing and Information Technology). The Library is honoring over fifty students from the class of 2020 with selections ranging from fiction, non-fiction, poetry, inspirational works, historical scholarship, and favorite reference titles.\n\nBecause of the Covid-19 pandemic this year, the Student Bookplate exhibit was moved to online only.\n\nThis year's participants and selections were:\n\nSirey Zhang: AIDS and Accusation, by Paul Farmer\n\nAdeline Hope Braverman: Altered States of Consciousness, by Charles Tart\n\nEric Maxwell Plaut: Talking to Strangers, by Malcolm Gladwell\n\nNorette Ingabire: Still Standing - Conversations with Antoine Kaburahe, by Pierre-Claver Mbonimpa\n\nSophia Kinne: The Kilroys List: 97 Monologues and Scenes by Female and Trans Playwrights, by The Kilroys\n\nBetty Junghyun Kim: Make a Zine: Start Your Own Underground Publishing Revolution, by Joel Biel\n\nEmma Rodriguez: Know My Name - A Memoir, by Chanel Miller\n\nExhibit curated and designed by Dennis Grady.\n\nSee the online exhibit.\n\nAdventuresome Spirit\n\nHow do you experience adventure at Dartmouth? You may be weathering the long winter months in a frozen land far from home or boldly braving new mental shores in the classroom. Perhaps you are revolutionizing science, medicine, sports, or society for generations to come. The truth is, there is no single Dartmouth adventure. We all experience moments of courage and bravery differently. However, the individual adventures culminate here, at our college—a place for adventuresome spirits. In this exhibit, we offer a small sampling of individuals and groups who have helped to shape the adventuresome spirit at Dartmouth—through innovation, service, teaching, athleticism, exploration, and leadership.\n\n“Outsiders who hire Dartmouth graduates say things like, ‘You’re great team players…you play well in the sandbox, you have great ideas, you’re fearless in how you approach things, you’re curious, you’re tenacious.’ The shorthand became ‘adventuresome spirit.’” (Laurel Richie '81)\n\nFourth in a series of exhibits celebrating Dartmouth’s 250th year. The Library will be offering several related projects throughout 2019, as well as an online version of each exhibit in the series.\n\nAdventuresome Spirit was curated by Amy Witzel, Humanities and Social Sciences Librarian, and Joshua Dacey, Teaching & Learning Program Assistant; designed by Dennis Grady.\n\nReiss Hall, Baker Library: October 16 through December 18, 2019\n\nGenerations of Community\n\nDartmouth can be envisioned as a universe of communities. There is the singular community of everyone who has ever been involved with Dartmouth. There are also many communities that have existed within this universe across the College’s history, and they are the focus of this exhibit. Generations of Community explores the ways in which fellowship has and has not been manifest throughout the history of the College. How have people at Dartmouth connected with each other? Where do they find meaningful communities? What does the concept of fellowship mean across different facets of campus (and post-campus) life? In what ways have communities at Dartmouth been inclusive, and in what ways have they been exclusive?\n\nThird in a series of exhibits celebrating Dartmouth’s 250th year. The Library will be offering several related projects throughout 2019, as well as an online version of each exhibit in the series.\n\nGenerations of Community was curated by Katie Harding, Teaching and Learning Librarian, and Shaun Akhtar, Metadata Librarian, Strategy and Management; designed by Dennis Grady.\n\nReiss Hall, Baker Library: July 3 - September 18, 2019\n\nCurriculum Vitae\n\nFor many, “liberal arts” denotes college majors that are not science, math, or business. But this definition is a relatively modern one. The phrase initially meant “the kind of studies worthy of a free man.” The idea of the liberal arts is an ancient one that was centered on Latin grammar, logic, and rhetoric. At their highest expression in the Middle Ages, the liberal arts had grown to include arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. In the Renaissance, men of letters re(de)fined liberal arts as the languages and literature of Greece and Rome, and dropped logic in favor of ethics. The liberal arts had assumed a form familiar to us today.\n\nLatin for “a course of life,” a curriculum vitae can be a written summary of past accomplishments, but it can also be understood as the arc of experience that runs through our lives. In this exhibit, we invite you to reflect on the course of the liberal arts throughout the life of Dartmouth College.\n\nSecond in a series of exhibits celebrating Dartmouth’s 250th year. The Library will be offering several related projects throughout 2019, as well as an online version of each exhibit in the series.\n\nCurriculum Vitae was curated by Daniel Abosso, Classics & German Librarian, and Wendel Cox, Humanities & Social Sciences Librarian; designed by Dennis Grady.\n\nBaker Main Hall: April 3 - June 19, 2019\n\nOn Solid Ground\n\nDartmouth seems so grounded in space, especially to a student here for four years seeing little change and plenty of indicators of stability. There is a sense of something solid, not static so much as stable. Old buildings and history around every corner create a sense that things don’t change, but that is far from the reality. Looked at over 250 years, the social, physical, and intellectual space is ever shifting. It welcomes some and excludes others. It creates security but also poses threats. It is bucolic, yet cosmopolitan. It is stable, but ever in flux.\n\nThere is something odd about a college campus with so few maps and signs scattered among the buildings. It assumes a sense of community, but it can also systematically exclude those outside of the community. This exhibit strives to provide a kind of map of campus—one that shows the spaces that make up Dartmouth, but one that also shakes the illusion of stability and questions who and how these spaces serve.\n\nFirst in a series of exhibits celebrating Dartmouth’s 250th year. The Library will be offering several related projects throughout 2019, as well as an online version of each exhibit in the series.\n\nOn Solid Ground was curated by Jay Satterfield, Head of Special Collections, and Peter Carini, College Archivist; designed by Dennis Grady. Thanks to Laura Barrett and Joshua Dacey for editorial assistance, and to Deborah Howe and Lizzie Curran for installation support.\n\nBaker Main Hall: January 2 - March 20, 2019\n\nEAT, DRINK, JAPAN- The Complex World of Japanese Food Culture\n\nProduced in conjunction with the Fall 2019 course “Eat, Drink, Japan,” this exhibition explores the history of food and beverage in Japan from multiple perspectives, including history, culture, contemporary politics, and society. From production and consumption to religious and artistic representations, food has been an essential ingredient in the construction of cultural identities in Japan. Within each panel, you will find tantalizing morsels of history, politics, literature, and art all related to Japanese food culture.\n\nPlease enjoy! 召し上がれ (meshiagare!)\n\nExhibit curated by Steven Ericson, Associate Professor of History, and Dennis Grady, Baker-Berry Library Exhibits Designer, with thanks to Joshua Dacey for editorial help, to Peter and Susan Grilli for lending physical items, to Professors Sachi Schmitt-Hori and Yusaku Horiuchi for providing text, and to Evan Ericson for creating the course poster.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street: Fall Term, 2019\n\nStudent Library Service Bookplate Program, Dartmouth Class of 2019\n\nThe Student Library Service Bookplate Program honors the Library’s graduating student employees by inviting them to choose books and other items for the Library’s collections. Each item will receive a bookplate that acknowledges the student’s selection and honors his or her service to the Library. Students are eligible if they worked at least two terms in any Library department (including RWIT, The Student Center for Research, Writing and Information Technology).\n\nThe Library will honor over fifty students from the class of 2019 with selections ranging from world fiction, poetry, cookbooks, and DVDs to children’s books, inspirational works, and historical scholarship.\n\nThis year's featured students are Amrit Kaur Ahluwalia • Ian Ali • Evelyn Bird • Keira Byno • Ned Darling • Tyné Angela Freeman • Alex Yeonwoo Kim • Daniel Hyunil Kim • Heeju Kim • Kaylee Paul.\n\nExhibit design and photography by Dennis Grady, Library Teaching & Learning. Many thanks to the students who volunteered to participate in this exhibit, and to: Richard Langdell, Library Services Specialist; Tim Wolfe, Acquisitions Services Supervisor; and Goodie Corriveau, Acquisitions Assistant.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street: July 16 - September 6, 2019\n\nProject 562: Changing the Way We See Native America\n\nCreated by Matika Wilbur, a visual storyteller from the Swinomish and Tulalip peoples of coastal Washington, Project 562 is a multi-year national photography project dedicated to photographing over 562 federally recognized tribes in the United States resulting in an unprecedented repository of imagery and oral histories that accurately portrays contemporary Native Americans. This creative, consciousness-shifting work will be widely distributed through national curricula, artistic publications, exhibitions, and online portals.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street: April 1 - June 30, 2019\n\n1968 - The World Turned Upside Down\n\nIn this exhibit we mark the 50th anniversary some of the tumultuous events of 1968 as they unfolded across the globe:\n\nChina's Down to the Countryside Movement, Paris Mai '68, the Tlatelolco Massacre in Mexico, and the general political upheaval in the USA.\n\nExhibit curated by Jill Baron, Mark Bray, Dennis Grady, Jorge Quintana-Navarrete, Israel Reyes, and Nien Lin Xie; designed by Dennis Grady, Library Teaching & Learning.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street: October 18, 2018 - February 23, 2019\n\nCollections Showcase: Original Etchings by American Artists\n\nOriginal Etchings by American Artists was published at a time in American history when the country was trying to establish an artistic identity and visual presence that could rival Europe’s. Sylvester Rosa Koehler, the first curator of prints at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and editor of this work, went on to be a curator of graphic arts at the Smithsonian and was also an editor and contributor to American Art Review. He commissioned all of the etchings included in the volume and he chose artists who were at the top of the 19th century American art scene.\n\nDartmouth’s copy of Original Etchings by American Artists can be viewed in Sherman Art Library by asking for NE2186 .K7 in Art Special. The volume can also be viewed online, as it was recently digitized by the Dartmouth Digital Library Program (DLP). The DLP promotes innovative research and teaching through the strategic digitization of Library collections and the open access publication of digital scholarship. Many of these prints from this volume can be viewed individually in museums around the country, and it is rare to find a complete volume today. Dartmouth’s print volume is, in fact, missing two prints, which have been generously provided for the online collection by the Smith College Museum of Art.\n\nThis exhibit is part of Collections Showcase, a series of occasional exhibits that highlight Dartmouth College Library’s collections. To suggest future exhibit topics contact Laura Barrett, Director of Library Education & Outreach. Text by Laura Graveline, Monica Erives, and Laura Barrett.

The Endowment’s mission is to bring outstanding luminaries from the academic world as well as from non-academic spheres to campus.\n\nOver the past four decades, the Montgomery Endowment has hosted more than 230 distinguished fellows, many of whom came back a second or even a third time. During their residencies, the fellows visit classes, meet with faculty and students, and give public lectures.\n\nThe Montgomery Fellows Program has reached out across the disciplines and beyond academic life, installing on campus playwrights and film directors, novelists, musicians, scientists, politicians, and journalists. Designated lifelong “Montgomery Fellows,” these distinguished individuals are in Hanover for varying lengths of time, ranging from a few days up to a full term. During their incumbencies, the fellows and their families inhabit the Montgomery House, a comfortable and gracious residence adjacent to campus and overlooking Occom Pond.\n\nExhibit curated by Klaus Milich, Director of the Montgomery Fellows Program; designed by Dennis Grady, Library Education & Outreach.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street: July 26 - September 21, 2018\n\nStudent Library Service Bookplate Program - Dartmouth Class of 2018\n\nThe Student Library Service Bookplate Program honors the Library’s graduating student employees by inviting them to choose books and other items for the Library’s collections. Each item will receive a bookplate that acknowledges the student’s selection and honors his or her service to the Library. Students are eligible if they worked at least two terms in any Library department (including RWIT, The Student Center for Research, Writing and Information Technology). The Library will honor nearly fifty students from the class of 2018 with selections ranging from world fiction, poetry, cookbooks, and DVDs to children’s books, inspirational works, and historical scholarship.\n\nThis year's featured students are Kalei Akau • Abbey Cahill • Riley Carbone • Jacob Cutler Palden Flynn • Sofia Greimel-Garza • Taringana Guranungo Mary Liza Hartong • Charlotte Johnstone • Rachael Jones Precious Kilimo • Jessica Lu • Yen Truong\n\nExhibit design and photography by Dennis Grady, Library Education & Outreach.

Thanks to the generosity of the donors, Diana and Bruce Rauner ’78, the collection is now placed in Rauner Special Collections Library where it will be used to support research and to enhance the classroom experience of Dartmouth students. It holds so much promise. The collection documents Puzo’s initial struggles and remarkable rise, catalogs his foibles and personal insecurities, and comments on the writing profession in the 20th century. But most importantly, it shows the creation and development of the dominant popular conception of the mob in America—seemingly, every mafia cliché has its origins in these papers. As we said, it was an offer we couldn’t refuse.\n\nThis exhibit was made possible through the generosity of Diana and Bruce Rauner. It was curated by Hazel-Dawn Dumpert; designed by Dennis Grady, Library Education & Outreach; with assistance from Veronica Cook Williamson, Jones Memorial Digital Media Fellow; Deborah Howe, Collections Conservator; Lizzie Curran, Assistant Conservator; and Elena Cordova, Special Collections Processing Specialist.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street: April 5 - June 30, 2018\n\nWill Carter and the Dartmouth Typeface\n\nThe story of the development of the letterforms that became known as the Dartmouth typeface\n\nIn the early 1960s, Will Carter carved a series of inscriptions on teak panels for the college. Those letters, in their different iterations over the years, became known as the Dartmouth typeface. This is the story behind the chronology and the people involved in the development of that typeface.\n\nCurated by Won K. Chung. Special thanks to Sebastian Carter, Martha Scotford, John R. Nash, Holly Nash Wolff, Jay Satterfield, director of Rauner Special Collections Library, and Dennis Grady, exhibits designer with Library Education & Outreach. Exhibit title set in Letraset version of Dartmouth; all other text set in Octavian. Dartmouth typeface copyrighted by Rampant Lions Press. Exhibit text and captions copyright by Won K.

Nash ’60, calligrapher, stone letter-carver, and a Fellow of the Society of Scribes and Illuminators, London, England.\n\nThursday, April 19, 2018 at 4:30 pm, East Reading Room, Baker Library\n\nReception to follow\n\nEvents are free and open to the public.\n\nThe Coconut Crab - Biology, Art, Conservation, and Darwin\n\nThis exhibit covers the ABCs (actually the ABCDs—Art-Biology-Conservation-Darwin) of coconut crabs. You can see original editions of Charles Darwin’s writings on coconut crabs, as well as natural history pictures, preserved specimens, and other biological materials that were brought back by Mark Laidre after a study of coconut crabs from January to March 2016 on earth’s largest coral atoll, Chagos Archipelago. Following this scientific study, many of Mark’s artist friends were inspired to produce beautiful artwork, which is prominently displayed in this exhibit to celebrate coconut crabs.\n\nThe exhibit includes artworks and writings by Sophia Budny, Rosemary Feit Covey, Robert DuGrenier, Sam Gochman, Vernon de Guzman, Keyan Kaplan, Alex Lamb, Tracy Punshon, Holly Shaffer, and Sarah Smith.\n\nCurated by Mark Laidre, Assistant Professor of Biological Sciences.\n\nExhibit design by Dennis Grady, Library Education & Outreach\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street: January 10 - March 29, 2018\n\nDimensions of Open\n\nDimensions of Open is inspired by the efforts of Dartmouth authors, creators, artists, and inventors to make the results of their work openly and publicly available. The work of Dartmouth scholars and researchers is often in collaboration with authors across the globe, and immediate access to that work has a significant global impact. This exhibit reveals the complex issues surrounding open information through six dimensions: global, political, financial, workforce, technological, and future.\n\nSpecial thanks to those who made this exhibit possible:\n\nContent Creation: Barbara DeFelice and Jen Green: Scholarly Communication, Copyright, and Publishing Program; Pamela Bagley, Laura Braunstein, Barbara DeFelice, Monica Erives, Jen Green, Janifer Holt, and Lora Leligdon: The Open Dartmouth Working Group; Exhibit Design: Dennis Grady: Education & Outreach; Data Visualizations: James Adams: Research and Instruction Services; Editorial Review: Laura Barrett: Education and Outreach.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Baker Main Hall: October 16, 2017 - January 26, 2018\n\nPartnering for a Better World: The Matariki Network of Universities\n\nThe Matariki Network of Universities is an international consortium of seven leading universities on three continents and in seven countries. It was established in 2010 to create new opportunities for collaboration in research and education, to foster faculty, student and staff exchange, create a forum for sharing best practices, and to promote local and global social responsibility . Matariki members are critical friends and trusted partners.\n\nMatariki is the Māori name for the Pleiades star cluster, also known as the Seven Sisters. Matariki is also the word for the Māori New Year, which marks the rise of Matariki and the sighting of the new moon.\n\nThe creation of the Matariki Network of Universities was inspired by the Pleiades, and represents the relationship between, and collaboration among, seven of the world’s leading universities.\n\nMatariki member institutions include Dartmouth (United States), Durham (United Kingdom), Queen’s (Canada), Uppsala (Sweden), Tübingen (Germany), the University of Western Australia, and the University of Otago (New Zealand).\n\nExhibit offered in conjunction with Annual Meeting of the Matariki Network Executive Board at Dartmouth College, October 2017.\n\nCurated by Laurel Stavis, Assistant Provost for Academic Initiatives and Jennifer Taxman, Associate Librarian for Research and Learning.\n\nExhibit design by Dennis Grady, Library Education & Outreach\n\nPoster illustration: Rickeeta Walley, Matariki (Marr-Kudjil Djookan Jinda) The Seven Sisters.

It’s a truth acknowledged easily enough by today’s students, who have witnessed and in some cases participated in current movements like Black Lives Matter, #NoDAPL, and the Women’s March on Washington, among numerous others. What may be less apparent is the role the college plays when the activism dust settles.\n\nAt Dartmouth, the archivists of Rauner Special Collections Library are committed to recording the College’s history—the history of many years ago and the history of yesterday—through primary source documents. Campus activism is a significant part of this history, and one of the most effective ways of capturing it is via first-person narrative.\n\nOral history is an interview-based approach to documenting the past, centering around an in-depth, recorded conversation between two people: the oral historian and an individual who experienced a particular event, era, or culture firsthand. Because of its emphasis on non-dominant perspectives and marginalized voices, oral history is uniquely situated among history methodologies to document moments of protest and dissent. It is, at its heart, a means of telling stories that might otherwise have gone untold.\n\nThis exhibit explores three protest movements in Dartmouth’s past, and a selection of oral history interviews with individuals who experienced them. These interviews and many more are available at Rauner Special Collections Library.\n\nExhibit curated by Caitlin Birch, Digital Collections and Oral History Archivist, and designed by Dennis Grady, Library Education & Outreach.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street: May 1 - July 30, 2017\n\nZircons, Chrysoberyls, Tourmalines, and Opals - Jewelry Design Books of Jaques and Marcus 1890-1926\n\nThe Jaques & Marcus jewelry firm, later Marcus & Company, was established in New York City in 1892 by Herman Marcus and his son William shortly after they immigrated from Germany. Herman Marcus, a skilled jeweler trained in traditional plique-à-jour enameling techniques, quickly became a widely-known and respected designer. Marcus’s affinity for using semi-precious and uncommon gems was central to his jewelry designs.\n\nThe firm was bought by a larger company after World War II and eventually dissolved by the 1960s, but the prominence of Marcus & Co. in its prime was equal to that of Tiffany & Co.\n\nThe Art Nouveau movement, which began in Europe, reached the shores of the United States due to the popularity of designers like Tiffany and Marcus. This artistic movement was a reaction to the Industrial Revolution and the rise of factory-made goods that lacked the unique quality of handmade objects and the asymmetry of the natural world. In Art Nouveau, the utilitarian gave way to the ornate. Artists and craftsmen in the graphic and decorative arts incorporated botanical elements and flowing lines to elevate everyday objects into works of art.\n\nThe original designs made by artists at Marcus & Co. at the turn of the 20th century were compiled into eight albums for the firm’s archives. Burton Elliot ’48 donated these albums to Dartmouth College in 1987, and they served as inspiration in Dartmouth’s Donald Claflin Jewelry Studio for many years. Each delicate drawing and intricate painting portrays a custom piece designed by the firm. The drawings are exquisite examples of Art Nouveau style and each stands as a small masterpiece in itself.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art recently requested the albums be digitized in preparation for the Met’s upcoming museum-wide exhibit on jewelry. First, the albums were stabilized so they could be transported and opened for imaging without risking damage. Conservation staff cleaned the albums of accumulated soot, created new spines out of archival materials, and mended torn pages. With generous support from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the albums were then transported to the Northeast Document Conservation Center to be photographed and digitized. The images displayed here are select examples from the eight volume set, which can be viewed in its entirety in Rauner Special Collections Library.\n\nExhibit curated by Lizzie Curran, Assistant Library Conservator, and designed by Dennis Grady, Library Education & Outreach.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Baker Main Hall: April 14 - June 2, 2017\n\n\"...a long, long way to go...\"\n\nThe Gibbs Memorial Book Fund and African American Studies at Dartmouth\n\nThe Duane Gibbs '76 and William Rice '76 Memorial Book fund is one of many funds in the Library that memorializes Dartmouth's alumni. This particular fund is for the acquisition of books, journals, and reference materials by African American authors. The fund was originally established in 1989 by Reginald Thomas '75, P'10, William Rice '76, P'19, and Gary Love '76, P'10 in honor of their dear friend Duane Gibbs '76, who died that same year. Rice's name was added to the fund after his death in 2016 to memorialize his devotion to his friend Duane and to his alma mater Dartmouth.\n\nThe 40th anniversary of Gibbs's, Rice's, and their friends' graduation provides the opportunity to explore the African American educational experience at Dartmouth in and around 1976. This exhibit explores the development of the African and African American Studies Program, the life and work of Errol Hill, an African American educator at Dartmouth, and works by African American authors in the Library's collections.\n\nThis exhibit is displayed with gratitude to Gary Love '76 for proposing the exhibit, Dennis Grady the exhibit designer, and curators Laura Braunstein, Morgan Swan, Whitney Martin, and Laura Barrett.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street: February 10 - April 30, 2017\n\nExhibit reception, Berry Main Street: Monday, April 10, 3:30-4:30pm\n\nTibetan and Himalayan Lifeworlds\n\nTibetan and Himalayan Lifeworlds provides a window onto the unique culture and environment of the 'Roof of the World.' This exhibit explores the social and religious practices that shape life in Asia's high mountain environments, explores the political history of the region, and describes some of the encounters between foreigners and Himalayan and Tibetan people over time. The exhibit has been curated by Senior Lecturer Kenneth Bauer and Associate Professor Sienna Craig.\n\nTibetan and Himalayan Lifeworlds is enriched by the presence on campus of artist Tenzin Norbu, a painter from Dolpo, Nepal. Norbu studied traditional thangka painting as well as Buddhism from his father, following a lineage of painters that dates back more than 400 years. He is also one of the leading figures in contemporary Tibetan art. In January 2017, Norbu will spend time painting in Baker-Berry Main Hall (Thursday, January 19 and Wednesday, January 25, 9:30am-2:30pm), visiting classes, and staging a popup exhibit of some of his recent work at the Black Family Arts Center. For more information on Norbu's visit go to https://news.dartmouth.edu/events/event?event=42728.\n\nThis exhibit and Tenzin Norbu's residency at Dartmouth is made possible by support from the Dartmouth College Library, the HOOD Museum of Art, the Leslie Center for the Humanities, the Rockefeller Center, the Asian and Middle Eastern Studies program, and the departments of Anthropology, Art History, Religion, and Studio Art.\n\nExhibit design by Dennis Grady, Library Education & Outreach.

As a motto written on manuscripts in an Indian archive dictates, a book should “be adorned like a dear son…safeguarded like a good plot of land…purified daily like one’s own body…and looked upon…like a good friend; it should be tied fast like a culprit sentenced to death and should always be remembered like the name of God.” The book is the material recording and dictating society, to be tended to and penalized, revered and conversant, but it is also vulnerable. Only if the book is preserved and protected will it escape from a “state of deterioration.” For the weakness of paper is in its fibers: delicious to insects, fading in sunlight, easy to tear, dampen, and decay.\n\nIn this exhibition, curated by Holly Shaffer, Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in the Humanities, and her students in Art History class 17.14, Art and Industry in South Asia, 1800 to the Present, and drawn from materials in Baker-Berry Library and Rauner Special Collections Library, we examine the history of paper in South Asia (including present-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) through the materials that chronicle it in four cases. First as a product in the case titled “Paper Made,” then as a vehicle for 19th-century British colonial bureaucracy in “Paper Empire.” Third, as a “Paper Revolt,” a 20th-century method of disseminating an anti-colonial, nationalist movement for independence, and finally in the contemporary artist Dayanita Singh’s photographs of archives. Here, “Post Paper,” bundles, stacks, files, and folders seem to wait patiently for a reader, slowly turning to dust. Paper not only creates and disperses history, but also becomes the source for its own documentation and demise.\n\nExhibit curated by Holly Shaffer, Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in the Humanities - South Asian & British Art, and her students in ARTH 17.14, Art and Industry: The Visual and Material Culture of South Asia, 1800 to Present:\n\nZachary Cherian ’20, Perri Haser ’17, Saleha Irfan ’19, Marina Massidda ’17, India Perdue ’19, Anneliese Thomas ’19, Emma Woodberry ’19, Haley Woodberry ’17\n\nSponsored by the Art History Department, Baker-Berry Library, the Leslie Center for the Humanities, and Rauner Special Collections Library.\n\nExhibit design by Dennis Grady, Library Education & Outreach.\n\nMaterials support by Deborah Howe, Collections Conservator and Lizzie Curran, Assistant Conservator.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street: November 1, 2016 - January 27, 2017\n\nPrinting Down Under\n\nA Matariki Exchange\n\nThe Printer in Residence Program at University of Otago Library’s Otakou Press in Dunedin, New Zealand was initiated in 2003 to encourage awareness of the Press’ printmaking facilities and to foster book-making within both the University and the broader arts community. Each visiting printer uses the University Library’s printing presses to produce a limited edition publication. Sarah Smith, Dartmouth College Book Arts Workshop Program Manager, was this year’s Printer in Residence.\n\nDartmouth and the University of Otago are both members of the Matariki Network of Universities, an international group of seven universities from seven different countries that have long-excelled in research-led education. The five other Matariki members are: Durham University, England; Queen’s University, Canada; University of Tubingen, Germany; University of Western Australia; and Uppsala University, Sweden.\n\nThis year the Otakou Press added a new element to the residency program—an exhibit exchange. An exhibit featuring Dartmouth Book Arts Workshop was displayed in the University of Otago’s Library during Sarah’s residency, and upon her return Sarah facilitated the installation of this exhibit featuring the work of the Otakou Press’ past and present Printers in Residence.\n\nPrinting Down Under: A Matariki Exchange was curated by Donald Kerr, Special Collections Librarian at the University of Otago Library; Dennis Grady, Dartmouth Library Education & Outreach; and Sarah Smith, Book Arts Workshop Program Manager.

Digital humanists seek both to understand human culture (literature, art, media) by using technology, and to understand technology through a humanist lens. Digital humanists use computational methods, build digital collections, design online games, create new media, analyze textual data, and think critically about the technological environment in which we carry out our daily lives. Digital humanities is a collaborative endeavor, involving faculty and scholars across the disciplines—including English, Anthropology, Computer Science, Film & Media Studies, and Classics, to name a few—and practitioners around the institution, including technologists, archivists and librarians, graphic designers, programmers, and students, who work together in cross-disciplinary, cross-functional teams that operate outside traditional academic hierarchies. Currently, Dartmouth has a thriving digital humanities community. This exhibit showcases many—but not all—of the projects happening now at Dartmouth; we invite you to explore our work and our community further at digitalhumanities.dartmouth.edu\n\nDigital Humanities at Dartmouth: Portraits of a Community of Practice was curated by Laura Braunstein, Digital Humanities and English Librarian, and Scott Millspaugh, Instructional Designer. Design by Dennis Grady, Library Education & Outreach.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Baker Main Hall: August 10 - September 30, 2016\n\nStudent Library Service Bookplate Program\n\nDartmouth Class of 2016\n\nThe Student Library Service Bookplate Program honors the Library’s graduating student employees by inviting them to choose books and other items for the Library’s collections.

A Quechua-speaking native born in a small village in the vicinity of Lake Titicaca, Chambi considered himself the “representative of his race” and aspired to capture the entire gamut of life in the southern Peruvian Andes. Critics celebrate his exquisite and dramatic photographs of Machu Picchu and other archaeological sites, as well as his photographic manipulation of light and chiaroscuro that have earned him the title “painter of light.”\n\nThe Martín Chambi Archive, in Cusco, Peru, holds more than 35,000 of the photographer’s glass plates, which document the modernization and radical transformation of the region. His images include the arrival of the first cars, the devastating earthquake of 1950, and members of all classes of society, from the chichera to the city’s elites.\n\nA Dartmouth – Martín Chambi Archive Collaboration\n\nThis Library exhibit, Out of the Archives – Into the Streets, showcases\n\nProfessor Silvia Spitta’s two-year collaboration with the Martín Chambi Archive. Thanks to a Dean of the Faculty Scholarly Innovation Grant, the project enabled the digitization of thousands of previously unseen glass plates, culminating with the city-wide exhibit El Cusco de Martín Chambi, in which thirty-two of Chambi’s iconic images were enlarged and set up in the streets. Argentine photographer Julio Pantoja documented the exhibit with the photographs included in this exhibit.\n\nThe El Cusco de Martín Chambi exhibit underscored the importance —and the potential—of the archive as a source of cultural heritage, memory, and, ultimately, community.\n\nOut of the Archives - Into the Streets, curated by Professor Silvia Spitta, Jill Baron, and Dennis Grady, is offered in conjunction with Out of the Archive: Photography, Patrimony, and Performance in Latin America, an international conference generously sponsored by the Leslie Humanities Center, the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, the Associate Dean of the Arts and Humanities, the Hood Museum of Art, and the Native American Studies Program, April 14-15, 2016. Exhibit design by Dennis Grady.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Baker Main Hall: April 1 - June 3, 2016\n\nReading the Revolution - Late 20th Century Chinese Graphic Novels\n\nChinese graphic novels were first published in the 1920s. The popularity of these novels rose in the 1950s and peaked in late 1960s and 1970s, but continued to be published until the 1990s. During the 1960s and 1970s, when the Cultural Revolution swept throughout China, schools were closed and books were destroyed. For years, Mao Zedong’s writings, such as Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung (“Little Red Book”), became the predominant reading materials in China. Under these peculiar historical circumstances, graphic novels became a major educational tool and source of entertainment for young people, especially children. As most families lacked the financial resources to purchase them for their children, most obtained the books by renting. Book stalls offered long benches and stools for children to sit and read. The typical cost for renting a single volume was a penny or two.\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that graphic novels were indispensable to a Chinese generation growing up during the 1950s and 1960s. Many children spent hours of their daily life reading them throughout their childhood.\n\nDuring a time when political turmoil prevailed and cultural heritage deteriorated, graphic novels, through vivid images and colorful storytelling, encouraged children’s imagination, gave them an alternative to heavily political materials and enriched their primary education.\n\nSince 2014, the Dartmouth College Library has selectively collected over a dozen titles of Chinese graphic novels ranging from 1957-1989 with the majority published in the 1970’s. The examples in this exhibit provide some insight into how millions of Chinese school aged children were educating themselves in the midst of political turmoil during the Cultural Revolution. In addition, they provide readers a glimpse of what life was like under the circumstances and serve as a testimony to the impacts these movements brought to people and society.\n\nReading the Revolution: Late 20th Century Chinese Graphic Novels was curated by Nien Lin Xie, Librarian for East Asian Studies; design by Dennis Grady, Library Education and Outreach.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Baker Main Hall: January 11 - March 11, 2016\n\nA Lot of Good This Daylight's Gonna Do Us - Cult Cinema from 1968 to 1988: Three Directors\n\nA Lot of Good This Daylight's Gonna Do Us - Cult Cinema from 1968 to 1988: Three Directors examines the work of John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and George Romero within their larger cultural context. Curator Wesley Benash explains his long-standing interest in the subject:\n\n\"When I was six years old, by father let me rent Brian De Palma’s film Carrie from the video store. It scared the hell out of me, but it also spawned a lifelong fascination with the shadowy, macabre underbelly of the cinema. As a young boy and teenager, I was interested in these films for their sensational elements –violence, gore, and sex. As I grew up, I began to appreciate them for their sociopolitical elements instead, and I came to understand how less reputable forms of cinema, such as the horror film and exploitation film, frequently had much to say about the societies in which they were produced. As a student, I have parlayed this interest in cult film into scholarship; the admiration and appreciation I have for these films serves as the backbone of the thesis I am writing in Dartmouth’s Master of Arts in Liberal Studies program.\n\n\"The films on display, and others like them, tend to function as cinema’s id, forcing us to acknowledge the ugliness within society and within ourselves; it is for this reason that they repulse so many viewers. But for those who are willing to open their minds to these films, they are equally audacious and enlightening.\n\n\"I obsessively watched the works of John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and George Romero as a boy and teenager. I think they are great artists and that their best work stands up to the finest products of Hollywood, Italian neorealism, the French New Wave, or any other period in cinema history. It is my hope that upon viewing their work, you will feel the same.\"\n\nExhibit curated by Wesley Benash; design by Dennis Grady, Library Education and Outreach.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street: January 5 - March 11, 2016\n\nChristian Wolff: beginning anew with every ending\n\nBy the time he came to Dartmouth to teach Classics, Comparative Literature, and Music in 1971, Christian Wolff was already a world-renowned composer, as a member of the “New York School” of American composers with John Cage, Morton Feldman, Earle Brown, and David Tudor. He had played a key role in the revolution in music composition at mid-century when, at the age of 16, he gave a copy of The I Ching – or Book of Changes to his new-found composition teacher, John Cage. Cage had been searching for a way to rescue his music from his own preconceptions, aesthetic habits, and learned musical expectations. The I Ching provided a way, through the introduction of chance procedures into the process of composing music, for Cage to remove his own preferences from the process. As Kay Larson notes in Where the Heart Beats–John Cage, Zen Buddhism, and the Inner Life of Artists (NY: Penguin Press, 2012), “Christian’s gift of The I Ching—like a blessing that could never have been anticipated—made the revolution possible.”\n\nThis exhibit highlights key aspects of Christian Wolff’s works: indeterminacy, politics and collaboration; and celebrates the composer’s long association with Dartmouth College as a professor of music, classics and comparative literature. It is offered in conjunction with The Exception and the Rule: a Celebration of Christian Wolff Featuring International Contemporary Ensemble (Ice).\n\nExhibit curated and designed by Dennis Grady, with help from Pat Fisken, Head of Paddock Music Library; Joy Weale, Music Library Supervisor; Deborah Howe, Dartmouth Library Collections Conservator; Meghan Grela ’17; Reid Watson ’16; and Prajeet Bajpai ’16. Many thanks to Margaret Lawrence, Director of Programming at the Hopkins Center, for suggesting a Library exhibit to complement the Hopkins Center’s program, The Exception and the Rule: A Celebration of Christian Wolff; to Alvin Lucier and Amy Beal for permission to use their insightful published writings; to Stephanie Berger and Gordon Mumma for their photographs; and most of all, of course, to Christian Wolff for his astonishing music and for his many generous contributions to this exhibit.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Baker Main Hall: September 18 - December 10, 2015\n\nExhibit reception: Thursday, October 22, 4PM.\n\nPrepare Your Skeleton for the Air - Surrealism and the Spanish Avant-Garde in the Dartmouth College Library\n\nPrepare Your Skeleton for the Air: Surrealism and the Spanish Avant-Garde in the Dartmouth College Library coincides with the Department of Spanish & Portuguese conference “Dalí, Lorca & Buñuel in America,” October 15-17, 2015. The exhibit features materials from the Dartmouth Library’s collections that display the influence of surrealism on the work of Salvador Dalí (1904-1989), Federico García Lorca (1898-1936), and Luis Buñuel (1900-1983).\n\nOur exhibit title, “Prepare Your Skeleton for the Air,” is from Federico Garcia Lorca’s poem “Ruin,” in his Poeta en Nueva York collection. The poem ends with these two stanzas:\n\nTú solo y yo quedamos.\n\nPrepara tu esqueleto para el aire.\n\nYo solo y tú quedamos.\n\nPrepara tu esqueleto.\n\nHay que buscar de prisa, amor, de prisa,\n\nnuestro perfil sin sueño.\n\n------\n\nYou alone and I remain.\n\nPrepare your skeleton for the air.\n\nI alone and you remain.\n\nPrepare your skeleton.\n\nOne must look quickly, love, quickly,\n\nfor our profile without sleep.\n\nExhibit curated by Jill Baron, Romance Languages and Literature Librarian, with help from José del Pino, Dartmouth Professor of Spanish; design by Dennis Grady, Library Education and Outreach; document and book preparation by Deborah Howe, Library Collections Conservator.\n\nBaker-Berry Library, Berry Main Street: October 8 - December 11, 2015\n\nExhibit reception: Friday, October 16, 5:30PM.\n\nStudent Library Service Bookplate Program\n\nDartmouth Class of 2015\n\nThe Student Library Service Bookplate Program honors the Library’s graduating student employees by inviting them to choose books and other items for the Library’s collections.

Kennedy\n\nFifty years after the fact, the facts themselves, filtered and funneled into diverse theories, have persisted in various permutations without ever reaching a final denouement. The Warren Commission, convened by Lyndon Johnson days after the assassination, issued its non-conspiracy theory less than a year later in 26 volumes of testimony and exhibits and the 888-page Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The Commission's conclusion, that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, has been doubted and disputed since the day it was issued.\n\nThis exhibit surveys many of the holdings of Baker-Berry and Rauner Libraries that pertain to the assassination, and includes the digital forensic analysis of the famous Oswald backyard photo presented by Dartmouth Professor Hany Farid.\n\nThe Grassy Knoll Revisited - On the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Assassination of President John F.
