        "text": "with biographical sketches by Howard Coffin\n\nAmong the excellent facilities provided in the new Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for the Social Sciences, the Class of 1930 Room has already established its special usefulness to go along with its attractive design and appointments. When this large seminar room was in the planning stage, committee members from 1930 proposed that one of the panelled walls be used to highlight Dartmouth's commitment to public service by recording the names of all the Dartmouth graduates who have served in national elective office or as governors of the states. This list of one Vice President, 25 U.S. Senators, 130 U.S. Congressmen, and 43 Governors, assembled for the first time, is presented by means of individual plaques, with space remaining for names to be added in future years. Something to look forward to is the day when the first woman graduate of the College takes her place on what has come to be known as the Public Service Wall.\n\nThe 1930 Room display is headed by a quotation from President Ernest Martin Hopkins - and the statement: \"Presented by the Class of 1930 to honor our classmates, those who have preceded, those who followed, and those who will follow, in the Dartmouth tradition of accepting the responsibility of public life. We recognize here those who have served in national elective office or as Governors.\"\n\nIn the lists that follow, the Dartmouth classes represented range from 1774 to 1970. The full roster of honored alumni is:\n\nVice President of the UnitedStates Nelson A.

McKernan Jr. '70 Maine, 1983-\n\n1983 Daniel Webster: Webster and Rockefeller areprobably the only two \"household names\" on the1930 Room Public Service Wall. Webster servedtwo terms each as a representative from bothNew Hampshire and Massachusetts and waselected four times as U.S. senator from Massachusetts. He also served twice as secretary ofstate, under Presidents Harrison and Tyler andunder President Fillmore.\n\nIn Steven Vincent Benet's The Devil and Daniel Webster, published in 1937, Benetwrote:\n\n\"They say that if you go to his grave andspeak loud and clear, 'Dan'l Webster - Dan'lWebster!' the ground'll begin to shiver and thetrees begin to shake. And after a while you'llhear a deep voice saying, 'Neighbor, how standsthe Union?' Then you better answer the Unionstands as she stood, rock-bottomed and coppersheathed, one and indivisible, or he's liable torear right out of the ground.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that on the 200 th anniversary of Webster's birth, January 18, 1982, NewHampshire was shaken by a rare and unusuallystrong earthquake. The quake was centered inFranklin, N.H., the town zvhere Webster wasborn.\n\nSamuel Pingree: (Above.) An 1857 Dartmouthgraduate, Pingree went off to fight early in theCivil War. In the ill-fated Peninsula Campaignof Gen. George McClellan, Pingree toaswounded leading a desperate charge against en-trenched Confederate positions. He survived,was acclaimed a war hero, and later was electedgovernor of Vermont.\n\nJohn Wentworth: (Left.) Knoivn as \"LongJohn,\" this New Hampshire native stood six feetsix and weighed some 300 pounds. After graduation from Dartmouth in 1836, Wentworth tookhis meager savings and travelled to Detroit unsuccessfully seeking a teaching position.\n\nWithin three years Wentworth owned a majorChicago newspaper. At 28 he was elected toCongress. In 1857 Wentworth was electedmayor of Chicago after telling one campaign audience, \"You can either vote for me or you cango to hell.\" Well-known for his outspokenness,Wentworth once informed fellow congressmanAbraham Lincoln that he (Lincoln) needed\"someone to run him.\"\n\nYear by year Wentworth purchased more andmore Chicago and Cook County property untilhe was said to be the richest man in Chicago.\n\nRichard W. Mallary: (Not pictured.) The percentages were against this '49 Dartmouth College graduate in his political career. Afterserving as speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives, Mallary was elected in 1972 to\n\nCongress. He quickly established a reputation asone of Congress' most brilliant members. In1974, perhaps too soon, he decided to run forthe U.S. Senate. Vermont which was a once arock-ribbed Republican state, steadily becamemore Democratic. Though it had never elected aDemocrat to the Senate, Mallary's Democraticopponent, a little-known county prosecutor, wonelection rather handily. Mallary is now a Vermont power company executive.\n\nRufus Choate: \"(Right.) The roommate of JamesMarsh '17, Choate had to borrow money to attend Dartmouth and suffered a nervous breakdoion shortly before graduating in 1819.\n\nA brilliant lawyer and orator, one court reporter complained that he could not keep upwith Choate's arguments, asking, \"Who can record chain lightning?\"\n\nHe was chosen-to fill Daniel Webster's Senateseat on Webster's death and delivered a movingeulogy to Webster in a memorial service at Dartmouth. Choate apparently did not feel at homein the Senate. And he declined appointmentsboth to the U.S. Supreme Court and the Massachusetts Supreme Court.\n\nEdward Everett, regarded as the greatest orator of his time, delivered the eulogy at memorialservices for Choate in Faneuil Hall, Boston.\n\nHistorians have found Choate a difficult subject to research, for his handwriting was perhapsthe most illegible of all famous American men.\n\nJames Wilson Grimes: (Left.) Soon after hisDartmouth graduation in 1836, this NewHampshire native headed west to seek his fortune. His adopted state of lowa elected him tothe U.S. House and then to the Senate duringthe Civil War. As a member of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, Grimes greatly aidedthe Union cause by advocating the building ofironclad warships.\n\nDuring impeachment proceedings againstPresident Andrew Johnson, Grimes took a position unpopular in lowa by supporting the president. The strain of the trial became too much forthe frail Grimes and he suffered a stroke. However, he was carried into the Senate for the finalvote. The impeachment move failed by just onevote.\n\nErasttis Root: (Not pictured.) This native ofHebron, Conn., thrived in public life despite areputation for being uncouth. On one of his firstappearances before the state Senate, political enemies accused him of being drunk. Root went tocourt and cleared his name. He became a powerin the Empire State politics and was elected tothree terms in Congress.\n\nAmos Tuck: (Above.) Tuck, an 1835 Dartmouth graduate, was a personal friend of Abraham Lincoln. Admirers have said that theRepublican Party was really a New Hampshirecreation for which this Granite State native wasprincipally responsible. New Hampshire senthim to Congress for three terms, and his sonEdward (Class of 1862), endowed the nation'sfirst graduate school of business in his name.\n\nJohn Noble Goodwin: (Not pictured.) This\n\nMaine native, an 1844 Dartmouth graduate,was elected to Congress in 1860 as a strong supporter of Abraham Lincoln. But two years later,Maine voters refused to return him to Washington.\n\nIn 1863, Lincoln named a governor for theTerritory of Arizona, but the man died before hecould depart from Washington. So Lincoln thennamed Goodwin to the post as governor of awild land with less than 600 settlers. Goodwinapparently thrived in the appointive job and waslater elected to Congress from Arizona. Heended his career by establishing a successful lawpractice in Neiv York City.\n\nNelson Rockefeller: (Not pictured.) New Yorkgovernor, presidential candidate and vice president, Rockefeller was for many years a majorfigure in American politics. Yet that interestfailed to blossom until after his graduation fromDartmouth in 1930. His roommate of fouryears, John French of Woodstock, could not recall ever having talked politics with Rockefellerduring their undergraduate days. French remembered that Rockefeller, when speculating onhis post-graduate career, discussed working withhis father in philanthropic activities. French alsorecalled that Rockefeller showed no interest whileat Dartmouth in two other areas that would occupy much of his later life Latin America andmodern art. French said that his and Rockefeller's room at Dartmouth was decorated with apicture of a sailing ship and two shoddy reproductions of Murillo paintings.\n\nSherman Adams: (Above.) A member of theClass of 1920, this native Vermonter became amajor figure in the New Hampshire lumber industry, was elected governor of New Hampshireand a congressman from that state, and waslater a key assistant to President Dwight Eisenhower. He was best knozon during his Dartmouth years as a long-distance hiker. He oncedetermined to hike the 83 miles of trails maintained by Dartmouth from Littleton to Hanoverin less than 24 hours.
