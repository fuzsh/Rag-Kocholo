        "text": "Samuel Huntley, M.D.\n\nPGY 5\n\nFellowship: The Steadman Clinic, Vail - Sports\n\nMedical School: University of Miami\n\nUndergraduate School: University of the Cumberlands\n\nSam was born in Federal Way, Washington, but moved young and was raised in Denver, Colorado. He attended the University of the Cumberlands on a full-ride athletic scholarship for swimming and graduated Summa Cum Laude in 2013 with a Bachelor’s degree in Biology and Associate degrees in Chemistry and Mathematics. During his three years in undergrad, he was inducted into the Mu Alpha Theta, Beta Beta Beta, and Gamma Sigma Epsilon honor societies. In addition, he was a three-time All American swimmer. While taking a year off to work, he was accepted into the 4-year integrated MD/MPH program at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Since then, he has actively participated as a researcher in the Department of Orthopaedics and the Department of Public Health. Notably, he obtained a research grant from the CDC to study risk factors for and underreporting of osteoarthritis among Miami construction workers. Sam chose the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital as his number one choice to complete his orthopaedic training due to the unmatched resident camaraderie, the broad spectrum of pathology exposure, and unsurpassed early and extensive surgical training. In his spare time, Sam likes to explore Miami restaurants, swim, snorkel, tan, and exercise.\n\nDanielle Marshall, M.D.\n\nPGY 5\n\nFellowship: Wake Forest University - Hand\n\nMedical School: Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine\n\nUndergraduate School: University of California, Berkeley\n\nDanielle split her time growing up between Saddle River, NJ and Toronto, Canada. She traveled across the country to University of California, Berkeley to obtain a degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology with a minor in Global Poverty in 2012. During her undergraduate career, she had the opportunity to develop and teach a tropical disease medicine course as well as manage an undergraduate group on a 2-month medical rotation in Shirati, Tanzania. Upon graduation, she joined the leukemia clinical trials team at Weill Cornell Medical College in NYC for three years, where she ran phase II studies in novel immunotherapies. Danielle completed her medical education at Case Western Reserve University. During the summer after her first year, she was awarded the Summer Research Fellowship at the Hospital for Special Surgery, where she managed clinical trials evaluating ultrasound in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome and designing a novel volar locking distal radius fracture plate. She continued these research pursuits throughout her four years in medical school, and her research interests continue to lie in upper extremity reconstruction and repair. She also enjoys dancing, tennis, and live concerts. Danielle chose the Miami residency program for its unparalleled high-volume, hands-on operative experience and fun, close-knit group of residents.\n\nAnthony Martin, M.D.\n\nPGY 5\n\nFellowship: Rothman / Jefferson Medical College - Hand & Upper Extremity\n\nMedical School: University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine\n\nUndergraduate School: University of Pennsylvania\n\nAnthony is a Cuban-American born and raised in Miami, FL. He graduated from Belen Jesuit High School, and later moved to Philadelphia to eat cheese steaks and study bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania. He continued on to medical school at Penn, where he confirmed his love for orthopaedic surgery. While in medical school, he pursued a masters degree in translational research and completed a large animal study evaluating biologic scaffolds for cartilage regeneration. Anthony chose to return to Miami for residency training because of the unparalleled operative experience offered at Jackson Memorial Hospital, the great breadth of unique research opportunities, and the dynamic mix of both blue and white collar patients, including a familiar underserved Hispanic population. Outside of the hospital, Anthony enjoys cycling, diving, community service, spending time with family, and serving as a tour-guide for his co-residents.\n\nRajan Murgai, M.D.\n\nPGY 5\n\nFellowship: New York University - Hand\n\nMedical School: University of Southern California\n\nUndergraduate School: University of California, Los Angeles\n\nRajan grew up in Orange County, California. He completed his undergraduate studies at UCLA where he graduated Magna Cum Laude with a major in Bioengineering. A highlight of his undergraduate career was publishing his research on novel synthetic mimics of antimicrobial peptides. Before medical school, he worked as an engineer for a startup company developing an orthopaedic device. Rajan attended medical school at USC and graduated with a distinction in research. During medical school, Rajan was awarded the Dean’s Research Scholarship and completed a clinical research fellowship at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. His research during this year focused on pediatric spinal deformity, leading to international conference presentations. In his free time, Rajan enjoys traveling, spending time at the beach, swimming, boating, and UCLA Athletics. Rajan was drawn to the Miami program by its unparalleled camaraderie, operative experience, and location.\n\nDavid Constantinescu, M.D.\n\nPGY 4\n\nAdministrative Chief Resident Elect 2023-2024, Resident Education Committee\n\nMedical School: Virginia Commonwealth University\n\nUndergraduate School: Eastern Illinois University\n\nDavid Constantinescu was born in Bucharest, Romania but moved to Toronto, Canada at a young age. An NCAA Division 1 tennis scholarship brought him to the United States where he was a 4 x OVC Medal of Honor Recipient and graduated summa cum laude with departmental honors from Eastern Illinois University. His proudest undergraduate accomplishments include his university-funded work in Arizona and Mexico devising a medical patent proposal for radiotherapy treatments in prostate cancer, eventually presenting his work at RSNA in Chicago, IL. In medical school, he graduated at the top of his class at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, earning him induction into Alpha Omega Alpha.
