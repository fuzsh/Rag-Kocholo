        "text": "NYC's continuing their leadership in Building Performance Standard (BPS) implementation with a second #LL97 rules set providing support for Building Owners and the Enforcement Framework - here's the most important takeaway: \"Meeting Local Law 97‚Äôs compliance requirements necessitates years of planning and execution, meaning owners must proactively take steps well before 2030 to align with the emissions limits for the 2030-2034 period.\" As an engineer who's been fortunate to spend years working on my passion and focussed on this topic, I can confirm that each and every building needs start the process of #decarbonization planning at least a handful of years in advance of the penalties coming in to play because it requires: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-disciplinary teams to identify and hone in on the best technical and financial solutions 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sequencing the solutions into an overall Decarbonization Plan, with data and analysis quality high enough that decision makers can commit to the (very) considerable capital investments 3Ô∏è‚É£ Design teams then pass the baton to talented construction managers and installers to execute the work of the retrofits themselves, which can take years when envelope or distribution changes are required We can achieve carbon reduction goals, but we have to speed up the rate at which decarb plans are being performed and implemented. #buildcircular #builtenvironment #buildingperformancestandards #climatechange #decarbonizationmgmt #ll97 #realestate #development #retrofits #greenbuilding üîó Link in comments\n\nAre you prepared for Local Law 97?

The law aims to reduce building emissions by 40 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050, particularly focusing on the city's largest buildings. Today, multiple states and cities have adopted building performance standard policies, including Maryland, Massachusetts, and others. With many developers and building owners facing increasing pressure to reduce carbon emissions, more cities and states expect similar policies to help reach net-zero building emissions by 2050. For those developers and building owners beginning to explore building decarbonization and compliance, the options can be overwhelming, from financials to ensuring actions align with objectives. Brightcore Energy has helped many building owners bring their properties into compliance, helping them achieve their financial, sustainability, and decarbonization objectives.

PERFORMANCE. #Decarbonization #BuiltEnvironment #CleanEnergy #LL97 #BuildingDecarbonization\n\nCollaboration between commercial landlords and tenants is crucial to meeting NYC's ambitious Local Law 97 (LL97) emissions targets. Urban Green Council's recently released guide, \"Four Opportunities to Align Commercial Landlords and Tenants for LL97 Performance,\" offers a comprehensive look at achieving this alignment effectively. Throughout this informative strategic publication, the piece delves into four strategic areas seeking to better align commercial landlord and tenant energy management to meet LL97 requirements. These include emphasizing the importance of educating tenants to promote voluntary engagement and addressing the need for market adaptation of commercial leases that reflect the new energy efficiency requirements. Additionally, the publication provides significant guidance and insight on navigating the complex data landscape, ensuring that building owners and service providers can collect and interpret data accurately for compliance and support LL97 efforts. As an indispensable resource for building owners, developers, and related stakeholders, this guide is an excellent growth point for decarbonizing the built environment with actionable recommendations to align landlord and tenant interests.

LL97 is legislation that aims to reduce the city's buildings carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050. Buildings that miss their targets will pay hefty fines. That's why pretty much every major player uses Logical Buildings Smartkit AI, and AI based platform that monitors building's carbon output in real time, and enables operators to immediately -- from a mobile dashboard -- take actions that optimize building performance and comfort, while minimizing carbon output. Logical Buildings revolutionary technology drives real, measurable climate impact, while saving millions of dollars of cost for building owners and their tenents. That's why it's a massive, growing business. If you're a building owner/operator and not working with Logical Buildings, now is the time to change that! I'm incredibly proud of David Klatt and the whole team who have been champions of real and measurable climate impact while also scaling a massive business, proving that green business is in fact good business. Here's to a major year for NY, Logical Buildings and for the planet!! cc: Michele Kaufman, Zohra Roy, Sammi Leroy, Jeff Hendler, Seth Reisman, let's go!! üöÄüåé\n\nüè¢ This month NYC Department of Buildings issued a change in Local Law 97: Building owners who can show a good faith effort toward reducing emissions will get a two-year grace period on carbon fines. The move came after many condo and co-op associations complained that they could not line up financing in time for the January 2024 deadline to make the necessary retrofits, the Commercial Observer reported. üåû The good news There's progress. The city expected that 80% of buildings required to be compliant would meet the standards for LL97. And so far 89% of properties met the city's energy goals this year, the DOB stated. But, that still leaves about 1,500 buildings (some of which are the city's largest skyscrapers) with a ton of work to do in order to avoid LL97 fines, the Commercial Observer reported. üñºÔ∏è The big picture Delaying action means there will be steeper emissions cuts required down the line to meet long-term goals. The earlier, the better. One of our favorite Substack newsletters, Sustainability by the Numbers written by Hannah Ritchie doubles down on this idea: Yes, the upfront costs for technology needed to reduce emissions might be cheaper further down the road. However, \"over the medium- to long-term, it's a different story. These investments pay back through reduced fuel costs and efficiency gains such that acting early saves money,\" writes Ritchie. ‚¨áÔ∏è The bottom line \"My advice to building owners and operators: don't delay, because adopting the proper technology to increase the operational efficiency of your assets takes time,\" writes Brendan Wallace, co-founder and managing partner of Fifth Wall. \"There's existing technology you can implement now that saves you money by both avoiding fines and reducing energy bills.\" #realestate #climate #locallaw97\n\nHappy Friday - Knowledge Sharing Session! I‚Äôm dedicating some time today to dive into the profound impact of Local Law 97 (LL97) and the game-changing influence of KODE on the horizon. üè¢ Explore the impact of Local Law 97 (LL97) with KODE Labs - a leader in navigating building performance standards. üåê Key Insights: 1Ô∏è‚É£ LL97's Origin: Born in NYC, it has inspired a nationwide movement for building standards, with over a dozen cities and states adopting similar regulations. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Essence of LL97: Part of the Mayor's NYC Green New Deal, LL97 mandates energy efficiency and emissions limits for buildings over 25,000 sq. ft., aiming for a 40% emissions reduction by 2030 and 80% by 2050. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Non-Compliance Costs: Owners exceeding limits face significant penalties, $268 per metric ton over the threshold, with potential penalties for 25% of buildings in 2024, rising to 75-80% by 2030. 4Ô∏è‚É£ KODE OS: Our platform aids compliance with LL97, offering real-time monitoring, data sharing, energy optimizations, and compliance tracking for a sustainable future. üåê Connect with KODE Labs at https://kodelabs.com/ and explore KODE OS at for a revolutionary approach to building standards. üåçüí° #BuildingStandards #SustainabilityRevolution #SmartBuilding #GreenFuture #LL97Compliance #LL97 #locallaw97\n\nCertainly, the road to compliance with LL97 is not without its obstacles. Building owners are tasked with the intricate process of meeting LL97‚Äôs carbon emissions regulations while ensuring smooth building operations and tenant comfort. Severe fines loom over those who fail to meet these stringent standards, which raises a pressing question: How can property owners reduce emissions while efficiently managing their buildings? While various technologies and strategies can help address these challenges, it‚Äôs essential to understand that no single solution fits all situations. Building owners have a range of options to choose from, and one such option is Nantum OS. Developed by Prescriptive Data, Nantum OS is an innovative operating system that enhances building sustainability and performance without sacrificing comfort.
