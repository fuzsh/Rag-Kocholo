Martin PhD, Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies, African and African American Studies, Harvard University\n\nSummer Term 2022 | CRN 35142 | Section 1\n\nDescription\n\nToday, a heavy burden is placed on consumers to understand the social justice (or lack thereof) of the products that they purchase. Food and nutrition, primary and recurrent needs of all human beings, also become deeply entrenched in social meaning making. Our intimate experiences of food as something we consume in our bodies create social niches in which the consumption of luxury items by connoisseurs allows for claims of superior status, taste, and ethics. This course examines the intersection of race, class, and consumption in historical and contemporary food politics. Together, we analyze the interplay of food and labor, taste and power, race and consumption, community and capitalism, luxury and inequality, food sovereignty and celebrity, and responsibility and repair. We explore elements of the mundane the morning pastry, the bottle of water, or the spices forgotten in our cabinets all items that not only play a role in the movement of billions of dollars around the world, but also in the access to fundamental rights and equity in the lives of all people. Interdisciplinary course readings weave together threads of profound historical and contemporary debates on race, class, and consumption. Assignments address pressing real-world questions related to food justice, labor politics, and social inequality, drawing from our individual and collective experiences.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nTuesdays, Thursdays, June 21-August 5, 12:00pm-3:00pm\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nNoncredit, undergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via live web conference.

Whitelaw PhD, Executive Director for the Reischauer Institute for Japanese Studies, Harvard University\n\nSummer Term 2022 | CRN 35452 | Section 1\n\nDescription\n\nFood and eating are not just necessary for life, they are the basis of culture. Through selection, ingestion, and digestion of food, we make the outside world a part of us, and food and its associated practices have long nourished the discipline of anthropology. This course applies a comparative, anthropological lens to the study of food by examining the connections between what we eat and who we are. Through readings, lectures, and hands-on experiences, we explore the production, distribution, and consumption of food in a range of cultures and contexts. From Tokyo tuna auctions to Atkins diets, eating insects, and dumpster diving for dinner in Portland, the course addresses the ways food shapes our relationship to the environment and the people and institutions around us. Questions we consider include: what can, cannot, and should not be eaten? How does food contribute to the construction of gender, class, race, and ethnic identities? We also interrogate changes to food systems, how industrial diets affect lives and livelihoods, and the intersection of food activism and social justice. While engaging with debates that animate the anthropological study of food, students draw on readings and apply empirical methods to conduct research on a dimension of their own foodscape.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOn campus only\n\nTuesdays, Thursdays, June 21-August 5, 8:30am-11:30am, CGIS Knafel K050\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nNoncredit, undergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: Harvard College students: This course is eligible for degree credit, but see important policy information.\n\nSyllabus\n\nStephen A.

Ur PhD, Stephen Phillips Professor of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University\n\nSummer Term 2022 | CRN 35055 | Section 1\n\nDescription\n\nWhat happened in the past, and if and how we should remember it, is hotly contested. What is our degree of certainty about the past societies and cultures that historians, archaeologists, and others study today? Whose past matters? And how should we remember it? Most of the human past happened in prehistory. This course emphasizes material remains, which are studied primarily by the tools of archaeology. We start with basic questions such as: what is left of the past? How do we find these remains, and how can we know how old they are? Students explore how the past is created in, and sometimes for, the present; how history and archaeology have been used to advance imperial and colonial agendas; and how nations have used the same tools to create their own postcolonial identities. Course readings present a general background, while synchronous meetings present case studies. Students interact with 3D artifacts, web maps, experiments, and other digital methods. After completing this course, students recognize claims made about the past and toward what ends, are able to assess their validity, and understand why the past matters today and for the future.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nMondays, Wednesdays, June 22-August 5, 3:15pm-6:15pm\n\nFriday, June 24, 3:15pm-6:15pm\n\nFriday, July 8, 3:15pm-6:15pm\n\nRequired sections to be arranged.\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nNoncredit, undergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via live web conference.

Brower PhD, Lecturer on Folklore and Mythology, Harvard University\n\nSummer Term 2022 | CRN 35053 | Section 1\n\nDescription\n\nWhat are the effects of displacement on tradition, storytelling, and cultural belonging? How does forced migration influence narration, creative expression, and imagination? What are the powers and potentials of artistic communication after existential rupture? What is the role of the storyteller in flight? This course explores expressive cultures in motion, amid crisis, and out of place, and asks how tradition bearers and creative innovators adapt when the communities in which their preexisting cultural practices had once flourished are destroyed, uprooted, transformed, or dispersed. It also asks how researchers, aid workers, activists, and other outsiders might engage in ethical and beneficial ways with individuals and communities in exile. In examining the impacts of forced migration on cultural production, transmission, and innovation, we put classical theories of refugee and migration studies in conversation with recent ethnographies and folklore collections, as well as memoirs, novels, songs, and films by and about displaced persons. With case studies ranging from colonial Africa, to post-war Europe, to contemporary America, we explore what, if anything, holds together the refugee experience, while also interrogating our own neighborly obligations and scholarly commitments as we navigate what has famously been deemed the century of the migrant.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nMondays, Wednesdays, June 22-August 5, 12:00pm-3:00pm\n\nFriday, June 24, 12:00pm-3:00pm\n\nOptional sections to be arranged.\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nUndergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via live web conference.

Themes include social organization, ideology, religion, exchange, subsistence, gender, land use, ethnicity, ethnic conflict, and local/global interrelations. Students explore these themes through detailed studies of women in North Africa, ethnicity in Bosnia, ritual exchange in the South Pacific, and political organization in Southeast Asia. The instructor also reviews his current applied research on contemporary indigenous responses to political, economic, and ecological changes in Latin America, with special emphasis on the Amazon Basin. Students grapple with the intellectual and ethical challenges, both past and present, of anthropologists.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOn campus only\n\nTuesdays, Thursdays, June 21-August 5, 3:15pm-6:15pm, William James Hall B4\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nNoncredit, undergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: Harvard College students: This course is eligible for degree credit, but see important policy information.\n\nSyllabus\n\nANTH S-1662\n\nThe Human Market: The Global Traffic in Human Beings\n\nKeridwen N. Luis PhD, Lecturer in Anthropology and in the Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies Program, Brandeis University\n\nSummer Term 2022 | CRN 33520 | Section 1\n\nDescription\n\nThe course introduces students to the wide range of cultural and ethical questions surrounding the trade in humans. We consider issues ranging from the traffic in women and children to the trade in human organs. We especially explore the cultural, racial, class, and gender issues inherent in transactions in human beings and their flesh. Who is selling their organs on the international market and why? Whose babies go to whom in international adoption, and who decides what the best interests of the children are? Whose bones are sold to museums and medical schools, and what do such transactions mean?\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live or on demand) web conference\n\nMondays, Wednesdays, June 22-August 5, 12:00pm-3:00pm\n\nFriday, June 24, 12:00pm-3:00pm\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nNoncredit, undergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via web conference.

Making matters worse, understanding the crisis in real time is notoriously difficult, especially since most who overdose do not go to hospitals and death certificates are often unreliable. And while everyone agrees something must be done, what that something is leads us into heated debates over health care spending and harm reduction. While most medical research focuses on the biology of disease, this course takes a biosocial approach to unmask how social factors, economic insecurity, and the availability of massive amounts of pharmaceuticals have become an overdose crisis. We read social scientists, journalists, public health scholars, and first-hand accounts in order to understand the chronic emergencies (such as de-industrialization and despair) behind this acute crisis. By investigating the opioid epidemic in this way, students are encouraged to think boldly and creatively beyond the traditional boundaries of medicine: perhaps someone’s best medicine is a housing voucher, or a testing strip to detect fentanyl. By the end of the class, students understand the social roots of the opioid epidemic and how solutions may be implemented.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOn campus only\n\nMondays, Wednesdays, June 22-August 5, 6:30pm-9:30pm, Harvard Hall 202\n\nFriday, June 24, 6:30pm-9:30pm, Harvard Hall 202\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nNoncredit, undergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: Harvard College students: This course is eligible for degree credit, but see important policy information.\n\nSyllabus\n\nANTH S-1690\n\nInternet Folklore and Digital Storytelling\n\nLowell A. Brower PhD, Lecturer on Folklore and Mythology, Harvard University\n\nSummer Term 2022 | CRN 35399 | Section 1\n\nDescription\n\nExploring the wild world wide web of informal vernacular culture being created, transmitted, and adapted by online communities, this course examines the powers, potentials, and peculiarities of internet folklore in relationship to community-building, political engagement, social change, and everyday negotiations of individual and group identity. On our digital journey, we encounter viral videos, meme warriors, urban legends, occult folk beliefs, disinformation campaigns, and viral challenges, while examining connections between contemporary online culture and ancient storytelling traditions. What new folk groups, storytelling genres, and political potentialities are arising as a result of online engagement? What are the creative, destructive, and ambivalent capacities of online participatory culture, and how are they being harnessed in projects of future-making? Course assignments invite students to research, analyze, and participate in digital storytelling in an attempt to better understand ourselves and our historical moment through folkloristic engagement.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nTuesdays, Thursdays, June 21-August 5, 6:30pm-9:30pm\n\nOptional sections to be arranged.\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nNoncredit, undergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via live web conference.

They also play a fundamental role in all natural sciences and increasingly in the social sciences as well. This course provides an introduction to modeling through in-depth discussions of a series of examples, and hands-on exercises and projects that make use of a range of continuous and discrete mathematical tools.\n\nPrerequisites: MATH S-21a and MATH S-21b or permission of instructor.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOn campus only\n\nTuesdays, Thursdays, June 21-August 5, 12:00pm-3:00pm, Pierce Hall 301\n\nOptional sections to be arranged.\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nNoncredit, undergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: Open to admitted Secondary School Program students by petition.

Some of these discoveries change the way we understand the universe. During the past twenty-five years, we have discovered roughly 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars. Just over twenty years ago, the systematic study of supernovae explosions led to the discovery of a new and still not understood component of the universe called dark energy. In 2016, gravitational radiation was detected for the first time, allowing us to detect the mergers of distant black holes. In this course we select five areas of current research and use these to introduce and study the basic concepts of astronomy. The course is designed to help students get a feel for what it is like to be an astronomer, using the new generation of ground- and space-based telescopes, combined with sophisticated theoretical techniques and computational facilities. As we study each aspect of the universe, we ask how we came to know what we know today and how astronomers are investigating still-unanswered questions.\n\nPrerequisites: High school algebra; some physics background is useful but not necessary.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nTuesdays, Thursdays, June 21-August 5, 6:30pm-9:30pm\n\nOptional sections to be arranged.\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nNoncredit, undergraduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via live web conference.

In the beginning, humans focused on visual ways to find and convey those answers, but in roughly the last century, astronomers have developed various techniques to sensorially explore, discover, and convey in-depth information about the mysteries of the universe. In this course students learn about the life and death of stars while focusing on how the death of a star is involved in the generation of more stellar wonders and even life in the universe. We study what stars leave behind after their deaths, the emergence of gravitational waves from different systems, and the properties of dynamical space time. We multi-sensorially use telescopes to obtain our own data to understand these phenomena. This is an interactive, in-depth astronomy course covering introductory themes.\n\nPrerequisites: High school algebra and trigonometry.

Recent advances in planetary exploration, astronomy, geochemistry, and biochemistry are leading to a revolution in our ideas on the emergence of life on our own planet and the likelihood of finding life outside the Earth. In particular, much is being learned about Mars and Venus because of the many recent and ongoing space missions. Spectacular data from Jupiter’s and Saturn’s moons, like Titan, Europa, and Enceladus, show that these moons may become possible targets of future searches for life. Geochemists are finding more and more intriguing clues about the Earth’s past by analyzing rocks dating from the very first period after the Earth’s formation, thus providing a fundamentally new context for research on the transition between chemistry and primordial life. And the search for extra-solar planets is leading to the discovery of Earth-like planets around solar-type stars. In this course, students are introduced to current and planned telescopic space missions aimed at finding and characterizing exoplanets and robotic missions, such as the Mars rovers. The course also covers current ideas about the role of stars and their evolution in the habitability of planets and in the chemistry of galaxies.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live or on demand) web conference\n\nMondays, Wednesdays, June 22-August 5, 12:00pm-3:00pm\n\nFriday, June 24, 12:00pm-3:00pm\n\nRequired sections to be arranged.\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nNoncredit, undergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via web conference.

It teaches the use of modern molecular biology methods, Mendelian genetics, and immuno-histochemistry to characterize novel fruit fly strains. Students isolate genomic DNA and perform standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inverse PCR, in addition to learning DNA primer design. These methods are applied to clone a lexA-based enhancer trap in the Drosophila genome and the novel data is analyzed using standard bioinformatics tools. Students characterize the expression pattern of their lexA enhancer trap, apply immunohistochemistry, and analyze via epifluorescence microscopy. Students also perform fly intercrosses and are introduced to the existing tool kit of meiotic recombination suppression in Drosophila. Further genetic methods, such as the UAS (upstream activation sequence)/Gal4 and lexA/lexAop binary expression systems, are used. Some class time is devoted to teaching underlying biological and experimental principles that students then apply. At the end of the course, students give scientific presentations, summarizing their findings.\n\nPrerequisites: Completion of Advanced Placement biology or introductory college-level biology.

Gadjeva PhD, Associate Director, Bacteriology, Moderna\n\nSummer Term 2022 | CRN 32752 | Section 1\n\nDescription\n\nThis proseminar is designed to teach students many of the writing and analytical skills that are required to succeed in graduate-level courses in the biological sciences. Through critical reading and presentation of research articles, students learn how to form questions that can be addressed experimentally and how to write a corresponding, testable hypothesis. The course also addresses the process of experimental design and current experimental methodologies in biology. Students are given multiple opportunities to hone their writing skills on several short writing assignments. Students are expected to participate in class discussions, present a paper to the class, and write a final research proposal due at the end of the semester. We focus our attention on the molecular mechanisms of innate immune responses to pathogens. Some prior knowledge of immunology is beneficial but not required. Students learn to think scientifically while they gain knowledge of basic mechanisms of immune protection against bacterial pathogens. Because skills learned in this course are useful in subsequent courses, it is the first course that prospective Master of Liberal Arts (ALM) candidates should take toward the degree (or the second, if they are completing the expository writing prerequisite). While not designed to be a thesis or capstone proposal course, this course does serve as a foundation for eventual work on the thesis or capstone.\n\nPrerequisites: A satisfactory score on the test of critical reading and writing skills or a B or higher grade in the alternate expository writing course; molecular biology (BIOS S-12 or the equivalent) and EXPO S-42c are highly recommended.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nTuesdays, Thursdays, June 21-August 5, 6:30pm-9:30pm\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nGraduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via live web conference.

Yet the global burden of infections remains prodigious, disproportionately affecting low income countries and vulnerable populations. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare these stark inequities. This highly interactive and collaborative course prepares students to understand and mitigate the impact of infectious diseases and pandemics through study of major infections, including COVID-19, cholera, malaria, tuberculosis, syphilis, smallpox, polio, and plague. We provide sufficient clinical, biological, and epidemiological background for students to understand why these infections have had such dramatic effects and how they can be controlled. Rather than merely reciting grim statistics and body counts, we illustrate their impact through the lenses of history, literature, film, and drama. We celebrate how these infections have stimulated revolutionary scientific advances, but also explore the darker side of the story. Advances in prevention and treatment have left large segments of the global population behind. Under the veneer of stunning progress lie the realities of stigmatization, bias, exclusion, shameful human experimentation, and social injustice.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nTuesdays, Thursdays, June 21-August 5, 3:15pm-6:15pm\n\nRequired sections to be arranged.\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nNoncredit, undergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via live web conference.

It is for writers who love to read short stories and want to make their own short stories come alive on the page. Students should arrive having read widely among past and contemporary practitioners of the short story form. We build on that foundation through close reading and discussion of exceptional short stories. We also consider practicalities, such as how to organize a collection in progress, how to submit stories to literary journals, and how to stay connected to your vision. Much of our time together is spent in workshop. Students carefully read and thoughtfully respond to one another’s writing and we work together to determine how best to filter and synthesize the feedback offered in a workshop setting. The skills honed via peer critique are crucial in editing one’s own work, and students conclude the term having written and revised two new short stories (10 to 20 pages each).\n\nPrerequisites: A beginning- or intermediate-level fiction writing course or permission of the instructor. Students should bring a 10-page sample of their work to the first class.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nMondays, Wednesdays, June 22-August 5, 3:15pm-6:15pm\n\nFriday, June 24, 3:15pm-6:15pm\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nGraduate credit $2,980.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via live web conference.

In this case verse is understood to mean any and all forms of writing in lines as opposed to prose sentences: metrical verse, blank verse, syllabic verse, free verse, and verse marked by what T. S. Eliot called “the ghost of meter.” Students follow a structured sequence of writing assignments, readings, and exercises aimed at cultivating a sound working knowledge of the fundamental principles of prosody and the evolving possibilities of poetic form. There is a special emphasis on listening to lines and saying poems aloud, in concert with listening to an eclectic assortment of audio archives. Another focus is the verse line through time, as we turn for instruction and inspiration to what the critic Paul Fussell calls the “historical dimension” of poetic meter and poetic form. The collective goal of the course is to create the conditions for reading and writing poems with a stronger sense of technical know-how and expressive conviction as well as a renewed appreciation for the inexhaustible art of the line.\n\nPrerequisites: A beginning-level poetry course or permission of the instructor.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nTuesdays, Thursdays, June 21-August 5, 6:30pm-9:30pm\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nUndergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via live web conference.

In the first half of the course, we study work by major authors in this capacious genre, including Virginia Woolf, James Baldwin, Joan Didion, Audre Lorde, and Jo Ann Beard. In the course’s second half, we use what we have learned about scene, plot, character, and voice to produce new work. Students may write short memoirs, personal or lyric essays, profiles, literary nonfiction, and more. Toward the end of the course, we focus on strategies for getting published, including how to identify likely publication venues and how to effectively pitch editors.\n\nPrerequisites: An introductory course in creative nonfiction or permission of the instructor.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nTuesdays, Thursdays, June 21-August 5, 12:00pm-3:00pm\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nUndergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via live web conference.

In the first part of this course, we study classic as well as contemporary fairy tales, including works by Helen Oyeyemi, Neil Gaiman, Margaret Atwood, and Kelly Link. In the second part, students workshop their own original prose fiction fairy tale, which may be a piece of short-form fiction or an excerpt from a longer work in progress. Throughout, we explore how fairy tales have encouraged authors to develop their own style and voice, even as they seem to speak in a language all their own.\n\nPrerequisites: A beginning fiction writing class or permission of the instructor.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nMondays, Wednesdays, June 22-August 5, 6:30pm-9:30pm\n\nFriday, June 24, 6:30pm-9:30pm\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nGraduate credit $2,980.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via live web conference.

Reading ancient and modern masterworks from The Art of the Personal Essay, edited by Phillip Lopate, and select contemporary pieces from the latest Best American Essays, edited by Leslie Jamison, gives students models to follow (and to break away from) in their own work. Accomplished professional essayists and editors also visit the class. Past visitors have included Steve Almond, Leah Hager Cohen, James Geary, Jerald Walker, and Joan Wickersham. By building on the prose skills that they bring to the course and drawing on the feedback of their classmates, students cultivate their own voices as essayists.\n\nPrerequisites: An beginning-level writing course or permission of the instructor.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nMondays, Wednesdays, June 22-August 5, 12:00pm-3:00pm\n\nFriday, June 24, 12:00pm-3:00pm\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nUndergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: Writing-intensive course.

In length, the form offers what Edgar Allan Poe defines as the ideal duration of literary art it can be read in a single sitting and, in unity of effect, what Ian McEwan has called the perfect form of prose fiction. With a long literary history, the novella remains today a popular genre in literary publishing. This course offers students the chance to study and practice the art of the novella. Students read masterful examples of the form from writers including Jane Austen, Herman Melville, Henry James, Isak Dinesen, Yasunari Kawabata, James Baldwin, Italo Svevo, and James Joyce. We discuss these texts with the eye of a writer attentive to elements of craft: dramatic structure, tone, point of view, suspense, prose style, rhythm, characterization, and plotting. Students draft and workshop two sections of their own novella. Working in this genre pushes students to write with economy and to polish their sentences as they aspire towards the virtues of excellent prose fiction: precision, economy, clarity, and urgency. The course concludes with a conversation about publishing possibilities for novella writers.\n\nPrerequisites: A beginning-level creative writing course or permission of the instructor.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nMondays, Wednesdays, June 22-August 5, 3:15pm-6:15pm\n\nFriday, June 24, 3:15pm-6:15pm\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nGraduate credit $2,980.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via live web conference.

In this underworld, the protagonist must face mortality and gain knowledge to bring back to the world of the living. In this advanced writing course, we explore underworlds in prose, poetry, and film, possibly including but not limited to Karen Russell’s Swamplandia!, Grace Dane Mazur’s The Garden Party, Katherine May’s Wintering, and Homer’s Odyssey, as well as films like Hayao Miyazaki’s Spirited Away and Disney’s Coco. Drawing upon the great literary pool of underworld traditions, students write their own stories about descents (both literal and metaphorical), creatively depicting the other world, the risks faced, and the knowledge gained. Students produce a complete short story, a chapter of a new work, or a new chapter for a work in progress.\n\nPrerequisites: Students must have completed other fiction-writing courses and have begun writing a novel. Students are expected to have a firm command of grammar, syntax, and prose composition, and to have read widely.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOn campus only\n\nMondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, June 21-July 7, 8:30am-11:30am, Emerson Hall 307\n\nFriday, June 24, 8:30am-11:30am, Emerson Hall 307\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nGraduate credit $2,980.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: Not open to Secondary School Program students.

In a page? In three? This advanced writing course explores one of the hottest forms of fiction published today: flash fiction. Students read widely and experiment freely with the form, which offers a range of possibilities both in style and in length. In weekly writing workshops, students receive regular feedback on their work-in-progress and significantly revise 20-25 pages of prose with the aim of publication. As students draft their work, we study and dissect models of masterful very short fiction by writers both classic and contemporary, including Colette, Guy de Maupassant, Franz Kafka, Jorge Luis Borges, Clarice Lispector, Ernest Hemingway, Yasunari Kawabata, Dorothy Parker, Jamaica Kincaid, Lydia Davis, Charles Baxter, Anne Carson, Keith Taylor, Joyce Carol Oates, and Amy Hempel. We discuss these texts with the eye of a writer attentive to elements of craft: dramatic structure, tone, point of view, suspense, prose style, rhythm, characterization, and plot. Working in this genre pushes students to write with economy and to polish their sentences as they aspire towards the hallmarks of excellent prose fiction: precision and economy, clarity and urgency. The course concludes with a conversation about how to break into publishing by working in a form that offers many opportunities for literary contests, awards, and first publications.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nTuesdays, Thursdays, June 21-August 5, 3:15pm-6:15pm\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nGraduate credit $2,980.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via live web conference.

Now what? How do you convince others to jump on board to buy or create or collaborate or publish or produce your story? How do you move it out of your desk drawer or hard drive or imagination, and into the world? In this course, we break down the making of a pitch into its core elements as we practice strategies for producing pitch materials and for pitching your project in the room to a live audience. Students write and revise three treatments: one for an established work, one for a work they’ve created, and one for an idea they are developing. Students write a query letter, build a pitch deck, and do three live pitches. Finally, students develop an insider’s perspective on industry practices and etiquette, essential knowledge for anyone interested in the business of creation.\n\nPrerequisites: An advanced-level creative writing course or the equivalent, or permission of the instructor.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nTuesdays, Thursdays, June 21-August 5, 8:30am-11:30am\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nUndergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via live web conference.

It is based on the assumption that good legal writing communicates well-considered ideas clearly, concisely, and accurately. Students use the elements of good writing to construct legal arguments, to argue from precedent and principle, and to use facts effectively. They draft a variety of basic legal documents that may include a case brief, a complaint, an answer, an opinion letter, a legal memorandum, and a statute. Course materials may be based on contemporary social issues drawing on the areas of constitutional due process, criminal law, domestic relations law, and the right to privacy.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nTuesdays, Thursdays, June 21-August 5, 3:15pm-6:15pm\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nUndergraduate, graduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: Writing-intensive course.

Scheffler PhD, Preceptor in Expository Writing, Harvard University\n\nSummer Term 2022 | CRN 35393 | Section 1\n\nDescription\n\n“For me, always the delight is the surprise,” writes poet Louise Gl ck, but we might not believe her. Poetry can seem unappealing to people who are not used to reading it it can, for instance, seem overwrought, antiquated, or overly difficult to understand. Yet poetry can also be intensely meaningful. When people fall in love or get married, when they have a funeral or experience a national political trauma, they often read poems out loud as if only poetry can do justice to the full scope of our joy and grief. This course explores some of the surprising delights of both reading and writing poems. We read a variety of contemporary poets, and students write and submit their own poems for discussion in weekly workshops. In so doing, we consider poetry’s capacity to be funny, wise, wild, and heartbreaking its ability to offer a kind of pleasure available nowhere else.\n\nClass Meetings:\n\nOnline (live) web conference\n\nMondays, Wednesdays, June 22-August 5, 12:00pm-3:00pm\n\nFriday, June 24, 12:00pm-3:00pm\n\nTerm Start Date: June 21, 2022\n\nTuition:\n\nUndergraduate credit $3,500.\n\nCredits: 4\n\nNotes: This course meets via live web conference.
