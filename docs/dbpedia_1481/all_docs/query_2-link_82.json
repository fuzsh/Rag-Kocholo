Schaeffer presented his program of progress for\n\nFranklin and Marshall at the annual\n\nmeeting of the College Fund Committee and class representatives, March\n\n17, in the Hamilton Club, Lancaster,\n\nand it was heartily endorsed.\n\nIt was decided that the slogan for\n\nthis year's canvass shall be, '' Promote\n\nthe President's Program,'' and definite plans were made to carry out this\n\npurpose.\n\nThe objective of this program-to\n\nincrease the college enrollment to our\n\ncapacity of 750 to 800 students and to\n\nimprove the scholarship, includes six\n\npoints:\n\n(1) Radio broadcast by faculty\n\nmembers every Tuesday, 7: 30-7: 45\n\np.m. over WGAL.\n\n(2) Addresses at High Schools in\n\nsoutheastern Pennsylvania and Maryland by faculty members who thus\n\ncontact prospective students. Nearly\n\n50 schools have been visited thus far\n\non their invitation and many prospects listed. Through (1) and (2)\n\nthe president seeks not only to bring\n\nthe public to the college, but also the\n\ncollege to the public.\n\n( 3) Letters to Reformed ministers\n\nwho are alumni, urging them to influence students to attend Franklin\n\nand Marshall.\n\n( 4) Stirring addresses by President\n\nSchaeffer at every alumni club meeting, setting forth college conditions,\n\nneeds, and plans, and urging every\n\nalumnus to influence at least one student every three years to come to\n\nFranklin and Marshall College.\n\n(5) Twelve scholarships of $250\n\nallowance on the contingent fee, offered in ten districts in Pennsylvania\n\nand Maryland, and two at-large, to\n\nhigh-school students who qualify in\n\nscholarship and character. This has\n\nbeen approved by the Board of Trustees and district committees appointed\n\nto present the plan to High Schools.\n\n( 6) The President is very definitely\n\nseeking to enrich the cultural side of\n\nstudent life by encouraging music,\n\ndrama, scientific lectures and ot h er\n\nmeans that he has in mind. By way\n\nof illustration, Dr. Sykes was engaged\n\nto direct a large and superior Glee\n\nClub and Albert Spalding, outstanding violinist, recently gave a recital to\n\na full house in Hensel Hall.\n\nIt is proposed that additional class\n\nrepresentatives shall be appointed in\n\nthe large classes since that of 1915;\n\nthat each shall be given the record of\n\nhis class in contributors and contributions during the past four years; that\n\neach representative do more intensive\n\nwork, seeking aid of classmates to visit\n\nfellows in certain centers; that w e\n\nseek to beat Gettysburg in this as in\n\nall sports, by securing 900 subscriber s\n\nfor not less than $8,000. Last year,\n\n925 battlefield boys gave over $7,000\n\nto their college, the third year of their\n\nFund.\n\nThis will be a big job, but it can b e\n\naccomplished by the hearty, steady\n\ncooperation of the class representatives and alumni. Since our boys are\n\nat present defeating the Gettysburg\n\nboys in all sports, it is now up to us\n\nalumni to beat the Gettysburg alumni\n\nin this game. Both groups will enj oy\n\nthe game and each will have mor e\n\nfun( ds).\n\nA new day has dawned for the college, with a new head, new plans and\n\nnew prospects. The new president,\n\nDr. Schaeffer, is alive to every p ossibility of developing the college as well\n\n1936]\n\nTHE FRANKLIN AND MARSHALL ALUMN\n\nas maintaininO' it be t traditions. He\n\nseeks the willing help of every\n\nalumnus in making this possible.\n\nA steering committee was appointed\n\nby Vice-chairman Hager, who presided at the meeting of :March 17, in\n\nthe unavoidable absence of Chairman\n\nSchnader. This committee consists of\n\nEdwin 1\\IL Hartman, Pd.D., '95, A.\n\nLeRoy Lightner, '04, William Shand,\n\n'08, Donald M. Mylin, '14, Louis S.\n\n:1\\'Iay, E q., '22, and J . Shober Barr,\n\n'24. It met with Secretary Robert J.\n\nPilgram, March 22, and decided on\n\nthe above plans.\n\nTwelve Scholarships\n\nOffered by the College\n\nTwelve scholarships of $250 allowance on the contingent fee have been\n\noffered by the college to high-school\n\ntudents who qualify in scholarship\n\nand character in ten districts of Pennsylvania and Maryland and two atlarge. This plan has been approved\n\nby the Board of Trustees, and district\n\ncommittees have been appointed to\n\npresent it to high schools in their sections.\n\nThe features of the award are as\n\nfollows:\n\nr\n\nGENERAL REGULATIONS\n\nA Scholarship Award for 19361937 is fixed at $250.00 a year. One-\n\n,.\n\nhalf of this sum will be credited on\n\nthe contingent fee for the first semester and the rest on that of the second\n\n. eme ter. The contingent fee is in\n\nlieu of tuition.\n\nThe Award will be continued\n\nthr ough the four y ears of the recipient 's course, provided he maintains a\n\natisfactory tandard of conduct and\n\ndoes cholastic work of such quality\n\na to place him in the upper twentyfiye p er cent of his class.\n\n85\n\nCONDITIONS OF ELIGIBILITY\n\nA candidate to be eligible must (a)\n\nhave the proper credits for entering\n\nFranklin and Marshall College; (b )\n\nrank in the upper twenty per cent of\n\nhis class.\n\nMETHOD OF APPLYING\n\nCandidates shall apply in the district where they reside (if such district has been organized), or if they\n\ndo not live in such a district they shall\n\napply directly to the college for a\n\nScholarship Award-at-large.\n\nThis\n\napplication should be made not later\n\nthan April 15 upon the form specially\n\nprepared for the purpose.\n\nMETHOD OF SELECTION\n\nTwelve Scholarship Awards will be\n\ngranted for the year 1936-1937.\n\nMost of these have been allotted to\n\nparticular districts and will be in\n\ncharge of district committees. One is\n\nreserved to be awarded at large and\n\nwill be awarded by a Faculty Committee at Franklin and Marshall\n\nCollege.\n\nBASIS OF SELECTION\n\nThe selection will be based upon\n\nfour groups of qualities, of which the\n\nfirst two are considered most important: (a) Literary and scholastic\n\nability and attainments; (b) Qualities\n\nof manhood, truth, courage, devotion\n\nto duty, sympathy, kindliness, unselfishness, and fellowship; ( c) Exhibition of moral force of character and\n\nof instincts to lead and to take an interest in his schoolmates, and ( d)\n\nPhysical vigor, as shown by interest\n\nin outdoor sports or in other ways.\n\nDistinction, both in character, personality and intellect, is the most important requirement, and it is upon\n\nthis that Committees will primarily\n\ninsist. Success in .being elected to\n\noffice in student organization is not\n\n86\n\nTHE FRA KLIN AND MARSH ALL ALUMNUS\n\nnecessarily evidence of leadership in\n\nthe true sense of the word. Leadership is regarded as consisting in moral\n\ncourage and interest in one's fellow\n\nmen quite as much as in the more\n\naggressive qualities. Physical vigor\n\nis an essential qualification, but athletic skill is of less importance than\n\nthe moral qualities developed in playing outdoor games.\n\n'l1he chairmen who have accepted\n\nthe leadership in this competition in\n\nthe various districts are as follows :\n\nFranklin County, Pa., and Western\n\nMaryland: Rev.

' '\n\nAnother profe sor accompanies the\n\nspeaker and meets with the Senior\n\nstudents who are thinking of going to\n\ncollege, answering any que tions in\n\nregard to the curriculum or other conditions of entering Franklin and Marshall. A start was made in this\n\nproject last year, in response to reque ts for such speeches, but the overture has been made this year by the\n\ncollege, with a proposed schedule of\n\npeaker and addres es to which the\n\nresponse has been excellent.\n\nMetals Expert Named Best Researcher\n\nNamed the year's outstanding man in the\n\nentire field of metallurgical reesarch and\n\ndevelopment in America, Robert F. Mehl,\n\nPh.D., '19, head of the Metallurgy Department of Carnegie, was chosen to give the\n\nInstitute of Metals lecture at the Technical\n\n, e ion of the American Institute of Mining\n\nand :Metallurgical Engineers. The choice js\n\nmade alternately from American and European scientists.\n\nDr. Mehl, the youngest American to be\n\ninvited to deli.er the address, spoke exhausti,ely on the subject \"Diffusion in Solid\n\n)fetals. ' ' His department at Carnegie is\n\n,en- acti.e in this study at the present time.\n\n7\n\nROBERT F. MEHL, PH.D., '19\n\nCarnegie Institute of Technology secured\n\nthe services of Dr. Mehl in the summer of\n\n1932. His position was to be director of the\n\nMetals Research Laboratory and professor in\n\nthe Metallurgical Department. In the fall\n\nof 1935 he was promoted to the head of the\n\ndepartment along with his other duties.\n\nT,Yo of the outstanding achievements of\n\nthis progressive scientist occurred in 1934,\n\nwhen he recefred the prize award of the\n\nAmerican Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers for the best scientific paper\n\nof the year; and the J olm Scott Medal\n\nfrom the city of Philadelphia for his work\n\nin the development of Gamma-ray radiography. H e also holds executive positions with\n\nthe American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, '' Metals and Alloys,''\n\nthe American Societ y of Metals, and the\n\nAmerican Society for testing materials.\n\nDr. Mehl decried the lacK of support of\n\nScientific Research in the general field of\n\nmetallurgy, emphasizing the extensive use of\n\nmetals in nearly every industry.

In addition, it\n\nheld Fordham University to a 14-7 score,\n\ntied Richmond 6-6, and defeated Geneva,\n\n19-12, P. M. C., 14-0, and Moravian, 28-0.\n\nIn cross-country running, in .the same conference, it lost one of four meets, winning\n\nthe trophy, having already won a cup by\n\nthree years' previous victories.\n\nIts swimming team, coached by a student\n\n,von all of its meets and the conference title'\n\nagainst Penn, Delaware, Johns Hopkins'\n\nCarnegie Tech, Pitt and Cornell.\n\n'\n\nThe basketball team, a runner-up in pre,ious seasons_ in the conference, crashed\n\nthrough to win the cup with 11 victories and\n\n1 defeat, winning 2 other games outside of\n\nthe conference.\n\nAbove all, the wrestling team, developed\n\nby Coach Charles W. Mayser from raw material, only one of the wrestlers having seen\n\na bout before he came to college won meets\n\n\" ·ith Chicago, Gallaudet, Gettysb~ug Miami\n\nPitt, Temple, Tufts and West Point only\n\nlosing one meet by a score of ls-'16 to\n\nMichigan. The record of this team for 12\n\nseasons shows 91 victories 14 defeats and\n\n2 ties, one with Chicago ~nd one with the\n\nArmy.\n\nIn its last meet with the Army held in\n\nLancaster on Saturday night, March 7 West\n\nPoint had only 32 seconds ' time adv;ntage\n\nin the entire meet, being defeated 34-0. In\n\naddition to the teams mentioned, it has also\n\ndefeated Penn, Princeton, Duke, Syracuse\n\nW. and L., Rutgers, C. C. of N . Y., M . I. T.:\n\nand other leading institutions in past years.\n\nOf special significance is the fact that a\n\nsmall but unusually capable corps of coaches\n\ndevelops the athletes who have made this\n\nsuccessful record. Coach Alan Holman, 1930\n\ncaptain of Ohio State, who has been at\n\nFranklin an d Marshall for five seasons, in a\n\nsquaid of 38 players, had 2 boys, including a\n\nco-captain, who had never played football\n\nbefore coming to college; 2 others 1,ho h ad\n\nnever been on a railroad train before going\n\nto play Fordham in New York; and one wh o\n\nhad never heard a talkie. Not tha t these\n\nboys were hill billies, but that they came\n\nfrom small towns.\n\nAnother gratifying fact is that 5 of the 10\n\nwrestlers were on the Dean's List of h on or\n\nstu dents and one of these, also a football\n\nplayer, was in the first ten of his class. N ot\n\none athlete in major sports is on probation .\n\nCoach Mayser says, \"It takes brains to\n\nwrestle.''\n\nThe college has developed its own successful basketball coach in J. Shober Barr, ' 24,\n\nwho was captain of the 1923 football t eam\n\nand has been on the coaching sta ff for ten\n\nyears, tutoring Frosh football and varsity\n\nbasketball.\n\nCoach Mayser, formerly of Iowa Sta t e College, where he made a record as a wrestling\n\ncoach, and who came to F. & M. in 1 922,\n\ncompletes the coaching trio, only three m en\n\nfor all sports.\n\nA valuable assistant is Tom Floyd, trainer,\n\nwho came from Penn this year, and con ditioned the men so well that time was nev er\n\ncalled for an F . & M. injury in football or\n\nbasketball games, and only one footb all\n\nplayer was unable to get into any g ame\n\nbecause of injuries.\n\nThe teams representing F. & M. this year\n\nin five major sports have lost only 4 even t s,\n\ntwo in football, one in basketball a nd on e\n\nin wrestling. This success has not b een of\n\na skyrocket variety but is the culminati on\n\nof efficient coaching and consistent playing.\n\nSports Banquet For F. & M . Teams\n\nMajor John L. Griffiths, of Chicago, ch a i rman of athletics in the Big Ten Confer en ce\n\nand president of the National Collegiate\n\nAthletic Association, will be the principal\n\nspeaker at the banquet to be t ender ed the\n\nathletic teams of Franklin and Marshall College.\n\n1936]\n\nTHE FRANKLIN A D MARSHALL ALUM US\n\nThe affair, termed a '' commuuity tribute\n\nto the athletic standards and achievements\n\nof F. and M. teams,'' will be sponsored by\n\nthe Chamber of Commerce in cooperation\n\n\"\"ith the Manufacturers' Association, Foremen 's Club and the Lancaster County\n\nAlumni Association.\n\nThe dinner, the first of its kind in this\n\ncity, will be held on Thursday night, April\n\n23, in the Hotel Brunswick, and Lancaster\n\nCounty alumni and friends of the college are\n\ninvited to attend.\n\nSix teams, including four championship\n\noutfits, will be honored at the communitywide affair.

They defeated West Point before\n\na crowded armory, 35- 0. The scores :\n\nGallaudet, Jan. 11, Biesecker Gym, 33-5\n\nMichigan, Jan. 17, Armory, 16-18\n\nUrsinus, Jan. 18, Gym, 33-5\n\nGettysburg, Jan. 21, Gym, 24-8\n\nTufts, Feb. 3, Armory, 31-5\n\nMiami (Fla.), Feb. 8, Armory, 26½-7 ½\n\nChicago, Feb. 15, Armory, 23½-4½\n\nPittsburgh, Feb. 22, Armory, 38-6\n\nTemple, Feb. 29, Gym, 28½- 4½\n\nWest Point, Mar. 7, Armory, 34-0\n\nDuring the season, the Franklin and Marshall 1Yrestlers scored 298½ points to their\n\nopponents' 55½, with 48 falls, 18 time advantages, 4 bouts won by forfeit and 3 draws.\n\nCoach Charles Mayser took H enry Raab, 155\n\nlbs. and George Hetrick, 175 lbs., to Washington and L ee for a post-season trial in the\n\nNational Collegiate Wrestling tournamen t.\n\nRaab drew two of the toughest assignments\n\nin his class when he met Elmer Nazworthy,\n\nOklahoma Aggies' great little wrestler and\n\nDick Bishop, Eastern Collegiate 155 titleholder from L ehigh. He made a great show-\n\n94\n\nTHE FRANKLI N AND MARSHALL ALUMNUS\n\ning and ,ms judged by some '1:o be the\n\nsuperior of his class, although Bishop was\n\ngiven the honor. Hetrick, who was not defeated during the season, drew Raymond\n\nVogel of the United States Naval Academy\n\nas his first opponent and lost to him, but\n\nregistered a fall over Eddie Paquette of St.\n\nLawrence, Kansas, in 30 seconds, being\n\nfinally eliminated by Harry Broadbent, of\n\nOklahoma University, in 11 minutes and 33\n\nseconds.\n\nIt would seem from this that these two at\n\nleast are the best in their class in the East.\n\nBasketball Results in Winning Cup\n\nThe basketball team under Coach J. Shober\n\nBarr, '24, won the Conference cup for the\n\nfirst time this year, v,ith 11 victories and one\n\ndefeat, and that one at the hands of Albright.\n\nIt also won two games fl om Dickinson. The\n\nfinal game with Gettysburg, which was runner-up, was thrilling, as the winning of the\n\ncup depended largely upon this game, \" ·hich\n\nwas won handily.\n\nA post-season game was played by invitation with T emple University in the Palestra,\n\nPhiladelphia, as a try-out for the Olympics,\n\nin District 2. It was nip and tuck all the\n\nway, with F . & M . leading 16-15 at the half\n\nand finally losing in the last five minutes by\n\na score of 30-35. Its playing deserved and\n\nreceived high praise.

All the\n\nplants now existing have come from the original slip brought back by Bartram in his saddle bag, planted in his Philadelphia Garden,\n\nand named for his friend, Benjamin\n\nFranklin. The tree is about five years old\n\nand has been planted in front of the president's house by suggestion of Dr. H.

It seeks to increase the student body, which has\n\nfallen off twelve per cent in the past five years from the high mark of 759, and\n\nat the same time to attract students of scholastic proficiency.\n\nThe alumni, we are sure, will welcome the opportunity to support the new\n\npresident in his six-point plan to advance the interests of their college. Such\n\nsupport will show itself in recommending Franklin and Marshall to boys of\n\ntheir acquaintance who wish to enter college and also in making a contribution\n\nto the college which will enable President Schaeffer to carry on his work\n\nwithout fear of a deficit.\n\nThe proud record of Franklin and Marshall in coming through these\n\ndepression years without a deficit must be maintained, and we are sure that\n\nour alumni will rally to Promote the President's Program with the students\n\nand gifts they will send.\n\nMake Fun Out of the Fund\n\nIt almost seems as if we alumni of Franklin and Marshall have been taking\n\nthe College Fund too seriously, so much so in fact as to restrict our contributions. Perhap~ we have been \"pressing\" too hard, a common fault in golf.\n\nThe suo-gestion is made that we lighten our approach, our touch, if you please,\n\nby regarding this as more in the nature of a sport, and make a game of it.\n\nA friend who was asked to head the Richmond, Va., Welfare Fund campaign several years ago, said that he would do so on condition that they take\n\nthe \"d\" out of Fund. He said: \"D\" stands for danger, disaster, disease, depre ion, death, the devil and other bad things. Let's take it out of Fund, and\n\nha-ve Fun.' ' The suggestion was accepted and the Richmond Welfare Fund\n\nwa rai ed in full, breaking previous records, and they had fun raising it.\n\nWould it not be a good idea for us to combine this idea with a friendly\n\nrivalry with Gettysburg College, which raised over $7,000 for a imilar Loyalty\n\nFund la t year, the third year of its operation 1 Franklin and Marshall has\n\nshown it ability to surpass the Bullets in football, basketball, wrestling, and\n\ncross-countr y runs this year and there is no r eason why we should be inferior\n\nto them in our loyal giving to our college. We have more students, a larger\n\nalumni group and as much means. Surely we have as much spirit. Let's beat\n\nthem in this sport, too !\n\n100\n\nTHE FRANKLIN AND MARSHALL ALUMNUS\n\n[MARCH\n\nAlumni Notes\n\n1884\n\nG.

Small, Ph.D., Sc.D., '92, emeritus\n\ncurator of the New York Botanical Garden,\n\nhas again added to his more than 300 publications a valuable work entitled '' Ferns of\n\nthe Vicinity of r ew York'' with specific\n\nillustrations of the chief types by noted\n\nartists. A lack of a book on the ferns of\n\n[l\\IARCH\n\nthe local flora prompted the publication,\n\nbased mainly on collections of ferns preserved in the herbarium of the rew York\n\nBotanical Garden. The text, co,ering 285\n\npages, and describing not only the gross\n\nanatomy of each species, but also the geological and geographical habitat, is couched\n\nin pure Anglo-Saxon terminology and the old\n\nconfusing division of ferns into simple or\n\nnatural and complex or unnatural groups has\n\nbeen abandoned and the fern plants involved\n\nhave been interpreted in more simple or natural generic concepts. The Board of Directors of the N. Y. B. G. calls this book one of\n\nits two most important publications of last\n\nyear.\n\nIt may be of additional interest to learn\n\nthat Dr. Small wrote this book while on his\n\nback after a serious automobile accident that\n\noccurred in Florida and involved the fracture\n\nof both legs, and confined him to the sick bed\n\nfor four months.\n\now the convalescent invalid announces a new book for 1936, entitled: '' Illustrated Manual of the Ferns of\n\nthe Southeastern Flora,'' descriptions of the\n\nfern-plants growing naturally in the states\n\nsouth of the Virginia-Kentucky state boundary and east of the Mississippi River, with\n\nnotes on the distribution, history and culture\n\nof the species. Verily there seems to be no\n\nlimit to the creative energy of this unparalleled master of scientific research.\n\nHenry S. Gehman, Ph.D., S.T.D., '09,\n\nprofessor of Old Testament Literature\n\nPrinceton Theological Seminary, is a~\n\nequally prolific writer along different lines\n\nand it is hard to keep track of all his publications. One of his more recent ones appeared in Vol. 55 of the J ournal of the\n\nAmerican Oriental Society and is entitled:\n\n'' The Garrett Sahidic )ianuscript of t.\n\nLuke,'' illustrated by one specimen plate.\n\nIt is an interpretation of the Garrett manuscript which is written in well-drawn uncials\n\non parchment and probably was copied in the\n\nsixth century.\n\nDr. Gehman has also written an article\n\non '' Maimonides and Islam'' published in\n\n'' The M osleni World.'' H e also translated\n\nlast summer from the Pali language, a book\n\nof Buddhist ghost stories, the \"Pali Vatthu.
