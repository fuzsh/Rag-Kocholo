Charles loved Lancaster so much that he returned 25 years later to do another Master's, this time in Cybersecurity and gained a distinction, of which, he was very proud! After his graduation in 1997, Charles moved to Knutsford, Cheshire and secured his first job working for NNC. Here, he was awarded Graduate Trainee of the Year. He then went on to work in IT for EDS for 15 years and then DEFRA as a contractor, which he really enjoyed.\n\nOn his return to Lancaster in 2018, he was especially pleased that, at the age of 43 he could beat the younger Freshers at the rowing challenge! Charles loved badminton and enjoyed playing during his first time at Lancaster. He was also passionate about Computing, LUBBS, his friends and Friday Night bar crawls. His favourite place, though, had to be Pizzetta Republica! He died peacefully, surrounded by the love of his family and leaves behind his alumna wife, formerly of Cartmel College (French and German Studies, 1999). They were married on 24 June 2000 and he leaves behind his two children, Ella (18) and Isaac (15).

Ian was key to the success of the Lancaster Low Temperature group, working with Professors Tony Guenault and George Pickett. He used his skills to build “dilution refrigerators” which enabled the group to achieve the worlds’ coldest temperature, as well as much pioneering work in the field. Unashamedly, Ian declared that he was “self-taught” and “didn’t understand the working of fridges”, as these complex low temperature environments were called. Nonetheless, the work would have been impossible without Ian’s skills, and good working relationships within the group. George Pickett, now a Distinguished Professor, said that Ian’s work was crucial to him being awarded a Fellowship of the Royal Society. Ian’s work has been nationally recognised by the award of the new Royal Society Hauksbee Award, created to acknowledge and reward excellence in supporting science in the UK. In addition, Ian was awarded the MBE. He received this in person at the palace. True to style, this was against his wishes, but he was “outvoted” by the family. For all these honours, Ian told me that his most treasured award was the Fellowship of the University, presented by the then-Chancellor Sir Chris Bonnington at a private dinner hosted by the Vice-Chancellor Professor Mark Smith. Ian’s funeral took place on Thursday 24th August. True to the man, it was without prior announcement and with minimum formality; family only, no tributes and he was taken from home to grave with no ceremony. Ian is survived by his wife Val, and children Sally and Peter. He leaves behind a legacy to low temperature physics, and a memory in the hearts and minds of those who knew him. (Dr Ted Walker, Lancaster 1972-1978.)\n\nMarion Garner died on 9 August 2023, after a short illness. She was 84 and survived by her son David.

He was a prominent member of Lancaster University Management School, and the wider academic community. His expertise in forecasting and inventory management was honoured internationally. As well as teaching undergraduate and postgraduate students, and supervising PhD candidates, he was the Director of the Centre for Marketing Analytics and Forecasting. A full tribute to Professor John Boylan is to available on the University website.\n\nDavid Reid (Physics, 1978, Cartmel) died on 8 June 2023, having lived with cancer for more than 2 and a half years. He died at home and at peace and throughout his illness, although not able to be as physically active - he had been a runner and keen cyclist - his brain was as busy as ever. David loved music, books, pictures and thinking. He continued to work on his photography, taking off in many directions from the quirky to the beautiful. He became a lecturer, first at Derby and then at Nottingham Trent University where he worked until he retired. David was a generous and inspiring teacher. He brought warmth and humour to his teaching with a lightness of touch which made complex ideas accessible. His engagement with the world was eclectic and multi-faceted; a richness of outlook that embraced the lives of many. David collaborated with a wide range of people from the worlds of contemporary music, art and photography. He leaves an important body of work that includes many sound and video recordings of contemporary music, alongside numerous experimental sound works and an extensive collection of photographs, which he worked on almost until the end.\n\nDr Barry Hunt, formerly of the Department of Chemistry, passed away on 6th June 2023. Barry was first an Experimental Officer and then a Research Officer in the Department of Chemistry at Lancaster from 1967 until 1999, and ran the polymer characterisation facility within the Department. He gained his PhD during his time at Lancaster under the supervision of Professor John Bevington, the first Head of Department. In subsequent research, Barry collaborated with many colleagues in Chemistry, Physics and Environmental Sciences: work that was subsequently published in a wide range of journals and book chapters, and at national and international conferences. Barry also taught aspects of polymer chemistry, principally on master's courses in polymer science and on various short courses in polymers; he also supervised many master's students on six-month industrial placements. In 1999, Barry moved with other members of the Lancaster polymer group to the University of Sheffield where he continued his research, teaching and supervision up until his retirement in 2008. Post retirement, Barry vigorously pursued many activities not least through his memberships of the Morecambe yacht club, the Lancaster and Morecambe Astronomical Society, and a local ukelele orchestra. Barry's most notable achievement in retirement was in helping to crew a catamaran safely across the Atlantic from Florida to Morecambe via the Azores.\n\nEmily Morgan (Theatre Studies, Culture & Communication, 1998, County) who worked for more than two decades for ITV News, latterly the ITV News' health and science editor died aged 45 after a short illness.

Born in Kendal, Michael obtained a Hastings Scholarship to The Queen’s College, University of Oxford, and in 1964 became one of the first Physics postgraduates at the then ‘new’ University of Lancaster. He built his first Low Temperature laboratory in the city; his second at Bailrigg; a third at Bedford College University of London; and a fourth at Royal Holloway University where he was appointed Professor of Physics. His main research interests were in experimental Low Temperature Physics and he published over 150 research papers on Metal and Superconductors; Quantum Fluids; Cryogenic Techniques; Piezoelectrics and Semiconductors, Particle and Dark Matter Detection; Two-dimensional electrons and Quantum Computing. His most recent paper was published in Phys.Rev.Lett. in 2017. Colleagues have described him as ‘brilliant’, ‘remarkable’, and a ‘wonderful individual’. ‘Through his important work on electrons on helium and associated international collaborations, he truly paved the way for the current resurgence of the topic as a pathway to quantum computing’. On retirement he became an Emeritus Professor of the University of London. Back in 1964 Michael met his wife Katherine (Kate), an undergraduate at Lancaster and they married in 1966. Both developed a passion for the Arctic and they spent many summers out in the wilds of Greenland, Svalbard and Baffin Island making sound recordings of birds and narwhal. They visited Inuit settlements in North-West Greenland and used inflatable boats to explore the fjords of North East Greenland. Here they rarely encountered anybody else, but had significant encounters with wolves, musk-oxen and polar bears. Their most memorable boating trip was a circumnavigation of Clavering Island. This had its hairy moments, particularly trying to find leads through the pack ice towing a second boat and being increasingly forced further away from the shore - dangerous yes, but exhilarating and memorable! Michael became President of both the Arctic Club and the Scottish Arctic Club, served on the Gino Watkins Committee awarding grants to arctic expeditions, and set up the Arctic Club website.Retiring back to Westmorland, they tackled many new projects; editing a newsletter for the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society; taking 33 members on a ‘pilgrimage’ round the Saga sites of Iceland; publishing a new edition of W G Collingwood’s Letters from Iceland; saving and raising the profile of old cast-iron fingerposts in Cumbria and raising money to restore a local tithe barn.\n\nProfessor Emeritus John Burgoyne, formerly of Lancaster University Management School, passed away on 22 April 2023 after a short illness.

Jean continued to live in Wray after Michael’s death. It was only in her latter years that she and her older sister Patricia Davies were able to share both of their WWII intelligence careers, and they jointly published a book of their experiences, Celebrating Sisters: our secret war. A further volume is scheduled for publication. Jean was also a strong supporter of Lancaster Concerts.\n\nSimon Emmerson (Independent Studies, 1978, Bowland) founder of bands and music producer, passed away on 13 March 2023.

Alongside his studies at Lancaster, Simon showed an early talent for broadcasting, hosting an Alternative Music show on Radio Bailrigg. It became a proving ground for the charismatic TV presenting skills for which he would later become famous. Born in Morpeth but raised in Grantham, Simon was a lifelong Newcastle United fan. He loved football and golf in almost equal measure – passions that consumed him both professionally and recreationally in his later years. After graduating, Simon moved to London and by the late-1980s began teaching in a TEFL school off Oxford Street. He moved to Spain in the early 1990s, to teach at an English language school in Santander, before settling down to work and raise a family in Barcelona, the city he called home for 30 years. Tragically, Simon’s wife Alex died in 2000, when their son, Jordi, was just three years old. In 2003, he published a successful travel guide to Barcelona, but around 15 years ago began working with Barcelona TV commentating on lower league Argentinian games. He later became instrumental in the operation and broadcasting of LaLiga TV as a commentator, pundit and presenter – becoming the English voice of Spanish football. Fluent in Spanish, he could also broadcast effortlessly in his adoptive tongue. His work was appreciated by numerous colleagues and friends, among whom he could count Steve Archibald, Gaizka Mendieta and Gustavo Poyet. Simon had an eclectic love and encyclopaedic knowledge of music and was an avid fan of David Bowie, Roxy Music, Iggy Pop, Stevie Wonder, Motown, Funk, and Soul. He loved literature, cinema, was an Alfred Hitchcock aficionado, and possessed an impish wit and a wicked sense of humour.\n\nPaul Terence Jarman (Accounting & Finance, 1988, Fylde) died 14 December 2022 after a long battle with colon cancer. Paul, or as he was usually known PJ, started his University life in 1985 living in Block 2. He was Fylde JCR secretary during 1986,and famously stood for Sports Rep in 1987 despite being in 3rd year. His speech that day lived long in the memory for the cheer and chuckles it brought. That was PJ, he was full of life - he took his studies and learning seriously, but he loved a laugh, and was able to make others laugh in many ways. His was also known for his beloved Rover P series he drove onto campus many a day, and as a regular in Fylde Bar, usually enjoying a pint of Guinness or 6. After graduating, Paul pursued a long and successful career in fund management, most latterly managing the pension fund for British Gas. After taking early retirement Paul continued investing in stocks and shares, always looking to buck the market. His work colleagues at his celebration service described him as extremely smart and one of the best stock market analysts and investors they had ever come across. Paul spent the last 30 years of his life living in the Isle of Dogs. He always enjoyed challenging himself at new pastimes, including gaining his pilot licence, learning to play the piano songwriting or re-working vintage bikes. He made the most of life, travelling extensively and watching his beloved Queens Park Rangers. Paul throughout his life remained a private person, and never truly knew how loved and admired he was - he faced his illness with strength and positivity as best he could, and was at peace at the end.\n\nTony Ede (Economics, 1970 Bowland, then Fylde), died 12 December 2022 aged 74. Born in Surrey he grew up in Claygate. Tony passed the entrance exam to enable him to attend the Royal Grammar School Guildford. Whilst there, Tony earned the nickname “Speed” by excelling at cross country, winning school races and representing the county. By the third year, Tony was put into an Express stream that took O levels a year early. Tony’s quiet rebellious nature proved a little much for his parents and an argument over whether he could drop Latin for Politics resulted in Tony being sent to Leyton Park, a Quaker Boarding school for his sixth form.\n\nTony went on to study Economics at Lancaster, where he developed his passion for everything financial and was elected chair of the RAG committee, raising funds for various charities including purchasing a WRVS library van. Fundraising stunts included an auction of fellow students, and wheelbarrow races. His highlight was being described as “a long haired hippy” by the Guardian for heckling the Queen about paying tax. Tony was very proud of these youthful anti establishmentarian endeavours. After graduation Tony got a job with the Co-op.\n\nTony worked for the Manchester City Council for 35 years, culminating with being made Head of Special Projects. Projects included the Manchester Olympic Games bid (laying the ground for the successful Manchester Commonwealth games in 2002) and successfully securing funding for infrastructure such as the Manchester velodrome, the ice rink and the Bridgewater Hall. He was particularly proud of buying a statue using national government and EU funding, resulting in a freebie for the council. Tony’s hardset principles and strength of character were evident in the office too, crossing the picket line in the late 1980’s when his colleagues disputed their wages (believing his own wages to be fair). Tony retired in 2008, where he filled his time participating with the Marple Neighbourhood forum, keeping as active as possible and caring for his wife Elizabeth (who has suffered her own health troubles in recent years). He leaves Elizabeth, a son, Denzil, and daughter Tamsin.\n\nMartin Eaden (Economics and Politics, 1972, County)died suddenly at his home on 9 November 2022 aged 73. Martin was born in Elsecar, South Yorkshire. After leaving Lancaster, Martin enjoyed a long career in social work as a highly respected and much sought-after manager of children’s services, eventually retiring as Deputy Director of Social Services in North East Lincolnshire, where he had played a large part in turning around a failing service. Martin gave key evidence to The Bichard Enquiry into two child deaths. Martin played rugby at Lancaster and was a keen supporter of many sports, especially cricket and horseracing. He met his first wife, Jenny (nee Jordan) at Lancaster and leaves behind two children by his first marriage, two step-children by his second marriage to Tracy and nine grandchildren from the two marriages, for whom he provided an endless supply of fun, encouragement and guidance.\n\nPhilip Lowton (Accounting & Finance, 1987, Pendle) passed away on 15 October 2022 following a short battle with pancreatic cancer. Philip had a very successful career as a chartered accountant and leaves behind his wife and three wonderful children.

The family are raising funds in his memory for the early detection of pancreatic cancer. https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/philiplowton\n\nHarold Garth Dales, known as Garth, Professor of Pure Mathematics died on 8 October 2022. He joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in 2011, following a successful period as Professor of Mathematics at Leeds. He was born and grew up in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire before he studied mathematics at Queens’ College Cambridge, becoming a PhD student of Graham Allen. Following a period as a lecturer at Glasgow, he joined Leeds University in 1973 where he helped to establish a group in functional analysis. His specialism was Banach algebras and, following the precedent of Barry Johnson, he developed automatic continuity theory for homomorphisms. This subject is notable for two results: Johnson’s uniqueness-of-norm theorem for semisimple Banach algebras, and the resolution of Kaplansky’s conjecture, showing that the algebra of continuous functions on an infinite compact space always admits discontinuous homomorphisms. The latter result was obtained independently by Garth Dales and Jean Esterle, and is a rare instance where the axioms of set theory impinge upon relatively standard objects in analysis. For this work, Garth was awarded a Whitehead Prize by the London Mathematical Society in 1980. Garth collaborated with prominent analysts in several countries and he enjoyed a high profile as a speaker at international conferences, collaborating with mathematicians from five continents. In 1974 he co-organized with Bill Bade and Phil Curtis at UCLA the first meeting of what subsequently developed into the biennial International Conference on Banach Algebras and Applications. He served as the Chair of the Steering Committee of this conference series for many years and, impressively, attended all 24 meetings of it, until his health no longer allowed him to travel to the 25th meeting, held this summer.\n\nHe was also a stalwart supporter of national organizations such as the London Mathematical Society, which he served as an editor and as a Council Member, the British Mathematical Colloquium, of which he organized a highly successful meeting in Leeds in 2000, celebrating the new millennium, and the North British Functional Analysis Seminar, which he served as treasurer. On his retirement from Leeds, he joined the Analysis group at Lancaster, and he contributed through undergraduate teaching, PhD supervision and publishing several substantial papers that featured in the recent REF submissions. He moved to Bentham, from where he enjoyed the view of Ingleborough from the window of his study.\n\nDr Paul Blackwell, Senior Teaching Fellow in Project Management passed away on 25 September 2022. Tragically he was diagnosed with cancer shortly after joining Lancaster, although he continued to work throughout his treatment. Paul was a graduate of the University of Huddersfield (BSc), The University of Birmingham (MRes) and Cranfield University (EngD). He returned to academia following a long career in the United Kingdom Civil Service where he worked in the Cost Analysis and Assurance Service (CAAS) function of the Ministry of Defence at Barrow Shipyard. His team were responsible for providing cost assurance on the Astute and successor (now known as the Dreadnought) submarine programmes. The Dreadnought class is the future replacement for the Vanguard class of ballistic missile submarines, which carry the Trident II D-5 missile systems, the principle of operation of the ‘Continuous At Sea Deterrence’ (CASD) since April 1969. Following his doctorate, Paul was appointed as a research Fellow at Cranfield University, and later at Manchester University, before his appointment as Senior Lecturer in Risk Management and Project Cost Management at Manchester. Paul’s natural ability to bring to life his expertise gleaned from working on the submarine programmes was widely recognised and valued by students and staff alike. Paul was a very active in teaching and academic scholarship, both at Manchester and Lancaster. Paul truly excelled as a lecturer. His talents included an ability to integrate the world of practice with the world of theory enabling him to make a significant and lasting impact on the students that he taught and supervised. This direct connection to the actuality of working on major defence projects provided students with an opportunity to go beyond the theoretical knowledge and understand at a deeper level the difference that can make that real difference in contemporary project management practice. Paul will also be fondly remembered by his colleagues for his spirit of collegiality and his positive approach to the challenges that he faced during his time with us. It is a testimony to his passion for teaching and education that he continued to work throughout his illness. Paul’s only regret about his time with us was that he felt that the students had not got the best out of him due to his illness.\n\nEmeritus Professor Carol Thomas from the Division of Health Research passed away on 22 September 2022. Carol was a Professor in Sociology in DHR, specialising in disability studies and the sociology of health and illness until 2018 when she retired from the University due to ill health.

Peter joined the University as a Biochemistry technician in the mid 1960s when departments were still based in St Leonard's House whilst the main Bailrigg campus was being built. He provided research support to Dr Frank Heaton as well as helping with the Biochemistry course practicals. In 1977 he left to study at Sheffield University where he gained a BSc Hons in Natural Environmental Sciences. This was followed by a DPhil in the University of York where his research on the effects of fertiliser on plant growth was supervised by Professor Alistair Fitter. Upon completion of his research in York in 1983, he returned to the Department of Biological Sciences at Lancaster where he held a number of short-term research posts investigating the effects of pollution on plant growth working with Professor Terry Mansfield FRS. He helped to develop one of the best solar dome facilities in the world for studying impacts of air pollution and climate change at the Field Station (where Infolab now stands). In retirement he enjoyed climbing, travelling, cycling and walking and was the honorary librarian for the Fell & Rock Climbing Club, organising the relocation of its books and journals from the University Library to the Armitt Museum in Ambleside. Prizes in his name are to be awarded to outstanding PhD students in the field of plant physiology, including Plant and Crop Science, in LEC.\n\nArthur Davies, former University Librarian, died on 23 August 2022. He first joined the University in 1963 as Assistant Librarian, part of a small team temporarily based in a former stained-glass works at 23 Castle Hill. Here he helped develop the library’s collections in preparation for the admission of the first students in 1964. In 1966 he moved to Leeds University as Deputy Librarian. He returned to Lancaster in 1976 as its second Librarian, succeeding Graham Mackenzie and served until his retirement in September 1994.

Dennett Malcolm Winterburn (“Den”) was a part of the 1964-1967 “Pioneer Group” of Lancaster Graduates. He was born in Liverpool in 1945, living in a poor single parent family with his mother and much-loved sister. The family found life very difficult and soon moved in with Den’s grandfather, a carpenter who encouraged Den to read and study hard and this helped him to pass the 11+ enabling entry to Holt High School. After his grandfather’s death, Den moved in to live with the family of a school friend forming a life-long friendship. Throughout Den’s teenage years he was a regular at the Cavern Club where he witnessed the early days of the Beatles whose music continued to inspire him all his life. After leaving school Den worked on a newspaper in the north-east of England and then came to Lancaster University where he obtained a degree majoring in French and then went on to do a MA in Psychology at Leeds University. He joined United Biscuits where he became a Director in the Food Division in 1982. Deciding that he would like to branch out on his own, in 1989 he founded “Imagine Consultants”, a highly successful HR consultancy, working with people in industry, government and schools to build teams of senior executives and to facilitate personal development of staff, students and employees. Den met his wife-to-be Pat well before his university days and he was regularly travelling between Lancaster and Liverpool at weekends. They were married for 53 years, but sadly she suffered Alzheimer’s through which he and his two sons supported her to up her death in February last year. Den was one of the founders of the Lancaster ‘64 graduates, an alumni group of 1967 graduates who have met for reunion lunches and have a WhatsApp group which consists of more than 40 graduates spread across the world. They have communicated regularly with each other since July 2019. Den will be sadly missed by his two sons, Phil and Dan and two granddaughters as well as all of his colleagues from those pioneering years. In his retirement Den enjoyed the company of his family and friends, travel, walking and cycling and the juke box that was his big treat to himself where he could listen to his favourite Beatles music.\n\nFred Anthony Broster (PhD Chemistry, 1972, Cartmel, BA Chemistry, 1969, Biological Sciences) died July 2022.\n\nBenedetta Liorsi, (PhD English, 2017, MA English Literary Studies, 2012) died unexpectedly on 23 June 2022 from a heart attack as a complication of hydrocephalus. A tribute written by her partner and former member of Lancaster University, Chris Witter is available on the main University website.\n\nDerek Kingsland, (Engineering, 1973, Furness) aged 71 who was in the first Engineering intake at Lancaster, died from pancreatic cancer on 23 June 2022.

Born on 17th December 1942 in Barnstaple, Devon, Michael spent his early years enjoying the coast and countryside of North Devon. His family later moved to Lytham St Annes where he went to the local Grammar School and then in 1962 on to Birmingham University to study for his first degree in Geography. After three years he graduated and gained a scholarship at Columbia University, New York, before returning to Britain in 1966 then starting at Lancaster University as one of the first research students in Environmental Sciences. His research investigated land and sea level changes in his home area of south-west Lancashire. Painstaking and careful field and laboratory work led to the overturning of long held views about sea-level changes in the area and in addition to securing him his PhD, initiated a steady stream of academic articles and two books on the topic with the latest appearing in 2013. In 1969 he secured a temporary lectureship in Geography at Durham University, which soon became a permanent post, and with this security he expanded his geographical area of research to further parts of Britain as well as to a number of locations overseas (Brazil, Bangladesh and The Maldives). Together with his wife, Rosanna, it was in the 1980s that Michael extended his research interests to include studies of the 19thcentury garden designer Gertrude Jekyll. This interest in garden design was extended both to his own gardens and latterly, after retirement, to the design of gardens for others. He continued teaching and research at Durham throughout the 1980s and was promoted to Senior Lecturer, Reader and ultimately to a personal chair in 1993, which was in recognition of his outstanding international research reputation. However, in 1995 he was persuaded to move further north to a chair in the Geography Department at St Andrews University. Michael continued to live in Fife after he retired from St Andrews University in 1999, and took up a post at Kingston University until 2003. His continuing research and publication of land and sea-level changes in Lancashire led to a further recognition by Lancaster University with the award of a DSc in 2004. However, after he retired fully from academic posts, he concentrated his interests on writing further articles and taking on commissions to plan garden designs. He was always busy and was working on new projects until recently, although his last couple of years were dogged by ill health. As well as being a thorough field and laboratory researcher, Michael was an excellent teacher and was highly respected by both academics and members of the public. (Peter Cundill, St Andrews)\n\nCora Martin, former staff member, passed away in May 2022. Cora arrived in Lancaster in 1970 as the Administrative Officer in the Physics Department, then moving to Student Services where she had a long and distinguished career, making many lifetime friends of the students she had helped from all corners of the globe. Full obituary on the Lancaster University obituaries page.\n\nNicholas J Millward (MA Business Analysis, 1977, Fylde) died in April 2022. Nick worked for a US-owned company as Financial Director and worked on various international projects. He enjoyed a long and happy retirement.\n\nHarry Goulbourne (History, 1971, Cartmel) died on 17 April 2022. He came to Britain from Jamaica with the Windrush migration at the age of 10 and was to reach distinction as one of the UK’s first black professors. He published about a dozen books focusing on race and ethnicity, including Ethnicity and Nationalism in Post-Imperial Britain (1991) and Race Relations in Britain since 1945 (1998); a few were co-authored with others, such as Caribbean Families in the Atlantic World (2000, with Mary Chamberlain). Harry contributed vitally to the growing topic of transnationalism, the interaction of national cultures, that flourished in historical and social science studies in these years, as his research also enhanced the nascent subject of Caribbean Studies. His immersion in higher education began at Lancaster University, where he took a degree in History in 1971. Harry was elected Cartmel JCR president in his very first year and was prominent in the student activism of that period. He also won the respect of his history tutors, and his degree carried him to Sussex University to pursue a doctorate. His brother-in-law, Vince Cable, acknowledged Harry’s debt to Lancaster in his funeral eulogy. Harry was moving away from history towards political sociology, and, keen to learn of the Third World, posts of eight years at the University of Dar es Salaam and six at the University of the West Indies were important in deepening his interest in transnational and comparative studies. These experiences also raised questions about his own identity. On one occasion in Tanzania, a student anonymously charged him with being an agent of imperialism, and while he easily refuted that, he did have difficulty persuading people that he was not an American, as black visitors from abroad were expected to be. In 1980 Harry returned to this country and quickly became a leader in his field here, at first at the University of Warwick, and later at London South Bank University, where he was a professor of sociology. He died on Easter Sunday and is remembered as a man who was both intrepid and gentle, cherishing deep friendships from around the globe, and not least as a staunch family man. He is survived by his wife Selina, his two sons Hugh and Neil, and three grandchildren, Benedict, Clara, and Lily.

Full obituary on the Lancaster University obituaries page.\n\nMark Wheeler, Lecturer in South East European Studies at Lancaster from 1975 to 1983 passed away on 7 April 2022. He was Official Historian of the Special Operations Executive in Yugoslavia during the Second World War and later political advisor to Paddy, Lord Ashdown, High Representative for Bosnia and Hercegovina. He was one of the great scholars of Yugoslavia and a profoundly engaged figure in the years after its dissolution. Mark was a high flying undergraduate with the great John Fine at the University of Michigan who came with fellowships and scholarships to do a PhD at Cambridge, under the also great F.H. ‘Harry’ Hinsley, who had been part of the secret Second World War world war that Mark researched. He wrote the authoritative book on ‘Britain and the War for Yugoslavia’ and was appointed as Official Historian of the Special Operations Executive in Yugoslavia. He became a lecturer in the brilliant European and Central and South European Studies Departments at the University of Lancaster in 1975, where he was an inspirational figure, splitting the difference between Slavonians, Slovonians (also known as Sclovonians), Slovenes, Slovaks, Ruthenes, Rusyns, Romanians, Vlachs and Cincars with light humour and deftness at 9am on a Monday morning. When finances and university politics closed those departments, he moved to School of Slavonic and East European Studies in London, now part of UCL. He was there during the collapse of Yugoslavia and the years of war, engaged and commentating in news media and policy circles. He became disillusioned with academic life and sought to make a difference, working with NGOs, including as Bosnia Director for the International Crisis Group. He got to make the real difference when he became political advisor to Paddy Ashdown, the international High Representative in charge of the country. It was a halcyon period of progress in post-conflict, unequalled before or after. Mark regarded this five year period as ‘wonderful’ - only to be contrasted with the ‘awful’ ‘five years that followed, partly with Ashdown’s successors. Disillusioned with practice as he had been with academia, Mark retired in 2010, ‘fled’ Bosnia (but not without donating 5000 books to a university library) and ‘hid’ from his former colleagues and friends for some years, Eventually, he was happy to renew contact with some old friends, including Professor Clive Church, who had appointed him in the mid-1970s and me, one of the protégés, he inspired. He was even contemplating returning to his work on the SOE before he died. He is survived Sheila, his divorced wife, daughter Lily and son Harry. (Professor James Gow, King’s College London)\n\nAnthony Max Hill (MA French Studies, 1969, BA French Studies, 1967, Lonsdale) died on 1 April 2022.

His friend from his time at Lancaster, Roger Enock (History, 1979, Grizedale), gave the eulogy at his funeral.\n\nNick Crockett (Philosophy 1982, Pendle) passed away suddenly in January 2022. He leaves a wife, Ann Tennet (Educational studies 1981, Pendle College). On leaving Lancaster, Nick had a successful career with management in engineering companies, which took him all over the world. When he had the opportunity to go and live and work in Mexico in 2002, as part of a joint venture, he accepted and never looked back. Nick was a character once met, never forgotten, who always did life, his way.\n\n2021\n\nProfessor Clive Church was Lecturer and Senior Lecturer in European Studies from 1966 to 1981 (although he was still teaching at Lancaster until 1983), heading the then-Department of European Studies at Lancaster, before it was dissolved and transferred to the University of Kent, where Clive held a chair and remained until retirement in 2003 and beyond as Emeritus Professor. He joined Lancaster from Trinity College, Dublin, having studied at the University of Exeter — as had several others in his generation at Lancaster. He was a friendly and inspirational figure, who would recognise talent and develop it. He was proudly ‘European’ and key leading figure in UACES — the University Association for Contemporary European Studies and its Journal of Common Market Studies and always sought to promote European links and values. While his early work on the French Revolution was highly noted, it was his later scholarship on Switzerland at Lancaster and afterwards for which he was particularly known, including Political Change in Switzerland, published only a few years before his death and well over a decade after his ‘retiring.’ He was active throughout his life in the Church of England, which both informed his capacity quickly to gauge how many members of an audience or a congregation there might be, and also hid kind and generous nature and treatment of colleagues and students. This is something personally appreciated, as it was he who took me aside as a first year undergraduate, mystified as to how someone who made the kinds of comments and insights in class that a teacher hoped to get, but produced such a duff first essay that he could not work out what had happened. The result of his intervention was that I knew how to write very good university essays and academic articles — and from that intervention, a fortunate career of 40 years followed. He was still working on two studies, one a history of Ticino and the other on external perceptions of Switzerland when he died in December 2021. His wife Margaret predeceased him in 2011 and he is survived by two daughters, Hilary and Joanna, his grand children and his late-life partner Clare. (Professor James Gow, King’s College London)\n\nMrs Françoise Steel, retired lecturer of the French Studies department, died of Covid at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary on 15 December 2021 where she had been receiving treatment for other illnesses. Françoise was appointed as Lectrice in French Studies on 1 October 1964, a month after David had taken up his appointment in the same department, and she was subsequently appointed as part-time lecturer. Successive generations of students benefitted from her guidance in spoken French, as well as her deep knowledge of French institutions and culture.\n\nGill Atkinson formerly a Lancaster University Methodist Chaplain passed away on Thursday 9 December 2021. The following tribute was prepared by Kevin Huggett Anglican Chaplain, Lancaster University: \"It is with great sadness that we have learned of the sudden death of former colleague and Lancaster University Methodist Chaplain, Gill Atkinson. Gill worked at the Chaplaincy Centre 2001-2003, from where she went on to train and be ordained and serve as a Deacon in the Methodist Church. In learning of this sad news many former students have written to express how influential and supportive Gill was at a critical time in their lives. Gill met up online with some former Chaplains for a reunion just a few days before she died and was as cheerful and full of encouragement as ever, reflecting on what a privilege it was to serve the University together in such a good and supportive Chaplaincy team.\"\n\nAndrea Blewitt (Brown), Law, 1988, Fylde, passed away on 12 December 2021. She was a family lawyer and partner at BSG Solicitors, Lancaster a firm she helped create through a series of mergers after joining in 1989 and becoming a partner in 1996. She was born in Salford to proud Glaswegians, Alastair and Janette and after primary school her father’s work took the family to South Africa. As the school starting age was higher in South Africa, it was only after much persuasion that Andie was allowed to continue at school allowing her mother, a doctor, to continue to practise to the benefit local women. On returning to the UK, studies continued at Altrincham Grammar School for Girls. Lancaster University followed reading Law. On the first day at Lancaster soon-to-be friend, Amy found herself ‘cloud watching’ with Andie. At that moment, within minutes of arriving, she knew she had chosen the right place to study. Next came York Law School before she qualified to practise law then return to Lancaster to join the firm Swainson Son and Reynolds in October 1989 and where she became a partner in 1996. An early female partner in a firm dominated by men, Andie played a pivotal role in successive mergers before the firm transformed into BSG Solicitors. By 2019, one hundred years after the Sex Disqualification Act paved the way for women to be admitted into the legal profession, BSG Solicitors was an all-female partnership. Andie was secretary of the Lancaster Law Society and on the committee of the Lancaster and District Women’s Aid regularly supporting women fleeing domestic violence. Andie is highly regarded by her clients and professionals including solicitors, barristers and Judges. Many staff joined BSG Solicitors over the years just so they could work alongside her and clients would switch after being on the other side. In 2000 Andie met future husband Mark Blewitt who was visiting Lancaster for an old boys’ rugby game. Andie and Mark were contemporaries at Lancaster University both graduating in 1988. Marriage followed in 2002 with a ceremony on the shores of Windermere, a favourite swimming haunt. Next motherhood first with Ellie Mae then Daisy (named respectively after television characters from ‘The Beverly Hillbillies’ and ‘The Dukes of Hazzard’). A dedicated mother she encouraged her children in their academic and sporting pursuits including swimming, water polo, hockey, dance, piano and singing. As both mother and partner in a law firm, Andie would find out first-hand what maternity leave provisions were like, then fight her then partners to improve them. Outside of work Andie enjoyed a busy social life, she was a keen cook, had a soft spot for dogs, loved holidays, walking and festivals. An avid crossword solver completing the puzzle was part of her Saturday morning ritual. A social card player Andie enjoyed card, board and party games, when playing Mario Kart she would always choose Luigi. When Parkrun started Andie got the whole family ‘Park-running’. Latterly Andie had taken up singing lessons and golf both passions shared with her daughters. As an escape, Andie enjoyed driving ‘Fred’ her Mini which ‘made her smile’. Making people smile was something Andie did.\n\nJohn Allan Marsh (History, 1978, Furness) passed away on 4 November 2021. Born in Leigh, John arrived at Lancaster, the first in his family to go on to higher education. After graduating he tried a few ‘occupations’: potato picking, mine shaft in Selby, and working on the trams in Blackpool where he had to leave as he had a policy of only charging ‘rich’ folks for the ride and his employers were not particularly appreciative of that philosophy. Moving to The Lucky Star amusements, he found similar employer disapproval when he was found not charging small children to play the machines. He headed to London and a job in housing for local Haringay Council from which he was seconded to run the local branch of NALGO. He became a popular and important figure in the TU movement. He left to set up Mayday Productions with Barry Lucas. He did much work for the Trades Union movement, The ANC and Anti Apartheid with major open air concerts around the UK. John moved into mainstream music events organising one day festival events for UB40, Madness and Paul Weller amongst others. John was highly intelligent, erudite, witty and brilliant company especially if you shared his devotion to his beloved Manchester United. His biggest regret was he died before he could collect a pension from ‘this bunch of clowns’. He will be sadly missed by anyone who had the good fortune to share a pint with him.\n\nProfessor Emeritus David M. Craig passed away on 2 November 2021 in his late eighties. An obituary was published in The Guardian on 24 November - https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/24/david-craig-obituary\n\nDr Stewart Fraser (PhD Politics, 2004) passed away in November 2021. He left Perth High School in 1985 and immediately started work in the Post Office. His school years had been disrupted by renal problems that resulted in Stewart’s mother donating a kidney to Stewart in 1982. In a rather poignant twist Stewart passed away on the eve of the 39th Anniversary of his surgery. Although he enjoyed his short spell in the Post Office the inner intellectual in him needed a greater challenge, so he enrolled on a Highers programme at Perth College. In 1988 he started on a History and IR Degree at the University of Aberdeen. After graduating, and successfully completing a Masters, he went to Lancaster to study by research for a PhD where his Doctoral Thesis was entitled “Medium Maritime Strategy and the Aircraft Carrier in The Royal Navy 1945-2015”. Whilst at Lancaster, Stewart wrote a series of papers for The Centre for Defence and International Security Studies as well as for a number of journals. It was also at Lancaster that Stewart found his passion for teaching and he taught a number of undergraduate subjects during his time there as well as research for the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth and as an adviser on the 1998 Strategic Defence Review.\n\nUpon completion of his PhD he continued to teach at Lancaster as well as researching for the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth and he was an advisor on the 1998 Strategic Defence Review. In 2004 he returned to Perth College he immediately enjoyed the range of teaching and the great camaraderie within the staff. He was instrumental in the extension of degree provision at Perth from two degrees to over 30 in the Humanities area. In 2012 Stewart became Subject Leader for Humanities and Social Sciences at the College and then in 2014 Sector Manager. With his line manager, he oversaw unprecedented growth in the curriculum taking the staff team from three to 18 FTE. Also, in 2012 Stewart became the Programme Leader for BA Social Sciences and introduced a raft of new Joint Degrees to increase student choice and enhance their experience. After a period of illness in 2017 Stewart demitted the programme leadership but remained as a module leader and learned counsel to his successors. In 2020, Stewart was feeling the strain of academic leadership in the pandemic and retreated to a teaching only role, a move that rejuvenated every part of his life. Stewart continued to share his wisdom, in teaching, as a mentor and panel member for the UHI LTA ALPINE (Professional Development in Education)\n\nMary Jones (English, 1972, Bowland) died in October 2021 aged 70. She was still working in Aylesbury, teaching English as a Foreign Language. She had no legacy other than her desire to teach. Whilst at Lancaster she was a keen member of the drama group and performed in Thornton Wilder's \"Our Town\" in 1969. Sadly her demise was rapid, although she had been diagnosed with cancer and was awaiting treatment.\n\nMichael Waller, founding member of Russian Studies passed away on 24 October 2021. Michael was born in Manchester on 14th February 1934 and was educated at Douai College and Altrincham Grammar School. He learnt Russian while on National Service with the Navy. After taking a degree in Classics at Corpus Christi, Oxford, and a period of teaching at the Lancaster Royal Grammar School, he took a second degree in Russian at Manchester. He also worked with the late Barry Gregson to open a pottery at Caton, and he continued to make elegant and distinguished ceramics for many years. The forthcoming University of Lancaster planned to include the study of modern languages within Humanities, and it is said that Michael persuaded Charles Carter (Lancaster's founding Vice-Chancellor) to include Russian. He, therefore, took up a post on 1st September 1964 as the founding member of Russian Studies (subsequently Russian and Soviet Studies), and further additions enabled Lancaster to offer a cluster of East European languages. Michael also met his wife, Manon Allee, at Lancaster, and she predeceased him in 2019. Language studies suffered under the Thatcher cuts to universities in the early 1980s, and the Senate narrowly approved the closure of Russian and Soviet Studies. Michael then moved to the Government Department at the University of Manchester, and in 1993 to a chair in Politics at Keele, where he became Director of European Studies.\n\nYow Liang Keon (MA Operational Research, 1980, Lonsdale) passed away on 17 September 2021. After completing his course, Yow returned to Singapore where he took up a position with the Singapore Ports Authority where a long and successful career followed.\n\nDr Tim Jeeves passed away on 10 September 2021, aged 42. Tim studied for his PhD in Theatre, graduating in 2017 with a thesis entitled Towards ‘Economies of Generosity’ in Contemporary Live Art Practice. For several years he was a much loved seminar tutor and supervisor for practical work in Theatre and LICA. Alongside his academic successes, he was a highly respected professional performance practitioner with a focus on issues of health and disability and on the integration of politics and artistic expression in arts activism. Having been active in the Merseyside Labour Party for a long time, he was elected as a City Councillor in Liverpool in 2019. He campaigned tirelessly for social justice and for a Green New Deal. Tim is remembered with enormous fondness by the Theatre staff who worked with him. Despite a long and often very painful struggle with his own health, he always remained positive and optimistic. He was a kind and generous person, a serious and deeply committed political activist but one who also had a life affirming sense of fun.\n\nAnne Dalton, formerly Secretary and Departmental Secretary in Religious Studies, Linguistics and IELE passed away on 6 September 2021. Anne had been diagnosed with cancer only a short time ago and although the operation was a success, her heart struggled to recover from the trauma of the operation. She died peacefully at St John's Hospice in Lancaster in the early hours of the Monday morning. Anne was known and respected by students and staff alike and was always there with a listening ear for those struggling with work or personal hardship. Her years at the University, and the friendships she gathered, were ones she always treasured and she greatly missed the cosmopolitan atmosphere of campus once she retired.\n\nNiladri Narayan Gupta (MBA, 2014) passed away in August 2021, bringing great sadness to many friends and colleagues who knew him well. Moving away from his family in the US, Niladri came to Lancaster to do an MBA in order to pursue his dream of becoming an entrepreneur and making a positive contribution to society. He was a fun-loving and caring character, also he was a great cook. While he was studying chemistry at university and later working as a research scientist, he developed a passion for the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. He was a proud Indian, proud of his Bengali roots, and was very keen to play his part in India’s economic and social developments. Following the completion of his MBA, he returned to India to turn his entrepreneurial dream into a reality and finally launched his healthcare at home business in 2020. During the global coronavirus pandemic, he helped many patients through his enterprise and made his contribution to India’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. He will be remembered by many of his fiends and colleagues not only for what he achieved but also for what he wanted to achieve, what he had the potential to achieve, and what he could have achieved.\n\nJill Walsh passed away on 13 August 2021, formerly from the Department of Environmental Science. Jill joined the Department of Environmental Studies (later to become Environmental Science) as a technician in 1966, and was with the department for many years until her retirement in 1994. The following tribute was prepared by Ada Pringle, Honorary Researcher. \"Jill was born in Manchester but her home was to be in Blackpool. She was educated there and as a boarder at Queen Anne’s School in Reading. She went on to study at Studley Agricultural College before beginning her working life at Nestle in Northern Ireland, where she had close family. She later moved to Garstang Creamery where she met her husband George and they subsequently had three children. After working at Preston Dairies Jill became a Laboratory Technician in the Environmental Sciences Department in 1966 until she retired in 1994. We were departmental colleagues from 1966 to 1976 and I remember how quickly she became a valued member of the then small team. She was kind, helpful, well-organised and efficient and worked easily with both staff and students. Warm tributes have been paid by some of the earliest students and sent to the Alumni Office. Meanwhile Environmental Science colleagues have praised her friendliness and helpfulness.\" Jill's full obituary and tributes (Internal news)\n\nProfessor M. Alexander Stewart, Professor of the History of Philosophy died on 30 July aged 83. Sandy Stewart studied for his first degree at St Andrews and his doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania. He took up his appointment as Lecturer in the Department of Philosophy on 1 October 1965, and played a full part in departmental, college and university life. Sandy, someone for whom even the smallest detail of misplaced punctuation was deeply painful, was renowned for his exacting standards of scholarship and at times for his caustic interventions. Behind that austere façade, however, he invested much effort and care in both students and colleagues, and his contributions were part of the essential standard-setting of a young institution. Sandy's full obituary (internal news.)\n\nLouize Gibson (Marketing and Theatre Studies, 1988, Cartmel) died suddenly on 17 July 2021 at the age of 55, just a few days after being diagnosed with a brain tumour. A member of Cartmel College (where she met her partner, Jeremy Crow, as Freshers) Louize graduated with a first class honours in marketing with theatre studies, at the time, and perhaps still, a unique combination. The marketing side of her degree provided Louize with her career in qualitative market research. Moving to London, she worked with leading research and marketing agencies before beginning a freelance career in 2002 as a consumer insight specialist, earning a reputation for outstanding people and analytical skills, intuition around consumer behaviour, and an ability to produce meaningful insights, ideas and advice for a wide range of clients internationally. Moving in 2007 to live a stone’s throw from the sea in Hove, Louize found herself very much at home with the culture, liberal values and acceptance of difference in the city, combining her work with passions for singing, swimming, the arts and the Sussex landscape.\n\nKaren Burns, UK Student Recruitment Manager, passed away in July 2021. This personal tribute was written by her colleague, Kathryn Lambert who worked closely with her.\n\nEmma Fitchett, LUMS colleague for over 20 years, sadly passed away in June 2021. Emma joined the LUMS community in 1999, where she initially worked with the Reception team. From there she moved to the LUMS Undergraduate Office, before finally in 2014 joining the Professional Support team in the Department of Economics, providing invaluable support to the department’s Postgraduate students on the MSc in Money, Banking and Finance, MSc Economics, and MSc Quantitative Finance programmes. From all the messages received from across the Department, LUMS, and the wider University, there has been a constant theme of colleague’s memories, and that is of Emma’s happy, positive, can-do attitude to all the tasks she undertook, and always with a smile. Her students - that is how she referred to them - knew they could turn to Emma for support in whatever form that took, sometimes just a chat, sometimes advice. She would leave no stone unturned in seeking out the support they needed. She will be truly missed.\n\nDr Cheryl Simmill-Binning passed away following a short illness in May 2021. After gaining her doctorate in 1999, Cheryl took up her post at Lancaster University the same year and spent the majority of her career in FASS as a Research Associate. She was later promoted to Senior Researcher and Co-Director of ‘ASSURE’ (Applied Social Science Unit for Research and Evaluation), undertaking more than 70 individual commissions for a range of organisations including the Government and Home Office, through to charities and the voluntary sector. She subsequently transferred to work in the Faculty of Health and Medicine in 2015, and later, Student and Education Services. She then joined the Health Innovation Campus team as a Senior Evaluation Fellow, where she was able to continue to pursue her passion for delivering high quality research and evaluation in partnership with diverse organisations, services and communities. Her incredible loss is felt by colleagues and friends, and also former colleagues from FASS and wider. Tributes from her colleagues may be viewed in her full obituary (internal news.)\n\nProfessor David Shotter died on 22 May 2021. He was born in London in 1939, and was educated at King’s College School, Wimbledon and the University of Southampton. After two years teaching at Magee University College in Londonderry, he came as Lecturer (and subsequently Senior Lecturer) to Lancaster’s recently opened Department of Classics in October 1966. In 1971 approval was given for the department to extend its range by the inclusion of archaeology, with Dr Timothy Potter as the first appointment within an expanding Department of Classics and Archaeology. David played a key role in this development, and his teaching and research became increasingly orientated towards Roman studies, with an emphasis on the North-West region, and on the lives of the Roman emperors. He contributed widely to the university, including at the board of studies and on Senate, as principal of Lonsdale College, and as an enthusiastic cricketer. The inaugural exhibition in the Scott Gallery, “Romans in the North”, was led by him. He also set up and chaired some forty annual archaeological conferences for the Centre for NW Regional Studies, using his wide range of contacts to attract outstanding speakers on current hot topics. In 1989 the Department of Classics was laid down and David and John Creed were warmly welcomed into the Department of History. David was made Emeritus Professor of Roman Imperial History in March 2003, giving a sparkling inaugural lecture on Gaius Caligula: “Mad or Simply Bad?” He retired the following year, but continued to take an active interest in all things Roman, publishing on Roman numismatics (four volumes between 1990 and 2011) and responding to enquiries far and wide. Professor David Shotter's full obituary\n\nStephie Barber, who worked in the Research Support Office from 2016-2019 sadly passed away on 22 May 2021. She initially joined on a short-term basis just ‘keep the grey cells active’ over the winter period when it was more difficult to enjoy her usual pastimes of hill-walking and utilising her pilot's license. Her larger than life personality and work ethic meant that we were keen for her to stay longer, and so she incorporated Lancaster University into her ‘OAP in training’ programme and we incorporated her into our hearts. Stephie worked for Stagecoach for 44 years, working her way up the ranks from ticket collector in Rochdale to become Managing Director based in various locations in Scotland, and her love of buses never left her. She was a huge advocate for public transport and it is a testament to her character that Stephie made a point of nipping down to the underpass when on campus to chat to the drivers that she had worked with for so many years, always making herself available to offer them some friendly advice or words of wisdom. When Stephie retired from Stagecoach, she missed the camaraderie that working life offered and wanted to be part of a team again. After joining Research Support, Stephie’s temporary position soon became permanent and she became a much-loved colleague and friend to many in the university, always on hand with a Tunnocks tea cake and a smile. She brightened the office and lives of all she came into contact with and was most likely single handily responsible for ensuring that Wallings stayed open all year round. As well as taking on a part-time role at the university in retirement, Stephie was heavily involved with the local Rotary Club and was very proud of becoming a Local councillor for the Conservative Party representing Bare, where she lived, and really took an interest in the local area. Stephie will be remembered by all as someone who was extremely supportive, generous with her time and wisdom and always willing to engage in a conversation. She spoke up for what she believed in, loved her family and friends very much and was a wonderful colleague, attentive, inclusive and sympathetic to the needs of others. She is still very much missed by those who worked with her, and will forever be remembered fondly by many for her kindness, generosity, laughter and enthusiasm, as well as for her love of listening to classical music, sharing wonderful stories of her previous life, weekly updates on her grandchildren, her fell walking, weather updates and so much more. We feel Stephie won't mind us encouraging donations to MyelomaUK in her memory.\n\nKenneth Reid (Ken) formerly of the Department of Environmental Science passed away on 20 May 2021. Ken started at Lancaster in the early days of the University in April 1968, as Chief Technician in the Department of Environmental Studies, later known as Environmental Science, and after 28 years of exemplary service retired in August 1996. Tributes from former colleagues (internal news.)\n\nTom Clarke (MSc Human Resource & Knowledge Management, 2013, BSc Business Studies, 2012, Grizedale) sadly passed away on the 18 April 2021 following a short illness. Tom joined Lancaster University from King Edward the VII school in Lytham, he absolutely loved his time at Lancaster, fully immersing himself into student life and all it had to offer. He made wonderful friends from across the world whom he maintained contact with after his studies. After graduation Tom joined the grad scheme at Hewlett-Packard as a project manager within their IT team in Glasgow, after nearly 3 years there he secured a position with KPMG in Manchester, working on the consultancy side of the business. In November 2020 Tom was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer. Throughout Tom’s illness, the friends that he had made at school, university & work rallied around to support him but despite the best medical efforts of the Christie Hospital in Manchester, it was a fight that he could not win. Tom passed away at home with his family by his side, he was not in pain or discomfort, Tom was just 29. Upon hearing of his diagnosis Tom spoke about setting up a charitable foundation that could support 3 main charitable areas, those being Crohn’s & Colitis, Cancer Care & Support and Hospice care. The Foundation, once created, will be called the Tom Clarke Foundation. His friends will be walking in his memory in August 2021 https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/1220milesforTomTCClarke\n\nLord Judd, Honorary Fellow of the University died on 17 April 2021, at the age of eighty-six, after a distinguished career in public service.

Alistair arrived in Lancaster as an honorary/visiting Professor in 2007 before being made a Distinguished Professor in 2018. A tribute from Professor Sarah Jack.\n\nDr Lewis Hughes passed away in March 2021. He was a friendly and popular member of the PhD community at Lancaster, and this news will doubtless come as a shock to many. After his PhD, Lewis was employed by Virgin Media as an accountant, a job that he much enjoyed. He continued his interests in History, including plans to develop his PhD thesis into a monograph alongside completing his accountancy exams.\n\nBrian Victor Clifton (Ecology, 1978, Grizedale) passed away peacefully on 10 March 2021 at the age of 92. He had very fond memories of his time at Lancaster University and, being a mature student at the time, there must be plenty of his fellow students still around and young enough to remember him well and the times you spent together. I would be delighted to hear from any of his old friends - do please contact me at janewright7@yahoo.com (Brian's daughter.)\n\nProfessor David Allsop passed away on 8 March 2021. Before joining Lancaster University, David was widely travelled; working in both academia and industry. After gaining his PhD from Kings College London, David worked at the University of Nottingham before moving overseas, first to the University of San Diego and then the Tokyo Psychiatric Research Institute (where he was Assistant Director). David returned to the UK to take up an academic post at Queen’s University in Belfast, before moving into industry with SmithKline Beecham in Essex. David returned to academia in 1998, when he joined Lancaster University as a Senior Lecturer and was appointed Chair in Neuroscience in 2002. David’s research was in the field of neurodegenerative diseases and he was particularly interested in investigating the pathological consequences of misfolded proteins in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. David made seminal contributions to this field; including being the first scientist to investigate a link between the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain and Alzheimer’s disease. David was a major force in neuroscience research and will be hugely missed by friends and colleagues in Biomedical and Life Sciences, as well as across the University and beyond. Away from work, David loved music and played rhythm and lead guitar in local bands T-Bone and Aurora, playing at events across Lancashire, Cumbria and North Yorkshire, perform"
