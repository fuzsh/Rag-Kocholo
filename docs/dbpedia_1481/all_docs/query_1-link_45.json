        "text": "World Environment Day Today, 5 June, we recognise World Environment Day. It is a time to reflect on the legacy we are leaving for the generations who follow us. We cannot undo what has happened before or turn back the clock, but we can make the decision today to do better. We can grow trees, revive our water sources, work to make peace with our environment and implement industry practices which bring real, positive benefits. At SKIPZ Recycling, we value our role in the circular economy - diverting construction and demolition waste away from landfill and recycling it into custom engineered building materials. These recycled materials are then channelled into civil construction and public infrastructure projects, reducing reliance on virgin construction materials. If you are interested in learning more about our Resource Recovery and Eco Products visit our website www.skipzrecycling.com.au Let us make a commitment for good ‚Äì together we can make a healthier planet and brighter future. #generationrestoration #worldenvironmentday2024 #worldenvironmentday2024 #sustainability #sustainable #wastemanagement #skipzrecycling #recycling #takeaction #environmental #constructionwaste #skipbins #skipbinsmelbourne #skipbinsbrisbane #hookbins #marrelbins #recyclingmatters #melbourne #brisbane\n\nüåø Clean Biz Spotlight: Our Journey Towards Sustainability üåø At Citadel Completions, we are proud to be part of the Clean Biz Partnership initiative by Keep Louisiana Beautiful.

I was so proud to be able to increase the blue bag to black bag ratio each collection day. I started driving roll off at Fenceline Rentals Ltd., and was so discouraged driving around, putting 40y bins into the landfill, not to mention the 3-5 other companies there doing the same thing every time I was there. But‚Ä¶ I realized I could take a bin that was half wood on its way to the landfill, and send it to the mixed wood program at Northlands Transfer station. This easy and independent decision kept a years worth of blue bags out of the ground, and saved the company money. It was also a game changer in my mindset of the effect I could have as a driver, much less a salesmen or sales leader. Needless to say, I couldn‚Äôt be more proud of Fenceline Rentals Ltd. stats mentioned below. Especially when you consider that this only includes registered LEED projects, if you factored in the Recycle Tracking programs we have in place with partners like Chandos Construction, Fillmore Construction, Leeswood Construction and Keller Construction Ltd.! These numbers would easily be 3-5x higher! Thank you Jasen Robalo and Rob W. Sherrard for your dedication to accumulating the knowledge and consistency in execution that allows stats like this to be possible.
