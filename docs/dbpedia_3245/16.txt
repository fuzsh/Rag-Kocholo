With more than 60,000 competitors registering for this years Reebok CrossFit Games Open, it’s no real surprise to see the names of a few former, and current, professional athletes on the leaderboard this week.

Many of us know that most of the big names all come from a high-level sporting background (Rich Froning Jr/Baseball, Tommy Hackenbruck/American Football, Chris Spealler/Wrestling), but did you know in this years Open we’re competing against a former international footballer, a former Olympian, a handful of MMA fighters and a former champion kickboxer to name a few?
