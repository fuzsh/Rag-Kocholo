Our Focus For Today  Hours Worked  Overtime  Minimum Wage  Impact on and of state regulations  Meal and rest periods  Statements and payday notices  Frequency and method of payment  Posting requirements  Sick leave ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 8\n\n9. Overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act is computed at 1 1/2 times the regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of the 40 hours in a workweek. There is no limitation on the number of hours an employee may work in any workweek, as long as they are compensated in accordance with the FLSA's requirements. ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 9\n\n10. But Maybe the States Require Daily Overtime… ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 10 AK: 8-hour day CA (of course!) after 8 in a day and double time as well after 12 and on the 7th day CO after 12 in a day NV: paid a base rate of one- and one- half times the minimum wage or less per hour may be entitled to overtime if they work more than 8 hours in any workday.\n\n11. But Maybe the States Require… Special Overtime ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 11 KY: Work 7 days in one work week, overtime on 7th day OR: certain industries only such as mills, factories or manufacturing (10 hour days)\n\n12. Useful Definitions… Work week: The workweek is a fixed and regularly recurring period of 168 consecutive hours (i.e., seven consecutive 24-hour periods). It does not need to coincide with the calendar week but may start on any day at any hour that is convenient for the employer. ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 12\n\n13. And… ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 13 Work Day: The Portal to Portal Act of 1947, excludes from hours worked under the FLSA requirements any hours for time spent by an employee \"walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities\" unless these activities are compensable under the terms of a contract, by custom or by practice. The Portal Act also excludes activities performed before or after the employee's principle activities in a workday.\n\n14. Public Sector Work Week ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 14 Special exception to the 40 hour workweek rules gives fire protection and law enforcement the option of using ‘work periods” of 7 to 28 days. Work Period Fire Protection Law Enforcement 28 212 171 27 204 165 26 197 159 25 189 153 24 182 147 23 174 141 22 167 134 21 159 128 20 151 122 19 144 116 18 136 110 17 129 104 16 121 98 15 114 92 14 106 86 13 98 79 12 91 73 11 83 67 10 76 61 09 68 55 08 61 49 07 53 43\n\n15. Hospital Employees ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 15 Hospitals have an optional method to compute overtime pay for their employees Called the 8/80 rule Overtime computed using a designated work period of 14 consecutive days instead of 7 days Employees paid 1 ½ times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 8 hours in one day or 80 hours in any 14 day period whichever is the greater number of hours\n\n16. Hours Worked… No matter what type of time keeping system employers use, problems may arise over the correct treatment of small amounts of scheduled or unscheduled time worked or missed by employees. Employers must pay for all time worked and cannot use rough estimates or arbitrary formulas to compute hours worked ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 16\n\n17. While the FLSA requires accurate records of hours worked, employers are not required to use time clocks, time cards, or any particular type of time keeping system. If a time clock is used, employers are free to disregard early or late punching by employees who voluntarily arrive early or remain after hours, so long as the employees do not perform any work during these times. ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 17 Keeping Track of Hours Worked\n\n18. Two Exceptions  Rounding of hours  De minimis or insignificant timekeeping ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 18\n\n19. Rounding Practices ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 19  Rounding'' practices are acceptable  Rounding employees' starting time and stopping time to the nearest 5 minutes, or to the nearest one-tenth or quarter of an hour.  For enforcement purposes this practice of computing working time will be accepted, provided that it is used in such a manner that it will not result, over a period of time, in failure to compensate the employees properly for all the time they have actually worked.\n\n20. Rounding Example—Fact Sheet # 21 ©2020 The Payroll Advisor Let’s see how this works when we use the quarter hour method by rounding each punch using the 7- minute rule: 8:02 = 8:00 12:10 = 12:15 1:06 = 1:00 5:05 = 5:00 20 1/4 4 ¼ hours 4 hours\n\n21. Rounding Example—Fact Sheet # 21 ©2020 The Payroll Advisor By determining the number or hours worked for each series of punches the total hours worked for the workday can be calculated. This is accomplished as follows: 8:02 am to 12:10 pm = 4 hours 8 minutes 1:06pm to 5:05pm = 3 hours and 59 minutes This is a total of 8 hours and 7 minutes. Using the 7-minute rule the employer would round back and the employee would be paid for a total of 8 hours. 21\n\n22. Definition of Hours Worked ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 22 The FLSA does not give a definition for hours worked. The closest definition is a provision that specifies the term \"employ\" meaning \"to suffer, let, or permit to work\".\n\n23. The U.S. Supreme Court Has Ruled That Hours Worked Include… ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 23 Any time spent in \"physical or mental exertion that is controlled or required by the employer.\" All hours an employee is required to give to an employer. This includes waiting time if it is for the employer's benefit. All the time during a workweek that an employee is required to be on the employer's premises.\n\n24. To comply with the FLSA, hours worked need to include not only hours actually performing job duties but also any other hours suffered or permitted to work by the employer for the employer's benefit. ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 24 Therefore…\n\n25. Which Means… ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 25 Work not requested but suffered or permitted is work time. For example, an employee may voluntarily continue to work at the end of the shift. He may be a piece worker, he may desire to finish an assigned task, or he may wish to correct errors, prepare time reports or complete other duties. The reason is immaterial. If the employer knows or has reason to believe the employee is continuing to work, the time is working time and must be paid.\n\n26. Therefore… ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 26 In all such cases, it is the duty of the management to exercise its control and see that the work is not performed if it does not want it to be performed. Employers cannot sit back and accept the benefits without compensating for them. The mere promulgation of a rule against such work is not enough. Management has the power to enforce the rule and must make every effort to do so. (Section 785.11, 12, & 13.)\n\n27. Travel and Other Types of Pay ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 27 Nonexempt employees must be paid for travel that is outside of normal home to work commute On Call may have to be compensated if employee not free to follow own needs Meeting times may be compensatory as well Training (required) is time worked Waiting time: Engaged to wait or waiting to be engaged\n\n28. Travel and Other Types of Pay ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 28 Vacation, sick pay and holidays are not hours worked under the FLSA Nights and weekends are hours worked if worked Meal periods: don’t dock if not taken States may have more types such as show up pay or limit number of hours that an employee may work\n\n29. Regular Rate of Pay  It is a calculated rate and not just the file rate  The employer must consider many different payments in accurately calculating the correct rate of pay for overtime hours. ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 29\n\n30. Regular Rate of Pay ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 30 must be included in the calculation of regular pay for overtime purposes, since the FLSA requires payment for overtime hours at 1 1/2 times the \"regular rate of pay\". In addition to the contract or file rate, any additional amounts paid for: shift differential, non- discretionary bonuses promotional bonuses cost of living adjustments\n\n31. Regular Rate of Pay ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 31 Is an hourly rate Employers not required to pay employees by the hour but may pay by the hour, piece, salary, commission or other type of payment Overtime must be computed on an hourly basis\n\n32. ©2020 The Payroll Advisor Methods for Calculating Overtime 32 FLSA way: This requires calculating all the straight time due and adding the “overtime premium” to reach 1 ½ the employee’s regular rate of pay. It is used when additional compensation other than straight time and overtime hours are paid. Example: when the employee receives a non-discretionary bonus.\n\n33. Doing the Math…Following the Steps ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 33 First Step • Total pay for workweek (including bonus etc.) – exclusions = regular pay gross Second Step • Regular pay in step one divided by total hours = regular rate of pay Third Step • Rate in step 2 x .5 then x # of hours of overtime = premium pay for overtime Fourth Step • Add amount in step 1 with amount in step 3 for total gross\n\n34. Now an Example with Numbers…  Example Information:  Employee is paid an hourly rate of $15.00  Works 44 hours in the workweek ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 34\n\n35. The Proper or FLSA Method… ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 35 Step 1 44 x $15.00 = $660.00 Step 2 $660.00 ÷ 44 = $15.00 Step 3 $15.00 x .5 = $7.50 4 x $7.50 = $30.00 Step 4 $660.00 + $30.00 = $690.00\n\n36. Example With Bonus ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 36  Same info except employee receives $10 bonus. Step 1 44 x $15.00 = $660.00 + $10.00 = $670.00 Step 2 $670.00 ÷ 44 = $15.23 Step 3 $15.23 x .5 = $7.62 4 x $7.62 = $30.48 Step 4 $670.00 + $30.48 = $700.48\n\n37. Let’s Do Another Example ©2020 The Payroll Advisor A warehouse worker worked 44 hours last week. In additional to his regular wage of $10.00 an hour, he was paid $50.00 for completing a job on time and on budget. 37\n\n38. ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 38 Using DOL OT Calculator…\n\n39. But What if More than One Work Week Is Involved? ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 39 When a nondiscretionary bonus covers a period of time longer than a workweek, it must be apportioned back over the workweeks of the period during which it was earned. If it is not possible or practicable to allocate the bonus on the basis of when the bonus was actually earned, some other reasonable or equitable method must be adopted (for example, allocation of an equal amount for each workweek covered by the bonus). The employee must then receive additional overtime pay for each workweek in which overtime was worked during the period.\n\n40. Multiple Rates of Pay When an employee in a single workweek works at two or more different types of work for which different straight time rates have been established, the regular rate of pay for that week is the weighted average of all the rates. ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 40\n\n41.  July 24, 2009: $7.25  Opportunity wage is $4.25 per hour  New hires under 20 years of age  First 90 days of employment  Credits can be applied towards minimum wage ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 41 Minimum Wage\n\n42. Room and Board ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 42 Can deduct from wages or credit against minimum wage the reasonable cost of board and lodging furnished to the employee In order to use the credit Facility must be for primarily for the benefit and of the employer Employee must accept them voluntarily Lodging must be employee’s residence on a permanent basis\n\n43. Tip Credit ©2020 The Payroll Advisor 43 Federal: Employers of “tipped employees” must pay a cash wage of at least $2.13 per hour if they claim a tip credit against their minimum wage obligation. If an employee's tips combined with the employer's cash wage of at least $2.13 per hour do not equal the minimum hourly wage, the employer must make up the difference. Must customarily and regularly receive more than $30 a month in tips. States: depends on the state. Some allow and some don’t. Some have standard amounts and some have percentages.\n\n44.
