        "text": "Blood creatinine level in postmortem cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nNishida, Atsushi; Funaki, Hironao; Kobayashi, Masaki; Tanaka, Yuka; Akasaka, Yoshihisa; Kubo, Toshikazu; Ikegaya, Hiroshi\n\n2015-05-01\n\nBlood chemical analysis for the diagnosis of diseases in forensic cases should be conducted in the same way as for clinical cases. However, it is sometimes difficult to obtain serum samples in forensic cases because of postmortem changes such as hemolysis and putrefaction. This study aimed to evaluate renal function in postmortem cases by blood creatinine analysis. The blood creatinine level was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using whole blood samples taken from 77 postmortem cases, and the relationships between blood creatinine level, postmortem interval, and cause of death were examined. The median blood creatinine level was found to be 1.15 mg/dL, with no significant differences between blood samples taken from different parts of the body. The blood creatinine level was stable for 3 days after death and gradually increased after that period, in line with a previous study using enzymatic analysis that found the serum creatinine level was stable in the early postmortem period. The blood creatinine level was high in the cases of blunt injury, intoxication, and in deaths caused by fire. This was considered to reflect acute renal dysfunction. However, the postmortem blood creatinine level remained higher than the clinical normal value despite omitting cases with renal dysfunction from the analysis. Therefore, we next investigated the change in postmortem creatinine levels in mice and found that the blood creatinine level increased with the emergence of rigor mortis. Our findings indicate that HPLC is useful in the postmortem evaluation of renal function even in the cases where serum cannot be obtained. However, the presence of rigor mortis should be considered in the evaluation of blood creatinine values. Copyright Â© 2014 Forensic Science Society. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The study consisted of a prospective autopsy series with each case serving as its own control relative to subsequent testing, and a retrospective survey of patients coming to autopsy who had both autopsy blood cultures and premortem blood cultures. A busy academic autopsy service (600 cases per year) at University of Texas Medical Branch Hospitals, Galveston, Texas, served as the setting for this work. The incidence of non-clinically relevant (false-positive) culture results were compared using different methods for collecting blood samples in a prospective series of 38 adult autopsy specimens. One hundred eleven adult autopsy specimens in which both postmortem and antemortem blood cultures were obtained were studied retrospectively. For both studies, positive culture results were scored as either clinically relevant or false positives based on analysis of the autopsy findings and the clinical summary. The rate of false-positive culture results obtained by an iodine-subclavian technique from blood drawn soon after death were statistically significantly lower (13%) than using the classical method of obtaining blood through the atrium after heat searing at the time of the autopsy (34%) in the same set of autopsy subjects. When autopsy results were compared with subjects' antemortem blood culture results, there was no significant difference in the rate of non-clinically relevant culture results in a paired retrospective series of antemortem blood cultures and postmortem blood cultures using the iodine-subclavian postmortem method (11.7% v 13.5%). The results indicate that autopsy blood cultures obtained using the iodine-subclavian technique have reliability equivalent to that of antemortem blood cultures.\n\nDifferences in sampling techniques on total post-mortem tryptase.\n\nPubMed\n\nTse, R; Garland, J; Kesha, K; Elstub, H; Cala, A D; Ahn, Y; Stables, S; Palmiere, C\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe measurement of mast cell tryptase is commonly used to support the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. In the post-mortem setting, the literature recommends sampling from peripheral blood sources (femoral blood) but does not specify the exact sampling technique. Sampling techniques vary between pathologists, and it is unclear whether different sampling techniques have any impact on post-mortem tryptase levels. The aim of this study is to compare the difference in femoral total post-mortem tryptase levels between two sampling techniques. A 6-month retrospective study comparing femoral total post-mortem tryptase levels between (1) aspirating femoral vessels with a needle and syringe prior to evisceration and (2) femoral vein cut down during evisceration. Twenty cases were identified, with three cases excluded from analysis. There was a statistically significant difference (paired t test, pâ<â0.05) between mean post-mortem tryptase by aspiration (10.87Â ug/L) and by cut down (14.15Â ug/L). The mean difference between the two methods was 3.28Â ug/L (median, 1.4Â ug/L; min, -â6.1Â ug/L; max, 16.5Â ug/L; 95% CI, 0.001-6.564Â ug/L). Femoral total post-mortem tryptase is significantly different, albeit by a small amount, between the two sampling methods. The clinical significance of this finding and what factors may contribute to it are unclear. When requesting post-mortem tryptase, the pathologist should consider documenting the exact blood collection site and method used for collection. In addition, blood samples acquired by different techniques should not be mixed together and should be analyzed separately if possible.\n\nSearch for fungi-specific metabolites of four model drugs in postmortem blood as potential indicators of postmortem fungal metabolism.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­nez-RamÃ­rez, Jorge A; Strien, Juliane; Walther, Grit; Peters, Frank T\n\n2016-05-01\n\nFungi colonizing cadavers are capable of drug metabolism and may thus change the metabolite pattern or concentration of drugs in forensic postmortem samples. The purpose of this study was to check for the presence of such changes by searching fungi-specific metabolites of four model drugs (amitriptyline, metoprolol, mirtazapine, and zolpidem) in decomposed postmortem blood samples from 33 cases involving these drugs. After isolation and identification of fungal strains present in the samples, each isolate was incubated in Sabouraud medium at 25Â°C for up to 120h with each model drug. One part of the supernatants was directly analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), another after liquid-liquid extraction with chlorobutane and concentration. From 21 out of 33 decomposed postmortem blood samples (64%) a total of 30 different strains could be isolated, one from the class of Ascomycete and the rest belonging to 15 species from 8 different genera (number of species): Aspergillus (2), Botrytis (1), Candida (8), Fusarium (1), Mucor (1), Penicillium (1), and Rodothorula (1). In the in vitro studies, these microorganisms were found capable of N-demethylation and N-oxidation of amitriptyline and mirtazapine, O-demethylation followed by side chain oxidation of metoprolol as well as hydroxylation of all four-model drugs. In two of the postmortem blood samples, from which the fungi Aspergillus jensenii, Candida parapsilosis. and Mucor circinelloides had been isolated, a fungi-specific hydroxy zolpidem metabolite was detected. The presence of this metabolite in postmortem samples likely indicates postmortem fungal biodegradation. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, brain tissue has been suggested as a viable alternative specimen, since postmortem blood concentrations can be difficult to interpret due to postmortem redistribution, among other factors. Here we present reference concentrations of postmortem brain and femoral blood of the nitrobenzodiazepines clonazepam, flunitrazepam, and nitrazepam that are of particular interest since they commonly are converted to their corresponding 7-aminometabolites in the postmortem situation. The drugs and metabolites were quantified in both matrices using LC-MS-MS in 69 cases. In 63 cases the compounds were judged not to have been of significance for the death (C cases), whereas they were considered to have been a contributing factor in 6 cases (B cases). No cases were observed with a nitrobenzodiazepine being the sole cause of death (A cases). The brain-blood ratios for clonazepam and nitrazepam were 5.5 and 4.7, respectively, while the brain-blood ratios for the 7-aminometabolites ranged from 0.4 to 0.5. Flunitrazepam only occurred as the 7-aminometabolite. A positive correlation between brain and blood concentrations was found with Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (r s ) ranging from 0.77 to 0.96. The measured femoral blood concentrations agree with literature values, but only few brain concentrations were available for comparison. The drug-metabolite ratios for clonazepam and nitrazepam were 10-12 times higher in brain than in blood. The pre-analytical variation in brain of 5.9% was fairly low, suggesting that brain tissue is a useful alternative to blood. The reported brain and femoral blood concentrations serve as reference values in postmortem investigations. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It is well known that some genetic polymorphisms are responsible for the variability in the expression of this enzyme and in the individual drug response. The detection of allelic variants described as non-functional can be useful to explain some circumstances of death in the study of post-mortem cases with tramadol. A Sanger sequencing methodology was developed for the detection of genetic variants that cause absent or reduced CYP2D6 activity, such as *3, *4, *6, *8, *10 and *12 alleles. This methodology, as well as the GC/MS method for the detection and quantification of tramadol and its main metabolites in blood samples was fully validated in accordance with international guidelines. Both methodologies were successfully applied to 100 post-mortem blood samples and the relation between toxicological and genetic results evaluated. Tramadol metabolism, expressed as its metabolites concentration ratio (N-desmethyltramadol/O-desmethyltramadol), has been shown to be correlated with the poor-metabolizer phenotype based on genetic characterization. It was also demonstrated the importance of enzyme inhibitors identification in toxicological analysis. According to our knowledge, this is the first study where a CYP2D6 sequencing methodology is validated and applied to post-mortem samples, in Portugal. The developed methodology allows the data collection of post-mortem cases, which is of primordial importance to enhance the application of these genetic tools to forensic toxicology and pathology.

A method has been developed for the analysis of drugs of abuse and their metabolites from different chemical classes (opiates, methadone, fentanyl and analogues, cocaine, amphetamines and amphetamine-like substances, ketamine, LSD) in human blood using dried blood spot (DBS) and subsequent UHPLC-MS/MS analysis. DBS extraction required only 100Î¼L of sample, added with the internal standards and then three droplets (30Î¼L each) of this solution were spotted on the card, let dry for 1h, punched and extracted with methanol with 0.1% of formic acid. The supernatant was evaporated and the residue was then reconstituted in 100Î¼L of water with 0.1% of formic acid and injected in the UHPLC-MS/MS system. The method was validated considering the following parameters: LOD and LOQ, linearity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect and dilution integrity. LODs were 0.05-1ng/mL and LOQs were 0.2-2ng/mL. The method showed satisfactory linearity for all substances, with determination coefficients always higher than 0.99. Intra and inter day precision, accuracy, matrix effect and dilution integrity were acceptable for all the studied substances. The addition of internal standards before DBS extraction and the deposition of a fixed volume of blood on the filter cards ensured the accurate quantification of the analytes. The validated method was then applied to authentic postmortem blood samples. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The lungs and heart blood were investigated to determine whether they were suitable samples for collection and could be collected without contamination during an autopsy. Three sets of test subjects (pig carcasses) were investigated under two different fire scenarios. Test subjects 1 were anaesthetized following animal ethics approval, inhaled gasoline vapours for a short period and then euthanized. The carcasses were clothed and placed in a house where additional gasoline was poured onto the carcass post-mortem in one fire, but not in the other. Test subjects 2 did not inhale gasoline, were clothed and placed in the house and had gasoline poured onto them in both fires. Test subjects 3 were clothed but had no exposure to gasoline either ante- or post-mortem. Following controlled burns and suppression with water, the carcasses were collected, and their lungs and heart blood were excised at a necropsy. The headspace from the samples was analysed using thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Gasoline was identified in the lungs and heart blood from the subjects that were exposed to gasoline vapours prior to death (test subjects 1). All other samples were negative for gasoline residues. These results suggest that it is useful to analyse for volatile ignitable liquids in lung tissue and blood as it may help to determine whether a victim was alive and inhaling gases at the time of a fire.\n\nPostmortem Brain and Blood Reference Concentrations of Alprazolam, Bromazepam, Chlordiazepoxide, Diazepam, and their Metabolites and a Review of the Literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nSkov, Louise; Holm, Karen Marie Dollerup; Johansen, Sys Stybe; Linnet, Kristian\n\n2016-09-01\n\nTo interpret postmortem toxicology results, reference concentrations for non-toxic and toxic levels are needed. Usually, measurements are performed in blood, but because of postmortem redistribution phenomena this may not be optimal. Rather, measurement in the target organ of psychoactive drugs, the brain, might be considered. Here we present reference concentrations of femoral blood and brain tissue of selected benzodiazepines (BZDs). Using LC-MS/MS, we quantified alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and the metabolites desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam and temazepam in postmortem femoral blood and brain tissue in 104 cases. BZDs were judged to be unrelated to the cause of death in 88 cases and contributing to death in 16 cases. No cases were found with cause of death solely attributed to BZD poisoning. All BZDs investigated tended to have higher concentrations in brain than in blood with median brain-blood ratios ranging from 1.1 to 2.3. A positive correlation between brain and blood concentrations was found with R(2) values from 0.51 to 0.95. Our reported femoral blood concentrations concur with literature values, but sparse information on brain concentration was available. Drug-metabolite ratios were similar in brain and blood for most compounds. Duplicate measurements of brain samples showed that the pre-analytical variation in brain (5.9%) was relatively low, supporting the notion that brain tissue is a suitable postmortem specimen. The reported concentrations in both brain and blood can be used as reference values when evaluating postmortem cases. Â© The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

The analytes were extracted by solid-phase extraction by means of Bond-Elute Certify cartridges, derivatized with N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide at 80Â°C for 30 min and analyzed by GC-MS. Linearity ranged from 10 to 500 ng/mL, except for ecgonine methyl ester, for which linearity ranged from 10 to 100 ng/mL. Inter- and intra-day imprecision ranged from 2.8 to 18.4% and from 1.5 to 14.9%, respectively. Accuracy values lay between 86.9 and 104.4%. The limit of quantitation for all drugs was 10 ng/mL and recoveries were >74% for all analytes, except for cannabinoids, which showed poor recovery (â¼30%). The developed method was applied to real samples collected from deceased victims due to traffic accidents. These samples were selected according to the results obtained in immunoassay screening on collected urine samples. Five samples were positive for the presence of COC and metabolites, four samples were positive for cannabinoids, six samples were positive for AMPs and two samples were drug negative. Some samples were positive for more than one class of drug. Results obtained from whole blood samples showed good agreement with urine screening. The developed method proved capable of quantifying all three classes of drugs of abuse proposed in this study, through a one-step extraction procedure. Â© The Author 2014.

She died in hospital after an altercation with her husband. Cause of death was clearly not drug intoxication or overdose, so we investigated the postmortem redistribution (PMR) of memantine in the various tissues and blood ratios of the postmortem samples. Memantine concentrations detected were 1.31 Î¼g/mL in the peripheral blood, 3.95 Î¼g/mL in central blood, 2.09 Î¼g/mL in the urine, 25.54 Î¼g/g in the liver, 1.16 Î¼g/g in the thigh muscle and 2.13 Î¼g/g in the subcutaneous fat. In all samples, the concentrations were higher than the accepted therapeutic range (which is approximately 0.09-0.15 Î¼g/mL). The central blood to peripheral blood (C/P) memantine ratio was 3.01 while the liver to peripheral blood (L/P) ratio was 19.5. It is documented that a C/P ratio exceeding 2 and L/P ratio exceeding 20 highlight a propensity for significant PMR. Although this is a single case study, our data suggest that memantine exhibits PMR. Additionally, a lowered pH was found in peripheral blood (pH 6.2) and central blood (pH 6.1). This postmortem reduction in blood pH may also promote the PMR of memantine. Because there is very little available postmortem toxicological data on memantine, our case study will serve as a foundation to assist in future forensic investigations. Copyright Â© 2015.

We describe serial postmortem fentanyl blood concentrations in a hospital inpatient who fatally abused transdermal fentanyl. This is a single-patient case report. A 42-year-old man with lymphoma was started on transdermal fentanyl therapy while hospitalized for chronic abdominal pain. The patient was last seen awake 1.3 h prior to being found apneic and cyanotic. During the resuscitation attempt, a small square-shaped film was removed from the patient's oropharynx. Femoral blood was collected 0.5 and 2 h postmortem, and the measured fentanyl concentration increased from 1.6 to 14 ng/mL. Study limitations include potential laboratory or collection errors and missing data. (i) Providers must be vigilant for signs of fentanyl patch abuse. (ii) Postmortem blood concentrations are not static postmortem, likely secondary to decreasing pH, increased aqueous solubility, and tissue redistribution, and are therefore unlikely to accurately represent antemortem blood concentrations.

Different sources of blood were obtained as follow: 10 samples of blood came from 10 alive mephedrone free-users (mean age 34Â±15.8 years old) (Group 1), whereas 10 post mortem blood samples were obtained from 10 cadavers, in which the post mortem interval was between 24 and 36h (Group 2). The cause of death in post mortem cases (mean age 45Â±14.2 years old) was not drug related. Pools of blood were spiked with mephedrone at the concentration of 1mg/L and 1mL aliquots were transferred in 2mL Eppendorf capped tubes with and without preservatives as follow: with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 3%; with sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate (NaF/KOx) 1.67%/0.2%, respectively; without preservatives. All samples were stored at three different temperatures: -20Â°C, 4Â°C and 20Â°C and extracted and analyzed in duplicate by GC-MS according to a previously published method by Dickson et al., every other day during the first month and then weekly up to 6 months. our study allow us to affirm that -20Â°C is the best storage temperature for mephedrone stability in ante-mortem and post-mortem blood samples in comparison to the other two tested temperatures (+4 and +20Â°C), showing higher values in both groups in samples stored with and without preservatives (p<0.0001). The comparison of Group 1 (samples coming from alive subjects) and Group 2 (post-mortem samples) highlights a better stability of mephedrone in Group 1 (p<0.001) at all tested storage conditions. Finally, the analysis of blood specimens stored with and without preservatives in both groups suggests that specimens stored with NaF/KOx maintain\n\nA liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the determination of cocaine and metabolites in blood and in dried blood spots collected from postmortem samples and evaluation of the stability over a 3-month period.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoretti, Matteo; VisonÃ , Silvia Damiana; Freni, Francesca; Tomaciello, Ilaria; Vignali, Claudia; Groppi, Angelo; Tajana, Luca; Osculati, Antonio Marco Maria; Morini, Luca\n\n2018-05-04\n\nThe aims of this study were (1) to identify and quantify cocaine (COC), benzoylecgonine (BE), ecgonine methyl ester (EME), and cocaethylene (CE) in DBS; (2) to compare dried blood spots (DBSs) analytical results with the routine blood analyses; (3) to monitor analytes stability on DBS within a 3-month period. Eighty-five Î¼L of blood from postmortem cases were put on a card for DBS analysis and kept in the dark, at room temperature. Samples were extracted through solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges and injected in the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system. The analytical procedure is simple, sensitive, and specific. Limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) were calculated at 1.0 and 5.0Â ng/mL(g) for COC and CE, and at 0.5 and 2Â ng/mL for EME and BE, respectively. Validation parameters fulfilled all the acceptance criteria. Fifty-five postmortem cases were evaluated. Eighteen cases were positive for COC (44-2456Â ng/mL) and BE (228-4700Â ng/mL), 12 for EME (92-1500Â ng/mL), and 11 cases for CE (11-273Â ng/mL). Stability was evaluated on 8 cases collected in the period January 2017-January 2018. For each case, 5 DBSs were collected at T0. Four DBSs were analyzed within the 4 following weeks and 1 sample was analyzed after 3Â months. The concentrations on DBSs, stored at room temperature, always matched the ones obtained on blood samples kept at -20Â°C (<20% variation, both at T0 and after 3Â months). BE and COC concentrations remained stable after a 3-month storage, EME concentrations slightly increased after 3Â weeks in the 2 analyzed samples, while CE provided a less homogeneous stability depending on the sample.

The method is based on liquid-liquid extraction technique followed by casein Zymography detection. The target compounds were extracted from blood and meat samples by tris buffer, and purified and separated on anion exchange chromatography. It has been observed that buffer (pH 6.7) containing 50 mM tris-base appears to be excellent extractant as activity of analytes was maximum for all samples. The concentrations of Î¼-, m-calpain and calpastatin detected in the extracts of blood, breast and thigh samples were 0.28-0.55, 1.91-2.05 and 1.38-1.52 Unit/g, respectively. For robustness, the analytical method was applied to determine the activity of calpains (Î¼ and m) in eighty postmortem muscle samples. It has been observed that Î¼-calpain activity in breast and thigh muscles declined very rapidly at 48 h and 24 h, respectively while activity of m-calpain remained stable. Shear force values were also declined with the increase of post-mortem aging showing the presence of ample tenderness of breast and thigh muscles. Finally, it is concluded that the method standardized for the detection of calpain and calpastatin has the potential to be applied to identify post-mortem aging of chicken meat samples.

This could have both a dilution effect on biological fluid samples and could affect subsequent post-contrast analytical laboratory processes. We undertook a small sample study of 10 targeted and 10 whole body PMCTA cases to consider whether or not these two methods of PMCTA could affect post-PMCTA cadaver blood based DNA identification. We used standard methodology to examine DNA from blood samples obtained before and after the PMCTA procedure. We illustrate that neither of these PMCTA methods had an effect on the alleles called following short tandem repeat based DNA profiling, and therefore the ability to undertake post-PMCTA blood based DNA identification.\n\nAn experimental study of postmortem decomposition of methomyl in blood.\n\nPubMed\n\nKawakami, Yuka; Fuke, Chiaki; Fukasawa, Maki; Ninomiya, Kenji; Ihama, Yoko; Miyazaki, Tetsuji\n\n2017-03-01\n\nMethomyl (S-methyl-1-N-[(methylcarbamoyl)oxy]thioacetimidate) is a carbamate pesticide. It has been noted that in some cases of methomyl poisoning, methomyl is either not detected or detected only in low concentrations in the blood of the victims. However, in such cases, methomyl is detected at higher concentrations in the vitreous humor than in the blood. This indicates that methomyl in the blood is possibly decomposed after death. However, the reasons for this phenomenon have been unclear. We have previously reported that methomyl is decomposed to dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) in the livers and kidneys of pigs but not in their blood. In addition, in the field of forensic toxicology, it is known that some compounds are decomposed or produced by internal bacteria in biological samples after death. This indicates that there is a possibility that methomyl in blood may be decomposed by bacteria after death. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate whether methomyl in blood is decomposed by bacteria isolated from human stool. Our findings demonstrated that methomyl was decomposed in human stool homogenates, resulting in the generation of DMDS. In addition, it was observed that three bacterial species isolated from the stool homogenates, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus sp., showed methomyl-decomposing activity. The results therefore indicated that one reason for the difficulty in detecting methomyl in postmortem blood from methomyl-poisoning victims is the decomposition of methomyl by internal bacteria such as B. cereus, P. aeruginosa, and Bacillus sp.

The maximal time limit for tissue retrieval has been set at 24 h postmortem. This study aimed at evaluating the evidence for this limit from a microbiological point of view. The delay of growth in postmortem blood cultures, the identification of the species isolated and clinical/environmental factors were investigated among 100 potential tissue donors. No significant difference was found in the rate of donors with grown blood cultures within (25/65=38%) compared with after (24/65=37%) 24 h of death. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and gastro-intestinal microorganisms were isolated within and after 24 h of death. Two factors--antimicrobial therapy and \"delay before body cooling\"--were significantly inversely related with donors' blood culture results. From a microbiological point of view, there is no evidence for avoiding tissue retrieval among donors after 24 h of death.\n\nPoint-of-care hemoglobin testing for postmortem diagnosis of anemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nNa, Joo-Young; Park, Ji Hye; Choi, Byung Ha; Kim, Hyung-Seok; Park, Jong-Tae\n\n2018-03-01\n\nAn autopsy involves examination of a body using invasive methods such as dissection, and includes various tests using samples procured during dissection. During medicolegal autopsies, the blood carboxyhemoglobin concentration is commonly measured using the AVOXimeterÂ® 4000 as a point-of-care test. When evaluating the body following hypovolemic shock, characteristics such as reduced livor mortis or an anemic appearance of the viscera can be identified, but these observations arequite subjective. Thus, a more objective test is required for the postmortem diagnosis of anemia. In the present study, the AVOXimeterÂ® 4000 was used to investigate the utility of point-of-care hemoglobin testing. Hemoglobin tests were performed in 93 autopsy cases. The AVOXimeterÂ® 4000 and the BC-2800 Auto Hematology Analyzer were used to test identical samples in 29 of these cases. The results of hemoglobin tests performed with these two devices were statistically similar (râ=â0.969). The results of hemoglobin tests using postmortem blood were compared with antemortem test results from medical records from 31 cases, and these results were similar. In 13 of 17 cases of death from internal hemorrhage, hemoglobin levels were lower in the cardiac blood than in blood from the affected body cavity, likely due to compensatory changes induced by antemortem hemorrhage. It is concluded that blood hemoglobin testing may be useful as a point-of-care test for diagnosing postmortem anemia.\n\nDiagnosis of myocardial ischemia combining multiphase postmortem CT-angiography, histology, and postmortem biochemistry.\n\nPubMed\n\nVanhaebost, Jessica; Ducrot, Kewin; de Froidmont, SÃ©bastien; Scarpelli, Maria Pia; Egger, Coraline; Baumann, Pia; Schmit, Gregory; Grabherr, Silke; Palmiere, Cristian\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess whether the identification of pathological myocardial enhancement at multiphase postmortem computed tomography angiography was correlated with increased levels of troponin T and I in postmortem serum from femoral blood as well as morphological findings of myocardial ischemia. We further aimed to investigate whether autopsy cases characterized by increased troponin T and I concentrations as well as morphological findings of myocardial ischemia were also characterized by pathological myocardial enhancement at multiphase postmortem computed tomography angiography. Two different approaches were used. In one, 40 forensic autopsy cases that had pathological enhancement of the myocardium (mean Hounsfield units â¥95) observed at postmortem angiography were retrospectively selected. In the second approach, 40 forensic autopsy cases that had a cause of death attributed to acute myocardial ischemia were retrospectively selected. The preliminary results seem to indicate that the identification of a pathological enhancement of the myocardium at postmortem angiography is associated with the presence of increased levels of cardiac troponins in postmortem serum and morphological findings of ischemia. Analogously, a pathological enhancement of the myocardium at postmortem angiography can be retrospectively found in the great majority of autopsy cases characterized by increased cardiac troponin levels in postmortem serum and morphological findings of myocardial ischemia. Multiphase postmortem computed tomography angiography is a useful tool in the postmortem setting for investigating ischemically damaged myocardium.\n\nPostmortem redistribution of tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol.\n\nPubMed\n\nCosta, Isabel; Oliveira, Ana; Guedes de Pinho, Paula; Teixeira, Helena Maria; Moreira, Roxana; Carvalho, FÃ©lix; Dinis-Oliveira, Ricardo Jorge\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTramadol is a widely used analgesic opioid for moderate-to-severe pain due to its efficacy and safety. Although tramadol induces less adverse effects compared with other opioids, an increased number of documented cases of dependence, abuse, intentional overdose or intoxication have been described. In fatal intoxication, the interpretation of the probable cause of death often relies on the measurement of the tramadol concentration in blood. However, postmortem redistribution (PMR) may affect the results and therefore bias the autopsy report. In the present study, the postmortem cardiac and femoral blood samples from 15 cases of fatal tramadol intoxication were obtained to assess the PMR of tramadol and its main active metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol (M1). Toxicological analysis was performed by the gas chromatography-electron impact-mass spectrometry (GC-EI-MS) method, previously developed and validated for the quantification of both analytes. The cardiac-to-femoral blood ratios of 1.40 and 1.28 were obtained for tramadol and M1, respectively. Results were compared with those in the literature and it was possible to conclude that femoral blood should be considered for quantitative interpretations in fatal cases of tramadol intoxication.\n\nPostmortem Fluid and Tissue Concentrations of THC, 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaenz, Sunday R; Lewis, Russell J; Angier, Mike K; Wagner, Jarrad R\n\n2017-07-01\n\nMarijuana is the most commonly abused illicit drug worldwide. Marijuana is used for its euphoric and relaxing properties. However, marijuana use has been shown to result in impaired memory, cognitive skills and psychomotor function. The Federal Aviation Administration's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute conducts toxicological analysis on aviation fatalities. Due to severe trauma associated with aviation accidents, blood is not always available; therefore, the laboratory must rely on specimens other than blood for toxicological analysis in ~30-40% of cases. However, the postmortem distribution of cannabinoids has not been well characterized. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the distribution of Î9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and its metabolites, 11-hydroxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC) and THC-COOH, in postmortem fluid and tissue specimens from 11 fatal aviation accident cases (2014-2015) previously found positive for cannabinoids. Specimens evaluated, when available, included: blood, urine, vitreous humor, liver, lung, kidney, spleen, muscle, brain, heart and bile. We developed and validated (following SWGTOX guidelines) a sensitive and robust method using solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify and quantify THC, 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH in postmortem fluids and tissues. The method readily identified and quantified these cannabinoids in postmortem fluids and tissues below 1 ng/mL. Qualitative cannabinoid results within each case were comparable between blood and non-blood specimens. However, there was no consistent distribution of the cannabinoids between blood and any other fluids or tissues. Therefore, while quantitative interpretation of non-blood postmortem fluid and tissues samples is not prudent, a majority of the non-blood specimens tested could be suitable alternative/supplemental choices for qualitative cannabinoid detection.

However, due to its secondary effects, it has become a controlled substance, entering the illicit market for recreational and \"dance club scene\" use, muscle enhancement purposes and drug-facilitated sexual assaults. Its endogenous context can bring some difficulties when interpreting, in a forensic context, the analytical values achieved in biological samples. This manuscript reviewed several crucial aspects related to GHB forensic toxicology evaluation, such as its post-mortem behaviour in biological samples; endogenous production values, whether in inÂ vivo and in post-mortem samples; sampling and storage conditions (including stability tests); and cut-off reference values evaluation for different biological samples, such as whole blood, plasma, serum, urine, saliva, bile, vitreous humour and hair. This revision highlights the need of specific sampling care, storage conditions, and cut-off reference values interpretation in different biological samples, essential for proper practical application in forensic toxicology.

Although specificity has previously been considered a problem in the screening of such samples, we believe that ensuring sensitivity is more important. The aim of this study was to validate a broader range of assays for the screening of post-mortem blood samples from deceased tissue donors. Six microplate immunoassays currently in use within National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) for the screening of blood, tissue and stem cell donations were included. Representative samples from confirmed positive donors were titrated in screen negative post-mortem samples in parallel with normal pooled negative serum to determine if there was any inhibition with the post-mortem samples. There were no significant differences seen (PÂ <Â 0.005) between the dilution curves obtained for the positive samples diluted in post-mortem samples and normal pooled sera. Although small numbers of samples were studied, it can be surmised that the post-mortem blood samples from deceased tissue donors, collected according to United Kingdom guidelines, are a suitable substrate for the assays evaluated. No diminution of reactivity was seen when dilution with sera from deceased donors was compared to dilution using pooled serum from live donors. In the absence of genuine low titre positive post-mortem samples, the use of samples spiked with various levels of target material provides a means of qualifying serological screening assays used by NHSBT for the screening of post-mortem blood samples from deceased tissue donors.\n\nPost-mortem clinical pharmacology\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFerner, R E\n\n2008-01-01\n\nClinical pharmacology assumes that deductions can be made about the concentrations of drugs from a knowledge of the pharmacokinetic parameters in an individual; and that the effects are related to the measured concentration. Post-mortem changes render the assumptions of clinical pharmacology largely invalid, and make the interpretation of concentrations measured in post-mortem samples difficult or impossible. Qualitative tests can show the presence of substances that were not present in life, and can fail to detect substances that led to death. Quantitative analysis is subject to error in itself, and because post-mortem concentrations vary in largely unpredictable ways with the site and time of sampling, as a result of the phenomenon of post-mortem redistribution. Consequently, compilations of âlethal concentrationsâ are misleading. There is a lack of adequate studies of the true relationship between fatal events and the concentrations that can be measured subsequently, but without such studies, clinical pharmacologists and others should be wary of interpreting post-mortem measurements.

Both The International Association of Forensic Toxicologists (TIAFT) and the US Federal Aviation Administration recommend that samples of bile should be obtained in some circumstances. Furthermore, standard toxicological texts compare blood and bile concentrations, implying that concentrations in bile are of forensic value. To review the evidence on simultaneous measurements of blood and bile drug concentrations reported in the medical literature. We made a systematic search of EMBASE 1980-2016 using the search terms (\"bile/\" OR \"exp drug bile level/concentration/\") AND \"drug blood level/concentration/\", PubMed 1975-2017 for (\"bile[tw]\" OR \"biliary[tw]\") AND (\"concentration[tw]\" OR \"concentrations[tw]\" OR \"level[tw]\" OR \"levels[tw]\") AND \"post-mortem[tw]\" and also MEDLINE 1990-2016 for information on drugs whose biliary concentrations were mentioned in standard textbooks. The search was limited to human studies without language restrictions. We also examined recent reviews, indexes of relevant journals and citations in Web of Science and Google Scholar. We calculated the bile:blood concentration ratio. The searches together yielded 1031 titles with abstracts. We scanned titles and abstracts for relevance and retrieved 230, of which 161 were considered further. We excluded 49 papers because: the paper reported only one case (30 references); the data referred only to a metabolite (1); the work was published before 1980 (3); the information concerned only samples taken during life (10); or the paper referred to a toxin or unusual recreational drug (5). The remaining 112 papers provided data for analysis, with at least two observations for each of 58 drugs. Bile:blood concentration ratios: Median bile:blood concentration ratios varied from 0.18 (range 0.058-0.32) for dextromoramide to 520 (range 0.62-43,000) for buprenorphine.

These products often contain methylone, mephedrone and methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV)--three amphetamine derivatives shown to have strong pharmacological effects. Four postmortem cases were analyzed for methylone, mephedrone and MDPV, with drug levels quantitated in multiple biological matrices. All four cases had detectable levels of methylone, with heart blood concentrations of 0.740, 0.118, 0.060 and 1.12 mg/L. Analysis of several tissue samples shows that methylone does not sequester in a particular tissue type after death. The average liver-to-blood ratio was 2.68. Two cases also had MDPV present, but insufficient data were collected to formulate a hypothesis on postmortem sequestration or redistribution. Two different extraction methods, as well as analysis of derivatized and underivatized methylone, show that the drug is suitable for analysis in either method. The cases are believed to show one instance of chronic methylone use, with a urine concentration of 38 mg/L.\n\nSpectral Mining for Discriminating Blood Origins in the Presence of Substrate Interference via Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: Postmortem or Antemortem Blood?\n\nPubMed\n\nTakamura, Ayari; Watanabe, Ken; Akutsu, Tomoko; Ikegaya, Hiroshi; Ozawa, Takeaki\n\n2017-09-19\n\nOften in criminal investigations, discrimination of types of body fluid evidence is crucially important to ascertain how a crime was committed. Compared to current methods using biochemical techniques, vibrational spectroscopic approaches can provide versatile applicability to identify various body fluid types without sample invasion. However, their applicability is limited to pure body fluid samples because important signals from body fluids incorporated in a substrate are affected strongly by interference from substrate signals. Herein, we describe a novel approach to recover body fluid signals that are embedded in strong substrate interferences using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectroscopy and an innovative multivariate spectral processing. This technique supported detection of covert features of body fluid signals, and then identified origins of body fluid stains on substrates. We discriminated between ATR FT-IR spectra of postmortem blood (PB) and those of antemortem blood (AB) by creating a multivariate statistics model. From ATR FT-IR spectra of PB and AB stains on interfering substrates (polyester, cotton, and denim), blood-originated signals were extracted by a weighted linear regression approach we developed originally using principal components of both blood and substrate spectra. The blood-originated signals were finally classified by the discriminant model, demonstrating high discriminant accuracy. The present method can identify body fluid evidence independently of the substrate type, which is expected to promote the application of vibrational spectroscopic techniques in forensic body fluid analysis.\n\nPost-mortem quetiapine concentrations in hair segments of psychiatric patients - Correlation between hair concentration, dose and concentration in blood.\n\nPubMed\n\nGÃ¼nther, Kamilla Nyborg; Johansen, Sys Stybe; Nielsen, Marie Katrine Klose; Wicktor, Petra; Banner, Jytte; Linnet, Kristian\n\n2018-04-01\n\nDrug analysis in hair is useful when seeking to establish drug intake over a period of months to years. Segmental hair analysis can also document whether psychiatric patients are receiving a stable intake of antipsychotics. This study describes segmental analysis of the antipsychotic drug quetiapine in post-mortem hair samples from long-term quetiapine users by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis. The aim was to obtain more knowledge on quetiapine concentrations in hair and to relate the concentration in hair to the administered dose and the post-mortem concentration in femoral blood. We analyzed hair samples from 22 deceased quetiapine-treated individuals, who were divided into two groups: natural hair colour and dyed/bleached hair. Two to six 1cm long segments were analyzed per individual, depending on the length of the hair, with 6cm corresponding to the last six months before death. The average daily quetiapine dose and average concentration in hair for the last six months prior to death were examined for potential correlation. Estimated doses ranged from 45 to 1040mg quetiapine daily over the period, and the average concentration in hair ranged from 0.18 to 13ng/mg. A significant positive correlation was observed between estimated daily dosage of quetiapine and average concentration in hair for individuals with natural hair colour (p=0.00005), but statistical significance was not reached for individuals with dyed/bleached hair (p=0.31). The individual coefficient of variation (CV) of the quetiapine concentrations between segments ranged from 3 to 34% for individuals with natural hair colour and 22-62% for individuals with dyed/bleached hair. Dose-adjusted concentrations in hair were significantly lower in females with dyed/bleached hair than in individuals with natural hair colour.

DNA recovered from these cards should be stable for long periods of time. However, it is not well established as how well the DNA stored on FTA card for substantial time periods meets the demands of forensic or genomic DNA analyses and especially so for from post-mortem (PM) samples in which the quality can vary upon initial collection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the time-dependent degradation on DNA quality and quantity extracted from up to 16 years old post-mortem bloodstained FTA cards. Four random FTA samples from eight time points spanning 1998 to 2013 (n=32) were collected and extracted in triplicate. The quantity and quality of the extracted DNA samples were determined with Quantifiler(Â®) Human Plus (HP) Quantification kit. Internal sample and sample-to-sample variation were evaluated by comparing recovered DNA yields. The DNA from the triplicate samplings were subsequently combined and normalized for further analysis. The practical effect of degradation on DNA quality was evaluated from normalized samples both with forensic and pharmacogenetic target markers. Our results suggest that (1) a PM change, e.g. blood clotting prior to sampling, affects the recovered DNA yield, creating both internal and sample-to-sample variation; (2) a negative correlation between the FTA card storage time and DNA quantity (r=-0.836 at the 0.01 level) was observed; (3) a positive correlation (r=0.738 at the level 0.01) was found between FTA card storage time and degradation levels. However, no inhibition was observed with the method used. The effect of degradation was manifested clearly with functional applications. Although complete STR-profiles were obtained for all samples, there was evidence of degradation manifested as decreased peak heights in the larger-sized amplicons. Lower amplification success was notable with the large 5.1 kb CYP2D6 gene fragment which strongly supports\n\nInterpretation of analytical toxicology results in life and at postmortem.\n\nPubMed\n\nFlanagan, Robert J; Connally, Geraldine\n\n2005-01-01\n\nInterpretation of analytical toxicology results from live patients is sometimes difficult. Possible factors may be related to: (i) the nature of the poison(s) present; (ii) sample collection, transport and storage; (iii) the analytical methodology used; (iv) the circumstances of exposure; (v) mechanical factors such as trauma or inhalation of stomach contents; and (vi) pharmacological factors such as tolerance or synergy. In some circumstances, detection of a drug or other poison may suffice to prove exposure. At the other extreme, the interpretation of individual measurements may be simplified by regulation. Examples here include whole blood alcohol (ethanol) in regard to driving a motor vehicle and blood lead assays performed to assess occupational exposure. With pharmaceuticals, the plasma or serum concentrations of drugs and metabolites attained during treatment often provide a basis for the interpretation of quantitative measurements. With illicit drugs, comparative information from casework may be all that is available. Postmortem toxicology is an especially complex area since changes in the composition of fluids such as blood depending on the site of collection from the body and the time elapsed since death, amongst other factors, may influence the result obtained. This review presents information to assist in the interpretation of analytical results, especially regarding postmortem toxicology. Collection and analysis of not only peripheral blood, but also other fluids/tissues is usually important in postmortem work. Alcohol, for example, can be either lost from, or produced in, blood especially if there has been significant trauma, hence measurements in urine or vitreous humour are needed to confirm the reliability of a blood result. Measurement of metabolites may also be valuable in individual cases.\n\nPostmortem distribution of guaifenesin concentrations reveals a lack of potential for redistribution.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcIntyre, Iain M; Navarrete, Aylmer; Mena, Othon\n\n2014-12-01\n\nTherapeutic (or non-toxic) postmortem guaifenesin blood and liver concentrations have not been previously described. Peripheral blood guaifenesin concentrations were compared to central blood and liver concentrations in eight medical examiner cases. Specimens were initially screened for alcohol and simple volatiles, drugs of abuse, alkaline, and acid/neutral drugs. Guaifenesin, when detected by the acid/neutral drug screen, was subsequently confirmed and quantified by a high performance liquid chromatography procedure. Data suggest that postmortem guaifenesin peripheral blood concentrations may be considered non-toxic to at least 5.4mg/L with liver concentrations to at least 7.0mg/kg. Overall, guaifenesin concentrations ranged from 1.9 to 40mg/L in peripheral blood, 2.2-150mg/L in central blood, and 2.6-36mg/kg in liver. The median guaifenesin central blood to peripheral blood ratio was 1.1 (N=8). Similarly, liver to peripheral blood ratios showed a median value of 0.9L/kg (N=5). Given that a liver to peripheral blood ratio less than 5L/kg is consistent with little to no propensity for postmortem redistribution, these data suggest that guaifenesin is not prone to substantial postmortem redistribution.

Guinea pigs were intragastric administrated with 100, 50, 15 microg/kg tetrodotoxin, respectively. The poisoning symptoms were observed. The samples of heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, brain, stomach, intestines, bile, heart blood and urine were collected. The concentrations of tetrodotoxin in tissues and body fluids were measured with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). After administrated with tetrodotoxin, all guinea pigs came out poisoning signs including tachypnea, weary and dead finally. Tetrodotoxin concentrations in lung, stomach, intestines and urine were higher, followed by blood, heart and brain. The concentration in bile was the lowest. Postmortem distribution of tetrodotoxin in guinea pig is uneven. The concentration in the lung, stomach, intestines, urine and heart blood are higher, those tissues could be used for diagnosis of tetrodotoxin poisoning.\n\nValidity of Postmortem Glycated Hemoglobin to Determine Status of Diabetes Mellitus in Corneal Donors.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoper, Mark C; Marcovina, Santica M; Hoover, Caroline K; Calhoun, Peter M; McCoy, Kristen E; Stoeger, Christopher G; Schmidt, Gregory A; Arafah, Baha M; Price, Marianne O; Szczotka-Flynn, Loretta B; Lass, Jonathan H\n\n2017-08-01\n\nTo examine the stability of postmortem glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement and its relationship to premortem glycemia. Postmortem blood samples were obtained from 32 donors (8 known diabetic) and shipped on ice to a central laboratory to examine the stability of HbA1c measurements during the first 9 postmortem days. Thirty-nine other suspected diabetic donors underwent comparison of premortem and postmortem HbA1c measurements. Postmortem HbA1c measurements remained stable after 9 postmortem days (all measurements within Â±0.2% from baseline with a mean difference of 0.02% Â± 0.10%). Of the premortem measurements obtained within 90 days before death, 79% were within Â±1.0% of the postmortem measurements compared with 40% for measurements more than 90 days apart. Three of the postmortem HbA1c measurements exceeded 6.5% (considered a threshold for diabetes diagnosis), although the medical histories did not indicate any previous diabetes diagnosis. Postmortem HbA1c testing is feasible with current eye bank procedures and is reflective of glycemic control of donors during 90 days before death. HbA1c testing could potentially be a useful adjunct to review of the medical history and records for donor assessment for endothelial keratoplasty suitability and long-term graft success.\n\n[Post-mortem microbiology analysis].\n\nPubMed\n\nFernÃ¡ndez-RodrÃ­guez, Amparo; Alberola, Juan; Cohen, Marta Cecilia\n\n2013-12-01\n\nPost-mortem microbiology is useful in both clinical and forensic autopsies, and allows a suspected infection to be confirmed. Indeed, it is routinely applied to donor studies in the clinical setting, as well as in sudden and unexpected death in the forensic field. Implementation of specific sampling techniques in autopsy can minimize the possibility of contamination, making interpretation of the results easier. Specific interpretation criteria for post-mortem cultures, the use of molecular diagnosis, and its fusion with molecular biology and histopathology have led to post-mortem microbiology playing a major role in autopsy. Multidisciplinary work involving microbiologists, pathologists, and forensic physicians will help to improve the achievements of post-mortem microbiology, prevent infectious diseases, and contribute to a healthier population.

A full autopsy is often not possible, since it is costly and may encounter resistance of the deceased's family. Methods We have assessed the use of a cytological smear of brain tissue, obtained post-mortem by supraorbital sampling, for the purpose of quantifying cerebral sequestration in children with fatal malaria in Blantyre, Malawi. We have compared this method to histological quantification of parasites at autopsy. Results The number of parasites present on cytological smears correlated with the proportion of vessels parasitized as assessed by histology of fixed and stained brain tissue. Use of cytological results in addition to the standard clinical case definition increases the specificity of the clinical case definition alone from 48.3% to 100% with a minimal change in sensitivity. Conclusions Post-mortem supraorbital sampling of brain tissue improves the specificity of the diagnosis of fatal cerebral malaria and provides accurate quantitative estimates of cerebral sequestration. This tool can be of great value in clinical, pathogenetic, and epidemiological research studies on cerebral malaria.

The follow samples were taken from 399 corpses: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 376, suboccipital), blood (n = 158, femoral vein), and urine (n = 101, at autopsy). (See Table 1 for causes of death) All samples were stored at -80 degrees C. A further 100 samples of blood were later taken and stored at +4 degrees C before testing. Biochemical determinations made were: glucose in CSF, blood, and urine (hexokinase method); lactate (LDH/GPT) and free acetone (HS-gas chromatography) in CSF; hemoglobin A1 in blood (microcolumn technique). In 34 cases fatal diabetic coma was considered verified by morphological and chemical findings. One hundred cases of sudden cardiac death were chosen as the main control group. In 32 of the 34 cases defined above, the value of the formula of Traub (glucose + lactate in CSF) exceeded 415 mg/dl. It is not influenced significantly by hyperglycemia or hyperlactatemia due to factors other than diabetes (i.e., carbon monoxide, asphyxia). After death the value rose till the 30th hpm, then remained stable for at least 1 week. Fatal coma was defined as the ketoacidotic form if free acetone in CSF ranged above 21 mg/l. In these cases, CSF glucose and free acetone correlated positively. Hemoglobin A1 remained stable after death. Its amount was independent from postmortem blood glucose, postmortem interval and total hemoglobin. Furthermore, the manner of storage (-80 degrees or +4 degrees C) had no significant influence on its values. In 29 of 34 cases of fatal coma, Hb A1 exceeded 12.1%. Analysis of urine glucose showed elevated levels (over 500 mg/dl) in diabetic comas. On conclusion, fatal diabetic coma seems indicated as the cause of death if measured values of postmortem biochemistry exceed the following limits: CSF-Traub 415 mg/dl, free acetone (CSF) 21 mg/l; Hb A1 12.1%; urine glucose 500 mg/dl. Most important are the Traub formula and\n\nSarcomere length influences postmortem proteolysis of excised bovine semitendinosus muscle.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeaver, A D; Bowker, B C; Gerrard, D E\n\n2008-08-01\n\nThe interaction between sarcomere length and postmortem proteolysis as related to meat tenderness is not clear. The extent of thick and thin filament overlap alters actomyosin binding and may alter substrate availability during aging-induced tenderization. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of sarcomere length on proteolytic degradation in beef. Strips from bovine semitendinosus were either stretched 40% and restrained or allowed to shorten unrestrained in an ice bath. After rigor completion, 0.6-cm cross sections were fabricated and were randomly assigned to 2, 4, 7, or 10 d of aging treatments. Myofibrils were isolated for sarcomere length determination. Samples were collected and frozen for shear force analysis, and muscle proteins were extracted for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analyses to determine troponin T (TnT) proteolysis. Sarcomere length was greater (P < 0.01) in stretched muscle samples compared with shortened samples (2.57 vs. 1.43 microm, respectively). Correspondingly, shear force values were greater (P < 0.05) in shortened samples than stretched samples. Western blots revealed the presence of 3 major intact TnT bands that diminished with time postmortem and 4 bands (TnT degradation products) that accumulated during postmortem storage. Quantification of intact TnT showed increased (P < 0.05) proteolysis at 4 and 7 d postmortem in samples with long sarcomeres. By 10 d, only traces of the greatest molecular weight intact TnT band were evident in both shortened and stretched samples, suggesting this TnT band may be more susceptible to proteolysis than other intact TnT bands. Degradation products of TnT appeared earlier postmortem in samples with long sarcomeres. The 30-kDa TnT fragment appeared after 7 d of postmortem storage in samples with long sarcomeres but not until 10 d in muscle containing short sarcomeres. Collectively, these data show that postmortem TnT proteolysis is sarcomere length-dependent and suggest that thick\n\nDrug concentrations in post-mortem femoral blood compared with therapeutic concentrations in plasma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLauniainen, Terhi; OjanperÃ¤, Ilkka\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTherapeutic drug concentrations measured in plasma are of limited value as reference intervals for interpretation in post-mortem (PM) toxicology. In this study, drug concentration distributions were studied in PM femoral venous blood from 57 903 Finnish autopsy cases representing all causes of death during an 11-year period. Cause-of-death information was obtained from death certificates issued by forensic pathologists. Median, mean, and upper percentile (90th, 95th, 97.5th) concentrations were calculated for 129 drugs. To illustrate how PM median concentrations relate to established therapeutic ranges in plasma, a PM blood/plasma relationship was calculated for each drug. Males represented 75% of the subjects and showed a lower median age (55 yrs) than females (59 yrs). In 43% of these cases, blood alcohol concentration was higher than 0.2â°, and the median was 1.8â°. Sixty-one (47%) of the 129 drugs showed a PM blood/plasma relationship of 1. For 22 drugs (17%), the relationship was <1, and for 46 drugs (35%), the relationship was >1. No marked correlation was found between the PM blood/plasma relationship and the volume of distribution (Vd). For 36 drugs, more than 10% of cases were fatal poisonings attributed to this drug as the main finding. These drug concentration distributions based on a large database provide a helpful reference not only to forensic toxicologists and pathologists but also to clinical pharmacologists in charge of interpreting drug concentrations in PM cases.

Post-mortem computed tomography angiography (PMCT-A) involves the injection of contrast agents. This could cause dilution of a biological fluid sample or cause the circulation of blood after death by mechanical pumping, and thus has the potential to affect laboratory investigations. We undertook a small sample study to consider whether targeted PMCT-A had any significant effect on subsequent samples taken for biochemical, toxicological or immunological investigations. Although the results of our study do illustrate differences between the pre and post PMCT-A results, these differences are considered not to be of diagnostic significance and not due to the direct effect of targeted PMCT-A.

Despite its apparent simplicity, the results interpretation can be complex and always have relevant social and legal implications, particularly in postmortem analysis. In the present report we describe the case of a 55-year-old male with an apparent natural death by myocardial infarction, whose initial BAC was 0.18g/L but, in repeated determinations prompted by discrepancies observed in the first two, it rapidly increased to 0.85g/L three days later, leading to the suspicion of in vitro ethanol production. A microbiological examination of the sample revealed the presence of the bacteria Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, and yeast Candida parapsilosis, known for their involvement in ethanol production. Although this is a case report and it is not meant to be generalizable, we discuss an existing large body of scientific literature showing the difficulties, limitations and some relevant medico-legal questions regarding BAC determinations in postmortem samples and their interpretation, particularly in the context of plausible in vitro ethanol production. The key conclusion is that evaluating a postmortem BAC is a complex and multifactorial process that always deserves a thorough analysis and a careful interpretation. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Î9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component in cannabis or marijuana, is the illicit substance most commonly implicated in driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) cases and fatally-injured drivers. No investigation of PMR of THC in human blood has been reported to date. Methods Matched heart and iliac postmortem blood specimens were collected from 19 medical examiner cases (16 Males, 3 Females) with positive cannabinoid urine immunoassay screens. THC, its equipotent metabolite 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) and non-psychoactive metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THCCOOH) were quantified by two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with cryofocusing, with 0.5 ng/mL limits of quantification (LOQ) for all analytes. Results 10 cases had quantifiable THC and 11-OH-THC; THCCOOH was present in all 19. Median (range) heart:iliac blood ratios were 1.5 for THC (range: 0.3â3.1); 1.6 for 11-OH-THC (range: 0.3â2.7); and 1.8 for THCCOOH (range: 0.5â3.0). Discussion Cannabinoids, in general, exhibited a mean and median central: peripheral (C: P) concentration ratio of less than 2 following death. A trend was observed for greater PMR with increasing postmortem interval between death and sampling. To our knowledge, these are the first data on THC PMR in humans, providing important scientific data to aid in the interpretation of postmortem cannabinoid concentrations in medico-legal investigations.

However, it is not known to what extent the virus evolves independently within the CNS and whether the HIV-RNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reflects the viral population replicating within the brain parenchyma or the systemic infection. The aim of this study was to investigate HIV-1 evolution in the CNS and the origin of HIV-1 in CSF. Longitudinally derived paired blood and CSF samples and post-mortem samples from CSF, brain and spleen were collected over a period of up to 63 months from three HIV-1 infected men receiving antiretroviral treatment and presenting with symptoms of AIDS dementia complex (ADC). Phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 V3, reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease sequences from patient isolates suggest compartmentalization with distinct viral strains in blood, CSF and brain. We found a different pattern of RT and accessory protease mutations in the systemic infection compared to the CNS. We conclude that HIV-1 may to some extent evolve independently in the CNS and the viral population in CSF mainly reflects the infection in the brain parenchyma in patients with ADC. This is of importance in understanding HIV pathogenesis and can have implications on treatment of HIV-1 patients.\n\nMethamphetamine and amphetamine concentrations in postmortem rabbit tissues.\n\nPubMed\n\nNagata, T; Kimura, K; Hara, K; Kudo, K\n\n1990-11-01\n\nThe feasibility of detecting methamphetamine and its major metabolite, amphetamine, in postmortem tissues over a 2-year period was examined. It is important to determine if the abuse and toxic effects of drugs can be proved from evidence found in decayed, submerged, or stained tissue materials. The blood, urine, liver, skeletal muscle, skin and extremity bones from rabbits given methamphetamine intravenously were kept at room temperature, under 4 different conditions: sealed in a test tube, dried in the open air, submerged in tap water and stained on gauze. Methamphetamine was present in all the samples, with slight change in concentration in case of sealed and air dried tissues. Changes varied in bones kept in water. There were considerable decreases in methamphetamine in blood and urine stains. Despite long term storage, drug abuse and/or toxicity could be determined, in all tissues examined.\n\nPrevention of abnormal pulmonary mechanics in the postmortem guinea pig lung.\n\nPubMed\n\nReynolds, A M; McEvoy, R D\n\n1988-04-01\n\nSevere postmortem bronchoconstriction has been shown previously in guinea pig lungs and linked to pulmonary blood loss during exsanguination (Lai et al., J. Appl. Physiol. 56: 308-314, 1984). To reexamine this phenomenon we measured postmortem airway function in anesthetized open-chest guinea pigs after sudden circulatory arrest. Animals were divided into 4 groups of 10 and ventilated for 15 min postmortem with different gases: 1) room air, 2) conditioned air, 3) dry 5% CO2-21% O2-74% N2, and 4) conditioned 5% CO2-21% O2-74% N2. In room air-ventilated lungs there was a 50% decrease in dynamic compliance (Cdyn) by 15 min and marked gas trapping compared with control lungs. Conditioning the room air did not attenuate these changes, but when 5% CO2 was added to the conditioned postmortem inspirate, gas trapping was eliminated and the fall in Cdyn was almost abolished. Ventilation with a dry 5% CO2 gas mixture at room temperature resulted in a 31% fall in Cdyn at 15 min but no gas trapping. We conclude that marked abnormalities of airway function occur postmortem in room air-ventilated guinea pig lungs in the absence of pulmonary blood loss. The changes are mainly due to airway hypocarbia, a known cause of bronchoconstriction, but a reduction in Cdyn can also occur if there is marked airway cooling and drying. Acute postmortem airway dysfunction can be prevented in the guinea pig by maintaining normal airway gas composition.\n\nReliability of postmortem fentanyl concentrations in determining the cause of death.\n\nPubMed\n\nGill, James R; Lin, Peter T; Nelson, Lewis\n\n2013-03-01\n\nTransdermal fentanyl, an opioid used for management of marked pain, also is abused and may cause death. We reviewed medical examiner reports of 92 decedents who had one or more fentanyl transdermal patches on their body and had fentanyl detected in their postmortem toxicology analysis. The manners of death included 40 accidents, 36 natural, 8 suicides, 5 therapeutic complications, and 3 undetermined deaths. Among the accidental fentanyl intoxication deaths, 32 of 37 involved substance abuse. The majority (95 %) of the 37 accidental deaths involving fentanyl were multi-drug intoxications. The substance abuse deaths had a mean fentanyl blood concentration (26.4 ng/ml or Î¼g/L) that was over twice that of the natural group (11.8 ng/ml). Our analysis suggests a relationship between total patch dosage and mean postmortem fentanyl concentration up to the 100-Î¼g/h dose. The very wide and overlapping ranges of postmortem fentanyl concentrations effectively nullify the utility of correlating the dose and expected postmortem concentration for any particular death. Based on the variable relationship between dose and blood concentration, the antemortem dose cannot be reliably predicted based on the postmortem concentration. This does not, however, render the medical examiner/coroner unable to determine the cause and manner of death because the toxicology results are only one datum point among several that are considered. Although there was a weakly positive relationship between body mass index and fentanyl concentration, further research is needed to determine whether adipose tissue represents a significant depot for postmortem release of fentanyl.\n\nPostmortem aviation forensic toxicology: an overview.\n\nPubMed\n\nChaturvedi, Arvind K\n\n2010-05-01\n\nAn overview of the subtopic aviation combustion toxicology of the field of aerospace toxicology has been published. In a continuation of the overview, the findings associated with postmortem aviation forensic toxicology are being summarized in the present overview. A literature search for the period of 1960-2007 was performed. The important findings related to postmortem toxicology were evaluated. In addition to a brief introduction, this overview is divided into the sections of analytical methods; carboxyhemoglobin and blood cyanide ion; ethanol; drugs; result interpretation; glucose and hemoglobin A(1c); and references. Specific details of the subject matter were discussed. It is anticipated that this overview will be an outline source for aviation forensic toxicology within the field of aerospace toxicology.\n\nEvaluation of Intraosseous Fluid as an Alternative Biological Specimen in Postmortem Toxicology.\n\nPubMed\n\nRodda, Luke N; Volk, Justin A; Moffat, Ellen; Williams, Chinyere M; Lynch, Kara L; Wu, Alan H B\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe postmortem redistribution phenomenon is an important factor in the interpretation of blood drug concentrations as a cause or factor in death. Intraosseous fluid (IOF) may serve as an alternative matrix for drug testing. Intraosseous fluid was collected from the left and right tibias and humerus of 29 decedents using the Arrow EZ-IO Intraosseous Vascular Access System. Standard autopsy specimens including blood were also collected at the same time during autopsy. Blood and IOF specimens were screened by immunoassay for opioids, fentanyl analogs, oxycodone, methadone, cocaine, methamphetamine, amphetamines, phencyclidine, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines and cannabinoids, using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Correlation between cardiac/central blood ELISA and IOF ELISA results was mostly 100% for drug targets. Further blood confirmation analysis was performed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry also showed comparable correlation to IOF screen results. There was no significant difference between the IOF sites or sides of the body. This novel study supports the use of IOF as an alternative postmortem specimen for toxicological investigations as a potentially less-compromised tissue in decomposed or traumatized bodies. Preliminary data is provided for the screening of common drugs of abuse in IOF that may show to be subject to alternative rates of postmortem redistribution than to that of other biological specimens in future studies that quantitate IOF drug concentrations.\n\nCharacterization of postmortem biochemical changes in rabbit plasma using ATR-FTIR combined with chemometrics: A preliminary study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Ji; Li, Bing; Wang, Qi; Li, Chengzhi; Zhang, Yinming; Lin, Hancheng; Wang, Zhenyuan\n\n2017-02-01\n\nPostmortem interval (PMI) determination is one of the most challenging tasks in forensic medicine due to a lack of accurate and reliable methods. It is especially difficult for late PMI determination. Although many attempts with various types of body fluids based on chemical methods have been made to solve this problem, few investigations are focused on blood samples. In this study, we employed an attenuated total reflection (ATR)-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) technique coupled with principle component analysis (PCA) to monitor biochemical changes in rabbit plasma with increasing PMI. Partial least square (PLS) model was used based on the spectral data for PMI prediction in an independent sample set. Our results revealed that postmortem chemical changes in compositions of the plasma were time-dependent, and various components including proteins, lipids and nucleic acids contributed to the discrimination of the samples at different time points. A satisfactory prediction within 48 h postmortem was performed by the combined PLS model with a good fitting between actual and predicted PMI of 0.984 and with an error of Â± 1.92 h. In consideration of the simplicity and portability of ATR-FTIR, our preliminary study provides an experimental and theoretical basis for application of this technique in forensic practice.\n\nApplication of contrast media in post-mortem imaging (CT and MRI).\n\nPubMed\n\nGrabherr, Silke; Grimm, Jochen; Baumann, Pia; Mangin, Patrice\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe application of contrast media in post-mortem radiology differs from clinical approaches in living patients. Post-mortem changes in the vascular system and the absence of blood flow lead to specific problems that have to be considered for the performance of post-mortem angiography. In addition, interpreting the images is challenging due to technique-related and post-mortem artefacts that have to be known and that are specific for each applied technique. Although the idea of injecting contrast media is old, classic methods are not simply transferable to modern radiological techniques in forensic medicine, as they are mostly dedicated to single-organ studies or applicable only shortly after death. With the introduction of modern imaging techniques, such as post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) and post-mortem magnetic resonance (PMMR), to forensic death investigations, intensive research started to explore their advantages and limitations compared to conventional autopsy. PMCT has already become a routine investigation in several centres, and different techniques have been developed to better visualise the vascular system and organ parenchyma in PMCT. In contrast, the use of PMMR is still limited due to practical issues, and research is now starting in the field of PMMR angiography. This article gives an overview of the problems in post-mortem contrast media application, the various classic and modern techniques, and the issues to consider by using different media.\n\nCommon Postmortem Computed Tomography Findings Following Atraumatic Death: Differentiation between Normal Postmortem Changes and Pathologic Lesions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGonoi, Wataru; Okuma, Hidemi; Shirota, Go; Shintani, Yukako; Abe, Hiroyuki; Takazawa, Yutaka; Fukayama, Masashi; Ohtomo, Kuni\n\n2015-01-01\n\nComputed tomography (CT) is widely used in postmortem investigations as an adjunct to the traditional autopsy in forensic medicine. To date, several studies have described postmortem CT findings as being caused by normal postmortem changes. However, on interpretation, postmortem CT findings that are seemingly due to normal postmortem changes initially, may not have been mere postmortem artifacts. In this pictorial essay, we describe the common postmortem CT findings in cases of atraumatic in-hospital death and describe the diagnostic pitfalls of normal postmortem changes that can mimic real pathologic lesions. PMID:26175579\n\nUsability of Immunohistochemistry in Forensic Samples With Varying Decomposition.\n\nPubMed\n\nLesnikova, Iana; Schreckenbach, Marc Niclas; Kristensen, Maria Pihlmann; Papanikolaou, Liv Lindegaard; Hamilton-Dutoit, Stephen\n\n2018-05-24\n\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) is an important diagnostic tool in anatomic and surgical pathology but is used less frequently in forensic pathology. Degradation of tissue because of postmortem decomposition is believed to be a major limiting factor, although it is unclear what impact such degradation actually has on IHC staining validity. This study included 120 forensic autopsy samples of liver, lung, and brain tissues obtained for diagnostic purposes. The time from death to autopsy ranged between 1 and more than 14 days. Samples were prepared using the tissue microarray technique. The antibodies chosen for the study included KL1 (for staining bile duct epithelium), S100 (for staining glial cells and myelin), vimentin (for endothelial cells in cerebral blood vessels), and CD45 (for pulmonary lymphocytes). Slides were evaluated by light microscopy. Immunohistochemistry reactions were scored according to a system based on the extent and intensity of the positive stain. An overall correlation between the postmortem interval and the IHC score for all tissue samples was found. Samples from decedents with a postmortem interval of 1 to 3 days showed positive staining with all antibodies, whereas samples from decedents with a longer postmortem interval showed decreased staining rates. Our results suggest that IHC analysis can be successfully used for postmortem diagnosis in a range of autopsy samples showing lesser degrees of decomposition.\n\nSex-related differences in the thanatomicrobiome in postmortem heart samples using bacterial gene regions V1-2 and V4.\n\nPubMed\n\nBell, Courtnee R; Wilkinson, Jeremy E; Robertson, Boakai K; Javan, Gulnaz T\n\n2018-05-10\n\nRecent studies have revealed distinct thanatomicrobiome (microbiome of death) signatures in human body sites after death. Thanatomicrobiome studies suggest that microbial succession after death may have the potential to reveal important postmortem biomarkers for the identification of time of death. We surveyed the postmortem microbiomes of cardiac tissues from ten corpses with varying times of death (6-58 h) using amplicon-based sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene' V1-2 and V4 hypervariable regions. The results demonstrated thatÂ ampliconsÂ had statistically significant (p <0.05) sex-dependent changes.Â Clostridium sp.,Â Pseudomonas sp., Pantoea sp., and Streptococcus sp.Â had the highest enrichment for both V1-2 and V4 regions. Interestingly, the results also show that V4 amplicons had higher abundance ofÂ Clostridium sp.Â andÂ Pseudomonas sp.Â in female hearts compared to males. Additionally,Â Streptococcus sp.Â was solely found in male heart samples. The distinction between sexes was further supported by Principle Coordinate Analysis, which revealed microbes in female hearts formed a distinctive cluster separate from male cadavers for both hypervariable regions. This study provides data that demonstrates that two hypervariable regions show discriminatory power for sex differences in postmortem heart samples. This article is protected by copyright.

The success of the patch can be attributed to fentanyl's low molecular weight and its highly lipophilic nature, which enables it to be readily absorbed through the skin and subsequently distributed throughout the body. Over the past three years, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Toxicology Laboratory has encountered 25 cases involving Duragesic patches (fentanyl), and their postmortem tissue distributions are presented here. The analysis of fentanyl from postmortem specimens (3-mL or g sample size) consisted of an n-butyl chloride basic extraction followed by identification and quantitation on a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer using the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The fentanyl ions monitored were m/z 245, 146, and 189 and the internal standard, fentanyl-d5 ions, were m/z 250, 151, and 194 (quantitation ion underlined). The linear range of the assay was 1.67 microg/L to 500 microg/L with the limit of quantitation and detection of 1.67 microg/L. The postmortem tissue distribution ranges of fentanyl in the 25 fatalities were as follows: heart blood, 1.8-139 microg/L (23 cases); femoral blood, 3.1-43 microg/L (13 cases); vitreous, +<2.0-20 microg/L (4 cases); liver, 5.8-613 microg/kg (22 cases); bile, 3.5-262 microg/L (15 cases); urine, 2.9-895 microg/L (19 cases); gastric, 0-1200 microg total (17 cases); spleen, 7.8-79 microg/kg (3 cases); kidney, 11 microg/kg (1 case); and lung, 31 microg/kg (1 case). The age of the decedents in this study ranged from 19 to 84, with an average age of 46. The modes of death included 15 accidental, 5 natural, 3 suicidal, and 2 undetermined. The main objectives of this paper are to show the prevalence of fentanyl patches in our community and to aid the forensic toxicologist with the interpretation of postmortem fentanyl levels in casework.\n\nBest-practices approach to determination of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at specific time points: Combination of ante-mortem alcohol pharmacokinetic modeling and post-mortem alcohol generation and transport considerations.\n\nPubMed\n\nCowan, Dallas M; Maskrey, Joshua R; Fung, Ernest S; Woods, Tyler A; Stabryla, Lisa M; Scott, Paul K; Finley, Brent L\n\n2016-07-01\n\nAlcohol concentrations in biological matrices offer information regarding an individual's intoxication level at a given time. In forensic cases, the alcohol concentration in the blood (BAC) at the time of death is sometimes used interchangeably with the BAC measured post-mortem, without consideration for alcohol concentration changes in the body after death. However, post-mortem factors must be taken into account for accurate forensic determination of BAC prior to death to avoid incorrect conclusions. The main objective of this work was to describe best practices for relating ante-mortem and post-mortem alcohol concentrations, using a combination of modeling, empirical data and other qualitative considerations. The Widmark modeling approach is a best practices method for superimposing multiple alcohol doses ingested at various times with alcohol elimination rate adjustments based on individual body factors. We combined the selected ante-mortem model with a suggestion for an approach used to roughly estimate changes in BAC post-mortem, and then analyzed the available data on post-mortem alcohol production in human bodies and potential markers for alcohol production through decomposition and putrefaction. Hypothetical cases provide best practice approaches as an example for determining alcohol concentration in biological matrices ante-mortem, as well as potential issues encountered with quantitative post-mortem approaches. This study provides information for standardizing BAC determination in forensic toxicology, while minimizing real world case uncertainties. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The mice model of emamectin benzoate poisoning was established via intragastric injection. The main poisoning symptoms and the clinical death times of mice were observed and recorded dynamically in the acute poisoning group as well as the sub-acute poisoning death group. The pathological and histomorphological changes of organs and tissues were observed after poisoning death. The biodistribution and postmortem redistribution of emamectin benzoate in the organs and tissues of mice were assayed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at 0h, 24h, 48h and 72h after death. The lethal blood concentrations and the concentrations of emamectin benzoate were detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at different time points after death. The symptoms of nervous and respiratory system were observed within 15-30 min after intragastric injection. The average time of death was (45.8 Â± 7.9) min in the acute poisoning group and (8.0 Â± 1.4) d in the sub-acute poisoning group, respectively. The range of acute lethal blood level was 447.164 0-524.463 5 mg/L. The pathological changes of the organs and tissues were observed via light microscope and immunofluorescence microscope. The changes of emamectin benzoate content in the blood, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and brain of poisoning mice showed regularity within 72 h after death (P < 0.05). The target organs of emamectin benzoate poisoning include heart, liver, kidney, lung, brain and contact position (stomach). The toxicant storage depots are kidney and liver. There is emamectin benzoate postmortem redistribution in mice.\n\nManual versus automated blood sampling: impact of repeated blood sampling on stress parameters and behavior in male NMRI mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKalliokoski, Otto; SÃ¸rensen, Dorte B; Hau, Jann; Abelson, Klas S P\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFacial vein (cheek blood) and caudal vein (tail blood) phlebotomy are two commonly used techniques for obtaining blood samples from laboratory mice, while automated blood sampling through a permanent catheter is a relatively new technique in mice. The present study compared physiological parameters, glucocorticoid dynamics as well as the behavior of mice sampled repeatedly for 24âh by cheek blood, tail blood or automated blood sampling from the carotid artery. Mice subjected to cheek blood sampling lost significantly more body weight, had elevated levels of plasma corticosterone, excreted more fecal corticosterone metabolites, and expressed more anxious behavior than did the mice of the other groups. Plasma corticosterone levels of mice subjected to tail blood sampling were also elevated, although less significantly. Mice subjected to automated blood sampling were less affected with regard to the parameters measured, and expressed less anxious behavior. We conclude that repeated blood sampling by automated blood sampling and from the tail vein is less stressful than cheek blood sampling. The choice between automated blood sampling and tail blood sampling should be based on the study requirements, the resources of the laboratory and skills of the staff.
