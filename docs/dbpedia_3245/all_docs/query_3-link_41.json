        "text": "1. Bringing in Mindset and CultureChange How to do it? Nitin Mittal Agile, DevOps & DesignThinking Coach SPC, CSP, CSM, CDA,PMP, ITIL By Nitin Mittal\n\n2. Agenda • Understanding Mindset • Understanding Culture • Ecosystem of Mindset and Culture • Honest Indicators of Agile Mindset and culture • Enabling behavior changes By Nitin Mittal\n\n3. What is Mindset? It’s a mental attitude that determines how you will interpret and respond to situations Or simply Way of Thinking By Nitin Mittal\n\n4. Type of Mindset • People with fixed mindsets believe that they are what they are and cannot change. They want to be praised and not challenged. • Those with growth mindsets want to get better and are accepting of people who point out their shortcomings. • If you get a thrill from what’s easy, you may have a fixed mindset. If you enjoy what is difficult, you may have a growth mindset. Obstacle Challenge Effort Criticism Success of Others Avoid Challenges Give up easily See Effort as Fruitless Ignore useful negative feedback Feel threatened by success of others Embrace Challenges Persist during setbacks See effort as path to mastery Learn from criticism Find lessons and inspiration from success of others By Nitin Mittal\n\n5. So what is agile mindset?  Aligned to Growth Mindset  View failure as learning opportunity, something which provides new information  Learning is the primary goal  Believe that effort lead to mastery, Continuous improvement  And many more.. By Nitin Mittal\n\n6. What is Culture?  What is DNA to a human, culture is to an organization  Essentially culture is to a team, program or company, what mindset is to an individual  Culture is the soul of organization, the believes and values and how they are manifested  The way things get done By Nitin Mittal Culture eats strategy for breakfast. —Peter Drucker Cultural change comes last, not first\n\n7. Ecosystem of Mindset and Culture Mindset of an individual s Influences Culture of that group Culture of a group influences mindset of individuals part of that group B E H A V I O R Culture and Mindset influences behaviors By Nitin Mittal\n\n8. Behaviors are the only honest indicator of prevailing mindset and culture Behavior of the people in the team indicates the real culture. Some examples: • Not starting or finishing meetings on time • Disrespecting employees • Don’t let anyone speak and frequently interrupt in the meetings • Blaming people • Using people for your own benefits • Yes boss mindset • And many more.. By Nitin Mittal\n\n9. What are some of the key Behaviors that support Agile mindset & Culture? Transparency at all Levels Diversity ofThoughtsValued Team spirit over individual heroes Continuous ImprovementTreat Failure as learning opportunity Knowledge Sharing By Nitin Mittal\n\n10. Enabling Behavior Changes 1. Apply Servant Leadership 2. Align Metrics to expected Behaviors 3. Levelling Environment at work 4. Unlock intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers 5. Call out the gap in expected Behaviors 6. Link behavior changes to business outcome By Nitin Mittal\n\n11. Enabling Behavior Changes: Apply Servant Leadership By Nitin Mittal “Lets go Do it” NOT “You go do it” Values Diverse Opinion Cultivate culture of Trust Care about people’s life not just work Sacrifice some today to develop more tomorrow Sell and Persuade, NOT command and control Develop Leaders\n\n12. Enabling Behavior Changes: Align Metrics to expected Behaviors Tell me how you measure me and I will tell you how I will behave – Eliyahu goldratt. Expecting different behaviors is pointless if the way people are measured continues to reward the nonaligned behaviors. For ex if expected behavior is that people should collaborate but if reward is given to an individual level output, don’t expect people to collaborate If expectation is that people should innovate but if failures are punished then its pointless to expect people to do experimentation By Nitin Mittal\n\n13. Enabling Behavior Changes: Levelling Environment at work • Treat everyone equally • Every person has equal opportunity, access to benefits, perks, facilities. • No favors in promotion, pay, hiring. For ex: If lunch is served in office, everyone in office should have access to same food regardless of seniority. Zero tolerance policy should be applied same to all levels By Nitin Mittal\n\n14. Enabling Behavior Changes: Unlock Intrinsic Motivation Unlock intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers- 3 Key aspects: Autonomy: desire to be self-directed, feel in control and drive your own work Mastery: the urge to better yourself at something that matters. Purpose: desire to do something meaningful or something that makes a difference By Nitin Mittal\n\n15. Enabling Behavior Changes: Call out gap in expected behavior Let people know what expected behaviors are and Call out the gaps It is possible that everyone will not exhibit the desired behavior in beginning, however it is important that they realize what is expected behavior that they are not following. During a course of time, this will influence change of mindset and eventually culture where everyone will start to implement desired behaviors For ex- It is expected that everyone should attend meeting in person, on time and meeting should finish 5 mins before scheduled end time. Teams may struggle to follow this in the beginning but with conscious effort and knowing what is expected, team will soon start to change behavior and eventually culture. By Nitin Mittal\n\n16. Enabling Behavior Changes: Link Behavior change to Business outcome When people see how a set of behaviors have positive impact on the outcome, these behaviors will be spread. For ex- Where diversity of thoughts are valued and everyone is encouraged to come up with ideas. It is bound to happen that new ideas will come on different days and will have an impact on the outcome- either process, technology, business value etc. Once people see the benefits of diversity of thoughts, it becomes a norm or a culture in a team or organization By Nitin Mittal"
