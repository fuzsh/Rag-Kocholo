        "text": "Dear Friends,\n\nALREADY AUGUST: I am writing this column on August 1st. There are a lot of feasts and commemorations this month particularly precious to Passionists. August 6th the Transfiguration, Peter, James and John witness his glory on Tabor. A short time later the same three, witness his Agony in the Garden when he sweats blood and cries out for help. August 15th, Mary is Assumed into Heaven, a holy day of obligation and a sacred day for so many of us Passionists. It was the day on which so many of us became Passionists. It was an especially common practice for American Passionists to take their vows on the feast of Mary’s Assumption. I did so in 1965, 59years ago this month in this church into the hands of Fr. Gerard Rooney, who was Provincial then. One of our many saints and blessed has his feast day this month. On August 26th, we celebrate the feast day of Blessed Dominic Barberi, Passionist priest. He was beatified during the Second Vatican Council by Pope St. Paul VI and held up as a model of ecumenism for all priests. He received the great Cardinal John Newman into the Catholic Church. We will pray this month to all these greats at our Holy Hour.\n\nST. MARIA GORETTI MOSAIC: This past Tuesday the mosaic behind the St. Maria Goretti statue was installed. It appears as a window through which you see the outside countryside of the Nettuno area where she was killed. It was digitally produced and replicates the landscape. Our particular statue depicts her resisting the sexual advances of her neighbor, Allesandro. That white marble statue of St. Maria Goretti with arm raised has her fending off her attacker. It is an exact replica of the statue under the main altar of the church in Corinaldo, Italy where there is a beautiful shrine to her. At the entrance to that church, if you turn to your left, is the tomb of St. Maria’s mother, Assunta Goretti. Turn to the right is the tomb of Allesandro Serenelli, who murdered St. Maria Goretti. After nearly 30 years in prison and repentant, he asked her mother for forgiveness. Assunta gave forgiveness. Allesandro died a Franciscan brother. St. Maria was taught by the Passionists in Netuno. Made her first Communion and confession with the Passionists. Fr. Jerome, an Italian Passionist, ministered to her when she was dying and heard her forgiving her attacker. I pray that shrine will be a place of forgiveness and strength for all who pray there. Whether the prayer is for strength to be pure and chaste, or the grace of repentance of failures, or for forgiveness of misdeeds. I pray that shrine will be a place of forgiveness and strength. Pope Francis in one of the first letters he wrote as Pope spoke to priests these words to be shared with all their penitents: “God is more anxious to forgive us than we are to be forgiven.” “Nothing we could ever do would make God love us less.” I hope that shrine becomes a place of great holiness\n\nHOLY HOUR – AUGUST 13TH: One of the nicest services we have each month is the Holy Hour for Vocations. We again have it this month on Tuesday evening, August 13th at 7:00pm. I find it very simple and very inspiring. All we do is adore the Lord exposed in the Eucharist. We have rosary and benediction and beautiful music and song. Andrea brings along a cantor and musicians that just enhance that Holy Hour. I always ask one of our Passionist Saints or Blesseds to accompany us. Maybe this month, I can ask St. Maria Goretti to accompany us. We can ask her to inspire some young people to become Passionist priests, sisters and brothers\n\nGENERAL CHAPTER APPROACES: In the past week, I finalized my plans for attending the General Chapter and made the plane reservations. Fr. General has asked all the members of the Chapter to arrive some days prior to its opening the first week of October. The Chapter goes the entire month and closes the 26th of October. I plan to arrive a few days early by the end of September and take a little vacation before it begins. The General Chapter is held every six years. There are about 75 members from all the areas where there are Passionists located in our world. They are to review how Passionist life is lived and apostolates served. They make proposals on how to better things always being faithful to the initial charism of St. Paul of the Cross. Then they elect a Superior General to stand in the place of St. Paul of the Cross and lead the community. Consultors are chosen for him from the various regions of the world. I am very honored to be an elected delegate and did not expect it. I will do my best and pray hard. Pray for me.\n\nWith much gratitude and prayers, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends,\n\nFRIDAY FOOD BANK: I am writing this bulletin column on Thursday morning. I had been at the Passionist Nuns in Carrick for their Mass this morning. They prepared beautifully for the feast of the Apostle, St. James. I was thinking what an honor it is for this monastery to serve those Sisters. Their entire life is dedicated to Christ Crucified by contemplation and prayer. When I returned back to the monastery at 9am, I saw Rusty Wilcox and Stuart Wait, our employees, unloading our pick-up van of cans of vegetables, rice crispies and all kinds of foods for our food bank on Friday. Once a week, we have a food line and help feed 50 or so families. Rusty and Stuart were getting ready for that. “Whatever you do to the least one, you do for me.” I no sooner returned and went to have some breakfast when my call bell rang. I was assigned as confessor for that Thursday till 1pm. Someone had come in for confession. We hear confessions every day, except Sunday, from 9am to 5pm. Wednesday mornings, the exception, we try to spend the morning in prayer. Then we begin hearing confessions at 1pm. St. Paul of the Cross wanted our monasteries to be “a refuge for sinners” where people were forgiven. Certainly, this monastery has been that for over 170 years. Just as I am writing this bulletin, I have been called to the front door confessional five times. And that’s beautiful!\n\nMISSION TRIP FROM GREENVILLE: There is a group of young people from Greenville, NC here this week for the annual Mission Trip. Joe Farris, Joe Blick, and a number of lay people started that tradition around the year 2000 when I was Pastor there. I came each year with the young people and was the priest for their Masses, Penance Service and Prayer Services. I left Greenville in 2013. They were a wonderful 15 years. I will help tonight with the confessions. It makes me so proud when they say something like: “Father, my parents told me you baptized me.” That was one of the very beautiful assignments God has allowed me to have!\n\nMOSAIC IS ARRIVING: I received the good news two days ago from the Rugo Stone Company. St. Maria Goretti Shrine mosaic will arrive in Pittsburgh on Monday, July 29th and be installed on the side wall July 30th. Once that is completed. We will get kneelers and have prayer cards to St. Maria and special prayers for her help in fidelity to Jesus\n\nFR. JOSEPH FROM PAPUA, NEW GUNIEA: A young Passionist was preaching in behalf of Passionist Missionaries to raise money to train their seminarians. He passed through our house here two weeks ago. He spoke to me of how impressed he was with our life here. The programs in the retreat house, the holy hour in the church, fidelity of the CP community to prayer, the Wednesday adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. He said, “ I would love to live here. “ Please God, we can get some more Passionists.\n\nTICKET FOR THE GENERAL CHAPTER: Fr. General sent around a letter to all the Members of the 48th General Chapter. He asked if we could arrive a little early to adjust and get to know the members of the Chapter meeting. I bought my ticket the other day and am leaving at the end of September. I will arrive a few days early and return Oct. 29th. He wants us to familiarize ourselves with Rome and the other members of the Chapter from around the world as we will be the electors for the next Fr. General. I am looking forward to it. Pray all goes well.\n\nWith my gratitude and prayers,\n\nFr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends,\n\nHOLY HOUR THIS PAST TUESDAY: Thank you to those who came for the Holy Hour. The church was hot and still there was a good attendance. Andrea, our music director, always invites musicians and a volunteer vocalist who make it a very special hour of prayer. After praying over each person, we conclude with benediction. Each month, it is customary to invite one of our Passionist Saints or Blesseds to accompany us and teach us to love Christ Crucified. This past month I prayed to the Servant of God, Theodore Foley, and asked him to bless our Province and House and all those present. I told a few little stories I know about him and read a letter he wrote me from Rome, when he was General and I was being ordained a priest in 1972.\n\nFR.THEODORE FOLEY: He was a holy Passionist Priest. He was born in Massachusetts in 1913. He professed his vows as a Passionist in 1933. He was ordained in 1940. Taught theology, trained seminarians, was elected Rector of this Pittsburgh house in 1956. Served as Assistant to Fr. General, was elected Superior General in 1964. In that role, he served as the successor of St. Paul of the Cross for ten years directing and visiting Passionist Communities around the globe. During his last visitations to missions in Indonesia, he contracted a disease. Upon his return to Rome, he was hospitalized and died on Oct. 9, 1974. He participated as a Father of the Second Vatican Council. He was highly respected by St. Pope Paul VI and the holy Jesuit General, Pedro Arupe. I met him when I was a Deacon and sat next to him at a meeting! I am honored to have had his room when I was stationed in Jamaica, NY. The office I use here in Pittsburgh was used by him, also. He wrote me when I was ordained in 1972 and I keep that letter in my Passionist Rule book. I have no doubt that he is a saint and will one day be canonized. We are honored to have his shrine in our church where his body rests. During our last holy hour, I read to the people the letter he wrote me when I became a priest. We had invited him to be with us as our special Passionist Guest!\n\nYOUTH FROM GREENVILLE: Welcome our youth from Greenville, NC. Many a summer, as Pastor, I came here with our youth for that mission trip. Joe Farris led the group. Our Fr. Pat Daugherty, Fr. Pat Geinzer, Fr. Ed Wolanski also participated. It was a wonderful week. I help a little now with their confessions. Many of them say, “Father, you baptized me.” Then I tell them: “Then, I pray for you.” And that I do. St. Augustine wrote: “You have an obligation to pray for those you baptize.” I have kept a list begun March 21, 1971 when I was a Deacon. As of today, #1 is Sherry Frances and #1,017 is Zachary Dylan. I do pray for them!\n\nMANY HANDS PRODUCE A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN: Our gardens are more beautiful than ever. People have asked to walk through them and pray. As long as a retreat is not going on, I always say yes. Thank you to our maintenance crew directed and headed by Rusty Wilcox, who seems to keep so much afloat these days. Rusty and John O’Neil have been the main stays over the past years. They are joined by Stuart Wait this summer. Thank you for the lawns, the gardens, the planting, the watering and all the maintenance. Dave Sylvester, whose generosity enabled the new walks and enabled wonderful renovations. Along with Fred Watke and Ron Sestili, we put up trees and bushes and plants and statues over these past years. Thank you. Thank you from retreat House, Monastery, Associates and Friends.\n\nI want to tell you about the 4 paintings in the church, a communication from Fr. General regarding the General Chapter. Completion of the Maria Goretti Shrine, Stay tuned for next week.\n\nWith thanks and much gratitude, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends,\n\nTHE BEAUTY OF GOD’S HOUSE: This past week Mother Superior of all the Passionist Nuns convents in the world made a visitation of our Passionist Nuns here in Carrick. Mother Joyce, Superior here, called and asked if I could show Mother Catherine Marie and Sr. Daniela this Passionist Monastery and Retreat House. On Thursday, I took 4 Nuns on a tour. They said how beautiful the church was and the gardens and how Passionist it all was. The solitude of the gardens and the beauty of the newly renovated church were very impressive to them. We all prayed at the tomb of Fr. Theodore Foley, Servant of God, in the back of the church. This was one of the main reasons Mother Catherine wanted to come here. Fr. Theodore was very much devoted to the Passionist Nuns and encouraged their vocations and contemplative life. They also wanted to see the crypt where Fr. Anthony Calandri, one of the saintly founders of this monastery, is buried. He was reputed to have had the gift of healing. It was very beautiful and we prayed at the various places for the well-being and fidelity of the Passionists all over the world. Three of our missionary bishops are also buried in that crypt: Bishop Cuthbert O’Gara of China, Bishop Quentin Olwell and Bishop Reginal Arliss, both missionaries in the Philippine Islands. I knew Bishop Cuthbert as a sixth grader when he returned to our monastery in Union City, New Jersey after spending nearly five years in solitary confinement in a Chinese jail for his loyalty to the faith. I remember after released from prison at a vocation program he let me sit next to him and I saw his bishop’s ring with the Passionist sign on it. I remember thinking this is a man like the early martyrs of the church who would die for Jesus. Bishop Quentin ordained me a Deacon. Bishop Reginald returned from the Philippines to ordain my class as Passionist priests in 1972. After the crypt, I took the Nuns into the gardens and showed the beautiful renovations there. The Visitors talked of the beauty of the place but especially how Passionist everything was. I reminded them that Fr. Anthony Calandri wrote Fr. General after they had acquired this site in 1853 for the first Passionist Monastery in the new world. He wrote to Fr. General, Fr. Anthony Testa. He told him he would love this place because it has the beauty and solitude of Monte Argentario. That beauty continues today in this very special place. I thank Mother Catherine Marie for cherishing it.\n\nTHE BEAUTY OF OUR GROUNDS: Then the next day on this past Friday, I was called to the front door to greet a man visiting from Brazil who wanted to stop here. He told me he was a lay Passionist, the leader of the Passionist Associates in Brazil and wanted to visit this monastery. He had heard of this monastery as pivotal to all the foundations in the new world. In my English\n\nand a little Spanish and his Portugese and a little English, we tried to communicate. I gave him a tour and he loved the place. The beauty of the church, the retreat house, the gardens. He told me this was the high light of his entire trip to America. He presented me with a beautifully framed wooden Passionist sign which he carved himself. I was deeply touched. I was the confessor yesterday and so had a few interruptions which he understood and appreciated how the Passionists always have time for confessions. I gave him as much time as I could and wanted to give him a gift. I remember I had a bag with a few articles I had gotten in Rome six years ago. I chose two things a large Passionist pin and a first- class relic of St. Gemma Galgani. He thanked me for the pin and then told me something. In his parish church in Brazil, he and the Pastor had just finished building a shrine to St. Gemma Galgani. “This relic will be venerated there.” Then he said that he was grateful and now understood why he had come to the U.S.A. and how he loves the Passionists. So do I!\n\nTHE MONTHLY HOLY HOUR: Please try to come out for the beautiful Holy Hour for Vocations. It will be this coming Tuesday, July 16th at 7:00pm – Adoration, Prayer, Singing, Rosary and the beauty of Jesus!\n\nWith my gratitude and prayers, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P.\n\nDear Friends,\n\nBL. SACRAMENT PROCESSION IN OUR GARDEN – SUNDAY, JUNE 30TH:\n\nFollowing the 10:30 Mass next Sunday, we will have a procession through our beautiful gardens carrying the monstrance with the Eucharist. It will be prayerful with some singing. Then we will have refreshments outside. We had hoped to have this for Corpus Christi. Everything is ready now and our gardens beautified. I thank all those who worked and contributed to the beauty. A beautiful to honor Christ in the Eucharist. All are welcome.\n\nHOLY HOUR THIS PAST WEEK: Thank you for coming out to pray for vocations at the Holy Hour. Next week, a member of our province from Puerto Rico will be ordained a priest there, Fr. Cristian Martinez. We congratulate him and assure him of our prayers.\n\nVAGABOND MISSIONARIES: These are young people who evangelize young people and get them to church through a lot of street ministry. They are located in about 16 sites across the United States. There is a group in Greenville, NC. Joe Farris, our youth minister there, made contact with them. Then when I came here, Joe Farris made contact with the Vagabond Missionaries in Pittsburgh at 2 sites. I told them they are always welcome at our monastery. This past week, as they do from time to time, they asked if they could make a day of recollection here. They asked if I would say Mass and give them a meditation on the Passion of Christ. Happily! They are always welcome.\n\nPASSIONIST NUNS: One of the best parts of being in Pittsburgh, is being near our Passionist Nuns. We go to their convent each morning, taking turns, to celebrate the Eucharist for them. It is an honor and a beautiful duty. Their lives, hidden with Christ in prayer, very much inspires me.\n\nFR. RICHARD NALEPA: Fr. Richard has come through his knee replacement surgery and is back to driving and serving the community here in Pittsburgh generously. All went well. Thank you for your prayers and concern.\n\nFR. CURTIS KIDDY: Fr. Curtis is back from a little vacation time. The retreat house is going well. Fr. Curtis will represent us this coming week at Fr. Cristian’s ordination. They studied together. Curtis will represent our house.\n\nST. MARIA GORETTI SHRINE: I spoke with the creator of the mosaic this past Friday. He apologized for the delay. We are scheduled for the installation in our church of that beautiful mosaic behind the St. Maria Goretti statue during the last week of July. There are kneelers etc. also being made. The company had a backlog of projects. Brett has assured me the work will go on in our church the last week of July. The statue is a duplicate of the one in Coronaldo, Italy at Maria’s shrine there. St. Maria Goretti’s mother, Assunta, is buried in the back wall of the church on the left side. On the right side, Alessandro Serenelli, is buried. He attempted to rape and murdered her. He repented after decades in jail and died a Franciscan Brother. Mama Assunta forgave him and received Holy Communion with him in that church after his release. I want our shrine to be a place of purity, healing, forgiveness, mercy and love.\n\nWith love and gratitude for all your help, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends,\n\nLaudato Si Committee: This group has continued to beautify our property. They meet regularly to study Pope Francis’ documents and asked me to make this request, “Do you like to garden? Do you love the Monastery gardens? The St. Paul Laudato Si team can use your help to maintain them. No expertise needed, just willingness to work. We’re meeting the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Tuesdays of the month at 4:30 pm. Join us at the St. Paul Garden between the Church and Monastery Office. For more information, email Rose at roseannlord7@gmail.com or call 412.951.7224 and leave a message.”\n\nCorpus Christi: This Sunday we celebrate this beautiful feast of the Body of Christ. Our Passionist tradition when we entered the Monastery we received a new name, as our Founder St. Paul of the Cross and his brother John Baptist of St. Michael did. I received the name Justin and was given permission to add “of the Blessed Sacrament.” I love this feast especially. Today we thank God for the wonderful gift of His Body and Blood. We receive the Lord Who wants to be with us. That thought alone moves us to prayer. We will have a beautiful procession through our Garden after the 10 am Mass on June 30. The Passionist Associates will provide coffee and some refreshments following the procession.\n\nAll are invited and can see the gardens, all beautiful!\n\nMonthly Holy Hour: For the month of June, our beautiful Holy Hour will be on Tuesday, June 11, at 7 pm. Please join us as we pray for Passionist vocations. It is a beautiful time of quiet, prayer, and song. It is growing in attendance! I look forward to it each month.\n\nSt. Maria Goretti Shrine: Work is being done on the background mosaic at the studios. I had hoped it would be installed by her feast day in July. I will check on the progress later this week. It will honor our modern martyr.\n\nSt. John Fidelis McMillan: Many of you have asked how he is doing. I saw him last week and he is fine. We told him all is well here and that many of you still ask about him. He wants to be remembered to all. His niece, Mary McGee, recently sent photos of his 100th birthday party in our Jamaica, NY Monastery last fall. He is still going strong! I put the pictures on the Community Bulletin Board in our private quarters so we Fathers can see him at his party, surrounded by generations of nieces and nephews, all of whom sent a generous donation to our Monastery to honor their uncle. We are grateful.\n\nWith love and prayers, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends:\n\nSCHEDULE CHANGES – Due to the PASSIONIST ASSEMBLY: Our Superior has called a meeting of all the professed Passionists in the eastern United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. We meet in Jamaica, NY from May 21 to 23. Fr. Joe at 88 is excused. Fr. Richard is getting through a knee replacement and cannot drive. The rest of us head to New York on the 20th and return by the 24th. Masses, Confessions, Novena Services are canceled from Monday May 20th till and including Friday, May 24th. Our regular schedule of Masses and confessions resumes on Saturday, May 25th. An exception! Fr. Joe said he will offer a 12:10 Mass each day Monday through Friday, May 20 -24. Thank you, Joe.\n\nTHANK-YOU PASSIONIST ASSOCIATES: Last Sunday after the 10 am Mass, the Passionist Associates had a reception in the garden room for anyone who wanted to get together after Mass. They had prepared coffee and an assortment of fancy pastries etc. The best part wasn’t the nice refreshments. It was how everyone enjoyed that time to catch up and have an opportunity to chat. Usually, retreats are being conducted and space isn’t available. People chatted and enjoyed the opportunity. For some it was a great hour! We are appreciative to the Associates for this thoughtful gathering.\n\nPASSIONIST NUNS ELECT SUPERIOR: On this past Friday, the Passionist Nuns, here in Pittsburgh, held their elections for Mother Superior. On the first ballot, Mother Mary Joyce, C.P. was re-elected Superior. Mother Catherine Marie, C.P., Superior General in Rome, had appointed the Rector here to preside. Fr. Curtis tabulated the votes and after the first ballot, it was my honor to confirm Mother Joyce as the re-elected Superior. We ae all happy and assure her of our prayers and admiration\n\nVOCATIONS HOLY HOUR: This prayer time is scheduled for Tuesday, May 14th. I look forward to it each month – a beautiful hour of quiet and prayer before Jesus exposed in the Blessed Sacrament. The people attending is increasing. The music is beautiful, the prayer is moving and to be with Jesus in the quiet is a gift. Come see.\n\nOUR BEAUTIFUL CHURCH – PALLADIO AWARD: I am told by the architects who renovated our church, O’Brien and Keane, that the Palladio Award is a very prestigious award. It’s about the highest you can get and highly competitive. Our church was entered along with over 220 other entries. In all, 20 Awards are given. Our church won 1st place for renovation and interior design of a classical traditional building. The architects are delighted and are flying me up to Boston to receive the award with them. They said wear your Passionist habit to the dinner. I will be honored to.\n\nJOHN CARDELLO UPDATE: Our faithful friend and helper with everything in the church – set up, sacristy, collections, Mass, Benediction, Stations had a bad fall weeks ago. Has been with his son and daughter-in-law up by Grove City recuperating. I’ve been calling him to tell him we miss him. Couldn’t get through. I had the wrong number. Spoke with his son. John has an infection and is recuperating in the hospital. I connected up with him and he sends his best and his prayers..\n\nLIFE OF ST. PAUL OF THE CROSS PRESENTATION: Judy Callan, who oversees the formation of our Passionist Associates, lay people who desire to be more closely connected with our community and share in the charism of St. Paul of the Cross, asked me to give a presentation on the Life and Spirit of our Founder, St. Paul of the Cross. I did that on Thursday evening. If there were people who come here and would appreciate a presentation on the life and spirit of St. Paul of the Cross, I would be happy to show it again.\n\nWith gratitude,\n\nFr. Justin Kerber CP\n\nDear Friends,\n\nFr. Jerome McKenna, C.P.: His funeral and burial were here this past week. He was very much appreciated by his family, his Passionist Community, the dioceses where he was assigned, and the many people he served. He was the eldest of seven brothers, all born and raised here in Pittsburgh. Two brothers, Joseph and Regis, live here in Pittsburgh and his brother Robert is a Passionist Brother at our infirmary at our Jamaica, NY Monastery. Fr. Jerome was born April 13, 1930 and professed his vows as a Passioinist in 1951. He was ordained a priest in 1958. He died this past April 7 in Atlanta, where he was Pastor, the oldest active pastor in our country!\n\nFr. Jerome lived at our monastery in Rome following his ordination. He did further studies in Theology and obtained an advanced degree in Theology from the Angelicum University in Rome. In his 66 years of priesthood, he held may positions in our Passionist Communities and in the dioceses in which he served. He was Rector of this Monastery for 2 terms, Provincial Consultor, Provincial Secretary, and Director of Passionist Volunteers. He established various apostolates, serving many years as Pastor in West Virginia and in Atlanta, Georgia until his death. He even served as Vicar General for the entire diocese of Wheeling/Charleston. He was extremely capable and talented, and beyond that, a very good, holy, and dedicated Passionist priest.\n\nThe Archbishop of Atlanta celebrated a funeral Mass at St. Paul of the Cross Parish there and then Father’s body was transferred here. A funeral Mass was celebrated this past Friday with our Provincial, Fr. Jim O’Shea, C.P. as the main Celebrant. Archbishop Gregory Hartmayer of Atlanta and the Bishop of Wheeling/Charleston presided. Father is buried now in our Monastery cemetery next to the church. There are more than 125 Passionists buried there and in our Crypt.\n\nOn a personal note, I first met Fr. Jerome when he was a Deacon preparing for Ordination at Union City, NJ. I was a 7th grader who wanted to become a Passionist priest. He and his classmates impressed me as so kind. He was Rector here when I professed my vows in 1965. Last year, I asked him to fly up from Atlanta to be interviewed by the delegation that came from Rome, investigating the cause of canonization of Fr.Theodore Foley, C.P., for\n\nsainthood. Fr. Jerome had lived with Fr. Theodore for over 10 years in the USA and in Rome. At 92, he was a star witness and sharp as a tack. May God now welcome him into heaven with Theodore and all the holy Passionists.\n\nI have already asked him to send us some new vocations! Thank you, Fr. Jerome, for your goodness and dedication.\n\nWith gratitude, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P.\n\nDear Friends,\n\nFUNERAL OF FR. JEROME MCKENNA, C.P.: Fr. Jerome died In Atlanta, Georgia following a fall on April 7th, just six days before his 94th birthday. He was the oldest active Catholic Pastor in the USA. Fr. Jerome was a very likeable Passionist priest from a big family here in Pittsburgh. He took his vows in Pittsburgh in 1951and was ordained in 1958. He served in many important positions and was in in-charge of our Social Concerns. He had a degree from Rome. Worked with the Servant of God, Fr. Theodore Foley there. Was Rector of several monasteries including here at St. Paul’s. He served as Director of Social Concerns and as a Provincial Consultor. He served as Pastor in West Virginia for 20 years and was Vicar General of the Wheeling Diocese. His last assignment was Pastor of our parish in Atlanta, Georgia from 2009 till his death. He was a favorite of mine. I first met him in 1957 when he was a deacon in Union City, NJ. I attended his ordination as an 8th grader in April, 1958. He was Rector of this Monastery when I took vows in 1965. He came here last year to testify on behalf of Theodore Foley’s cause for canonization. At 93 he was still sharp as a tack and deeply loving our Passionist Community. He outdid himself-testifying in behalf of Fr. Theodore’s sanctity. May they now enjoy the presence of Jesus with Paul of the Cross and all the great Passionists who went ahead of them. The funeral Mass was held in Atlanta. Here at this Monastery, he will be viewed in the church Thursday April 18th, 3 to 9pm. The Mass of Christian Burial will be on Friday at 10:00am with burial in our cemetery. Fr. James O’Shea, C.P., our Provincial, will officiate. Atlanta’s Archbishop, Gregory Hartmayer, OFM Conv. will attend.\n\nST.MARIA GORETTI SHRINE PROGRESS: Within the next few months, the shrine of St. Maria will be completed. The art studio is working on the mosaic to be installed on the shrine rear wall. It is of the Netuno countryside. The backdrop of where Maria was martyred. There will be a matching railing and a place to kneel and pray. Prayers for healing, purity, forgiveness will be there. We also have a first-class relic of the saint.\n\nTHE PALLADIO AWARD: If you are into church architecture, you probably know that this is a prestigious award by ‘Traditional Building Magazine’ and coveted by church architects. There were 220 entries this year and 20 Awards given. St. Paul of the Cross Church in Pittsburgh won the award for “Interior Design of a Non-Residential Structure.” Our church came in 1st in that category. Thank you, Jim O’Brien and co-workers for designing and the renovation of our beautiful church, the first in the world dedicated to St. Paul of the Cross.\n\nHOLY HOUR FOR VOCATIONS: We did not much advertise the time of the April Holy Hour for Passionist vocations. It was last Tuesday. Yet, I walked into the church and was happy to see 40 some people. What a beautiful hour we had honoring Jesus. Thank you. The Passionist we prayed to was Bl. Grimoaldo from Pontecorvo, Italy. St. John Paul II beatified him. His niece, Ida, visited us at our Monastery in Jamaica, NY when I was superior. In Rochester, NY, where she lived, is a shrine to the young Passionist Blessed. Ida has since gone to God. The next Vocations’ Holy Hour is Tuesday, May 14th. Thanks for coming.\n\nFR. RICHARD’S KNEE SURGERY: Our dedicated Vicar, Fr. Richard Nalepa had knee replacement surgery this past Wednesday. Everything went well. I waited in the family room with his brother, Ken and sister-in-law, Evelyn. The doctor reported afterwards that everything went perfectly. He will be a few more days in rehab and then come home.\n\nTHE ALTAR GUILD: The Altar Guild keeps the church running! They take care of the sacristy, the sacred wash, the candlesticks, the vestments. They order and care for the flowers, set-up for feast days and liturgical seasons and feasts. They have been in existence for about 5 years now. I want them to know how grateful we are. Thank you: Jane, Phyllis, Suzy, Cindy, Barb, Deb and Tina. With love and gratitude, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P.\n\nDear Friends,\n\nEASTER MASS ATTENDANCE: This is a special thanks to you for attending our Easter Masses. We offered 3 Easter Masses: the Vigil on Saturday evening and the two Easter Sunday Masses. Over 400 attended. We are not a parish and don’t advertise. The music was superb, the church was beautifully decorated, our entire staff and Altar Guild contributed to organizing, assigning, cleaning, decorating. It was an exceptionally beautiful Easter. Also, thanks to all of you who attended. The best attendance in a long time. The collection was also one of the most generous we have had. Thank you.\n\nNEWS ON THE ST. MARIA GORETTI SHRINE: Mr. Jim O’Brien, the architect whose company oversaw the church renovation, called me recently with two great pieces of information. The mosaic for the St. Maria Goretti Shrine is half way finished and is beautiful. I hope, if possible, to bless her shrine some time near her feast day in July. Jim said everything so far is on target and beautiful. He said our church has also won a prestigious award for church renovation. It will be awarded in New Hampshire in June. He asked me to attend the dinner. We’ll see. We have received two other awards for renovation and outside lighting. God certainly takes care of us. This shrine will also have prayers and a kneeler. We can seek Maria’s intercession to be faithful Christ as she was in purity and chastity in forgiveness and integrity.\n\nINTEGRITY: I have always liked that word. I remember in the high school seminary an upper-classman told me his special hobby was ‘etymology.’ I didn’t know what it meant and looked it up. It’s the history of words. How a word comes into a language. A good strong word I always liked is integrity. I remember once saying: “When I die, I hope someone says: ‘He was a man of integrity’.” As I recall, ‘integrity’ came to English from the French and Latin word ‘integer’ which means whole, together, not a lot of loose ends! That will be a beautiful gift to pray for at St. Maria’s shrine. Our society needs to value purity, forgiveness and integrity.\n\nGOOD NEWS FROM THE PASSIONIST NUNS IN CARRICK: Very shortly, a young woman who has spent over a year in discernment living with the community of Passionist Nuns will be vested in the Passionist habit. She will spend a year as a novice in prayer and study discerning whether God is calling her to devote her life to Him. After this year, if she desires to continue, she will pronounce her first vows and the beautiful Passionist Sign will be placed over her heart and she will wear it, being a daughter of St. Paul of the Cross. Three years later if all goes smoothly and she wishes to continue and the community judges her fit, she will take final vows as a Passionist Nun. One of our priests goes to their convent each morning for\n\nMass. I find it a wonderful honor to serve these holy women and help them in their beautiful dedication to Christ as Passionist Contemplative Nuns. It is a very special vocation not given to huge crowds but to those who receive the gift a beautiful prayerful life.\n\nTHANK YOU AGAIN TO ALL – PASSIONISTS, ASSOCIATES, MONASTERY STAFF, ALTAR GUILD, MUSIC MINISTRY, FRIENDS, AND BENEFACTORS FOR MAKING EASTER SO BEAUTIFUL\n\nWith love and gratitude, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P.\n\nDear Friends:\n\nHOLY WEEK IS HERE: This is a pressure time in the church, especially for Pastors. I was one for 20 years. You have all the Rites of receiving people into the Church. The three great days of holiness immediately before Easter. Cleaning the church, decorating for Easter, preparing sermons, confessions, helping other places with confessions, trying to recollect yourself and being in God’s presence. This past Wednesday, we had our prayer morning. The community voted that on all Wednesdays we would spend the first part of the day in prayer. And we have. The front door, open all days from 9 to 5 for confessions and other business, is closed till 1pm. Only on Wednesdays is the first public Mass at 12:10pm. We agreed to spend those early hours each Wednesday in prayer and quiet. We have Divine Office, Community Mass, a short meeting if needed and an hour of Adoration before the Blessed Sacrament before lunch. We open at 1pm. This past Wednesday was particularly beautiful. During that adoration hour, I brought with me two books for prayer. A small book I use on Holy Thursdays at adoration till midnight. The book is “The Hymns and Prayers of St. Thomas Aquinas.” It’s a little book with beautiful words about the Eucharist. The other book was a personal diary hand written by Fr. Augustine Paul Hennessy. He was our Master of Novices, the Passionist priest who trained me and my class how to be Passionists in 1964 – 1965, right here at this monastery, where we first became Passionists. About four years ago, before Fr. Timothy Fitzgerald left for our infirmary, he said: “Justin, I want you to have this book. It’s Fr. Augustine’s diary, beautiful thoughts. I know you were very close to him and he would want you to have it.” It is one of the most precious things I now have. Some years after my novitiate, I was again stationed with Fr. Augustine in Springfield, Mass. Often after a meal, we would walk on the monastery grounds and he would share his beautiful thoughts on God with me. He looked on me as a beloved spiritual son. I had many grateful thoughts as I read from his diary last Wednesday. I’d like to share some beautiful reflections he wrote on training us as Passionists. He wrote: “My aim was to embody in my words and still more, in my life, four goals: to be relaxed with the Providence of God and seldom crippled by fear, to believe in the uniqueness of each one’s vocation in Christ, to expect the inevitability of conflict and the predictability of failure and to insist that maturity is impossible without a total commitment to love.” He told us two qualities were especially needed to accomplish this: mystic insight and maneuverability. I remember this still so clearly. Mystic Insight – see what God is asking and Maneuverability - able to adjust to the moment by moment demands of love. These are what make a happy Passionist. Then he writes: “I was confident that by lecturing to them and sharing my life quite openly with them they would learn, partly by an osmosis, that a Christian career is a career in Christ. A career in Christ is a career on the Cross. A career on the Cross is a career of sacrificial love. This is Good News from Calvary.” May we all strive to love God with the great intensity and tenderness of love that he did. After my parents, he was one of the most important people in my life by God’s Providence. Have a wonderful Holy Week and Listen to His Love.\n\nWith gratitude and prayers, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends,\n\nHOLY WEEK SCHEDULE: The community reviewed last year’s schedule. It will remain pretty much the same. The one change is we will recite Morning Prayer in the church at 9a.m. Thurs., Fri. and Sat. rather than sing the lessons of Tenebrae. Mass of the Last Supper will be on Thursday at 7 p.m. with the washing of feet. Procession follows with adoration till midnight. That is a beautiful time to pray and be present to the Lord. I read some of the prayers and hymns of St. Thomas Aquinas who wrote the Mass prayers and hymns including the Tantum Ergo for this feast. The Dominicans who lived with Thomas said he liked to even sit very close to Jesus when he adored the Eucharist. It is a beautiful evening to spend time close to the Lord. I love that time and do my best to stay till midnight\n\nBIOGRAPHY OF FR.THEODORE FOLEY,CP: I mentioned last week that Fr. Victor Hoagland sent me a copy of the new biography of Fr. Theodore Foley he has written. It has been taken to our General Headquarters in Rome where it will be translated into both Italian and Spanish. It’s a little over 70 type written pages. If pictures etc. are added, it will be a bit larger. It is very well done and a joy to read. I also had two people recently contacting me about cures attributed to his intercession. A cure has to be proven where there is no other explanation and there’s a lot of technicalities. Eventually, one will come through. Fr. Victor has a web site where he has a lot of good Passionist material: Victor’s Place.\n\nMONASTERY COOKS: I have reported to you over the past six years our need for a monastery cook. You heard of our searches, try outs and successes and failures. What I have learned from being a superior for over 40 years and what’s of prime importance: fidelity to prayer and good meals! I want to thank Ann Hedges for the great job she is doing and Gemma Kolcun for the times she has filled in. Things are running smoothly in our kitchen.\n\nGENERAL CHAPTER 2024 NEWS: The General Chapter opens in Rome this October. I was elected a delegate from our province and am greatly honored. The Passionists world-wide are divided into 6 configurations – geographical groups. The priest whom the General appointed to head our configuration is Fr. Rafael Vivanco Peres, C.P., a Mexican Passionist in Rome. When I was Pastor in Raleigh, I had Rafael several times preach Missions for the Spanish speaking at the Raleigh Cathedral. My good friend, Fr. Aurelio Miranda, C.P., whom I have had here in Pittsburgh was elected to represent Brazil. So together with Fr. Jim, our Provincial, I am now feeling what a great experience this should be surrounded by many excellent Passionists. God’s in charge.\n\nPASSIONIST NUNS: The Sisters have much to celebrate. Because on the Solemnity of the Annunciation, a young woman, after having spent many months as a postulant will advance to the novitiate. She begins a full year of prayer and discernment about becoming a vowed Passionist nun. Sr. Mary Megan of St. Joseph will be vested in the Passionist habit and spend the next year in prayer and discernment of God’s will for her life. It is a beautiful and unique vocation. Pray for her.\n\nHOLY HOUR LAST WEEK: The monthly hour of adoration for vocations every month is one of my favorite prayer times. The singing is beautiful. Andrea brings in beautiful cantors and instrumentalists. We adore the Lord exposed in the monstrance. Pray to Mary and Paul of the Cross. I get moved when we carry the Eucharist through the Church. We had about 45 participants last week. Not a great crowd but a beautiful faith filled group and attendance is going up. I so appreciate this time with you and the Lord.\n\nWith gratitude and love, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends,\n\nHOLY HOUR FOR VOCATIONS: This coming Tuesday in our church we have the monthly Holy Hour. We pray that God will bless the Church with vocations to priesthood and religious life. It is a beautiful hour – songs, quiet, Rosary, Benediction and carrying the Blessed Sacrament through the church. Each month, we invite one of our Passionist saints to be with us. Bl. Lorenzo Salvi is chosen for this Tuesday. Last month, we had a higher attendance. Glad to see that.\n\nJOHN CARDELLO: Our dedicated friend, John, is recuperating in a nursing facility. John assists daily by setting up the altar, lighting the candles, often serving as lector at daily Mass. A couple weeks ago, he had a bad fall down a flight of monastery stairs breaking four ribs and clavicle. His son has moved him up to a facility in Grove City close to him. His daughter drove all the way from California. He is getting love and attention! When I told him I would drive up to see him. He said: “Please bring a pair of rosary beads.” Had a wonderful visit. He thanks everyone.\n\nBIOGRAPHY OF FR. THEODORE FOLEY, C.P.: Fr. Victor Hoagland called the other day from our monastery in New York. He said he had just finished writing a longer biography of the Servant of God, Fr. Theodore Foley, who is entombed in our church. I’ve read a good part of it. It will be translated into Italian and Spanish. Including English, it will be printed in three languages in Rome. People are visiting his tomb every day and recording favors granted and petitions requested.\n\nST. MARIA GORETTI SHRINE: Finally, the agreements have been signed. The architect who renovated our church, Jim O’Brien, has helped me finalize the last renovation to our church. Brett Rugo of Rugo Stone was hired to finish St. Maria Goretti’s shrine. It is to be a place of prayer for purity, healing, and forgiveness. Maria Goretti was taught and ministered to by Italian Passionists. They gave her first Communion, heard her first confession and taught her of God. One of our priests, Fr. Jerome, assisted her when dying as she forgave her murderer. The Passionists sponsored her cause for canonization as one of our own. The marble statue of her on the St. Joseph side of our church is an exact replica of the one under the main altar in the church in Corinaldo, Italy where she was baptized. Cardinal Christoph Pierre, Nuncio to the USA, got permission for us to replicate that statue for our shrine. A beautiful mosaic of the Netuno countryside will be the backdrop. The mosaic is being prepared. The shrine will be beautiful and a place to pray for purity, healing and forgiveness.\n\nHOLY WEEK: Despite a reduced number of priests, we will try to keep everything going for Holy Week so that everything will be maintained. We will have a Community Meeting of the Passionists this week and will finalize.\n\nRETREAT HOUSE – LENTEN DAYS OF RECOLLECTION: These days planned by Fr. Curtis and Fr. Michael are being attended and appreciated. Actually, despite the reduction in number of Passionists, everything is being maintained: the masses, confessions, retreats, special programs. I am very thankful for your attendance and the generosity of the members of this community.\n\nPILGRIMAGES: When I was a Pastor in North Carolina in conjunction with other parishes served by Passionists there, we led pilgrimages to Italy: “In the Footsteps of St. Paul of the Cross.” Also, pilgrimages to the Holy Land centered on the Passion of Christ. “Catholic Travel Agency”, located in Anaheim, CA, helped us with everything. I plan on contacting that Director to inquire about Passionist pilgrimages to the shrine of Fr. Theodore Foley in Pittsburgh and the holy places of New York.\n\nIn Christ with gratitude, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends,\n\nDAILY CELEBRATION OF THE EUCHARIST: What an honor it is to go to Mass every day and what a great honor to celebrate Mass each day. There is nothing more important that I can do as a priest. I promised God when I was ordained that I would celebrate Mass every day of my life. Except for 2 days when I was hospitalized, He has helped me keep that promise for over 52 years. There is nothing more important in my life that I do. #43 of the Passionist Rule of Life states: “The Eucharist is central to the life of each community. In so far as possible, we celebrate it together each day as the fundamental action of community life. Our common sharing in the same Body of Christ nourishes the life of our community, constitutes its norm and fosters union among ourselves. For every community, and for each religious, the Eucharist is a divine reality that transforms their lives.” This beautiful directive comes to us from Paul of the Cross and from the Church. What a beautiful gift! Daily Mass – what a gift – to renew what he did on the Cross and then receive Him because He wants to be with me and wants to be with you!\n\nDAYS OF RECOLLECTION: Frs. Curtis and Michael are offering “A Day of Recollection for each Week in Lent.” It is for your spiritual growth and holiness. Each week they are having a different speaker. It’s all for you and your coming closer to the Lord. Check out the schedule – the Tuesdays of Lent – see if you are available and if this is beneficial for your spiritual growth. All are welcome.\n\nPASSIONIST FEAST DAYS: Countries, Religious Organizations, Communities of Priests, Brothers and Nuns etc. have special feast days for their members. It is true of the Passionists. We follow all the Masses of the entire Church and some that are specific for the USA and others specific to Passionists all over the world. Passionist feasts include those in honor of Saints, men and women, who were Passionist priests, brothers and sisters, for example: St. Paul of the Cross, St. Gabriel, St. Gemma etc. There are also special feasts that were set up by St. Paul of the Cross and later Fr. Generals of the Passionists that recall specific devotions to the Passion of Christ, for example: Jesus Crowned with Thorns, Jesus in Gethsemane, Jesus Scourged etc. Fr. Thomas Struzzieri, the first Passionist bishop was influential in establishing these first feast days proper to our community.\n\nHOLY HOUR FOR VOCATIONS – MARCH 12TH: One of my favorite hours of the month is when we adore the Lord in this Eucharistic hour. Nothing else to do but be with Him. We usually get between 25 to 30 people. What matters is that we are adoring the Lord. Last week it was over 40 people. Andrea and the Cantor provided beautiful music. I look forward to it and\n\nfind it very prayerful. I thank Andrea for providing a beautiful musical setting.\n\nPOPE FRANCIS’ MARCH PRAYER INTENTION: At this time of year, we celebrate beautiful feast days of great martyrs of our faith. Last week, I mentioned that I have always admired St. Polycarp, an early martyr, anxious to shed his blood for Christ. Sts. Perpetua and Felicity will be celebrated in March, greatly loved and admired women martyrs of the early Church. The Acts of their Martyrdom was read at the Eucharist. Another is St. Justin, who had the honor of shedding his blood for Christ. These heroes and heroines of the 2nd century followed the Apostles. Martyrdom was a great honor granted them. This year Pope Francis’ March Intention for the Apostleship of Prayer is: “for the martyrs of our day, witnesses to Christ.” “Pray that those who risk their lives for the Gospel imbue the Church with courage and missionary drive. And are open to the grace of martyrdom.” Great Love!\n\nWith appreciation,\n\nFr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends:\n\nST. POLYCARP: In my office, I have a file cabinet where I keep talks and sermons I’ve written. Some I like. Some I throw out when I read them a second time. I also have a section on the saints, mostly short stories about each of the saints. I love St. Paul of the Cross and St. Therese of Lisieux and I have lots of stories about them. For Feb. 23rd, the feast of St. Polycarp, I went to my notes. I have always admired everything about him except his name. He’s one of the early Bishop Martyrs, put to death for the faith in the year 155 at the age of 86. He was a disciple of St. John the Apostle! Polycarp related how John would tell the people about Jesus. John would sit when he preached at the Eucharist. John would tell them all about Jesus even how he looked. Polycarp served very long as Bishop of Smyrna in Turkey. When St. Ignatius of Antioch had been arrested and was being brought across the sea to Rome for martyrdom in 107, the young Bishop Polycarp walked down to where the boat was being re-supplied and knelt in the sand and kissed the chains around the hands and feet of Ignatius. 48 years later, Polycarp, himself, after having been arrested for being a Christian and being asked to deny Christ responded: “For 86 years, I have served Him. He never did me any wrong. How can I blaspheme my King, who saved me?” He was condemned to death. The fire was lit and he was burnt to death and could be heard praying: “Lord, Jesus Christ, I bless you for judging me worthy to share the cup of Christ.” The account of his martyrdom was written by Marcianus, who signed it this way: “I, Marcianus, knew him, saw him in flames, touched his remains with my own hand.” The account was read at Masses to inspire the early Christians!\n\nLENTEN DAYS OF RECOLLECTION: For each week in Lent, Fr. Curtis has invited a speaker for a day of recollection at the retreat house. He has asked me to speak at the first one this Tuesday. It’s in God’s hands!\n\nVISIT OF OUR FR. PROVINCIAL: As I write this bulletin message Fr. Provincial, Jim O’Shea, has arrived for a visit and to check up on how things are going in Pittsburgh. He is working very hard at a plan to hopefully insure the continuance of our Retreat House Ministries especially in light of the decreasing number of Passionists. Pray God blesses our Province with new members.\n\nSTATIONS OF THE CROSS: We are having the Stations of the Cross each Friday in Lent at 7:00pm.\n\nThis past Tuesday, we also had the Holy Hour for Vocations. We had close to 40 people show. It made me very happy because everybody so reverently prayed and sang beautifully. I sincerely find it one of the best hours of the month.\n\nST.MARIA GORETTI SHRINE: I have approved the contracts to finish the work on the St. Maria Goretti Shrine. It is already beautiful and a place to pray for strength and healing and peace. Maria Goretti, Martyr for Purity, will help all of us to be pure and chaste in all the situations of our lives. The shrine will have a beautiful mosaic background based on her area in Netuno. There will be prayers and a place to kneel and pray for purity and strength, a place of forgiveness and peace.\n\nOUR MONASTERY MINISTRIES: The number of Passionists in this community since 2018 has gone from 17 to 6. I want to thank my fellow Passionists for all the extra work they are now doing. Two are serving full time in the Retreat House. The R.H. is doing well with programs and attendance. The other 4 of us cover much and at advanced ages. Thank you, Men, for Daily Masses in the Church, Daily Mass for the cloistered Nuns, 3 Sunday Masses, 4 novena services on Mondays followed by confessions, daily confessions at the front door from 9am to 5pm, Confession in the church on Saturdays, being present each day for our community prayer together and also for Eucharistic Adoration on Wednesdays. I am so very grateful to you, our staff and the wonderful people here.\n\nWith deep appreciation, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends:\n\nSTATIONS OF THE CROSS: For the Fridays of Lent, we will pray the Stations of the Cross. I am honored to lead them on all the days I am available. It is a beautiful practice dating back to the early Church . Pilgrims would go to the Holy Land and walk to the places where Jesus walked in Jerusalem carrying His Cross to the Hill of Calvary. They remembered His love. We do the same but in Pittsburgh.\n\nHOLY HOUR FOR VOCATIONS THIS WEEK: One of my favorite monthly events! All of us praying and being quiet in the presence of the Lord. God hears our prayers and the desires of our hearts. I thank the faithful group that comes every month along with Andrea and the beautiful singer.\n\nQUIET PRAYER: St. Paul of the Cross wanted our communities to be houses of prayer. I appreciate that so much being here in Pittsburgh. There are only six professed Passionists now. However, we met and determined we will keep our prayer life going and so continue striving to be faithful to prayer. We celebrate a number of Masses every day. However, on Wednesday mornings we close down the front door till 1pm. On those mornings, we have our prayers together and a Mass just for the Passionists with an hour of adoration before the Blessed Sacrament before lunch. We open the front door at one and resume all our normal services. It’s great that the community wanted to create this quiet prayer time.\n\nST. GABRIEL OF OUR LADY OF SORROWS,C.P.: Declared a Saint by Pope Benedict XV in 1920, St. Gabriel is patron of youth, students, seminarians, clerics and the Abruzzi region in Italy. His feast day is Feb. 27th. Saint Gabriel was born in 1838. He came from a large wealthy family in Spoleto, Italy. His father was a lawyer and served as mayor. He grew up in a household where devotion to Our Lady of Sorrows was typical of family life. He was a normal teenager: he danced, hunted, had many friends but felt something was lacking. He turned to Jesus and Mary and received a calling to become a Passionist. Despite objections from his father, Gabriel entered our community after high school. His father never spoke to him again. Gabriel loved God with all his heart and became a saint. One day, his Director, Fr. Norbert, saw him pacing around his room very agitated. “What’s the matter, Gabriel?” “Father is there anything in my heart, I have not given to God? Tell me what it is so I can rip it out and belong to Him completely.” Saint Gabriel is remarkable because he went so quickly from a life devoted to the pleasures of this world, to becoming centered on the Passion of Christ. He grew daily in love with Christ and Mary, Mother of Sorrows. This kind and holy student died from tuberculosis at the age of 23 in 1862. Pope Francis, when speaking on his feast day, said that Gabriel is one “whose example helps young people to be enthusiastic disciples of Jesus and inspires sick people to offer your suffering in union with those of Christ.” His shrine at the Passionist Monastery near the snow-capped Gran Sasso Mountains is one of the most visited shrines in all of Europe. Our Pittsburgh Monastery has always been a place of great devotion to him. For over a hundred years, Pittsburghers have been coming here praying to him. He was to be canonized in 1913. Our Gabriel Chapel was added on to the church to be ready for that canonization. Because of World War I, his canonization was delayed. When it happened in 1920, our chapel had already been built! Today his main shrine is in Abruzzi, Italy .\n\nWHAT THE PASSION MEANS TO ME: Fr. Curtis, Director of our Retreat House has asked me to speak at the Retreat House Day of Recollection on Feb. 27th. He gave me the topic: ‘What the Passion means to me.’ I have begun thinking about what to say. What it means to be a Passionist and to wear the Sign over my heart. Paul of the Cross said: “The Passion contains everything. Wisdom comes from the wounds of Christ.” I am praying over this and want to connect it to the Mass. We learned as children: “The Mass is the unbloody sacrifice of Christ offered on our altars.” It’s all connected and it all about God loves us.\n\nGratefully in Christ, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P.\n\nDear Friends,\n\nLENT AND ASHES AND GIVING UP THINGS: Lent is here. Ashes will be given out at all Masses Wednesday. Please see the schedule. Stations of the Cross at 7pm on Fridays. Please do extra things for Our Lord….prayer, kindness, reaching out to someone, avoiding things that displease Him and sacrifices -all things that show our love for Jesus. Daily Mass is one of the best things we can do…renewing what Jesus did on Calvary, offering Him to the Father and then He comes to us.\n\nLet me share with you a true Lent story. It’s 1954, Jersey City, sitting in the kitchen before supper, my whole family is there: Mom and Dad, I’m 8 yr. old, Bill, a 4th grader and my 3 younger brothers are there; Bob 6, Jack 5 and Fred 2 (probably in a high chair). My mother said that before we have supper that we should share what we were going to do special for Our Lord for Lent. She went first and said she was going to daily Mass every day. Next, Dad said he would give up sweets, Bob and Jack followed saying they would sacrifice candy. My turn came and I said I will also go to Mass every day. I think my mother said that it meant Saturdays, too. I never have stopped. By the 6th grade when I met a Passionist for the first time, I told Fr. Michael Anthony Campbell that I went to daily Mass and wanted to be a priest. He told me he was expelled from China after spending nearly 5 years in solitary confinement for the faith and was so happy to say Mass again. He told me how much he loved God. That’s how I became a priest. When we do something for the Lord, He does much more for us. Give Him the best.\n\nPRAISE NATION: This is a charismatic type of prayer group which attracts people ,young and old, to the Catholic Church. Bishop Zubik speaks highly of its good work. Fr. Levi, a diocesan priest, along with Joe Jacobs, a dedicated layman, give a lot of leadership and spiritual direction to the entire group. Fr. Curtis has been on the front line in working with them. He has arranged some usage of the retreat house. I was asked if the monastery church and parking lots could be used at times for prayer meetings and services when free. I gladly agreed. The first program of Praise Nation is this Saturday night, Feb. 10 at 7pm. I was asked to preach so I will experience the faith and prayer. I am delighted the Passionists can help. More delighted that young people are responding, am grateful to Fr. Curtis for his apostolic creativity. All people are welcome at these prayer meetings.\n\nPASSIONIST NUNS – GOOD NEWS: As I write this bulletin, I just got back from Mass at our Nuns. Mother Joyce told me the young woman living with them will be vested in the habit and begin preparation to be a Passionist . We wish Sr. Mary Meaghan well and assure her of our prayers.\n\nST. MARIA GORETTI SHRINE: I talked with Jim O’Brien on Friday. They are researching backgrounds for the mosaic that will be on the rear wall of the shrine. She was martyred in Netuno. It will be a place where we can pray for fidelity to Christ and forgiveness.\n\nSTATIONS OF THE CROSS: A very popular Lenten devotion is the Stations of the Cross. On all the Fridays of Lent, we will have the Stations in our church at 7pm. All are welcome.\n\nHOLY HOUR FOR VOCATIONS: There will be the monthly Holy Hour for Vocations on Tuesday, Feb. 20th There is beautiful music, quiet, rosary and benediction. This month we will ask St. Vincent Strambi to be with us. This early companion of St. Paul of the Cross wrote the first biography of the Founder. St. Paul. Vincent became the second Passionist bishop. He said: “God raised up Paul of the Cross in the Church that we might learn to love God from our hearts With much gratitude, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends,\n\nCOMPLETION OF ST. MARIA GORETTTI SHRINE: I am nearly half way through my 2nd term as Rector here in Pittsburgh. It was our custom for the outgoing superior to move away upon completion of his 2nd term. It was a good custom. Maybe because of the shortage of personnel, the custom has not been always followed in recent years. With an aging community, people are less maneuverable. One thing I had wanted to accomplish here was the renovation of our church. That has been accomplished beautifully through your generosity and the exceptional goodness of Jack Mascaro. However, the beautiful St. Maria Goretti shrine needs completion. I spoke with our primary architect, Mr. Jim O’Brien, a number of times in these past weeks. Plans are now underway, sketches shared, decisions made for the completion of the shrine. Perhaps a mosaic on the back wall, a kneeler, prayers available for purity, chastity, forgiveness, healing and strength. St. Maria Goretti, a saint from a Passionist parish and a patron of our community, is a model of purity in a culture that seems to no longer cherish or strive for this virtue. I hope this shrine will inspire us to strive to be pure and chaste and to please God in all our lives.\n\nFEB. 2ND ST. BLASÉ – BLESSING OF THROATS: Next Saturday, Nov. 3rd is the feast day of St. Blasé, Bishop and Martyr. We will have the Blessing of Throats after the 8:00a.m. Mass.\n\n“DO THE TRUTH IN LOVE”: As a seminarian, my class had a special honor. As high school seminarians for three years we had as rector of the Seminary in Dunkirk, NY., Fr. Augustine Paul Hennessy, C.P. Then when we came to the Novitiate here in Pittsburgh in 1964-65, Fr. Augustine had moved here and was our Master of Novices who taught us spirituality and how to be a Passionist. He was one of the finest Passionists I have ever met. He had a doctorate in Theology, was elected head of the Theological Society of America, was called to Europe to debate theologians at the time of the Vatican Council but above all he was one of the most loving and saintly Passionists I have known. He always told us: “Do the truth in love.” I have thought of that so many times as a Passionist, as a priest, as a Superior. The other night I was listening to the political debates I just wanted to say: “Do the truth in love.” It applies to so much. Before Fr. Timothy Fitzgerald left here for the infirmary where he died not long after in Nov. 2021, he gave me a book. He said: “Justin, you were very close to Fr. Augustine, I want you to have this.” It was a hand written book of some 200 pages entitled: “By the Gift of his Grace – Reflections on a Happy Life” by Augustine Paul Hennessy, C.P. I have it next to my bed and I read it many a night. Beautiful! Beautiful reflections. To me it is all about living in God’s presence and ‘doing the truth in love.’ Our country needs that so much. As a young priest, I was stationed in W. Springfield, Mass. Fr. Augustine was Rector there for a couple years. We would walk many a day after lunch and talk about the things of God. One day he said to me: “Justin, when I die I want you to preach for me.” I was dumbfounded and so very grateful. He died when I was In North Carolina. Someone else preached. That was alright. All I want is “To do the truth in love.” It is a beautiful way to live.\n\nWith love and gratitude, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends,\n\nTHE CHURCH WAS BEAUTIFUL: The church was beautiful for Christmas. The flowers, lights, manger scene and Christmas decorations were as beautiful as I have seen them. The ladies of the Altar Guild headed by Jane Connor do a fantastic job. They decorated and had the church spotless. Rusty and John did much of the heavy work. I want to thank all of them. Many nice things happened over Christmas, especially the music selected and arranged by Andrea Terlesky. Thanks, too, to the musicians that accompanied her and made the Masses beautiful. I am grateful for the tremendous generosity of so many of you that allowed us to help the 50 or so families who come to the monastery food bank for assistance every Friday. We were able to generously provide food gift cards for Christmas dinners. Thank you for your tremendous generosity shown the Passionist Community that enables us to keep things going here in Pittsburgh.\n\nTHE RETREAT HOUSE IS DOING SO WELL: Transitions are difficult. Happily, the Retreat Center is moving along under the direction of Fr. Curtis Kiddy and Fr. Michael Greene. They are starting new programs and building up the loyal retreat movement that Fr. Gerald preserved and served for sixteen years. This is the first retreat movement in the entire U.S.A. We are here 104 years! Fr. Curtis brings years of experience as a Pastor to this assignment. It continues to be a beautiful prayerful place to encounter Jesus.\n\nOUR APOSTOLATE AS CONFESSORS FLOURISHES: One of the beautiful apostolates that the Passionist Community of Pittsburgh has been known for is providing access to the sacrament of Penance for the clergy of Pittsburgh and for the laity. Besides all the confessions heard in the church on Saturdays and after novena services on Mondays, a Passionist priest is available every day except Sunday at the Monastery Office. This is arranged so clergy and lay people have access to the sacrament of Penance six days a week with anonymity observed. I have pledged as long as I am Rector to continue providing this service which has been offered for over 160 years. St. Paul of the Cross said our houses were to truly be a “Refugium Peccatorum,” a refuge for sinners. We offer confessions nearly every day and all day. Right before Christmas, one of the Bishops of Pittsburgh stopped by and asked to see the Rector. He said: “Fr. Justin, I have made this trip to your monastery to especially thank your community for providing such access to the sacrament of penance. The clergy are very appreciative. At a time when so many things are being cut back, we are so grateful to the Passionists for providing this sacrament. The esteem we have for your community continually increases.” Actually, it is an\n\nhonor to honor our Founders’ wishes!\n\nAN ELECTION THAT MADE ME HAPPY: Every 6 years, the Provincial superiors of the 25 or so Passionist provinces (groupings) along with Fr. General and his council are called to Rome to review the life and ministry of the Passionists and to elect a new Fr. General. They all meet with the Pope and promise fidelity. Each province also elects one of their members as a voting member at this meeting. Last week, the votes were counted for the delegate who will represent our province (Eastern U.S.A. and the Caribbean). I was elected as the delegate. I was absolutely surprised and was also quite happy. Pray that I represent our men well in October and am faithful to our Father, St. Paul of the Cross.\n\nHOLY HOUR FOR VOCATIONS: Our monthly Holy Hour for Vocations, the first for 2024 in slated for this Tuesday at 7pm. We have Benediction, Rosary, singing and beautiful silence to adore the Lord in the Eucharist. There’s nothing else to do but to be with Jesus in the Eucharist. We look at Him and He looks at us. We give Him our hearts and He gives us his love. Please join us!\n\nHOMILY CHRISTMAS 2023\n\nI simply want to say that Christmas means God loves us very much. So much so, that He came to us as an Infant and became one of us so He could die for us on a Cross.\n\nThe Founder of the Passionists, St. Paul of the Cross, besides founding a religious order spent his entire apostolic life preaching missions and retreats throughout Italy. He constantly reminded people of the love of the Crucified Christ. Whenever he would open a mission in whatever locality, he would carry in a large Crucifix and set it before the people. He would then tell them: “Listen to His love.” The Crucifix spoke louder than any words of Paul. The Crucifix is the proof God loves us. When we gaze upon the Cross, we listen to His love. And that love proves itself in wounds and nails, pierced flesh and a head crowned with thorns.\n\nMy friends, what do we hear Him say, when his arms are stretched out reaching out to you and me? Things you and I need to hear and know. We hear Him say, you are important to Me. I love you and you don’t have to prove yourself to me or earn my love. I love you always. When you fail, when you wander, when you forget me……I never wander or forget you. I am more anxious to forgive you, than you are to be forgiven. I want your love. I was born an Infant in Bethlehem so I could give myself in love for you. The arms that reach out from the wood of the manger are the same arms that reach out from the wood of a Cross.\n\nThere is a little story that I love very much and have told it on many Christmases. It is a true story that took place during the Second World War. It occurred in a prison camp built by the Japanese in the Philippines. The Filipino prisoners asked if they could have a prayer room in the prison. One of the Filipinos carved a wooden crucifix. A certain Japanese guard would watch the prisoners meditate before Jesus on the Cross. When Christmas came, several prisoners carved a manger scene and placed it in the room. The guard watched as the Filipinos prayed with equal fervor before the Infant in the manger.\n\nOne day the guard pointed to the Infant in the manger and then to Jesus on the Cross and simply asked: “The same one?” The answer was given him: “The same one.”\n\nThen looking at the crib and then at the Cross, he softly said: “I’m sorry.”\n\nWhat a beautiful story. The crib is about love and the Cross is about how great that love is. The arms of the Babe reach out from the manger. The arms of Christ Crucified reach out from the Cross - the same one, the same one.\n\nThis Christmas we celebrate His coming to earth. I am sorry he had to suffer. Yet I am so very happy, He loved us that much – the same Christ at Bethlehem and the same Christ on Calvary.\n\nHere is a final story from the life of St. Paul of the Cross. I love it very much. I first heart it from my Master of Novices when I was here in Pittsburgh as a novice in 1964. It is about a simple beautiful gesture from when St. Paul was an old man in his eighties on his death bed. The Infirmarian, Bro. Bartholomew Calderoni, noticed that he was holding a Crucifix in his hands. Quite oddly for a man in pain, the image of the Lord was turned away from him, facing upwards toward the ceiling. Thinking he would be doing the old man a favor, the Brother gently turned the crucifix around in Paul’s hands so he could look on the suffering Christ.\n\nA few minutes later, the Brother re-entered the room, and again the image of Christ Crucified was turned away from Paul’s gaze and turned toward the ceiling. Again, Brother Batholomew tried to turn it around in the dying man’s hands. But Paul shook his head in protest and whispered: “Let Him face heaven so that He may say a good word on my behalf to His heavenly Father.”\n\nAs we listen to the love of the Infant Jesus this Christmas, know how much he loves you. Listen to that love as you gaze on the Babe in swaddling clothes. See the same one, the same one who hangs upon the Cross, loving us thoroughly and speaking a good word on our behalf to his heavenly Father. May the best gift you receive this Christmas come as you listen to His love!\n\nDear Friends,\n\nChristine, who serves in so many capacities here, told me that a short Christmas message was needed for the bulletin. Last year, I spoke of how Paul of the Cross loved the image of the Infant Jesus resting on the wood of the Cross. Paul had such a painting in his room. It reminded him of Christ’s love, so strong, from birth to death for us on a Cross. He came to earth to stretch out His arms on the Cross and give Himself for us. Look at those outstretched arms and see how much God loves you. One of the greatest blessings I have had was Fr. Augustine Paul Hennessy, C.P., as Rector of the Seminary when I was in high school. Later, he was my Master of Novices here in Pittsburgh. I learned how to be a Passionist from him. He often quoted Pope St. Pius XII’s great encyclical “Mystici Corporis,” the mystical Body of Christ. One line I remember by heart: “In the crib, on the Cross, in the unending glory of the Father, Christ has all the members of His body united to Him in a way more loving than a mother has for the child in her arms or that with which a person loves himself.” Wow! Jeus died on the Cross for me with a love more tender than a mother for her child or a man for himself. We celebrate this at Christmas. It is overwhelming! A few years back when I was Pastor in Raleigh, I was sitting in the old cathedral and helping with the Christmas confessions. The confessionals were taken so I heard in the body of the church. Somehow, the angle where I sat, was one whereby the large Crucifix with Jesus’ outstretched arms was directly behind the stable with the outstretched arms of the Infant. From the wood of the manger to the wood of the Cross, Jesus reaches out to tell us, “I love you this much. This is how much I love you. I want your heart more than anything else this Christmas.”\n\nIn Christ, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends,\n\nCONGRATULATIONS TO THE RETREAT HOUSE MUSIC MINISTRY: Last Tuesday evening I had a beautiful experience in our Retreat House Chapel. I attended a 2 hour musical performance put on by the Retreat Center Music Ministry directed by Joe Schubert with Nick Capone, organist. I attended primarily to show my support for Fr. Curtis Kiddy as he has assumed Retreat House leadership. Honestly, I went as duty but two hours later was hoping it wouldn’t end! Never did I expect to enjoy it as I did. Superb! The singers and musicians were magnificent. The time flew by and was I happy to have experienced this prayerful singing and raising of the mind and heart to God. Isn’t that what we learned as children to be the definition of prayer?\n\nTHANKS TO OUR PASSIONIST ASSOCIATES: Our C.P. Associates treat us as family. Do you know why? Because we are family. They are lay people who have studied our Passionist spirit and charism. They have associated themselves with us in ministry. They love St. Paul of the Cross and all that Paul is for the church. This Sunday after the last Mass, they are going to decorate our refectory (dining room) and then have a special dinner with the Passionist Community to celebrate the Christmas season. We are so grateful to them for all they do and all the help they give us in trying to maintain our Passionist charism and ideals. Paul Ruhl is the new chairman of the Associates and he is doing great. We will have a nice celebration and it’s all rooted in the charism of St.Paul of the Cross to which we have all committed ourselves.\n\n2ND COLLECTION THIS WEEKEND: It will go to purchasing substantial gift certificates for the 40 families that come each Friday for assistance. I thank you for your generosity at Thanksgiving. I thank also your understanding of these changes as we are trying to maintain our primary works within an atmosphere of prayer and quiet.\n\nCONFESSION MINISTRY CONTINUES: This is especially important for our front door ministry which includes us being available Monday through Saturday for the sacrament of Penance. Holy things happen each day at our front door. It is not a parish office or a place to catch up on what’s going on. St. Paul of the Cross asked that our houses offer confession freely and be a “Refuge for Sinners.” As an old man, they would carry him down from his sick room in a specially made chair to the sacristy to hear confessions! Our front door is a holy place!\n\nOUR MUSIC MINISTRY: Andrea Terlesky is the church Music Minister and does a wonderful job at the organ and piano. Especially are we graced with wonderful cantors and instrumentalists. I publicly want to thank her for the beauty of our liturgies and for the special beauty we have at the Holy Hours for Vocations. Come see and hear for yourself!\n\nHOLY HOUR FOR VOCATIONS - THIS TUESDAY 7:00pm - COME JOIN US !\n\nWith my deepest gratitude for all your kindness and support\n\nFr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends:\n\nWORKSHOP ON THE CALENDAR: Fr. Victor Hoagland, Passionist priest at our monastery in New York, put together a very nice 2024 Passionist calendar. I’ve been explaining it to you over the past weeks. We had a session on it after Mass this Saturday. Less than 20 calendars remain. Sold several hundred.\n\nADVENT IS UPON US: First Sunday of Advent already! I entered the Passionist High School Seminary in 1958. That first year we were not allowed to go home for Christmas. The next year they relaxed those strict rules. It was wonderful to be with our families again for Christmas. I saw my parents, brothers and relatives. I made a special trip up to the Passionist Monastery in N.J. to let my Vocation Director, Fr. Bennet Kelley, C.P., know how happy I was. I saw his secretary, Mrs. Viola Cannata, who handled mailings for the Vocation Club. She said: “Billy, I want to give you a book. Keep it.” I did and still have it, “The Reed of God” by Caryll Houselander. I pull it out every Advent. The author was a mystic and has some of the most beautiful insights into Advent I have ever read. I’ve preached using her thoughts. I’ve prayed using her words. I’ve read them practically every Advent since Viola gave me that book. I pulled them out again Advent 2023, over 60 years later. Listen prayerfully - “Advent is the season of the seed…the seed of the world’s life was hidden in Our Lady. For Nine months Christ grew in his mother’s body. By His own will she formed Him from herself, from the simplicity of her daily life. She had nothing to give Him but herself. He asked for nothing else. She gave Him herself….Working, eating, sleeping, she was forming His body from hers. His flesh and blood, from her humanity… she gave Him His humanity. Walking the streets of Nazareth to do her shopping, to visit her friends. Every beat of her heart gave Him His heart to love with, His heart to be broken by love.” I still love that book and it calls us all to be mystics in love with Jesus. Mary shows us how.\n\n2ND COLLECTION FOR OUR FOOD LINE- CHRISTMAS GIFTS: We have put aside the Thanksgiving Collection and other gifts that have come in. We will also have a 2nd collection next Sunday which will be added on. Peg Donley, who directs our Friday Food Line, will be given these funds so that all the families who regularly come to our Friday Food Line will receive gift certificates for a good Christmas dinner. Thank you for helping with this.\n\nVOCATION HOLY HOUR: The monthly Holy Hour will be Tuesday, Dec. 12th. Come pray with us. We adore Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. Say the rosary. Have beautiful music and beautiful silence in the presence of the Lord. We ask God to bless the Passionists throughout the world with new members.\n\nLAIUDATO SI GROUP MEETS: We meet on certain Tuesdays at 6:30pm. It’s a great group. Roseann Lord heads it up. We pray and reflect and develop various projects to show our appreciation for God’s gift of our earth. We have begun re-reading Pope Francis encyclical “Laudato si. I am grateful to all these people for the wonderful work they have done for our property and retreat house.\n\nWith much gratitude and prayers, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends,\n\nA BEAUTIFUL THANKSGIVING: We had a beautiful Thanksgiving Mass. The music and singing was superb. Andrea Terleski, our Music Minister, has a way of finding these wonderful instrumentalists and cantors who join us. It was beautiful. I thank our regular faithful cantors and all the extras and instrumentalists who join us for these special celebrations. Thanksgiving\n\nwas beautiful.\n\nAN UNPOPULAR DECISION: I want to thank you for understanding why we are not able to continue doing the “Giving Tree” project. Last weekend, I announced that we would not have the Giving Tree this Christmas. We will give the 40 to 45 families who come weekly for assistance gift cards to Giant Eagle for Christmas Dinner. Peg Donley, who heads our Food for the Poor Line, said food is so expensive. We cannot give out Gift Cards like we did other years. I suggested we take up collections in church. Then the monastery will make up the difference. A collection was taken on Thanksgiving. Another will be taken up in Advent. This will replace the\n\nGiving Tree Project. I made that decision to help the poor and to protect our Passionist life. We are not a parish and don’t want to be. Our front door is open for Mass cards and people coming for help mostly sacramental, the Sacrament of Confession. Six days of the week, we are available. The Giving Tree interferes with that Apostolate, a primary ministry in Pittsburgh. We only have 5 religious. We cannot have people dropping off presents all the days before Christmas. Tying up the front door with noisy chatter as if we were a parish office. Also, there is the difficulty in finding adequate and reachable space to store things while maintaining our privacy and quiet. Rusty is called on to do much of the work. He is now maintenance man, not\n\nonly for the monastery, but also for the retreat house. Bro. Matt who delivered and organized things died. We are a small aging community. I have made this decision, as Rector, that this is not compatible with our life here or the atmosphere we want at the front door. I do this for the good of the Passionist Community.\n\nDECEMBER HOLY HOUR FOR VOCATIONS: One of the nicest hours of the month is the Holy Hour of Adoration for Passionist Vocations. This month - December 12 th , Tuesday, at 7p.m. We pray quietly and have the rosary and benediction. I invite everyone to come December 12 th at 7pm. We invite a Passionist Saint or Blessed to accompany us. This month it will be Bl.\n\nBernard who celebrated mass in the church!\n\nPASSIONIST CALENDAR WORKSHOP: Following Mass, the 8am Mass next Saturday, December 2, I will have a brief explanation of the Passionist Calendar and the liturgical year. We have been selling them at the office. The calendar has all the Passionist feasts listed, the American feasts and those of the universal church and the readings for each day of the year. All\n\nare welcome – 8:30am next Saturday.\n\nDECEMBER PASSIONIST FEASTS: There is one feast day of a Passionist in December on the 9 th , the feast day of Bl. Bernard Silvestrelli. He served as Superior General of the Passionist for 25 years and had a reputation for holiness. Born into a wealthy Roman family, their palatial home was at Piazza Minerva not far from the Passionist Generalate. Born in 1831, ordained a priest in 1855, he became a Passionist in 1857. Made his novitiate with Francesco Possenti, St. Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows! When Superior general, he used his inheritance to further the growth of the Passionist Congregation all over the world and here in the United States. He visited Pittsburgh encouraging the community here. During his leadership, the congregation experienced great growth in numbers, houses and activities. As Fr. General, he arrived in New York in the spring of 1896. There is a picture of him sitting at the front of this monastery with all the community around him. I’m inviting him back for our Holy Hour!\n\nWith much gratitude and appreciation, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends:\n\nTHANKSGIVING DAY MASS: At 9:30 on Thursday Morning, we will celebrate a Mass of Thanksgiving. What a beautiful way to celebrate the day - giving thanks to God for his blessings on us and our country. There’s much to be done in getting ready with the turkey and trimmings. However, remember the reason for it all, to give thanks to God for so many gifts received. Receiving the Giver of the Gifts into our hearts makes for a perfect day.\n\nHOLY HOUR THIS PAST WEEK: I had forgotten to put an announcement in the bulletin for the Holy Hour last Tuesday. I wondered if any one would remember, was hoping someone would come. I was so happy to see the 34 people who came out. That hour is refreshing – just to be with Our Lord in the Eucharist. The music was some of the best I have heard in my six years here. It was exceptionally prayerful. We knew the presence of the Lord.\n\nFEAST OF THE PRESENTATION OF MARY- NOV. 21: St. Paul of the Cross had great devotion to this particular feast. He received the habit on this day. He named the first monastery, for Mary’s Presentation. The early Passionists tell us he celebrated this feast as if it were Christmas. He traveled up to Monte Argentario to celebrate with a novena. It is believed he received special mystical graces on this feast. We celebrate it this Tuesday.\n\nPRAYING WITH FR. THEODORE: At Fr. Theodore’s tomb in our church are two books where you can inscribe favors requested or favors received. The books are written in every day. I read them and am deeply touched by the faith, goodness and beauty of the petitions and the many favors granted. People also call in to have their prayers and favors added. I have seen miraculous things. Our church is blessed by his presence. In the 1950’s, Fr. Theodore used the confessional on the right as you enter the church. The sign ‘Fr. Rector’ was his. It’s still there.\n\nST. MARIA GORETTI SHRINE: Moving toward completion - the architect, Mr. Jim O’Brien from Virginia, helped me this past week. He has designed the back wall. Inscribed there will be prayers for purity and forgiveness and chastity. Maria’s life is beautiful and speaks much to our whole society which struggles so much to be chaste. Maria’s pure life and heroic forgiveness of her attacker, Alesandro, touches all of us.\n\nGIVING TREE / FOOD BANK: I was asked if we would have the Giving Tree this year. I talked to different people and I made a decision. We will substitute by helping our Food Bank Ministry. From the first days of this monastery, we have helped the poor and needy with food. Going back to the 1700’s, Paul of the Cross, himself, urged the brothers to set aside food for the needy and poor. The custom continued when the early Passionists came to Pittsburgh in 1852. For the past 171 years, we have cared for the poor by feeding the hungry. Every Friday morning, a group of volunteers come in and operate our food bank giving substantial food to 35 - 45 local families. It runs all year long. At Christmas, we try to provide a gift certificate so that these families can have a good Christmas dinner. As you know, food is very expensive nowadays. Peg Donley has been running the food bank for us with a number of volunteers for the past years. Her recently deceased husband, Tom, took great care of the poor as if he were serving Christ, Himself. Because we are down to 5 Passionists here, because Rusty is now also in charge of maintenance in the retreat house, because our front door is very busy with confessions before Christmas, we are not able to give the assistance, space and time to what the ‘Giving Tree’ needs. This was a hard decision, not popular. However, I think this is best for our Passionist Community. We will feed the hungry by special collections to help the poor with providing gift cards for their Christmas dinners.\n\nPASSIONIST ASSOCIATES: They number about 30 here in Pittsburgh and are among the most loyal people to our community. They chose a new leader, Paul Ruhl. I am in contact with him and offering to help in any way he asks. Bernie Jordan and Jan Marco led the group for years. They were excellent. He is now the leader. I have assured him of any help or assistance that is needed from the professed Passionists.\n\nGrateful for all your help and kindness, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends:\n\nMONASTERY ALTAR GUILD: When the renovation of the church was completed, I assembled an Altar Guild to keep the church and sacristy spotless and to care for the vestments and altar linens. Jane Conner heads a group of about 8 women who have for these past few years kept the church fresh with flowers ordered, linens washed and ironed, statues dusted, sacristy in order and spotless. John O’Neill has for over a quarter of a century done all the heavy cleaning of floors and pews during the summer and through the winter ice and snow. These ladies have formed a wonderfully working group. On certain Saturdays, they have had a communion breakfast in our refectory after the morning Mass. I have given them a talk which is more a teaching on some aspect of the faith. One time it was the theology of the Eucharistic Prayers, another a workshop on Scripture. This Saturday, I will explain the Church Calendar. I am so grateful to John and Rusty Wilcox and our Altar Guild for our beautiful clean church.\n\nBLESSED PIO CAMPIDELLI: We celebrated Mass in his honor on his feast day Nov. 3rd. He is one of our young Passionist Blesseds. From central Italy, Pio is greatly honored in that area. He was a copy of St. Gabriel and died Nov. 2, 1889 before his ordination to the priesthood. A miraculous healing of a child was attributed to his intercession and St. John Paul declared him Blessed in 1985. One of our priests in Rome told me that there are other claims of miraculous healings attributed to him. We might see his canonization before long. Pope John Paul once said to us: “I have given you, Passionists, so many saints and blesseds. You should all become holy!”\n\nST. MARIA GORETTI SHRINE: This is the one area in our beautifully renovated church that has not been completed. I contacted the architect, Jim O’Brien. He has designed an area on the rear wall to display prayers for purity, healing and forgiveness behind the beautiful statue of Maria. She has her hand raised fending off her attacker. I have asked our artists, Bob and Dave, who beautified St. Gabriel’s shrine, to help me complete this area. I’d like their help to design the prayer cards with that symbol of Maria’s hand reaching out and God’s hand reaching back. A first-class relic of St. Maria Goretti has been placed there. Expect to see a kneeler etc. before long.\n\nHOLY HOUR FOR VOCATIONS: November 14 at 7pm: A married man wrote me just the other day about the monthly Holy Hour: “I plan to attend. I love those services…Every Catholic Church everywhere prays for vocations, but the prayer service at St. Paul of the Cross is so much more. The piano, the cello, the hymns, the incense creates the opportunity for prayer and solitude, the distinguishing marks of the Passionist Congregation, at a time when the world can seem like it’s coming apart…” I thanked him for his beautiful words. Please join us. All are welcome, Tuesday the 14th.\n\nCALENDARS: We have sold nearly 200 of the Passionist Calendars. We have about 40 or so remaining. They are nicely done with the universal feasts of the Church listed along with feasts particular to the USA. Also, all the Passionist feasts are listed and high-lighted. The daily Mass readings for each day are indicated where to be found. Enjoy!\n\nGratefully in Christ, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends,\n\nALL SAINTS DAY: Wednesday, Nov 1, is the Feast of All Saints and a Holy Day of Obligation. It began in Ireland as a feast of all the Holy Martyrs and eventually spread to England and, by the 700s, to Germany and a good part of Europe. In Rome, it was an established feast by the 900s. It is now celebrated by the entire Church. It honors not only the Holy Martyrs and Canonized Saints but all those souls now sharing the glory of God. We are thankful and hope one day this will also be our feast. Wednesdays are our prayer mornings however, this Wednesday, our 9AM Mass will be open to everyone. Also from 11 AM to Noon there will be Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament in the Church. The 12:10 Mass will be as usual.\n\nALL SOULS DAY: November 2 is the Feast of All Souls and dates back to the 800s. Much earlier, St. Augustine had recommended this feast. The date was selected as Nov.2 by the Benedictines. In the 1400s, the Dominicans started allowing priests to celebrate 3 Masses for the Dead on Nov.2. Pope Benedict XV extended that privilege to all priests in 1915 because of the number killed in WWI and Masses not said because of the bombings.\n\nHOLY HOUR FOR VOCATIONS: We continue to pray for Passionist vocations with our monthly Holy Hour on Tuesday, Nov.14th .The special Passionist that will accompany us that evening is Blessed Pius Campidelli. He was a copy of St. Gabriel, dying as a student before ordination and offering his life for the conversion of sinners. Bl. Pius is highly revered at our foundation in Central Italy. He was beatified in 1985. When I asked who among our Passionists is close to canonization, I was told that a miracle attributed to him is under investigation.\n\nPASSIONIST CALENDAR 2024: The 2nd order of 140 calendars arrived a week ago and is half sold-out. The 1st order of 100 sold out in a week. I am having a Communion breakfast soon for the Altar Guild shortly. I will give a little workshop on the calendars. I will also set a date in December when I’ll explain this Passionist calendar for any others who may want. Fr. Victor Hoagland, C.P., produced it, highlighting all our Passionist saints and\n\ncelebrations. The calendar is being sold in our Monastery Office for $5.00 (at cost).\n\nPASSIONIST RETREAT HOUSES: When I professed my vows as a Passionist in 1965, I was the youngest member of the Eastern US Province and the last in seniority. I was exactly number 650. We had monasteries and retreat houses up and down the East Coast, plus flourishing missions overseas. Since then, Passionist communities have grown tremendously in Africa, Vietnam, South America, Indonesia, the Philippines, and more. I remember at the last General Chapter in Rome being surprised at the number of Asian Passionists. However, we have declined in many of the first world countries and especially in the US. I am now number 37 in seniority of approximately 90 Passionists in the eastern US. Many of our retreat houses have closed. In an attempt to keep each house in Hartford, CT, New York, Florida, and Pittsburgh afloat and running strongly, both spiritually and financially, our Provincial is relying on us consolidating resources and working more closely with lay associates. We are all adapting and praying that this new effort goes well. It is all for God’s glory and that the Passion of Christ will always be in our hearts.\n\nWith gratitude for all your help, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends:\n\nPASSIONIST ASSOCIATES: One of the nicest things about living at the Pittsburgh Monastery is that it has a great group of Passionist Associates. They are lay people who after a period of formation in Passionist spirituality commit themselves to the charism of St. Paul of the Cross. In various ways, they assist us here in Pittsburgh. All this springs from that fire that burned in the heart of St. Paul to have Jesus Crucified loved and appreciated. The Associates stand with us, as we stand with Mary, and respond to the suffering Christ on the Cross and in the suffering members of his Body. Some help with the food we give to the poor. Others help in the running of the monastery, like serving as receptionist. Others have volunteered to help with retreat house practicalities etc. Our house has to thank Fr. Don and Jan Marco and Bernie Jordan for having formed this group so well. Paul Ruhl is the new leader. Along with Judy Callan, they are bringing new vitality to the Associates. This Sunday we will have a prayer service, during which 3 new Associates, having gone through a year of formation, will commit themselves as Associates. Our present 32 Associates will recommit themselves to Passionist spirituality and service of God’s people. After that prayer service, the Passionist professed community with the Associates will have a nice dinner. Thank you, Passionist Associates, for all you do in helping us live together the charism of St. Paul of the Cross, our beloved founder.\n\nCALENDARS AVAILABLE: A second shipment of Passionist Calendars 2024 has arrived. The first 100 went in less than a week. 140 more are available at the front office at $5.00 each. I’m selling them at cost! No freebees. I told the receptionist that only the Bishop gets a free one or if Fr. General comes from Rome! People are buying them. I plan to have a night where I’ll explain the calendar and the Passionist feasts and saints. The calendar is an aid to prayer. It’s 3 calendars in one and includes the daily Mass readings. All our Passionist feast days and saints are there.Fr. Victor called and offered me a job as his salesman!\n\nENJOYABLE FEASTDAY OF ST. PAUL OF THE CROSS: Lastly, we had a wonderful celebration for the feast of our founder. He died on Oct. 18, 1775. His feast day is Oct. 19th but in the USA Oct. 20th. Since the Passionists here were all home on the 18th, we celebrated St. Paul’s Mass then. We were joined by Fr. John, a visiting Passionist from Ireland. We also had a quiet hour of adoration before the Blessed Sacrament before noon and a wonderful dinner celebration with hors d’oeuvres beforehand. The Passionist Nuns had their celebration on Thursday. On Friday, we offered Masses in his honor in the church. Our Founder, Paul of the Cross, is one of the most wonderful saints. St. Vincent Strambi once said: “God raised up St. Paul of the Cross in the church, that we might all love God with our hearts!”\n\nWith gratitude and prayers, Fr. Justin Kerber, C.P., Rector\n\nDear Friends,\n\nPASSIONIST CALENDAR AVAILABLE: Fr. Victor Hoagland is one of my favorite Passionists. He taught my class theology.
