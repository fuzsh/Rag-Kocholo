        "text": "Saint of the Day – 10 July – Blessed Bernard of Quintavalle OFM (c1175-c1241) Friar of the Friars Minor, the first disciple of St Francis and is often called “First Fruits of the Minor Order.” Missionary, Master Provincial and trustworthy companion and legate of St Francis. He received. from St Francis on his deathbed, custody of the Friars Minor. He died nearly 20 years after St Francis. Born in c1175 in Assisi, Italy and died between 1241 and 1246 in Assisi of natural causes.\n\nAlso known as – Bernard of Assisi, Bernardo… “First fruits of the Minor Order” (“Minorum Ordinis Prima Plantula”). Additional Memorial – 2 July on some calendars.\n\nBernard, son of Quintavalle di Berardello, was a wealthy young noble from Assisi. His family’s house still stands in Assisi to this day.\n\nHe studied at Bologna University receiving his Degree in both Civil and Canon Law. He also fought in the First Crusade.\n\nHe was a rich young merchant who became acquainted with St Francis when the Saint visited his palace. On the Feast of Saint Matthias, 24 February 1208, Francis had heard the Gospel, “And going, preach, saying: The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. … Do not possess gold, nor silver, nor money in your purses … And when you come into the house, salute it, saying: Peace be to this house. … Behold I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be ye therefore wise as serpents and simple as doves!” (Matthew 10:7-19).\n\nThen Francis knew that his path was pointed out, took off his shoes and gave them away together with the staff and the belt. He put on an undyed woollen coat, tied it with a rope and went out as a beggar. This was the suit he gave to his brothers the following year.\n\nMany began to admire Francis and some wanted to become his companions and disciples. The first of these was Bernard of Quintavalle. He sold everything he owned and shared the money among the poor and thus became the first fruit in the Order.\n\nPeter of Cattaneo (Pietro Cattani), the Canon of the Cathedral of Assisi, also wanted to become Francis’s disciple and Francis gave them both the garb on 16 April 1208. The third to join them was the famous Blessed brother Giles , a man of great simplicity and spiritual wisdom. He arrived on 23 April.\n\nTogether with Francis, Bernard went to Rome to see Pope Innocent III (1198-1216) to obtain the approval of The Seraphic Rule (16 April 1209), then in 1211 he was in Florence and Bologna, places which can thank him for the beginning of his Franciscan presence in those Cities. Together with brother Giles, he travelled to Spain, where he was later,appointed as the Master Povincial (1217-1219). Between 1241 and 1243 he spent some time in Siena.\n\nHis date of death is not known, although some records declare it to have been 10 July 1241. What is quite clear, is that he was no longer alive on 11 August 1246, as his companions, the brothers Leo, Rufinus and Angelus, sent his memoirs of Francis to the General Minister and Crescentius and Bernard were then dead. He had died in Assisi as he had predicted and he is buried close to the Tomb of St Francis (below), in the Basilica of St Francis in Assisi. The Franciscan Martyrology commemorates him today, 10 July."
