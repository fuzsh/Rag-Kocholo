        "text": "Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,\n\nWe move from the still small voice of God speaking to Ezekiel in last week’s Reading from Kings to the power of Christ calming a violent storm that put the disciples on edge. These same disciples had no idea what power could be exercised by Jesus but they nonetheless blame Him for “sleeping” through the turmoil. How often we too may have, ever so sheepishly, wondered where God is in times of distress or calamities? Being overwhelmed causes us to forget that the Lord is with us always but we let our fear and distraction get the best of us. That’s when we have to make the leap of Faith:” Lord I know You are here.”\n\nThere are a couple of ways that can help us remember the Presence of the Lord. First, is making the sign of the Cross and invoking the Name of the Most Holy Trinity. Secondly, very many wear and all should wear a Cross, or Miraculous Medal or a Scapular and clutch it when the anxiety rises in us. Remember that these sacramentals are not just a decorative piece of jewelry but an expression of Faith and witness to It.\n\nYes, there will always be storms, but the love of God has given us the means to call upon Him and be reassured of His abiding Presence even in the greatest challenges in life.\n\nSaturday and Sunday are momentous occasions for our Parish and in the life of Reverend William Asinari. Henceforth he will be known as Father and the salvation of souls will be entrusted to his care in obedience to his Bishop. Most people, I dare say, do not realize the magnitude of Ordination to the Holy Priesthood but when you attend and listen attentively to the ritual a greater understanding and appreciation of Holy Orders will become known to you. Since we have the august privilege of hosting the Ordination we hope many will come to support Fr. Bill and the Priesthood in general.\n\nWith Blessings,\n\nFather Langan\n\nDear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,\n\nBy now, those of you who like to have a summer garden, be it flowers or vegetables, have planted your seeds and sprouts and are awaiting fruitful yield. In today’s Scriptures we hear a lot about planting and waiting and subsequently the “surprise” that comes from patient waiting and cultivating. We take our lesson from the natural cycle around us. But we know that if the garden and the field are not well tended all of our efforts could be a flop!\n\nHow much more than our souls and our spiritual life? Our Faith reminds us that the interior life needs diligent attention and nourishment. Our Lord provides for us with the Sacraments. Each in its own way provides nourishment for the soul, most especially the Holy Eucharist. To disregard the grace and gifts that God offers us continually means that we will dry up and perish. What then do we have to show for ourselves when we stand before the just judgement seat of the Lord?\n\nOn Thursday, June 20th, our planning committee for the 100th anniversary of St. Bernard’s will meet at 6;30pm in the Church.\n\nKeep in mind and prayer Deacon WIlliam Asinari who will be ordained to the Holy Priesthood on June 29th at 10 AM in St. John’s Church. This is a blessed day for our Parish. Please make every effort to attend, as well the First Mass the next day at 10;30 AM.\n\nWith Blessings,\n\nFather Langan\n\nDear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,\n\nThe month of June is dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Though the Feast has been commemorated this past Friday and The Immaculate Heart of Mary on Saturday we nonetheless continue our devotions and seek daily to conform our hearts to Theirs. For millennia the heart has been considered to be the seat of our emotions, our thoughts and aspirations. Only with modern science have we repositioned the proper source of where these metaphysical attributes lie. But the heart will always remain the focus when it comes to love.\n\nWe contemplate the Divine Love that comes from Christ’s Heart. Adorned with eternal flames and a crown of thorns we are mindful of both suffering and purifying endured by that Heart. He suffered to purify us so that our hearts might be prepared for entrance into heaven.\n\nThe Immaculate Heart, adorned similarly. evokes compassions, mercy and motherly tenderness directed to all of us. What consolation that brings in the midst of a world grown cold and distance from God. In fact it was for this very reason that Our Lord appeared to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque and directed her to foster recognition and devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. St. Padre Pio and many others have prayed this novena daily asking God to break through the most hardened hearts and avail themselves to the mercy of Christ. Perhaps we can and should make that part of our prayer routine.\n\nAs pastors and parishioners we extend our very best to those who are graduating this season. May God strengthen you in living the Christian Faith, being resolute disciples of Jesus, and unafraid to profess your loyalty to Him.\n\nWith Blessings,\n\nFather Langan\n\nDear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,\n\nSomething wonderful is happening in our nation and something wonderful will happen come July 17th to the 21st! I am referring to the National Eucharistic Congress that will take place in Indianapolis, Indiana this summer. What has already happened is the beginning of four pilgrimages from the four compass points in the US that will converge on Indianapolis the day before the Congress. Already we should be aware of what is going on by following on the website: Eucharisticcongress.org. If not in person at least virtually we can participate in this great witness to our Faith especially in our belief in the Real Presence of Christ our Lord in the Holy Eucharist.\n\nSadly, many of our brethren have lost their belief in what Jesus taught us particularly in John 16, the Bread of Life discourse and also a lack of belief in His promise: “I am with you unto the end of the world.” Christ’s Eucharistic Presence among us is what gets us through the trials and difficulties of life. He never promised that He would eliminate life’s challenges and disappointments but that He would be with us through them and assure us that if we believe and remain faithful only good will come of it. Did not Good Friday bring us Easter Sunday?\n\nThis Sunday we celebrate Corpus Christi, the Solemnity of the Body and Blood of Christ. We profess boldly the Real Presence in Christ in the Holy Eucharist, a mystery that will be completely understood when we get to Heaven. And as that teenage apostle of the Holy Eucharist for our day and time, Carlos Acutis, said: “the Eucharist is our highway to heaven.” Again, too many have abandoned this path and fallen on the wayside and it is only by our fervor witness that they may see the right road again and walk with us and HIM.\n\nFollowing our 10:30 Mass today we will process around St John’s Church, hopefully outside, to give evidence of our profound belief in the Holy Eucharist. Even if you have attended a previous Mass this weekend I encourage you to join us and in solidarity with those who pilgrimage from coast to coast and north to south in giving witness to the truth that Christ is with us, Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity now and forever.\n\nRemember also that at the end of this month we have the blessed and unique privilege of celebrating the Priesthood Ordination of Deacon WIlliam Asinari. Mark your calendars for the Ordination on Saturday, June 29th at 10 Am; and Sunday June 30th for his First Mass at 10:30 Am . Remember: ” No priest, no Eucharist”\n\nAnd we are now selling dinner tickets for the celebratory dinner at Lukan’s Farm Resort following the 100th Anniversary Mass at St. Bernard’s , Beach Lake, September 29th at 10:30 Am. (there will not be Mass at St John’s that day).\n\nWith Blessings,\n\nFather Langan\n\nDear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,\n\n“In the Name of….” We know the rest but so often, we are unaware of what these few words signify as we invoke the Holy Name of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Shakespeare asks the question in one of his plays: “What’s in a name?” And from a biblical perspective, especially Hebrew, there is a lot to be said. For the ancient Hebrews a name was quite a bit more than just a means to identify a person ,i.e. Tom, Dick or Harry, rather it was a revelation of the essence of a unique human being or of God Himself.\n\n“What am I to tell the people of Israel?” asks Moses in the presence of the burning bush (a physical manifestation of the Presence of God). The Lord reveals the Sacred Name, “I Am that I Am”, YHWH. Though mystical, mysterious it is nonetheless revealing, from it we may conclude that God has no beginning and no end. That is quite enough for us to meditate on. However, in the course of time, God continues to enlighten us about Who He is: “This is my beloved Son, listen to Him,” and, “I, and the Father will send you the Advocate, the Holy Spirit…”.\n\nIndeed how privileged we are to know Who God is, in spite of our puny minds, and His constant drawing us into the familial relationship of the Three Divine Persons. A simple meditation on this Mystery can overwhelm our circuitry but what consolation we receive knowing that God loves us so much that He wants us to enter into the joy of the Most Holy Trinity.\n\nOn Monday, we commemorate those who have served our nation in the armed forces, especially those who have made the ultimate sacrifice and also pray for all our departed loved ones. Weather permitting Holy Mass will be offered in St. John’s cemetery at 9am. In case of inclemency, we will move to St. Mary Magdalen Church.\n\nWith Blessings,\n\nFather Langan\n\nDear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,\n\nThe Great 50 Days have come to an end with the celebration of the Solemnity of Pentecost. In ancient Israel the people came to God with the sheaves of their first\n\nharvest in thankfulness to God. Later, as they grew in greater understanding of God’s love and concern for them, they celebrated the giving of the Law, the Torah,\n\nthe first Five Books of Moses. This became a great feast wherein they made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, as they did for Passover (Pesach), again to celebrate the blessings of God upon them. It is at this time that, after the Ascension of Our Lord, the Mother of God, The Apostles, and the disciples were gathered and awaiting the promise of the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe transformation to place from a huddled mass of simple folk to a powerhouse of an evangelizing whirl wind. From timid to bold, from shy to on fire, they who received the 7 fold gifts of the Holy Spirit could not have imagined what God had in store for them. By the hundreds, many were converted to Christ and the Church flourished. Enlightened and emboldened they left the comfort of the Upper Room to proclaim the Good News–the Gospel to the world.\n\nHow very much the world needs now a resurgence of this Divine energy. The same Holy Spirit has come upon us at our Confirmation. What is the difference? Perhaps we are reluctant to cooperate with the grace that the Holy Spirit brings. Grace needs a vessel in which to operate and that vessel has to be free of any impediments which would curtail the working of grace. That is the crux of the problem today. Temerity, fear of rejection or offending, seems to be the dam that prevents the flowing waters of the Spirit to inundate the world. All of our recent pontiffs have called for a new Pentecost and rightly so, but it can only happen when we courageously open ourselves to the power of the Holy Spirit and let Him lead us where He wills.\n\nWith Blessings,\n\nFather Langan\n\nDear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,\n\nWe are presently in the “in-between” days of the Church. Our Lord Jesus has Ascended to the Father’s right hand and the infant Church has been weaned by Christ and like a fledgling bird is waiting to spread Its wings. There is thunderous prayer arising from the Upper Room as Our Lady and the Apostles and disciples await the coming of the Advocate, the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit. There is excitement and anxiety as they wonder: “what will the future bring?” Who of us has not gone through the same? Just think of the many new and future graduates struggling with the same emotions.\n\nBut infused with this questioning and uncertainty is the power of prayer. The Church’s first novena is underway. And the confidence that comes from bringing all things to Christ, even our trepidations, assures us that the future, which is always in God’s hands, will be beyond our expectations. Did Peter ever think that he would end up, both literally and physically in Rome? Did Paul ever anticipate taking Europe by storm? We learn from and imitate the trust that the Mother of God and the followers of Christ placed in the power of prayer and the confidence that God will bring to fruition His purpose. All we need to do is cooperate. In these nine days between Ascension and Pentecost may we prepare our hearts for renewal especially in greater reverence and devotion to Christ in the Holy Eucharist. In a special way we pray for our children who next Saturday will receive Our Divine Lord for the first time. May they and their parents and family be filled with zeal and steadfast faith in coming to Christ, the Bread of Life.\n\nWith Blessings,\n\nFather Langan\n\nDear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,\n\nAs we enter the beautiful month of May we honor, most especially, the most beautiful woman who ever existed, The Blessed Virgin Mary. She epitomizes all that is good in God’s creation because of the pure and unlimited love she has for God and for us her children. That love is particularly evident at the Annunciation. Presented with the awesome request from God to be the mother of the Messiah, the Son of God, her momentarily hesitation is only because of her humility and incomprehension of the Lord’s plan. Nonetheless she says yes, “fiat”, let it be. We see in her response the two great virtues of love and obedience.\n\nVery often we may think love is based on how I feel, what I want, supposing we know what is the best for oneself. Obedience to whom? to what? does not matter as long as we are obedient to our own passions and whims. How contrary this is to the example set before us by Mary. Her yes to God, no matter what, is the course for us to follow but so often it becomes the struggle that surges in our lives. And this is what causes our anxiety and desperation. Her loving obedience, though sometimes put to the test: the loss of Jesus when He was 12, the vitriol heaved upon Him by the authorities and unbelievers, the Passion, and the rejection to this present day does not shake her love and obedience. There is an old adage: “We become what our mothers make us.” We are so privileged to call Mary our Mother because through St. John, the Lord has entrusted her to us. We, like him, welcome Mary into our home.\n\nThis Sunday we crown her with flowers as a sign of our love and affection. Flowers wilt and fade but true devotion and love are lasting. And as she has spoken to us throughout the centuries, what has she always said? Be obedient to my Son. Let us renew our love to Mary and heed always what she has said.\n\nRemember that May 9th is the Solemnity of Our Lord’s return to the Father, the Ascension, a Holy Day of Obligation. Mass times are in the bulletin and in two weeks time we will be celebrating First Holy Communion. Please keep our children in your prayers.\n\nWith Blessings,\n\nFather Langan"
