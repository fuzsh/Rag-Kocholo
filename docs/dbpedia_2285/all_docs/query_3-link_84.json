        "text": "Tag: Filippino Lippi’s Apparition of The Virgin to St. Bernard\n\nPAINTING DURING THE EARLY RENAISSANCE (1400-1495). THE TUSCAN PAINTERS. Filippino Lippi\n\nThe son of Filippo Lippi, Filippino Lippi (Prato, April 1457 – Florence, 18 April 1504) was an active painter during the later years of the Early Renaissance and first few years of the High Renaissance (this last period between 1495-1527). Filippino first learned painting from his father. When he died in 1469, he completed the frescoes left unfinished by Filippo in the apse of the cathedral of Spoleto, with the theme of Scenes of the Life of the Virgin. Filippino later completed his apprenticeship in the workshop of Botticelli (one of Filippo’s pupils), and his first works show a strong influence of his second master. As his painting technique matured and became more personal, between 1480-1485, Filippino’s painting showed a more marked departure from Botticelli’s style (see his Madonnas of Berlin, London and New York, and the Three Archangels and Young Tobia of the Galleria Sabauda, Turin).\n\nAs his painting fame increased, Filippino was called by the Medici, and together with Perugino, Ghirlandaio and Botticelli, he worked on the fresco decoration of Lorenzo de’ Medici’s villa at Spedaletto. His skills as a painter were put to the test when he was commissioned to continue the decoration of the Brancacci chapel (around 1483–1484), the same chapel Masolino and Masaccio had left unfinished. In his frescoes for the Brancacci chapel, Filippino shows influences from the art of Masaccio to the point of executing his frescoes almost in the same way the Master had done, both in style and color. For this fresco cycle, Filippino painted for the series on the Stories of Saint Peter, the following frescoes: Disputation with Simon Magus in face of Nero and Crucifixion of Saint Peter, Saint Peter Jailed and Liberation of St. Peter.\n\nAround 1485, Filippino was asked to paint the altarpiece with the Apparition of the Virgin to St. Bernard (Badia Fiorentina Abbey Church, Florence). This panel is Filippino’s most popular painting. He worked on it between 1485 to 1487. Here we can see the same artistic qualities of his father (Fra’ Filippo), though some exaggerated. This is an admirable work with a singular idealization of reality. Saint Bernard bows his head, surprised, before the figure of the Virgin, who appeared to dictate her treatise on the “Song of Songs”, which he’s writing at the desk. The Virgin is a delicate Florentine young woman, with a long pale neck and golden hair, which escapes her transparent veil. Her halo is crystalline; light diffuses silhouetting her fine hands and shining clothes. Both in technique and depiction of the landscape, Filippino was much more advanced than his father.\n\nOn April 21, 1487, Filippino received a commission by Filippo Strozzi to decorate the family’s chapel in the church of Santa Maria Novella with frescoes developing the Stories of St. John Evangelist and St. Philip. He completed this work until 1503 as he worked on it intermittently. The windows of this chapel were also designed by Filippino and completed between June and July 1503; they develop musical themes. All these works for the Strozzi family reflected the political and religious crisis in Florence during that time: the clash between Christianity and Paganism, a hotly debated topic in Florence during the times of Girolamo Savonarola.\n\nIn 1488, Filippino went to Rome, as Lorenzo de’ Medici advised Cardinal Oliviero Carafa to commissioned him with the decoration of the family chapel in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. He finished these frescoes by 1493.\n\nSome time between 1491 and 1494, Filippino returned to Florence and worked in such paintings as: Apparition of Christ to the Virgin (ca. 1493, now in Munich), Adoration of the Magi (1496, originally painted for the Church of San Donato in Scopeto, now in the Uffizi Gallery), Sacrifice of Laocoön (ca. 190’s, for the villa of Lorenzo de’ Medici at Poggio a Caiano), and St. John Baptist and Maddalena (Valori Chapel in San Procolo, Florence). For the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna, Filippino painted in 1501 the Mystic Wedding of St. Catherine and in 1503 he completed the Tabernacle of the Christmas Song for the city of Prato and now housed in its municipal Museum.\n\nFilippino’s final work was the Deposition for the Santissima Annunziata church in Florence, which was unfinished at the time of his death in April 1504. Because of his high fame and reputation, on the day of his burial all the workshops of Florence closed as an homage.\n\n________________________________________\n\nSibyl: The oracles in Ancient Greece. Their prophecies were influenced by divine inspiration from a deity; originally at Delphi and Pessinos.\n\nSotto in su: (From Italian meaning “from below to above”). In drawing and painting, it refers to extreme foreshortening of figures painted on a ceiling or other high surface so as to give the illusion that the figures are suspended in air above the viewer. It is an approach that was developed during the Renaissance, and it was especially favored by Baroque and Rococo painters, particularly in Italy.\n\nTempera grassa: A type of tempera in which oil is added in no more than a 1:1 ratio with the egg yolk by volume which produces a water-soluble medium with many of the color effects of oil paint, although it cannot be painted thickly."
