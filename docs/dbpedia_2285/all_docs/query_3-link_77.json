        "text": "A vast literature suggests that individuals who are more deeply involved in religion tend to have better physical and mental health than people who are not involved in religion (Koenig, McCullough, & Larson, 2001). A good deal of this work has been conducted with older adults (e.g., Krause, 2002). This makes sense because research consistently reveals that people who are currently older are more deeply involved in religion than individuals who are presently younger (Barna, 2002). So if religion truly affects health, as many claim, then the impact of religion on health should be especially evident among older adults.\n\nAs work in this field has evolved, a growing number of researchers have begun to explore the relationship between religion and health in different racial and ethnic groups. So far, virtually all of this research has involved older African Americans (Taylor, Chatters, & Levin, 2004) while considerably less attention has been given to older adults in other racial groups. This is especially true of older Mexican Americans. This is unfortunate because Hispanic Americans are the most rapidly growing minority group in the country. In fact, demographers predict that older Hispanic Americans will soon pass older African Americans to become the second largest racial group in the United States (Federal Interagency Forum on Aging Related Statistics, 2004). The purpose of the current study is to address this gap in the literature by focusing on how religion may enhance the health and well-being of older Mexican Americans.\n\nAssessing the relationship between religion and health in any racial group is challenging because researchers have known for some time that religion is a complex multidimensional phenomenon (Fetzer Institute/National Institute on Aging Working Group, 1999). As a result, it would be difficult to assess allthe ways in whichreligionmay affect the healthof older Mexican Americans in a single study. Consequently, the goal of the current study is to focus on one aspect of religion that has emerged from our ongoing qualitative work–the interface between religion, pain, and suffering.\n\nThemes of pain and suffering are deeply embedded in many facets of Mexican American life, including religion. There are several historical reasons why pain and suffering occupy such a central role in this culture (Leon, 2004; Rodriguez, 1994). To begin with, the conquest of Mexico by the Spanish led to a three-tiered system of stratification with people born in Spain at the top, people of Spanish decent who were born in the New World in the second tier, and native people and individuals of mixed heritage at the bottom (Rodriguez, 1994). As Leon (2004) points out, those at the bottom encountered a good deal of pain and suffering. In fact, he refers to the period of colonization as the “Mexican diaspora” (Leon, 2004, p. 198).\n\nThe deleterious consequences of colonization by the Spanish were exacerbated by a number of subsequent historical events. The Mexican American War of 1848, the Mexican Revolution of 1910, and the labor shortages of World War I each in their own distinct way rekindled the earlier conditions of subordination and diaspora encountered during the Spanish colonization. Although the Mexican origin population in the Southwest at the end of the Mexican American War is estimated at under 100,000 (Gomez, 2007; Nostrand, 1975), the Mexican residents of the newly acquired territories, nevertheless, became “… a dominated people, (who were) rendered politically and economically powerless” (Rodriguez, 1994, p. 68; see also, Gomez, 2007). This led to what Rodriguez (1994) calls the “psychological colonization” of this population. This earlier pattern of domination primed the conditions for the experiences that would be encountered by much larger waves of immigrants following the unrest created by the Mexican Revolution and the labor shortages of World War I. As a result of these later waves of immigration, the U. S. Mexican origin population in 1930 had grown to slightly under 1.5 million (Birdsall & Florin, 1992; Graton & Gutmann, 2000). A chapter in Leon’s (2004) book, which is titled, “The Terror of Postcolonial History” (p. 23), succinctly captures the impact of these times on the lives of Mexican Americans.\n\nThe vestiges of the historical past are evident in the way more contemporary scholars view Mexican culture, and by extension, Mexican American culture. Octavio Paz is a Nobel Laureate who is widely regarded as one of Mexico’s leading poets and essayists. In one of his works, The Labyrinth of Solitude, he discusses at length the role that solitude and suffering play in the lives of many Mexicans (Paz, 1985). He defines solitude as “… the feeling and knowledge that one is alone, alienated from the world and oneself …” (p. 195). He points out that solitude creates a dialectic: “… on the one hand it is self-awareness, on the other it is a longing to escape from ourselves” (p. 195). It is especially important for the purposes of the current study to point out that Paz equates this solitude with suffering: “Popular language reflects this dualism by identifying solitude with suffering …” (p. 196).\n\nGiven the overwhelming impact of historical circumstances and the imprint these broad social forces left on the psyche of people of Mexican decent, it is not surprising to find that many sought comfort in their faith. Perhaps the most visible manifestation of these efforts may be found in the culturally unique beliefs surrounding Our Lady of Guadalupe. Elizondo (1980) provides a detailed account of how the Virgin Mary appeared to Juan Diego, a Mexican peasant, in 1531. The Virgin told Juan Diego that she had come to give faith and courage to the people of Mexico and that she would “… remedy all their miseries, pains, and sufferings” (Elizondo, 1980, p. 31). The apparition of the Virgin in 1531 came at a deeply troubling time in the history of Mexico. As Carrasco (1990) reports, there were close to 25 million indigenous people living in Mexico in 1500. But due to factors such as disease and slavery, this population was reduced to 1 million by 1600. Mexican American people were drawn to Our Lady because she was seen as belonging specifically to their own culture. In fact, as Fernandez (2007) points out, the Virgin spoke with Juan Diego in Nahuatl, the ancient language of the Aztecs. Moreover, the realization that Our Lady had suffered deeply from the death of her own Son served to strengthen the bond between her and members of the Mexican American community. Over the centuries, Our Lady of Guadalupe “… came to occupy a place so central to Mexican culture that any consideration of the Mexican people in general … must include reference to her” (Rodriguez, 1994, p. 46).\n\nThe historical accounts of pain and suffering are important because they provide valuable insight into the forces that have shaped the religious lives of many older Mexican Americans today. Moreover, as research on Our Lady of Guadalupe reveals, many older Mexican Americans have relied on their faith to help them deal with these challenges. But there is still a lot we do not know about the relationships among religion, pain, suffering, and health in Mexican American culture. In order to move this literature forward, researchers must address two key problems.\n\nFirst, researchers need to know more about how religion shapes the belief structures that buttress views on pain and suffering among older Mexican Americans. More specifically, greater insight is needed into what older people think religion has to say about why pain and suffering exist, and researchers need to learn more about the social and psychological resources that are provided by religion to help older Mexican Americans deal with these problems in their lives.\n\nSecond, researchers need to delve more deeply into the ways in which religious views on pain and suffering may affect the physical and mental health of older Mexican Americans. A substantial amount of research links adversity with physical and mental health (McEwen & Lasley, 2002), but there do not appear to be any studies that explore the relationships among religion, pain, suffering, and health specifically within this cultural group.\n\nGiven these gaps in the knowledge base, it is imperative that researchers turn to older Mexican Americans themselves to find out how issues involving pain, suffering, and religion are experienced in daily life. This is best accomplished by gleaning insights from unstructured interviews with older Mexican American people. This will help ensure that we capture how older Mexican Americans live out the experience of pain and suffering within the context of religion. Moreover, by relying on qualitative techniques, we can convey these experiences through the words and phrases that are used by older Mexican Americans themselves. Other researchers have explored the nature and meaning of pain and suffering in a wider social context (Black & Rubinstein, 2004), but we have not been able to identify any qualitative studies that focus specifically on older Mexican Americans nor can we find any qualitative studies that examine the role played by religion in this process.\n\nIn the discussion that follows, we provide an overview of the mechanics of our qualitative study. Following this, we turn to a detailed discussion of the major themes involving pain, suffering, and religion that emerge from a series of in-depth interviews with a large group of older Mexican Americans. In the process, we search for ways in which the themes that emerge from our data may be linked to physical and mental health in late life.\n\nConclusions\n\nAs Black and Rubinstein (2004) convincingly demonstrate, suffering is not a simple unified conceptual phenomenon. Instead, it is a complex multidimensional construct that encompasses a large substantive domain. The purpose of the current study has been to explore the content domain of suffering. But unlike Black and Rubinstein, we were concerned with pain and suffering that arises in a more limited social and psychological context. More specifically, our aim was to explore pain and suffering that is associated with the religious experiences of older Mexican Americans. Viewing pain and suffering in a more limited arena makes it possible to probe more deeply into a number of issues that have not been discussed by other investigators. In the process, our findings help dispel a number of commonly held beliefs about the role that pain and suffering presumably play in the religious lives of older Mexican Americans. Rather than pointing to a tight consensus, the data we provide reveal that some older Mexican Americans feel that pain and suffering are a necessary part of religious life whereas others do not believe this is so. Moreover, for some, suffering is a Biblical necessity that performs a number of important religious functions. But for others, suffering comes only from one’s own shortcomings and functions as little more than punishment for sins. Views on how to cope with pain and suffering were also quite varied. For some older Mexican Americans, it is imperative to suffer in silence because they believe that Jesus and Mary suffered in silence. But for other study participants, suffering serves as an occasion to reach out to significant others in order to take advantage of the assistance and advice they can provide. Given the collectivist nature of Mexican American culture (Kaniasty & Norris, 2000), one might expect to find that all older Mexican Americans would seek support from family members and friends whenever difficult times arise. However, our data suggest this may not be so. This finding provides an interesting example of how some aspects of the Catholic religion may be at odds with elements of the wider racial or ethnic culture in which it is practiced.\n\nOver the course of our in-depth interviews, the older people in our study pointed to a number of ways in which pain and suffering may influence physical and mental health. These linkages are both explicitly religious and decidedly secular. Among the more religious linkages are things like feeling grateful to God. But some of the linkages involving more secular factors were especially thought provoking. This is especially true with respect to the interface between pain, suffering, and social relationships. The potentially important influence of significant others emerges at several key junctures in the process of dealing with pain and suffering. For example, the data we presented suggest that some, but not all, older Mexican Americans choose to suffer in silence while others turn to family members and close friends for help. Our findings further reveal that whether older Mexican Americans avail themselves of this assistance depends, in part, upon the nature of the relationships that have been forged with social network members over time. If relationship histories are rife with conflict, then suffering in silence appears to be a more viable option. Viewed more broadly, the fact that some older Mexican Americans turn to significant others for help provides one way of showing what grand social theorists have been discussing for over a century. More specifically, these grand masters argued that social ties lie at the very heart of religion itself. Evidence of this may be found, for example, in the work of Simmel (1898/1997), who maintained that, “The faith that has come to be regarded as the essence and substance of religion is first of all a relationship between human beings …” (p. 108, emphasis in the original).\n\nAlthough the insights that emerged from our data on pain, suffering, and social relationships are helpful, a number of questions remain unanswered. Four issues that have yet to be explored fully are discussed briefly below.\n\nFirst, the data indicate that at least some older Mexican Americans turn to their social network members for help when pain and suffering arise. But we know relatively little about what takes place once contact with significant others has been made. Researchers need to find out more about how social network members help define and shape the meaning of pain and suffering, and greater insight is needed into the coping responses they may recommend.\n\nSecond, it would be helpful to find out more about the role that a pastor or priest may play when pain and suffering arise. As the official head of a congregation, a priest is often consulted when difficult times are encountered by a rank-and-file church member. In fact, there are a number of journals that deal exclusively with the ways in which members of the clergy assist church members who are confronted by adversity (e.g., Pastoral Counseling). Although there are a number of ways to explore the role that is played by a priest in the pain and suffering process, one of the more intriguing lines of inquiry involves focusing on how assistance from the priest may interface with the informal assistance that is provided by family members, close friends, and fellow church members. Three potentially important scenarios arise in this respect: some older Mexican Americans may rely solely on a priest when pain and suffering is encountered, others may turn only to informal social network members for help, whereas other Mexican Americans may rely on both a priest and informal sources of support. If older Mexican Americans speak only with a priest about pain and suffering, would they still believe they are suffering in silence? If an older Mexican American relies on both a priest and informal network members for assistance, how is the information provided by the priest integrated with the insights provided by informal others to form a more comprehensive response to pain and suffering? For example, it seems as though it would not be difficult for an older Mexican American to know what to do if the advice that is provided by significant others is consistent with, and reinforces, the advice that is provided by a priest. In this instance, evidence of a linking function would be evident between the different elements of an older Mexican American’s social world. But the decision about how to cope with pain and suffering may be much more complicated if the advice provided by the two sources is at odds. For example, what happens if a priest advocates the virtues of suffering in silence, but social network members reach out to an older person when they become aware of the plight that confronts him or her? Under these circumstances, would an older person follow the advice of the priest and keep their problems to themselves, or would they instead take advantage of the assistance that is offered by family members and friends? This alternative scenario would depict a substitution function whereby assistance from one source (e.g., a priest) takes precedence over the help that is offered by another source (e.g., family members and friends). As the distinction between the linking and substitution hypotheses reveals, research on pain, suffering, and social relationships provides a rich conceptual context for better understanding the factors that shape the ways in which older Mexican Americans respond to adversity.\n\nThe third issue that needs to be explored also involves the issue of suffering in silence. More specifically, research is needed on the factors that promote and reinforce the decision to face adversity alone. The data we provide suggest that this may be a rather complex issue, and the insights that were gleaned from our interviews point to a number of issues that should be explored in this respect. As our data reveal, the decision to suffer in silence may be determined, at least in part, by the nature of the stressor that confronts an older person. Moreover, the decision to face adversity alone may be shaped by relationship histories, as well. Taken together, these insights suggest that the decision to suffer in silence may emerge from a complex matrix of factors involving religious teachings, the nature of the stressor that confronts one, and relationships’ histories that are formed with informal social network members over time.\n\nThe fourth issue involves more delving more deeply into the interface between religion and the wider secular world in which it is embedded. The primary goal of our study was to see how religion shapes the ways in which older Mexican Americans react to the pain and suffering in their lives. However, as our data reveal, the religious views that some older study participants expressed were influenced by the wider secular world–recall the older woman who said that Jesus and Mary never suffered. This suggests that it may not be easy to neatly partition religious and secular life and that more research is needed on the influence that one exerts on the other.\n\nAs these unanswered questions reveal, the field of research on religion, pain, and suffering is wide open. This is especially true with respect to research with older Mexican Americans. We hope the work we have done helps other investigators see the value in pursuing research in this field. Doing so should provide valuable insight into one of the key facets of leading a religious life."
