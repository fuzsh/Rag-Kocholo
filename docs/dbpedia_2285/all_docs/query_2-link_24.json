        "text": "Following the retreat, the seminarians travel to Rome for academic courses in Theology, History of the Church, and Christian Art and Architecture. The courses are supplemented by visits to Vatican Congregations, attendance at Papal Liturgies and General Audience, and pilgrimages to churches and holy sites throughout Rome and surrounding towns. The pilgrimages, in particular, are opportunities for the seminarians to pray at the tombs of the great saints and martyrs of the early churchâ€”to deepen their friendship with Jesus Christ and priestly zeal for the New Evangelization.\n\nCourses and activities are planned within a daily schedule centered on the celebration of the Eucharist, Liturgy of the Hours, and an hour of meditation before the Blessed Sacrament. An emphasis on daily prayer, learning to contemplate the life of Jesus, is essential to helping the seminarians to keep the presence of God. It also helps to emphasize the importance in the first years of the priesthood to have a plan of life. The daily schedule also includes time for fostering fraternity and friendships among classmates which are vitally important to priestly life.\n\nThe program concludes with several days of recollection on a Marian pilgrimage, seeking the motherly intercession and protection of the Virgin Mary before returning home to the United States."
