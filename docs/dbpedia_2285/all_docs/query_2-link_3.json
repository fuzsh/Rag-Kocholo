        "text": "What can we say about Rome that has not been said a thousand times before? No where else can you find so many reminders of the history of the Catholic Church and so many beautiful churches and monuments.\n\nAnd much of Rome is easy to walk. Many of these locations are within 10-20 blocks of one another, so if you pace yourself (perhaps stop for a cup of cappuccino…or a gelato….along the way) you can easily visit many of these places on foot. Of course if you are with an organized tour they will probably provide your own private transportation. Check in advance to find out–especially if you have mobility problems–but don’t let that keep you away. And, of course, may organized tours have some free time which allows you to head off to places not included in that particular tour.\n\nA word of warning about local tour guides in Rome:\n\nSome local guides are excellent and some are very poor. In addition, some can be quite anti-Catholic. Comments such as “these items were stolen from…..and brought to Rome” or the use of the word “legend” rather than “tradition” will give the traveler a biased and in-accurate experience.\n\nAnd, be aware, that Italy has strict licensing laws concerning guides. A guide might be licensed for Assisi, but not Rome, or vice-versa. If you use an unlicensed guide and he gets stopped by the authorities, your tour might come to an abrupt halt!\n\nClick here to read our suggestions about private tour guides in Rome.\n\nWhether traveling on your own or with a group, we recommend you have a map to orient yourself to the city. Even if you are with a tour group, it is nice to know the layout of the city.\n\nFor example, you might find that the hotel you are staying in is just a few blocks from Saint Peter’s Square and you can get out and explore on your own after dinner. The “City Wise” maps are great–waterproof and easy to fold and read.\n\nFor help finding your way around, we suggest the “Little Black Book of Rome” It is organized by location rather than alphabetically like so many guide books, so it can help you plan your daily itinerary.\n\nAnd, of course, Rome can be a starting point for many other cities in Italy. And we recommend traveling by train: Italian trains are fast, clean and take you right to the heart of town. Get train & bus schedules, see fares & buy tickets here\n\nCheck out the many day trips from Rome: Florence, Tuscany, Naples & more.\n\nOr perhaps a Pasta-Making Class: Cook, Dine & Drink Wine With A Local Chef\n\nClick here for “Vatican Cookbook Set” by The Pontifical Swiss Guard..buy it for yourself or order the gift set for someone else.\n\nBelow are some of the most notable Churches in Rome\n\n♦ Indicates one of the Seven Station Pilgrimage Churches of Rome.
