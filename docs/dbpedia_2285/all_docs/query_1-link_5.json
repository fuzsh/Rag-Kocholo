        "text": "Archbishop Gregory’s Coat of Arms\n\nThe impalement of the personal Arms of Archbishop Gregory with those of the Archdiocese of Atlanta was undertaken by Deacon Paul Sullivan of Saunderstown, Rhode Island. The Arms of the Archdiocese of Atlanta were devised by the late William F. J. Ryan, New York, NY, and West Chatham, MA.\n\nWritten by: Rev. Mr. Paul J. Sullivan, Permanent Deacon of the Diocese of Providence\n\nBlazon\n\nArms impaled. Dexter: Bary wavy of seven Argent and Azure; at the centre point overall an open crown Or and at the honour point a rose of the first with a center of the last. Sinister: Argent, on a cross Gules a cross Sable fimbriated Vert; between to chief dexter a raven Proper, to chief sinister a bear rampant of the third, to base dexter a fleur-de-lis of the second and to base sinister a phoenix Or issuant from flames of the second.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe archiepiscopal heraldic achievement or archbishop’s coat of arms is composed of a shield with its charges (symbols), a motto scroll and the external ornamentation. The shield, which is the central and most important feature of any heraldic device, is described (blazoned) in 12th century terms that are archaic to our modern language, and this description is presented if given by the bearer with the shield being worn on the arm. Thus, where it applies, the terms dexter and sinister are reversed as the device is viewed from the front.\n\nBy heraldic tradition the arms of the bishop, who is “first among equals” of an ecclesiastical province, called a “Metropolitan Archbishop,” are joined, impaled, with the arms of his jurisdiction. In this case, these are the arms of the Archdiocese of Atlanta.\n\nThese arms are composed of a field that is composed of seven alternating silver (white) and blue bars charged with a silver and gold rose and a gold crown.\n\nFor years, known as the “Crossroads of the South,” because it served as the hub of transportation in the region, Atlanta was originally known as “ Whitehall .” A succession of names, “Terminus,” in 1843 “Marthasville”, finally came to be “ Atlanta,” indirectly referencing the Atlantic Ocean, signified by the wavy bars of the design, in 1847. Upon this symbolism are an open gold crown to honor the titular of the Cathedral Church , Christ the King and a Cherokee Rose (Rosa Laevigata), a white rose with a golden center, the state flower of Georgia.\n\nFor his personal arms, His Excellency, Archbishop Gregory has retained the design that was adopted upon his selection to receive the fullness of Christ’s Priesthood, as a bishop, when he was appointed as an Auxiliary Bishop for the Archdiocese of Chicago and he retained the design during his tenure as Bishop of Belleville.\n\nOn a silver (white) field is a cross, of The Faith, that is composed of three colors; black on green on red. These colors are referred to as the African-American colors and by their use, His Excellency, Archbishop Gregory honors the religious and racial heritage that has come to him from his parents, Wilton and Ethel (Duncan) Gregory.\n\nWithin the quarters that are formed by the cross are a raven, to honor the Archbishop’s Benedictine education at Sant’ Anselmo (in Rome), and a black bear taken from the arms of His Eminence, Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, His Excellency’s principal Episcopal consecrator. Also within the quarters are a red fleur-de-lis taken from the arms of the Mundelein Seminary in Chicago, where Archbishop Gregory was a student and faculty member, and a golden phoenix, coming forth from red flames, to honor Chicago, the city reborn after the famous Chicago fire.\n\nFor his motto, Archbishop Gregory continues to use the phrase “We are the Lord’s,” which is taken from St. Paul ’s Epistle to the Romans (Romans 14:8). By the use of this phrase, His Excellency, Archbishop Gregory expresses the deep Christian belief that all that we are and in all that we do, “we are the Lord’s.”\n\nThe achievement is completed with the external ornaments which are a gold processional cross that has two cross-members, that is placed in back of and which extends above and below the shield, and the pontifical hat, called the “gallero,” with its ten tassels, in four rows, on either side of the shield, all in green. These are the heraldic insignia of a prelate of the rank of archbishop by instruction of The Holy See of March 31, 1969.\n\nAuxiliary Bishop Luis R. Zarama’s Coat of Arms\n\nThe impalement of the personal Arms of Bishop Zarama with those of the Archdiocese of Atlanta was undertaken by Deacon Paul Sullivan of Saunderstown, Rhode Island.\n\nBlazon:\n\nAzure, upon a chevron of double width Or a semé of crosses Gules; to chief dexter a rose of the second and to sinister a lily Agent; in base a lion’s hear couped of the second.\n\nSignificance:\n\nThe episcopal heraldic achievement or bishop’s coat of arms is composed of a shield with its charges (symbols), a motto scroll and the external ornamentation. The shield, which is the central and most important feature of any heraldic device, is described (blazoned) in 12th century terms, that are archaic to our modern language, and this description is presented as if given by the bearer with the shield being worn on the arm. Thus, where it applies, the terms dexter and sinister are reversed as the device is viewed from the front.\n\nFor his personal arms, His Excellency, Bishop Zarama has adopted a design to reflect his life and ministry as a priest.\n\nOn a blue field is displayed an extra wide chevron of Gold (yellow). This device gives the illusion of two mountains; a gold one and a blue one. The gold mountain (the chevron) is charged with a scattering (semé) of red crosses to represent the Bishop’s home city of Pasto, in southwestern Colombia, which is known as “The Theological City.” The lower mountain (part of the blue field) has a golden lion’s head to represent the Evangelist, Saint Mark, who is the titular patron of the parish in Clarkesville, Georgia, on a mountain, where Bishop Zarama served as pastor.\n\nAbove the chevron are a gold rose Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus, also known as “The Little Flower,” and a silver (white) lily for Saint Joseph, the Foster Father of Jesus, who have served as Bishop Zarama’s particular patron throughout his life as a priest and now as a bishop.\n\nHis Excellency, Bishop Zarama has selected for his motto the Latin phrase “DEUS CARITAS EST.” This phrase “GOD IS LOVE” is the title of an encyclical by His Holiness, Pope Benedict XVI, and it sums up in a succinct statement all that the Church and Christianity are to be all about . . . sharing the love of God.\n\nThe achievement is completed with the external ornaments which are a gold episcopal processional cross, that is placed in back of and which extends above and below the shield, and the pontifical hat, called a “gallero,” with its six tassels, in three rows, on either side of the shield, all in green. These are the heraldic insignia of a prelate of the rank of bishop by instruction of The Holy See of March 31, 1969.\n\nby: Deacon Paul J. Sullivan\n\nAuxiliary Bishop David Prescott Talley’s Coat of Arms\n\nThe impalement of the personal Arms of Bishop Talley with those of the Archdiocese of Atlanta was undertaken by Deacon Paul Sullivan of Saunderstown, Rhode Island.\n\nBlazon:\n\nParty per chevron Vert and Azure; the chevron bary wavy Argent and of the second; to chief a “Stella Maris” of the third between two “Cherokee Roses” Proper; the bark of St. Peter Or, the sail of the third charged with the monogram of the Holy Name Gules.\n\nSignificance:\n\nThe episcopal heraldic achievement, or bishop’s coat of arms, is composed of a shield, which is the central and most important part of the design, a scroll with a motto and the external ornamentation. The design is described (blazoned) as if the description was being given by the bearer (from behind) with the shield being worn on the left arm. Thus, it must be remembered, where it applies, as the device is viewed from the front that the terms sinister and dexter are reversed.\n\nAs a bishop without canonical jurisdiction (an auxiliary bishop), Bishop Talley’s personal arms occupy the entire shield of the design.\n\nHis Excellency, Bishop Talley’s arms are composed of several major and significant aspects. Prime among these is the special twelve-pointed silver (white) star known as the “Stellar Maris,” or “Star of the Sea,” a classic symbol honoring Our Blessed Mother, to whom His Excellency has such deep and profound devotion. The Stella Maris is placed between two “Cherokee Roses,” silver (white) petals and gold (yellow) barbs and seed, that are the state flower of Georgia and are displayed in the arms of the Diocese of Savannah, where Bishop Talley was born, in Columbus, and in the arms of the Archdiocese of Atlanta where His Excellency has been called to serve as Auxiliary Bishop.\n\nThe chevron, from the Prescott family arms is composed of Silver (white) and blue wavy bars, representing water and it signifies the Chattahoochee and the Savannah rivers that run throughout the territories of the two Georgia dioceses.\n\nIn the base of the design, is the bark of St. Peter, gold (yellow) with a silver (white) sail charged with the IHS, the monogram of the Holy Name, in red. The bark is the central feature of the logotype of the “Year of Faith” as designated by Pope Benedict XVI; the year of the New Evangelization now being carried forward by a new Holy Father, Pope Francis.\n\nFor his motto, His Excellency Bishop Talley has selected the Latin phrase “DABO VOBIS COR NOVUM.” The phrase, taken from the Book of Ezekiel (Ez. 36:26) expresses His Excellency’s faith that Jesus Christ instructs us that He “Will Give You a New Heart.”\n\nThe achievement is completed by the external ornamentation which are a gold (yellow) processional cross, that is placed in back of the shield and which extends above and below the shield, and the pontifical hat, called a “galero,” with its six tassels in three rows on either side of the shield, all in green. These are the heraldic insignia of a prelate of the rank of bishop, by instruction of The Holy See, of March 31, 1969.\n\nby: Deacon Paul J. Sullivan\n\nThe entire “achievement,” or coat of arms as it is generally called, is composed of the shield with its charges, the motto and the external ornaments. As one looks at the shield the terms dexter (right) and sinister (left) must be understood contrariwise, as the shield was worn on the arm in medieval days and these terms were used in the relationship of the one bearing the shield.\n\nThe dexter impalement is given in ecclesiastical heraldry to the arms of jurisdiction; in this instance, the arms of the Archdiocese of Atlanta.\n\nAtlanta known as the “Crossroads of the South,” because of converging railroads which gave the city its early prominence, received its name as the eastern terminus of the Western and Atlantic Railroad which connected north Georgia with the Tennessee River. Originally called Whitehall, then Terminus, and afterwards in 1843 Marthasville, the state legislature finally acquiesced to the wishes of the railroad and accepted the name of Atlanta in 1847, thus naming the city indirectly after the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean is represented on the shield of the archdiocese by white and blue wavy bars, the heraldic equivalent of the waves of the sea; seven bars in number to symbolize the Seven Sacraments.\n\nThe crown of Christ the King denotes the title of the cathedral church, the Eternal King whose redeeming Sacrifice on the Cross is renewed daily in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. Above the crown is placed the Cherokee rose, the State flower of Georgia (Rosa Laevigata), as befits an archdiocese located in the Capital City. The Cherokee rose is a white flower with a yellow center.\n\nThe crown of Christ the King, in the arms of the Archdiocese of Atlanta, also has the secondary representation of the crown of King George II of England after whom Georgia was named. The blue and white wavy bands may be said as well to symbolize the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge country; but, more important, these are the colors of our Blessed Mother.\n\nThe sinister impalement, on the right of the viewer, bears the personal arms of Archbishop Marino. These consist of a blue shield with a lamb in a walking position supporting with its right foreleg a gold pastoral staff. The chief or upper portion of the shield is silver with a wavy line separating the upper and lower portions. A red chevron is superimposed on the upper portion.\n\nThe lamb has an honored and ancient history in Christian art as a symbol of Christ and the Eucharist as well as being the object of the shepherd’s care.\n\nIn this instance, the lamb is supporting a pastoral staff by which Archbishop Marino wishes to emphasize the strength which comes from the unity of the pastor with those committed to his care. The lamb recalls the words of Christ to Simon Peter: “Feed my lambs,” as recorded by John the Evangelist in his Gospel chapter 21, verse 15, and selected by Archbishop Marino as his episcopal motto. The lamb also recalls the archbishop’s paternal heritage for it is the chief element on the Great Seal of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nThe wavy chief, upper portion, symbolic of water, both scripturally and sacramentally recalls the necessity of washing, cleansing and giving of life to those who would live in Christ. It also represents the archbishop’s native state of Mississippi, “The Father of Waters,” and acknowledges his maternal heritage and birthplace.\n\nIt is an established custom in ecclesiastical heraldry for members of religious orders who are raised to the episcopate to display the arms of their community, or part of it, in their episcopal arms. In keeping with this custom, the archbishop, a member of the Society of Saint Joseph and the Sacred Heart (Jospehites), selected the carpenter’s square as a chevron from the arms of the community. It is tinctured red in honor of the Sacred Heart.\n\nThe blue field of the archbishop’s shield honors the Blessed Virgin Mary. It also is found in the arms of the Josephite community.\n\nBehind the arms is placed a gold archiepiscopal cross with double traverse. Surrounding the shield or “achievement,” is a pontifical hat with ten tassels on each side in four rows, all in green.\n\nPrior to 1870, the pontifical hat was worn in solemn conclaves held in conjunction with papal functions. The color of the pontifical hat and the number and color of the tassels were signs of the rank of a prelate, a custom which is still preserved in ecclesiastical heraldry.\n\nThe entire “achievement,” or coat of arms as it is generally called, is composed of the shield with its charges, the motto and the external ornaments. As one looks at the shield the terms dexter (right) and sinister (left) must be understood contrariwise, as the shield was worn on the arm in medieval days and these terms were used in the relationship of the one bearing the shield.\n\nThe dexter impalement is given in ecclesiastical heraldry to the arms of jurisdiction; in this instance, the arms of the Archdiocese of Atlanta.\n\nAtlanta known as the “Crossroads of the South,” because of converging railroads which gave the city its early prominence, received its name as the eastern terminus of the Western and Atlantic Railroad which connected north Georgia with the Tennessee River. Originally called Whitehall, then Terminus, and afterwards in 1843 Marthasville, the state legislature finally acquiesced to the wishes of the railroad and accepted the name of Atlanta in 1847, thus naming the city indirectly after the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean is represented on the shield of the archdiocese by white and blue wavy bars, the heraldic equivalent of the waves of the sea; seven bars in number to symbolize the Seven Sacraments.\n\nThe crown of Christ the King denotes the title of the cathedral church, the Eternal King whose redeeming Sacrifice on the Cross is renewed daily in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. Above the crown is placed the Cherokee rose, the State flower of Georgia (Rosa Laevigata), as befits an archdiocese located in the Capital City. The Cherokee rose is a white flower with a yellow center.\n\nThe crown of Christ the King, in the arms of the Archdiocese of Atlanta, also has the secondary representation of the crown of King George II of England after whom Georgia was named. The blue and white wavy bands may be said as well to symbolize the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge country; but, more important, these are the colors of our Blessed Mother.\n\nThe sinister impalement, on the right of the viewer, bears the personal arms of Archbishop Donnellan.\n\nThe oak tree from the coat of arms of the Donnellan family of Galway, the ancestors of the Archbishop, has been emblazoned on the personal arms, but the field has been changed from silver to gold that the Irish colors might prevail to pay homage to Saint Patrick, the title of the Cathedral of the Archdiocese of New York, where Archbishop Donnellan spent the early years of his priesthood.\n\nThe ermine spots at either side are derived from the coat of arms of Francis Cardinal Spellman, the late Cardinal-Archbishop of New York, by whom Archbishop Donnellan was ordained a priest and consecrated a bishop.\n\nThe chief (upper portion) is given to two spearheads at either side of a saltire. The spearheads recall that the archbishop’s baptismal patron, Saint Thomas was martyred by these instruments. The saltire is the well-known symbol of Saint Andrew, the Apostle, whose name the Archbishop also bears. Saint Andrew, the brother of Saint Peter, is believed to have been martyred upon a cross in the shape of the letter X.\n\nThe motto, “Ministrare non Ministrari,” is translated “To serve, not to be served.” The full text of the scriptural verse from which the motto is derived reads: “… even as the Son of Man has not come to be served but to serve, and to give his life for the ransom for many.” (Matthew 20:28). A motto expresses briefly an ideal, a plan of life and the spirit of the one who selects it.\n\nThe external ornaments are composed of the pontifical hat, with its tassels, disposed in four rows, all in green, and the archiepiscopal cross with double transverse tinctured in gold. These are the trappings of a prelate of the rank of archbishop.\n\nPrior to 1870, the pontifical hat was worn in solemn conclaves held in conjunction with papal functions. The color of the pontifical hat and the number and color of the tassels were signs of the rank of a prelate, a custom which is still preserved in ecclesiastical heraldry.\n\nThe entire “achievement,” or coat of arms as it is generally called, is composed of the shield with its charges, the motto and the external ornaments. As one looks at the shield the terms Dexter (right) and sinister (left) must be understood contrariwise, as the shield was worn on the arm in medieval days and these terms were used in the relationship of the one bearing the shield.\n\nThe dexter impalement is given in ecclesiastical heraldry to the arms of jurisdiction; in this instance, the arms of the Archdiocese of Atlanta.\n\nAtlanta known as the “Crossroads of the South,” because of converging railroads which gave the city its early prominence, received its name as the eastern terminus of the Western and Atlantic Railroad which connected north Georgia with the Tennessee River. Originally called Whitehall, then Terminus, and afterwards in 1843 Marthasville, the state legislature finally acquiesced to the wishes of the railroad and accepted the name of Atlanta in 1847, thus naming the city indirectly after the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean is represented on the shield of the archdiocese by white and blue wavy bars, the heraldic equivalent of the waves of the sea; seven bars in number to symbolize the Seven Sacraments.\n\nThe crown of Christ the King denotes the title of the cathedral church, the Eternal King whose redeeming Sacrifice on the Cross is renewed daily in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. Above the crown is placed the Cherokee rose, the State flower of Georgia (Rosa Laevigata), as befits an archdiocese located in the Capital City. The Cherokee rose is a white flower with a yellow center.\n\nThe crown of Christ the King, in the arms of the Archdiocese of Atlanta, also has the secondary representation of the crown of King George II of England after whom Georgia was named. The blue and white wavy bands may be said as well to symbolize the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge country; but, more important, these are the colors of our Blessed Mother.\n\nThe sinister impalement, on the right of the viewer, bears the personal arms of Archbishop Hallinan.\n\nThe arms of the Irish Hallinan family consist of a silver field emblazoned with a green oak tree, its roots exposed, and bearing a golden crown in the middle of the foliage. These arms have been “differenced” by the addition of a golden sword to honor Saint Paul, the baptismal patron of the archbishop, and by two red hearts, from the coat of arms of the revered Cardinal Newman, to honor the titular of the Newman Foundation of Western Reserve University, where the archbishop served as chaplain at the time of his elevation to the episcopacy.\n\nThe tree of the Hallinan arms has more than a passing interest inasmuch as the grandfather and father of the archbishop were both nurserymen.\n\nO’Hallinan is derived from the Gaelic “Hailgheanain,” variously spelled O’Hallinaine, O’Hallinan, Hallinan, Hallanan and Halnan, who are descendants of “Ailgheanan,” the diminutive of “Ailghean,” meaning “noble offspring.” It is an old Munster surname found chiefly in Cork and Limerick counties.\n\nThe motto, “Ut Diligatis Invicem” is translated “That you love one another.” The full text of this verse from the Gospel of Saint John reads: “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you” (15:12), a part of the discourse of Our Lord to the apostles at the Last Supper.\n\nBehind the arms is placed a gold archiepiscopal cross with double traverse, the mitre and the crosier. Surrounding the shield or “achievement,” is a pontifical hat with ten tassels on each side in four rows, all in green\n\nPrior to 1870, the pontifical hat was worn in solemn conclaves held in conjunction with papal functions. The color of the pontifical hat and the number and color of the tassels were signs of the rank of a prelate, a custom which is still preserved in ecclesiastical heraldry.\n\nThe entire “achievement,” or coat of arms as it is generally called, is composed of the shield with its charges, the motto and the external ornaments. As one looks at the shield the terms dexter (right) and sinister (left) must be understood contrariwise, as the shield was worn on the arm in medieval days and these terms were used in the relationship of the one bearing the shield.\n\nThe dexter impalement is given in ecclesiastical heraldry to the arms of jurisdiction; in this instance, the arms of the Diocese of Atlanta.\n\nAtlanta known as the “Crossroads of the South,” because of converging railroads which gave the city its early prominence, received its name as the eastern terminus of the Western and Atlantic Railroad which connected north Georgia with the Tennessee River. Originally called Whitehall, then Terminus, and afterwards in 1843 Marthasville, the state legislature finally acquiesced to the wishes of the railroad and accepted the name of Atlanta in 1847, thus naming the city indirectly after the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean is represented on the shield of the diocese by white and blue wavy bars, the heraldic equivalent of the waves of the sea; seven bars in number to symbolize the Seven Sacraments.\n\nThe crown of Christ the King denotes the title of the cathedral church, the Eternal King whose redeeming Sacrifice on the Cross is renewed daily in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. Above the crown is placed the Cherokee rose, the State flower of Georgia (Rosa Laevigata), as befits a diocese located in the Capital City. The Cherokee rose is a white flower with a yellow center.\n\nThe crown of Christ the King, in the arms of the Diocese of Atlanta, also has the secondary representation of the crown of King George II of England after whom Georgia was named. The blue and white wavy bands may be said as well to symbolize the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge country; but, more important, these are the colors of our Blessed Mother.\n\nThe sinister impalement, on the right of the viewer, bears the personal arms of Bishop Hyland.\n\nThe coat of arms is based on “faolan,” the Gaelic derivation of Hyland. “Faolan” is the diminutive of “faol” which means “wolf.” The name was common in the sixteenth century in Offaly and Leix, whence it spread into other parts of Ireland. Hyland is the usual form of the name in Leinster.\n\nConsequently, a wolf’s head erased (torn) is placed in the pronominal or paternal quarters, the first and the fourth. In these quarters there is also a reference to “McCarron,” the maiden name of Bishop Hyland’s mother. McCarron is derived from the Gaelic root “Ciar” meaning black, and the bishop has so tinctured there quarters to commemorate his mother on his episcopal escutcheon.\n\nThe silver cross and the two fleurs-de-lis have been abstracted from the second and third quarters of the coat of arms of Saint Francis de Sales to honor Bishop Hyland’s baptismal patron. The fleurs-de-lis are golden on the arms of Saint Francis, but they have been changed to silver in order that the colors of the Blessed Virgin Mary, blue and white (silver) might be displayed and that this distinction might constitute a brisure to make these Hyland arms particularly those of the bishop.\n\nThe motto “Ad Jesum Per Mariam,” is translated “To Jesus through Mary.”\n\nThe external ornaments are composed of the green pontifical hat with its six like-tinctured tassels on each side disposed in three rows, the mitre, the processional cross and the crosier, the latter in gold.\n\nPrior to 1870, the pontifical hat was worn in solemn conclaves held in conjunction with papal functions. The color of the pontifical hat and the number and color of the tassels were signs of the rank of a prelate, a custom which is still preserved in ecclesiastical heraldry."
