        "text": "It happened. I tried to stifle the laugh, but it was impossible. She was just too funny, too sassy, too real… St. Thérèse of Lisieux had literally made me laugh out loud in adoration. How embarrassingly awesome.\n\nEver since I was 14, St. Thérèse had been a “saint-buddy” of mine, but it was in a simple moment while reading Story of a Soul (Thérèse’s autobiography) that her journey to sainthood became real to me. Her sassy, stubborn-headed, emotional self had truly spoke to me in such a real and personal way. She spoke to me like a sister.\n\nThe saints, our teachers\n\nWhat an incredible gift we have in the communion of saints. The saints are like us! They are our ancestors, our teachers, our friends, our siblings. They are real, truly human. They are sinners, they are repentant children of God.\n\nThe saints lived on this earth and experienced suffering, joy, pain, broken promises, peace, frustration, war, injury, heartbreak… they know our hearts. But mostly, they know what it takes to be united with God here on this messy earth. They know what it takes to live well for Him.\n\nWhy a saint for Confirmation?\n\nWe choose a Confirmation saint (like we choose a Confirmation sponsor) not out of due diligence to the “rule,” but rather because we realize how unfortunate it would be to travel alone. We recognize how important it is to know your Confirmation saint not only by name, but also by story. The saints have so much to teach us about this journey.\n\nThe following list is for you to use as a starting point in your journey to decide whom your “Confirmation saint-buddy” will be. Pick a saint (canonized, blessed, or servant of God) who speaks to you somehow. Know their story. But, mostly know the power of their prayer. Ask for their intercession like you would ask for the prayers of your friends. Saying “yes” to a Confirmation saint is like saying “yes, you may always pray for my poor and weary soul.”\n\nHow fantastic is that!? I pray that in this process you don’t just find a Confirmation saint, but instead an incredible friend.\n\nSo, here it rolls… the list to top all lists. Happy picking!\n\nSaints who I’m pretty sure were actually superheroes\n\nNo, their “superpowers” weren’t designed by fancy machinery or alien power. They were simply receptive to the mighty power of God. These saints stories are incredibly heroic.\n\nSt. Mary, the Mother of God\n\nSt. Denis\n\nSt. George Martyr\n\nSt. Joan of Arc\n\nSt. Joseph Cupertino\n\nSt. Louis IX\n\nSt. Margaret of Antioch\n\nSt. Maximilian Kolbe\n\nBl.

Whew, that’s not only impressive, but beautiful. We have a lot to learn from these modern saints.\n\nVenerable Augustus Tolton\n\nSt. André Bessette\n\nServant of God Chiara Corbella Petrillo\n\nServant of God Dorothy Day\n\nSt. Gianna\n\nSt. Jaime Hilario Barbal\n\nSt. John XXIII\n\nSt. John Paul II\n\nSt. Josemaria Escriva\n\nSt. Josephine Bakhita\n\nSt. Katharine Drexel\n\nSt. Luigi Orione\n\nSt. Maria Bernard Butler\n\nSt. Maria Faustina Kowalska\n\nSt. Mary MacKillop\n\nSt. Mother Teresa\n\nSt. Óscar Romero\n\nSt. Pauline of the Suffering Heart of Jesus\n\nSt. Pius X\n\nSt. Riccardo Pampuri\n\nBl. Sára Salkaházi\n\nSt. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross\n\nServant of God Thea Bowman\n\nSaints who are Doctors of the Church\n\nNo, we’re not talking about Dr. Strange or Dr. Meredith Grey, but rather physicians of the theology of the Church. Men and women who, through their own intense study and reflection, have given the Church great wisdom and insight.\n\nSt. Albert the Great\n\nSt. Alphonsus Liguori\n\nSt. Ambrose\n\nSt. Anselm of Canterbury\n\nSt. Anthony of Padua\n\nSt. Athanasius\n\nSt. Augustine\n\nSt. Basil the Great\n\nSt. Bede the Venerable\n\nSt. Bernard of Clairvaux\n\nSt. Bonaventure\n\nSt. Catherine of Siena\n\nSt. Cyril of Alexandria\n\nSt. Cyril of Jerusalem\n\nSt. Ephrem the Syrian\n\nSt. Francis de Sales\n\nSt. Gregory of Narek\n\nSt. Gregory the Great\n\nSt. Gregory of Nazianzus\n\nSt. Hilary of Poitiers\n\nSt. Hildegard of Bingen\n\nSt. Isidore of Seville\n\nSt. John Chrysostom\n\nSt. John of Ávila\n\nSt. John of Damascus\n\nSt. John of the Cross\n\nSt. Jerome\n\nSt. Lawrence of Brindisi\n\nSt. Leo I, the Great\n\nSt. Peter Chrysologus\n\nSt. Peter Damian\n\nSt. Peter Canisius\n\nSt. Robert Bellarmine\n\nSt. Thérèse of Lisieux\n\nSt. Teresa of Ávila\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas\n\nSaints with a really cool conversion story\n\nGod works wonders in our lives in small and hidden ways, but sometimes His wonders are loud. These saints experienced a profound conversion that really shaped their life in tremendous ways.\n\nSt. Augustine of Hippo (also a doctor of the Church)\n\nSt. Francis of Assisi\n\nSt. Genesius\n\nSt. Ignatius of Loyola\n\nBl. Imelda Lambertini\n\nSt. Longinus\n\nSt. Mary Magdalene\n\nSt. Moses the Black\n\nSt. Paul the Apostle\n\nSt. Vladimir of Kiev\n\nSaints with names your bishop might have trouble pronouncing\n\n… cause (don’t lie) that would be really funny. But also, their names aren’t the only rad thing about these saints; check out their stories!\n\nSt. Alphonsa Muttathupadathu\n\nSt. Benedicta Hyon Kyongnyon\n\nSt. Ceolwulf of Northumbria\n\nSt. John Chrysostom\n\nSt. Kateri Tekakwitha\n\nSt. Quadragesimus\n\nBl. Volodymyr Pryjma\n\nBl. Zepherin Namuncura\n\nSt. Zygmunt Gorazdowski\n\nSaints who reached sanctity before the age of 25\n\nMost of these saints were younger than you when they reached sainthood. What’s your excuse?\n\nSt. Agnes\n\nSt. Aloysius Gonzaga\n\nSt. Aquilina\n\nBl. Carlo Acutis\n\nSt. Charles Lwanga\n\nBl. Chiara Luce Badano\n\nSt. Dominic Savio\n\nBl. Francisco Marto\n\nSt. Gemma Galgani\n\nBl. Jacinta Marto\n\nSt. José Sánchez del Rio\n\nSt. Lucy\n\nSt. Maria Goretti\n\nSt. Perpetua\n\nSt. Philomena\n\nBl. Pier Giorgio Frassati\n\nSt. Tarcisius\n\nSaints to invoke if you need prayers for a very specific intention\n\nA saint is way more than their patronage, but sometimes we just need a saint in our lives who can pray for us in a particular way.\n\nFor abuse victims – St. Monica\n\nFor adopted children – St. Thomas More\n\nFor artists – St. Catherine of Bologna\n\nFor athletes – St. Sebastian\n\nFor altar servers – St. John Berchmans\n\nFor bakers – St. Nicholas\n\nFor Christian mothers – St. Anne\n\nFor earaches – St. Polycarp\n\nFor fisherman – St. Andrew\n\nFor friendships – St. John the Evangelist\n\nFor farmers and rural communities – St. Isidore the Farmer\n\nFor “hopeless causes” – St. Jude Thaddeus\n\nFor hunters – St. Hubert\n\nFor headaches – St. Teresa of Ávila (also a doctor of the Church\n\nFor musicians – St. Cecilia\n\nFor physicians – St. Luke\n\nFor the poor – St. Lawrence\n\nFor protection from fire – St. Agatha of Sicily\n\nFor those too sick to care for themselves – St. Roch\n\nFor sore eyes – St. Clare of Assisi\n\nFor speakers and philosophers – St. Justin Martyr\n\nFor those who struggle with doubt – St. Thomas the Doubter\n\nFor students – St. John Bosco and St. Benedict\n\nFor the universal Church and fathers – St. Joseph\n\nFor those suffering nervous and mental afflictions – St. Dymphna\n\nFor toothaches – St. Apollonia\n\nFor travelers – St. Christopher\n\nBy no means is this a complete list of the saints. If it was, it would totally be way more overwhelming than helpful. But, I pray you have found your “saint-buddy” on this page. If not, I pray you will soon, for the saints truly are our greatest friends and advocates. They are our family!\n\nEditor’s Note: Much of what we know about the lives of Catholic saints has been passed down throughout history in the form of record keeping and tradition. Some saints (such as St. Thérèse of Lisieux) have volumes of primary documents that detail their lives, others (such as the early Roman martyrs) are more legend than true. However, each saint’s rich history is monumental in the ways in which their intercession has lifted up Catholics throughout the ages. That being said, each linked website is only a starting point to the rich documentation on each saint. While we’ve done our best to link reputable sources, it is always a good idea when researching anything to consult more than one source.\n\nFor more information on Catholic saints and their stories, check out 100 SAINTS EVERY CATHOLIC TEEN SHOULD KNOW."
