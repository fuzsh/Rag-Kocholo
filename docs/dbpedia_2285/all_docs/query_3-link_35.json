        "text": "-“Christ embracing St Bernard“, by Francisco Ribalta, ca 1625-1627.\n\nWhile a Dominican novice, right after college, I was assigned to write a report on St Bernard of Clairvaux. I know him better now. I hope you appreciate him, too.\n\nWhen the subject of the Crusades comes up in cocktail party conversation, as it oft tends to do…just kidding. But, seriously, some “enlightened” moderns, injecting the cardinal sin of presentism into their study of history, say, “You Christians! Specifically, you Catholics! How could you? How dare you?”\n\nBeing the devil’s gadfly, I like to respond, calmly, after a brief pause so all can recapture their breath, “Imagine if today, a Christian army, as if that could occur today, were to invade Saudi Arabia and capture and hold, without ever the prospect of likely leaving, the holy cities of Mecca & Medina, such that Muslims might likely be denied access to two of their holiest shrines, and the pilgrimage to one a central tenet of their faith? What would the reaction of the Muslim world be? Not to pick on the Muslim world, it’s just that example might most clearly demonstrate my point for me that human nature and its inevitable reactions, even in our modern, “enlightened” world might not be that unique to Christians or, specifically, Catholics.\n\nMan of the century! Woman of the century! You see such terms applied to so many today—“golfer of the century,” “composer of the century,” “right tackle of the century”—that the line no longer has any punch. But the “man of the twelfth century,” without doubt or controversy, has to be Bernard of Clairvaux. Adviser of popes, preacher of the Second Crusade, defender of the faith, healer of a schism, reformer of a monastic Order, Scripture scholar, theologian and eloquent preacher: any one of these titles would distinguish an ordinary man. Yet Bernard was all of these—and he still retained a burning desire to return to the hidden monastic life of his younger days.\n\nIn the year 1111, at the age of 20, Bernard left his home to join the monastic community of Citeaux. His five brothers, two uncles and some 30 young friends followed him into the monastery. Within four years a dying community had recovered enough vitality to establish a new house in the nearby valley of Wormwoods, with Bernard as abbot. The zealous young man was quite demanding, though more on himself than others. A slight breakdown of health taught him to be more patient and understanding. The valley was soon renamed Clairvaux, the valley of light.\n\nHis ability as arbitrator and counselor became widely known. More and more he was lured away from the monastery to settle long-standing disputes. On several of these occasions he apparently stepped on some sensitive toes in Rome. Bernard was completely dedicated to the primacy of the Roman See. But to a letter of warning from Rome he replied that the good fathers in Rome had enough to do to keep the Church in one piece. If any matters arose that warranted their interest, he would be the first to let them know.\n\nShortly thereafter it was Bernard who intervened in a full-blown schism and settled it in favor of the Roman pontiff against the antipope.\n\nThe Holy See prevailed on Bernard to preach the Second Crusade throughout Europe. His eloquence was so overwhelming that a great army was assembled and the success of the crusade seemed assured. The ideals of the men and their leaders, however, were not those of Abbot Bernard, and the project ended as a complete military and moral disaster.\n\nBernard felt responsible in some way for the degenerative effects of the crusade. This heavy burden possibly hastened his death, which came August 20, 1153.\n\nBernard’s life in the Church was more active than we can imagine possible today. His efforts produced far-reaching results. But he knew that they would have availed little without the many hours of prayer and contemplation that brought him strength and heavenly direction. His life was characterized by a deep devotion to the Blessed Mother. His sermons and books about Mary are still the standard of Marian theology.\n\n“Wherefore, O Eve, hasten to Mary; hasten, O Mother, to your daughter. Let the daughter answer for the mother; let her take away her mother’s reproach; let her satisfy also for her father Adam, for if he fell by a woman, behold, he is now raised up by a woman. God gave a woman in exchange for a woman; a prudent woman for one that was foolish; a humble woman for one who was proud; one who, instead of the fruit of death, shall give you to eat of the tree of life, and who, in place of the poisoned food of bitterness, will bring forth the fruit of everlasting sweetness.” -St Bernard of Clairvaux\n\n“In dangers, in doubts, in difficulties, think of Mary, call upon Mary. Let not her name depart from your lips, never suffer it to leave your heart. And that you may more surely obtain the assistance of her prayer, neglect not to walk in her footsteps. With her for guide, you shall never go astray; while invoking her, you shall never lose heart; so long as she is in your mind, you are safe from deception; while she holds your hand, you cannot fall; under her protection you have nothing to fear; if she walks before you, you shall not grow weary; if she shows you favor, you shall reach the goal” -St Bernard of Clairvaux\n\n“No misery is more genuine than false joy.” –St Bernard of Clairvaux\n\nRun, hasten, O Lady,\n\nand in your mercy help your sinful servant,\n\nwho calls upon you,\n\nand deliver them from the hands of the enemy.\n\nWho will not sigh to you?\n\nWe sigh with love and grief,\n\nfor we are oppressed on every side.\n\nHow can we do other than sigh to you,\n\nO solace of the miserable,\n\nrefuge of outcasts,\n\nransom of captives?\n\nWe are certain that when you see our miseries,\n\nyour compassion will hasten to relieve us.\n\nO our Sovereign Lady and our Advocate,\n\ncommend us to your Son.\n\n– Saint Bernard of Clairvaux\n\n“Let us not imagine that we obscure the glory of the Son by the great praise we lavish on the Mother; for the more she is honored, the greater is the glory of her Son. There can be no doubt that whatever we say in praise of the Mother gives equal praise to the Son.”\n\n–St. Bernard of Clairvaux\n\n“God loves, He desires nothing else than to be loved; for He loves only that He may be loved.” -St Bernard of Clairvaux\n\n“The life of Christ has furnished me with a pattern for living; but His death has delivered me from death.”\n\n— St. Bernard\n\n“We find rest in those we love, and we provide a resting place for those who love us.”\n\n–St. Bernard of Clairvaux\n\n“Thus understanding and love, that is, the knowledge of and delight in the truth, are, as it were, the two arms of the soul, with which it embraces and comprehends with all the saints the length and breath, the height and depth, that is the eternity, the love, the goodness, and the wisdom of God.”\n\n–St. Bernard of Clairvaux\n\n“But you, know by experience that our cross is truly full of unction, whereby it is not only light, but all the bitterness and hardship we find in our state is, by the grace of God, rendered sweet and pleasant.”\n\n-St. Bernard of Clairvaux\n\n“We are to love God for Himself, because of a twofold reason; nothing is more reasonable, nothing more profitable.”\n\n-St. Bernard of Clairvaux\n\n“I believe though I do not comprehend, and I hold by faith what I cannot grasp with the mind.”\n\n-St. Bernard\n\n“Mary is the happy ark, in which those who take refuge will never suffer the shipwreck of eternal perdition.”\n\n-St. Bernard of Clairveaux\n\n“In the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I trust. Look to the Star, call upon Mary! In danger, in difficulty or in doubt, think of Mary, call upon Mary. Keep her name on your lips, never let it pass out of your heart.”\n\n-St. Bernard of Clairvaux\n\n“And so the idea of peace came down to do the work of peace: The Word was made flesh and even now dwells among us. It is by faith that he dwells in our hearts, in our memory, our intellect and penetrates even into our imagination. What concept could man have of God if he did not first fashion an image of him in his heart? By nature incomprehensible and inaccessible, he was invisible and unthinkable, but now he wished to be understood, to be seen and thought of. But how, you ask, was this done? He lay in a manger and rested on a virgin’s breast, preached on a mountain, and spent the night in prayer. He hung on a cross, grew pale in death, and roamed free among the dead and ruled over those in hell. He rose again on the third day, and showed the apostles the wounds of the nails, the signs of victory; and finally in their presence he ascended to the sanctuary of heaven. How can we not contemplate this story in truth, piety and holiness?”\n\n—St. Bernard of Clairvaux\n\n“Look to the star of the sea, call upon Mary . . . in danger, in distress, in doubt, think of Mary, call upon Mary. May her name never be far from your lips, or far from your heart . . . If you follow her, you will not stray; if you pray to her, you will not despair; if you turn your thoughts to her, you will not err. If she holds you, you will not fall; if she protects you, you need not fear; if she is your guide, you will not tire; if she is gracious to you, you will surely reach your destination.”\n\n-St Bernard of Clairvaux"
