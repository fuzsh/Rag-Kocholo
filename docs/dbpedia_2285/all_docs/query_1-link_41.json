        "text": "Today’s gospel reading takes place on an ordinary Sabbath just like today. There is a woman attending services at a synagogue somewhere in Galilee or Judea who is bent over from some sort of physical ailment that has been with her for 18 years. Jesus, as a respected rabbi, is teaching in the synagogue that day and he notices her. She may have gone unnoticed in her village after all those years of infirmity; people were used to the way she looked. But Jesus notices her. Without any fanfare he lays his hands on her and we are told that the woman stood straight. The original Greek serves us better; it says “she was straightened” emphasizing the fact that it was God who cured her.\n\nHer response is immediate – she begins to praise and thank God. Again, the Greek helps us to understand the context better – the imperfect tense indicates that this wasn’t a one time “thank you God” but the beginning of praise and thanks that may have lasted her entire life. Imagine how the woman feels – she no longer has to look down and see only feet, she can look at people’s faces and into their eyes. Once easily overlooked, she is now able to participate fully in the life of her community. With her health restored, she is able to see that God is responsible for her healing and being a woman of faith she responds with her thanks and praise. Vision is an important theme in Luke and here Jesus sees the woman who is in need of healing and by curing her he restores her ability to see God’s love.\n\nWhat a great Sabbath story. Who among us would not appreciate coming to worship and experiencing the healing of some ill, whether that of another person or perhaps our own. I know that healing of various kinds has taken place on the Sabbath right here in this place and no doubt in many churches and temples, usually in a less dramatic and more personal fashion. For us such an event on the Sabbath brings great joy. But our gospel indicates a different response to Jesus’ healing on the Sabbath. A leader of the synagogue begins to denounce him, proclaiming for all to hear that there are six other days in the week when people should seek healing, but the Sabbath is reserved as a day of no work.\n\nTo us that seems ridiculous – as Jesus explained, when we see suffering we must respond to it, Sabbath or not. But the various Jewish denominations of Jesus’ day continually argued about the law and its application, and what constituted work on the Sabbath was one of many disputed topics. The ambiguity about work on the Sabbath appears in several places in the gospels, but the concept of healing as breaking the Sabbath law is probably the most difficult for us to accept. Today, Orthodox Jews who are first responders or in the medical profession are given dispensation to work on the Sabbath.\n\nOur lesson for today from the Book of Isaiah takes place after the Jewish people have returned to Jerusalem from their long exile in Babylon. Jerusalem had been rebuilt and a wall built around it, both for protection and also to create a sacred space where the practices of Judaism could be revived. They were struggling with their relationships with God and with their neighbor. Many were not honoring the Sabbath, and the wealthy were neglecting or even oppressing the poor. In the first creation story in Genesis, God created the world for six days but on the seventh day, God did not show up for work, thereby creating the Sabbath. The Hebrew word for Sabbath means “stop” and that is what we are to do, to stop our ordinary work and preoccupations and take time first to worship and thank God and then to enjoy some leisure time.\n\nToday we are like those ancient Jews, we have become workaholics and we do not always honor a Sabbath. This is true of both Christians and Jews. That is something we can admire and emulate from Orthodox Judaism, the insistence on honoring the Sabbath. In many Jewish temples of all denominations there is an invitation to Oneg Shabbat in the service bulletin, a time following the service for refreshments and fellowship. Oneg Shabbat means Sabbath delight. We call that “coffee hour,” the time all the children look forward to during worship when we connect with one another on a more personal basis. A lot of plans for ministry and for helping or socializing with our friends happen during that time of refreshment following worship.\n\nSo we have a double message in our readings for today, both relevant and timely. We need to obey the third commandment to “Honor the Sabbath Day and keep it holy.” We, like the woman Jesus healed, should have the vision to see that all we have is from God, so it is important to offer our praise and thanks. Second, because like religious people throughout history, we go through phases when the Sabbath is diminished or ignored. In the early days of our country it was a civil law to keep the Sabbath. In some colonies, particularly in New England, all were required to attend worship services, which often lasted for most of the day. Meals were prepared the day before, so there was minimal cooking on the Sabbath. Fines were imposed on those who did not obey the law.\n\nIn the mid twentieth century the musician Duke Ellington wrote a beautiful composition called “Come Sunday.” He originally wrote it for an opera, which told of the plight of the African American people in the south. They were overworked and underpaid. But they were allowed to gather and sing and worship each Sunday. The refrain of the song is “But Sunday, that’s the day I’m waiting for…” At that period in history even the oppressed were permitted Sabbath rest, but today people of all different occupations are often expected to be on call 24/7. That is not good for anyone’s spiritual, mental or physical well-being. A teacher once described his busy life, “It was one of those nights when I was lying awake in my bed, babysitting the world.” How sad that he couldn’t relax and trust God to watch over things for one night!\n\nAlthough Jesus always honored the Sabbath, he also taught by both word and example that there are times when it is permissible, even necessary; to perform what might be termed as “work.” If we see someone in distress, it is necessary that we help them immediately, no matter the circumstances. That’s what so many do not understand, and even seem to reject – that the nature of God is mercy, grace, and love, and that is to be our nature.\n\nOur way has to be a different way. We have to believe that our way is a different way and to speak and act accordingly. The world needs to see that the ways of the church mean we are ready and willing to heal even on the Sabbath. We have to stand for mercy, grace, love and justice at all times for the sake of those who are suffering, marginalized or oppressed. We have to make it possible for them to be able to stand straight and proud as fellow children of God. When our vision is clear and we can see the ways of God, then we will inspire and enable others to share that vision. Amen.\n\nAuthor Elizabeth Palmer recalls the time she heard The Rev. Gordon Lathrop preach on our gospel text for today. His voice trembled as he said; “Our Lord Jesus Christ is not tame, not nice,” and then he paraphrased Jesus’ words: “I have come to bring fire to this earth.” Pastor Lathrop is an icon in the Lutheran church – an expert on all things liturgical; he was for many years Professor of Liturgy at the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, he is a celebrated author and a respected preacher. He was able to make his voice capture the seriousness with which Jesus must have spoken those words to his disciples. After all, what kind of savior and redeemer would bring division and would cause strife in families?\n\nIt seems that fire is a dangerous image for Jesus to use, even if he doesn’t mean it literally. We know the danger and aftermath of fire, but people in the first century would have experienced it firsthand, with the constant proximity of open fires and the lack of effective medical care for burn victims. Jesus’ voice must have trembled when he made those declarations. But Jesus wasn’t the first to use that imagery. The prophet Jeremiah proclaimed – “Is not my word like fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?”\n\nThe concept of placing our trust in a God who brings fire and acts like a hammer does not sound very comforting or even appealing. But, as we might anticipate, God does not use these fierce and frightening images for our destruction but to destroy evil and clear the way for justice and mercy. God wants to destroy the structures and institutions of society that are harmful instead of helpful to people. In Jesus’ day some used their religious beliefs as a way of “guaranteeing” their salvation, yet, ironically that actually distanced people from God. That is still true today, when religious beliefs are used to divide and persecute people instead of bringing us together as one family in God. Jesus says his fire will destroy our need to look for security from human institutions instead of finding our security in God.\n\nThe next portion of Jesus’ proclamation is equally difficult to hear. He talks about our relationships and how sometimes they can be broken and families can be divided. In his day the controversy about his ministry caused divisions in families and communities. Some became loyal followers, others were intrigued by his teaching and still others felt threatened by him. As the gospel spread some families were torn apart, a reality that has continued throughout history. Arguments over religious differences have divided families, communities, even countries. Our own denomination was formed out of division between Martin Luther and the Roman Catholic Church. Ireland has a long history of bloodshed between Protestants and Roman Catholics. People came to America in search of religious freedom but in some colonies once they established their denomination they excluded and sometimes even persecuted others. The good news is that at our annual Churchwide assembly this past week, the ELCA voted to approve Declaration on the Way a new document that seeks to draw Lutherans and Roman Catholics closer together.\n\nIn many families and friendships there are differences – political, religious, economic or social. Often those differences are simmering tensions just under the surface and people can navigate their relationships without those differences erupting into fights. But sometimes people just can’t tolerate the opinions or actions of others and the result is division. An example of that can be found in seminaries. If you visit and meet the students, you will inevitably find at least a few who are answering the call to ministry in spite of the lack of support from family and/or friends. Some people think it is crazy to give up more lucrative opportunities to serve the church. Sometimes people are afraid that the responsibilities of ordained ministry will take the seminarian away from them. I was accused by some people of abandoning my immediate family, even though the decision to attend seminary was made with their support.\n\nThe last section of our text illustrates our need for control, where Jesus addresses our inability to realize what’s really happening around us concerning Christ and God. The word used is “hypocrites” but Jesus is really talking about those who can read the signs of the past and future, but can’t figure out the “present time.” That isn’t exactly hypocrisy, but is more a lack of vision. The label of hypocrite makes sense if we say we believe that Jesus brings salvation through grace, but we insist on works righteousness, working to achieve our own salvation. Or, if we believe that we have a monopoly on the truth about ourselves and our world. We delude ourselves into thinking we have everything figured out, that we can always be in control.\n\nThis accusation of hypocrisy by Jesus is meant to encourage us to consider how we live out life in the church and the world. Are we open to hearing and responding to God’s call for justice, or are we complacent and ignore all the injustice that is around us? It is true that sometimes fighting injustice can cause division, but Jesus calls us to trust that God is at work in all situations, and to remember that God has claimed us as beloved children, not because we are perfect but because of God’s pure gift of grace. In spite of the harshness of our gospel for today, it still reflects the good news that we have faith in a God who maintains a close, personal and caring relationship with us, one that is so close that we can bear some criticism and correction. God is not far off in the distance, merely observing, but God’s Holy Spirit is active in our lives, helping to destroy those things that cause division and empowering us to work for justice and mercy in the world. Amen.\n\nOur texts for today are a treasure trove of beautiful sayings that help us define who we are and what our faith means to us. One of my favorites is from our gospel text, “For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” As Erick Thompson, senior pastor of Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, New Prague, Minnesota explains, “We live in a world where there are so many things clamoring for our attention that it is easy to lose our focus. In this text from Luke, Jesus is calling us to prioritize activities that give eternal life. Such a call to center (or re-center) our lives on God, might seem extremely difficult in our world, but is essential for our lives as Christians. If we don’t, as Jesus goes on to suggest, we will be caught unprepared.”\n\nWe often equate treasure with money or possessions. Last week we learned in our gospel reading that Jesus advised us how we should effectively share our treasure. He never said we should not have what we need to live, but it is the excess that we have to learn how to use wisely. Otherwise we will end up like the rich man, who built bigger barns to store all of his treasure and ended up dying. Instead of making good use of the crops and other valuables he had accumulated, he tried to store them up so he would get pleasure from having them. His treasure turned out to be a fleeting moment in time. If he had shared his bounty of crops and other valuables – which Pastor Thompson calls a “strategic appropriation of one’s possessions” – he could have left a legacy of generosity and kindness; instead he died surrounded by all his stuff.\n\nAfter offering advice about treasure, Jesus speaks about being prepared. This part of the reading sounds as though we are in Advent. Being ready for the coming of Christ is the main theme of Advent, but it is appropriate for all seasons of the Christian life. Sometimes the exhortation to be prepared creates anxiety. But Pastor Thompson offers a wonderful explanation in his commentary this week in the online resource, Working Preacher. He insists that this text is about vocation, not justification. It is not a simple declaration of “be prepared and you will be saved,” which could lead to a certain amount of anxiety. He says that the “idea here is to be ready so that when God calls [us] to action, [we] seize the opportunity and spread the good news.” And here is the part that I think is a brilliant explanation of that call to be prepared, “Being alert and being ready are like potential energy, ready to be turned into kinetic energy when prompted. The energy produced here is gospel centered: healing, justice, love, grace, peace, etc.”\n\nThen Thompson goes on to explain what will happen when we are prepared. It turns out that we will be served by God. That is comforting, because we spend a lot of time thinking about how we should serve God, how we should direct that kinetic, gospel centered energy Thompson speaks of. As Lutherans we reject any notion of works righteousness – that is, we do good works, or serve God, in order to be saved. We believe we are justified by grace through faith – first we are saved by the pure grace of God and then our response is to do good works. That is the promise of what will happen when we re-center life around God – the good news of Christ will serve us in our lives so that we are not afraid.\n\nOur first lesson offers an example of that beautiful promise from God. Abram – who was later called Abraham – has no children, no one to whom he can leave his worldly possessions. In the ancient world, one’s status was determined by their family and tribe. Although today it is common for people who marry to want to have a family, they are not considered to be a disgrace if for some reason they do not have children. In Abram’s time, it was considered essential to have an heir, particularly a male, and if a couple was childless it was normally blamed on the wife. Women were ashamed to be barren, even though the inability to have a child with their husband might not even be their fault.\n\nAbram, even though he was not perfect, he made mistakes, was a man who was faithful to God. He did not serve God with the expectation that God would save him; he had faith in God and so God saved him. God promised him that his descendants would number more than the stars in the sky, and Abram believed God, even though he and his wife Sarah were both beyond their childbearing years. The author of our second lesson from Hebrews puts it rather bluntly – God gave Abraham and Sarah the power to have a child, even though, as he puts it, Abraham was as “good as dead” because God knew that they were faithful. Throughout his life Abraham obeyed God, trusting that God would keep the promises made to him.\n\nAnd so we come to that other beautiful saying from our second lesson, “Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen…By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible.” Even though at times it may be challenging, at times we may doubt or feel afraid, we are assured that everything is based on our willingness to trust in God. That is what we call faith. We have to accept a certain amount of mystery – as the Christmas preface states –“You have opened the eyes of faith to a new and radiant vision of your glory, that beholding the God made visible we may be drawn to the love the God whom we cannot see.” If we can trust in God’s promises, even though we may experience disappointments in life, ultimately we will not be disappointed by God.\n\nWe should not oversimplify, but often we make faith more complicated than it really is. Where is our true treasure? It is where our hearts are. Not in possessions or power or status, but rooted in the love of God, of family, of loved ones, of all the creatures of God’s beautiful creation. We don’t have what could be considered scientific proof of the object of our faith, but we have the promises handed down through the generations, from ancient times through today. From our patriarchs and matriarchs in the faith like Abraham and Sarah, through those who, centuries later, were willing to risk their lives to tell the story of the good news of Jesus Christ. There are role models for faith to be found in every generation. They are countless, like the stars in the sky and the grains of sand on the seashore. Our “faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.” As our ancestors before us, we are not perfect and we never will be. But together we will have the courage to trust in God’s promises. Amen.\n\nAll of our readings for this Sunday concern the goals we have in life. The author of Ecclesiastes was a teacher who possessed much wisdom. So it seems a little surprising that he had hoped to discover in his busyness and wealth something that would satisfy his longing for purpose and meaning, and it is most astonishing that he thought his achievements in life might delay his death. So often that is the human story: we tire ourselves out by being endlessly busy in a hopeless effort to find lasting satisfaction, security and happiness. But our usual means of trying to achieve those worthy goals are described as vanity, which in Hebrew means they are short-lived or transitory. And, as Jesus points out in his parable in our gospel reading, death has the final say for all of us. All of our attempts to ward off despair, fear and death by accumulating possessions or power are doomed to fail from the start.\n\nToday’s lessons are a reminder of that for which our hearts long can never be satisfied with ceaseless busyness, self-indulgence and/or over consumption. President Jimmy Carter offered these words on the subject in his July 1979 speech entitled Crisis of Confidence: “Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns. But we’ve discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning. We’ve learned that piling up material goods cannot fill the emptiness of lives which have no confidence or purpose.”\n\nThat all sounds kind of depressing. Should we just give up, give in, just go along and accept things? Our second reading from Colossians offers a better alternative. If we find ourselves caught up in an endless and unsatisfying treadmill of being busy just to accumulate possessions or power or status, we should turn to Christ as the center of our lives. We can accept that our glory is not in our possessions, our work or status. We must also accept that death is inevitable. However, with Christ as our guide, we can accomplish much in life which will serve as a legacy for those who follow us, and our attitude towards death can be one of eternal hope.\n\nIn our gospel, Jesus refuses to engage in a conversation with the man who wanted him to tell his brother to share the family inheritance. Instead he uses that question to advise the crowd listening to him to “be on guard against all kinds of greed, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.” Then he goes on to tell the parable about the rich man. The point that Jesus was trying to get across was not that we shouldn’t contribute to our retirement fund for the future. If we don’t save for the future we will become one of the poor who need help. Jesus was offering guidance us as to what would be the best use for the wealth we accumulate.\n\nThe rich man is curved in on himself. He even conducts conversations with himself. There is no sense of community in his thought process, no thought of generosity or even any consideration of others who might be in need and could benefit from all the wealth he has accumulated. He doesn’t even consider God, who blessed him with such abundance in life and who has special intentions for all of us. Instead, on his own, he comes to the conclusion that he should build even larger barns to store his many possessions.\n\nThe rich man’s story is not about saving sensibly for retirement, or holding on to those things which have meaning for us. This is about accumulation of wealth just for the sake of having it. People who downsize to a smaller home go through the often difficult process of weeding out which possessions to keep and which to let go of. This guy is upsizing to bigger and better storage units!\n\nCommentator Karoline Lewis tells about her Baby Bjorn (a sling-type of baby carrier) which she has not been able to let go of even though her sons are almost 17 and 15. She has loaned it out to many people but has always asked for it back. Her first son was premature and spent a long time being carried in the Baby Bjorn, which provided him with a safe cocoon. As Lewis puts it, her second son rode in it as an infant but he was the kind of baby who seemed ready to ride a skateboard by the time he was a year old. The Baby Bjorn is a treasured possession because she associates it with her sons. Such treasured possessions can be kept and even handed down to the next generation. That is not the same as having a lot of possessions just for the sake of accumulating them, even though we may think they give us pleasure. We often find that pleasure is short lived or transitory.\n\nAn equally important, point that Jesus was making is that we cannot escape death. Accumulating wealth or becoming powerful or famous will not hold off death, as we know from the many celebrities and wealthy people who die seemingly before their time. The lesson Jesus offers is that if we live a life of hope, we will not only be more content while we are alive, we will leave a lasting legacy for those who follow. The latest issue of the Bellmore Herald Life newspaper shares a story about Bernard and Michael Otterman; a father and son who are working together on a project to bring educators from across the Middle East to Hiroshima, Japan, to raise the awareness of the dangers of nuclear war.\n\nBernard is a Holocaust survivor, one of the few who, at the age of two years, survived the concentration camps with both his parents. A brother was born two years later, and the family came to the United States in 1951. He earned a degree in engineering and became the chairman of Hofstra University’s engineering and computer science department. In 1979 he joined his brother Harry, an accountant, in managing their parents’ real estate holding company. But Bernard was not content to amass wealth. He and his wife created the nonprofit Bernard & Sandra Otterman Foundation to work towards world peace. Their son Michael, who is a former intern and reporter at Bellmore and Merrick Herald, as well as a nonprofit speech writer and publicist, has joined the family business so he can manage the foundation.\n\nThe foundation is focusing on educators from the Middle East, which is where Bernard thinks a nuclear attack is most likely to occur because of the instability of the region. The first dozen teachers will be sent to Hiroshima from August 2-9 to learn about the power and the risk to humanity posed by nuclear weapons. They will be meeting atomic bomb survivors and disarmament experts from around the world in the hope that they can incorporate what they learn into the curriculum they teach in their own countries. The foundation hopes to continue the forum for the next 5-10 years, bringing the educators to either Hiroshima or Nagasaki.\n\nIn spite of the fact that he witnessed the horrors of the Holocaust, Bernard did not become bitter. On the contrary, he has lived a life of hope and now he and his family are using the wealth they have accumulated to leave a legacy of hope for peace in the world. The project is called the Middle East Oleander Initiative, after the bright red flowers that bloomed in a patch of radioactive ash in Hiroshima. Bernard says that after his time on earth is complete, “Hopefully others will pick up the ball and run with it.” That is a worthy and hopeful legacy, much better than possessions left to accumulate in ever larger barns. Amen.\n\nOur first reading and gospel text are both about hospitality and its importance in the lives of God’s people. Hospitality was a highly valued and widely practiced custom in the ancient world, especially in the Middle East. Hosts were expected to provide food, shelter, amenities, and protection to traveling strangers, who, as in our first lesson, sometimes turned out to be messengers from God traveling incognito. The author of Hebrews tells us that we may entertain angels unawares. In Greek culture, which had a significant influence on the ancient world, Zeus was celebrated as the god of hospitality, and the practice of hospitality was one of the things that separated high Greek civilization from the “barbarians.” Often stories depicting hospitality ended with the host bestowing gifts upon the guest. Jewish examples of hospitality abound in Hebrew scripture; and in the New Testament Luke displays a particular interest in issues of hospitality both in his gospel and the Book of Acts.\n\nAs Mikeal C. Parsons, who is Professor and Kidd L. and Buna Hitchock Macon Chair of Religion at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, explains: ‘The ethic of hospitality as depicted by Luke provides a solid foundation for Christian habits and practices within the community, where we have unlimited responsibilities to our fellow believers, but also with the world, where we are called to offer hospitality to those unlike us in culture, ethnicity or religion, as well as to offer assistance to those in immediate crisis. Christians are called to extend hospitality both as hosts and guests, and to fellow believers and non-believers alike.’\n\nHospitality is still very important to us today. We extend hospitality in our homes to our friends and families, and here at church to all who are present. The hospitality of coffee hour, the breakfasts and special meals we share, are very important to our sense of being community. For those who volunteer at the I.N.N. or the New Life food pantry, a feeling of welcome and hospitality is extended to the guests. We practice the ancient Christian virtue of hospitality, we do not simply tolerate or endure people who might not be exactly like us; we engage and interact with them, whether we are guest or host.\n\nThere is another important theme in addition to hospitality in our gospel story. Jesus has stopped by the home of his good friends, the siblings Mary, Martha and Lazarus. Martha, the host, exemplifies ideal hospitality by busily caring for him. Although Martha has fulfilled the typical expectations associated with a host, it is her sister, Mary, for whom Jesus reserves his highest praise. There is a striking contrast between the sisters’ actions: “She had a sister named Mary, who had taken a seat at the feet of the Lord and was listening to him speak. Martha, though, was distracted by all that needed to be done.” Martha busies herself with the details of serving while Mary chooses to sit at the Lord’s feet and listen to what he was saying.\n\nApparently exasperated, Martha confronts Jesus about her sister’s actions, “Lord, doesn’t it concern you that my sister left me to serve alone? So, speak to her in order that she might help me.” Rather surprisingly, Jesus replies, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things, but only one thing is necessary. Mary, in fact, has made the right choice, and it will not be taken from her.” Although we might jump to the conclusion that by praising Mary, Jesus is criticizing Martha, the original hearers would not have understood Jesus’ praise of Mary to be criticism of Martha’s hospitality. The fact that he repeats her name is an example of a rhetorical device used to indicate compassion or empathy.\n\nThis brief story turns on the meaning of the “one thing” which according to Jesus’ logic is the “best part” which Mary has chosen. According to Jesus, hearing the word of God’s messenger is the one thing that is absolutely necessary. Providing for his physical needs is important, but not as critical as hearing the word. Even though hospitality is a very important factor as a social context for the spread of the Christian message, it is even more important to have followers who attend to the word as told by Jesus and his messengers. So Jesus is not condemning Martha’s frenzied activity, rather he is focusing on commending Mary’s act of discipleship. We, too sometimes get distracted by all that needs to be done. But the most important thing is to hear and share the message of God’s love, compassion and justice.\n\nParsons notes that in later interpretation of scripture, Martha also represents what is known as the vita active, the active life. She offers exemplary hospitality to Jesus. Mary, on the other hand, represents the vita contemplativa, the contemplative life. She sits at the feet of Jesus as a student and listens to him teach. Both the active life and the contemplative life are needed; to choose one over the other can upset the balance that is needed for the Christian community to thrive. The Christian patriarch Ambrose observed in his Exposition of the Gospel of Luke: “Virtue does not have a single form. In the example of Martha and Mary, there is added the busy devotion of the one and the pious attention of the other to the Word of God.” Yet Jesus gently reminds Martha – and us – that Mary’s is “the better part, because, as Parsons puts it, “actions — even acts of Christian charity and hospitality — if they are to be sustained, always follow being; that is, what we do flows naturally from who we are.” First we must hear, understand and accept in our hearts the Word of God; and then our natural response will be to act on it by demonstrating hospitality and kindness to those whom we encounter. Amen.\n\nOur gospel reading is one of the most familiar stories from the Bible. And it asks some very important questions. Who is our neighbor? What does it mean to act like a neighbor? Jesus taught that the two most important commandments are to love God and to love our neighbor as God loves us. But they were not new ideas; they had been taught in Jewish scripture for centuries. The people who made up Jesus’ audience as he told this story would have learned those basic teachings from early childhood. The lawyer who asked Jesus the question “Who is my neighbor?” and the people listening to Jesus would have been familiar with these words from the nineteenth chapter of Leviticus: “… you shall love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD… When an alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien. The alien who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.” And from the tenth chapter of Deuteronomy, God “loves the strangers, providing them food and clothing. You shall also love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.\n\nIn spite of this central teaching, the people of Jesus’ time and place were very tribal in their relationships. Their first loyalty was to immediate family and then to extended family who were the members of their particular tribe, then to the Jewish nation as a whole. Even though Samaritans were descendants of the tribe of Joseph, the rest of the Jewish tribes considered them to be outsiders. The Samaritans considered themselves to be Jewish, but their center of worship was on Mount Gerizim rather than the temple in Jerusalem. The orthodox Jews considered Samaritans to be not only heretics but also as ceremonially unclean. Relationships between the Jews of Judea and Galilee and the Samaritans varied from uneasy to downright hostile.\n\nPeople who lived in rural America often had few opportunities to interact with people who were different from themselves until well into the twentieth century. Commentator Michael Rogness references his father, who grew up in a small town in North Dakota. The only people he knew were Norwegian Lutherans. He never even met a Roman Catholic until he was a teenager! Yet each succeeding generation of their family has had their world expanded to include many diverse people. His father’s great-grandchildren count African-Americans, Hispanics and Muslims as well as new immigrants to this country among their friends at school.\n\nIn spite of our multi-ethnic world, we cannot deny that we can sometimes still be very tribal in our relationships. For the most part, we tend to show loyalty to family and friends who we consider to be “like us.” Of course, modern “tribes” are not necessarily based on religion or ethnic background. A tribe can be made up of people who share a common occupation, for example, those who serve as police or fire fighters. Our tribes tend to be the people with whom we spend the most time. Exceptions often occur in extraordinary circumstances, when people from different walks of life will join together and help one another.\n\nWhenever this story comes up in the lectionary we always hope to find modern illustrations of what Jesus was trying to teach in the first century. Recently there was an article in the New York Times about people acting as good Samaritans to families who are refugees from the civil war in Syria. The article explained that in Canada, giving aid to refugees who have been vetted and given permission to immigrate is not limited to the government. Although just over half of the new immigrants are helped by the government, the rest are helped by groups of private citizens who band together and raise enough money to subsidize a family for a year, as well as help them integrate into Canadian society. They find a suitable apartment for the family, furnish it, help them enroll their children in school, and assist the adults in finding jobs and learning English, as well as providing other support.\n\nThe groups are formed through friends, co-workers and other affiliations. The members of the groups are Christian, Jewish, Muslim or not religious at all, as well as being from varying ethnic backgrounds. Some of the hosts are descendants of refugees from Viet Nam and Cambodia who were helped to integrate into Canadian life over 40 years ago. They see this as an opportunity to pay back the help they were given. The refugee families arrive tired, confused and usually leery of what kind of welcome they will receive. They have usually spent months if not years in a refugee camp. Most of these families are middle class people like us who had to flee from their homes, leaving their community, their customs, and most of their possessions behind. They are so surprised and relieved when they are greeted at the airport by a group of people who welcome them and take them to a safe place, sometimes in their own homes, until a suitable apartment is found for them.\n\nThe members of the groups use their individual skills and talents to help the families integrate into society. They might help in the job search, tutor adults in English and children in school work. One family arrived expecting a new baby. Tragically they had lost a child born in the refugee camp. On the day the mother suddenly went into labor, they could not find the father. It was his day off from work and he had gone with some friends to play soccer. Two of the women accompanied the mother to the hospital and acted as her labor coaches until others brought the dad to the hospital so he could join his wife for the birth. After their little girl was safely delivered, as is their custom, he called his father to ask what they should name her. The father said “Julia” because she is a Canadian and she should have a name from her new country.\n\nAlthough it is difficult and often bewildering for these families to integrate into Canadian society, they work hard at it. The men who don’t speak English try to learn so they can get jobs that reflect the level of responsibility they had in Syria. It feels demeaning for a man who owned his own store or worked in a hospital or as a teacher to stock shelves in a grocery store. So they study hard in order to regain their status. The freedom and level of education is usually a far greater contrast for the women, yet most of the men encourage their wives not only to learn English but to better themselves with advanced education. In Syria that would have been a source of derision for them, but they are willing to support this new role for their wives because their previous status was not due to a lack of love or respect but to following cultural norms.\n\nThe immigrants often feel uneasy about being on the receiving end of so much generosity. As their status improves, they usually try to do things for their host group. They invite them for meals and celebrate birthdays and other milestones. Recently one of the women who initially formed her host group was diagnosed with breast cancer. She says that for the past year she was so involved helping their new immigrant family, now they, along with the rest of their host group, are supporting her.\n\nThe lawyer in the story asks Jesus “Who is my neighbor?” That answer is deceptively simple – Jesus illustrates that our neighbor is not just the person we might identify as a neighbor, but in reality is anyone in need of our help. At the end of the story, Jesus asks his own question of the lawyer. Not, “who is the neighbor?” but rather “who acted like the neighbor to the man in need?” The lawyer responds correctly and Jesus advises him to “go and do likewise.” That ending of the story encourages us to focus on acting as neighbor to others.\n\nAs a faith community we can be a little tribal – we stick together and help one another, but we also help the stranger who needs us. May we always be open to recognizing opportunities to help those who are different from us, so that, like the host groups in Canada and their refugee families, our lives may be changed together, forever. Amen.\n\nAs commentator Karoline Lewis notes, our first reaction to our gospel reading for today might be, to say, hold on, sorry Jesus, but you’re wrong. Sometimes we have to bury our dead and you are just going to have to wait. Sometimes we have to say goodbye to those we are leaving or to those we have lost, and after that we will catch up to you. Sometimes we have a few things that need to be done before we jump on the “discipleship bandwagon.” After all, we have been taught how important it is to grieve for those we have lost, perhaps especially for those to whom we are personally close, but also for those whom the world continues to insist are not worthy to be a part of God’s kingdom. Sometimes we just need some time.\n\nIn our story, Jesus has become aware of the urgency of time. As he is headed to Jerusalem and to his final moments of life on earth, every moment counts. The words which are translated in our reading as “When the days drew near for him to be taken up” can be better translated literally “as the days were being fulfilled.” It was as if Jesus realized that the momentum of fulfillment of prophecy had accelerated and there wasn’t much time left to accomplish his mission here on earth.\n\nBut this urgency is beyond just the personal situation that Jesus finds himself in at that moment in time. It is, as Lewis insists, about “the urgency of God’s favor… What if Jesus sees the importance of time, of a minute, of even a second, not just for the sake of the urgency of his ministry, the urgency of the kingdom he wishes to bring into its fullness, the urgency of making sure that all [have the opportunity to know God’s favor before he is silenced, but simply] because being human means such urgency — every moment really does count.”\n\nEvery moment has to count since God made the decision to become one of us. Jesus’ call is not an insensitive plea to abandon that which is important to us, who matters to us, who and what make a difference for us. Jesus’ call to let go is a promise — that God becoming human means that moments matter. Time makes a difference. And that even seconds matter to God. Not for the sake of our service alone, but for the sake of being in the kingdom God imagines. Every moment matters because every one of us counts.\n\nWe all understand that in emergencies, every moment counts. When our parishoiner had her stroke, the fact that her family called 911 and an ambulance arrived to rush her to the closest hospital, Nassau University Medical Center, made all the difference. NUMC might not be the place for elective medical care, but it is a premier trauma center and if anyone can save your life in an emergency, they will. But time makes a difference, and because she had surgery less than fourteen days prior to the stroke, they were unable to give her TPA, the medication that helps to break up clots. Time is important with that treatment, which must be administered within four and a half hours of the stroke in order to be effective. We thank God that she was saved and so much of her function has returned, but if she had been able to have the TPA she might have had a faster and even more complete recovery.\n\nDuring World War II there was a prisoner of war camp in northern Italy, in the area known as the South Tyrol. The camp had formerly been a grand castle. One of the prisoners was a British soldier who had been carefully plotting his escape during the whole time he was there. Now he was ready, and the attempt would be made that night. Unbeknownst to the prisoners, the Allied forces had landed in Italy and were advancing on Rome. The Italian Fascist forces were giving up. All during that day, guards had been quietly leaving, dressed in civilian clothing, leaving weapons behind so they could avoid capture. The men went to the large hall for mail call, but no one brought the mail. Suddenly they heard a commotion. Trucks had come into the camp, with Allied prisoners of war who were high ranking officers. They were herded inside and placed on the grand staircase, waiting for their quarters to be prepared.\n\nThe prisoners realized that this was their chance to overcome the small contingent guarding the officers and the few remaining prison guards. Quietly they gathered weapons that had been left behind and knives and cleavers from the kitchen. But they had to be patient and wait for just the right moment. One second too soon, or one second too late, and the guards would realize what was going on and they would fail. The men were anxious, many of them wanting to move immediately. But discipline was maintained, and at just the right time, the order was given; they rushed the hall and overcame the guards and commandant of the camp. Instead of a solitary breakout by one prisoner, all of the prisoners were now free and found help from the resistance forces from the South Tyrol who helped them reach the Allied forces. Instead of being patient and waiting for the war to be over, for the Allied forces to liberate them, in a matter of minutes they were free.\n\nYes, we are familiar with the fact that in many situations, particularly those that can mean life or death, every moment counts. But we might wonder what all that has to do with discipleship and with the impatience Jesus seems to display to the people he comes in contact with in our gospel lesson. Perhaps the urgency of his own situation has encouraged Jesus to recognize our very human tendency to put off the moments in time that might actually make a difference in our witness to God’s promises. Perhaps Jesus sees that we come all set with excuses to hold off on our commitment. Perhaps we are waiting for just the right moment to make our experience of the Gospel perfect in a way that it was never meant to be. Jesus seems to want us to stop making excuses and start imagining experiences that are more spontaneous, to be willing to say “let’s see what happens” rather than, “first I need all my stuff figured out.”\n\nJesus wants to know if we understand the urgency of the need to share the Good News about his life, death and resurrection. That leads to a series of questions: Are we sitting around waiting for God to do something, or are we willing to commit ourselves to action? Are we waiting for someone else to speak on behalf of justice and call for righteousness? Or will we recognize the urgency of the moment and proclaim the hope of God’s promises? Are we waiting for others to stand up for those whom our world rejects and reviles, or will we seize the moment and insist God’s love is for all? Are we waiting for someone else to serve as the advocates that God has called us to be, or do we realize that every moment counts and we need to tell the truth -even if it means taking a risk?\n\nJesus is asking us how we measure our witness to the love of God. There are five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes in the year of a life. Life can begin in one of those minutes, or it can be lost. Jesus wants us to make every moment count. Jesus is telling us that each one of us counts. Every human life counts. And God is counting on us to spread that word. Amen.\n\nOn Youth Sunday we always look forward to hearing a sermon from one of our young people. Unfortunately, the young person who was supposed to preach today was faced with a decision to make, whether to play a last soccer game or to fulfill the commitment to preach the sermon today. This is not about any one person, the greeter, who is my son, worked until 3 am and so did not make it either. The worst part about this predicament is that a choice had to be made at all. I am not one of those people who longs for the “good old days” because the reality is that there has never been a time in history that is so perfect that we would want it to last forever. There are always positive improvements that often outweigh life in times past.\n\nHowever, there is one thing that I definitely long for in the good old days that we once knew, and that is the fact that the Sabbath was once reserved for worship, family, friends and relaxation. That was true for both Jewish people with a Saturday Sabbath and Christians with our Sunday Sabbath. Those days no longer exist, partly because the majority of Christians and Jews do not insist on keeping the Sabbath anymore. If everyone resisted having their Sabbath co-opted by sports and other secular events, and if everyone insisted on reserving time for worship, family and friends, then the secular world would not be able to dominate our time and co-opt our Sabbath. We complain about it but we have allowed it to happen.\n\nWithout enough notice for another young person to prepare, you are stuck with me. It may have seemed as though we had ended our quest for an answer to the question “Who is Jesus?,” but the author of the gospel of Luke has not finished exploring that question. Today we have a story which is, let’s face it, kind of creepy. For some reason the lectionary leaves out the story after our gospel for last week, when the woman who crashed the party given by Simon the Pharisee poured ointment on Jesus’ feet, used her hair to wipe his feet and kissed them. Scandalous behavior for a Jewish woman, but Jesus considers it an act of love and forgives her sins. Who is this Jesus who heals from afar, who revives the dead, who forgives even the most scandalous sinners?\n\nIt turns out that in the next story he is the one who calms the storm on the Sea of Galilee. Although it is really a landlocked lake, the Sea of Galilee, also called the Lake of Genessarat, is eight miles wide, thirteen miles long and prone to violent storms that rise up suddenly. The disciples were in a boat with Jesus, who was sleeping comfortably in the bow, when a storm arose which terrified even the most sea worthy fishermen among them. Yet Jesus calms the storm and saves them all from drowning. The disciples ask among themselves, “Who is this who can even calm the wind and waves?”\n\nAs the disciples were no doubt calming their nerves after such a close call, they approach the shore in a place called the land of the Gerasenes. We don’t know why Jesus chose to go across from Galilee to that place, but immediately they encounter a man who is possessed by demons. He is so seriously ill that the people of the town cannot control him, even with chains. He lives among the tombs, stark naked, unable to control his impulses, which cause pretty serious damage to him. It can be difficult for us to relate to stories about demons in a literal sense, but we all know that there are demons which can possess us today. Some of the more serious are mental illness, such as this poor man no doubt experienced, and substance abuse.\n\nThis story is all about Jesus; power over what was considered “unclean.” The man is unclean because of his uncontrollable behavior. He lives among the tombs, which were considered unclean. He lives near the place where the herds of pigs that were brought to the Middle East by the Romans to feed their soldiers were kept. Pigs were considered unclean by the people of Palestine. And even the demon that possesses him is unclean. Demons always recognize Jesus, but this one actually negotiates with him. If it must leave this man, then it wishes to possess the herd of pigs.\n\nNotice that the man does not ask for Jesus’ help. The demon who possesses him wants to know what Jesus has to do with him. There is an element of respect, perhaps even fear, because demons always recognize the power that Jesus has. The demon tries to tell Jesus to leave him alone. Because by commanding the demons to leave the man, Jesus restores his life and denies the demon the power it had over him. When the people of the town come to see what has happened, they find the man sitting at Jesus’ feet, clean, clothed and in control of his actions. He can now return to his family and live in a home instead of a miserable, tormented existence isolated from society. This is a miracle, not just for the man, but for all who knew him.\n\nThe man’s response is a desire to leave his home and follow Jesus. But Jesus encourages him to return to his home and family and to share the good news of what has happened to him. He may not literally follow Jesus on his travels, but he can be a faithful follower in his own community. Just as Jesus gave the widow back her only son, so he returns the man who was possessed to his family. Who is this man, who has the power to exorcise demons?\n\nWe have all encountered people possessed by the powerful demons of mental illness or substance abuse. Sadly some of us may have loved ones struggling with these powerful forces that isolate them and deny them life. But it isn’t only those who are in such dire straits who say to Jesus, “What have you to do with me? Leave me alone.” Sometimes we think that life would be less complicated if only Jesus would just leave us alone. We would get a couple of hours to ourselves on Sunday mornings. We wouldn’t have to prepare Sunday school lessons, go to choir rehearsal, show up for quilting or cooking for the I.N.N., attend council meetings or do any of the myriad other things we do for God and our church. We wouldn’t have to make choices between church and sports or other secular activities that try to dominate our time and our energy. There would be plenty of time for all the other demands on our lives.\n\nWho is Jesus? The truth is that when we hold Jesus at the center of our lives, when we understand and acknowledge that having God in our lives is a positive thing, we are healthier and even happier. There is a correlation between having faith and being part of a faith community and good health. A higher percentage of people of faith report feeling more fulfilled and experiencing happiness in life. As Kevin Massey, vice president for mission and spiritual care at Advocate Health Care in Chicago notes, “The active component in faith that supports coping in a difficult time is the capacity of faith to kindle hope. Hope is an anchor that you can throw into the future and faith is the chain on the anchor you can use to pull yourself toward the future.” When we have faith, we know that the future can hold promise, and God is the bridge between present and future.\n\nWe are so thankful to have our youth lead us in worship today, and we pray that they will make good decisions when they are faced with the difficult choice of choosing between God and the demands of the secular world. All of us have faced such decisions at one time or another and it can be more difficult for young people to withstand the pressure. We need to stand united as people of faith, and to be strong in keeping the Sabbath for our families, instead of just squeezing God into a few hours a week. We need to deny the demons their power over us. Who is Jesus? He is always there for us, and our response should be to sit at his feet, listen and learn, and emulate the love, compassion and forgiveness that he demonstrated for us. Amen.\n\nPENT4C16 – 06.12.16\n\nWho is Jesus? Our Sunday school students believe that Jesus is: love, joy and happiness, family and friend, a sacrifice for us, hope and forgiveness, teacher, for everyone, part of nature and life, and will always watch over us. That’s a pretty thoughtful and comprehensive list!\n\nWho is Jesus? That is the question we have been asking for the past three weeks as we explore stories from the Gospel of Luke. The author of Luke has been attempting to answer that question through the stories he relates about Jesus’ ministry. We have learned that he healed the slave of a centurion without even coming near the man. Because of the faith that the centurion had in Jesus’ power, he simply said the word and the man was healed. Then Jesus intervened out of compassion when he encountered a widow who was about to bury her only son. Although the widow did not ask Jesus for his help, he revived the young man knowing that his death would leave her completely vulnerable. The people who saw those events wondered, “Who is this man?” His own disciples were not sure of who he was, and even John the Baptizer questioned if he was the one that they had been waiting for, the one for whom he was preparing the way.\n\nCaptivated by his powerful teaching, they knew he was a great rabbi. As witnesses to his healing power and his ability to revive those who had died, they guessed that he was a great prophet, perhaps even the prophet Elijah returned to life. His own response to John the Baptizer was that John knew the signs of the messiah, so if these things that Jesus was doing fulfilled those signs, then he must be the messiah.\n\nIn today’s gospel we learn of a more scandalous episode in Jesus’ ministry. This story is told in all four gospels, but in three different versions. Mark and Matthew agree with Luke that there was a dinner party that was crashed by an unknown woman, but in their version the story took place two days before the Passover, in the house of a different Simon, Simon the leper, and the woman poured the oil over Jesus’ head. The disciples became angry over the waste of expensive oil, but Jesus praised the woman for her good deed.\n\nIn John, the story also takes place two days before Passover, but in a very different place and under different circumstances. John tells an eyewitness account of a dinner at the home of Jesus’ friends, Lazarus and his sisters Mary and Martha in Bethany. Mary is the one who pours the oil over his feet and Jesus praises her for understanding who he truly is and indicates that her action is in anticipation of his death. Judas is the one who gets angry over the waste of money on perfume, even though he is a thief. .\n\nLuke includes this story much earlier on in Jesus’ ministry. We aren’t sure if Simon the Pharisee is a friend who wants to learn more from Jesus or if he is an enemy trying to trick him. Simon and his guests are reclining at table, when this woman, a ‘sinner,’ enters the home of a Pharisee, a person of authority, uninvited. We don’t know if Jesus knows her, but it appears that Simon knows who and what she is. She pours oil over the feet of Jesus and unbinds her hair to wipe his feet which are wet with the oil and her tears. She continues to weep and kisses the feet of Jesus. The woman does not give any indication of why she is doing this. Her action, whether or not she was a woman of ill repute, would have been scandalous. Aside from the fact that she crashed the party, a Jewish woman would never have uncovered her hair before strangers, nor would she have touched a stranger’s feet.\n\nThis is a different kind of healing – the woman’s sins are forgiven; she is saved. Jesus does not question her or ask anything of her. But Jesus tells her that because of her scandalous actions, which were in reality acts of great love, her sins, “which were many, have been forgiven.” It is almost as if that is the easy part, a response that we have come to expect from Jesus. More complicated is the role played by Simon. Jesus seems to have known that he was always under intense scrutiny. Simon wants to know who Jesus is, but he does not think Jesus is a prophet because he lets this sinful woman touch him. Jesus is not only a rabbi and a healer; he appears to be a mind reader as well. He can tell from the look on Simon’s face and read in the silence at the table that the Pharisee would reject the woman outright and believe that she was unworthy of God’s forgiveness. By telling the story of the debtors, Jesus points out that Simon does not understand the true nature of God’s love and acceptance. Yet Simon does understand that if a large debt is forgiven, that person who owes the debt will love the one who forgives.\n\nThen the question comes up again. Luke tells us, “Those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves, ‘”Who is this who even forgives sins?”’ How did we answer that question? The responses include: “Jesus is my Lord and Savior. The last one I talk to before sleeping and the first one upon waking. He is always with me!!” Jesus is: ‘inspiration, comforter, compassionate, best friend, savior, teacher, model of who we should be, always with us,” and from a three year old “the Son of God!”\n\nThe common thread in all three versions of this story is that the woman, whether unknown or his beloved friend Mary of Bethany, is not doing something scandalous or wasteful but performing an act of love. The woman understands who Jesus is. Jesus wants us to realize that we are all like the woman and the debtor. She has come to Jesus with a large debt of sin. We owe God a debt that is impossible to repay. Our healing comes when we, like the woman, understand the answer to the question “Who is Jesus?” and our response is to kneel at his feet and pour out our love. Amen.\n\nWho is Jesus? That is the question we are exploring for a few weeks in the Gospel of Luke. Other questions that naturally arise from that central one are: What difference does he make in our lives? How are we to make sense of his story and all that he said and did? Last week we learned that Jesus was able to heal the slave of a Roman centurion without even meeting the dying man. He praised the centurion as having the most faith he had ever experienced. What kind of rabbi has such power? This week Jesus spontaneously uses his power to heal and in that act we see echoes of the prophets in this fascinating story that is told only by the author of Luke and Acts.\n\nOur story takes place in Nain, which today is known as Nein and is mainly Arabic, a small town in Galilee about 5 miles southwest of Nazareth and 25 miles from Capernaum where Jesus had just healed the slave. It is not clear why Jesus is going to Nain, but we are told that a large crowd is following Jesus. The word was spreading about his power to heal. As Jesus and the crowd approach the town, a procession of people going out of the city meets them. A man of the town has died and villagers are accompanying his mother out to the cemetery for his burial. We are told that his mother is a widow and he was her only son. That means she is now in a precarious place financially because without either a husband or son she would not have a source of income.\n\nHer grief is new. According to Jewish burial laws she would have to bury her son within twenty-four hours of his death, so when Jesus encounters her he had just died. Surrounded by neighbors she is walking in pain and sorrow. Perhaps we can imagine the thoughts that were racing through her head — “What will happen to me? How will I survive without my son?” It is quite probable that in her sorrow and despair this unnamed widow would not have even noticed Jesus or the crowd surrounding him.\n\nJesus sees the widow and knows her situation. He also seems to know that this was her only son. Unlike the many stories where people solicit help from Jesus, he does not wait for the widow to approach him. He enters into what is a private time for her and stops the funeral procession. Although he is near the young man he does not actually touch him, he merely touches the casket on which his body rests and revives him. Amazingly, he sits up and begins to speak. The crowd is amazed, and many exclaim “A great prophet is among us!”\n\nWho is Jesus? Is he a prophet, a rabbi, a miracle worker? The people in the crowd would conclude that he was a great prophet because they knew the stories of the prophets. Although some were confined mainly to prophetic speech, the great prophet Elijah and the prophet who followed him, Elisha; were both men through whom God worked miracles. During his ministry on earth, people thought Jesus might be Elijah returned to life. That was because of stories like our first lesson for today.\n\nElijah was in a desperate situation. He was fighting against King Ahab, who had married Jezebel a pagan woman and had promoted the worship of the god Ba’al among the Israelites. In retribution, God sent a drought to the land. So Elijah was fleeing Ahab in a land that had little food and no rain. Eventually he entered Sidon and encountered a widow who was about to prepare a last meal for herself and her son. After that meal was over, she expected they would starve to death. But Elijah instructs her to make a small cake for him first, and after she does so, she finds that the grain and oil do not give out, but remain enough so that she and her household as well as Elijah have enough to keep from starving.\n\nImagine the frustration that Elijah felt when the woman’s young son becomes sick and dies. Notice how the woman is transformed – instead of being worn out and resigned to a fate of death by starvation, she is ready to fight for her son. Having enough food has given her physical strength and the influence of Elijah in her life has renewed her spiritual determination. She turns to Elijah as the religious authority and demands to know if he has brought her to God’s attention. It was a common belief in the ancient Middle East that tragedies were the direct result of sin, even though that was not the teaching of Judaism. So this woman assumes that suddenly God has become aware of her past sins and is punishing her by taking her son’s life.\n\nWe don’t have to imagine how frustrated Elijah was at this turn of events. He takes issue with God, questioning why God would even think to take the life of the only son of this widow who was trusting and generous enough to give him food when she had so little. Elijah prays to God that the child would be healed, and God uses Elijah as the conduit for his healing power and the boy is revived. In response the widow testifies to her confidence that Elijah is indeed a man of God.\n\nThe people of Israel who witnessed the healing power of Jesus were very familiar with that story about Elijah, as well as a similar story where Elisha revives a boy whose mother has brought him to the prophet. Elisha follows a similar ritual to that used by Elijah, his teacher and mentor. No doubt Luke intends for both the crowd, and us, to see and understand the parallels between those two great prophets of Israel and Jesus. They are able to use the power given them by God to revive sons of widows, thereby giving life back to the sons and the possibility for survival back to their mothers. Elijah “gave him to his mother” just as Jesus “gave him to his mother.” But the prophets had to perform a ritual and invoke the power of God. Jesus has even more power than they do, he can perform this healing through his own power, without even touching the dead young man.\n\nSo of course the witnesses to this event ask “Who is this Jesus?” They have experienced his teaching, so they know he is a talented rabbi. But now they have witnessed him heal the sick and resuscitate those who have died. Is he a prophet as great as Elijah, or is he perhaps Elijah come back to life? Apparently there were some followers of John the Baptizer in the crowd who witnessed Jesus bring the young man back to life. In the verses that follow our reading, they go to John and tell him the story. John’s response is to send them back to Jesus to ask “who are you?” He had been telling the people that one who is more powerful than he was coming. So he asks, “Are you the one we have been waiting for, the one for whom I have been sent to prepare the way?”\n\nThis is notable because the encounter between Mary, the mother of Jesus, and Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptizer, is only found in the Gospel of Luke. Luke tells us that they were somehow related to one another, perhaps as cousins. John baptized Jesus in the beginning of his ministry; surely he must have noted something special about that event. Besides Mary, his mother, if anyone should know who Jesus is, it would be his relative John the Baptizer. Yet John is not quite sure, he, too, is asking the question, “Who is Jesus?”\n\nIn his gospel narrative Luke reports that Jesus captivated the crowds with his teaching, he healed the sick and even raised the dead. All of these things are meant to indicate who Jesus is. What is your answer to the question, “Who is Jesus?” Amen."
