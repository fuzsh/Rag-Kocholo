By this Trusting Surrender of Our Entire Being into your hands, we want to welcome you in a Deep and Lasting Way into Our Everyday Lives.\n\n“Mary, first Disciple of your Son, in Cana, you intercede for us and by showing us your Son you tell us: “Do whatever He tells you.” Grant us your assistance and help us, following your example and your call, to be Faithful Disciples of the One you carried in everything.\n\n“Mary, standing at the foot of the Cross, it is you whom Jesus gave us as Mother.\n\nIntercede for us; help us to be faithful to Our Commitments.\n\nIntercede for the Church and for the Congregation. Watch over the Mennaisian Family.\n\nTake care of children and young people.\n\nSupport them, encourage them, strengthen them and nourish them with Joy, Love and Hope.\n\n“Mary, full of Glory, all Generations call you Blessed.\n\nHelp us to love God as you loved Him, so that one day we can share with you the Joy promised to Good and Faithful Servants.”\n\nAmen!"
