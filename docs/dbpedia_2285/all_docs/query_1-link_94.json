        "text": "VATICAN INSIDER: THE RELIC PROJECT\n\nMy guest this week in the interview segment is Anthony di Mauro. We talk briefly about his time this summer as an intern in the Rome EWTN office and then focus on something amazing he has started called The Relic Project. That is the main focus of our conversation. What is a relic? Have you ever seen on? Does your family have one? What about your parish? Perhaps it even has a few relics. Are they on display? If not, why not?\n\nListen closely to learn the difference between first class, second class and third class relics! Stay tuned for that conversation after the news highlights.\n\nRelics come in many forms. Relics that are old, even ancient, and/or very rare are usually preserved in some precious metal container, be it small, medium or very large.\n\nThe relics I show here are mine. I have either inherited them or been given some of the relic holy cards like that of St. Gianna Molla (her daughter gave me the one you see). Anthony and I looked at my relics and it seems a few might be more important than originally thought!\n\nA very important fact: Relics cannot ever be sold! So you will (should) not find them on Amazon or E-bay, etc.\n\nThis came down to me through a great aunt who, I was told, had a big collection of relics. Every Sunday at 10 for three months, at the summer home in Michigan of my Aunt Julia and Uncle Frank, Mass was celebrated outside for a large number of fellow vacationing Catholics. They had many priests and bishops as friends and one of them always celebrated Mass. Aunt Julia always sat in the front row on the left and aways had several relics with her. Our family attended those Masses for countless summers.\n\nThe real miracle at the time was that for all those months, for 30 years, it never rained on a Sunday between 10 and 11! I wonder which relic was responsible!\n\nThis is a crucifix passed on to my mother, if I remember correctly, by my paternal grandmother. The front side…\n\nThe back side: the relic is inside, just open the round aperture\n\nThe relic: I am not sure who or what it is! (Anthony Mary Claret?)\n\nOften the “reliquary” is a small piece of cloth to which is attached the relic.\n\nand St. Jacinta Marto (Fatima) –\n\nRelics that are part of a holy card are very common today:\n\nGianna Beretta Molla (from her clothing)\n\nAnd you know, of course, Servant of God Joseph Dutton on whose cause for canonization I have been involved in the diocese of Honolulu:\n\nThe Relic Project business card:\n\nVATICAN REVEALS THEME FOR 2025 WORLD DAY OF PEACE\n\n“Forgive us our trespasses: grant us your peace” is the theme chosen by Pope Francis for the next “World Day of Peace,” held on January 1, 2025.\n\nBy Christopher Wells (Vatican news)\n\n“Only from a genuine conversion on all levels – personal, local and international – will true peace be able to flourish,” says the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development in its statement on the theme for the 2025 World Day of Peace.\n\nIn Thursday’s statement, the Dicastery adds that peace comes not only from an end to conflicts, “but also in a new reality in which wounds are healed and each person’s dignity is recognized”.\n\nThe World Day of Peace is observed each year on January 1, the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God. Since its establishment in 1967 by Pope St Paul VI, the Popes have taken the occasion to offer magisterial reflections in Messages for the day, dealing with topics such as the United Nations, human rights, diplomacy, and economic development.\n\nThe theme chosen by the Holy Father for the World Day of Peace for 2025 is “Forgive us our trespasses: grant us your peace”, corresponding to “the biblical and ecclesial understanding of the Jubilee Year”.\n\nHope and forgiveness at the heart of the Jubilee\n\nIn its statement, the Dicastery says the theme is inspired by Pope Francis’s encyclical letters Laudato sí and Fratelli tutti, “and above all by the concepts of Hope and Forgiveness, which are at the heart of the Jubilee, a time for conversion that calls us not to condemn, but instead to bring about reconciliation and peace”.\n\nThe Dicastery goes on to note by “considering the reality of conflicts and social sins afflicting humanity today in light of the hope inherent in the Jubilee tradition of the forgiveness of sins and the cancellation of debts, together with the reflections of the Fathers of the Church in this regard, concrete principles emerge that can lead to a much needed spiritual, social, economic, ecological and cultural change”.\n\nPROTESTS BRIEFLY INTERRUPT GENERAL AUDIENCE\n\nToday’s general audience was held in the Paul VI Hall given the extreme heat in Rome in recent days.\n\nAt about 1:44 into the video of the audience, as an Italian reader was reciting an opening biblical reflection, she suddenly looked up, as if surprised by something. In fact, as she was reading, two protesters from PETA who were carrying signs in English and Spanish that said, “bullfighting is a sin” were quietly being escorted out of the Hall. (photo by Daniel Ibanez – EWTN/CNA\n\nClick here for video: Pope at Audience: With God, nothing is impossible – Vatican News\n\nPETA is an acronym for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.\n\nPOPE AT AUDIENCE: WITH GOD, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE\n\nPope Francis resumes his general audiences after the summer break, reflecting on the work of the Holy Spirit in the Redemption won by Christ.\n\nBy Christopher Wells (Vatican news)\n\nThe Pope’s general audiences began again after pausing for the month of July, with the Holy Father resuming his reflections on the work of the Holy Spirit.\n\nHaving concluded his catechesis on the work of the Holy Spirit in Creation, Pope Francis moved on to the New Testament to consider the Holy Spirit’s role in the Redemption won by Jesus Christ.\n\nThe Holy Spirit and the Incarnation\n\nOn Wednesday, the Pope took up the theme of the Holy Spirit in the Incarnation of the Word, beginning with the affirmation of the Creed that Jesus “by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became man”.\n\nThis, Pope Francis said, “is therefore an ecumenical fact of faith, because all Christians profess together the same Creed”. It is reflected in traditional Catholic piety in the daily recitation of the Angelus.\n\nThe Blessed Virgin Mary, a figure of the Church\n\nIt also provides the basis for the comparison between the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Church, a parallel taken up by the Second Vatican Council: As the Blessed Virgin first conceived than bore Christ, so, too, the Church welcomes Christ “by receiving the Word of God in faith, and becomes herself a mother.” Without first accepting the Word of God, the Church’s “life and preaching” becomes “sterile”.\n\nPope Francis concluded his catechesis by reflecting on Mary’s question at the Annunciation, “How is this possible?” The Church asks the same question, he said: “How is it possible to proclaim Jesus Christ and His salvation to a world that seems to seek only well-being in this world?”\n\nWith God, nothing will be impossible’\n\nThe answer, then and now, is the same, the Pope said, quoting the book of Acts: “You shall receive power from the Holy Spirit”. Without the Holy Spirit, the Pope said, the Church cannot go forward, the Church cannot grow, the Church cannot preach.”\n\n“What is said about the Church in general applies to every single baptized person”, the Pope continued. When we find ourselves “in situations beyond our own strength”, he continued, we do well “to resume our journey with this comforting thought,” by recalling the words of the Angel to Mary, “With God, nothing will be impossible”. “And if we believe this,” he said, “we will perform miracles. Nothing is impossible for God.”\n\nPOPE PRAYS FOR PEACE TO EXTINGUISH STRIFE IN MIDDLE EAST\n\nAt the Wednesday general audience, Pope Francis appealed for a ceasefire in the Middle East, prayed for peace in Ukraine, Myanmar, and Sudan, and called for greater efforts and prayers to end ethnic discrimination in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\n“I pray that the sincere search for peace will extinguish strife, love will overcome hatred, and revenge will be disarmed by forgiveness,” Pope Francis said at Wednesday’s general audience.\n\nSaying that he continues to follow the situation in the Middle East “with great concern,” the Holy Father repeated his appeals for an immediate ceasefire “on all fronts, beginning with Gaza, where the humanitarian situation is very serious”, and “unsustainable.” Pope prays for peace to extinguish strife in Middle East – Vatican News\n\nA story I love re-telling on August 5….\n\nPope Francis at this moment, 5:30 pm in Rome, is at St. Mary Major for vespers and the annual snowfall! Go to vaticannews.va/en for streaming\n\nTHE AUGUST SNOWFALL IN ROME\n\nEvery so often people write me to tell me they’ve read stories of snowfall in Rome in August, traditionally the hottest month of the year. although in a continuous battle with July for that title! The snowfall they read about has nothing to do with needing warm clothes when you visit Rome in August but has everything to do with one of the four papal basilicas in Rome, Our Lady of the Snows, aka St. Mary Major.\n\nThe other three papal basilicas are St. Peter’s, St. Paul’s Outside the Walls and St. John Lateran. By the way, these four basilicas, with three others, constitute the 7 must-visit pilgrim churches in Rome. The remaining three: St. Sebastian, Holy Cross in Jerusalem (with relics of the crucifixion) and St. Lawrence – San Lorenzo al Verano.\n\nNow about the snowfall:\n\nThe year was 358 A.D. John, a Roman patrician, and his wife, unable to have children, had been praying faithfully to the Virgin, asking her to give them a sign as to whom they should leave their enormous patrimony. The night of August 4-5, one of the hottest of the year, Mary appeared to the couple in a dream and requested that they build a church in her honor where snow would fall that night.\n\nJohn and his wife went to tell their friend Pope Liberius of their dream and to their amazement discovered that the pontiff had had the same dream. That morning, August 5, one of Rome’s seven fabled hills, the Esquiline, was covered in snow, as witnessed by John, his wife, the Pope and his entourage, and a throng of Romans. Pope Liberius took a stick and traced the sign of the future basilica in the snow, a basilica that would be forever known as Our Lady of the Snows, in addition to the name it bears today, St. Mary Major, the greatest – and the oldest – Marian church.\n\nThe feast of Our Lady of the Snows was introduced that year and has been commemorated ever since on August 5. Each year, there are two celebrations on that day. In late afternoon during a liturgy, usually vespers, thousands of white flower petals, symbolizing the miraculous snowfall, are released through one of the square panels of the basilica’s glorious gilt ceiling. In the evening, about 9 pm, outside the basilica, white flower petals are showered down on the faithful who have gathered to commemorate that event.\n\nIf you are ever in Rome on August 5 go to St. Mary Major in mid-afternoon or about 9 at night to witness the snowfall and participate in a liturgy.\n\nHere’s a brief Youtube video I did on my first visit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9LTZk-k2k8\n\nJust before 8 pm this evening, the Holy See Press Office issued the following statement in French about the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics on Friday, July 26. Protestations by Christians worldwide about the parody of Da Vinci’s Last Supper that featured drag queens have arrived non-stop since July 26. A notable absence was the voice of the Vatican.\n\nAccording to Turkey’s information directorate, two days ago, in a phone call to Pope Francis, the Muslim President of Turkey, Recep Rayyip Erdogan, said, “he believes it is necessary to raise a collective voice and display a unified stance against such actions.”\n\nHOLY SEE “SADDENED BY CERTAIN SCENES FROM OPENING CEREMONY OF OLYMPICS”\n\nThe Holy See was saddened by certain scenes from the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Paris and can only join the voices raised in recent days to deplore the offense done to many Christians and believers of other religions. In a prestigious event where the entire world becomes united around common values, there cannot be references that ridicule the religious convictions of so many people. Freedom of expression, which is obviously not called into question here, finds its limit in the respect for others.\n\nVATICAN INSIDER: AN INTODUCTION TO ROME’S CELEBRATED CATACOMBS\n\n“Summertime and the livin’ is easy” says George Gershwin’s famous song “Summertime” from “Porgy and Bess.”\n\n“The livin’ is easy” unless, of course, you are a tourist in Italy in July and August, desirious of seeing everything this culturally super rich country has to offer but you have to do so under scorching temperatures. There are days when the sidewalks seem to melt right under your feet and your shoes seem to become one with the pavement!\n\nWell, there are two abundant, faith-filled ways to get a bit of relief.\n\nChurches – and there are hundreds in Rome! – offer a coolness that truly uplifts the spirit as you slowly walk around, enjoying the work of silversmiths and goldsmiths, the sculptures, the many chapels, the main altar, the stunning cosmatesque floors and much more. Hopefully you will visit a few churches as Mass is about to begin.\n\nAnother way to cool off is to spend some time in one or more of Rome’s celebrated catacombs. They are all well underground, of course and you will cool off the second you start to descend into these historic burial chambers.\n\nAnd that is what I will tell you about this weekend in what is normally the interview segment of Vatican Insider.\n\nIf you intend to come to Rome in the near future or during the Jubilee Year 2025, the catacombs are a must. Here are a few photos I took of the catacombs of St. Tecla:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES, you can listen to Vatican Insider (VI) on a Catholic radio station near you (stations listed at www.ewtn.com) or on channel 130 Sirius-XM satellite radio, or on http://www.ewtn.com.

It is usually the first door to be opened to indicate the beginning of the Holy Year. This first evidence of the rite happening in St Peter’s was in the year 1500 during the papacy of Alexander VI.\n\nLater, on 29 December, the Pope will open the Holy Door of the Archbasilica of St John Lateran, the Cathedral of Rome. On the same day, every Cathedral and co-Cathedral throughout the world will have Mass celebrated by the local Bishop to mark the opening of the Jubilee.\n\nOn the Solemnity of Mary the Mother of God, 1 January 2025, Pope Francis will open the Holy Door for the Basilica of St Mary Major, with the Holy Door for the Basilica of St Paul’s Outside the Walls being opened on Sunday, 5 January, the Vigil of Epiphany.\n\n“In the course of the year,” Pope Francis had written, “every effort should be made to enable the People of God to participate fully in its proclamation of hope in God’s grace and in the signs that attest to their efficacy.”\n\nOn 28 December 2025, the Jubilee will end in the particular Churches throughout the world, with the Holy Doors of St John Lateran, St Mary Major, and St Paul’s Outside the Walls being closed on that same date.\n\nFinally, the Jubilee Year will formally conclude in Rome on the Solemnity of Epiphany, 6 January 2026.\n\nPOPE PAYS SURPRISE VISIT TO AMUSEMENT PARK\n\nPope Francis this afternoon paid a surprise visit to Luna Park, a celebrated amusement park in the seaside town of Ostia, 20 miles southwest of Rome.\n\nToday is the final day of the Holy Father’s summer break, known here as a staycation. July is his preferred month to have some time off. July 31 is also the feast of St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, the order to which Pope Francis belongs.\n\nAccording to the Vatican press office, Pope Francis arrived in Ostia at 3pm to visit Sister Geneviève Jeanningros, Little Sister of Jesus, and the community of carnival and circus performers at Luna Park\n\nThe communique added that the Holy Father blessed a statue of the Madonna protectress of traveling entertainers and circus workers, and greeted the families and children present.\n\nHe returned to the Vatican at 4:30.\n\nOstia Antica, called Rome’s Imperial Port by Archeology Magazine, is also known for its extraordinary Roman ruins. The city is currently hosting the first edition of Ostia Summer Park, a free festival within Luna Park.\n\nPOPE NAMES TWO BISHOPS AT DOCTRINE OF THE FAITH\n\nMonday the press office announced two rather remarkable appointments at the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith where two officials were appointed as titular bishops.\n\nSince 2022 the DDF has had two sections, the disciplinary section and the doctrinal section, each headed by a monsignor.\n\nMonday, Francis named Monsignor John Joseph Kennedy, Secretary for the Disciplinary Section of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, as titular Bishop of Ossero, conferring on him the personal title of Archbishop. (vatican news photo)\n\nHe also appointed Monsignor Philippe Curbelié, Under-Secretary of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith. as titular Bishop of Utica.\n\nInterestingly enough, there is also a Secretary for the Doctrinal Section of the DDF, but he did not receive an episcopal elevation.\n\nVatican dicasteries, formerly known as pontifical councils and congregations, are generally led by three officials, a prefect or president, a secretary and an under-secretary (or two), but there are some exceptions such as the Dicastery for the Service of Charity led by Almoner of His Holiness: Cardinal Konrad Krajewski.\n\nThe DDF structure is as follows: Cardinal prefect; Secretary – Doctrinal Section; Secretary – Disciplinary Section; Adjunct Secretary; Under-Secretary; Promotor of Justice.\n\n(Catholic Culture has an interesting take on these appointments: www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=62987. I am delighted at Msgr Kennedy’s elevation as we have been friends for years. Here is what the Irish Catholics Bishops Conference had to say: Statement of Archbishop Dermot Farrell on appointment of Monsignor John Kennedy as Archbishop | Irish Catholic Bishops’ Conference\n\nPOPE FRANCIS’ PRAYER INTENTION FOR AUGUST\n\nPope Francis’ Prayer Intention for August 2024: We pray that political leaders will be at the service of their people, working for integral human development, working for the common good, caring for those who have lost their jobs and favoring the poorest.\n\nToday, politics doesn’t have a very good reputation: corruption, scandals, distant from people’s day-to-day lives.\n\nBut, can we move ahead toward universal fraternity without good politics? No.\n\nAs Paul VI said, politics is one of the highest forms of charity because it seeks the common good.\n\nI’m talking about POLITICS with all capital letters, not politicking. I’m talking about politics that listens to what is really going on, that’s at the service of the poor, not the kind that’s holed up in huge buildings with large hallways.\n\nI’m speaking of the politics that’s concerned about the unemployed, and knows full well how sad a Sunday can be when Monday is just one more day not being able to work.\n\nIf we look at it this way, politics is much more noble than it appears.\n\nLet’s be grateful for the many politicians who carry out their duties with a will to serve, not of power, who put all their efforts toward the common good.\n\nHere’s the papal video with English subtitles: Pope’s August prayer intention: For political leaders – Vatican News"
