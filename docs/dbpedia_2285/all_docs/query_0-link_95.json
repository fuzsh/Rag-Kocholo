        "text": "(19) And now, standing at the foot of the Cross, Mary is the witness, humanly speaking, of the complete negation of these words. On that wood of the Cross her Son hangs in agony as one condemned. He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows . . . he was despised, and we esteemed him not: as one destroyed (cf. Is. 53:3-5). How great, how heroic then is the obedience of faith shown by Mary in the face of Gods unsearchable judgments! How completely she abandons herself to God without reserve, offering the full assent of the intellect and the will to him whose ways are inscrutable(cf. Rom. 11:33)! And how powerful too is the action of grace in her soul, how all-pervading is the influence of the Holy Spirit and of his light and power! Through this faith Mary is perfectly united with Christ in his self-emptying. For Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men: precisely on Golgotha humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross (cf. Phil. 2:5-8). At the foot of the Cross Mary shares through faith in the shocking mystery of this self-emptying. This is perhaps the deepest kenosisof faith in human history. Through faith the Mother shares in the death of her Son, in his redeeming death; but in contrast with the faith of the disciples who fled, hers was far more enlightened. On Golgotha, Jesus through the Cross definitively confirmed that he was the sign of contradiction foretold by Simeon. At the same time, there were also fulfilled on Golgotha the words which Simeon had addressed to Mary: and a sword will pierce through your own soul also. Yes, truly blessed is she who believed!\n\n(21) At Cana in Galilee there is shown only one concrete aspect of human need, apparently a small on and of little importance (They have no wine). But it has a symbolic value: this coming to the aid of human needs means, at the same time, bringing those needs within the radius of Christs messianic mission and salvific power. Thus there is a mediation: Mary places herself between her Son and mankind in the reality of their wants, needs and sufferings. She puts herself in the middle, that is to say she acts as a mediatrix not as an outsider, bon as mother. She knows that as such she can point out to her son the needs of mankind, and in fact, she has the rightto do so. Her mediation is thus in the nature of intercession: Mary intercedesfor mankind. And that is not all. As a mother she also wishes the messianic power of her Son to be manifested, that salvific power of his which is meant to help man in his misfortunes, to free him from the evil which in various forms and degrees weighs heavily upon his life\n\n(24) The words uttered by Jesus from the Cross signify that the motherhood of her who bore Christ finds a new continuation in the Church and through the Church, symbolized and represented by John. In this way, she who as the one full of gracewas brought into the mystery of Christ in order to be his Mother and thus the Holy Mother of God, through the Church remains in that mystery as the womanspoken of by the Book of Genesis (3:15) at the beginning and by the Apocalypse (12:1) at the end of the history of salvation. In accordance with the eternal plan of Providence, Marys divine motherhood is to be poured out upon the Church, as indicated by statements of Tradition, according to which Marys motherhood of the Church is the reflection and extension of the motherhood of the Son of God.\n\n(26) In a sense her journey of faith is longer. The Holy Spirit had already come down upon her and she became his faithful spouse at the Annunciation, welcoming the Word of the true God, offering the full submission of intellect and will . . . and freely assenting to the truth revealed by him, indeed abandoning herself totally to God through the obedience of faith, whereby she replied to the angel: Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.The journey of faith made by Mary, whom we see praying in the Upper Room, is thus longer than that of the others gathered there. Mary goes before them, leads the wayfor them. The moment of Pentecost in Jerusalem had been prepared for by the moment of the Annunciation in Nazareth, as well as by the Cross. In the Upper Room Marys journey meets the Churchs journey of faith."
