        "text": "Although written over eight hundred years ago, the hymn “Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee” contains timeless, biblical truths that still touch the worshipper’s heart today. Adoration for God flows sweet and pure from each word, line, and stanza and builds to a crescendo of praise midway through the hymn with beautiful descriptions of Jesus’s character and wondrous acts of mercy.\n\nWho Wrote the Original Lyrics for 'Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee'?\n\nScholars believe that Bernard of Clairvaux penned “Dulcis Jesus Memoria,” the 42-stanza poem that “Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee” was derived from. While the earliest manuscripts don’t indicate a prescribed use for Bernard’s poem, church history shows it being used as a hymn as early as the 13th century. Since then, many variations on the poem have been written, including the translated and edited version found in today’s English hymnals.\n\nBernard of Clairvaux was born near Dijon, Burgundy, at his father’s castle in 1091. Although he enjoyed all the advantages of station, wealth, and physical beauty, Bernard chose to forsake his privilege and pursue the ascetic life of a monk.\n\nInspired by night visions of his mother, Aleth, who died when Bernard was young, he entered the Cistercian abbey of Citeaux at 21 years old. A few years later, Bernard was so advanced in his spiritual development that he was sent from the Benedictine monastery with 12 other monks to establish his own monastery at Clairvaux. Despite multiple opportunities to achieve a higher status for himself because of his eloquence and power of persuasion, Bernard remained at Clairvaux until he died in 1153.\n\nApart from being recognized as a saint by the Catholic church, Bernard is known for being involved with the Knights Templar, co-initiating the Second Crusade, and advising kings and dignitaries. His spiritual writings left a mark on Europe’s religious community for centuries. Today, many of Bernard’s sermons, letters, and poems are still known worldwide. These works offer insight into the history of his era and give us a glimpse of Bernard’s language, logic, and theology.\n\nWho Translated 'Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee'?\n\nIn 1849, Edward Caswall translated select verses from Bernard’s hymn to appear in the Lyra Catholica, a Catholic hymnal. Caswall later translated the entire hymn to include in his book The Masque of Mary, and Other Poems, which to this day is considered an important cultural work.\n\nCaswall’s attention to detail, poetic ability, and overall faithfulness to the original texts made him one of the most sought-after translators of his time. Modern hymnals contain more of Caswall’s Latin hymn translations than any other.\n\nBefore graduating from Oxford, Caswall used a pseudonym to publish The Art of Pluck, a satire about the ways of the careless college student (Oxford still sells it today). After graduation, Caswall was ordained as an Anglican priest, but in 1847, he and his wife, Louisa, left the Anglican church to convert to Roman Catholicism. Because Caswall was a man of independent means, he spent a great deal of time writing and translating hymns from Latin and other languages.\n\nAfter Caswall’s wife contracted cholera and died in 1850, he joined the Catholic priesthood at the Congregation of the Oratory of St Philip Neri in Birmingham. There he spent the remainder of his life devoted to clerical duties, writing, and caring for the poor.\n\n“Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee” is one of three of Caswall’s translations that are often still seen in English hymnals, along with “O Sacred Head,” “Now Wounded,” and “Jesus, Thou Joy of Loving Hearts.” His original translation of Bernard’s hymns remained loyal to Roman Catholic church teachings, so they received doctrinal editing before being incorporated into Protestant hymnals.\n\nWho was the Composer of Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee?\n\nJohn B. Dykes composed the musical arrangement for “Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee” and published the composition in the 1866 edition of Grey’s Hymnal for Use in the English Church. Dykes titled the tune “St. Agnes” in honor of a Christian woman martyred in 304 A.D. when she refused to accept a nobleman’s marriage proposal. The story of St. Agnes’s devotion to Christ left a lasting impression on Dykes. According to the Psalter Hymnal Handbook, St. Agnes replied to her suiter’s proposal, “I am already engaged to Christ, to Him alone I keep my troth.”\n\nWhat Biblical Themes are in 'Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee'?\n\nEchoing the worshipful devotion found in David’s Psalms, “Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee” uses simple language to declare our Savior’s praiseworthy attributes. The hymn invites the worshipper to surrender every worldly care and celebrate the One who gave His life for us.\n\nBernard of Clairvaux believed in loving God, for who He is, without limitation. This conviction rang true throughout Bernard’s life, whether he was worshiping, teaching, serving, or writing. In one of his most famous books, still in circulation today, Bernard describes his passion for loving God in a way that beautifully illustrates the heart behind his hymn “Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee.”\n\n“The motive for loving God is God himself. He is as well the efficient cause as the final object of our love. He gives the occasion for love, he creates the affection, he brings the desire to good effect… Our love is prepared and rewarded by His. He loves us first, out of His great tenderness; then we are bound to repay him with love; and we are permitted to cherish exultant hopes in him.” — On Loving God\n\nThe Lyrics to Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee\n\nJesus, the very thought of Thee\n\nWith sweetness fills the breast;\n\nBut sweeter far Thy face to see,\n\nAnd in Thy presence rest.\n\nNor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,\n\nNor can the memory find\n\nA sweeter sound than Thy blest Name,\n\nO Saviour of mankind!\n\nO Hope of every contrite heart,\n\nO Joy of all the meek,\n\nTo those who fall, how kind Thou art!\n\nHow good to those who seek!\n\nBut what to those who find? Ah, this\n\nNor tongue nor pen can show;\n\nThe love of Jesus, what it is,\n\nNone but His loved ones know.\n\nJesus, our only joy be Thou,\n\nAs Thou our prize will be;\n\nJesus be Thou our glory now,\n\nAnd through eternity.\n\nO Jesus, King most wonderful\n\nThou Conqueror renowned,\n\nThou sweetness most ineffable\n\nIn Whom all joys are found!\n\nWhen once Thou visitest the heart,\n\nThen truth begins to shine,\n\nThen earthly vanities depart,\n\nThen kindles love divine.\n\nO Jesus, light of all below,\n\nThou fount of living fire,\n\nSurpassing all the joys we know,\n\nAnd all we can desire.\n\nJesus, may all confess Thy Name,\n\nThy wondrous love adore,\n\nAnd, seeking Thee, themselves inflame\n\nTo seek Thee more and more.\n\nThee, Jesus, may our voices bless,\n\nThee may we love alone,\n\nAnd ever in our lives express\n\nThe image of Thine own.\n\nO Jesus, Thou the beauty art\n\nOf angel worlds above;\n\nThy Name is music to the heart,\n\nInflaming it with love.\n\nCelestial Sweetness unalloyed,\n\nWho eat Thee hunger still;\n\nWho drink of Thee still feel a void\n\nWhich only Thou canst fill.\n\nO most sweet Jesus, hear the sighs\n\nWhich unto Thee we send;\n\nTo Thee our inmost spirit cries;\n\nTo Thee our prayers ascend.\n\nAbide with us, and let Thy light\n\nShine, Lord, on every heart;\n\nDispel the darkness of our night;\n\nAnd joy to all impart.\n\nJesus, our love and joy to Thee,\n\nThe virgin’s holy Son,\n\nAll might and praise and glory be,\n\nWhile endless ages run.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nWho Wrote “Alas, and Did My Savior Bleed”?\n\nThe Powerful Story Behind the Hymn 'I Love to Tell the Story'\n\nWho Wrote the Hymn 'Bless the Lord O My Soul'?\n\nWho Wrote The Hymn 'No One Ever Cared For Me Like Jesus'?\n\nPhoto Credit: Getty Images/LindaMarieB"
