Sono queste le pesanti accuse da parte di diverse suore della Comunità Loyola contro padre Marko Ivan Rupnik, gesuita, artista religioso, teologo e consigliere di papa Francesco. I fatti sarebbero accaduti sin dai primi anni 90. Non è escluso che il potente prelato sia stato già condannato dal tribunale della Compagnia di Gesù, ma sia i gesuiti che il Vaticano stanno provando a non far trapelare nulla. Sarebbe questa la trasparenza e la tolleranza zero invocata da Bergoglio?\n\nNegli ambienti esterni alla Chiesa cattolica il nome del gesuita padre Marko Ivan Rupnik potrebbe dire poco o nulla. All’interno del mondo ecclesiastico la questione è decisamente diversa.

There’s the talking-head driven journalistic approach, in which the story and its analysis are laid out, beat by beat. There’s also the more lurid approach that films about cults and crime can employ, with re-enactments and ominous musical cues.\n\nBut a third way — and the one that Emily Kassie and Julian Brave NoiseCat take in “Sugarcane” (in theaters), to their great credit — is to invite the audience to dwell alongside those affected by the story, letting their experiences and emotions guide the film.

The suits, while voluminous, raise questions about how much new information is revealed. Many of the accusations are vague and date back decades. Some contain errors. Many use partial names or nicknames of the accused. The lawsuits appear to be the fruits of an ongoing ad campaign targeting Missourians who may have been abused.\n\n“Good grief,” said the Rev.

For many children, attendance at these schools was compulsory, forcing them to travel far away from their homes, where they were systematically separated from their language and culture and suffered various forms of abuse.
