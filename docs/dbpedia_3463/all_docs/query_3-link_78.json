        "meta_description": "Abstract In Argentina's Gran Chaco, indigenous Guaraní men play football assiduously. This article explores how the game articulates with their sense of masculinity. Historical engagements in the Chaco's extractive labor markets have shaped understandings of masculinity that emphasize strength, courage, and provision. However, the decline of the region's extractive industries has made these forms of masculinity unattainable for young men. Games of football, including betting and drinking off the pitch, create bounded and embodied experiences that allow young men to experience fantasies of productivity and collectivity while disavowing everyday experiences of unemployment. These fantasies are particularly striking because they misrecognize women's growing role as providers even as they sustain an illusion of autonomous masculine politics that elides ties of kinship and dependency.",

        "text": "Riding on his beat-up moped, Hector pulled up beneath the shade of an old carob tree. I hopped on behind him, and we sped off down the dirt road in the direction of the settlement's football pitch. On the pitch, two visiting teams from neighboring Guaraní settlements had begun the first match of a three-team tournament. This would be my footballing debut with the young men of the settlement I call Aguararenta, and I was worried that I might fail to meet their expectations.\n\nIf I was nervous before the game, my heart sank when I saw the speed, dexterity, and physicality of the game that preceded our own. It was too late to back down, though, so I dutifully began warming up. To my surprise, no one else engaged in this kind of pre-game preparation. Bemused, I returned to the shaded spot near the sidelines where my teammates sat and found that they were sharing a carton of wine and carefully picking out leaves of coca from a green plastic bag. “Don't you warm up?” I asked. Several of the men exchanged amused looks, and Hector held up the carton. “Wine gives courage,” he explained with a grin. Judging by the tenor of the game that preceded our own, courage was just what I was going to need.\n\nI had not been living in the Chaco long, but I had already found that football was a central activity for the young men who lived in the indigenous communities that dot the border between Argentina and Bolivia. As in most Guaraní settlements in the region, young men played football every day of the week. They avidly participated in weekend matches against other Guaraní communities and enthusiastically joined in formal tournaments organized by the municipal government.\n\nFor the most part, the men who played football were chronically unemployed. Without a steady source of income, they relied on their parental families for food and shelter and, in particular, on their female relatives who benefited from state-sponsored cash transfer programs and were more likely to be employed (Diz 2018). Like most of Argentina's indigenous populations, the Guaraní have typically been excluded from and neglected by the state's nation-building projects (Gordillo 2006). Nonetheless, plantation bosses, logging crews, and oil and gas subcontractors often sought Guaraní men as a source of cheap yet dependable labor. Given their access to the Chaco's labor markets, men have historically played the roles of household providers and local political leaders. Moreover, the unskilled type of labor they typically carried out has also informed a sense of masculinity that is grounded in ideas about physical strength and endurance. The stagnation of the Chaco's commodity frontiers has thus impacted men's ability to live up to expected gender roles.\n\nMy friend Hector was a case in point. By his own account, he had once been a “hell of a player” (un señor jugador). At the age of 16, he had accompanied his father to work on a lemon plantation or finca. He was too young to receive a wage on the books, but the bosses paid him to play for the finca team. Despite his adolescent prowess, Hector struggled to find employment during my time in Aguararenta. This was a blow to his sense of self and particularly to his dreams of securing a brick-and-mortar house for his younger sister. It also made him fear for his prospects of ever having a family of his own. To make matters worse, he had contracted tuberculosis, and his strength and lung capacity were greatly diminished. The disease imperiled his ability to perform the sorts of physically demanding labor that Guaraní men hoped to engage in.\n\nBuilding on cases like Hector's, this article describes the conditions of structural unemployment and marginality that young indigenous men in South America's Gran Chaco face and analyzes how they create and negotiate forms of masculine fantasy through the game of football. I argue that football provides a space in which men can inhabit masculine fantasies of productive prowess and collectivity that disavow the off-the-field realities of mass unemployment and surplus labor. These fantasies have become particularly powerful because they misrecognize the growing importance of female labor for household subsistence (Diz 2018, 2022) and sustain an illusion of laboring productivity beyond the needs of dependent relatives.\n\nThis article draws on archival research, oral histories, interviews, genealogical data, and participant observation, including almost daily participation in football matches (as both player and spectator), during 17 months of fieldwork between 2012 and 2017. After positioning the argument in relation to broader ideas of gender, play, and fantasy, the article contextualizes Guaraní labor histories and explains how their experiences have given rise to a particular understanding of masculinity that is currently in crisis. It then considers how the game is played in relaxed, informal matches that occasion a sense of antagonistic conviviality among equals, before exploring how more formal games become spaces that showcase strength and courage as masculine virtues. Betting, socializing, and forming footballing collectivities are crucial to the experiences of football, ensuring a sense of solidarity and productivity that remains important once the match ends. Finally, I explore football's masculine fantasies in relation to gendered and generational household relations and the challenges they pose to masculinist ideas of provision and labor.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI am indebted to Max Bolt, Natalia Buitron, Ana Gutierrez, Megnaa Mehtta, Deborah James, Harry Walker, Meadhbh McIvor, Megan Laws, Silvia Hirsch, Matt Wilde, and Hans Steinmüller for their help, suggestions, and encouragement at various stages.
