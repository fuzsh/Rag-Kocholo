        "text": "The Awful Winged Thing was originally going to be the eighteenth episode in Tremors: The Series.\n\nPlot Summary[]\n\nIt was to be a straight-forward Tremors monster tale, but the exact opposite of the normal formula, death from above. The mysterious creature swoops down on sheep and people. Val and Earl first try to trap it by dressing as sheep while Burt tries to bring it down with a homemade heat-seeking rocket. Eventually, the perfect solution turns out to be â€“ sky fishing! They \"troll\" the skies from their pick-up, flying lamb-chop bait from an over-sized kite. When the creature is hooked, Earl, strapped into a dentist chair in the pick-up's bed, reels it in on deep-sea fishing gear. This is remarkably similar to what they did with Messerschmitt in Blast from the Past.\n\nKnown Cast[]\n\nMichael Gross Burt Gummer Fred Ward Earl Bassett Kevin Bacon Val McKee"
