I just checked the NP website for Chaco and, despite have some facilities for RV's, they mentioned that RV's are not \"recommended\" on the roads into it.  \n \nOne difference is that now now I have my own RV (a small, high MPG Mercedes Sprinter based C class) which has been known to lose various parts on washboard roads shorter than the one into Chaco.",
