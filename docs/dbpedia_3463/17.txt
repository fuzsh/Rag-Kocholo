Story

An army in inhospitable territory between Bolivia and Paraguay seeks the enemy â€“ and finds the biggest adversary in itself. A war film in which barely a shot is fired. The Chaco plateau, 1934. Bolivia is at war with Paraguay. A group of indigenous Bolivian soldiers are led by the gruff German commandant Hans Kundt. The European refuses to accept that their mission is long since without purpose. Every day, every exhausting march and hastily erected camp brings greater hunger, isolation and despair. Like shadows, Kundt and his men roam the hell of Chaco, a murderous world of dust and silence.
