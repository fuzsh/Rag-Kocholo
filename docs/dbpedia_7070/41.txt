1. Who is Iris Runge?

Iris Runge was a German physicist and mathematician who lived from 1888 to 1966. She is best known for her contributions to numerical mathematics, particularly her work on the Runge-Kutta method.

2. What is the Runge-Kutta method?

The Runge-Kutta method is a numerical algorithm used for solving ordinary differential equations. It was developed independently by German mathematicians Carl Runge and Martin Wilhelm Kutta in the early 1900s, and later refined by Iris Runge.

3. What was Iris Runge's relationship with Arnold Sommerfeld?

Iris Runge and Arnold Sommerfeld were colleagues and collaborators at the University of Munich. Sommerfeld, a renowned physicist, recognized Runge's mathematical abilities and encouraged her to contribute to his research on theoretical physics.

4. What was the significance of Iris Runge's work on the Runge-Kutta method?

Runge's contributions to the Runge-Kutta method allowed it to be applied to a wider range of differential equations. Her work also helped to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the method, making it a widely used tool in computational science.

5. Why is Iris Runge not as well-known as other scientists of her time?

Unfortunately, due to the gender norms and discrimination of her time, Iris Runge's contributions to mathematics and physics were often overlooked or attributed to her male colleagues. It is only in recent years that her work has been recognized and celebrated.
