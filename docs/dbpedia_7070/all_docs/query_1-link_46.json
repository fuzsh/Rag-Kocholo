Twenty-six math-enthusiastic girls from high schools around Bielefeld were invited to get an impression of the daily life of a Mathematician or Economist. They started with a scavenger hunt through the library where they were challenged to find books in different categories like books by a female author or books written before 1900. Next, Professor Claudia Alfes answered their questions about what it is like to be a Mathematics professor and invited them to attend the start of her lecture on linear algebra. For the most part of the day, the girls were guided through a research question in a small group, each supervised by a female doctoral student. They discovered the mathematical phenomena of the card games Set and Dobble, calculated an ecological footprint, were introduced to best-reply strategies and proofs by induction in the game theory problem „Nim“ and discussed strategic as well as behavioral aspects of the Repeated Prisoners’ Dilemma. After lunch at mensa, each group presented their research questions and results to the others, in the spirit of attending a conference. The day ended with cake, lemonade, and playing with the games the other girls had worked on and presented.\n\n25.04.2024, YWTS\n\nFor the third time in a row, YWTS participated in Girls’Day, a Germany-wide initiative aimed at promoting STEM professions to girls.

At the Weierstraß Insititute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics (WIAS), they attended the opening of the Iris Runge Program, a program designed to promote the career development of female scientists and enable them to remain in science. Mathematics historian Dr. habil. Renate Tobies talked about about the namesake Iris Runge who was one of the first female mathematics professors in Germany, and the two female postdocs supported by the program, Dr. Jin Yan and Dr. Anieza Maltsi, gave an overview of their research on random dynamical systems and on photoacoustic imaging. The day at WIAS ended with a visit to the exhibition “Women of Mathematics from around the World” and discussions with institute members. On the next day, the group was invited to a tour at Deutscher Bundestag and to have lunch with Dr. Anne-Monika Spallek, MdB (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen). She shared how her PhD in mathematics helped her in her work as a politician, and asked how politicians like her could support young female researchers. The trip also allowed for a stroll through Berlin along monuments in Mitte and Kreuzberg, including the Holocaust Memorial and East Side Gallery.\n\n18.-19.03.2024, YWTS\n\nA group of YWTS students, doctoral candidates, and PostDocs went on a two-day excursion to Berlin.

In winter term 23/24, we offered a 1-day voice training to students, doctoral candidates, and PostDocs. In the morning, we learned about functions of the voice, goals of voice work, and vocal hygiene and did physical exercises to get a feeling for the position of the larynx, increase the resonance of our voice, and to learn supportive breathing techniques. In the afternoon, we continued with exercises for a good speaking posture, and how to find your perfect pitch where your voice is most clear and most effortless at the same time. The workshop closed with tips for emergencies like when your voice is strained or when you are nervous about giving a talk.\n\nThe training was hosted by the very friendly and enthusiastic Janin Schröder-Hoppe and Sabrina Dehne from Logopädie Lemgo. Thanks to their many years of collaboration with the PEP network, they know how to provide targeted support for female scientists and students.\n\n08.01.24, YWTS\n\nEvery semester, YWTS offers a soft skill training.

She was interviewed for Uni Bielefeld’s website about her research and her vita. With respect to being a women in academia she shared:\n\n‘Mathematics is still a male-dominated field. In my own studies, I was in my fourth year before a female lecturer taught me for the first time,’ says Alfes-Neumann. She thinks it’s important to better connect women in science: ‘That will provide more opportunities to also talk about personal experiences—for example, what it’s like to become a mother as a postdoc.’\n\nYou can read the whole article here:\n\nhttps://aktuell.uni-bielefeld.de/2023/08/29/magic-equations/?lang=en\n\n29.08.23, BIELEFELD UNIVERSITY\n\nMathematics professor Dr. Claudia Alfes-Neumann initiated the YWTS networks series “Coffee for female mathematicians”.

In small groups, invited speakers and participants of the conference as well as YWTS member shared how they dealt with moments of self-doubt and how they made tough decision. A variety of coping strategies was discussed; with the most popular ones being asking for help and discussing the situation with friends or family. The workshop closed with everyone naming one positive and distinguishing quality about themselves. It was nice to see the diversity in the answers, e.g., being creative, outgoing, brave, self-organized, confident in talking in front of others, having received great feedback in the past, relying on a good network, and being able to do what you enjoy: working in academia.\n\n12.07.23, YWTS\n\nDuring SFB 1283’s Conference on “SPDEs, Optimal Control and Mean Field Games’’, YWTS coordinated a workshop on ‘”Taming Uncertainty: How to Address Self-Doubt as a Female Scientist’’. In small groups, invited speakers and participants of the conference as well as YWTS member shared how they dealt with moments of self-doubt and how they made tough decision. A variety of coping strategies was discussed; with the most popular ones being asking for help and discussing the situation with friends or family.

In a guided discussion, Toulolpe Fadina, PhD (University of Essex) and Prof. Dr. Maren Schmeck (Bielefeld University) reflected upon their past and what advice they would like to give to their younger selves. They shared how they made career decisions, and which resources helped them to do so. The session closed with thoughts on how academia could become a more supporting environment for women. In the evening, the discussion was continued over dinner at Bernstein.\n\n03.07.23, YWTS\n\nDuring the SFB 1283 summer school \"Risk and Uncertainty in Economics, Insurance and Finance\", YWTS organized a mentoring session around the theme \"Talking to my Younger Self\", directed at female summer school participants and YWTS members.

At the side of (post)doctoral students, they immersed into the life of a young scientist for one day. First thing in the morning, girls and researchers got to know each other by sharing why they are passionate about maths. Next, the girls were kindly invited to ask questions to Jr.-Prof. Lukas Kühne and attend the beginning of his lecture on Linear Algebra I. The girls then spent most of the day in groups of 3, supervised by 1 or 2 YWTS members, to puzzle over a variety of mathematical problems in a playful way. They conducted experiments on probability by throwing dice, investigated the Birthday Paradoxon, and played with the card game Set and the tower of Hanoi to question and understand mathematical patterns in their everyday lives. Finally, each group presented their results to the others to simulate attending a conference. In that spirit, the day ended with some networking while eating cake and playing the games that had been explored during the day.\n\n27.04.23, BIELEFELD UNIVERSITY\n\nFor Girls’ Day 2023, 14 math-enthusiastic high school girls from Bielefeld and the surrounding area visited Bielefeld University to gain an insight into theoretical sciences.

She accepted the invitation to join YWTS members for a Meet & Greet over coffee on the occasion of her visit to Bielefeld University. She guided us through her academic path and shared her experiences as a researcher at Oxford University and as a working new-mom. One of the most interesting stories was why she decided to do a PhD in economics after obtaining a PhD in mathematics. The informal discussion ended on a high note: Prof. Baldwin’s experiences as a women in male dominated fields are consistently positive throughout her entire academic career.\n\n04.04.23, YWTS\n\nThe British mathematician and economist Prof. Elizabeth Baldwin presented her paper „Implementing Walrasian Equilibrium: the Language of Product-Mix Auctions“ in the BiGSEM Economics Seminar on April 4th, 2023.
