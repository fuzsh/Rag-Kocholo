        "text": "I switched my field to particle physics after I graduated with a B.E. degree. Ever since then, I have been studied quarkonium at the Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing, neutrino at the Max-Planck-Institut Fuer Physik in Munich, and dark matter at the Institute for the Phyiscs and Mathematics of the Universe, Tokyo. I became an assistant professor at the University of South Dakota in 2014, and an associate professor in 2020. I am developing novel particle and radiation detectors searching for rare physics processes beyond the scope of the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\nI have taught the following classes over years: Classical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, Electrodynamics, Nuclear and Particle Physics, Radiation Detection Technology, Computational Methods for Physicist, and Experimental Modern Physics, etc. I enthusiastically support undergraduate research activities. I have supervised a few undergraduates in writing their Honors Theses, more than a dozen in writing research proposals, most of them got funded by CURCS at USD and other supports. Students got chances to present their research activities in national wide conferences or events, including 2017 Posters on the Hill, Washington D.C., 2016 Quadrennial Physics Congress, Silicon Valley, 2016 APS DNP Meeting, Vancouver, and 2016 APS Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics, etc. I provide research credits or stipend for undergraduate students in semesters or summers. I also provide guidance for those who are interested in applying for undergraduate grants or scholarships by themselves. My students obtained NASA scholarship, UDiscover summer scholarship, and various travel awards in recent years.\n\nI am passionate in developing novel particle and radiation detectors for neutrino physics, dark matter search and civil uses. I am a member of COHERENT, a collaboration of 21 institutes from 4 countries searching for dark matter particles created in accelarator, sterile neutrinos, and non-standard neutrino interactions, etc. through Coherent Elastic neutrino-Nucleus Scatterings (CEvNS). I am a member of LEGEND, a collaboration of 44 institutes from 14 countries searching for neutrinoless double beta decays of Ge-76 using high-purity Ge (HPGe) detectors. I am a member of DUNE, a collaboration of 162 institutes from 30 countries searching for CP- violations in neutrino oscillations. I am a former member of XMASS, the largest liquid xenon dark matter experiment in Japan. I am a former member of GERDA, a HPGe detector based neutrinoless double beta decay experiment that holds the most stringent lower limit of the effective Majorana neutrino mass to date. I am also a former member of BESII, a high energy physics detector at the Beijing Electron-Position Collider, China."
