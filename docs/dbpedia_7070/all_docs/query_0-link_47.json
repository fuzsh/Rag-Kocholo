Co-Investigators in Poland, Switzerland, Russia, and Germany, funded by national agencies, contributed significantly to IBEX hardware, data analyses, and data interpretation.\n\nPoland\n\nRepresented by the group around Prof. Dr. Maciej Bzowski, Polish investigators provided outstanding support in determining the accuracy of the pointing of IBEX-lo by using the Star Sensor data. This is of extreme importance for determining the interstellar gas flow parameters. This group also supported the IBEX-lo data analysis for the interstellar flow by performing test particle simulations. These calculations are considered as the third building block next to analytic considerations and data analysis to provide reliable interstellar flow parameters.\n\nGrants from the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education\n\nNo N522 002 31/0902 System of modeling, visualization, and distribution of data from the IBEX-Lo instrument on the NASA space mission Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX)\n\nGrants managed by the Polish National Science Center\n\nNo NS-1260-11-09 Science and technology involvement of Poland in the space mission IBEX\n\nNo N-N203-513-038What does IBEX see -- an attempt to interpret first results from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer\n\nPersonnel:\n\nDr. Maciej Bzowski\n\nDr. Eng.

Wurz and Prof. Dr. P. Bochsler at the University of Bern, contributed substantially to the understanding of geometric factor and onboard data of IBEX-lo. Their scientific contributions have helped to characterize interstellar hydrogen, Deuterium, as well as the Ne/O ratio. They also contributed to the accurate determination of the interstellar flow parameter by performing Monte Carlo simulations and applying maximum likelihood analysis studies.\n\nFunding Agency:\n\nSwiss Space Office (PRODEX Grant):\n\nFunded proposals\n\nGrant: Imaging of the heliospheric-interstellar gas boundary with energetic neutrals\n\nFunding Agency:\n\nSwiss National Science Foundation:\n\nFunded proposals\n\nGrant: Investigation of the solar system with in-situ mass spectrometry and remote sensing techniques\n\nRussia\n\nRepresented by Prof. Dr. Vladislav V. Izmodenov and collaborators, supported the IBEX-lo data analysis by modeling of the heliospheric interface, which is the result of the solar wind interaction with the interstellar medium. They developed a kinetic-gasdynamic and a kinetic Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic (MHD) model to investigate the stochastic acceleration model for pickup ions and the supersonic solar wind ions and in the heliosheath. These models are of particular interest to understand the energy spectrum of the Energetic Neutral Atoms (ENAs).\n\nFunding Agency:\n\nRussian Foundation of Basic Research\n\nFunded proposals\n\n\"3D structure of the heliospheric boundary: analyses of heliospheric ENA fluxes and backscattered solar Lyman-alpha by using kinetic-gasdynamic models\"\n\nGermany\n\nRepresented by the University of Bonn by Prof. Dr. Hans J. Fahr and Dr. H. Fichtner at the University of Bochum and their scientific teams, supported the IBEX mission with theoretical considerations for possible source regions and populations of the IBEX ribbon. Using their theoretical models they provided estimates of the energetic neutral atom fluxes from the heliosheath and their variation during the activity phase of the solar cycle.\n\nFunding Agency:\n\nDFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft):\n\nFunded proposals:\n\n- Si-1550/2-1: Studying the ribbon feature observed by IBEX in the outer heliosphere.\n\n- Si-1550/2-2: Interpretation of the ribbon-like ENA feature oberved by IBEX.\n\nFunding from DFG for IBEX Workshops:\n\n(a) Workshop \"Cosmic Rays and the Heliospheric Plasma Environment\", see http://helio_cr.tp4.rub.de/Bochum/\n\n(b) IBEX SWT & Workshop: \"Three Years of Observations with IBEX - What did\n\nwe learn about the Outer Heliosphere?\" see http://helio_cr.tp4.rub.de/BadHonnef/\n\nPotential Future Guest Investigations\n\nGuest investigator programs remain a vital component of the IBEX mission. The success of the previous IBEX science investigations is based on effective data analysis combined with numerical modeling and theoretical considerations. The fundamental science objectives of the IBEX mission combine solar, astro- and heliospheric physics. It is vital that we continue outer heliospheric guest investigations into the complex myriad of kinetic processes, ionization, charge exchange, ion acceleration and filtration with global heliospheric structures. Guest investigations provide a unique means of supporting projects that cut across active missions such as Voyager, SDO, and STEREO and of course IBEX. Potential future guest investigations of particular importance to IBEX include:\n\nHeavy Interstellar Atoms in the Heliosphere\n\nDistributions of heavy atoms that include secondary atoms and even some ENAs can be computed at various points inside the heliosphere. This will enable the Oxygen and Helium data from IBEX to be carefully compared to models that include the full heliospheric filtration effects.\n\nENA Fluxes for IBEX Derived from a Kinetic Treatment of Atoms and Pickup Ions\n\nUtilizing a combination of advanced MHD models of the heliosphere and detailed kinetic models provides fundamental insights into IBEX-observed energy distributions.\n\nInfluences of Turbulence and Physical Processes on Multiple Scales\n\nProcesses that occur on a wide-range of scales (ion kinetic to MHD scale) influence IBEX ENA maps. For example, the heliosheath proton distributions are determined in part by their interactions at the TS. Global MHD, Hybrid and full particle codes are proven to be extremely useful tools to understand the shape and the evolution of ion, electron and neutral distributions. Exploiting these techniques to understand observed ENA distributions provides fundamental insights into kinetic physics of the outer heliosphere.\n\nLetters of Commitment for future E/PO collaborations\n\nSTANFORD UNIVERSITY\n\nW.W. HANSEN EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS LABORATORY\n\nFebruary 1, 2013\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nIRIS E/PO intends to contribute, as funding allows, to the continuation of the Heliophysics Educator Ambassador program. The next iteration of the HEA program will target informal (i.e. museum, afterschool, etc.) educators and will be led by IBEX. This will be a collaborative effort among several heliophysics E/PO missions: IBEX, CINDI, THEMIS/ARTEMIS, RHESSI, TIMED, Voyager, MMS, Van Allen Probes, Solar Probe Plus, SDO, and IRIS. I look forward to having the opportunity to work with the entire Heliophysics mission collaboration on the HEA program.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDeborah Scherrer Director, Stanford Solar Center\n\nStanford Solar Center http://solar-center.stanford.edu 452 Lomita Mall, Room 134 Stanford, CA 94305-4085 650-723-1495 [email protected]\n\n123 Publications (Rev. 12/3/12) and 1435 Citations (Rev 2/11/13)\n\nTechnical Status\n\nIBEX is in excellent health with no hardware, software or safety risks and none on the horizon. It is low cost and low risk. There are no limitations to future science investigations.\n\nSpacecraft Bus & Payload Health\n\nDetailed spacecraft subsystem analysis prior to the 2011 orbit change maneuvers showed that the spacecraft bus subsystems exhibited less degradation than pre-launch predicts. Two sets of degradation analyses were performed, one internal analysis by spacecraft systems and subsystems engineers at Orbital and one independent analysis by Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). Both sets of analysis agreed that 1) less degradation was apparent than in pre-launch predicts and 2) the largest life-limiting factors are radiation and battery loading due to long eclipses.\n\nAfter textbook execution of maneuvers in June 2011, the spacecraft subsystems and consumables were re-evaluated, and it was found that nothing in the state of the spacecraft would prevent operation for at least another decade. Additionally, the new IBEX Extended Mission (EM) orbit extends longevity by addressing the major life-limiting factors. All spacecraft bus subsystems were again evaluated at the end of 2012, and the study confirmed previous results: the spacecraft including all subsystems should operate for more than a decade.\n\nThe IBEX payload is also operating nominally and is taking ground-breaking science data. IBEX-Hi operations have remained stable over the course of the mission with small detector voltage changes due to variations in gain and operational optimization. IBEX-Lo has had two operational changes over the course of the mission. The first occurred in low earth orbit operations (LEOps) early in the mission when the positive collimator was rendered unusable. The scientists and engineers worked together to revise the negative collimator settings to do the job of both collimators, resulting in no data degradation. The second occurred in mid-2012 when the Post Acceleration (PAC) overcurrent protection was tripped three times. After detailed analysis including scien­tists, engineers and independent specialists, the Lo team reduced the PAC operating voltage. This has negligible effect on the collection efficiency of neutral hydrogen and helium from the heliosphere and the interstellar medium. The IBEX-Hi and IBEX-Lo data set throughout the mission has far exceeded requirements and has enabled ground-breaking science discoveries. Detailed payload analysis was also performed at the end of 2012. Degradation continues to be lower than pre-launch predicts, and an additional decade or more of operations is fully expected.\n\nWeb Table 1. IBEX hardware and software are ready for operation throughout the EM and beyond. Spacecraft status by subsystem shown in the table below. E = Excellent, VG = Very Good, G = Good, F= Fair, P = Poor.\n\nSubsystem Health Description Longevity CEU E Continues to operate nominally.

Less degradation than pre-launch predict. Trending indicates 10+ additional years of operations expected Spacecraft Software E Updated shortly after phase E began. No update since. N/A\n\nProjected Fuel Usage Schedule\n\nThe fuel usage schedule plot below projects fuel usage out until IBEX reaches its budgeted EOL fuel load. The trendline is a linear fit, and the 0.19 kg/year usage line is an estimate from prior propellant budget analyses. Using both estimates, the spacecraft will have enough fuel for 10 more years of operation. Following a linear fitted trendline, the spacecraft is projected to reach the EOL fuel load of 1.28 kg in the year 2038 (below). The 0.19 kg/year estimate is slightly more pessimistic, with an estimate to reach the EOL fuel load in 2033.\n\nRisk Analysis\n\nThe most recent yearly assessment of all IBEX spacecraft and instrument risks held three open risks, none of which threatens the successful operation of the spacecraft in IBEX EM. No hardware risks are being carried.\n\nWeb Figure 1. IBEX is fully ready for the EM. The IBEX Risk Matrix below shows two of the three risks held are green. The yellow risk is being actively pursued and a mitigation plan is nearing closure. None of the identified risks prohibit successful operation.\n\nWeb Table 2. IBEX carries three risks, none of which could prevent successful operation of the extended mission."
