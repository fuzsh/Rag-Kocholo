        "text": "Title: Asymptotic methods for lithium-ion battery models.\n\nSpeaker: Ferran Brosa Planella (University of Warwick) [link]\n\nTime: Thursday, 08.08.2024, 13:30\n\nLocation: WIAS-406\n\nLithium-ion batteries have become ubiquitous over the past decade, and they are called to play even a more important role with the electrification of vehicles. In order to design better and safer batteries and to manage them more efficiently, we need models than can predict the battery behaviour accurately and fast. However, in many cases these models are still posed in an ad hoc way, which makes them hard to extend and may lead to inconsistencies. In this talk we will see some examples on how asymptotic methods can be applied to obtain simple models that can be used in battery control and parameterisation.\n\nTitle: A posteriori error estimates for systems of hyperbolic conservation laws modeling compressible flows.\n\nSpeaker: Jan Giesselmann (Department of Mathematics, TU Darmstadt) [link]\n\nTime: Thursday, 18.07.2024, 15:00\n\nLocation: WIAS-406/Online (link on request from peschka{at}wias-berlin.de)\n\nHyperbolic conservation laws are a class of PDEs that have many applications, most notably in compressible fluid flows when viscosity is neglected. While these equations are successfully used by engineers in simulations, there are many open questions regarding their mathematical study. These are mostly driven by to the non-uniqueness of entropy solutions in multiple space dimensions but even in one space dimensions stability of solutions is challenging if one is to go beyond initial data that are small in BV.\n\nThe challenges in the mathematical analysis have lead to a situation where a variety of sophisticated numerical schemes exists and is successfully used in practice but the mathematical foundations of these methods are not as substantial as one would hope. This issue has been addressed by several authors in recent years and we plan plan to present what has been achieved in the field of a posteriori error estimates, i.e. explicit bounds for the error of the numerical solution that can be computed from the numerical solution.\n\nA fundamental building block of a posteriori error estimates are stability theories that allow to relate certain norms of residuals, i.e. quantities measuring by how much an approximate solution fails to satisfy the PDE, to certain norms of the error, i.e. the difference between numerical and exact solution. Examples of such stability theories include the classical relative entropy framework, the theory of shifts developed by Vasseur and coworkers and recent results by Bressan and coworkers.\n\nWe will describe these stability results and discuss how they have been used to derive a posteriori error estimates for hyperbolic conservation laws.\n\nTitle: Axisymmetric capillary water waves with vorticity and swirl.\n\nSpeaker: Jörg Weber (Universität Wien) [link]\n\nTime: Thursday, 04.07.2024, 10:00\n\nLocation: WIAS-406/Online (link on request from peschka{at}wias-berlin.de)\n\nWhile the research on axisymmetric capillary water waves has a long history, only surprisingly little has been done when one wants to allow for vorticity (local spinning) and swirl (angular momentum). After introducing the problem and presenting a well-known formulation in terms of the Stokes stream function, we will explain the main analytical ingredients in order to rigorously construct travelling wave solutions with a free boundary. Then, two solution curves are constructed: First, we start at perfectly cylindrical jets, where we derive the dispersion relation and investigate it in detail in certain cases. Also, we will point out inherent connections to the famous Rayleigh instability observed in everyday life, e.g. when a tap drips. Second, we start at static configurations with constant mean curvature surfaces, so-called unduloids. There, as an interesting interplay between water waves, geometry, and elliptic integrals, we show rigorously that to any such configuration there connects a curve of non-static configurations, which confirms previous numerical observations. The talk is based on joint work with André Erhardt (WIAS), Anna-Mariya Otsetova (Aalto), and Erik Wahlén (Lund).\n\nTitle: Mixed-dimensional Coupled Finite Elements in FEniCS(x).\n\nSpeaker: Cécile Daversin-Catty (Simula Research Laboratory, (Oslo, Norway)) [link]\n\nTime: Tuesday, 09.04.2024, 13:30\n\nLocation: Online (link on request)\n\nMixed-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) are equations coupling fields defined over distinct domains that may differ in topological dimension. Such PDEs naturally arise in a wide range of fields including geology, bio-medicine, and fracture mechanics. Mixed-dimensional models are also used to impose non-standard conditions through Lagrange multipliers. Finite element discretizations of such PDEs involve nested meshes of possibly heterogeneous topological dimension. The assembly of such systems is non-standard and non-trivial, and requires the design of both generic high level software abstractions and lower level algorithms. The FEniCS project aims at automating the numerical solution of PDE-based models using finite element methods. A core feature is a high-level domain-specific language for finite element spaces and variational forms, close to mathematical syntax. Lately, FEniCS gave way to its successor FEniCSx, including major improvements over the legacy library. An automated framework was developed in core FEniCS legacy libraries to address the challenges characterizing mixed-dimensional problems. These concepts were recently ported to FEniCSx, taking advantage of the underlying upgrades in the library features and design. This talk gives an overview of the abstractions and algorithms involved, and their implementation in the FEniCS project core libraries. The introduced features are illustrated by concrete applications in biomedicine."
