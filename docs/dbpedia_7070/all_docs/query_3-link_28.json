Her scientific contributions have been recognized with awards from the ASBMB and American Chemical Society. She was founding director of the NIH COBRE-funded Redox Biology Center at the University of Nebraska, building research infrastructure in a relatively resource-restricted setting and mentoring junior faculty to independent funding success. She is founding co-Director of the NIH-funded MOSAIC program, supporting career development, networking, and success of diverse K99/R00 scholars. The newly established MOSAIC pipeline of K99/R00 scholars, a majority with basic and translational science orientations, represents an important national resource for M-PACT recruitment. Dr. Banerjee oversees M-PACT’s mentor training/development program.\n\nFaculty Clusters work with the Faculty Development Core and Mentoring Leads to design and execute programming for the 3 interdisciplinary M-PACT research clusters. The M-PACT scholars are divided into one of three clusters based on the nature of their scholarship. The three clusters serve to provide focal faculty development experiences as well as create smaller and more intimate cohort groups. The cluster leads are led by senior scholars with outstanding records of productive academic scholarship, engagement with coaching URM scholars, and commitments to inclusive excellence at the local, national and international levels. The clusters include: Basic Biomedical Research; Clinical and Translational Research; and Social and Health Behavioral Research.\n\nBasic Biomedical Cluster\n\nCore leader (with pictures)\n\nThe Basic Biomedical Research cluster is led by Dr. Ruma Banerjee. A Co-Director of one of 3 MOSAIC programs, Banerjee is well-positioned to integrate her national and institutional efforts to support career development for scholars transitioning to the independent faculty stage. She is a member of the NIH-funded National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) and has completed training in Entering Mentoring.\n\nClinical and Translational\n\nCore leader (with pictures)\n\nThe Clinical-Translational Research cluster is led by Dr. Erica Marsh who is Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Michigan Medicine and Division Chief of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at the University of Michigan. Dr. Marsh uses community-based participatory research to build bridges between community organizations and academia with initiatives that have led to significant NIH funding, publications and awards. Her research focuses on reproductive health disparities and on investigating the pathophysiology, epidemiology and clinical impact of uterine fibroids through a patient-centered lens.\n\nSocial and Behavioral Cluster\n\nCore leaders (with pictures)\n\nThe Social and Behavioral Health Research is co-led by Dr. Rogério M. Pinto. Dr. Pinto and Dr. Ken Resnicow.\n\nDr. Pinto is professor and former Associate Dean for Research at the University of Michigan School of Social Work.

These faculty serve as primary and non-evaluative mentors and advocate for the individual scholars in the program. The Sponsor-Mentors not only provide advice to the M-PACT Scholars, they also are trained to leverage their own positions within the field to promote professional opportunities for their mentees. HERE IS A LINK TO THE LIST OF SPONSOR MENTORS.\n\nStaff Support (TBD):\n\nReshma Jagsi, PI: Dr. Jagsi’s is the chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Emory School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University.

Dr. Jagsi works with Dr. Sellers to administer the M-PACT program with specific foci on the success of the evaluation of M-PACT.\n\nTBD, Director of Pipeline Development:\n\nTBD, Administrative Core Program Director:\n\nThe continued lack of demographic diversity in the biomedical and health sciences is an equity issue that compromises the intellectual richness, the creative potential and the integrity of our disciplines, limiting our institutions and society itself. Various factors can contribute to the concerning rates of underrepresented and/or minoritized (URM) scientists in securing faculty positions and persisting in them, including university hiring practices and the strength and quality of mentoring networks and research support communities. To achieve our vision of inclusive excellence, it is imperative that faculty diversity efforts address the unique structural, social and cultural barriers that are faced by URM faculty. While increasing faculty demographic diversity is a critical part of the solution, it is insufficient in and of itself. Hiring is only the first step in the complex process of providing holistic instrumental, intellectual and social support to ensure early career faculty success. This includes access to deep and equitable financial support, as well as superb mentoring that is tailored to scholars’ intellectual, personal and cultural backgrounds and needs. To address these varied needs, M-PACT’s Faculty Development Core will proactively implement scientifically informed interventions to develop a holistic plan for the cohort of highly talented, competitive and diverse new faculty to thrive and persist on the academic path. The goals of the Faculty Development Core will be realized by addressing the following specific aims.\n\nCore Lead/Co-Investigator Dr. Alford Young, Jr. is the Edgar G. Epps Collegiate Professor of Sociology; the Arthur F. Thurnau Professor of Sociology and Afroamerican and African Studies, LSA and Gerald R.
