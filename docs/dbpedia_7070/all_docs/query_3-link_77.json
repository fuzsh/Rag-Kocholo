        "text": "A Sparrow on the Floor of a Cathedral is a series of B&W inkjet photographs of underwater geologic elements, the seafloor, and marine creatures printed on high quality matte paper and bordered with information relevant to the image, such as the vessel, sponsoring organization and where/when I came upon the scene. Linking the images to physical reality, these details nod to the work of nineteenth-century U.S. geological survey photographers like Thomas O’Sullivan.\n\nDuring my visit to Armenia, I was interested in the life of the Yazidis, an ancient ethno-religious community whose members are mainly Kurds. Many Yazidis came to Armenia during the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to escape religious persecution.\n\nMy two passions are photography and travel but sometimes they can be at odds with one another. My ideal trip is one where I can explore my surroundings in a leisurely manner, wandering here and there with no time constraints to find interesting subjects and compositions to photograph. But, alas, it doesn’t always work out that way.\n\nSurgery on my right hand in June 2023 left me unable to hold my camera, much less use it. From photographic daily to just looking at my camera sitting alone on the table looking back at me, left me extremely sad. In an effort to avoid falling deep into a dark place, I needed to find a way to make photographs.\n\nElisa Miller's body of work \"The Other\" is a vibrant feminist narrative that transcends societal norms and explores the complex struggles of womanhood. Miller challenges established histories and societal constructs.\n\nImagine motorcycles unlike any others you’ve seen before, ornate mechanical confections like Fabergé eggs with engines, exquisite but hard-boiled — and big, resplendent in the variety of their design and spectacular enough to be arrayed on pedestals in a museum. In fact, they were."
