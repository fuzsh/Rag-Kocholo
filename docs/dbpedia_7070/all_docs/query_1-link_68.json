        "text": "\"In the icy waters of the Arctic, NATO scientists are dissecting sound waves to improve the West's ability to track Russian submarines, as global warming alters acoustics underwater. \"The only reliable source of information is acoustic waves,\" Gaultier Real, the head scientist on board the NATO research vessel Alliance, told AFP during a stop in the northern Norwegian town of Tromso, on the eve of an expedition to the Barents Sea. The oceanographic ship, operated by the Italian navy and which AFP visited, is transporting Real's team of scientists to the polar front, where the waters of the Atlantic and Arctic meet. The aim of the scientific mission is to understand how climate change, which is warming the Arctic faster than the rest of the planet, is affecting the movement of underwater soundwaves. Over the course of three weeks, the vessel will spread sounds underwater, which its hydrophones, or microphones in the sea, will pick up. The data will then be analyzed. Noise pollution There are strict rules to protect the Arctic's fragile ecosystem. If the team hears animals, they'll halt work immediately. \"Marine mammals use sound to communicate, so if some animals are here, you're able to hear them. If you hear them, you stop transmitting,\" said Real, a senior acoustic scientist at NATO's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) in Italy. Oceanographic instruments will be submerged to measure the water's temperature, salinity and pressure, parameters that affect the speed at which sound travels through water. These parameters are changing due to the warmer climate, Real said, making it more complex to predict and track the trajectory of soundwaves. In addition, with the melting of the sea ice, the Arctic's sound landscape, or soundscape, is also changing. The Arctic's once silent world no longer exists, due to the increasing presence of people and cracking of the sea ice. And in the future, the noise made by the rising number of ships sailing on the newly-opened maritime routes. \"Everything needs to be re-evaluated, especially in terms of salinity and temperature in the ocean,\" Real said. The knowledge and data hold strategic value when it comes to developing sonars capable of detecting enemy subs. They also make it possible to manufacture autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), identify surface vessels by the sound of their propellers, and facilitate minesweeping. A recent article in the Texas National Security Review noted that climate change would have an effect on submarine detection capabilities. \"Climate change could lead either to an increase or decrease in intensity of the acoustic signals radiated or reflected by submarines,\" said the researchers, who conducted studies in the North Atlantic and Pacific oceans. \"As a result, distinguishing the signal of a submarine from the ambient noise might become harder or easier.\" Submarine hunting Real said it...\" MORE AT #NATO #submarines #accousticsignals #acousticsunderwater #Russia"
