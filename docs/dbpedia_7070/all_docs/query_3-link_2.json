It is intended for postdocs in the early stage up to three years after completing their doctorate. WIAS offers a two-plus one-year postdoc position in one of its research groups. After the first call for applications in September 2023, the first two participants started their work at WIAS in January 2024.\n\nOn March 18, 2024, we want to officially launch the Iris Runge Postdoc Program and also open an exhibition on women in mathematics. Along with the introduction of our first two program participants, who will each give a short scientific talk, the program features a talk by Renate Tobies on Iris Runge and the opening of the touring exhibition Women of Mathematics from around the world – a gallery of portraits, for which various female mathematicians from around the world have been portrayed and interviewed, in our library.\n\nFurther information can be found here. The event will take place in English and is free of charge, please register here by March 13th, 2024.\n\nDate: March 18th, 2024, 3 pm\n\nLocation: Erhard Schmidt Lecture Hall"
