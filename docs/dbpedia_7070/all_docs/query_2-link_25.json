        "meta_description": "Abstract. An accurate assessment of the physical states of the Earth system is an essential component of many scientific, societal, and economical considerations. These assessments are becoming an increasingly challenging computational task since we aim to resolve models with high resolutions in space and time, to consider complex coupled partial differential equations, and to estimate uncertainties, which often requires many realizations. Machine learning methods are becoming a very popular method for the construction of surrogate models to address these computational issues. However, they also face major challenges in producing explainable, scalable, interpretable, and robust models. In this paper, we evaluate the perspectives of geoscience applications of physics-based machine learning, which combines physics-based and data-driven methods to overcome the limitations of each approach taken alone. Through three designated examples (from the fields of geothermal energy, geodynamics, and hydrology), we show that the non-intrusive reduced-basis method as a physics-based machine learning approach is able to produce highly precise surrogate models that are explainable, scalable, interpretable, and robust.",

To validate our understanding of the subsurface we require data. However, the data are usually not distributed equally and introduce a potential misinterpretation of the subsurface. Therefore, in this study we investigate the influence of measurements on temperature distribution in the European Alps.\n\nEffects of transient processes for thermal simulations of the Central European Basin\n\nDenise Degen and Mauro Cacace\n\nGeosci.

We present advanced, open-source mathematical methods that enable us to investigate the influence of various model properties on the final outcomes. By relying on our approach, we have been able to showcase their importance in improving our understanding of the subsurface and highlighting the current shortcomings of currently adopted models.\n\nAre 2D shallow-water solvers fast enough for early flood warning? A comparative assessment on the 2021 Ahr valley flood event\n\nShahin Khosh Bin Ghomash, Heiko Apel, and Daniel Caviedes-VoulliÃ¨me\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

We explore the use of highly detailed flood models to simulate the 2021 flood event in the lower Ahr valley (Germany). Using very high-resolution models resolving individual streets and buildings, we produce detailed, quantitative, and actionable information for early flood warning systems. Using state-of-the-art computational technology, these models can guarantee very fast forecasts which allow for sufficient time to respond.\n\nHydro-pedotransfer functions: a roadmap for future development\n\nTobias Karl David Weber, Lutz WeihermÃ¼ller, Attila Nemes, Michel Bechtold, Aurore DegrÃ©, Efstathios Diamantopoulos, Simone Fatichi, Vilim FilipoviÄ, Surya Gupta, Tobias L.

The appropriateness of these predictions critically relies on the nature of the datasets for training the PTFs and the physical comprehensiveness of the models. This roadmap paper is addressed to PTF developers and users and critically reflects the utility and future of PTFs. To this end, we present a manifesto aiming at a paradigm shift in PTF research.\n\nThe AgraSim (Agricultural Simulator) facility for the comprehensive experimental simulation and analysis of environmental impacts on processes in the soil-plant-atmosphere system\n\nJoschka Neumann, Nicolas BrÃ¼ggemann, Patrick Chaumet, Normen Hermes, Jan Huwer, Peter Kirchner, Werner Lesmeister, Wilhelm August Mertens, Thomas PÃ¼tz, JÃ¶rg Wolters, Harry Vereecken, and Ghaleb Natour\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1598,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1598, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change in combination with a steadily growing world population and a simultaneous decrease in agricultural land is one of the greatest global challenges facing mankind. In this context, Forschungszentrum Jülich established an \"agricultural simulator\" (AgraSim), which enables research into the effects of climate change on agricultural ecosystems and the optimization of agricultural cultivation and management strategies with the aid of combined experimental and numerical simulation.\n\nHESS Opinions: Towards a common vision for the future of hydrological observatories\n\nPaolo Nasta, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, Heye R.

Tarquis, Ilja van Meerveld, Marc Voltz, Yijian Zeng, William Kustas, Xin Li, Harry Vereecken, and Nunzio Romano\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1678,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1678, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Unsolved Problems in Hydrology (UPH) initiative has emphasized the need to establish networks of multi-decadal hydrological observatories to tackle catchment-scale challenges on a global scale. This opinion paper provocatively discusses two end members of possible future hydrological observatory (HO) networks for a given hypothesized community budget: a comprehensive set of moderately instrumented observatories or, alternatively, a small number of highly instrumented super-sites.\n\nThe influence of viscous slab rheology on numerical models of subduction\n\nNatalie Hummel, Susanne Buiter, and ZoltÃ¡n ErdÅs\n\nSolid Earth, 15, 567–587, https://doi.org/10.5194/se-15-567-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/se-15-567-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSimulations of subducting tectonic plates often use material properties extrapolated from the behavior of small rock samples in a laboratory to conditions found in the Earth. We explore several typical approaches to simulating these extrapolated material properties and show that they produce very rigid subducting plates with unrealistic dynamics. Our findings imply that subducting plates deform by additional mechanisms that are less commonly implemented in simulations.\n\nSystematic underestimation of type-specific ecosystem process variability in the Community Land Model v5 over Europe\n\nChristian Poppe TerÃ¡n, Bibi S. Naz, Harry Vereecken, Roland Baatz, Rosie Fisher, and Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-978,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-978, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCarbon and water exchanges between the atmosphere and the land surface contribute to water resource availability and climate change mitigation. Land Surface Models, like the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5), simulate these. This study finds that CLM5 and other data sets underestimate the magnitudes and variability of carbon and water exchanges for the most abundant plant functional types compared to observations. It provides essential insights for further research on these processes.\n\nTowards a community-wide effort for benchmarking in subsurface hydrological inversion: benchmarking cases, high-fidelity reference solutions, procedure and a first comparison\n\nTeng Xu, Sinan Xiao, Sebastian Reuschen, Nils Wildt, Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen, and Wolfgang Nowak\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-60,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-60, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript under review for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide a set of benchmarking scenarios for geostatistical inversion, and we encourage the scientific community to use these to compare their newly developed methods. To facilitate transparent, appropriate, and uncertainty-aware comparison of novel methods, we also provide accurate reference solutions, a high-end reference algorithm, and a diverse set of benchmarking metrics, all of which are publicly available. With this, we seek to foster more targeted and transparent progress in the field.\n\nComment on “Are soils overrated in hydrology?” by Gao et al. (2023)\n\nYing Zhao, Mehdi Rahmati, Harry Vereecken, and Dani Or\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-629,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-629, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGao et al. (2023) question the importance of soil in hydrology, sparking debate. We acknowledge some valid points but critique their broad, unsubstantiated views on soil's role. Our response highlights three key areas: (1) the false divide between ecosystem-centric and soil-centric approaches, (2) the vital yet varied impact of soil properties, and (3) the call for a scale-aware framework. We aim to unify these perspectives, enhancing hydrology's comprehensive understanding.\n\nEvapotranspiration prediction for European forest sites does not improve with assimilation of in situ soil water content data\n\nLukas Strebel, Heye Bogena, Harry Vereecken, Mie Andreasen, Sergio Aranda-Barranco, and Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1001–1026, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1001-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1001-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present results from using soil water content measurements from 13 European forest sites in a state-of-the-art land surface model. We use data assimilation to perform a combination of observed and modeled soil water content and show the improvements in the representation of soil water content. However, we also look at the impact on evapotranspiration and see no corresponding improvements.\n\nHigh Resolution Land Surface Modelling over Africa: the role of uncertain soil properties in combination with temporal model resolution\n\nBamidele Joseph Oloruntoba, Stefan Kollet, Carsten Montzka, Harry Vereecken, and Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3132,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3132, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study uses simulations to understand how the soil information across Africa affects the water balance, using 4 soil databases and 3 different rainfall datasets. Results show that the soil information impacts water balance estimates, especially with a higher rate of rainfall.\n\nGeoINR 1.0: an implicit neural network approach to three-dimensional geological modelling\n\nMichael Hillier, Florian Wellmann, Eric A. de Kemp, Boyan Brodaric, Ernst Schetselaar, and Karine BÃ©dard\n\nGeosci.

Existing neural network approaches for this type of modelling are advanced by the efficient incorporation of unconformities, new knowledge inputs, and improved data fitting techniques. These advances permit the modelling of more complex geology in diverse geological settings, different-sized areas, and various data regimes.\n\nSeasonal soil moisture and crop yield prediction with fifth-generation seasonal forecasting system (SEAS5) long-range meteorological forecasts in a land surface modelling approach\n\nTheresa Boas, Heye Reemt Bogena, Dongryeol Ryu, Harry Vereecken, Andrew Western, and Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3143–3167, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3143-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3143-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn our study, we tested the utility and skill of a state-of-the-art forecasting product for the prediction of regional crop productivity using a land surface model. Our results illustrate the potential value and skill of combining seasonal forecasts with modelling applications to generate variables of interest for stakeholders, such as annual crop yield for specific cash crops and regions. In addition, this study provides useful insights for future technical model evaluations and improvements.\n\nParflow 3.9: development of lightweight embedded DSLs for geoscientific models\n\nZbigniew P. Piotrowski, Jaro Hokkanen, Daniel Caviedes-Voullieme, Olaf Stein, and Stefan Kollet\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1079,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1079, 2023\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe computer programs capable of simulation of Earth system components evolve, adapting new fundamental science concepts and more observational data on more and more powerful computer hardware. Adaptation of a large scientific program to a new type of hardware is costly. In this work we propose cheap and simple but effective strategy that enable computation using graphic processing units, based on automated program code modification. This results in better resolution and/or longer predictions.\n\nPySubdiv 1.0: open-source geological modeling and reconstruction by non-manifold subdivision surfaces\n\nMohammad Moulaeifard, Simon Bernard, and Florian Wellmann\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 3565–3579, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3565-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3565-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work, we propose a flexible framework to generate and interact with geological models using explicit surface representations. The essence of the work lies in the determination of the flexible control mesh, topologically similar to the main geological structure, watertight and controllable with few control points, to manage the geological structures. We exploited the subdivision surface method in our work, which is commonly used in the animation and gaming industry.\n\nAnalogue modelling of the inversion of multiple extensional basins in foreland fold-and-thrust belts\n\nNicolÃ¡s Molnar and Susanne Buiter\n\nSolid Earth, 14, 213–235, https://doi.org/10.5194/se-14-213-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/se-14-213-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nProgression of orogenic wedges over pre-existing extensional structures is common in nature, but deciphering the spatio-temporal evolution of deformation from the geological record remains challenging. Our laboratory experiments provide insights on how horizontal stresses are transferred across a heterogeneous crust, constrain which pre-shortening conditions can either favour or hinder the reactivatation of extensional structures, and explain what implications they have on critical taper theory.\n\nSERGHEI (SERGHEI-SWE) v1.0: a performance-portable high-performance parallel-computing shallow-water solver for hydrology and environmental hydraulics\n\nDaniel Caviedes-VoulliÃ¨me, Mario Morales-HernÃ¡ndez, Matthew R. Norman, and Ilhan Ãzgen-Xian\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 977–1008, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-977-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-977-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper introduces the SERGHEI framework and a solver for shallow-water problems. Such models, often used for surface flow and flood modelling, are computationally intense. In recent years the trends to increase computational power have changed, requiring models to adapt to new hardware and new software paradigms. SERGHEI addresses these challenges, allowing surface flow simulation to be enabled on the newest and upcoming consumer hardware and supercomputers very efficiently.\n\nAnalogue modelling of basin inversion: a review and future perspectives\n\nFrank Zwaan, Guido Schreurs, Susanne J. H. Buiter, Oriol Ferrer, Riccardo Reitano, Michael Rudolf, and Ernst Willingshofer\n\nSolid Earth, 13, 1859–1905, https://doi.org/10.5194/se-13-1859-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/se-13-1859-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhen a sedimentary basin is subjected to compressional tectonic forces after its formation, it may be inverted. A thorough understanding of such basin inversion is of great importance for scientific, societal, and economic reasons, and analogue tectonic models form a key part of our efforts to study these processes. We review the advances in the field of basin inversion modelling, showing how the modelling results can be applied, and we identify promising venues for future research.\n\nFeasibility of irrigation monitoring with cosmic-ray neutron sensors\n\nCosimo Brogi, Heye Reemt Bogena, Markus KÃ¶hli, Johan Alexander Huisman, Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen, and Olga Dombrowski\n\nGeosci. Instrum. Method. Data Syst., 11, 451–469, https://doi.org/10.5194/gi-11-451-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gi-11-451-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAccurate monitoring of water in soil can improve irrigation efficiency, which is important considering climate change and the growing world population. Cosmic-ray neutrons sensors (CRNSs) are a promising tool in irrigation monitoring due to a larger sensed area and to lower maintenance than other ground-based sensors. Here, we analyse the feasibility of irrigation monitoring with CRNSs and the impact of the irrigated field dimensions, of the variations of water in soil, and of instrument design.\n\nClustering has a meaning: optimization of angular similarity to detect 3DÂ geometric anomalies in geological terrains\n\nMichaÅ P. Michalak, LesÅaw Teper, Florian Wellmann, Jerzy Å»aba, Krzysztof Gaidzik, Marcin Kostur, Yuriy P. Maystrenko, and Paulina Leonowicz\n\nSolid Earth, 13, 1697–1720, https://doi.org/10.5194/se-13-1697-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/se-13-1697-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhen characterizing geological/geophysical surfaces, various geometric attributes are calculated, such as dip angle (1D) or dip direction (2D). However, the boundaries between specific values may be subjective and without optimization significance, resulting from using default color palletes. This study proposes minimizing cosine distance among within-cluster observations to detect 3D anomalies. Our results suggest that the method holds promise for identification of megacylinders or megacones.\n\nCLM5-FruitTree: a new sub-model for deciduous fruit trees in the Community Land Model (CLM5)\n\nOlga Dombrowski, Cosimo Brogi, Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen, Damiano Zanotelli, and Heye Bogena\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 5167–5193, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5167-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5167-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSoil carbon storage and food production of fruit orchards will be influenced by climate change. However, they lack representation in models that study such processes. We developed and tested a new sub-model, CLM5-FruitTree, that describes growth, biomass distribution, and management practices in orchards. The model satisfactorily predicted yield and exchange of carbon, energy, and water in an apple orchard and can be used to study land surface processes in fruit orchards at different scales.\n\nMachine Learning with UAS LiDAR for Winter Wheat Biomass Estimations\n\nJordan Bates, Francois Jonard, Rajina Bajracharya, Harry Vereecken, and Carsten Montzka\n\nAGILE GIScience Ser., 3, 23, https://doi.org/10.5194/agile-giss-3-23-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/agile-giss-3-23-2022, 2022\n\nGlobal Sensitivity Analysis of the distributed hydrologic model ParFlow-CLM (V3.6.0)\n\nWei Qu, Heye Bogena, Christoph SchÃ¼th, Harry Vereecken, Zongmei Li, and Stephan Schulz\n\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2022-131,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2022-131, 2022\n\nPublication in GMD not foreseen\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe applied the global sensitivity analysis LH-OAT to the integrated hydrology model ParFlow-CLM to investigate the sensitivity of the 12 parameters for different scenarios. And we found that the general patterns of the parameter sensitivities were consistent, however, for some parameters a significantly larger span of the sensitivities was observed, especially for the higher slope and in subarctic climatic scenarios.\n\nCoupled modelling of hydrological processes and grassland production in two contrasting climates\n\nNicholas Jarvis, Jannis Groh, Elisabet Lewan, Katharina H. E. Meurer, Walter Durka, Cornelia Baessler, Thomas PÃ¼tz, Elvin Rufullayev, and Harry Vereecken\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 2277–2299, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2277-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2277-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe apply an eco-hydrological model to data on soil water balance and grassland growth obtained at two sites with contrasting climates. Our results show that the grassland in the drier climate had adapted by developing deeper roots, which maintained water supply to the plants in the face of severe drought. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering such plastic responses of plant traits to environmental stress in the modelling of soil water balance and plant growth under climate change.\n\nRifting continents\n\nSusanne J. H. Buiter, Sascha Brune, Derek Keir, and Gwenn Peron-Pinvidic\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-139,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-139, 2022\n\nPreprint archived\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nContinental rifts can form when and where continents are stretched. Rifts are characterised by faults, sedimentary basins, earthquakes and/or volcanism. If rifting can continue, a rift may break a continent into conjugate margins such as along the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. In some cases, however, rifting fails, such as in the West African Rift. We discuss continental rifting from inception to break-up, focussing on the processes at play, and illustrate these with several natural examples.\n\nCOSMOS-Europe: a European network of cosmic-ray neutron soil moisture sensors\n\nHeye Reemt Bogena, Martin SchrÃ¶n, Jannis Jakobi, Patrizia Ney, Steffen Zacharias, Mie Andreasen, Roland Baatz, David Boorman, Mustafa Berk Duygu, Miguel Angel Eguibar-GalÃ¡n, Benjamin Fersch, Till Franke, Josie Geris, MarÃ­a GonzÃ¡lez Sanchis, Yann Kerr, Tobias Korf, Zalalem Mengistu, Arnaud Mialon, Paolo Nasta, Jerzy Nitychoruk, Vassilios Pisinaras, Daniel Rasche, Rafael Rosolem, Hami Said, Paul Schattan, Marek Zreda, Stefan Achleitner, Eduardo Albentosa-HernÃ¡ndez, Zuhal AkyÃ¼rek, Theresa Blume, Antonio del Campo, Davide Canone, Katya Dimitrova-Petrova, John G.

Jensen, Harald Kunstmann, Antonio LidÃ³n, Majken Caroline Looms, Sascha Oswald, Andreas Panagopoulos, Amol Patil, Daniel Power, Corinna Rebmann, Nunzio Romano, Lena Scheiffele, Sonia Seneviratne, Georg Weltin, and Harry Vereecken\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 14, 1125–1151, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-1125-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-1125-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMonitoring of increasingly frequent droughts is a prerequisite for climate adaptation strategies. This data paper presents long-term soil moisture measurements recorded by 66 cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNS) operated by 24 institutions and distributed across major climate zones in Europe. Data processing followed harmonized protocols and state-of-the-art methods to generate consistent and comparable soil moisture products and to facilitate continental-scale analysis of hydrological extremes.\n\nCoupling the Community Land Model version 5.0 to the parallel data assimilation framework PDAF: description and applications\n\nLukas Strebel, Heye R. Bogena, Harry Vereecken, and Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 395–411, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-395-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-395-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present the technical coupling between a land surface model (CLM5) and the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework (PDAF). This coupling enables measurement data to update simulated model states and parameters in a statistically optimal way. We demonstrate the viability of the model framework using an application in a forested catchment where the inclusion of soil water measurements significantly improved the simulation quality.\n\nResponse of water fluxes and biomass production to climate change in permanent grassland soil ecosystems\n\nVeronika Forstner, Jannis Groh, Matevz Vremec, Markus Herndl, Harry Vereecken, Horst H. Gerke, Steffen Birk, and Thomas PÃ¼tz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 6087–6106, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-6087-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-6087-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLysimeter-based manipulative and observational experiments were used to identify responses of water fluxes and aboveground biomass (AGB) to climatic change in permanent grassland. Under energy-limited conditions, elevated temperature actual evapotranspiration (ETa) increased, while seepage, dew, and AGB decreased. Elevated CO2 mitigated the effect on ETa. Under water limitation, elevated temperature resulted in reduced ETa, and AGB was negatively correlated with an increasing aridity.\n\nHow biased are our models? â a case study of the alpine region\n\nDenise Degen, Cameron Spooner, Magdalena Scheck-Wenderoth, and Mauro Cacace\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 7133–7153, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7133-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7133-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn times of worldwide energy transitions, an understanding of the subsurface is increasingly important to provide renewable energy sources such as geothermal energy. To validate our understanding of the subsurface we require data. However, the data are usually not distributed equally and introduce a potential misinterpretation of the subsurface. Therefore, in this study we investigate the influence of measurements on temperature distribution in the European Alps.\n\nLong-term trends in agricultural droughts over Netherlands and Germany: how extreme was the year 2018?\n\nYafei Huang, Jonas Weis, Harry Vereecken, and Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2021-569,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2021-569, 2021\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTrends in agricultural droughts cannot be easily deduced from measurements. Here trends in agricultural droughts over 31 German and Dutch sites were calculated with model simulations and long-term observed meteorological data as input. We found that agricultural droughts are increasing although precipitation hardly decreases. The increase is driven by increase in evapotranspiration. The year 2018 was for half of the sites the year with the most extreme agricultural drought in the last 55 years.\n\nA first investigation of hydrogeology and hydrogeophysics of the Maqu catchment in the Yellow River source region\n\nMengna Li, Yijian Zeng, Maciek W. Lubczynski, Jean Roy, Lianyu Yu, Hui Qian, Zhenyu Li, Jie Chen, Lei Han, Han Zheng, Tom Veldkamp, Jeroen M. Schoorl, Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen, Kai Hou, Qiying Zhang, Panpan Xu, Fan Li, Kai Lu, Yulin Li, and Zhongbo Su\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 13, 4727–4757, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-4727-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-4727-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Tibetan Plateau is the source of most of Asia's major rivers and has been called the Asian Water Tower. Due to its remoteness and the harsh environment, there is a lack of field survey data to investigate its hydrogeology. Borehole core lithology analysis, an altitude survey, soil thickness measurement, hydrogeological surveys, and hydrogeophysical surveys were conducted in the Maqu catchment within the Yellow River source region to improve a fullâpicture understanding of the water cycle.\n\nThe future of conferences: lessons from Europe's largest online geoscience conference\n\nHazel Gibson, Sam Illingworth, and Susanne Buiter\n\nGeosci. Commun., 4, 437–451, https://doi.org/10.5194/gc-4-437-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gc-4-437-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the spring of 2020, in response to the escalating global COVID-19 Coronavirus pandemic, the European Geosciences Union (EGU) moved its annual General Assembly online in a matter of weeks. This paper explores the feedback provided by participants who attended this experimental conference and identifies four key themes that emerged from analysis of the survey (connection, engagement, environment, and accessibility). The responses raise important questions about the format of future conferences.\n\nPresentation and discussion of the high-resolution atmosphereâland-surfaceâsubsurface simulation dataset of the simulated Neckar catchment for the period 2007â2015\n\nBernd Schalge, Gabriele Baroni, Barbara Haese, Daniel Erdal, Gernot Geppert, Pablo Saavedra, Vincent Haefliger, Harry Vereecken, Sabine Attinger, Harald Kunstmann, Olaf A. Cirpka, Felix Ament, Stefan Kollet, Insa Neuweiler, Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen, and Clemens Simmer\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 13, 4437–4464, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-4437-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-4437-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, a 9-year simulation of complete model output of a coupled atmosphere–land-surface–subsurface model on the catchment scale is discussed. We used the Neckar catchment in SW Germany as the basis of this simulation. Since the dataset includes the full model output, it is not only possible to investigate model behavior and interactions between the component models but also use it as a virtual truth for comparison of, for example, data assimilation experiments.\n\nFrom hydraulic root architecture models to macroscopic representations of root hydraulics in soil water flow and land surface models\n\nJan Vanderborght, Valentin Couvreur, Felicien Meunier, Andrea Schnepf, Harry Vereecken, Martin Bouda, and Mathieu Javaux\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 4835–4860, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-4835-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-4835-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRoot water uptake is an important process in the terrestrial water cycle. How this process depends on soil water content, root distributions, and root properties is a soil–root hydraulic problem. We compare different approaches to implementing root hydraulics in macroscopic soil water flow and land surface models.\n\nConstraining stochastic 3-D structural geological models with topology information using approximate Bayesian computation in GemPy 2.1\n\nAlexander Schaaf, Miguel de la Varga, Florian Wellmann, and Clare E. Bond\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 3899–3913, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-3899-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-3899-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUncertainty is an inherent property of any model of the subsurface. We show how geological topology information – how different regions of rocks in the subsurface are connected – can be used to train uncertain geological models to reduce uncertainty. More widely, the method demonstrates the use of probabilistic machine learning (Bayesian inference) to train structural geological models on auxiliary geological knowledge that can be encoded in graph structures.\n\nReviews and syntheses: Gaining insights into evapotranspiration partitioning with novel isotopic monitoring methods\n\nYouri Rothfuss, Maria Quade, Nicolas BrÃ¼ggemann, Alexander Graf, Harry Vereecken, and Maren Dubbert\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 3701–3732, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3701-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3701-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe partitioning of evapotranspiration into evaporation from soil and transpiration from plants is crucial for a wide range of parties, from farmers to policymakers. In this work, we focus on a particular partitioning method, based on the stable isotopic analysis of water. In particular, we aim at highlighting the challenges that this method is currently facing and, in light of recent methodological developments, propose ways forward for the isotopic-partitioning community.\n\nAdded value of geophysics-based soil mapping in agro-ecosystem simulations\n\nCosimo Brogi, Johan A. Huisman, Lutz WeihermÃ¼ller, Michael Herbst, and Harry Vereecken\n\nSOIL, 7, 125–143, https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-7-125-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-7-125-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere is a need in agriculture for detailed soil maps that carry quantitative information. Geophysics-based soil maps have the potential to deliver such products, but their added value has not been fully investigated yet. In this study, we compare the use of a geophysics-based soil map with the use of two commonly available maps as input for crop growth simulations. The geophysics-based product results in better simulations, with improvements that depend on precipitation, soil, and crop type.\n\nEffects of transient processes for thermal simulations of the Central European Basin\n\nDenise Degen and Mauro Cacace\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 1699–1719, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-1699-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-1699-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work, we focus on improving the understanding of subsurface processes with respect to interactions with climate dynamics. We present advanced, open-source mathematical methods that enable us to investigate the influence of various model properties on the final outcomes. By relying on our approach, we have been able to showcase their importance in improving our understanding of the subsurface and highlighting the current shortcomings of currently adopted models.\n\nImproving the representation of cropland sites in the Community Land Model (CLM) version 5.0\n\nTheresa Boas, Heye Bogena, Thomas GrÃ¼nwald, Bernard Heinesch, Dongryeol Ryu, Marius Schmidt, Harry Vereecken, Andrew Western, and Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen\n\nGeosci.

Our modifications should be applied in future studies of CLM5 to improve regional yield predictions and to better understand large-scale impacts of agricultural management on carbon, water, and energy fluxes.\n\nA dense network of cosmic-ray neutron sensors for soil moisture observation in a highly instrumented pre-Alpine headwater catchment in Germany\n\nBenjamin Fersch, Till Francke, Maik Heistermann, Martin SchrÃ¶n, Veronika DÃ¶pper, Jannis Jakobi, Gabriele Baroni, Theresa Blume, Heye Bogena, Christian Budach, Tobias GrÃ¤nzig, Michael FÃ¶rster, Andreas GÃ¼ntner, Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen, Mandy Kasner, Markus KÃ¶hli, Birgit Kleinschmit, Harald Kunstmann, Amol Patil, Daniel Rasche, Lena Scheiffele, Ulrich Schmidt, Sandra Szulc-Seyfried, Jannis Weimar, Steffen Zacharias, Marek Zreda, Bernd Heber, Ralf Kiese, Vladimir Mares, Hannes Mollenhauer, Ingo VÃ¶lksch, and Sascha Oswald\n\nEarth Syst.

It showed comparable results to traditional interpolators, with the advantage of presenting generalization properties. We discussed three different ways of combining distributions and their implications for the probabilistic results. By its construction, the method provides a suitable and flexible framework for uncertainty analysis and decision-making.\n\nResponses of soil water storage and crop water use efficiency to changing climatic conditions: a lysimeter-based space-for-time approach\n\nJannis Groh, Jan Vanderborght, Thomas PÃ¼tz, Hans-JÃ¶rg Vogel, Ralf GrÃ¼ndling, Holger Rupp, Mehdi Rahmati, Michael Sommer, Harry Vereecken, and Horst H.

Sci., 23, 4333–4347, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4333-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4333-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrecipitation moves through the soil to become stream water. The fraction of precipitation that becomes stream water after 3 months (Fyw) can be calculated with the stable isotopes of water. Previously, this was done for all the isotope data available, e.g., for several years. We used 1 year of data to calculate Fyw and moved this calculation time window over the time series. Results highlight that Fyw varies in time. Comparison studies of different regions should take this into account.\n\nA systematic comparison of experimental set-ups for modelling extensional tectonics\n\nFrank Zwaan, Guido Schreurs, and Susanne J. H. Buiter\n\nSolid Earth, 10, 1063–1097, https://doi.org/10.5194/se-10-1063-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/se-10-1063-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work was inspired by an effort to numerically reproduce laboratory models of extension tectonics. We tested various set-ups to find a suitable analogue model and in the process systematically charted the impact of set-ups and boundary conditions on model results, a topic poorly described in existing scientific literature. We hope that our model results and the discussion on which specific tectonic settings they could represent may serve as a guide for future (analogue) modeling studies.\n\nSource partitioning of H2O and CO2 fluxes based on high-frequency eddy covariance data: a comparison between study sites\n\nAnne Klosterhalfen, Alexander Graf, Nicolas BrÃ¼ggemann, Clemens DrÃ¼e, Odilia Esser, MarÃ­a P.

(2008) to high-frequency eddy covariance measurements of 12 study sites covering various ecosystems (croplands, grasslands, and forests) in different climatic regions. We analyzed the interrelations among turbulence, site characteristics, and the performance of both partitioning methods.\n\nImproving soil moisture and runoff simulations at 3 km over Europe using land surface data assimilation\n\nBibi S. Naz, Wolfgang Kurtz, Carsten Montzka, Wendy Sharples, Klaus Goergen, Jessica Keune, Huilin Gao, Anne Springer, Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen, and Stefan Kollet\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

The soil moisture estimates in this study, with complete spatio-temporal coverage and improved spatial resolution from the assimilation, offer a new reanalysis product for the monitoring of surface soil water content and other hydrological fluxes at 3 km resolution over Europe.\n\nGemPy 1.0: open-source stochastic geological modeling and inversion\n\nMiguel de la Varga, Alexander Schaaf, and Florian Wellmann\n\nGeosci.

GemPy is implemented in the programming language Python, making use of a highly efficient underlying library, Theano, for efficient code generation that performs automatic differentiation. This enables the link to probabilistic machine-learning and Bayesian inference frameworks.\n\nJoint editorial: Invigorating hydrological research through journal publications\n\nNevil Quinn, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, AndrÃ¡s BÃ¡rdossy, Attilio Castellarin, Martyn Clark, Christophe Cudennec, Demetris Koutsoyiannis, Upmanu Lall, Lubomir Lichner, Juraj Parajka, Christa D.

In total, 5023 infiltration curves were collected across all continents in the SWIG database. These data were either provided and quality checked by the scientists or they were digitized from published articles. We are convinced that the SWIG database will allow for a better parameterization of the infiltration process in land surface models and for testing infiltration models.\n\nSteering operational synergies in terrestrial observation networks: opportunity for advancing Earth system dynamics modelling\n\nRoland Baatz, Pamela L.

We propose developing a model platform for interdisciplinary usage, to formalize current network infrastructure based on complementarities and operational synergies, and to extend the reanalysis concept to the ecosystem and critical zone.\n\nRoot growth, water uptake, and sap flow of winter wheat in response to different soil water conditions\n\nGaochao Cai, Jan Vanderborght, Matthias Langensiepen, Andrea Schnepf, Hubert HÃ¼ging, and Harry Vereecken\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2449–2470, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2449-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2449-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDifferent crop growths had consequences for the parameterization of root water uptake models. The root hydraulic parameters of the Couvreur model but not the water stress parameters of the Feddes–Jarvis model could be constrained by the field data measured from rhizotron facilities. The simulated differences in transpiration from the two soils and the different water treatments could be confirmed by sap flow measurements. The Couvreur model predicted the ratios of transpiration fluxes better.\n\nEvaluation and uncertainty analysis of regional-scale CLM4.5 net carbon flux estimates\n\nHanna Post, Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen, Xujun Han, Roland Baatz, Carsten Montzka, Marius Schmidt, and Harry Vereecken\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 187–208, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-187-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-187-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEstimated values of selected key CLM4.5-BGC parameters obtained with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach DREAM(zs) strongly altered catchment-scale NEE predictions in comparison to global default parameter values. The effect of perturbed meteorological input data on the uncertainty of the predicted carbon fluxes was notably higher for C3-grass and C3-crop than for coniferous and deciduous forest. A future distinction of different crop types including management is considered essential.\n\nState and parameter estimation of two land surface models using the ensemble Kalman filter and the particle filter\n\nHongjuan Zhang, Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen, Xujun Han, Jasper A. Vrugt, and Harry Vereecken\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 4927–4958, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4927-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4927-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nApplications of data assimilation (DA) arise in many fields of geosciences, perhaps most importantly in weather forecasting and hydrology. We want to investigate the roles of data assimilation methods and land surface models (LSMs) in joint estimation of states and parameters in the assimilation experiments. We find that all DA methods can improve prediction of states, and that differences between DA methods were limited but that the differences between LSMs were much larger.\n\nMethods and uncertainty estimations of 3-D structural modelling in crystalline rocks: a case study\n\nRaphael Schneeberger, Miguel de La Varga, Daniel Egli, Alfons Berger, Florian Kober, Florian Wellmann, and Marco Herwegh\n\nSolid Earth, 8, 987–1002, https://doi.org/10.5194/se-8-987-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/se-8-987-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStructural 3-D modelling has become a widely used technique within applied projects. We performed a typical modelling workflow for a study site with the occurrence of an underground facility. This exceptional setting enabled us to test the surface-based extrapolation of faults with the mapped faults underground. We estimated the extrapolation-related uncertainty with probabilistic 2-D interpolation. This research was conducted to improve structural 3-D modelling in less-constrained areas.\n\nA global data set of soil hydraulic properties and sub-grid variability of soil water retention and hydraulicÂ conductivity curves\n\nCarsten Montzka, Michael Herbst, Lutz WeihermÃ¼ller, Anne Verhoef, and Harry Vereecken\n\nEarth Syst.

Here we present a method to scale hydraulic parameters to individual model grids and provide a global data set that overcomes the problems. It preserves the information of sub-grid variability of the water retention curve by deriving local scaling parameters that enables modellers to perturb hydraulic parameters for model ensemble generation.\n\nEvaluation of a cosmic-ray neutron sensor network for improved land surface model prediction\n\nRoland Baatz, Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen, Xujun Han, Tim Hoar, Heye Reemt Bogena, and Harry Vereecken\n\nHydrol.

In this study, real-world data of a network of cosmic-ray sensors were assimilated into a regional land surface model to improve model states and soil hydraulic parameters. The results show the potential of these networks for improving model states and parameters. It is suggested to widen the number of observed variables and to increase the number of estimated parameters.\n\nColloid-bound and dissolved phosphorus species in topsoil water extracts along a grassland transect from Cambisol to Stagnosol\n\nXiaoqian Jiang, Roland Bol, Barbara J.

The model was able to capture all important processes and interactions between the compartments as well as showing realistic statistical behavior. This proves that using a model as a virtual truth is possible and it will enable us to develop data assimilation methods where states and parameters are updated across compartment.\n\nThe integrated water balance and soil data set of the Rollesbroich hydrological observatory\n\nWei Qu, Heye R.

Hydrometeorological data and spatiotemporal variations in soil water content are measured at high temporal resolution and can be used for many purposes, e.g. validation of remote sensing retrievals, improving hydrological understanding, optimizing data assimilation and inverse modelling techniques. The data set is freely available online (http://www.tereno.net).\n\nTerrSysMPâPDAF (version 1.0): a modular high-performance data assimilation framework for an integrated land surfaceâsubsurface model\n\nWolfgang Kurtz, Guowei He, Stefan J.

Currently, pressure and soil moisture data can be used to update model states and parameters in the subsurface compartment of TerrSysMP. Results from an idealized twin experiment show that the developed DA system provides a good parallel performance and is also applicable for high-resolution modelling problems.\n\npynoddyÂ 1.0: an experimental platform for automated 3-D kinematic and potential field modelling\n\nJ.

Here, we provide a modelling code to construct such models on the basis of significant deformational events in geological history, encapsulated in kinematic equations. Our methods simplify complex dynamic processes, but enable us to evaluate how events interact, and finally how certain we are about predictions of structures in the subsurface.\n\nSpeciation and distribution of P associated with Fe and Al oxides in aggregate-sized fraction of an arable soil\n\nX. Jiang, R. Bol, S. Willbold, H. Vereecken, and E.

The relative distribution and speciation of varying P forms were independent of particle size. The majority of alkaline extractable P was in the amorphous Fe/Al oxide fraction, most of which was orthophosphate. Significant amounts of monoester P were also bound to these oxides. Residual P contained similar amounts of P occluded in amorphous and crystalline Fe oxides. This P may be released by FeO dissolution.\n\nLong-term and high-frequency non-destructive monitoring of water stable isotope profiles in an evaporating soil column\n\nY. Rothfuss, S. Merz, J.

Because land surface properties cannot be assumed identical at two eddy covariance towers, a correction for systematic flux differences is proposed to be added to the classical weather filter. With this extension, the overestimation of NEE uncertainty due to systematic flux differences (which are assumed to increase with tower distance) can considerably be reduced.\n\nInverse modelling of in situ soil water dynamics: accounting for heteroscedastic, autocorrelated, and non-Gaussian distributed residuals\n\nB.

The results show that the data assimilation can reduce the systematic input errors due to the lack of irrigation data. The estimations of soil moisture, evapotranspiration and leaf area index can be improved in the joint assimilation framework.\n\nFuture accreted terranes: a compilation of island arcs, oceanic plateaus, submarine ridges, seamounts, and continental fragments\n\nJ.

Our results demonstrate that the streamline upwind Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG) method outperforms the other approaches. We found that excessively frequent reinitialization can lead to exceptionally high errors in simulations.\n\nModelling chemical advection during magma ascent\n\nHugo Dominguez, Nicolas Riel, and Pierre Lanari\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 6105–6122, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-6105-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-6105-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPredicting the behaviour of magmatic systems is important for understanding Earth's matter and heat transport. Numerical modelling is a technique that can predict complex systems at different scales of space and time by solving equations using various techniques. This study tests four algorithms to find the best way to transport the melt composition. The \"weighted essentially non-oscillatory\" algorithm emerges as the best choice, minimising errors and preserving system mass well.\n\nConsistent point data assimilation in Firedrake and Icepack\n\nReuben W. Nixon-Hill, Daniel Shapero, Colin J. Cotter, and David A. Ham\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 5369–5386, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-5369-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-5369-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nScientists often use models to study complex processes, like the movement of ice sheets, and compare them to measurements for estimating quantities that are hard to measure. We highlight an approach that ensures accurate results from point data sources (e.g. height measurements) by evaluating the numerical solution at true point locations. This method improves accuracy, aids communication between scientists, and is well-suited for integration with specialised software that automates processes.\n\nA computationally efficient parameterization of aerosol, cloud and precipitation pH for application at global and regional scale (EQSAM4Clim-v12)\n\nSwen Metzger, Samuel RÃ©my, Jason E. Williams, Vincent Huijnen, and Johannes Flemming\n\nGeosci.

It is based on an analytical concept that is sufficiently fast and free of numerical noise, which makes it attractive for air quality forecasting. Version 12 allows the calculation of aerosol composition based on the gas–liquid–solid and the reduced gas–liquid partitioning with the associated water uptake for both cases, including the acidity of the aerosols.\n\nAssessing the benefits of approximately exact step sizes for Picard and Newton solver in simulating ice flow (FEniCS-full-Stokes v.1.3.2)\n\nNiko Schmidt, Angelika Humbert, and Thomas Slawig\n\nGeosci.

The melting and acceleration of glaciers plays a major role in sea-level change. Computer simulation of glaciers costs a lot of computational resources. In this publication, we test a new way of simulating glaciers. This approach produces the same results but has the advantage that it needs much less computation time. As simulations can be obtained with fewer computation resources, higher resolution and physics become affordable.\n\nAssessing effects of climate and technology uncertainties in large natural resource allocation problems\n\nJevgenijs Steinbuks, Yongyang Cai, Jonas Jaegermeyr, and Thomas W. Hertel\n\nGeosci.

The paper's key insight is to illustrate how much global cropland will expand when future crop yields are unknown. The study finds the range of outcomes for land use change to be smaller when using this novel method compared to existing deterministic models.\n\nVISIR-2: ship weather routing in Python\n\nGianandrea Mannarini, Mario Leonardo Salinas, Lorenzo Carelli, Nicola Petacco, and Josip OroviÄ\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4355–4382, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4355-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4355-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nShip weather routing has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions, but it currently lacks open and verifiable research. The Python-refactored VISIR-2 model considers currents, waves, and wind to optimise routes. The model was validated, and its computational performance is quasi-linear. For a ferry sailing in the Mediterranean Sea, VISIR-2 yields the largest percentage emission savings for upwind navigation. Given the vessel performance curve, the model is generalisable across various vessel types.\n\nIncremental analysis update (IAU) in the Model for Prediction Across Scales coupled with the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (MPASâJEDI 2.0.0)\n\nSoyoung Ha, Jonathan J.

The module is included in the AirTraf 3.0 submodel and uses weather conditions simulated by the EMAC atmospheric model. This paper focuses on the ability of SolFinder to identify eco-efficient trajectories, reducing a flight's climate impact at limited cost penalties.\n\nDeveloping meshing workflows in Gmsh v4.11 for the geologic uncertainty assessment of high-temperature aquifer thermal energy storage\n\nAli Dashti, Jens C. Grimmer, Christophe Geuzaine, Florian Bauer, and Thomas Kohl\n\nGeosci.

The workflow allows for importing several geological models as input for Gmsh and later exporting the same number of high-quality meshes. This way, geological uncertainty is directly included in the numerical simulations. This study evaluates the impact of the geological uncertainty on thermohydraulic performance of two reservoirs for high-temperature heat storage applications.\n\nDevelopment and preliminary validation of a land surface image assimilation system based on the Common Land Model\n\nWangbin Shen, Zhaohui Lin, Zhengkun Qin, and Juan Li\n\nGeosci.

The findings demonstrate that the assimilation of surface soil moisture observation images effectively and reasonably enhances the spatial structure of soil moisture analysis field.\n\nNorSand4AI: a comprehensive triaxial test simulation database for NorSand constitutive model materials\n\nLuan Carlos de Sena Monteiro Ozelim, MichÃ©le Dal ToÃ© Casagrande, and AndrÃ© LuÃ­s Brasil Cavalcante\n\nGeosci.

Each dataset is a 4000×10 matrix applicable for multivariate forecasting and geotechnical simulations. In addition, a new Python code is introduced, empowering researchers to leverage Python packages for NorSand analyses.\n\nParticleDA.jl v.1.0: a distributed particle-filtering data assimilation package\n\nDaniel Giles, Matthew M.

Progress for researchers is currently limited by a lack of tools to run these models effectively and efficiently. A key challenge is the optimal use of high-performance computing environments. The work presented here focuses on a developed open-source software platform which aims to improve this usage, with an emphasis placed on flexibility, efficiency, and scalability.\n\nHETerogeneous vectorized or Parallel (HETPv1.0): an updated inorganic heterogeneous chemistry solver for the metastable-state NH4+âNa+âCa2+âK+âMg2+âSO42ââNO3ââClââH2O system based on ISORROPIA II\n\nStefan J.

Cruden, and Robin Armit\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 1975–1993, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1975-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1975-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrevious work has demonstrated that adding geological knowledge to modelling methods creates more accurate and reliable models. Following this reasoning, we added constraints from magma emplacement mechanisms into existing modelling frameworks to improve the 3D characterisation of igneous intrusions. We tested the method on synthetic and real-world case studies, and the results show that our method can reproduce intrusion morphologies with no manual processing and using realistic datasets.\n\nEstimating volcanic ash emissions using retrieved satellite ash columns and inverse ash transport modeling using VolcanicAshInversion v1.2.1, within the operational eEMEP (emergency European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme) volcanic plume forecasting system (version rv4_17)\n\nAndrÃ© R. Brodtkorb, Anna Benedictow, Heiko Klein, Arve Kylling, Agnes Nyiri, Alvaro Valdebenito, Espen Sollum, and Nina Kristiansen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 1957–1974, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1957-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1957-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIt is vital to know the extent and concentration of volcanic ash in the atmosphere during a volcanic eruption. Whilst satellite imagery may give an estimate of the ash right now (assuming no cloud coverage), we also need to know where it will be in the coming hours. This paper presents a method for estimating parameters for a volcanic eruption based on satellite observations of ash in the atmosphere. The software package is open source and applicable to similar inversion scenarios.\n\nAccounting for uncertainties in forecasting tropical-cyclone-induced compound flooding\n\nKees Nederhoff, Maarten van Ormondt, Jay Veeramony, Ap van Dongeren, JosÃ© Antonio Ãlvarez AntolÃ­nez, Tim Leijnse, and Dano Roelvink\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 1789–1811, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1789-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1789-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nForecasting tropical cyclones and their flooding impact is challenging. Our research introduces the Tropical Cyclone Forecasting Framework (TC-FF), enhancing cyclone predictions despite uncertainties. TC-FF generates global wind and flood scenarios, valuable even in data-limited regions. Applied to cases like Cyclone Idai, it showcases potential in bettering disaster preparation, marking progress in handling cyclone threats.\n\nAn automatic mesh generator for coupled 1Dâ2D hydrodynamic models\n\nYounghun Kang and Ethan J. Kubatko\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 1603–1625, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1603-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1603-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModels used to simulate the flow of coastal and riverine waters, including flooding, require a geometric representation (or mesh) of geographic features that exhibit a range of disparate spatial scales from large, open waters to small, narrow channels. Representing these features in an accurate way without excessive computational overhead presents a challenge. Here, we develop an automatic mesh generation tool to help address this challenge. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.\n\nNumerical coupling of aerosol emissions, dry removal, and turbulent mixing in the E3SM Atmosphere Model version 1 (EAMv1) â Part 1: Dust budget analyses and the impacts of a revised coupling scheme\n\nHui Wan, Kai Zhang, Christopher J. Vogl, Carol S. Woodward, Richard C. Easter, Philip J. Rasch, Yan Feng, and Hailong Wang\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 1387–1407, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1387-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1387-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSophisticated numerical models of the Earth's atmosphere include representations of many physical and chemical processes. In numerical simulations, these processes need to be calculated in a certain sequence. This study reveals the weaknesses of the sequence of calculations used for aerosol processes in a global atmosphere model. A revision of the sequence is proposed and its impacts on the simulated global aerosol climatology are evaluated.\n\nNumerical coupling of aerosol emissions, dry removal, and turbulent mixing in the E3SM Atmosphere Model version 1 (EAMv1) â Part 2: A semi-discrete error analysis framework for assessing coupling schemes\n\nChristopher J. Vogl, Hui Wan, Carol S. Woodward, and Quan M. Bui\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 1409–1428, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1409-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1409-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGenerally speaking, accurate climate simulation requires an accurate evolution of the underlying mathematical equations on large computers. The equations are typically formulated and evolved in process groups. Process coupling refers to how the evolution of each group is combined with that of other groups to evolve the full set of equations for the whole atmosphere. This work presents a mathematical framework to evaluate methods without the need to first implement the methods.\n\njsmetrics v0.2.0: a Python package for metrics and algorithms used to identify or characterise atmospheric jet streams\n\nTom Keel, Chris Brierley, and Tamsin Edwards\n\nGeosci.

Establishing trends in the operation of jet streams may provide some indication of the future of weather in a warming world. Despite this, it has not been easy to establish trends, as many methods have been used to characterise them in data. We introduce a tool containing various implementations of jet stream statistics and algorithms that works in a standardised manner.\n\nP3D-BRNS v1.0.0: a three-dimensional, multiphase, multicomponent, pore-scale reactive transport modelling package for simulating biogeochemical processes in subsurface environments\n\nAmir Golparvar, Matthias KÃ¤stner, and Martin Thullner\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 881–898, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-881-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-881-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoupled reaction transport modelling is an established and beneficial method for studying natural and synthetic porous material, with applications ranging from industrial processes to natural decompositions in terrestrial environments. Up to now, a framework that explicitly considers the porous structure (e.g. from µ-CT images) for modelling the transport of reactive species is missing. We presented a model that overcomes this limitation and represents a novel numerical simulation toolbox.\n\nMinVoellmy v1: a lightweight model for simulating rapid mass movements based on a modified Voellmy rheology\n\nStefan Hergarten\n\nGeosci.

Recently, a modified version of this rheology was proposed, which turned out to be able to predict the observed long runout of large rock avalanches theoretically. The software MinVoellmy presented here is the first numerical implementation of the modified rheology. It consists of MATLAB and Python classes, where simplicity and parsimony were the design goals.\n\nScalable Feature Extraction and Tracking (SCAFET): a general framework for feature extraction from large climate data sets\n\nArjun Babu Nellikkattil, Danielle Lemmon, Travis Allen O'Brien, June-Yi Lee, and Jung-Eun Chu\n\nGeosci.

SCAFET stands out by using innovative shape-based metrics to identify features without relying on preconceived assumptions about the climate model or mean state. This approach allows more accurate comparisons between different models and scenarios.\n\nSweep interpolation: a cost-effective semi-Lagrangian scheme in the Global Environmental Multiscale model\n\nMohammad Mortezazadeh, Jean-FranÃ§ois Cossette, Ashu Dastoor, Jean de GrandprÃ©, Irena Ivanova, and Abdessamad Qaddouri\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 335–346, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-335-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-335-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe interpolation process is the most computationally expensive step of the semi-Lagrangian (SL) approach. In this paper we implement a new interpolation scheme into the semi-Lagrangian approach which has the same computational cost as a third-order polynomial scheme but with the accuracy of a fourth-order interpolation scheme. This improvement is achieved by using two third-order backward and forward polynomial interpolation schemes in two consecutive time steps.\n\nCHONK 1.0: landscape evolution framework: cellular automata meets graph theory\n\nBoris Gailleton, Luca C.

The method helps in monitoring with details on the timing and travel path of material eroded from the mountain ranges. It is particularly well suited to studies juxtaposing different domains – lakes or multiple rock types, for example – and enables the combination of different processes.\n\nCalibration of absorbing boundary layers for geoacoustic wave modeling in pseudo-spectral time-domain methods\n\nCarlos Spa, Otilio Rojas, and Josep de la Puente\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 7237–7252, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-7237-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-7237-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper develops a calibration methodology of all absorbing techniques typically used by Fourier pseudo-spectral time-domain (PSTD) methods for geoacoustic wave simulations. The main contributions of the paper are (a) an implementation and quantitative comparison of all absorbing techniques available for PSTD methods through a simple and robust numerical experiment, and (b) a validation of these absorbing techniques in several 3-D seismic scenarios with gradual heterogeneity complexities.\n\nGeoINR 1.0: an implicit neural network approach to three-dimensional geological modelling\n\nMichael Hillier, Florian Wellmann, Eric A. de Kemp, Boyan Brodaric, Ernst Schetselaar, and Karine BÃ©dard\n\nGeosci.

Existing neural network approaches for this type of modelling are advanced by the efficient incorporation of unconformities, new knowledge inputs, and improved data fitting techniques. These advances permit the modelling of more complex geology in diverse geological settings, different-sized areas, and various data regimes.\n\nA comparison of Eulerian and Lagrangian methods for vertical particle transport in the water column\n\nTor Nordam, Ruben Kristiansen, Raymond Nepstad, Erik van Sebille, and Andy M. Booth\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 5339–5363, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5339-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5339-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe describe and compare two common methods, Eulerian and Lagrangian models, used to simulate the vertical transport of material in the ocean. They both solve the same transport problems but use different approaches for representing the underlying equations on the computer. The main focus of our study is on the numerical accuracy of the two approaches. Our results should be useful for other researchers creating or using these types of transport models.\n\nAutoQS v1: automatic parametrization of QuickSampling based on training images analysis\n\nMathieu Gravey and GrÃ©goire Mariethoz\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 5265–5279, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5265-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5265-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMultipleâpoint geostatistics are widely used to simulate complex spatial structures based on a training image. The use of these methods relies on the possibility of finding optimal training images and parametrization of the simulation algorithms. Here, we propose finding an optimal set of parameters using only the training image as input. The main advantage of our approach is to remove the risk of overfitting an objective function.\n\nImplementation and application of ensemble optimal interpolation on an operational chemistry weather model for improving PM2.5 and visibility predictions\n\nSiting Li, Ping Wang, Hong Wang, Yue Peng, Zhaodong Liu, Wenjie Zhang, Hongli Liu, Yaqiang Wang, Huizheng Che, and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 4171–4191, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-4171-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-4171-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOptimizing the initial state of atmospheric chemistry model input is one of the most essential methods to improve forecast accuracy. Considering the large computational load of the model, we introduce an ensemble optimal interpolation scheme (EnOI) for operational use and efficient updating of the initial fields of chemical components. The results suggest that EnOI provides a practical and cost-effective technique for improving the accuracy of chemical weather numerical forecasts.\n\nA dynamical core based on a discontinuous Galerkin method for higher-order finite-element sea ice modeling\n\nThomas Richter, VÃ©ronique Dansereau, Christian Lessig, and Piotr Minakowski\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 3907–3926, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3907-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3907-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSea ice covers not only the pole regions but affects the weather and climate globally. For example, its white surface reflects more sunlight than land. The oceans around the poles are therefore kept cool, which affects the circulation in the oceans worldwide. Simulating the behavior and changes in sea ice on a computer is, however, very difficult. We propose a new computer simulation that better models how cracks in the ice change over time and show this by comparing to other simulations.\n\nGStatSim V1.0: a Python package for geostatistical interpolation and conditional simulation\n\nEmma J. MacKie, Michael Field, Lijing Wang, Zhen Yin, Nathan Schoedl, Matthew Hibbs, and Allan Zhang\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 3765–3783, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3765-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3765-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEarth scientists often have to fill in spatial gaps in measurements. This gap-filling or interpolation can be accomplished with geostatistical methods, where the statistical relationships between measurements are used to inform how these gaps should be filled. Despite the broad utility of these methods, there are few freely available geostatistical software applications. We present GStatSim, a Python package for performing different geostatistical interpolation methods.\n\nLeveraging Google's Tensor Processing Units for tsunami-risk mitigation planning in the Pacific Northwest and beyond\n\nIan Madden, Simone Marras, and Jenny Suckale\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 3479–3500, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3479-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3479-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo aid risk managers who may wish to rapidly assess tsunami risk but may lack high-performance computing infrastructure, we provide an accessible software package able to rapidly model tsunami inundation over real topography by leveraging Google's Tensor Processing Unit, a high-performance hardware. Minimally trained users can take advantage of the rapid modeling abilities provided by this package via a web browser thanks to the ease of use of Google Cloud Platform.\n\nAn improved subgrid channel model with upwind-form artificial diffusion for river hydrodynamics and floodplain inundation simulation\n\nYoutong Rong, Paul Bates, and Jeffrey Neal\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 3291–3311, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3291-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3291-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA novel subgrid channel (SGC) model is developed for river–floodplain modelling, allowing utilization of subgrid-scale bathymetric information while performing computations on relatively coarse grids. By including adaptive artificial diffusion, potential numerical instability, which the original SGC solver had, in low-friction regions such as urban areas is addressed. Evaluation of the new SGC model through structured tests confirmed that the accuracy and stability have improved.\n\nA model instability issue in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Forecast System version 16 and potential solutions\n\nXiaqiong Zhou and Hann-Ming Henry Juang\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 3263–3274, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3263-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3263-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Forecast System version 16 experienced model instability failures in real-time runs resolved by increasing the minimum thickness depth parameter. Further investigation revealed that the issue was caused by the advection of geopotential heights at the model's layer interfaces. By replacing high-order boundary conditions with zero-gradient boundary conditions for interface-wind reconstruction, the instability was effectively addressed.\n\nA comparison of 3-D spherical shell thermal convection results at low to moderate Rayleigh number using ASPECT (version 2.2.0) and CitcomS (version 3.3.1)\n\nGrant T. Euen, Shangxin Liu, Rene GassmÃ¶ller, Timo Heister, and Scott D. King\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 3221–3239, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3221-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3221-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDue to the increasing availability of high-performance computing over the past few decades, numerical models have become an important tool for research. Here we test two geodynamic codes that produce such models: ASPECT, a newer code, and CitcomS, an older one. We show that they produce solutions that are extremely close. As methods and codes become more complex over time, showing reproducibility allows us to seamlessly link previously known information to modern methodologies.\n\nLISFLOOD-FP 8.1: new GPU-accelerated solvers for faster fluvial/pluvial flood simulations\n\nMohammad Kazem Sharifian, Georges Kesserwani, Alovya Ahmed Chowdhury, Jeffrey Neal, and Paul Bates\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 2391–2413, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-2391-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-2391-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper describes a new release of the LISFLOOD-FP model for fast and efficient flood simulations. It features a new non-uniform grid generator that uses multiwavelet analyses to sensibly coarsens the resolutions where the local topographic variations are smooth. Moreover, the model is parallelised on the graphical processing units (GPUs) to further boost computational efficiency. The performance of the model is assessed for five real-world case studies, noting its potential applications.\n\nMeasurement Error Proxy System Models: MEPSM v0.2\n\nMatt J. Fischer\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-643,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-643, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn paleoclimate research, proxy system models or PSMs model chemical or biological systems which receive environmental inputs, and output e.g. geochemical signals. The environmental inputs are rarely noiseless, which causes problems when calibrating multi-input PSMs. Here a PSM is developed which includes generalized noise in both model inputs and outputs, and prior information. A quasi-Bayesian method enhances the stability of the solution of the Measurement Error Proxy System Model.\n\nFast approximate Barnes interpolation: illustrated by Python-Numba implementation fast-barnes-py v1.0\n\nBruno K. ZÃ¼rcher\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 1697–1711, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1697-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1697-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a novel algorithm to efficiently compute Barnes interpolation, which is a method for transforming data values recorded at irregularly spaced points into a corresponding regular grid. In contrast to naive implementations with an algorithmic complexity that depends on the product of the number of sample points and the number of grid points, our approach reduces this dependency to their sum.\n\nStrategies for conservative and non-conservative monotone remapping on the sphere\n\nDavid H. Marsico and Paul A. Ullrich\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 1537–1551, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1537-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1537-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate models involve several different components, such as the atmosphere, ocean, and land models. Information needs to be exchanged, or remapped, between these models, and devising algorithms for performing this exchange is important for ensuring the accuracy of climate simulations. In this paper, we examine the efficacy of several traditional and novel approaches to remapping on the sphere and demonstrate where our approaches offer improvement.\n\nModeling largeâscale landform evolution with a stream power law for glacial erosion (OpenLEM v37): benchmarking experiments against a more process-based description of ice flow (iSOSIA v3.4.3)\n\nMoritz Liebl, JÃ¶rg Robl, Stefan Hergarten, David Lundbek Egholm, and Kurt StÃ¼we\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 1315–1343, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1315-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1315-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we benchmark a topography-based model for glacier erosion (OpenLEM) with a well-established process-based model (iSOSIA). Our experiments show that large-scale erosion patterns and particularly the transformation of valley length geometry from fluvial to glacial conditions are very similar in both models. This finding enables the application of OpenLEM to study the influence of climate and tectonics on glaciated mountains with reasonable computational effort on standard PCs.\n\nA mixed fini"
