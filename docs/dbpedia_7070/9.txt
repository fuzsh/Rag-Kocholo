Introduction of the Iris Runge Program

Under the umbrella of the Iris Runge Program, various gender equality measures at the Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics (WIAS) are bundled to promote the career development of female scientists and to enable them to remain in science.

The Iris Runge Postdoc Program aims to promote women in math on their career path after their doctorate. It is intended for postdocs in the early stage up to three years after completing their doctorate. WIAS offers a two-plus one-year postdoc position in one of its research groups. After the first call for applications in September 2023, the first two participants started their work at WIAS in January 2024.

On March 18, 2024, we want to officially launch the Iris Runge Postdoc Program and also open an exhibition on women in mathematics. Along with the introduction of our first two program participants, who will each give a short scientific talk, the program features a talk by Renate Tobies on Iris Runge and the opening of the touring exhibition Women of Mathematics from around the world â€“ a gallery of portraits, for which various female mathematicians from around the world have been portrayed and interviewed, in our library.

Further information can be found here. The event will take place in English and is free of charge, please register here by March 13th, 2024.
