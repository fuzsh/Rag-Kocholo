This document provides an introduction to the autobiography \"Daisy Princess of Pless\" written by Mary Theresa Olivia Cornwallis-West, Princess of Pless. It summarizes that the Princess was from an aristocratic English family and married Prince Henry of Pless in 1891, becoming immersed in German court life which she found rigid and stifling in contrast to her upbringing. While her beauty made her famous, the strict etiquette and lavish lifestyle at the courts of Pless and Fiirstenstein bored her. The introduction describes the rebuilding of Fiirstenstein castle over 20 years through World War I and notes many German aristocrats corresponded in English.",
