        "text": "It’s late on July 1st 1694 and a young man rows silently along Hanover’s Leine river. The handsome soldier and aristocrat is on a mission, aided only by moonlight. I couldn’t say for certain, as no-one captured the specifics – but I imagine him doing his best to keep to the shadows as he floated by – bobbing and weaving to avoid detection from guards and onlookers alike. His heart aflutter, the young man reaches the Leineschloss – the palatial home of the Duke of Hanover and his family. He moors his boat, then cautiously enters the property.\n\nThis man is Phillipp Christoph, Count Königsmarck. A German born Swede from a long line of mercenaries, Konigsmarck was a fighter as much as he was a lover. His grandfather had served King Gustav II Adolph in the 30 Years War, rising up the ranks to Field Marshall. His father and uncle also held high rank, and saw active service. At one time Phillipp himself had served another Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I, in the fight against the Ottoman Empire. At this point in time however, Phillipp was under the employ of the Elector of Saxony. He’d had no intention of being anywhere near Hanover tonight, but then a note arrived – he’d been summoned by his paramour – Sophia Dorothea, princess of Celle – the terribly unhappy wife of Duke Georg Ludwig.\n\nOn his arrival one presumes Sophia was nonplussed – she’d never summoned the Count. All the same – and full disclosure, this may or may not have happened – I imagine her ecstatic on his arrival. The couple haven’t seen each other for weeks, and there was so much to discuss about life in Saxony, and the future. She must have also been infuriated by ‘that other woman’s’ gall. “Well, clearly the bitch is still spying on us” I imagine one saying “Never mind, in a day this nightmare will be well behind us” the other may have replied. With rather less poetic license you can imagine the rest of their night – they are two star-crossed lovers after all…\n\nAt some point, however, the Count bid the Princess a fond adieu, and this would be the last time Princess Sophia Dorothea would see her lover. In the following hours, Count Königsmarck would disappear from the face of the Earth, never to be seen again.\n\n‘The Firm’\n\nTo explain the preceding scene – we need to go back a ways, and meet the rest of the cast. First we should say a thing or two about our location. The region we’re in falls within the borders of modern Germany. Germany wouldn’t come to be until January 1871, when 25 various small kingdoms, Grand Duchies, Duchies, States and Republics all came together under that one banner. Most of these independent nations formed out of the ashes of the Napoleonic wars. Prior to that – the time we’re currently in – Germany was a vast patchwork of states, overseen by the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nBetween 1346 and the destruction of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, some states were more important than others. The title Holy Roman Emperor was bestowed by vote – the empire being an elective monarchy. For most of the history of the empire, only seven states were electors – the people who voted. There was some excitement in 1623 when the Count Palatinate of the Rhine lost voting privileges over the Bohemian Revolt – the incident that started the Thirty Years War. The House of Wittlesbach’s loss was the Duke of Bavaria’s gain. In our time there were rumblings Hanover were due to become the eighth elector state – for their exemplary service in the Thirty Years War – but only if they did nothing stupid to ruin their chances.\n\nNow it bears stating in 1694 a combined Hanover itself was a very new state. In the 1260s the area was split into two duchies – let’s call them Brunswick- Celle and Brunswick- Luneberg, their recent names – though they went through a number of name changes. They were originally split to accomodate two feuding brothers who both wished to be Duke.\n\nThe two Brunswicks in our time were also ruled over by two brothers; Duke Georg Wilhelm of Brunswick- Celle, and Duke Ernst August of Brunswick- Luneberg. If rancour split the duchy in the first place – in a weird way, it was love and marriage that brought Hanover back together.\n\nGeorg Wilhelm was engaged to a princess from the neighbouring duchy of Rhineland Palatinate – she was another Princess Sophia – but Georg didn’t love her, and was far from ready to give up his bachelor lifestyle. Georg made the unusual move in a world of arranged marriages, of cancelling their engagement. Several leading figures in the duchy were furious over this, but were placated when Georg promised he would never marry. His brother Ernst would marry Sophia, and go down the usual aristocratic path of having heirs. What’s more, when Georg passed, his duchy would pass to either his brother, or his brother’s heir – reuniting the lands. Georg signed legal agreements stating as much. Everything was fine, until Georg fell in love with his mistress, a beautiful Frenchwoman Eleonore d’Olbreuse in 1665. The couple entered into a Morganatic marriage, and had a daughter together, our princess Sophia Dorothea.\n\nThe leading figures in duchies were again furious, seeing the marriage as a betrayal. Things got even more complicated when Georg approached Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I asking for permission to officially marry Eleonore. Leopold gave his blessing, many years after the fact – Sophia Dorothea was ten years old when permission was finally granted. But there was a caveat to Leopold’s blessing – Georg had a daughter, Ernst and Sophia now had a son named Georg Ludwig. The two cousins would marry, ensuring the duchies united. This suited everyone, but the two cousins, who detested one another. Regardless, the couple wed on 21st November 1682.\n\nTo add another twist in the tale – it was perfectly permissible at the time for the men to openly have affairs with other women. While married to Sophia Dorothea, Georg Ludwig had affairs with other women. As did his father, Ernst. Ernst’s mistress is a person to know in this tale – her name Countess Clara von Platen.\n\nThe Königsmarck brothers.\n\nWe’ll come back to that lot in a second, but first let’s introduce Count Königsmarck. He has quite the backstory.\n\nPhillipp Christoph von Königsmarck’s family originated from the city of Brandenburg, though of recent generations they had been in the service of the Swedish royal family, working as high ranking mercenaries. His grandfather, Count Hans Christoff von Königsmarck was the Field Marshall who led Sweden’s legendary ‘Flying Column’ in the capture of Prague Castle in 1648. Essentially he fought the final battle of the Thirty Years War at the place where the war started.\n\nIn his mid teens, Phillipp and his brother Karl were sent to England. They were bundled off to learn gentlemanly ways at the court of Charles II, but both brothers soon, learnt other ‘gentlemanly ways.’ Both young men soon found themselves in trouble. Phillipp discovered the gambling tables, and lost huge sums of money. Karl Königsmarck’s trouble was on a whole different level.\n\nWhile at court Karl became smitten with Elizabeth Seymour, Duchess of Somerset. Elizabeth was caught in a loveless, arranged marriage to a wealthy, cheating husband – the wealthy landowner and member of parliament Thomas Thynne. Affairs are one thing, but on 12th February 1682, Thynne was travelling through Pall Mall in a carriage, when three armed men – Christopher Vratz, John Stern and George Borosky gunned him down. The assassins were quickly captured, and they flipped on Karl Königsmarck, who hired them to murder Thynne. The three assassins were hanged for the deed. Karl was let out on bail. The Königsmarck brothers, now outcasts, and worried one of Thynne’s relatives might take a hit out on them, legged it to Europe. Once back on the mainland, they both enrolled in Emperor Leopold’s army.\n\nIt was around this time 15 year old Phillipp first met 16 year old Sophia Dorothea in Hanover. The teens were smitten with one another – but, alas she was due to marry her blockhead cousin. He was about to be sent off to war.\n\nPhillipp’s brother Karl was killed in action in 1686 fighting the Turks in Greece. As I’ve nowhere else to shoehorn this in – Not long after Thomas Thynne’s murder, an anonymously written poem circulated throughout London.\n\n“Here lies Tom Thynne of Longleat Hall\n\nWho ne’er would have miscarried;\n\nHad he married the woman he slept withal\n\nOr slept with the woman he married.”\n\nLet the Dangerous Liaisons begin.\n\nIn 1688, after eight long years service in the wars against the Ottomans, Phillipp Königsmarck returned to the Hanoverian court. Many ladies at court swooned for the dashing, young soldier. Initially he became a close friend and confidant of Sophia Dorothea – a sympathetic ear who would keep confidential her tales of her horrid husband, diabolical in-laws, and her stepfather’s terrifying mistress – the Countess Platen. Phillipp may have been a good listener, but clearly lacked common sense, as he was soon wooed by – and engaged in an ill advised affair with Clara von Platen.\n\nBut the Count soon realised he felt more than friendship towards Princess Sophia Dorothea. He’d also come to the conclusion Countess Platen was a dangerous lunatic one should avoid at all costs. He took up a new military commission and left Hanover, hoping the Countess would forget about him. Did he hope to forget about Sophia Dorothea? In both cases he was terribly unsuccessful.\n\nOn his return to the court in the spring of 1690, the Count appears to have begun his wooing of the Princess. By 1692 they were undeniably having an affair. The Countess, meanwhile resumed her wooing of the Count. The Countess’ advances were unreciprocated – so she hired spies to follow Königsmarck. Those spies discovered the royal affair. Soon the Countess was intercepting all their love letters. By 1693, the couple were aware of this, as the Countess could no longer be bothered repairing the broken seals on the letters. Phillipp resumed his affair with Countess Platen, hoping this would buy her silence. But before long the pressure of all these dangerous liaisons got too much for them. In January 1694, Princess Sophia Dorothea visited her parents, asking if she could abandon her marriage. Her parents sent her back to the Leineschloss. Count Königsmarck and Princess Sophia Dorothea decided they had no option but to run away together.\n\nBut first, their biggest hurdle was money. Phillipp was a gambler who was lousy with money. Princess Sophia had ceded everything she had to her husband on their wedding day.\n\nIn May 1694 Phillipp took a commission as a Major General with the elector of Saxony’s cavalry, in Dresden. Sophia sat tight and waited for Phillipp to accrue some money. On 1st July, at the urging of the counterfeit letter, Phillipp returned to Hanover. Whether he suspected a trap or not, it must have seemed a safe time to drop in. Most of the court were away at their summer houses – Georg. Ludwig included. We know Count Königsmarck arrived at the Leineschloss, though it is only speculated he met with the Princess that night. If he did get to her, at some point he went out. We do know the Princess was up all night with her lady in waiting, packing her belongings for the following day’s elopement.\n\nThe following day Count Königsmarck was nowhere to be found. A distraught Princess Sophia Dorothea was severely limited in what she could ask – she certainly couldn’t go out searching for her lover. For a time a rumour circulated around the courts about the two, but both vociferously denied the rumour, putting it to bed, right? Even asking questions about the Count could stoke that fire. Eventually the scuttlebutt from the markets reached the Princess – Allegedly “the witches of Dresden…” lured Phillipp away.\n\nSo…. what happened?\n\nThe disappearance of the Count is usually played up as some big mystery. I don’t believe there is anything terribly mysterious about his disappearance. Far more likely than not, four cavaliers got into a fight with Count Königsmarck, and the count was stabbed to death. It is presumed Countess Platen had set the trap, with her letter to the Count – this was very much her modus operandi. One presumes Count Königsmarck’s journey along the Leine did not go unnoticed – and either the Countess, or one of her spies caught sight of the couple.\n\nThat night Clara von Platen rushed to her lover, Duke Ernst. She spilled the beans on the affair and planned elopement.\n\nIt is a matter of public record Duke Ernst sent four cavaliers out to arrest Count Königsmarck. Many years after the fact, two of those men gave evidence. They caught up with the Count outside of the Leineschloss, but the Count drew his sword on them. Seasoned warrior or not, the cavaliers got the best of him, stabbing the Count to death. Neither man gave away the location of the body.\n\nThe most common theory claimed his body was simply thrown into the Leine river, weighed down with rocks – but others have suggested his corpse was immolated, or buried somewhere on the grounds. In 2016 there was much excitement when bones were dug up at the Leineschloss, newspapers across the world wondered aloud if Count Königsmarck had finally been found – but DNA testing showed the bones belonged to five separate men, none of whom were the Count.\n\nWas the killing an accident? Probably not. The man believed to have dealt the killing blow, Don Nicolò Montalbano, was suddenly rich – having been gifted 150,000 Talers. By way of comparison, this was equivalent to 100 years wages for the highest paid civil servant in the land. It was equivalent to 750 years of wages for Montalbano. Duke Ernst did send these men out, but it doesn’t automatically stand that he gave the order to kill. It could have as easily come from Georg Ludwig, or Countess Platen. Had the lovers disappeared, Georg would have been seen as a cuckold in the eyes of the people – in spite of their marriage being mutually loveless, and his own dalliances. Could he have bore this indignity? Had the wealthy Countess given the order, this might have been a case of ‘hell hath no fury’ after all?\n\nPersonally, I’ve always been a tiny bit suspicious of the claim Georg gave the order. The affair was eventually uncovered – though Princess Sophia Dorothea denied it till her dying day. But the couple didn’t divorce until December 1694 – after which Georg Ludwig exiled Sophia Dorothea to house arrest at nearby Alden Castle. The Princess remained a prisoner there till she passed on 32 years later. Was Georg aware of the rumours? Probably. Did he have the patience to wait six months before he imprisoned the Princess?\n\nDid Countess Platen arrange the killing? Besides her two lovers, she was still married to a man named Count Franz von Platen-Hellermund. One presumes in the time this all occurred the Countess would have struggled to gather together such a large sum of money for the killer without tipping off her husband?\n\nOf the three, Ernst August seems the more likely to have given the order. They were on the verge of becoming an elector state after all. Would a Royal scandal have jeopardised that opportunity? At the end of the day, the murky tale would out – in no small part because Georg Ludwig would become something of a big shot in just a few years time.\n\nYou see, Sophia the elder, Georg’s mother, was something of a big deal herself. Her grandfather had been James I, King of England. Their dynasty was briefly interrupted when her uncle, Charles I was deposed, then beheaded by Oliver Cromwell – but then her nephew Charles II was returned to the throne in 1660. In 1685 Charles II died leaving 14 illegitimate children, but no heirs.\n\nThis led to the crown being passed to Charles’ brother James II. Both Charles II and James II were in an awkward position, in regards their religious affiliations. As mentioned in the Tallysticks episode, Charles had secretly converted to Catholicism as part of an agreement with the French crown. Charles needed the money. France needed a Catholic ally. They always expected Charles to announce his conversion – which he only did in his final months.\n\nJames II also converted to Catholicism in 1669, and his conversion was a nuisance, but not seen as a huge impediment – at least as long as his heirs presumptive were his Protestant daughters from his first marriage. There were occasional clashes and incidents between James and Parliament, but nothing too serious. but then James remarried, to the Catholic Italian princess Mary of Modena. In 1688 she gave birth to a son – the new heir apparent, James. This ensured the dynasty would go Catholic on James’ eventual succession.\n\nThis prompted the ‘Glorious Rebellion’ of 1688. In November the entire Dutch Navy sailed down the River Thames and carried out a palace coup with significant aristocratic backing. It ushered in a period of joint rule by James II’s daughter Mary, and her husband – the Dutch William of Orange.\n\nBut then the line of succession got very murky. By 1702 William and Mary had passed on. Having never had children, the crown passed to Mary’s sister Anne. Historically there have been all kinds of rumours around Anne, and whether she was gay, or bisexual – whether she was or not, she still fell pregnant 18 times in service of the nation. She suffered six miscarriages, five stillbirths, and none of her remaining children lived beyond the age of two.\n\nNow because Parliament passed the Act of Settlement in 1701, banning Catholics from the crown; and because Anne had no living children – for most of Anne’s reign, Georg’s mother Sophia was the heir presumptive. This was in spite of her being somewhere in the order of 24th in line – were it not for the ban on Catholics. She never got to become Queen, however, as she died before Anne. Georg Ludwig, a weird guy from a small German duchy – with an ex wife locked in his tower – ascended to the throne following Anne’s death on August 1st 1714. He skipped nearly 60 higher ranked, but Catholic, suitors for the crown. As George I of Britain, he established the House of Hanover, ruling till his death in 1727.\n\nGeorge’s bloodline carries on. The current King, Charles III is directly related to George through both sides of his family."
