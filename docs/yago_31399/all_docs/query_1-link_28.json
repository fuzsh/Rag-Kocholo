        "text": "Frederik I (October 7, 1471 – April 10, 1533) was King of Denmark and Norway. He was the last Roman Catholic monarch to reign over Denmark and Norway, when subsequent monarchs embraced Lutheranism after the Protestant Reformation.\n\nAs King of Norway, Frederik is most remarkable in never having visited the country and was never crowned as King of Norway. Therefore, he was styled King of Denmark, the Vends and the Goths, elected King of Norway.\n\nFrederik’s reign began the enduring tradition of calling Kings of Denmark alternatively by the names Christian and Frederick, which has continued up to the reign of the current monarch, Margrethe II.\n\nFrederik was the younger son of the first Danish king of the House of Oldenburg, King Christian I of Denmark, Norway and Sweden (1426–81) and of Dorothea of Brandenburg (1430–95), a Hohenzollern Princess and the daughter of Johann, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, and Barbara of Saxe-Wittenberg.\n\nDorothea of Brandenburg became a Scandinavian Queen by marriage under the Kalmar Union. She was Queen of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden from her marriage to King Christopher III of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden in 1445 until King Christopher III died in 1448.\n\nQueen Dorothea was given a proposal from King Casimir IV of Poland and Albrecht VI, Archduke of Austria, but she chose to remain in Denmark and marry the newly elected king, Christian I of Denmark.\n\nKing Christian I of Denmark and Dorothea of Brandenburg had three children:\n\n1. Johann, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. He married Christina of Saxony.\n\n2. Margaret. She married King James III of Scotland\n\n3. Friedrich I, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden\n\nThe dynasty King Christian founded, the House of Oldenburg, remains on the throne of Denmark through the collateral branch, the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (also known as Glücksburg). This royal house was on the throne of Norway until 1818, returning there again from 1905, and also on the throne of Sweden during Christian’s reign there and those of his son and grandson, but also 1751–1818.\n\nSoon after the death of his father, the underage Frederik was elected co-Duke of Schleswig and Holstein in 1482, the other co-duke being his elder brother, King Johann of Denmark. In 1490 at Frederik’s majority, both duchies were divided between the brothers.\n\nIn 1500, he had convinced his brother King Johann to conquer Dithmarschen. A great army was called from not only the duchies, but with additions from all of the Kalmar Union for which his brother briefly was king. In addition, numerous German mercenaries took part. The expedition failed miserably, however, in the Battle of Hemmingstedt, where one-third of all knights of Schleswig and Holstein lost their lives.\n\nReign\n\nWhen his brother, King Johann, died, a group of Jutish nobles had offered Frederik the throne as early as 1513, but he had declined, rightly believing that the majority of the Danish nobility would be loyal to his nephew King Christian II.\n\nIn 1523, King Christian II was forced by disloyal nobles to abdicate as King of Denmark and Norway, and Frederik took the throne of Denmark in 1523 and was elected King of Norway in 1524.\n\nIt is not certain that Frederik ever learned to speak Danish. After becoming king, he continued spending most of his time at Gottorp, a castle and estate in the city of Schleswig.\n\nIn 1524 and 1525, King Frederik had to suppress revolts among the peasants in Agder, Jutland and Scania who demanded the restoration of King Christian II. The high point of the rebellion came in 1525 when Søren Norby, the governor (statholder) of Gotland, invaded Blekinge in an attempt to restore Christian II to power.\n\nHe raised 8000 men who besieged Kärnan (Helsingborgs slott), a castle in Helsingborg. Frederick’s general, Johann Rantzau, moved his army to Scania and defeated the peasants soundly in April and May 1525.\n\nKing Frederik played a central role in the spread of Lutheran teaching throughout Denmark. In his coronation charter, he was made the solemn protector (værner) of Roman Catholicism in Denmark. In that role, he asserted his right to select bishops for the Roman Catholic dioceses in the country.\n\nKing Christian II had been intolerant of Protestant teaching, but King Frederik took a more opportunist approach. For example, he ordered that Lutherans and Roman Catholics share the same churches and encouraged the first publication of the Bible in the Danish language. In 1526, when Lutheran Reformer Hans Tausen was threatened with arrest and trial for heresy, King Frederik appointed him his personal chaplain to give him immunity.\n\nStarting in 1527, King Frederik authorized the closure of Franciscan houses and monasteries in 28 Danish cities. He used the popular anti-establishment feelings that ran against some persons of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and nobility of Denmark as well as keen propaganda to decrease the power of bishops and Roman Catholic nobles.\n\nDuring his reign, King Frederik was skillful enough to prevent all-out warfare between Protestants and Roman Catholics. In 1532, he succeeded in capturing King Christian II who had tried to invade Norway, and to make himself king of the country.\n\nKing Frederik died on April 10, 1533 in Gottorp, at the age of 61, and was buried in Schleswig Cathedral. Upon Frederik’s death, tensions between Roman Catholics and Protestants rose to a fever pitch which would result in the Count’s Feud (Grevens Fejde).\n\nKing Frederik I of Denmark, Norway and Sweden was succeeded by King Christian III of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. He married Archduchess Isabella of Austria (18 July 1501 – 19 January 1526), also known as Elizabeth, the daughter of Archduke Philipp of Austria, Duke of Burgundy (also King Felipe I of Castile) and his wife Queen Joanna of Castile and the sister of Emperor Charles V. She ruled Denmark as regent in 1520.\n\nMarriage and Family\n\nIn 1500 Prince Frederick of Denmark was betrothed to Princess Anna of Brandenburg (1487–1514), the daughter of Johann Cicero, Prince-Elector of Brandenburg and Margaret of Thuringia, the daughter of William III, Landgrave of Thuringia and Archduchess Anne of Austria, Duchess of Luxembourg suo jure. Archduchess Anne of Austria, was the eldest daughter of Albrecht II, King of the Romans/King of Germany, Archduke of Austria, and his wife Elisabeth of Luxembourg, the sole descendant of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nBecause they were second cousins (Frederik’s mother Dorothea of Brandenburg was the cousin of Anna’s father, Johann Cicero, Prince-Elector of Brandenburg) their marriage required a Papal dispensation by Pope Alexander VI.\n\nIn addition, the marriage was not held until April 10, 1502 due to Princess Anna’s youth. In 1500 the year of their betrothal Princess Anna was 13 and Prince Frederik was 29. Two years later Princess Anna was 15 and Prince Frederik was 31 respectively.\n\nThe marriage, held in Stendal, was a double one: on the same day, Anna’s brother Joachim and Frederick’s niece Elisabeth were married.\n\nThe couple had two children:\n\n1. Christian III, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden (1503 – 1559)\n\n2. Dorothea of Denmark (1504 – 1547), married Prince Albrecht of Brandenburg-Ansbach, Duke of Prussia. Prior to her marriage to Prince Albrecht of Brandenburg-Ansbach a marriage was suggested to the English claimant to the throne, Richard de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, who was supported by King François I of France, but without success.\n\nFrederick’s wife Anna died on May 5, 1514, aged 26 years old.\n\nFour years later on October 9, 1518 at Kiel, the 47 year-old Prince Frederik married Sophie of Pomerania (20 years old; 1498–1568), a daughter of Bogislaw “the Great”, Duke of Pomerania and the Polish princess, Anna Jagiellon, the fifth daughter of King Casimir IV of Poland of Poland and Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria, the daughter of Albrecht II, King of the Romans/Germany, Archduke of Austria, and his wife Elizabeth of Luxembourg, daughter of Emperor Sigismund.\n\nSophie and Frederick had six children:\n\n1. Johann II of Denmark, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev (1521 – 1580)\n\n2. Elizabeth of Denmark (14 October 1524 – 15 October 1586), married:\n\na) Duke Magnus III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nb) Duke Ulrich III of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\n3. Adolph of Denmark, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (1526 – 1586)\n\n4. Anna of Denmark (1527 – 1535)\n\n5. Dorothea of Denmark (1528 – 1575), married to Duke Christopher of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch.\n\n6. Frederik of Denmark (1532 – 1556), Prince-Bishop of Hildesheim and Bishop of Schleswig.\n\nChristian I (February 1426 – May 21, 1481) was a Scandinavian monarch under the Kalmar Union. He was King of Denmark (1448–1481), Norway (1450–1481) and Sweden (1457–1464). From 1460 to 1481, he was also Duke of Schleswig (within Denmark) and Count (after 1474, Duke) of Holstein (within the Holy Roman Empire). He was the first King of Denmark from the House of Oldenburg.\n\nEarly years\n\nChristian I was born in February 1426 in Oldenburg in Northern Germany as the eldest son of Count Dietrich of Oldenburg by his second wife, Helvig of Holstein (died 1436). Christian had two younger brothers, Maurice (1428–1464) and Gerhard (1430–1500), and one sister Adelheid.\n\nThrough his father, he belonged to the House of Oldenburg, a comital family established since the 12th century in an area west of the River Weser in north-western Germany. Based on the two strongholds of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, the family had gradually expanded its rule over the neighbouring Frisian tribes of the area.\n\nChristian’s father was called the Fortunate as he had reunited and expanded the family’s territory. Christian’s mother, Helvig, was a daughter of Gerhard VI, Count of Holstein, and a sister of Adolphus, Duke of Schleswig. Through his mother, Christian was also a cognatic descendant of King Eric V of Denmark through his second daughter Richeza (died 1308) and also a cognatic descendant of King Abel of Denmark through his daughter Sophie.\n\nThrough his father, Christian was a cognatic descendant of King Eric IV of Denmark through his daughter Sophia. Christian thus descended from the three surviving sons of Valdemar II and his second wife Berengaria of Portugal.\n\nAt the death of their father in 1440, Christian and his brothers jointly succeeded Dietrich as Count of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst. Christian was raised by his uncle, Duke Adolphus of Schleswig, Count of Holstein (1401–1459) as the childless duke wished for his young nephew to become his heir, and also succeeded in having Christian elected as his successor in the Duchy of Schleswig.\n\nKing of Denmark\n\nIn January 1448, King Christopher III of Denmark, Sweden and Norway died suddenly and without natural heirs. His death resulted in the break-up of the union of the three kingdoms, as Denmark and Sweden went their separate ways and Norway’s affiliation was unclear.\n\nIn the power vacuum that arose following the death of King Christopher III (1416–1448) without a direct heir, Sweden elected Carl Knutsson as King Carl VIII of Sweden (1408–1470) king with the intent to reestablish the union under a Swedish king. Carl VIII was elected as King Carl I of Norway in the following year.\n\nThe vacant Danish throne was first offered by the Council of the Realm to Duke Adolphus of Schleswig, being the most prominent feudal lord of Danish dominions. The duke declined and recommended his nephew, Count Christian of Oldenburg.\n\nBefore being elected, Christian had to promise to obey to the Constitutio Valdemariana, a provision in the ascension promissory of King Valdemar III of Denmark, that promised that in the future, the same person could never be both ruler of the Duchy of Schleswig and Denmark simultaneously.\n\nThe council also demanded that Christian should marry dowager queen Dorothea of Brandenburg (ca 1430–1495), widow of his predecessor King Christopher III. On September 1, 1448, after signing his ascension promissory, count Christian was elected to the Danish throne as King Christian I at the assembly in Viborg. His coronation was held on October 28, 1449, in the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen, at which occasion his marriage with dowager queen Dorothea was also celebrated.\n\nKing Christian I’s subsequent accessions to the thrones of Norway (in 1450) and Sweden (in 1457), restored the unity of the Kalmar Union for a short period. In 1463, Sweden broke away from the union and Christian’s attempt at a reconquest resulted in his defeat by the Swedish regent Sten Sture the Elder at the Battle of Brunkeberg in 1471.\n\nIn 1460, following the death of his uncle, Duke Adolphus of Schleswig, Count of Holstein, King Christian I also became Duke of Schleswig and Count of Holstein.\n\nChristopher of Bavaria (February 26, 1416 – January 5/6, 1448) was King of Denmark (1440–48, as Christopher III), Sweden (1441–48) and Norway (1442–48) during the era of the Kalmar Union.\n\nComing to power\n\nHe was the son of Johann, Count Palatine of Neumarkt (1383–1443) and Catherine of Pomerania (c. 1390–1426). Catherine was the daughter of Wartislaw VII, Duke of Pomerania in Pomerania-Stolp, and sister of the Scandinavian king, Eric III-VII-XIII of Pomerania. Count Palatine Johann was a son of King Rupert of Germany (1352–1410). Christopher was probably born at Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz in Upper Palatinate, in Bavaria, Germany.\n\nIn 1445, Christopher married Dorothea of Brandenburg (1430 – November 25, 1495) in Copenhagen. Dorothea was born in 1430 or 1431 to John, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, and Barbara of Saxe-Wittenberg (1405–1465). She had two sisters: Barbara (1423–1481), who became Marchioness of Mantua, and Elisabeth (14??-1451), who became Duchess of Pomerania. From about the age of eight, she lived in Bayreuth, where her father was ruler. In 1443, Christopher of Bavaria, the newly elected King of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, inherited Oberpfalz close to Bayreuth, and a marriage was suggested between Christopher and Dorothea to secure her father’s support for Christopher’s power over his German domain. The engagement was proclaimed prior to the application of Papal dispensation for affinity in February 1445, which was approved March 10.\n\nChristopher III, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.\n\nOn September 12, 1445, the wedding ceremony was conducted between Christopher and Dorothea in Copenhagen, followed by the coronation of Dorothea as queen. The King had financed it with a special tax in all three Kingdoms, and the occasion is described as one of the most elaborate in Nordic Medieval history. The festivities lasted for eight days and was attended by the Princes of Braunschweig, Hesse and Bavaria and envoys of the Hanseatic League and the Teutonic Order as well as the nobility of Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Dorothea made her entrance in the city escorted by noblemen from all three Kingdoms dressed in gold riding on white horses, and crowned Queen of Denmark, Sweden and Norway by bishops from all three Kingdoms with the golden crown from the Vadstena Abbey.\n\nEric of Pomerania was deposed as king of Denmark and Sweden in 1439. As Eric’s nephew, Christopher, who was rather unfamiliar with Scandinavian conditions, was elected by the Danish State Council as the successor to his uncle, first as regent from 1439, and then proclaimed King of Denmark at the Viborg Assembly (Danish landsting) on April 9, 1440. He was meant to be a puppet king, as evidenced by the saying: “Had the Council demanded the stars of heaven from him, he would have ordered it.”However he succeeded in maintaining some personal control. As a whole his rule, according to the politics of the nobility and his succession, might be called the start of the long period of balance between royal power and nobility which lasted until 1660. He was later elected king of Sweden in 1441, and Norway in June 1442.\n\nIn May 1442 Christopher traveled to Lödöse to meet with the nobles from all three kingdoms. He was elected King of Norway there and then went to Oslo where he was crowned on July 2, 1442. The next year he was proclaimed King of Denmark at the Urnehoved Assembly near Ribe. When his residence at Roskilde burned down, Christopher moved to Copenhagen and made it the capital of Denmark.\n\nThe Swedish nobles were not happy to relinquish any power and thus didn’t like him, claiming he was too German for them and that he allowed his uncle (ex-King Eric) to plunder shipping from his castle on Gotland without any attempt to stop him. They blamed a series of bad harvests on him. People were so hungry they mixed ground tree bark with the little flour they could find. Christopher was contemptuously nicknamed the “Bark King” in Sweden. On the other hand, he tried to support the cities and their merchants as far as the limits of nobility and Hanseatic cities allowed. During his reign Copenhagen was made permanently the capital of Denmark (municipal charter of 1443).\n\nHe carried on an ineffective policy of war and negotiations against Eric in Gotland which did little to help the dissatisfaction within both Sweden and the Hanseatic League. The Kalmar Union Treaty was changed so that the aristocracy had most of the policy-making powers, and the king lost many of the powers monarchs had acquired since Viking times. The results of this policy of balance were still not reached when he suddenly died as the last descendant of Waldemar IV of Denmark."
