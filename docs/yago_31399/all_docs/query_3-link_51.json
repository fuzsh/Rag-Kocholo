In earlier years we owed a debt to my uncle,Doctor Oluf Müller of Odense,Denmark forgiving us what we know of ‘The Family Tree’. These later years, since I have been in touch with the German branch ofthe family Sponeck so much more has come to hand, much of which was obviously alarge source of my dear uncle Oluf Müller’s information. All this information (much of it in German andDanish) needed to be translated, correlated and recorded and then broughttogether to give you and following generations a history of your family, whichwould be readable, interesting and accurate.\n\nSome have asked: “Why a book on the SPON(N)ECK family?” Today, as never before, the quest forinformation on ancestry and the study of genealogy has become quite thevogue. The number of books on differentfamily histories is astonishing and I have examined many in my research andpreparation for this work. There is nodoubt that genealogy is a science today because of the vast research that goesinto it. The resource material that hasopened up, even in the past few years to genealogists is awe-inspiring as isthe number of people working to make this information available. The INTERNET too has helped in makinginformation available and if you would care to go into it, you would findSPONNECK and SPONECK listed also in Professor Stoyan’s WWPerson Website. The information is not up to date and it ismy intention to supply this updated material in the near future by way of ourown Family Tree Programme. For theSPONECK / SPONNECK family however, not too much research has had to be donebecause we have the privilege of having five hundred years of history recordedfor us in the German ‘Gotha’ and the ‘Danmarks Adels Aarbog’ andother historical documents listed in the bibliography section at the back ofthis book. These books record thearistocracy and nobility of those two countries. In the latter years, Oluf Müller, during hislifetime, did this for us of the Danish line. The German line has also been updating their families in the German ‘Gotha’. The resources I have at hand are written inGerman and Danish as can be expected. Iam pleased to say I have mastered the German language enough so as to be ableto unravel the secrets that they have kept hidden from us. The Danish history too has been hidden fromthe Danish line because of our Anglicisation. My thanks will be expressed in the acknowledgements of this book to allthe wonderful people to whom a debt of gratitude is owed for so muchinformation which otherwise would have been lost to us (the English speakingclan) forever.\n\nI am of the opinion that a book on the SPONNECK / SPONECKfamily is important because we have a story to tell. As can be expected in every family we havehad our saints and our villains, and the only reason, why not to write a bookwould be to try and hide the truth! However, a good book will tell both the good and the bad and in that wefind the message. I have endeavoured totell the story as it is and as it has been documented with a list of my sourcematerial also available in the back of the book for inspection. Accuracy has been an important factor and Ihave endeavoured to be so, as far as humanly possible.\n\nHistory – the story of man – the source of the HumanSciences starts in the family. Interwoven in the fabric of human existence is the story offamilies. The secret of the very reasonand purpose for life lies in the family – the very existence and continuance ofmankind rests in the family way of life. May the concept of ‘family’ never be removed from the earth for in thisnucleus lie all the reasons for Human Science and indeed all of creation. The SPON(N)ECK family has in a small way alsohad a part in this greater story. Hereyou will read of those of us who played a part in great historical events andbattles and who lived through some of the most exciting or trying times ofhuman history. If you enjoy history I amsure you will enjoy this work. Historyalso has to do with culture and heritage. To know ones history is to know from where you have come and thus toknow where you will be going. Yourheritage is your privilege and upon this you can build, in your turn, for thefuture, adding to the SPONNECK / SPONECK saga. Maybe even you have given the family names to your children, as has beendone through the ages, thus reaffirming the importance of your culture andheritage. You may do so with pride becausethe SPON(N)ECK FAMILY have made their footprints and left their marks in thesands of time and in the course of human history. Both the family lines have produced theirheroes, more of which you will read within these pages. The villains we will excuse because they arealso of human origin and while it is human to err, it is Divine toforgive! As we wish to imitate theDivine we too will forgive and forget the error of their ways but also rememberthem as having played their part in this family SAGA.\n\nTo find someone worthy of the dedication of this book wasnot difficult for me. While there havecertainly been others, it is with great pride and joy that I have long felt thededication would be to our hero, Lieutenant General Hans Emil Otto von Sponeckof the German line. It is with muchexcitement and a real thrill that I relate something of this man’s story withinthe pages of this book. If you readnothing else in this book – you are advised to read the chapter on hiscontribution and dedication and supreme sacrifice during those trying timesbetween the years 1940 -1944.\n\nThe choice of the title for this book came to me with somedifficulty. Firstly, because of the twomethods of spelling the name and because of the difficulty of using both forms,I decided to give preference to the use of the double ‘n’ name. My logic was the fact that the Danish line isthe senior line of the family. Alsobecause they are today the larger family of the two lines and lastly becausethe form ‘Sponneck’ is also historically correct as shown in the 1701 / 1702 Vienna documents. Secondly, because of the possible Germanmisunderstanding of the term ‘Saga’! While the alliteration and the English meaning lent itself perfectly tothe title of the book, the German meaning might imply something completely tothe contrary. I need therefore to givethe Oxford Dictionary definition of the English word – ‘saga’. It states the meaning as: “…story of heroic achievement or adventure;series of connected books (chapters) giving the history of a family etc” andthus I trust it will justify its name.\n\nSo for all of you SPON(N)ECK families and the twenty-twoboys and girls out there of the younger generation from both lines, that thiswork will encourage you all, is my sincere hope and trust and inspire you allto greater efforts and higher heights of achievements and goals, as you recallyour family history, for the continued benefit and interest of futuregenerations of SPONECK / SPONNECK and also for all humanity.\n\nGodfrey Sponneck – Author - March 2002\n\nFOREWORD\n\nHerbert Stoyan\n\nProfessor of Computer Science\n\nErlangenUniversity\n\nThis book is the result of long and active research in the sources anddevelopment of one of the noble families of ‘counts’ of the HolyRoman Empire. The familywas born as offspring of a duke, a pretty woman and her brothers’ whosedescendants took government and military services and spread over Europe and a good many of them, over the world. Thefamily was the cradle for pretty women, well-informed organisers and courageousmilitary men.\n\nTheresearch of the development of a family constitutes history of society, as thefamily is the basic cornerstone of our society. We can find in family the results of decisions, which influenced their times. This way, the hobbyist family historiancontributes to the science of genealogy, like the many eager researchers in thearchives and libraries.\n\nI hope the reader will find the worth of afamily tradition and that he may understand himself to be a living replicationof his predecessors. This may be acomforting thought in the difficult\n\nsituations of life.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nTo begin evento think of all the people to whom I owe such a debt of gratitude is difficult. I received so much assistance and help forthe completion of this work. There werejust so many, but I shall however attempt to do so here. I hope that at the final print I would nothave left anyone out who has helped to make this work possible. Through their kind assistance in so manydifferent ways they have helped to bring this book about.\n\nWithout a doubt, I would here wish to start with thememory of our first genealogist and the one who first inspired my interest inour history in the person of Doctor Oluf Müller of Odense, Denmark. It was Uncle Oluf who in my earliest years in1947 had sent to my family a copy of the ‘Danmarks Adels Aarbog’. Along with this he sent pictures of ourforefathers, to be seen in the website, and of the beautiful Sponeck / Sponneck‘Coat-of-Arms’. Also a little Danishdesk flag accompanied it all. I stillproudly fly it over the ‘Arms’ today, although somewhat old and faded now. From him we also came into a carefully typedout genealogy tree and a very brief history of our ancestors, just enough towet the appetite that has resulted in this work today. If only he had lived to see the fantasticmeans in order to study genealogy and the programmes available on the WorldWide Web today, I think he would have been very happy. It was my pleasure much later to meet UncleOluf on the occasion of a brief visit to South Africa and to have him stayin our home for a few days. He was areal gentleman and also the husband of my father’s only sister, AliceMathilde. I honour the memory of himtoday with the publication of this book.\n\nIt was in meeting Ottmar Sponeck through my very firstapproach letter to the German side of the family that I was to come upon a realtreasure. In wondering what he couldgive me for a present on the occasion of my first visit, it came to him to letme have a copy of the little red book called ‘Sponeck’ that was to really setme on the path of our family history. This little book, written in old Gothic German, was to inspire me withits total history of the Burg Sponeck and our relationship to it. I had been learning to read and speak Germanfor a short while, but this text really challenged me because of its contentand I have been told that my translation of it to English is nothing short of awonder for me to have done it! You findthis all in the chapter on the Castle Sponeck. To Ottmar Sponeck then also I express my heartfelt gratitude for hisgenerosity and so much kind assistance with papers, clippings and photographsthat have all helped me to piece the story together. Through Ottmar I met the rest of the Germanfamily and to them all also a word of thanks and appreciation. To Hans-Christof for the gift of preciouspictures and information so liberally shared. To Hans-Henning for his willingness to obtain documents and informationat his own expense from the Austrian Archives and for the memoirs of his father– Lieutenant General Theo Sponeck, which helped me so much with the chapter onhis life and times, I must say a big thank you. To Dieter and Margarete von Bezold, the sister and brother-in-law ofHans-Henning, I wish to express a special word of thanks. These folk were invaluable to me in thedocuments, pictures and papers they shared so willingly. Dieter spent hours in the Munich Librarysearching for information. It wasthrough these historical documents that we have the foundations of our chapteron the Württemberg family. Words willnever be able to express my gratitude.\n\nFrom my side of the family I would like to start with mycousin Niels Müller and here express my thanks and praise to him for alsounstintingly helping me with pictures, illustrations and translations fromDanish to English. Also, the familyheirlooms he gave away to me including an early photograph of our great-greatgrandparents taken in about 1850 and framed by his father, Doctor Oluf Müllermany years ago. Your generosity isdeeply appreciated Cousin Niels! Then mycousin, John William Sponneck is also owed a debt of gratitude for hisgenerosity and understanding in my support. He also assisted me greatly with the Danish translations and the use ofhis Danish dictionary without which I would have been at a total loss. My brother-in-law and sister, Pastor Peterand Lynette Grage are greatly appreciated today for their love andencouragement in what I was doing. Itwas to Peter whom the documents from Vienna Archives finally arrived and thathave helped us to solve some of the mysteries of our history. The old Gothic is very hard to understand,but Peter contacted a Mrs. Ehlert of the Lutheran Church Archives, Neustadt, Germanywho worked through these documents of 1701/02 transcribing them intounderstandable German and today we have a clearer understanding of who we are,which will be revealed in this book. Avery special word of thanks is owed to Mrs. Ehlert, who did this transcribingfor us refusing any remuneration. Then Iwish to thank Peter also for the hours spent in libraries and in the one in Bremen getting the bookson General Hans, which greatly helped and indeed without which that chapterwould not have been able to be included in this work. I also owe to him the thanks for the book onthe Village of Jechtingen.\n\nTo my personal friend, Henry Gates, who knowing of myinterest in family tree matters gave me an early version of Family Tree Makerand so introduced me to this programme. I shall be forever grateful to him. Then to my own daughter, Beverley Shannon, who with so much love andexpense was at the right place at the right time to organise the latest FamilyTree Programme that helped in the launch of our own family site on theINTERNET. Only she knows how much herobtaining this special programme in the United States, just a few monthsafter its launch there, meant to me. Iam sure I am the first in SouthAfrica with this newer version, my thanks toher! My very special friend, HelgaZander also qualifies for my deep felt thanks and appreciation. Her untiring reading of German text and hoursof ‘deutsche stunde’ (German lessons) to help me get a grasp of the Germanlanguage so much so that I can now read, speak and write somewhat in German hasbeen of immeasurable value to the work. Helga, we all unite in thanking you for being there for me and for yourlove and help offered so unstintingly through the last few years!\n\nI will never be able to thank my good friend, DrEngelhardt Bühler of Burg Sponeck enough, for his enthusiastic and costlyassistance. His contribution of thevolume on the total history of the Württemberg family and later, the volume on‘Jechtingen am Kaiserstuhl’ and all the pictures and copies of paintings of theBurg Sponeck have greatly enhanced this work. Also to my INTERNET genealogy buddies to whom I owe one great debt of gratitudefor all the help on research that was done on my behalf. To Cousin Niels Høyvald in particular withthe help on the understanding of my grandfather’s early history I wish to say abig thank you! Also Professor Stoyan whoalways came back to me whenever I had a question or query on the nobles of Europe. Thank youProfessor Stoyan for your kind assistance! The developers of Family Tree Maker also need a word of thanks for theirproduct which features heavily in this book and through whom our WEBPAGE isdone. This is a very professional toolindeed. To the Genealogical Societymembers of Port ElizabethI also need to say thank you because there I was able to piece together how Iwas going to go about this work. They were all so helpful and the approach togenealogy I learned with them was to stand me in very good stead for this book.\n\nThen lastly, to my mother, Winnie, or Winifred néeSpencer, who I could always go to with new discoveries and discuss new lengthyfamily revelations without her getting bored or tired of me, I owe a deep senseof gratitude. She was so helpful inproof reading the text and helping with the grammar as well as being the onethat I could openly discuss all the content with for hours without tiring ofit. Her love and dedication to my causeis acknowledged here.\n\nWhen I think about it, it all seemed to have come togetherso fantastically and marvellously that I must also thank my God and Saviour forHis guidance, inspiration and help in no small way, as the timing of everythingwas so perfect. I would feel it impossibleto have to say that there was no higher hand in the matter. I thank you, my Lord Jesus Christ for theprivilege of doing this work and I trust that it will challenge and touch thehearts of the readers with regard to the health and wealth of their bodies andsouls! It has been a privilege and apleasure to serve Him and the family in the time and effort spent in thecompilation of this family history.\n\nThe Author\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE NAME\n\nWhenever onestarts out on a quest for the origin and meaning of a family name, one startsout on a long journey into history filled with intrigue and sometimes suspense,but always with the reward of learning something of ones ancestors! So much can be learned from the etymology ofa name. Indeed there is nothing asimportant to any individual as the sound of his, or her, own name and muchmore, the discovery of the origin of that name and the meaning of the name forones self-esteem. In the search for theorigins and meanings of surnames or family names some very interesting factscome to light.\n\nThe use of family names came into being in different partsof the world at widely different time spans. The Far East, for example, was thefirst part of the world to record the use of surnames when a Chinese emperordecreed the adoption of hereditary family names in 2852 B.C. In Englandit was a gradual process beginning about 1000 A.D. and in most of Europe about the 13th century. Other nations like the Turks and the Jewsstarted using family names as late as the 20th century when theybecame obliged to do so by their governments or the governments of thecountries in which they resided.\n\nFamily names were ascribed by some very interesting andingenious ideas. People who had verypertinent occupations became known by that occupation such as the Smiths,Schmidts or Smits of which there were very many different types like farrierswho shoe horses or ironsmiths. Anothersuch name would be the ‘Taylor’family who were involved in clothe making. Of course the name ‘Butler’would also have a significant meaning for the head of the family’soccupation. Still other names identifieda particular person from their relationship with another person, usually thefather, such as ‘Johnson’ and ‘Mac Donald’. ‘Jensen’ would be the Scandinavian form of ‘son of Jens’. We then have those folk who became calledafter their residential area or town of origin. Speyers denote the family from the town of Speyerin North West Germany. The Yorkfamily also illustrates this as do the Attwood family (living at thewoods). The Gates family could well havebeen those living at the city gates or could have been the citygatekeepers. Further names were derivedfrom a person’s appearance such as ‘Brown’, ‘Little’ and ‘Grossmann’ denoting abig man in the German language. Thesurname of Blake too was originally an epithet – le Blac i.e.‘Black’. Exploits were also a source fora name such as ‘Armstrong’ and ‘Knight’!\n\nThe name SPONECK, which was the first variation, was not infact a family name or the surname of the particular family until very muchlater in the name’s history. Thisprivilege was also not the sole right of the present family. We shall however deal with this in a laterchapter. Most people cannot place the namewith any country such as Englandor Germanybecause of the uniqueness of this family name.\n\nFor the origins of the name SPONECK one would have to goback many centuries to the south western side of Germanyto the Rhine and to what is now the border between Franceand Germany. Somewhere between Heidelbergand Freiburg in the area called ‘Kaiserstuhl is the little town of Jechtingen. Right here at this spot at a curve in theRiver Rhine stood a very prominent and strategic hillock. What made the hill of such importance was thefact that it was the only elevated section in this stretch of the RhineRiverfor kilometres in the directions, north and south, giving a commanding view ofthe Rhine and surrounding area. Across the river in what is now part of France lays the much-disputed province called Alsace. From earliest times this hillock played avery important roll in the power struggles of the day. Many years before Christ there are signs thata developed civilisation was in existence here. During the Roman times when the Legions of Rome were spreading theiriron tentacles over so much of Europe, they found this hill so important forthe command of the Rhine and its crossing, tohave built a fortress there. Archaeological signs also point to a very important roadway from southto north crossing right over this hill. This linked in with the Rhine crossing at this point and he who hadcommand of the ‘hill’ had command of this important Rhinecrossing as well. A crossing exists fromthe town of Sasbach while a main crossing into France is alittle south of the hilltop at the town called Breisach. Little of the history of this originalfortress is known but as recently as 1979 the foundations and stone ruins ofthe wall of the Roman castle were uncovered and can be seen today at the Burgsite.\n\nIn the 13th century we know that the history ofthis hill continued with the building of a second fortress or castle on thishill by the German princes. This secondcastle was at first unnamed. In thearchives of the City of Freiburg dated 23rdOctober 1281 there is a document, which states that King Rudolph von Habsburgand the counts and burgers of Freiburg hadbeen in conflict. In this conflict theCastle Zähringen, near Freiburg had beendestroyed. This parchment was a ‘peacetreaty’ between King Rudolph von Habsburg and Count Egino von Freiburg. In it the counts of Freiburgand their burgers undertook to rebuild the Reichsburg Zähringen and topay the sum of ‘Eight Hundred Marc’ as expiation for damages causedduring the fray. It was also agreed thatin recompense, another castle would be build by the Counts von Freiburg and theburgers at a position chosen by King Rudolph. King Rudolph had chosen the raised hill site in the region ofJechtingen, near to the Rhine, for his new‘Burg’. In 1285 this promised castle wascompleted and its first occupant or Lehensträger is given in an entry inthe historical Breisach town records dated 26th January 1300 as KnightHildebrand Spenli, who was mayor or ruler of Breisach. As such he would also have been an importantofficial of the Emperor over an imperial town and possessions. When the castle was completed at the end ofthe 13th century we read in the minutes of the town council ofBreisach, in the same record dated 26th January 1300, that theruler, who was the Knight Hildebrand Spenli, took the name ‘von Spanecke’ whichname he had also given to the castle. Eckeis the German word for ‘corner’ thus it would denote Spenli’s Ecke orSpenli’s corner! The very first formthen of the name was SPANECKE from the BURG SPANECKE.\n\nTwo other variations of the origin of the castle’s namewere that Spenli had used the prefix SPAN from the German word spannungmeaning tension or suspense or Span=eck as in the word for ‘excitement’. This would have then meant ‘corner ofsuspense’! Although this Burg andits history certainly were steeped in intrigue and suspense with contention,not much credit can be given to this theory. The building and establishment of this castle – known as a Reichsburgor ‘Castle of the Empire’ – as had been the old Castle Zähringen, was apossession of the Empire and therefore was the property of the Emperor. This would have given it the highest statusavailable and it has enjoyed this status for most of its six hundred years ofhistory. The other idea was that Spenlicalled it Span=ecke because of the actual elbow or bend in the RiverRhine, just south of the hill on which Burg Spanecke was built. The ‘ecke’ again is denoting a corner. Whichever one it was that inspired this manin the naming of the Burg we will never know but that he did and thatthe name grew out of this is for sure. In the illustration you see the official seal of Spenli with theinscription of his office as Mayor of Breisach.\n\nThat he was the first occupant and ‘caretaker’ naming itproudly after himself is fully recorded in the historical archives. After his death, until 1309, his son, Johannvon Spanegge occupied the Burg. Acornerstone at the south wall of the Burg dated 1933 bears thisinscription. By the 14thcentury in the year 1306 the Burg is still recorded as Spanegge and by1318 it had developed into its present form of REICHSBURG SPONECK.\n\nWhile it is not intended in this chapter to discuss theCastle Sponeck or the history of the Castle Sponeck, it is important to seehere that the name then comes from the early naming of this same fortress. Although it was by no means a large andsplendid edifice, as were some of the other castles along the RhineRiverit was its strategic importance to the German Empire through the centuries thatearned it the privileged title of Reichsburg Sponeck. The importance of this fact is shown in thetitle of Reichsgraf that was later conferred. The meaning of Reichsburg is in effect‘Castle of the Empire’ and thus the title of Reichsgraf –‘Count-of-the-Empire’ was later created using the same name.\n\nThere is a second chapter to the development of the name,which can be dealt with here, and that is the difference of the spelling of thename by the two main branches of the family. As it has been stated, the original form is – SPONECK – from the name ofthe Castle and thus the German family name ‘von Sponeck’. The ‘von’ denotes in English ‘from’ or‘of’. In Denmark the family were given theDanish equivalent of the word ‘von’ denoted by ‘af’. This ‘af’ then also means ‘from’Sponeck. There is also documentation ofa French Branch of the family (later extinct) that went under the French prefix‘de’ as in ‘de Sponeck’ like de Jager and de Jonger! We shall hear more of this French linelater. In the Historical Archives ofVienna, in the documentation of 1701, one finds the forefathers were given thetitle name of ‘Sponeck’ and further in another document dated 1702, verifyingtheir title creation, Georg Wilhelm and his siblings are called ‘von Sponneck’in this Imperial Letter of Introduction to the Bishops of Trier and Mainz. The Danish branch later accepted the use ofthe second ‘n’ making it ‘von Sponneck’ or af Sponneck. Documentation in the German ‘Gotha’ of 1867 would indicate that a Frenchbranch also used the double ‘n’ later as ‘de Sponneck’. The German family seemed to however retainthe single ‘n’ thereafter. This double‘n’ became the popular form of the name by the family of Georg Wilhelm oncethey were settled in Denmark. The family portraits of the Danish line inlate eighteenth century give the surname inscription underneath the paintingsin this form. Doctor Oluf Müller – thefamily genealogist – in his handmade copies of the family tree also gives theDanish ancestors the German title and name with the one letter ‘n’ up to themiddle of the 18th century. Thereafter he switches to the Danish title and spelling of the name inits present form. Of interest also is thefact that he uses the ‘von’ for the Danish branch up to the generation ofSponneck who were incorporated into the Danish aristocracy in the late 19thcentury. Thereafter his draft of thetree drops the ‘von’ for all the descendants of the Danish line in all three oftheir branches. It can thus be assumedthat this was done because of the assimilation of the family with their fullGerman title taken up into the Danish nobility and granted the Danishequivalent title for all their natural descendants. This will be dealt with in the later chapterdealing with the genealogy. It istherefore correct that the German family will continue to use the name VONSPONECK and the Danish family the name as - SPONNECK - that was officiallyrecognised by the Danish King Christian IX at the time of incorporation ofGeorg Wilhelm’s branch of the family into the Danish nobility by this King ofDenmark.\n\nMore recently, we have discovered a small number offamilies in Americawho can show claim through the Mormon archives to being descendant from thesame Georg Wilhelm von Hedwiger through a Norwegian line and spell the name as‘Sponnick’.\n\nHere then is the whole history of the name to its presentforms. Later we will discuss the familyin more detail and how they came into the usage of the Castle’s name as theirfamily name and who else owned the Castle and used its name in their titles.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nTHE CASTLE SPONECK\n\nIn the previouschapter we dealt with the name of SPONECK which as we now know was deriveddirectly from the old fortress built in 1285 on the little hill which was onthe German side of the Rhine overlooking the river just outside of the quaintlittle Dorf or village of Jechtingen. We know that it was a very strategic edifice built at the site where theruins of an original Roman Castle had been discovered and excavated by thepresent owners. It had been quite bychance that these ruins were discovered back in 1979. Little is known of the Roman Castleexcepting that it would have been built about the fourth century in AD360. It can however be assumed that itsage-old value had to do with its elevated topography and its relationship tothe Rhine and the Rhine River Crossing. Today the area is well wooded and covered in beautiful thick greenforest in every direction. One can justsee the River running through the rich green forest below the Burg.\n\nIn this chapter we attempt to tell as much of the Castle’shistory as will be of interest and in the development of the familySPONECK. Because of the duel spelling ofthe name from here on it will always be used in its correct form for theparticular place or family branch that we are referring to at the time ofdiscussion. When both family lines areintended, the name will be given with the second letter ‘n’ in brackets.\n\nAs we have already learned the first family associatedwith the ‘Burg Sponeck’ was that of Hildebrand Spenli. These next pages will take us through thehistory from 1285 to 1930, then up to the present time, and something of theCastle’s present state and owners. Someexplanation might be of benefit here with regard to the words ‘castle’ and‘burg’. In the German language the word Burgdenotes a fortress whereas the word for castle would be Schloß ifmeaning a mansion. In English we use theword ‘castle’ for both large homes called Châteaux and for the oldfortresses used for defence of the realm. Our discourse will from now on take the form of Burg in relatingto the Castle Sponeck.\n\nPerhaps a brief history of Germany may be in order here tohelp you understand better the times and development of the country and itssocial development. Then we will betterunderstand the purpose of Burg Sponeck and the other many castles and theirplace in history. Solid historicalrecords of the German peoples began in about 50 BC when Julius Caesar’s GaelicWars brought him into contact with Germans and Celts. He crossed the Rhine in 55 BC and 58 BC andthe province of Gaul he created used the river as aboundary but most Germans lived well east of it. Direct Roman attacks on German tribes beganagain under Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus who pushed across the Rhine in 12BC and 9 BC while other Roman forces assaulted Germanic tribes through themiddle Danube to the south east. Fierce fighting in both the Rhine and Danubeareas continued until the famous victory of the German ‘Arminius’ in theTeutoburger Forest, which is southeast of modern day Bielefeld in 9 AD. Three Roman Legions were massacred there, whichshowed the Romans that conquering these tribes would require too much cost andeffort on their part. His German namewas ‘Hermann’ – a chief of the Cherusci Tribe. He obtained both citizenship and knightly title in earlier service ofthe Romans. Although he was a greatwarrior and chieftain, winning many great battles against other tribes and theRomans, he died at the age of 37 at the hands of his own people in 19 AD. The Roman frontier thus stabilized on theRhine and DanubeRivers,although sporadic campaigns extended control over Frisia and the coastal beltin the north and some of the lands east of the confluence of the Rhine, which included the site of the Burg. Both archaeology and Caesar’s own accounts ofhis wars show that the German tribes then lived on both sides of the Rhine.\n\nAfter Romehad established its frontiers, commercial and cultural contacts were asimportant as direct conflict. Althoughthe frontier was heavily fortified with many fortresses and castles, thefrontier was never a barrier to trade or to people wishing to cross. In about 50 AD the tribes beside the Rhine learned to use Roman money. Germans also served in the Roman armies. Border raids were endemic between 150 AD and200 AD and whole series of Germanic groups moved south along the rivervalleys. These migrations resulted ingreat violence along the entire frontier during the 3rdcentury. Parts of Gaul suffered greatlyby the intensive campaigns of the Romans, which eventually brought the Germanictribes back under control so that by about 280 AD stability had again returnedto the Rhine region. The Roman army with an alliance systeminvolving Franks, Alemanni (German peoples) and Goths maintained the frontieruntil about 370 AD. It would have beenduring these times in the history of the Rhine that the original Roman Castlewould have been built on the East side of the Rhineat the strategic crossing site. By themiddle of the 5th century while the Roman Empire was withering fromwithin, the Germans, in 405 AD and 406 AD, put increasing pressure on the Rhinefrontier with an insurgence into the west bank side (known now as Alsace)settling or moving through as far as Spain ahead of the marauding ‘Hun’ tribes.As a result of these battles and skirmishes the original Roman Fortress on the‘hill’ was already in ruins before 475 AD. The Western Roman Empire ended in 476AD. After the Roman period the successorstates were a fusion of Germanic military power and the administrative know-howof Roman provincial aristocrats. Thetransformation was complete when Germanic warrior and Roman provincial eliteintermarried, bringing into being a new aristocracy that was to shape medieval Europe. When theWestern Roman Empire ended in 476 BC the Germanic tribes west of the Rhine were not politically united. The West Germanic tribes however spokedialects of a common language and shared social and political tradition. The traditions of these tribes had beeninfluenced by centuries of contact with the Roman world, both as federatedtroops within the empire and as participants in the broader political andeconomic network that extended beyond the Roman frontier. In particular, a strong military structure ofsocial organization under the direction of commanders termed ‘kings’ or ‘dukes’had developed among the federated tribes within the empire and spread to tribesliving outside the empire proper.\n\nThe first king to convert to orthodox Christianity was onecalled ‘Clovis’in about 500 AD. His successor,Theodebert I, brought much of what would later constitute Germany under the Frankish control, includingthe State of Thuringia in CentralGermany and the Alemanni and the Bavarians of the South. He ruled from 534 – 548. In areas under Frankish Lordship,Christianity made considerable progress through the efforts of native Raetians,of wandering Irish missionaries and of transplanted Frankish aristocrats whosupported monastic foundations. TheCarolingians ruled the Kingdom from the 730’s. The Carolingians, by the end of the 7th century were the clanthat finally succeeded in destroying the Merovingian Frankish rule. They were one of a number of powerfulcompeting aristocratic clans fighting for autonomy and hoping to establishhegemony over the Frankish realm. TheCarolingians drew their strength from extensive estates and loyal aristocraticsupporters in the lands between the Meuse and the Rhine. They did not however acquire the royal titleuntil the year 751. The pattern ofFrankish penetration east of the Rhine was toestablish small communities or churches, settled on land newly won from therich thick forests and marshes granted them by their Carolingianprotectors. Thus, from Frisia in thenorth to Bavariain the south, religious, economic and political penetration always went hand inhand.\n\nThe rule of Charlemagne was also one of expansion into theheart of Germany first southinto Bavariathen north into the Saxon territories. Charlemagne’s expeditions bit deep into the heart of Saxonyleaving behind bitter memories of forced conversions, deportations and massacres. His raids were inspired by religious as wellas political zeal and motives. Charlemagne tried to break Saxon resistance both to Christianity and hisFrankish rule with fire and sword. Thedecentralized nature of Saxon society however made ultimate conquest extremelydifficult. Whenever the Frankish armywas occupied elsewhere, the Saxons could be counted on to revolt, to slaughterFrankish officials and priests and to raid as far west as they could. Charlemagne in turn would punish the offendingtribes and garrison the defence points the Saxons had abandoned. Eventually the resistance gave way and loyalFrankish churchmen and aristocrats were introduced into the regions to secureand pacify them. Although the northernmost regions enjoyed Danish support and remained outside of Frankish control,most of Saxony gradually moved into the unitedFrankish realm. During the 9thcentury under ‘Louis the German’ (ruled 804 – 876) the close kinship andrivalries of the descendants of Charlemagne still united east and west Francia,however the eastern region was taking on the identity of Germany and the westwas merging as France. Because theCarolingians themselves were unable to provide effective defence for the wholekingdom, military command and the political and economic power necessary tosupport it necessarily devolved on local leaders whose regions wereattacked. The inevitable result was thedecentralization and decay of royal authority to the profit of the regionaldukes. These dukes were not appointed bythe people nor were they descendants of the tribal chieftains of the pastmigration period. Their dukes wereCarolingian counts, part of the international ‘imperial aristocracy’ of theCarolingians who took the initiative in organizing defence on a localbasis. Their initial success establishedthem in the hearts of those whom they protected. The transformation of the ‘imperialaristocracy’ to a local elite was accompanied by an increasingly dynasticaloriented aristocratic society that was bound together through ties of vassalageand exercised personal lordship over the free and half-free populations of theregion. Under the patronage of ‘Louisthe German’ the Gospels were translated into Germanic dialects and the firstattempts at writing Germanic poetry with Christian and traditional themes wereundertaken.\n\nThe next ruler was ‘Louis the Child’ (911 – 918 AD). He died without leaving a male heir. He was crowned as Conrad I, and he was quiteunequal to the situation in Germany. The first two Salian kings- Conrad II (1024 –1039) and Henry III (1039 – 1056) bestowed vacant duchies quite freely on theirown kin and on men from outside the boundaries. They competed against ducal power but could neither abolish nor replaceit. In the 11th century, asbefore, the dukes held assemblies of their folk, led the tribal host in war,and enforced peace. The counts, who werethe ordinary officers of justice in serious criminal cases, obeyed the ducalsummons but for the most part they received their power to capital punishmentfrom the king himself. In the time ofOtto III (983 – 1002) there rose another order of ‘aristocrat’ called ‘advocates’ or Vögte who could pass judgementsof blood on the behalf of the bishop. Inthe 10th and 11th centuries these advocates had to berecruited from the aristocracy. Thusthere arose powerful lines of margraves, counts and hereditary advocates whoenriched themselves at the expense of the church and the crown and in competitionwith one another. From the abler morefortunate and long-lived races among these dynasts sprang the territorialprinces of the late 12th and 13th centuries absorbing andfinally inheriting most of the rights of government. The king was the personal overlord of all thegreat nobles. His court was the seat ofgovernment and it went with him on his long journeys. The German kings even more than othermedieval rulers could only make their authority respected in far-flung regionsof the kingdom by travelling ceaselessly from duchy to duchy, which were ruledby the dukes, and from frontier to frontier. Hence they would have these castles scattered over their kingdom wherethey would stay and wherever they stayed their jurisdiction superseded the standingpower of the dukes, counts and advocates. They could collect the profits of local justice (fines) and wield somecontrol over it. As they came into eachregion they summonsed its leaders to attend their solemn crown wearingceremonies, deliberated with them on the affairs of the State and the locality,presided over pleas, granted privileges and made war against peace breakers athome and abroad. The royal revenues camefrom the king’s demesne land and from his share of the tributes of foreign tribeswhenever he could enforce his claim of overlordship on them. There were also profits from tolls and mints(some provinces minted their own gold money). The Demesnes were the kings working ‘capital’ and theking and his household lived on its produce during their wanderings through theKingdom and it also served to provide for the king’s family, to found churchesand to reward faithful service done for him, especially in war. This later extended to the Emperor with his Reichsburgenand kingdoms subservient to him.\n\nIt is noteworthy that in the 11th century theposition of the bishops and abbots was the conducting of the affairs of theReich much more than the counts and lower aristocracy, even in war. They were the habitual diplomats andambassadors of the king in foreign matters. The king appointed most of them and to him alone they owed allegiance.\n\nWe now come to the second stage of the history of the‘Burg’ site. In the first stage wediscussed the development and then decline of the Roman fortress during thefirst half of the first century some 500 years after Christ. This next stage is set between 1070 and1250. Some time round the year 1070fortresses had been built. They hadbelonged to the German King, Henry IV, and were known as a Reichsburgen. This German king having come of age since hiscoronation as king at the age of six in 1056 now used petty south German noblesand his ministeriales to recover some of the crown lands and rightswhich the princes and certain prelates of the church had acquired during hisminority. We shall hear more of these ministerialeslater. In the year 1073 a revolt brokeout against Henry IV by the Saxon nobles who had to bear the brunt of thestatute labour in the building of the royal strongholds and castles against theKing’s Frankish and Swabian officials. To overcome this startling revolt and save his fortresses the kingneeded the military strength of the South German Princes. Rudolph of Rheinfelden, Duke of Swabia, WelfIV being Duke Welf I of Bavaria and one, Berthold of Zähringen being Berthold I– Duke of Carinthia were called upon to assist. Their forces enabled King Henry to defeat the Saxon rebellion in June 1075. King Henry had then presented a Burg nearFreiburg to Berthold for his assistance inthis conflict. We have recorded then theowner of a Reichsburg in the person of the Duke of Carinthia who namedthe Castle after himself – Berthold von Zähringen. The Dukes of Zähringen were a dynastic familyin Switzerlandbetween the 11th and 13th centuries. They founded the City of Bern and today the Zähringen fountain in thecity centre bears their name. Thebeautiful Castle of Zähringen-Kyburg in the town of Thunon the AareRiver is today a museum. The tower dates back to 1191 and the livingquarters were built during 1429. TheZähringen dynasty became extinct in 1218. Many European ennobled families have been awarded castle names as partof their titles through the centuries. Some of these higher noble families owned their own castles whilstothers of the lower ranks of nobility managed the estates and castles of theirrulers. We shall deal with this subjectmore fully later. Berthold died in 1078and had been married twice with heirs from both spouses. The offspring of the first marriage were allnamed Berthold, being Berthold I up to the V. From the second spouse his heirs were called Hermann I to HermannIV. From the first line we have thedevelopment of the Markgrafen von Hachberg. The second line developed into the Markgrafenvon Baden. A Markgraf wasindeed a greater count and his title denoted that he had his state on the Reichborder and his function was to enlarge or increase this state beyond theborders thus forcing the increase of the realm. He was the buffer between the realm and the neighbouring states and hewas to make conquests of land by agitation and seduction.\n\nKing Henry’s son, Frederick II secured the crown in1215. His demesne was in Swabia,Franconia and Alsace and on the middle Rhine and was very considerable, including the ReichsburgZähringen. During his reign he was ableto recover certain fiefs and advocacies that had been lost during earlier civilwars. Their administration was greatlyimproved and they provided valuable forces for his southern campaigns. He died in 1250. His two sons, Conrad IV and William ofHolland then ruled jointly. HoweverConrad left to fight for his father’s interests in Italy and so left William to ruleuntil 1256. Conrad died in 1254, nodoubt during his Italian Campaign. William of Holland also died in 1256 at the hands of the Friesiansfighting for his Dutch interests in the north.\n\nWe now look at the rise of the Ministeriales. This matter deserves our attention due to thefact that the first occupant and nobleman to occupy the new ‘Burg’ atJechtingen was of this rank and title. The position of a Knight or Ministeriale came into the uniqueposition in Germanyas a result of the fragmentation of the country between the dukes and princesafter the death of Frederick II in 1250. Every prince ruled over his own province or principality and territorywith rights and privileges in governing. Some of these privileges were the right to take tolls, taxes and evenoperate their own mints in order to issue money. Their obligation to the king was to forwardsome of the revenues and also give obligatory service to the king with theirsubjects when called upon by him to do so in order to wage war. The princes however often proved less thanco-operative so the king turned more often to these knights forallegiance. These knights had firstbecome important administrators and soldiers on the estates of the Church earlyin the 11th century. Theirstatus was fixed by Seigniorial ordinances and the king could rely onthem. These ministeriales wereused to administer the king’s direct demesne (private property) as householdofficers at court and as garrisons for their castles. They formed a small army that the king couldmobilize without having to appeal to the princes for support. By the Thirteenth Century the ministerialeshad ceased to be the dependable servants that they once had been. Many freenobles voluntarily joined their ranks and the knights thus assimilated therights of the free aristocracy. Theybecame the governing class of the territorial principalities and the standingcouncillors of their masters whose household offices and local justice theymonopolized and held in See (under orders of the Pope) for manygenerations. Without the consent of thisterritorial nobility the princes could not even tax or legislate.\n\nEven the less important knights whom only administeredmanors for their lords entrenched themselves as hereditary bailiffs who keptsurplus produce for themselves and usurped seigniorial dues so that it paid theowners to commute the labour services of their villains (menial serfs) intomoney rents and so to lease out those portions of the demesne that the unfreepeasants had cultivated for them. Bythis time these hereditary officials could not easily be dislodged. By 1250 there was no really effective centralauthority left in Germanyunder the Hohenstaufen Emperor. TheHohenstaufen breakdown after 1250 left a gap in Swabia(province of the ‘Burg’) that no rising territorial power was able tofill. Countless petty lords and imperialknights or ministeriales of the southwest succeeded in holding theirseigniories as immediate vassals of the Reich directly under the emperor. There independent territories often survivedfor centuries. This then gives us someinsight to the Knight Hildebrand Spenli and as to what he was and why heheld Burg Sponeck and the Sponeck Estate for the king. Remember that any place or property, beingcastle or county that was called a ReichsCastle or ReichsCountywas the direct property of the emperor and thus an imperial possession. Such were the Reichsburg Zähringen and thenewly constructed Reichsburg, which became the Reichsburg Sponeck. And so we see Knight Spenli as more thanlikely one of these ministeriales of the newly appointed King Rudolph ofHabsburg.\n\nOur study of the history of Germany now brings us to the timeof the beginning of the saga of the Reichsburg Sponeck. In Germany, the death of Frederick IIin 1250 ushered in the period known as the ‘Great Interregnum’ being from 1250– 1273. This was a period of internalconfusion and political disorder. Theecclesiastical princes at the behest of the Pope elected Count William of Holland, the son ofFrederick II as king. William’s titlewas recognised initially only in the lower Rhineland, but his marriage toElizabeth of Brunswick in 1252 ensured his acceptance by the interrelatedprincely dynasties of north Germany. The death of his brother, Conrad IV leftWilliam without arrival in Germany. He however devoted himself to his dynasticpolicies in the north pursuing a feud with Margaret, Countess of Flanders overtheir conflicting territorial claims in Zeeland at the mouth of the Rhine. Hisattempts to obtain complete mastery of the Zuider-Zee by thrusting eastwards atthe expense of the Friesland led to his deathby the hands of the same Friesians in 1256. At the death of William, Pope Alexander IV forbade the election of aHohenstaufen king. The initiative wastaken by a small group of influential German princes acting out ofself-interest to approach a foreign monarch. None of the princes desired the election of a ruler who was powerfulenough to threaten their growing independence as territorial princes nor didthey single out a German candidate who might prove to be as uncontrollable asWilliam. Archbishop Conrad of Cologne approached Richard, Earl of Cornwall, brother ofHenry III of England. Richard’s gifts and assurances of futurefavour bought him the vote of the Archbishops of Cologne and Mainz,the Count Palatine of the Rhine and Otakar II of Bohemia. He was formally elected in 1257 and crowned at Aachen, the traditional place of the crowningof German kings and emperors. Richardhowever paid four fleeting visits to Germanyfrom Englandbecause of the turbulence of the aristocracy in his own country. Richard died in 1272. This gave rise to the coming of the Habsburgfamily to the throne. When Richard diedin 1272, the electorial princes were spurred into action by the Pope Gregory X,who desired the election of a German monarch sympathetic towards a crusade forthe recovery of the Holy Land. The princes, dreading an overly powerful kingchose Rudolph of Habsburg in 1273. Rudolph was a minor count of Swabia wholacked the strength to regain the crown domains the electors had stolen from himduring the Interregnum. The ReichsburgZähringen must also have been part of one of these domains, which he would haveinherited from his forefathers, the Dukes of Zähringen, and in particularBerthold von Zähringen of whom we heard earlier and who had died in 1078.\n\nWe shall now consider the direct history of the Burgthrough the centuries and following the years of occurrence. The first year of note then was:-\n\n1250 1250 In the struggle of Rudolph von Habsburg with the Counts of Freiburgduring the Interregnum, and one, Egino von Freiburg in particular, CountRudolph possibly lost the Burg Zähringen.\n\n1273 1273 King Rudolph’s election to the throne in 1273 put him in a very strongposition to regain his lost possessions and to acquire others. In the struggles that ensued Graf Egino vonFreiburg who was still also not on good terms with the King, and the citizensof Freiburg attacked and destroyed the Reichsburg Zähringen, above Freiburg.\n\n1278 1278 King Rudolph soonbesieged Freiburg and conquered the City. One of the conditions of peace was that theGraf Egino and the Counts of Freiburg pay him an expiation fee of 800 SilverMark and the rebuilding of his destroyed Castle Zähringen together with theconstruction of a new castle(Burg Sponeck) on a site designated by King Rudolph. The other condition was that all the labourshould be done by the burgers of Freiburg. This treaty was dated 1278 although theconstruction on the new castle was not begun until 1281 and completed in 1285thus taking about five years to complete.\n\nThe election of Rudolph von Habsburg as king began one ofthe greatest sovereign dynasties of European history. The House of Habsburg, also know as the Houseof Austria, was to rule the Holy Roman Empire for the next six hundred years. The name ‘Habsburg’ is derived from theCastle of Habsburg or Habichtsburg (Hawks Castle) built in 1020 byWerner who was the bishop of Strasbourg and his brother-in-law, Count Radbot(of whom it is claimed was an ancestor of Rudolph I) in the Aargau over-lookingthe Aar River in what is now Switzerland. In 1282 King Rudolph I Habsburg bestowed Austriaand Styria on his two sons – Albert, the future King Albert I and Rudolph II ofAustria. With this date the age-long romance of theHabsburgs with Austriahad its beginning and the Habsburg tie-up with the ‘Burg’ and its people. Rudolph I had acquired these provinces byhaving allied himself with the Bavarian Princely House of Wittelbach and othersagainst his rival for their rulership – Otakar – who was defeated and slain in1278. The Duchies of Austria and Styria,which were overrun by Otakar also during the Interregnum, were declared vacantand conferred jointly on Rudolph’s sons. These acquisitions placed the Habsburg family in the first rank of theGerman territorial princes and lent impetus to a gradual shift in the politicalcentre of gravity from the Rhineland to Austriain the east of Germany. Rudolph died in 1291. A larger than life stone statue of him standsin the Cathedral of Ulm along with other early rulers.\n\nThus far we have traced some of the history of Germany fromearliest times so as to set the stage for what now constitutes the real historyof ‘Burg Sponeck’. We shall nowmove away from the fascinating history of Germany and apply ourselves fromhere on with the saga of the Burg through until modern times.\n\n1281 1281 On the 23rd October 1281 the parchment records tell of thesigning of the Peace Treaty between Rudolph von Habsburg and Count Egino vonFreiburg and in that year the rebuilding of the Reichsburg Zähringen and thenew ‘Burg’ commenced.\n\n1285 1285 As we have already discussed, the new little Reichsburg was dulycompleted in 1285 and handed over to Rudolph I. He, of course had no plan to live in thecastle. Burg Zähringen was his byinheritance, it had been lost to him during the Great Interregnum and now, by achange of fortune, had again been acquired with so much other on his electionto Emperor. It can well be assumed thatthe Knight Hildebrand Spenli was also one of the ministerialesand he was recorded as an important official of the emperor in the town of Breisach. He had been in some way of service to RudolphI and as a reward was now given the new Reichsburg and Gut, orEstate, that went with it to hold as its first Lehensträger (leaseholder) which he was to manage on behalf of its owner. As such, he would haveto generate his income as administrator of the Estate’s wine-lands and fishingrights. Also, the all-importantferry-crossing revenues would fall to him and out of his profits he would haveto pay his dues to the emperor’s treasury. Hildebrand Spenli’s licence to name the new castle gives us an indication of theliberty he had with it in that it was stated in the contract to the emperor’sdemesne that he could hold it and he was free “to do with it as hepleases”. The Knight Spenli thus namesthe new castle‘Reichsburg Spanecke’ and he also calls himself Hildebrand von Spanecke!We find recorded in the ‘General Archives of Karlsruhe’ dated 26thMay 1287 that the gut was expected to deliver a quantity of finest winesto the taverns. No doubt the castle wasan ample reward to Spenli from Rudolph I for some military service, which hewould have performed but unfortunately we are not told about it in thehistorical documents.\n\n1300 1300 On the 26th January 1300 in an entry in the Breisach townrecords it is stated that the Knight Hildebrand Spenli was the occupant andcaretaker of the Burg called Burg Spanecke. Now we can understand throughthis history what it meant to him as far as his personal status was concernedto be able to call himself after the castle he held for the king. Shortly after1300 Hildebrand Spenli appears to have died and his son Johann von Spanegge(a further spelling later given in the official documents) came into theinheritance of the rights to ‘hold’ the Burg. He also lived in the Burg and managed all the estate on behalf of theroyal owner.\n\n1305 1305 The son, Johann von Spanegge however found that it was not so simple toclaim his stake of the use of the Burg. We find that his claim was much disputed by the royals and often he hadto defend his rights through the courts. The main contenders for the Burg Sponeck at that time were thebrothers, Markgraf Heinrich III von Hachberg who was the Landgraf in theprovince of Breisgau and Markgraf Rudolf I von Hachberg of the city ofFreiburg. These brothers, on the 29thNovember 1305 officially lodged their claim to the Burg Sponeck through thelocal court on the grounds that it was supposed to revert to them after thedeath of Hildebrand Spenli. Johann, hisson, however was able to uphold his claim and kept the use of the Burg andEstate for a while longer. The courtruled that only on the passing of Johann Spenli could the Estate revert back tothe Hachbergs by virtue of the fact that it fell under the province of Breisgauwhich Emperor Rudolph I had inherited. As a Reichsburg it was denoted therefore also Emperor Rudolph’spossession with a number of other estates.\n\n1309 1309 The case of the claim to the Burg again came to the courts as recordedon the 13th October 1309. Thechief magistrate ruled again that in the light of insufficient evidence theroyals had no claim until the death of Johann. After this time however the family Spenli’s name is no longer recordedin association of the Burg and it is not known for how long it was indeed inJohann’s care. The Burg also did notrevert to the Counts of Hochberg after 1318 because of strife once again betweenthe princes and by this time it was part of the captured lands of the Lordsof Alsace which lay on the west side of the Rhine. So the Burg Sponeck changed sides andimperial owners and is no more recorded in the German records until 1333.\n\n1333 1333 On the 8th November 1333 we have a record in the general Landsarchivsof Karlsruhethat the Burg Sponeck was bought by the Knight Werner Gutemann vonHattstatt. He was a landvogt (districtbailiff) in Alsace. Of particular interest is the fact thatWerner von Hattstatt actually lived in the Castle and for a time called himself‘von Sponeck’ after his possession. TheKnight Werner von Hattstatt held the Burg for some time after 1333. This family shield of ‘arms’, which consistedof a gold shield with a red ‘X’, was brought onto the south-eastern side of thecastle. These very wealthy Hattstattsbought the Burg, in total it would seem, and again sold it at a later date to CountUlrich von Württemberg for one thousand two hundred Swiss Pounds. Therewith the Württemberg family entered intothe history of the Castle Sponeck. Itwas this von Württemberg family who would later marry into the early Knightlyfamily von Hedwiger, who were the forefathers of the present Spon(n)ecks. The Hattstatt family continued to stay in thecastle after 1333 as the Württembergs’ had no need of the residence of thecastle. The question can well be askedas to why the wealthy Knight Hattstatt would want to sell his Burg since he wasin no financial need. Count Ulrich wasmarried to Countess Stephania von Pfirt who was again related to the Hochbergsof Alsace, which brought him into the Dukedom of Mömpelgard. (French – Montbéliard in EasternFrance.) The main reasonwhy the Duke of Württemberg would have wanted to acquire the Burg could onlyhave been for its strategic position in giving to him a ‘private’ ferrycrossing of the Rhine between his Duchies of Württemberg on the east bank andMömpelgard on the west bank, the main crossing at Breisach still being in the handsof the Austrians who were yet unfriendly to Württemberg. It would appear that the Hattstatts hadoccupation until 1400. No doubt theprice paid by the duke and a contract of continued occupation had convinced theKnight Hattstatt to sell. There is littleinformation recorded with regard to the Burg for a further one hundred yearsbetween 1333 and 1433.\n\n1401 1401 It is recorded that on the 1st October 1401, the last of theHattstatts – the nobleman Hannemann von Sponeck relinquished the Burg toHesso von Uesenberg. We can herelist all the main families who then played a part in the history of the BurgSponeck. So far we have seen that theownership of the Burg changed amongst the royals due to marriage arrangementsas well as trading off as a result of wars between them. The lower aristocracy changed ‘leasehold’ forfinancial reasons very often. The mainfamilies were then the Markgrafen von Baden – their cousins, the Markgrafenvon Hachberg, the Counts of Freiburg, the Counts of Mömpelgard, the Countsof Württemberg, and the lesser nobles von Hattstatt, von Schnewelin, von Ow andvon Burtheim. Furthermore we have theCounts of Pfirt, the Counts of Straßburg, the Counts of Staufen and the Counts ofThierstein with the nobleman von Uesenberg. Another important party was the Duke of Austria who made a claim on theBurg Sponeck at the death of his wife, Johanna of Mömpelgard. The Württembergs great interest in the Burgwas because of the RhineRiver crossing, onceagain showing its strategic position. In1343 the Breisach crossing just south of the Burg was in the control of theDuke of Austria who at this time was in conflict and in a state of war with theDukes of Württemberg.\n\n1461 1461 Count Eberhard von Württemberg now gave his Burg Sponeck into the careof Bartholome Schnewelin, from a well-known Freiburg family, as a rewardfor his services to do with it as he pleased and to benefit from the winelands, salmon fishing and all else that went with the Burg. As long as he stayed in the Castle Sponeckand managed the estate and all that went with it for a livelihood he wasobliged to pay dues and to answer the call to serve and if he himself could notgo to war, he had to provide the service of a knight.\n\n1462 1462 Just two years later Count Eberhard von Württemberg-Mömpelgard decidedthat he wanted another faithful subject, one Balthazar von Ow to have thebenefit of the Sponeck estate and castle. Whether Balthazar took it up at this time is doubtful. Von Ow was in fact related by marriage to thepreviously named holder, Schnewelin. Balthazar von Ow came from a noble Swabian family that owned lands andestates in Tübingen.\n\n1477 1477 On the 16th August 1477, Count Eberhard vonWürttemberg-Mömpelgard confirmed his rewarding of Balthazar von Ow withthe Castle Sponeck and everything that went with it. This incorporated the fields, meadows, winegardens or vineyards plus the woods, salmon fisheries and fishing rights aswell as the Rhine ferry crossing.\n\n1496 1496 Balthazar von Ow eventually took up employment with the Austrian Regimeand thus divided his loyalties between Württemberg and Austria.\n\n1500 1500 By this time Balthazar von Ow was no longer alive and his son, Hans vonOw had the Burg and Estate as a ‘living right’. This was confirmed for Hans von Ow by the duke Ulrich von Württemberg,the son of Eberhard von Württemberg (Snr.) who had originally conferred it uponthe von Ow family. Eberhard vonWürttemberg-Mömpelgard died in the year 1496 at the age of fifty years.\n\nOn the 28th June 1502, Hans von Ow and his brothers and sisterssurrendered the Sponeck Estate back to Duke Ulrich von Württemberg for asettlement of 900 Gold Sovereigns. Shortly after this time war broke out between Austria and Württemberg and againBurg Sponeck was left without a caretaker. The Burkheim neighbours took the opportunity to possess the Rhine crossing during this time while the Sponeck gutor Estate was unattended. On the 10thJuly 1502 the old ‘holder’ of 1461, Batholomaus Schnewelin laid claim to theestate again and all its rights. Thecourt however did not uphold these legal rights this time.\n\n1519 1519 In 1519 Duke Ulrich von Württemberg was included in the SwabianConfederation of States and the Austrian Habsburg Emperor, Charles VHabsburg (An important character in a later Sponneck Saga) took over thesefederated states into the Austrian Empire. Archduke Ferdinand of Austriarelieved Burg Sponeck from the town council of Burkheim’s usurpation. Charles Vthen gave the neighbouring estate and Burg ‘Burtheim’, later Burkheim to the Bishopvon Straßburg as holder of the Dorf Arzenheim. This grant also included the Sponeck Rhinepassage.\n\n1522 1522 The Emperor, Charles V of Habsburg, who was looking after his Spanishpossessions and living in Spain,gave his brother, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria the rule of the SouthGerman Austrian Empire which included the southern German possessions of theHabsburg Empire and this also then gave him the rightful claim to the ReichsburgSponeck. In the following yearsthe castle and estate changed hands frequently. Recorded documents of the Freiburg City Archives dated 8thNovember 1525 state that the new owner, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria sold the profitable SponeckEstate to Dr. Casper Fabri who was at that time Bishop of Vienna. The bishop acquired the property with theusual legal rights and privileges for 300 Gold German Sovereigns.\n\n1524-1525 1524-1525 During this time the farmers of the western provinces rose in revoltagainst the princes and counts. Thiswar, known as the Bauernkrieg, raged for two years and many of theKaiserstuhl castles and estates suffered much damage. Burg Sponeck did not escape unscathed. The rebelling farmers in Breisach cameagainst the Counts of Tübingen. One oftheir castles, called Lichteneck was situated near Kenzingens. These counts were the two young brothers,Georg and Konrad von Tübingen. Theirguardian was one, the Imperial Councillor Rudolph von Blumeneck. They had inherited at an early age after thedeath of their childless Uncle Konrad in 1506. One year later Konrad’s younger brother also died leaving the two boysto inherit all their estates. In theyear 1519 the Emperor Maximilian had died and his grandson, Charles came to thethrone as Charles V at the age of twenty years. The farmers in Breisgau joined forces with the farmers in Kaiserstuhland Alsaceand plundered and burned the castles and estates of their young feudallords. The total revolt was just asruthlessly put down by the Austrian rulers in taking the ringleaders intocustody and after torturing them, jailing them and summarily executing them byhanging.\n\n1525 1525 After only a year, on the 1st October 1526, Dr Fabri gave theBurg to his brother, Councillor Johan Fabri who then in turn sold it toa friend for a considerable profit on the 15th October 1526 for 450Gold Sovereigns. The friend was one, JacobWasserhuhn who was a citizen of Breisach. The Duke of Austria however retained the profitable Rhinecrossing rights. In the town of Breisach council recordsof the 1st August 1524 we read of a mayor of Breisach being one,Claus Wasserhuhn who could have been a relative of Jacob Wasserhuhn. The next proud owner shortly thereafter was BalthazarMärklin, the Bishop of Constance who had his seat between 1529 and1531. He was also one time PrivyCouncillor and then Vice-Chancellor to the Emperor, Charles V and to hisbrother Ferdinand. He was afterwardappointed Bishop of Constance. Heappeared to own a number of estates in the Burg’s province of Kaiserstuhl. After his death his fellow bishops showed nointerest in the Burg Sponeck and so on the 11th March 1540 it wassold by public auction to Jacob von Bertheim for 680 GoldSovereigns. Once again the Burg Sponeckwas in the hands of a descendent of the Knight von Hattstatt. Jacob von Bertheim wanted to again make theEstates of Sponeck and Burkheim, which lay next to each other on the Rhine profitable. He also wished to repair the damage done to the castle during the Bauernkrieg. After only a few years however he grew tiredof the Gut and was glad to be able to surrender it for a profit.\n\n1546 1546 On the 26th March 1546, after just six years the Castle againchanged hands for a considerable price to the priestly Count Konrad vonLübingen-Lichteneck. He was adescendent from the Württemberg family. The Castle Hecklingen and the Burkheim Estates were his ancestralpossessions. Herewith another nobleecclesiastical had possession of the Sponeck Estate. During this time the famous German andEuropean Reformation was well underway with its leader, Martin Luther. So great an influence was his message of “thejust shall live by faith” as apposed to penitence and payment of indulgences,that many noblemen, high aristocracy and royalty were converted by the Lutheranteaching. Martin Luther was a professorof theology at the WittenburgUniversity. He began calling for the reform of the RomanCatholic Church. Luther’s criticismfound widespread support among all classes in Germany and resulted in farreaching social changes. The ‘PeasantsWar’ caused the greatest upheaval . Citing Luther’s plea for “liberty of all Christian men” the peasantscalled for an elective priesthood and abolition of various oppressive feudaldues.\n\n1546-1547 1546-1547 The Reformation led to great political upheaval and no other emperor wasever called upon to struggle with such division in his kingdom as Charles V,while he himself remained true to the Pope in Rome. Many other princes had however converted and so much friction resultedthat Charles V when to war against the many protestant princes, especially inthe south western provinces which also led to Burg Sponeck again suffering furtherdamage and neglect.\n\n1548-1549 1548-1549 As a result of this war the citizens of Burkheim took advantage of thesituation to rob and plunder the Sponeck Gut. While there was nobody to control theproperty, they invaded the fields and the timber forests of the Burg, cut downthe trees, and sold off the timber for their own profit. Duke Ulrich von Württemberg was one of theseconverted dukes and during the war of 1546/1547 with Charles V, he too had beenchased out of his Duchy of Württemberg. Only after fifteen years was he allowed to return to his Duchy.\n\n1551-1552 1551-1552 Duke Christoph von Württemberg and his cousin Count Georg vonWürttemberg received the Sponeck Gut back from the Emperor and thenunited their estates by contract with Mömpelgard, Horburg and Reichenweiler in Alsace.\n\n1560 1560 On the 12th August 1560 Emperor Ferdinand I pledged toLazarus von Schwendi the castle, town and the rulership of Burkheim witheverything that accrued and belonged to it for 10,000 Golden Pfandschillingand 1,000 Golden Pf. for a building fund. Lazarus von Schwendi’s second wife was one,Eleonore Countess von Zimmern. One canstill find the double coat-of-arms of Schwendi and von Zimmern over the portalof the BurkheimCastle ruins so it is claimed. Schwendi died in 1584. He had often been in need of funds and it washe who had established a lucrative means of income by establishing a toll forships on the Rhine plying up and down theriver at the Burg site. Schwendi was aclose friend of the Austrian Emperor and in good standing with the House ofWürttemberg. The Württembergs’ now setabout to make improvements to their castle Sponeck, to re-establish the salmoncatch and build a new boat for the ferry.\n\nA further‘caretaker’ of the Burg was Jörg Wickram. At this stage a great dispute had arisenbetween the holders of the Burg and the Council of Burkheim as to the boundaryof Burg Sponeck. This was nothing new asthese disputes had been going on since 1563 until the present time in theBurg’s history. Wickram was thereforenot able to establish much by way of income from the Gut and surrendered theBurg to his successor, one Gerson von Dieffenau, a Burgvogt ofthe Duke. He faired no better than hispredecessor in establishing an income from the estate.\n\nAt the end of the Sixteenth Century we fortunately find inthe General Provincial Archives of Karlsruhean authentic watercolour painting of the Burg Sponeck done in the year 1590 orat the latest, 1602. From this sketch wecan see that it was indeed not a big fortress by that time. The position of the Estate being on the hilland overseeing the Rhine crossing kept it in aposition of importance.\n\nWe come now to a most unfortunate and terrible time in thehistory of Europe and Germanycalled the THIRTY YEARS WAR. Continuingreligious struggles and rising nationalist movements throughout the empirebrought about the Thirty Years War. Between 1618 and 1648 Germanywas devastated and lost between one third and one half of its population andthe empires borders were greatly reduced. Bohemia sparked the rebellion when in1618 a civil war erupted in Pragueas Protestants, inflamed by Habsburg persecution, threw three imperialofficials from a royal castle window and established a rebel regime. Fortunately the three men were not seriouslyhurt, it is reported. The course of thewar went as follows: 1619 – ProtestantFrederick V was crowned King of Bohemia; two days later Ferdinand II, aCatholic, was elected the new Holy Roman Emperor. 1620 – Ferdinand’s Habsburg forces crushed Frederick in the Battleof White Mountains. 1625 Denmark joinedthe war. Denmark’s Christian IV rallied anarmy to the flagging Protestant cause. 1626 – The imperial forces destroyed half of the Danish army atLutter. 1629 – Christian IV agreed toabandon Protestants in the Treaty of Lübeck. The Edict of Restitution threatened Germany with Catholicdomination. Sweden picked up the torch. 1630 – Franceand Sweden were in allianceagainst Austria. Sweden entered the war in that sameyear. Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden assumedmilitary command of the Protestants. 1631 – Gustavus’s disciplined forces checked the Habsburg threat to Europe in the Battle of Breitenfeld. 1632 – The Habsburg armies were defeated atLützen but King Gustavus was killed in a cavalry charge. 1634 – The Swedes were crushed at Nördlingenand forced to evacuate southern Germany. 1635 – The Peace of Prague marked the defeat of the majorProtestant princes by the Habsburgs. Catholic France allied with Protestant Sweden and Germany thendeclared war on the Habsburg Empire. 1636– Burg Sponeck was utterly destroyed in the conflict. Only part of the tower remained. 1638 – Francebribed Sweden back into theconflict and then attacked Germany,which reeled under the assault. 1648 –The Peace of Westphalia was concluded after four years of negotiation between France, Swedenand Austria. A war-torn Germany was left fragmented intothree hundred odd principalities. TheFrench held Alsace and Lorraine at the end of the war thus robbingWürttemberg of their principality of Mömpelgard. Under the terms of the Peaceof Westphalia in 1648 Germany’snumerous feudal princes gained virtually sovereign rights under the nominalsuzerainty of the emperor. The countriespresent for the signing of the Peace Accord were the agents for the Emperor,the German states, Sweden, France, Spainand Netherlands. The most embattled realms such as Württemberglost more than half their population, dead or dispersed. Elsewhere the loss was less severe. Most historians agree that an overallpopulation decline of 15%-20% from 20 million to 16 or 17 million peopleoccurred during the war and the ensuing epidemics. For Germany, over all, the war was atraumatic experience. As a time ofunmitigated disaster it is rivalled in the national consciousness only by the1939-1945 war. Other castles like thoseof Hochberg and Burkheim were likewise totally destroyed during the ThirtyYears War.\n\n1634 1634 The Burg Sponeck by this time could no longer serve as a manor as it wasby now severely damaged and the Estate was calamitously run down because of theAustrian and French/Swedish exchange of fire during the Thirty Years War. A chronicle report states that in August 1634the Burg was occupied by the Austrian Markgraf’s troops who were securing the Rhine crossing at Burg Sponeck during this time ofhostilities. The strategic position andoccupation of the river-crossing site during war once again showed itsimportance. The broader fate of the BurgSponeck during the noise of the Thirty Years War is not known. By 1636 the little castle was totallydestroyed and we know that the estate had lost its use as a bridgehead due tothe fact that the Württemberg lands on the left and right side of the Rhine had been separated. After the signing of the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which ended thelong tiresome war in Central Europe and hadinvolved many foreign forces, the Burg was again found in the possession of theDukes of Württemberg and would remain so until 1806 at the collapse of theHabsburg Empire.\n\n1695 1695 We now come to the part of the Burg Sponeck history that has a directrelationship to the history of the present families of Spon(n)eck. By this time the owner of Burg Sponeck wasDuke Leopold Eberhard von Württemberg-Mömpelgard. On the 1st June 1695 this youngtwenty-five year old duke in exile married the beautiful nineteen-year-old AnnaSabina von Hedwiger. She was descendedfrom an old noble knightly family from Silesia. The Austrian Emperor by imperial decreecreated her a Countess-of-the-Empire on the 2nd August 1701. This high and prestigious title she sharedwith her son and two daughters and her three brothers. Her husband, Duke Leopold Eberhard vonWürttemberg-Mömpelgard was also known as the Reichsgraf von Sponeck. The von Hedwiger family from then on werealso called by the title name of von Sponeck. So they too shared in the fame of the Burg as their title name. The eldest brother, Georg Wilhelm vonHedwiger was at this time President of the government in Mömpelgard, which wasa principality of the Württembergs in Alsace, France. He also held the rank of Colonel andcommanded the Duke’s Mömpelgard Regiment. We shall of course hear more of this in a later chapter. Duke Leopold Eberhard von Württembergwas at this time the legal holder of the Burg Sponeck with its wine, fishingand ferry rights although the castle itself was still in ruins.\n\n1714 1714 After nineteen years the Duke and Anna Sabina Reichsgräfin vonSponeck divorced and she was granted her claim to the Burg Sponeck as partof the divorce settlement in a contract dated 31st October1714. Her claim might have been good forthe fishing rights and the areas of the Rhine Ferry; however wars had beenraging once again between Franceand the GermanStates and for a time the Burg Sponeckand all that went with it had fallen into the French camp. Anna Sabina and her younger brother, JohannRudolph von Hedwiger Reichsgraf von Sponeck who was at this time the PrimeMinister of Mömpelgard and Chief Master of the Hunt had also come under Frenchcontrol being on the west side of the Rhine during the years of conflict inwhich the French King had pushed his borders beyond the Rhine.\n\n1735 1735 Anna Sabina Reichsgräfin von Sponeck died at Hericourt in Alsace in thePrincipality of Mömpelgard. The SponeckEstate however stayed with her family until 1748 after which it wasreincorporated with Württemberg from Franceaccording to the contract of 1617 between Franceand the GermanProvince.\n\n1781 1781 In an application dated 30th July 1781 one, Baron Ägid Joseph Karl von Fahnenberg requestedpermission from the Mömpelgard Council to be given the use of the Sponeck Estate. From this petition we understand that theproperty was completely destroyed after some thirty years neglect and that itwas of no value due to the fact that the chase after the RhineIslandwas also lost during the previous century wars. Ägid von Fahnenberg was the life holder of the Austrian Demesne and hadan interest in Sponeck because it was now under his Austrian Demesne ofBurkheim. Around the Burg ruin was abadly constructed house with a barn and stable. There was also a garden and a five and a half Morgan field with a hedgeround and a neglected field that once made up a vineyard. In 1778 the property was hired by GrossmannBeck of the town of Jechtingen,which he held for twelve years. Therequest therefore of Baron von Fahnenberg was never ceded although he madeseveral representations to get it into his demesne. Grossmann Beck leased the property from theCouncil in Mömpelgard for 41 pfund 13 Shilling and 4 Pfennig. With this he was allowed to do the necessaryrepairs and so left no grounds for the indictment of Baron von Fahnenberg tothe government in Stuttgartthat the Burggut was in sad neglect.\n\n1789 1789 A new period began for the area of the Burg Sponeck with the time of theFrench Revolution. During this time allthe French feudal lords were either chased out of France(many fled to Denmarkand were taken up in the Danish Aristocracy) or were captured by the citizensand executed at the guillotine. Theirlands were confiscated and became the property of the State. The French Revolution transformed the BourbonKingdominto a constitutional state around intense excitement east of the Rhine. While theintellectuals welcomed the change hoping it would spread to central Europe as well, the princes on the other hand were from theoutset fearful of similar revolt against their rule also erupting. The result was growing hostility between thegovernment in Paris and the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n1790 1790 On the 9th March 1791 another lessee is recorded as havingtaken up the leasehold of the Sponeck property. He was Sebastian Sichler of Burkheim who was to lease the estatefor a sum of 150 French Livres per year. The estate was to stay in the Sichler family for close to a hundredyears until the end of the 19th century after which it was to becometheir property to hold and to own by title deed. On the 11th November 1801Sebastian Sichler became the Mayor of Burkheim. In that same year the government gave to Sebastian Sichler the Burggutand all that went with it for a settlement sum of 500 Gold Sovereigns as aninheritable ‘life holding’.\n\n1792-1797 1792-1797 The wars with Napoleon next influenced the politics of the Burgarea. The immediate occasion of theconflict in the War of the First Coalition was a quarrel over the rights ofGerman Princes with holdings in Franceand over the propagandistic atrocities of French émigrés in Germany. But the real cause was the clash of twoincompatible forms of Government divided by profound differences regarding thenature of political and social justice. The course of hostilities soon revealed that the civic ideas andmilitary tactics of the French Revolution were more than a match for thedecrepit Holy Roman Empire. After 1793 the left bank of the Rhineremained under the control of Franceand so for the next twenty years its inhabitants were governed from Paris. There was no evidence however of thedissatisfaction of the Germans who seemed to accept the change as easily as achange in dynasty or a new succession to the throne. Although the Austrians held out two yearslonger, the brilliant successes of the young Napoleon forced them to accept theloss of the left bank of the Rhine in the Treaty of Campo Formio on October 17,1797.\n\n1798-1802 1798-1802 The War of the Second Coalition. Thepeace proved short-lived for at the end of 1798 a new coalition directedagainst Francewas formed. Austria played the same leadingrole with the same unfortunate result. The French victories at Marengo on the 14th June 1800 andHohenlinden on the 3rd December 1800 forced Emperor Frances II toagree to the Treaty of Lunéville on the 9th February 1801 whichconfirmed the cession of the Rhineland to France. The chief victims of the Final Recess werethe free cities and the ecclesiastical territories. Bavaria,Württemberg, Baden, Hess-Darmstadt and Nassauwere the big winners in the competition for booty that had been the main objectof the negotiations. Napoleon could notkeep Austria and Prussia frommaking some gains. He was especiallysolicitous for the welfare of those German rulers mostly in the south who werestrong enough to be valuable vassals, but not strong enough to be potentialthreats. Napoleon had cleverly pittedthe princes against the emperor to enhance the role that Pariscould play in the affairs of Central Europe.\n\n1803 1803 Baron Fahnenberg continued to lodge claim to the Sponeck property and atthis time it is recorded that a certain Major General Count von Sponeck, adescendant from the von Hedwiger family, also lodged a claim of ownership ofthe Sponeck Estate. As to exactly whichbranch of the family this ‘major general’ belonged has been difficult toascertain and the author is of the opinion that he might have been from thelater extinct French line. The DuchyGovernment however ruled that since sixty years had elapsed since the Sponeckfamily had held the estate the general’s claim was unfounded. Fahnenberg also, who no longer lived inWürttemberg gave up on his claims. Onthe 11th May 1803 the Mayor Sichler was given the noble title of Burgvogt(advocate) with the Burggut Sponeck for 50 Gold Sovereignsyearly. Sichler from then on nevermanaged the estate himself but subleased the property at a profit for 66 GoldSovereigns yearly. This was not beneficialbecause the lessee then established a ‘public house’ or tavern in the ruins,which was described as an undesirable situation for the neighbouring countryfolk. In the meantime the NapoleonicWars had been raging.\n\n1805-1807 1805-1807 The War of the Third Coalition broke out in 1805 when Austria joined the third coalition of greatpowers determined to reduce the preponderance of France. The outcome was even more disastrous. Napoleon forced the main Habsburg army in Germany to surrender at Ulm on October 17, 1805. He then descended on Vienna,occupied the capital and finally inflicted a crushing defeat on the combinedRussian and Austrian armies at Austerlitz in Moravia on December 2,1805. Before the year ended, Frances IIhad been forced to sign the Treaty of Pressburg on December 26th,which signified the end of the dominant role of his dynasty in Central Europe. Hehad to surrender his possessions in western Germanyto Württemberg and Baden. The rulers of the secondary states in thesouth supported Napoleon in the war against Austria and were richlyrewarded. They shared in the bootyseized from the Habsburgs and were permitted to absorb the remaining freecities, petty principalities and ecclesiastical territories.\n\n1806 1806 In the summer of 1806 the secondary states, encouraged and prodded by Paris, announced that they were going to form a separateassociation to be known as the Confederation of the Rhine. On the 1st August they proclaimedtheir secession from the Empire and a week later on August 6thFrances II announced that he was laying down the Imperial Crown. The Holy Roman Empirethus came officially to an end after a history of a thousand years. All the Habsburg possessions were dividedbetween those states and provinces that helped Napoleon, as did Baden and Württemberg. The reprieve of the Napoleonic Wars had seen the Sponeckgut passfrom the Kingdom of Württemberg to Badenaccording to a contract of 17th October 1806. Never again did Württemberg have a claim tothe Burggut Sponeck. Itwas finally incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Baden. For Sichler this was a source of contention,as the ‘Life Holder’ contract with Württemberg of 1803 was not yetfinalised. The Baden Government tookover the total ownership of the Sponeck Estate and released Sichler from thelease. This caused a contention that wasto rage through the law courts for twenty years and on the death of the oldmayor Sichler on the 20th March 1823. His nephew, the postmaster, Anton Sichler whowas Sebastian’s only heir was to further the legal wrangle.\n\n1826 1826 On the 2nd August 1826 the case of Anton Sichler came to thecourt in Freiburg and it was ruled that theWürttemberg Contract of 1803 should be upheld between Württemberg and theSichler family.\n\n1828 1828 A new contract was drawn up on the 18th June 1828 giving thepostmaster, Anton Sichler the continued ‘living rights’ to the Burg Sponeck\n\n1829 1829 The struggle was to go on with regard to the borders of the Estate. The Citizen Council of Jechtingen had claimedthe land on the Rhine bank. Sichlercontended that the Rhine should be the Burg’swestern border. The Rhinehad also however been diverted some time before. Anton Sichler never personally managed theproperty, but gave it out to others to manage on his behalf.\n\n1830 1830 On the 24th September 1830 the aged Anton Sichler entered acontract with his twenty year old nephew, Sebastian Sichler II, the sonof his brother Theodor Sichler that he should take over the ‘living right’ ofthe Burg and continue the fight for full possession. Sebastian Sichler was the last member of theSichler family to have an interest in the Burg. At first, Sebastian lived on the estate and managed it himself. After the death of his Uncle Anton, the final‘life holders’ contract was issued to Sebastian on the 17th May1839. Sebastian however was notsatisfied with the fact that the property stayed in ownership of the BadenGovernment and his struggle continued for total transfer of ownership tohimself as a private holding.\n\n1853 1853 On the 12th February 1853 the Domain Chamber of the Archduchyof Baden in Karlsruhefelt that the Sponeck Castle Ruins and Estate should stay with the State forhistorical reasons. They sent anofficial from the ‘Land and Building Council’ – a Building Inspector Fischer todo a survey of the property. His reportdated 12th April 1853 stated that the Burg ruins had noarchitectural value. He reported on thecondition of the ruins and stated that the only part of the building that wasof interest was one stone on which the coat-of-arms of the Württembergs wasreflected. He also felt that the ruinshad no historical value and therefore no sentimental value. In effect, he reported that it was an eyesoreto the surrounding beauty of the area and to restore it would cost the statefar too much for the value it would have to the county. Sebastian Sichler then submitted that theruins and estate had indeed sentimental and real value to him and his family,having been associated with it for so long and by granting him the ‘titledeeds’ he would restore it at his own expense and improve the property ingeneral. Once again the town council ofJechtingen put in their claim to the Rhine Bank in front of Sponeck and afterthree years of deliberations a final decision was reached.\n\n1856 1856 Sebastian Sichler was at last successful in his claim of the Sponeckgutand on the 23rd July 1856 the final contract and ‘title deed’were drawn up and he was given the Estate of five and a half Morgan for a fulland final purchase settlement figure of 1,101 Floren 12 Shilling. This ruling by the Government of Badenbrought about the last time that the Sponeck Castle Ruin and Estate was in thehold of the Emperor or a Duchy as a property of that dignitary or State. It finally passed into private hands with thefull free legal hold and ownership as real estate to be held by titledeed. Ever since this date then theSponeck Estate has been in private ownership and cannot be ‘claimed’ unless bypurchase agreement from the present owners.\n\n1859 1859 In the year 1859 Sebastian Sichler began the building of themansion on top of the old burg site to its near present state. All that remained of the old Burg at thistime was one sidewall of the tower and the foundations on which it had stood.\n\n1860 1860 Sebastian Sichler and his wife, Caroline, born Bercher, bequeathed theSponeck Estate to their daughter, Emma Helger. She was married to Xavier Helger who helpedher with the management of the Estate. They lived together in the Herrnhaus that her father had built onthe site all her life.\n\n1889 1889 On the 8th March 1889 the property became the inheritance oftheir son, Franz Xaver Helger. Franz however had no interest in the property and let it deteriorateover the years.\n\n1905 1905 In the year 1905 Franz sold the Burggut to Karl Bohny fromJechtingen. He had been made an offerfor 34,000 Reichs Mark for the property, which even at that time was possiblyan extravagant amount of money. Afteronly five years Karl Bohny found himself being forced to sell the property for9,000 Reich Mark as these were bad times and many properties were mortgagedoff.\n\n1910 1910 The next owner, Anton Gerhart of Jechtingen and his wifeTheresia, born Ehrlacher managed the Sponeckgut for the next sevenyears.\n\n1917 1917 On the 12th July 1917, while the First World War was ragingon the other side of the Rhine, a director of the Arts Academy in Karlsruhe, HansAdolph Bühler and his wife, Johanna (born Jockerst) ‘fell in love’ with andpurchased the Sponeck Estate for 25,000 Reich Mark. His dream was to restorethe Burg to something of its original style.\n\n1924 1924 Burg Sponeck at this time had a very famous visitor in the person of Dr.Albert Schweitzer of African Missionary fame who came to have his portraitpainted by Professor Bühler who was a well-known artist in Germany. Dr. Schweitzer then presented ProfessorBühler with an African wooden mask artefact, which he kept in his studio formany years.\n\n1930 1930 In the year 1930 Hans Bühler and his friend, building contractorHeinrich Brenzinger from Freiburg started onthe reconstruction of the tower to the form that we see it today. Professor Bühler then set up a studio in thetop of the tower where he painted numerous pictures showing the Rhine Plain, Alsace and the VosgesMountains. On the 19th May 1938 the Burg andtown of Jechtingen had another visitor in the person of the German Führerand Reichskanzler, Adolph Hitler together with his retinue and GauleiterRobert Wagner and Minister of Culture Wacker. Professor Bühler and his wife invited him to lunch after which he wishedto see the lay of the land from the tower and the blockhouses of the Maginotline on the opposite bank. This was not the only reason however, as he alsowished to see the paintings of the Professor. He had no doubt heard ofProfessor Bühler through Minister Wacker and Gauleiter Wagner, who were bothacquaintances of the Artist.\n\n1939 1939 The Second World War broke out on the 1st September1939. Once more war came near BurgSponeck as the German forces massed all along the Rhine for the invasion of France on the15th June 1940.\n\n1940 1940 The attack on Francethat was to be called the Blitzkrieg brought troops along the wholeWestern Border with the southern most army attack to cross the Rhine at the Burg Sponeck area. The armies crossed at Breisach, along the Rhine, and at the old Sponeck Rhine crossing. During this time the tower was badly damagedbut by 1941 it had already been repaired. The 7th Army was to be the southernmost invasion force into France. The month before Major General Hans GrafSponeck had been busy with the northern airborne attack into Holland. Two newly established and trained airborne divisions were to beused. He was to command one and followthe other under the command of Lieutenant General Student who was to lead intothe attack. Also involved at this timewas Colonel Theodor Graf Sponeck who was in command of an armoureddivision. We shall hear more of thishowever in a later chapter dealing with these Sponecks’ famous war campaigns.\n\n1945 In the last weeks of the SecondWorld War Burg Sponeck was once again to find itself in the midst ofconflict. In a war journal of the PriestBrutscher we have a very vivid description of the last days of the war in theJechtingen area. He reported that on the1st February 1945 at 9.00 hrs the ground shook and the houses quakedunder the bombardment of the Allied Forces bombers as they cress crossed overthe town and bombed the Rhine woods in preparation for the crossing intoGermany, whilst the German forces unleashed the ‘flak’ (Anti-aircraftfire). The Sponeck ferry was bombed andhit while pontoons were set across the river and the allied soldiers pouredover the Rhine at this spot on their south-eastern push into Germany. We have a report from the book ‘Jechtingenand Burg Sponeck’ that the lower barn house was destroyed that served asProfessor Bühler’s studio with the outbuildings. With that, many of his art works andpaintings with his inventories went up in flames. Professor Hans Adolph Bühler died at hisbeloved Burg on the 19th October 1951 and was buried on the edge ofthe woods on the border of the Sponeck Estate. His grave can be seen from the tower at the edge of the garden. Hans Bühler left Burg Sponeck in his lastwill and testament to his son, Dr Engelhardt Bühler (Snr.) who inturn made a considerable contribution both technically and financially in theuncovering and restoration of the Roman fortress foundations.\n\n1989 1989 Once again, a third generation inherited the Burg Sponeck. These were the grandchildren of Hans AdolphBühler, Dr Engelhardt Bühler (Jnr.) and his three sisters, one of whichis Lady-Doctor Almuth Bühler-Morgenstern."
