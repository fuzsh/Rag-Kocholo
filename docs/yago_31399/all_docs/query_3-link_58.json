DEDICATED TO 3VEY THREE SONS HANSEL, LEXEL, AND BOLKO ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Thanks And thanks : and ever oft good turns Are shuffled off with such uncunent pay. \\ my humble duty, I have to offer to His Majesty King George V. my sincere thanks for his kindness in graciously allow- ing me to publish a letter addressed to me by King Edward VIL in 1901. To Lord Rosebery I am specially indebted for his permission — which is very rarely given — to quote several interesting letters which he at various times wrote to me. I also offer my sincere thanks to Lady Mary Enroll, Lord Albemarle, Sir Arthur Crosfield, Colonel W. E. Gordon, V.C., Lord Grey of Fallodon, Captain Robin Grey, the Honourable Ivan Hay, and Lord Winterton, for permission to make use of some of their letters. If there are any others whom I should have asked for leave to use their letters, and through inadvertence have not done so, I beg for forgiveness. It is not possible to name individually, all those who have helped me with this book ; many of them had to suffer tedious hours having it read aloud to them over and over again. I must not, however, fail to record my great indebtedness and warm gratitude to Major Chapman-Huston, Colonel Guy Wyndham, Miss Frances Alexina Todd, Miss Dorothy Crowther, Mrs. Ralph Beck, and Mr, Edward Ellul, for invaluable help in preparing the manuscript and seeing the volume published : nor would I forget little Joe Craven, who last winter at Munich spent hours making a Chronology when he might have been skating ; if any of the dates are wrong the fault is mine, not his. D. OF P. LA NAPOULE, ALPES MARITIMES, t, 1928, 7 INTRODUCTION V IT THEN Daisy Princess of Pless did me the \\/\\/ honour of consulting me about her in- » * tention to write her Reminiscences, I ven- tured to advise her to be perfectly frank about herself and others. Fortunately this advice accorded with her own open temperament and outspoken manner of expression and, except when to be candid would have hurt living persons, she has followed it : auto- biography that is neither revealing nor self-revealing is merely futile. The Princess's book, which ends dramatically in November, 1918, covers the twenty-five years im- mediately preceding the Great War and has the supreme merit of being founded on her own diaries and on letters she has written and received. Con- sequently, in her volume we get what she felt, thought and knew at the time, a genuineness of feeling, of thought and knowledge uninfluenced by subsequent reaction or recantation. While this fixed quality is always a great merit in a volume of recollections, it seems to me to be specially precious when crystallized in the mind of a writer who has watched from behind the scenes during great historic events. Very widely known in Europe and America for many years as Princess Henry of Pless, the authoress was formerly Mary Theresa Olivia Cornwallis-West, elder daughter of Colonel CornwaUis-West, of Ruthin Castle, Denbighshire, and Newlands Manor, Hamp- shire. Colonel Cornwallis-West's grandfather was a younger son of the third Earl de la Warr. The Barony of de la Warr dates from 1209, the Barony of West from 1342, and although the Earldom dates only from 1761, the Sackville branch of the family 9 io INTRODUCTION held the Dukedom of Dorset from 1720 until 1843, when the sixth Duke and fourteenth Earl dying un- married, it became extinct. Through her maternal grandmother, Lady Olivia, daughter of Thomas, second Marquess of Headfort, who married the Reverend Frederick FitzPatrick, the Princess is connected with the distinguished Irish families of Taylour and FitzPatrick, and amongst her kinsfolk are the Maxwells, Stanhopes, Churchills, Wynyards, Grosvenors, Lurnleys, Wyndhams, Rus- sells, and many other great families. In 1891 Daisy Cornwallis-West married Prince Henry or Pless, eldest son of Hans Heinrich XL, the then reigning Prince. For the marriage the Corn- wallis-West family had to produce the long pedigree and the innumerable quarterings considered indis- pensable on the Continent ; this was quite easily done, incidentally proving the bride's royal descent from Henry III. ; Prince Henry in return was able to show a descent equally illustrious, his family, even then an ancient one, being first ennobled in 1650: the Principality of Pless became an appanage of the Hochberg family in 1847, when Count Hans Heinrich X. of Hochberg succeeded the last Duke of Anhalt- Cothen-Pless. The Princess was married almost direct from the schoolroom, having had only one short season in London. A very young and totally inexperienced girl, she suddenly found herself the wife of the heir to one of the richest Princes in Europe, and plunged into all the difficulties of Court and social life in Germany. Her English training, her love of freedom, her love of nature, the open-air life she had led with animals and flowers in Wales and Hampshire, and her total lack of social experience, ill-fitted the Princess for the complexities of existence at a Court enslaved by a narrow and rigid etiquette, and presided over by the dictatorial mind of the Emperor William II. However, with an ardent, courageous, and perhaps unduly impulsive nature she made a personal success INTRODUCTION n that has become almost legendary ; and while her beauty, which was world-famous, inevitably aroused some jealousies, her extraordinary charm, sincerity and simplicity made her innumerable friends. H PL an estate burg .in SaxoMjU-^jaaJ^ chateau On becoming a Serene Highness and consort of the Head of the Princely House of Pless, the Princess found herself compelled by her position to live a life that she considered to be impossible. In England, where Court life itself is comparatively simple, and where state and ceremony are customary only on the greatest occasions, we have no conception of the stiffness of the etiquette and the extraordinary amount of ceremony observed before the War at the Courts of even the less important German Princes. Brought up as a simple English country girl and with her ancestral inheritance of Welsh and Irish blood, the Princess found herself stifled and bored by the magnifi- cence of Fiirstenstein and Pless. Ceremonial life for a few weeks in Berlin during the season she would, and could, have cheerfully borne ; but the state maintained by her husband in his homes she found ridiculous and, let it be confessed, even a little vulgar ! ^^ and hunters, •K i »', J ui I'M\"! ya itift ii i«a ; wets^a simrce ^Le^dless d^ agvgr the mcQ^p^rab|e Kqi^mQ Coj^ance^Duchess c^Westminster is admitted to be, tfie PJIP^ ridfiJL^^ riders, the |agers -yvho fQlfoyq^^^ or jajsgj^^ surroundingjbfit 12 INTRODUCTION a journey, shejEl^^ . -, -^£OU^^ ygggge,,M«<J^^ ... who ••'Wflfik Vin^qe^ft g.T>d .i£idlllgenO& .. lt8!K^Jtft..JSP^T was, -not etiqiu£^ Pnnpp Jk XAAJ-VrfV/ \"^i** *•$*•}*\"• *f ,y«T)yr,*\"w''''* ^\"! •^t>lt\" ''TT'r,''lT,?lrilcr »->-\"\"- '•^\"/'7\"r>T'iM,*wn^H»rl\"i'\"T-'>iTOj™ • ''**\"' rb^mt ^Custom /i^^ed.i^t^/jip^c^e!. for elderly v^^^^fi^\"''an3T for lajdj?^ ^9 ^!?re * r e(5?a^ or whom she par$^ Germaa *-*'*\"^ - \" iV;\\e thr^SjOT^i) tofa^dPtt^ wi««^»«»™«^ ;• % . -••-••- ^ ^ uthe ^^^ ^ s-West the tom- boy^who hated dressing up, loved stables and kennels better than Courts and drawing-rooms, and who could climb trees quite as well as her brother George ! The Jagers, the Bodyguard, the Master of the Horse, the Comptroller of the Household, the numberless Grooms of the Chambers, Footmen and so on, were bad enough, but to have even her bedroom con- tinually encumbered by servants seemed to the Princess unendurable. Moreover, to a girl who loved best a punt on a pond at Newlands, or her own little private garden at Ruthin, the twenty or thirty square miles of private park at Fiirstenstein in the centre of a vast forest, and the finest gardens in Silesia, were a weariness. The castle of Pless, it is true, dates in part from the thirteenth century, but most of it was rebuilt about 1870 and, like Fiirstenstein it was, in those days, magnificence and gilded discomfort from end to end. Homeliness, privacy, simplicity — none of all this she found. Is it any wonder that the young Princess hated it all? The expenditure was on a ridiculous scale, the kitchens and cellars alone costing thirty thousand pounds sterling a year. Everything else was equally lavish. Even that was not enough. MAIN INTRODUCTION 13 When his father died the Prince of Pless started re- modelling, enlarging and rebuilding Fiirstenstein. It is now decorated and furnished in perfect taste. The work took twenty years and cost a King's ransom. The result, however, is that the house is not only one of the largest, but one of the most interesting in Europe : one of the most extraordinary items of information in this unusual book is that the building operations went on right through the War ! Another is that in the highest German circles everyone seems to have spoken or written English without let or hindrance. Nearly all the correspondents of the Princess, including her husband and family, used English only* A German married in England or France dare not have acted thus ! II Richly endowed by nature with brains, charm, wit, understanding, and, one might say, from her cradle intimate with prominent and influential personages, the Princess could never have been satisfied with mere social triumphs or content with her place and fame as the most lovely Princess in Europe. She aspired1* to a position, not indeed of prominence, but of usefulness in the organization of practical affairs, which is the inevitable and therefore not the least important mission of those who would be worthy of their high station ; as we shall learn, she was never at her ease in being merely ornamental. Throughout her njarried life the Princess has taken the keenest interest in international politics, in which she frequently interposed with advantage. For years she persisted in warning the German Emperor against neglecting Russia and throwing her into the arms of France — which is exactly what he did do. The Princess knew and liked Russia, was acquainted with the Czar and Czarina and numbered many members of the Imperial family amongst her intimate friends. Her main preoccupations, however, were the relation- ships between England and Germany ; again and again i4 INTRODUCTION she acted as an unofficial peacemaker between the two countries. Knowing well and having a high regard and affection for both King Edward VII . and the Emperor William II., she always poured oil on the oft-troubled waters of their intercourse* The Emperor was ever her kind, indulgent and helpful friend, and she saw perhaps an amiable side of his nature, now too often forgotten by both his foes and his former friends. She quotes in her pages some of the frank letters of advice she frequently sent him and which, it is only fair to emphasize, he accepted in the sincere, Ipyal and truthful spirit in which they were written. From the early 'nineties until 1914 the Princess was one of the most notable ladies of fashionable and social life in Germany and England. Indeed it is hardly too much to say that she has known every man of famous accomplishments and every woman of famous beauty in England, Germany, France and Austria during the past twenty-five years ; and every one who reads these pages will admit that she has exercised an important, and always pacific and benevolent, influence on Anglo-German relations. Through whosoever fault it might be that the Euro- pean war broke out, it was certainly not through hers ; for years she foresaw and dreaded it, and did all that one woman could possibly do to avert it. Ill The outbreak of War in 1914 put the Princess in a terribly difficult — almost an impossible — position. Finding that in Silesia in the neighbourhood of her home she was looked upon as a foreigner and a spy and her presence resented, she became a Sister in a Berlin War Hospital, served successively on the French, Austrian and Serbian fronts, was watched all the time as a possible traitor, and, towards the end of the War, had the bitterness of seeing her eldest son go out to fight against the country of her birth. She had, however, at least two real consolations. One was her INTRODUCTION 15 personal work for British Prisoners-of-War in Ger- many ; the other was the sympathetic understanding and moral support of practically all her intimate English, Austrian, Spanish, American, and German friends. All her life, and perhaps more particularly during the period of the War, the Princess kept up a close correspondence with members of nearly all the German Royal Houses and, through her great friend the Crown Princess (Princess Margaret of Connaught) with the Swedish Court . From these letters she quotes in her Reminiscences as far as it is at present wise and discreet to do so. She gives us intimate views of the German Emperor, the Crown Prince, the Crown Princess, the Emperor's youngest sister, Princess Margaret (Princess Frederick Charles of Hesse) — another of rrincess Daisy's greatest friends — his second sister, Victoria Princess Adolphe of Schaumburg-Lippe (Frau Alexander von Zoubkoff), the Emperor Karl of Austria, the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg- Strelitz, and many others of similar authority: Princess Frederick Charles of Hesse, the Crown Princess of Sweden and the Princess of Pless had all the same \" little name \" and were known to their intimates as \" the three Daisies,\" The letters to the Princess from Prince Eitel Fritz of Prussia, the second son of the Emperor, were they available, would in themselves make a complete picture of the War as seen from the German High Quarters in the field. From the end of 1914 to the downfall of Russia, Pless was the Headquarters of the German Armies in the East, and to it came the Emperor, the young Austrian Emperor Karl, the Kings of Saxony and Wiirttemberg — indeed all the German federated Princes — Prince Henry of Prussia, the German Crown Prince, the King of Bulgaria, the Turkish Crown Prince, prominent Generals like Hindenburg, and statesmen like Bethmann-Hollweg. We catch glimpses of them at the council table, walking and talking in the gardens, or making themselves agreeable to their ho$tess in her private sitting-room. The Princess reveals fully for 16 INTRODUCTION the first time the authentic history of the tragic suicide of the young Duke of Mecklenburg- Strelite in 1918. IV The Princess, who now lives a good deal in Munich, is on intimate terms with many members of the Bavarian Royal Family ; the late King, Ludwig III., was her friend, as are the Crown Prince Rupprecht, the Duke Luitpold, Prince Ludwig Ferdinand, his wife, Marie de la Paz, an Infanta of Spain, and their daughter, Princess Pilar, who has for Princess Daisy an enduring affection. All through the War King Ludwig went out of his way to be charming to English- women married to Germans, and to the Princess, as to many others, Bavaria was an oasis of peace in a desert of hate. Through her three sons, her daughter-in-law, her cousin Countess Larisch and her innumerable rdations and connections, the Princess is in touch with the post-war generations in England, Ger- many, France, Poland, Spain, Austria and Czecho- slovakia. Statesmen and diplomats have whispered guarded secrets to her ; artists have clamoured to portray her perfect English beauty. Utterly frank about herself, her family, her beautiful mother Mrs. Cornwallis-West, and her friends, she is never merely scandalous ; yet her gentle malice opens windows to truth: her Irish wit stings but never wounds. No such intimate picture of the brilliance, wealth, gaiety and fascination of social life in pre-war England and Germany as thi$ has ever been painted, because no other woman. of! pur time was so completely at home in the two cQufttries. To the world the Princess became known 3s the typical English beauty with golden hair, perfect complexion, graceful stature, and ineffaceable charm. She could walk, ride, hunt, shoot, sail, sing, |>lay and dance to perfection. She looked the fairy Princess, She could talk. She could do her utmost to obey King Edward's parting behest at INTRODUCTION 17 her wedding, \" to learn German and become a faithful subject of her adopted country \" ; she could do most things — but she could never quite forget she was an Englishwoman, and in pre-war Prussia that helped no one. Possibly it does not to-day ! That may be why the Princess now lives mostly in Bavaria and in France. Perhaps it may be permissible to interject here a word of explanation about my own modest share in this volume. The business of an Editor is, in my view, to interfere as little as possible with the author whom he is introducing. It is a natural, and on the whole an engaging, weakness for a new writer to desire to enter the arena of authorship hand in hand with a friend, however humble ; we are all inclined to be apprehensive of the freemasonry of a craft, or of a section of society, of which we are ignorant. Therefore — although assuredly she needs no introduction — I obeyed the Princess's commands and accepted the privilege of putting my name on her title-page. In the matter or footnotes I found difficulties ; in a book of this kind they are at best a tiresome necessity ; yet, a new generation of readers is growing up, people's memories are short ; therefore a number of reminders could not be avoided. As far as possible I have con- fined myself to making clearer such points as might be obscure and to making such transpositions or cor- rections in the text as were obviously needed. Except where they bear the initials of the authoress, all foot- notes may be accepted as mine. A few words seem desirable about the extracts which the Princess has chosen from her diaries. Omission marks signify either redundancies or pas- sages at present unsuitable for publication. The industry of the Princess was extraordinary and one keeps wondering how she found time to do half of what *she accomplished. She kept her diary regularly and with considerable fullness practically all her life. !8 INTRODUCTION It is in several fat volumes and I have calculated that it contains more than half a million words — that is to say, nearly half as many words as Stevenson used in writing twelve novels ! If the Princess's book is an intimate picture of her own time, it is also a record of the deepest human interest: showing frankly and faithfully a woman's heart ; her triumphs, passions, mistakes and failures. It tells how she surmounted great and seemingly unending difficulties and disappointments, and how, in the end, she won great content. She has had everything the world can give. On her wedding day, she became entitled to wear, amongst many jewels, the world-famous rope of Pless pearls, seven yards long, the mere thought of which might perhaps be sufficient to test the composure of any very young girl. She enjoyed all the advantages of princely rank without its more tiresome isolations and restrictions : She had command of wealth beyond belief. These things are now of the past, and in her record the Princess shows plainly that the gifts with which you are endowed at birth, such as health, a sense of humour, the capacity to win and keep love and friend- ship, a deep and quenchless love for nature, flowers, animals, travel, books, and the possession of congenial friends, surroundings and occupations, are in truth the only enduring sources of human peace and happi- ness : to these the Princess would assuredly add the doing of some regular work for the public weaL And if, in addition, you give to the world three stalwart sons, as the Princess has done, you are, I venture to think, amply entitled to look back on the past without any cankering regrets, and to face the future with a smile.

What shall we take ? A violin, Poems in plenty, a coin or so, And a leather purse to hold them in. Down the highway and up the street, And the whole will make a beautiful song : Oh ! the merry heart, and the heart's wild beat, And the mirth in the eyes that have wept too long ! And now all tunes that ever you play, And the wild things said by your fiddle-strings, Are perfectly sure to come true some day ; And you and I will be Queens and Kings. LADY MARGARET SACKVILLE. I THINK these lines . by my cousin Margaret Sackville express better than any others I have ever read a child's ideas about life. \" Growing up \" is to be just the opening of magic doors ; the begin- nings of many wonderful and endless journeys ; the music of laughter, dance and song* We are to meet none but chivalrous knights and peerless ladies and all whom we love are to become queens and kings : perhaps in a way all these things do happen to us ; but not quite as we imagined in childhood. My mother, Mrs. Cornwallis-West, was one of the loveliest women of her time and thought both her daughters .plain: compared with her I dare say we were. My governesses and nurses were always telling me how ugly I was ; that my ears were top small, my mouth too big and my nose turned up. To remedy this they were continually pulling my ears to make them bigger and tweaking my nose to make it 29 30 MY FAVOURITE ANCESTOR aquiline. This made me suspect that beauty was probably a curse, and I do not find that time has greatly modified that babyish impression. These remarks about my looks are the only shadows I can remember during a radiant childhood. No one could have had a happier, freer, more joyous youth than my brother George, my sister Shelagh and I had at romantic Ruthin Castle in North Wales, and exquisite, beloved Newlands in Hampshire — but, mine at least, contained some horrible moments. I did not like being told that I was ugly ; no one does, not boys — or even men, as I found out later. But perhaps I had better say just a word or two to explain who we were. I will not go much into the tiresome ancestry business, which anyway I could never properly understand. This was at bad handicap later when I became a German Princess ind had to remember exactly how every member of the twenty odd German Reigning Houses was related, and how they all went in to dinner. Besides, Major Chapman-Huston, in his introduction, has explained as much as is necessary. We thought it best to put it there because no one ever reads introductions, although I feel quite sure this one is beautifully written. The only ancestor in whom as a child I took much personal interest was Thomas the second Baron West, who at Crecy is said to have picked up the French* King's crown and handed it to the Black Prince with the courtly remark, Jour de ma Vie, which remains the family motto to this day. I am told all authors are vain ; it may be so, but I am not a trained writer ; I received no education in the proper sense of the word, and have not the art to choose words that read nicely together. The critics, therefore, may not like my style, though I do most eagerly hope that they and every one who reads this book will like me and be indulgent to my literary — and all my other — shortcomings, and re- member that so far as the extracts from my diaries are concerned, they were nearly always hurriedly written, and frequently in railway trains or under MY SISTER AND BROTHER 31 similar uncomfortable conditions, especially during the War. George, my only brother, is Major George Frederick Myddelton Cornwallis-West, and is known to the family as Buzzie. I was baptized Mary Theresa Olivia, but every one calls me Daisy or, in the intimacy of the family circle, Dany : it was my own name for myself before I could speak properly, and my dearest loved ones always use it. My sister's name is Constance Edwina, and her pet name is Shelagh or Biddy. My father we called Poppets or anything else that came into our heads ; my mother we treated like a sister, and shocked all our Victorian relations — of which we had an extraordinary number — by calling her Patsy. Poppets had his own private \" little name, \" for her, which was Mussie. I understand that in 'these days most children call their parents by their Christian names. I see nothing wrong in this, although I must confess to having been mystified by two mites, both of whom were less than five years old, always talking of \" Jane and James.\" These I imagined to be dolls, ponies or dogs, until one day to my astonishment I learned they were their parents ! As we are making \" personal remarks \" in a manner that would also have upset the Victorians, I may as well add that my brother George was endowed with his full share of the family good looks, and that women have never been shy of showing that they thought so. Shelagh I have always considered to be much hand- somer than I am. She has the loveliest large, deep, dark, mysterious eyes, my mother's chestnut hair — now turning a most becoming grey — a marvellous figure, and the West complexion, which is undeniably lovely. Blue eyes and quantities of golden hair gained for me the name of being a \" typical English beauty,\" an early label which I have never succeeded in living down ! I am as tall as Shelagh and, although I was a better dancer, I could not ride or skate nearly so well. I love horses and riding, but Shelagh is a magnificent horsewoman. She is cleverer than I am, 32 THE \"WILD WEST SHOW\" an excellent organizer and an able business woman. We could both run a large establishment, or indeed any number of them ; although I think Shelagh enjoyed doing so more than I did. It fell to both our lots to entertain on a vast scale, she at Grosvenor House, and at Eaton, where her house-parties for polo and racing were famous, and I at Pless and Furstenstein. Perhaps Shelagh does not get on with people at first quite so easily as I do, as her stronger will and deeper nature are not for the shallow. I am impres- sionable, shy and apt to become unduly excited ; Shelagh has great poise and self-control. Yet we both inherited a generous share of Irish- Welsh temperament and, while we may outwardly appear quite cool, often seethe within : we are both, I should say, mettlesome and difficult to handle. I am at times too fond of my own way and do not always foresee that to gain it one must sometimes have to pay a foolish price. I need say no more here about Patsy, Poppets, Shelagh, George or myself, because the reader will ft to know all about us as we go along. This will, hope, prove interesting, because, although much could be said for and against us as a family, at least no one could say we were dull or ordinary. Indeed the chief accusation against us was that we were too lively. King Edward, who loved us all, christened us the \" Wild West Show \" and once sent a telegram addressed to \" the Wild West Show, New Forest/' which safely reached us. On another occasion he addressed one to \" the Queen of Ireland, Hampshire,\" which was duly handed to my mother. We were always jolly and happy and, looking back now, I thank God for every blessed iroment of that glad joyousness and laughter. The sundering years of tragedy and sorrow only make those far-off days the more precious ; and I always cherish the memory of my mother and father as bubbling over with lattghter and pray that, wherever they are, they are laughing RUTHIN CASTLE 33 now- Because of our own feelings of loss and desola- tion we always associate the next life with pain and gloom. But, whatever it is, it is not that : either we are just asleep, or we are full of a serene and quiet joy. It would be merely silly to pretend that, as I grew up, I did not realize that I had inherited good looks from my parents. It could not well be otherwise ; my father was a splendid-looking man and, as I got older, people took good care not to leave me in doubt as to what they thought about my appearance. Shelagh being dark and I fair, there could never be any ques- tion of jealousy or rivalry between us. Ruthin, which is in the very north of Wales in the beautiful Vale of Clwyd, is a real castle or fortress, not as in Germany, where every building with a roof that is not obviously a farm-house is called a Schloss. It dates from 1400, and was a place of defence against the Scots when they descended upon Wales. Si my childish ideas of early English history were associated with the Scots, who always seemed to be \" descending \" upon somebody or something. In those days they occasionally returned home with their spoils ; now they always remain and consume them in sight of their defenceless victims. Of course Ruthin had to have a moat round it to protect it against the Scottish invaders. How we loved playing hide-and-seek in the dungeons and the old ruins, which seemed as if designed by a fairy king for our playground ; indeed, to a child, the very word moat is filled with glamour and magic. My father had a shooting-box called Llanarmon on his Llanarmon Dyffryn Estate up in the mountains, and when he went there I felt he was as far away as if he were at the North Pole. I copy an early undated letter I sent to him while he was there. I think it must have been written in 1880 when he was con- testing West Cheshire. It is evident that I was learn- ing French at the time, because the letter reads like a translation and I use the English equivalents for phrases such as won vieux and ta petite : 34 OUR LOVELY MOTHER RUTHIN CASTLE, NORTH WALES. MY DEAR OLD POPPETS — I am thinking how dreadful it must be in the wild mountains among the Welsh people and I think I must write you a little note to comfort you. I am taught that there are no roses without thorns, but I am sure the thorns for getting into Par- liament are very prickly. ... It is very hot to-day at Ruthin. . Take care of your little self, dear old Dads, and come home soon to your little chickens who send you a lot of big kisses and hugs. Your loving little daughter, DAISY. My father did not get into Parliament then, but in 1885 he was elected member for the Western Division of Denbighshire, which he represented until 1892, first as a Liberal Unionist and later as a Conservative ; he and Mr. Gladstone having parted company on the Home Rule question. My mother, as I have said, was a most beautiful woman, twenty years younger than my father and with a vitality that death itself could scarcely draw into its arms. She could not be bothered with young children and nurseries, but wanted to live her own free, vital existence. Consequently we were left a great deal to ourselves and to governesses. If I worshipped from a distance my lovely mother, I adored my father, who was not only the finest specimen of the older type of English gentleman, but a real friend and comrade to his children. In due time we got a \" finishing \" governess called Miss Clark or some such name. I think the name \" finishing governess \" is most sad, as it means finishing off the dreams of girlhood. Miss Clark used to put cherry tooth-paste on her face and black cork on her eyebrows and wear gold buttons all down the bodice of her frock. I remember she tried to teach me good English, but never succeeded* Yet, as I have said, we had great compensations. Games and sports delighted us. One favourite game was circuses. We had an old horse called Jimmy Jones, which we tried to ride standing on its back. MY TOMBOY TRAITS 35 We found this did not answer, because as soon as Jimmy Jones moved on we moved off ! We liked George to be the clown, but this always displeased him as he wanted to be the circus master and crack a whip. Then Shelagh thought of another idea. She somehow fastened Jimmy Jones to a wooden box in which I was to sit like a lady reading The Bride of Lammermoor. All my life long people have always insisted on my being a lady, and I have never really wanted to be anything but a tomboy. Sometimes the cord broke as we galloped (if any action of Jimmy Jones's deserves that name) up and down the avenue. Shelagh said I must not be frightened or hurt, keep my skirt over my legs and pay no attention to the sand and pebbles which used to get into the box. I remember to this day how difficult I found it to combine being romantic like the Bride of Lammermoor and dignified and ladylike (with my legs covered), while my knees were dirty and bleeding from being repeatedly thrown on the gravel. II My great-grandfather West was the third son of John eighth Baron West and second Earl de la Warr. I never saw him, as he died many years before I was born. Known' in the family as \" the Honourable Frederick \" he had great interest for us because of his two very prudent and, I hope, happy marriages. He specialized in heiresses and married first, in 1792, Charlotte, daughter of Richard Mitchell, of Culham Court, in Berkshire. This lady obligingly died three years later, leaving him all her belongings and one small daughter. Losing no time, he, as the news- papers say, \" led to the altar \" three years later Maria, only daughter of Richard Myddleton, of Chirk Castle, in Denbighshire, by whom he had an only surviving son, who became my grandfather. The story goes that when \" the Honourable Fred- erick \" died in 1852 his daughter and her stepbrother 36 NEWLANDS MANOR drew lots as to which should have Chirk and which Ruthin, and grandfather drew Ruthin. Be that as it may, father duly inherited the Castle and estate, and I am glad he did. My grandfather also inherited from \" the Honour- able Frederick \" the agreeable knack of falling in love with heiresses, a habit which in our family seems, in the old phrase of the Heralds, to have fallen into abeyance. His first wife was Lady Georgiana, daughter of the fifth Earl of Chesterfield. She lived only a few years and they had no children, but the marriage connected our family with the Stanhopes, many of whom were famous and nearly all of whom are delightful. Grandfather's second wife was Theresa, only daughter of Captain John Whitby, R.N., who was the friend of Nelson and Cornwallis. About 1805 Admiral Sir William Cornwallis, that very gallant sailor brother of the Marquess Cornwallis who was Viceroy of Ireland in 1801 at the time of the Union, having by his fearless seamanship compelled Napoleon I to abandon his idea of invading England, decided to retire. Of course he wanted to live within sight of the English Channel which he had long defended with such courage and sagacity. He found an old house on the spot on which Newlands now stands. Hardly a mile from the seashore and exactly opposite the Needles, it commands lovely views of the Channel and the Isle of Wight, standing high over the intervening waters of the Solent. The old farm- house was burned down one Sunday morning and the Admiral built the Newlands we know and love. It is in the rather bad \" Strawberry Hill \" Gothic style then so fashionable, with turrets, battlements and semi-pointed windows, the glass of which is cut into fascinating little panes. Time, however, and the velvety sea-drenched air of South Hampshire, have combined to make the place lovely. The house is covered with all sorts of coloured creeping things, and Patsy, who adored gardens, and was no mean gardener, had made it a blaze of azaleas, rare rhododendrons, hydrangeas ADMIRAL CORNWALLIS 37 and other gay, singing shrubs which thrive there quite as well as they do on the Riviera : cosy nooks, her- baceous borders, brick (lovely warm old red brick) pergolas, water gardens, heather, and many wild ana careless patches here and there, delighted her. Under her care it became a perfect English garden. Patsy, like me, loved adventure, travel and change and yet, like me, always remained absurdly and unchangeably English. Wherever I have lived I have always tried to make an English garden. I have one now at La Napoule, and I am making one at Munich. Captain JohnWhitby was Admiral Cornwallis 's Flag Captain and dearest friend. After they had both retired from the Navy, Whitby married Theresa Symonds, a remarkable member of a remarkable family. They had one little girl, who was baptized Theresa Cornwallis. When she was about a year old her father died. From that moment Admiral Cornwallis constituted himself the guardian of the widow and only child of Ins dead friend. In due course he made his will, leaving almost everything he had in trust for Theresa Cornwallis Whitby and her descendants. Later she married grandfather and had two sons, one of whom became my father. I love to think of the romantic friendship of the old Admiral for the widow and child of his dearest friend and the happy result it had on all our lives. All my own recollections of Newlands are associated with the enchanting music of woods and the sea. With Newlands my grandmother brought into our family the pompous name of Theresa, which I have never liked and which is the only legacy I personally received from the Whitby family. I need say no more here of how we came to inherit the family name of Cornwallis ; my brother has given a very full and interesting account of it all in his new book * where anyone who cares to do so can read more about it. 1 Life and Letters of Admiral Corrwoattis, by Major G. Cornwallis- West. Holden. 1928. 38 LADY OLIVIA FITZPATRICK My father adored every old stone in Ruthin, and knew and loved every tree in the woods and parks at Ruthin and Newlands. He did not share my mother's love of society and was more than contented with his painting, music and the life and duties of an English country gentleman. For forty-five years he was Lord- Lieutenant of Denbighshire and for many years a Mem- ber of Parliament, and always devoted himself faithfully to discharging his public and private responsibilities. I loved Ruthin and Newlands as much as my father did, and would have made any sacrifice to keep them in the family. To me all other places have been but houses ; Ruthin and Newlands were homes. I would not have exchanged them for those two great pos- sessions of other branches of the family, splendid Buckhurst and incomparable Knole. And now I must say something about the relatives I most associate with my girlhood. Patsy's mother, Lady Olivia FitzPatrick, was born a Taylour, being Olivia, a daughter of the second Marquess of Headfort, who was for many years Lord Chamberlain to Queen Victoria. I do not think I ever saw him, although I remember his eldest son, Uncle Headfort, the third Marquess, quite well because he had a crooked foot which was a great source of interest and curiosity to us children. He was an old dear, or seemed to us very old, and used to bring us sweets, pat our heads and pet us — a thing dogs, horses and children love. Granny Olivia, I have been told, was most lovely as a young woman ; indeed, she remained handsome and distinguished-looking to the end of her days. Her husband, the Reverend Frederick FitePatrick, was a Church of Ireland clergyman and was for some years Rector of Cloone in County Leitrim ; but, as they say abroad, \" that did not go,\" and eventually he gave it up and bought Warren Hall, in Cheshire, where he could hunt to his heart's content. The Irish are not, or perhaps I should say were not in those days, squeamish about the social proclivities of their clerev but I have been told it did offend some of the more FAMILY FRIENDS 39 English-minded of his parishioners to see grandfather FitzPatrick take the early Communion Service with a surplice over his hunting boots and rush through it because the Meet was a distant one. Nor can I imagine Granny Olivia ever contenting herself with life in an Irish country house. Grandfather bought and lived in Cloone Grange, a place of some pretensions, where he kept up much greater state than was con- sidered fitting for a clergyman. His curates, who I am afraid did all the work, lived in Cloone Rectory. Prominent amongst other visitors whom I remember at Ruthin or Newlands was dear Alice Bective. A daughter of the fourth Marquess of Downshire, she married my cousin Lord Bective, eldest son of the third Marquess of Headfort, who, however, died in 1893 without succeeding. She was my mother's friend. Alas ! even as I correct these lines I see that this sweet, gracious, lovable woman has passed away at the age of eighty-six. She had only one child, a girl called Olivia, who has inherited all her mother's goodness and fragrant charm, and who married Lord Henry Bentinck in 1892. Another visitor was Lily Pocklington, who was beautiful, unlucky in marriage and finance, and who was, I think, the first woman in Society to start a bonnet shop. I fear it was not a ^reat success, although patronized by Princess Christian and other Royalties. Rumour had it that many of Mrs. Pock- lington's friends were readier at buying than at paying. Colonel Austin Mackenzie and his wife used to come frequently, and he would thrill me by telling me shivery ghost stories. The lovely Mrs. Wheeler was another radiant figure that flitted across the scenes of my girlhood. In her day she was a famous beauty and, with Mrs. Langtry, existed in the blaze of pufy- licity, then so novel, but to-day so commonplace in the experience of all those who by chance, guile, notoriety, or sometimes even merit, succeed for a few brief hours in catching public interest. As I grew older I was taken periodically to London 40 THE PRINCE OF WALES (KING EDWARD VII.) where we had a town house, 49 Eaton Place- Even there I can have seen but little of the great world of London, because the house is chiefly associated in my memory with father's studio where he carried on the painting he so much loved and to which he devoted a great deal of time ; those who ought to know said his work had considerable merit : some of it hangs on my walls now. Of course all kinds of people used to come to see us, and the two who stand out most vividly are King Edward VII. and Lord Charles Beresford. King Edward was, of course, still Prince of Wales ; he was very kind, but sometimes his visits were an awful bore, because it meant being hurried into our best clothes and having our hair re-done, and all at express speed as the Prince hated to be kept waiting. I remember one such occasion when we were lying down resting after lunch — I was about ten, and my sister seven — he called on my mother and asked to see the children. We had to be got up and have our hair done all over again, and came downstairs feeling rather cross. The Prince asked us all kinds of questions, laughing all the time : why, we did not know. But anyhow, we did not laugh. Then he put his hand in Ins pocket and produced two little brooches like ladybirds — those little red insects with black spots which are supposed to bring you so much luck. We accepted them with some awe but were secretly very pleased, and felt it was really a compensation for having hurriedly to get up and listen to the nurse's grumbles. Lord Charles Beresford we used to meet at Ports- mouth. We were very proud of knowing him, but we had to pay for it as his visit always meant that our hair was put into curl papers the night before, and these were twisted so tightly that they hurt. But our hair looked beautiful th6 next day ! Then, too, we were usually dressed in clean sailor frocks which came back from the wash with all the hooks bent in, to the great annoyance of our nurse, and which some* times had shrunk so much that though I was a slender MR. GLADSTONE MY FIRST LOVE 41 child the waistband used to cut into my flesh, and I could scarcely eat anything, // faut souffrir pour $tre belle, of course, but it was an early beginning, and I remember one luncheon which was a torment to me because I wanted more mutton cutlet than my waist allowed, and was agonized by this disappointment and the fear of forgetting to say grace after lunch. The seventh Lord and Lady de la Warr used to come often. He was cheery, good-looking and very nice. His widow, Constance, is a writer of distinction and her daughter, Margaret Sackville, whose little fairy verses I quote at the beginning of this chapter, a poet of great and acknowledged merit. Nor would I forget the visits to Newlands and Ruthin of cousin Adelaide Taylour. A daughter of the third Lord Headfort, she is a gracious, chaining and faithful figure, still visiting me every year at La Napoule. Mr. Gladstone was a great friend and admirer of my mother, whom he loved hearing sing The Wearin* o* the Green as only she could sing it. We went quite often to Hawarden Castle, and I can quite truthfully say that Mr. Gladstone was my first love. Somehow he never struck me as old and both he and Mrs. Gladstone were perfectly delightful to children. One day after shamelessly flirting with the old gentleman I boldly asked for their photograph, which was at once given to me. They both signed it ; I have it to this day, and love to look at the two kindly venerable figures seated side by side. Though only a photograph, it has something of the pathos of that most tender and appealing of all masterpieces — Whistler's portrait of his Mother. When I was about sixteen or so, Patsy, Poppets, Shelagh and I went to Florence. Shelagh and I were to learn Italian and singing. Pawskie, our governess, was there to chaperon us, while Patsy arid Poppets visited galleries and churches and Poppets amused himself by making excellent copies of the masterpieces he particularly liked in the Uffizi and elsewhere. Dear old Bolton (who was then quite young and my 42 I DECIDE TO BECOME A PRIMA DONNA father's valet) carried the easels and paint brushes to and fro : I cannot honestly say that the experience aroused in him any marked devotion to Italian art* Like Sir Frederick Ponsonby, Poppets could copy an Old Master so faithfully and well that only an expert could tell it was not an original. My voice was tried by Vanuchini, Director of the Opera and then famous in Florence. He taught me himself and laid the foundations of all I ever knew about singing. He was enthusiastic about the pos- sibilities of my voice and told my father he would train me for nothing if I would promise to learn Italian and French thoroughly and adopt singing as a career. Of course I was enchanted ; I was born with a love of singing and acting, and my quaint and enthusiastic teacher was quite certain, after the fashion of those days, that he could make my mezzo-soprano into a pure, fine soprano. I saw nothing but rapture ahead, and was intoxicated with visions of myself as Elsa, Elizabeth, Margtierita, or one of a score of other lovely and unlucky heroines. I was not quite sure whether I wanted most to be fair, frail and consump- tive (but enduring), or dark, passionate and mysterious like Delildhy and, in my more confident moments, I felt quite sure that I could interpret either type of r61e to the acclamations of an astonished and ravished world. Women are often accused of foolish economies, and I dare say they indulge in them almost as frequently as men. We spent the winter at an hotel, the name of which I have quite forgotten. I realized that our stay in Italy was a considerable expense to my father, and that it was really made for my sake, because Shelagh was too young to derive much benefit from it. In a spirit or unselfishness I secretly decided to help to \" keep down the bills \" by drinking plain instead of bottled water. Sanitation in Italy in those days was even worse than it is now, and the result was a severe attack of typhoid fever. As soon as it could possibly be managed I was taken home to England MYSELF. •Aged about Fourteen. FIRST LOVE 43 for my convalescence — all my hopes of a career on the operatic stage drowned in a glass of water ! From that time onward my life was spent mostly at Ruthin or Newlands. Between lessons were allur- ing excitements such as visits from people famous in the great outside world. The War seems to have set one's childhood back to a hundred years ago. Could there ever have been a time when every one seemed gay, happy, contented and reasonably well off ! People loved coming to Ruthin and Newlands. A warm welcome and an appreciative audience awaited all who had personality or distinction ; wit, gaiety, light-heartedness and good comradeship counted with us far more than long purses or long pedigrees. Ill I remember so well a man who used to come to Ruthin to see my mother. Her beauty, lively and audacious wit, and unquenchable charm gained her innumerable devoted admirers, many of whom were indeed almost her slaves. This particular man was gallant and kind and sang beautifully. I think it was he who first aroused in my heart — not love — but the thought of love. The sort of secret ecstasy a young girl so often experiences just before she falls in love with love. During this period she will do many foolish and impulsive things, but seldom, indeed almost never, wrong ones, because she has no desire for or understanding of reality : she is unawakened. Happy the girl and happy her husband if he is the first to open her eyes to the real meaning of life and love and to do it with gentle understanding and tenderness. I remember thinking how nice it would be to be loved by such a big, strong, gentle man. One day I was sitting out in the sun beside him when my mother called. He picked me up, chair and all, and carried me to her. Another day while he was there she and I started playing hide-and-seek. We hid in an angle of the old castle walls and made bogy noises. He 44 MY FIRST ROMANCE found us and caught my hand and drew me to him. Later I often recalled what was probably to him nothing more than a childish romp, and wondered why he had ever let me go. On one of my birthdays he gave me a moonstone heart with little diamonds round it and suspended from a slender gold chain. One of the bitterest memories of my youth was, before my engagement, obeying my mother's order to give it back to him. I could not bear the thought of doing so myself, but took it in tears to the dear old family butler, who gave it to him for me. In those early days I do not think he loved me ; perhaps he never really did so in the full sense of the word. Yet, during my first and only season in London, I met him often. I knew he had no money and that I should never be allowed to see him, much less to marry him, and told him so. He replied that he did not care a hang : \" You are out now, and free to makp your own choice, and I shall see you whenever I cab/' Btave, futile words : defiant, foolish words of youth that make the heart beat high, even now long years after. Once again, after my marriage, I met him in a restaurant. He asked : \" When may I come and see you, Princess ? \" I turned to him a haughty little face : \" I am sorry, but I am staying at an hotel and never know when I shall be at home.\" Poor trite little social excuse under which to bury my first romance. I never saw him again ; he died in South Africa not very long after. IV When my mother married she was only sixteen and a half : her three children were born before she was twenty-one. It therefore seemed to her very natural that her daughters should marry young ; she was too much accustomed to homage and admiration to want PATSY'S IRRESISTIBLE CHARM 45 them clinging to her skirts. Her beauty was of the brilliant, brunette type, and she had the loveliest teeth and smile and a perfect figure. My father simply worshipped her and let her do exactly what she liked — perhaps too much so : he was intensely proud of her and in his eyes she could do no wrong. As for her beauty and the interest it aroused, one can hardly realize it nowadays. The 'eighties and 'nineties origin- ated the rather vulgar term, Professional Beauties, amongst whom my mother was numbered. There was a photograph taken of her wearing an ermine coat and muff sitting on an artificial rock during an artificial snowstorm, which sold by the million. That her loveliness was of the first order is proved by the fact that amongst her peers were such universally acknow- ledged beauties as the Duchess of Leinster and her sister Lady Helen Vincent (Viscountess d'Abernon), Th&r&se Lady Londonderry, Georgiana Lady Dudley, Lady de Bathe (Mrs. Langtry), .Mrs. Wheeler and several others. My mother talked well, had a brilliant rather than a profound mind, a great sense of humour, overflowing vitality, and she had a fine voice and her passionate singing of The Wearin* o' the Green would have aroused a revolutionary outburst in Ireland any day. Both she and Granny Olivia had an enchanting little Irish brogue. It is no exaggeration to say that Patsy had the reputa- tion of being the fairest woman in the three kingdoms. Abraham Hayward, a writer famous in his day and now almost forgotten, wrote a long poem in her honour, the last verse of which ran : For though envy itself should disarm, And in praise of thy beauty agree, On none will thy fulness oft charm Ever flash as it flashed upon me. Hayward, who was himself a brilliant talker, could appreciate my mother's wit, her resilient personality, her mind like flashing quicksilver, and his approval was powerful enough to place any woman of fashion 46 I MEET MY FUTURE HUSBAND far above her contemporaries. The unusual thing about Patsy's fascination was that it never faded. To the end of her life men, and women also, would do anything for her. All this being so, it was decided that I should come out early. I was never told that I must marry rank and money, but I think it must always have been an understood thing that I should do so because, for our position and the scale on which we lived, we were poor. When I was duly Presented to Queen Victoria I wore, for the first time, a long dress, an enormously long train and three white plumes in my hair. I tried to look nice, but simply felt what a little donkey I was. Of course I at once began going to dances, and one in particular I remember. I wore on my head, in the rather silly fashion of those days, a wreath of corn with poppies and cornflowers in it. I must confess I thought it rather fine and my chagrin can be imagined when a nice man came up to me and said : V What on earth made you put that silly wreath on ? You look like a harvest festival.1' I could not take it off there and only felt embarrassed, shy and afraid to dance. My evening was quite spoiled. People, even very kind people, seldom realize how easily girls, and boys too, are hurt. I first met my future husband, Prince Henry of Pless, at a ball. Although in the German Diplomatic Corps and recently appointed a Secretary of the German Embassy in London, he did not at that time speak perfect English. I was shy and hardly understood a word he said, and a stup* i Httle Peer who was there and who wanted to marry me, began to giggle. He is alive still and I hope he reads this and will realize how cross he made me. Although only a girl, I felt he was being very rude to a foreigner, and I did not like it. Far from furthering his cause it only made me sorry HE PROPOSES 47 for Prince Henry and inclined to be kinder to him than I might otherwise have been. We had a neighbour, a very charming Peer, owner of a fine property, whom it was thought I might marry, and whom I think I could easily have loved. Un- fortunately he was at the time blatantly in love with a married woman. I remember the very morning after my husband proposed to me we were riding in the Row when this very dear man galloped up on a big chestnut horse and asked a question which gave no happiness. Some years later he married and had children, but after a time he and his wife separated and he is now dead. What a queer mixed-up affair is life ! However, I am happy to say that I kept his chivalrous friendship to the very end : like so many of us, he just missed his way. My husband proposed to me at a masked ball at Holland House. I did not know what on earth to say or do. I realized that my mother was ambitious and desired the match. In those absurd days it was a big feather in a mother's cap if she could marry a daughter off during her first season. \"Marry her off \" — an odious phrase. I told Hans I did not love him. He said that did not matter ; love came after marriage. Perhaps it does sometimes, but I fear not often. Jn Germany every bride, whatever her rank, provides furniture, linen, trousseau — everything. Often she provides the house as well. In France the custom is similar although perhaps not quite so general, I could provide nothing ; and my family could not even give me my trousseau on a fitting scale. Prince Henry, knowing all this, dazzled me with descriptions of life in Silesia. I was to have hunters, jewels, castles, two Jadies-in-waiting, visit England every year, and good- ness knows \\yhat. It all sounded splendid and romantic. I did not realize it clearly at the time, but I was just being bought. Yet, after all these years, I must be perfectly fair to my husband. He did not, and never could, see it from my point of view. Instead 48 MY WEDDING DAY of a wife who would add to the riches of his family, he was marrying someone without a penny. Braving the age-old customs of his own country, he was prepared to do all himself, even to paying for the trousseau ! Nothing could have exceeded the generosity with which he treated my family right up to the end of the War and even after it. Again and again he came to the help of one member or another. These things must not be forgotten. Even now when his revenues are much diminished by the cruel post-war taxation in Germany and by the confiscatory policy of the present Polish Government, he lets me want for nothing in reason. But I am wandering and anticipating — as I fear a woman will. For breakfast on my wedding morning I had sausages and bacon and wondered if they had anything so nice in Germany, or only porridge. The wedding reception was given by Princess Alexis Dolgorouky at her house in Portman Square. Born a Fleetwood Wilson, she was a great friend of my mother's. The house was of course upside down, so I went out early and walked in the garden in the centre of the Square. I put on my oldest shoes, a funny little old turban hat ana soiled gloves. I had only an allowance of twelve pounds a year for shoes and gloves and had learned to be careful. I remember rather wishing that Hans could, see me looking such a fright, not want to marry me and go back to Germany without me. The marriage took place at St. Margaret's, West- minster, but I was far too excited to remember much about the ceremony, except that I had to wear a diamond coronet which my fathet-in-law had given me as a wedding present. Amongst my new titles I was a Countess of the Holy Roman Empire, and the crown was a copy of the one worn in the old days by ladies of that rank : I have it still. Of course the Prince and Princess of Wales were there and signed the register. My father, who looked so proud and hand- some, gave me away. I remember wondering how little Shelagh was getting on in her first half-long frock PLESS ORIGINALLY POLISH 49 — and they really were long in those days — because, after all, she was only a child, being three years younger than me. I do not remember much else about the service except that, as I left the church, the dear English crowd with its unique mixture of Cockney wit and sentiment — bless it — called out, \" God Pless you/' At the reception I was rather pleased when the servants addressed me as \" Your Highness.\" What I do remember, and with real regret, is that I never properly carried out dear King Edward's friendly parting advice to learn. German and become a good subject of my adopted country ; I became, I hope, a good and loyal subject, but I never succeeded in thoroughly learning the language. Gossip had it that my husband, who did not want to marry a German, got sent to London with the daring hope of trying to marry the fair young English Princess who is now Queen of England. It was said that the Duke and Duchess of Teck were not unfavourably disposed to the idea, which may have been true, as the Duke, who was the son of a Prince of Wiirttem- berg, was far from well off. The Hochbergs have frequently married Royalties ; indeed Pless came to them through the marriage of the then head of the family with the last princess of one of the old Polish reigning houses x — a fact which, oddly enough, became for a time of considerable political importance during the Great War : moreover, in olden times the family has given kings to Hungary and Bohemia. However, Hans met me, and never hesitated a moment. Admittedly he loved me. I suppose I should have felt flattered at being chosen, because my husband's position and great wealth were considered as entitling him to aspire to a bride in the highest quarters. But in those days I attached little im- portance to such considerations, and I do still less in these. When \\ye married, my husband gave up diplomacy, telling me that the German Foreign Minister of that 1 See pages 10 and m. D 50 MY IGNORANCE OF LIFE day refused to allow junior diplomatists to marry. Even then I thought this such nonsense, because the one thing they want is a charming and agreeable wife who is sufficiently intelligent to keep her ears open and her mouth closed when serious matters are being discussed. The decision was unfortunate in another way. It deprived my husband of a regular occupation during my father-in-law's lifetime, and me of a life the variety and interest of which would perhaps have done something to make up for the absence of that deep and lasting love and respect without which no marriage (however suitable otherwise) can be a real success. We went to Paris for our honeymoon as my husband had served there and in Brussels before being trans- ferred to the German Embassy in London and therefore knew the Continent well, I began my married life totally unprepared for any of its experiences, duties or responsibilities. Literally I knew nothing. A short time before I had overheard my mother telling a woman friend that \" So-and-so was in love with Daisy.\" 1 kept pondering what \" being in love \" meant. My experience was by no means an unusual one. Many girls of my period went through as bad or worse. But the convention ordaining such things was horrible and cruel . My parents, with hearts full of tender love, did nothing whatever to prepare me for life and its ordeals. I suppose I knew something, but only in a vague furtive way. I had no fixed principle ; no clear guiding thought. Without a rudder or chart, I was at the mercy of any wind that blew close enough to reach me. Either of my parents would have done anything in the world for me — except tell me the truth. I ascribe many of the errors and misfortunes of my life to the fact that I not only married a man who was a stranger to me, but that I had no idea of how even to begin to get to know, much less to guide and influence, him. Women, at any rate, will understand how utterly BAD OMEN 51 without knowledge of any kind I was ; how scamped and short had been my social training, when I say that I did not even know how my smart French going-away frock should be worn. I put it on back to front. My husband, who has the keenest eye for women's clothes, was half-amused and half-cross when he saw it. He scolded me. It had to be hurriedly changed, and I drove away for my honeymoon consumed with grief, humiliation and dread of the unknown. CHAPTER TWO 1892-1900 \\\\ 7^^ * arrived in Pless I found a great white \\/\\l palace built on the site of an older one by * * my father-in-law about 1870. It is very French, as are most large German houses of that period, and was full of rather bad, heavy, over-gilded furniture, which was also supposed to be French and which was nothing but ugly German. There were acres of terraces and gardens and much indifferent statuary, A great deal of state and heavy luxury, no comfort or convenience, and not a single bathroom! My husband had made for me an ornate one of gold mosaic, now in Fiirstenstein, rather horrid, but much better than none, For my reception all the retainers and servants were assembled in their best uniforms and liveries. Both at Pless and Fiirstenstein the organization of the house- hold was on strictly military lines, and every servant had to do daily drill. The women servants were all dressed alike in native Silesian costume carried out in the livery colours of dark crimson and silver. The magnificent staircase was lined with masses of men wearing blue coats with white gaiters and gloves, a uniform which I thought horrid. Their numbers puzzled and frightened me : the only thing I liked was the maid-servants in their short crimson dresses, white aprons, fichus and stockings, and caps of white cambric, and their hair in plaits down their backs— they looked too amusing. I soon found the etiquette was unbelievably boring, I knew no German and could not make my wishes known. When I wanted to leave one room for another 52 MY SPLENDID FATHER-IN-LAW 53 a bell was rung, a servant opened the door and a footman walked in front of me to wherever I wished to go. And all I wanted to do was fx> steal quietly away with a tight throat, or perhaps wait for the English post. One of the first things I did was to learn enough German to tell them that this ceremony was no longer necessary and that I could open doors, and liked to go to bed by myself. This my husband disapproved of and, all our lives together, we had constant misunder- standings about what he called interfering with the servants. Even during the War, when all the younger men-servants were in the Army, he was cross because I told his valet to turn on the heating instead of summoning the particular persons without whose im- mediate help one had to go on being either asphyxiated or frozen ! Hans comes of a nation which attaches absurd importance to trifles. However, my unfailing consolation was my father-in- law, Hans Heinrich XL The family all called him Vater and I did the same. Like my own father, he was a very great gentleman. He gave me the warmest of welcomes and was ever my dear and faithful friend and protector. He understood me, I think. Above all, he believed in me. When any of my new, frighten- ing German relations were severe with me, he would say : \" Leave the child alone ; she will come in front of you all in time.\" This gave me courage and I did my utmost to please him by being tactful and learning to do things as I should. But there was something wild and untamable in my English spirit — or is it Irish or Welsh ? — that at times outraged his old- fashioned ideas of what was ladylike, and then qven he and I would be at cross-purposes for a little moment. I had often to swallow unshed tears. A stubborn streak of English pride has always made me want to hide pain or disappointment. I never cared for Pless, but my father-in-law loved it. In his eyes one of its most interesting features was his famous stud of magnificently bred horses. A roan chestnut was his favourite colour and I can see 54 THE RACING STABLES AT PLESS now in my mind's eyes a perfect stallion called Rapid Roa^. The Master of the Horse was a dear old gentleman with an Italian wife. When he conducted us round the stables or the breeding establishment he always wore a grey top-hat and gave the impression that we were being shown a holy sanctuary where hardly a word might be spoken. As in England, this performance usually took place on Sunday mornings after church and before luncheon, and it was certainly felt to be the most important and impressive ceremony of the day. I seem to remember that Vater once ran a horse for the Derby and very nearly won it. To please my father-in-law I did my best to memorize the pedigrees of the more famous stallions and mares. I would say : \" What a lovely foal ; I am sure Rapid Roan is the father and Pless Beauty the mother.\" Sometimes, by a lucky hit, I was correct and every one would smile and say, \" Yes, Your High- ness.\" I love horses, just as I love people, but I never could understand pedigrees. To me, trying to memorize the ancestry and relationships of either race- horses or families is as hard as trying to grasp the Athanasian Creed. So far, the most difficult part of writing this book has been to get into my head who exactly my great-grandparerits were. Fortunately I need only keep such points in my head long enough to write them down. Like the reader, I can then speedily forget them. We had nearly always to be at Pless for Christmas, which was not a bit like Christmas at home. We had pretty German Christmas songs, but no crackers, mince pies or plum puddings. Later on I used to procure these from England and have a private little celebration in my own room, in which my English maid and my husband's English valet joined. Had I done this in public every one would have thought that I was seriously trying to undermine the constitution of the Kingdom of Prussia. At Pless we had a great number of men called Oberforster or head foresters, who wore a beautiful A DISGUSTING TABLE CUSTOM 55 green uniform. At stated times they were invited to luncheon and then we would use the big dining-room, which is enormous. I shall never forget the first time this happened. I was much impressed by their pictur- esque appearance,- until my husband warned me by saying : \" Do not look surprised, my dear girl, if you see them spitting into their finger-bowls ! \" I thought he was what my sons call \" pulling my leg \" until, to my horror, I saw them put a peppermint and water mixture, served for the purpose, into their finger-bowls, gargle, and then pass it back : it almost made me sick ! All over Germany the disgusting spitting habit used to be general. It is now much better, but even in spotless Munich you see notices forbidding it every- where ; and in all shops are displayed the orders of the City authorities, Nicnt aufden Boden spucken. This may be a good thing, but the sight of the notice in a caf6, dairy, or food shop arouses unpleasant suggestions. My second son, Lexel, now aged twenty-two, re- minds me that when he was fifteen he was made almost ill every evening at his Uncle Bolko's country house, Rohnstock, in Silesia, by this revolting gargling practice. The establishment was maintained on very old- fashioned lines. Ugly blue glass finger-bowls, with a blue glass tumbler inside them containing the necessary mixture, were placed in front of each guest and, at the end of the rneal, conscientiously and noisily used. The party then entered the drawing-room and, before coffee was served, all the relations gave each other an emphatic and resounding kiss, at the same time saying Mahlzeit, meaning good digestion. The nasty kissing habit has fortunately quite died out, but in many middle-class families it is still the custom for anyone entering a room while a meal is in progress or leaving the table before it is ended to say mahlzeit* The Danes have a similar custom, and in that country to omit to say Vel bekomme in such cir- cumstances would be considered very rude indeed. Lexel adds that, horrid as the gargling in the dining- room was, it at least served to mitigate the beastliness 56 FURSTENSTEIN of being kissed by a lot of people whose mouths and beards smelled and tasted of dinner ! But then Lexel never did like promiscuous embraces, and, as a very small boy, once flatly refused to kiss even the Em- peror's hand. II I much preferred our occasional Christmases at Fiirstenstein, They were very happy, almost sacred, because all our Guards, servants and dependants and their families came and celebrated Christmas with us. There were presents for every one and it was great fun choosing suitable ones. Some of my English friends used to come over and stay and help us and, for the time, every one was free and happy. This is one of the very nicest sides of German life that on such occasions perfect equality obtains between prince and peasant. The Castle of Fiirstenstein occupies a . magnificent position : it crowns a great pointed pine-clad rock over two hundred feet high on the south-west and north, and dominates an enormous stretch of country filled with forests, lakes and wide stretches of open plain which fade away to the distant Silesian mountains. Many of the old rooms in one part of the house are actually in the rock and, to reach the Castle, one must approach it from the east and cross the great stone bridge which spans a river flowing far down below at the bottom of a deep ravine. The roads to the Castle all gradually ascend and the approach from any direction is an ever-changing vista of enchanting loveliness. It is situated close to the western border of Silesia, where it touches what was the old Bohemian frontier in the picturesque mountain country known in Ger- many as Sudeten Gebirge. It was originally a moated fortress and Burgwarte, or watch-tower, and was erected for the purposes of defending the frontier by Duke Bolko I. of Lowenberg-Schweidnitz about ia<>2. But fortresses in those days were always changing FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF GERMANY 57 hands and some time after the Castle came into the possession of Ritter Conrad I. of Hochberg of Giersdorf , the founder of the Fiirstenstein line, and has been held by his descendants to this day. From the main Park gates a splendid avenue of linden trees leads gradually to the entrance towers guarding the bridge and passes through the outer and inner court-yards gay with flowers, to the principal entrance on the east front. Fiirstenstein is not really a peaceful place ; one cannot get on the green grass away from servants. One is Sways passing a Musketeer, and the terraces are stiff, and there are always old men and women working on them, keeping them far too tidy and formal- looking. There are no corners massed with roses of no particular kind, where butterflies dance and bees hum. Except in the forests, every tree in Germany is grown as a standard ; maples, may trees, lilacs, every- thing. Just at the end of the winter when the poor little things think no one cares, they start to burst, but all the little quivering green twigs are cut off. They have to grow and live and flower by rule. So many German gardens are like a prim little Gretchen in a stiff cotton frock with eyes cast down, white cotton stockings and black boots and lots and lots of thin little plaits round her head. Such gardens resemble ferns and a fern always seems to me such a proper plant — no colour or scent or mystery : it is the Mrs. Grundy of the plant world. To me, Fiirstenstein has always brought a sense of loneliness, but that of course is largely because it is in a foreign country. If only there had been some nice simple countrified neighbours instead of the gossipy, jealous, narrow-minded Counts and Countesses, it would have made all the difference. On moon-lit nights I used to wander on the terraces alone, and then come up the steps to hear German, and smell cigars — and the sound of the river in the valley made me think of the sea at Newlands, one wave follow- ing another for ever and ever ! The state, too, as I have said, irked me. For years /v I was not allowed to use a motor but was always met at the station by a semi-state carriage with postilions. At Pless and Fiirstenstein a gorgeously dressed man with a cocked hat and a tall silver staff was always on duty outside the front door. He signalled one's approach to the servants, flourished his great stick and saluted like a regimental drum-major of the English Guards. Privately I christened him Guy Fawkes. I have always been, in a way, a Socialist ; and hated our liveries all smothered in silver lace, and the un- necessary servants for nothing but show. On gala occasions at least thirty men waited at dinner. I am quite sure it is wrong to flaunt one's riches and power. To do things well in a quiet and dignified way is quite another matter. One expects to see a lady well-dressed and with good shoes and lingerie — but she need not lift up her skirts and say, \" Look at my Valenciennes.\" All the display made me feel like a nouveau ricke, and eventually I persuaded my husband to reduce some of it. One day I did a perfectly mad thing ; it was to try to learn how to ride postilion. Of course I had to have a lady's saddle, no other was possible in Germany in those days. Well, try to ride postilion with a lady's saddle. See how uncomfortable it is. I did not dare to go through the villages or meet anybody, or I should have got into a terrible family row when I got home ; such an incomprehensible game would not have been tolerated. Why is it a man can do anything and a woman nothing ? At any rate, they are doing more now ; to my mind, perhaps too much. I would rather they stayed more at home, had more babies and personally looked after them. I remember so well the Emperor being at Pless one Sunday soon after my marriage ; he and my father-in- law, mother-in-law and sister-in-law had walked on* I said I would follow in a minute. I wanted to change my clothes, and, hurriedly doing so, joined them in a short red-brown walking frock and cap with a walking stick. My \" in-laws\" had put on long skirts for TEASING MY FATHER-IN-LAW 59 church and had not changed. The Emperor looked iit me and said : \" Now that is what I call properly dressed ; a short skirt and stout shoes.\" I felt very shy and said nothing. In the evenings in those days we all sat round a table with a lamp in the middle, the women of the family with their embroidery. I used to get up in the morning very simple-minded and good-tempered, and we all sat under the lime trees and wrote letters or sewed. Nothing else was permitted. At Promnitz, the principal shooting-box in Pless, we were not allowed to wear evening dresses or jewels. This, thank goodness, made it more homely. So one evening, to tease dear old Vater, I came down in a sack- cloth s£irt and bodice made of two new sacks I had got from the stables. In one I made holes for my two arms to come through and I cut the bottom of it off to make sleeves. With the other sack I made a skirt and put on a red tie, waistband and bows at my wrists. I said nothing but sat down next to Vater at dinner. In the middle of the meal the deaf old gentleman said : \"I cannot understand this^extriaordinary smell of horse and hay near me,\"*4<a|| .filmed round as if to ask a servant. Of course thejrknew the joke. At last he put his head close to me, whispering in Germa"
