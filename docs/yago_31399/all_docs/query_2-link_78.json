        "text": "Family\n\nPeter Ferdinand was the fourth child and third-eldest son of Ferdinand IV, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his wife Alice of Bourbon-Parma. His two elder brothers married morganatically.\n\nLife\n\nPeter Ferdinand had a career in the army. In 1908 he was a colonel, in 1911 major general and on 23 April 1914 he was promoted to Feldmarschall-Leutnant. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, he was commander of the 25th Infantry Division, with which he fought against Russia in Galicia and southern Poland, as part of the Austro-Hungarian II Corps. General Moritz von Auffenberg later blamed Peter Ferdinand's actions for preventing the encirclement of the entire 5th Russian army during the Battle of Komarów. In June 1915, Peter Ferdinand was relieved of command and the 25th Division was taken over by Major General Joseph Poleschensky.\n\nOn 17 April 1917 he was reinstated and, as a General of the Infantry, put in command of an army corps on the Italian front. His troops first defended the Ortler Range and then covered the flank of the 14th German Army during its advance in the Battle of Caporetto. On August 15, 1918 his Corps, now stationed in Trentino, was renamed to V Army Corps. From 26 October 1918, in the last days of the war, he commanded the 10th Army in Trento on behalf of Field Marshal Alexander von Krobatin.\n\nMarriage and issue\n\nPeter Ferdinand married Princess Maria Cristina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, daughter of Prince Alfonso, Count of Caserta and his wife Princess Antonietta of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, on 8 November 1900 in Cannes, France. They had issue:\n\nArchduke Gottfried of Austria, Prince of Tuscany (14 March 1902 – 21 January 1984)\n\nmarried Princess Dorothea of Bavaria on 3 August 1938 in Sárvár, Hungary; and had issue:\n\nArchduchess Helena (30 October 1903 – 8 September 1924)\n\nmarried Philipp Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg on 24 October 1923 at Altshausen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany; and they had issue.\n\nArchduke Georg (22 August 1905 – 21 March 1952)\n\nmarried Countess Marie Valerie of Waldburg-Zeil-Hohenems on 29 August 1936 at St. Gilgen, and they had issue:\n\nArchduchess Rosa 22 September 1906 – 17 September 1983)\n\nmarried Philipp Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg on 1 August 1928 at Friedrichshafen; and they had issue."
