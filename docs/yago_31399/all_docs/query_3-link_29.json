The dynastic and pout\n\nobjections to the match were due to\n\nrnct that he was destined to succ\n\nthe present Emperor on the throne\n\nAustria and of Hungary. The perso\n\nopposition came largely from his re\n\nlives, especially from Archduch\n\nFrederick, who, after his refusal\n\nwed Archduchess Maria Dorothea, n\n\nDuchess of Orleans, bad counted ur\n\nT.irt marrying one of her daughters, a\n\nwas terribly disappointed to find tl\n\nthey had been cut out, so to speak,\n\nher lady in waiting.\n\nEmperor Consents to Match.\n\nEmperor Francis Joseph. howeri\n\nultima*ely pave his consent to t\n\nmatch upon the archduke registering\n\nsolemn oath on the (iospels n?id\n\nwriting in the presence of the prlhc\n\nof his house and of the ?1 it-nit!.ries\n\nthe realm whereby he pledged himsc\n\nthat on becoming Emperor he wou\n\nnever take advantage thereof to rr.'\n\nMl morganatic wife to *hun> h\n\nthrone, or woub\" seek to endow any r??\n\nl???r'i of the union with rights to t?\n\nTo-vn.

The Kmperor has been seeing\n\nevery ?lay his nephew assuming th>\n\npart of Austria's ruler. In fact, for\n\n(several years the Kmperor has ?keen\n\nlittle more than a ngurehead, the arch?\n\nduke doing all the work and deciding\n\n?everything of importance.

At that time\n\nshe told passengers on the ship that\n\nshe had abandoned the title of \"Prin?\n\ncess Vetsera,\" and that she expected\n\nto leave Paris and London for many\n\njears, in order that her boy could be\n\neducated in America.\n\nMa\\ Press Son's Claim.\n\n\"I don't want to'live on the other\n\nside any more.\" she said. \"There are\n\ntoo many unhappy memories associ?\n\nated with it. I am building a house\n\nnow near New York, where I will have\n\na r\"al home.\"\n\nBut since the news of yesterday tell?\n\ning of the seaaaaination of Franz Fer?\n\ndinand and his consort it is probable\n\nthat Mrs. Hayne will change her mind.\n\nThe aged Kmperor has been dying\n\nby inches for months, so it is freely\n\nsaid in Vienna. Optimistic reports of\n\nhis condition are issued at t'req'ir i '\n\nintervals by th?.? chamberlain at the\n\nImperial Hofburg, where he lies ill, but\n\nthe common people sitting on the park\n\nbenches in the Stadtwaldchen in Buda?\n\npest ami the Wurstel Prater in Vienna\n\nhave been surmising for half a year\n\nwhat will happen when Franz Joecf\n\ndien, an event they confidently expect\n\nat any time.\n\nUne particular reason why Mrs.\n\nHayne will perhaps change her attitude\n\nil because it has always been Fran/.\n\nJoaef himself who preserved such a\n\nstern opposition t?. any irregularity in\n\nthe Hapsburg succession.\n\nAfter Rudolph was found dead just\n\ntwenty-five years ago a rather grew\n\ntome, yet interesting story which was\n\nrevived in the popular mind by the\n\npublication of the I.arisch memoirs\n\nlast year the Kmperor offered the\n\nsuccession to his brother, Carl Ludwig,\n\nwho declined. The honor passed to\n\nCarl Ludwig'-? son, Franz. Ferdinand,\n\nwho was killed yesterday, but when\n\nFranz. Ferdinand contracted a mor?\n\nganatic marriage the Kmperor made\n\nhim renounce all rights for his pos?\n\nsible heirs.\n\nThis illustrates the unyielding posi?\n\ntion of the head of the pictures?|ue dual\n\nmonarchy. It might be. however, that\n\nwith his death Mrs. Hayne would f. ?!\n\nmore free to push the claim of her\n\nson.\n\nHer Own Career Romantic.\n\nShe herseif has hart a rati-er roman?\n\ntic time of it.
