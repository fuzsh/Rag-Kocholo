        "text": "Not quite, but it's certainly up for discussion and they seem agreeable to listen seriously to any reasonable offer made quietly and privately by sympathetic investors. The article begins with Corin Rose, the Habsburg family lawyer, quoted as stating \"Bran Castle is not for sale.\" He added that if it were put up for sale the Romanian government would have the right of first refusal.\n\nThe owners, Archduke Dominc (76) and his sisters Archduchesses Maria Magdalena (74) and Elisabeth (72) of the Habsburg Tuscan branch have restored the castle to a reasonable condition following the communist regime's many years of neglect. Annual visitor numbers are at over 500,000 and Bran Castle is currently making over €1m [near US$1.4m, £815K, AU$1.5m] annual profit.\n\nHowever, to continue to improve the castle facilities, expand the attractions (such as a proper Dracula-themed museum) and provide good-standard accommodation, a large investment and lots of energy will be required. The Habsburg siblings believe they are too old for the task. [All three have families, with nine children between them, but they aren't mentioned anywhere and don't appear to be part of the equation]. The only offers they would consider would be those made by parties who shared their view of the historical, cultural and economic significance of the castle to Romania.\n\nDracula remains a popular figure in the English-speaking world so there is little fear of a drop-off in visitor numbers. With its spectacular setting and close associations with the unlikely trio of the larger-than-life Queen Marie, the fictional Count and the real Vlad III, Voivode of Wallacia - the dreaded and posthumously-titled \"Impaler\" of Turks (and others) - Bran Castle should, in the right hands, have a bright future and continue to be Romania's no 1 tourist attraction and 'national monument'\n\nForbes has valued the castle and property at US$140m [€102m, £83m, AU$150m]. It is believed that Archduke Dominic offered it to the Romanian government for US$80m but that information is unconfirmed.\n\nBran Castle, Brasov, Romania\n\nPicture taken in 2010 and reproduced here courtesy of Wikipedia\n\nThis file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Romania license.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nCountess Magdalena von Habsburg-Lorraine [Tuscan line] weds Sebastian Bergmann\n\n​\n\n20 July 2014\n\nThe result of the Google translator...\n\n​\n\n\"Imperial Wedding\" in glorious weather\n\nGreat-great-granddaughter of Franz Josef married fellow student Sebastian Bergmann\n\n​\n\nAn \"Imperial Wedding\" in glorious weather experienced in the Upper Austrian Salzkammergut Bad Ischl Saturday Afternoon: Magdalena Maria Sophie of Habsburg-Lorraine, the great-great-granddaughter of Emperor Franz Josef married Sebastian Bergmann. The two doctoral lawyers who met while studying in Vienna.\n\nThe bride's father, Count Markus von Habsburg-Lothringen, is the owner of the Imperial Villa, the former summer residence of Franz Josef. With thousands of visitors per year, it is the most significant tourism operation of Bad Ischl. Emperor Franz Joseph and his wife Elisabeth \"Sisi\" met in the Salzkammergut City.\n\nAt the wedding in the parish church of St. Nicholas, numerous onlookers found a. \"But she is already a pretty bride,\" said a woman as the bride arrived. She wore the dress that her mother had worn to her wedding 32 years ago - classic cut, trimmed with lace - and a tiara in her hair.\n\nThe wedding Mass was celebrated by the Archbishop of Salzburg, Franz Lackner. Many relatives, friends and acquaintances of the family Habsburg-Lothringen in Austria, Germany and Liechtenstein had traveled to the event. On the guest list, among others, the names of the Hohenberg, Altenberg, Salm-Salm, Belcredi Festetics, Goess and Salm-Reifferscheidt were present.\n\nPrincess Caroline of Monaco, who occasionally stays in a hunting castle belonging to the family [Hanover] of her husband, the nearby Almtal, sent a bouquet of flowers.\n\nFederal President Heinz Fischer, who had visited an exhibition on the First World War in Bad Ischl, visited the couple in the Imperial Villa before the wedding. Even Governor Josef Pühringer (ÖVP) and the Ischler Mayor Hannes Heide (SPÖ) participated.\n\nv Countess Magdalena von Habsburg-Lorraine & Sebastian Bergmann\n\nThe thumbnail image forms a cropped portion of a larger photograph.​\n\nAttachments\n\nMagdalena.jpg"
