        "text": "The House of Habsburg-Lorraine (German: Haus Habsburg-Lothringen) originated from the marriage in 1736 of Francis III, Duke of Lorraine and Bar, and Maria Theresa of Austria, later successively Queen of Bohemia, Queen of Hungary and Archduchess of Austria. Its members are the legitimate surviving line of the House of Habsburg and the House of Lorraine, inheriting their patrimonial possessions and vocation to the Empire from the female descendants of the House of Habsburg and the male line of the House of Lorraine.\n\nThe branch of Vaudemont and Guise from the House of Lorraine become the major branch after a brief interlude in 1453–1473, when the duchy passed in right of Charles de Bourbon's daughter to her husband John of Calabria, a Capetian, Lorraine reverted to the House of Vaudemont, a junior branch of the House of Lorraine, in the person of René II, who later added to his titles that of Duke of Bar.\n\nThe House of Habsburg takes its name from Habsburg Castle, a fortress built in the 1020s by Count Radbot of Klettgau in Aargau, present-day Switzerland. His grandson, Otto II, was the first to take on the name of the fortress as his own, adding Graf von Habsburg (\"Count of Habsburg\") to his title. The House of Habsburg gathered dynastic momentum during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, and in 1273, Radbot's seventh-generation descendant Rudolph of Habsburg became Roman-German King. He moved the family's power base to the Duchy of Austria, which the Habsburgs ruled until 1918.\n\nThe current house orders are the Order of the Golden Fleece and the Imperial and Royal Order of Saint George. The House of Habsburg-Lorraine still exists today and the current head of the family is Karl von Habsburg.\n\nHistory[]\n\nOrigins[]\n\nThe House of Habsburg-Lorraine Today[]\n\nThe current leader of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine is King Karl II and IV of Austria-Hungary, who succeeded his father Otto as head of the royal house after his father's abdication in 2007.\n\nLeopold II, Holy Roman Emperor (1747–1792)\n\nEmperor Francis I (1768–1835)\n\nEmperor Ferdinand I (1793–1875)\n\nArchduke Franz Karl (1802–1878)\n\nEmperor Franz Joseph I (1830–1916)\n\nArchduke Karl Ludwig (1833–1896)\n\nArchduke Otto Francis (1865–1906)\n\nEmperor Charles I (1887–1922)\n\nEmperor Otto II (1912–2011)\n\nEmperor Karl II (born 1961)\n\n(1) Crown Prince Ferdinand (b. 1997)\n\n(2) Archduke Georg (b. 1964);
