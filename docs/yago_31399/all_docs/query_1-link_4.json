        "text": "Guests at the glamorous occasion included the Margravine of Baden and the Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, along with King Umberto of Italy and the bride’s grandmother, Princess Alice of Greece, the mother of Prince Philip. Princess Alice, who was wearing a nun’s habit, was born congenitally deaf and was sent to a psychiatric hospital in 1930 after being diagnosed with schizophrenia. Her uncle, who by then was the Duke of Edinburgh and husband of Queen Elizabeth II, did not attend.\n\nIn photographs, Princess Dorothea smiles happily at the camera, surrounded by a cluster of adorable bridesmaids and pageboys, who were the children of German aristocrats. Dressed in a sweeping, boat-necked white wedding dress, her look was completed with a polka-dot veil, while the groom looked dapper in military uniform.\n\nRead More\n\nKing Harald of Norway is seen for the first time since undergoing surgery - as he poses for a family photograph\n\nNorway’s monarch fell ill while abroad and received a temporary pacemaker. Now, he has joined the rest of his family for a new official portrait\n\nThe formal ceremonies were followed by a glittering royal wedding ball where the bride looked mesmerising in a silk evening gown, her hair in a stylish curled bob, wearing the Hesse Aquamarine Tiara, which features Aquamarine stones and was thought to have first been owned by the Grand Duchess Elisabeth de Russie, according to French website, Bijoux Royaux en Folie. It was not seen again until the Princess auctioned it at Sotheby’s on 10 October, 1996. A year later, the tiara (or possibly its copy) appeared on the Atelier Versace spring show.\n\nRead More\n\nChanel Culture Fund announces winners of Chanel Next Prize, heralding the new generation of avante-garde artists\n\nJudged by veterans of the artistic cutting-edge, including Tilda Swinton, the 2024 edition of the Chanel Next prize recognises ten emerging artists redefining the world with their creativity\n\nBorn on 24 July, 1934, Princess Dorothea was the second of five children of Princess Sophie of Greece and Hanover, who was the youngest of the Duke of Edinburgh’s four older sisters. Growing up, Princess Dorothea’s mother was closely linked with the Nazis; she joined the National Socialist Women’s League in 1938 and her eldest son Karl received, among his names, that of Adolf, in tribute to Hitler.\n\nRead More\n\nSpring’s Mod Mood! Tatler’s Style Counsel returns with the ultimate ensemble for a sizzling Swinging Sixties comeback\n\nWith a new documentary on rock‘n’roll goddess Anita Pallenberg hitting the silver screen, an exhibition on Biba-era South Ken style opening at the Fashion and Textile Museum, and a plethora of perfectly King’s Road-worthy cuts back on the runways, the Sixties are officially back in all their mini-skirt-clad glory. Tatler’s style editor breaks down to must-haves for the new Mod mood\n\nHowever, Princess Sophie is said to have realised the true nature of Hitler’s regime after her husband’s brother, Prince Philip of Hesse, was imprisoned in a concentration camp, as was his wife, Princess Mafalda, who died. Due to Princess Sophie’s links with the Nazi regime, she was excluded from the wedding of Queen Elizabeth II to Prince Philip in 1947, but quietly reconciled the British Royal Family in later years. Sophie died in 2001.\n\nMeanwhile, Princess Dorothea and Prince Friedrich welcomed two daughters, according to the Royal Watcher. There are conflicting reports surrounding Princess Dorothea but several sources report she died in 2002."
