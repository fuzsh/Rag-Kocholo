She was the daughter of Johann Markgraf von Brandenburg-Kulmbach and Barbara von Sachsen-Wittenberg. She married, firstly, Christopher III von Neumarkt, King of Denmark, son of Johann von Neumarkt, Count Palatine of Neumarkt and Katherine of Pomerania, in 1445. She married, secondly, Christian I Oldenburg, King of Denmark and Norway, son of Dietrich Oldenburg, Count of Oldenburg and Hedwig Herzogin von Schleswig-Holstein, on 26 October 1449 at Copenhagen, Denmark. She died on 10 November 1495 at Roskilde.\n\nShe was also known as Dorothy Achillies.

Also included in this fellowship was Finland, that was a part of Sweden (until 1809), and Iceland, Greenland, the Faroes and the Shetland archipelago, belonging to Norway, meaning that the union encompassed all of the Nordic countries. The formal marking of the unification took place in the Swedish city of Kalmar, where Erik of Pomerania was crowned king of all three realms in 1397. The union’s centre of power was located in Denmark, but all the countries were principally ruled according to their own laws and traditions. The union was, with short breaks, maintained from 1397 to 1448. Following this, only the personal union with Norway – with a few interruptions – remained in effect (until 1814), while the Danish kings only managed to rule in Sweden for brief periods until Sweden definitively seceded by proclaiming Gustav Vasa king of Sweden in 1523.\n\nResearch Notes\n\nFOR KINGS AND QUEENS OF DENMARK\n\nNichols, John Gough.
