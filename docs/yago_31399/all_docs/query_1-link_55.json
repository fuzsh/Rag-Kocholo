He was the eldest son of Prince Franz of Bavaria and his wife Princess Isabella Antonie of Croÿ. After graduating from the Maximilians-Gymnasium (located in Schwabing, Munich), Ludwig studied forestry at a university in Hungary. In 1939, as most young German men of his age, he was drafted into the military, serving as a Gebirgsjäger. However, his career in the German Army was short lived. In early 1941, Ludwig was relieved from all combat duties as a result of the Prinzenerlass which prohibited members of Germany's royal houses from participating in military operations. He spent the rest of the war at Sarvar in Hungary where his family owned a castle. In 1945 his family fled Hungary and settled at Leutstetten near Starnberg in Bavaria.\n\nMarriage\n\nOn 19 July 1950, Ludwig married his first cousin Princess Irmingard of Bavaria, the daughter of Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria and Princess Antonia of Luxembourg. The civil wedding took place at Leutstetten and the religious ceremony followed a day later at Schloss Nymphenburg in Munich. The couple had three children:\n\nPrince Luitpold of Bavaria (born 1951)\n\nPrincess Irmingard Maria of Bavaria (1953 - 1953)\n\nPrincess Philippa of Bavaria (1954 - 1954)\n\nLater life\n\nAfter the death of Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria in 1955, Ludwig and Irmingard moved into Schloss Leutstetten where Irmingard continued to live."
