-FAMILY THEME-

Princess Sophie Friederike Dorothea Wilhelmine of Bavaria was born on January 27, 1805 in Munich, as the daughter of the first Bavarian king, Maximilian I Joseph and his second wife, Caroline of Baden, the first Queen Consort of Bavaria. She was a member of the Wittelsbach family.

Sophie had twelve siblings (seven from the same mother), plus she had a twin sister, Maria Anna, who later became the Queen Consort of Saxony.

She and her siblings were raised by their parents, which was unrivalled in that age. The King and Queen of Bavaria educate their children to think like modern people, and be punctual.

Sophie was a natural beauty, and her brother (King Ludwig I) posted a painting of her in his “Gallery of Beauties”, the Schönheitengalerie.

On 4 November, 1828 she married Archduke Franz Karl of Austria, son of Emperor Franz I ( Emperor Franz II of the Holy Roman Empire) in Vienna. At this time, Emperor Franz’s wife was Empress Caroline Augusta, born as a Princess of Bavaria, and she was Sophie’s halfsister, so Sophie’s stepmother-in-law was her own sister. That’s a little bit strange, isn’t it?

Sophie had miscarriages several time, so she was handled in medicinal baths at Bad Ischl. But in 1830 she gave birth to her first child, Archduke Franz Joseph. The couple had five other children:

– Ferdinand Maximilian (1832-1867): married Princess Charlotte of Belgium. He was the Emperor of Mexico between 1864-1867.

– Karl Ludwig (1833-1896): he had three wives and six children (three sons and three daughters). He was the father of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

– Maria Anna (1835-1840): she was called Ännchen by her family. She died after a violent seizure at age 4.

– Stillborn son (24 October, 1840)

– Ludwig Viktor (1842-1919): he was forbidden from Vienna by Franz Joseph because of his very public homosexuality and transvestitism, and after that he lived in Klessheim Palace, where he was known as philanthropist and patron of the arts.

Sophie was an important person in Austrian politics, and she was “the only man at court” (der einzige Mann bei Hofe). During the Revolution of 1848 she managed to get Emperor Ferdinand to abdicate the throne, and the other heirs to give up their rights to the throne in favour of her son, Franz Joseph. So Sophie’s son became the Emperor, and Sophie was the power behind him. Her title was Kaiserinmutter, which isn’t equal with “Queen (or here Empress) Mother”.

The Archduchess wrote a diary, which reveals much about Austrian court life.

The Archduchess’s favourite child was Ferdinand Maximilian, and after his execution in 1867 she never recoverd from the schok. She died of a brain tumor aged 67 in 1872. One thing plus: during her life, Sophie lost two of her children (plus a stillborn boy), just like Sisi, so we can imagine how she was damaged by these tragedies and what she could feel as a mother.

Was she the “böse Frau” (mean woman)?

Sophie is well-known for her bad relationship with her niece and daughter-in-law, Empress Elisabeth. There was tension between the two women because of several reasons: Sisi’s children’s education; the Empress’ love for Hungary (Sophie hated this country). Many people think that Sophie wanted to do harm to Sisi, but in this way that isn’t true. She wanted to do something good for Elisabeth, just in her own way. She loved her niece, but she didn’t tolerate any resistance.
