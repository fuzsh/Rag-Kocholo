        "text": "This article argues that, contrary to mainstream liberal school claim, Syria did not act as a destabilizer of the Lebanese confessional system which led to the breakdown of the system and to civil war between 1975 and 1990. Rather, the Syrian regime, driven by the interests of the Damascene bourgeois class closely associated with the transit trade between Beirut and the Gulf region via Damascus, chose to contain the crisis and rehabilitate the confessional system which is a system of hegemony that hinders class struggle to the benefit of the Lebanese mercantile bourgeoisie.\n\nThis article argues that the Lebanese Civil War (1975–90) was in essence a terror of state directed by mercantile economic and political elites (the comprador class) controlling the Lebanese state and society against the middle and poorer classes (the working class). The aim of this terror or organized violence was to subdue the subordinate classes, which in the late 1960s and early 1970s rebelled against the confessional system that operated for the benefit of the comprador class. The rebellion was expressed by members of the working class joining cross-confessional nationalist and leftist parties. Hence, violence was aimed at reestablishing the confessional order as a means to restore a hegemonic system that served the interests of the comprador class at a time when this class was rehabilitating its economic role by resurrecting the financial system, which had received a severe blow in the late 1960s. It effected this rehabilitation through the Taif Agreement signed between Lebanese parliamentarians in 1989, under the auspices of Syria, Saudi Arabia, and the United States, to favor the new mercantile elite led by Rafiq Hariri.\n\nAlthough the confessional system in Lebanon seems to guarantee the political representation of different groups, it is far from a centralized nation-state model based on the idea of citizenship in modern sense. On the contrary, it has prevented the consolidation of modern nation-state and the integration of different sectarian groups. Additionally, after the independence, the feudal lords could be able to hold their socio-economic privileges, and certain families could establish their leadership in various sectarian communities. This complex social structure has been further fragmented during the civil war years from 1975 to 1990. Although there is a fairly extensive literature on the Lebanese civil war, revisiting the war once again is believed to be a very timely study as the intensification of sectarian conflicts leads to the Lebanonization of the whole Middle East. This study aims to analyze the civil war by dividing it into certain periods and argues that socio-economic disparities fed by sectarian differences turned into identity-based conflicts with the intervention of regional and international actors, which further deepened the sectarian fragmentation in Lebanon. As a qualitative research, this study draws its sources from both primary and secondary sources in addition to a field work in Lebanon. Mezhebe dayalı temsiliyet nedeniyle farklı grupların yönetime katılımını teminat altına alan bir sistem gibi görünen Lübnan’daki siyasi yapı modern bir ulus-devlette esas olan vatandaşlık kavramının toplum ve birey nezdinde yerleşmesinin önünde engel olmuş ve ülkedeki dini/mezhebi grupların uzun dönemde birbirine entegre olabilmesinden ziyade bu cemaatlerin sınırlarını çizerek gruplar arası iletişimin dini/mezhebi kimlikler üzerinden yürütülmesine yol açmıştır. Ayrıca, bağımsızlığın kazanılmasından sonra eskinin feodal beyleri sosyo-ekonomik üstünlüklerini elinde tutabilmiş, belirli aileler farklı mezhebi gruplarda öne çıkarak liderliklerini tesis edebilmişlerdir. Bu karmaşık sosyal yapı, 1975-1990 Lübnan İç Savaşı ile derinden parçalanma sürecine girmiştir. Lübnan iç savaşına ilişkin literatür oldukça zengin olmakla beraber, mezhep bazlı söylem ile çatışmaların giderek yoğunlaştığı Ortadoğu’nun giderek Lübnanlaştığı bir dönemde, bu çalışma bahse konu iç savaşı belirli periyotlarda inceleyerek başlangıçta yerel ve daha çok sosyo-ekonomik eşitsizliklere dayanan sosyal sıkıntıların, süreç içinde yerel, bölgesel ve bölge dışı aktörlerin de katılımıyla kimlik çatışması çerçevesinde algılandığını anlatmaktadır. Bu anlatımda bahse konu dönüşümün, siyasi söylemi ve toplumlar arası ilişkileri daha derinden ve şiddetli bir biçimde mezhebileştirdiği vurgulanmaktadır. Nitel bir araştırma olan bu çalışma, birincil ve ikincil kaynakların yanı sıra Lübnan’da gerçekleştirilen saha çalışmasına dayanmaktadır.\n\nLebanese political dynamics are often characterised by political confessionalism, neo-liberal economics, corruption, and its particularity as an Arab state with Western social orientations. Although these characterisations may seem, at times, contradictory, this article argues that they are part of a political structure that initially developed during the Civil War (1975-1990) that was sustained by Lebanon’s post-conflict power sharing agreement. This article builds on the critiques present in the developing scholarship on post-conflict power sharing, demonstrating how dynamics established as a consequence of the Civil War continued into the post-conflict period. This has led to the reproduction of sectarian boundary inflammation, limitations on democratic and civil society mobilisation, and political stagnation. The article concludes with an analysis of the 2015 Garbage Crisis as exemplary of sustained Civil War dynamics and the consequent constraints on civil society mobilisation caused by these dynamics."
