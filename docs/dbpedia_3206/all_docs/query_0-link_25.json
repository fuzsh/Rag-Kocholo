You have to ask many questions that need to be answered before hand.\n\nSuch as;\n\n1. Whats your budget?\n\nWhich includes project budget and yearly IT Budget.\n\n2. Staffing and staff ability\n\nWhat is the current staff used to?\n\nWill we have to retrain?\n\nIf hiring new staff to support the new system, what are you willing to pay?\n\n3. Usability\n\nis the company Microsoft heavy or Open Source heavy? If the owner wants to be able to reboot and check the servers themselves, will it be easier with a familiar Microsoft product or go Linux?\n\nWhen asked to evaluate products for a business, I never look at the “free” product. Free is for small non-profits and personal use in my eyes.\n\nNine times out of ten nothing is for free and if you plan to use an OS such as a free Linux distro, in the end you will be paying for it.\n\nWhether your paying more money in salary for more experienced techs, more money for consultants when you want stuff done, or your loosing money due to costly down time due to bad application of the product. It all has to be part of the equation.\n\nIf you have your Linux Admin God and you know he’s not going anywhere, then take the plunge in to free. But I always look at it like this, that person is just a resume away from leaving, if offered the right money."
