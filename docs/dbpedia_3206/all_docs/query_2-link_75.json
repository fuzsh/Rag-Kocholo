        "text": "NEWS BRIEFS\n\nMicrosoft Corp., Intel and HP announced the world’s first single-system TPC-C benchmark result to surpass the 600,000 tpmC mark. This record-breaking performance benchmark of 658,277 represents enterprise transaction order handling performance that surpasses all competing platform results and sets a new standard for price/performance on 64-processor systems of $9.82/tpmC.\n\nThis announcement with Windows Server 2003 and SQL Server 2000 (64- bit) represents the crowning achievement of years in research and engineering to develop a high-performance server platform that delivers the highest tpmC performance in the world. Continued performance leadership, across all workloads, provides customers of every size with exceptional price/performance at a lower total cost of ownership than proprietary systems. Performance increases across a wide variety of workloads are evidenced in recent public benchmark results, including the Transaction Processing Performance Council’s TPC-C and TPC-H, placing Windows Server 2003 with SQL Server 2000 (64-bit) in the top 10 of the leading industry benchmarks, consistently ranking them at the top for price/performance.\n\nAbout Windows Server 2003\n\nWindows Server 2003 is a comprehensive, integrated and secure infrastructure designed to help customers reduce costs and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of IT operations. Building on Windows 2000 family strengths, the new server platform helps customers extend existing resources while laying the foundation for building a new generation of connected applications that improve business productivity. Windows Server 2003 is the foundation for the Microsoft Windows Server System, an integrated server infrastructure for building, deploying and operating agile business solutions.\n\nAbout Microsoft\n\nFounded in 1975, Microsoft is the worldwide leader in software, services and Internet technologies for personal and business computing. The company offers a wide range of products and services designed to empower people through great software — any time, any place and on any device.\n\nTPC-C is one of the Transaction Processing Performance Council’s benchmarks for measuring computer system performance. Performance is evaluated based on a model of online transaction processing. Benchmark results are expressed in terms of how many new-order transactions are performed per minute (tpmC).\n\nWeb site: http://www.microsoft.com\n\n============================================================"
