        "text": "Client Access Licensing\n\nMicrosoft offers flexible, cost-effective options for licensing the Windows Server 2003 family of products, including Windows Server 2003 R2 editions. Similar to previous Windows Server licensing models, one server license is required for each copy of the server software installed. In addition, a Windows Server 2003 Client Access License (CAL) is required for each user or device (or combination of both) that accesses or uses the server software. The same Windows Server 2003 Client Access License is used to access both Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 R2 servers.\n\nClient Access Licensing Requirements\n\nIn previous Windows Server licensing models, Windows Client Access Licenses were automatically triggered when particular server services were invoked (such as file, print, remote access, and terminal services, as well as authenticated access).\n\nWith Windows Server 2003, CALs are no longer triggered based on the use of certain services but are instead based on access to and/or use of the server software. This holds true for all editions of Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 R2, except Web Edition. Windows CALs are not required for Web Edition.\n\nNote the following general exception to Windows CAL requirements: Windows CALs are not required when access to the server software is unauthenticated and conducted through the Internet. Authenticated access is defined as an exchange of user or application credentials between the server software and a user or device. An example of this exception would be if unidentified users browsed your public Web site. Windows CALs would not be required for those users.\n\nDevice-based or User-based Windows Client Access Licenses\n\nThere are two types of Windows Client Access Licenses from which to choose: device-based or user-based, also known as Windows Device CALs or Windows User CALs. This means you can choose to acquire a Windows CAL for every device (used by any user) accessing your servers, or you can choose to acquire a Windows CAL for every named user accessing your servers (from any device).\n\nThe option to choose between the two types of Windows CALs offers you the flexibility to use the licensing that best suits the needs of your organization. For example:\n\nClient Access Licensing Modes\n\nAfter you have selected a license typeÂ—Windows Device CAL or Windows User CAL, you have the option to use the server software in two different modes: Per User/Per Device mode or Per Server mode. Both modes are available for either type of license.\n\nPer User or Per Device Mode\n\nPer User/Per Device mode is defined as follows:\n\nPer User/Per Device mode tends to be the most economical designation for Windows CALs in distributed computing environments where multiple servers within an organization provide services across most devices or users.\n\nNote that Per User/Per Device mode replaces Per Seat mode, used in previous licensing models.\n\nPer Server Mode\n\nPer Server mode is defined as follows:\n\nPer Server mode tends to be the most economical designation for Windows CALs in computing environments where a small number of servers have limited access requirements."
