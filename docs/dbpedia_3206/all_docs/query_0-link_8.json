It says it can't find the domain controller.\n\nI don't know what other info you guys might need but I'll try to provide it if you ask the questions.\n\nSorry, I just have to ask - why? I still have a Win95 PC on our network because the department uses a software package that has not been upgraded in years and they refuse to change.\n\nYeah, no kidding. If it's a Win95 license you need, pontifex, - shoot me a PM - I'd be happy to send you one.\n\nI know what it's like to work with non-profits and schools where budgets don't exist.\n\nEDIT: And yeah, I know the OP said not to ask why, but we still have a user running \"Q&A 4.0 for DOS\" on her Windows 2000 PC, which is connected to a 2003 Domain, so if it's a question of proprietary software I suggest you do some testing to find out what works!\n\nOriginally posted by: pontifex\n\nits a CNC laser machine that costs like $250,000 or $500,000 and was bought back in 2000 or 2001 and they still use 3.11 on it.\n\nOh wow.... I wouldn't trust something that expensive with Windows 3.11... but then again I probably wouldn't trust any Windows OS running on it!\n\nPerhaps the vendor has some insight?"
