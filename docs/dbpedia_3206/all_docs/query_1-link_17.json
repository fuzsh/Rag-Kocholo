Caveat emptor. If you don't trust a vendor, don't buy from them. If you do purchase and find a problem with the license then you can contact the Microsoft Anti-Piracy folks. Microsoft takes piracy very seriously. I personally have no experience in working with them, but I would imagine that they would help to address your issue in a fairly timely fashion."
