Microsoft seems to be taking it on the chin a lot, but really for such a large software company, I think they are doing a fairly good job at trying to define and structure their licensing with respect to today's virtualized infrastructure.

        "text": "To run Microsoft server software on a server, you must first assign the server a license. By assigning this license, you are designating a server to run an instance of Microsoft server software. In addition, you have the right to run as many instances on that server as the software allows-regardless of what kind of operating system environment (OSE) is present.\n\nThere are two types of OSEs: physical and virtual. A physical OSE is configured to run directly on a physical hardware system and can be physical and/or virtual. A virtual OSE is configured to run on a virtual-or otherwise emulated-hardware system. This distinction is vital to understanding how to license virtualization technologies; regardless of the type, each instance running requires a license.\n\nTo better understand the difference between physical and virtual OSEs, consider the following: Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard Edition permits one running instance at a time, while Enterprise Edition permits up to five-one instance running in a physical operating system environment and four instances running in a virtual OSE. If you choose to run five instances at a time under the Enterprise Edition license, the instance of the software running in the physical OSE may only be used to run hardware virtualization software and software to manage and service OSEs on the licensed server."
