        "text": "What is the relationship between Microsoft and Amazon Web Services?\n\nAmazon Web Services and Microsoft have worked together for several years, starting with AWS launching Windows Server based instances in 2008. AWS is a Gold Certified member of the Microsoft Partner Network and licensed to sell Microsoft software under the Services Provider License Agreement (SPLA). AWS is also an authorized license mobility partner. Over the years, AWS and Microsoft have collaborated to make Windows and its associated workloads available in the AWS cloud. Microsoft and AWS have mutual customers running Windows workloads on AWS today, including Dole Foods, Hess Corporation, and Lionsgate. In addition, AWS has released Microsoft-specific technologies that allow users to manage and optimize Windows applications in AWS – such as AWS tools for Windows PowerShell and EC2Rescue for EC2 Windows.\n\nIs Microsoft software supported on AWS?\n\nYes. AWS Support has been successfully supporting our customers who run Microsoft Windows-based EC2 instances in the AWS cloud since 2008 when we first launched Windows Server on EC2. Our support engineers have deep experience with Microsoft technologies on AWS including Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, Amazon RDS, Amazon Workspaces and others. Now AWS has further enhanced our support capabilities with a new additional direct engagement between AWS Support and Microsoft Support, to help ensure high quality support and issue resolution for our customers. To find more information on end of support (EOS) for Microsoft products go here.\n\nAWS is a member of the Microsoft Partner Network, licensed to sell Microsoft software under the Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA), and a Microsoft Gold Certified Hosting Partner. AWS is an authorized Microsoft License Mobility Partner and has an active Premier Support agreement with Microsoft.\n\nWhat is the expanded support agreement between Amazon and Microsoft, and how does it benefit me?\n\nFor customers that have purchased AWS Support at the Business or Enterprise tier, AWS Support is able to work directly with Microsoft support engineers to resolve issues related to customers running Microsoft Windows Server, SQL Server, or Windows desktop (via Amazon Workspaces) on AWS. As a result of this expanded support agreement, AWS can engage directly with Microsoft to create the best possible support experience. If necessary, AWS Support can escalate issues directly to Microsoft and work with dedicated Microsoft support engineers to help ensure issues are addressed and resolved.\n\nCan AWS open a support case with Microsoft on issues I might encounter?\n\nYes, AWS Support can work directly with Microsoft support engineers to escalate a support case if necessary to resolve issues encountered by AWS Support customers at the Business or Enterprise tier. AWS will not share any Customer information or specific details without your permission.\n\nHow does AWS work with Microsoft to resolve customer issues?\n\nCustomers who subscribe to AWS Support at the Business or Enterprise tier can submit issues through the AWS Support Center console. If the AWS Support Engineer finds that the problem is due to a Microsoft product or driver, the AWS Support Engineer can file a case with Microsoft and proceed with joint troubleshooting. The customer may be asked to document their authorization and permission for jointly engaging directly with Microsoft before AWS shares any Customer information or specific details.\n\nDoes the expanded support agreement between AWS and Microsoft cover all support issues related to my applications running on Windows Server or Windows desktop?\n\nIssues related to Microsoft products that are included with the purchase of an AWS Service (e.g. Windows Server or SQL Server with Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Elastic Container Service, or Amazon Workspaces) are covered under a customer’s AWS Support agreement. For software not purchased through AWS, AWS Support may help identify and resolve issues related to AWS Services, and, with your permission, work with Microsoft as necessary to troubleshoot the problem related to AWS Services.\n\nMicrosoft products that are outside of Microsoft’s End of Support dates are excluded from this expanded support offering.\n\nDoes the expanded support agreement between AWS and Microsoft replace my Microsoft support agreement?\n\nNo, this expanded support offering does not replace a direct Microsoft support agreement. This service provides assurance that issues that may arise between an AWS Service and Microsoft product (e.g., Windows Server, SQL Server, or Windows) will be investigated and remediated with the support of both companies. However, customers may run into other issues with their Microsoft applications that are separate from their AWS Services, and in this case customers should work directly through their Microsoft support relationship.\n\nAre there regional restrictions on accessing the benefit of the expanded Support agreement with Microsoft?\n\nNo, there are no regional restrictions to using this benefit.\n\nWhat types of Microsoft software can I run on AWS?\n\nYou can run many types of Microsoft software on AWS, including but not limited to: Microsoft Office, Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange, SharePoint, Skype for Business, Microsoft Dynamics products, System Center, BizTalk, and Remote Desktop Services. You can use license included instances that include the license for Windows Server and SQL Server on Amazon EC2 or Amazon RDS. AWS customers have the flexibility of bringing on-premises Microsoft volume licenses and deploying them on Amazon EC2 instances subject to Microsoft license terms. Beginning August 1, 2023, you can use your Microsoft 365 license with Amazon WorkSpaces services.\n\nHow do I import my own licensed machine image into AWS?\n\nIn order to BYOL of Microsoft software into AWS, you need to use the ImportImage tool made available by the EC2 VM Import/Export service. Do not use the ImportInstance tool as it does not support Microsoft BYOL scenarios.\n\nI've read in my licensing terms that certain licenses must be used on infrastructure that’s dedicated for my use. How does Amazon EC2 allow me to meet this requirement if I’m using my own licenses?\n\nAmazon EC2 offers two purchasing options that provide you with dedicated infrastructure: Dedicated Hosts and Dedicated Instances. It is important to note that most BYOL scenarios are supported through the use of Dedicated Hosts, while only certain scenarios are supported by Dedicated Instances.\n\nThere are specific BYOL scenarios that do not require Software Assurance or License Mobility benefits. EC2 dedicated infrastructure is always required in these scenarios. To be eligible, the licenses must be purchased prior to 10/1/2019 or added as a true-up under an active Enterprise Enrollment that was effective prior to 10/1/2019. In these specific BYOL scenarios, the licenses can only be upgraded to versions that were available prior to 10/1/2019.\n\nWhen you bring products that are licensed at the physical level only (e.g. Windows Server, certain SQL Server licenses, etc) Dedicated Hosts provide visibility into physical processor and core counts and are therefore the recommended deployment model.\n\nFor more information on Dedicated Hosts, visit the Dedicated Hosts detail page.\n\nFor more information on Dedicated Instances, visit the Dedicated Instances detail page.\n\nI've read in my licensing terms that a license cannot move to another region or physical machine for at least 90 days. How does Amazon EC2 help me meet this requirement if I’m using my own licenses?\n\nInstance Affinity (only available through the use of Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts) and Dedicated Host targeting helps you to monitor this requirement. When you enable Affinity between an instance and a Dedicated Host, that particular instance will only run on a specific Dedicated Host. Using Dedicated Host targeting, you can launch instances onto a specific Dedicated Host, giving you full control over how your licenses are used.\n\nFor more information on these features, visit the Dedicated Hosts detail page.\n\nWhen can I bring my own license using EC2 instances with default tenancy?\n\nLicense Mobility through Software Assurance allows customers to bring eligible Microsoft software licenses into AWS for use on EC2 instances with default tenancy. The AWS License Mobility Page is a great place to start the process. If you are planning to take advantage of License Mobility in AWS, you will need to fill out the appropriate License Mobility forms. With License Mobility, you can use these images on EC2 Windows Server license-included instances running on EC2 instances with default tenancy. Windows Server licenses must be purchased from AWS in this scenario.\n\nWhat is VM Import/Export?\n\nVM Import/Export enables you to easily import virtual machine images from your existing environment to Amazon EC2 instances. This service allows you to leverage your existing investments in the virtual machines that you have built to meet your IT security, configuration management, and compliance requirements by bringing those virtual machines into Amazon EC2 as ready-to-use instances. If you are planning to use your own Microsoft licenses, use the ImportImage tool made available by the VM Import/Export service to import your own Microsoft media.\n\nThe VM Import/Export service is available at no additional charge beyond standard usage charges for Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3.\n\nWhat is EC2's default tenancy?\n\nEC2 Dedicated instances and EC2 Dedicated Hosts provide instance capacity on physical servers that are fully dedicated for your use. Alternatively, EC2 offers instances with a tenancy of ‘default’ which run on physical servers that may host multiple isolated instances from different customers.\n\nWhat is dedicated infrastructure?\n\nDedicated infrastructure provides servers that are physically isolated for use by a single customer. Amazon EC2 has two dedicated infrastructure options: Dedicated Hosts and Dedicated Instances. If you bring existing licenses to Dedicated Hosts or Dedicated Instances, then you are using hardware that is fully dedicated to your use.\n\nWhat are Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts?\n\nA Dedicated Host is a physical EC2 server fully dedicated to you. Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors, including Microsoft, on Amazon EC2, so that you get the flexibility and cost effectiveness of using your own licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity and elasticity of AWS. With Dedicated Hosts, you have an option to control instance placement and gain visibility into the number of sockets and cores installed on a host. You can use these features to bring your own software licenses bound to virtual instances, sockets, or cores, including Windows Server, SQL Server, and SUSE Enterprise Server.\n\nDedicated Hosts are often used when customers bring license that do not have Software Assurance or License Mobility benefits. For more information on bringing licenses without Software Assurance or License Mobility benefits, please visit this section of the FAQ.\n\nPlease visit the Dedicated Host detail page for more information.\n\nHow can I manage EC2 Dedicated Hosts?\n\nYou can use AWS License Manager to simplify management of EC2 Dedicated Hosts. You can specify your Dedicated Host management preferences for host allocation and host capacity utilization in AWS License Manager. Once setup, AWS takes care of these administrative tasks on your behalf, so that you can seamlessly launch virtual machines (instances) on Dedicated Hosts just like you would launch an EC2 instance with AWS provided licenses. AWS License Manager helps track licenses used with Dedicated Host, and helps you stay compliant with your specified licensing rules such as 90 day affinity.\n\nWhat are Amazon EC2 Dedicated Instances?\n\nDedicated instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer. For more information on Dedicated Instances, please visit the Dedicated Instance page.\n\nWhat’s the difference between Dedicated Hosts and Dedicated Instances?\n\nBoth offerings provide instances that are dedicated to your use. However, Dedicated Hosts provide additional control over your instances and visibility into Host level resources and tooling that allows you to manage software that consumes licenses on a per-core or per-socket basis, such as Windows Server and SQL Server. In addition, AWS Config will keep a record of how your instances use these Dedicated Host resources which will allow you to create your own license usage reports.\n\nDoes AWS recommend an EC2 purchasing model if I want to bring my own licenses?\n\nIn order to take full advantage of EC2 it is recommended that customers first consider bringing eligible licenses through License Mobility. Default tenancy EC2 allows customers to scale capacity up and down according to changing needs. This allows customers to pay only for what they use. SQL is the most common product brought to AWS through License Mobility.\n\nAmazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts are ideal for products that are not eligible for License Mobility or for which active Software Assurance is not in place. For more information on bringing licenses without Software Assurance or License Mobility benefits, please visit this section of the FAQ.\n\nDedicated Hosts are most cost effective when the host is highly utilized and in a steady, non-variable state. A Dedicated Host will support the BYOL scenarios outlined in this FAQ and provide customers with more control and visibility over how their instances are placed, which is useful for minimizing risk and licensing costs in a BYOL scenario. Additionally, Dedicated Hosts support per-socket, per-core, VM, and CAL based licenses. Windows is the most common product brought to Dedicated Hosts.\n\nWhat are my options for bringing development licenses to AWS?\n\nAWS customers have options for bringing Microsoft developer products to AWS for use on test, development, and non-production workloads.\n\nPlease see this section for information on bringing Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) licenses.\n\nSQL Server 2022 Developer edition is available as a free download from Microsoft. Once downloaded from Microsoft, AWS customers can bring and install SQL Server 2022 Developer edition on Amazon EC2 instances. Dedicated infrastructure is not required for SQL Server 2022 Developer edition.\n\nCan I bring my own licenses (BYOL) to EC2 Bare Metal?\n\nYes. The EC2 BYOL options described throughout this FAQ are applicable to EC2 Bare Metal deployments. EC2 Bare Metal offers default tenant and dedicated host options. For more information on EC2 BYOL options, please click here.\n\nIs Windows Server eligible for BYOL on EC2?\n\nThere are three requirements for Windows Server to be eligible for BYOL on EC2:\n\n1. The licenses must be deployed on EC2 Dedicated Hosts.\n\n2. The licenses must have been purchased before 10/1/2019 (or added as a true-up under an agreement that was effective prior to 10/1/2019).\n\n3. The version was publicly available prior to 10/1/2019.\n\nSoftware Assurance is not a requirement for Windows Server BYOL.\n\nNote: Due to Microsoft licensing restrictions, Windows Server licenses purchased through the Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider Program (CSP) are not eligible for BYOL on AWS.\n\nWhat are Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts?\n\nA Dedicated Host is a physical EC2 server fully dedicated to you. Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors, including Microsoft, on Amazon EC2, so that you get the flexibility and cost effectiveness of using your own licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity and elasticity of AWS. With Dedicated Hosts, you have an option to control instance placement and gain visibility into the number of sockets and cores installed on a host. You can use these features to bring your own software licenses bound to virtual instances, sockets, or cores, including Windows Server, SQL Server, and SUSE Enterprise Server.\n\nDedicated Hosts are often used when customers bring license that do not have Software Assurance or License Mobility benefits. For more information on bringing licenses without Software Assurance or License Mobility benefits, please visit this section of the FAQ.\n\nPlease visit the Dedicated Host detail page for more information.\n\nHow can I manage EC2 Dedicated Hosts?\n\nYou can use AWS License Manager to simplify management of EC2 Dedicated Hosts. You can specify your Dedicated Host management preferences for host allocation and host capacity utilization in AWS License Manager. Once setup, AWS takes care of these administrative tasks on your behalf, so that you can seamlessly launch virtual machines (instances) on Dedicated Hosts just like you would launch an EC2 instance with AWS provided licenses. AWS License Manager helps track licenses used with Dedicated Host, and helps you stay compliant with your specified licensing rules such as 90 day affinity.\n\nHow can I control instance placements in the EC2 Dedicated Hosts?\n\nYou have the option to launch instances onto a specific Dedicated Host, or you can let Amazon EC2 place the instances automatically based on your licensing preferences in AWS License Manager. Controlling instance placement allows you to deploy applications to address licensing, corporate compliance, and regulatory requirements.\n\nCan I run multiple instance types on a Dedicated Host?\n\nYou can run different instance sizes within the same instance family on a Dedicated Host using AWS Nitro instance family. This allows you to maximize utilization of your Dedicated Host fleet as well as your software licenses.\n\nHow do I import and use my own Windows Server license?\n\nYou can bring in your own licensed copy of Windows Server media using the ImageImport tool made available by the EC2 VM Import/Export service. Once these images are imported, you can find them under the “my AMIs” section in the AWS Management Console or by using the DescribeImages API. You can then launch instances from your BYOL machine images onto Dedicated Hosts.\n\nVisit this link for more information on how to bring your own machine images into AWS.\n\nKeep in mind that when you choose to bring in your existing Windows Server licenses, you cannot utilize Windows Server AMIs that you purchase from AWS through license-included instances. You must bring in your own licenses using your own software media.\n\nHow do I track usage if I’m bringing my own licenses?\n\nUsing AWS Config as the data source and Dedicated Hosts as the platform to run BYOL instances, you can track BYOL usage against physical resources such as sockets and cores. Before you begin launching BYOL instances onto your Dedicated Hosts, ensure AWS Config has been enabled to record Dedicated Host changes. AWS Config keeps track of the configuration changes that occur on a Dedicated Host, including the instances and corresponding IDs of AMIs that ran on a Dedicated Host. These changes are paired with Host level data, such as the Host ID and the number of sockets and physical cores installed on a Dedicated Host. AWS Config will also keep track of instance tags. We recommend that you tag your instances with a meaningful identifier if you would like a human-readable way to identify BYOL instances in the AWS Config output. Visit this page for more information on AWS Config.\n\nHow do I determine the number of licenses of Windows Server to bring in?\n\nVisit the Dedicated Hosts detail page for information on the number of instances available per Dedicated Host. On this page you will also find the number of sockets and cores installed on each EC2 Dedicated Host. The instance, socket, and core counts vary by the instance type configuration of the Dedicated Host.\n\nDo I need to have Software Assurance on Windows Server on AWS?\n\nNo, if you are using Dedicated Hosts to bring your own Windows Server licenses, you do not need to have Software Assurance (SA). Windows Server licenses can be brought to Dedicated Hosts if the licenses were purchased prior to 10/1/2019 or added as a true-up under an active Enterprise Enrollment that was effective prior to 10/1/2019. In these specific BYOL scenarios, the licenses can only be upgraded to versions that were available prior to 10/1/2019. When you purchase Windows Server as license included instances from AWS, there is no need for you to have Software Assurance to cover those Windows Server licenses.\n\nHow do I run Windows Server on Dedicated Hosts after Microsoft’s licensing update announced in 2019?\n\nIn 2019, Microsoft updated the licensing terms for dedicated hosts cloud service. Based on the new licensing terms, you can bring your eligible Windows Server licenses to Dedicated Hosts if the licenses were purchased prior to 10/1/2019 or added as a true-up under an active Enterprise Enrollment that was effective prior to 10/1/2019. In these specific BYOL scenarios, the licenses can only be upgraded to versions that were available prior to 10/1/2019.\n\nIf you don’t have eligible Window Server licenses or if you want to run the latest versions of Windows Server offered after 10/1/2019, then you can use Windows Server AMIs provided by Amazon on Dedicated Hosts. This will allow you to continue using Dedicated Hosts for your Windows and SQL workloads. For more details refer to the pricing section for software usage on Dedicated Hosts.\n\nDoes License Mobility work with Windows Server?\n\nNo, as specified in the Microsoft Product Terms, Windows Server is not eligible for License Mobility. For more information on bringing licenses without Software Assurance or License Mobility benefits, please visit this section of the FAQ.\n\nHow can I use my own Windows Server license on EC2 instances with a default tenancy?\n\nWhen you deploy Windows Server licenses on Dedicated Hosts you will instances with a tenancy of ‘host’. You should not use your own Windows Server license on EC2 instances with default tenancy unless you have approval from Microsoft to do so. If you have negotiated custom terms with Microsoft and have this permission, please contact AWS support or reach out to your account manager.\n\nWhat is included when I buy Windows Server instances from AWS?\n\nAWS manages the licensing for you; all you need to do is pay for the instances you use. There is also no need to buy additional Windows Server CALs, as access is included in the price. Each instance comes with two remote connections for admin purposes only. If you require more than two connections, or need those connections for purposes other than admin, you may have to bring in additional Remote Desktop Services CALs for use on AWS.\n\nCan I relicense license-included, EC2 Windows Server instances to use my own licenses, pointing at my own KMS server?\n\nNo, you cannot relicense existing Windows Server EC2 instances or migrate existing Windows Server EC2 instances over to BYOL VMs. However, if you need to migrate from license-included to BYOL and have applications or OS configurations that need to be migrated, we suggest that you reach out to our partners, such as CloudEndure or AppZero, who may be able to assist with these types of migrations.\n\nIs license included Windows Server available on EC2 Bare Metal instances?\n\nYes, EC2 Bare Metal instances include the option to purchase Windows Server as license included from AWS. You can also use Windows Server License Included EC2 Bare Metal instances with 3rd party hypervisors such as Nutanix.\n\nCan I buy SQL Server from AWS?\n\nYes, you can utilize instances with SQL Server licenses included from AWS to run on either Amazon EC2 or Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). SQL Server Web Edition, Standard Edition, and Enterprise Edition are available for your use on both Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS.\n\nCan I bring in my own SQL Server licenses for use on AWS?\n\nYes. You can bring your own SQL Server licenses to AWS.\n\nSQL Server licenses with active Software Assurance\n\nYou can bring your SQL Server licenses with active Software Assurance to default (shared) tenant Amazon EC2 through License Mobility benefits. The AWS License Mobility Page is a great place for information on the process. Microsoft requires that customers complete and send a License Mobility verification form which can be downloaded here.\n\nSQL Server licenses without active Software Assurance\n\nSQL Server licenses without Software Assurance can be deployed on Dedicated Hosts if the licenses are purchased prior to 10/1/2019 or added as a true-up under an active Enterprise Enrollment that was effective prior to 10/1/2019. In these specific BYOL scenarios, the licenses can only be upgraded to versions that were available prior to 10/1/2019. For more information on Dedicated Hosts, please see this section of the FAQ as well as the Dedicated Hosts detail page.\n\nNote: Due to Microsoft licensing restrictions, SQL Server licenses purchased through the Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider Program (CSP) are not eligible for BYOL on AWS.\n\nCan I use License Mobility with SQL Server?\n\nYes. SQL Server licenses with active Software Assurance are eligible for License Mobility and can be deployed on default or dedicated tenant EC2. For additional details on bringing SQL Server licenses with active Software Assurance to default tenant EC2, please see the Microsoft License Mobility page on the AWS site.\n\nIt is also possible to bring SQL Server licenses without active Software Assurance to EC2 Dedicated Hosts. To be eligible, the licenses must be purchased prior to 10/1/2019 or added as a true-up under an active Enterprise Enrollment that was effective prior to 10/1/2019. For more information on EC2 Dedicated Hosts, please see this section of the FAQ.\n\nDo I have to pay for SQL Server passive failover?\n\nThere are various factors to consider when licensing passive failover for SQL Server. The information below pertains only to the SQL Server licenses and not the Windows Server licenses. In all cases, you must license Windows Server. For more information on SQL and failover server scenarios, visit this Microsoft SQL Server Licensing guide.\n\nUsing instances that include the license for SQL Server:\n\nCustomers purchasing SQL Server license included instances on EC2 must license passive failover instances.\n\nBringing SQL Server licenses with active Software Assurance to default tenant EC2:\n\nCustomers bringing SQL Server 2014 and later versions with Software Assurance to default tenant EC2 will license the virtual cores (vCPUs) on the active instance. In return, Software Assurance permits the customer one passive instance (equal or lesser size) where SQL Server licensing is not required.\n\nBringing SQL Server to Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts or Amazon EC2 Dedicated Instances\n\nSQL Server 2014 and later versions\n\nSoftware Assurance is required for SQL Server passive failover benefits on dedicated infrastructure. Customers bringing SQL Server with Software Assurance will license the cores on the active instance/host and are permitted one passive instance/host (equal or lesser size) where SQL Server licensing is not required.\n\nSQL Server 2008 – SQL Server 2012R2\n\nSQL Server 2008 -2012R2 are eligible for passive failover on EC2 dedicated infrastructure without active Software Assurance. In these scenarios, the customer will license the active instance/host, and is permitted one passive instance/host of equal or lesser size where SQL Server licensing is not required. Please click here for information on bringing SQL Server without active Software Assurance.\n\nHow do I know how many SQL Server licenses to bring in?\n\nIf you are licensing SQL Server under Microsoft’s License Mobility through Software Assurance, the number of licenses required varies based on the instance type, version of SQL Server, and the Microsoft licensing model you choose. To assist you with your virtual core licensing calculations under the Microsoft Product Terms, we provide a table here that shows the number of virtual representations of hardware threads based on instance type.\n\nIf you are using Dedicated Hosts, EC2 provides you with the number of physical cores installed on the Dedicated Host. Using this information, you can calculate the number of SQL Server licenses that you need to bring in. For additional information, we recommend referencing Microsoft documentation, such as the licensing guide for SQL Server 2019 (see here).\n\nWhat are the use cases for SQL Server Web Edition?\n\nThe Service Provider Use Rights (SPUR) state that SQL Server Web may be used to support public and Internet accessible web pages, web sites, web applications and web services. SQL Server Web may not be used to support line of business applications (e.g., Customer Relationship Management, Enterprise Resource Management and other similar applications). For addition information on use cases for SQL Server Web, please consult Microsoft or your Microsoft reseller.\n\nHow do I track usage if I’m bringing my own licenses?\n\nUsing AWS Config as the data source you can track configuration changes against physical resources such as sockets and cores. Before you begin launching BYOL instances onto AWS, ensure AWS Config has been enabled to record any changes. AWS Config keeps track of the changes that occur, including the instances and corresponding AMI IDs that ran. These changes are paired with Host level data, such as the Host ID and the number of sockets and physical cores installed. AWS Config will also keep track of instance tags. We recommend that you tag your instances with a meaningful identifier if you would like a human-readable way to identify BYOL instances in your AWS Config logs. Visit this page for more information on AWS Config.\n\nCan SQL Server 2022 Developer Edition be used on AWS?\n\nYes. SQL Server 2022 Developer Edition is available as a free download from Microsoft. SQL Server 2022 Developer Edition is eligible for use in non-production, development, and test workloads. Once downloaded from Microsoft, AWS customers can bring and install SQL Server 2022 Developer Edition on Amazon EC2 instances. Dedicated infrastructure is not required for SQL Server 2022 Developer Edition.\n\nAre SQL CALS required on AWS?\n\nCustomers using SQL Server on Amazon EC2 or Amazon RDS license included instances do not require client access licenses (CALs) for SQL Server. An unlimited number of end users can access SQL Server on a license included instance.\n\nCustomers bringing their own SQL Server licenses to Amazon EC2 through license mobility or bring your own licenses (BYOL), will continue to follow the licensing rules they have in place on-premises. If the customer purchased SQL Server under the Server/CAL model, they would still require CALs to meet Microsoft licensing requirements, but these CALs would remain on-premises and enable end user access SQL Server running on AWS.\n\nQ. What is Microsoft End of Support (EOS)?\n\nAccording to Microsoft, once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support.\n\nLong Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) Microsoft Lifecycle Policy offers 10 years of support (5 years for Mainstream Support and 5 years for Extended Support) for Business and Developer products (such as SQL Server and Windows Server). As per the policy, after the end of the Extended Support period there will be no patches or security updates.\n\nSemi-Annual Channel (SAC) Microsoft Lifecycle Policy offers 18 months of support from the date of public availability, which may be the same month, or month following the release date. As per the policy, no further security updates will be provided after the end of support.\n\nQ. How do I know if I’m using LTSC or SAC release?\n\nLTSC and SAC releases may share a common build number, but can be distinguished by the Windows Product Name. LTSC releases include the version in the product name, e.g. Windows Server 2019 Datacenter, while SAC product names do not, e.g. Windows Server Datacenter. The Windows Product Name can be returned by PowerShell using the Get-ComputerInfo cmdlet, example below.\n\nGet-ComputerInfo -Property WindowsProductName\n\nImages provided by AWS follow a standard naming convention in which the OS version immediately follows Windows_Server-* in an AMI’s name. LTSC versions are denoted by the 4 digit year of the release, e.g. Windows_Server-2019-*. SAC versions are comprised of the last 2 digits of the release year combined with the 2 digit month of the intended release, e.g. Windows_Server-1903-* (2019, March).\n\nQ. How does EOS affect my existing instances on Amazon Web Services (AWS)?\n\nThere is no direct impact to existing instances. Customers can continue to start, run, and stop instances.\n\nMicrosoft will not provide patches for EOS products, unless customers purchase Extended Security Updates.\n\nQ. Can I import images that contain EOS software into AWS using AWS tools?\n\nYes, customers can continue to import images to AWS using VM Import/Export (VMIE), Server Migration Service (SMS), or CloudEndure.\n\nQ. How does EOS affect Managed AWS Windows AMIs?\n\nThere is no direct impact to existing AMIs registered in customer accounts.\n\nAWS will not publish or distribute Managed AWS Windows AMIs that contain EOS software to AWS Management Console, Quick Start, or AWS Marketplace.\n\nCustomers with dependencies on Managed AWS Windows AMIs impacted by EOS should consider their options, including creating Custom AMI(s) within their AWS account(s) to enable new instance launches. Learn more about custom AMI creation here.\n\nQ. Can I launch new instances that include EOS software from my Custom Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)?\n\nYes.\n\nQ. Can I create additional Custom AMIs from existing Custom AMIs in my account that contain EOS software?\n\nYes.\n\nQ. What are my options for running Microsoft software that is approaching EOS?\n\nAWS customers running EOS software on EC2 instances have several options:\n\nRemain on EOS software: Customers may decide to remain on EOS software. There will be no impact to existing instances, or to custom AMIs.\n\nUpgrade and migrate to AWS (for Windows Server): For customers running workloads on EOS Windows Server on premises or on AWS, we offer AWS End-of-Support Migration Program (EMP) for Windows Server to assist with migration of such workloads to newer, supported Windows Server versions on Amazon EC2. This program offers technology and expert guidance to migrate applications running on Windows Server 2003, 2008, and 2008 R2. The EMP technology decouples the applications from the underlying OS, enabling AWS Partners or AWS Professional Services to migrate critical applications to a newer, supported version of Windows Server on AWS. For more information on the program and to sign up, visit the program webpage.\n\nAutomated upgrade: For customers with SQL Server 2008 R2 (or later) and Windows Server 2008 R2 (or later), AWS Systems Manager automates the performance of non-destructive in-place upgrades.

EMP eliminates the underlying OS dependencies by packaging the dependencies in the EMP package which can run as a self-contained setup on any newer version of Windows.\n\nQ: Should all legacy applications use EMP?\n\nSome applications will be compatible with newer version of Windows. For such applications, a simple upgrade of the underlying OS is generally the easiest path forward. EMP works best for applications that are incompatible with newer versions of Windows.\n\nQ. Can I purchase Extended Security Updates to cover instances that run on AWS, utilizing Microsoft EOS software?\n\nYes, Extended Security Updates (ESU) can be used to cover instances that run on AWS. ESU licenses are only available for purchase directly from Microsoft or a Microsoft licensing partner. For more information, please review Microsoft’s “Lifecycle FAQ - Extended Security Updates”.\n\nExtended Security Updates can be purchased on an annual basis for servers as needed up to a maximum of 3 years after a product's EOS date. The approximate cost of ESU for an EOS product is 75% of the annual license cost for the affected product. However, ESU only include security updates and bulletins rated \"critical\" for SQL Server, and those rated \"critical\" and \"important\" Windows Server, still leaving your software open to other potential vulnerabilities. We suggest that customers should consider all available options for EOS, see “What are my options for running Microsoft software that is approaching EOS?” for more information.\n\nRead more about Microsoft's Extended Security Updates here.\n\nWindows Server 2003\n\nExtended Security Updates available for purchase from Microsoft for Amazon License Included?

(Amazon Machine Image): Is a template for the root volume for the instance (for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications), manages launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances. Contains a block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it's launched.\n\nAWS (Amazon Web Services): offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services that help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale applications.\n\nAWS Management Console: access and manage Amazon Web Services through a simple and intuitive web-based user interface.\n\nBYOL (Bring Your Own License): is a process you can use to deploy software that you have previously licensed on physically dedicated AWS hardware. If you BYOL, you do not pay for instances with licensing included in the cost. Instead, you pay the same rate as EC2 instances with Amazon Linux pricing. When you BYOL, you are responsible for managing your own licenses.\n\nCloudEndure: offers reliable business continuity solutions that minimize data loss and downtime due to human errors, network failures, external threats, or any other disruptions. Our Disaster Recovery and Migration solutions are powered by innovative workload mobility technology, which continuously replicates applications from any physical, virtual, or cloud-based infrastructure into Amazon Web Services (AWS). As such, CloudEndure is uniquely qualified to support large-scale, heterogeneous environments with diverse applications and infrastructure.\n\nCustom AMI: is an AMI created in your account either built from an imported image or captured from an existing instance. For example, you can launch an instance from an existing AMI, customize the instance, and then save this updated configuration as a custom AMI. Instances launched from this new custom AMI include the customizations that you made when you created the AMI.\n\nEC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud): provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud.\n\nEMP (End-of-Support Migration Program) for Windows Server: program that helps customers with migration of their legacy Windows Server applications to the latest, supported versions of Windows Server on AWS, without any code changes.\n\nEOS (End of Support): is a term used to reference Microsoft ending support for a product, in accordance with their Product Lifecycle policy.\n\nHyperscale: refers to the facilities and provisioning required in distributed computing environments to efficiently scale from a few servers to thousands of servers. Hyperscale computing is usually used in environments such as big data and cloud computing.\n\nIn-Place Upgrade: upgrades the operating system files while your personal settings and files are intact.\n\nInstance (EC2 Instance): is a virtual server in the AWS cloud. Its configuration at launch is a copy of the AMI that you specified when you launched the instance.\n\nLI (License Included): refers to the use of Amazon's Microsoft Licensing Agreement for Windows Server and SQL Server.\n\nLTSC (Long Term Servicing Channel): is a release channel of Windows Server released once per 2-3 years with stability and long term support in mind. LTSC releases provide a predictable OS experience and provide 5 years of traditional support starting from initial release, plus an additional 5 years of extended support for security updates.\n\nVMIE (AWS VM Import/Export): is an AWS Service used to import Operating System Images to AWS EC2 in an offline mode.\n\nRDS (Amazon Relational Database Service): is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.\n\nSA (Software Assurance): is a comprehensive program offered by Microsoft to help deploy, manage, and use Microsoft products efficiently.\n\nSAC (Semi-Annual Channel): is release channel of Windows Server released twice per year with a limited support life cycle, ending 18 months from initial release. SAC releases allow customers to pilot the latest OS features quickly, but are not intended for long term use.\n\nSMS (AWS Server Migration Service): is an AWS Service used to import Operating System Images to AWS EC2 in an online mode.\n\nWorkSpaces (Amazon Workspaces): is a managed, secure cloud desktop service. You can use Amazon WorkSpaces to provision either Windows or Linux desktops in just a few minutes and quickly scale to provide thousands of desktops to workers across the globe."
