Microsoft first introduced an operating environment named Windows in November 1985 as an add-on to MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).[1] Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world's personal computer market, overtaking Mac OS, which had been introduced previously. At the 2004 IDC Directions conference, it was stated that Windows had approximately 90% of the client operating system market.[2] The most recent client version of Windows is Windows Vista; the most recent server version is Windows Server 2008.\n\nContents\n\n1 Versions\n\n1.1 16-bit operating environments\n\n1.2 Hybrid 16/32-bit operating environments\n\n1.3 Hybrid 16/32-bit operating systems\n\n1.4 32-bit operating systems\n\n1.5 64-bit operating systems\n\n2 History\n\n3 Timeline of releases\n\n4 Security\n\n4.1 Windows Defender\n\n4.2 Third-party analysis\n\n5 Windows Lifecycle Policy\n\n6 Emulation software\n\n7 License refunds\n\n8 See also\n\n9 References\n\n10 External links\n\nVersions\n\nSee also: List of Microsoft Windows versions\n\nThe term Windows collectively describes any or all of several generations of Microsoft (MS) operating system (OS) products. These products are generally categorized as follows:\n\n16-bit operating environments\n\nThe early versions of Windows were often thought of as just graphical user interfaces, mostly because they ran on top of MS-DOS and used it for file system services.[3] However, even the earliest 16-bit Windows versions already assumed many typical operating system functions, notably, having their own executable file format and providing their own device drivers (timer, graphics, printer, mouse, keyboard and sound) for applications. Unlike MS-DOS, Windows allowed users to execute multiple graphical applications at the same time, through cooperative multitasking. Finally, Windows implemented an elaborate, segment-based, software virtual memory scheme, which allowed it to run applications larger than available memory: code segments and resources were swapped in and thrown away when memory became scarce, and data segments moved in memory when a given application had relinquished processor control, typically waiting for user input. 16-bit Windows versions include Windows 1.0 (1985), Windows 2.0 (1987) and its close relatives, Windows/286-Windows/386.\n\nWindows OS market share Source Hitslink[4] Awio[5] XiTi[6] OneStat[7] Date September 2008 September 2008 August 2008 Mar 2008 All versions 90.29%[8] - 93.61% 95.94% Windows XP 68.67% 73.04% 71.22% 78.93% Windows Vista 18.33% 12.30% 18.99% 13.24% Windows 2000 1.89% 2.24% 1.56% 2.82% Windows 98 0.34% 0.59% 0.35% 0.58% Windows 2003 - 0.70% 0.82% - Windows NT 0.80% - 0.04% - Windows ME 0.19% 0.23% 0.15% 0.31% Windows CE 0.06% - 0.04% - Windows 95 0.01% - 0.01% - Windows other - - 0.42% -\n\nHybrid 16/32-bit operating environments\n\nWindows/386 introduced a 32-bit protected mode kernel and virtual machine monitor. For the duration of a Windows session, it created one or more virtual 8086 environments and provided device virtualization for the video card, keyboard, mouse, timer and interrupt controller inside each of them. The user-visible consequence was that it became possible to preemptively multitask multiple MS-DOS environments in separate windows, although graphical MS-DOS applications required full screen mode. Also, Windows applications were multi-tasked cooperatively inside one such virtual 8086 environment.\n\nWindows 3.0 (1990) and Windows 3.1 (1992) improved the design, mostly because of virtual memory and loadable virtual device drivers (VxDs) which allowed them to share arbitrary devices between multitasked DOS windows. Also, Windows applications could now run in protected mode (when Windows was running in Standard or 386 Enhanced Mode), which gave them access to several megabytes of memory and removed the obligation to participate in the software virtual memory scheme. They still ran inside the same address space, where the segmented memory provided a degree of protection, and multi-tasked cooperatively. For Windows 3.0, Microsoft also rewrote critical operations from C into assembly, making this release faster and less memory-hungry than its predecessors.\n\nHybrid 16/32-bit operating systems\n\nWith the introduction of the 32-bit Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Windows was able to stop relying on DOS for file management. Leveraging this, Windows 95 introduced Long File Names, reducing the 8.3 filename DOS environment to the role of a boot loader. MS-DOS was now bundled with Windows; this notably made it (partially) aware of long file names when its utilities were run from within Windows. The most important novelty was the possibility of running 32-bit multi-threaded preemptively multitasked graphical programs. However, the necessity of keeping compatibility with 16-bit programs meant the GUI components were still 16-bit only and not fully reentrant, which resulted in reduced performance and stability.\n\nThere were three releases of Windows 95 (the first in 1995, then subsequent bug-fix versions in 1996 and 1997, only released to OEMs, which added extra features such as FAT32 and primitive USB support). Microsoft's next OS was Windows 98; there were two versions of this (the first in 1998 and the second, named \"Windows 98 Second Edition\", in 1999). In 2000, Microsoft released Windows Me (Me standing for Millennium Edition), which used the same core as Windows 98 but adopted some aspects of Windows 2000 and removed the option boot into DOS mode. It also added a new feature called System Restore, allowing the user to set the computer's settings back to an earlier date.\n\n32-bit operating systems\n\nThe NT family of Windows systems was fashioned and marketed for higher reliability business use, and was unencumbered by any Microsoft DOS patrimony. The first release was Windows NT 3.1 (1993, numbered \"3.1\" to match the Windows version and to one-up OS/2 2.1, IBM's flagship OS co-developed by Microsoft and was Windows NT's main competitor at the time), which was followed by NT 3.5 (1994), NT 3.51 (1995), NT 4.0 (1996), and Windows 2000 (essentially NT 5.0). NT 4.0 was the first in this line to implement the \"Windows 95\" user interface (and the first to include Windows 95's built-in 32-bit runtimes). Microsoft then moved to combine their consumer and business operating systems. Windows XP, coming in both home and professional versions (and later niche market versions for tablet PCs and media centers), improved stability and backwards compatibility. Then, Windows Server 2003 brought Windows Server up to date with Windows XP. Since then, a new version, Windows Vista was released and Windows Server 2008, released on February 27, 2008, brings Windows Server up to date with Windows Vista.\n\nWindows CE, Microsoft's offering in the mobile and embedded markets, is also a true 32-bit operating system that offers various services for all sub-operating workstations.\n\n64-bit operating systems\n\nWindows NT included support for several different platforms before the x86-based personal computer became dominant in the professional world. Versions of NT from 3.1 to 4.0 variously supported PowerPC, DEC Alpha and MIPS R4000, some of which were 64-bit processors, although the operating system treated them as 32-bit processors.\n\nWith the introduction of the Intel Itanium architecture, which is referred to as IA-64, Microsoft released new versions of Windows to support it. Itanium versions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 were released at the same time as their mainstream x86 (32-bit) counterparts. On April 25, 2005, Microsoft released Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and x64 versions of Windows Server 2003 to support the AMD64/Intel64 (or x64 in Microsoft terminology) architecture. Microsoft dropped support for the Itanium version of Windows XP in 2005. Windows Vista is the first end-user version of Windows that Microsoft has released simultaneously in 32-bit and x64 editions. Windows Vista does not support the Itanium architecture. The modern 64-bit Windows family comprises AMD64/Intel64 versions of Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008, in both Itanium and x64 editions.\n\nHistory\n\nMain article: History of Microsoft Windows\n\nThe Windows family tree\n\nMicrosoft has taken two parallel routes in its operating systems. One route has been for the home user and the other has been for the professional IT user. The dual routes have generally led to home versions having greater multimedia support and less functionality in networking and security, and professional versions having inferior multimedia support and better networking and security.\n\nThe first version of Microsoft Windows, version 1.0, released in November 1985, lacked a degree of functionality and achieved little popularity, and was to compete with Apple's own operating system. Windows 1.0 is not a complete operating system; rather, it extends MS-DOS. Microsoft Windows version 2.0 was released in November, 1987 and was slightly more popular than its predecessor. Windows 2.03 (release date January 1988) had changed the OS from tiled windows to overlapping windows. The result of this change led to Apple Computer filing a suit against Microsoft alleging infringement on Apple's copyrights.[9][10]\n\nMicrosoft Windows version 3.0, released in 1990, was the first Microsoft Windows version to achieve broad commercial success, selling 2 million copies in the first six months.[11][12] It featured improvements to the user interface and to multitasking capabilities. It received a facelift in Windows 3.1, made generally available on March 1, 1992. Windows 3.1 support ended on December 31, 2001.[13]\n\nIn July 1993, Microsoft released Windows NT based on a new kernel. NT was considered to be the professional OS and was the first Windows version to utilize preemptive multitasking. Windows NT would later be retooled to also function as a home operating system, with Windows XP.\n\nOn August 24, 1995, Microsoft released Windows 95, a new, and major, consumer version that made further changes to the user interface, and also used preemptive multitasking. Windows 95 was designed to replace not only Windows 3.1, but also Windows for Workgroups, and MS-DOS. It was also the first Windows operating system to use Plug and Play capabilities. The changes Windows 95 brought to the desktop were revolutionary, as opposed to evolutionary, such as those in Windows 98 and Windows Me. Mainstream support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2000 and extended support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2001.[14]\n\nThe next in the consumer line was Microsoft Windows 98 released on June 25, 1998. It was substantially criticized for its slowness and for its unreliability compared with Windows 95, but many of its basic problems were later rectified with the release of Windows 98 Second Edition in 1999. Mainstream support for Windows 98 ended on June 30, 2002 and extended support for Windows 98 ended on July 11, 2006.[15]\n\nAs part of its \"professional\" line, Microsoft released Windows 2000 in February 2000. The consumer version following Windows 98 was Windows Me (Windows Millennium Edition). Released in September 2000, Windows Me implemented a number of new technologies for Microsoft: most notably publicized was \"Universal Plug and Play.\"\n\nIn October 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP, a version built on the Windows NT kernel that also retained the consumer-oriented usability of Windows 95 and its successors. This new version was widely praised in computer magazines.[16] It shipped in two distinct editions, \"Home\" and \"Professional\", the former lacking many of the superior security and networking features of the Professional edition. Additionally, the first \"Media Center\" edition was released in 2002,[17] with an emphasis on support for DVD and TV functionality including program recording and a remote control. Mainstream support for Windows XP will continue until April 14, 2009 and extended support will continue until April 8, 2014.[18]\n\nIn April 2003, Windows Server 2003 was introduced, replacing the Windows 2000 line of server products with a number of new features and a strong focus on security; this was followed in December 2005 by Windows Server 2003 R2.\n\nOn January 30, 2007 Microsoft released Windows Vista. It contains a number of new features, from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant technical changes, with a particular focus on security features. It is available in a number of different editions, and has been subject to some criticism.\n\nTimeline of releases\n\nRelease date Product name Current Version / Build Notes Last IE November 1985 Windows 1.01 1.01 Unsupported - November 1987 Windows 2.03 2.03 Unsupported - March 1989 Windows 2.11 2.11 Unsupported - May 1990 Windows 3.0 3.0 Unsupported - March 1992 Windows 3.1x 3.1 Unsupported 5 October 1992 Windows For Workgroups 3.1 3.1 Unsupported 5 July 1993 Windows NT 3.1 NT 3.1 Unsupported 5 December 1993 Windows For Workgroups 3.11 3.11 Unsupported 5 January 1994 Windows 3.2 (released in Simplified Chinese only) 3.2 Unsupported 5 September 1994 Windows NT 3.5 NT 3.5 Unsupported 5 May 1995 Windows NT 3.51 NT 3.51 Unsupported 5 August 1995 Windows 95 4.0.950 Unsupported 5.5 July 1996 Windows NT 4.0 NT 4.0.1381 Unsupported 6 June 1998 Windows 98 4.10.1998 Unsupported 6 May 1999 Windows 98 SE 4.10.2222 Unsupported 6 February 2000 Windows 2000 NT 5.0.2195 Extended Support until July 13, 2010[19] 6 September 2000 Windows Me 4.90.3000 Unsupported 6 October 2001 Windows XP NT 5.1.2600 Current for SP2 and SP3 (RTM and SP1 unsupported). 8 March 2003 Windows XP 64-bit Edition 2003 NT 5.2.3790 Unsupported 6 April 2003 Windows Server 2003 NT 5.2.3790 Current for SP1, R2, SP2 (RTM unsupported). 8 April 2005 Windows XP Professional x64 Edition NT 5.2.3790 Current 8 July 2006 Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs NT 5.1.2600 Current - November 2006 (volume licensing)\n\nJanuary 2007 (retail) Windows Vista NT 6.0.6001 Current.

Consumer versions of Windows were originally designed for ease-of-use on a single-user PC without a network connection, and did not have security features built in from the outset. Windows NT and its successors are designed for security (including on a network) and multi-user PCs, but are not designed with Internet security in mind as much since, when it was first developed in the early 1990s, Internet use was less prevalent. These design issues combined with flawed code (such as buffer overflows) and the popularity of Windows means that it is a frequent target of worm and virus writers. In June 2005, Bruce Schneier's Counterpane Internet Security reported that it had seen over 1,000 new viruses and worms in the previous six months.[21]\n\nMicrosoft releases security patches through its Windows Update service approximately once a month (usually the second Tuesday of the month), although critical updates are made available at shorter intervals when necessary.[22] In Windows 2000 (SP3 and later), Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, updates can be automatically downloaded and installed if the user selects to do so. As a result, Service Pack 2 for Windows XP, as well as Service Pack 1 for Windows Server 2003, were installed by users more quickly than it otherwise might have been.[23]\n\nWindows Defender\n\nOn January 6, 2005, Microsoft released a beta version of Microsoft AntiSpyware, based upon the previously released Giant AntiSpyware. On February 14, 2006, Microsoft AntiSpyware became Windows Defender with the release of beta 2. Windows Defender is a freeware program designed to protect against spyware and other unwanted software. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 users who have genuine copies of Microsoft Windows can freely download the program from Microsoft's web site, and Windows Defender ships as part of Windows Vista.[24]\n\nThird-party analysis\n\nIn an article based on a report by Symantec,[25] internetnews.com has described Microsoft Windows as having the \"fewest number of patches and the shortest average patch development time of the five operating systems it monitored in the last six months of 2006.\"[26] And the number of vulnerabilities found in Windows has significantly increased— Windows: 12+, Red Hat + Fedora: 2, Mac OS X: 1, HP-UX: 2, Solaris: 1.\n\nA study conducted by Kevin Mitnick and marketing communications firm Avantgarde in 2004 found that an unprotected and unpatched Windows XP system with Service Pack 1 lasted only 4 minutes on the Internet before it was compromised, and an unprotected and also unpatched Windows Server 2003 system was compromised after being connected to the internet for 8 hours.[27] However, it is important to note that this study does not apply to Windows XP systems running the Service Pack 2 update (released in late 2004), which vastly improved the security of Windows XP. The computer that was running Windows XP Service Pack 2 was not compromised. The AOL National Cyber Security Alliance Online Safety Study of October 2004 determined that 80% of Windows users were infected by at least one spyware/adware product.[28] Much documentation is available describing how to increase the security of Microsoft Windows products. Typical suggestions include deploying Microsoft Windows behind a hardware or software firewall, running anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and installing patches as they become available through Windows Update.\n\nWindows Lifecycle Policy\n\nMicrosoft has stopped releasing updates and hotfixes for many old Windows operating systems, including all versions of Windows 9x and earlier versions of Windows NT. Windows versions prior to XP are no longer supported, with the exception of Windows 2000, which is currently in the Extended Support Period, that will end on July 13, 2010. Windows XP versions prior to SP2 are no longer supported either. Also, support for Windows XP 64-bit Edition ended after the release of the more recent Windows XP Professional x64 Edition. No new updates are created for unsupported versions of Windows.\n\nEmulation software\n\nEmulation allows the use of some Windows applications without using Microsoft Windows. These include:\n\nWine - a free and open source software implementation of the Windows API, allowing one to run many Windows applications on x86-based platforms, including Linux. Wine is technically not an emulator but a \"compatibility layer\";[29] while an emulator effectively 'pretends' to be a different CPU, Wine instead makes use of Windows-style APIs to 'simulate' the Windows environment directly.\n\nCrossOver - A Wine package with licensed fonts. Its developers are regular contributors to Wine, and focus on Wine running officially supported applications.\n\nCedega - TransGaming Technologies' proprietary fork of Wine, designed specifically for running games written for Microsoft Windows under Linux.\n\nDarwine - This project intends to port and develop Wine as well as other supporting tools that will allow Darwin and Mac OS X users to run Microsoft Windows applications, and to provide Win32 API compatibility at application source code level.\n\nReactOS - An open-source OS that is intended to run the same software as Windows, originally designed to imitate Windows NT 4.0, now aiming at Windows XP compatibility. It has been in the development stage since 1996.\n\nLicense refunds\n\nIn 2006, a British man purchased a Dell Inspiron 640m laptop bundled with Microsoft Windows XP Home SP2 preinstalled, but did not accept Microsoft's End User License Agreement (EULA). In one week after his response, the customer received a \"goodwill\" refund of £ 47 (£55.23 including tax) from Dell for a no Windows option, as the copy of the system was an \"unused product\" according to the software license agreement. Dell had not asked for the installation medium to be returned and commented that although it doesn't have a Windows refund program, giving a refund in an individual case isn't forbidden either.[30][31][32]\n\nIn a civil suit Italian court rejected HP's argument that the licensing conditions had been set unilaterally by Microsoft and ruled HP to reimburse customer the amount of 90 € for unused Windows XP bundled with a Compaq notebook. The court was of the opinion that HP had to know about the conditions, because they most likely constituted part of the agreement between them and Microsoft. It also found the fact that computers without an operating system are available on the market to be irrelevant. According to Süddeutsche Zeitung, a German Dell customer replaced the preinstalled Windows with Linux and had been credited the amount of 78 euros for operating system and a further unspecified Microsoft program.[33] A French court ruled Acer to refund the purchase price of preinstalled laptop software, of which was 135.20 euros for Windows XP Home.[34]\n\nSee also\n\nGeneral:\n\nComparison of operating systems\n\nList of operating systems\n\nComparison of Windows versions\n\nComparison of Windows and Linux\n\nMicrosoft computers made for Windows\n\nFurther reading:\n\nArchitecture of the Windows NT operating system line\n\nCriticism of Microsoft Windows\n\nList of Microsoft Windows components\n\nMicrosoft Windows topics\n\nVisiOn\n\nWindows Explorer\n\nWindows Genuine Advantage\n\nWindows Media\n\nWindows Startup Process\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial Microsoft Windows Website\n\nMicrosoft Windows History Timeline\n\nMicrosoft Developer Network for Microsoft Windows programming\n\nComparison of Microsoft Windows versions\n\nMarket Share for June 2008[1] Total Windows - 89.89% Windows XP - 71.20% Windows Vista - 15.14% Windows 2000 - 2.11% Windows NT- 0.69% Windows 98 - 0.43% Windows Me - 0.25% Windows CE - 0.06% Windows 95 - 0.01% Non-Windows - 10.11%\n\nMicrosoft Windows is the name of several families of proprietary software operating systems by Microsoft.
