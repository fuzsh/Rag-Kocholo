        "text": "The list price for Windows Server 2003 will be identical to pricing for its predecessor Windows 2000, Microsoft said Monday.\n\nThe software giant released its pricing sheet for the new server, which comes in four editions and is slated to ship April 24. The prices are list prices and serve only as a foundation to calculate what enterprises under volume licensing deals will pay. Larger volume licensing customers can expect a reduction by upwards of 40 percent or more based on Microsoft’s new Licensing 6.0 program, which began last year.\n\n“Not changing the pricing makes sense after they raised the licensing fees,” says Laura DiDio, an analyst at the Yankee Group, in Boston. “I don’t think they are about to raise the price of the software especially since it is based mostly on Windows 2000. I mean, what’s new in there?”\n\nCritics have said the software amounts to a point release that includes native support for Microsoft’s .Net Framework, the runtime environment to support the company’s Web services initiative, and upgrades to Active Directory.\n\nWindows Server 2003 Standard Edition is priced at $999 and includes five client access licenses (CALs). The Enterprise Edition is priced at $3,999 and includes 25 CALs.\n\nThe new Web Edition of the server, which is designed exclusively for running Web sites, is priced at $399. It does not require any CALs, but the software is not available through all of Microsoft’s distribution channels. The company advises uses to contact their system builders, OEMs or resellers."
