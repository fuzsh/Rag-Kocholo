I found several on ebay and shady sites but i think are not valid in case of Microsoft comes.\n\nThanks\n\nYou have to buy Server 2016 license (it allows the license to be used for previous versions).\n\nBut do note if you are running on a virtualised environment, you need to license it based on the cores of the physical server…each license is for 16 cores, you need to buy more “core licenses” if the physical server CPU have more than 16 cores.\n\nFor many reasons I would recommend VMware ESXi for P2V and backup. I would boot the ESXi host using SD cards.\n\nThanks all of you for the replies.\n\nLooks like i can downgrade even from 2016 watching at the link that adrian_ych send. Says \" 2012 R2 or earlier\"\n\nI would prefer too Vmware ESXI over hyper-v but my maanger wont want to pay for it , so i am stuck with hyper-v (since its free , i already have Windows license paid)\n\nI will look into a 2008 R2 license. Any recommendation where to buy it Robert? In microsoft store i only see 2016 licenses."
