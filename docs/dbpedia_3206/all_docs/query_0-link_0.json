        "text": "Hi Spiceworks,\n\nWe have a legacy application system that uses about 6 servers running Windows Server 2003 Standard which were 1:1 licensed OEM with hardware purchased with Dell Poweredge servers they are on.\n\nThe business is unable to replace the proprietary legacy application hosted on these systems at this time, but they would like to virtualize the environment due to stability issues with the various (old) servers. We would also like to take advantage of ZFS on underlying VM host environment so we can easily snapshot, backup, restore, etc.\n\nSo my question is specifically towards licensing “back then” for Windows Server 2003 era and what would be allowed or proper for us to do now in order to P2V 6 servers into 1 VM host (or maybe 3 servers into 2).\n\nYes, but this would be far too expensive as based on the new CORE based licensing. We would just leave the systems licensed as is. 1:1 if that were the only way. It would not make sense in this case to pay for SERVER 2019 (which you would assume includes cost-of-development premiums for 2008, 2012, 2016, etc.) when we only intend to ever run Server 2003 on this specific group of systems.\n\nFrom what I’ve read it would seem we could buy and old retail version of:\n\nServer 2003 Enterprise (host up to 4 OSE server)\n\nServer 2003 Datacenter (host unlimited OSE’s per server)\n\nThe chances of a valid retail license of something that old existing are slim to none. Anything you find will almost certainly be used. In the US you can’t sell used licenses, so that would make them invalid.\n\nIf you want to be legit, the proper path is purchasing Server 2019. Yes, it will be expensive. But will it cost less than upgrading your legacy application?"
