        "text": "With Windows Server 2003 scheduled for its coming out party on April 24,\n\nMicrosoft Monday unveiled a pricing guide for the\n\nserver operating system.\n\nThe pricing guide is also a first look at the pricing for a new version of\n\nMicrosoft’s server operating system: Windows Server 2003 Web Edition. With\n\na suggested retail price of $399, the Web Edition is a bare bones version\n\nof the Standard Edition geared to serving Web pages. The edition does not\n\nrequire client access licenses (CALs) and features a 2G limit on memory and\n\n2-way symmetric multiprocessing (SMP).\n\nHowever, Microsoft noted that the Web Edition won’t be available in all\n\nchannels, suggesting customers should contact their system builders, OEMs\n\nor resellers for more information.\n\nFor the most part, the Microsoft’s licensing model for Windows Server 2003\n\nrequires customers to buy CALs in addition to the software. In a departure\n\nfrom its previous practice customers can buy CALs either for a designated\n\ndevice or a designated user. Previously, the CAL would be attached to a\n\nparticular computer. By offering CALs purchased for an individual user,\n\nMicrosoft is striving to be flexible in meeting customer demands by\n\nallowing users to access the server from multiple devices.\n\nMicrosoft is offering Windows Server 2003 Standard Server with five CALs\n\n(user or device) for $999, while the same edition with 10 CALs is going for\n\na suggested price of $1,199. both are 4G with 4-way SMP. It is offering its\n\nWindows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition — a replacement for its Advanced\n\nServer offering — with 25 CALs for $3,999.\n\nMicrosoft’s Windows Server 2003 Datacenter Edition will only be available\n\nthrough qualified OEMs, and the software giant did not release pricing\n\ninformation on that version.\n\nCustomers can also buy additional packages of CALs. Microsoft said that\n\n$199 will purchase a Windows Server 2003 Client Access License 5-pack,\n\nconsisting of five additional CALs. An additional 20 CALs go for $799.\n\nThere are also packages for Windows Server 2003 Terminal Server (TS) CALs;\n\n5 TS CALs go for $749 and 20 TS CALs for $2,669."
