        "text": "Microsoft DFSR offers performance that is not up-to-par with modern standards. Synchronizing files over a WAN is often sluggish, especially when numerous changes are being made in a small time frame. The system struggles to keep files fully in-sync. This is especially noticeable with large data sets but is also present with a relatively small amount of data.\n\nToday’s computer users are accustomed to real-time performance from their systems. Any file system that causes delays is going to be a source of frustration and productivity loss.\n\nAdditionally, many users complain about issues related to data scans. Typically, servers only synchronize file changes. However, they must periodically scan their files to ensure data integrity. This is often necessary when servers go offline for even a short period of time.\n\nFile system rescans can impact access performance. Users have also reported being unable to get systems back in sync after making changes to a sync partner (e.g. hardware upgrades).\n\nResearch indicates that 57% of organizations must have their mission-critical applications (one-third of all applications) back online within an hour of an outage. Other organizations aren’t far behind. Waiting for a slow and cumbersome rescan is simply not an option.\n\nMicrosoft’s solution does not lock files across distributed, synchronized servers when they are in use, or otherwise manage versions. This inevitably leads to file version conflicts where users are at risk of “stepping on” each other’s work.\n\nSince DFSR replicates files on multiple servers, each office or team may have its own copy of a given file. There’s nothing preventing files from being modified simultaneously, often unknowingly. DFSR’s remedy for addressing conflicts is to select one copy while moving the others to a “Conflicts and Deleted Folder” list. Although someone could look back and reconcile conflicts, this is a very inefficient and error-ridden arrangement.\n\nAll the above issues are complicated by difficulties with troubleshooting DFSR. Many users have found that the system is something of a “black box.” If it is working, it largely delivers on its promised value. However, when it isn’t working, DFSR is almost a complete mystery for users.\n\nAlthough DSFR is an included option of Windows Server, it isn’t considered a core product for Microsoft which makes support not always optimal. Microsoft’s website features pages of suggestions for troubleshooting common issues that paint one clear picture: trying to fix problems with DFSR is likely trying to solve a puzzle while wearing a blindfold.\n\nFurthermore, DSFR cannot be updated separately from the operating system, meaning you can’t elect to use a specific version of DFSR while updating Windows and vice versa. If multiple systems have different versions of Windows, they can only access the smallest common feature set."
