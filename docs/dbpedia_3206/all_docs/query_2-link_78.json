As an email server Exchange is a joke, and Exchange's other features don't appeal to open source/Free Software hackers at all. For example, the ability to tell when your colleague reads your message, or the ability to un-send a message, are concepts totally repulsive to your average open source contributor. </div></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>Bingo.<BR><BR>If they wanted it then they'd just use Exchange. People that don't like Exchange don't want to re-create it. <BR><BR>The deal is that Exchange is a groupware product. Groupware itself is one of those obsolete concepts that grew out of limited NetBiue-style networks. They thought it would be a good idea that you have one monolythic service that will provide all your business needs. Messaging, document handling, etc etc. So there is all this massive amount of functionality smooshed into one single product.<BR><BR>Not very many people want to re-create that. OSS folks tend to come from a Unix-like background with TCP/IP-style networks were you deal with lots of specialized servers.<BR><BR>If you look around you can find 'Exchange alternatives' like O-xchange or Zimbra<BR>http://wiki.samba.org/index.ph..._Server_Alternatives<BR><BR>But generally speaking...<BR><BR>So, for example, if you want email, then simply deploy a IMAP server and a SMTP server. To go along with that you can deploy a LDAP server for centralized database for tracking users. This sort of thing generally outperforms any Exchange system at a fraction of the cost. It's not easy, but email is a huge PITA no matter what you do, but it's cheap and option for anti-spam and such is very effective. <BR><BR>Lots of webmail options...<BR><BR>Need a way to do quick messaging and away notifications? Jabber.<BR><BR>Need a way to provide company information from different departments to everybody inhouse? A intranet with a decent CMS works well. <BR><BR>All sorts of different forums software is avialable. <BR><BR>You can manage documents using regular file sharing or webdav. Nowadays even open source programs like O rg have the ability to do collaberation with various extensions and whatnot. <BR><BR>It all depends on your business needs and this is why there is no 'standard package' to do all this stuff with. Everybody creates a custom solution based on their own needs rather then forcing their business to conform to some monolythic application.<BR><BR>That's not to say that everything is all happy and wonderful, of course. I think that Calendering is one major thing that people are missing. <BR><BR>-----------------------<BR><BR>Besides the lack of a Exchange alternative there is enough problems with the Linux desktop and things like OpenOffice.org and the difficulty of replicating Active Directory-like functionality with Linux desktops is holding back adoption in a big way.<BR><BR>If your stuck using Windows desktops and Microsoft Office then nothing compares to Windows Servers in terms of integration and support. Everybody else is a minor player. When you (in this example Microsoft) controls the platform your users are using then they can very effectively dictate the software your going to run on the server. <BR><BR>In other words: Microsoft Office means Microsoft Windows. Microsoft Windows means your running Microsoft Server. Microsoft Server means Active Directory and other Microsoft services. If your running Microsoft Office and your running Microsoft Server then it's a no-brainer for most people just to run Microsoft Exchange.\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><div class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote-title\">quote:</div><div class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote-content\">Originally posted by Nothinman:<BR><BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><div class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote-title\">quote:</div><div class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote-content\"> Seems like the client is more or less there already with Thunderbird. </div></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>Not really. A huge aspect of Outlook/Exchange is the calendar integration and sharing so until there's a mail server with calendaring like Exchange and Thunderbird fully supports it there is no alternative. </div></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>There are always alternatives, else Windows couldn't have been viable to replace some subset of single-application Unix workstations that had much more functionality.<BR><BR>In the end, the market decides if an option has the required functionality or not. So far, no <B>single, integrated, open source solution</B> has come close to a critical mass of mindshare to begin to compete with Exchange, Notes, and Groupwise. As individual pieces, open source MTAs, MUAs, LDAs, directories, CMSes, and calendering solutions are extremely popular. Zimbra might be the farthest ahead with an integrated, branded solution, but they aren't remotely close to any tipping point yet.<BR><BR>Open source solutions tend not to be centralized and they tend not to suffer so much from feature creep; more frequently they are combined. For any given piece you might use in FOSS mail/groupware package, some other package would be a viable competitor. In fact, the way to go is not to specify the solution end to end, but the protocols and standards.<BR><BR>Mail in and out: SMTP<BR>Client content retrieval and manipulation: IMAPv4, HTTP (web interface), POP3<BR>Directory: LDAP<BR>Collaboration: HTTP, WebDAV<BR>Calendering: iCalender (RFC2445), HTTP<BR><BR>So the server solution doesn't confin you to Outlook for calendering, you use any iCalender client (which happens to include Apple, Google, IBM/Lotus, Microsoft, Novell, and Sun solutions as well as a dozen open source apps). Maybe your IT department picks one to support, but they still have a lot of iCalender protocol options if they want to migrate from Windows to OS X in the future (or Linux to Sun Ray for that matter).<BR><BR>There's still a ton of room for integrators and support organizations to build and tune full solutions from existing open source pieces, it just hasn't happened a lot yet.\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><div class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote-title\">quote:</div><div class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote-content\">Originally posted by BlackHex:<BR>Implementing all of the above in a good form is a huge task, and requires a level of vision and direction the OSS world is not known for. And even if they built it it would only gain useful traction if almost the entire OSS world agreed to use it. </div></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>Your acting like Exchange is god's own MTA. All users care about is the pixels on the screen, they couldn't really give a crap what else is going on even though they'll tell you otherwise.<BR><BR>Exchange sucks, Outlook sucks, but once people are used to how something works, how something looks, then they have a huge amount of resistance to any change. That is a reality that nobody can do anything about and it's a very tough nut to crack. Inertia is the best word for it. <BR><BR><BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><div class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote-title\">quote:</div><div class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote-content\">That fits the needs of a large amount of organizations out there. Linux market share on the desktop would probably soar. There are a LOT of users out there who just need to use Word, Excel and Outlook. We already have the Word and Excel part taken care of. Then, once the market share starts bumping up from the light users, more development might start for the specialized applications. </div></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>It's the whole package.<BR><BR>A low-skilled tech can go and purchase a hundred Dell boxes, get a Windows Server or two, and throw together a entire \"Domain\" in a weekend of work. Very strong Kerberos authentication, LDAP directory server, email, messaging, calendering, file sharing, remote configuration, user management, etc etc. They don't have to know about how any of it works or even what the authentication protocol is called. They just throw it all together and everything is pre-configured to work together. Most of the work is already done by Microsoft long before any end user touches it. <BR><BR>In comparison a average tech person working with Linux for the first time is going to spend weeks farting around with Sendmail until they realize that it's shit and strip it out of their Redhat boxes for something like Postfix. Then another weekend spent learning about mail and getting all that working. And that is just one tiny piece of the puzzle. <BR><BR>I mean everything works together just fine. You can do most anything with Linux that you can do with Windows. <BR><BR>But.. <BR><BR>For example: LDAP. LDAP isn't very difficult to deal with. Like anything making it 'enterprise' requires a lot of work, but all software is like that. Working with it isn't very difficult, fundamentally. But the simple fact of trying to configure it to get OpenLDAP _going_ is terrifically difficult. A lot of people play with something like OpenLDAP can't get past just getting the stupid thing to work, then give up completely.<BR><BR>---------------------------------<BR><BR>So until we can get something like a 'Ubuntu Server' and stick that on a network with it's default configurations, and then throw a ubuntu install cdrom on 2 dozen PCs and have a working Linux-based domain 45 minutes later (that works with Windows, too, btw) ... then Linux isn't going to beat Windows on the Desktop. (and even then it's not going to beat it, but it can give it a much better chance)<BR><BR>If we can get that then that gives people something to really work with. Get something that 'just works'. As in completely automatically. <BR><BR>Then you can use that as a basis for extending it to make it work in your organization and doing more complex things. Having a good default, working, configuration administrators is critical. It provides a nice basis for, a 75% solution, that you can then really sink your teeth into and get working. <BR><BR>-----------------------------<BR><BR>It's like Ubuntu vs Debian. Debian provides almost all the software that Ubuntu uses, already tested, already packaged. Gnome usability improvements are due in huge part to Novell's work on it. OpenOffice.org is from Sun. etc etc. What Ubuntu actually creates, in terms of improvements and software, is tiny compared to Redhat and is even minor compared to what Debian does. <BR><BR>But for a very long time the default configuration you'd get from Debian was virtually unusable. It required a lot of work just to get it to work well. Ubuntu got a crapload of attention because they were the ones that finally were able to perform the configuration and tweaking that made Debian usable by a much wider audience. The good default Ubuntu install is the \"magic\" that they were able to do to get so much attention in a short time, when other people like Suse have been plodding around for years. <BR><BR>And that's not me trying to downplay Ubuntu or saying Debian does all the work or whatever... making software work for and actually be usable by a large number of diverse users is terrifically difficult.\n\nThe amount of ignorance that always shows up on this topic is simulanteously overwhelming and depressing.
