        "text": "Introduction\n\nOver the last couple of years, Microsoft Windows Server licensing has undergone many changes and adjustments. The different license models provided through License Intelligence Service (LIS) reflect these changes with a dedicated license model for each state. The question, which license model is the right one for your license compliance depends on your purchase history and possible transformations based on the development of your relevant volume license agreements with Microsoft.\n\nThe name of each license model provides the information to allocate it in the history of Windows Server licensing terms.\n\nNaming convention is: <Windows Server Edition> <product version with which terms have become effective> | <metric> ([SPLA]; <valid virtualization policy>; <license mobility policy>)"
