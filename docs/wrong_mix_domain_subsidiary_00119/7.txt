DESCRIPTION This <strong>Retrofit</strong> <strong>Panel</strong> <strong>Retrofit</strong> Adapter allows the user to install a small panel meter (such as Electro Industries, Schneider/Square D, SATEC or Siemens) into any switchboard panel. The installation can be done in minutes without de-energizing the circuit or re-wiring anything. Easy installation translates into lower labor costs, which makes the meter upgrade feasible for many applications. With this solution, you can cost-effectively offer your customer the newest metering technology without shutting down their circuit or being concerned about miss-wiring or handling asbestos wiring. Once this adapter has been installed, your customer will have the benefit of easily upgrading the metering in the future.
