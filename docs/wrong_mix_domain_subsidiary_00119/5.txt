Notes:

Beware that a company may be listed under it's abbreviation ('IBM') but also under it's full name ('International Business Machines') so when you want to make sure, check both places.

These listings should cover about 99% of all chip manufacturers by now, so it will be very appreciated by me and 100,000's of your colleagues all over the world when you would email me about anything that should be changed or added.

California ASIC is a full service supplier of gate arrays.

California ASIC specializes in FPGA to gate array conversions as well as standard gate array developments.

Regarding your article on obsolete parts, we at California ASIC specialize in manufacturing low volumes of obsolete parts. 1000 parts is normally the minimum that makes economic sense.

We retarget these chips to one of our CMOS processes and then deliver them directly to the customer.

Semiconductor die and wafers

Semiconductor distributor and value-added processor of die and wafers for multichip modules, hybrids and other unencapsulated applications. Specialists in Known Good Die (KGD) processing.

World's largest distributor of bare die. We have contracts with 20 semiconductor manufacturers to process and distribute their wafers and die. We have saw, visual, wafer probe and 100%/burn in (Known Good Die) capability. We also do small lots (thousands) of hermetic assembly and test (when the manufacturer does not offer a particular die/package combination). We have three TAB bonders on line which we use for our patented SofTAB known good die (TAB leads are removed after test and burn in, leaving 100% tested bare die) and also for display drivers and other TAB applications.

We have shipped more KGD than anyone else besides Intel and we started shipping KGD years before they did! I'm sure some of your visitors are interested in a competent, professional bare die distributor and KGD processor.

Products:

CompuLab manufactures 'all-in-one' components for embedded systems based on Intel's i80960Hx and i80960Jx processors. A single 208-pin QFP component integrates a DRAM controller, a flash controller, UART(s), SPI, reset with watchdog, parallel ports, a programmable chip-select generator, a bus arbiter, DMA(s) and other functions essential for embedded systems.

The C39601 / C39602 'all-in-one' System Solution chip provides an easy and economical way to implement a high- performance computer sub-system for embedded applications. The C39601/2 comprises a comprehensive set of control and interface functions. Together with an i80960H CPU and memory components, the C39601/2 implements a complete 32-bit embedded RISC computer.

Outstanding performance and a high level of integration makes the C39601/2 the best choice for the implementation of embedded cores into applications such as laser printer engines, network routers, LAN switch management, protocol analyzers and many others.

About the company:

CompuLab is an innovative hi-tech company located in Israel. The company develops hardware products, provides design consultancy and performs research. It was founded as a response to the growing demand of the computer industry for shortened development cycles with uncompromised quality and reliability. Since its establishment in 1992, CompuLab has designed many products and cards in the areas of high speed computer boards, LAN, PCI and others. More than 30 products have been developed so far. In the beginning of 1997, CompuLab introduced the CORE Module Product Line

Products developed and manufactured by CompuLab are used by international companies such as CISCO, OKI and SIEMENS.
