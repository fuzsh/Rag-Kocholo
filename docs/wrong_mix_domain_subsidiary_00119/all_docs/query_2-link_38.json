        "text": "Global Electronics Companies Continue to Standardize on\n\nMIPS Technologies? Flexible Embedded Architectures\n\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., October 11, 2000 MIPS Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: MIPS, MIPSB), a leading provider of industry standard processor architectures and cores for digital consumer and network applications, today announced Micron Technology has licensed the MIPS32 4Kc? and MIPS64 5Kc? synthesizable processor cores.\n\nAs one of the leading architectures in the embedded market, the MIPS RISC architecture is well positioned to help drive the explosion in consumer electronic applications, such as personal digital assistants, digital TVs, game systems and smart cards. Designers using MIPS products are able to use the latest in cutting-edge processor cores that feature robust instruction sets and scalability from 32-bits to 64-bits. Also, designers benefit from support by numerous MIPS licensees and access to a broad community of MIPS software development partners (reference press release announcing the MIPS Alliance Program dated September 26, 2000).\n\n?Licensing processor cores from MIPS enables Micron to pursue technologies combining our DRAM memory and logic,? said Dean Klein, Micron?s vice president of Integrated Products. ?Micron?s strategy is to enable our customers to embed the MIPS processor cores with Micron memory. Micron?s high density embedded DRAM, combined with the flexible performance and low-power options of the MIPS cores, will allow our customers to develop innovative system-on-a-chip solutions targeting applications such as graphics, Set Top Boxes, voice recognition systems, and peripheral, communications, consumer and networking applications requiring quick access to large amounts of memory.?\n\n?This agreement with Micron, a worldwide leader in memory products, together with recent license wins with other best-in-class global electronic companies, is evidence of the industry standardizing on the MIPS architecture platform,? said Derek Meyer, vice president of worldwide field operations for MIPS Technologies. ?By developing the broadest range of IP in the embedded processor market, MIPS gives customers the choice between hard and synthesizable cores, instruction set architecture licenses and application-specific extensions. As a result, MIPS? licensees provide well over 100 different types of processors-based products available today.?\n\nMeyer continued, ?This agreement is also a significant milestone for our growing European team that will be supporting Micron?s design group in the UK with the aid of the MIPS Denmark Design Center (MDDC) in Copenhagen, Denmark.?\n\nAbout MIPS Technologies, Inc.\n\nMIPS Technologies, Inc. is a leading provider of industry standard processor architectures and cores for digital consumer and network applications. The company drives the broadest architectural alliance that is delivering 32- and 64-bit embedded RISC solutions.
