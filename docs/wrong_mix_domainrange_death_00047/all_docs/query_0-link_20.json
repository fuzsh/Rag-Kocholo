        "text": "OTHER BORTHWICKS IN THE USA\n\nThis page contains a collection of bits and pieces of Borthwick data, shared by many others, colunteered by Borthwick researchers or collected by me. Much of the information has been obtained from online databases or has been provided to me by generous genealogists from their own research.\n\nI have not yet worked out the best way to sort this material on-line - by State, by County, by subject, etc? So please use the Find facility in your web browser to check for specific names and details.\n\nThe page is structured as follows:\n\nSECTION 1: This first section contains information arranged by subject:\n\nAmerican Casualties at Pearl Harbor\n\nWho Was Who in America?\n\nBorthwicks on North American Vital Records Index (LDS CD)\n\nCongregation of the Regent House\n\nLand Records from Rootsweb Databases\n\nCivilian Draft Registration Database Records\n\nDiaries of William S Borthwick\n\nIt is worth noting here that on a separate page of this site you will find Borthwicks in the 1880 US census.\n\nSECTION 2: The second section of the page contains Borthwick data State by State, or County by County, in alphabetical order:\n\nArizona\n\nCalifornia\n\nIllinois\n\nKansas (and Iowa)\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNew York State, including Delaware County, NY\n\nWisconsin\n\nSECTION 3: At the end of the page is a section for Lost Borthwicks in the USA. If you too are looking for lost Borthwicks in the USA let me know and I'll post your query on this page.\n\nOld Fettesians\n\nAlexander Borthwick Liddle\n\nI have included negative results for various searches as this may save time for others (if you are prepared to trust my research - no guarantees!)\n\nIf you have any Borthwick data that you'd like to share I would be very pleased to add it to this collection. And if you are looking for Borthwicks with US connections I would be happy to post a plea on this page under Lost Borthwicks.\n\nSECTION 1 - DATA BY SUBJECT\n\nAmerican Casualties at Pearl Harbor\n\nOn-line searchable data base - no Borthwicks.\n\nWho Was Who in America?\n\nThe 1607-1996 index for \"Who Was Who in America\" lists Harry Alfred Borthwick as being in Volume 6 (1974-1976) and John David Borthwick as being listed in the Historical Volume.

They planted many trees and had an orchard. Fred worked in the Kimaball and Farnsworth Bank in Cresco. Fred C. and his brother George Borthwick moved to Ness City Kansas in 1885, where they opened a Bank, one of the first in Ness County. Brother George Borthwick loaned the famous negro scientist, George Washington Carver money on his homestead near Beeler Kansas in order for him to go to college in Iowa.\n\nJames F.

Descendant Murray Borthwick advises that Alexander Borthwick emigrated to Canada, arriving in Halifax Nova Scotia on 28 March 1905 and went to Toronto, Ontario.The shipping manifests show that Alex Borthwick, age 33, Mrs Borthwick, age 33, William age 4 and Cameron an infant, were passengers on the vessel \"Laurentian\" embarking on March 17 from Glasgow, Scotland and Londonderry, Ireland bound for Boston as a final destination by way of Halifax. Later, branches of this family moved to Detroit, Michigan.\n\nDeath Notices, Detroit Newspapers recently included a notice for a family with Borthwick connections. Kenneth W Stevens who died on March 18, 2002, had nephews Clarence Borthwick and James Borthwick. Are they descendants of the Alexander Borthwick and Mary Isabelle Lawson family?\n\nNEW YORK STATE\n\nIn 1902 Halsey Borthwick wrote \"There is in Brooklyn, another family of which John Wilson Borthwick was the head. He was born in Scotland (not far from Borthwick Castle) about 1817; and had six children: Ann, Alexander, John, Mary, Robert and Margaret. Alexander was born 14th Feb 1843; married 29 April 1867; and died 25th July 1890; he had nine children of whom three boys and four girls are living (two of those are Alex T and Helen Borthwick; 929 Kent Ave Brooklyn, NY). John Borthwick went from Brooklyn to Virginia in 1876. Margaret Borthwick married a Mr Henderson; she has three children and lived in Newark, NY. Robert and Mary died in childhood; and Ann died at the age of twenty-six.\" The source for this information was a letter from Helen Borthwick.\n\nIf any reader is descended from this family, or knows of them, I would be pleased to hear. On the US passenger lists there is a John Borthwick arriving in Virginia in 18??. Was this the same John or perhaps a relative of his?\n\nFollowing is some other data about Borthwicks in New York.\n\n1.
