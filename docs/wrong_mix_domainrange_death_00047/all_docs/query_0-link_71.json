Randy was born on August 16th, 1958 in Eldorado, Kansas to Shirley (Smith) and Mason Linden. The family moved to Independence when Randy was a young boy. He would attend and later graduate from Independence High School in 1976. After graduation, while working for Don Kendrick, Randy attended a trade school in Chicago, IL for wheel alignment and mechanics, receiving his certification. After completion he continued working for Don Kendrick's Service Station for several years, then moving on to Layton Oil Company. He became the owner/operator of Don Vining Rentals (1984) and later owner/operator of Quality Wrecker at the time of his passing. Randy was a beloved son, husband, father, papa, brother, uncle and friend to many. He had one of the biggest hearts and gave his family and friends great laughs with his witty sense of humor. (Just ask his kids about the car rides to school). His personality was unique to say the least and loved by many. There wasn't much he wouldn't do for anyone needing something. Randy was the meaning of a hard working man, always providing for his family. He was always busy with something, fixing it or repairing it to make it work perfectly, and knew just where everything was. There wasn't much he didn't know how to do or would at least keep trying it until he got it just right. He loved anything outdoors and had a love for fast cars. His favorites of course were hunting and fishing. He always seemed to have a fishing pole with him and knew just where to stop anytime of day to get one or more good catches in. Randy is survived by his loving wife Angela Gerstenkorn and two children Mathias \"Matt\" Linden (Charity) and BreAnna \"Bre\" Wren (Justin).

No services are planned at this time. \"I see you there atop a rise that overlooks a sun-touched plain, the howling gale of a rolling storm now behind your back. I watch you move through ebbing blades of incandescent waves of grain, the wind now a soft breeze that sings upon the grass along your newfound track. A crimson dawn beyond hums with shafts of light that cut through the lines of rain, and the warm rays that prove gentle touch push back the clouds of grey and black. A song that plays for journeys to come, a melody absent a weight of weary travelers' pain, to shepard those memories lived to that somber place beyond the horizon's crack. To show those left behind to endure that storm a course to navigate that narrow lane, their souls soon to come up into that wind with miles aback. To find you there in the curious beyond when their time has wane, to hear the sound of a hopeful dawn and the song which calls us all back.\" - Nick Woolsey\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nAlta \"Pinky\" Lewis - May 20, 1944 - March 30, 2023\n\nDeparted: 03/30/2023 (Independence)\n\nObituary Preview: Pinky Lewis, 78 of Independence passed away March 30th, in her home surround by her children.

Regardless of the demands before her, she would dig in and help: with the paperwork if you needed to meet some deadline or accomplish some tasks. She’d sit by your bedside for hours and comfort you with conversation or silence if you were sick. Vettra passed, Wednesday, January 18, 2023, of cancer shortly after being admitted to the University of Oklahoma Medical Center in Oklahoma City. She was born to Sammie Ford and Kathleen (Owens) in Coffeyville April 10, 1957. Her first school was Cleveland School, but she lived in several places as she grew up. Attended high schools in Herndon Virginia, El Paso Texas and Independence Sr High. She was, by profession, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. She graduated with a bachelor’s in social work from Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kansas, then onto to advanced degrees: Master of Arts in Child, Family, and Community Services from the Southern Illinois School of Medicine and Master of Social Work from the University of Kansas. She taught social work at the University of Kansas as an adjunct professor, as well as at the Kansas City Community College. She mainly worked as a private contractor for both state government and private entities. She was licensed to practice in Kansas, Virginia, and South Carolina. She loved helping people and during her more than 40-year career helped countless clients improve their lives. She has one daughter, Asia Ford, of Cincinnati, Ohio. She was preceded in death by her parents, —by two brothers: Sammy Ford, Jr and Otto Lewis, Jr, —by two sisters: Mavis Lewis Scott and Elaine Ford Staton. Elaine passed December 26, 2022, at the age of 94. Elaine and Vettra were very close in life. Living siblings include sisters Peggy Lewis Kennedy of Douglasville Georgia and Denise Ford of Midwest City Oklahoma. And brothers Donald Lewis of Phoenix Arizona, Albert Dean Lewis of Kokomo Indiana, Jesse Dixon of Port Saint Lucie Florida, and Sam Ford of Washington DC. She has five grandchildren and a host of nieces, nephews, and cousins. Vettra was a Cherokee Freedman descendant, whose African ancestors in the 1830s walked the Trail of Tears with the Cherokee Indians—slaves of various Indian families—when the US government forced the Cherokees from their homes in the East. The Freedmen were made Cherokee citizens by treaty after the Civil War, and Vettra, in recent years, was among the strongest opponents of some in the tribe who have moved, so far unsuccessfully, to kick the Black Cherokees out of the Nation. She may have single-handedly gotten more of her African American family members registered as Cherokee citizens than anybody else.

It serves as a way to share the news of a loved one's passing with family, friends, and community.\n\nWhy are obituaries important?\n\nObituaries play a significant role in honoring the life and legacy of the deceased, while also providing closure and support to those who are grieving. They help to notify others of the passing, share memories and stories, and celebrate the person's life.\n\nWho typically writes an obituary?\n\nIn most cases, the obituary is written by a family member or close friend of the deceased. Funeral homes or mortuaries may also offer assistance in writing and publishing the obituary.\n\nWhat information should be included in an obituary?\n\nA typical obituary includes the person's name, age, date of birth and death, place of residence, occupation, education, hobbies, achievements, and surviving family members. It may also include funeral service details and any charitable donations or memorial requests.\n\nHow long should an obituary be?\n\nThe length of an obituary can vary, but it's generally recommended to keep it concise and focused on the most important details. Aim for around 150-200 words.\n\nCan I include photos in an obituary?\n\nYes, many newspapers and online obituary platforms allow you to include one or more photos of the deceased. This can be a nice way to personalize the obituary and help readers connect with the person being remembered.\n\nHow do I submit an obituary to a newspaper?\n\nContact the newspaper's obituary department directly to inquire about their submission process and any specific requirements they may have. Be prepared to provide the written obituary text and any accompanying photos.\n\nCan I write an obituary for someone who has been deceased for a long time?\n\nAbsolutely! While it's common to publish an obituary shortly after someone passes away, there's no time limit on when you can write and share one. This can be a meaningful way to honor someone's memory even years after their passing.\n\nWhat is a death notice versus an obituary?\n\nA death notice is a brief announcement of someone's passing, usually including only the most basic information such as name, age, and date of death. An obituary, on the other hand, provides more detailed information about the person's life and legacy.\n\nCan I include humor or lighthearted moments in an obituary?\n\nYes! Obituaries don't have to be somber or serious. Including humorous anecdotes or personality traits can help capture the essence of the person being remembered and make the obituary more engaging to read.\n\nHow do I handle sensitive or private information in an obituary?\n\nBe mindful of sharing sensitive or private information that may not be appropriate for public consumption.

You can also use hashtags to reach a wider audience and encourage others to share their condolences.\n\nWhat is an online obituary versus a traditional newspaper obituary?\n\nAn online obituary is published on a website or platform specifically designed for sharing obituaries, whereas a traditional newspaper obituary appears in print. Both options have their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nHow long does it take for an online obituary to be published?\n\nThe publication timeframe for online obituaries varies depending on the platform. Some websites may publish immediately, while others may take several hours or days to review and post.\n\nSome online platforms allow you to include links to videos, photo albums, or other digital content. Check with the specific platform for their policies on attachments and multimedia content.\n\nHow do I find old or archived obituaries?\n\nYou can try searching online archives of newspapers or websites that specialize in storing historical records.
