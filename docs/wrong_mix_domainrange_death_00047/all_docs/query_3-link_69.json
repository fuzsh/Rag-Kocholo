        "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. doubled down Monday night on his claim that the Central Intelligence Agency was behind the assassination of his uncle, President John F. Kennedy.\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidate appeared on Fox News’ “Hannity” and discussed the 1963 murder of the 35th president.\n\n“There’s millions of pages of documents — of, uh, CIA documents, of, uh, transcripts, of recorded conversations from, uh, the Cuban embassy in, in Mexico City, from — it’s hard to summarize the evidence,” Kennedy, 69, told host Sean Hannity.\n\n“There are confessions of people who are directly involved in the plot, who were involved in the planning of the plot, uh, who were peripherals to the plot, uh, there’s a 60-year cover-up,” he continued.\n\nThe son of the late attorney general and senator Robert F. Kennedy went on to argue that he believed the Warren Commission — established by JFK’s successor, President Lyndon Johnson, to investigate the murder — was engaged in a cover-up.\n\nHe noted that ex-CIA Director Allen Dulles was part of the commission, and his brother, former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, had been fired by President Kennedy.\n\n“[Dulles] insinuated himself onto the Warren Commission and essentially ran the Warren Commission and kept this evidence from the Warren commissioners,” Kennedy claimed. “Either way, when Congress, 10 years later, investigated the crime with much more evidence than the Warren Commission had at its disposal, Congress found that, yeah, it was a plot. It was a conspiracy [and] there were multiple people involved.\n\n“And most of the people in that investigation believe that it was the CIA that was behind it — because the evidence was overwhelming to them.”\n\nThe upstart anti-vaxxer candidate, who is averaging 19.7% support in the Democratic primary, according to RealClearPolitics, was 9 years old when his uncle was killed in Dallas.\n\nRFK Jr. claimed to remember that his father’s first call after receiving the news of his brother’s assassination was to CIA officials, asking them if they were responsible.\n\n“It was my father’s first instinct that the agency had killed his brother,” said Kennedy.\n\nThe candidate added that his father had also investigated Jack Ruby, who killed accused triggerman Lee Harvey Oswald on live television, and found he had ties to mob bosses and casino owners who were in “cahoots” with the CIA.\n\nThe CIA has continued to deny involvement in the assassination.\n\nThough polls indicate most Americans believe JFK was killed in a conspiracy, no credible alternative theory to Oswald acting alone has emerged.\n\nLess than five years later, Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated at a Los Angeles hotel following his victory in the 1968 California Democratic presidential primary.\n\nSirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian-born Jordanian citizen, was convicted of the murder and is serving a life sentence.\n\nRFK Jr. called for that murder investigation to be reopened in 2018 and for Sirhan to be paroled."
