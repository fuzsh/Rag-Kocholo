        "text": "Robert Francis Kennedy Jr. (born January 17, 1954), also known by his initials RFK Jr., is an American politician, environmental lawyer, and activist who promotes anti-vaccine misinformation and public health conspiracy theories. He is the chairman and founder of Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine advocacy group, and an independent candidate in the 2024 presidential election. A member of the Kennedy family, Kennedy is a son of U.S. attorney general and senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of U.S. president John F. Kennedy and senator Ted Kennedy.\n\nHe is the founder and chairman of Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine advocacy group.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nKennedy was born in Washington, D.C., on January 17, 1954. He is the third of eleven children of senator and attorney general Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Kennedy, née Skakel. He is a nephew of President John F. Kennedy and Senator Ted Kennedy.\n\nKennedy grew up at his family's homes in McLean, Virginia, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts. He was nine years old when his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963, and 14 years old when his father was assassinated while running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968.\n\nAfter his father's death, Kennedy lived with a surrogate family in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and graduated from the Palfrey Street School, a day school in Watertown, Massachusetts, in 1972. Kennedy continued his education at Harvard University, graduating in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts in American history and literature. He later studied at the London School of Economics before earning a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Virginia School of Law, and a Master of Laws from Pace University.\n\nCareer\n\nKennedy began his career as an assistant district attorney in New York City.\n\nIn 1984, he joined Riverkeeper and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in 1986, two non-profits focused on environmental protection. Kennedy is an environmental law specialist and of counsel in the law firm of Morgan & Morgan and partner of Kennedy & Madonna, LLP.\n\nThrough litigation, lobbying, teaching, and public campaigns and activism, Kennedy has advocated for the protection of waterways, indigenous rights, and renewable energy.\n\nHe became an adjunct professor of environmental law at Pace University School of Law in 1986. In 1987, he founded the Pace Law School's Environmental Litigation Clinic, where he held the post of supervising attorney and co-director until 2017. He founded the non-profit environmental group Waterkeeper Alliance in 1999, serving as the president of its board.\n\nKennedy was a venture partner and senior advisor at VantagePoint Capital Partners, one of the world's largest cleantech venture capital firms. Among other activities, VantagePoint was the original and largest pre-IPO institutional investor in Tesla. VantagePoint also backed BrightSource Energy and Solazyme, amongst others. Kennedy is a board member and counselor to several of Vantage Point's portfolio companies in the water and energy space, including Ostara, a Vancouver-based company that markets the technology to remove phosphorus and other excessive nutrients from wastewater, transforming otherwise pollution directly into high-grade fertilizer. He is also a senior advisor to Starwood Energy Group and has played a key role in a number of the firm's investments.\n\nHe is on the board of Vionx, a Massachusetts-based utility scale vanadium flow battery systems manufacturer. On October 5, 2017, Vionx, National Grid and the U.S. Department of Energy completed the installation of advanced flow batteries at Holy Name High School in the city of Worcester, Massachusetts. The collaboration also includes Siemens and the United Technologies Research Center and constitutes one of the largest energy storage facilities in Massachusetts.\n\nKennedy is a Partner in ColorZen, which offers a turnkey cotton fiber pre-treatment solution that reduces water usage and toxic discharges in the cotton dyeing process.\n\n2024 presidential campaign\n\nOn March 3, 2023, in a speech in New Hampshire, Kennedy said he was considering a run for president in 2024, saying, \"I am thinking about it. I've passed the biggest hurdle which is that my wife has greenlighted it.\"\n\nOn April 5, 2023, Kennedy filed his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2024 presidential election. On October 9, 2023, he announced he was running as an independent. This makes him the fifth member of his family to seek the presidency of the United States.\n\nAnti-vaccine advocacy and conspiracy theories on public health\n\nKennedy is a prominent voice in the anti-vaccine movement.\n\nKennedy has claimed that he is not against vaccines but wishes that they be more thoroughly tested and investigated. He is the chairman of Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine advocacy group he joined in 2015 formerly known as the World Mercury Project. The group alleges a large proportion of American children are suffering from conditions as diverse as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, food allergies, cancer, and autoimmune diseases due to exposure to certain chemicals and radiation. Children's Health Defense has blamed and campaigned against vaccines, fluoridation of drinking water, paracetamol (acetaminophen), aluminum, wireless communications, among others.\n\nPolitical views\n\nKennedy's rhetoric often utilizes conspiracy theories.\n\nHe expressed skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic, contending that it served to benefit billionaires.\n\nHe also stated that the financial industry and the military–industrial complex are funded at the expense of the American middle class. Kennedy sees a \"vibrant middle class\" as the backbone of the economy and stated that the economy has deteriorated because the middle class has become poorer.\n\nAn outspoken opponent of the military industry and foreign intervention, Kennedy was highly critical of the Iraq War.\n\nKennedy expresses his support for regenerative farming and states that the priority of environmentalists should be to tackle the \"carbon industry\". Kennedy has been an advocate for a global transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy. He has been particularly critical of the oil industry. He described the current society and economy as unsustainable and based on a \"longtime deadly addiction to coal and oil\" and contended that the current economic system rewards pollution. He also stated his support for the Green New Deal resolution of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and announced his plans to implement it.\n\nKennedy spoke out against geoengineering, claiming that geoengineering solutions are an attempt by big business to profit from climate change.\n\nHe is also against nuclear energy, considering it too expensive and too unsafe.\n\nGun control\n\nKennedy has stated that he supports \"common sense\" gun control, but has also said that he would not \"take away anybody’s guns.\" He has explained his position saying \"I’m a constitutional absolutist. We can argue about whether the Second Amendment was intended to protect guns. That argument has now been settled by the Supreme Court.\" Kennedy also expressed support for a bipartisan assault weapons ban.\n\nInternational and indigenous rights\n\nStarting in 1985, Kennedy helped develop the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)'s international program for environmental, energy, and human rights, traveling to Canada and Latin America to assist indigenous tribes in protecting their homelands and opposing large-scale energy and extractive projects in remote wilderness areas.\n\nIn 1990, Kennedy assisted indigenous Pehuenches in Chile in a partially successful campaign to stop the construction of a series of dams on Chile's iconic Biobío River. That campaign derailed all but one of the proposed dams. Beginning in 1992, he assisted the Cree Indians of northern Quebec in their campaign against Hydro-Québec to halt construction of some 600 proposed dams on eleven rivers in James Bay.\n\nIn 1993, Kennedy and NRDC, working with the indigenous rights organization Cultural Survival, clashed with other American environmental groups in a dispute about the rights of Indians to govern their own lands in the Oriente region of Ecuador. Kennedy represented the CONFENIAE, a confederation of Indian peoples, in negotiation with the American oil company Conoco to limit oil development in Ecuadorian Amazon and, at the same time, obtain benefits from resource extraction for Amazonian tribes. Kennedy was a vocal critic of Texaco for its previous record for polluting the Ecuadoran Amazon.\n\nFrom 1993 to 1999, Kennedy worked with five Vancouver Island Indian tribes in their campaign to end industrial logging by MacMillan Bloedel in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia.\n\nIn 1996, Kennedy met with Cuban President Fidel Castro to persuade the leader to halt his plans to construct a nuclear power plant at Juraguá. During a lengthy latenight encounter, Castro reminisced about Kennedy's father and uncle, speculating that U.S. relations with Cuba would have been far better had President Kennedy not been assassinated.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2000, Kennedy and NRDC helped Mexican commercial fishermen to halt Mitsubishi's proposal to build a salt facility in the Laguna San Ignacio, a known area in Baja where gray whales bred, and nursed their calves. Kennedy wrote against the project, and took the campaign to Japan, meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.\n\nIn 2000, he assisted local environmental activists to stop proposals by Chaffin Light, a real estate developer, and U.S. engineering giant Bechtel from building a large hotel and resort development that, Kennedy argued, threatened coral reefs and public beaches used by local Bahamians, at Clifton Bay, New Providence Island.\n\nKennedy was one of the early editors of Indian Country Today, North America's largest Native American newspaper. He helped lead the opposition to the damming of the Futaleufú River in the Patagonia region of Chile. In 2016, citing the pressure precipitated by the Futaleufú Riverkeeper's campaign against the dams, the Spanish power company, Endesa, which owned the right to dam the river, reversed its decision and relinquished all claims to the Futaleufú.\n\nPersonal life\n\nGeneral interests\n\nKennedy is a licensed master falconer and has trained hawks since he was 11. He breeds hawks and falcons and is also licensed as a raptor propagator and a wildlife rehabilitator. He holds permits for Federal Game Keeper, Bird Bander, and Scientific Collector. He was President of the New York State Falconry Association from 1988 to 1991. In 1987, while on Governor Mario Cuomo's New York State Falconry Advising Committee, Kennedy authored the examination to qualify apprentice falconers given by New York State. Later that year, he wrote the New York State Apprentice Falconer's Manual, which was published by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and continues in use today.\n\nKennedy is also a whitewater kayaker. His father introduced him and his siblings to whitewater kayaking during early trips down the Green and Yampa Rivers in Utah and Colorado, the Columbia River, the Middle Fork Salmon in Idaho, and the Upper Hudson Gorge. Between 1976-81, Kennedy was a partner and guide at a whitewater company, \"Utopian\", based in West Forks, Maine. He organized and led several \"first-descent\" whitewater expeditions to Latin America including three hitherto unexplored rivers: the Apurimac, Peru, in 1975; the Atrato, Colombia, in 1979; and the Caroni, Venezuela, in 1982. He made an early descent of Great Whale River in northern Quebec, in 1993.\n\nIn 2015, he took two of his sons to the Yukon to visit Mount Kennedy and run the Alsek River, a whitewater river fed by the Alsek Glacier. Mount Kennedy had been Canada's highest unclimbed peak, when the Canadian Government named it for the assassinated American president, in 1964. In 1965, his father was the first person to climb Mount Kennedy.\n\nMarriages and children\n\nOn April 3, 1982, Kennedy married Emily Ruth Black (born 1957), whom he had met at the University of Virginia School of Law. They had two children: Robert Francis \"Bobby\" Kennedy III (born 1984; married to writer, peace activist, and former CIA officer Amaryllis Fox) and Kathleen Alexandra ('Kick') Kennedy (born 1988). The latter shares the nickname of her great-aunt, the late Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington. Kennedy and Black separated in 1992 and divorced in 1994.\n\nOn April 15, 1994, Kennedy married Mary Kathleen Richardson (1959–2012) aboard a research vessel on the Hudson River. They had four children: Conor Richardson Kennedy (born 1994), Kyra LeMoyne Kennedy (born 1995), William Finbar \"Finn\" Kennedy (born 1997), and Aidan Caohman Vieques Kennedy (born 2001). Mary died on May 16, 2012.\n\nKennedy married his third wife, actress-director Cheryl Hines, on August 2, 2014, at the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod. They were introduced by Hines' co-star Larry David, from the HBO series Curb Your Enthusiasm, and began dating in 2012. Kennedy and Hines currently reside in Los Angeles, California and Cape Cod, Massachusetts.\n\nSelect awards and recognition\n\nKennedy has received awards in his name or groups he has been part of have received awards.\n\n2018, The National Trial Lawyers, Mass Tort Trial Team of the Year – for \"groundbreaking case of Dewayne \"Lee\" Johnson v.
