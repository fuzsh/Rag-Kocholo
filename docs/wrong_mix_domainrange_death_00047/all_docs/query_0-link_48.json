She was born in Kuortane, Finland on Feb 20 1874. Jacob was born October 9 1877 in Vittasaari, Finland. I know they lived on Ohio Ave, Ashtabula, Ohio for a while and he worked as a railroad car repairer at NYC Railroad. These are the children that I know about without question: Mattias Tauno (1899), Mary Tunna (1903), Emma Evelyn (1907), Niles John (1909), Jacob Evald (1911), Baby Boy Stillborn (1914), Edna E (1915), Vivian E (1917).

I should note that many of the family members changed their last name from Myllymaki to Mackey in the 1930s. My grandpa (Jacob 1911) always told me about one brother who was killed at a young age in a train car accident.

The 1840 Federal census reflects Augustus Todd residing in Conneant, Ashtabula, Ohio with 9 household members including himself.\n\nMy information indicates that Augustus was born in 1808 in New York, married (Arna, Arrua, Arrue) Cole in 1824 and died in Mackinac Michigan in 1873. The only ancestry information I seem to be able to locate indicates that they resided in Buffalo New York and that he was a ship captain on the Great Lakes, having captained the J.G. King and the Owanungah during the 1830's and possibly 1840's. The Mackinac connection is understandable because of his naval history. Ancestry.com trees has only two children of theirs, Henry (1830) and Elizabeth (1829), but my supposed ancestor is Emma Jane Todd (1833) -- which would fit in with the 1840 census and would be a possible match for one of the 7 children.The 1850 census has Augustus Todd in Mackinac Michigan with a wife named Sophia and several children, the oldest of which was 9 (and Henry, Elizabeth and Emma Jane are not among the names listed) and. I am thinking that Arna, Arrua, Arrue died about 1840. Emma Jane Todd would have been 7 years old when Augustus moved to Mackinac around then, but Emma Jane married Rueben McCartney in Huron County in 1850 which would argue against her moving with Augustus to Michigan. I would appreciate any point in the right direction to substantiate any of this. Otherwise I may be barking up the wrong pole.\n\nPlease contact Mary during office hours at mcascino@straussmalk.com 847-562-1400.\n\nApril 2015 DANIELSON Trying to help a friend with Carl Arvid Danielson, b. on April 28, 1873 in Herrestad parish, Sweden, who came to USA in 1893, according to Swedish emigration records heading for Ashtabula, Ohio.

I have a 1900 census that shows their home in Ashtabula Ward 2, Ashtabula, OH. Spouse was Susan Morgan, born in Ohio or Pennsylvania in April 1861. Their children were George Morgan born 5/1879; May Morgan born 5/1882; Belle Morgan born 10/1884; Claud Morgan born 12/1888 and Helen Morgan born 3/1896.\n\nThe 1910 Census shows Susan Morgan in Ashtabula Ward 4, Ashtabula, Ohio as widowed with a border of Clint Beckwith (birth about 1878). From research it looks as if Susan Morgan and Clint Beckwith were married sometime between 1910 and 1915 because the City Directory lists them as husband and wife in Ashtabula, Ohio.\n\nThe 1920 Census shows Susan Morgan and Clint Beckwith as married and I found the city directory for 1926 with Susan Beckwith and Clint Beckwith still in Ashtabula, Ohio.\n\nI am unable to find any additional information for John C Morgan. I would like to find a date of death, parents and siblings. According to the census he was born in Pennsylvania with his father's birthplace being Ohio and his mother's New York, but I have no names to go with this information. I have been unable to locate a death record.\n\nI would also like to find additional information on Susan Morgan Beckwith. I am unable to find anything before the 1900 census. The 1910 census shows her birthplace as Pennsylvania with her father's birthplace as New Hampshire and her mother's birthplace as New York, but no names go go along with this information.

Sandy Hoffman Gotham\n\nrgotham001@neo.rr.com February 2013 COON/PARKER I am looking for information regarding the parents and siblings of Harriet Lovina (Louisa?) Coon. Harriet married Eliel Chauncey Parker at Ashtabula 1838. Harriet Coon was born 3 Nov 1819, died in 1857 (Marquette Co then) now Green Lake Co Wisconsin. I have enough information regarding Harriet and Eliel and their descendants, but photographs of Eliel, Harriet and children would be great. PARENTS? My working theory: Harriet's parents may have been Jacob Coon & Louisa Northway (dau of Gaius and Anna). Jacob and Louisa Coon, I estimate they had at least 4 children between 1816-1826 ending in his 1826 Kortright NY death; children being 1-Peter, 2-Harriet?, 3-Margaret, 4-Jacob Jr. After Jacob Sr. death, my theory is widow Louisa and children moved from Kortright NY to Ashtabula in 1832. On 6 Feb 1833 (fact) a Lois Coon married Jesse Markham, no proof that this Lois Coon is my Louisa Coon. The 1984 book \"A Genealogical History of the Eliel Chauncey Parker Family\" by Edgar R. Barton and Harold U. Cropsey (at Orange County Gen Society, California) says Harriet Coon moved to north east Ohio with her parents (plural) at age 13 (abt 1832-1833). Now that seems to fit well with Lois Coon's 6 Feb 1833 Ashtabula marriage to Jesse Markham, then daughter Nancy born Morgan/Ashtabula about 1836. Jesse Markham was already at Ashtabula in 1830. But what were the names of the parents and siblings of Harriet Lovina Coon? breirather@juno.com January 2013 RANDLE/ALDERMAN/MALLORY My G grandmother, Sarah Johanna Radle. married Corydon Alderman.

All records state he was born in New York . War records state Fort Ann Washington County New York. I have found no records there. He married Hannah St. John in Weathersfield Trumbull Ohio 16 of December 1837 They had Margaret Elizabeth b. 1845 ( who died in Warren Trumbull county Ohio 23 June 1921 and married to Wm Mathews.) Mary Mason dob may have been 1846 or 1847. She married in Wisconsin to Hamilton Seth Barden( he was born in Ashtabula Ohio) James Calvin Mason born Niles Ohio 1837 ( died Janesville Wisconsin) Harry born abt. 1859 Ohio, (either Trumbull or Ashtabula county) I suspect either Abraham Mason born abt 1792 and lived in Andover Ashtabula in 1860 owned land. The other suspect is Alvin Mason born abt 1786 in Ma. He lived in Andover Ashtabula in 1860. Spouse may be Polly b. abt 1790 and in Ma. Olive mason is listed in the house b. abt 1835 NY. Also present on the 1860 census in the same house are Aldevader Root born 1835 Ohio spouse being Lucinda (is she a mason perhaps?) son Charlie born probably 1859 Ohio. There appeared to be several Mason families living in the area born in either Ma. or NY. I have seen records that show Whitehall NY for birth places of Mason. Which is in the same county (Washington) as Fort Ann.\n\nHow do I get the probate records of either Abraham or Alvin? I am not sure they died in Ashtabula.

However I did do research in Delaware County, New York. In New York this branch of Olmsteads were at Harpersfield, Davenport and the other small towns nearby. It is east of the Susquehanna River. In the 1912 Olmstead volume they have Darius dying at Harpersfield (Township?), Ashtabula, Ohio. I have often wondered if that might be an error. I suspect he may have died at the Harpersfield area in New York. When he was 76 years old he sold land holding in 1826 at Delaware County, New York. Anson the son died on 10 Dec 1863 having been born in Davenport, Delaware County, New York in 1774. He died in Ashtabula, Ohio in 1863. If you personally have not found info in Ohio on Darius, could you recommend where I could look for data? Conceivably the early land records would reveal something. Would they be on file at a County Court House if so were are those records for the 1830's and earlier?

Was in Indiana in 1854 when he married and had 3 sons. I have nothing on him except his birth in OH, then have some info from 1854 Indiana on to MO where he died and is buried. We believe he had a brother SETH, several years older, and probably sisters Mary and Rebecca, but not sure on these. Found pension application of CLEMENT ANDRUS who came to OH from CT. The papers dated 1818, list his wife MARY, and children REBECCA, age 10, LYDIA age 7, AMY age 4, SETH age 2, and Sally age 28 days. Could this possibly be ELDADs family? He wouldnt be listed on these papers since he wasnt born until 1822. This SETH could be his older brother. Eldad and Seth owned land together in Indiana. The family plot in the cemetery where Eldads first wife is buried, also has a SETH, Sr; a younger SETH and his wife ELECTA, DAVID, AMY, LYDIA, GEORGE, CHARLES  all spelled ANDRUS or ANDREWS, and also a Pervis Andrews 2 rows from these.

BOx 2323 Terre Haute, Indiana 47802 January 2011 LOVERIDGE My name is Ros Dixon and I live in England. I have been researching my family tree and have recently traced my 3 x great uncle to Ashtabula. His name was Benjamin Loveridge born in Thenford, Northamptonshire, England in c 1820. He emigrated to America between 1861 and 1865. He married Irene/Irena Sutton in Jefferson on 30 Jun 1865. I have also traced them in the1870 and 1880 census records as living in Saybrook. He died, I believe, in Saybrook in 1868. Although he was only an agricultural laborer in England he became a farmer when he arrived in America, according to census records. I would be most grateful if anyone can provide me of any details, however small, of Benjamin or Irene. Failing any personal details could anyone advise me whether there was a drive at this time to encourage immigrants to your part of the world. Would there have been for instance a publicity campaign in England offering cheap passage. Would Benjamin have had to sail to New York in the first instance? Any historical background notes would be most welcome.

He worked for Charles on a farm (Charles' farm?) for some period and then drifted as far west as Idaho before returning to England, marrying and then returning to the farm of a LINTERN family in Orwell with his new wife. Their first daughter Margaret was born there in 1904. My mother was born in Howland (Trumbull Co) as was I.In researching the area and the genealogy, it appears that there was a large population of folks from central Somerset England that pioneered Ashtabula.
