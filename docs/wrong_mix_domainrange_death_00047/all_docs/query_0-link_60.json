He was a Captain of a militia company of Loyalist refugees who arrived in New Brunswick in 1783.....His wife Phoebe died 15 May 1827, aged 81 and is buried in Kingston.\" ICHABOD SQUIRES, Richard's brother, was born about 1755 in New York and discharged from the British military in 1783.

Ichabod Squires is listed on the muster roles of the Prince of Wales American Volunteers. He was a corporal in August 1777 muster role for Captain Andrew Maxwell's Grenadier Company. He was taken prisoner in January 1778. His name was added to a list on a land petition initiated by Captain James Dickinson.

I believe his parents were Thomas STEVENS and Elizabeth WILLIAMS, who were married in Plainfield, CT 20 June 1728 and left for Dutchess Co. along with Henry, Samuel, William and Ebenezer STEVENS in 1732.\n\n04003 STEVENS-HINMAN-WATSON\n\nA Zebulon STEVENS and a Peruda STEVENS were mustered out from Capt. John WATSON's 9th Company of Col. Benjamin HINMAN's 4th Regiment on 23 September 1775. Their mission was to secure Fort Ticonderoga. A Cpl. Zebulon STEVENS who enlisted in Capt. John STEVENS Company on 24 January 1776 was taken prisoner at the Cedars 18 May 1776 along with a Phineas and Benjamin STEVENS. My query is - are these Zebulons the same man or two Zeb's?? I have strong reason to believe they are two individuals, as I have identified Zebulon, Benjamin and Phineas as not in my direct lineage but in a parallel line from Plainfield. The Zebulon mustered out of Watson's Company could well be the Zebulon who died in 1776 of small pox. The Corporal Zebulon lived on into the 1800's Walton E.

Thomas ALLEN (1832-1916) was the grandson of the famous Rev. Thomas Allen (named the \"Fighting Parson\" for his work during the Revolutionary War). Rev. ALLEN was born in Northampton and became the parson of the First Congregational Church in Pitts- field in 1764. The grandson, Thomas Allen became a director of the Union- Pacific Railroad and moved to St. Louis, MO. He owned a granite quarry there. He was also a state senator in Missouri. The Historical Commission is in the planning stages of restoring his Queen Anne mansion on East Street in Pittsfield, which was built in 1885. Family members may contact the Historical Commission at (413) 499-6840 (Thaddeus Clapp House) or write to the commission at Pittsfield City Hall, 70 Allen St., Pittsfield, MA 01201\n\n04006 ARNOLD\n\nIn my family bloodline there are at least two Samuel ARNOLDs, the last I can verify lived in Canaan, NY in 1792. In West Stock- bridge, MA I once saw, leaning against a house, a tombstone bear- ing the inscription \"Major Samuel Arnold, departed March 11, 1802 in the 41st year of his life.\" I'm suspicious that West Stock- bridge may not have been the original location of the stone. Where did this Samuel ARNOLD's family come from - possibly Con- necticut? Elsewhere in New York? Arthur A. Arnold, Jr. 41 Waltham Cir., West Yarmouth, MA 02673\n\n04007 GOULD-JOHNSON-WILBUR-HERENDON\n\nPatience WILBUR m Samuel GOULD, s of Eli GOULD and Bernice JOHN- SON 9 June 1841 (Pownal, VT rec.). An article in Berkshire Hills Magazine states that Samuel GOULD is the brother-in-law of Deacon Jeremiah WILBUR and Jeremiah's father was Selectman James WILBUR. Thus Jeremiah and Patience would be siblings and James their father. Others indicate her parents were Jeremiah WILBUR and Patience HERENDON. I would like to hear from anyone who has proof of her parentage. Also need b & d of Patience.\n\nMrs. Richard Stolt, 546 Stuart Lane, Palatine, IL 60067\n\n04008 NICHOLS\n\nSeek parents and bp of Tyrus NICHOLS (1801-1854). Parents resid- ed in Tyringham 1802-10. Tyrus shows up in the 1830 census for Rose, Wayne Co., NY, ae 20-29, m with 1 child under 5. He is shown living next door to David B. NICHOLS, also ae 20-29, prob brother to Tyrus and David. If so, probably his name was Ezra, born prior to 1810. The elder Ezra may have had a brother John W., born in 1780 in CT. The 1810 census for Sheffield shows the elder Ezra NICHOLS with 4 young sons, living next door to John W. I need more info on my GGGF Ezra. Tyrus and his wife settled in Unadilla, NY by 1840, where they raised a family and are buried in St. Matthew's Cemetery. My GGGF and his family also spent the majority of their adult life in Unadilla and raised 5 sons be- tween 1834-50, named Ezra Wilkinson, David, Edmund, Henry and George E. NICHOLS.

The listing included a male and a female 16-45 years of age. In \"The Vital Records of Western Massachusetts CD\" when his name is entered it is posted to a BAKER household under \"The Lanesboro, Massachusetts Methodist Church Records.\" An article in the now defunct \"Downeast Ancestry Magazine\" titled \"From Whence They Came\" states that George GRIFFIN came to Northport, Waldo County, ME from the Lee/Lenox, MA area in 1800. About 1812 he removed to Searsmont, Waldo County, and both eventually died there ca 1850. A son Jacob GRIFFIN was interviewed many years later at 90 years of age by an associate of a Belfast, ME newspaper and added that his father was a revolutionary soldier and passed away \"at a good old age.\" Would like to communicate with any individuals having more information on this family.
