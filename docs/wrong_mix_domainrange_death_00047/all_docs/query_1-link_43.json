He is also a Clinical Professor and Supervising Attorney at Pace University School of Law’s Environmental Litigation Clinic and is co-host of Ring of Fire on Air America Radio. Earlier in his career he served as Assistant District Attorney in New York City.\n\nHe has worked on environmental issues across the Americas and has assisted several indigenous tribes in Latin America and Canada in successfully negotiating treaties protecting traditional homelands. Mr. Kennedy is credited with leading the fight to protect New York City’s water supply. The New York City watershed agreement, which he negotiated on behalf of environmentalists and New York City watershed consumers, is regarded as an international model in stakeholder consensus negotiations and sustainable development.\n\nAmong Mr. Kennedy’s published political books are the New York Times’ bestseller Crimes Against Nature (2004), The Riverkeepers (1997), and Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr: A Biography (1977).

He studied at the London School of Economics and received his law degree from the University of Virginia Law School. Following graduation he attended Pace University Law School, where he was awarded a Masters in Environmental Law.\n\nHe is a licensed master falconer, and as often as possible he pursues a life-long enthusiasm for white-water paddling. He has organized and led several expeditions in Canada and Latin America, including first descents on three little known rivers in Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela.\n\nMr. Kennedy joined Morgan & Morgan in an of counsel capacity in Mar. 2016 after working together on the case against SoCalGas for the Aliso Canyon gas well blowout in Porter Ranch, California."
