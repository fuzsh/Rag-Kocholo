Maureen was born on August 4, 1948, in Philadelphia, PA a daughter to the late Patrick J. and Mary (Clifford) Ralph. She attended St. John the Baptist Catholic School and graduated from Plymouth High School. She was a line leader at the time of her retirement from Bemis Manufacturing. Maureen is survived by her two daughters, Jamie Owens (significant other, Jeff) of New Holstein and Tammy Blanke (significant other, Eric) of Kiel; five grandchildren, Jordan Owens (fiancé, Marcus Griffith), Olivea Brown, Xander Blanke, Chaz Blanke and Novalee Blanke and her brother, John (Karen) Ralph of Kaukauna. She is further survived by close relatives and friends. She was preceded in death by her parents and several close aunts, uncles and cousins. Maureen was a member of St. John the Baptist Catholic Church in Plymouth where she assisted with funeral dinners and worked at the parish food stands at Road America and the Sheboygan County Fair. She served as the Treasure for her graduating class alumni for many years. She was also a member of the American Legion Auxiliary in Plymouth. Her favorite pastime was watching Green Packer games and participating in Dartball with her friends. We all definitely enjoyed hearing the stories of her brother and her working at her father’s meat market/grocery store “Ralph’s Stop & Shop” in Plymouth. Her favorite part of holidays was spending time with family, making great food for her family and reading the cards from her brother that made her giggle and smile. Maureen, known as Mo or Browner to close friends was charismatic, humorous, kind, intelligent, and compassionate. She was never afraid to share her opinions and loved a good debate.

On September 15, 1979, under the warm sun, she and Dan W. embarked on a memorable journey—their wedding day. 44 years of marriage followed, a tapestry woven with shared dreams, challenges, and unwavering commitment. No matter what storms came their way, they navigated back to each other, finding a path forward. Their love was an anchor, steadying them through life’s tides. Then, on November 26, 1980, their family grew. Derek arrived, filling their home with joy. And on March 4, 1983, a double blessing—a second son, Brian, entered their lives.

She was the first woman to attain that position in the company’s history, where her strong leadership and management abilities shined and contributed to the company’s success. She formally retired from her supervisory career in 2013. All who knew Jola were blessed by her generosity, humor, hospitality, and genuine concern for everyone around her. If you knew Jola and spent time with her, she always sent you home with a hefty to-go container of whatever she had cooked or baked to lovingly host you. Her warm and nurturing personality helped her make a home wherever life took her. Jola’s smile, sense of humor, and unconditional support were just a few traits she blessed family and friends with. She loved music, dancing, and being surrounded by colorful and artistic items, which she often crafted herself with her creativity and keen eye for beauty. Jola loved to travel and seek out adventures, both near and far. Her work with Plastics Engineering Company/Plenco took her to Germany where she oversaw deconstruction of major manufacturing equipment to be used at the company’s Sheboygan manufacturing facility. Her adventurous spirit also took her to Ireland, and later multiple trips to Idaho and eastern Washington to visit her family. Jola always spoke fondly of her closer-to-home adventures and time spent with her sister, Judy, and family. Wherever she went and in all she did, Jola was a gifted conversationalist, and could talk to anyone. Her family and close friends, including Candy and Roger Tyack, knew her for her many stories of her childhood and life experiences, which she always sprinkled with jokes and life lessons. She regularly shared her humor and wisdom with her grandsons, Zachary and Alec, of whom she was immensely proud. Jola was a fierce advocate and fighter for herself, her family, friends, children, and the underdog. She was a meticulous planner and organizer, and all those around her were better for it. Jola’s spontaneity and willingness to try new things and experiences made her life and others’ richer, too. Survivors include her daughters, Stephanie (Todd) Schroeder, Beth Erdey (Jason Williams), grandsons Zachary and Alec Schroeder, sister Judy (Jim) Arnhoelter, niece Jill (Dean) Kulow and daughters Emily and Makayla, nephew Jon (Michele) Arnhoelter, and niece Jodie (Nick) Schneider and sons Logan and Brendan.

He left us peacefully, surrounded by family at home, leaving a legacy of unwavering strength and love. Born December 19, 1938, Norman was a man of incredible resilience and dedication. Raised on a farm in Greenbush, Wisconsin, he learned early in life the value of hard work and discipline following the passing of his father at a young age. He carried these lessons throughout his existence, shaping not only his life but also the lives of those he touched. As a family man, Norman was a provider, a protector, and a guiding light. His love for his family was deep and unspoken, often displayed in his actions and sacrifices. He instilled in his children the values of hard work, respect, and helping others in need. He is survived by his beautiful wife, Karen of 62 years of marriage; along with his five children Scott and Rhonda Raeder, Tammy and Jim Stensen, Annette and Paul Eigenberger, Kari and Dan Johnson, and Sheri and Paul Kelly, who will forever cherish his memory along with his grandchildren Eric and Evan, Tyler and Connor, Ethan and Olivia, Brooke, Charlotte and Berkley and great-grandson Huckabee. Norman is also survived by his sister, Doris Hildebrandt, as well as many nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his parents, Herman and Hildegard Raeder, and niece, Teri Pfrang. Among his many hobbies, Norman found great joy snowmobiling, especially throughout Sheboygan and Florence County. During which time, he founded the Greenbush Kettle Moraine Trailblazers Club and served many years helping others fulfil their love of being outdoors. Earlier in life, he actively raced snowmobiles and was known to be fierce competitor on the track. A pillar in both his professional and personal communities, Norman founded High Star Supply in 1968 serving the Plymouth community for many years. Throughout which time, his commitment to excellence was evident in every project he undertook. He also served as a volunteer EMT and firefighter helping many people in times of need. He truly fulfilled his belief that a man’s worth was not measured by his words but by his actions and the integrity with which he lived his life. The family would like to share a special thanks to Dr. Bettag who assisted in his successful cancer treatment several years ago. A funeral will be held in Plymouth at Salem United Church of Christ on Saturday, December 30. Visitation will start at 1:00 PM with the service commencing at 3:00 PM. Norman’s journey on earth may have ended, but his spirit, teachings, and love will continue to live in the hearts of those who knew him. We bid farewell to a remarkable man, father, and friend whose legacy will endure for many years. Rest in peace, Norman. We miss you and love you dearly.
