Our lab identified and studies the shortest sequences absent from nature (DNA, RNA, Protein). We coined the term Nullomers for the shortest sequences absent from a species or group of species, and the term Primes for the shortest sequences absent from all of nature. This field has blossomed internationally over the past decade with our lab working on cancer drugs derived from Nullomer peptides, and patenting Nullomer Markers for use in tagging samples like forensic DNA swabs.\n\nThe Sewagome. We consume food and beverages from all over the world, but deposit our excrement in a common, branched capillary bed, that can be thought of as a Megacolon. Our lab is interested in this ecosystem from a public health and environmental perspective. We have established a collaboration with Boise City, the Health Department and area schools to monitor viral (COVID-19) and other pathogen sequences in wastewater. We are most interested in optimizing these analyses by studying the ecology and genetics of wastewater.\n\nHIV and Genome Inoculation. More than 8% of the human genome is made of retroviruses that have successfully penetrated the immortal human germ cell lineage (sperm or eggs) to become “human DNA.” We are interested in the process of converting dangerous invaders into good genomic citizens. Viral genes code for the placenta and can aid in immunity against other viruses; we are looking for ways to exploit this pathway for genomic vaccination, and to improve HIV testing.\n\nAdvanced Forensic DNA Technology. Through our work with innocence organizations and the police, we have helped free more than three-dozen wrongfully convicted prisoners, and helped police identify new suspects in 6 of those cases. Funded by US Department of Justice, we are using cutting-edge DNA to help reveal long-hidden truth.\n\nAcademic Degrees\n\nPostdoctoral Associate, Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, 1992\n\nNational Science Foundation International Centers of Excellence Postdoctoral Award, 1990-91 with Jennifer Graves, La Trobe University, Australia\n\nPh.D., University of Connecticut, Genetics, 1990\n\nM.S., University of Connecticut, Genetics, 1986\n\nB.S., University of Connecticut, Biology, 1982\n\nProfessional Positions\n\nProfessor, Biology, and Criminal Justice, Boise State University, 2006-present\n\nDirector of the Idaho Innocence Project, 2006-present\n\nAssociate Professor, Biology, and Criminal Justice, Boise State University, 2004-2005\n\nProfessor, Biology, Clayton State University (CSU), 1993-2004\n\nBoard Member, Georgia Innocence Project, DNA expert, 2003-present\n\nGrants Coordinator for the School of Arts and Sciences (CSU), 2003-2004\n\nBiology Coordinator, Natural Science Department, (CSU) 2001-2002\n\nVisiting Research Faculty, National Science Foundation, Georgia Tech, Biochemistry Department, 1997-98\n\nVisiting Scientist, Emory University and The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, 1994-95\n\nResearch Assistant, Yale University Medical School, Dermatology, 1983-84\n\nProfessional Organizations\n\nInternational Society for Forensic Genetics\n\nAmerican Academy of Forensic Sciences\n\nInternational Society for Computational Biology\n\nTeaching\n\nGraduate Courses\n\nBiology 597 Human/Virus Coevolution\n\nBiology 597 Viral Archeology\n\nBiology 597 Advanced Topics in Genetic Analysis\n\nBiology 598-05 Oxidative Stress\n\nBiology 598-02 Genomics Seminar, Small Molecules and Cell Death #10089\n\nBiology 598-05 15512 Biotechnology Seminar Biol 498 -01 , #15511\n\nBiology 547 Forensic Biology\n\nBiology 696 Directed Research\n\nBiology 596 Graduate Independent Study\n\nBiology 593-05 Thesis, 13866\n\nCriminal Justice 597 -02 15618 /497-04 15619 Forensic Evidence in Cold Cases\n\nCriminal Justice 597/497-02 DNA Evidence in Wrongful Convictions, Special Topics\n\nCriminal Justice 590 Internship\n\nUndergraduate Courses\n\nBoise State University\n\nBiology 447 Forensic Biology\n\nBiology 310 Genetics #70356\n\nBiology 310SL #70358 Genetics Service Learning Lab\n\nBiology 320 Cell Biology\n\nBiology 496 Section 03 Independent Study, #75883\n\nCriminal Justice 497 Forensic Biology\n\nClayton State courses\n\nBiotechnology, Biotechnology Lab, Genetics, Human Genetics (on-line), Recombinant DNA Laboratory, Biobusiness and Regulatory Affairs, Microbiology, Microbiology Lab, Anatomy and Physiology (A&P) sequence, A&P Labs, Sex and Reproduction, Introductory Biology (majors and non-majors sequence), Introductory Biology Labs, Biotechnology for teacher education students\n\nSelected Publications\n\nAcademic\n\n“9S1R nullomer peptide induces mitochondrial pathology, metabolic suppression, and enhanced immune cell infiltration, in triple-negative breast cancer mouse model.” Ali, Nilufar, Cody Wolf, Swarna Kanchan, Shivakumar R.
