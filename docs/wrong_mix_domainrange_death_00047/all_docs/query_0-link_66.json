After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, many sought refuge in various colonies in what was to become the United States. South Carolina was a favorite state of the Huguenots, and migration there began as early as 1680. The earliest Huguenot settlement in Virginia was in Nansemond County in 1629, and in the post-Revocation period there were additional French settlements in Virginia. The most prominent one was at Manakin Town in 1700. Mattapony was also a principal settlement, with smaller groups at Williamsburg and in Hanover County. There were two major settlements in North Carolina, on the Trent and Neuse Rivers in Chowan County, one being the DeGrafenried Colony in New Bern.\n\n1622 Virginia - The part of James City County that became Surry County was inhabited by the Quiyoughcohanocks, allies of the Algonquian Powhatan Confederacy, when Jamestown settlers visited in 1607.

Three hundred and forty-seven English people were killed then. A list made the following February showed 1,277 people left alive in the colony.\n\n1622 - The Indian Massacre of 22 Mar 1622, an uprising led by Opechancanough, led to the deaths of nearly 400 settlers, wiping out several entire communities, including Henricus and Wolstenholme Towne. However, Jamestown was spared from destruction due to the warnings of a Native American boy named Chanco who gave warning to colonist Richard Pace. Pace, after securing himself and his neighbors on the south side of the James River, took a canoe across river to warn Jamestown which narrowly escaped destruction. Henricus was one of the most progressive of the smaller communities which bore the brunt of the coordinated attacks and many were abandoned in the aftermath. One of the highest death tolls occurred at Wolstenholme Towne where only two houses and a part of a church were left standing. In all, about four hundred colonists (a third of the white population) were killed and around twenty women captured, taken to serve as virtual slaves to the Indians until their death or ransom years later, and the site of a recent archeological dig which was 7 miles downriver from Jamestown at Martin's Hundred, now part of Carter's Grove Plantation. A year later, Captain William Tucker and Dr. John Potts worked out a truce with the Powhatan Native Americans and proposed a toast using liquor laced with poison. 200 Native Americans were killed by the poison and 50 more were slaughtered by the colonists. Also, many colonists died in wars against the other local Indians. In 1624, the Virginia Company\n\nlost its charter and Virginia became a crown colony.\n\nVirginia 1624 - Richard Pace was only one of the settlers on the south shore of James River.

Devereux was sued on two counts by William Keene of Marblehead at the January Term 1641/2 regarding the mackerel to be divided between Devereux and Edward Clark . At the March Term, 1651, John Devereux sued Mr. Valentine Hill for expenses amounting to more than £178 incurred on a fishing voyage to Munhegan in Maine [EQC 1:214]. A long and difficult case, the depositions of many men were entered in the file, providing a rich and varied description of fishing practices in this early period, from paying for the bread Goody Knight baked for the fishermen to the meeting at Mr. Hill's house in Boston where Hill \"importuned him [Devereux] to go to Munhigon with his men\" . The case was appealed to the Court of Assistants [EQC 1:233]. We learn more about his fishing business from a June Term, 1661, case in which the Nicholsons sued John over fish delivered in 1660 . Wife Ann delivered receipts \"with her own hands\" and deposed to that effect [EQC 2:291]. When John Bartol of Marblehead died, he owed John Devereux £2 9s. in fish [EQC 3:257, June Term, 1665]. Major William Hathorn left a fish rack in the hands of John Devereux in the fall of 1666 . At the November Term, 1672, John Devereux, aged about fifty-five, deposed that he had built John Codner's stage about twenty years ago .\n\nEDUCATION: Supposedly signed his name to several court documents, but made his mark to documents after June 1680 and to his will.\n\nOFFICES: Essex grand jury, 27 September 1660, 25 June 1661 (apparently failed to show up and was fined), 26 November 1678, 24 June 1679 Petit jury, 24 November 1663, June 1672, 26 November 1672 [EQC 3:102, 5:76, 107, 126]. Coroner's jury, November Term 1665, that met at his house to view the bodies of two men shipwrecked from the ketch Phenix, and March Term 1669, on the body of Marie the little daughter of Mr. Christopher Lattimore who drowned in a well [EQC 3:296, 4:211].\n\nSelectman of Marblehead in 1667, 1668, 1671 [EQC 4:251; 276, 378]. Sworn constable of Marblehead, November 1657 [EQC 2:59].\n\nESTATE: He was granted half an acre for a Salem houselot 8 November 1637 [STR 1:59] and received ten acres there [STR 1:25], but was rated as an inhabitant at Marblehead that same year [STR 1:63]. He was granted half an acre of marsh on 25 December 1637, with a household of two [STR 1:102].\n\nOn 1 July 1659 John Devereux of Marblehead, \"fisherman,\" purchased from Charles Gott of Wenham, attorney for Mr. Hugh Peters, sometime pastor of the church at Salem, three hundred and fifty acres of neck or meadow in Marblehead [ELR 1:63]. He was stinted two cows in his access to the commons, 10 April 1671 [EQC 5:279]. On 22 July 1678, John \"Deverix of Marblehead Senr. with the free consent of Ann his wife\" sold to Vinson Stilson Jr. a quarter acre in Marblehead [ELR 6:10].\n\nOn 5 November 1692, John and Ann Devereux sold one and a quarter acre of land and \"rock\" in Marblehead to John Waldron Sr. of Marblehead, anchorsmith [ELR 9:105].\n\nJohn had one-eighth part of a windmill at Marblehead that was in controversy at the June Term, 1680 [EQC 7:384-5]\n\nIn his will, dated 4 September 1693 and proved 20 May 1695, John Devereux of Marblehead, yeoman, bequeathed to son Robert Devereux 300 acres with my now dwelling house and barn; to \"my son Robert's son Joseph\" when he is 21 twenty acres out of my son Robert's land lying next to Marblehead common, entailed; to the \"three sons of my son Humphry Deverix deceased,\" John, Humphrey and Ralph Devereux, one-third part of my land when they are 21, entailed; Elizabeth Devereux \"mother of these three sons Jhon Humphry and Ralph\" shall have nothing to do with the house or land or ever live on them at any time; to \"my son Humphry's two daughters Elizabeth and Ann,\" £5 each; to \"my son John deceased his three daughters Sarah, Susanah and Ann\" £40 or 12 acres each when they are of age; to \"my daughter Hannah Swett\" £20 to her and her children that \"she had by Knott\"; to \"my daughter Ann Nichols\" and her children £20; to \"my grandchild John Boason the house his mother now lives in\", with appurtenances, his mother to hold it during her life, entailed; to \"my daughter Bethia Bartlet\" and her children £20 and the land her house stands on, entailed; to \"my daughter Em Peach\" and her children £60 or 20 acres of land; to my \"dear and loving wife Ann Devereux,\" executrix with life estate in lands and household goods at her dispose; land in Dunstable to be sold to pay debts [EPR Case #7614].\n\nThe inventory of \"John Deverix Senr.\" of Marblehead was brought to court 25 March 1712 and consisted of only \"a thirty acre grant\" valued at £25 [EPR 310:419-20].\n\nA just claim by Elizabeth Barker of Deptford, England, daughter of Rev. Hugh Peters of Salem, prevented the passing of most of the estate as expressed in John's will, and his \"only surviving son Robert\" attempted to settle things as best he could as administrator cum testamento annexo [EPR Case #7614]. In the light of Barker's successful claim, Robert Devereux called together his brothers-in-law, sisters and their heirs to consider what was to be done to support their mother \"in her old age.\" In March 1703/4 at the Marblehead house of Dr. Jackson, Robert Devereux met with \"Joseph and Hannah Swett his wife, Anne Nichols, Bethia Bartlet, the said Hanah, Anna & Bethiah being three of the daughters of John Devouraux of Marblehead deceased, William Peach who married with Emm Devouraux one of the daughters as aforesaid and Joseph Abbet who married with Sarah Devouraux, granddaughter to said John Devouraux deceased,\" and discussed the tragedy of their loss [ELR 18:174].\n\nBIRTH: Between 1614 and 1621 (deposed aged fifty years March 1669 [EQC 4:114]; but still aged fifty years November 1670 [EQC 4:313]; aged about fifty-five years November 1672 [EQC 5:110]; aged about sixty years 29 March 1675 [EQC 6:19]; aged about sixty-four years probably in June 1679 [undated, EQC 7:200]; aged about sixty on 19 September 1681 [EQC 8:180]; aged about seventy years June 1684 [EQC 9:241]).\n\nDEATH: Marblehead between 24 December 1694 (deposition [ELR 11:131]) and 20 May 1695 (probate of will).\n\nMARRIAGE: Almost certainly by 1645, and certainly by 3 September 1657 [EQC 2:74], Ann _____; born about 1621 (deposed aged about forty-three for June 1664 court [EQC 3:158]; deposed aged forty-six in June 1667 [EQC 3:414]; aged fifty-four on 29 March 1675 [EQC 6:19]; aged about sixty years June, 1684 [EQC 9:241]); died on or shortly after 26 April 1708 (she is described as \"not being dead above three months\" on 26 July 1708 [EPR Case #7614]). (Mary Walton Ferris collected nine different clues that indicate that Ann was closely related, perhaps sister, to Margaret, wife of John Bennett [Dawes-Gates 2:293-94].)\n\nCHILDREN:\n\niHANNAH, b. say 1645; m.

Marblehead June 1737, aged 80); m. William Peach.\n\nASSOCIATIONS:\n\nIn depositions at the March Term, 1675, John and Ann described lodging Christopher Codner and his master, Joseph Emmons, cordwainer, at their house [EQC 6:19]. They were well enough acquainted that Ann could depose at the June Term, 1679, that Christopher was \"twenty-one years old the latter end of September last past\" [EQC 7:225]. Her knowledge of Christopher's age probably came from the fact that John Devereux and Christopher Lattimore were feoffees in trust for Christopher and Joane, children of the late Christopher Codner of Marblehead [ELR 2:31]. Young Christopher acknowledged that he had received full possession of his house and land in Marblehead from John \"Deverix Sr.\" and Richard Knott, at his majority 15 August 1679 [ELR 6:127].\n\nThe Devereuxs were well acquainted with John Bennett, and testified in June 1684 that \"Bennett built the house and lived in it and died there and was buried from there. Mary, mother of Jone Boobeer, had enjoyed the house twenty-seven years. Also that Jone, wife of Joseph Boobeer is the reputed daughter of Christopher Codner which he had by Mary, daughter of John Bennett\" [EQC 9:241]. John and Ann deposed that Mary, wife of Christopher Codner, lived many years with Richard Downing as his wife and had many children by him...[EQC 9:265, June Term, 1685].\n\nCOMMENTS: John Devereux \"undertook to pay\" the fines of Marmaduke Barton and Robert Allen who, at that same term of court, were convicted of receiving stolen silver and sentenced to be whipped on lecture day and Allen was ordered to serve his master, Mr. Williams, for an extra month. The connection that the two young offenders had to John Devereux is not immediately apparent [EQC 1:35].\n\nThroughout his life, John Devereux was in and out of court regarding suits for debts related to his business [EQC 1:42, 45, 320, 348, 409, 2:306, 4:414, 7:419]. In the estate inventories of many of his customers and suppliers, he appeared with debts or credits [EQC 1:106-7, 5:211, 6:308].\n\nHe was a debtor to the estate of George Pollard in September 1646 and the estate was, in turn, indebted to him for \"diet for two years and a quarter,\" £17 12s. [EQC 1:106; 107]. At November Term 1655 John sued Samuel Yew \"For killing his cow by the falling of a tree in the commons\" [EQC 1:409]. Capt. James Smith had a writ served on John Devereux for slander, 29 September 1670 [EQC 4:324].\n\nDevereux took the stand in many cases over the years, often giving his age. John Devereux and Sarah Allen were witnesses when John Peach Sr. was fined 20s. for \"giving Trustrum Dolliver opprobrious provoking words urging to a breach of the peace\" [EQC 1:49]. At July Term, 1645, John was a witness in the case against his neighbors Walter Price, William Browne and Samuel Archer for selling wine without a license [EQC 1:83]. He was again a witness at the February Term, 1645/6, when John Bartall was charged with working on the Sabbath [EQC 1:93]. John, aged fifty, deposed regarding the will of Susannah Pitts of Marblehead, November Term, 1670 [EQC 4:313]. John Devereux testified to the death of Mary Downing \"last winter\" at the June Term, 1684 [EQC 9:241]. He appraised the estates of several of his neighbors [EQC 2:259, 5:56] and once served as an administrator [EQC 3:136]. John was appointed and discharged as one of two feofees in trust for the Codner children [EQC 3:295, November Term, 1665]. Devereux contributed to the effort to build the new prison at Salem in late 1669 and was paid £4 5s. for felling 17 trees and dragging them to the water's edge [EQC 4:213]. In March 1669 John, aged fifty years, deposed that he was asked to witness an offer of bedding by Richard Rowland to Mr. Moses Maverick in April 1667, and that Maverick refused it [EQC 4:114].\n\nDespite his good works, he was a boisterous and sometimes violent neighbor. At the December Term, 1643, Devereux was fined a modest 40s. for striking Henry Stacy \"in his own house\" [EQC 1:58]. John Devereux and nine other men, including the contentious William Keene, were fined for drinking wine, \"etc.\" at the January Term, 1644/5 [EQC 1:77]. John Devereux was sued for debt by Thomas Gray of Marblehead over merchantable and refuse fish at the July Term, 1647 [EQC 1:116]. The resolution of the case must not have been acceptable, for at the March Term, 1647/8, John Devereux of Marblehead was fined for fighting with Thomas Gray, \"Also for breaking his face,\" as described by the witnesses, \"Walsingum\" Chilson and John Spark [EQC 1:135]. At the November Term, 1651, John sued Peter Pitford of Marblehead for defamation, claiming that Pitford often threatened him \"whereby he went in fear of him\" [EQC 1:243]. Perhaps he had reason to worry, for Pitford lived contentiously and was presented for striking Joseph Rogers \"several blows with his fist\" some years later [EQC 1:324].\n\nJohn Devereux's wife Ann was a good match in many ways. At the July Term, 1644, we presume it was Ann Devereux who was called \"Goody,\" indicating her husband's modest social standing. In this case, both John and Ann deposed regarding Alice Peach, wife of John Peach, Jr., defaming John Bartoll and his wife Alice, and Ann called John Peach a \"wittall\" [EQC 1:62]. She witnessed the 3 September 1657 agreement between Mr. William Paine of Ipswich, merchant, and William Beale of Marblehead, miller. When the arrangement went sour, \"Anne Devorex\" was called to depose about it at the June Term, 1658 [EQC 2:74]. Ann, aged about forty-three years, deposed that she weighed the pork for Andrew Rowland [EQC 3:158, June Term, 1664].\n\nTrespassing through the Downings' lot on their way to John Devereux's house, William Beale's wife, Frances Gilligan and Mary Parnel came to blows with Margaret Bennet over using the land as a highway. Devereux's servant, Robert Newman, aged about 17, deposed in this case and Bethiah and Ann Devereux witnessed Margaret Bennett's letter of attorney [EQC 3:414; 443].\n\nDevereux had many servants over the years, but not all stayed out of the courts. Devereux \"his man Thomas\" was a witness in the December 1642 case against William Keene, Devereux's old nemesis, but the charges were dropped since the house that was \"suffering disorder\" was not Keene's [EQC 1:48]. John Slade and John Ford deposed as workers for Mr. Devereux's farm [EQC 4:285, September Term, 1670]. Devereux servants John Hobbs and \"one Francis\" stole turkeys from Richard Downing in 1683 [EQC 9:146]. Sons John and Humphrey were not above reproach, and were sentenced to be fined or whipped for being part of a group of boys that met at night and committed petty theft [EQC 4:274 June Term, 1670].\n\nIn another extensive case, Christopher Nicholson is charged with pulling down the fence that John Devereux had erected near some rocks by the water. With the fence gone, a great deal of petty thievery went on, and some of Devereux's servants and hired hands were obliged to watch constantly, much to their inconvenience. While John was gone, Ann went to the selectmen for permission to erect another fence. This almost accomplished by servant Robert Paty, Christopher Nicholson came and pulled it down again. The outcome of this June Term 1662 case was in Devereux's favor [EQC 2:407-9, 431]. John prevailed in a suit against Mr. Moses Maverick, John Peach, Sr. and Jr., and Richard Rowland for failing to set up a fence as agreed, but it was repeatedly appealed and he ultimately lost. This troublesome boundary cost him a lost horse and a bull mired and killed, as well as his corn threatened by animals so that he had to keep watch even at night [EQC 4:190, 251, 285, 289]. John's trouble with fences lasted for decades [EQC 7:5-6, June Term, 1678; EQC 7:324, November Term, 1679]. John sued John Codner \"for removing a landmark\" and won in the May Term, 1670\n\nAt the June Term, 1679, John Devereux Sr., aged about sixty-four years, testified that about thirty-four years ago he cut hay in Kittell Cove marsh and was forbidden by Rev. Blinman of Cape Ann, but they afterwards agreed\n\nJohn Devereux, aged about sixty years, deposed that having been many years inhabitant of Marblehead, and still resident there, and having no interest in the property then under controversy, that the land had been owned by Marblehead men for the past thirty-four years\n\n\"The Testimony of John Devereux of Marblehead aged about eighty years, testifieth & saith that about the year of our Lord one thousand six hundred & thirty I came over from old England to New England & the place of my abode and residence has been at Salem & Marblehead ever since & when I came hither here was an old Squaw called old Squaw Sachem the Squaw of the deceased sachem which had three reputed sons, viz: John, James and George, who were the reputed sachems & owners of all the lands in these parts as Salem, Marblehead, Lynn and as far as Mystic & in those days the land where Salem town now stands & the lands adjacent were called Nahumkege by the Indians & English then inhabiting in these parts,\" 24 December 1694\n\nIsle of Wight County - St. Lukes Church Established in 1632, \"oldest existing church of English foundation in America \"\n\nMISC NOTE - Some of the descendants of Leonard Dozier I of France went to South Carolina and Georgia in the mid 1700s and some of their descendants migrated to Tennessee and North Carolina later.\n\nJames Ingo Dozier and his children all came to Kentucky about 1779;\n\nfour of the five sons stayed in Kentucky\n\n(Leonard in Madison Co.,\n\nJohn in Muhlenberg,\n\nJames in Lewis\n\nZachariah in Montgomery)\n\nwhile Thomas migrated from Nelson Co. to Missouri.\n\nOne of James Ingo's daughters married a Cash and moved to Bedford, TN.\n\nProbably, all the Missouri Doziers are descendants of Leonard I,they just took different routes to get there.\n\n1633 FRANCE - CATHERINE DAUGE Female Birth: 1633, , France Death 1680, , France Spouse BERTRAND LAREGLE Marriage: 1656, , FranceFamily Search - LDS\n\nVirginia - James City County was one of eight original shires designated in 1634.

County court records begin with 1652, when Surry was formed from the part of James City County that lay southwest of James River. Mr. William Thomas, Mr. William Edwards, and Mr. George Stephens were Surry County's first representatives intheHouse of Burgesses(the General Assembly) that year.\n\nSurry County was cut off from James City in 1652. Surry was formed from the part of James City County that lay southwest of James River. From 1738 the only Anglican parish in the Sussex County area was Albemarle\n\nOrigin of Name. Named for the county of Surrey in England. County Formation. Formed from James City County south of the James River by 1652. [Hening's Statutes at Large, vol. 1, page 373] During 1723 the\n\nGeneral Assembly took away part of the county to form Brunswick County [Hening's Statutes at Large, vol. 4, page 77-79] though the residents continued to go to the Surry courthouse until 1732 when they added more of\n\nSurry County to Brunswick. [Hening's Statutes at Large, vol. 4, page 355-6] The central portion of the original Surry County became Sussex County in 1753. [Hening's Statutes at Large, vol. 6, page 384-5] Episcopal Parishes. When it was formed, Surry County included Southwark Parish, created in 1647, [Hening's Statutes at Large, vol. 1, page 347] and Lawnes Creek, created in January 1639/40. [Hening's Statutes at Large, vol.\n\n1, page 29] Albemarle Parish was created in 1738 from parts of Southwark and Lawnes Creek south of the Blackwater River. [Hening's Statutes at Large, vol. 5, page 75-78] This same act of the General Assembly terminated Lawnes Creek by merging it with Southwark. Albemarle conformed with Sussex County\n\nwhen it was erected in 1753.\n\nSURRY & SUSSEX COs WERE PART OF \"THE SOUTHERN TIDEWATER REGION\"\n\nPRINCE GEORGE WAS THE WESTERLY NEIGHBORING SOUTHEASTERN PIEDMONT REGION\n\n1653 Preussen- GERDRUDIS DAUGEFemale Christening 22 JUN 1653 Sankt Martinus Katholisch, Nottuln, Westfalen, Preussen Parents: Father BERNARDT DAUGE Mother SUSANNA (WEUERS) Family Search - LDS\n\nGranville County, NC - Indenture - Dozer to Kendrick, 1756\n\nGranville County Deed Book C, pages 88-89Dozer This Indenture made the ninth day of August in the XXXth year ofto the Reign of our Sovereign Lord the Second by the Grace of God Kendrickof Great Britain France & Ireland King defender of the faith & andExamdin the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred & fifty sixDecr. 1756Between John Dozer of Granville County in the province of North Carolina of the one part and William Kendrick of the County & provinceaforesaid of the other part Witnesseth that the sd.

Southwark Parish was separated from James City Parish in 1647, and Surry County was separated from James City County five years later. Soon afterward Arthur Allen built his Jacobean brick house, now known as Bacon's Castle because it was occupied as a fort or \"castle\" during Bacon's Rebellion in 1676.\n\nSC and Jamaica\n\nPeter Pierre Dugue, son of Jacques \"James\" Dugué and his first wife Judith (Soumin), was documented in the St. Julien List of Huguenots seeking naturalization in South Carolina in about 1696.\n\nPierre Peter DUGUÉ, and Isaac Dugue, son frère, et Élizabeth Dugué, leur sæur, néz à Bésance en Bery, enfans de Jacques James Dugué et d'Élizabeth (Dupuy).\n\nPierre Peter Dugue was the second oldest son of Jacques James Dugué, an adult in 1696 and administrator of his father’s estate following the death of his older brother, Jacques James.\n\nSince he was an adult in 1696, he was born no later than 1675.\n\nPierre Peter’s share of his father’s estate was the plantation (Jacques James Dugués’ original 500 acre grant) on New Town Creek, James’s Island, SC; two town lots in Charles Town, SC, numbered 165 and 186; a negro boy and £2.5.10 sterling.\n\nPeter moved to Jamaica sometime during or before 1706.\n\nReferences to his family there are found primarily in the register of St. Andrew’s Parish, Jamaica, which includes the town and port of Kingston\n\nVolume I, Register of St. Andrews’s Parish, Jamaica: p. 272 burial of Walter “Dugou” 4 Nov 1706 p. 195 marriage of Peter Pierre Dugue and Dorothy (Struyse), 23 Sep 1707\n\np. 47 baptism of Judith, daughter of Peter Pierre and Dorothy (?)

Wragg became a very successful businessman in the Georgetown, SC, area.\n\nAmong the business interests that Peter retained in South Carolina was the property that he inherited from his father.\n\nOn 27 and 28 Feb 1726 a deed by Richard Grimston for lot #229 in Charleston lists N on Mr. Dugue, E on John Hill, W on Thomas Rose.\n\nThis shows that Peter Dugue retained ownership of Lot #186, on King Street between Broad and Tradd, which he had inherited from his father in 1696.\n\nA memorial for Lawrence Dennis dated 1733 for property on the south side of Newtown Creek on James Island in South Carolina identifies Peter Dugue as an adjacent landowner on the east side in that year.\n\nThe original document has been examined by the author and a staff archivist at the South Carolina Department of Archives` and History and clearly refers to him as a contemporary, not a past, landowner.\n\nThis also was land that Peter inherited from his father in 1696.\n\nSeries Number: S111001 Volume:0003 Page:00248 Item: 01 Date: 1733/05/08 Description: DENNIS, LAWRENCE, MEMORIAL FOR TWO TRACTS CONTAINING 633 ACRES ON JAMES ISLAND, BERKLEY COUNTY.

This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770 by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont.\n\nOn March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. The other two were called Tryon County (later renamed Montgomery County) and Charlotte County.\n\nIn 1784, the name \"Charlotte County\" was changed to honor George Washington, the American Revolutionary War general and later President of the United States of America.\n\nIn 1788, Clinton County was split off from Washington County. This was a much larger area than the present Clinton County, including several other counties or county parts of the present New York State.\n\nIn 1791, the Town of Cambridge was transferred from Albany County to Washington County.\n\nIn 1813, Warren County was split off from Washington County. [1]\n\nIn 1994, with the completion of the new municipal center, the county seat was moved from Hudson Falls to Fort Edward.\n\nIn 2006, Cambridge Town Supervisor Jo Ann Trinkle made history by becoming the first Chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors.\n\nStroud Family Pedigree\n\nJohn b1680 England, d1737 VA m Hannah (?)\n\nWilliam b1700 VA d1783 NC m Margaret (Rose)\n\nJohn b1726 VA d1776 GA m Martha (Dozier)\n\nSherwood (Sherod) b1755 NC d1838 GA m Hannah (?)\n\nSherwood Jr b1799 Ga b1864 GA m Elizabeth (Pace)\n\nArchibald T b1834 GA d 1912 OK m Mary C (Morrow)\n\nDaniel A b1877 OK d1966 CA m Nora B (Barrett)\n\nWesley T b1914 OK d 2002 CA m Katherine (Housewright)\n\nGale D b 1937 CA m Jean Parmenter\n\nScott D b1965 CA\n\nwww.worldfamilies.net\n\nFRANCE and SC - Isaac Dugue - Isaac Dugue is first documented by the St. Julien List;\n\nPIERRE DUGUÉ, Isaac Dugue, son frère, et Élizabeth (?) Dugué, leur sæur, néz à Bésance en Bery, enfans de Jacques Dugué et d'Élizabet (Dupuy).\n\nIsaac Dugue was the youngest son, a minor at the time his father’s estate was settled in 1696 (see Charleston SC file for details).\n\nHe was the son of Elizabeth (DuPuy / Dupey / Depey ) DuGué, and was presumably born not too long before his sister, who was born in South Carolina after the family’s immigration in 1685.\n\nThus it is reasonable to suppose that Isaac was born in about 1682-4.\n\nJamaica parish records on Isaac’s family are incomplete.\n\nThere is no marriage record.\n\nThe documentation begins with the christening of a child in 1709:52\n\nClarendon Parish Register, Vol. I\n\np. 27 Elizabeth, daughter of Isaac and Mary (?) Dugue, baptized 27 Dec 1709\n\nThe next reference is many years later, in an adjacent parish\n\nSt. Dorothy’s Parish Register, Vol. I\n\np. 3 baptized Grace, daughter of Isaac and Mary Dugue, 5 Apr 1723\n\np. 4 buried Isaac Dugue, 1731\n\np. 7 baptized unnamed daughter of Eleanor Rogers by Hugh Dugue, 24 Oct 1739\n\np. 8 buried Hugh Dugue, 5 Feb 1741\n\np. 13 Grace (Dugue) married John Skinner 13 Jan 1749\n\np. 14 buried Mary Dugue, widow, age 67, 29 Sep 1749\n\nSt. Dorothy’s was separated from Clarendon Parish in 1696, so the shift in parishes over the years is not the result of St. Dorothy’s separation from Clarendon Parish. Neither parish register is incomplete for the relevant years.\n\nThus it is clear that Isaac and his family were elsewhere when the majority of his children were born. With an interval of 14 years between the documented children, he could easily have had seven more children than those shown in the register.\n\nThe references to Hugh Dugue confirm the existence of additional children besides those christened in the two parishes.\n\nOne likely place for Isaac and his family during the 1709-1723 period was Montego Bay on the north side of Jamaica, the second largest town and port on the island.\n\nUnfortunately, St. James Parish records only exist from 1770 on, although the parish was established in 1655.\n\nIsaac could also have been on another West Indian island, in South Carolina, or (much less likely) in England.\n\nThe following reference shows that in 1724 Isaac sold his interest in property in Charleston to Paul Trapier, who had married his sister Elizabeth\n\nBook D, p. 92, 6 Aug 1724, Deed of Sale. Isaac Dugue, shipwright, to his brother-in-law, Paul Trapier, planter, for £250 SC money, ½ of ¼ of a half town lot in Charleston.\n\nWhere as Jacque James Dugue Sr., father of Isaac,\n\nby will dated 28 May 1686 gave his 5 children,\n\nIsaac,\n\nPeter,\n\nMary,\n\nJudith\n\nElizabeth,\n\nhis granddaughter Mariane Dugue all his real and personal estate, share & share alike; and whereas the estate was duly divided on 27 Oct 1696, among other things allowing Isaac Dugue & his sister Elizabeth (in equal halves) a certain part of a lot in Charleston being ¼ of ½ of 1 town lot fronting to the Broad Street, bounding S on the Broad Street, E on Dr. John Deleaure, W & N on Elizabeth Burtell, which part of a lot their father James had purchased from James Dubourdeaux, blacksmith, on 31 Oct 1687; and whereas Paul Trapier by marrying Elizabeth Dugue became heir to ½ of the ¼ part of the ½ town lot & half the buildings; now Isaac Dugue sells his half to Trapier.\n\nWitnesses: James Searon, Peter Herman, Anthony Bonneau, Jr., Before Thomas Hepworth. Jacob Motte, Registrar.\n\nIsaac’s continued ownership of the Charleston SC property suggests that he had longterm interests there.\n\nHowever, it is not hard to understand his sale of his interest in 1724.\n\nThis was only two years after the disastrous year 1722, when Jamaica experienced a terrible hurricane, an earthquake, and a rebellion.\n\nHe doubtless needed the money, and a shared interest in Charleston property was easy to give up.\n\nHowever, he was apparently present in Charleston for the sale, since he acted on his own behalf. It is likely that there were many visits to Charleston over the years.\n\nAnthony Bonneau, Jr., witness to the 1724 transfer of property interest by Isaac Dugue, later reappears among the witnesses to the will of John Snow in St. Thomas and St. Denis Parish, along with Thomas Goodman Duke.\n\nThis is one of many specific family connections shared by the people named Dugue and Duke in the Charleston area.\n\nThe Dague family in France -\n\nThe Dozier's (Dague) family in America are descended fromJames Jaques Dauge and his brother Leonard.\n\nBoth landed in a French settlement on the Nasamond River near Norfolk, Virginia prior to 1683.\n\nBoth were born in France possible to Pierre Dauge who lived in Nonbonne, France.\n\nAuge is also a small providence in France near the Niart in Western France.\n\nThe name was changed over the years in America however some lines kept the original spelling.\n\nNow I am confussed on the Dozier surname.\n\nThere are some Duke Surnames with the Dugue surname. ?????? are they Doziers ??????\n\nbefore 1683 FRANCE, Va, and NC -\n\nJames Jacques DAUGE bef 1683-1719 Province Of Berry, France\n\nAdditional Notes Migration Steps\n\nJacque James and his brother Leonard Dozier (1643-1693) were French Hugenots from France.\n\nIn his last will and testament in 1719 he left land in Princess Ann County, Virginia to his\n\ndaughters\n\nMary(1675-? m.
