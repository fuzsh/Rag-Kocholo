        "text": "Born in Brookline, Massachusetts on November 20, 1925. His parents were Joseph, a successful businessman, and Rose, daughter of the mayor of Boston known as “Honey Fitz.”\n\nRaised as devout Roman Catholics, Robert Kennedy and his seven siblings enjoyed a life of wealth and privilege. Among Kennedy’s older brothers was future U.S. President John F. Kennedy.\n\nKennedy Travels to Palestine, Lebanon, Turkey, Greece, and Italy as a special correspondent for the Boston Post.\n\nWhile touring Jerusalem at age 22, he was arrested, blindfolded, and brought to the Haganah headquarters, where he was advised to stay off of the streets.\n\nInvites Ralph Bunche, an Black American who had received the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in ending the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, to speak at the University of Virginia Law School. Bunche refused to speak before a segregated audience; Kennedy’s passionate argument before the university’s governing board persuaded them to agree to an integrated event.\n\n“The future of the world belongs, not just to the younger generation of my countries, but to the younger generation of all countries”\n\nEmbarks on a multi-nation tour with Ethel, carrying a message of freedom and democracy to students and leaders around the Globe. Stops included Berlin, Jakarta and Tokyo. “Just Friends and Brave Enemies” is published, capturing highlights of that trip.\n\nDuring the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Robert Kennedy works closely with his brother, President John F. Kennedy, and other cabinet members to avert nuclear war with the Soviet Union over missiles it had placed in Cuba. Robert Kennedy is especially instrumental in negotiating a solution with Soviet ambassador to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin.\n\nKennedy sends Deputy Attorney General Nicholas de Katzenbach to escort Vivian Malone and James A. Hood as they enroll in the University of Alabama, where Governor George Wallace stood in the door of the administration building, attempting to block their entrance. That night, JFK delivers speech calling civil rights “a moral issue,” a phrasing that RFK had urged.\n\n“America’s answer to the intolerant man is diversity – the very diversity which our heritage of religious freedom has inspired.”\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Testifies before the Senate Commerce Committee on behalf of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nSpearheads “Free Schools” program in Prince Edward County, VA, where local officials had closed public schools in 1959 rather than integrate them.\n\nFunded by a combination of private, public, and foundation money, the Free Schools Program leased the closed public school buildings and hired teachers from around the country to offer local Black students the education that they were constitutionally entitled to.\n\nAs Attorney General, Robert Kennedy had in many ways served as the administration’s spokesman on the law, and he was instrumental in persuading Senator Everett Dirksen, the minority leader, to support the bill, ensuring that civil rights supporters could overcome the Southern Democrats’ filibuster.\n\nOn March 7, 1965, John Lewis led a peaceful march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, demanding voting rights for Black Americans. When Lewis and his followers saw law enforcement, they dropped to their knees and prayed. That’s when state troopers and deputized Klansmen on horseback whipped, trampled and beat the marchers. John Lewis bore the scars of that day throughout his life.\n\nRead Heather Cox Richardson’s analysis of the marches and Bloody Sunday here.\n\n“Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.”\n\nAnnounces a major revitalization effort in Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. An innovative partnership between the federal government, private enterprise, and the neighborhood’s residents and leaders, results in the formation of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, the nation’s first community development nonprofit, which endures to this day.\n\nThat same year, his family and friends established a living memorial to carry forth his unfinished work in efforts to realize his dream of a more just and peaceful world.\n\n“All of us may wish at times that we lived in a more tranquil world, but we don’t. And if our times are difficult and perplexing, so are they challenging and filled with opportunity.”\n\nBe a part of continuing Robert F. Kennedy’s vision for a more peaceful and just world.\n\nJoin Us →"
