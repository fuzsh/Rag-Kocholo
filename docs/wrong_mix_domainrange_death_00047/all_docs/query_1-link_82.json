        "text": "Despite opposition from both parties, including legal challenges, Kennedy’s campaign has been particularly adept at slogging through an arcane 50-state process with 50 different rules to get ballot access.\n\nIndeed, it hasn’t been denied access in a single state so far.\n\nThe campaign claimed last week that its ballot access efforts were fully financed, thanks to a donation from Kennedy’s running mate Nicole Shanahan. It won a key court case and partnered with existing political parties in Michigan and California. The Kennedy campaign also created its own party in a few other states where it was either required or, in the case of Hawaii, required fewer signatures than needed for an individual candidate to get on the ballot.\n\nKennedy supporters believe it’s just a matter of time until they start seeing a flood of other states officially putting the candidate on their respective ballots for voters in November, depending largely on certain dates when the states will act.\n\nHowever, the Kennedy campaign may not have that much time.\n\nLast week, President Biden and former president Donald Trump agreed to a pair of debates to be held in June and September. CNN, the host of the June debate, listed criteria that would possibly allow Kennedy to participate in the debate if he met a certain polling threshold and if he had secured ballot access in states totaling at least 270 electoral votes. (Biden’s campaign said it only agreed to debate Trump and not appear on stage with anyone else.)\n\nSuddenly, Kennedy’s path to get on as many ballots as quickly as possible mattered.\n\nOn its website, the Kennedy campaign suggests it is on enough state ballots that it would receive 207 Electoral College votes if it won all of those states, which is still far short of the 270 needed to make the debate.\n\nHowever, nearly a quarter of those electoral votes come from California, a state Kennedy is set to make the ballot running with the American Independence Party, but that won’t be certified until Aug. 29 at the earliest, when the secretary of state takes up the matter.\n\nKennedy’s 207 number also includes Texas, where the campaign has formally submitted more than twice the required signatures, but the state is still in the process of certifying. Then there are states like New Jersey, Idaho, and Nebraska, where the campaign says it has collected enough signatures but has not turned them in, even though it could right now, and deadlines are approaching.\n\nIn New Hampshire and Iowa — also included in the Kennedy count — the filing periods to submit signatures have not yet opened, but the campaign claims it has enough signatures to get on those ballots.\n\nAt the moment, however, the five states that have certified that Kennedy is on the ballot add up to 35 Electoral College votes.\n\nKennedy’s campaign did not respond to specific questions about the discrepancy between its claims of ballot access and what states have confirmed.\n\nBy design by leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties, it is hard for third-party candidates to get on the ballot. The group No Labels found it hard even though it had significant funding. In 2020, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg concluded it was far easier to run as a Democrat than it was to try an independent bid.\n\nThat is partially why this spring Kennedy has appeared in completely different states than the six or so main swing states that Biden and Trump have been focused on. He has campaigned largely at rallies aimed at getting signatures in various states.\n\nAt the moment, it has been a good strategy, even if the campaign’s claims about its success have been premature."
