        "text": "Sirhan Sirhan, the man convicted of assassinating Robert F Kennedy, has been stabbed at a California prison, US media reports say.\n\nAuthorities said a stabbing happened at a prison near San Diego on Friday afternoon.\n\nIn a statement, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said \"officers responded quickly\" to the attack.\n\nThe victim, whose condition is stable, was not named in the statement.\n\nBut citing unnamed law enforcement sources, multiple US media reports have identified 75-year-old Sirhan as the victim.\n\nSirhan is serving a life sentence at the Richard J Donovan Correctional Facility, where the stabbing took place.\n\nThe suspected attacker, a fellow inmate, has been placed in isolation, according to TMZ, which first reported the assault.\n\nThe motive for the attack, which is under investigation, has not been revealed by officials.\n\nWho is Sirhan Sirhan?\n\nSirhan was convicted of murdering presidential hopeful Kennedy, who he shot three times at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968.\n\nKennedy was shot in the kitchen of the hotel, shortly after declaring victory in California's Democratic presidential primary to cheering crowds.\n\nThe New York senator, brother of former Democratic president John F Kennedy, died in hospital 24 hours later.\n\nHe was later buried at Arlington Cemetery, near his brother John, who was assassinated in 1963.\n\nAt his trial in 1969, Sirhan was originally sentenced to death. Three years later, however, his sentence was commuted to life in prison when California briefly outlawed capital punishment.\n\nA Palestinian with Jordanian citizenship, Sirhan has claimed he has no recollection of shooting Kennedy."
