        "text": "Quantum field theory had already formed the basis of quantum electromagnetism, a very successful description of the electromagnetic interaction. Applying a similar approach to the weak interaction was however not possible due to a fundamental issue: the theory didn’t allow for particles to have mass.\n\nSpecifically, the weak force carriers known as the W and Z bosons had to be massless, otherwise a fundamental symmetry of the theory would be broken and the theory would not work. This posed a major problem since the weak force carriers had to be massive to be consistent with the very short range of the weak interaction.\n\nThe solution to this problem was found with the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism. This mechanism has two main components: an entirely new quantum field and a special trick. The new field is what we now call the Higgs field, and the trick is spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\nA spontaneously broken symmetry is one that is present in the equations of a theory but broken in the physical system. Imagine a pencil standing on its tip at the centre of a table. A perfectly symmetrical situation, but only for a moment: the pencil would immediately fall, breaking the rotational symmetry by selecting a single direction in which the pencil would be pointing. The laws of Nature however would remain unchanged, without a predefined direction written into them. So, the lack of symmetry was essentially “tricked” into the picture, without upsetting the symmetry of physics.\n\nThe way this works for particle masses is as follows: when the universe was born, it was filled with the Higgs field in an unstable – but symmetrical – state. A fraction of a second after the Big Bang, the field found a stable configuration, but one that breaks the initial symmetry. In this configuration, the equations remain symmetrical, but the broken symmetry of the Higgs field gives rise to the masses of the W and Z bosons.\n\nAs it later turned out, other elementary particles also acquire masses by interacting with the Higgs field, giving rise to the particle properties we observe today."
