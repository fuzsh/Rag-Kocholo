        "text": "In our current description of Nature, every particle is a wave in a field. The most familiar example of this is light: light is simultaneously a wave in the electromagnetic field and a stream of particles called photons.\n\nIn the Higgs boson's case, the field came first. The Higgs field was proposed in 1964 as a new kind of field that fills the entire Universe and gives mass to all elementary particles. The Higgs boson is a wave in that field. Its discovery confirms the existence of the Higgs field.\n\nParticles get their mass by interacting with the Higgs field; they do not have a mass of their own.\n\nThe stronger a particle interacts with the Higgs field, the heavier the particle ends up being. Photons, for example, do not interact with this field and therefore have no mass. Yet other elementary particles, including electrons, quarks and bosons, do interact and hence have a variety of masses.\n\nThis mass-giving interaction with the Higgs field is known as the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism, proposed by theorists Robert Brout, François Englert and Peter Higgs.\n\nThe Higgs boson can't be “discovered” by finding it somewhere but has to be created in a particle collision. Once created, it transforms – or “decays” – into other particles that can be detected in particle detectors.\n\nPhysicists look for traces of these particles in data collected by the detectors. The challenge is that these particles are also produced in many other processes, plus the Higgs boson only appears in about one in a billion LHC collisions. But careful statistical analysis of enormous amounts of data uncovered the particle's faint signal in 2012.\n\nOn 4 July 2012, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations announced the discovery of a new particle to a packed auditorium at CERN.\n\nThis particle had no electrical charge, it was short-lived and it decayed in ways that the Higgs boson should, according to theory. To confirm if it really was the Higgs boson, physicists needed to check its “spin” – the Higgs boson is the only particle to have a spin of zero.\n\nBy examining two and a half times more data, they concluded in March 2013 that, indeed, some kind of Higgs boson had been discovered.\n\nDiscovering the Higgs boson was just the beginning. In the ten years since, physicists have examined how strongly it interacts with other particles, to see if this matches theoretical predictions.\n\nInteraction strength can be measured experimentally by looking at Higgs boson production and decay: the heavier a particle the more likely the Higgs boson is to decay into or be produced from it. Interaction with tau leptons was discovered in 2016 and interaction with top and bottom quarks in 2018.\n\nBut there is much more still to learn about this elusive particle.\n\nWe still have much to learn about the Higgs boson.\n\nIs it one-of-a-kind or is there a whole Higgs sector of particles? Does it help to explain how the universe was formed, with matter triumphing over antimatter? Does it get its mass by interacting with itself in some way? And why is its mass so small, suggesting the existence of a whole new mechanism.\n\nCould dark matter and other new particles be found thanks to interactions with the Higgs boson?\n\nTen years after the discovery, the journey has only just begun."
