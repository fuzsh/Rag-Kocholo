        "text": "Peter Higgs, a British theoretical physicist who discovered the Higgs Boson also commonly called the ‘God Particle’ has passed away at the age of 94.\n\nCan you imagine a world without particles, it probably wouldn’t exist especially if it didn’t have mass. These particles with mass helped form stars, planets, and life itself. This theory was ratified with the discovery of the ‘God particle.’\n\nHiggs passed away yesterday [Monday, April 8, 2024] following a short illness.\n\nNobel Prize winner in Physics\n\nHe was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics for his work explaining the formation of the universe was a result of the particles gaining mass in 2013 alongside Francois Englert. The theory was proposed in 1964\n\nHowever, his theory was confirmed after 50 years of research in 2012 when it was examined by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.\n\nCERN describes that the Higgs Boson’s every particle is a wave in a field. Exemplifying this with light, the organization stated: “Light is simultaneously a wave in the electromagnetic field and a stream of particles called photons.”\n\n“In the Higgs boson’s case, the field came first. The Higgs field was proposed in 1964 as a new kind of field that fills the entire Universe and gives mass to all elementary particles. The Higgs boson is a wave in that field. Its discovery confirms the existence of the Higgs field.”\n\nThe renowned physicist, also a member of the Royal Society and a Companion of Honour spent most of his professional life at Edinburgh University.\n\nIn 2012, the university established the Higgs Center for theoretical physics to honor Higgs.\n\n“Peter Higgs was a remarkable individual – a truly gifted scientist whose vision and imagination have enriched our knowledge of the world that surrounds us,” stated prof Peter Mathieson, Principal and Vice Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh.\n\n“His pioneering work has motivated thousands of scientists, and his legacy will continue to inspire many more for generations to come,” added Mathieson.\n\n‘A giant particle has left us’\n\n“Besides his outstanding contributions to particle physics, Peter was a very special person, a man of rare modesty, a great teacher and someone who explained physics in a very simple and profound way,” also expressed prof Fabiola Gianotti, the director general at CERN and Atlas experiments’ former leader (it helped discover the Higgs particle in 2012).\n\n“An important piece of CERN’s history and accomplishments is linked to him. I am very saddened, and I will miss him sorely.”\n\nJohn Ellis, the former head of theory at CERN told The Guardian that a giant of particle physics has left the world.\n\n“Without his theory, atoms could not exist and radioactivity would be a force as strong as electricity and magnetism.”\n\n“Even when the universe seems empty this field is there. Without it, we would not exist, because it is from contact with the field that particles acquire mass,” articulated Jon Butterworth, a member of the Atlas collaboration.\n\nHe asserted that the theory proposed by Englert and Higgs describes this process."
