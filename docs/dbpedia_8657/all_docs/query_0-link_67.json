        "text": "The story of the Higgs boson is instructive, since it demonstrates rather clearly the way that experiment informs theory, and conversely the way that theory guides experiment. It is very unusual in science for a prediction to be made so long before its experimental verification. In 1964 particle accelerators and detectors were still rather primitive, and computing was in its infancy: theorists worked mostly with pencil and paper, and experimentalists could only dream of a machine capable of exploring electroweak symmetry breaking.\n\nThe discovery of a Higgs boson at CERN in 2012 was a fantastic technological and sociological achievement. But above all it was a remarkable demonstration of the predictive power of the human mind.\n\nMore information about Peter and his boson may be found on the University of Edinburgh Peter Higgs web pages.\n\nThe long and winding road to the Higgs boson"
