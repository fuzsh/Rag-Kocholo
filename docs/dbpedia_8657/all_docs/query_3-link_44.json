        "text": "Steven Weinberg, a theoretical physicist who discovered that two of the universe’s forces are really the same, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and who helped lay the foundation for the development of the Standard Model, a theory that classifies all known elementary particles in the universe, making it one of the most important breakthroughs in physics in the 20th century, died on Friday in a hospital in Austin, Texas. He was 88.\n\nHis daughter, Dr. Elizabeth Weinberg, confirmed the death but did not specify a cause.\n\nDr. Weinberg’s stature in physics would be hard to overstate.\n\nIn 2011, Dr. Brian Greene, a theoretical physicist at Columbia University, invited Dr. Weinberg to be the inaugural speaker at a new lecture series, titled “On the Shoulders of Giants,” produced by the World Science Festival at New York University. While introducing his guest, Dr. Greene related how, in the early 1980s, he was working at I.B.M. when he was invited to give a lecture at the University of Texas at Austin, where Dr. Weinberg was a professor. When he told his boss, John Cocke, a pioneer of computer science, that Dr. Weinberg would be at the talk, Dr. Cocke warned him, “You should know, there are Nobel laureates and then there are Nobel laureates.” Dr. Weinberg was in the second category.\n\nThough he had the respect, almost awe, of his colleagues for his scientific abilities and insights, he also possessed a rare ability among scientists to communicate and explain abstruse scientific ideas to the public. He was a sought-after speaker, and he wrote several popular books about science, notably “The First Three Minutes: A Modern View of the Origin of the Universe” (1977).\n\nThe work for which Dr. Weinberg was awarded the Nobel had a transformative impact on physics, in particular on the development of quantum mechanics, which tries to understand and explain what happens in the subatomic world.\n\nThere are four known forces in the universe: gravity; electromagnetism; the strong force, which binds the nuclei of atoms together; and the weak force, which causes radioactive decay. The first two forces have been known for centuries, but the other two were discovered only in the first two decades of the 20th century.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
