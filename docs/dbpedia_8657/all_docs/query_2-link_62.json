She will receive the Kluyver Prize for the best English-language abstract in her dissertation within Nikhef (Nationaal instituut voor subatomaire fysica). Muller received her PhD in summer 2023 for her doctoral work on the KM3NeT experiment, which is an undersea neutrino telescope that is under construction in the Mediterranean Sea. Her dissertation Getting to the Point is a first attempt to pinpoint sources of neutrinos in the sky with measurements from KM3NeT. Notable in her dissertation is an epilogue on science communication. During her doctoral work, she regularly appeared on television programs about science and was a speaker or presenter at events. Muller: ‚ÄòThat last extra chapter actually stems from my frustration that there is a kind of public fear of science things. That‚Äôs not justified, of course, but does lie in part very much with science and scientists themselves. We are often arrogant and don‚Äôt make enough effort to engage people. Even among ourselves, by the way: all those incomprehensible stories at conferences and in talks, a terrible waste of time and money.‚Äô The Jan Kluyver prize for the best English summary of a Nikhef PhD thesis was established in 2010 by the Education Committee of the Research School for Subatomic Physics. The jury consists of the former directors of Nikhef.

We use a cosmological simulation called \"Simulation of the LOcal Web (SLOW)\", which simulates the local universe and therefore contains galaxy clusters that resemble digital twins of their real counterparts. We propose that the Fornax and Virgo clusters are the most promising candidates hosting detectable AQN signatures. This work was a collaboration with Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen, Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Astrophysik, The University of British Columbia, Universit√© de Lille, Universit√© Paris-Saclay, Leibniz-Institut f√ºr Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP). This paper represents a milestone in my career as my first first-authored paper, and I am looking forward to more in the future! üöÄ\n\nProfessor Cetto, working at Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico, has achieved something incredible. She's made science accessible in various indigenous languages. This is a big step in making science available to more people. üìö Her Book and Projects: She's authored a popular book on light and is actively involved in projects to improve urban lighting and reduce light pollution. That's making a real difference in one of the world's largest cities! üåê Back in 2014... ...when I completed my PhD in Physics at the University of Antwerp & Universidad de Guanajuato and started my Post-Doc in the University of Antwerp, I was one of less than 20 female Mexican physicists working abroad (source: https://lnkd.in/e-J-NDEF). During this time, Mexico faced a grim reality with 8,904 feminicides between 2014 and 2017 (source: https://lnkd.in/eU2zRZHp). It's a harsh reminder that for many women, the fight is about survival, not just achieving dreams. üåç A Realistic Perspective: Ana Mar√≠a Cetto's achievement is extraordinary, but it's important to remember that these are rare successes in a system that often doesn't provide equal opportunities for all women and minorities. Her story is a source of inspiration, but it also highlights the need for systemic change. üî≠ Moving Forward: Ana Mar√≠a Cetto's recognition by UNESCO is significant. It shows the impact one can have in science, it also underscores the need for greater inclusivity and support for women and minorities in STEM fields, especially in countries like Mexico. Let's celebrate her achievements and continue advocating for a world where every person has the opportunity to pursue her/his/their dreams without barriers. #UNESCO #ScienceForAll #WomenInSTEM #Inspiration #AnaMariaCetto #unescoGC #OpenScience\n\nüöÄ Exciting News! üöÄ Check out my latest research paper in the International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology! The paper is titled \"INTEGRATING QUANTUM ALGORITHMS WITH GRAVITATIONAL-WAVE METROLOGY FOR ENHANCED SIGNAL DETECTION\". This study explores the integration of quantum algorithms, specifically Grover's algorithm, with quantum metrology to enhance the efficiency and sensitivity of gravitational-wave detection. By leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement, our approach improves signal detection, reduces noise, and strategically optimizes the circuit. The findings demonstrate significant improvements in the sensitivity and accuracy of gravitational wave measurements, highlighting the potential of quantum technologies to revolutionize observational astronomy and enhance our understanding of the universe. üìù Check out the full paper here: https://lnkd.in/dUg2WJrm\n\nPublication alert! Out now in Nature Physics: https://lnkd.in/dXFNguUk (PDF: https://rdcu.be/dPjs5). Any idea what the movie is showing and what it is doing? Welcome to the hidden world of ciliary flames, an internal fluid pump, here shown in the deep sea creature Giant Larvacean. We found that this design and its counterpart, the ciliary carpet, are dictated by fluid physics and represent a trade-off between pressure generation and flow rate. Whether flatworm or frog, same physics apply when you try to pump internal fluid with cilia, leading to highly convergent design strategies across the animal kingdom. Find out more in our paper. This was a wonderful collaboration between my lab at Helmholtz Pioneer Campus @ Helmholtz Munich, headed by my postdoc Feng L., MBARI headed by Kakani Katija, and University of Southern California, headed by Eva Kanso, and others."
