        "text": "Earlier this year, we brought you “Physics: A Science in Quest of an Ontology”—not realizing, at the time, that the book was yet incomplete. It was divided into two Parts, but it turned out that Prof. Smith still had one more in him. Part III of this edition contains two new magisterial chapters which are, without question, the final writings of Wolfgang Smith—and you won’t find them printed anywhere else! Get your copy here https://lnkd.in/dHdwvy5N #wolfgangsmith #physics #metaphysics\n\nWhat’s better than one #Higgsboson? Two Higgs bosons Known as di-Higgs production, finding two Higgs bosons in the same place at the same time is a fascinating process that can tell scientists more about the Higgs boson self-interaction. By combining multiple di-Higgs studies, physicists at the ATLAS Collaboration get closer to finding out how the particle interacts with itself, providing clues to the stability of the #Universe. Find out more: https://lnkd.in/dZ_b23ns\n\nPondering Physics If we take a book made out of paper and burn it into ashes; the laws of physics state the book still exists with the [information] within the microscopic universe of heat, light and ashes. Can we bring the [information] back? If so, how? #physics #science #thoughexperiment #Gedankenexperiment\n\nSadly, Peter Higgs passed away at 94. For me he was inspiring and leading scientist who discovered \"Higgs Boson\". The Higgs particle is a massive scalar boson with zero spin, even (positive) parity, no electric charge, and no colour charge that couples to (interacts with) mass. It is also very unstable, decaying into other particles almost immediately upon generation. Accordingly, when the universe was born, it was filled with the Higgs field in an unstable but symmetrical state. A fraction of a second after the Big Bang, the field found a stable configuration, but one that breaks the initial symmetry. In this configuration, the broken symmetry of the Higgs field gives rise to the masses named W and Z bosons. Measuring the properties of the Higgs boson in detail is crucial to exploring many outstanding mysteries in particle physics and cosmology, from the wild variation of masses of elementary particles to the fate of the universe."
