        "text": "russ_watters said:\n\nSounds about right to me. It is only 100 years ago that Einstein \"overthrew\" Newtonian physics. Does anyone really believe there will ever again be such a major upheaval in the accepted paradigm of how the universe works?\n\nYes, I believe this. It would be very arrogant to assume that our current physical theories describe the universe. In fact, we know that it doesn't.\n\nAs far as I know, dark matter hasn't been really explained well (please correct me if I'm wrong). So a theory that explains this could be the next major upheaval.\n\nAlso, there is no reason to limit ourselves to just physics. The theory of schemes in mathematics was quite revolutionary at the time and it is only 60 years old. And it seems to meet every criterium in the article. There are many such examples.\n\nA new thing that I'm looking forward too is a rigorous definition of [itex]\\mathbb{F}_1[/itex], the field with one element. There is no reason to expect that major advances and genius are a thing of the past in mathematics.\n\nmicromass said:\n\nYes, I believe this.

So a theory that explains this could be the next major upheaval.\n\nOur observations of the world around us were widely known to not fit very will with theory 100 years ago. Today the error bars are much, much smaller. To me, that makes any \"upheaval\" an orders of magnitude smaller discovery in terms of its effect on how much it changes our level of understanding of the universe. This does not require the assumption that our understanding of the universe is or will ever be perfect, only the recognition that it is better than it used to be and the % error in our understanding gets smaller and smaller.\n\nAnd that's even assuming that we will never know everything (that there will be an endless chain of new discoveries and theories, refining our understanding of the universe to smaller and smaller precision) when some scientists actually do think physics is nearly over.\n\nruss_watters said:\n\nOur observations of the world around us were widely known to not fit very will with theory 100 years ago.

This does not require the assumption that our understanding of the universe is or will ever be perfect, only the recognition that it is better than it used to be and the % error in our understanding gets smaller and smaller.\n\nSo you measure the amount of \"genius\" by how much \"upheaval\" the theory makes? That doesn't seem to be the criteria used in the article: \"either by founding an entirely new field or by revolutionizing an already-existing discipline\". By their standards, the creation of a theory like QFT was genius, while by your criteria, it is not so much.\n\nAnd that's even assuming that we will never know everything (that there will be an endless chain of new discoveries and theories, refining our understanding of the universe to smaller and smaller precision) when some scientists actually do think physics is nearly over.\n\nI'm sure scientists said the same thing before they discovered electricity. This is a debate for another thread of course, but I think it is very strange to claim we know all about the universe while we are entirely confined to this solar system.\n\nAlso, read this quote by Lord Kelvin made at about 1900\n\nLord Kelvin said:\n\nThere is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement.\n\nor from 1874:\n\nMax Planck said:\n\n\"When I began my physical studies [in Munich in 1874] and sought advice from my venerable teacher Philipp von Jolly... he portrayed to me physics as a highly developed, almost fully matured science... Possibly in one or another nook there would perhaps be a dust particle or a small bubble to be examined and classified, but the system as a whole stood there fairly secured, and theoretical physics approached visibly that degree of perfection which, for example, geometry has had already for centuries.\"\n\nIn the Feynman lectures, there is a paragraph on that quote by Lord Kelvin. He doesn't quote it directly, but he says that it wasn't true. That at the time it was said, physics was in a state of upheaval because of anomalous experimental data. It was a time when everyone knew that a breakthrough was necessary, but didn't know what form it should take. I think the current climate is the same. The problem we face today is that no one knows how to combine gravity into the standard model of particle physics. If someone comes up with a solution we can suppose that the discoverer will be considered a genius by many, and that others will say no, they stood on the shoulders of giants. If you celebrate the breakthrough insight, you will call them genius. If you celebrate the grunt work that has to be done first, you will not.\n\nP.S. The problem then was data without theory. Today we have plenty of theory, but no data.\n\nIt seems to me the term \"genius\" (incidently a term with zero scientific evidence, relevance or definition) has more to do with popular media than actual mental superiority.\n\nBy all means applaud einstein or fineman but applaud their industrious dedication\n\nand meticulous attention to very narrow obscure subjects for long periods of time - AND their luck in spotting things that others have missed possibly solely because of others lack of such focus - not some magical \"superpower\" that only \"special\" people have.\n\nEinstein, Fineman, Newton etc. are simple products of their environment and social surroundings not products of some random genetic mutation. Yes they are special - but not because of some weird brain chemistry.\n\nSuch people will always pop up from time to time in various fields - most of them unrecognised - perhaps because their field doesn't happen to include a large percentage of math and the media likes it's geniuses to be \"Phd's\" before the term can be attributed.\n\n(A small license there but I think reasonably fair to say.)\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but - you can't win a scientific nobel prize unless you already have a BSc or similar - and that factor seems to rule out the traditional notion of \"genius\" to me anyway.\n\nA thing of the past? A thing that's never existed I suspect.\n\n1) At that time, very few people were fortunate enough to go to universities and reach high education, and thus, very few people did something incredible and that's why they were very distinctive from others. But right now, hundreds, if not thousands or PhDs in Physics, Mathematics, and Sciences are given each year, and thus one must do something VERY incredible to be distinctive and to stand out from the crowd, but that doesn't rule out the fact that we do actually have more genius people than before.\n\n2) Usually you won't know the genius ones until the end of their lives or after they die. If you ask someone at the time of Newton about Newton, Kepler, Galelio, etc, he won't have much to tell. I predict that after 100 years, people will look at contemporary scientists like Stephen Hawking, Peter Higgs, Michio Kaku, Leonard Susskind, and others the same way we look at Maxwell, Einstein, Hubble, and others\n\nRegards!\n\nSamii H said:\n\n1) At that time, very few people were fortunate enough to go to universities and reach high education, and thus, very few people did something incredible and that's why they were very distinctive from others.\n\nRegards!\n\nIMO, the best way NOT to achieve something in science that is genius status is to think your going to do it by pursuing a \"traditional\" path to get you there, i.e., undergrad, grad, postdoc, etc. Ok, now I did what I'm supposed to do, and now it's my time to do my thing, and uhh, well, ummm...Hmmm? Ok, here I go...Uhhhh.\n\nYep, sorry Mr. \"just got my PhD in physics\", you have no original thoughts because your mind has been saturated and conditioned with what the psychologists (the real usung heros in this thread) call cognitive classical and operant conditioning. You are rewarded in undergrad by grades to wire your thought process with the status quo, and you are rewarded in grad school to kiss up to your senior professor and do his grunt work. You are punished if you do anything else. The end result...Your brain has been so conditioned to what everyone else can find in a standard textbook your opportunity to make any significant contribution much less a revolutionary advance is severely truncated, if not biologically impossible.\n\nThomas Kuhn made note of this in the 70's with his book as most of you know. It is typically the outsiders of the field that create the revolutions for the reasons I just stated. All of the scientific greats were iconoclasts, very few got there by following the traditional path.\n\nDiracPool said:\n\nIt is typically the outsiders of the field that create the revolutions for the reasons I just stated.

Because I'm a cognitive neuroscientist who's emphasis is on consciousness studies. I'm the perfect guy according to Kuhn. I'm a scientist but not specifically a physicist. Therefore, I have the basic gear necessary to do the job but at the same time I'm not weighed down with the baggage of the dogma of the discipline. However, my window is short, as I venture in, well worn paths of preferred neuroelectric travel will become consolidated and it will become very hard to unlearn these. To add to this is the scientific social pressure not to publish outside your field. I was thinking of creating an alias to publish in physics related journals as I'm already well known in the cog sci scene. But then I said, screw it, I'll just use my real name...I mean Roger Penrose thought nothing of walking right into my field and writing a book about consciousness, why should I care...Right?\n\nDiracPool said:\n\nIMO, the best way NOT to achieve something in science that is genius status is to think your going to do it by pursuing a \"traditional\" path to get you there, i.e., undergrad, grad, postdoc, etc. Ok, now I did what I'm supposed to do, and now it's my time to do my thing, and uhh, well, ummm...Hmmm?

Perhaps I am wrong, but it seems to me that the entire point of learning a field is to work within that field. You claim that this \"traditional path\" leads to conditioning of your mind and whatever other nonsense when it is in fact this very path that leads to practically all breakthroughs in all fields in science. There's a reason we don't have cosmologists making major breakthroughs in cancer research. They don't know anything about that area.\n\nAs for few scientific greats getting there by following the traditional path, I think history itself proves you wrong. I'd be willing to be that practically all of the scientific greats went to school and got a degree. I don't see how else they could have learned the basic skills necessary for their breakthroughs in the first place, nor how they had the know how and the access to scientific journals in which to publish in.\n\nmicromass said:\n\nSo you measure the amount of \"genius\" by how much \"upheaval\" the theory makes? That doesn't seem to be the criteria used in the article: \"either by founding an entirely new field or by revolutionizing an already-existing discipline\". By their standards, the creation of a theory like QFT was genius, while by your criteria, it is not so much.\n\nAll scientific theories or models, if you will, are actually invented constructions designed to try to imitate or facsimilize some aspect of nature, whether it is the concept of natural selection or of the orbital structure of a hydrogen atom. I think the central question here is what these models mean and/or what the utility of these models are. Homo ergaster was able to live comfortably on the planet for far longer than we have already and had no concept of how Legendre polynomials related to the orbital structure of electrons in the atom. Pre-Einstein societies lived just fine on Newtons mechanics as did the middle-ages people on pre-Galiliean physical understanding.\n\nWhat do we gain in the modern age? A refinement, a refinement on our ability to model physical processes and therefore to manipulate our external surroundings in a more sophisticated manner. But what about understanding? Do we really understand more? Do we really understand more than that guy in Newton's time who said, give me the position and momentum of every particle in the universe and I will tell you what happens for the rest of eternity? Who was that guy, Voltaire?\n\nIn any case, the whole \"the more you know the less you know\" debate is well known. My argument is that progress in this day and age overemphasizes description rather than conception. The real breakthroughs in history were conceptual, common sense game changers like the apple falling from the tree is what make the moon go cross the sky, and that light, not time, is the universal constant. These are fundamental redirects in concept, and that I think is what characterizes what great advances achieve.\n\nIn the end, though, what will really satisfy the scientist and the layman alike will be a description that is, unlike what Michio Kaku likes to assert, NOT simply an equation one inch long that you can print on a t-shirt. It will end up being a STORY, a story of why things are the way the are (yes, WHY), and how they got to be that way. Descriptions and equations are great, but what the human soul really seeks, really craves, is a story.\n\nDrakkith said:\n\nThere's a reason we don't have cosmologists making major breakthroughs in cancer research. They don't know anything about that area.\n\nWell, yeah..Ok. My point was more of the idea of revolutionizing a field, which I think the topic of the thread is. Of course if you're baking a cake and I'm mixing the drinks I'm not going to make a better cake than you, but I may recognize when I come visit your station that somehow you got so used to using margarine because of the war rationing that we are now actually allowed to use butter since the war is over, etc.\n\nIn any case, I didn't come up with the outsider changes the game idea, that was Kuhn. He made this argument in Structures of scientific revolutions. My main point is not that it has to be someone outside a certain discipline per se that has to make the big breakthrough, it is more as I said in my earlier post that one has a certain WINDOW where they can make that breakthrough, a window whereby their conceptual understanding of a situation is chaotic enough that the attractor in the brain doesn't fall in easily to some pre-learned limit cycle solution. Does that make sense?\n\nSo, it doesn't have to be someone from another field, just someone who hasn't spent their careers learning only the status quo. Maybe Planck and a few others are exceptions, but Guys like Einstein, Dirac, and Heisenberg were young enough to keep those attractos chaotic, and guys like Newton and Galilleo had the benefit of not having a stringent scientific load to memorize before they came up with their great works."
