        "text": "Zierler:\n\nOkay. This is David Zierler, oral historian for the American Institute of Physics. It is July 27th, 2020. It’s my great pleasure to be here with Professor Peter McIntyre. Peter, thank you so much for joining me today.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nMy pleasure.\n\nZierler:\n\nOkay, so to start, would you tell me your title and institutional affiliation?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nOkay, my full name is Peter Mastin McIntyre III. I am the Mitchell-Heep professor of Experimental Physics at Texas A&M University. I also serve as President of Accelerator Technology Corp, which is a small for-profit company based here in College Station, Texas, to which I spin out a variety of technologies that I invent.\n\nZierler:\n\nNow, I’m sorry that it’s only an audio transcript so that researchers cannot get a sense of this amazing backdrop that I’m looking at here. But just for some context, I just want to point out that Peter gave me a tremendous tour of his lab. Is there a name for the lab?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nThe Accelerator Research Lab.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd do you have a formal affiliation? Are you director? Is it just your lab?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nMy lab.\n\nZierler:\n\nOkay (laughter). Wonderful. Okay. So, let’s now, Peter, let’s take it back to the beginning. Let’s start with your parents. Tell me a little bit about your parents, and where they’re from.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nOkay. I grew up in a small town called Clewiston, Florida. It is on the southern shore of Lake Okeechobee in the southern part of Florida. So, you can see that easily on a map of the state. It’s the second largest freshwater lake entirely within the United States. The only one larger is Lake Michigan. All the other great lakes are shared with Canada. It is a town that is known for growing sugarcane, and is—well, it proudly proclaims to be the bass fishing capital of America. There are something like 100 different towns around the United States that also vie for that title, and I wouldn’t dream of arguing the pros (laughter)- or cons. My father —by the same name as mine, except he was Junior—was the agricultural manager, the field manager of a sugarcane growers’ co-op, which is an interesting proposition. It was a collaboration of 50 or so farmers. Each of them had quite a bit of acreage, you know, anything from a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of acres that they had planted in sugarcane. And they had gotten together at a certain point to pool their money as an investment, and build their own refinery to make sugar, and go into competition with the several large corporate entities that were doing that already for many years in South Florida. And so his life was interesting.\n\nThe arguments had to come to his desk. And with him out into the field with the farmers because sugarcane, as it matures, the content of sugar in the juice of the cane grows through the season from a point where it’s just very slightly sweet to the tongue if you were to take a piece of it, peel it, and chew it, to where it’s extremely sweet. For well-bred sugarcane, it gets up to about 10% sugar content in the juice. So that process goes up a curve that you can sort of imagine, either as a physicist or a biologist, and reaches a certain peak on a certain day, usually just before the first freeze of the winter season, and then falls off fairly rapidly after that.\n\nWell, as you can imagine, each of those 50 farmers was determined he wanted his cane harvested when its sugar content was at the peak. So, every one of the 50 was having him out in the field, taking a piece of their cane in, and having it tested for its sugar content, virtually every day. And then predictably, maybe 30 of the fields matured at the same time, and so then he had those farmers demanding to be the first, etc. So, he had an interesting life, you know, dealing with fairly cantankerous individuals.\n\nMy mother, Ruby, was a wonderful woman. Before I was born, she worked for the Army Corps of Engineers monitoring Lake Okeechobee in connection with their massive waterworks that they ran to do flood control. Long after I left Florida, their work achieved a certain notoriety because the Corps of Engineers is like a group of boys that never grew up. They have their giant pails and shovels and toys of various sorts, and they love nothing better than to dig reservoirs, and dredge canals, and build dams, and control where water goes. They did that in South Florida with an attitude, starting at the time of President Hoover, and they controlled the water in South Florida so well that they drained much of the Everglades, came close to ruining it. That’s been a subject of a lot of study and a lot of anguish over the past couple of decades. So that now today, they’re largely engaged in undoing the damage that they did long ago [laugh], reflooding selectively various parts of the south half of Florida to try to keep from utterly ruining it. At any rate, so that was Ruby’s job. It took a sort of an interesting amateur dimension because she hatched an itch to fly in the days leading up to World War II, took flying lessons from a gentleman who taught her on a very small little two-seater, single-wing plane, and she learned well. In the first instance, she was all set to be one the women pilots who ferried planes from where they were built all across America to the coasts to be put on ships and sent to war during World War II. She was a little late in getting into the enterprise, so that by the time she was credentialed to do actual plane ferrying, they were ramping down production, the war was coming to its end, and so she never actually got to deliver planes. But she was certainly capable of doing so by the end of the war, and she flew aerial reconnaissance of the lake for the Corps of Engineers as part of her job. So, she was a very interesting woman. In her later years, she had another itch, which was to open a ladies’ fashion dress shop in my hometown. And for 40 years Ruby’s was the place to go for all the women in surrounding towns if they wanted something nice to wear to a party or a ball or just out in the evening. She was quite an elegant woman, and we loved each other dearly.\n\nZierler:\n\nIs there a book about her that I could read? I would love to (laughter).\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nI’m thinking of writing a kind of a low-key book of my own, which would include a chapter and possibly a couple about my mom.\n\nZierler:\n\nAbsolutely. Peter, were you—did you go to public schools growing up?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nYes, I did. Clewiston had only one elementary school and one high school. In the day I was there, it was a town of about 5,000 people. Today’s it’s a town of about 5,000 people (laughter). For a while, it shrank, and it’s regrown a little bit to about what it was when I left.\n\nI left Clewiston after my 10th grade of high school because I hatched the desire to go to college early, and I had read much about different colleges kind of scratching that itch and decided the place I wanted to go was to the University of Chicago. I did that because I decided I wanted to be a physicist, and I have always been a person with heroes. And my all-time hero then and frankly now was Enrico Fermi, and I read everything about him that I could mop up. At that time, we had a small library in the town that was a gift from the local sugar company, the big corporate one with which my father’s company competed. I would ride my bicycle downtown and spend my afternoons in the library.\n\nThey had a pretty good collection, but the books they had were mostly dated before about 1952 because in giving them the library, the company also gave them an endowment to buy books. They spent it all then, and thereafter they had little money to buy any more books. So, it was a kind of a static collection. I had read everything they had that was on any subject related to chemistry or physics and mopped up what I could learn about Enrico Fermi. And to me, he was alive and well, and doing these wonderful things at the University of Chicago.\n\nSo, I applied there for college, and they admitted me after my 10th grade. I went there as a freshman. The first thing I did when I arrived was to go to the physics department, as I’m registering for courses, and asked, “Please, could you tell me where is Professor Fermi’s office?” They looked at me like I was a bit crazy, and said, “But, son, he died five years ago.” It was one of the biggest disappointments of my life, certainly the biggest at that time. There’ve been a few others since. That was one of the biggest.\n\nZierler:\n\nThis is a very pre-internet story.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nYup.\n\nZierler:\n\n(Laughter) Peter, what was your first entrée into physics? How did you know that this was such a fascinating topic to you, being in relative isolation in Florida?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nWell, that has a few different dimensions to it. First of all, physics had a very interesting place already in Florida during my youth. It was where the space program was being born at Cape Canaveral, as it was then called. I followed that with keen interest, and it got me interested in rocketeering.\n\nAt that time, if you had a bit of money, you could buy kits of little rockets that would go up, you know, 100 feet. If you had a lot of money, you could go up 100 meters or so with your rockets. I didn’t have very much money, and so I had to be more resourceful. I was very keen on chemistry. I learned what I could of chemistry from the library when I was about 10, and I began experimenting a lot with rocket fuels.\n\nI made some fairly good rocket fuels—nothing particularly original but, you know, the usual sorts of things with potassium permanganate, sulfur, carbon, and one thing and another. There were about three different recipes you could use. As I would make the fuels, I would test-fire them on my rockets. So, I read all the things I could find in the newspaper, etc., and NASA had rocket test stands in Alabama where they fired off solid fuel rocket engines and such. So, I made my own test stand for firing my rocket engines and measuring their thrust. And I made some pretty good engines considering the crude ways I was using.\n\nI also was intrigued with the manned space flight ambitions of that day, and so I really wanted to have astronauts for my rockets. In South Florida there is a creature called an anole. It’s a lizard. It’s a beautiful creature. It can change colors, like a chameleon, from a brilliant green—this is one of the most gorgeous greens you can imagine—to a rusty brown, the color of a tree trunk, or anything in between, as its camouflage. Well, anoles are beautiful.\n\nThey’re also bounteous in South Florida. They’re everywhere. And they’re not particularly quick-witted or quick-reflexed. So, they will sit around on the leaves of a bush in your yard, and you can come up just kind of slowly to them, and with a fast grab, you can grab one with your hands. So I would grab anoles, and keep a little terrarium with a screen on it for them to live in. I followed closely the ways that astronauts were trained, and I decided that anoles would become my astronauts. I would train them in a centrifuge.\n\nI had an old fan that was mounted in my bedroom because we didn’t have air conditioning as I was growing up, and that gave me a bit of a breeze at night. I would do various kinds of tinkering with it. Fortunately, it had rubber blades. It was for a child’s room. And it was very fortunate for me that I still have all of my fingers, because I would stick various things into the blades, and see how much force it took to slow them down. In all of this, you can kind of get the feeling I was tinkering as somebody with a bit of physics did.\n\nFinally, I broke the blades off, one after another. Once they were gone, it came to me that I could use my Erector Set and fabricate a little bracket and a set of makeshift test-tube holders that would enable me to mount four Pyrex test tubes from my chemistry endeavors at the locations where the blades would be on the fan. Each test tube was just the right size to hold one anole. So, I would stage my astronaut anoles into their test tube and plug in the fan. There was no gentle start to my training sessions. And my anoles would go around and around quite fast. Some would make it through the training, and some would not. This was not a very politically correct experiment. But one does what one must, or one feels compelled to do. Some of my anoles would survive, and some of them wouldn’t. For the ones that survived, I would give them repeated trainings until they were pretty robust at it, and then they were ready for launch.\n\nI devised a system for making an escape for the anole from his capsule on the top of my rocket. I added a little upper chamber above the rocket engine and loaded it with a bit of gunpowder. Just at the top of the rocket’s flight (the apogee), at the instant that the engine burned its last fuel it would ignite the powder charge, and the explosion would pop the upper chamber loose. I build tiny parachutes, and I would strap the parachute to the anole’s legs, so that when the capsule popped free from the rocket the anole would parachute back to Earth.\n\nAfter a few casualties, I became pretty good at having these astronaut anoles pop out, float down beautifully on their little parachutes, and land. I would have a little ceremony, and I would give a moving speech, and I would release them back into nature. So, in South Florida, there are I’m sure today the descendants of a selectively bred sub-species of astronaut anoles. So, that was one of my early entrées into this hands-on science. Another was in the domains of electricity and magnetism, you have to ignite a rocket, and I watched how they do that avidly on early—on the early television that we had. And I could see that they were pressing a button, and that somehow ignited the rocket. I read up on the ignition systems, etc., and I realized that you needed to have a high-resistance element that was integrated right in with the fuel in the bottom of the solid fuel rocket. As you pass electric current through the resistor it heats up, and it had to become hot enough to ignite the fuel in the air and fire the engine.\n\nYou needed to do this from a safe distance, of course. So, I devised a way. I obtained a roll of lamp cord, just two-wired lamp cord of the conventional sort, which is covered with a rubber insulation stuff. And this by the way is very entertaining to my group because as we are talking they’re all gathered around here doing their work, and listening…they haven’t heard these stories before.\n\nAs I read up on the electric properties of different materials, I realized that steel has a much higher resistivity than the copper that’s in the wires, and I thought about how a very thin filament of steel wire would become very hot just like an incandescent bulb gets hot. Then I realized that I had what I needed ready to hand: my mother used steel wool to scrub her pots.\n\nI absconded with one of her steel wool pads, pulled out a little ball of it, stuck the two wires of the lamp cord into the ball. I stuffed that into the bottom of my rocket engine, ran the lamp cord off 100 feet in the distance, and then there was a place in our garage where I could plug it in. Well, this drew enough current that it would blow a 5-amp or even 10-amp fuse. In those days, the fuses were of the kind that were so-called screw-in cartridge fuses. With a little experimentation I discovered something that electricians of that era knew well, which is that if you had a circuit that was blowing, and you wanted to be able to deliver whatever current you needed to deliver, there is a marvelous thing that is minted in this country in very large numbers, although they’re right now in shortage. It’s a penny!\n\nA penny is made at least partly out of copper. It’s pretty conductive. And a penny has just the right diameter that it fits nicely into one of those screw-in sockets for the fuse holder. So, you put the penny in the fuse holder, and screw it in nice and tight. Now you have a circuit that has essentially a very large amp capacity to deliver to a load. So, I would do this modification of the electric wiring to the circuit powering the duplex outlet that I was going to plug into.\n\nWhen I then plugged it in, it would deliver whatever current took to do the job. This proved to be a very effective ignition device for launching rockets, and it worked reliably for me many times until one time, which taught me another lesson about the chemistry of the rubber insulation on the wiring of lamp cord wiring. I inadvertently crossed the two copper wires where I stuffed them into the little ball of steel wool, which meant that there was a dead short basically through copper wires all the way from the one prong of the cord to the other. That meant that the amount of current that was carried was even larger than what was required to turn the ball of steel wool into a brilliant orange ignition. What it did was to ignite the rubber insulation, starting at the far end where the rocket was, and burned it all the way back to my hand.\n\nSo I plugged it in, and I saw this puff of smoke, not the ignition firing off to fire the rocket, but a puff of smoke that was mysteriously snaking along the ground toward me along the length of the lamp cord, and going sizzling and popping with flame as it was coming. I was so intrigued, so utterly rooted to the spot, that I omitted to remove my hand in time, and I had a nice pair of burns on my palm where I was holding the lamp cord as it when into the duplex outlet where the flame got right back and scorched my flesh. So sometimes you learn lessons from doing experiments.\n\nZierler:\n\nPeter, it sounds like you had a pretty well-developed sense of what you wanted to accomplish when you got to Chicago. Did that change, or were you sort of a young man on a mission, and you more or less stuck with what you wanted to do?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nI pretty much stuck with what I wanted to do. As I went through college, I never really wavered from my ambition to become an experimental physicist. I knew I was pretty sure I wanted to be an experimentalist, although that wavered a little. I stayed for graduate school at Chicago, and I toyed with going to work with Chandrasekhar on an interesting problem in gravitational radiation, which in those days was an utterly outré idea that most folks thought would never have any possibility of observation.\n\nJoseph Weber was doing his efforts at Maryland, but most people in the world of physics viewed that as an utterly hopeless dream. The intervening decades have shown that (laughter) such ways of looking at things almost always are shortsighted. At any rate, Chandra wanted me to do the sixth-order post-Newtonian approximation as a dissertation topic if I wanted to go into astrophysics. He suggested that I talk with the gentleman who was just finishing his dissertation on the fourth order post-Newtonian. Well, I already knew enough about radiation field expansions to know that with each succeeding order that you carry such expansions, the level of difficulty and the volume of work to take it to the next order increases in an essentially exponential progression.\n\nSo, I went to see the chap who had done the fourth order. I remember it vividly—he was a gaunt Indian gentleman. I have no idea what became of him. But he heard what I came to say, and he went over without a word and pulled a volume three inches think of ring binder off of his shelf, and he handed it to me. I went through it page after page -- beautifully, elegantly crafted equation after equation after equation, continuously from cover to cover. I realized that this is the progressive development of one body of calculation, and said, “Is this the fourth order?” And he nods his head and said “You are very brave.” Well, I was not that brave. So, I decided that experiment was for me after all, and I went to work with Val Telegdi, and never regretted that.\n\nZierler:\n\nWas there a senior thesis at Chicago?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nIs there a senior thesis?\n\nZierler:\n\nYes.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nNo, there was not at that time. I enjoyed many things about my college years at Chicago. In my fourth year, I pretty much took graduate courses through that year. But one of the things I enjoyed most was the experimental lab course done for the undergraduates and then for the graduate students.\n\nAnd Chicago in that day took a really pretty serious approach to that in which they basically staged you some fairly challenging experiments that were doable. They were not out of scope for what a student could do in a few weeks or a month of a semester—or an order, as it was in Chicago. But they really ate you alive to make a success of it. One of them that I remember vividly really taught me a visceral connection with what the concept of a Fermi surface is all about that I would dare say not too many condensed matter physicists of today have.\n\nA professor there in condensed matter experiments set up one of the experimental stations in the Franck Institute with a setup that made it possible for a 2-student team to measure magnetoresistance of metal samples at liquid helium temperature. They had about a dozen of these stations for all the different research groups doing their various projects. They made one of them available for senior undergraduates to use, and he staged on that everything it took to do a precision measurement of magnetoresistance in magnesium: a 3D goniometer, a background field magnet, a cryostat with a stem on it where you could mount your specimen in the magnetic field.\n\nAnd so, you’re essentially doing a 3D geometry equivalent of the Hall effect, but you’re measuring the magnetoresistance in the presence of magnetic field of that specimen at low temperature. It is an utterly classic experiment. I don’t know of a university in America that enables undergrads to do that today. It is one of the most compelling experiments that you can have a young physicist do, it brings this abstruse theoretical notion that we teach people in a classroom what a Fermi surface is, and they don’t get it because they don’t realize how very tangible this reciprocal space, or k-space, is if you do things in a way that brings it alive.\n\nThat 3D goniometer measurement of magnetoresistance enabled us to map out this bizarre science-fiction monster that is the Fermi surface of magnesium so that we got to know it personally, and it’s never left me from that day to this. It didn’t turn me into a condensed matter physicist, but I know how to think like one in a very nimble way thanks to that. Likewise, there was an experiment in particle physics in which students were assigned to scan and measure high-resolution stereo films of K- mesons interacting in the liquid filling a bubble chamber. I came along in the last days of the time of bubble chamber physics. Bubble chambers had been a major instrument for high energy physics up until the late 60s, but they could not resolve large event rates and so were limited as the trend shifted to study ever more rare processes.\n\nIn a bubble chamber experiment, you injected particles produced in collisions (in our case strange particles called K-) into a pressurized chamber full of a cryogenic liquid, and you quickly release the pressure on the liquid just at the instant when the particles enter the chamber. You illuminate the chamber at that instant with flash lamps and record the trails of bubbles formed along the particle trajectories in stereo views onto 35 mm film. Then you scan the film reels for interesting events and measure the tracks to deduce the physics of each event. Two of the leading lights in that game were still on the faculty at Chicago. One of them, Riccardo Levi-Setti, and his colleague Gianni Conforto had created an experiment in which they taught us how to think about what happens when a K- meson slows and stops in a liquid. It is one of the most classic tools to bring alive for a student the strange particles, because when a K- stops in hydrogen it can do a whole variety of things. As it’s slowing down, it is doing elastic scattering. It can also do charge exchange with a proton to produce a K0 meson.\n\nYou can observe events of both of those, and learn how to recognize them by the rules of the topology and the charge—adding up the charges and all the rest, the subtle things of scanning, and have a lot of physics in them. He set us up with the geometry of the fiducial markings of the chamber so we could actually measure lifetimes. In stopping K-, you can see the production of Λ and Σ hyperons, and measure their masses and their decay modes and their branching ratios. There’s just a wealth of physics that you can do with this one medium, and the three reels of strereo film, that you put on at schools, and you go to scanning tables, and you run through and systematically measure.\n\nSo, we—I learned a huge amount in that way. I really mopped up the strange particles thanks to that experiment. No students today have that opportunity. In fact, I have what may be the last two sets of three reels of stopping K- film because I did re-create the whole experiment here at Texas A&M for about 10 years. And then I rotated off to another course, and none of my colleagues wanted to bother to continue to teach how to do that experiment.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd the basis—Peter—the basis for this concern is that there’s lots of new physics that can still be learned if this was more widely adopted today?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nAbsolutely, there’s no question. There—you know, there is no way, in my opinion—I am a card-carrying high-energy physicist. I’m co-discoverer of the top quark. I invented both the accelerator methods and participated in the experiment at Fermilab that measured the weak bosons. We would’ve discovered the weak bosons, except that Fermilab and the US high-energy community did not have the vision to convert the main ring at Fermilab into a hadron collider as it should have.\n\nAt any rate, bottom line is in the world today, for example, of Higgs bosons and the ensemble of Higgs that we—that are out there in the data of the two classic experiments at CERN, there is, in my opinion, very little way that you can teach that to an undergraduate, and I don’t think you can teach it to a graduate student in a meaningful way. It requires so many layers of mastering the understanding of the immensely preponderant backgrounds, Standard Model backgrounds, and how to systematically measure them and understand how they manage to feed through your various cuts that you make on data, and how to design triggers that preserve the rare events you seek but filter them from the copious backgrounds. There’s so many layers to it that it’s almost impossible to build the underpinning appreciation of the actual particles at that front-end level.\n\nThe bubble chamber thing is a complete toolkit. Indeed, you could actually put this thing on the internet with the tools of today, and turn into a videography these reels of tape and methods of using a suitably designed CAD application to do the measurement and reconstruction of the pattern of vertices, etc., and actually do the analysis or make it available to students. So, the students of today and tomorrow can have those aha moments like I did in Clewiston, Florida as a kid, where they could really come alive with these elementary particles. I know this particle. This is a Lambda particle. That is a sigma. This is how I can tell them apart.\n\nAnd to a slightly higher degree already at the college level, you can equip a not exorbitantly costly cryogenic setup to do, you know, that Fermi surface measurement, although fewer and fewer universities today have any liquid helium-based experimental facilities in their lab complex. So that becomes a disabling challenge. Although now you can (with a bit of ingenuity) get down to 10 Kelvin at least with cryocoolers.\n\nZierler:\n\nPeter, did you think about attending any other schools for graduate school, or we’re you on just such a momentum, you just stayed put and went with it?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nWell, I did. I applied to Princeton and I applied to Maryland for graduate school. Princeton did not accept me. Maryland did. My motivation for applying to Maryland was actually focused on Joe Weber at that time.\n\nZierler:\n\nWho was it at Princeton that you would’ve wanted to work with?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nWell, I was interested in the things that Dicke had done. Whether I would’ve gone to work for him or not, that would’ve been, again, this experiment-theory divide. And I doubt that I had really thought that far ahead. At any rate, Chicago accepted me, and the landscape there on the faculty side (I already felt that I knew many of them) was sufficiently rich that I felt I couldn’t go wrong.\n\nI was already attending a set of lectures that Chandra Shekhar was doing that year of my senior year of college. Chandra had the itch to see how differential geometry might play a powerful role in enabling some further exploration of general relativity writ large and gravitational radiation within it. In the end, he was partially right. And indeed many years later when talking with my colleague, Marlan Scully, here at Texas A&M (he was a student of Wigner) I found that he had devoted quite a bit of energy in his own way to differential geometry and the interface with general relativity pertinent to gravitational radiation and related problems.\n\nThat was a very stimulating year because Chandra did something that doesn’t happen often. He brought three eminent scholars of that game to Chicago at the same time to team up on this challenge. One of the visitors was Kip Thorne from Cal Tech, who just absolutely bowled me over, just a powerful, fantastic guy. And another was Robert Geroch from North Carolina—also very powerful, although a bit more erudite in his style. Chandra got a grant out of NSF that enabled him to pay their full salaries for a whole year. They ran a weekly seminar and a topical course. A whole coterie of astrophysics students tried their best to get their head around these problems at the interface of differential geometry and general relativity. Like I say, it was largely fruitless at that time, but it was immensely stimulating to me.\n\nIronically, one of my postdocs, Bill Kells, went into that game right after working with me as a postdoc at Fermilab. He came to work with me when I was building the electron cooling ring for proton and antiproton colliding beams, but he left that postdoc to take a position with the LIGO group at Caltech who were then just beginning to build the immense gravitational wave observatory. Bill devoted his entire career to LIGO, and retired from Caltech and from LIGO about six months before the first discovery was announced of the black hole mergers. [laugh] So it’s literally a case of going into the early phase of a huge, visionary, experimental enterprise, spending your entire working life from your second postdoc all the way through to your retirement building that thing, failing with it on its first round, rebuilding it, failing on its second round, upgrading its sensitivity by two orders of magnitude, and then sharing the spectacular discovery just as you retire! (laughter)\n\nBill’s name is on the discovery papers, but he retired just as they finally announced the first of the now many, many black hole mergers that they discovered. It’s such an exciting arena in our field.\n\nZierler:\n\nPeter, on the social side of things, your graduate years coincided with a quite tumultuous time, nationally and in Chicago specifically. What was your relation to all of the movements that were going on on campus at the time? Was your sense to sort of try to stay away from that and keep your head in the lab, or were you involved in some of those movements?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nI was on the picket lines in Chicago. I was vehemently antiwar. The Vietnam War was one of our utterly wrong wars that we as a nation have had the lack of wisdom to fight. I was determined that I personally, Peter McIntyre, was not going to go to Vietnam under any conditions. I had determined that if necessary, I would leave the country. I would not go to jail if I could help it, but I was not going to go to Vietnam and either kill people or be killed for no just cause. I graduated from college in ’67, and I was a graduate student beginning then in ’68. That was the last year for graduate school deferments from the Selective Service. That enabled me to get through my first year of graduate school, and I got my master’s at the end of that year, and I also passed the qualifier exam, so I was then a PhD candidate. But as that year ended, also ended the graduate student deferments.\n\nThat brought this issue to a hub for me personally. I studied the legal paths by which I could qualify for any form of deferment. I was a conscientious objector, but not in a fashion that was defensible under the rules of Selective Service, so that was not an avenue.\n\nZierler:\n\nMeaning there was not a religious basis to your conscientious objection?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nI was not going to lie and say that God told me not to go to war. Ethics was not an allowable basis for conscientious objector. It’s one of the sad comments about our country. So, as I sought any avenue that there might be, I found that there was a curious loophole in the medical criteria that are applied when you are drafted and sent for your induction physical. They have a little chart of weight vs. height. For each height, there’s a maximum and minimum weight that they will take as draftable. If you are less massive than the minimum or more massive than the maximum for your height, they will not take you into the Army. I was a pretty lean and gaunt kind of guy in my youth. I’m still pretty lean and trim.\n\nAnd so, I looked at the chart and saw with interest that the threshold for minimum weight for my height of six-three was 138 pounds (if memory serves correctly). Well, I at that time weighed about 155. I then researched how the process works from when you receive an induction physical from your local draft board to when you show up for a physical in your location where you are. My draft board was in Clewiston, Florida. I was at the University of Chicago, and they didn’t require you to go home for an induction physical. That would not be a reasonable thing to do. So, they send you a notice to appear to the induction that serves Clewiston, Florida. You then have to respond within a certain maximum window of time to request a change of venue to the induction center nearest where you are.\n\nSo, I worked out a plan, and realized that if I took the maximum allowable time to request the change of venue, that would engender a process that took several weeks to actually make happen. I planned to fast beginning the day I received the notice for physical and strive to reduce my weight sufficiently that I would be below the acceptable threshold when the time came for me to report for my physical. The first episode of this came, and I managed to fast my way down to 130 pounds, reasoning that their scales might be a little off, so I needed to leave a significant margin. They put me on the scales, and they gave me my I-Y status.\n\nBut a I-Y is not what you hope for. An IV-F is what you hope for. But I nevertheless felt pretty good about that. Alas, six months later, I got another notice for another physical. I repeated the same sequence of events, and it had the same outcome. So, I thought, well, surely—but, again, they gave me a I-Y.\n\nI began to think how long is this going to go on? Well, they were thinking the same way. So, the third time, they sent me a notice to report to the station in Chicago where they sent me on the previous times on the second bounce. So, this time I had only two weeks before I had to report.\n\nI went on to an all-out fast. I worked out what you have to eat if you’re going to manage to survive physically and not die, but also you’re going to plunge your weight in the fastest attainable way. The answer for any who need to do it is sea scallops and celery. If you eat only sea scallops and celery, you will get the protein you need, you will get near-zero carbohydrates, and your weight loss will only be limited by your water content.\n\nIt was working, but not fast enough. For the last week before the physical I had to diminish my water intake because that’s the only way you can reduce your weight very fast. On the day of the physical my wife Becky drove me to downtown Chicago, and I staggered from the car into the induction center. I staggered through the physical. When I came to the end, my weight was 133.\n\nThe final station was a doctor does the summative evaluation. He has all the data - they took a blood test and urine test and X-rays. He looked at the data and then at me.\n\nHe said, “Son, you’re going to get your IV-F after this. But let me tell you, don’t ever do this to your body again. You are about 12 hours from death, from going into a coma and dieing.”\n\nZierler:\n\nWhoa.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\n“So you really don’t ever do this again.” And I said, “Yes, sir.” (laughter)\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd I take it you were not working with any kind of medical oversight when you were doing this to yourself?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nOh, no. Doctors faced jail if they were willing to counsel people in doing what I did.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah. Peter, looking back, what do you think accounts for—I mean, a lot of people say they were antiwar and they didn’t want to go to Vietnam obviously. But your commitment to this was clearly unique. What do you think accounts for it?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nIt wasn’t unique. There were many people who did the same character of thing. Some of them did it by leaving the country; others by managing to get a CO; others with weak knees; others by breathing iodine vapor, which is also not good for you (laughter) but makes you fail a lung X-ray, which is another part of the physical.\n\nI was not alone in that. What I shared with them was an iron determination I was not going to go out to Vietnam. I was not going to kill other people or have them kill me for a wrong war.\n\nZierler:\n\nRight.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nThere was no moral justification for that war—then, now, ever.\n\nZierler:\n\nSo, the emphasis here is that you’re not necessarily a pacifist. If you rewind 20 years, you may have been willing to fight for World War II. Your specific objection was with the Vietnam War?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nYes, that’s correct. World War II—all wars are a very mixed bag in the best of ways of characterizing them. But some of them have justifications, and others have none. The Vietnam War had no justification at all. We went into it on the basis of lies, the Gulf of Tonkin. We were dragged along through it by a continuous sequence of lies.\n\nWe did atrocities that are beyond imagining to the human beings on the ground. And there’s just nothing good you can say about it. It killed 50,000 of our own people. It killed a million or so of the Vietnamese, all to no good purpose.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid you talk about your decisions with your parents? Was there a generational divide, or were you of the same mind on this topic?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nThere was a total divide. My father was a member of the John Birch Society. I think in his heart, he knew what I was doing. I did not make a secret of my views about the war—we would have candid, frank discussions about that, but they had to end up with us agreeing to disagree. I did not rub in his face what I in the end had to do to stay out of Vietnam.\n\nZierler:\n\nHow did you recover, and how did you get back to a sense of normalcy for your graduate work?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nYou mean after fasting?\n\nZierler:\n\nYes.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nI ate (laughter). I had many very good meals (laughter). And I never did that to my body again, as the doctor suggested.\n\nZierler:\n\nHow did you go about developing your dissertation topic?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nWell, after just making my decision I described with Chandra Shekhar, that switched me into a kind of a resolve that I wanted to become an experimentalist. I had—I really had a love for particle physics, and two faculty who were most active in particle physics at Chicago at that time were Val Telegdi and Herb Anderson. So, I went to talk to both of them. Anderson was doing mega-scale counter-based experiments at Argonne National Laboratory, and preparing an experiment for the brand new Fermilab that was just being built. I talked with his group, and understood what they were doing as an experiment. I did not find it inspiring in its physics motivations. It seemed to be mainly an exercise in fancy electronics to handle what then were large quantities of data.\n\nTelegdi at that time had already done one experiment in muonium, and was gearing up to do another. And so that experiment had the prospects of being the basis for my dissertation research if I wanted to do it. The more I learned about it, the more fascinating it became for me. Muonium is this marvelous atom of a positive muon and a negative electron that forms very naturally if you simply stop μ+?in an inert gas.\n\nAs it stops in the gas, the muon will latch onto an electron, and bind it into a very small radius atom. That atom is 200 times smaller than the gas atoms (the ratio of mass of the muon to the proton). So, the muonium atom is an extremely inert, isolated, little atomic system that has the remarkable property that it has no strongly interacting pieces in it. It’s just two leptons that are bound together in a bound state. Correspondingly, if you study its hyperfine structure (the atomic levels of the atom), if you measure the hyperfine interval between the two spin orientations of of its ground state, you’re making a measurement that is utterly fundamental in QED, quantum electrodynamics.\n\nThis was in 1971, and in that era measuring QED with ever greater precision was a very hot and lively topic because that’s where you could see the virtual diagrams of gauge fields beyond electromagnetism to the weak sector. The electroweak bosons W and Z (then only conjectured) gives a dominant term that you can pull out as a virtual diagram from those studies. So what you want—what was then the lively challenge was to make ever more precise experiments of this beautiful little, isolated little atomic atom through extreme precision.\n\nSo, my dissertation experiment used a method called Ramsey resonance in zero field. That’s a marvelous little piece of experiment, very characteristic of Telegdi’s style to devise this beautiful way of doing things. You measure the hyperfine integral in the absence of any background magnetic field—not by splitting the two hyperfine levels using a Zeeman. In the absence of the splitting, you apply a pulse of RF field, then turn it off and let the two hyperfine states evolve as quantum mechanical eigenstates, and then you apply a second analyzing pulse of RF field, and you measure the hyperfine interval thorugh the phase evolution of system after the second pulse.\n\nRamsey’s elegant method has been used in lots of classic experiments - in atomic physics. quantum optics, MR imaging, and NMR spectroscopy. It was such a beautiful experiment.\n\nAn irony followed in what was intended to be a follow-on experiment, in which the same split-field technique would be used in the presence of a magnetic field, at a particular magic field strength that was predicted to kill the first order terms that would otherwise create systematic effects. In theory that seemed to work very nicely. Alas, we found out the hard way that it leaves you wide open to terrible systematics arising from the details of the pulse structure of the polarizing and analyzing pulses, which produce artifact phase shifts that you can’t really control or even measure. Those make offsets that make your precision measurement bounce all over the place in succeeding runs. That succession of success and failure was a valuable lesson to me as a young physicist.\n\nI learned an immense amount working under Telegdi, with his meticulous style of devising precision experiments that could test the fundamental guage symmetries. That style was diametrically opposite to the style of the next scientist under whom I worked.\n\nAfter my experiments with Telegid I went to CERN as a Visiting Scientist and joined the team of Carlo Rubbia. Rubbia is the extreme opposite in all possible ways from Telegdi. Telegdi was this wizard of a chap who loved precision experiments, thoughtfully controlling by design every nuance of the things that could screw up his precision measurements and wrestling the thing down to just a beautiful art. Telegdi was just that embodiment. Rubbia, on the other hand, is a swashbuckling son character who strives to devise ways to get results quickly and find evidence of new physics before anybody else. And he succeeded spectacularly on the one occasion of discovering the electroweak bosons W and Z. He fell flat on his face multiple times before and after that, as with the false-discovery of the top quark that he championed at CERN, and the oscillating weak neutral currents before that era.\n\nZierler:\n\nI’m familiar, yeah.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nAt any rate, I never regretted one moment of my years with Rubbia, and I learned elements of style and ways of thinking from Carlo, but I retained the appreciation of precise measurements and method that I learned from Telegdi. Those two themes have made me what I am as a physicist.\n\nZierler:\n\nI can’t help but point out that physics needs both of those kinds of personalities to—\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nThey really do. And there are woefully few of either kind today. There are probably very few swashbucklers left in high energy physics. There are a lot of organization men and women trying to figure out how they’re going to keep their grants up and struggling to position themselves in large collaborations. But those are not necessarily compatible skills with some of the kinds of creativity from which discoveries arise.\n\nZierler:\n\nNow, Peter, when you defended and were thinking about postdocs, was it CERN or bust? Was that really where you wanted to be, or were you looking at, you know, Brookhaven, SLAC, Fermilab? Were you more broadly interested just to be in a major laboratory environment?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nWell, that one’s fairly simple to answer. I stayed with Val as a postdoc for the better part of a year, and that was when we did that failed experiment with split-field resonance at magic field. As that year ended, Val called me in and said, “You need to look for your next postdoc. And I have a suggestion for you.” He said, “Right now at CERN, they are building the next-generation muon g-2 experiment. An old friend of mine, Emilio Picasso, is the head of that enterprise. And I believe that the best thing you could do would be to apply to CERN for a Visiting Scientist position, and if you get it, then I believe you should join Emilio’s group. It’s an absolutely classic experiment.” I mean, you know from the history thereafter how classic it is.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nThey were building at that time what was the second generation of what now is a total of four generations of muon g-2 experiments. It’s another pure lepton virtual diagram experiment that can probe with extreme sensitivity the virtual diagrams from Higgs and from beyond. It has many potential systematic backgrounds, and so experimental design is utterly key to its success. Today the fifth generation muon g-2 experiment is being built at Fermilab, and I wish them well. Indeed, one of my former students is working in that team at Fermilab.\n\nAt any rate, I applied to CERN and I didn’t apply anywhere else for a postdoc. I applied to CERN as a Visiting Scientist, and they accepted me. When I arrived, they explained that I was free to work with any group at CERN, and they urged me to spend my initial days to identify three or four groups around the laboratory who are doing experiments that I found interesting and spend some time with each to decide which I wanted to join.\n\nTelegdi had already explained this to me - that every group would want me because as a Visiting Scientist position CERN pays my salary for that precious year. For me, it turned into a year and a half, but it’s a very finite-duration postdoc, and there’s no question of a future staff position for an American at CERN. Well, they hired one American: Steinberger. But that’s—he’s a little exceptional. He has a Nobel. So I took the advice. I talked first with the muon g-2 group. Picasso was very warm and welcoming, he’s a wonderful man, and he lined me up with Frank Krienen, who was the wizard of that experiment, tackling many of the most challenging aspects of experimental design that made it a complete success. They were very welcoming to me, and we discussed the roles I could play in the doing of their experiment. I’m sure it would’ve been a wonderful year for me if I had done that.\n\nThen I went to talk with Rubbia and his group. Rubbia at that time was running an experiment on ISR, the Intersecting Storage Rings, which at that time was the only colliding beam machine in the world at that time: 30 GeV per beam. Rubbia’s experiment was a marvelous spectrometer in which he was doing deep inelastic scattering, with a single arm spectrometer with particle identification (Cerenkov counters), calorimeters for identifying electrons, multilayer shields to identify muons. The inspiration of this experiment came from a succession of results from several other experiments at ISR and at fixed-target geometries that showed an excess of positrons produced with large transverse momentum. Just the proton-proton collision makes some positrons (about one in 10000 collisions) and you can explain the origin of those events from Drell-Yan production of e+e- pairs. There are also mechanisms that you can cook up and produce a positron for inverse diagrams with strange particle decays and one thing and another.\n\nBut all of those are calculable, and they give you an expected level of positrons : e/π = 10-4.\n\nBut Rubbia’s spectrometer was detecting ten times that many positrion! It was a real smoking gun for new physics, and it was a complete mystery.\n\nRubbia had an idea about where they were coming from because he was a professor at Harvard at that time. And he went back every week to the US, both to lead the Harvard role in the deep inelastic neutrino experiment at Fermilab, and also to teach at Harvard.\n\nHarvard at that time was the place to be in the entire universe for understanding the next generation of particle physics because that was the place where Weinberg and Glashow and Coleman were basically inventing particle theory. Those guys, there’s just no exaggerating the profundity of their intellects. The positrons we were seeing were in retrospect produced by beta decays of from charmed particles. The D+ can be produced in strong interaction processes in proton-proton colliding beams, then the D+ decays weakly into positrons through two levels of a cascade sequence. The high-momentum positrons we were seeing came from the gamma boost they got from the decay of the heavy D meson.\n\nBut our experiment was happening before charm was conceived of in a robust way, and certainly before it was discovered. Later in that year the Ψ vector meson was in fact discovered more or less simultaneously by Ting and by Richter. And about that same time, we got our data sets really tuned up, and everything in our experiment understood, and produced beautiful excess positron results that were a very clean smoking gun that aligned elegantly with the charm hypothesis that now became the electroweak theory and the GIM mechanism that were being invented by the theorists at Harvard.\n\nSo, I caught the bug visiting with the people in Rubbia’s group, and most particularly visiting with him, and I was an enthusiastic member of their team for that year and a half that I spent at CERN. I came back from CERN to be an Assistant Professor at Harvard, which at Harvard mean I came back to be the assistant to Professor Rubbia. And that was when I came up with my ideas for proton-antiproton colliding beams. But those ideas were born at CERN.\n\nIn the trajectory of my career, that time at CERN was immensely important to me because it was my first blush with learning how an accelerator works, how a collider works, how to think about beam cooling. Beam cooling hit its spectacular successes while I was there, both with the stochastic cooling of van der Meer and colleagues at the ISR, and with the spectacular success of electron cooling in Novosibirsk which happened the same year. I managed to get a plane ticket to Russia, and I spend a week with the group at Novosibirsk and learned how electron cooling worked. I spent a sideline activity during my last six months at CERN in a close collaboration with a Paolo Strolin, who become a close friend and colleague.\n\nPaolo was an engineer by training, and worked in the group of van der Meer on the ISR. He had been part of the team that did stochastic cooling, etc. He had become intrigued also with experimental particle physics and hatched the career goal to become an experimental particle physicist, after his training in engineering and accelerators. Paolo persuaded Rubbia to take him on for a year in his team on the ISR experiment.\n\nPaolo and I and three or four other young postdocs at CERN were keenly aware that buried in our respective trenches, we weren’t really able to get a bigger view of the exciting things going on in the rest of the world. So, we formed an impromptu journal club that met once a week, with as much wine as we could afford, and we would each take turns either giving a talk, or lassoing a visitor to CERN to give us a talk on something interesting. This was a totally self-organized enterprise of these postdocs, which is the most powerful sort of thing that can go on.\n\nIt was in the course of this that Paolo made me aware of the exciting results in Novosibirsk, and so he taught me how to think about electron cooling, and he and two or three of his colleagues in the ISR group taught me how to think about stochastic cooling.\n\nAnd Paolo and I began brainstorming how one might use this new beam cooling to make colliding beams, and in particular make colliding beams of protons with antiprotons. Could we manage to cool a beam of antiprotons, and store them in a storage ring, and then inject them to one ring of the ISR to make proton-antiproton colliding beams in that same facility?\n\nThere’s something to be said for that, but only a limited amount. The thing to be said is that that then gives you the annihilation channel of valence quarks colliding on valence antiquarks, which extends the mass reach with a given luminosity you have to discover a new particle or field of nature. But it had the disadvantage of course of the limitation that the top beam energy possible with the ISR was 30 GeV.\n\nWell, clever as you may be, you cannot use 30 GeV on 30 GeV to make, you know, an electroweak boson (laughter). Already at that time, purely from what was beginning to emerge from the Harvard wizards of electroweak theory, we knew that the mass of these gauge bosons, if they did exist, would be, you know, 80 and 90 GeV. Nevertheless, we worked through systematically all of the accelerator design that one must have for a more or less credible scheme for cooling and accumulation of antiprotons in that context.\n\nZierler:\n\nThis is what I’m here for. This is it.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nOkay. So, the gentle irony of this for me personally is it became obvious to us that there was actually a beautiful, almost made-to-order storage ring that had just the right parameters to be a cooling ring where we could do these experiments, and actually make antiprotons, and store them and cool them. It was the muon g-2 ring. But that moment was when the muon g-2 ring was beginning to work, was beginning to make its first measurements of muon g-2!. We had to realize somewhat bitterly that the last thing in the world that anyone at CERN would welcome was a couple of renegade postdocs coming along with a clever idea for how they could displace the muon g-2 team from their own machine so that we could do cooling experiments. The final irony of course is that is exactly where they did do the antiproton cooling experiments just 2 years later, and the muon g-2 ring became ICE, which is still cooling antiprotons today!\n\nSo, a few months later I then came to Harvard at the end of that CERN postdoc. And as Rubbia’s assistant professor, my job was to run his role in the neutrino inelastic scattering experiment at Fermilab where we were observing another consequence of charm, namely dimuon and trimuon final states in neutrino scattering. That experiment was a collaboration of Rubbia and Mann from Penn, and Cline from Wisconsin. And that’s where I got to know Dave Cline, and we became friends through the rest of his life.\n\nThere came a day, and I can even tell you the day—well, I can tell you within a week of the day. In late 1975 I was freshly back from CERN and taking on running Harvard’s role in the neutrino experiment. At that time Fermilab was beginning to build the superconducting magnets for its Tevatron – which was to be an upgrade for their accelerator from 400 GeV to 1 TeV. Wilson had been barraged for some months by letters and visits from the literati of experimental particle physics, banging on his desk that Fermilab should think of ways to turn its new Tevatron into a colliding beam machine because it might have the reach to discover the weak bosons.\n\nThere were three ideas to these great physicists were pushing to Bob Wilson, the Director of Fermilab. They all involved ways to make collisions between two beams of protons, each beam circulating in a separate accelerator. One idea came from Rubbia and Klein, suggesting that a proton beam in the Tevatron should be made to collide with another proton beam circulating in the 400 GeV Main Ring at an intersect where the two rings were made to cross. There were several immense practical challenges that were almost certainly insuperable (asymmetric beam energy compounded with the woefully inadequate 50 m straight sections in the Main Ring tunnel), but Cline and Rubbia were both swashbucklers, and swept the details aside.\n\nAnother idea came from Leon Lederman. Lederman teamed up with a physicist named Jimmy Walker, and they proposed proposal to collide a proton beam from the Tevatron with a proton beam in a small circular accelerator of perhaps 30 GeV energy.\n\nTheir idea overcame some of the limitations of the Rubbia-Klein scheme, but it had woefully inadequate energy to have good reach for the discovery of the W and Z, and it was a very awkward geometry to make a tight low-beta squeeze with high luminosity. And in all of those, you were colliding protons on protons.\n\nA third idea came from Burt Richter, co-discoverer of charm. His ideas again proposed asymmetric proton-proton collisions between two beams and was unworkable.\n\nNone of these illustrious physicists had the notion of colliding protons on antiprotons, because few in the United States in those days of late 1995 had heard of stochastic cooling at CERN. Accelerator physicists at Fermilab viewed it as probably a piece of flummery because it appears to violate Liouville’s theorem. Most accelerator physicists of that day took Liouville’s theorem as the word of God that you cannot violate - conservation of invariant phase space.\n\nSo all of the leading physicists of our field in the US were pushing Wilson to find a way to make collisions of protons on protons to make weak bosons, but all of them would’ve failed. And the theorists were realizing that what you can do on the back of an envelope that those schemes would not likely succeed in finding the W and Z. Wilson responded to their urgings by announcing that there would be a workshop in January 1976 where all ideas would be presented before the whole Fermilab family and critiqued to see if there were any that could work. He invited the user community and the lab’s accelerator physicists for the occasion.\n\nI dug out our designs for beam cooling, and antiproton accumulation, and realized that we could make it all work beautifully to make proton-antiproton collisions in a single ring – the Main Ring or the Tevatron at Fermilab, or the SpS at CERN. That approach would have none of the limitations of the two-ring schemes, and they had plenty of collision energy to find the W and Z.\n\nSo, I heard about this meeting, and I decided to stick my neck out. I sent a memo to Alvin Tollestrup, whom I’d never met, explained briefly my ideas for beam cooling and pp colliding beams, and requested floor time in the meeting to present my ideas. I half-expected that I would not be invited to speak, because I was a green-horn and had no credentials in accelerator physics at all. But, no, he gave me floor time.\n\nSo, January 24th, 1976 was an important day for me. I stood up in front of a pretty full auditorium at Fermilab, and gave a presentation of how beam cooling made it possible to gather a significant phase space into the aperture of a cooling ring, and how you could then cool that phase space, and then accumulate repeated production cycles, and then put them into the Main Ring and make colliding beams, and discover the weak bosons.\n\nThe elegance of pp is compelling. The proton and the antiproton have exactly the same mass and opposite electric charge, so if beams of protons and antiprotons are injected into an accelerator with the same momentum, traveling in exactly opposite directions, they would travel around the same circular orbit through the racetrack of dipole and quadrupole magnets! It gets even better: as the beams pass through radio-frequency (RF) resonant cavities that accelerate the particles to higher energy, the protons and the antiprotons are accelerated to higher energy at the same rate. So, you can inject an accumulated bunch of antiprotons going clockwise in the Main Ring at Fermilab, with 8 GeV of kinetic energy, then inject a bunch of protons going counterclockwise, and they will nicely orbit the same circle! Now you can simulataneously ramp the magnetic field and apply RF acceleration, and both of the counter-circulating bunches will gain energy while continuing to travel the same orbit! You don’t need to spend a billions of $ to build two new magnet rings for two beams of protons to travel separately!\n\nTollestrup gave me 20 minutes to talk at the meeting. Throughout my talk I saw people turning to each other and laughing and making their side remarks – many thought it a silly joke. But they let me finish.\n\nAnd then at the end, there was polite applause, and then the barrage of questions began. “Professor McIntyre, have you ever heard of Liouville’s theorem?” I said, “Yes.” “Well, what you just described violates Liouville’s theorem.” I said, “No, you’re incorrect: you’re not dealing with the phase space of a single entity. The cooling mechanisms make it possible to divide the phase space into separate pieces, re-arrange the pieces closer together without losing particles, and then reassemble the pieces into a smaller phase space volume.\n\n“But you can’t do that!” I said, “You’re misapplying Liouville’s theorem. Yes, you can divide and re-assemble without violating Liousville.” I had to answer that same answer about 10 times, and with each answer there was laughter, but with each round there was less laughter. At the end of the talk, it ended on a kind of a silence.\n\nThat night, Carlo Rubbia and I had to fly back to Harvard. As we sat together on the flight, Carlo turned to me and said, “Peter, today, you were right, and I was wrong today.”\n\nZierler:\n\nWow.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\n“We’re going to make this happen, and we’re going to discover the weak bosons.” We then spent the rest of the flight talking through a succession of the physics details of that whole thing, both on the particle physics side and on the accelerator physics side and developed a framework for the various directions we would pursue thereafter. And of course, Rubbia is one of the past masters at giving structure to a plan once you work out what you want to do.\n\nThe outcome of that at CERN was to bring Rubbia personally into the picture of this idea of mine. He could see the whole thing from that moment as a path to the Nobel. Just as he spanned the physics programs at Fermilab and CERN and traveled between them constantly, Carlo began doing his best to infect the people at CERN with the vision of pp in their SPS. This came at a perfect time for CERN because CERN was writhing with envy after discoveries of charm at Brookhaven and SLAC (awarded the Nobel that year) and how Europe had so totally missed the boat on that.\n\nI mean, charm could’ve been discovered at the ISR by Lederman, for one, by DiLella for another. Their two different experiments on two of the intersects of ISR recorded dilepton final states in proton-proton colliding beams. In both cases the teams regarded the resonant bumps as unwelcome fluctuations because they didn’t fit their models of Drell-Yan continuum that was at that time the vogue way to study the electromagnetic form factor of the proton. I mean, it makes you just sort of swoon in vexation that two different groups of phsyicists could be so stupid.\n\nSo, the Europeans were writhing in how they had missed the boat on this. And Rubbia showed them how they could use their SPS plus their discovery of one of the two forms of beam cooling to discover the weak bosons. And from that day on, he had a virtual carte blanche to develop this at CERN.\n\nFermilab meanwhile had precisely the same possibility – its Main Ring operated at 400 GeV energy, much higher than the 270 GeV of CERN’s SPS accelerator. It was adequate for making a colliding beam machine. But Fermilab’s culture was downright hostile to ceasing that opportunity. And that’s how sometimes history is written.\n\nTo many among the leadership in US high energy physics, including Lederman, it seemed a sacrilege to propose to dedicate their whole lab’s vitality to transforming the Main Ring into a collider. It would delay the commissioning of the Tevatron, and of course ultimately the Tevatron would provide even higher collision energy. Also, Lederman had an experiment running at Fermilab, using the beam from the the Main Ring to deliver protons for studying deep inelastic scattering of protons on a metal target to produce Drell-Yan pairs of muons. Years later that experiment migrated to the Tevatron, and ultimately discovered the b quark, which earned Lederman the Nobel.\n\nSo, Lederman saw this as an unwelcome diversion from the path of extending the reach of his dimuon experiment just to make these colliding beams that, in his view, likely wouldn’t work anyway. So that was the impasse I struggled with at Fermilab. I focused my energies on striving to persuade the people at Fermilab to give priority to transform thei Main Ring into a pp collisider. I failed.\n\nWilson gave me a group and bankrolled the building of a cooling ring where we demonstrated and studied both electron cooling and stochastic cooling. It gave us the wherewithal to design what ultimately became the antiproton source that was built for the doing pp at the Tevatron. That whole ensemble then evolved with time to produce just an amazingly successful method of making proton-antiproton colliding beams. The Tevatron was a spectacular collider. Few physicists realize that the Tevatron collider program produced a luminosity of proton-antiproton colliding beams at 2 TeV that fully equaled the best luminosity that LHC managed during its first long run of proton-proton collisions in LHC a decade later. The US did another dastardly deed when they ended the Tevatron program, and in effect ended hadron colliders in the US. Anyway, that kind of takes you through my era of postdoc and assistant professor.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhen you accepted the job at Harvard, what were your feelings on the prospects of tenure? Did you feel like—? This was like you just thought this was going to be an impossible thing, but it’s too good of an opportunity to pass up?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nTenure at Harvard for an assistant professor at Harvard, at least in those days, was essentially a joke.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd you knew this going in?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nOh yes, absolutely. And ironically, I was told by several of my Harvard faculty colleagues (but not by Carlo) that when I handed them my resignation to take the job I have now at Texas A&M, they were shocked because they said, “Well, you know, we were going to consider you for promotion in just another year or two.” And I said, “Well, you might’ve considered me, but it would’ve been a halfhearted consideration because I’ve seen your track record.” “You look only outside your own gates for where you’re going to find the next person that you anoint with a tenured position. You don’t look to promote from within, so why should I have believed in that?” On this—on that particular round of—you asked about the previous rounds of my career.\n\nI applied for a follow-on position at Caltech and at Berkeley and at Harvard. Berkeley offered me a job, and Harvard offered me a job. And so, I talked to several of my colleagues at CERN in deciding which of those offers I should take most seriously, they both had pros and cons.\n\nBerkeley does promote from within not infrequently, so that was definitely a pro. Harvard essentially never does, and I already understood that from the instance at CERN. On the other hand, charm had just been discovered, and that truly launched a revolution in our understanding of nature at the subatomic scale. I realized that virtually the entire coterie of particle theorists who were redefining what we understood to be the Standard Model were all at Harvard. It was an amazing place at that time.\n\nSo, to me, that decision was a no-brainer: go to Harvard, team with Carlo in his neutrino experiment, and learn the new wave of physics with Shelly Glashow and Steve Weinberg and Sid Coleman. I’ve ha d the good fortune to have made some very good choices: in some cases, by a little bit of flip to the coin, in other cases by forethought, that enabled me to grow and do interesting things.\n\nZierler:\n\nSo, in terms of the chronology, were you at Fermilab as a sort of a—as part of a gap between Harvard and A&M, or that was part of—on either side?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nI came to Harvard as Rubbia’s ‘assistant to the professor’. My role for him was to be the chief cook and bottlewasher for the deep inelastic scattering experiment, neutrino scattering experiment at Fermilab, experiments E1A and E310. Actually, it was E310 by the time I got there. It was the dimuon embodiment of the deep inelastic multi-lepton experiment.\n\nI would fly weekly between Harvard and Fermilab, At Harvard I immersed in learning how to think in gauge theory colleagues. And on the Fermilab end, I rose to the challenge of how to transform their accelerators into proton-antiproton collider. And I managed to get Wilson sufficiently energized so that he gave me a group at Fermilab as a group leader in parallel with my appointment at Harvard, and gave me the rope to hang myself (laughter)- He backed me to build and run this experimental storage ring so we could study and perfect the beam cooling methods that had been discovered in Russia and CERN. I learned accelerator physics more thoroughly at the knee of Fred Mills, who was a long-time accelerator builder at Fermilab, then approaching retirement age, who had been a veteran of the MURA days that pre-dated Fermilab. MURA was a kind of ferment at University of Wisconsin that led to the design of Fermilab, its Main Ring and the whole accelerator complex at Fermilab. So, step-wise in each of those venues, and largely in parallel, I learned these different parts of the trade, and how to use them.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid you—were you comfortable at Texas A&M as soon as you got here?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\n(Laughter) Well…\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd where was the department at that more- was—were you—was your hire part of a broader growth mode for the department?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nYes, it was. The chair of the Physics Department at that time was Robert Tribble, who is an eminent nuclear experimentalist. He’s now Associate Director of Brookhaven. Bob was at that time a pretty young guy. He’s just a couple of years older than I. He had become Department Head in a hiatus in this university when our department was kind of at a low ebb.\n\nThe previous Head had none of the kind of moxie tools that it takes to build a faculty or even to retain its strength. The College realized that the department had the numbers-game capacity to add quite a few faculty lines, and they wanted a new Head who could meaningfully guide that growth.\n\nSo, the Dean put the challenge to the Physics faculty. “You go find who you want as an internal candidate.” Then ensued the usual sort of internecine battle, with a few desiring to be Head, each hoping to steer that growth to his sub-field. And then there was Tribble.\n\nTribble didn’t throw his hat into the ring because he’d only been there a modest number of years, and he was not looking to build himself as a bureaucrat. He was looking to do nuclear experiments, and he’s damn good at it. The others kind of destroyed one another in the feud. But when the key faculty meeting arrived, th factional groups within the department were at a stalemate. As it was told to me, Tribble raised his hand, and said, “Well, I’ll do it if nobody else wants it.” And they all turned to him and said, “Well, you’ve got a damn good reputation in what you do, so give it a whirl.” The Dean bought on and handed him a carte blanche with half a dozen faculty positions to fill. Tribble decided to devote two positions to particle experiment because there was then no particle experiment at Texas A&M. Well, it’s kind of tricky to recruit people who are potentially going to be good at that game into a vacuum. People want to go where there’s something they can build on, right?\n\nTribble first called up Bob Webb, a chum from Princeton, where they had both been graduate students, and pitched this to him. Bob was then at UCLA, and was a co-PI on a collider experiment on another of the intersects at ISR. So Bob and I had known one another during our year at CERN.\n\nBob was interested, and asked Tribble to approach me to make it a team. I get a call one day from Tribble. He asked me if I’d ever thought about looking for a new home, and I said, “Well, I’m an assistant professor at Harvard, so I’m always looking for a new home.” (Laughter) And the—\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd the idea was that you would come on tenured, right?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nYes, but rather obviously, there would have to be a very short trial period, but with virtual certainty of tenure in the offing. So, I was pretty offhand with him. I’d never heard of Texas A&M so the first thing I said is, “Where is Texas A&M?” (Laughter) “What do your faculty do there?” And the answers were not particularly encouraging to me. But before making a decision, I decided I called my mentor Telegdi. I told him I was being recruited for a position at Texas A&M, and there was a pause on the other end of the phone.\n\nAnd Telegdi said, “Well,” he said, “Peter, I don’t know very much about Texas A&M. But I do know one person there whom I think very highly of. His name is Ed Fry, and he is a first-rate atomic experimentalist. The phrase quantum optics had not then been coined at that time, but it describes Ed does. He is a master at doing subtle things with controlling phases of atoms and beams of light. And he is undertaking what would be the ultimate experiment in Bell’s inequality, to close the last of the loopholes in Bell’s inequality, and either, you know, shit or get off the pot. Either it makes or it breaks that dimension of understanding quantum mechanics. It was a very important experiment. Many people have done variations of experiments on aiming to test Bell’s inequality. Every one of them has left loopholes that can give ambiguity to interpretation of the results. So, none of them has really settled this fundamental problem. I should then hasten to tell you that there remain, at least in the opinion of quite a few of us, some remnant loopholes in Bell’s inequality to this very day.\n\nSo Telegdi responded to me “Ed Fry has concocted a conceptual design for an experiment that I believe could close the loopholes.” Well, that coming from Telegdi was high praise indeed, because Telegdi was the kind of guy who really focuses on that kind of nuanced experiment to eliminate systematic effects to the last possible degree. Indeed, he had been beating his head on his own experiment of that character for the past three years since I had last spoken with him.\n\nTelegdi said, “Fry has designed, in my opinion, the very best experiment anyone’s come up with yet, and he’s in the process of building it, and I have high hopes that he’ll make it work.” Well, the post note to that is Fry has still not made his experiment work today! He has put it on the shelf over and over again in consideration of one or another thing that he’s undertaken instead because it wasn’t quite so difficult. He’s become the past master of several more mundane things but things that some people consider important. So, he’s never actually buckled down to do that ultimate experiment in the proper way, something that I rag him about on a regular basis.\n\nAt any rate, Telegdi’s answer to me is if Texas A&M is where Ed Fry is, it can’t be all bad (laughter). So, I flew to Texas, and made the visit. Webb and I talked through what it would take to build a group at Texas A&M create and take an achoring role in a proton-antiproton collider experiment for Fermilab, which was then beginning to organize itself to design and build a collider detector for what they had by that point begun to gird their loins for of building an ultimate pp collider once the Tevatron had done its first runs as a fixed target accelerator.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd, Peter, at this time when you were thinking about coming down, even the faintest whispers about a future SSC, this is way before that, right?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nTotally before. There were no faint whispers about SSC until after the weak bosons were discovered.\n\nZierler:\n\nRight, right.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nRubbia found the weak bosons at CERN in 1983, just after the Tevatron had been commissioned as an accelerator. By about 1980, the Fermilab had completed the Tevatron and commissioned its runs as a fixed-target collider, and was making its serious design of an antiproton source following our running and learning from the cooling rings.\n\nIt was in that window of that time, as Fermilab was getting into the serious game of building a collider detector in parallel with building the antiproton storage ring and antiproton production, etc., and getting into the game of pbarp, that I began frankly to shift my own personal focus to the question of what is possible and what is worth doing beyond the domain of 2 TeV pp that would come at Fermilab. I was certainly going to be part of that pp experimental program. I was a charter member of the collider experiment CDF, and was a proud co-discoverer of the top quark in 1995.\n\nBut already at that time I could see that while, you could hope that the Tevatron would have a sure base for discovering the top quark, it wasn’t terribly predictable that it was going to be able to discover anything beyond that. It was tantalizingly close to having enough energy to find what some conjecture might be the mass scale of the Higgs boson. Even in retrospect, I think it would’ve been problematic to ever find the Higgs with the Tevatron, for a couple of reasons I could go into.\n\nSo, I began to ask myself the question, what is the next step that it would make sense to try to take in this thing? I came to substantially exactly the same answer that Bob Wilson did. He called it a Desertron. It’s the idea that you identify the lowest-cost basis way to make a much higher energy hadron collider. Most especially you minimize the cost per TeV of the circular ring of superconducting magnets.\n\nThe logic is simple. A magnetic dipole bends a beam of protons in a circle with a radius R[km] = E[TeV] /.3B[T]\n\nSo, if you want to increase the collision energy of a future hadron collider you can either increase its circumference or you can increase the magnetic field of the dipoles.\n\nIf you are smart, you don’t choose the magnetic field based on a site that where you’d like to build it and a corresponding circumference. The cost and complexity of superconducting magnets increase non-linearly with field beyond the ~4T of the Tevatron. Magnets with 6 T field (like those for the design selected for SSC long ago) cost more than twice as much as magnets with 4T field (like the ones built for RHIC). And magnets with 8 T (like those for LHC) cost twice as much as those with 6 T. Push to higher field than 8 T and you must use Nb3Sn superconductor, which is 10 times more expensive than the NbTi used in all colliders to date. Instead you should choose the dipole field corresponding to the lowest magnet cost/TeV - ~4 T - and look for a site that’s big enough for the collision energy you want.\n\nIn 1983, fresh from the discovery of the weak bosons, it was clear that there was a very compelling reason to expect that the Higgs boson did exist. Theorists could not predict its mass with any certainty, but they could say that its mass must be less than ~1 TeV or the whole scheme of spontaneous symmetry-breaking of the electroweak interaction broke down.\n\n[End Session 1]\n\n[Begin Session 2]\n\nZierler:\n\nPeter, let me just do my introduction so it's clear in the transcript that this is round two. OK. This is David Zierler, oral historian for the American Institute of Physics. It is August 2, 2020. I'm so happy to be back with Professor Peter McIntyre. Peter, thank you so much for joining me again.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nPleasure.\n\nZierler:\n\nOkay. So, let's pick up on where we were last time. The last items that we discussed were we were talking about the top quark and Rubbia in 1978. And then you started discussing Bob Wilson's work and the excitement over the Higgs boson and working in those energies and identifying a place where a high-energy facility might possibly find the Higgs boson. And I guess my first question is, this word \"Desertron,\" so let's start there. Where did you first encounter this word and what does Desertron sort of convey?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nI'm not sure about this, but I think the term was actually coined by Shelly Glashow. He has always been a bit of a wit in our game, and it characterized with some humor one of the dimensions of Bob Wilson's vision for the question of how we reach beyond the Nobel discovery of W and Z that the United States missed by its own lack of action of the weak bosons. And how we pushed for what was already, at that point, a vision that was clearly in the crosshairs of the standard model, was the Higgs boson, which would be the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking. That was a well-characterized mystery; and trying to solve that mystery within the context of gauge theories led inexorably to the use of the Higgs mechanism to give rise to that spontaneous symmetry breaking. The Higgs mechanism was devised by theorists, not in the context of particle physics at all but of superconductivity. It is a very elegant, powerful mechanism within quantum field theory to give an origin to symmetry breaking to the fundamental things that happen both in solid state physics and in particle physics. And, actually, in many other regimes, as well, in different contexts. In this case, the understanding had an intriguingly predictive element to it. There were very good reasons to believe that it could not have a mass less than about 125 GeV. But the upper limit would depend upon how the Higgs sector materialized as a spectrum of new particles, whether it was one Higgs or a Higgs plus a doublet, etc. The Higgs mass scale could be as much as ~1 TeV but no more. And so, following the Nobel for W and Z, the brainstorming focused on how to access point-like mass scales up to TeV with high luminosity to try to find this new Higgs sector.\n\nThe collision energy required in colliding proton beams and all of the thinking for that purpose focused on proton-proton collisions, not on antiproton-proton, which I had invented and which had been used to find the weak bosons, because it was felt that this would require a very high luminosity at that energy in order to find the Higgs. At that time, all but a very few accelerator physicists thought that pp had really no prospect of reaching the higher luminosities of the order of 1032 cm-2s-1. That's the measure of the event rate of collisions per second that would produce a new particle with a certain cross section measured in cm2 in the collisions. That perception led the world of accelerator physics to that they would need to build a double ring (with twice the magnet cost compared withpp) to make proton-proton colliding beams in order to make the beams sufficiently intense to achieve that high luminosity. The gentle irony that unfolded over the following decade and more, really almost two decades, is that pp colliding beams at Fermilab in the Tevatron in fact got better and better and better until, guess what? The final runs ofpp, before the switch was finally flipped and Fermilab ceased to be a laboratory doing collider physics, was 1032 cm-2s-1!\n\nZierler:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nNo one except me and two other people at that time believed that would ever be possible.\n\nZierler:\n\nWho were the two other people, Peter?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nBob Wilson and Russ Huson, both from Fermilab.\n\nZierler:\n\nNow, are you writing, are you presenting, are you sort of trying to get the gospel out on this realization?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nNo. It seemed so hopeless the first time to convince folks to grudgingly acknowledge that pp colliding beams could give you luminosity needed to discover the W and Z. It was that much again hopeless for them to even contemplate that pp could ever produce such spectacular luminosity to discover the Higgs. It's a very peculiar kind of world we live in. At any rate, so the push, then, was to try to conceive of how to make these very high energy pp colliding beams. That leads into a theme that is replaying again in the present day: the interplay between dipole field strength and ring circumference that I explained earlier. In that era of the 1980s, the tunnel cost was perceived to be quite high (because the national labs hoped to build a next collider at Fermilab, where tunnel cost would have been high), and the superconducting magnet cost had come down somewhat with the development of the superconducting ring for Fermilab for the Tevatron, and the follow-on electron-proton collider HERA in Hamburg. So, a coalition of national labs chose 5.5 T for conceptual designs for SSC. And DOE ultimately adopted their design, which required a tunnel of 90 km circumference.\n\nBob Wilson had a different view. And I would say with honesty, but it might seem hubris, that I independently came to the same conclusion as Bob. Bob felt that the more promising approach was to open one's view of where to put the machine and seek a site where the cost of the tunnel would be absolutely minimized, and then be guided by that circumference in the choice of a magnetic field. That led to a magnetic field of ~3 T. His choice was actually 2 T, and the only place you could, at that time, contemplate finding a big enough site in the United States was in the desert. That would require a tunnel of about 250 kilometers in circumference, and you really needed a place that was both very flat and over a very large expanse with affordable land where you could, in principle, make the tunnel using the much less method of cut-and-cover rather than a bored tunnel.\n\nZierler:\n\nSo, Peter, what were some of the obvious contenders from the beginning that would fit this criteria?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nThere were really only two that surfaced, one that he surfaced and another that I surfaced. One would be out in one or another patch of desert in the west. There are several specific places. And another that I identified and actually led to one of the two candidate sites offered to DOE by Texas for the SSC as it was finally configured, and that was out circling around Amarillo, Texas, which is a comparably flat area called Llano Estacado, a very, very flat high plain with nothing but oil fields in it (laughter).\n\nZierler:\n\nSo, Peter, an extension of Fermilab was a nonstarter as far as you were concerned, doing this in Illinois?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nFor a cut and cover tunnel as it was a non-starter. You should first realize that the tunnel for the Main Ring at Fermilab—and the Tevatron was put in that same tunnel -- was built using cut-and-cover. That simply means you're digging a ditch down to the level where you want the ring to be sitting. The site must be very flat and the site at Fermilab on that scale of 1 km radius is very flat. The tunnel at Fermilab is 20 feet below grade. Then you just excavate from the surface, erect a hoop of tunnel liner segments in the ditch, and cover it up. That worked for Fermilab for the 1 km radius Main Ring tunnel, and it had low cost. Wilson understood that the right way to design a Higgs-capable collider is to try to find a site where we can do cut-and-cover—the tunnel costs for cut and cover is a third of the tunnel cost for the lowest-cost bored tunnel, where you take a tunnel boring machine and you tunnel through one or another form of competent rock or soft ground deep underground to make a tunnel. Wilson's logic was to find a sufficiently flat site for cut and cover tunnel, and adopt a magnetic field of ~2 T. That choice led him to a very elegant form of superconducting magnet which he dubbed a superferric dipole. Superferric simply refers to a magnet in which the magnetic field is generated by a superconducting winding that is closely coupled within a steel flux return and operated at a field at which the steel is un-saturated. Steel has a wonderful property of ferromagnetism in which the the amp-turns of current required in the winding is only what is required to drive the magnetic flux across the aperture of the beam, but the steel channels the return of that magnetic flux around the return path between the two poles. So, the price you pay for superconductor is only ~1/4 what you would pay in a dipole in which the flux had to return pole-to-pole through vacuum. Up to about 2 T of magnetic field, steel has a permeability of the order of 7,000, which means it only takes you 1/7,000th of the amp turns for the part of the path that goes around through steel to produce 2 T in the center. At the other extreme of that is a magnet like the 6.5 T ones developed for SSC and the 8 T ones built for LHC. They use a collared coil of superconducting niobium titanium arranged in a kind of Roman arch, in a cylindrical geometry, so that the magnetic flux must return in a permeability of 1. So, it requires much more superconducting wire in a magnet than in a superferric dipole. Wilson's rationale was to set the field at 2 T and make a very simple-to-build magnet, with very little superconductor required, but you would need clearly three times longer circumference to the tunnel, and three times total length more total length of the superconducting magnets.\n\nThe tradeoff between field strength and circumference was seen very differently by all the rest of the HEP community. To them, you want to put this in an interesting place like the site of Fermilab or the site that was chosen ultimately for the SSC, very close to Dallas, so that it's close to an industrial center, it's close to a major international airport, all the things physicists like to have around them to do their work. But the sites near such cities typically required a deep tunnel in competent rock and required a tunnel to be excavated using a tunnel boring machine. So, they reasoned that you needed to make the tunnel circumference as small as possible because the tunnel was going to be a major part of the cost of your project. That was the big dichotomy that was on the table. The only people who were pushing low-field solutions because of the virtue of the superferric magnet were me in Texas and Bob Wilson at Fermilab. Also, Russ Huson, who was the head of the accelerator division at Fermilab and had his own ideas which paralleled closely my own. Within six months of this ferment of ideas, I persuaded Russ to join me here in Texas and join our faculty. The two of us as a duo pushed forward a concept for a 3 T superferric magnet which then required a 150 km circumference tunnel.\n\nZierler:\n\nPeter, I want to ask, at this stage when you're beginning to become conscious of budgetary issues, how do you know what are reasonable numbers to work with? Do you have any sense, are there any studies, do you have anybody in Congress or elsewhere who's saying, you know, X amount of dollars is reasonable and doable, but X amount of dollars is totally off the wall and it's a nonstarter? Do you have any idea what numbers you're working with that might be viable in terms of getting this thing off the ground?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nWe did at the time. In those days' dollars in the context of what the government spent money on and what was viewed as in line with its costs and whatnot, one billion dollars was considered a tenable cost that would have made this a no-brainer. Two billion was pushing pretty hard. Three billion was very problematic. A parallel project through that whole period that was the International Space Station.\n\nZierler:\n\nRight.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nISS was originally proposed at a cost of a few billion $, But by the mid-eighties, its projected cost had grown to $10 billion. It ultimately cost $25 billion. Just at the time when the SSC was killed in 1993, the Space Station was at a very critical juncture where its cost had once again risen, and Congress was in the mood that they were going to kill something in the multibillion-dollar class.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd is your sense, is this sort of a post-Cold War—there's a much smaller appetite for supporting these major projects and it's a zero-sum game, it's either ISS or it's SSC? Was that your sense?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nWell, at a certain moment it came pretty close to that. If the SSC had not been killed—the ISS was really on the ropes at that moment, and it was at a stage where it took a presidential initiative, which Bush gave, to try to push that over that hump to save it. But the ISS was very healthy in Washington in the early eighties when the first efforts were being made to propose the SSC. All elements of the government were solidly behind the ISS at its then-projected costs.\n\nBut the ideas for SSC came at an awkward moment. President Reagan was trying to trim the budget, and he had just given a presidential directive to all federal agencies that there would be \"no new starts\" of major projects. It was the one point in his administration when he was determined to try to trim the budget because he ran us, after all, into what, in that era, were historic levels of deficit. That was the context within the Department of Energy, so discussion about a supercollider was not welcome.\n\nZierler:\n\nOnes that did not have an obvious military component, we should specify?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nSo, when Wilson went to Washington, when I went to Washington trying to get traction on notions of how to make the supercollider with the cheapest cost it could possibly be, the reaction was: It's not going to happen in the foreseeable future.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd when you say, Peter, you're going to Washington, who are you talking with? Strictly DOE people? Are you testifying on the hill? Are you at NSF? Who are the people?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nWell, initially it was strictly within DOE, but for the reasons I just gave it soon became clear to me that pragmatically this was simply not something that was going to be judged on its merits. DOE was happy to try to foster a modest program of technology R&D to try to quietly move forward at modest cost the development of magnet technology to make it a bit clearer what was possible for superconducting magnets, for 3 T magnets and for 6 T magnets.\n\nThere came an interesting episode that's a bit illustrative of how DOE works. Bill Wallenmeyer, the head of high-energy physics in DOE, called up the national lab directors and made an overture to them that they should have a very quiet workshop, out of the public view, to discuss putting together a modest technology R&D program that would shed some light on those questions; a very reasonable thing for an agency to do. Panofsky offered to host such a meeting at SLAC. This overture triggered strong ambitions at each of the laboratories hoping that if this did result in something it might be in their backyard, either on Brookhaven or on Fermilab, for where this thing might be built. And so, there was a certain naturalness to have the meeting at SLAC, where there would be no question that it would be built nearby. I mean, after all, the San Andreas fault had a lot to say about building large circumference tunnels in that area. So, it was a neutral ground place to do that meeting. I had been doing my best to put forward ideas for a superferric SSC and there were folks at each of the national labs looking at high-field magnet designs. To them it only made sense to aim for a magnetic field of 6 T or 7 T. Both Brookhaven and Fermilab had devoted huge efforts to develop such magnets and considered that their territory in accelerator technology. So, they scorned the notion that Wilson, even though he was Director of Fermilab, had been putting forward this renegade low-field design.\n\nWallenmeyer’s meeting was framed to pull together the advocates of the 6 T and 7 T designs. And the meeting was planned with absolutely no word that they were even having this meeting filtering to me.\n\nBut Russ Huson was allied with Bob Wilson in developing the superferric design, and his own choice of field was 3 T. Because he was director of Fermilab’s accelerator division, he knew that the meeting was happening. He and I were in contact and discussing back and forth our respective ideas, which were closely similar. And so, when he told me about this meeting, I felt that an opportunity was about to pass in which the government was responding in its way to the need for a future machine, but it was about to be captured by an ensemble of interests that were entirely focused on what I believed was a dead end for the project, because it would make it far too expensive.\n\nZierler:\n\nSo, you saw, Peter, that this was going to balloon well past that 2-billion-dollar threshold?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nOh, there's no question.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah.\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nIt would have been 3, 4, 5 billion at best.\n\nZierler:\n\nRight, right. So, this is important because this sort of throws cold water on the idea that some people have said that this was viable at 2 billion and that the cost overruns up to 8, 9, 10 billion, that was sort of a surprise after the fact?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nYeah.\n\nZierler:\n\nYou're saying that this was obvious even at the conceptual stage?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nTo me, yes.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd how important was that for you to get the word out both to colleagues and to people who were pulling the purse strings that either this needed to be reined in one way or this is DOA from the beginning?\n\nMcIntyre:\n\nWell, most people in the scientific community regarded it as DOA period because of Reagan's directive. And most people in the government also viewed it as DOA because of Reagan's directive. Fixing that problem is a later chapter I'll come back to if you wish. But it became clear to me that if I was going to get anywhere, I would need money, and to ge"
