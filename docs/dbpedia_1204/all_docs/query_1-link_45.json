        "text": "Updated July 15, 2016 at 3:00 AM\n\nThe Irish playwright and social critic George Bernard Shaw once wrote, \"Bourgeouis morality is largely a system of making cheap virtues a cloak for expensive vices.\"\n\nThe philosophical implications of Shaw's critique could easily inspire hours of heated debate-or a toast over tequila shots--but Shaw got one thing right beyond argument: Those vices can get pretty freaking expensive. Given the number of multi-millionaire celebrities who've exhausted mind-boggling monetary resources on alcohol, parties, drugs and general debauchery, how can a cash-strapped college student expect to have even a semblance of a hedonistic good time without going completely belly-up?"
