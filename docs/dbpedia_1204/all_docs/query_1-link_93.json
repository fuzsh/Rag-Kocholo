        "text": "Actor Dick Van Dyke on Entertainment Tonight on October 22, 2022. | Two people holding hands. | Source: Youtube.com/Entertainment Tonight | Shutterstock\n\nThe \"Mary Poppins\" icon has had three main loves in his life, and it all started with Margie Willet.\n\nHe later was by Michelle Triola's side through her last days after battling cancer, proving that there's genuine love even if you don't get married.\n\nVan Dyke found love again with Arlene Silver in 2006 and got the approval of his firstborn son after their wedding in 2012.\n\nHollywood date, get married, break up, and everything in between, just like anyone else, and Dick Van Dyke is no exception. In 1945, he was 20 years old and started dating a girl, Margie Willett, from his hometown in Danville, Illinois.\n\nThe couple lived in Malibu during the beginning of his career, and they both loved it. Over the years, they tried for children and finally had four, but it wasn't without heartbreak. Willett got pregnant with twins but sadly miscarried.\n\nAmerican actor, comedian and singer Dick Van Dyke dancing with his wife Margie at a Screen Producers' Guild party, USA, 1964. | Source: Getty Images\n\nThe actor explained that they were evicted from their Malibu home for lack of rental payments while at the hospital. Afterward, Van Dyke had to travel to perform with Philip Erickson for \"The Merry Mutes.\"\n\nFortunately, he and Margie had four children during their relationship. Van Dyke is also a grandfather of seven and has four great-grandchildren. But back in 1948, he and Margie had no money to get married.\n\nBut a radio producer stepped in, paying for everything and sending them on a honeymoon. All they had to do was do it on his show, so in 1948, Van Dyke and Willett said \"I Do\" before two microphones and over 15 million people heard their wedding.\n\nThe Morning Show, a CBS News television program.

She maintained a low profile; sometimes, people thought they were siblings.\n\nVan Dyke told The Guardian, \"Once, when I appeared on a magazine cover, Margie snapped up six copies, and the cashier asked if she was my mother.\"\n\nHis children became between 1950 and 1961. Christan Van Dyke was the first son, but the second boy, Barry, was born just a year later. Their first daughter, Stacy, was born in 1955, and Carrie Beth finally arrived in 1961.\n\nAmerican actor Dick Van Dyke pictured with his wife Margie Willett in London in 1964. | Source: Getty Images\n\nThe kids followed their father's footsteps early, as they were all featured on several episodes of \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" \"Diagnosis: Murder,\" and \"The New Dick Van Dyke Show.\" The tradition continued through other generations, as Barry's children were also on the show.\n\nIn 1998, the actor said to CNN jokingly, \"It's one way to get to see your grown kids. Barry's teenage sons were on, and I had my daughter Stacy on the show, too. That's carrying nepotism to its ultimate!\"\n\nHis eldest, Christian, debuted on television on January 31, 1962, on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show.\" He played a character called Frankie, who wore a fedora and snapped his fingers. But his career in show business was short-lived.\n\nDick Van Dyke and Margie Willet Van Dyke with their daughter casual street photograph; circa 1970; New York. | Source: Getty Images\n\nInstead, Van Dyke's son went to Occidental College in L.A. and got a law degree at Arizona State University later. He became a lawyer in Oregon and later a district attorney in several counties. He even did corporate legal counseling for Nike and served as VP of marketing for Patagonia.\n\nHe had a daughter, Jessica, with Caroline Heller, but his child died at 13 due to chicken pox and Reye's syndromeâeventually, the couple had two more children. The entire family remains close together, and Christina is protective of his father.\n\nHis second son, Barry, loved Hollywood more than his big brother. He debuted in 1961 on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" as well but continued in the business, although Van Dyke told him to wait until he was older to become a serious actor.\n\nPortrait of American actor and comedian Dick Van Dyke with his wife, Margie Willet, posing in front of a fire place with their four children: Barry, Carrie, Chris, and Stacey.

On his father's show, the kids were protected in a sense. But the family moved around a lot, and Barry acted out in school because he was always the new kid.\n\nWhen Barry turned nine, they finally settled in Los Angeles, although they were kept from the limelight. During his teenage years, Barry worked at a movie theater, met his future wife, and later became a runner and helper on \"The New Dick Van Dyke Show.\"\n\nThe comedian helped him get an agent and landed a few minor roles in \"Galactica,\" \"Airwolf,\" and \"Casino.\" He married Mary Carey and had three children. Van Dyke was proud of his son for being a wonderful father.\n\nDick Van Dyke and Lee Grant.

You're seeing the real him. All that warmth and humanity really comes across. So I tend to play myself. So their relationship is pretty much ours.\"\n\nThe father-son duo also appeared in \"Murder 101.\" Barry reiterated how great it was to work with his father. The young Van Dyke continued acting. In 2019, he appeared in \"Heavenly Deposit,\" but his best part is being a father and grandfather.\n\nHis sons, Carey and Shane, wrote a spec script that later became \"Don't Worry Darling,\" featuring Florence Pugh, Chris Pine, and Harry Styles. Van Dyke's Stacy also appeared on several of her father's shows, including \"Diagnosis: Murder.\"\n\nAmerican actor Dick Van Dyke and his children host a telecast of the 1939 film 'The Wizard of Oz', circa 1961. | Source: Getty Images\n\nThe comedian said that his daughter participated in several school plays, but only later did he realize how good she was at acting. During the '70s, Stacy worked with the Windmill Dinner Theater as part of the Barnstormers. She later married a musician from the group and decided to stay away from the spotlight.\n\nShe was last seen acting on \"Diagnosis Murder: Town Without Pity.\" Meanwhile, the youngest of the brood, Carrie Beth, continued the tradition as her big siblings, joining \"The New Van Dyke Show\" in the '70s.\n\nBut aside from that, she has also remained away from the public eye. She married Kevin McNally, who appeared in several episodes of \"Diagnosis: Murder.\" They worked together at the Windmill Dinner Theater as well.\n\nSix-year-old CARRIE BETH and her sister STACEY, 13, steal the scene here from their brother BARRY, 16, and father DICK VAN DYKE, who watch as the girls go round the merry-go-round at Pinewood Studios. in 1968. | Source: Getty Images\n\nMcNally wrote a song about the early days of their relationship, featuring Stacy and her husband. He uploaded it on SoundCloud in 2015. They have two children and live in Los Angeles too.\n\nUnfortunately, many troubles befell their family, such as their parents' addiction. In 1972, Van Dyke was admitted to a hospital for alcoholism, where he spent three weeks recovering. Meanwhile, Willett was taken to the same place for problems with prescription drugs. The actor told The Guardian:\n\n\"When I went into therapy, I realized I was repeating my father's mistakes. He often came home drunk after lengthy road trips, and my mother threatened to walk out unless he quit â which he did. When I pledged to quit and entered a rehab clinic, Margie checked in as I checked out. I thought she'd come to pick me up, but it turned out she was hooked on antidepressants. I had no idea. What a pair.\"\n\nDick Van Dyke with his children, (clockwise from top) Chris, Stacey and Barry doing 'lead-ins' for the special broadcast of THE WIZARD OF OZ.

Meanwhile, the comedian was doing his best, but he acknowledged his 25 years as an alcohol addict.\n\n\"I tried to be a good role model to my children, but I was an alcoholic for 25 years, which inevitably impacted on family life,\" Van Dyke expressed with regret. He also explained that their addiction problems resulted from more significant issues in their relationship: it was falling apart.\n\nFinding Solace in Michelle Triola and Arlene Silver\n\nWhen it became clear that he and Willett wouldn't be able to reconcile and continue their marriage for much longer, Van Dyke started confiding in his agent's secretary and actress, Michelle Triola. Triola herself was going through some trouble.\n\nDick Van Dyke and Michelle Triola attend 15th Annual Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards at Variety Arts Center in Los Angeles, California on April 2, 1984. | Source: Getty Images\n\nShe was in the middle of a lawsuit with actor Lee Marvin after their six-year relationship went awry. So, they found comfort in each other, but it wasn't easy for Van Dyke. In his memoir, \"Keep Moving,\" he wrote:\n\n\"I was drawn into a relationship. I was involved with a woman other than my wife. It was unbelievable. I was writhing in guilt. By 1976 I had to do something. I needed to be honest.\"\n\nHe and Margie decided to live apart, but their divorce was not finalized until 1984, after being together for 36 years. Being with Triola after that was effortless, especially because she knew show business, and they were together for 35 years. But they never got married.\n\nArlene Silver attends the Backstage at The Geffen fundraiser at Geffen Playhouse on June 4, 2012 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nIn 2006, Van Dyke met Arlene Silver, a makeup artist 46 years younger than him. They saw each at the green room of the SAG Awards, and although the actor had never approached a strange woman, he decided to introduce himself.\n\nSilver became his makeup artist for the award ceremony. They formed a close friendship, which would later become a romantic relationship. Unfortunately, 2008 brought some heartbreaking news for the comedian.\n\nIn 2008, Van Dyke's ex-wife, Margie, passed after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. Despite being separated for a while, he wrote, \"Even though we were long divorced, with her death, I lost a part of myself.\"\n\nMichelle Triola Marvin, Adam Hoffberg, and Dick Van Dyke in March 2007. | Source: Getty Images\n\nHowever, doctors told Michelle she had lung cancer only one year later. Van Dyke added:\n\n\"When she asked if she was going to die, I pretended I didn't know â the hardest acting I have ever done.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Michelle lost her battle shortly after the diagnosis, but Van Dyke was by her side through her last days, even when she fell into a coma. The actor \"sang and talked to her until the hospice nurses told me she was gone.\"\n\nMichelle Van Dyke and Dick Van Dyke during 2007 Golden Heart Award Honoring Mary Murphy - Arrivals at Beverly Hills Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, United States. | Source: Getty Images\n\nFinding New Happiness Again\n\nAlthough their bond started as colleagues, Silver was there for Van Dyke after Triola's death. She would take care of him, bring him food, etc. \"She was such a support, I fell in love,\" Van Dyke told People.\n\nHe later told the Oprah Winfrey Network that he had to marry her after all that. Comically, Silver didn't know who he was at the time. She knew of him but had no idea about his career, so Van Dyke made her watch \"Mary Poppins\" and \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\"\n\nThey walked down the aisle in 2012, and both were beaming in the wedding photos. Van Dyke's publicist Bob Palmer commented, \"It's a really nice relationship, most people like her a lot. Despite their obvious age difference, Dick has never been happier. She brings a lot of light into his life.\"\n\nLife Achievement Award winner Dick Van Dyke (C) is congratulated by Arlene Silver (R) during the 19th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards held at The Shrine Auditorium on January 27, 2013 in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images\n\nAside from Van Dyke's brother, his son Christian also had some reservations regarding Arlene. But the comedian told The Guardian that after they said their vows during the ceremony, his firstborn came to him and said, \"Dad, I get it.\" He added:\n\n\"We don't feel the age gap. I'm emotionally immature, and Arlene is very wise for her age, so we meet in the middle.\"\n\nDick Van Dyke (R) and Arlene Silver arrive for the 2017 AMD British Academy Britannia Awards presented by Jaguar Land Rover and American Airlines at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on October 27, 2017 in Beverly Hills, California. | Source: Getty Images\n\nThe actor also told Parade that marrying Silver was one of the \"smartest moves\" he ever made. They remain together to this day, and it's hard to believe that Van Dyke is 97 years old. His family blessed him with grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and he loves it:\n\n\"They call me Crazy Grandpa! I have four kids, seven grandkids, and four great-grandkids. Maybe I can become a great-great-grandfather if I hang on!\"\n\nFurthermore, the kids accepted Arlene quicker than everyone else in the family. \"My grandkids call her Grandma. My four kids just love her,\" he said to People in 2013. Van Dyke and Silver also live in Malibu.\n\nDick Van Dyke and wife Arlene Silver the premiere of Disney's \"Mary Poppins Returns\" at the El Capitan Theatre on November 29, 2018 in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images\n\nSurprisingly, Van Dyke's firstborn was not the only person who thought they wouldn't work. Silver didn't believe it, as she told The Oprah Winfrey Network. Due to their wide age gap, no one thought it would work, including Van Dyke's brother.\n\nBut they were wrong. The couple maintains an active lifestyle, dances as much as possible, and shares everything they have in common. She keeps him younger. Silver is also fond of singing, and they perform duets around the house almost daily.\n\nDuring the pandemic, she even decided to learn some of Van Dyke's favorite pieces. Silver told People:\n\n\"I learned all the music he knows so I can keep him singing. Every show tune, every standard. I know all of them now, and I didn't know any of them before.\"\n\nFurthermore, they love hosting karaoke gatherings in their house and invite everyone who likes to sing. Their Valentine's Day in 2013 was spent just like that.\n\n\"We have a karaoke party and all the gang that we know who like to sing come over. And we all get in the living room and sing all evening. It's a tradition,\" the comedian explained. But according to Silver, no one takes the mic. Instead, everyone sings together with the lyrics playing on the television.\n\nncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1nb2llbnqltcKkZK%2BZnmKxurfEZqqappdis7C%2BjJ2YsqtdqbxutMisZKWnppp7qcDMpQ%3D%3D"
