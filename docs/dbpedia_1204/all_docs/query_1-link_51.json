        "text": "Name: Dick Van Dyke.\n\nAge: 87.\n\nAppearance: 50% teeth, 50% twinkle.\n\nDick Van Dyke is still alive? Yes he is. But you get the feeling that the universe isn't particularly jazzed about this.\n\nReally? Why? He was just rescued from a burning car. It burst into flames as he was driving along the Ventura freeway in Los Angeles, and he was rescued by a group of off-duty nurses who apparently found him slumped over the steering wheel.\n\nIs he OK? He seems fine. Soon afterwards he tweeted a photo of the melted wreckage along with the caption: \"Used Jag for sale REAL CHEAP!!\"\n\nThank God. An accident like that would have done most people in. Yes, but this is Dick Van Dyke we're talking about. He cheats death on a daily basis.\n\nThis sort of thing has happened before? You don't remember the porpoise incident?\n\nThe porpoise incident? The porpoise incident. In 2010, Dick Van Dyke fell asleep on his surfboard and woke up surrounded by a swirl of circling fins. He felt the chill of his own mortality sweep through him. But it's OK, he said, because \"they turned out to be porpoises, and they pushed me all the way to shore\".\n\nThis is brilliant. Dick Van Dyke is unkillable. How else has he cheated death? He's quite old. Does that count?\n\nProbably not. Didn't think so.\n\nDick Van Dyke is lovely. Why does the cosmos have it in for him? Perhaps there are just too many Van Dykes in the world now. In fact, Dick has spawned a huge acting dynasty. His children Barry Van Dyke, Carrie Van Dyke, Stacey Van Dyke and Christian Van Dyke are all in showbusiness, as are his grandchildren Shane Van Dyke, Taryn Van Dyke, Carey Van Dyke and Wes Van Dyke.\n\nAnd how many have appeared in Diagnosis: Murder? Pretty much all of them. You can sort of see the universe's point, really.\n\nDo say: \"Diagnosis: flukey.\""
