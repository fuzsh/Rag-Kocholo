She appeared in three episodes of the TV show Diagnosis: Murder in 1993. Additionally, she played the role of student \"Lisa\" in a 2006 episode of The Hallmark Channel's TV series Murder 101 titled \"College Can Be Murder.\"\n\nBefore Fame\n\nHer career as an actress is limited to the handful of TV appearances she made as a child and very little is known about her life now.\n\nTrivia\n\nBoth of her acting credits were roles in which she got to share the screen with family members. In Diagnosis: Murder, she appeared alongside her three brothers as well as her father and grandfather. Her father and grandfather were also the stars of Murder 101, which she appeared on for one episode in 2006. Although the majority of her family has made some attempt at fame, she has maintained a life under wraps for the most part. Her Instagram account thetarynvandyke28 is kept private.\n\nFamily Life\n\nShe is the only daughter born to parents Barry Van Dyke & Mary Cary Van Dyke. She has three brothers named Shane, Carey, and Wes. She also has two aunts named Carrie-Beth and Stacy, as well as an uncle named Christian.\n\nAssociated With"
