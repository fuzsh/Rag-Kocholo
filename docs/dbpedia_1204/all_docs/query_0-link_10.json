        "text": "Theatre, film and television star Dick Van Dyke will co-star with his sons Barry and Shane in the upcoming production for the Hallmark Channel. The film, according to the Hallmark Channel website, is described as such: Criminologist professor Jonathan Maxwell (Dick Van Dyke) is off to the races to find out what's happened to a missing champion thoroughbred horse in this latest installment of the Hallmark Channel Mystery Movie 'Murder 101: If Wishes Were Horses.' However, what begins as a simple horse-napping is quickly rounding the turn into an all out mysteryâ€¦ and murder. There's more to this disappearance than meets the eye and it will take all of Jonathan's criminal horse sense to solve the case!\"\n\nDick Van Dyke's Broadway credits include The Girls Against the Boys, The Music Man and Bye Bye Birdie; most recently, he joined his Birdie co-star Chita Rivera in Chita Rivera: The Dancer's Life. Van Dyke is well known for his film roles in \"Mary Poppins,\" \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" as well as his television series \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" and \"Diagnosis: Murder.\"\n\n\"Murder 101: If Wishes Were Horses\" will air on the Hallmark Channel Aug. 18 at 9/8 Central; check local listings.
