        "text": "Helena, Montana is perfect for family photography. From the rustic mountains to the valley full of flowing grass, a photographer is pretty much spoiled wherever they look. Want to hear a secret? Photographing families always intimidated me. I tried my best to steer clear from them the best I could, until one day I realized… I can do this!\n\nLast week I ventured down to Logan, Utah for a photography workshop with a photographer I have always admired, BreAnne Weston. Seven girls from all over came together to learn from her techniques in business and photography, but we all walked away with new friendships and a new excitement for family photography.\n\nI’m a recovering perfectionist. I want things to. be. perfect. That never happens with family photography. Hence, why I avoided it at all cost. At the workshop I learned to literally find joy in all the chaos, treat the session more like what it is supposed to be–REAL.\n\nI think a lot of families tend to think, “There’s NO way my kids would behave for a photoshoot” or “I’d NEVER convince my husband to take photos for me”. Never say never! If they know they can just be THEM and enjoy themselves, leave the rest to me! I promise it will be fun!\n\nShane and Brett’s family shoot was just that–fun! I’m so happy they let me just hang out with them and enjoy a golden evening together! Cheers to more fun memories guys!\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also enjoy:\n\n5 Tips for a Fun & Relaxed Family Shoot\n\nWhy Choose to Do a Lifestyle Family Session"
