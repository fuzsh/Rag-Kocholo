He, along with his brothers Shane and Wes, and his sister, Taryn,guest-starred in several episodes of Diagnosis Murder, the murder mystery show that starred his father and grandfather, the legendary Dick Van Dyke. He also wrote the episode \"The Blair Nurse Project\" for the show. He married his wife, Anne, in February 2000, and their first child, Ava, was born the following July. Their second daughter, Gracie, was born December 2003. Another daughter, Jane, joined the family in May 2007.\n\nArticle that mentions Carey\n\n\"Two years after its cancellation, the long-running TV mystery series Diagnosis Murder briefly resurfaced in this two-hour \"movie.\" Dick Van Dyke returned to the role of crime-solving medico Dr. Mark Sloan who, at the beginning of the story, is basking in the glow of his daughter Carol's (Stacy Van Dyke) marriage to Arabian-American Anton (Fahan Tahir). Not long afterward, however, Mark receives a frantic phone call from Carol who was stranded with her husband in a remote small town. Upon his own arrival in the village, Mark was forced to confront the horrible prospect that Carol and Anton might have been murdered. With the help of his police-detective son Steve (Barry Van Dyke), his fellow doctors Jessie (Charlie Schlatter) and Amanda (Victoria Rowell), Mark tried to get to the bottom of his daughter's disappearance -- and in the process, he unearthed a hotbed of intrigue, treachery, race hatred, and political corruption. The more tragic elements of the story were leavened by the presence of Dick Van Dyke's grandson, Carey Van Dyke, as a clumsy thief. Filmed in the spring of 2001, Diagnosis Murder: A Town Without Pity was aired by CBS on February 6, 2002.\" ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nWhy Am I a Fan?\n\nI first became a fan of Carey's when I saw him on Diagnosis Murder in the episode \"Never Say Die\". His performance in this episode, as the owner of a boxing club, was one of the most memorable I'd seen on the show. Finding out that he was a Van Dyke only made it that much better. After seeing Carey on Diagnosis Murder, I made it a point to see every episode Carey guest-starred in, including non-Diagnosis Murder episodes like JAG and Clueless. The emotions that he is able to portray in each character that he takes on makes his talent crystal clear. It's easy to feel whatever emotion towards the character you're expected to. If it calls for sad, Carey makes you sad. If it's supposed to make you laugh, that's what will happen. I think Carey has a lot of talent and cannot wait to see what's next for him.\n\n2007 Update\n\nThanks to the Van Dykes for this update! Carey and Anne welcomed daughter Jane in May of 2007. Carey has been busy writing screenplays...\"mostly horror\"...and filming an episode of \"Murder 101\".\n\nDiagnosis Murder Episode Guide\n\nNotice: I do not know or have any connection with Carey Van Dyke or the Van Dyke family.
