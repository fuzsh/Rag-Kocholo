        "text": "It was the show that students up and down the country worshipped while eating Pot Noodles each weekday morning. It shouldn't work, and a lot of the time it didn't – but that's why Diagnosis: Murder is a true TV gem.\n\nFollowing the exploits of Dr Mark Sloan (an entirely different Dr Mark Sloan to McSteamy from Grey's Anatomy – how dare they?), the show starred everyone's favourite fake cockney Dick Van Dyke.\n\nThe show ran for a whopping 178 episodes and five TV movies from 1993 to 2002. Yep, it was still going in the noughties. And did you know that a total of EIGHT Van Dykes appeared in the show at one point or another?\n\nAnyway, enough nerdy facts. Let's find out what the main cast have been up to since.\n\nDick Van Dyke (Mark Sloan)\n\n[He looks EXACTLY the same 20 years later]\n\nLet's start with the big man himself. Landing the part after impressing as a villain in 1990's Dick Tracy, it's hard to imagine anyone else as the loveable and calm Sloan who got given a special 'medical consultancy' job with the LAPD.\n\nAlready a household name around the world for his roles in The Dick Van Dyke Show, Mary Poppins and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, he cemented his standing as a TV legend with Diagnosis: Murder in the 1990s.\n\nHe has continued to act to this day, appearing in various TV shows including Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Murder 101 and The Middle, and had a particularly emotional and powerful episode as a different doctor in Scrubs.\n\nThe multi-talented star has also appeared in all three Night at the Museum movies as Cecil Fredericks, and even sang the national anthem at three LA Lakers games live on NBC in 2007. Quite rightly, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1995, and received the Screen Actor's Guild's highest honour, the SAG Life Achievement Award in 2013.\n\nBarry Van Dyke (Steve Sloan)\n\nThe super-coiffed Bazza is amazingly 64 years old now, but he still looks like someone you wouldn't want to mess with. Diagnosis: Murder is easily the biggest thing Barry has starred in, but that's no bad thing.\n\nHis four children Carey, Shane, Wes and Taryn all appeared in the show throughout its run, with Shane featuring on several occasions as Alex Smith. Since the show wrapped, Barry's biggest role came in a few Murder 101 TV series, opposite – you guessed it – his dad.\n\nVictoria Rowell (Amanda Bentley)\n\nBefore playing Dr Bentley in D:M (do some work Amanda!), Victoria was best known for playing Drucilla in daytime soap The Young and the Restless, and impressively appeared on both shows simultaneously in the 1990s.\n\nShe continued playing Drucilla until 2007, before leaving on rather bad terms after she labeled the show as racist for not having enough black cast and crew. Drucilla met her end after falling off a cliff, though she has expressed an interest in returning ever since. That might be on hold for now after she filed a lawsuit against CBS for racial discrimination earlier this year.\n\nVictoria has also popped up in various films and TV shows over the years including Dumb & Dumber, Law & Order: SVU and Home of the Brave. She has also been recognized for her work with foster children charities, receiving an honorary Doctorate by the University of Southern Maine in 2006.\n\nScott Baio (Jack Stewart)\n\nAh, one of the coolest child actors of all time. Scott was already a massive star by the time he took the role of Dr Jack in D:M, having starred as Chachi in Happy Days and its spinoff Joanie Loves Chachi, and of course the title role in Bugsy Malone.\n\nHe was only in the first two series, but has appeared in a variety of films and TV series since, though none of them are quite the pedigree of his early career. These have included roles in Veronica's Closet, Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2, and most recently the sitcom See Dad Run.\n\nHowever, he did play the rather inept lawyer Bob Loblaw in Arrested Development, returning for its 2013 series. He has also dipped into reality TV for VH1's Scott Baio Is 45… and Single and Scott Baio Is 46… and Pregnant. Funnily enough, he got married in 2007 to Renee Sloan (no relation to Mark or Steve).\n\nCharlie Schlatter (Jesse Travis)\n\nWhat do you do when your chief heartthrob Scott Baio leaves? Get me Charlie Schlatter! Before the series, he was known for the 1988 comedy 18 Again!, the 1990 sitcom Ferris Bueller attempt, and even the Australian movie The Delinquents with a very young Kylie Minogue.\n\nSince D:M, Charlie has focused more on voice acting, and was originally cast as Fry in Futurama before a casting change saw Billy West land the role. But he has provided voicework for a host of shows and games, including Griff in Sonic the Hedgehog, The Flash in Superman, Major Raikov in Metal Gear Solid 3, and Robin in various Lego games.\n\nMichael Tucci (Norman Briggs)\n\nYou may know Michael more for playing the cheeky no-hoper T-Bird Sonny in Grease. After a handful of roles in the 1980s, he scored his second biggest role as hospital administrator Norman in D:M, the closest thing the show had to an antagonist.\n\nSince then, he has only appeared on screen on a couple of occasions. Most recently in 2013's The Heat starring Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock. He currently teaches arts and theatre at St Francis High School in California."
