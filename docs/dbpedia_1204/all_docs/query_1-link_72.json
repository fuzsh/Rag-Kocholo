He has one older brother, Christian, and two younger sisters, Stacy and Carrie Beth. He is best-known to audiences as Mark Sloan's (played by Dick Van Dyke) fictional son and police officer partner, Lieutenant Detective Steve Sloan, on \"\", in which fictional relatives were typically played by real-life ones.\n\nBarry's TV debut was as Florian, a violin-toting nine year old in \"The Talented Neighborhood\" episode of the classic \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\". He worked behind the scenes on subsequent ventures of his father's, and has co-starred with him in two series, \"The Van Dyke Show\" (which was cancelled after just five episodes), and \"\", as well as since becoming a star in his own right, building up an extensive filmography. He also wrote and directed several episodes of \"Diagnosis: Murder\". Both inside and outside of work, Barry has a strong relationship with his father. Their close relationship was an asset to \"Diagnosis: Murder\" and continues to be an asset to both men's work today; indeed, after \"Diagnosis: Murder\" ended, Barry appeared in Murder 101, again alongside his father.\n\nBarry's other television work includes appearances in \"Remington Steele\", \"The Love Boat\", \"Magnum P.I.\", \"The Dukes of Hazzard\", \"Galactica 1980\", \"Airwolf\", \"The A-Team\", \"Gun Shy\", and \"The Redd Foxx Show\".\n\nExternal links"
