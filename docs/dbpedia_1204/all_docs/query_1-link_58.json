        "text": "Dick Van Dyke is now 95 years old. Throughout his long life, he's developed quite the legacy, from starring as bank manager Mr. Dawes Senior in the classic musical \"Mary Poppins\" to his popular television show \"The Dick Van Dyke Show.\" You might also recognize the multi-hyphenate talent from his appearances in other classics like \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,\" \"Divorce American Style,\" \"Bye Bye Birdie,\" and \"The Morning After\" along the way. More recently, he has made appearances in \"Diagnosis: Murder,\" \"Night at the Museum,\" and \"Buttons: A Christmas Tale.\"\n\nVan Dyke has done more than just star in films and television shows, however. He is also the proud father of four children: Barry, Stacy, Carrie Beth, and Christian Van Dyke, all born from his first marriage to actress Margie Willet. He has since become a grandfather many times over, and he also counts three great-grandchildren as part of his ever-expanding brood.\n\nDespite the Hollywood actor's full and busy career, Van Dyke never hesitated to make his four children a priority and all four have gone on to build successful careers for themselves as well, per Closer Weekly. Read on to learn more about Van Dyke's brood.\n\nChristian Van Dyke is the eldest of Dick Van Dyke's four children. He is married to Caroline Heller, with whom he had one child, Jessica Van Dyke. Unfortunately, Jessica passed away when she was 13 from Reye's syndrome after taking aspirin for chickenpox, per Glamour Path.\n\nChristian's father served as an inspiration to him when he was growing up and he went on to follow in Dick's footsteps, becoming a child actor. His acting career actually began alongside his father; his first acting gig was in 1961 when he appeared on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show.\" However, Christian eventually decided to move on from acting as he grew older and has since experimented with a variety of career paths, including serving as marketing director for Nike USA and Nike's Asia Pacific branch in Hong Kong. He also worked as a district attorney after graduating from the Law School at Arizona State University. Today, Christian owns Songlines Communications.\n\nBarry Van Dyke is Dick Van Dyke's second-born child, and based on his credits, seems like he might be the most like his father. Like his father and brother before him, Barry also enjoyed an acting career, having starred in \"Airwolf,\" \"Galactica,\" \"Gun Shy,\" \"The Redd Foxx Show,\" \"Murder 101,\" and \"A Twist of the Knife,\" among other movies and TV appearances. He is most famously known for his role as Detective Steve Sloan on \"Diagnosis Murder\" where he acted alongside his father. Much like his brother Christian, Barry's acting debut also took place alongside his father in 1962 when he played a role in \"The Talented Neighborhood\" episode of \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" as a nine-year-old violin player named Florian, per IMDb. Barry went on to attend Pierce Junior College in Los Angeles where he majored in Theater Arts.\n\nBarry shares four children with Mary Carey Van Dyke: Taryn, Shane, Carey, and Wes. All four of his children have dabbled in acting, including guest-starring with their father and grandfather on \"Diagnosis Murder.\" Barry is now also a proud grandfather of four.\n\nCarrie Beth and Stacy Van Dyke are Dick Van Dyke's daughters, balancing out the previously male-dominated family. Carrie is Dick Van Dyke's third child and first daughter, and, like her two older brothers, continued in the family business of acting when she was younger. Now, however, she seems to keep her life private and isn't active on social media, which makes it difficult to know if she is still acting.\n\nCarrie was born in 1962 and appeared on \"The New Dick Van Dyke Show\" at the young age of nine. Her part on the show contributed to a net worth now estimated to be $100,000, according to Glamour Path. In 1983, she married English actor Kevin McNally. The couple eventually welcomed two children together, Kristen and Tyler.\n\nStacy wasn't one to be left behind when it came to acting and, like her older sister, appeared in \"The New Dick Van Dyke Show\" in 1971. She continued to act as she grew up, making appearances on the \"Mike Douglas Show\" in 1979 and in the movie \"Diagnosis Murder: Town Without Pity\" in 2002. Like her sister, Stacy seems to prefer to stay out of the limelight and keeps her life private.\n\nAlthough Van Dyke's four children have since left their acting careers behind, the movie star has yet to disappear from the spotlight. Many of his grandchildren reportedly also have dreams of making it big in Hollywood. Looks like we have a Van Dyke Dynasty on our hands!"
