        "text": "By Dave Mason\n\n\"Murder 101: If Wishes Were Horses\": 9 tonight on the Hallmark Channel.\n\nNever mind \"Mary Poppins\" or \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\" Dick Van Dyke, the ultimate song-and-dance man, insists that he's not a professional actor, dancer or singer.\n\n\"I never trained as an actor. I never trained as a dancer. I'm one of those Jimmy Stewart types. I can play myself so well. That's about it,\" Van Dyke said. \"It (acting) should be effortless and natural, or it won't work. It's really about listening and reacting, not performing.\"\n\nVan Dyke, an 81-year-old West Plains, Mo., native, sounded as easygoing and young as ever as he talked on the phone from his home in Malibu, where he lives with his companion of many years, actress and singer Michelle Triola Marvin. \"We sing together for fun,\" he said.\n\nVan Dyke's famous laugh rang throughout the interview. He joked that he was continuing some nepotism with his third \"Murder 101\" movie for the Hallmark Channel. (The first \"Murder 101\" aired in 2006 on the Hallmark Channel.)\n\n\"Murder 101: If Wishes Were Horses,\" which involves the kidnapping of a champion horse at a racetrack, premieres at 9 tonight.\n\nOn the case\n\nVan Dyke, who plays criminology professor Jonathan Maxwell, stars in the films with his son, Barry Van Dyke of Agoura Hills; Barry plays private detective Mike Bryant.\n\n\"My son and I did 10 years of Diagnosis Murder' (from the 1990s to 2001). We just like working together, and retirement was boring me to tears,\" Van Dyke said.\n\n\"They just can't get rid of me. I won't quit,\" he said.\n\nHe added that he chose to be on the Hallmark Channel because it's one of the last networks still showing family entertainment.\n\nTonight's film also stars Shane Van Dyke, Barry's son, as Mike's nephew.\n\nVan Dyke said his character has hearing problems to make him realistic. But he noted that the professor's hearing aid allows him to overhear others plotting evil schemes.\n\nIn real life, Van Dyke's hearing is fine: \"There's nothing wrong with me. I feel great. I'm always exercising. I go to the gym seven days a week. I'm just naturally thin.\"\n\nVan Dyke's history with family shows goes back to the 1960s with \"Mary Poppins\" and \"The Dick Van Dyke Show.\" Van Dyke credited creator Carl Reiner, the writers and the cast for making the latter a ratings hit.\n\n\"Everybody who worked on the show will say it was the best five years of their lives. We made each other laugh,\" Van Dyke said.\n\n\"Most of me was in Rob\" (Petrie, his character on the show), Van Dyke said. \"Carl Reiner in the pilot played Rob, but the network (CBS) told him he wasn't right for the part.\"\n\nVan Dyke, a fan of silent movies, got to do pratfalls and other physical comedy on the series. \"I never did hurt myself,\" he said.\n\nToday, Van Dyke remains busy with the Vantasticks barbershop quartet and helping young performers.\n\nEach spring, he hosts a fundraiser for Ventura County school music programs and ends up singing in them. This year's show in Thousand Oaks emphasized Van Dyke's musicals.\n\n\"Mary Poppins,' Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,' Bye Bye Birdie' — it was a full two-hour show. I didn't really know how many songs I had done,\" he said, laughing.\n\n\"A few years ago, a Camarillo grade school did a full production of Mary Poppins,'\" Van Dyke recalled. He joined the kids onstage for the final song, \"Let's Go Fly a Kite.\"\n\nHis life today\n\nWhen he isn't acting, Van Dyke finds that he can get lost for hours in his hobby: computer-generated images. He puts CGIs of animals into funny scenes.\n\nOthers' CGI work was included in \"Night at the Museum,\" the 2006 comedy in which Van Dyke, Westlake Village actor Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs played retiring janitors at a museum in which animals, statues and dinosaurs come alive at night.\n\n\"He (Rooney) is 86 and just never runs out of energy,\" Van Dyke said.\n\n\"He and Robin Williams (who played Teddy Roosevelt in the film) — you've got to leash them in,\" Van Dyke said, laughing again.\n\nVan Dyke said a \"Museum\" sequel is being discussed, but he doesn't know if he will be in it. He suggested to director Shawn Levy that it be a musical with dancing animals.\n\nSpoken like a true song-and-dance man."
