        "text": "Throwback Thursday: the shows that are long gone but I still can’t shut up about\n\nWhen I was twelve, I discovered Diagnosis Murder. I’d race home every day after school to catch the 5 o’clock double bill on the Hallmark Channel. (All re-runs. It was 2005.) For months it was the best thing I’d ever seen. I recommended it to all my pals and I set a photo of the cast as the desktop background on the family computer.\n\nI remember spending a good ten minutes telling a year 8 classmate the plot of a two-part episode I had found particularly riveting (The One with the Laughing Gas) while she smiled and nodded. It wasn’t until later that I realised she probably didn’t care. Kids don’t watch Diagnosis Murder, see, and I have no idea why. Really, it’s one of a kind.\n\nMainstream medical dramas are often gory, sexy and intense. Crime dramas are similar. So when you combine the two to make a medical/crime drama, you’d expect it to be the goriest, sexiest, most intense thing you’ve ever seen. But no. Really, truly no. Diagnosis Murder is about a group of doctors who, instead of doctoring, run around trying to solve murders with the chief of internal medicine’s police son, getting into all kinds of hilarious scrapes and hijinks. The most gory it gets is a blurred gunshot wound, everyone sports unsexy nineties shoulder pads, and it’s about as intense as a seedless grape. But what remains is a show with a good heart, loveable characters and a perfect ratio of plausible and ridiculous that the whole family can enjoy together.\n\nDiagnosis Murder is a family show in more ways than one. It’s fun and friendly, and even the kids will understand the plots. It also appears to feature the entire guest list of a Van Dyke family reunion.\n\nFirst, obvs., is the Alpha Van Dyke and daddy of the pack, Dick. Dr Mark Sloan, chief of surgery This is essentially his show. (I remain convinced the series would have been just as successful if it consisted of only one actor – Dick Van Dyke – playing all the characters with a selection of wigs and comedy accents. Sadly, this dream remained a dream – it was the nineties and TV green screens weren’t that great back then.)\n\nNext is Beta Van Dyke Barry, a.k.a son on Dick/Lieutenant Steve Sloan. The show mostly resolves around their father-son relationship, which is made even more touching by the fact that they are father and son in real life. Aww! Family of actors! Adorable, but we still have two more layers of hierarchy to get through. Siblings now: Barry’s sister and Dick’s daughter Stacy Van Dyke plays Carol Hilton/Sloan. Dick’s brother and Barry’s uncle Jerry Van Dyke plays, confusingly, Stacy Sloan.\n\nFinally the last layer: children of Barry, grandchildren of Dick, niece and nephews of Stacy, great-niece and nephews of Jerry, and the bottom of the Van Dyke food chain – Carey, Shane, Wes and Taryn. Taryn plays Missy and Maddie, Wes plays Tommy, Doug and, um, Wes, Shane plays Jack, Shane, a different Tommy and (Intern) Alex and Carey plays Craig, Carl, Brendan, Kyle, Terry, Kelso and Billy. This is where Diagnosis Murder regretfully goes from a sweet home-grown series with a family of quirky actors to “sack your casting director because this is now taking the mick”. But, ya know. After the many, many hours spent laughing, gasping and ho-humming at this show I can’t really bring myself to care.\n\nTwenty-one years after it started, Diagnosis Murder is still nothing short of magical. It is to TV what ice cream is to comfort eating. It’s a staple, a must for all ages, and it makes you feel good and satisfied. It really doesn’t matter that many of the crimes are transparent or that one actor plays seven different characters. It’s got cheesy jokes, family drama and an OAP head of surgery that does close-up magic and roller skates through hospital corridors.\n\nWhy fans flat-line without Diagnosis Murder…\n\nThis is the part where I usually talk to fans of the show I’m writing about. We reminisce, share outrage at its cancellation and all have a good laugh. This week, I could find no one outside my family who likes it. No one! Not one single person. The only people who remember Diagnosis Murder are the same people who refuse to acknowledge the internet, it seems. So I’ve had to interview my sister."
