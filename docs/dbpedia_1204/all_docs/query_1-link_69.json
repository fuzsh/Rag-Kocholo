Can't believe he's 80.\n\n0\n\nsva wrote:\n\nDick Van Dyke has a new series, Murder 101, coming to Hallmark next year which sounds like a cracker, Barry will also star.\n\nthat's great news - I really like Dick Van Dyke, it'll be good to see him in something new. Much as I like Diagnosis Murder, it does get a bit much watching the same episodes over and over :rolleyes:\n\nCan't believe he's 80\n\nWoW, didn't realise he was that old, he doesn't seem to age at all. I'd love to meet him and find out if he's as nice in real life as he appears to be on screen.\n\n0\n\nDiagnosis Murder was axed due to poor ratings in the USA. It ran from 1993 - 2001, the last episode being a rip-off of The Blair Witch Project (called 'The Blair Nurse Project'). It's strange that although not popular in the USA, it's still hugely popular among students in the UK.\n\nMuch better than Murder She Wrote, or the Father Dowling Mysteries. Although, I have to say I like Quincy just as much (but BBC don't show that anymore).\n\nMore Info\n\nEdit To Add: Producer/Writer of DM, Lee Goldberg ( :mad: ), still writes Diagnosis Murder novels, which are available from Amazon.\n\n0\n\nI absolutely love Diagnosis Murder, and yes - I am a student! lol.\n\nIt must have got quite good ratings for it to run for 8 years though. What netowrk was it shown on in America?\n\nI seem to recall one episode very well, and I neevr saw the conclution! It was where Community General got blown up at the end! Does anybody have any more informatrion about this episode? It was shown a few years ago and I've never seen it repeated.\n\nI watched a later episode on Hallmark a few weeks ago and I didn't think it was very good - so in a way it's maybe good that it was axed. Jessie and Amanda never featured in it and Mark was only in it for a few scenes. It had that Shane Van Dyke in it, and there was a scene where Grandad, Father and Son were sitting in a diner together, which was quite cool. I noticed the episode was also written by Barry Van Dyke - but the story was terrible, and so was some of the acting.\n\nThe mid-90's episodes were the best! I never really liked the early episodes - I didn't like the doctor or Delores the secretary. The episodes with Jessie and Norman the hospital manager are better.\n\n0\n\nI may be on my own here but I confess to finding Barry Van Dyke lovely!!!! He certainly doesn't look old enough to be a grandfather himself! I love DM but agree that the earlier episodes were better. Glad to here that Dick Van Dyke is coming back. If you get the Biography channel keep an eye out for the one on him as its really good.\n\n0\n\nAdam14 wrote:\n\nIt must have got quite good ratings for it to run for 8 years though.

They did show the conclusion the next day or if the first part was on Friday then the conclusion would've been on the following Monday.\n\nIm not sure how much you'd want me to say without spoiling it. What if they show it again on BBC1 or Hallmark soon?\n\nI think CBS showed it in America. If not, then it was probably syndicated.\n\n0\n\nmarieb wrote:\n\nI may be on my own here but I confess to finding Barry Van Dyke lovely!!!!

I've seen that bio...and could not believe Barry was 54 then! :eek:\n\nLove DM, seen most of them, except the filmy ones. I even taped some of them a long while ago, but must admit they are being taped over with the cricket now. :cool:\n\n0\n\nwow :eek: i thought i would have to keep my thoughts on the lovely Steven Sloane to myself nice to see i am not alone but cant believe how old he is..that family sure do age well.\n\nOk i know its not great tv but its easy watching and fun and i love it\n\nI liked the earlier stuff with the other doctor in it - Jack (scott biao) very cute and i remember him from happy days /joannie loves chachi\n\n*think i best get my coat*\n\n0\n\nDiagnosis Murder is brilliant. It also became self mocking and very tongue in cheek, which was good. There is something endearing about the show, and I enjoyed the way the plots differed slightly (I.E it was not always the same formula like Columbo or Murder She Wrote). Sometimes we saw the killer sometimes we didn't. There were nice twists and not always blindingly obvious. One thing that did shine through was Dick Van Dyke and Barry Van Dyke's affection for each other which provided great chemistry.\n\nThere were a couple of pilot episodes which did not feature the Amanda and Jack we know and love but different actors.\n\n0"
