        "text": "DICK Van Dyke is a much-loved film star, best known for his roles in Bye Bye Birdy, Mary Poppins, and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\n\nOver the years Dick Van Dyke has been wed twice, and is now married to his second wife, celebrity makeup artist and singer Arlene Silver.\n\nWho is Dick Van Dyke's wife?\n\nIn 2012, Dick Van Dyke tied the knot with Arlene Silver, who is 46 years his junior.\n\nShe is known as a make-up artist who has worked on a number of projects in the art department including Carolina, Murder 101, and The Caretaker 3D.\n\nSilver is also a singer in her band Arlene & The Vantastix.\n\nShe regularly posts on her Instagram @bijoubox. and loads numerous fun cat videos to her TikTok account @bijoubelly.\n\nHowever, the couple are sometimes spotted out together in Malibu, and appear at celebrity functions.\n\nShe has said of their relationship: “He is the most perfect human being.\"\n\n\"I've never met anyone so happy, so genuine, so amazing. He's just like a happy pill.”\n\nSilver was by Van Dyke's side when he won a historic Daytime Emmy Award on Friday, June 7, 2024.\n\nVan Dyke, 98, became the oldest actor to be nominated for – and to win – a Daytime Emmy Award for his guest performance on the soap opera series, Days of Our Lives on Peacock.\n\nHe played the role of Timothy Robicheaux, an amnesiac.\n\n“I don’t believe this. I feel like a spy from nighttime television,” he said while accepting the award.\n\n“I’m 98 years old. Can you believe it? This really tops off a lifetime of 80 years in the business.\"\n\n\"If I had known I would have lived this long, I would’ve taken better care of myself,\" he added, to laughs from the audience.\n\nHow did they meet?\n\nArlene and Dick first met in 2006 at the SAG Awards where she had applied Van Dyke's stage make-up and a friendship instantly started.\n\nSilver told the Huffington Post in 2013: “We got along immediately as friends, so it didn’t feel like he was so much older than me.\"\n\nAt the time, Van Dyke was still in a relationship with his longtime partner Michelle Triola Marvin, with whom he had lived with for more than 30 years.\n\nFollowing her tragic passing in 2009 from lung cancer, Silver and Van Dyke then started a relationship and got married a few years later.\n\nIn February 2022, just weeks shy of their 10th wedding anniversary, the couple appeared in a music video together showing off their timeless love.\n\nThe video was a cover of the song Everybody Loves A Lover, performed by Silver's band Arlene & The Vantastix.\n\nThe song was originally performed in 1958 by Doris Day with Frank DeVol & His Orchestra.\n\nDo Arlene and Dick have any children together?\n\nDespite being married for almost a decade, all of Van Dyke's children are from his previous marriage to Margie Willett.\n\nThe couple were married from 1948 until 1984, although they were separated long before they divorced.\n\nWillett died in 2008.\n\nThey had four children together - Christian (born May 13, 1950), Barry (born July 31, 1951), Carrie (born October 18, 1961), and Stacy (born 1963).\n\nAll four have featured in Van Dyke's shows over the years.\n\nActor Barry went on to star alongside his father in Diagnosis Murder, which also featured Dick's grandchildren Shane, Carey, Wes and Taryn.\n\nDick's daughter Stacy also appeared in one episode."
