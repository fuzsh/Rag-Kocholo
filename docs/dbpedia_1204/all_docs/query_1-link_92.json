They tied the knot in 1948 on the radio show, Bride and Groom. While they were together, Margie stayed away from the spotlight while Dyke built his career.\n\nThe couple had problems that weighed on the marriage. Margie was dealing with addiction to prescription drugs while Dyke was dealing with alcohol problems. In 1972, both of them checked into the same rehab facility to get treatment.\n\nDespite doing their best to make the marriage work, the problems only persisted leading to their separation in 1976. They remained separated for close to a decade till 1984 when they finally divorced as result of unspecified reasons.\n\nDyke’s ex-wife kept a low profile after the divorce and she remained unmarried. Margie died in 2008 from pancreatic cancer. While reacting to her death, Van Dyke revealed that he had lost a part of himself despite all the years that have passed after their divorce.\n\nEight years later in 2016, the truth about their divorce came out when his memoir, Keep Moving was released by Weinstein Books. The Bye Bye Birdie actor revealed that he had cheated on Margie with Michelle Triola, his agent’s secretary at the time. The affair led to a long time relationship that lasted for thirty years till Triola’s death in 2009.\n\nArlene Silver(2012-Present)\n\nArlene Silver is a makeup artist and the second wife of the actor. She was born on September 21, 1971, in the Bronx, New York.\n\nAfter the tragic death of his long-term partner of 30 years, many thought the Indiana native would shut his heart forever. Yet this was not the case. Van Dyke soon moved on to Silver, a younger woman whom he met at the Sag Awards in January 2007. Shortly after, he hired her to work on his projects as a makeup artist while maintaining only a professional relationship.\n\nThe Mary Poppins actor started paying romantic attention to Silver during his grief. When they revealed their relationship, there was so much media frenzy about their 46 years age gap. According to Dyke, even his son had doubts about the union but later came around. They tied the knot on February 29, 2012, and have been together since then.\n\nOver the years, the loved-up couple has spared no details about their relationship whether on social media or in interviews. They have also adapted to each other through shared interests such as singing and dancing. Silver is a member of an acapella group formed by her husband. On his part, the 98-year-old father of four revealed that the secret to his staying young is having a younger woman who is half his age. This has been proven true by the couple’s activities. She helped to pick his number during his appearance on The Masked singer.\n\nFor now, the couple has not shown any signs of slowing down making it clear that large age gaps in marriage are nothing but numbers."
