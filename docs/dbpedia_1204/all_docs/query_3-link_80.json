        "text": "Hollywood icon Dick Van Dyke has delighted fans for more than seven decades with his performances.\n\nFrom Chitty Chitty Bang Bang to Mary Poppins, and Diagnosis: Murder to Night At The Museum, the actor has been a part of the lives of generations of fans.\n\nThat's not all, as his children and grandchildren have also followed in his footsteps - with Dick collaborating with them all on and off screen.\n\nREAD MORE: Inside Julie Andrews' childhood – parents' divorce and biological father revelation\n\nHowever away from the limelight, Dick has also experienced heartbreaking losses and terrifying ordeals during his life.\n\nAs part of our Golden Icons series, Daily Star takes a closer look inside the life of one of Hollywood's greats.\n\nHollywood icon\n\nThere is no doubt that Dick Van Dyke is one of the greatest actors of all-time, after featuring in some of the world's most famous TV programmes and films.\n\nThe star has been delighting generations of fans since the late forties, when he first began his entertainment career as a radio DJ for WDAN in Illinois, USA - before making his broadway debut in The Girls Against The Boys in 1959.\n\nAfter winning the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in 1961 for his role in Bye Bye Birdie, he made the transition to TV to star in his own series, The Dick Van Dyke Show until 1966.\n\nIt was during the sixties that he also played two of his most beloved and famous roles, as chimney sweep Bert in 1964's Mary Poppins and inventor Caractacus Potts in 1968's Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\n\nThe star also won a Grammy award alongside Mary Poppins co-star Julie Andrews for their performances in the film, with Dick later appearing in the 2018 sequel Mary Poppins Returns - this time as bank owner Mr Dawes Jr.\n\nAlong with appearances in hit TV series Diagnosis Murder, The Golden Girls and Matlock, as well as Hollywood blockbuster Night At The Museum, the Golden Icon continues to share his talents with the world, more than seven decades since his career began.\n\nIt is no surprise then that the actor is reported to have an estimated net worth of £40.7m ($50m).\n\nReflecting on his life and career, the actor told Closer Magazine: \"My life has been a magnificent indulgence.\n\n\"I've been able to do what I love and share it. Who would want to quit?\"\n\nHorrific accident and terrifying 'attack'\n\nDick was involved in a terrifying accident in 2013 when his car caught fire on a freeway in Los Angeles.\n\nA passerby rescued the actor from the car and Dick was left uninjured, but the car is reported to have burnt down to its frame work.\n\nHowever, the actor made a surprising joke about the harrowing situtation, after posting a photograph of the blackened, completely burnt out car on Twitter, with the caption: \"Used Jag for sale REAL CHEAP!!\"\n\nThat was the not the first brush with death for the actor, with Dick revealing in 2010 that he nearly died after falling asleep on his surfboard and being circled by what he thought to be sharks.\n\nHe told chat show host Craig Ferguson: \"I woke up out of sight of land.\n\n\"I started paddling with the swells and I started seeing fins swimming around me and I thought, 'I’m dead!'\"\n\nHowever, although initially thinking that he was being circled by sharks, the creatures turned out to purpoises, who helped to save his life in the water.\n\nThe star continued: \"They turned out to be porpoises. And they pushed me all the way to shore!\"\n\nMarriage\n\nThroughout his life, Dick has been married twice - with his first nuptials broadcast live on air during the radio programme Bride and Groom.\n\nWhile appearing at the Chapman Park Hotel in Los Angeles, Dick married Marjorie Willett on February 12, 1948 and the couple were welcomed four children together, called Christian, Barry, Stacy and Carrie.\n\nDick also has seven grandchildren.\n\nIt is reported that the couple divorced in 1984 following a long separation period, after Dick fell in love with his agent's secretary Michelle Triola.\n\nWriting in his memoir, My Lucky Life In And Out Of Show Business, Dick said: \"She [Michelle] was easy to talk to, she understood me.\n\n\"I was drawn into a relationship. I was involved with a woman other than my wife. It was unbelievable. I was writhing in guilt. By 1976 I had to do something. I needed to be honest.\"\n\nMarjorie died in 2008 from pancreatic cancer, with Dick saying that following her death, he \"lost a part of myself.\"\n\nHeartbreaking losses\n\nIn 1976, Dick met longtime companion Michelle Triola Marvin, who had worked as a lounge singer and dancer, before becoming his agent's secretary.\n\nFollowing the split from wife Margerie, he and Michelle remained together for more than 30 years, until Michelle's death on October 30, 2009 from lung cancer, at the age of 76 years old.\n\nSpeaking about her death in his memoir, Dick said: \"She spent her last week in a coma.\n\n\"Her doctor said she could still hear, so I sang and talked to her until the hospice nurses told me she was gone.\"\n\nAlong with the heartbreaking deaths of his first wife Margerie and long-term partner Michelle, Dick also experienced further loss when his granddaughter Jessica died from Reyes Syndrome in 1987.\n\nFamous son\n\nA talent for performance certainly runs in the family, as Dick's son Barry Van Dyke is also a famous Hollywood star.\n\nDiagnosis Murder fans regularly saw him and his father act opposite one another as Lieutenant Detective Steve Sloan and Dr. Mark Sloan respectively, between 1993 to 2001.\n\nThat's not all, as Barry has starred in some of the biggest TV series of all time including The Love Boat, Magnum P.I, The Dukes Of Hazzard, The A-Team, Airwolf and Mork and Mindy.\n\nMany of Dick's children and grandchildren, including film producer Shane Van Dyke, have also followed in his footsteps into the entertainment industry - and made guest appearances in Diagnosis: Murder.\n\nBest Life Online also reported that Barry's children Shane and Carey are talented screenwriters, with the two writing 2019's The Silence and the original spec script for Olivia Wilde film, Don't Worry Darling.\n\nStunning wife\n\nAway from the limelight, Dick is married to his stunning wife Arlene Silver, who works as a make-up artist.\n\nThe couple are reported to have met in 2006 at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, before marrying six years later on February 29, 2012.\n\nIn March 2022, Dick and Arlene celebrated their tenth wedding anniversary together - but the actor made a surprising revelation to Closer Weekly when he said he was worried fans would think Arlene was a gold-digger due to their 46-year age gap.\n\nHe gushed about Arlene during the interview, saying: \"We share an attitude. She can go with the flow. She loves to sing and dance, which we do almost every day. She’s just delightful.\"\n\nHowever, he added: \"I thought there would be an outcry about a gold digger marrying an old man, but no one ever took that attitude.\"\n\nArlene also praised her husband during the interview, saying: \"He is the most perfect human being.\n\n\"I’ve never met anyone so happy, so genuine, so amazing. He’s just like a happy pill.\"\n\nFor more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters here.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
