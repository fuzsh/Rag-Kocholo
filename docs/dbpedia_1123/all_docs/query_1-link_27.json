B. Riccioli discussing the appearance of the disk of Jupiter during the years 1630-1664; changes in the Jovian cloud belts as recorded by a variety of observers are a major feature of Riccioliâs discussion.\n\n[From the library of the Dutch Journal of Medicine. Giovanni Battista Morgagni: De sedibus, et causis morborum per anatomen indagatis, 1761].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMolenaar, J C\n\n2001-12-22\n\nThe library of the Vereniging Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde (Dutch Journal of Medicine Association) is a treasure-trove of information for those who wish to study the roots of the identity of the modern doctor. Recently, a book published in 1761 was purchased: De sedibus, et causis morborum per anatomen indagatis was written by Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682-1771) when he was almost eighty years old. This book, in which Morgagni recorded the findings of 700 autopsies and linked them to the complaints of the patients and the symptoms of their diseases, marked the advent of anatomic pathology as a separate medical discipline.\n\n[Organization analysis and health technology assessment: an experiment in San Giovanni Battista University Hospital-Turin].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMinniti, D; ChiadÃ² Piat, S; Barbaro, S; Galzerano, M; Siliquini, R\n\n2010-01-01\n\nRecent Italian laws emphasise Clinical Governance model as a priority for hospitals and Health Technology Assessment as one of the major tools in order to support local and hospital decisions as far as new health technologies are concerned. Our reported experience suggests managing solutions and appraises clinical issues in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and security of new and emerging technologies in order to plan and to create a system according to up to date Health Technology Assessment principles in San Giovanni Battista University Hospital-Turin. Mini-HTA reports have been realised on \"Technology Intelligence\" in prostate cancer treatment, percutaneous implantation of aortic valve prosthesis in high-risk patients with aortic valve disease and experimental Home Radiology project. In addition, 1167 health technologies have been evaluated through a database created ad hoc. 65% of the evaluations have been positive, less than 5% negative and the other 30% have been suspended waiting for deeper assessments. The future perspectives predict the realization of further Mini-HTA reports even through a revision of the managing model used.\n\nGiovanni Battista Morgagni (1682-1771): father of pathologic anatomy and pioneer of modern medicine.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGhosh, Sanjib Kumar\n\n2017-06-01\n\nGiovanni Battista Morgagni (1682-1771) was an Italian anatomist who introduced the anatomo-clinical concept in medicine and established anatomy as the instrument to identify the seat and etiology of any disease. He was professor of anatomy at the prestigious University of Padua for more than 50Â years. His first documented text in anatomy, Adversaria Anatomica was published in three volumes between 1706 and 1719. His accurate anatomical descriptions of human organs enhanced his reputation as the most famous anatomist of Europe during that period. Morgagni published the most important work of his life, the masterpiece in pathologic anatomy, De Sedibus, in 1761. The text is based on his pathologic observations from about 700 autopsy dissections of patients whom he had treated during their lifetime. De Sedibus provides the reader with a precise correlation between the anatomo-pathologic findings at post-mortem and the clinical symptoms of a disease observed during a lifetime. Morgagni's ability to integrate and synthesize information set him apart from his contemporaries, and his anatomo-clinical method was a major breakthrough in the history of medicine as it helped physicians to diagnose a disease, analyse the prognosis of that disease and prepare a management protocol for the same. His achievements led to the emergence of pathologic anatomy as an exact science and with him began modern medicine.\n\nHistory of the early dipteran systematics in Italy: from Lyncei to Battista Grassi.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBaccetti, B\n\n2008-12-01\n\nThis presentation starts with Galileo's discovery of the microscope and the first Lyncei. Giovanni Heckius and Francesco Stelluti demonstrated different kinds of mosquitoes. Later, in Florence, the Academy of Cimento solved the problem of mosquito reproduction with the discoveries of Francesco Redi, Pietro Paolo da Sangallo, Giuseppe Del Papa and Giovanni Maria Lancisi in the 18th century. In 19th century Eugenio Ficalbi reviewed the Italian Culicids. Once Battista Grassi solved the cycle of Anopheles and Plasmodia, further researches followed by Golgi, Celli, Marchiafava, Bastianelli and Bignami, as well as by Roland Ross.\n\nPublishing procedures and cost of books at Ferrara in late sixteenth century\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nValentina Sonzini\n\n2013-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Thanks to some unpublished archival documents â now published in the appendix â it is possible to analyze the issues of Consiliorum by Giovanni Battista Laderchi and of De principibus Atestinis by Giovanni Battista Pigna, both published in Ferrara by Vittorio Baldini. The aim of the writing is to define the cost of the book in Ferrara at the end of the sixteenth century, and to highlight some publishing procedures both in the package of the books, and in the relationship between author and printer.\n\nUnikaalne nÃ¤itus\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\n2001-01-01\n\n25. veebruarini on Ermitaazhis nÃ¤itus \"Jeesuslaps LÃ¤Ã¤ne-Euroopa XV-XVIII sajandi graafikas\", nÃ¤ha saab Rembrandti, Albrecht DÃ¼reri, Albrecht Altdorferi, Henrik Goltsiuse, Pietro del Po, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo jt. tÃ¶id\n\nBerluskoni zakrÃµl grud na kartine / Hendrik Vosman\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nVosman, Hendrik\n\n2008-01-01\n\nItaalia peaminister Silvio Berlusconi lasi oma ametiresidentsis Giovanni Battista Tiepolo maali \"La Verita svelata dal Tempo\" koopial naise palja rinna kinni katta.

Through Giovanni, users are able to apply statistical analysis on many individual gridded global data products across multiple instruments and even inter-compare parameters from more than one instrument. Giovanni currently allows users to select a time window and a region of interest to generate many graphical output types including area plots (time-averaged), time-series (area-averaged), Hovmoller (latitude vs. time, longitude vs. time), and animations for area plots. A number of graphical output types are also available for parameter inter-comparisons. ASCII output is also available for those who want to apply their own analysis software. Using the knowledge gained from Giovanni, a user can minimize the amount of data they need to download while maximizing the amount of relevant content in those data. The design challenges of Giovanni are (1) to successfully balance a simple, intuitive Web interface with the complexity and heterogeneity of our data, (2) to have a simple and flexible configuration so that new data sets and parameters can be added and organized for particular user communities, (3) to be agnostic with respect to the analysis software and graphing software and, (4) scalability. In a short time, the original Giovanni (Giovanni 1) has grown from two instances to eight (Giovanni 2), each tailored for a specific user community. The demand, however, for Giovanni and its capabilities continues to increase and in order to meet those demands, a redesign effort of Giovanni, which we call Giovanni 3, is being undertaken.\n\nExploiting the Capabilities of NASA's Giovanni System for Oceanographic Education\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAcker, James G.; Petrucio, Emil; Leptoukh, Gregory; Shen, Suhung\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe NASA Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) Giovanni system [GES DISC Interactive Online Visualization ANd aNalysis Infrastructure] has significant capabilities for oceanographic education and independent research utilizing ocean color radiometry data products. Giovanni allows Web-based data discovery and basic analyses, and can be used both for guided illustration of a variety of marine processes and phenomena, and for independent research investigations. Giovanni's capabilities are particularly suited for advanced secondary school science and undergraduate (college) education. This presentation will describe a variety of ways that Giovanni can be used for oceanographic education. Auxiliary information resources that can be utilized will also be described. Several testimonies of Giovanni usage for instruction will be provided, and a recent case history of Giovanni utilization for instruction and research at the undergraduate level is highlighted.\n\nAccuracy of Giovanni and Marksim Software Packages for ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nAccuracy of Giovanni and Marksim Software Packages for Generating Daily Rainfall Data in ... using Giovanni software over Marksim, for areas receiving bimodal rainfall regimes similar to ...

Since the satellite era began, data collected from Earth-observing satellites have been widely used in research and applications; however, using satellite-based data sets can still be a challenge to many. To facilitate data access and evaluation, as well as scientific exploration and discovery, the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) has developed Giovanni for a wide range of users around the world. This article describes the latest capabilities of Giovanni with examples, and discusses future plans for this innovative system.\n\nThe Value of Data and Metadata Standardization for Interoperability in Giovanni\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSmit, C.; Hegde, M.; Strub, R. F.; Bryant, K.; Li, A.; Petrenko, M.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nGiovanni (https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/) is a data exploration and visualization tool at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC). It has been around in one form or another for more than 15 years. Giovanni calculates simple statistics and produces 22 different visualizations for more than 1600 geophysical parameters from more than 90 satellite and model products. Giovanni relies on external data format standards to ensure interoperability, including the NetCDF CF Metadata Conventions. Unfortunately, these standards were insufficient to make Giovanni's internal data representation truly simple to use. Finding and working with dimensions can be convoluted with the CF Conventions. Furthermore, the CF Conventions are silent on machine-friendly descriptive metadata such as the parameter's source product and product version. In order to simplify analyzing disparate earth science data parameters in a unified way, we developed Giovanni's internal standard. First, the format standardizes parameter dimensions and variables so they can be easily found. Second, the format adds all the machine-friendly metadata Giovanni needs to present our parameters to users in a consistent and clear manner. At a glance, users can grasp all the pertinent information about parameters both during parameter selection and after visualization. This poster gives examples of how our metadata and data standards, both external and internal, have both simplified our code base and improved our users' experiences.\n\nBassani â Brentner â Villicus: hudebnÃ­ repertoÃ¡r dvou rukopisnÃ½ch sbornÃ­kÅ¯ z piaristickÃ©ho klÃ¡Å¡tera vÂ PodolÃ­nci\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nKapsa, VÃ¡clav\n\n3 /29/, Ä. 2 (2012), s. 195-215 ISSN 1338-2594 R&D Projects: GA ÄR GPP409/12/P953; GA MÅ k(CZ) MEB0810155 Keywords : baroque music * solo motet * arias * cantatas * musical sources * Jan Josef IgnÃ¡c Brentner * Giovanni Battista Bassani Subject RIV: AL - Art, Architecture, Cultural Heritage\n\nRemote Sensing Data Visualization, Fusion and Analysis via Giovanni\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLeptoukh, G.; Zubko, V.; Gopalan, A.; Khayat, M.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWe describe Giovanni, the NASA Goddard developed online visualization and analysis tool that allows users explore various phenomena without learning remote sensing data formats and downloading voluminous data. Using MODIS aerosol data as an example, we formulate an approach to the data fusion for Giovanni to further enrich online multi-sensor remote sensing data comparison and analysis.\n\nGiovanni in the Cloud: Earth Science Data Exploration in Amazon Web Services\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHegde, M.; Petrenko, M.; Smit, C.; Zhang, H.; Pilone, P.; Zasorin, A. A.; Pham, L.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nGiovanni (https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/) is a popular online data exploration tool at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC), providing 22 analysis and visualization services for over 1600 Earth Science data variables. Owing to its popularity, Giovanni has experienced a consistent growth in overall demand, with periodic usage spikes attributed to trainings by education organizations, extensive data analysis in response to natural disasters, preparations for science meetings, etc. Furthermore, the new generation of spaceborne sensors and high resolution models have resulted in an exponential growth in data volume with data distributed across the traditional boundaries of datacenters. Seamless exploration of data (without users having to worry about data center boundaries) has been a key recommendation of the GES DISC User Working Group. These factors have required new strategies for delivering acceptable performance. The cloud-based Giovanni, built on Amazon Web Services (AWS), evaluates (1) AWS native solutions to provide a scalable, serverless architecture; (2) open standards for data storage in the Cloud; (3) a cost model for operations; and (4) end-user performance. Our preliminary findings indicate that the use of serverless architecture has a potential to significantly reduce development and operational cost of Giovanni. The combination of using AWS managed services, storage of data in open standards, and schema-on-read data access strategy simplifies data access and analytics, in addition to making data more accessible to the end users of Giovanni through popular programming languages.\n\nGiuseppe Pasta (1742-1823): protophysician and pioneer of psychological studies in the medical field.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nClerici, Carlo Alfredo; Veneroni, Laura; Poli, Marco\n\n2009-11-01\n\nGiuseppe Pasta was a pioneer of psychological support in physical disease. Born in Bergamo, Italy, he was a cousin of the physician Andrea Pasta who was a pupil of Giovanni Battista Morgagni. Giuseppe's cultural and clinical resources were the teachings of Francesco Redi's medical school in Tuscany. This paper discusses the courage and philosophical tolerance of disease and the etiquette of the physician.\n\nFederated Giovanni: A Distributed Web Service for Analysis and Visualization of Remote Sensing Data\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLynnes, Chris\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe Geospatial Interactive Online Visualization and Analysis Interface (Giovanni) is a popular tool for users of the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) and has been in use for over a decade. It provides a wide variety of algorithms and visualizations to explore large remote sensing datasets without having to download the data and without having to write readers and visualizers for it. Giovanni is now being extended to enable its capabilities at other data centers within the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). This Federated Giovanni will allow four other data centers to add and maintain their data within Giovanni on behalf of their user community. Those data centers are the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC), MODIS Adaptive Processing System (MODAPS), Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG), and Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC). Three tiers are supported: Tier 1 (GES DISC-hosted) gives the remote data center a data management interface to add and maintain data, which are provided through the Giovanni instance at the GES DISC. Tier 2 packages Giovanni up as a virtual machine for distribution to and deployment by the other data centers. Data variables are shared among data centers by sharing documents from the Solr database that underpins Giovanni's data management capabilities. However, each data center maintains their own instance of Giovanni, exposing the variables of most interest to their user community. Tier 3 is a Shared Source model, in which the data centers cooperate to extend the infrastructure by contributing source code.\n\nThe astronomical tables of Giovanni Bianchini\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nChabas, Jose\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis book describes and analyses, for the first time, the astronomical tables of Giovanni Bianchini of Ferrara (d. after 1469), explains their context, inserts them into an astronomical tradition that began in Toledo, and addresses their diffusion.\n\nComplications and challenges associated with polycystic ovary syndrome: current perspectives\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nPalomba, Stefano; Santagni, Susanna; Falbo, Angela; La Sala, Giovanni Battista\n\n2015-01-01\n\nStefano Palomba,1 Susanna Santagni,1 Angela Falbo,1 Giovanni Battista La Sala1,21Unit of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova-Scientific Institute of Treatment and Care (IRCCS), Reggio Emilia, 2Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, ItalyAbstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) represents the most common endocrine dysfunction in fertile women and it is considered a heterogeneous and multifaceted disorder, with multiple re...\n\nGiovanni in the Cloud: Earth Science Data Exploration in Amazon Web Services\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPetrenko, Maksym; Hegde, Mahabal; Smit, Christine; Zhang, Hailiang; Pilone, Paul; Zasorin, Andrey A.; Pham, Long\n\n2017-01-01\n\nGiovanni is an exploration tool at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC), providing 22 analysis and visualization services for over 1600 Earth Science data variables.

This web-based tool facilitates data discovery, exploration and analysis of large amount of global and regional data sets, covering atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric chemistry, hydrology, oceanographic, and land surface. Data analysis functions include Lat-Lon map, time series, scatter plot, correlation map, difference, cross-section, vertical profile, and animation etc. Visualization options enable comparisons of multiple variables and easier refinement. Recently, new features have been developed, such as interactive scatter plots and maps. The performance is also being improved, in some cases by an order of magnitude for certain analysis functions with optimized software. We are working toward merging current Giovanni portals into a single omnibus portal with all variables in one (virtual) location to help users find a variable easily and enhance the intercomparison capability\n\nIntroducing Giovanni Gentile, the \"Philosopher of Fascism\"\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nClayton, Thomas\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis essay aims to introduce Giovanni Gentile to scholars of Gramsci studies broadly and Gramsci-education studies more specifically.

An environment that facilitates such inter-comparison and analysis would be useful for validation of satellite soil moisture retrievals against in situ data and for determining the relationships between different soil moisture products. As part of the NASA Giovanni (Geospatial Interactive Online Visualization ANd aNalysis Infrastructure) family of portals, which has provided users worldwide with a simple but powerful way to explore NASA data, a beta prototype Giovanni Inter-comparison of Soil Moisture Products portal has been developed. A number of soil moisture data products are currently included in the prototype portal. More will be added, based on user requirements and feedback and as resources become available. Two application examples for the portal are provided. The NASA Giovanni Soil Moisture portal is versatile and extensible, with many possible uses, for research and applications, as well as for the education community.\n\nGiovanni Paolo II â lâuomo buono\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nStanisÅaw Wronka\n\n2005-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Lâandare di Giovanni Paolo II alla casa del Padre ha toccato profondamente tutti, credenti e non credenti. Il modo in cui il Papa viveva i suoi ultimi giorni, segnati dalla sofferenza, la sua pasqua dalla morte alla vita in Dio, ha confermato definitivamente la sua grandezza. Agli occhi del mondo Ã¨ sfavillata la sua bella umanitÃ e allo stesso tempo si Ã¨ aperto unenorme e doloroso vuoto. La vicenda dellâuomo rassomiglia aâ¯quella di un albero: si puÃ² valutarne bene la grandezza, salute e posto nel paesaggio solo quando Ã¨ abbattuto. LâumanitÃ del Santo Padre era tutta tessuta dei valori massimi di veritÃ , libertÃ , amore... Il Papa li realizzava con radicalismo e coraggio che perÃ² sapeva unire alla mitezza e rispetto verso gli altri. Questa difficile sintesi testimonia il suo genio morale. Il fondamento dellâumanitÃ di Giovanni Paolo II era la fede in Dio che rafforza le naturali capacitÃ dellâuomo e permette di unire tutti gli elementi della realtÃ umana, inclusa la sofferenza e morte, in un armonioso insieme. Il legame con Dio non lo separava dagli uomini, ma lo apriva ancor di piÃ¹ aâ¯loro. Infatti, accanto aâ¯lui si radunavano sia giovani che adulti ed egli li univa sulla base dei valori che riconosceva. Col passare del tempo, la comunitÃ attorno aâ¯lui aumentava, nel giorno del suo funerale abbracciava pressochÃ© tutto il mondo. CiÃ² dimostra la giustezza dellâantropologia evangelica alla cui luce costruiva tutta la sua vita. I mezzi con cui il Santo Padre foggiava la sua umanitÃ erano semplici, ma esigenti. La fonte della forza e della luce costituiva per lui soprattutto una fervida e costante preghiera, frequente partecipazione ai sacramenti e sistematica meditazione sulla Parola di Dio. Aâ¯queste pratiche religiose univa un solido studio delle diverse materie: letteratura, filosofia, teologia. Con passione perseguiva la veritÃ , voleva raggiungere lâessenza delle cose e fenomeni, trattava le questioni del\n\nTemperature Anomalies from the AIRS Product in Giovanni for the Climate Community\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDing, Feng; Hearty, Thomas J.; Wei, Jennifer; Theobald, Michael; Vollmer, Bruce; Seiler, Edward; Meyer, David\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) mission began with the launch of Aqua in 2002. Over 15 years of AIRS products have been used by the climate research and application communities. The NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC), in collaboration with NASA Sounder Team at JPL, provides processing, archiving, and distribution services for NASA sounders: the present Aqua AIRS mission and the succeeding Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) mission. We generated a Multi-year Monthly Mean and Anomaly product using 14 years of AIRS standard monthly product. The product includes Air Temperature at the Surface and Surface Skin Temperature, both in Ascending/Daytime and Descending/Nighttime mode. The temperature variables and their anomalies are deployed to Giovanni, a Web-based application developed by the GES DISC. Giovanni provides a simple and intuitive way to visualize, analyze, and access vast amounts of Earth science remote sensing data without having to download the data. It is also a powerful tool that stakeholders can use for decision support in planning and preparing for increased climate variability. In this presentation, we demonstrate the functions in Giovanni with use cases employing AIRS Multi-year Monthly Mean and Anomaly variables.\n\nPerformance Comparison of Big Data Analytics With NEXUS and Giovanni\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJacob, J. C.; Huang, T.; Lynnes, C.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nNEXUS is an emerging data-intensive analysis framework developed with a new approach for handling science data that enables large-scale data analysis. It is available through open source. We compare performance of NEXUS and Giovanni for 3 statistics algorithms applied to NASA datasets. Giovanni is a statistics web service at NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs). NEXUS is a cloud-computing environment developed at JPL and built on Apache Solr, Cassandra, and Spark. We compute global time-averaged map, correlation map, and area-averaged time series. The first two algorithms average over time to produce a value for each pixel in a 2-D map. The third algorithm averages spatially to produce a single value for each time step. This talk is our report on benchmark comparison findings that indicate 15x speedup with NEXUS over Giovanni to compute area-averaged time series of daily precipitation rate for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM with 0.25 degree spatial resolution) for the Continental United States over 14 years (2000-2014) with 64-way parallelism and 545 tiles per granule. 16-way parallelism with 16 tiles per granule worked best with NEXUS for computing an 18-year (1998-2015) TRMM daily precipitation global time averaged map (2.5 times speedup) and 18-year global map of correlation between TRMM daily precipitation and TRMM real time daily precipitation (7x speedup). These and other benchmark results will be presented along with key lessons learned in applying the NEXUS tiling approach to big data analytics in the cloud.\n\nOnline Time Series Analysis of Land Products over Asia Monsoon Region via Giovanni\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShen, Suhung; Leptoukh, Gregory G.; Gerasimov, Irina\n\n2011-01-01\n\nTime series analysis is critical to the study of land cover/land use changes and climate. Time series studies at local-to-regional scales require higher spatial resolution, such as 1km or less, data. MODIS land products of 250m to 1km resolution enable such studies. However, such MODIS land data files are distributed in 10ox10o tiles, due to large data volumes. Conducting a time series study requires downloading all tiles that include the study area for the time period of interest, and mosaicking the tiles spatially. This can be an extremely time-consuming process. In support of the Monsoon Asia Integrated Regional Study (MAIRS) program, NASA GES DISC (Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center) has processed MODIS land products at 1 km resolution over the Asia monsoon region (0o-60oN, 60o-150oE) with a common data structure and format. The processed data have been integrated into the Giovanni system (Goddard Interactive Online Visualization ANd aNalysis Infrastructure) that enables users to explore, analyze, and download data over an area and time period of interest easily. Currently, the following regional MODIS land products are available in Giovanni: 8-day 1km land surface temperature and active fire, monthly 1km vegetation index, and yearly 0.05o, 500m land cover types. More data will be added in the near future. By combining atmospheric and oceanic data products in the Giovanni system, it is possible to do further analyses of environmental and climate changes associated with the land, ocean, and atmosphere. This presentation demonstrates exploring land products in the Giovanni system with sample case scenarios.\n\nGiovanni Papini's Judas Iscariot: A study in tendentious fictional ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nL'argomento di questo articolo Ã¨ la costruzione di Giuda Iscariota nella biografia semi romanzata di Giovanni Papini, Storia di Cristo.

The variety of environmental data types has allowed the use of Giovanni for different application areas, such as agriculture, hydrology, and air quality research. The use of Giovanni for researching connections between public health issues and Earths environment and climate, potentially exacerbated by anthropogenic influence, has been increasingly demonstrated. In this communication, the pertinence of several different data parameters to public health will be described. This communication also provides a case study of the use of remote sensing data from Giovanni in assessing the associations between seasonal influenza and meteorological parameters. In this study, logistic regression was employed with precipitation, temperature and specific humidity as predictors. Specific humidity was found to be associated (p 0.05) with influenza activity in both temperate and tropical climate. In the two temperate locations studied, specific humidity was negatively correlated with influenza; conversely, in the three tropical locations, specific humidity was positively correlated with influenza. Influenza prediction using the regression models showed good agreement with the observed data (correlation coefficient of 0.50.83).\n\nVahistatud Sposatot rahastavad SRÃ riikide tulevased presidendikandidaadid / Giovanni Sposato ; interv.

J., III; Theobald, M.; Vollmer, B.; Wei, J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) has been the home of processing, archiving, and distribution services for the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) mission since its launch in 2002 for the global observations of the atmospheric state. Giovanni, a web-based application developed by the GES DISC, provides a simple and intuitive way to visualize, analyze, and access vast amounts of Earth science remote sensing data without having to download the data. Most important variables, including temperature and humidity profiles, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud properties, and trace gases, from version 6 AIRS product are available on Giovanni. The AIRS is an instrument suite comprised of a hyperspectral infrared instrument AIRS and two multichannel microwave instruments, the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB). As the HSB ceased operation in very early stage of AIRS mission, the AIRS project operates two parallel retrieval algorithms: one using both IR and MW measurements (AIRS+AMSU) and the other using only IR measurements (AIRS-only) for the most time of the mission. The AIRS+AMSU product is better and the variables on Giovanni are from it. However, the generation of AIRS+AMSU product has been suspended since the AMSU instrument anomaly occurred in late 2016. To continue exploring up-to-date AIRS observations, the same set of variables from the AIRS-only product are added on Giovanni by the GES DSIC. This will also support the comparison of AIRS-only with AIRS+AMSU retrievals. In the presentation, we will demonstrate the visualization of AIRS-only product and the plots/statistics of comparison with AIRS+AMSU product using Giovanni.\n\nExplore Earth Science Datasets for STEM with the NASA GES DISC Online Visualization and Analysis Tool, Giovanni\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLiu, Z.; Acker, J.; Kempler, S.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center(DISC) is one of twelve NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Data Centers that provide Earth science data, information, and services to users around the world including research and application scientists, students, citizen scientists, etc. The GESDISC is the home (archive) of remote sensing datasets for NASA Precipitation and Hydrology, Atmospheric Composition and Dynamics, etc. To facilitate Earth science data access, the GES DISC has been developing user-friendly data services for users at different levels in different countries.

Don Giovanni, of W.A. Mozart is one of the operas that more audiovisual versions has generated during the centuries XX and XXI, although very few films have finally been taken to the screen. This paper is focused on comparing the audiovisual versions Don Giovanni, by Joseph Losey (1979, and Juan by Kasper Holten (2010. Through a quantitative and qualitative methodology based on content analysis, this research reflects on the degree of intervention exercised by the language and audiovisual format used in the process of reinterpretation of the pre-existing operatic text.\n\nEntrevista con Giovanni Levi\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMonica Oliveira\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available En esta entrevista, Giovanni Levi - como un conocedor del tema de Familia - realiza una importante evaluaciÃ³n sobre el actual estado de las investigaciones realizadas en el Brasil y em el exterior. Con estilo franco, agudo y lucido critica las visiones tradicionales y sus ilusiones ypropone nuevos conceptos y mÃ©todos. La historia de la familia deberÃ­a ceder espacio para el estudio de las redes relacionales o de los mundos relacionales. De la misma forma, la historia cuantitativa deberÃ­a abrir espacio para el estudio de las cualidades. Ya con relaciÃ³n a la historia de las elites, tan estudiada y reproducida en una diversidad de trabajos, que deberÃ­ase mirar en otra perspectiva. Es decir, no mirar a las reglas sociales predeterminadas, sino a los desvÃ­os y a las variaciones. Levi defiende que los historiadores deben trascender a los documentos que se encuentran fÃ¡cilmente y que pueden fortalecer perspectivas deformadas y esequilibradas de la sociedad. Para Ã©l, los historiadores deben esforzarse por estudiar a aquellos grupos que dejaron pocos rastros documentales.

L.; Beaudoing, H. K.; Rodell, M.; Silberstein, D. S.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nGlobal Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has two components: (1) GLDAS-2.0, entirely forced with the Princeton meteorological forcing data and (2) GLDAS-2.1, forced with a combination of model and observation-based data sets. GLDAS-2.0 data from the Noah model have been reprocessed in July 2015 with updated Princeton forcing data and upgraded Land Information System (LIS) software. The temporal coverage of GLDAS 2.0 is extended to 1948 ~ 2012. The reprocessed GLDAS-2.0 data are archived at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC), in self-describing and machine-independent NetCDF format, and can be accessed via HTTP for direct download, OPeNDAP for parameter and spatial subsetting, time aggregation, and format conversion, and Giovanni - Interactive Visualization and Analysis System. The OPeNDAP subsetting is also integrated into Simple Subset Wizard (SSW) for better User Interface and better downloading capability. This presentation describes the main characteristics of GLDAS data, the major improvements of the reprocessed data, and the access to the data. To further facilitate their use, reprocessed GLDAS-2.0 data are integrated into Giovanni, where the data can be easily explored with 17 visualization types, such as Lat-Lon Map and Animation, Time Series, Scatter Plot, and Histogram. This presentation also showcases the main climatology characteristics of 65 years of GLDAS, derived with Giovanni's new capabilities in computing climatology for user-defined time range and visualizing in Lat-Lon Map and Time Series. GLDAS-2.1 is analogous to and will soon replace GLDAS Version 1 (GLDAS-1), covering the time period from 2001 (or 2000 for the 0.25 degree data) to the present, with about a one-month latency. The data are also in NetCDF format and can be accessed via HTTP, OPeNDAP, and Giovanni.\n\n...ove dormono depositati. Towards a history of the Biblioteca Regionale Universitaria in Catania\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSalvina Bosco\n\n2012-07-01\n\nFull Text Available The university library in Catania was founded in 1693, during the re-building of the city after the earthquake. In 1754 Vico Coco was appointed first librarian, afterwards replaced by Vito Maria Amico. In 1757 the collection of Giovan Battista Caruso was acquired, becoming the most important fund of the library. In 1763 Coco was re-integrated in his position, thanks to the intervention of the bishop of Catania, Salvatore Ventimiglia, a strong supporter of the library. In 1784 the collection âVentimilianaâ became part of the university library, under the supervision Giovanni Agostino De Cosmi, although separated from the rest of the collection. The episcopal collection became with the time a point of attraction for the Sicilian erudition, until, in 1818, Francesco Strano published the Catalogo Ragionato of the Ventimiliana. A different fortune had the university collection: for a long time neglected, it was finally systematised by Vito Rapisarda and Giovanni Sardo. Since the Unity of Italy, the university library has had several persons in charge, without finding a definitive structure. In 1893, the Ventimiliana and the University library merged together, sharing a troubled destiny.\n\nRoberto Dapit, La Slavia friulana - BeneÅ¡ka Slovenija.

The effect is particularly evident in vector-borne diseases such as malaria where temperature, precipitation and humidity influence the lifecycle of the pathogens and mosquitoes. Likewise, the transmission of respiratory diseases is also often associated with climatic factors. For example, a recent study showed that low humidity and temperature provides efficient condition for seasonal influenza transmission. Understanding of how environment and climate affect infectious diseases would essentially provide guides to prevent and control the spread of disease. Toward this end, our group has developed models for infectious disease risk such as for malaria, dengue and influenza that are driven by climatic and environmental inputs. Results will be presented, especially those that used TRMM data from GIOVANNI.\n\nStupr e prÃ©.

Cingolani redeems his humble origins with a successful career as a painter and restorer in Rome between 1880 and 1908. Thanks to the relations with prelates and painters of Perugia, close to Pope Leo XIII, the artist fits himself in the papal circles, devoting himself to painting religious and to the portrait. Came into contact with Ludovico Seitz, director of the Vatican Museums, participates in the major restorations in the Borgia apartment, in the chapel Niccolina, in the Vatican Stanze and in the Sistine Chapel. In 1909 he emigrated to Santa Fe, where he worked as a church decorator and portrait painter, devoting himself intensely to teaching: thanks to unpublished documents, especially the correspondence between Cingolani, his daughter Leonilde and the director of the library of Macerata, Giovanni Spadoni, you can learn many details about his life and the Italian and Argentines artistic milieus he frequented. The paper wants to disclose this almost unknown artist, âmigrantâ between Italy and Argentina, highlighting his role of disseminator of European academic tradition in Latin America.\n\n[Darwin versus Marx? Reflections on a book by Giovanni Jervis].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCavallaro, Luigi\n\n2012-01-01\n\nGiovanni Jervis'2002 book Individualismo e cooperazione. Psicologia della politica [Individualism and Cooperation: Psychology of Politics] is the outcome of a critical reflection begun by the author at the end of the 1970s in order to explore the manifestations and the problems of cooperation between individuals, and to identify some \"universal\" psychological factors that could define the role of psychology within politics and constitute an \"objective foundation\" of any human culture. Although Jervis was, so to speak,favoring Darwin against Marx, it is argued that,from his overall reasoning, several of his arguments actually are in favor of the inevitable \"historicity\" of individuals, due to the social conditioning they are subjected since birth: too often certain \"universalistic\" approaches transmit, together with scientific advances (or even without them), well identifiable ideological motives linked to precise and well defined historical and economic interests?\n\nEvaluating background noise: Assessing off-site data from field surveys around the Italic sanctuary of S.

There are likely numerous locations where the establishment of a time-series station would be desirable, but for reasons of funding or logistics, such establishment may not be feasible. An alternative to an operational time-series station is monitoring of sites via remote sensing. In this study, the NASA Giovanni data system is employed to simulate the establishment of two time-series stations near the outflow region of California s Eel River, which carries a high sediment load. Previous time-series analysis of this location (Acker et al. 2009) indicated that remotely-sensed chl a exhibits a statistically significant increasing trend during summer (low flow) months, but no apparent trend during winter (high flow) months. Examination of several newly-available ocean data parameters in Giovanni, including 8-day resolution data, demonstrates the differences in ocean parameter trends at the two locations compared to regionally-averaged time-series. The hypothesis that the increased summer chl a values are related to increasing SST is evaluated, and the signature of the Eel River plume is defined with ocean optical parameters.\n\nMysteries of attraction: Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, astrology and desire.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRutkin, H Darrel\n\n2010-06-01\n\nAlthough in his later years Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494) vehemently rejected astrology, he earlier used it in a variety of ways, but primarily to provide further evidence for positions to which he had arrived by other means. One such early use appears in his commentary on his friend Girolamo Benivieni's love poetry, the Canzone d'amore, of 1486-1487. In the passages discussed here, Pico presents an intensive Platonic natural philosophical analysis based on a deep astrologically informed understanding of human nature as he attempts to explain a perennial question, namely, why one person is attracted to a certain person (or people), and another to others. I will place this discussion of the mysteries of attraction and desire in historical perspective by tracing Pico's changing relationship to astrology during the course of his short but passionate life, and in historiographic perspective by revising Frances Yates's still influential views concerning Pico's contribution to Renaissance thought and his relationship with Marsilio Ficino.\n\nThe Renaissance and the universal surgeon: Giovanni Andrea Della Croce, a master of traumatology.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDi Matteo, Berardo; Tarabella, Vittorio; Filardo, Giuseppe; ViganÃ², Anna; Tomba, Patrizia; Marcacci, Maurilio\n\n2013-12-01\n\nAll the medical knowledge of all time in one book, the universal and perfect manual for the Renaissance surgeon, and the man who wrote it.

It should not come as a surprise that the preliminary instruction issued to nuncio Giovanni Battista Lacellotti to stay especially alert and secure the interest of the Catholic Church in Poland as well as care for Christian affairs during parliamentary sessions acquired particular significance. In early November 1622, by the appointment of cardinal Cosimo de Torres, under Gregory's XV papal brief of 3 December 1622, Antonio Francesco Cirioli became internuncio. A Bolognese by origin, Cirioli was and a Doctor of Laws and from 1621 an auditor of Cosimo de Torres's nunciature (to date completely absent from the literature of the subject. The office of the internuncio in Warsaw, to which he was appointed following his 13-month service as an auditor, was held by Cirioli for as many as twenty-three weeks, i.e. from 19 November 1622 to 29 April 1623.\n\nThe Public and Private Epistolary Practice of Giovanni Querini, Ambassador of the Venetian Republic in Spain (1768-1773\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJavier ANTÃN PELAYO\n\n2014-02-01\n\nFull Text Available This article analyses the letter writing of Giovanni Querini, ambassador of the Republic of Venice in Spain from 1768 to 1772.

As the official university student organization for Catholic Action at that time, the FUCI was led by Giovanni Battista Montini, who later became Pope Paul VI between 1925 and 1933. To date, this organization has been known to have bred most of the Christian Democratic ruling class that governed Italy for almost the entire second half of the XX century. Nevertheless, this and other processes with similar historical value have been left out of the books. This paper intends to contribute to filling such gap and focus on the theological elaboration of the FUCI.

D., Jr.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThis paper proposes a comprehensive incremental program, Lunar Limb Observatory (LLO), for a return to the Moon, beginning with robotic missions and ending with a permanent lunar settlement. Several recent technological developments make such a program both affordable and scientifically valuable: robotic telescopes, the Internet, light-weight telescopes, shared- autonomy/predictive graphics telerobotic devices, and optical interferometry systems. Reasons for focussing new NASA programs on the Moon include public interest, Moon-based astronomy, renewed lunar exploration, lunar resources (especially helium-3), technological stimulus, accessibility of the Moon (compared to any planet), and dispersal of the human species to counter predictable natural catastrophes, asteroidal or cometary impacts in particular. The proposed Lunar Limb Observatory would be located in the crater Riccioli, with auxiliary robotic telescopes in M. Smythii and at the North and South Poles. The first phase of the program, after site certification, would be a series of 5 Delta-launched telerobotic missions to Riccioli (or Grimaldi if Riccioli proves unsuitable), emplacing robotic telescopes and carrying out surface exploration. The next phase would be 7 Delta-launched telerobotic missions to M. Smythii (2 missions), the South Pole (3 missions), and the North Pole (2 missions), emplacing robotic telescopes to provide continuous all-sky coverage. Lunar base establishment would begin with two unmanned Shuttle/Fitan-Centaur missions to Riccioli, for shelter emplacement, followed by the first manned return, also using the Shuttle/Fitan-Centaur mode. The main LLO at Riccioli would then be permanently or periodically inhabited, for surface exploration, telerobotic rover and telescope operation and maintenance, and support of Earth-based student projects. The LLO would evolve into a permanent human settlement, serving, among other functions, as a test area and staging base for the exploration\n\nGiovanni Domenico Cassini a modern astronomer in the 17th century\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nBernardi, Gabriella\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis book offers a fascinating account of the life and scientific achievements of Giovanni Domenico Cassini, or Cassini I, the most famous astronomer of his time, who is remembered today especially for his observations of the rings and satellites of Saturn and his earlier construction of the great meridian line in the Basilica of San Petronio in Bologna. The various stages of his life are recounted in an engaging style, from his early childhood in Perinaldo and his time at the famous Jesuit College in Genoa, to his later experiences in Bologna and Paris. The emphasis, however, is on the scientific side of his life. The book explores his impressive body of work in diverse fields while also drawing attention to the international character of his endeavors, the rigor of his research, and his outstanding management skills, which combined to make him an early embodiment of the âEuropean scientist.â It was also these abilities that gained him the attention of the most powerfu l king in Europe, Louis XIV of Fran...\n\nA great enigma of the Italian Renaissance: paleopathological study on the death of Giovanni dalle Bande Nere (1498-1526) and historical relevance of a leg amputation.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFornaciari, Gino; Bartolozzi, Pietro; Bartolozzi, Carlo; Rossi, Barbara; Menchi, Ilario; Piccioli, Andrea\n\n2014-09-10\n\nThe Medici project consisted in archeological and paleopathological researches on some members of the great dynasty of the Italian Renaissance. The remains of Giovanni de' Medici, so-called \"dalle Bande Nere\" (ForlÃ¬ 1498- Mantua 1526) have not been investigated yet. The enigma of the fatal injury and leg amputation of the famous Captain excited curiosity of paleopathologists, medical scientists and Italian Society of Orthopedic and Traumatology which contributed to realize the project of exhumation and study of his skeletal remains. The aim of the study is to report the first anthropological and paleopathological results. The tomb of Giovanni and his wife Maria Salviati was explored and the skeletal remains were investigated. Anthropological and paleopathological examination defined: age at death, physical constitution and activity, skeletal diseases. The bones of the leg were studied macroscopically, under stereoscopic microscope, at X-ray and CT scans to detect type of injury and level of amputation. The skeleton and muscular insertions of Giovanni revealed a young-adult and vigorous man, subjected to stresses of military activity since adolescence. Right tibia was amputated below the proximal half of diaphysis leaving long tibio-fibular stumps with a horizontal cut only at the lateral portion. Thus, the surgeon limited to complete the traumatic hemi-amputation. Amputation in the Sixteenth Century technically consisted in guillotine incisions below the knee using crescent shaped knife and bony saw, usually leaving a quite long tibial stump. Amputations in the Sixteenth Century were contaminated and grossly performed not providing vascular binding nor wound closure. The surgeon performed the procedure in conformity with surgical knowledge of that period.\n\nGiovanni Degli Alessandri: i primi anni del direttorato agli Uffizi fra nuovi e vecchi ruoli\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChiara Pasquinelli\n\n2011-11-01\n\nFull Text Available La figura di Giovanni Degli Alessandri (1765-1830, presidente dellâAccademia di Belle Arti di Firenze e direttore degli Uffizi tra gli anni napoleonici e la Restaurazione di Ferdinando III dâAsburgo-Lorena, Ã¨ quella di un personaggio chiave nella politica artistica fiorentina, e toscana piÃ¹ in generale.

Reifer\n\n2015-08-01\n\nFull Text Available One of the more telling features of the present conjuncture is the scarcity of analysis able to squarely place todayÂs global turbulence and the current crises in geohistorical perspective. In terms of the longue duree of capitalism since its late medieval and early modern origins right up to the present, arguably no intellectual has developed a more formidable analysis of the present crisis than Giovanni Arrighi. Arrighi of course, along with Immanuel Wallerstein (1974, 1980, 1989 and the late Terence Hopkins, was one of the originators and foremost proponents of the world-systems perspective on European domination, global capitalism, global income inequalities and ÂdevelopmentÂ (see Arrighi, Hopkins & Wallerstein, 1989. The world-systems perspective itself Â challenging as it did the dominance of post-World War II modernization theory - came out the movements of the 1960s and brought together fruitful synthesis of Marxism, Third World radicalism, and critical currents in social science, from the work of the French Annales school to that of the German historical school (see Goldfrank 2000.\n\n\"Some curious drawings\". Mars through Giovanni Schiaparelli's eyes: between science and fiction.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCanadelli, Elena\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFrom the second half of the 19th century up to the first part of the 20th century the drawings of Mars by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli became the centre of an international controversy concerning the existence of canals and the hypothetical habitability of the red planet. These images also generated a full impact on the popular culture of the time. This essays follows the scientific representations of Mars by Schiaparelli (drawings of discs and maps) from their birth in the hands of the astronomy community up to their growing old in the hands of scientific popularizers such as Camille Flammarion and science fiction writers such as Herbert George Wells. With its seas and canyons Mars turned into the ideal background for scientific and exotic romanticism, offering a suitable setting for novels and tales. The core question crossed paths with the contemporary early 20th century debate raging on about the evolutionary theory. The study of Mars moved from astronomy to extraterrestrial physiology, biology, meteorology and geography: astronomical images then became imaginary portraits of Martians and artificial Martian landscapes.\n\nHydrology Research with the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) Datasets at the NASA GES DISC Using Giovanni\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMocko, David M.; Rui, Hualan; Acker, James G.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) is a collaboration project between NASA/GSFC, NOAA, Princeton Univ., and the Univ. of Washington. NLDAS has created a surface meteorology dataset using the best-available observations and reanalyses the backbone of this dataset is a gridded precipitation analysis from rain gauges. This dataset is used to drive four separate land-surface models (LSMs) to produce datasets of soil moisture, snow, runoff, and surface fluxes. NLDAS datasets are available hourly and extend from Jan 1979 to near real-time with a typical 4-day lag. The datasets are available at 1/8th-degree over CONUS and portions of Canada and Mexico from 25-53 North. The datasets have been extensively evaluated against observations, and are also used as part of a drought monitor. NLDAS datasets are available from the NASA GES DISC and can be accessed via ftp, GDS, Mirador, and Giovanni. GES DISC news articles were published showing figures from the heat wave of 2011, Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Lee, and the low-snow winter of 2011-2012. For this presentation, Giovanni-generated figures using NLDAS data from the derecho across the U.S. Midwest and Mid-Atlantic will be presented. Also, similar figures will be presented from the landfall of Hurricane Isaac and the before-and-after drought conditions of the path of the tropical moisture into the central states of the U.S. Updates on future products and datasets from the NLDAS project will also be introduced.\n\nUsing NASA DICCE GIOVANNI to Prepare Pre-service STEM Teachers to Teach Climate Science\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDorsey, W. C.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe Deep Horizon oil spill incident on April 20, 2010 potentially compromised the Gulf Coast's ecosystem and human health through the marine food chain. One of the mitigation strategies to impede oil migration to the Gulf Coast's shorelines was to burn off crude oil, which resulted in the production of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions such as, benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, and benzo[b]fluoranthene compounds. Noticeable high deaths of marine animals and a decline in phytoplankton productivity have been linked to PAH- and dispersant-toxicity. Phytoplankton plays a pivotal role in natural food chains, production of O2, and capture of CO2. Grambling State University's Water Quality Management students used the University of New Hampshire's Student Climate Data website and the NASA DICCE data portal in learning activities to understand impacts of spill mitigation on chlorophyll a concentrations. Students used NASA Giovanni data and spectral satellite images to examine phytoplankton productivity around coastal shorelines, including Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the Florida pan-handle. Area-averaged time series from Giovanni indicated that June was the peak month for chlorophyll a from 2007 to 2012. Spectral images showed that chlorophyll a concentrations between 2.5-30mg/m3 were widely distributed around the shorelines of Louisiana, Mississippi, and the Florida pan-handle from June 2007 to June 2008. Students then examined chlorophyll a concentrations in April 2010 and May 2010. Data obtained from spectral images by students showed phytoplankton blooms with a 2.5mg/m3 concentration dramatically decreased from that of April 2010. Next students examined phytoplankton productivity from 0.08-30mg/m3 in the month of June for 2010, 2011, and 2012. In June 2010, a pattern of movement in phytoplankton blooms was observed toward southwest Louisiana and Texas shorelines.

Frankâs attention to architectural history dates back to his education at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna, with Carl KÃ¶nig, and the writing of a doctoral thesis on Leon Battista Albertiâs religious buildings in 1910. If a profound knowledge of Albertiâs writings informs Frankâs entire theoretical work, the point discussed here is the parallel between Neues Bauen and Gothic traced by Frank to exclude Neues Bauen from a true modernity, based, on the opposite, on a classical tradition of thought. An attempt is made to reconstruct Frankâs historiographical references and to insert his work in the broader historiographical context, thus highlighting a close link between architectural theory and critique on the one hand and contemporary historiographical constructions on the other.\n\nMito, magia e iconografia. I sortilegi di Medea nelle stampe di Giovanni Antonio Rusconi per le Trasformationi di Lodovico Dolce / Myth, magic and iconography.

Allo stesso modo, nelle xilografie che decorano le edizioni rinascimentali delle Metamorfosi, in particolare in quelle di Giovanni Antonio Rusconi per le Trasformationi di Lodovico Dolce, Medea Ã¨ raffigurata soprattutto come una avvenente maga, che compie i suoi sortilegi per amore o per vendetta. Specialmente nella stampa con Il ringiovanimento di Esone, Rusconi mescola i connotati della maga rinascimentale e quelli della strega nordica: Medea Ã¨ ancora unâattraente e giovane donna, ma compie oramai operazioni magiche al limite della fattucchieria. Â Even though after the famous tragedy of Euripides literary and iconographic sources represent Medea mainly as infanticide mother, the Medea of the Ovidâs Metamorphoses is above all a powerful sorceress: a wise expert of grasses, by which she prepares effective magic potions, and a skilled manipulator of prodigious recipes, that she activates thanks to the help of hellish divinities, invoked with vocal formulas in her nighttime rites. In the same way, in the woodcuts that decorate the Renaissance editions of the Metamorphoses, particularly in those of Giovanni Antonio Rusconi for the Lodovico Dolceâs Trasformationi, Medea is represented above all as a good-looking sorceress, that executes her sorceries for love or for revenge. Especially in the woodcut with The rejuvenation of Esone, Rusconi combines the characteristics of the Renaissance sorceress with those of the Northern witch: Medea is still an attractive and young woman, but she carry out, by now\n\nThe correspondence of Giovanni Santini and Giuseppe Lorenzoni, directors of the Astronomical Observatory of Padua in the 19th century\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLuisa Pigatto\n\n2009-06-01\n\nFull Text Available\n\nGiovanni Santini was appointed director of the Astronomical Observatory of Padova from 1817 to 1877. His scientificÂ correspondence covers a period from 1807 to 1874. Most of the letters are from Italian and European astronomers,Â mainly concerning astronomical subjects. In actual fact, all Santiniâs activity was devoted to the classicalÂ astronomy, mainly to the new comets and planets orbit calculation, as far as to the compilation of a catalogueÂ of almost ten thousand stars. From 1821 to 1828, he was involved in geodetic observations in order to determineÂ the difference of longitude between Milan-Padua and Padua-Fiume. Giuseppe Lorenzoni was appointedÂ director after Santiniâs death, from 1877 to 1913. Since 1873, he took part in the Italian Geodetic CommissionÂ to which he devoted almost all his scientific activity. Lorenzoniâs scientific correspondence was partly lostÂ for war reasons.
