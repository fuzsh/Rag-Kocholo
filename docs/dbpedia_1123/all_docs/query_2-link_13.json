It’s just a bit skewed, a bit removed from the norm, and one gets the sense that Sweden likes being that way. For travellers, too, it’s a delight to visit somewhere that, while it may not look terribly outlandish, still feels distinctly and wonderfully foreign. This sense of strangeness is partly a result of Sweden’s out-there position on the map. But there’s more at work than geographical isolation. Sweden’s FAST FACTS literature and cinema favour a weighty, Gothic sense of drama blended Population: 9.1 million with gallows humor and stark aesthetics – all of which, in some form, GDP (2007 estimate): at some point, will confront the visitor. For instance, it’s hard not to see US$300.2 billion; per something faintly hilarious, yet also quite lonely and sad, in the image of a capita US$41,100 single reindeer wandering crookedly along an all-but-abandoned Lappland Inflation: 0.9% highway in the murk of a winter afternoon. There’s also something poign- ant about a capital city that’s so far from the middle of anything, yet is so Unemployment: 2.5% determined to be the centre of everything. Regardless of how it presents Labour force (2008 itself, the visitor will notice a particular tone in Sweden that hints at many estimate): 4.4 million things: depth of feeling, awareness of doom, absence of sentimentality, Literacy rate: 99% strength of principle, avoidance of conflict, a somber conviction that cer- tain things simply matter. Of course, such intangibles won’t likely make it into your post-trip slide show, but nevertheless the mysterious Swedish sensibility enhances every aspect of a traveller’s experience. It’s an exciting time to visit Sweden, too – the small country with its long history of consistent moderation just happens to be in the middle of a whirlwind of change. Swedish music, fashion, film, art and food couldn’t be more vibrant, and it’s even shaking things up in the often rather stolid world of politics. Don’t miss the chance to get in while it’s hot.\n\n2. © Lonely Planet Publications 16 Getting Started Travel in Sweden is extremely easy, and a bit of advance planning can help smooth over any rough patches. Historically an expensive place to travel, it’s now more or less in line with the UK in terms of cost. Still, booking ahead for accommodation and transport within the country will help save money, and look into discount travel cards for the major cities before you leave (see p322). Once you arrive, you will find the cities easy to get around and well serviced by public transport, with almost everywhere wheelchair-accessible. WHEN TO GO Despite its north European location, Sweden isn’t as cold as you might expect. The south has a year-round temperate climate and summer can be quite See Climate Charts (p320) warm in the north. Sweden is at its best during summer and autumn (late for more information. May to September), but hikers and campers may wish to avoid the peak of the mosquito season (June and July). Due to the country’s high latitude, daylight hours are long in summer. Malmö gets 17½ hours of daylight at midsummer, and Sundsvall has constant light during the second half of June, but you have to travel north of the Arctic Circle to experience the true ‘midnight sun’: in Kiruna, the sun remains above the horizon for 45 days (31 May to 14 July). Swedes are big on holidays, and even Stockholm shuts down for two or three days around Christmas and Midsummer, so plan accordingly. Most Swedes take their holidays from late June to mid-August, so hostels are crowded, but this is also when most hotels offer discounts of up to 50%. Loners and misanthropes should travel between seasons, in May or early June, when everything is closed and no one’s about. Travel in winter is somewhat restricted and requires some planning as well as serious winter clothing, but there are good opportunities for activities like skiing, dogsledding and snowmobiling. The big cities are in full swing all HOW MUCH? year, but the smaller towns almost go into hibernation when the temperatures 0.7L bottle of Swedish begin to drop. The notable exceptions are the popular ski resort towns like brännvin (vodka) Skr225 Åre and Jukkasjärvi (home to the Ice Hotel).

Staying in hostels, making your own breakfast, eating the daily special for lunch, and picking up supermarket items for dinner will probably cost you Skr450 per day. The cheapest way to visit Sweden is to camp in the woods for free, eat supermarket food, hitchhike or cycle to get around, and visit only the attractions that have free admission – this will cost less than Skr200 per day, depending on your supermarket choices. If you stay in com- mercial camping grounds and prepare your own meals you can squeak by on around Skr300 per person per day. If there are a few of you, sharing car rental for a weekend in order to see some out-of-the-way places is worth considering (some petrol stations offer small cars for as little as Skr300 per day). Self-service pumps that take banknotes or credit cards are slightly cheaper, though many won’t accept foreign credit cards without a PIN code.\n\n3. lonelyplanet.com G E T T I N G S TA R T E D • • T r a v e l l i n g R e s p o n s i b l y 17 DON’T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT… Your ID, passport and visa (if applicable) Industrial-strength mosquito repellent in summer Good walking shoes Layers of warm clothing, just in case A swimsuit – again, just in case Sunglasses – when the sun does shine, it’s bright A map of Stockholm’s tunnelbana (metro) A taste for pickled fish A fast-acting liver for snaps (Swedish liquor) TRAVELLING RESPONSIBLY Sweden makes it easy to be a responsible traveller: recycling, for example, is practically effortless, as bins and sorting instructions are everywhere, from inside hotel rooms to near highway rest stops. There’s a high level of general environmental consciousness in the country. Two organisations that set standards for labelling products as ecologically sound are the food- focused KRAV (www.krav.se), a member of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements, and Swan (www.svanen.nu), which has a wider scope and certifies entire hotels and hostels. Aside from environmental concerns, one of Sweden’s biggest challenges is protecting the cultural heritage of the Sami people. The two issues are closely linked: the harnessing of rivers for hydroelectric power can have massive (negative) impact on what has historically been Sami territory, whether by flooding reindeer feeding grounds or by diverting water and drying up river valleys. In general, the mining, forestry and space industries have wreaked havoc on Sami homelands. Travellers interested in learning more and experienc- ing Sami culture are encouraged to look for the ‘Naturens Bäst’ logo, which indicates that an excursion or organisation has been approved by Svenska Ekoturismföreningen (www.ekoturism.org, in Swedish), the country’s first ecotourism regulating body. TRAVEL LITERATURE Good books on travelling or living in Sweden are few and far between. Mary Wollstonecraft’s A Short Residence in Sweden, Norway and Denmark records the pioneering feminist author’s journey to Scandinavia in 1795 in search of happiness. It’s a classic of early English Romanticism and well worth a read. The always hilarious Bill Bryson had an entertainingly difficult time of it in Sweden, as described in two chapters of his European travel book Neither Here Nor There. There are also a couple of good views of Sweden from within, includ- ing Selma Lagerlöf’s The Wonderful Adventures of Nils. This creative account of the country’s history and geography is still taught in Swedish classrooms. Get a taste of a thematic journey in the remotest parts of northern Sweden in Torgny Lindgren’s wonderful novel Hash. Two odd characters set off on a motorcycle in search of the perfect, life-altering pot of hash (pölsan), a sort of potted-meat dish traditionally prepared in the rural north.\n\n4. © Lonely Planet Publications 18 G E T T I N G S TA R T E D • • I n t e r n e t R e s o u r c e s lonelyplanet.com TOP 10 MUST-READ BOOKS BY SWEDISH AUTHORS One of the best ways to get inside the collective mind of a country is to read its top authors. Following is a selection of some of the greatest and most popular works by Swedish authors. The Long Ships (1954) by Frans Gunnar The Emigrants series (1949–59) by Wilhelm Bengtsson Moberg The Wonderful Adventures of Nils (1906–07) Faceless Killers (1989) by Henning Mankell by Selma Lagerlöf Marking (1963–64) by Dag Hammarskjöld Pippi Longstocking (1945) by Astrid Röda Rummet (1879) by August Strindberg Lindgren Merab’s Beauty (1982) by Torgny The Evil (1981) by Jan Guillou Lindgren Hash (2004) by Torgny Lindgren FEEL-BAD FILMS The Swedish film industry is active and varied (see p41), but most people associate it with the godfather of gloom, Ingmar Bergman. Many filmmakers have followed in his grim footsteps, including these: Songs from the Second Floor (2000), Roy Darling (2007), Johan Kling – harsh Andersson – a post-apocalyptic urban economic realities bring together a nightmare in surreal slow motion; it’s not shallow, privileged party girl and a sweet for everyone. old man in an unlikely friendship.

Alfredson – an excellent, stylish, restrained Ondskan (Evil; 2003), Mikael Håfström – take on the horror-film genre that gets at violence at a boys’ boarding school. what it’s like to be a lonely preteen in a cold, hostile world. Zozo (2005), Josef Fares – a Lebanese orphan makes his way to Sweden alone, then has culture shock. INTERNET RESOURCES Many Swedish towns and organisations have websites in both Swedish and English (although the English pages are often less detailed). Hotels, restau- rants and museums throughout the country can also frequently be found online. The following websites are useful for pre-planning: An introduction to the Sami people (www.itv.se/boreale/samieng.htm) A good place to start learning about the indigenous people of northern Sweden and the issues they face, including racism and habitat destruction. Smorgasbord (www.sverigeturism.se/smorgasbord/index.html) A comprehensive website devoted to Swedish culture, industry, history, sports, tourism, environment and more, produced by the nonprofit FÖRST Föreningen Sverigeturism (Swedish Tourism Trade Association).

You can cover those in a couple of days, which leaves an evening for enjoying some of the capital city’s nightlife in Södermalm (p81) – try the clubs around Medborgarplatsen, and bars in the SoFo district. On day three, take a boat tour to the ancient settlement on Birka (p117); it’s an all-day affair. The next day, check out the spectacular cathedral and palace at Uppsala (p242) and delve into early Swedish history via the burial mounds and museum at Gamla Uppsala (p244). Spend the rest of the day exploring the adorable village of Sigtuna (p123), with its old-fashioned buildings, cute cafes and atmospheric church ruins. If you fancy a drive, head over to Göteborg (p206) and explore the Bohuslän Coast (p224) for the last couple of days. Alternatively, you could stay put and sample further from the cultural smörgåsbord that is Stockholm.

Don’t miss the family home of noted Swedish painter Anders Zorn in Mora (p272), the town where the world’s biggest cross-country ski race, Vasaloppet (p19), ends. Tour a copper mine in Falun, home of the World Heritage–listed Falu Kopparbergsgruva (p266). Stop at Örebro (p258) to see the fine castle and to wander through one of Sweden’s most beautiful parks before continuing down through the heart of Sweden to Göteborg (p206). Spend a day or two in Sweden’s engaging second city, making sure you visit its theme park and take time to enjoy the city’s hip cafes and bars, as well as its eclectic museums. Spend the rest of your trip exploring the craggy coastline and picturesque fishing villages of the Bohuslän Coast (p224).

Fly in to Kiruna (p306), stopping to check out the Ice Hotel if the season is right. Take the train toward Narvik and stop at Abisko National Park (p309), a hiker’s paradise. Spend a day or so exploring the wilder- ness, either along the Kungsleden (p60) or via any of the shorter nearby trails in the area. Expert hikers may opt instead to spend their mountaineering time in the more challenging Sarek National Park (p313). From here, head to Gällivare (p311) and catch the historic Inlandsbanan railway to Jokkmokk (p312), home of the world’s best museum of Sami culture, the Ájtte (p312). Continue on the railway through some of the most spectacular scenery in the country, stop- ping, if your schedule allows, at Sorsele (p314), Storuman (p316) and Östersund (p290). From here, rent a car and cruise over to explore the breathtaking scenery of Höga Kusten (High Coast; p287). Continue southward toward Lake Siljan (p268) and the surrounding villages. Stop to see the pre-Viking burial mounds Gamla Uppsala (p244) with a detour to stroll Sweden’s oldest main street in cute Sigtuna (p123) on your way to Stockholm (p67). The wonderful capital city will hold your attention for as many days as you can devote to it. When it’s time to move on, head towards dynamic Göteborg (p206), and Kalmar (p144) with its fantastic Renaissance-era castle. Visit the island town of Karlskrona (p199), which is on the Unesco World Heritage List. Stop and take a deep breath in the beautiful Österlen area (p189). Wrap things up by exploring the vibrant southern towns of Lund (p179) and Malmö (p170), from where it’s a cinch to cross the Öresund bridge (p171) into Copenhagen. There’s a lot of territory to cover in Sweden, but in Abisko Kiruna a full month you Arctic C ircle Gällivare Sarek can see most of its National Park Jokkmokk highlights by following this top- NORWEGIAN SEA Sorsele to-bottom route.

Continue heading northwards and cross the Arctic Circle around Jokkmokk (p312), which is a Sami cultural centre and home to the excellent Ájtte Museum (p312). If the weather’s in your favour, branch off to Kvikkjokk (p312), next- door neighbour to the rugged Sarek National Park (p313). Then push on toward Gällivare (p311) and up to Kiruna (p306). Sweden’s northernmost city is worth some exploring on its own, but it also has a charming neighbour in Jukkasjärvi (see boxed text, p308), home to the famous Ice Hotel. From here, you could dash over to Abisko National Park (p309) for some spectacular and easily acces- sible hiking, or go straight north to the remote village of Karesuando (p306), on the Finnish border. Make your way along the Sweden-Finland border toward Pajala (p305), keeping an eye out for stray Rudolphs – for entertainment, keep a log of the number of reindeer you have to follow at casual trotting speed along a major highway.

Once you’ve sorted your equipment, head north along the waterfront to catch Gotlandsleden, the bicycle trail that circumnavigates the island. Follow it to the grotto at Lummelunda (p166), then continue northward past Stenkyrka and around to the inlet at Kappelshamn. From here it’s an easy morning’s ride to Fårösund, where you can stock up on picnic items and catch the free ferry to the islet of Fårö (p166), home of Ingmar Bergman. There’s a tourist informa- tion centre in Fårö town, near another grocery store and cafe. Take your time circling the islet, stopping at the gravesite of British troops who fought in the Crimean war at Ryssnäs (p166) and at any of the beaches or harbours that strike your fancy. Your goal is to reach Langhammarshammaren (p166) in time to watch the sunset over the eerie rock formations. Afterwards, head back to Fårösund and follow the Gotlandsleden signs southward, stopping for a peek at Bungemuseet (p165). At Slite you can choose to stick to the coastline or head inland through the Kallgateburgs Nature Reserve; the coastal route is lined with pretty beaches, while the inland option passes through pastoral countryside. (The less ambitious can easily loop back to Visby and wrap up their tour at this point.) The paths converge further south to follow along the coast – don’t miss the detour to the Bronze Age cairns at Uggarderojr (p167) – and go through Öja (p167), where there’s a fine church. Then loop around to return through Burgsvik (p167). Around Sandön you’ll have fine views of Lilla Karlsö and Stora Karlsö (p164). Continue along the bike path northward until you’re back in Visby (p158). Make sure you leave time at the end of your trip to enjoy the beautiful medieval city itself. Cycling the STOCKHOLM Gotlandsleden is an ideal way to see the best of this idyllic island, from Nynäshamn sandy beaches to medieval churches.

To start there’s the vast Laponia area (p312) in the north, an entire jour- ney’s worth of territory on its own. Working your way down, there’s Gammelstad church village (p302) in Luleå. Höga Kusten (High Coast; p287) decorates the coast- line from Härnosand to Örnsköldsvik. In Falun there’s the Falu Kopparbergsgruva (p266), and the nearby picnic-friendly Engelsberg Bruk (p257). In the suburbs of Stockholm you’ll find the royal palace and grounds of Drottningholm (p115), plus the unlikely beauty of the Skogskyrkogården cemetery (p85). Also near the capital is the ancient Viking settlement of Birka (p117). Moving south, there’s Tanumshede rock carvings (p224) and the well- preserved naval port of Karlskrona (p199). Off the Luleå coast are the Hanseatic town of Visby (p158) on Laponia Gotland and the agricultural landscape of southern Öland (p157). There’s also the historic Varberg Radio Höga Kusten Station (p238) in Grimeton. Falun ACTIVITIES Stockholm Birka Outdoorsy types are spoilt for choice in Sweden. Tanumshede There’s excellent hiking and camping many of Visby the country’s national parks, especially Abisko Varberg Southern Öland (p309), as well as the more challenging territory Radio Karlskrona Station of Sarek National Park (p313), and the intermedi- ate Padjelantaleden (p62) and Skuleskogen (p288). Closer to Stockholm is the very accessible wilderness of Tyresta (p123). Cycling is another popular activity, and Sweden is well set up for it. The best areas are found in Skåne (p170) and Gotland (p158); see the cycle tour of Gotlandsleden (opposite) for one suggestion. For diving, rock climbing and caving, head south to Kullaberg Nature Reserve (p197). Wintertime brings another batch of activities to the sporting crowd, most notably alpine skiing in resorts such as Åre (p293), Sälen (p274), Hemavan (p315) and Riksgränsen (p310). Cross-country skiing is popular along the hiking trail Kungsleden (p60) and other long-distance tracks. Ice skating is a popular activity for kids and adults alike, and it’s easy to do on the frozen winter surfaces of Kung- strädgården (p86) and other public areas in Björkliden Stockholm. Riksgränsen Abisko National Park Golf is huge in Sweden – there are more than Kungsleden Sarek National Park 400 courses to choose from. The most popular Padjelanta Green Line Course options are in the south, but the quirkier choices Hemavan are up north, including Björkliden (p310), near Abisko – home to the country’s northernmost Åre Skuleskogen National Park course, 240km above the Arctic Circle – and the Green Line Golf Course (p305) at Haparanda, where Sälen Kungsträdgården playing a round means repeatedly crossing the Stockholm Sweden–Finland border.

When hiking through them, she’s constantly on the lookout for tomtes and changelings, green-haired witches and moss-covered trolls (which, to the untrained eye, look just like enormous rocks). Though raised in Colorado, Becky has been a frequent explorer of Sweden since childhood, while visiting her grandparents in Stockholm and her great-aunt in Härnösand. She loves the music of the Swedish language, although she can’t really dance to it. She loves herring and gravlax, Swedish potatoes and aquavit. But mostly she loves getting lost in those forests, among the trolls and tomtes. CRISTIAN BONETTO Stockholm, Southeast Sweden, Southern Sweden, Southwest Sweden Considering his soft spot for blondes, it’s not surprising that Cristian Bonetto calls Sweden his ‘Nordic nirvana’. Despite his many returns, the crush is yet to mellow; nor is his fondness for glögg and Swedish pop. Born and bred in Australia, the reformed TV-soap scribe is smitten with Sweden’s sense of space, its enlightened attitudes and its fascination with the new. Cristian‘s musings on Sweden have appeared in both Australian and UK magazines and he is also the author of Stockholm Encounter. When he’s not scouring Nordic streets for the next big thing, you might find Cristian in his home town of Melbourne, listening to his first ever album, ABBA’s Arrival. Cristian also wrote the Culture and Food & Drink chapters in this guide. LONELY PLANET AUTHORS Why is our travel information the best in the world?
