        "text": "A beautiful lunchtime at a Queensland winery was further enhanced as a Sean Kelly lead Models brought their various musical styles, including the Caribbean feel of Barbados, to Mt. Cotton. An easy introduction to the day's line up, they pleasantly entertained the growing crowd.\n\nThe Church arrived early with the promise of a longer set, which kept the congregation happy for this mass. As a frontman, Steve Kilbey puts in great effort to help lure you away with his gothic vocals to the dark corners where the music lives. The band create an almost epic wall of sound, mostly due to the interplay of Peter Koppes' six-string with Marty Willson-Piper's extra-ordinary psychedelic fret work. The monolithic Reptile lead the way and a feedback laden You Took closed the set from these Australian legends.\n\nDevo look like a mixture of dental hygienists, aging Thunderbirds and party cruise pensioners via their frequent costume changes, as they delivered their unique, spiky, discordant pop. The co-ordinated stage moves and visual smack is evidence of their on going popularity and relevance, their sonic blitz frying some already sun-affected brains. These art rockers have loyal fans, but the message was spreading as it wasnt just the power domes that were nodding through this enjoyable set. The dazzling computer graphics behind them stating \"Are we not men? We are Devo!\" getting the teatime audience fully involved, showing these two sets of brothers can still command a crowd, along with an old age pension.\n\nSimple Minds are not so easily described these days. Much of the public have forgotten the early electronic sound influenced by Bowie, Roxy Music and Neu! When pushed, theyll probably recall the flag waving politicos of the mid eighties. So what do Simple Minds do to stay relevant and, if youre being generous, so popular? They create an amalgam of all you believe them to be, and become an electro rock juggernaut.\n\nEarlier this year the band toured on the back of a five album box set, X5, which contained their first 5 records. The tour was based on 25 songs per night, five from each album. Hardcore fans rejoiced! Fans of the global hits were bemused. But the tour proved a success with fantastic reviews as Simple Minds gained some critical rehabilitation.\n\nThe success of this tour, aside from its uniqueness, was due to the incredible work of keyboard player Andy Gillespie and guitar hero and founding member Charlie Burchill, who reconfigured the back catalogue to inject fresh sonic blood as new flesh was applied to old bones.\n\nThe dramatic intro music plus dimming lights prepared the scene for Simple Minds to launch into Waterfront, the never tiring classic is a call to arms. Its pounding bassline and chiming guitar a green light for the crowd to clap and jump in unison. The throbbing bass becomes a funky groove as Love Song brings back the memories. In 1981, on their first visit to Australia, it was Love Song that set them on the way to their first gold disc, audiences lapping up the bass and rhythmic style so often found in Australias domestic rock scene.\n\nKerrs stage presence has changed over time too, from the tip toeing, precise movements through to stadium kicks and legs apart singing, hes warped the two, creating both subtlety and dynamism for his front man credentials. Even at one point considering swinging the mike by its lead. Perhaps the close proximity of backing singer Sarah Brown kept him in check.\n\nThe band move between the songs very easily, this seamless flow showcases the consideration of how the show has been put together. This Fear Of Gods, a track of towering menace from Empires and Dance, does side step a few people but those who know the catalogue, and the 5×5 ethos, cheer and sing even louder. Its a true highlight, with a response suggesting fans dont wish to wait too long to hear it again.\n\nSee The Lights, with its two guitar breaks, nestles surprisingly well between This Fear and Sanctify Yourself, as the band head back into their stadium glory and crowd singalongs. Kerr encouragingly offers the mike to the participating crowd showing a band at their most persuasive as the audience gathers in their collective hands.\n\nNot only does the music finely interweave, so does the band as a whole. Both Burchill and bass player Ged Grimes know how to work the stage, Charlie Burchill has enough solos and riffs to take the spotlight while Grimes stalks behind the front pair throwing quiet rock poses. Sarah Brown's powerful back up vocals, and some female glamour, occasionally steps forward to show her prowess. Its only poor Mel Gaynor, stuck behind the drum kit, who doesnt get a moment to share with the fans bar his best rock n roll drummer in the world introduction.\n\nAs the la la las from Don't You (Forget About Me) fade, the piston-like intro of New Gold Dream powers into life, a stone cold classic that bridges those early electro years to when the band strode into the stadiums. In its full blown ethereal beauty on a hot summers night, arms are raised to the heavens praising the trance like swirl.\n\nSomeone, Somewhere (In Summertime) opens up the encore of the show, which leans heavily on the New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84) album. Its perfectly themed for an Antipodean summer night, as Kerrs warm, welcoming voice is delivered over a deep, lush soundtrack. This must be what maroon velvet sounds like.\n\nWith its big chorus and towering motif, Alive and Kicking gets Jim trading vocals with Sarah up to a fever pitch, the crowd have no choice but to join in. Ghostdancing, with its frenetic opening guitar riff and rapid-fire vocals revs up the crowd again, and the mid-song inclusion of Gloria gets them singing. But it does, however, slow momentum of the main song, weakening its natural climax. But Simple Minds know how to end a performance, each band member in sync riffing, hitting the keys or drums in true stadium style leading to one big pow, a blaze of lights and then the band taking a bow to raucous applause.\n\nThe positive relationship with the crowd is acknowledgment of Simple Minds who, not only having a loyal following, but have the ability to reign in new fans at the offer of a mike or a searing solo. As the band file off to Roxy Music, Jim stays to take in the view, a sea of the delirious and sunburnt flowing up the hillside. The hot, the sweaty and the hoarse at the front look at each other eyes wide at an energetic finale to a cracking day.\n\nAlexander Tate\n\nAlexander Tale Writes Blog\n\n14th December 2012\n\nDutch record label Now Music and management agency CAT International are proud to present the release of The American, the first single of the extraordinary duo Orlando Wire and Derek Forbes (Simple Minds).\n\nThe American is an original song by Simple Minds (1981), which has been completely re-recorded and re-arranged in the studio.

With his own acts Floor Control, Santen & Young and Re-Phonic, he also produced for major dance labels Blue Records, Digidance, Massive Drive and Mo-Bizz among others.\n\nOwen Paul is best known as the singer, co-writer and producer of the 1980's worldwide smash hit You're my favourite waste of time. He is also a former member of Mike and the Mechanics with Paul Carrack and Mike Rutherford. He has produced two solo albums, and also has the production credit for the multi-million selling Japanese band Buck-Tick.\n\nIt all started when Orlando met Derek during a \"legends\" concert in the Netherlands, where Derek performed with his band XSM (Ex Simple Minds). They started talking and their shared passion of music created mutual respect.\n\nAlthough their genres of music are totally different, they found many parallels in the way they think about music. The time was there to combine forces that resulted in their new founded project:\n\nOrlando Wire & Derek Forbes.\n\nA Musical genre, that joins generations (New-Age & House)\n\nwww.facebook.com/OrlandoWireDerekForbes\n\nSometimes it's the little things that stand out.\n\nLike the security guy at Basel airport excitedly telling his (much younger) colleague all about Simple Minds after spotting my T-shirt before 7 in the morning - while I am trying to stay awake after driving through the night back to the airport and sleeping in the car to be back home in time for breakfast...\n\nOr meeting people in the flesh you only 'know' through the miracle of Facebook down the front - or meeting people who have heard of you from there but you don't know them (very weird!)\n\nI'm writing this on the train from London to Nottingham. It's 10.16am, Saturday September 8. Last night I was very lucky to bag the best view in the house at the Chant du Gros festival in Le Noirmont, Switzerland - right at the front barrier, right in front of Jim.\n\nI've had about 90 minutes sleep. Precisely 14 hours and 23 minutes on Swiss ground cost me more than £200 and will no doubt wipe me out for the weekend now.\n\nAnd if there was another show, somewhere within relatively easy travel time in Europe tonight, then I'd be doing it again in a heartbeat.\n\nWhy do we do it? Because it's not just me.... Because we love the music. Not just because that's a nice melody or a good rhythm or whatever.... For some of us it speaks to us on a level we cannot and dare not try to comprehend.\n\nOf course it helps that it's very good fun! But this is about far more than just mere music for me.\n\nPartly it's the sense of freedom. Going halfway across a continent, meeting people you already know, being allowed to not only hire a car but just drive out of the airport to wherever you want - including last night a return journey through the French mountains and a quick trip into Germany just because I could - nobody tried to stop me. In fact the border was nothing more than bridge over a river.\n\nWe take all that so much for granted - but it really is incredible when you stop to think about it.\n\nThree countries visited in the space of one night. Amazing! And all to hear a collection of songs mostly written at a time when Europe was a broken continent - east and west, borders, passport controls and secret police. That was very much in my lifetime. Back in February, after the Berlin 5X5 gig, I stood with one foot in what was East Germany and one in the west. A little over 20 years ago, that would have got me killed. Now it's a tourist attraction.\n\nEver been asked what was the most important moment in your life? I always answer that it was when one boy met another in a Glasgow sandpit. It's two years before I will be born - but everything has already changed forever.\n\nIt would change again when I first heard Waterfront in 1983. And again on 12 March 1984. Five people I could only consider to be Gods among men took the stage - and as I walked away from De Montfort Hall, Leicester I knew what my life had to become - a musician, a writer (so you can blame the band if you think this is all very pretentious!)\n\nThe music would literally save my life in 2005. And again in 2006.\n\nThat's another story maybe - but the memory of those desperate but ultimately amazing days was with me last night. It felt like the end of a process that began with another mad dash across a European country - Denmark - on my birthday in 2006, to see Simple Minds light up a forest clearing above the tiny village of Nibe.\n\nDriving home the next day, I realised I was crying my heart out to Alive and Kicking (not the best of ideas on the Dartford bridge) as the lyrics finally connected...\n\nWho gonna come and turn the tide?\n\nWhat's it going to take to make a dream survive?\n\nWho's got the touch to calm the storm inside?\n\nDon't say goodbye - in the final seconds who's going to save you?\n\nWhen we got to that point last night I just felt overwhelmed to be there - in totally different circumstances personally.\n\nLast night was my 66th show. It will not be my last. I've racked up 10 gigs this year - and I'm annoyed that I couldn't get it together to do more this summer (although we did go to Alicante only to find the show cancelled!)\n\nBecause when you're confronted by the incredible life force that is 70 Cities or This Fear Of Gods or a revitalised Love Song... Or just the sheer joy of everyone jumping around to the end of Don't You (Forget ABout Me) or Ghostdancing... Then you know you're truly blessed to be in that space, at that moment, with these people.\n\nOnly then does it seem like the most level headed, sensible thing in the world to do this.\n\nIt feels odd to describe a gig as an act of absolution. Of salvation and deliverance. As something that defines you so completely. But that is what a Simple Minds show is - for me at any rate.\n\nOne day, surely, it must and will come to an end. I'll settle for that being a million years from today, if that's ok with you Jim and Charlie!\n\nFor now, let's sign off for this summer by giving thanks to all involved with Simple Minds, past, present (and future) - band, crew and fans, for the truly wondrous thing this is.\n\nBut never forget that, for the love we're feeling for the old stuff this year - as Jim said in an interview a couple of years ago, for Simple Minds the best is yet to come...\n\nMartin Valentine\n\nO2 Academy Birmingham 24/2/12\n\nWhere shall I start? Seeing that I hadnt heard of Simple Minds until late 83 I had my work cut out to catch up with the back catalogue which thankfully only took a couple of years. Did I like what I heard? You bet I did! Did I have the chance to hear those songs in all their glory in the last 28 years? No. Well, I had heard some of the usual suspects at previous gigs, but about 80? was new to my ears till tonight.\n\nEven as joined I the queue three hours before the doors opened I had the feeling that history was going to repeat itself. Why? Because it started raining! Only slightly, but it did. Though this time round there was a roof over our heads. The warm-up music covered nearly every original covered by the Minds over the years setting the mood nicely. By 7:15 time I strained my ears trying to discern the intro into the first part of the main set, thinking \"please, dont make me wait any longer\".\n\nThe guys eventually came on stage and without further ado kick-started the evening with I Travel (yep, been there, done that, will do a lot more of it this year), followed by 30 Frames A Second (going through that feeling right now, thanks to my dad for reminding me how it feels to be over 40). And the songs kept coming. I cant for my life remember which order they came in as I mentally ticked each one off my wish list and tried to take it all in: the lighting, the music and the all-round good atmosphere permeating the venue, while at the same time trying to remember the lyrics and sing along. Not easy. Finally the moment everyone had been waiting for arrived in the shape of Pleasantly Disturbed and the appearance of Charlies violin. Short but sweet, those few minutes are certainly worth looking out for and store in your memory, if youre lucky to be at the forthcoming gigs. Room, one of my favs, ended the first part to great applause. Time for a break.\n\nOh great, the organisers did anticipate the crowds need for refreshment, handing out free cups of water to the fans in the first couple of rows and we got a costume change! Gone is Jims black & white retro Empires & Dance T-shirt, having been replaced by the white & black version of the same. The American started the second half off, with the whole venue singing along whole-heartedly, following through with In Trance As Mission, another tick on my wish list. More favourites followed in rapid succession (again, cant recall the order, where is the set list?) but by now I was floating well above Cloud 9. Bring on the possible (?) future release of the 5x5 repertoire! Someone Somewhere (In Summertime) did finish this part though, that much I do remember. Throughout Jim was giving his best showman impression, darting as usual from one side of the stage to the other, mouthing thank yous to everyone in the audience, at one point tangling the mike cable around Geds mike stand, sending it flying. How it managed to miss Ged Ive got no idea, but no harm was done and the band played on.\n\nEncore time and another T-shirt change for Jim: back to plain back, looking good! But before us girls in the crowd got an eyeful of that, there was only Charlie, Andy, Mel and Ged ploughing through Themes For Great Cities. I hadnt been sure how an instrumental would work live; I stand corrected; it was brilliant. Following on we got Someone and Chelsea Girl (again a great sing along between Jim and the crowd and then my No1 fav Glittering Prize, it still makes my heart jump twenty-eight years on from first hearing it. New Gold Dream closed the evening with the most fantastic lighting display. Steve Pollard deserves a pint for that, if not a medal!\n\nNot only does he deserve praise, EVERY ONE of Simple Minds does. If they had a ball so far, I certainly did and most likely the rest of the audience as well from what I gathered from talking to handful of people afterwards, who all had their own stories to tell of how long theyd been Simple Minds fans. And it wasnt just a small sized ball; Im talking one of those balls you roll down the hill in. Just to climb out at the end of the experience completely dizzy but exhilarated. And Im going to it all again next Saturday in Manchester. I must be mad! But it feels great.\n\nClaudia"
