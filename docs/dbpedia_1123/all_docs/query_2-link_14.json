        "text": "I've been to Way out west the last 4 years.\n\nLineup.\n\n2018: Arctic Monkeys (sub Iggy Pop), Kendrick Lamar (sub Fever Ray), Arcade Fire (sub Thåström (Swedish punk legend))\n\n2017: Frank Ocean (sub Migos), Major Lazer (sub The XX), Lana Del Rey (sub Regina Spektor)\n\n2016: Morrissey (sub The Libertines), PJ Harvey (sub Anonhi), Sia (Massive Attack)\n\n2015: Beck (sub Kygo), Pet Shop Boys (sub Florence and the Machine), First Aid Kit (Ellie Gouilding)\n\nIts usually not the Glastonbury headliner-sized acts, except from this year when all three were. If you expect headliners like this year you should not go to WoW. The depth is usually very good and they have a very good track record on booking up-and-coming artists. If you like Primaveras lineup this would be a good alternative.\n\nStay out west is the concept after the festival site closes at 00:00, included in your ticket, with shows all night all over town. However 3-4 of these venues are rather small and to secure a place you have leave 30 min or more before the last act play on the festival site. There is one larger venue, Bananpiren, where you'll always come in.\n\nThere is also other shows and gigs happening in the city that isn't in the official program.\n\nThe Site.\n\nThere are 4 stages at the site, but the 2 main stages are across from each other so there are not any clashes. The other 2 is a tent and a open air 270 degrees dj stage.\n\nThe park where the site is is nice and is typically festival decorated. No arts and randomness like Glastonbury tho.\n\nNo food contains meet (Morrissey was very happy with this ) but its okey, last 2 years a 1-star michelin restaurant have had a pop up restaurant. If you by all means need meet there are a lot of options just 200 meters outside the entrance.\n\nDrinking.\n\nYou are allowed to drink beer at the two smaller stages, but not at the 2 main stages. They have bars with good view (from the side tho) where you can drink. Among our group I think we snuck out 20+ beers from those the bars into the arena, so if you want to drink everywhere its not a problem. A beer, 33 cl, is 6,5 gbp, so its expensive.\n\nBut since it's in a park, and a small part of that park, usually a lot of people sit outside the gates drinking beer bought in the store. If its rainy you just stay in your apartment or hotel and pre party there.. There is also a lot of bars, clubs and hotels organizing pre parties (and after), at their own place or at rooftops, courtyards, parks, etc. _A lot_ is happening in Gothenburg during way out west.\n\nThe Crowd\n\nIt is very \"hipster\"ish, pretentious. Sort of like Coachella reputation, the \"Instagram people and bloggers from Stockholm\" etc.\n\nThe crowd at the main stages are okey but festivals in uk and spain is much better. However at hip hop shows the crowd is as good as it gets.\n\nBut I do think its a fantastic festival, and I will go next year regardless of line up."
