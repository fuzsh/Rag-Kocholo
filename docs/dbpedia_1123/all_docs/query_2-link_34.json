        "text": "Mito, magia e iconografia. I sortilegi di Medea nelle stampe di Giovanni Antonio Rusconi per le Trasformationi di Lodovico Dolce / Myth, magic and iconography. Medeaâs sorceries in the woodcuts by Giovanni Antonio Rusconi for Lodovico Dolceâs âTrasformationiâ\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGiuseppe Capriotti\n\n2013-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Anche se dopo la famosa tragedia di Euripide fonti letterarie e iconografiche rappresentano Medea principalmente come madre infanticida, la Medea delle Metamorfosi di Ovidio Ã¨ soprattutto una potente maga: una sapiente conoscitrice di erbe, con cui sa preparare efficaci pozioni magiche, e unâabile manipolatrice diricette prodigiose, che si attivano grazie allâaiuto di divinitÃ infere, invocate con formule vocali nei suoi riti notturni. Allo stesso modo, nelle xilografie che decorano le edizioni rinascimentali delle Metamorfosi, in particolare in quelle di Giovanni Antonio Rusconi per le Trasformationi di Lodovico Dolce, Medea Ã¨ raffigurata soprattutto come una avvenente maga, che compie i suoi sortilegi per amore o per vendetta. Specialmente nella stampa con Il ringiovanimento di Esone, Rusconi mescola i connotati della maga rinascimentale e quelli della strega nordica: Medea Ã¨ ancora unâattraente e giovane donna, ma compie oramai operazioni magiche al limite della fattucchieria. Â Even though after the famous tragedy of Euripides literary and iconographic sources represent Medea mainly as infanticide mother, the Medea of the Ovidâs Metamorphoses is above all a powerful sorceress: a wise expert of grasses, by which she prepares effective magic potions, and a skilled manipulator of prodigious recipes, that she activates thanks to the help of hellish divinities, invoked with vocal formulas in her nighttime rites. In the same way, in the woodcuts that decorate the Renaissance editions of the Metamorphoses, particularly in those of Giovanni Antonio Rusconi for the Lodovico Dolceâs Trasformationi, Medea is represented above all as a good-looking sorceress, that executes her sorceries for love or for revenge. Especially in the woodcut with The rejuvenation of Esone, Rusconi combines the characteristics of the Renaissance sorceress with those of the Northern witch: Medea is still an attractive and young woman, but she carry out, by now\n\nDrawings for an exacting author: illustrations from Giovanni Antonio Scopoli's \"Deliciae florae et faunae insubricae\".\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSiviero, Monica; Violani, Carlo\n\n2006-01-01\n\nGiovanni Antonio Scopoli (1723-1788) was one of the most versatile naturalists in eighteenth-century Italy. In 1785, Scopoli conceived the ambitious publication, \"Deliciae florae et faunae insubricae\". Appearing in installments, this included descriptions and illustrations of plants, animals and minerals found in northern Italy. Unfortunately, Scopoli's sudden death halted publication of the \"Deliciae\" after its third installment. Recently, a corpus of 98 paintings, in the gouache style, were discovered in the Biblioteca Universitaria of Pavia. These gouaches appear to be the basis for plates planned in future installments of the \"Deliciae\". Marginal notes in Scopoli's handwriting are included. Because Scopoli's plant and animal specimens have been destroyed or dispersed, these drawings are crucial for reconstructing his scientific opus. Combined with other documents, Scopoli's marginal notes also reveal his exacting standards. He criticized the way his artists had poorly rendered the scientific details of the paintings.\n\nGiovanni Degli Alessandri: i primi anni del direttorato agli Uffizi fra nuovi e vecchi ruoli\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChiara Pasquinelli\n\n2011-11-01\n\nFull Text Available La figura di Giovanni Degli Alessandri (1765-1830, presidente dellâAccademia di Belle Arti di Firenze e direttore degli Uffizi tra gli anni napoleonici e la Restaurazione di Ferdinando III dâAsburgo-Lorena, Ã¨ quella di un personaggio chiave nella politica artistica fiorentina, e toscana piÃ¹ in generale. Nel saggio si esaminano i primi anni del suo direttorato alla Galleria, i rapporti con Antonio Canova, il suo ruolo allâinterno dellâentourage di Elisa Baciocchi Bonaparte, oltre a considerare alcuni spunti legati al rinnovamento degli Uffizi, nonchÃ© la delicata vicenda del passaggio in cittÃ di Dominique-Vivant Denon, direttore del Louvre. Lâobbiettivo Ã¨ quello di introdurre elementi di approfondimento relativamente a una figura molto nota ma poco studiata.\n\nOnline Interactive Data Analysis of Multi-Sensor Data Using Giovanni\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBerrick, S.; Leptoukh, G.; Liu, Z.; Rui, H.; Shen, S.; Teng, W.; Zhu, T.\n\n2005-12-01\n\nThe goal of the GES-DISC Interactive Online Visualization and Analysis System (Giovanni) is to provide earth science users a means for performing data analysis on data in the Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) without having to download the data. Through Giovanni, users are able to apply statistical analysis on many individual gridded global data products across multiple instruments and even inter-compare parameters from more than one instrument. Giovanni currently allows users to select a time window and a region of interest to generate many graphical output types including area plots (time-averaged), time-series (area-averaged), Hovmoller (latitude vs. time, longitude vs. time), and animations for area plots. A number of graphical output types are also available for parameter inter-comparisons. ASCII output is also available for those who want to apply their own analysis software. Using the knowledge gained from Giovanni, a user can minimize the amount of data they need to download while maximizing the amount of relevant content in those data. The design challenges of Giovanni are (1) to successfully balance a simple, intuitive Web interface with the complexity and heterogeneity of our data, (2) to have a simple and flexible configuration so that new data sets and parameters can be added and organized for particular user communities, (3) to be agnostic with respect to the analysis software and graphing software and, (4) scalability. In a short time, the original Giovanni (Giovanni 1) has grown from two instances to eight (Giovanni 2), each tailored for a specific user community. The demand, however, for Giovanni and its capabilities continues to increase and in order to meet those demands, a redesign effort of Giovanni, which we call Giovanni 3, is being undertaken.\n\nExploiting the Capabilities of NASA's Giovanni System for Oceanographic Education\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAcker, James G.; Petrucio, Emil; Leptoukh, Gregory; Shen, Suhung\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe NASA Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) Giovanni system [GES DISC Interactive Online Visualization ANd aNalysis Infrastructure] has significant capabilities for oceanographic education and independent research utilizing ocean color radiometry data products. Giovanni allows Web-based data discovery and basic analyses, and can be used both for guided illustration of a variety of marine processes and phenomena, and for independent research investigations. Giovanni's capabilities are particularly suited for advanced secondary school science and undergraduate (college) education. This presentation will describe a variety of ways that Giovanni can be used for oceanographic education. Auxiliary information resources that can be utilized will also be described. Several testimonies of Giovanni usage for instruction will be provided, and a recent case history of Giovanni utilization for instruction and research at the undergraduate level is highlighted.\n\nAccuracy of Giovanni and Marksim Software Packages for ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nAccuracy of Giovanni and Marksim Software Packages for Generating Daily Rainfall Data in ... using Giovanni software over Marksim, for areas receiving bimodal rainfall regimes similar to ... EMAIL FREE FULL TEXT EMAIL FREE FULL TEXT\n\nGiovanni - The Bridge Between Data and Science\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLiu, Zhong; Acker, James\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis article describes new features in the Geospatial Interactive Online Visualization ANd aNalysis Infrastructure (Giovanni), a user-friendly online tool that enables visualization, analysis, and assessment of NASA Earth science data sets without downloading data and software. Since the satellite era began, data collected from Earth-observing satellites have been widely used in research and applications; however, using satellite-based data sets can still be a challenge to many. To facilitate data access and evaluation, as well as scientific exploration and discovery, the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) has developed Giovanni for a wide range of users around the world. This article describes the latest capabilities of Giovanni with examples, and discusses future plans for this innovative system.\n\nThe Value of Data and Metadata Standardization for Interoperability in Giovanni\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSmit, C.; Hegde, M.; Strub, R. F.; Bryant, K.; Li, A.; Petrenko, M.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nGiovanni (https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/) is a data exploration and visualization tool at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC). It has been around in one form or another for more than 15 years. Giovanni calculates simple statistics and produces 22 different visualizations for more than 1600 geophysical parameters from more than 90 satellite and model products. Giovanni relies on external data format standards to ensure interoperability, including the NetCDF CF Metadata Conventions. Unfortunately, these standards were insufficient to make Giovanni's internal data representation truly simple to use. Finding and working with dimensions can be convoluted with the CF Conventions. Furthermore, the CF Conventions are silent on machine-friendly descriptive metadata such as the parameter's source product and product version. In order to simplify analyzing disparate earth science data parameters in a unified way, we developed Giovanni's internal standard. First, the format standardizes parameter dimensions and variables so they can be easily found. Second, the format adds all the machine-friendly metadata Giovanni needs to present our parameters to users in a consistent and clear manner. At a glance, users can grasp all the pertinent information about parameters both during parameter selection and after visualization. This poster gives examples of how our metadata and data standards, both external and internal, have both simplified our code base and improved our users' experiences.\n\nRemote Sensing Data Visualization, Fusion and Analysis via Giovanni\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLeptoukh, G.; Zubko, V.; Gopalan, A.; Khayat, M.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWe describe Giovanni, the NASA Goddard developed online visualization and analysis tool that allows users explore various phenomena without learning remote sensing data formats and downloading voluminous data. Using MODIS aerosol data as an example, we formulate an approach to the data fusion for Giovanni to further enrich online multi-sensor remote sensing data comparison and analysis.\n\nGiovanni in the Cloud: Earth Science Data Exploration in Amazon Web Services\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHegde, M.; Petrenko, M.; Smit, C.; Zhang, H.; Pilone, P.; Zasorin, A. A.; Pham, L.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nGiovanni (https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/) is a popular online data exploration tool at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC), providing 22 analysis and visualization services for over 1600 Earth Science data variables. Owing to its popularity, Giovanni has experienced a consistent growth in overall demand, with periodic usage spikes attributed to trainings by education organizations, extensive data analysis in response to natural disasters, preparations for science meetings, etc. Furthermore, the new generation of spaceborne sensors and high resolution models have resulted in an exponential growth in data volume with data distributed across the traditional boundaries of datacenters. Seamless exploration of data (without users having to worry about data center boundaries) has been a key recommendation of the GES DISC User Working Group. These factors have required new strategies for delivering acceptable performance. The cloud-based Giovanni, built on Amazon Web Services (AWS), evaluates (1) AWS native solutions to provide a scalable, serverless architecture; (2) open standards for data storage in the Cloud; (3) a cost model for operations; and (4) end-user performance. Our preliminary findings indicate that the use of serverless architecture has a potential to significantly reduce development and operational cost of Giovanni. The combination of using AWS managed services, storage of data in open standards, and schema-on-read data access strategy simplifies data access and analytics, in addition to making data more accessible to the end users of Giovanni through popular programming languages.\n\nFederated Giovanni: A Distributed Web Service for Analysis and Visualization of Remote Sensing Data\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLynnes, Chris\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe Geospatial Interactive Online Visualization and Analysis Interface (Giovanni) is a popular tool for users of the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) and has been in use for over a decade. It provides a wide variety of algorithms and visualizations to explore large remote sensing datasets without having to download the data and without having to write readers and visualizers for it. Giovanni is now being extended to enable its capabilities at other data centers within the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). This Federated Giovanni will allow four other data centers to add and maintain their data within Giovanni on behalf of their user community. Those data centers are the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC), MODIS Adaptive Processing System (MODAPS), Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG), and Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC). Three tiers are supported: Tier 1 (GES DISC-hosted) gives the remote data center a data management interface to add and maintain data, which are provided through the Giovanni instance at the GES DISC. Tier 2 packages Giovanni up as a virtual machine for distribution to and deployment by the other data centers. Data variables are shared among data centers by sharing documents from the Solr database that underpins Giovanni's data management capabilities. However, each data center maintains their own instance of Giovanni, exposing the variables of most interest to their user community. Tier 3 is a Shared Source model, in which the data centers cooperate to extend the infrastructure by contributing source code.\n\nThe astronomical tables of Giovanni Bianchini\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nChabas, Jose\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis book describes and analyses, for the first time, the astronomical tables of Giovanni Bianchini of Ferrara (d. after 1469), explains their context, inserts them into an astronomical tradition that began in Toledo, and addresses their diffusion.\n\nGiovanni in the Cloud: Earth Science Data Exploration in Amazon Web Services\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPetrenko, Maksym; Hegde, Mahabal; Smit, Christine; Zhang, Hailiang; Pilone, Paul; Zasorin, Andrey A.; Pham, Long\n\n2017-01-01\n\nGiovanni is an exploration tool at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC), providing 22 analysis and visualization services for over 1600 Earth Science data variables.

CarratÃ¹, delinearono un primo âritrattoâ della personalitÃ di Antonio Mollari. Da quella data Ã¨ poi maturata lâidea di indagare in maniera piÃ¹ adeguata la sua attivitÃ , giungendo al Convegno tenuto allâAbbadia di Fiastra nel 2013. Lâautore mette in evidenza come la figura di Antonio Mollari, al di lÃ del giudizio tecnico che possono esprimere i relatori che si sono succeduti nel Convegno, ha un problema legato alla comunicazione. Chi era Mollari e come potrebbe essere adeguatamente presentato in una riunione di persone non addette ai lavori? Era architetto, ingegnere, tecnico? Oppure, alla bisogna, era lâuna o lâaltra di queste figure? In this report it is narrated that in 2006 the figure of Antonio Mollari was reproposed, after the discovery of five watercolor maps at the municipality of Petriolo, by means of a small exhibition to which Prof. Cruciani Fabozzi gave the right approach. From that date an interest in the idea of a more appropriate and extensive discussion on Antonio Mollari is later gained, reaching the Conference held in the Abbey of Fiastra in 2013. The author highlights how the figure of Antonio Mollari has a problem with the communication, beyond the technical opinion, expressed by the speakers that have taken place in the conference. Who was Mollari and how could he be adequately presented at a meeting of persons not qualified in this matter? It was Architect or Engineer? Or, as needed, was the one or the other of these figures?\n\nGiovanni: The Bridge between Data and Science\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShen, Suhung; Lynnes, Christopher; Kempler, Steven J.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nNASA Giovanni (Goddard Interactive Online Visualization ANd aNalysis Infrastructure) is a web-based remote sensing and model data visualization and analysis system developed by the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC). This web-based tool facilitates data discovery, exploration and analysis of large amount of global and regional data sets, covering atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric chemistry, hydrology, oceanographic, and land surface. Data analysis functions include Lat-Lon map, time series, scatter plot, correlation map, difference, cross-section, vertical profile, and animation etc. Visualization options enable comparisons of multiple variables and easier refinement. Recently, new features have been developed, such as interactive scatter plots and maps. The performance is also being improved, in some cases by an order of magnitude for certain analysis functions with optimized software. We are working toward merging current Giovanni portals into a single omnibus portal with all variables in one (virtual) location to help users find a variable easily and enhance the intercomparison capability\n\nIntroducing Giovanni Gentile, the \"Philosopher of Fascism\"\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nClayton, Thomas\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis essay aims to introduce Giovanni Gentile to scholars of Gramsci studies broadly and Gramsci-education studies more specifically.

An environment that facilitates such inter-comparison and analysis would be useful for validation of satellite soil moisture retrievals against in situ data and for determining the relationships between different soil moisture products. As part of the NASA Giovanni (Geospatial Interactive Online Visualization ANd aNalysis Infrastructure) family of portals, which has provided users worldwide with a simple but powerful way to explore NASA data, a beta prototype Giovanni Inter-comparison of Soil Moisture Products portal has been developed. A number of soil moisture data products are currently included in the prototype portal. More will be added, based on user requirements and feedback and as resources become available. Two application examples for the portal are provided. The NASA Giovanni Soil Moisture portal is versatile and extensible, with many possible uses, for research and applications, as well as for the education community.\n\nGiovanni Paolo II â lâuomo buono\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nStanisÅaw Wronka\n\n2005-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Lâandare di Giovanni Paolo II alla casa del Padre ha toccato profondamente tutti, credenti e non credenti. Il modo in cui il Papa viveva i suoi ultimi giorni, segnati dalla sofferenza, la sua pasqua dalla morte alla vita in Dio, ha confermato definitivamente la sua grandezza. Agli occhi del mondo Ã¨ sfavillata la sua bella umanitÃ e allo stesso tempo si Ã¨ aperto unenorme e doloroso vuoto. La vicenda dellâuomo rassomiglia aâ¯quella di un albero: si puÃ² valutarne bene la grandezza, salute e posto nel paesaggio solo quando Ã¨ abbattuto. LâumanitÃ del Santo Padre era tutta tessuta dei valori massimi di veritÃ , libertÃ , amore... Il Papa li realizzava con radicalismo e coraggio che perÃ² sapeva unire alla mitezza e rispetto verso gli altri. Questa difficile sintesi testimonia il suo genio morale. Il fondamento dellâumanitÃ di Giovanni Paolo II era la fede in Dio che rafforza le naturali capacitÃ dellâuomo e permette di unire tutti gli elementi della realtÃ umana, inclusa la sofferenza e morte, in un armonioso insieme. Il legame con Dio non lo separava dagli uomini, ma lo apriva ancor di piÃ¹ aâ¯loro. Infatti, accanto aâ¯lui si radunavano sia giovani che adulti ed egli li univa sulla base dei valori che riconosceva. Col passare del tempo, la comunitÃ attorno aâ¯lui aumentava, nel giorno del suo funerale abbracciava pressochÃ© tutto il mondo. CiÃ² dimostra la giustezza dellâantropologia evangelica alla cui luce costruiva tutta la sua vita. I mezzi con cui il Santo Padre foggiava la sua umanitÃ erano semplici, ma esigenti. La fonte della forza e della luce costituiva per lui soprattutto una fervida e costante preghiera, frequente partecipazione ai sacramenti e sistematica meditazione sulla Parola di Dio. Aâ¯queste pratiche religiose univa un solido studio delle diverse materie: letteratura, filosofia, teologia. Con passione perseguiva la veritÃ , voleva raggiungere lâessenza delle cose e fenomeni, trattava le questioni del\n\nTemperature Anomalies from the AIRS Product in Giovanni for the Climate Community\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDing, Feng; Hearty, Thomas J.; Wei, Jennifer; Theobald, Michael; Vollmer, Bruce; Seiler, Edward; Meyer, David\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) mission began with the launch of Aqua in 2002. Over 15 years of AIRS products have been used by the climate research and application communities. The NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC), in collaboration with NASA Sounder Team at JPL, provides processing, archiving, and distribution services for NASA sounders: the present Aqua AIRS mission and the succeeding Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) mission. We generated a Multi-year Monthly Mean and Anomaly product using 14 years of AIRS standard monthly product. The product includes Air Temperature at the Surface and Surface Skin Temperature, both in Ascending/Daytime and Descending/Nighttime mode. The temperature variables and their anomalies are deployed to Giovanni, a Web-based application developed by the GES DISC. Giovanni provides a simple and intuitive way to visualize, analyze, and access vast amounts of Earth science remote sensing data without having to download the data. It is also a powerful tool that stakeholders can use for decision support in planning and preparing for increased climate variability. In this presentation, we demonstrate the functions in Giovanni with use cases employing AIRS Multi-year Monthly Mean and Anomaly variables.\n\nPerformance Comparison of Big Data Analytics With NEXUS and Giovanni\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJacob, J. C.; Huang, T.; Lynnes, C.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nNEXUS is an emerging data-intensive analysis framework developed with a new approach for handling science data that enables large-scale data analysis. It is available through open source. We compare performance of NEXUS and Giovanni for 3 statistics algorithms applied to NASA datasets. Giovanni is a statistics web service at NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs). NEXUS is a cloud-computing environment developed at JPL and built on Apache Solr, Cassandra, and Spark. We compute global time-averaged map, correlation map, and area-averaged time series. The first two algorithms average over time to produce a value for each pixel in a 2-D map. The third algorithm averages spatially to produce a single value for each time step. This talk is our report on benchmark comparison findings that indicate 15x speedup with NEXUS over Giovanni to compute area-averaged time series of daily precipitation rate for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM with 0.25 degree spatial resolution) for the Continental United States over 14 years (2000-2014) with 64-way parallelism and 545 tiles per granule. 16-way parallelism with 16 tiles per granule worked best with NEXUS for computing an 18-year (1998-2015) TRMM daily precipitation global time averaged map (2.5 times speedup) and 18-year global map of correlation between TRMM daily precipitation and TRMM real time daily precipitation (7x speedup). These and other benchmark results will be presented along with key lessons learned in applying the NEXUS tiling approach to big data analytics in the cloud.\n\nOnline Time Series Analysis of Land Products over Asia Monsoon Region via Giovanni\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShen, Suhung; Leptoukh, Gregory G.; Gerasimov, Irina\n\n2011-01-01\n\nTime series analysis is critical to the study of land cover/land use changes and climate. Time series studies at local-to-regional scales require higher spatial resolution, such as 1km or less, data. MODIS land products of 250m to 1km resolution enable such studies. However, such MODIS land data files are distributed in 10ox10o tiles, due to large data volumes. Conducting a time series study requires downloading all tiles that include the study area for the time period of interest, and mosaicking the tiles spatially. This can be an extremely time-consuming process. In support of the Monsoon Asia Integrated Regional Study (MAIRS) program, NASA GES DISC (Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center) has processed MODIS land products at 1 km resolution over the Asia monsoon region (0o-60oN, 60o-150oE) with a common data structure and format. The processed data have been integrated into the Giovanni system (Goddard Interactive Online Visualization ANd aNalysis Infrastructure) that enables users to explore, analyze, and download data over an area and time period of interest easily. Currently, the following regional MODIS land products are available in Giovanni: 8-day 1km land surface temperature and active fire, monthly 1km vegetation index, and yearly 0.05o, 500m land cover types. More data will be added in the near future. By combining atmospheric and oceanic data products in the Giovanni system, it is possible to do further analyses of environmental and climate changes associated with the land, ocean, and atmosphere. This presentation demonstrates exploring land products in the Giovanni system with sample case scenarios.\n\nGiovanni Papini's Judas Iscariot: A study in tendentious fictional ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nL'argomento di questo articolo Ã¨ la costruzione di Giuda Iscariota nella biografia semi romanzata di Giovanni Papini, Storia di Cristo.

It should not come as a surprise that the preliminary instruction issued to nuncio Giovanni Battista Lacellotti to stay especially alert and secure the interest of the Catholic Church in Poland as well as care for Christian affairs during parliamentary sessions acquired particular significance. In early November 1622, by the appointment of cardinal Cosimo de Torres, under Gregory's XV papal brief of 3 December 1622, Antonio Francesco Cirioli became internuncio. A Bolognese by origin, Cirioli was and a Doctor of Laws and from 1621 an auditor of Cosimo de Torres's nunciature (to date completely absent from the literature of the subject. The office of the internuncio in Warsaw, to which he was appointed following his 13-month service as an auditor, was held by Cirioli for as many as twenty-three weeks, i.e. from 19 November 1622 to 29 April 1623.\n\nUse of the NASA Giovanni Data System for Geospatial Public Health Research: Example of Weather-Influenza Connection\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAcker, James G.; Soebiyanto, Radina; Kiang, Richard; Kempler, Steve\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe NASA Giovanni data analysis system has been recognized as a useful tool to access and analyze many different types of remote sensing data. The variety of environmental data types has allowed the use of Giovanni for different application areas, such as agriculture, hydrology, and air quality research. The use of Giovanni for researching connections between public health issues and Earths environment and climate, potentially exacerbated by anthropogenic influence, has been increasingly demonstrated. In this communication, the pertinence of several different data parameters to public health will be described. This communication also provides a case study of the use of remote sensing data from Giovanni in assessing the associations between seasonal influenza and meteorological parameters. In this study, logistic regression was employed with precipitation, temperature and specific humidity as predictors. Specific humidity was found to be associated (p 0.05) with influenza activity in both temperate and tropical climate. In the two temperate locations studied, specific humidity was negatively correlated with influenza; conversely, in the three tropical locations, specific humidity was positively correlated with influenza. Influenza prediction using the regression models showed good agreement with the observed data (correlation coefficient of 0.50.83).\n\nBiological and associated water-quality data for lower Olmos Creek and upper San Antonio River, San Antonio, Texas, March-October 1990\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTaylor, R.

Ad Antonio Canova lo lega una prima, importantissima lettera del 4 maggio 1807 nella quale, in seguito ad un invito trasmessogli dallo scultore, ma di cui Ã¨ responsabile Filippo III Colonna, enumera tutte le sue opere; la seconda risale al 25 febbraio 1809. Dalla prima missiva si riescono a stabilire numerosi contatti con Giuseppe Valadier: a Corridonia (Collegiata dei Santi Pietro, Paolo e Donato; Ospedale e Chiesa di San Salvatore e a Macerata (Palazzo Conti giÃ Ugolini. Tanto da giungere a considerare Mollari come il continuatore del Valadier nei cantieri marchigiani, dove la presenza del Maestro si manifesta come una sovrapposizione di motivi francesizzanti a soluzioni palladiane: componenti entrambe presenti nel Palazzo Tomassini a Corridonia, ricondotto al Maceratese. Fra lâaltro le pagine di due Taccuini valadieriani, certo a lui note, si possono considerare a metÃ strada fra lâesercizio tipologico ed il modello. Itâs not difficult to insert Antonio Mollari into a European context. A first very important letter, dated May 4th 1807, links him to Antonio Canova whereby, after inviting him, by wish of Phillip Colonna III , he then makes a list of all his works of art; the second is dated February 25th 1809. Various contacts with Giuseppe Valadier can be established from the first letter: in Corridonia (Saints Peter, Paul and Donato Collegiate church; St. Saviourâs Hospital and Church and in Macerata (Conti Palace ex Ugolini. So much so as to regard Mollari as Valadierâs continuator in the Marche construction sites, where the Maestroâs presence is expressed like a superimposition of Frenchified motives for Palladian solutions: both components being present in the Tomassini Palace in Corridonia, which can be traced back to Mollari.

J., III; Theobald, M.; Vollmer, B.; Wei, J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) has been the home of processing, archiving, and distribution services for the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) mission since its launch in 2002 for the global observations of the atmospheric state. Giovanni, a web-based application developed by the GES DISC, provides a simple and intuitive way to visualize, analyze, and access vast amounts of Earth science remote sensing data without having to download the data. Most important variables, including temperature and humidity profiles, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud properties, and trace gases, from version 6 AIRS product are available on Giovanni. The AIRS is an instrument suite comprised of a hyperspectral infrared instrument AIRS and two multichannel microwave instruments, the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB). As the HSB ceased operation in very early stage of AIRS mission, the AIRS project operates two parallel retrieval algorithms: one using both IR and MW measurements (AIRS+AMSU) and the other using only IR measurements (AIRS-only) for the most time of the mission. The AIRS+AMSU product is better and the variables on Giovanni are from it. However, the generation of AIRS+AMSU product has been suspended since the AMSU instrument anomaly occurred in late 2016. To continue exploring up-to-date AIRS observations, the same set of variables from the AIRS-only product are added on Giovanni by the GES DSIC. This will also support the comparison of AIRS-only with AIRS+AMSU retrievals. In the presentation, we will demonstrate the visualization of AIRS-only product and the plots/statistics of comparison with AIRS+AMSU product using Giovanni.\n\nExplore Earth Science Datasets for STEM with the NASA GES DISC Online Visualization and Analysis Tool, Giovanni\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLiu, Z.; Acker, J.; Kempler, S.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center(DISC) is one of twelve NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Data Centers that provide Earth science data, information, and services to users around the world including research and application scientists, students, citizen scientists, etc. The GESDISC is the home (archive) of remote sensing datasets for NASA Precipitation and Hydrology, Atmospheric Composition and Dynamics, etc. To facilitate Earth science data access, the GES DISC has been developing user-friendly data services for users at different levels in different countries.

Don Giovanni, of W.A. Mozart is one of the operas that more audiovisual versions has generated during the centuries XX and XXI, although very few films have finally been taken to the screen. This paper is focused on comparing the audiovisual versions Don Giovanni, by Joseph Losey (1979, and Juan by Kasper Holten (2010. Through a quantitative and qualitative methodology based on content analysis, this research reflects on the degree of intervention exercised by the language and audiovisual format used in the process of reinterpretation of the pre-existing operatic text.\n\nANTONIO LAMELA - beyond innovation In Memory\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nP. Cassinello\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Spanish architecture is in mourning. One of its most beloved referents, Antonio Lamela passed away on April 1, 2017. He has left us an extensive and polyhedral legacy that continues to live in the urban fabric of our cities, in the pages of his books, and in the model of thought and action, which presided over by the effort and the desire to innovate, led him to reach the highest levels of our profession. A model with which he founded his office in 1954 and which today, directed for many years by his son Carlos Lamela, has a relevant international representation having carried out projects in 32 countries. Beyond the formal and technological innovation of his buildings, in the 1950s Antonio Lamela established in Spain companies such as Prebetong and Shokbeton to modernize Spanish construction, actively intervening in the necessary expansion of âCaja de Elementos of Constructionâ demanded by Le Corbusier since the twenties. Changing his perspective, Antonio Lamela has also bequeathed us his pioneering reflections on the proper management of natural resources and the necessary sustainability of the architecture of our planet within the cosmos in which it lives. He will always be an unavoidable model for future generations.\n\nReflections on Michael Hardt and Antonio Negriâs Book âAssemblyâ\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChristian Fuchs\n\n2017-10-01\n\nFull Text Available This contribution presents reflections on Michael Hardt and Antonio Negriâs book âAssemblyâ (2017, Oxford: Oxford University Press, ISBNÂ 978-0190677961.

De la misma forma, la historia cuantitativa deberÃ­a abrir espacio para el estudio de las cualidades. Ya con relaciÃ³n a la historia de las elites, tan estudiada y reproducida en una diversidad de trabajos, que deberÃ­ase mirar en otra perspectiva. Es decir, no mirar a las reglas sociales predeterminadas, sino a los desvÃ­os y a las variaciones. Levi defiende que los historiadores deben trascender a los documentos que se encuentran fÃ¡cilmente y que pueden fortalecer perspectivas deformadas y esequilibradas de la sociedad. Para Ã©l, los historiadores deben esforzarse por estudiar a aquellos grupos que dejaron pocos rastros documentales.

L.; Beaudoing, H. K.; Rodell, M.; Silberstein, D. S.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nGlobal Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has two components: (1) GLDAS-2.0, entirely forced with the Princeton meteorological forcing data and (2) GLDAS-2.1, forced with a combination of model and observation-based data sets. GLDAS-2.0 data from the Noah model have been reprocessed in July 2015 with updated Princeton forcing data and upgraded Land Information System (LIS) software. The temporal coverage of GLDAS 2.0 is extended to 1948 ~ 2012. The reprocessed GLDAS-2.0 data are archived at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC), in self-describing and machine-independent NetCDF format, and can be accessed via HTTP for direct download, OPeNDAP for parameter and spatial subsetting, time aggregation, and format conversion, and Giovanni - Interactive Visualization and Analysis System. The OPeNDAP subsetting is also integrated into Simple Subset Wizard (SSW) for better User Interface and better downloading capability. This presentation describes the main characteristics of GLDAS data, the major improvements of the reprocessed data, and the access to the data. To further facilitate their use, reprocessed GLDAS-2.0 data are integrated into Giovanni, where the data can be easily explored with 17 visualization types, such as Lat-Lon Map and Animation, Time Series, Scatter Plot, and Histogram. This presentation also showcases the main climatology characteristics of 65 years of GLDAS, derived with Giovanni's new capabilities in computing climatology for user-defined time range and visualizing in Lat-Lon Map and Time Series. GLDAS-2.1 is analogous to and will soon replace GLDAS Version 1 (GLDAS-1), covering the time period from 2001 (or 2000 for the 0.25 degree data) to the present, with about a one-month latency. The data are also in NetCDF format and can be accessed via HTTP, OPeNDAP, and Giovanni.\n\nImplementation of an Online Climate Science Course at San Antonio College\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nReyes, R.; Strybos, J.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nSan Antonio College (SAC) plans to incorporate an online climate science class into the curriculum with a focus on local weather conditions and data. SAC is part of a network of five community colleges based around San Antonio, Texas, has over 20,000 students enrolled, and its student population reflects the diversity in ethnicity, age and gender of the San Antonio community. The college understands the importance of educating San Antonio residents on climate science and its complexities. San Antonio residents are familiar with weather changes and extreme conditions. The region has experienced an extreme drought, including water rationing in the city. Then, this year's El NiÃ±o intensified expected annual rainfalls and flash floods. The proposed climate science course will uniquely prepare students to understand weather data and the evidence of climate change impacting San Antonio at a local level. This paper will discuss the importance and challenges of introducing the new climate science course into the curriculum, and the desired class format that will increase the course's success. Two of the most significant challenges are informing students about the value of this class and identifying the best teaching format. Additionally, measuring and monitoring enrollment will be essential to determine the course performance and success. At the same time, Alamo Colleges is modifying the process of teaching online classes and is officially working to establish an online college. Around 23% of students enrolled in SAC offered courses are currently enrolled in online courses only, representing an opportunity to incorporate the climate science class as an online course. Since the proposed course will be using electronic textbooks and online applications to access hyperlocal weather data, the class is uniquely suited for online students.\n\nL'uomo inquieto.

The 2018Spring PaduaMuscleDays (2018SpPMD, were held in Euganei Hills and Padua (Italy, in March 14-17, and were dedicated to Giovanni Salviati. The main event of the âGiovanni Salviati Memorialâ, was held in the Aula Guariento, Accademia Galileiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti of Padua to honor a beloved friend and excellent scientist 20 years after his premature passing. Using the words of Prof. Nicola Rizzuto, we all share his believe that Giovanni âwill be remembered not only for his talent and originality as a biochemist, but also for his unassuming and humanistic personality, a rare quality in highly successful people like Giovanni. The best way to remember such a person is to gather pupils and colleagues, who shared with him the same scientific interests and ask them to discuss recent advances in their own fields, just as Giovanni have liked to doâ. Since Giovanniâs friends sent many abstracts still influenced by their previous collaboration with him, all the Sessions of the 2018SpPMD reflect both to the research aims of Giovanni Salviati and the traditional topics of the PaduaMuscleDays, that is, basics and applications of physical, molecular and cellular strategies to maintain or recover functions of skeletal muscles.

The effect is particularly evident in vector-borne diseases such as malaria where temperature, precipitation and humidity influence the lifecycle of the pathogens and mosquitoes. Likewise, the transmission of respiratory diseases is also often associated with climatic factors. For example, a recent study showed that low humidity and temperature provides efficient condition for seasonal influenza transmission. Understanding of how environment and climate affect infectious diseases would essentially provide guides to prevent and control the spread of disease. Toward this end, our group has developed models for infectious disease risk such as for malaria, dengue and influenza that are driven by climatic and environmental inputs. Results will be presented, especially those that used TRMM data from GIOVANNI.\n\nStupr e prÃ©.

In this work he âre-writesâ the famous Donna de Paradiso. The following study analyses Testoriâs adoption of some recurrent linguistic techniques to model Iacoponi da Todiâs masterpiece, in order to enlighten one of Testoriâs fundamental poetical images: maternal love bent on death.\n\nDon Giovanni Goes to Prison: Teaching Opera behind Bars\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPierpaolo Polzonetti\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Teaching opera in prison presents challenges, such as limits imposed on printed and recorded material to study it, or the audio-visual technology in the classroom space, yet, no other experience can be so inspiring and rewarding for everybody involved. This essay focuses on teaching opera, in particular Mozartâs Don Giovanni, to imprisoned students in America. It addresses pedagogical challenges on how to teach opera in prison and advocates for the need to leave the ivory tower of academia and engage in social action. If opera is still perceived as an elitist art form, it is because it is artificially kept that way by being practiced, taught, studied, and promoted only among an exclusive sector of our population.\n\n77 FR 36041 - San Antonio Central Railroad, L.L.C.-Lease Exemption-Port Authority of San Antonio\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2012-06-15\n\n... control of SAC upon SAC becoming a Class III rail carrier.

The\n\nLate Quaternary evolution of the San Antonio Submarine Canyon in the central Chile forearc (â¼33Â°S)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLaursen, Jane; Normark, William R.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nHydrosweep swath-bathymetry and seismic-reflection data reveal the morphology, sedimentary processes, and structural controls on the submarine San Antonio Canyon. The canyon crosses the forearc slope of the central Chile margin for more than 150 km before it empties into the Chile Trench near 33Â°S latitude. In its upper reaches, the nearly orthogonal segments of the San Antonio Canyon incise â¼1 km into thick sediment following underlying margin-perpendicular basement faults and along the landward side of a prominent margin-parallel thrust ridge on the outer mid-slope. At a breach in the outer ridge, the canyon makes a sharp turn into the San Antonio Reentrant. Resistance to erosion of outcropping basement at the head of the reentrant has prevented the development of a uniformly sloping thalweg, leaving gentle gradients (6Â°) across the lower slope. Emergence of an obstruction across the head of the San Antonio Reentrant has trapped sediment in the mid-slope segments of the canyon. Presently, little sediment appears to reach the Chile Trench through the San Antonio Canyon. The development of the San Antonio Canyon was controlled by the impact of a subducted seamount, which formed the San Antonio Reentrant and warped the middle slope along its landward advancing path. Incision of the canyon landward of the outer mid-slope ridge may be ascribed to a combination of headward erosion and entrenchment by captured unconfined turbidity currents. Flushing of the canyon was likely enhanced during the lowered sea level of the last glaciation. Where the canyon occupies the triangular embayment of the reentrant at the base of the slope, sediment has ponded behind a small accretionary ridge. On the trench floor opposite the San Antonio Canyon mouth, a 200-m-thick leveeâoverbank complex formed on the left side of a distributary channel emanating from a breach in the accretionary ridge. Axial transfer of sediment was inhibited to the north of the San Antonio Canyon mouth\n\nLaRC Modeling of Ozone Formation in San Antonio, Texas\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGuo, F.; Griffin, R. J.; Bui, A.; Schulze, B.; Wallace, H. W., IV; Flynn, J. H., III; Erickson, M.; Kotsakis, A.; Alvarez, S. L.; Usenko, S.; Sheesley, R. J.; Yoon, S.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nOzone (O3) is one of the most important trace species within the troposphere and results from photochemistry involving emissions from a complex array of sources. Ground-level O3 is detrimental to ecosystems and causes a variety of human health problems including respiratory irritation, asthma and reduction in lung capacity. However, the O3 Design Value in San Antonio, Texas, was in violation of the federal threshold set by the EPA (70 ppb, 8-hr max) based on the average for the most recent three-year period (2014-2016). To understand the sources of high O3 concentrations in this nonattainment area, we assembled and deployed a mobile air quality laboratory and operated it in two locations in the southeast (Traveler's World RV Park) and northwest (University of Texas at San Antonio) of downtown San Antonio during summer 2017 to measure O3 and its precursors, including total nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Additional measurements included temperature, relative humidity, pressure, solar radiation, wind speed, wind direction, total reactive nitrogen (NOy), carbon monoxide (CO), and aerosol composition and concentration. We will use the campaign data and the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) Zero-Dimensional Box Model (Crawford et al., 1999; Olson et al., 2006) to calculate O3 production rate, NOx and hydroxyl radical chain length, and NOx versus VOCs sensitivity at different times of a day with different photochemical and meteorological conditions. A key to our understanding is to combine model results with measurements of precursor gases, particle chemistry and particle size to support the identification of O3 sources, its major formation pathways, and how the ozone production efficiency (OPE) depends on various factors. The resulting understanding of the causes of high O3 concentrations in the San Antonio area will provide insight into future air quality protection.\n\nBiological and associated water-quality data for lower Olmos Creek and upper San Antonio River, San Antonio, Texas, April - September 1989\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTaylor, R. Lynn; Ferreira, Rodger F.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nBiological and associated water-quality data were collected from lower Olmos Creek and upper San Antonio River in San Antonio, Texas, during April-September 1989. Benthic macroinvertebrate, periphyton, and phytoplankton communities were sampled at three sites along the Olmos Creek/San Antonio River system. Total mean densities of benthic macroinvertebrates for the three sites ranged from 670 to 10,000 organisms per square meter. The most abundant macroinvertebrates were the class Insecta (insects). Total densities of periphyton ranged from 2,900 to 110,000 cells per square millimeter. Cyanophyta (blue-green algae) and Bacillariophyta (diatoms) were the predominant periphyton organisms. Total densities of phyto- plankton ranged from 5,000 to 47,000 cells per square milliliter. Blue-green algae accounted for more than one- half of the phytoplankton in each sample. Hardness ranged from 160 to 250 milligrams per liter as calcium carbonate, and alkalinity ranged from 130 to 220 milligrams per liter as calcium carbonate. The largest dissolved nitrite concentration was 0.038 milligram per liter. The largest total phosphorus concentration was 0.150 milligram per liter, over one-half of which was dissolved orthophosphate. Total aluminum and total iron were the only trace elements in water to exceed the reporting threshold by large concen- trations. Total aluminum concentrations ranged from 70 to 280 micrograms per liter, and total iron concentrations ranged from 70 to 340 micrograms per liter. Lead was the most prominent trace element in bottom-material samples, with concentrations ranging from 30 to 230 micrograms per gram.\n\nGiovanni Cingolani pittore e restauratore fra l'Italia, il Vaticano e l'Argentina tra Ottocento e Novecento / Giovanni Cingolani painter and restorer between Italy, Vatican and Argentina in the 19th and 20th Centuries\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFrancesca Coltrinari\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThe life of Giovanni Cingolani (Montecassiano, 1859 â Santa Fe, 1932 takes place between Italy and Argentina at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. Cingolani redeems his humble origins with a successful career as a painter and restorer in Rome between 1880 and 1908. Thanks to the relations with prelates and painters of Perugia, close to Pope Leo XIII, the artist fits himself in the papal circles, devoting himself to painting religious and to the portrait. Came into contact with Ludovico Seitz, director of the Vatican Museums, participates in the major restorations in the Borgia apartment, in the chapel Niccolina, in the Vatican Stanze and in the Sistine Chapel. In 1909 he emigrated to Santa Fe, where he worked as a church decorator and portrait painter, devoting himself intensely to teaching: thanks to unpublished documents, especially the correspondence between Cingolani, his daughter Leonilde and the director of the library of Macerata, Giovanni Spadoni, you can learn many details about his life and the Italian and Argentines artistic milieus he frequented. The paper wants to disclose this almost unknown artist, âmigrantâ between Italy and Argentina, highlighting his role of disseminator of European academic tradition in Latin America.\n\nInterview of Antonio Vergara Fernandez about the First Beam\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nAntonio Vergara Fernandez\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAntonio Vergara Fernandez : Engineer of the LHC commissioning Questions asked : 1.

Psicologia della politica [Individualism and Cooperation: Psychology of Politics] is the outcome of a critical reflection begun by the author at the end of the 1970s in order to explore the manifestations and the problems of cooperation between individuals, and to identify some \"universal\" psychological factors that could define the role of psychology within politics and constitute an \"objective foundation\" of any human culture. Although Jervis was, so to speak,favoring Darwin against Marx, it is argued that,from his overall reasoning, several of his arguments actually are in favor of the inevitable \"historicity\" of individuals, due to the social conditioning they are subjected since birth: too often certain \"universalistic\" approaches transmit, together with scientific advances (or even without them), well identifiable ideological motives linked to precise and well defined historical and economic interests?\n\nANTONIO GAMONEDA: LA CONSTRUCCIÃN DEL OLVIDO\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJorge FernÃ¡ndez Gonzalo\n\n2014-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Nuestro estudio trata de analizar el concepto de memoria y olvido en la producciÃ³n poÃ©tica de Antonio Gamoneda a travÃ©s de obras como DescripciÃ³n de la mentira, LÃ¡pidas, Libro del frÃ­o o Arden las pÃ©rdidas, y en relaciÃ³n al perÃ­odo histÃ³rico que le tocÃ³ vivir al autor.\n\nEvaluating background noise: Assessing off-site data from field surveys around the Italic sanctuary of S.

There are likely numerous locations where the establishment of a time-series station would be desirable, but for reasons of funding or logistics, such establishment may not be feasible. An alternative to an operational time-series station is monitoring of sites via remote sensing. In this study, the NASA Giovanni data system is employed to simulate the establishment of two time-series stations near the outflow region of California s Eel River, which carries a high sediment load. Previous time-series analysis of this location (Acker et al. 2009) indicated that remotely-sensed chl a exhibits a statistically significant increasing trend during summer (low flow) months, but no apparent trend during winter (high flow) months. Examination of several newly-available ocean data parameters in Giovanni, including 8-day resolution data, demonstrates the differences in ocean parameter trends at the two locations compared to regionally-averaged time-series. The hypothesis that the increased summer chl a values are related to increasing SST is evaluated, and the signature of the Eel River plume is defined with ocean optical parameters.\n\nO conceito de reduÃ§Ã£o estrutural na crÃ­tica de Antonio Candido\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFranscisca Fernanda de Sales Teixeira\n\n2018-04-01\n\nFull Text Available RESUMO: O presente artigo apresenta o conceito de reduÃ§Ã£o estrutural na crÃ­tica literÃ¡ria de Antonio Candido.

One such early use appears in his commentary on his friend Girolamo Benivieni's love poetry, the Canzone d'amore, of 1486-1487. In the passages discussed here, Pico presents an intensive Platonic natural philosophical analysis based on a deep astrologically informed understanding of human nature as he attempts to explain a perennial question, namely, why one person is attracted to a certain person (or people), and another to others.
