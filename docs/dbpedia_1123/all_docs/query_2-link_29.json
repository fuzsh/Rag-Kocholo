        "text": "All over the world, environmentally friendly wooden buildings are steadily reaching new heights. In 2016, the University of British Columbia completed work on all 53 meters of the Brock Commons student housing project The Tree. In 2018, Norway became home to the world’s highest wooden building. In May this year, Singapore claims to have the largest timber building in Asia with a sprawling 468,000 square feet college campus. And now the world’s largest wood city is projected – in Sweden.\n\nThe developers say high efficiency and precision are saving time and money. The domino effect of building in wood continues when Swedish real estate developer Atrium Ljungberg is getting ready to build the world’s largest wooden city, constructed in Sweden’s capital, Stockholm, from 2025.\n\nThe World’s Largest Wood City – in Sweden, article continues below image.\n\nYou might also like to know more about the world’s highest wooden building? Just click the image below.\n\nStockholm Wood City will feature 7,000 office spaces and 2,000 homes in the city’s southeast, and will offer “a vibrant, urban environment with a mix of workplaces, housing, restaurants and shops,” according to a press release. Set across 250,000 square meters (2.7 million square feet), it has been described by its developer as the “world’s largest known construction project in wood.”\n\nThe project is being built in Sickla, a neighborhood already home to more than 400 companies, according to Atrium Ljungberg, which owns a retail park on the former industrial site. The developer describes the area as a “five-minute city,” claiming that workplaces, homes, leisure facilities and amenities are all within a five-minute walk of one another.\n\nThe World’s Largest Wood City – in Sweden, article continues below image.\n\nYou might also like to read about experimental wooden structures in Norway. Just click the image below:\n\nOf all building materials, wood holds a special place. It is a renewable, ecological, environmentally friendly, and climate-smart material. And durable. Think about the numerous wood houses that are hundreds of years old!\n\nIt’s a climate-smart choice. The use of timber in urban construction has been found to produce significantly lower carbon emissions than conventional building materials.\n\nThe World’s Largest Wood City – in Sweden, article continues below image.\n\nThe largest wooden building in Northern Europe is found in Trondheim, Norway. Click the image below to learn more.\n\nHowever, it also brings new risks. The biggest is the fire safety risk associated with wooden buildings — though that’s a divisive point. Proponents say fears of inflated fire risks are misinformed, while skeptics point to issues concerning fire safety regulations.\n\nTimber has been championed as a sustainable alternative to concrete and steel, with ambitious new construction projects utilizing wood beyond single-family homes and modest residential or office buildings. A mixed-use development of this size would, however, be “a historic milestone for Swedish innovation capability,” said Annica Ånäs, CEO of Atrium Ljungberg, in a statement.\n\nThere are other reasons to choose wood too. It’s a delightful material to work with, it’s easy to restore and maintain and gives a warm and cozy feeling wherever it’s used. Sweden is a forest country and building with wood, the country’s abundant natural renewable resource, supports the nations growth, climate, and environmental goals.\n\nDesigned by architecture firms White Arkitekter and Henning Larsen, construction on “Stockholm Wood City” is slated to begin in 2025 and will take a decade to complete.\n\nThe World’s Largest Wood City – in Sweden, written by Tor Kjolberg\n\nAll images © Atrium Ljungberg\n\nDenmark is still an unknown territory for many surfers. There are, however, many surfing spots in Denmark of international interest. In fact, Denmark is a paradise for surfers.\n\nDue to Denmark’s geographical position in Northern Europe, it is predominantly exposed to the swells of the North Sea. Its most consistent surfing areas is the west coast. In this article, we have located where to find the best waves in Denmark.\n\nSurfing in Denmark began around 1980 when windsurfers visiting the west coast realized that there were often waves but no wind during the summer. 90% of all the best surf spots are located at the area of Thy on the northwest coast of Jylland. You can arrive there by boat/or car from Oslo in Norway, Gothenburg in Sweden, or the capital, Copenhagen. The most common way of getting there is by bringing your car on the ferry to Hirtshals from either Oslo or Gothenburg and drive down 1,5 hours and you’re straight in the surfing-zone.\n\nAll good surfers know that you don’t share your secret spots. As a non-surfer I can share the secrets with you – for those brave enough to surf in Denmark’s cold water. Denmark is the best of the three Scandinavian nations for riding a wave on a surfboard.\n\nMost swells occur from September to April, with the prime autumn months of September to November bringing the best waves to the west coast.\n\nWhen making my little surf guide, my aim was to give you a better understanding of where to go, which spots work in the different conditions and how to get there. International Surfing Federation of Denmark is a great place to get more information.\n\n1. Inside Reef, Klitmøller\n\nThis sandy beach in Klitmøller is located next to the North Sea approx. 10 km south of Hanstholm. The beach is connected to Klitmøller town and stretches from Splittergab in the north to Ørhage in the south. There are buildings a few meters from the beach. The beach is suitable for fishing and surfing. Toilet at the car park at Splittergab and the car park at Ørhage.\n\nNorway is also an exotic surfing paradise. Learn more by clicking the image below:\n\n2. Bunkers, Klitmøller\n\nThis is the place to be for a good right wave which gives super performance when it’s on! And also, the surroundings here are just stunning, even if the waves aren’t right.\n\nKlintmøller’s nickname is “Cold Hawaii”. I need say no more.\n\n3. Agger\n\nThis area’s home to the yearly “Heavy Agger” – a heavy metal music festival. Besides the music, the surf setup can provide some of the heaviest waves around. Main spot Agger is a long stretch of sandy beaches with lefts and rights, which start working from hip high and all the way up to triple overhead. Suited for all levels of surfing, depending on the size of the swell.\n\nDenmark – A Paradise for Surfers – article continues below the image.\n\nIf you want extreme surfing – look to Norway. Learn more by clicking the image below:\n\nThere are several of piers that creates breaks along the beach line, so this is a great place to explore when the conditions are right. Mentionable is also the spot called Agger Channel. A right-hand sand point, that works from shoulder high to double overhead. This spot is for only intermediate surfers and above, and when everything is out of control, this place can be the perfect choice.\n\n4. Big Pier, Nørre, Vorupør\n\nBig Pier is a fun place to surf when there’s a big swell and lots of wind, because the pier protects you from the heavy wind. It’s a short drive down the coast from Klitmøller. The area also holds two additional spots: Small Pier and South Side. Both piers are lefthanders (Small Pier can provide rights), primarily suited for longboarders. And the South Side works in bigger swells and is a great spot for advanced/expert surfers with shortboards.\n\nDenmark – A Paradise for Surfers – article continues below image.\n\nYou might also like to read about the Danish Viking Who Crossed from Denmark to Norway on a Paddleboard. Click the image below.\n\n5. Hvide Sande\n\nThe spot is on the south side of the Harbor entrance. Close to the pier the banks are formed pretty consistent and sheltered from northerly winds. On any onshore direction you get a bit of wave size here. The best waves are with north-westerlies as the pier provides shelter from the wind or if you are lucky, you might get an offshore or windless day after a storm. Hvide Sande is a relaxed Danish town with great smoked fish and a couple of bars and restaurants. The whole region gets pretty busy in summer and there’s usually someone in the water with you.\n\n6. Fiskemelet, Hanstholm\n\nThis is one wave you need to try when you’re in Denmark. Hanstholm is a 15-minute drive from Klitmøller, and whatever the weather, you’ll find beautiful long waves here.\n\n7. The Kattegat\n\nThe Kattegat is the closest place to surf from Copenhagen. It works mainly in autumn northerlies, but wet summers can also bring many messy W wind days. Spring is often a good time for strong E winds in the Baltic after the ice melts.\n\nIt’s often during spring when strong E winds blow for at least eight hours, and the Baltic Sea can be surfed around Stevns Klint and in front of the harbor wall at Rødvig.\n\nKlitmøller is the epicenter of surfing in Denmark, but as you can see, far from the only place for avid surfers visiting Denmark.\n\nDenmark – A Paradise for Surfers, compiled by Tor Kjolberg\n\nFeature image (on top): Klitmøller © Mads Tolstrup/Visit Denmark\n\nPlanning a flight to Scandinavia or anywhere else in the world?

The company is always seeking the answer for architecture of the future, with modern technology that minimizes the human impact in nature. The architects as well as the designers look for new solutions both technically and aesthetically. Read more about the architect who created the most beautiful villa in Sweden.\n\n“I’ve come to realize that life is not square, and neither is nature. Therefore, it is obvious to me that our living spaces should not be square either”, the Swedish architect Pål Ross explains. “We don’t walk in straight lines on the beach or in the woods, so why on earth do vi insist in living in square houses,” he adds.\n\nSince 1996, Ross Architecture & Design AB, under the leadership of architect Pål Ross, has worked with the intention of being the leader in offering its own unique designs. Their innovative and award-winning architecture has a very strong historical foundation that guarantees timelessness in their work.\n\nBert Wingårdh is another Swedish star architect. To learn more about him, click the image below.\n\nSince he started his architecture business, Pål has created more than 300 beautiful homes. One of them was featured in 2021 in Swedish TV4’s show “Grand Designs”. In the show, Pål tells about the need for both body and soul to feel well at home, and why all his houses have round shapes and ambitious environmental goals.\n\nPål is the son of a gifted artist and granson of a factory owner in Småland in Sweden and says people there are known for their persistent approach to business. “I sometimes think that this is my key strength – and perhaps my greatest weakness. I am incredibly bad at giving up, but thanks to this perseverance and skill I have done what people thought impossible,” he once said in an interview.\n\nHe graduated in 1992, facing a harsh economic climate and high unemployment amongst architects and started Ross Architect & Design in 1996.\n\nIn 2009, the company created Villa Victor in Öresund, which was regarded as ‘the most beautiful villa in Sweden’. Pål Ross is an expert at thinking outside the box and his reference list testifies to a solid competence far beyond the ordinary. His houses are characterized by a combination of the classical and modern, organic forms and are in interplay with nature.\n\nThe Swedish architect Elding Oscarson is leaving a trace of eccentric as well as experimental architecture. Read more by clicking the image below.\n\nIn 2013, Ross Studio was announced as one of the winners in the European leg of the International Property Award, stating that the winners “increase the beauty” of their cities.\n\nIn 2014, Ross Studio was prized internationally for the “Best Single Residence in Sweden”. The villa also received a building preservation award from the local history society of the Jämtland region for its anchoring to the area’s architectural historical and cultural heritage.\n\nPål Ross has spent several years living in Spain and has successfully introduced Ross Architecture & Design in the country. One of his latest projects together with a Swedish client was a beautiful property finalized last year. The house is built in a fantastic location where an old house was torn down and a new house was erected with a unique design in the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula where the rather hilly landscape fitted the architecture perfectly.\n\n“Our organic shaping creates playful shadows as the walls are not completely straight. This adds vitality. These buildings are made in white which is an unusually fruitful color to work with. It has attitude and is timeless. The physical environments that we build around us need to make us feel alive, make us feel joy about being where we are. That’s probably why we earlier this month were awarded both gold and silver price in ADCs international architecture competition,” Pål Ross concludes.\n\nThe Architect Who Created the Most Beautiful Villa in Sweden, written by Tor Kjolberg\n\nScandinavian culture isn’t the first that comes to mind in the context of things like psychic readings, Tarot cards, and other spiritual practices. But this doesn’t mean that Zodiac psychics, astrologists, mediums, and their colleagues have no clients in Scandinavia whatsoever—they do. And it looks like they are slowly getting out of obscurity and gaining popularity. Do Scandinavian People Believe in Psychics? Learn more.\n\nScandis Are Notoriously Rational\n\nSwedes, Norwegians, and Danes are known as some of the world’s most rational and non-spiritual nations. Even traditional religions, such as Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, are less popular in Scandinavia than in most other developed countries. For example, up to 40% of Norwegians identify as non-religious or atheist. To compare, in the U.S., the number is between 6% and 15%.\n\nLearn more about love and relationships by clicking the image below.\n\nGiven their reasonable, logic-oriented mindset, it’s not surprising that Scandinavians aren’t big on thighs like fortune telling, Tarot reading, or palmistry. Obviously, this depends on the individual, but Scandis generally don’t have much interest in the spirit world or other paranormal phenomena.\n\nScandis Are Generally Fine with Uncertainty\n\nThere’s one more reason why psychic services akin to spiritual advisors and fortune tellers aren’t particularly common in Scandinavia. According to Hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory, Sweden, Denmark, and to a lesser extent, Norway score fairly low on the uncertainty avoidance scale.\n\nThis means that Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians are fine not knowing what’s to come. They don’t need everything to be predictable and don’t feel anxious without being aware of what tomorrow will bring. So it makes sense for Scandis to be reluctant about psychics—they are perfectly comfortable waiting to see what the future holds instead of trying to find out in advance.\n\nUntil Recently, Psychic Readings Weren’t Common\n\nGiven Scandis’ rationalism and low uncertainty avoidance, expecting them to be avid spiritualists and astrology lovers would be a mistake. While psychic apps are in-demand in other countries (and have grown even more popular since the beginning of the pandemic), that’s not the case in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Or at least it wasn’t, because things are slowly changing now.\n\nIn fact, there was a scandal in Norway in 2019 when the Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education accredited several astrology courses for students, basically granting them the same rights and recognition as more traditional subjects. Educators were divided, and many of them were outraged at the decision.\n\nThis story might seem irrelevant to people outside of the education system. But it actually illustrates two trends—Scandinavians’ general distaste for spiritual practices and, at the same time, their slowly changing status in Scandinavian society. Despite the scientific outcry, astrological courses remain accredited.\n\nLately, Things Have Changed\n\nThe 2019 events in Norway aren’t the only evidence that suggests that Scandis’ perception of astrology, psychic readings, and other similar practices is changing for the better. In recent years, Scandinavia has experienced a massive increase in spiritual advisors, Tarot readers, palm readers, and other psychics who offer their services on a commercial basis.\n\nYou might also like to read about a Scandinavian chuckle. Just click the image below.\n\nIt hasn’t been until recently that online psychic reading and astrology websites emerged, catering specifically to Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish users. Relevant global platforms, including mobile applications, are also witnessing an influx of Scandinavian users. Sure, it’s still an emerging market in Scandinavia, but things are slowly looking up.\n\nWhat Psychic Services Do People in Scandinavia Use?\n\nWhen it comes to psychic reading types and services that Scandinavian clients prefer, they aren’t much different from the global trends. Some of Scandis’ top choices include:\n\nAstrology guides and horoscopes. As is evident from the 2019 scandal in Norway, astrology may be a niche market in Scandinavia, but it’s a market nonetheless. People are interested in astrology-based self-discovery, daily horoscopes, and astrology guides for decision-making.\n\nAstrological compatibility analyses. Love is traditionally one of the biggest topics psychics get to work with, and Scandi clients are no exception. Hence the popularity of astrological compatibility analyses.\n\nTarot readings. Tarot card readings are a centuries-old tradition that has only recently become relevant again after a long period of oblivion. According to a few Swedish and Norwegian psychic platforms, it’s another popular request among Scandinavian clients.\n\nFortune telling. Finally, fortune telling has always been in demand, and despite their low uncertainty avoidance, Scandis aren’t breaking the tradition here. Some of the most common questions professional psychics get from their clients start with what will happen.\n\nAnd perhaps the most popular psychic service — both in Scandinavia and globally — is general spiritual guidance that focuses on helping psychics’ clients solve their current problems, be it in their love life, career, or anything else.\n\nDo Scandinavian People Believe in Psychics? – An Afterword\n\nWill Norway, Sweden, or Denmark become the new India when it comes to appreciating psychic readings and astrology? Probably not, at least not anytime soon. But Scandis have definitely been growing increasingly curious about these topics in recent years. So who knows?\n\nDo Scandinavian People Believe in Psychics? Written dedicatedly for Daily Scandinavian by Amanda Barrey. Amanda is a journalist and blogger passionate about psychic readings. She has been writing for various publications for over a decade, covering a wide range of topics including lifestyle, entertainment, and spirituality. In her free time, Amanda loves to explore the world of psychic readings, studying various forms of divination such as tarot, astrology, and\n\nnumerology.\n\nFeature image (on top): Photo by Farzad Mohsenvand / Unsplash\n\nIt apparently started in April 2017. In April that year, 30 years after the first blue IKEA bag was made in 1987, the fashion house Balenciaga launched a blueprint of the IKEA bag Frakta. Ikea Chick Fashion was born. From Yellow Shopping Bags to IKEA Chick Fashion is the fascinating story about how the Swedish furniture giant also became a leader of fashion.\n\nAutumn 2021, the company released its first branded merchandise collection, Efterträda (In English, Successor), featuring 10 pieces of clothing and accessories emblazoned with its logo and the barcode of the iconic Billy shelving system. The line inclined t-shirts, hoodies, bottles, umbrellas, towels, and tote bags. The tops and towels were made from 100 per cent sustainability-sourced cotton, while the collapsible umbrella was made from recycled polyester.\n\nBy clicking the image below, you can learn more about IKEA’s e-commerce growth.\n\nIKEA aimed to become the new symbol of democratic design represented by the brand. The capsule was born from a collaboration between the parent company in Sweden and the IKEA Japanese branch of Tokyo, one of the capitals of design and above all of streetwear worldwide, with in mind the values at the base of all Ikea products, which today range from furniture to home décor, also passing through publishing and foods & beverages, which are those of simplicity , functionality and minimalism.\n\nIs this a sign of the times? In the past, luxury brands such as Balenciaga and Luis Vuitton have been copied to excess. Now, a low-cost supplier of furniture is taking the driver’s seat by launching a streetwear collection.\n\nBootleg IKEA-branded clothing and accessories have proliferated on the internet for years, with designer Demna Gvasalia copying the brand’s iconic blue Frakta bag for Balenciaga in 2017 and two LA-based brands teaming up to turn the tote into a baseball cap.\n\nBy clicking the image below, you can learn how IKEA conquered the world with innovation and design.\n\nThe streetwear collection, however, does not consist of simple Ikea branded merch but represents a concrete effort in the field of lifestyle that starts from clothing items such as t-shirts, sweatshirts and tote bags but includes daily accessories such as portable fans, key rings, water bottles and towels. The graphics that decorate all the objects in the collection are those of the now iconic IKEA logo and that of the barcode. Especially the items that bear such graphics recall the aesthetics of the Off White x IKEA Receipt Carpet of the Markerad collection created by Virgil Abloh.\n\nHowever, the Balenciaga bag was only part of what has become a do-it-yourself movement. In the wake of the bag, an army of design products appeared, so-called hacks, where creative souls all over the globe had designed the IKEA bag into almost by the numbers. The cheap plastic bag appeared online transformed into raincoats, thongs, face masks, dog clothing, bum bags. The list is long.\n\nAccording to IKEA, the Efterträda collection mimics its approach to home-furnishing, “with simple, everyday takes on clothes and accessories”.\n\nRead the story about the Swedish furniture giant by clicking the image below:\n\nThe boom in popularity of IKEA’s blue shopping bags thanks to Demna Gvasalia and Balenciaga is eloquent. But the fact that the brand counts among its collaborators personalities such as Abloh, Daniel Arsham, Olafur Eliasson and Sarah Andelman as well as with brands such as Sonos and Greyhoud Originals has proved to be trendsetting. Not to mention, as pointed out by the brand strategist Lucile de Goallec on the pages of Fashion United, that the graphics of the barcode suggest ideas of homologation and commodification, as well as not being the maximum of originality.\n\nPeople who have been ashamed of replica Aalto stools, Billy bookshelves or cheap IKEA mattresses with difficult Scandinavian names can get over their embarrassment. IKEA is once again a wizard.\n\nFrom Yellow Shopping Bags to IKEA Chick Fashion, written by Tor Kjolberg\n\nIf you’re looking for a vacation destination for your next getaway, consider visiting any of the Scandinavian countries. Whether you’re visiting Denmark, Sweden, or Norway, you’re guaranteed to see unforgettable sights and meet amazing people. If this is your first trip out to these parts, here are 6 Things To Keep in Mind When Visiting a Scandinavian Country for the First Time.\n\nGet these things squared away to have the best trip possible.\n\n1. What To Pack\n\nWhat you pack for your Scandinavian trip will depend on where you’re going and what you plan to do during your visit. Those who plan to lounge and relax can pack lighter clothing, but you should pack short and long-sleeve tops because the weather can be on the cooler side. It’s advised to wear layers even during the warmer months because you can always take something off as the day gets warmer or you go to a different place.\n\nClick the image below to learn about the Scandinavian all-season packing list.\n\nIf you plan to hike and see the sights, then bring your layers but also take your walking shoes and hiking boots and ensure they’re comfortable because you’ll be in them a lot. Those planning to spend a lot of time outside should also pack or plan to buy a raincoat because there’s often a chance of rain. The sun can also be harsh up north, so take sunglasses and a hat, and plan to put on sunscreen.\n\n2. Stay Comfortable While Flying\n\nMany people decide to make a whole adventure out here, and they desire to travel between at least two Scandinavian countries. Whether you’re taking those shorter flights or flying home at the end of your trip, you’ll want to make sure you are comfortable when you travel.\n\nYou may get drowsy during longer trips, so pack your blanket and small pillow and bring an eye mask if that helps. During the flight, drink some water and try to avoid alcohol so you stay hydrated. Every once in a while, get up, walk, and stretch your legs to keep the blood flowing. If you’re often anxious on flights, then know that you’re not alone, but you don’t need to be afraid. Bring some mindfulness tools like a journal so you can write down your feelings, and bring headphones so you can listen to relaxing music.\n\nFear of flying?

Keep It Clean And Eco-Friendly\n\nRegardless of which Scandinavian country you visit, you’re almost guaranteed to see some of our planet’s most beautiful landscapes and vistas. They’re the kind of sights that you’ll someday want your grandkids to see, so to keep it pristine, make sure to be responsible, clean up after any messes, and make your vacation eco-friendly.\n\n6 Things To Keep in Mind When Visiting a Scandinavian Country for the First Time – the article continues below the image.\n\nThat means reducing your carbon footprint and creating less waste by using recycled water bottles that you can refill repeatedly. Also, try to avoid the urge to rent a car and instead try public transportation so you’re not unnecessarily polluting the air with exhaust fumes. Whenever possible, cook your own food. It’s tempting to eat out for every meal while on vacation, but doing so may drive you to eat more processed or packaged foods, which generate waste to produce.\n\n4. Bring Your Wearable Tech\n\nYou’ll be so busy exploring the wonder of these Scandinavian countries that you’ll need some help from digital tech to keep track of it all. Don’t forget to pack your FitBits, Apple Watches, and other technological devices and install the apps that can help you along the way. Using wearable tech can improve your quality of life, and help you track your wellness while you are vacationing. For instance, while you’re doing all that hiking across amazing landscapes, you can use your fitness tracker to see how many calories you’re burning along the way. Plus, you can monitor your heart rate and other factors to know when to take a break.\n\nWearable tech can be incredibly helpful when you have a health condition and want to keep an eye on your stats while you’re far from home. Bring your blood pressure and ECG monitors and keep them with you at all times to keep your health in check during your wonderful trip.\n\n5. Try The Food\n\nNo vacation is complete without trying the local food and the Scandinavian countries are famous for their cuisine, so prepare to be dazzled. The beauty of Scandinavian cuisine is that it’s diverse, and there’s something for everyone, so try everything. While there’s a lot of variety, there are certain delicacies that you should try based on the country you visit.\n\nLearn more about Scandinavian food and drink by cliking the image below.\n\nWhen in Sweden, try a dish with lingonberries, try the seafood in Norway, pork in Denmark, bilberries in Finland, and fish dishes in Iceland. Although you should try each, don’t let this list limit you. Try the smaller local restaurants, and you’ll surely have a meal you won’t forget. While you’re traveling, meet and talk with some of the locals and ask them about their favorite spots.\n\n6. See The Natural Beauty\n\nWe’ve mentioned the amazing beauty that you can behold in any Scandinavian country, and it’s true. You can turn your head almost anywhere and see something unique. With that said, there are certain natural wonders that you simply must explore, including Mons Klint. That’s an amazing cliffside destination where you can walk along the water, venture through the forest, or go fossil hunting and find souvenirs that are millions of years old.\n\nAnother must-see destination is Lappeenranta in Finland, which is the country’s largest lake. While there, you can walk along the waterside or bike through the trails. If you’re more adventurous, you can take a canoe or kayak, travel down the incredible river, and behold the beauty surrounding you. There are tons of great sights to see, so ask your tour guide for the best spots. Don’t forget to take your camera.\n\nRemember these essential tips for your next visit to some or all of the amazing Scandinavian countries. Plan your trip ahead of time and pick out some of the best sights and make it a trip to remember forever.\n\n6 Things To Keep in Mind When Visiting a Scandinavian Country for the First Time, written dedicatedly for Daily Scandinavian by Ainsley Lawrence.

From the breathtaking fjords to the magical Northern Lights, it provides a spectacle of natural wonders. Lean more by Understanding Norway: Cultural etiquette for the first time traveler.\n\nWhen you marvel at these unique sights, it’s also essential to understand the local culture and etiquette. Being aware of Norwegian norms will ensure a pleasant journey, leaving you with fond memories and an enriched perspective. Let’s explore these aspects of Norwegian society to help you blend in seamlessly on your first trip!\n\n1. A Love for Nature and Outdoors\n\nThe Right of AccessNorwegians love the great outdoors, and their laws reflect this. The “Right of Access” (Allemannsretten) allows anyone to roam freely in the countryside, pick wildflowers, berries, and camp almost anywhere. “When in Norway, feel free to enjoy this unique freedom, but remember to respect nature and private property boundaries. Don’t litter, make excessive noise, or disrupt wildlife,” says Sarah Kendall, a travel blogger\n\nSolidEssay.\n\nDo you want to know more about everyman’s right in Norway, just click the image below.\n\nHiking and Skiing\n\nHiking and skiing are integral to Norwegian culture. Be prepared to partake in these activities, as they are typical pastimes and excellent ways to connect with locals. No matter the season, Norwegians always find a way to enjoy their splendid outdoors!\n\nUnderstanding Norway: Cultural Etiquette for the First-Time Traveler, the article continues below the image.\n\n2. Embracing Janteloven\n\nJanteloven, or the Law of Jante, is a societal norm in Norway that emphasizes equality and humility. It discourages individuals from boasting about their achievements or showing off. When interacting with Norwegians, remember to mirror this modesty and respect for egalitarianism. You’ll find that while Norwegians might come across as a bit reserved initially, they are warm, genuine, and friendly once the ice is broken.\n\n3. Politeness and Punctuality\n\nPolite but Straightforward\n\nNorwegian people are polite but straightforward and honest. They value directness, and you’ll notice this in their communication. Do not be surprised if a Norwegian person provides a frank response to your question. It’s their way of being respectful, and it’s something to appreciate rather than take personally.\n\nPunctuality Matters\n\nBeing on time is critical in Norwegian society. If you have arranged to meet someone, ensure you’re not late. If you are running behind schedule, inform the other party. Punctuality is a sign of respect in Norway, reflecting your value for the other person’s time.\n\n4. The Norwegian Social Etiquette\n\nPersonal Space and Privacy\n\nAccording to Celia Wright, a lifestyle writer BeeStudent, “Norwegians value their personal space, so avoid standing too close to someone during a conversation or in a public setting. Also, respect their privacy. Personal questions about wealth, salary, or intimate details are generally not welcomed unless you’re close to the person.\n\nThe Art of Invitations\n\nIf you’re invited to a Norwegian home, it’s customary to bring a small gift, like flowers, chocolates, or a bottle of wine. Do remember to remove your shoes before entering – it’s customary practice to maintain cleanliness.\n\n5. Food and Drink Etiquette\n\nNorwegians typically eat three meals a day, with dinner being the main one. If you’re invited for a meal, wait for the host to start eating or propose a toast before you start. The most common toast is “Skål” (pronounced ‘skoal’).\n\nWhile Norway is not typically known for its cuisine, it does have unique dishes like rakfisk (fermented fish) and brunost (brown cheese).

In the spring of 1958, he launched his first collection in Oslo under the name William. As Norway’s first “fashion king”, he became very important for Norway’s domestic fashion environment. He made his debut as a costume designer in 1963 in the performance “Teenager love” at Det Nye Teater in Oslo.\n\nHis first fashion show was, however, already in 1958. With Gøsta Ekman, the older, as a godfather and a grandmother who was a famous actress, he was influenced in the direction of the stage. At the age of 17, he started dancing with the great Norwegian dancer and choreographer of the time, Rita Tori.\n\nIt was, however, his father who gave him the opportunity in the direction of design work. His father was the owner of Ebbesen og Jensen, a still-existing clothing store with a tradition dating back to the end of the 19th century. William was offered to make a display window for the store in Prinsensgate, before he became “too famous”, as his father expressed it. It must have been to the taste of both his father and the audience, and not least William himself, who thought it was fun to combine colors and fabrics. It inspired William to sign up for an international window display competition and he reached all the way to the top.\n\nLearn about an interesting up and coming Norwegian fashion designer by clicking the image below.\n\nWilliam Duborgh Jensen’s clothes were initially characterized by wild whims and sculptural, often outlandish shapes. Later he switched to a simpler, more classical style. Several of the customers came from the capital’s cultural milieu, such as actresses Wenche Foss, Lise Fjeldstad, Vibeke Løkkeberg, and not least Norway’s Queen Sonja.\n\nNorwegian Fashion designer Kristine Vikse is filling a gap.

Hopeless and young, I said: I can do that!,” recalled William. “I had never done anything or studied fashion. But I did what I told him, and when I woke up I was famous! Not least thanks to the weekly news magazine NÅ (Now).”\n\nWilliam Duborgh Jensen was the first Norwegian fashion designer to design and produce his own collections under his own name, William. He had two collections a year, and kept it going for 30 years, with some breaks with theater involvement. He collaborated with several young Norwegian designers from 1978 to 1988.\n\nHe was awarded the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav, Knight 1st Class, in 2006.\n\nAbout himself, he has written: “The truth is that I was not the least bit different from any of the others. I didn’t care one bit about clothes – and by the way, I couldn’t draw either.”\n\nWhen Norway’s first fashion king died in May 2017, his death was passed over in silence. Only his old friend, the former television personality at Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, Terje Sølsnes, wrote a memorial for William Duborg Jensen in Norway’s largest newspaper, Aftenposten.\n\nIn the months after his death, the fashion designer’s daughter, Lully Kjøsterud, cleaned out his apartment in Riddervoldsgate at Briskeby in Oslo. When she found the scrapbooks of his 30-year career as the elite’s preferred clothing designer, she had no doubts. They had to be taken care of. Former senior curator at the National Museum, Anne Kjellberg, had no doubts either.\n\nA new chapter in Norwegian fashion history was written.\n\nEarlier this year, a new international library of fashion research opened at the National Museum in Oslo.
