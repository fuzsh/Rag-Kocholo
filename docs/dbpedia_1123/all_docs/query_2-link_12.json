        "text": "Here are the emails that the library has received from different countries around the world as part of the 1999-2000 100 EMAIL PROJECT:\n\nIf you want to see the emails from schools around the world please ask to see the binder containing many of the emails.\n\nNote: Since we have no access to email in the library Cybrary Man had to gather and respond to all the emails at home.\n\nGreetings from Argentina\n\nHello, worldwide friends!\n\nWe are very happy to participate in this international project for the first time. It's very nice to know about so many groups of students in the world at the same time. We would like to answer to all of you, that´s why we are sending these 100mails.\n\nWe live in one of the towns near Buenos Aires, the capital city of Argentina. We are 21km away from the River Plate, the widest river in the world. Tourists say the BA is the city that never sleeps because discos, restaurants, pubs close at 6 o 7am every day. When we have private parties with friends and relatives, that is almost every Saturday, we always conclude them having breakfast altogether waiting for the sun to rise. Argentinians are generally very friendly people, maybe because we have Latin blood.\n\nThere are many inmigrants living in our country, especially after the second world war when many Italian and Spanish people arrived. There are also Japanese, Korean, Jewish, Polish, Ukranian communities which live in their own towns in the centre of the city. Our doors have always been open to all communities.\n\nWe are a group of 75 students that study English at Eco Center Institute, a private English Teaching school . Our ages range from 4 to 45 years old, that's why we would like to receive emails from all ages, adults too. We are divided in groups according to our ages and level of English. Some of us need the language to get a better job and some others because the level of English taught at schools is very low, except at bilingual schools which are very expensive to afford.\n\nOur school year begins in March and finishes the first week of December and we have two school shifts: the morning one starts at 7.30-8.00am and finishes at 12-12.30am; the afternoon shift starts at 1pm to 5-6pm depending on the school.\n\nWell, we hope to receive a lot more emails and we promise to send many answers too. Warm greetings from this southern city of the world famous for its delicious meat and wines!!!\n\nMrs. Silvia Canelo's classes ecocenter@sinectis.com.ar Bye, Bye.\n\nGreetings from Austria\n\nDear People,\n\nOur names are Tamara and Sabine.

It is situated on the west coast of Australia (lat 32S long 116E)The population is approximately 1.2 million. WA is one of 6 states and it is the biggest one. As Australia is nearly the same size as USA it will give you an idea of its size!However there are not that many people here.\n\nThe main revenue comes from mining - especially iron ore, gold, aluminium,oil and natural gas and also wheat, cattle and sheep.\n\nPerth is quite famous for the fact that because of its isolation from any other major city John Glenn the astronaut was able to pick us out at night from space when we all turned on our lights! He christened us the \"City of Lights\". We all lit up again for his flight again last year!\n\nOur climate is something like Los Angeles (without the smog!) We have very mild winters and very hot dry summers.It does not snow in WA as we do not have any real mountains. Our flora and fauna is unique. WA has a lot of trees and wildflowers that do not grow anywhere else in the world and tourists come especially to see our wildflowers.People imagine kangaroos hopping down the street but it is not quite like that. We do see them in the bush around suburbs like ours.\n\nHave run out of space but if you want to know more mail us!\n\nHello, from SINODAL SCHOOL SÃO LEOPOLDO/BRAZIL!\n\nWe are a group of 8th graders at Sinodal, a big school in the south of Brazil. Our school has about 1300 students and it has an alligator as a mascot. The colors of our school are green and white. Sinodal School São Leopoldo has students from kindergarten to 11th grade. The students'age ranges from 3 to 17. Our school has won many championships in sports like basketball, volleyball and athletism in our state. Here the students can also learn Spanish, German and English besides Portuguese. Spanish is important now because of the other countries in South America and the MERCOSUL. Our city, São Leopoldo, was settled by German immigrants. They arrived here using the SINOS RIVER in 1824. One of the most important holidays in São Leopoldo happens on the 25th of July, it's the date the Germans arrived here a long time ago. If you want to locate São Leopoldo on a map do this: Look at the map of Brazil; look at the southest state, Rio Grande do Sul; look for Porto Alegre, the capital; São Leopoldo is norteast the capital of the state. Our city has a river which is polluted. People in the city want to stop the pollution of the river. The city has a big private university - UNISINOS - and restaurants, a shopping center , museums and many places where young people can go. We also have a modern and new train which takes people from our city to the capital, Porto Alegre. Our city has around 200 thousand inhabitants. It is nice and beautiful! We would like to thank you for your interest in knowing more about us! Best wishes for Christmas and for the coming year! Students from Colégio Sinodal ( http://www.sinodal.com.br ) - 8th Graders\n\nHello friends around the world,\n\nWe are a group of students from English For Ever School, Brazil and we live in a hilly town called Santa Branca. It's located in São Paulo State (49º W and 23º N) with 20,000 inhabitants and 90 kilometers from São Paulo Capital. It's the only town in the State which increased in population according to the last official census. We are one hour from the ocean (North Coast) where there are four cities with very beautiful beaches. Santa Branca is in Paraiba's Valley and along this valley are located most of the country's multinational companies such as Johnson & Johnson, General Motors, Philips, Panasonic, Kodak, etc. Our town is 167 years old and its know as \"Nativity Scene\" town. By Christmas time a big \"nativity scene\" is assembled at central square in front of Matriz Church. In the surrounding area of the square , buildings from the last century can be found. In the streets we still see people selling milk in wagons pulled by horses. Sometimes some farmers lead their cattle through town taking them to another farm. Most of us are still students and go to school during the week, however twice a week we meet here at the English School, which is a private school where we come only to learn English as a foreign language. Looking forward to hearing from you soon,\n\nYour Brazilian friends\n\nGreeting from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada\n\nGreetings from Daniel McIntyre Collegiate Institute\n\nDaniel McIntyre is a public 9-12 high school in the west end of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. We have an ethnically diverse student population of about 950. We are partly inner city. Our team name is Maroons which seems to stand for no more than our main school colour (note the British spelling of color). The majority of participants in this project from DMCI will come from Dennis Fenton's grade 11 Physics and grade 10 Applied Math classes. Our web site can be found at http://www.wsd1.winnipeg.mb.ca/dmci/default.htm.\n\nWinnipeg is a city of approximately 600 000 people located at the junction of the Assiniboine and Red (of the north) Rivers. We are 100 km north of the Canada - US border and the states of North Dakota and Minnesota. Winnipeg is the capital of the province of Manitoba. The name Winnipeg is derived from the aboriginal words for muddy waters.(Not to be confused with the jazz musician;-) Winnipeg was the host city for the 1999 Pan American Games.\n\nWe are situated in a tall grass prairie biome and have a continental climate. Highs in the summer can reach 40 Celsius and winter lows can descend to -40 C. Agriculture(primarily grain and oilseed crops and cattle and hogs) is the main activity in the surrounding area while the city is home to several manufacturing industries. These include Motor Coach Industries which makes all the Greyhound buses for North America, New Flyer Industries which makes city buses for major cities throughout the continent, and a Ford/New Holland tractor plant.\n\nThe first Europeans to arrive here were French fur traders in the mid 18th century. Since then waves of immigrants from all over the world have arrived and still do to make our population one of the most diverse to be found anywhere. We celebrate our diversity in an annual festival in August called Folklarama. Over thirty different nationalities operated pavilions featuring entertainment and cuisine from their various countries of origin.\n\nGreetings from The Czech Republic\n\nGreetings from Gymnazium, Pontassievska Street, Znojmo!

There are lots of places to visit for entertainment: zoos, ice rink, aqua parks and the Entertainment City theme park. There are lots of museums too. Greetings from Marshall Islands\n\nHello, We are 6th graders from the island of Kwajalein in the Republic of Marshall Islands. It is about halfway between Hawaii and Australia at about 8 degrees latitude. It is a United States Army base that is home to the Kwajalein Missle Test Range. Our island is 1/2 mile wide by 3 miles long with 3,000 people.\n\nMost students are American citizens. There are a few Marshallese students who atttend our schools. They live on a neighboring island called Ebeye.\n\nThere are very few vehicles on island. Most people use bikes. We have only two restaurants and three stores (no malls). The temperature is usually around 80 - 85 degrees all year round. We have two seasons...the windy and rainy seasons. We have six beaches, two salt-water pools, two outdoor theaters (which are free), a rec center for kids, courts and fields for basketball, racquetball, tennis, soccer, and baseball. Lots of people enjoy deep-sea fishing, boating, wake-boarding, scuba diving,...etc. We only have two television channels. Even though our island is very small, we keep very busy!\n\nKwajalein is a coral reef formation enclosing the world's largest lagoon. There are still remains of WWII bunkers, machine guns,and other war remnants on the islands. It's a cool place to live!!\n\nCheck out our school web page at Http://www.tcsn.net/gses/GSESnew.html\n\nThe 6th graders from Kwaj :)\n\nGreeting from Netherlands\n\nHello to you all,\n\nIm teacher at a school in the Netherlands. For the ones who dont know: The Netherlands is a country in Europe. It lies at the Nortsea and its neigbours are Germany en Belgium. At the other side of the Nothsea lies Great-Brittain/ United Kingdom. Our language is Dutch. We learn English at highschool, but we dont speak it on a daily base. So, probably there will be some mistakes in my greeting, but I hope you will forgive me. A greeting in Dutch would no one appreciate, I think.\n\nMy school is in Almere. Its a middle-big town, with around 100.000 people. Almere lies in the Flevo-polder. A polder is a piece of land, that used to be water, but has been layed dry by mills etc. The Flevopolder is probably very difficult to find on a map of Europe. If you have found The Netherlands, search for Amsterdam, our capital. Then you go to the right, youll see water with in it a kind of island (it isnt really a island). That is the Flevopolder and there you will find Almere.\n\nMy school is called De Optimist. Thats the name of a little boat, in which childeren in the Netherlands could learn to sail. It also means someone who is optimistic. We are a brand new school, which started at 6 september of this year. The school is placed in a new quarter of Almere. They are building the houses now, but there are not many ready yet. So, at this moment we have very few students: only two. We hope to grow sone!!!! The students are both boys and they are 6 years old.\n\nI want to tell you much more about our school and our life in The Netherlands, but I dont make this letter too long. If you want to know more or if you want to communicate with me, please send me a email. My adres is hans.miranda@planet.nl\n\nWith lots of love,\n\nMiranda van Kessel.\n\nGreetings from Tacna, Peru.\n\nTacna is a city located to the south of Peru.

Most of the people who live on Tinian live in the southern one third of the island. The northern two thirds is still leased by the U.S. military. There are probably about 3000 people living on Tinian, today. Most of the inhabitants are Chamorro. The Chamorros are decendent from people who sailed here thousands of years ago from the Philippines and Indonesia.\n\nEven though you may have never heard of Tinian and even though it is a very small dot of land in a very big ocean, 50+ years ago Tinian was one of the most important places in the world. During the last part of World War II, Tinian was the location of the largest airbase in the world, North Field. From North Field hundreds of B-29 bombers flew missions against Japan. The Enola Gay and Boch¹s Car both took off from Tinian to drop atomic bombs on Japan.\n\nBye for now, but be sure to check out these websites for more information about our school, Tinian and the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nhttp://www.gtepacifica.net/community/tes99\n\nhttp://www.gtepacifica.net/community/jimmcc\n\nhttp://www.gtepacifica.net\n\nhttp://www.saipan.com\n\nThanks, again\n\nJim McCullough\n\nLibrarian, Tinian Elementary School\n\nGREETINGS FROM STIERNHÖÖKS SCHOOL IN RÄTTVIK, SWEDEN\n\nStiernhöök is a small school in Rättvik, which is located in Dalecarlia, in the middle of Sweden, by the lake Siljan.
