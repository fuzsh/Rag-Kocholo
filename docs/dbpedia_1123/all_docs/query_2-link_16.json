Tromso after all, and despite its Italian sounding name, is situated some 350 kilometres (217 mi) inside the Arctic Circle. This \"Paris of The North\" and has an impressive history, and is currently home to some of the musicians from the legendary Rokysopp. That is all pretty cool, and well, considering it might be a few degrees below zero, perhaps cool is an understatement.\"\n\n\"More personally, since we arrive the night before our set, I hope to see the mysterious Aurora Borealis - Tromso by all accounts should be the kind of place where we get more than a glimpse. I do hope to get lucky with that.\"\n\n\"But enough of what we are looking forward to, what can people expect who come along to see us take part in this festival of music, what can they look forward to from us? Well, the band has been on great form over the last months and I expect that will continue as we play a set that will highlight songs from our entire history. Plus, this is a one  off as already said, it is also a first time as stated.\"\n\n\"That all means we will most probably attack it with full force, summoning up the positive energy with us, and play with our fullest enthusiasm.\"\n\n\"When that happens it can quite impressive  or so it has been said.\" - Jim\n\n\"Over and out! Thanks to all who made our first ever set In Tromso a success. Great venue, great crowd, fine organisation from Siggi and all the promoters team. I did not get to see the Northern Lights unfortunately, but once again I got to feel the thrill of being in the middle of it all when the band is playing so good. There is a level of energy about Simple Minds presently that is more evident than ever before and I am already looking forward to the summer shows - we want to improve always.\"\n\n\"At one point tonight, when the crowd was making a lot of noise, I encouraged them further by holding out the microphone and saying \"Go on then - let them hear you in Oslo\" (More than 1000km away?) Unfortunately a few people only heard the Oslo word and I guess thought that I had lost my bearings. Well no actually, or at least not this time. Tromso was special, uniquely so, and we will back for sure.\" - Jim\n\nDanube Island Festival, Vienna, Austria\n\n5x5 + Hits Set\n\nMain Set: Moscow Underground / I Travel / Love Song / Celebrate / This Fear Of Gods / Waterfront / Hunter And The Hunted / The American / Big Sleep / See The Lights / Don't You (Forget About Me) / Someone Somewhere (In Summertime) / Promised You A Miracle / Glittering Prize / New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84)\n\nEncore: Alive And Kicking\n\nThis was a free concert and was delay-broadcast by Austrian channel ORF3.\n\nSanctify Yourself was on the set-list but was dropped due to time constraints, and Don't You (Forget About Me) was also going to be an encore but was moved into the main-set.\n\n\"It's all a bit of a blur!\"\n\n\"Some give 100% even in rehearsals, playing each song as though lives depended on it. Mel, Andy and Ged are in that category. Charlie and I are... uh... not quite the same types. Learning and knowing the arrangements is quite enough in our case, plus it genuinely seems we would rather hold back until an audience is in front of us. We can afford to be a little bit casual of course, especially when the others are sounding so on it!\"\n\n\"There will be an audience in front of us in Vienna on Saturday when we start the first of the summer outdoor shows. Forecast to be hot and sweaty also. Has a year really passed so quick since last summer's shows? I guess so. But it is all a blur.\" - Jim\n\n\"The new songs always take over me. Utopia - not even finished written yet but feels so powerful. I reckon we should play it when we turn up in Vienna in a few days. Who cares if it's not perfect - especially when it feels like it is?\" - Jim, 19th June 2012\n\nThanks to Lionello for the pictures and set-list.\n\n\"Ever get asked when are you at the most the happiest? I do, and I know the answer. We kicked off tour summer dates in Vienna and judging by this picture that was taken in the first song, seemingly I am trying hard to surpress the obvious joy involved in being part of a \"real live band.\" The biggest pleasure though is seeing some of those familiar faces who travel far and wide, showing great commitment as they encourage us on and on and on and on. Thank you to all who gave us the fine start on a quite beautiful night in Austria! As for the summer dates to come, I'd say we are ready and fighting fit.\" - Jim, 25th June 2012\n\nMain Square Festival, Arras, France\n\n5x5 Festival Set\n\nMain Set: Moscow Underground / I Travel / Love Song / Celebrate / This Fear Of Gods / Waterfront / The American / See The Lights / Don't You (Forget About Me) / Someone Somewhere (In Summertime) / Promised You A Miracle / New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84)\n\nThanks to Paola for the photos. Many more here.\n\nRock Werchter, Werchter, Belgium\n\n5x5 Festival Set\n\nMain Set: Moscow Underground / I Travel / Love Song / Celebrate / This Fear Of Gods / Waterfront / The American / Don't You (Forget About Me) / Someone Somewhere (In Summertime) / New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84)\n\nEncore: Alive And Kicking\n\nThanks to Peter for the photos.\n\n\"Off to a good start! Vienna, Arras, and Werchter have all gone very well and we are feeling in quite good shape for Scotland and T in the Park next weekend. But first we head to Moscow and St. Petersburg for some promo and plenty of \"recreational.\" Thanks as always to everybody who has encouraged Simple Minds at the festivals with their wonderful support. Werchter was a real special one!\" - Jim, 2nd July 2012\n\nThe band were surprise special guests at the White Nights of Saint Petersburg in Russia. It looks like they performed to studio playbacks of Alive And Kicking, Don't You (Forget About Me) and Sanctify Yourself (with Sarah on backing vocals).\n\nMany thanks to Sebastien for the image.\n\nT In The Park, Balado, UK\n\n5x5 Festival Set\n\nMain Set: Waterfront / Love Song / Celebrate / Don't You (Forget About Me) / New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84) / Alive And Kicking\n\n\"In a way we grew up playing festivals, I think the first festival we played was in 1979 in Holland to around 12,000 people which seemed collosal at the time and through the years well, I'd love to know how many festivals we've played, but ironically we've never played 'T in the Park' in our home country until now. As many people will know 'T in the Park' is part of the Scottish cultural landscape and we finally got to play it today. Typically enough the weather wasn't in anybody's favour but it was a great experience and we're already looking forward to next time.\" - Jim 7th July 2012\n\n\"Arrived in late last night from a baking hot St. Petersburg to a vey wet and very \"dreich\" Edinburgh. With the weather not set to change my heart goes out to the 85,000 who will be at T in The Park Festival. Without doubt we are also set for a soaking - I definitely am - but I could not care less. It's an honour to play for people. We will give all that we have, then it its on the tour bus and direct to Newcastle for tomorrows 5x5 gig. That one is in doors thankfully. - Jim 7th July 2012\n\n\"Another festival we can tick off as done. How do we feel? Great bands should be able to do it regardless of the conditions, somehow I feel the weather snatched away what could have been a glorious one. Ah well! Good points? The audience who could put up with those conditions and still have a good time are the real stars. Downside? I can't help it, but for me I dislike being so far from the crowd. Walkways etc would have brought us much closer and we need that contact.

Audiences in general, have always welcomed us, showing the kind of appreciation that many acts would die for and making us feel that we want to give more of ourselves in return. Getting many positive reviews in the media as we have been recently, is taking a little time to get used to.\"\n\n\"The reason for that is frankly for the longest time it seemed that no one in print had anything good to say about us whatsoever. Was that a hurtful experience? Hmmm, it was certainly a confusing experience, but it was even possible to get used to disappointments and the Pariah role was just something we needed to deal with somehow.\"\n\n\"Not that we are or were ever above criticism, then again who is? And I can clearly recall a period where looking back now I would shamefully concede that we might not have been doing all necessary to engage in ways that are necessary, particularly if you want to stay on top of your game as a live act. They were blips however, least in my view. And again, it is perhaps expecting too much that you could just glide through a career that has lasted for 35 years without periods of stagnation.\"\n\n\"Stagnation is a term that hopefully was the last thing to spring up in anyones mind that came to see us in Newcastle on Sunday night. What a great atmosphere in the venue, both band and crowd feeding off an energy that reminded me of shows that we did in Newcastle way back in the early 80s. No mere flashback however, the set may have consisted of songs that belie their age, but again in my view, and indeed some of the fans I spoke with afterwards and on the train to London the next morning, there is something altogether fresh in what is coming across from Simple Minds on stage currently.\"\n\n\"Long may it continue, please!\" - Jim 10th July 2012\n\nThanks to Claudia for the photos and the ticket.\n\nTrain, Aarhus, Denmark\n\n5x5 Full Set\n\nMain Set Part #1: I Travel / 30 Frames A Second / Today I Died Again / Life In A Day / Calling Your Name / Hunter And The Hunted / Premonition / Wasteland / Love Song / Pleasantly Disturbed / Room\n\nMain Set Part #2: The American / In Trance As Mission / 70 Cities As Love Brings The Fall / Celebrate / Changeling / Factory / This Fear Of Gods / Promised You A Miracle / Someone Somewhere (In Summertime)\n\nEncore: Theme For Great Cities / Someone / Chelsea Girl / Glittering Prize / New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84)\n\nDalhalla, Rattvik, Sweden\n\n5x5 Festival Set\n\nMain Set: Moscow Underground / I Travel / Love Song / Celebrate / This Fear Of Gods / Waterfront / The American / Big Sleep / See The Lights / Don't You (Forget About Me) / Someone Somewhere (In Summertime) / Sanctify Yourself / Glittering Prize / New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84)\n\nEncore: Theme For Great Cities / Alive And Kicking / Ghostdancing - Gloria\n\n\"Dalhalla in Sweden is possibly the most amazing venue I have ever seen. Ranks alongside Teatro Greco in Sicily and even Red Rocks in Denver. Words escape as to how magic the place is. What other venue affords you the opportunity to go play in the heart of a quarry full of ancient stone and afterwards go skinny dipping in the most amazing little emerald coloured lake - as I did last night.
