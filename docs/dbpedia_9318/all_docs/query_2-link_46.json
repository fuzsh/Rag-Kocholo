The sitting is open and today the Court will begin the\n\nhearing of the witnesses and witness-experts called by Serbia and Montenegro. A number of these\n\nwitnesses and witness-experts will speak in Serbian. In accordance with Article 70, paragraph 2, of\n\nthe Rules of Court, Serbia and Montenegro h as made arrangements for consecutive interpretation\n\nfrom Serbian into one of the official languages of the Court, English or French. The Registry of the\n\nCourt will then provide simultaneous interpretation into the other official language. The statements\n\nand questions of the Agents and counsel of the Par ties in English or French will be interpreted into\n\nSerbian for the benefit of the witness or witnexpert. The same procedure will be followed,\n\nmutatis mutandis, for any instructions I may wish to give to the witness or witness-expert and for\n\nquestions that may be put, in English or French, to the witness or witness-expert by the President\n\non behalf of the Court or by individual judges. Purs uant to Article 70, paragraph 2, of the Rules of\n\nCourt, the Registry will verify the interpretation ca rried out by the interpreters appointed by Serbia\n\nand Montenegro.\n\nI now request the interpreters appointed by Se rbia and Montenegro to make the declaration\n\nprovided for in Article 70, paragraph 4, of the Rules of Court. Ms Končar-Nikolić.\n\nMKmOeN ČAR-NIKOLIĆ : Je déclare solennellement, en tout honneur et en toute\n\nconscience, que mon interpretration sera fidèle et complète.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Je vous remercie. Ms Kraljević.\n\nKMRs LJEVI Ć: I solemnly declare upon my honour and conscience that my interpretation\n\nwill be faithful and complete.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Thank you. Ms Nikčević.\n\nNMIs ČEVIĆ: I solemnly declare upon my honour and conscience that my interpretation\n\nwill be faithful and complete.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Thank you. Mr. Pavlović. - 11 -\n\nPAMV.LOVI Ć : Je déclare solennellement, en tout honneur et en toute conscience, que mon\n\ninterpretration sera fidèle et complete.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Je vous remercie.\n\nThe first witness to be called by Serbia and Montenegro is Mr. Vladimir Lukić. The witness\n\nmay now be brought into court. I would also requ est the interpreter to take her place next to the\n\nwitness.\n\n[Witness enters and takes his place at the rostrum]\n\nI call upon Mr. Luki ć to take the solemn declaration for witnesses, as laid down in\n\nArticle 64 (a), of the Rules of Court.\n\nLMUr.KI Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : I solemnly declare upon my honour and\n\nconscience that I will speak the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Thank you. I would like to remind the witness to pause regularly, in\n\norder to allow for the consecutive interpretation. I now give the floor to Mr. Brownlie to begin his\n\nexamination of the witness.\n\nMr. BROWNLIE: If I could invite the witness to address the Court, make his statement and\n\nI would propose that he speaks directly to the Court and not towards me.\n\nLUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: Madam President, honourable judges, thank you\n\nfor having given me this opportunity to make my statement. I wish to offer to you my most cordial\n\ngreetings.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Please continue.\n\nLUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: My name is Vladimir Lukić. I was born in 1933,\n\nin the village of Tabar Sanski Most municipality. I graduated at the Department of Geology of the\n\nFaculty of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geol ogy in Zagreb in 1961. I attained my PhD at\n\nthe Faculty of Civil Engineering in Sarajevo in 199 0. I am one of the founders of the Faculty of\n\nArchitecture and Civil Engineering in Banja Luka and was the Dean of that faculty from 1996 to\n\n2002.\n\nOn 1 July 1992, until 19 December 1992, I was the representative of Republika Srpska to\n\nUNPROFOR in Sarajevo and as of 20 January 1993 to 18 August 1994, I was the Prime Minister - 12 -\n\nof Republika Srpska. As an expert, I participated in the peace negotiations in Dayton in 1995. I\n\nam a member of the Commission on the Delimitation of the boundaries of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nand neighbouring States.\n\nIn my statement today I shall seek to present my perception of the events which took place in\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina during the war. I will also speak about the work of organs of Republika\n\nSrpska, about our relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavi a and with other entities within\n\nthe framework of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I hope that my statement today, which I am making as\n\nthe former Prime Minister of RepublikaSrpska a nd today a citizen of Republika Srpska and of\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina, will assist the Court to establish the full truth about the events which\n\ntranspired in the past in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nEver since its inception in 1992 Republika Sr pska, then under the name of the Serbian\n\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, featured a ll elements of statehood except for international\n\nrecognition. Throughout its entire territory it ha d its bodies of government, its national assembly,\n\nits government, its local and/or municipal bodies of government, its judiciary, its health and\n\neducational systems. Also RepublikaSrpska ha d its own banking and financial systems reflected\n\nin the existence of a national bank, its own currency, budget, payment operation service.\n\nRepublika Srpska also had its army and police with a complete system of command and logistical\n\nsupport to those structures. The statehood of Re publikaSrpska was not disputable during the\n\nconducting of numerous international negotiations. Republika Srpska was recognized also through\n\nthe Washington Croat and Muslim Agreements and received final recognition under the Dayton\n\nParis Peace Accords.\n\nThe Government of Republika Srpska that I was the Prime Minister of from 20 January 1993\n\nuntil 18 August 1994 was the highest executive orga n of government. During my premiership, we\n\nheld 44sessions. For the duration of the tenure of this government in the area of Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina there was an ongoing war.\n\nThe basic task of the Government was to en able the bodies of Republika Srpska to function\n\nand to ensure the protection of and basic living conditions for its population. The situation was\n\nvery difficult due to the international embargo. Republika Srpska was flooded by refugees from\n\nthe areas of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as from Croatia. - 13 -\n\nEven in the difficult conditions of war, the G overnment found ways to also deal with other\n\nmatters, those of legislation, the work of the ec onomy of the health and educational systems and\n\nspecial attention was devoted to transport and communications.\n\nWe also sought to combat crime which in the existing war setting and given the difficult\n\neconomic situation constituted one of the major problems that Republika Srpska was confronted\n\nwith. A large number of volunteers arrived in the territory of Republika Srpska among whom a\n\nnumber of individuals who capitalized on the war for personal gain and the commission of criminal\n\noffences. Within the ambit of our powers we sought to fight against such practices but regrettably\n\nwere not entirely successful.\n\nThe Government worked pursuant to the Constitution and laws. In its work the Government\n\nwas independent. As the Prime Minister, I can say that there was absolutely no interference in the\n\nwork of the Government on the part of any individual or organ from Serbia or Yugoslavia.\n\nThe autonomy and the recognition of Repub lika Srpska were also reflected in the\n\nnegotiations conducted with representatives of the international community. All the negotiations\n\nthat were conducted with a view to stopping the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina were conducted by\n\nauthorized representatives of Republika Srpska w ith the Government being regularly informed\n\nabout their course at sessions of the Assembly of Republika Srpska.\n\nThe negotiations for a peaceful settlement of the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina that lasted\n\nfor a number of years started with a Cutiliero pl an which was rejected owing to the negative\n\nposition of AlijaIzetbegovi ć, whereby the chance to avoid war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was\n\nlost.\n\nA second peace plan which led to serious conflic ts in relations with the Federal Republic of\n\nYugoslavia as well as to numerous adverse consequences for Republika Srpska was the\n\nVance-Owen peace plan which the Assembly of Republika Srpska rejected.\n\nThe consequences of this decision of Republik a Srpska on our relations with the Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia were obvious. After th e rejection of the Vance-Owen plan, political\n\nleaders of Republika Srpska were not allowed to travel in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and\n\nthe level of economic co-operation was significantly reduced. - 14 -\n\nOnly a year later when the Assembly of Republika Srpska rejected the Contact Group peace\n\nplan as well, sanctions were imposed on the Drin a River, overseen by United Nations observers,\n\nand they made the functioning of Republika Srpska and the life of its citizens exceptionally\n\ndifficult. During the sanctions, it was only humanita rian aid that we received from the Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia.\n\nMs KORNER: I am sorry, there is one procedural matter.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Yes, Ms Korner.\n\nMs KORNER: The witness is reading his prep ared statement at speed. The interpreter\n\nclearly has an English translation and is reading th at at speed. I am totally unable to take proper\n\nnotes of what he is saying, some of which may be important. I wonder if it would be possible for\n\nme to have a copy of the statement in English?\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Thank you. Does such a copy exist? It does not, but I will ask, as it does\n\nnot exist, if the witness can speak more slowly, so that counsel for Bosnia and Herzegovina can\n\nindeed take a note. It may not be necessary fo r the witness to speak more slowly, but for the\n\ninterpreter so to do. Thank you.\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : During the sanctions, it was only humanitarian\n\naid that we received from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nI believe that at this point I should mention that it has never been possible to forbid the\n\ncitizens of Serbia to have their relatives living in difficult conditions on the territory of Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina. The fact is that 90per cent of the aid which came from Serbia came from places\n\nwhere settlers originating from Bosnia and Herzegovina lived. Even today there is no doubt that in\n\nSerbia there lived more Serbs hailing from Bosnia and Herzegovina than there live Serbs in Bosnia\n\nand Herzegovina itself. For example, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, many renowned scholars, public\n\nfigures, as well as eminent representatives of Serbia were born: such as the late Prime Minister of\n\nthe Republic of Serbia, Mr. Zoran Djindjić, or the current President of Serbia, Mr. Boris Tadić.\n\nUntil the proclamation of the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as its\n\ninternational recognition in April 1992, the Serb pe ople in Bosnia and Her zegovina considered the\n\nYugoslav People’s Army its army. At that time the Yugoslav Peopl e’s Army was mainly\n\ncomposed of officers and soldiers of Serb ethnicity from the area of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This - 15 -\n\nsituation was the result of earlier decisions of Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegović for all Croat and\n\nMuslim soldiers and officers to lead the Yugos lav People’s Army and join the newly formed\n\nNational Army. After the decision of the Fe deral Republic of Yugos lavia for the Yugoslav\n\nPeople’s Army to withdraw from the area of Bosnia and Herzegovina the Assembly of the Serbian\n\nRepublic adopted on 12May1992, in Banja Luka, the decision to form the army of Republika\n\nSrpska. The army of Republika Srpska was esta blished only after the two other peoples in Bosnia\n\nand Herzegovina had a established their armies. After the withdrawal of the Yugoslav People’s\n\nArmy, most of the former Yugoslav People’s Army officers from the area of Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina joined the newly formed army of Republika Srpska.\n\nThe army of Republika Srpska was the army of the Serb people in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\n\nand its work and activities were entirely manage d by organs of Republika Srpska in accordance\n\nwith the Constitution of Republika Srpska and other laws regulating this subject-matter. No one\n\nelse could have, and to my knowledge, did not ev en attempt to command the army of Republika\n\nSrpska.\n\nAs regards the armaments of the army of Republika Srpska, it is known that the Socialist\n\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia’s strategic plan of defence envisaged that its focus should be in the\n\narea of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is why there was in Bosnia and Herzegovina a huge quantity\n\nof weaponry and combat hardware, and especially so, after the withdrawal of the Yugoslav\n\nPeople’s Army from Slovenia, Croatia and Macedonia. Apart from that, there existed in Bosnia\n\nand Herzegovina also considerable production cap acity for military equipment and armament.\n\nDespite the fact that they were leaving Bosnia and Herzegovina in the month of May1992, the\n\nYugoslav People’s Army had taken with it a signifi cant quantity of armament and equipment. A\n\ngood part of those armaments were made in Bosn ia and Herzegovina and constituted the basis for\n\nthe armies of all the three peoples.\n\nThroughout the war, the Republika Srpska manufactured weapons in its production facilities,\n\na part of which, the semi-finished product would be finished in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n\nand as such, exchanged with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. According to data at my\n\ndisposal, the army of Republika Srpska mainly paid for the military materiel which it obtained from\n\nother States. It is a fact that the army of Republika Srpska was supplied from different sources - 16 -\n\noutside Republika Srpska, including but not limited to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. I need\n\nnot particularly emphasize that there existed di fferent smuggling channels supplying all the three\n\nwarring parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina. When Trnovo, a small town some 20km south of\n\nSarajevo, was liberated, ammunition manufactured in the Prvi Partizan plant from Užice in Serbia\n\nwas found at Muslim positions. At the beginning of the war, Muslims shelled the position of the\n\narmy of Republika Srpska, with shells manuf actured in the Pretis factory from Vogoš ća in\n\nRepublika Srpska, in fact, manufactured only two days prior to their use.\n\nDuring my term of office as the Prime Minister of Republika Srpska, I had numerous\n\ncontacts with representatives of the Autonomous Republic of Western Bosnia, at the helm of which\n\nwas President Fikret Abdi ć. We were not at war with him, but rather had good relations and\n\nco-operated. I met with Mr. Abdić twice: once in Velika Kladuša, at the meeting also attended by\n\nthe President of Herceg-Bosna, which is the Croat entity, Mr. Jadranko Prlić.\n\nMy second meeting with Mr. Abdi ć was at Vojnić. The topics at these meetings concerned\n\nprimarily humanitarian issues, medical treatment of the wounded and of citizens generally, as well\n\nas the promotion of economic relations between the Autonomous Republic of Western Bosnia and\n\nRepublika Srpska. We did as much as we coul d to help the population of the Autonomous\n\nRepublic of Western Bosnia.\n\nDuring my term of office, from June1993, we also established relations with the\n\nGovernment of Herceg-Bosna, the entity of the Croat people in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In\n\nrelation to these relations a large number of meetings were held namely, at Livansko Polje, Kupres,\n\nLivlno, Banja Luka and in other places. In the difficult conditions following the severance of our\n\nrelations with the Republic of Serbia, Her ceg-Bosna made it possible for us to import a\n\nconsiderable quantity of fuel which was necessary for agricultural work, as well as for the needs of\n\nthe army of Republika Srpska. On its part, the Re publika Srpska made it possible for several tens\n\nof thousands of Croat refugees from Vareš, Kakanj , Central Bosnia and Usora who had left their\n\nhomes during the Croat-Muslim conflict in 1993, to be saved from almost certain death. After the\n\nMuslim offensive that had expelled them from the area of Central Bosnia, these refugees were\n\ntaken in and accommodated in the area of Republika Srpska and those who so wished were enabled - 17 -\n\nsafe passage to the territory of the Republic of Cr oatia. A very important agreement concerned the\n\nexchange of prisoners on the “All for All” principle as well as a ceasefire.\n\nThe objective of all negotiations with re presentatives of the autonomous Republic of\n\nWestern Bosnia and of Herceg-Bosna, was to stop the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nRegrettably, the Muslim side did not respond to this initiative and sought a solution in continuing\n\nthe war conflict.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Mr. Brownlie, do you wish to examine now.\n\nMr. BROWNLIE: Thank you, Madam President. Mr. Lukić, I thank you for your statement.\n\nI have one or two questions to ask and the first is: could you please describe to the Court the\n\nfinancial sources of Republika Srpska?\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: If I were to be truly sincere, I would say that we\n\nhad . . . that they were from all over the place. However, the basic sources of finance were taxes,\n\ncontributions and customs duties. Also it was expor ts of different raw materials, namely, forestry\n\nproducts, mining products, as well as exports of electrical energy, electrical power. Specifically\n\nspeaking, we sold electrical energy to Serbia, Montenegro and Croatia . We also floated loans. In\n\naddition to that we received donations, both from our own citizens as well as from our friends the\n\nworld over. We also exported a number of processi ng industry products to four or five European\n\ncountries. And, as I have already said, ther e were donations from our citizens; there was\n\nassistance which was forthcoming from different indi vidual countries, and so on. I would just like\n\nto mention that during the war our industrial pl ants, in fact, operated at a much higher level\n\ncapacity than was the case for many years following the end of the war.\n\nMr. BROWNLIE: Thank you. Mr. Luki ć, would you please describe your role in the peace\n\nnegotiations at Dayton?\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : Talking about Dayton, let me first say that our\n\noverall situation in Republika Srpska was exceptionally difficult.\n\nLet me not go into a description of all the fo rces that we lost significant territories to.\n\nRepublika Srpska was swamped by refugees of whom about 80,000 from the Bosnian Kraijina.\n\nAnd also from the Serbian Krajina ⎯ that is, from Croatia ⎯ over 200,000 Serbs fled. And - 18 -\n\nalthough of that number, except for perhaps 40,000, all left for Serbia. It was nevertheless an\n\nenormous burden for Republika Srpska.\n\nHowever, the Contact Group requested that Republika Srpska decide who would represent it\n\nat Dayton. The Assembly of Republika Srps ka decided that Republika Srpska was to be\n\nrepresented at Dayton by Slobodan Miloševi ć. Representatives of Republika Srpska should form\n\npart of the single Yugoslav delegation. The Speak er of the Assembly, the Minister for Foreign\n\nAffairs, the Vice-President, two jurists and two outside experts on different fields.\n\nThe negotiations themselves in Dayton were quite lengthy and, in my opinion, the basic\n\nreason for that is that everybody there actually a dvanced maximalist request s. There were even\n\nsome requests which were based on aspirations and unrealized in the war, which parties sought to\n\nrealize in Dayton. The negotiations were lengthy . All options were on the table. There was\n\nintensive diplomatic and lobbying activity and, as far as I know, in the end the United States\n\ndelegate imposed an agreement that no one was actually happy with and perhaps it is good that no\n\none was satisfied with it.\n\nMr. BROWNLIE: Thank you. My last question is that I am instructed that you spent the\n\nyear 1992 in Sarajevo. Could you please explain to the Court your view of the situation in\n\nSarajevo in that period?\n\nMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : As the entire Yugoslavia, so was Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina and Sarajevo, in particular, a beau tiful and tranquil place until national parties were\n\nestablished. After that rifts, divisions, along ethni c lines could be felt. That situation was fuelled\n\nby the Islamic Declaration of Alija Izetbegović as well, and also by his statement when he said that\n\nhe would sacrifice peace for the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nUnfortunately the first killing started of citizens in the streets, of troops in their barracks, in\n\nthe streets, in the army hall, in the hospital, etc. The killing of a five-member fami⎯ of course\n\nyou know who that is ⎯ only added fuel to the fire. I am not going to indicate the actual places\n\nwhere the different killings took place, where people got killed. I am sure that you have heard very\n\nmuch about that.\n\nOne more date I believe it was 16 May I happened to be on the slopes, the northern slopes of\n\nVrace. I looked on as police forces and other military units were attacking the settlement of Gornja - 19 -\n\nPofalići and on that day they expelled 6,000 Serbs, and 100 villagers went missing, and their\n\ndestiny is not known to this day.\n\nGiven the profession that I have, I know Sa rajevo and I know the whole of Bosnia and\n\nHerzegovina well. I was the director of three in stitutions there and as the Director of the Geodesy\n\nadministration, I was also the founder of the Chair of Geodesy at the faculty there and worked as a\n\nteacher in that department from 1976. I, of cour se, have the map of Sarajevo in front of me to\n\nconsult and look at. Sarajevo at the time was a divided city and shooting had already begun.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Mr. Lukić, I can see your interpreter would like you to pause.\n\nMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : Among the things I could see there was one\n\nwhich was the saddest of all and which evoked an experience from my early childhood when I was\n\nonly eight years old, and could witness for myself the execution by firing squad of 5,000Serbs,\n\nJews and Roma, and it occurred to me, not once, that it was indeed a privilege to die by a bullet\n\ngiven the circumstances which obtain in the Sarajevo of that day.\n\nOtherwise, I was not a member of any party and, as of the 1990s, I was a university professor\n\ncharged with the setting up of organs of governme nt and it was my opinion that the organs of\n\ngovernment should be established at a point from the pre-war deputies. I was assigned by a\n\ndecision to be the representative of Republika Sr pska to UNPROFOR and I went there in that\n\ncapacity on 1 July 1992. I was confronted havi ng assumed that position with a series of problems\n\nwhich I was not at all well prepared to address to resolve. For instance, I was to resolve the way of\n\nenabling people to exit Sarajevo, or to save peopl e who were accused of different things, whereas\n\nthe war had not even started. One of my tasks was to enable the exit from the city of different\n\nconvoys, including those of the children’s embassy, of the International Red Cross, the Jewish\n\nconvoy, the Catholic Church convoy with nuns, and I must tell you that I did my utmost indeed to\n\nenable these people to leave. I received between 10 and 200 people daily a nd many of them were\n\nbeaten up, many of them had been to prison, but all of them were very much afraid. So, this\n\nparticularly referred to Serbs, because other people managed to find ways to leave Sarajevo, but the\n\nSerbs were not allowed to leave. And if they di d leave, they only did so in various clandestine\n\nways. - 20 -\n\nThe PRESIDENT: We will pause there while th ere is a change of interpreters...\n\nMr.Brownlie we have gone quite far from your question. We appear to be having a further\n\nstatement.\n\nMr. BROWNLIE: Could I ask the witness to conclude his statement on the question I\n\nactually asked. Thank you, Madam President.\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : What I want to say is that at that time many\n\nprisons were established in Sarajevo and some of them could be well described as camps. I was\n\naware of the existence of many such prisons and camps, but a year ago, the Association of Former\n\nPrisoners and Inmates of such prisons and camps collected documentation that testified to the\n\nexistence of 126 such prisons and institutions , and they submitted this documentation to\n\nMrs. Carla del Ponte.\n\nSarajevo was a divided city from the very outset of the war, but it was not a blocked city as\n\nmany are trying to say. The eastern part of Sarajevo was blocked by the army of Republika Srpska\n\nbecause there were some very important military point s that it had to occupy in that part of the\n\ntown. But on the other hand, the Muslim army had also a dominant position in the northern part,\n\nthe north-western part, the southern part and the s outh-western part of the other western section of\n\nthe city.\n\nMr. BROWNLIE: Yes, could I intervene. Madam President has indicated there are time\n\nconstraints so if you could explain to our witness that he really must conclude quite soon.\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: Well, I could go on speaking very, very long and\n\nfor hours if I were to describe every single deta il that I know about the events that took place in\n\nSarajevo. But, instead, perhaps I can just men tion that one very brave woman wrote a book about\n\neverything that happened there and the title of that book iDon’t cry for Sarajevo . Perhaps that\n\nwould be best read to see what happened there. But I think that I should better wrap up and close\n\nwhat I have to say. Yes, so thank you very much.\n\nMr. BROWNLIE: Madam President, I have concluded my examination-in-chief.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Brownlie. I now give the floor to MsKorner for\n\ncross-examination. - 21 -\n\nMs KORNER: Mr. Luki ć, I want to make it clear to you out of fairness that there are many\n\nassertions that you have made in your written stat ement which are not accepted. But the time is\n\nlimited and therefore I can only deal with a few of them. I would ask therefore because of the time\n\nlimitations that you try and answer any questions I ask as shortly as possible. I want to start with\n\nwhere you ended ⎯ Sarajevo. Do you accept that Sarajevo was shelled by forces of the Bosnian\n\nSerb army over a period of years?\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : Sarajevo was a protected area. But from that\n\narea Serb positions around Sarajevo, and especial ly one settlement which my family comes\n\nfrom ⎯ and I have mentioned it and its name is Grbavica ⎯ came under incessant fire from\n\nSarajevo.\n\nWell, as I was trying to explain, different in stitutions came under fire, such as the hospital,\n\nthe children’s care centre, the faculty where I ta ught. And I intervened on many occasions with\n\nUNPROFOR that it was unacceptable that a car that was approaching would start firing only to\n\nattract the fire from the other side. If we take in to account that about 50,000 soldiers were then in\n\nSarajevo, that there were also other armed gr oups, paramilitary groups, a terrorist group called\n\nSeve or Larks that was formed on the direct orders of Alija Izetbegovic in May . . .\n\nThe PRESIDENT: May I interrupt you, Mr. Luki ć? Do you understand that counsel has to\n\nbe allocated equal time for cross-examination and that means that the questions should be answered\n\nas succinctly as is possible, and you were asked a very specific question . . . Thank you. I give the\n\nfloor now to Ms Korner.\n\nMs KORNER: Mr. Lukić, that was a very simple question which admits of an answer “yes”\n\nor “no”. And I will ask it once more and ask for a simple answer: do you accept that Sarajevo was\n\nshelled by Bosnian Serb forces over a period of years?\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : As a rule, the Bosnian Serb army shelled only\n\nmilitary targets in the city. Contrary to the rles of war, the authorities in Sarajevo had never\n\nseparated military from civilian targets and because of that, on sever al occasions, there were errors\n\nin shelling.\n\nMs KORNER: So, you do not accept that at any stage the Bosnian Serb forces deliberately\n\nfired on civilians. Is that right? And the answer should be yes or no, please. - 22 -\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: Well, thank you for the advice, but I think that\n\nnobody in Sarajevo, on either side, had been able to assess, or measure, or say afterwards that this\n\nshell should have been fired and this one should not have been fired.\n\nMs KORNER: Alright. Well, I want to move on to a different topic. Madam President, I\n\nhave forgotten at what time you would be taking a break?\n\nThe PRESIDENT: We will continue right through your cross-examination.\n\nMs KORNER: I want to turn to the topic of finance. You told the Court in your prepared\n\nstatement that Republika Srpska had its own banking system, budget ⎯ and you went so fast that I\n\ndid not catch the rest ⎯ but that is what you are saying, is it?\n\nAre you saying that your financial system was wholly independent of any support from the\n\nFederal Republic?\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : Well, I have to say that I regret the fact that\n\nRepublika Srpska had no other possibility, or no ot her ways, of financing itself, unlike the Muslim\n\nState which, on 8 June 1992, received a donation from King Fahd to the amount of 8 billion dollars\n\nfor the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. And we did not have recourse to such resources and we\n\nhad no other source of financing and we had to rely on our own sources; and because of that we\n\nfound that we had huge inflation because of what we could do at the time to make ends meet.\n\nMs KORNER: Mr. Lukić, I did not ask you how the government in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nfinanced itself, I asked you whether or not you were saying that you were independent of the\n\nFederal Republic. Do I take it from your answer that the answer is no: that you were dependent on\n\nthem?\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: Yes.\n\nMs KORNER: It may be my fault: he sai d yes and you said yes. But you were dependent\n\non the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, were you not?\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: No.\n\nMs KORNER: Alright. Do you rememb er your budget in 1993, published in the Gazette in\n\n1994, 25 March?\n\nThe PRESIDENT: The answer is clearly no. Are you going to provide the witness with a\n\nsheet? - 23 -\n\nMs KORNER: I am going to provide the in terpreter, because I have got the English\n\ntranslation, once I have put the figures to him.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Yes, but the interpreter w ill only be able to answer what the witness\n\nsays, and the witness needs to see the document.\n\nMs KORNER: I will give the document; as I say, it is the English translation.\n\nAlright. Because of the timing, can I put it to you that the budget amounted to some\n\n732million Dinars, of which 731 was credit from th e Federal Republic of Yugoslavia? I should\n\nhave said billion, I said million. Do you agree with that?\n\nMy suggestion is very simple, which can be seen on the document: it is that the total budget\n\npublished in the Gazette on 30March1994 was slightly in excess of 732,000 billion Dinars. Of\n\nwhich credit ⎯ do you agree with this, Mr.Luki ć ⎯ of which credit, from the National Bank of\n\nYugoslavia in Belgrade amounted to over 729,000 billion Dinars.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Mr. Lukić, are you in a position to respond to the question?\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: First of all I have to say, and note, that it was not\n\ntaken into account when quoting such figures that th ere was hyper, hyper inflation at the time. On\n\nthe other hand you adopt a budget a year earlier than . . . And this is a restructuring of the budget.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Let us pause because we want to get the exact words you are saying.\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: I cannot say, just by looking at the figures. It is\n\nnot sufficient for me to say whether or not this was truly the case because I cannot say by just\n\nsimply looking whether this was the case of hyper-inflation or whether we just printed the\n\nmoney ⎯ which we, in effect, did all the time ⎯ or whether it was the money that we have already\n\nspent, because in 1993 we had to live on something. You cannot expect anybody to live on air or\n\njust on water. I cannot say whether these were credits from the National Bank of Yugoslavia\n\nbecause, simply, we did not need to take the credits because, as I explained, we printed money all\n\nthe time.\n\nMs KORNER: Is your answer “no”. From what you can recall, you did not get credit to the\n\nsum I mentioned?\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: Well, it would not be the amount. We also took\n\ncredit from other countries that were granting us such credit. - 24 -\n\nMs KORNER: I do not want to ask the question a third time. Please, Mr. Luki ć, did you or\n\ndid you not accept credit to that amount from the National Bank of Yugoslavia?\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: No, because we had no need to take the credits\n\nfrom Yugoslavia, with the exception of some s poradic credit lines, because we had sufficient\n\nproducts and goods to exchange with Yugoslavia.\n\nMsKORNER: Can I have the document back, please. Mr.Luki ć, one last question. On\n\nfinance.\n\nIn February of 1994 did you give a press conference in which you announced that the\n\nAssembly of Republika Srpska had made a decision for the Republika Srpska to join the monetary\n\nsystem of Yugoslavia?\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: It is partly true, but there is something else that\n\nshould be borne in mind. The National Bank of Yu goslavia made the Dinar convertible. Which in\n\neffect meant that it would print the quantity, or the amount of Dinars that would correspond to the\n\ndeposits in the National Bank of Yugoslavia that were made in German Marks. And it is true that I\n\nhad talks with the Governor ⎯ at the time the Governor ⎯ of the National Bank of Yugoslavia.\n\nAnd it meant that Republika Srpska could take from the National Bank of Yugoslavia the amount\n\nin Dinars that would correspond to the deposit that it had already made in German Marks. And the\n\nconditions and terms were very strict and the sum had to be exact. And the Republika Srpska then\n\nconducted its own affairs and businesses but with th e convertible Dinars that it bought from the\n\nNational Bank of Yugoslavia.\n\nMsKORNER: One last question. Were yo u aware of the arrangement between the three\n\nbanks ⎯ that is the Bank of the RSK, the RS ⎯ that the Republika Srpska Bank was subordinated\n\nto the National Bank of Yugoslavia. Did you know about that? Either yes or no, please.\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: No and no.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Do I understand from that that you didn’t know, and you don’t agree? Is\n\nthat what we are . . . I’m simply trying to understand what your “no and no” were directed to.\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: Well, we were masters of our own destiny to the\n\ndegree or measure that we had the money actuall y to cover our expenses, because we used in - 25 -\n\nday-to-day operations the convertible mark, and th e situation, especially after the sanctions that I\n\nmentioned, was very strict in that regard.\n\nMs KORNER: Yes, alright. Can we move to an allied topic? Is it your assertion that the\n\narmy of the Republika Srpska, the VRS, required no aid in either material or money from the\n\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia?\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: What I said is that, owing to circumstances and\n\nthe decisions made by Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegović, in the hands of the soldiers of the JNA\n\nwho were of Bosnia and Serb origin, what remain ed there were large quantities of materiel and\n\narms.\n\nMs KORNER: I’m sorry, leaving aside what was left behind by the JNA, do you accept that\n\nhuge quantities of materiel were provided to the VRS by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?\n\nMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : For the most part, I underline “for the most\n\npart”, without paying for it, the army of Republik a Srpska did not receive assistance in equipment\n\nor arms.\n\nMs KORNER: I didn’t ask you whether it was paid for. I asked whether or not it had been\n\nsupplied by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: A negligible quantity, given our successes in the\n\nwar. And if you allow me to add just this: at th e start of the war we had more pieces of arms than\n\npopulation. And you are certainly aware of the fact that we sold some quantities of arms to\n\nHerceg-Bosna, which was a Croat entity; and also to the Autonomous Republic of Western\n\nBosnia, and you wouldn’t expect us to sell the ar ms and then go and procure them from somebody\n\nelse, would you?\n\nMs KORNER: Were you present at the fiftieth Assembly session in April of 1995 at Sanski\n\nMost?\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : No, I was not present there, because I was no\n\nlonger a member of the Government, and so it happened after my term of office expired.\n\nMs KORNER: You’ve spoken about the 12 May Assembly in Banja Luka, when it was\n\ndecided to create the army of the Serbian Republic. Were you present at that Assembly? - 26 -\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : No, because I joined the Government only in\n\nJanuary 1993.\n\nMs KORNER: Yes I understand that, but that w as a major, major Assembly, wasn’t it? An\n\nimportant one. Wasn’t it? It was an important Assembly?\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : Yes, it was important. It was important in the\n\nsense that at best at that session a third army wa s formed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the army of\n\nRepublika Srpska, and that army was in effecconstituted a month later. And the idea and the\n\npurpose was that this army should defend the peopl e of Republika Srpska, because at that time that\n\nwas the condition for the biological survival of the Serb people.\n\nMs KORNER: Yes, quite. Karadžic set out, di dn’t he, the six strategic goals of the Serbian\n\npeople at that Assembly? The answer to that is “yes” or “no”, please.\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: First of all, I was not present at that session so I\n\ncannot say, because I do not know who said what, who proposed what and who commented what.\n\nMs KORNER: Please, Mr. Lukić, are you telling us you did not know about the six strategic\n\ngoals?\n\nMUr.KI Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : Madam President, honourable judges and\n\nMembers of the Court, only two months ago, ormaybe three months ago, I read the text of these\n\nstrategic goals. I really do not know how it came about that these goals should be formulated, but\n\nwhat I knew is that I discussed at opoint these issues with General Mladi ć. Because he was\n\nasking me and asking the Government, in effect, give them the idea, the goals, for the army to\n\nfollow, meaning how far they should go ⎯ the army. Of course, I immediately reported it to\n\nMr. Karadžić but he simply, actually, did not say anything about it. He said nothing and he did not\n\nactually inform me that something of that sort ex isted, so I remained unaware of these goals until\n\ntwo months ago.\n\nMs KORNER: So, you never saw them when they were published in the Official Gazette?\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: Only two months ago.\n\nMs KORNER: Right. I want to move then to something else. When you took office in\n\n1993, did you give an interview to the newspaper called Glas Srpski? This time I do have it.\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: Well, I would have to see. - 27 -\n\nMs KORNER: I just want to ask you about one sentence. Did you say that one of the\n\npriorities of your Government was to protect property and goods . . .\n\nThe PRESIDENT: I am going to interrupt you there, Ms Korner. I have the impression that\n\nthe financial document had not only not been provided to the witness, but to the Agent for Serbia\n\nand Montenegro and I do not believe it has been pr ovided to the Bench either. I think we are now\n\nin the same situation again. Mr. Obradović, do you wish to speak to that?\n\nOMBr. ADOVI Ć: Thank you, Madam President. That was just my objection. We would\n\nlike to see it, in order to be prepared evelly for re-examination and to see and estimate the\n\nadmissibility of those documents. Just that.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Thank you. I think you have some problem continuing your\n\ncross-examination on this line.\n\nMs KORNER: Madam President, Mr. Luki ć came here and came out with a lengthy ⎯\n\nlengthy ⎯ statement full of assertions, none of which w as provided to us at all and which I have\n\ngreat difficulty in dealing with. All I could deal w ith was a guess at some of the things that he was\n\ngoing to deal with. The documents in themselves ar e not suggested that they should go in. I have\n\ngot them here purely so that if the witness asks ⎯ as did Mr. Riedlmayer when\n\nMs Fauveau-Ivanović was cross-examining ⎯ “well, can I see the document?”, that we had it there\n\nso there was no suggestion there was a trick. I just want him to confirm one line. It is not that we\n\nare trying to put the document in. This is to assist the witness, in fairness, because we think that is\n\nthe proper way to do it.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: I will allow this one lin e and then I would like to move away from\n\ndocuments that have not been provided.\n\nMs KORNER: Can you confirm, Mr. Luki ć, it is very simple, that you told Glas Srpski in\n\nJanuary 1993 that it was a priority to protect property and goods?\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: This is what I have always been saying.\n\nMs KORNER: Could we just very quickly, was it a priority of your Government to protect\n\nproperty and goods? Yes or no, could you say that?\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: People first and then everything else. - 28 -\n\nMs KORNER: Did you get a number of lette rs from the Bishop of Banja Luka complaining\n\nabout the destruction of Catholic churches?\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: The answer is no, because I met the Bishop on\n\nseveral occasions. He came to me so we discuss ed matters in a direct contact and he personally\n\nhad no need to address me in a written form.\n\nMs KORNER: Alright, when he came to see yo u, did he complain about the destruction of\n\nCatholic churches? Yes or no?\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : Well, there is not a single person that did not\n\ncomplain that something of their property had been destroyed, so he probably complained too. But\n\nI cannot remember what particularly he complained about and to which locations he referred.\n\nMs KORNER: Can I give you one example? Did he complain to you about the razing to the\n\nground of a Catholic church in Bosanska Gradisvka in February 1993?\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : We heard it before and there was no need for\n\nhim to complain about it and, in that context, I have to repeat again that, regrettably and\n\nunfortunately, the demolition of religious objects Bosnia and Herzegovina or the tradition to\n\ndemolish such objects goes back to centuries ago.There was not a single war in these areas that\n\ndid not at its outset also begin as a civil and religi ous war. In the Second World War, for example,\n\nSerbian Orthodox churches and mosques were destroyed ⎯ heavily ⎯ and in the war that we are\n\ntalking about other churches were also demolished and not only religious objects and institutions\n\nbut also cultural and historical objects and institutions. Well, after the demolition of the tomb that\n\nmarked a location where an entire village was demolished during the Second World War at\n\nPrebilovci... And particularly after the demolition of the Serbian Orthodox monastery of\n\nZitomislići in the Neretva River valley... And pa rticularly after the demolition of almost all\n\nreligious objects in Mostar . . . The events simp ly were going in the direction that could no longer\n\nbe controlled ⎯ by me anyway.\n\nAnd just one more sentence. A church in which I was baptized had been demolished in\n\nWorld War II. And in this war it was demolished and burnt down and we are now actually trying\n\nto rebuild that church.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Ms Korner, you are coming towards the end of your allocated period. - 29 -\n\nMs KORNER: With the greatest of respect, Madam President, he didn’t finish until\n\n20 past . . .\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Please continue.\n\nMs KORNER: Alright, I’ll make my point afterwards. Please, Mr. Luki ć, just answer the\n\nquestion that I ask, because I am being stopped from questioning you because of time limits. Did\n\nyou take any steps to protect the mosques in Banja Luka which were blown up during 1993?\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: Well, imagine a Prime Minister having to see to\n\nthe protection of every individual structure, including places of worship. But I do have to say in\n\nthis context that I have a special, different kind of attachment to Banja Luka and I am deeply sorry\n\nthat all that happened but, having said this, let add that we had proper parties of government,\n\nwe had a Ministry of Religion, we had police and, of course, they were instructed to take the proper\n\nmeasures to protect all buildings, including places of worship. And they were concerned with that\n\nin particular. So, it was war, developments evolved at an intensive pace, overtaking one another as\n\nit were, so perhaps we did not see to the protection of every individual structure on time because of\n\nsuch circumstances, but they were certainly instructed in principle to do so.\n\nMs KORNER: I have one last topic and one last question ⎯ or two ⎯ on it. On\n\n7 April 1993, did your Government pass a deci sion on establishing a commission for international\n\nlaw?\n\nMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : I do not know. I would have to consult the\n\nagenda of that particular session to give you an answer. Possibly it is true. If the gentleman claims\n\nthat it is, he has probably read it somewhere and I ha ve no reason not to believe him that that is so.\n\nBut seeing that we had about 38items on the agen da per session, it is only understandable that I\n\nreally cannot remember all of them.\n\nMs KORNER: Can I jog your memory, perhaps. Was one of its aims participation in the\n\nwork of competent bodies on preparing a reply to the lawsuit on the alleged genocide which was\n\ncommitted by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: That is not true; that is absolutely untrue. I had\n\nnot heard about this claim, this application, during the entire period of the war, nor did I hear about - 30 -\n\nit in Dayton. Had we known about that application, I guarantee you that we would have conducted\n\nourselves differently in Dayton.\n\nMs KORNER: So, you never, ever, establishe d such a commission with one of the reasons\n\nfor it being what I have just read to you.\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: Well, I am asking you this question: how would\n\nI have set up a commission for some sort of an activity that I am unaware of?\n\nMs KORNER: Because any lawsuit against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had nothing\n\nwhatsoever to do with Republika Srpska, did it?\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: I do not know what lawsuit you are referring to.\n\nMs KORNER: Yes, thank you.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Mr. Brownlie, do you wish to re-examine?\n\nMr. BROWNLIE: Mr. Luki ć has presented his evidence at length. There is no\n\nre-examination. Thank you.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: The Court will now retire, but the Parties and the witness should remain\n\nin the vicinity of the Great Hall of Justice. If the Court wishes to pose ques tions to the witness, it\n\nwill return to the courtroom within the next 15minutes. If the Court does not wish to put any\n\nquestions to the witness, it will not return to the courtroom and the Registry will inform the Parties\n\nand the public accordingly. The Court now rises.\n\nThe Court adjourned from 12.15 to 12.35 p.m.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Please be seated. We would invite the witness and the interpreter to be\n\nbrought into Court.\n\nJudges Ranjeva, Simma, Tomka and Bennouna will have questions for the witness. I first\n\ncall Judge Ranjeva.\n\nLe juge RANJEVA : Merci bien, Madame le président.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Un instant. Please proceed, Judge Ranjeva.\n\nLe juge RANJEVA : Merci, Madame le président. Monsieur le professeur Luki ć, vous est-il\n\npossible d’exposer a la Cour très brièvement les attributions que le chef du Gouvernement de la - 31 -\n\nRepublika Srpska exerce dans le domaine des re lations internationales ? Je vous remercie,\n\nMadame le président.\n\nLMU.KI Ć [interprétation du serbe] : Les relations internationales relevaient de la\n\ncompétence surtout du président de la République et de ses collaborateurs plus proches.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Thank you. I now call Judge Simma.\n\nJudge SIMMA: Thank you, Madam President. I have a very specific question to\n\nProfessor Lukić. Who, in your view, was responsible for the shelling with incendiary ammunition\n\nof both the National Library and the Oriental Institute in Sarajevo?\n\nMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian] : I am not at all aware of the fact that such\n\ninstitutions were specifically targeted. I know tat the city library was not set on fire by any\n\nammunition or shells of the army of Republika Srps ka. Any so-called instances of shelling did not\n\nactually come from the side of Republika Srpska, but were produced inside Sarajevo in order to\n\nsensitize the international public. But this is a ch broader topic and I am quite sure that you\n\nhave heard lots about it. I am aware that there ex isted an order of the most responsible leaders of\n\nRepublika Srpska to the effect that cultural monuments and historical monuments should be\n\npreserved. However, probably in the exchange of fire that transpired a number of such monuments\n\nwere also affected.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Thank you. I now call Judge Tomka.\n\nJudge TOMKA: Thank you, Madam President. ProfessorLuki ć, in your introductory\n\nstatement you, inter alia, said that you were appointed one of the two experts of the delegation of\n\nRepublika Srpska in the negotiations in Dayton in 1995. And you also discussed the composition\n\nof the delegation which consisted of the Speaker of the Parliament, of the Deputy Prime Minister,\n\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Republika Srps ka, two lawyers, and two experts, you being one\n\nof them. The question is: could you please explain to us what was the reason ⎯ or what were the\n\nconsiderations ⎯ that led the National Assembly, Skupština, of Republika Srpska to appoint the\n\nthen President of the Republic of Serbia, Mr. Miloševi ć, to represent Republika Srpska at the\n\nDayton negotiations? Thank you very much.\n\nLMUr. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: I should first of all like to make a correction: it\n\nwas not the Vice-Premier, but it was the Vice-President of the Republic, Mr. Koljevi ć. At the - 32 -\n\nsession at which the National Assembly was decidi ng the composition of the delegation to go to\n\nDayton, I was a professor in Banja Luka and I mysel f did not attend that session. If I am informed\n\nwell, the choice was between Mr.Miloševi ć, Mr.Tudjman and Mr.Izetbegovi ć and we opted for\n\nMr. Milošević as our representative because he enjoyed the reputation of a peacemaker, of a person\n\nthat had contributed to the hammering out of various peace agreements in the area.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: I now call finally upon Judge Bennouna.\n\nLe juge BENNOUNA: Merci, Madame le prés ident. J’ai la question suivante pour le\n\nprofesseur Lukić. Monsieur Luki ć, étiez-vous au courant vous-m ême ou votre gouvernement des\n\ndécisions du Conseil de sécurité des NationsUni es, au cours de l’année 1993 en particulier,\n\nexigeant de la République fédérale de Y ougoslavie (Serbie-et-Monténégro) de cesser\n\nimmédiatement la fourniture d’armes, d’équipements et de services de caractère militaire aux\n\nunités militaires et/ou paramilitaires serbes de Bo snie, les unités de la République serbe de\n\nBosnie-Herzégovine? Et si votre réponse est positive, donc si vous répondez oui ⎯ je vous\n\ndemanderais d’être aussi clair que possible ⎯, je vous demanderais aussi de nous dire, de dire à la\n\nCour, quelles dispositions vous auriez prises, vous-même ou votre gouvernement, en tant que\n\ndestinataire de cette assistance prohibée.\n\nLUMK. I Ć [interprétation du serbe] : D’abord, je ne pourrais pas accepter que nous avons\n\nété destinataire de cette aide dans ce sens aussi général. Il est notoire que la Republika Srpska\n\nfabriquait elle-même certains semi-produits de na ture militaire. Une bonne partie de ces semi-\n\nproduits étaient échangés avec l’industrie de la Ré publique fédérale de Yougoslavie, c’est-à-dire\n\nnous leur laissions en contrepartie une partie de ces semi-produits c ontre le produit fini qu’ils nous\n\nfournissaient. Il est notoire également que nous assurions le service des moteurs pour les avions de\n\ncombat. Il est également notoire qu’une partie de ces moteurs réparés étaient acheminés vers la\n\nGrande-Bretagne, la Serbie et encore certains autr es pays. Il est également notoire que différents\n\nproduits comme les produits forestiers par exempl e étaient échangés contre d’autres différents\n\nproduits de provenance de Yougos lavie. Vous avez pu entendre dans mon exposé d’introduction\n\nqu’il existait différents groupes qui armaient l es armées des trois peuples en Bosnie. L’armée\n\nmusulmane, par le truchement de la Croatie, armait les enclaves de l’est. Ce qui était également\n\ninterdit aux termes de la décision du Conseil de sécurité. Mais cette décision du Conseil de - 33 -\n\nsécurité, nous l’avons éprouvée le plus après le rejet du plan Vance-Owen. Vous aurez du mal à\n\nme croire, probablement, mais moi-même, j’ai été renvoyé de la frontière en 1995, moi, en tant que\n\nprofesseur. Tout simplement parce que j’avais ét é premier ministre. Et un détail personnel, peut-\n\nêtre déplaisant, en accompagnant mon fils blessé au champ de bataille, j’ai été arrêté à la frontière\n\npendant deux heures, et ainsi de suite. Et pire encore, si j’en parle déjà, un des blessés a été sorti\n\ndu véhicule et retenu à la frontière.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: Thank you. That brings to an end the hearing of the witness and I thank\n\nMr. Lukić for appearing before us. Mr. Luki ć may now be escorted out of the Great Hall of\n\nJustice.\n\nLMUK. I Ć [interpretation from Serbian]: Thank you, Your Honours.\n\nThe PRESIDENT: The Court now rises and will resume the hearing of evidence this\n\nafternoon at 3 o’clock.\n\nThe Court rose at 12.55 p.m.\n\n___________"
