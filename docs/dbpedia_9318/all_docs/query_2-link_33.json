The main potential threat to financial stability is indirect credit risk arising from the large share of bank lending effectively denominated in foreign exchange.",

        "text": "Main findings\n\n64. Objectives, autonomy, powers and resources (CP 1): The NBS is the sole authority with responsibility for licensing, supervising and closing banks. It has a generally satisfactory range of regulatory and enforcement powers for performing this task, the most conspicuous weakness being an absence of powers to supervise banks on a consolidated basis. While the NBS also enjoys legal autonomy in supervising banks, there is evidence that this has been compromised in practice through governmental interference in the supervision of state-controlled banks. Moreover, the effectiveness of the NBS as a supervisory authority is impaired by the lack of specific legal protection for the NBS and its officials when taking supervisory measures in good faith in accordance with the law. Supervisory decisions can also be easily challenged in the ordinary courts although these are not yet well equipped to resolve such issues. While the NBS has adequate powers to safeguard the confidentiality of information and to disclose such information to other domestic and foreign supervisors, it needs to put in place clear procedures for exchanging confidential information and, when necessary, coordinating supervisory measures. Although the number of NBS supervisors and their financing are adequate, practical experience is limited and the NBS should concentrate on developing greater depth of supervisory expertise.\n\n65. Licensing and Structure (CPs 2-5): The detailed provisions governing the licensing of banks and the range of their permitted activities are generally clear and robust. However, the procedures for ensuring that members of a bank’s board of directors and supervisory board are “fit and proper” are inadequate and should be strengthened. The ability of the NBS to control the entry of new investors into existing banks also needs to be enhanced: at present prior approval by the NBS is required only in cases where the new investor acquires 15 percent or more of voting rights. This threshold should be reduced to 5 percent or lower in cases where it is known that a new investor is likely to exercise significant influence. The provisions governing banks’ ability to invest in other entities are unsatisfactory in that banks do not require prior approval to acquire control of a nonfinancial entity provided the value of the acquisition is less than 15 percent of the investing bank’s capital. This threshold should be reduced. In addition, the rules should be amended to facilitate appropriate investments by banks in other financial entities, subject to prior NBS approval, and the introduction of consolidated supervision of banking groups.\n\n66. Prudential Regulations and Requirements (CPs 6-15): NBS regulations on capital adequacy and large exposures are generally adequate for limiting banks’ credit and concentration risks. However, these need to be applied additionally on a consolidated basis in order to be fully effective, while capital charges for price risk on banks’ holdings of securities are also needed. Moreover, concentration risk is exacerbated in practice by a degree of forbearance toward certain state-controlled banks. In addition, the current limits on banks’ connected exposures are quite liberal and should be tightened, including the introduction of an aggregate limit on such exposures. When consolidated supervision is introduced, the NBS should also be empowered to apply, subject to appropriate conditions, more liberal limits to banks’ exposures to related financial entities in cases where banking groups need such treatment in order to operate efficiently as single business entities.\n\n67. While the NBS has issued reasonably effective guidelines for banks’ credit policies and practices, it needs to tighten its procedures for evaluating the quality of banks’ assets and the adequacy of their loan loss provisions. In particular, it should consider how its guidelines might adequately capture the significant indirect credit risk inherent in banks’ currency-indexed loans to residents.\n\n68. The NBS has issued useful guidance to banks on how they should organize their internal controls. However, the impact of this guidance is undermined by the current absence of any legal requirement for banks’ boards of directors to ensure that their institutions have in place adequate systems of risk management or internal controls. Risk management and controls in banks need to be strengthened. To achieve this, the new banking law should set clear standards against which the NBS can judge the adequacy of individual banks’ systems, and empower the NBS to hold banks’ boards of directors directly responsible for implementing corrective measures which it considers that their banks need to take in order to operate safely.\n\n69. Methods of Ongoing Supervision (CPs 16-20): during recent years the NBS has significantly improved the intensity and methods of its supervision. In particular, risk-based methods and an early warning system have been adopted. The establishment of an internal Supervision Review Committee will also promote a more consistent approach toward banks in difficulties. At the same time, most supervisory personnel still lack extensive practical experience, while a particular concern is the shortage of IT specialists who can assess the reliability of banks’ systems in generating the financial data they report to the NBS. Recruitment and training of supervisors should be given high priority. As noted above, the absence of consolidated supervision undermines the adequacy of several of the supervisory methods.\n\n70. Information Requirements (CP 21): The relatively new Accounting and Auditing Law (applicable to 2003 and subsequent reporting years) requires banks to prepare published financial statements in accordance with IFRS. However, this is contradicted by a separate NBS requirement for banks to prepare their financial statements in accordance with a uniform chart of accounts. Consequently, the banks’ published financial statements do not comply fully with IFRS (for example, consolidated statements are not required). The NBS should amend its accounting requirements for banks, so that the banks are able to produce all the information the NBS needs for supervisory purposes, but are no longer prevented from producing published financial statements which comply fully with IFRS. The NBS should ensure that, as far as practicable, banks use the same accounting policies for both types of reporting.\n\n71. Formal Powers of Supervisors (CP 22): The NBS has adequate legal powers to take measures against banks that have infringed prudential regulations or whose financial condition is weak, and to tailor its measures according to the gravity of a specific situation. The NBS also has a successful record of closing banks and applying remedial measures in serious cases where it has a clear and unambiguous legal basis for acting. However, there are other instances where it has shown forbearance, particularly breaches of prudential lending limits by state-controlled banks. The NBS should adopt a fully consistent approach in the exercise of its enforcement powers.\n\n72. Cross-border Banking (CPs 23-25): At present Serbian banks have no foreign establishments. Several foreign banks have opened establishments in Serbia and the NBS supervises these establishments in the same way as domestic banks. When licensing new foreign banks, the NBS should strengthen its procedures for assessing of the quality of the consolidated supervision practiced by home country supervisors and establishing cooperation with them.\n\nTable 1.\n\nSerbia: Recommended Action Plan to Improve Compliance with the Basel Core Principles\n\nTable 1.\n\nSerbia: Recommended Action Plan to Improve Compliance with the Basel Core Principles\n\nReference Principle Recommended Action CP 1 Implementation of the proposed new banking law and issuance of implementing decisions/regulations. Remedial actions taken by the NBS on basis of new laws to reflect enforcement of new provisions, with focus on board and management responsibility in meeting compliance and in running their institutions in a safe and sound manner. CP 1.5 The new banking law should give the NBS, its Governor, and its staff legal protection against lawsuits resulting from measures taken in good faith in the course of carrying out banking supervision duties in accordance with that law. CP 1.6 The NBS should take the necessary steps to ensure a formal system for exchange of information and co-operation with domestic agencies that have responsibility for the soundness of the financial system, and with foreign agencies that have supervisory responsibilities for the owners of the banks/subsidiaries/branches of the Serbian banking system. CP 2 The NBS should strengthen its system for evaluating the suitability of members of boards of directors and supervisory boards in accordance with the fit and proper criterion. CP 4 The new banking law should reduce from 15 percent to 5 percent (or lower) the threshold at which a person must obtain the prior approval of the NBS before acquiring an initial shareholding in a bank. CP 6 (and CP12) The NBS should impose capital charges for market risk against banks’ securities held for trading or liquidity purposes CP 8 The Decision on the Criteria for Classification of Assets should be simplified. Also, borrowers whose earnings are not in foreign currency and who will suffer a deterioration of their financial position due to the impact of a steady depreciation of the SRD should be classified in the B category which requires a 5 percent reserve allocation. CP 9 The BSD should include in its supervision a review of banks’ sectoral or geographic exposures. CP 10 The new banking law should impose a limit (e.g., 20 percent of capital) on banks’ aggregate exposure to connected parties. However, it should also give the NBS discretion to exclude from the aggregate limit, exposures to connected banks and financial companies (e.g., leasing companies) provided that the bank is subject to consolidated supervision. CP 11 The NBS should review banks’ policies for managing country and transfer risk in their claims on banks in foreign countries CP 13 The NBS should issue new and more detailed standards for banks’ risk management. The new banking law should make banks’ boards of directors responsible for the adequacy of their banks’ risk management. CP 14 The NBS should issue a Decision requiring that responsibility is assigned to the management and the supervisory boards, and to management, for the accurate and truthful presentation of financial statements to the public and the regulators. The bank supervisors should also be provided with: a) authority to direct re-filing and publishing of amended financial statements; and b) the authority to sanction the bank and individuals for meaningful amounts, in case of above. CP 15 Prompt implementation by Serbia of the actions detailed in the Recommended Action Plan to improve compliance with FATF, as recommended by MONEYVAL. The NBS should ensure that the holders of numbered accounts at banks can be properly identified by bank management and should ensure that this type of accounts is not posing a money laundering risk. CP 16 As a minimum, two data systems specialists should be assigned on a permanent basis to the BSD. The BSD is weak in the areas of risk assessment of financial institutions. Additional focused training of supervisors is required. The scope of NBS on-site inspections should include a thorough review of the accuracy of financial reports submitted by the bank. The scope and decision-making of the Supervisory Review Committee should be reviewed. CP 18 The NBS should commence collecting information on a consolidated basis. CP 20 The new law should provide the NBS with sufficient powers to supervise banks on a consolidated basis, possibly in line with the minimum requirements in the relevant EU directives. CP 21 The NBS should introduce a new chart of accounts for banks which directly supports the preparation of both published financial statements and supervisory reports in accordance with IFRS accounting principles.\n\nThe NBS should issue a Decision requiring that responsibility is assigned to the management and the supervisory boards, and to management, for the accurate and truthful presentation of financial statements to the public and the regulators.\n\nAlso, the bank supervisors should be provided with authority: (a) to direct re-filing and publishing of amended financial statements, and (b) in such cases to sanction the bank and individuals for meaningful amounts. CP 22 The NBS should apply remedial measures more actively, particularly in cases of serious or protracted breaches of regulations.\n\nThe new law should also hold members of banks’ boards of directors and supervisory boards personally responsible for noncompliance. CP 25 The new banking law should develop more specific provisions for the licensing and supervision of foreign banks’ establishments.

The price stability objective is clearly specified in legislation, but there is room for improvement in the public disclosure of linkages with exchange rate policy and the relative importance of financial stability. Within the parameters of price stability, the statutory extent to which the NBS must support the economic policy of the government is more clearly defined than the relative importance of financial stability. The effectiveness of monetary policy may be undermined by limited public awareness and understanding of monetary policy and macro-financial linkages, suggesting an emphasis on explanation as well as disclosure. Broad policy objectives and intermediate targets (within which the reliance on the exchange rate as a nominal anchor) may be further explained. The considerations underlying monetary policy decisions are promptly disclosed through the publications and complemented by proactive NBS public information services. More research and publicly disclosed reports by the NBS on monetary policy transmission and pass-through variables would improve public understanding of the impact of the monetary stance on price stability, thereby improving policy effectiveness.\n\n77. While the institutional framework establishes the modalities for monetary-fiscal coordination, operational demarcations are unclear. The legal framework establishes clear modalities for monetary-fiscal coordination. The Governor attends government meetings of relevance to the NBS, the MOF consults the NBS on draft of laws and the budget, and, at the motion of the NBS, the government may propose to the National Assembly the adoption of laws related to the objectives and tasks of the central bank. However, operational demarcations and agency roles warrant further clarification.\n\nOpen process for formulating and reporting monetary policy decisions\n\n78. The process for formulating and reporting policy decisions is open, with a presumption toward communication and consultation. The recent implementation of advance meeting schedules for Monetary Board meetings and the automatic disclosure of the decisions taken therein are expected to significantly improve transparency. The NBS Governor also engages in active communication on policy settings with financial markets and the public at large through the local media. The NBS engages in public consultation through its web-site, by posting draft measures or regulatory texts, together with a timeframe for their implementation. Questions and comments are received from the banks and the public at large and round tables and seminars are organized when relevant, as in the preparation of the draft Law on Deposit Insurance. The public relation function of the NBS is considering the establishment of a call center to facilitate two-way communication.\n\nPublic availability of information on monetary policy\n\n79. The public information services of the NBS rely on a variety of media, with published material, electronic updates and verbal communication. Press conferences are held at least once a month, supplemented by briefings for journalists and public consultations on current topics. The Governor and the members of the Monetary Board make frequent statements to the media and the public at large regarding current issues. Texts of regulations are readily available to the public. The NBS web-site contains links to laws, regulations, instructions and circulars. Reporting guidelines establish the content of reports on operation that must be submitted by banks and other financial organizations to the NBS.\n\n80. The public availability of information is somewhat limited by a lack of consistency with statistical standards and a shortfall of data on emergency liquidity assistance. Serbia does not subscribe to the Special, General, and Data Dissemination Standards. Definitions of balance of payments concepts are only partly in line with the 1993 IMF Balance of Payments Manual and there is no consistency with IMF data dissemination standards. Serbia has no IFS pages. Emergency liquidity assistance for banks may be provided but no such information is disclosed. It is not clear whether or not the NBS has engaged in emergency liquidity assistance for banks, and if it has, no information on aggregate amounts is publicly disclosed.\n\nAccountability and assurances of integrity by the NBS\n\n81. The means, methods, and procedures used by the NBS to account for its actions and report on its activities combine ex post and ex ante accountability. The Council (to which the Governor reports on the conduct of monetary policy) reports to the National Assembly on all the factors affecting the implementation of monetary policy, as well as on the state of the banking sector and the overall financial system. It also communicates, for information, the monetary policy program for the following year. The law sets out clear modalities for financial reporting. In reporting to Parliament for the 2003 financial year, the Governor took questions from the floor regarding the financial statements of the NBS. NBS officials may also be called upon by the National Assembly to explain their policies or performance, and exchange views on relevant issues. However, reporting requirements tend to be met by the submission of the relevant documents, rather than by their discussion in front of the designated public authority.\n\n82. Although the legal basis for NBS instruments is clear, the extent to which it may effectively use them to attain its policy objectives is questionable. There appear to be some limitations in the NBS authority with regard to bank supervision. It is expected that matters such as NBS approval or rejection of banks’ board members and the possibility for legal action against bank auditors if a clean bill of health is given in spite of evidence to the contrary will be addressed in forthcoming proposals for amending the LOB, in line with similar provisions in the insurance law.\n\n83. Timely, comprehensive and audited financial reports are provided on an annual basis only. The Annual Report contains audited financial statements of NBS operations, as well as the income statement (with information on the expenses incurred and the revenues obtained in operating the central bank). The financial statements are audited by an independent external auditor. The selection of the latter is based on public tender with strict rotation procedures. The annual financial statements include information on accounting policies and qualifications, but no summary balance sheets are provided on a monthly or quarterly basis.\n\n84. Although NBS advances to the government, profit allocation and the maintenance of capital are publicly disclosed, recapitalization procedures should be further clarified. NBS profits are primarily allocated to replenish minimum capital, with additional appropriations of up to 30 percent transferred to special reserves and the remainder, reduced by the amount of unrealized gains, allocated to the government. If losses are not covered by special reserves, budgetary transfers or government debt securities would cover the shortfall. NBS advances for financing temporary illiquidity of the budget must be within the framework of the monetary policy program, up to 5 percent of the average revenue of the last three years. No mention is made of the repayment period and applicable interest rate however. In addition, the transformation of outstanding government debt into government securities, the considerations underlying its pricing and liquidity, and the impact of valuation on the capital position of the NBS all remain unclear.\n\n85. The internal audit function provides an assurance of integrity in NBS operations, although the lines of reporting may be subject to review. There is no disclosure of the Annual Audit Plan; the audit charter and supporting manual are also treated as internal documents. Internal auditors are subject to a cooling off period of one year for internal candidates, in that the persons selected may not conduct an audit of the department in which they were previously employed. The lines of reporting are essentially to the Governor (entrusted with appointing the Internal Auditor), with some parallel reporting to the Council, even though the Council is responsible for the oversight of NBS operations and is the body which provides an element of checks and balances on the function of the Governor. The NBS reports that it is currently considering the creation of an Audit Committee. It remains to be seen whether such a body would significantly alter the governance structure and provide further assurances of integrity in the conduct of NBS operations.\n\n86. There are high standards of conduct for officials and staff with strong safeguards against conflict of interest, but no legal protections for officials and staff in the conduct of their duties. Fiduciary obligations are fulfilled and internal regulations cover sound work practices, staff rights and obligations. There is no information on legal protections to assure the public that NBS officials and staff perform their duties without fear of being personally subjected to legal action. Indeed, the threat of legal action affects policymaking in controversial areas and could significantly undermine NBS effectiveness, particularly in bank and insurance supervision.\n\nAuthorities’ Response\n\n87. A draft of this assessment was discussed in detail with the NBS during the FSAP mission in April 2005. They noted the ongoing improvements in disclosure practices. No written response was received.\n\nTable 2.\n\nRecommended Plan of Actions to Improve Observance of the IMF MFP Transparency Code Practices—Monetary Policy\n\nTable 2.\n\nRecommended Plan of Actions to Improve Observance of the IMF MFP Transparency Code Practices—Monetary Policy\n\nReference Practice Recommended Action I.

The start of operation in January 2003 of the NBS RTGS and Clearing Systems constituted a key milestone in the restructuring of the Serbian payment infrastructure. All dinar interbank payments in Serbia had been controlled by a state-controlled decentralized and highly opaque entity with branches throughout the country and a staff of some 7,000 people. The leadership and guidance provided by the NBS greatly contributed to the success of the restructuring project.\n\n89. The settlement of all interbank transfers of funds in Serbian dinar is effected through centralized payment systems owned and operated by the NBS. This assessment covers the main payments system is Serbia: the NBS RTGS system. In 2004, about 90 percent of all interbank payments, in value terms, were settled in the NBS RTGS system. However, in terms of volume, only some 5.5 percent of the total traffic was settled through the RTGS system.\n\n90. The NBS offers two logically independent dinar systems operated on a common information systems platform. The NBS RTGS system that provides facilities for the realtime gross settlement in central bank money of credit transfers in Serbian dinar is also used for the processing of time-sensitive payments of any size. There are 46 participants, comprising: 42 banks, the NBS, the Serbian Bankers’ Association’s Cheque Clearing System, the Central Securities Depository and Clearing House of Serbia and the MOF. Payment flows in the NBS RTGS system show a fairly low degree of concentration. Taken together, the four biggest banks generate only some 30 percent of both value and volume processed. The other NBS clearing system provides for net settlement of large volumes of low-value interbank transactions. It handles both credit and debit transactions. Net balances arising in the clearing system are settled in the NBS RTGS system.\n\n91. Banks can use their required and free reserves held with the NBS in full for intraday settlements. Where necessary, RTGS participants can obtain intraday credit free of interest charge from the NBS against eligible collateral, at present; however, participants only make limited use of this facility. Due to the ample availability of liquidity and banks’ use of their internal schedulers, the central queuing system is de facto used very rarely. The RTGS system offers the possibility to “block” funds in view of being used for certain specific purposes.\n\n92. Within the NBS, the General Manager of the Payment Systems Department has the opportunity to provide information and discuss payment systems issues in bi-weekly meetings of NBS Senior Management. Within the banking community, the Serbian Banker’s Association (SBA) provides a forum for co-operation between banks. At the SBA, payments issues are handled by the Payment System and the Legal Committee."
