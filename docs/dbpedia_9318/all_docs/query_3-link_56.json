        "text": "I have a Euro bank account in Montenegro. I'm receiving money from Airbnb (most likely in Euro as well). Do I pay transaction fee for this?\n\nOnce I want to transfer the accumulated amount in Euro on my Paypal account onto my Euro bank account in Montenegro, is this free of charge as well?\n\nThank you so much... this is really unfortunate.\n\nThe problem for receiving money from rental booking platforms like Airbnb, Booking, VRBO etc is that they can only transfer in $ to the Montenegrin bank account. Actually, Montenegro is using Euro as the main currency but somehow they can only book in $ while they should be able to send in Euro as they can also do to European Union countries.\n\nThe problem is that the booking platforms charge like 3% for paying out, then the local bank in Montenegro applies an exchange rate which is not in favour of me plus they charge 2% for incoming flow of money to an externally known IBAN number (not 9 but 12 digits!). Then if you want to transfer from this IBAN to the local Montenegrin account (which is a local account number) it costs also a certain percentage. So, I'm literally ripped off...\n\nSo, to avoid the chain of commissions I would have hoped there is another way...\n\nAny suggestions are welcome, otherwise thanks for answering it!"
