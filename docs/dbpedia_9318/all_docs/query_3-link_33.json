Now I'm trying to add Montenegro as a second market, they use Euro. Again Cash on delivery only.\n\nWhen I add Montenegro as a second market, it doesn't let me change the currency from Serbian Dinars to Euros because \"Shopify payments\" are not supported in my country. I just need the currency to show prices in Euros for Montenegro, I don't need a payment provider.\n\nIs Shopify the right solution for my e-commerce store? What should I do?"
