        "text": "Journal of Cold War Studies 4.1 (2002) 120-122 The wars of Yugoslav succession have resulted in a flood of academic and journalistic publications. With a few notable exceptions, these works have concentrated on contemporary aspects of the conflict, often at the expense of historical analysis of the long-term causes of Yugoslav disintegration. The second edition of John Lampe&#39;s Yugoslavia as History: Twice There Was a Country admirably fills this gap, providing a reliable, judicious, balanced, and clearly written guide to the histories of the two Yugoslavias -- the interwar kingdom and Josip Broz Tito&#39;s Communist Yugoslavia. By adding a new chapter on the wars of Yugoslav succession, Lampe brings his narrative all the way up to the intervention in 1999 by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against the &quot;rump&quot; Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The book is divided into twelve chapters, each focusing on a distinct period of pre-Yugoslav or Yugoslav history. The...\n\nIn this article, we study how the discipline of International Relations (IR) emerged in postwar socialist Yugoslavia and how it evolved during and after the Cold War with the disintegration of Yugoslavia. In particular, we show that IR emerged in Yugoslavia in the 1950s and throughout the Cold War developed as a Marxist-inspired endeavor in support of self-management socialism at home and non-alignment and active peaceful coexistence abroad. After the collapse of Yugoslavia, its IR community was fragmented along the national lines, disillusioned with Marxism and preoccupied with practical war efforts and state-building, which implied a close interest in statecraft, strategy, geopolitics and realism. Since the early 2000s, IR communities from the region have been reconnecting both with the post-Yugoslav area and keeping up with Western and global IR trends. This implied greater pluralism and diversity in approaches, focusing on post-conflict reconstruction and regional integration, and a gradual turn towards the liberal, critical and constructivist scholarship.\n\nBy analising the relations of Yugoslavia to its Western neighbours during the Cold War, this article provides a comparative study on the developments leading Yugoslavia from deep rooted enmity with Austria and Italy to “peaceful coexistence” in the Cold War and amicable relations across ideological and economic barriers. Major factors for this development are tackled, such as the importance of personal commitment among political leaders; the emergence of superpowers during the Cold War; and the repercussions of internal developments for international relations. Thus, a broad picture is drawn that proves how Yugoslav policies towards its Western neighbours were indeed a particular and intertwined factor of Yugoslav politics."
