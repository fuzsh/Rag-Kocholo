Production-based measure Start/end months of reporting year: January/December Base year: 1990. China GDP deflator does not equal 100 in the base year. This is due to the fact that, in the base year, there is a discrepancy between production-based and expenditure-based nominal GDP series. Reported NGDP series are production-based, while NGDP_R series are estimated using expenditure based nominal GDP in the base year and contributions to growth in subsequent years.

DANE (Colombia Institute of Statistics) has done a rebasing of the national accounts (now base year is 2005 and before 2000). Data with the new base is ONLY AVAILABLE FROM 2000. The change also includes methodological changes (for example, direct estimation of private consumption based on a survey) and most important, change in the index formulae (historically a Laspeyres fixed-base index and now a Laspeyres chain index). The main implications are that the 2000 and 2005 series are not comparable and the chain index is associated with non-additivity of the components.

The latest year of data for national accounts at constant prices is 2007. Notes: Real GDP data for the period 1990-1999 have been adjusted by desk economist to account for breaks in the source data. The breaks are associated with changes in the base year from 1984 to 1995 and subsequently to 2000. Only pre-revision data exist for the period prior to 1995. Simple rebasing technique does not apply because even the nominal data were revised back to 1995. Using the pre-revision data, desk economist recalculated the constant price data for the period prior to 1995 so that y-o-y change of each component remains unchanged. A similar adjustment was made to the period 1995-1999.
