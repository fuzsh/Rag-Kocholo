Patients' knowledge, emotions and behaviour regarding ABs were assessed using a structured questionnaire, constructed by a psychologist and intended for general population in six European countries. Questionnaires were filled out by individuals who visited pharmacies and general practitioners. A total of 838 questionnaires were filled in. Respondents from Slovenia showed the best knowledge about ABs, followed by Croatians. The highest willingness for self-medication reported respondents from FYROM. The most positive emotions about ABs were expressed by respondents in Greece and Hungary, and the most negative in Slovenia. All components of attitudes towards antibiotics were influenced by country and level of education. Behaviour regarding ABs complied with emotions and knowledge in all countries. The results of this study may lay a basis for conducting national public campaigns, as a step forward in education of patients on rational AB use.

The northern Serbian region of Vojvodina is inhabited by Southern Slavic Serbian majority and, inter alia, Western Slavic (Slovak) and Eastern Slavic (Ruthenian) minorities. In the study, 15 autosomal STR markers were analysed in unrelated Slovaks, Ruthenians and Serbs from northern Serbia and western Slovakia. Additionally, Slovak males from Serbia were genotyped for 17 Y-chromosomal STR loci. The results were compared to data available for other Slavic populations. Genetic distances for autosomal markers revealed homogeneity between Serbs from northern Serbia and Slovaks from western Slovakia and distinctiveness of Serbian Slovaks and Ruthenians. Y-STR variation showed a clear genetic departure of the Slovaks and Ruthenians inhabiting Vojvodina from their Serbian neighbours and genetic similarity to the Northern Slavic populations of Slovakia and Ukraine. Admixture estimates revealed negligible Serbian paternal ancestry in both Northern Slavic minorities of Vojvodina, providing evidence for their genetic isolation from the Serbian majority population. No reduction of genetic diversity at autosomal and Y-chromosomal markers was found, excluding genetic drift as a reason for differences observed at autosomal STRs. Analysis of molecular variance detected significant population stratification of autosomal and Y-chromosomal microsatellites in the three Slavic populations of northern Serbia, indicating necessity for separate databases used for estimations of frequencies of autosomal and Y-chromosomal STR profiles in forensic casework. Our results demonstrate that regarding Y-STR haplotypes, Serbian Slovaks and Ruthenians fit in the Eastern European metapopulation defined in the Y chromosome haplotype reference database.

We report results of surveys in the Balkan countries Serbia and Montenegro and compare results with data from Croatia and Slovenia. Convenience surveys of the general public were conducted in public places like shopping centers/malls and parks in Serbia (Nâ=â400) and Montenegro (Nâ=â500) using an adapted version of the public awareness of aphasia survey questionnaire. Respondents were asked whether they have heard of aphasia and tested with questions about aphasia. Information on gender, age, occupation and education was recorded. Twelve percent (Serbia) and 11% (Montenegro) had heard of aphasia, but just 4% (Serbia) and 3.2% (Montenegro) had a basic knowledge of aphasia. Age, gender and occupation interacted variably with awareness. Between 16% (Slovenia) and 60% (Croatia) said they had heard of aphasia (10.5% overall mean for the four countries) and basic knowledge of aphasia across the four countries ranged between 3.2 and 7%. Levels of awareness of aphasia in the Balkans are low and variably associated with age, gender, socio-economic and educational levels. Respondents with some knowledge of aphasia gained it through personal or professional interaction with aphasia or the media. The data provide a basis for awareness raising in Balkan countries to reduce stigmatization, improve community access and understanding. Implications for rehabilitation Awareness of aphasia is low universally, even among healthcare workers. Low public awareness of a condition, like aphasia, results in under-funded research and service provision. In order to raise public awareness of aphasia we need to know how many members of the general public know about it. Improvements in public awareness could positively affect funding, the quality of services, and the public understanding and acceptance of individuals with aphasia in the community.

Since that time an evident mortality decline could be observed in that part of Europe too. Within the post-communist countries, mortality development has been most favourable in Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The aim of this study is to describe the latest development of cancer mortality in two selected countries - the Czech Republic and Slovakia. These two countries have much in common, including many similar long term trends in demographic or social indicators' development. The study evaluates whether cancer mortality development differs in the two countries or rather follows a similar trend. From the presented results it is clear that the development apparently differs namely according to sex. The results according to selected particular causes of death (from the group of malignant neoplasms) are presented as well. It could be assumed that many aspects could be improved by prevention programmes or screening.

This became a part of the University Hospital in 1945, and in the early 1960s the Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology was established. The Oncological Institute of Slovenia was established in 1938 and has developed into a modern facility for comprehensive cancer care, research, and teaching. In close cooperation, established in the 1960s, a team from these two institutions takes care of the approximately 60 children per year who develop cancer in Slovenia. Consisting of pediatricians, radiation oncologists, pathologists, cytologists, surgeons, and other ad hoc specialists, the team meets at least twice weekly to plan treatment, follow the patients, discuss the results, and teach. All patients are subject to regular follow-up indefinitely. A separate team has been formed to study the late effects of cancer treatment on survivors, who by now are mostly adults.\n\nEarthquakes in Tuhinj Valley (Slovenia) In 1840\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCeciÄ, Ina\n\n2015-04-01\n\nA less known damaging earthquake in southern part of Kamnik-Savinja Alps, Slovenia, in 1840 is described. The main shock was on 27 August 1840 with the epicentre in Tuhinj Valley. The maximum intensity was VII EMS-98 in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and in Eisenkappel, Austria. It was felt as far as Venice, Italy, 200 km away. The macroseismic magnitude of the main shock, estimated from the area of intensity VI EMS-98, was 5.0.

In other words biotechnology is 'application of scientific and technical advances in life science to develop commercial products' or briefly 'the use of molecular biology for useful purposes'. This short overview is about different branches of biotechnology carried out in Slovakia and it shows that Slovakia has a good potential for further development of modern biotechnologies.

The previous two decades of turbulent history have significantly affected the demographic picture of this country, and their ramifications remain visible in Serbia's economic, political, cultural, and health spheres. Major demographic forces behind population aging in Serbia can be attributed to lower fertility rates, migrations, and declining mortality (reflecting improvements in overall health leading to a longer life expectancy). In Serbia, low fertility and migrations appear to play major roles, although the relative contribution of recent migrations cannot be measured with accuracy. Patterns of demographic aging vary considerably across different geographic, socioeconomic, and cultural settings. The common denominator throughout present day Serbia is extensive political and economic transition. One would expect that, given sufficient time, this process will result in improved population health, and yet, at this stage outcomes of major health care reform in Serbia are somewhat perplexing. For the second consecutive year, Serbia's health care system has been ranked at the very bottom of the scale among 34 European countries. It is then no surprise that the elderly represent particularly vulnerable population segment. This paper discusses some of the issues relevant to these demographic patterns of aging and aged care in contemporary Serbia, focusing on the period after 2000.\n\nEducation Inequality in Slovakia: The Effects of Early Selection\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nZelmanova, Olga; Korsnakova, Paulina; Tramonte, Lucia; Willms, J.

In accordance with the general definition of prevailing wind, two special definitions of this term are used. The seasonal wind roses in 16 directions at each station are analyzed. This study shows that the prevailing winds in Northern Serbia have northwestern and southeastern directions. Circulation weather types over Serbia are presented in order to determine the connections between the synoptic circulations and prevailing surface winds. Three controlling pressure centers, i.e., the Mediterranean cyclone, Siberian high, and the Azores anticyclone, appear as the most important large-scale factors that influence the creation of the prevailing winds over Northern Serbia. Beside the synoptic cause of the prevailing winds, it is noted that the orography of the eastern Balkans has a major influence on the winds from the second quadrant. It was found that the frequencies of circulation weather types are in agreement with those of the prevailing winds over Northern Serbia.\n\nSuicide in Serbia.\n\nPubMed\n\nIlic, M; Ilic, I\n\n2016-03-15\n\nSuicide remains a significant public health problem worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the mortality trend of suicide in Serbia for the years 1991-2014. Data on persons who died of suicide and self-inflicted injury (site codes E950-E959 revision 9 and X60-X84 revision 10 of the International Classification of Diseases to classify death, injury and cause of death) were obtained from the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia. The age standardized rate was calculated by direct method (per 100,000 persons, using Segi's World population as standard population). Average annual percentage change (AAPC) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed for trend using the joinpoint regression analysis. Total 33,930 (24,016 men and 9914 women) suicide deaths occurred in Serbia during the observed period, with the average annual age-standardized mortality rate being 12.7 per 100,000 inhabitants (19.5 per 100,000 in men and 6.7 per 100,000 in women). Suicide mortality in all age groups was higher among men than women. In both genders, suicide rates were highest in the oldest age group. Significantly decreased trend in suicide mortality was recorded continuously from 1991 to 2014 (AAPC=-1.9%, 95%CI -2.2 to -1.6). The most frequently used suicide method in both genders was hanging, strangulation or suffocation with 61.2% off all suicides. Changes in mortality rates were significant both for suicide by firearms, air guns and explosives (AAPC=-1.5% (AAPC=-1.5% in men and -3.1%-3.1% in women) and for suicide by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation (AAPC=-1.2% (AAPC=-1.2% in men and -3.0%-3.0% in women). In men, nonsignificant increase in suicide by firearms, air guns and explosives observed during the period 1991-1997 (by +6.1% per year) was followed by a significant decrease until 2014 (by -3.1% per year). The significantly increased mortality in suicide by firearms, air guns, and explosives was observed in older men (aged 40-69 years and 80\n\n31 CFR 586.204 - Prohibited new investment within Serbia.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n...

We introduce the growth curves for monitoring fetal growth in twin pregnancies in Slovenia. Slovenian National Perinatal Information System for the period between 2002 and 2010 was used to calculate birth weight percentiles for all live born twins for each week from 22nd to 40th week. The calculated percentiles of birth weight for all live-born twins in Slovenia served as the basis for drawing 'growth' curves. The calculated growth curves for twins will help accurately diagnose small or large twin fetuses for their gestational age in the native central European population.\n\nRickettsia species in fleas collected from small mammals in Slovakia.\n\nPubMed\n\nÅ pitalskÃ¡, Eva; BoldiÅ¡, Vojtech; MoÅ¡anskÃ½, Ladislav; Sparagano, Olivier; Stanko, Michal\n\n2015-11-01\n\nEpidemiological and epizootiological studies of Rickettsia felis and other Rickettsia spp. are very important, because their natural cycle has not yet been established completely. In total, 315 fleas (Siphonaptera) of 11 species of Ceratophyllidae, Hystrichopsyllidae and Leptopsyllidae families were tested for the presence of Rickettsia species and Coxiella burnetii with conventional and specific quantitative real-time PCR assays. Fleas were collected from five rodent hosts (Myodes glareolus, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus agrarius, Microtus subterraneus, Microtus arvalis) and three shrew species (Sorex araneus, Neomys fodiens, Crocidura suaveolens) captured in Eastern and Southern Slovakia. Overall, Rickettsia spp. was found in 10.8% (34/315) of the tested fleas of Ctenophthalmus agyrtes, Ctenophthalmus solutus, Ctenophthalmus uncinatus and Nosopsyllus fasciatus species. Infected fleas were coming from A. flavicollis, A. agrarius, and M. glareolus captured in Eastern Slovakia. C. burnetii was not found in any fleas. R. felis, Rickettsia helvetica, unidentified Rickettsia, and rickettsial endosymbionts were identified in fleas infesting small mammals in the KoÅ¡ice region, Eastern Slovakia. This study is the first report of R. felis infection in C. solutus male flea collected from A. agrarius in Slovakia.\n\nCrohns disease in Slovakia: prevalence, socioeconomic and psychological analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nPrÃ­kazka, M; LetkovicovÃ¡, M; MatejÃ­ckova, V\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe need for a basic epidemiological study, according to international standards, of the prevalence of IBD in Slovakia was increased by the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. This paper presents the results of CD prevalence to 30 April 1994 in Slovakia. To evaluate the statistical data of the prevalence of the disease according to age, sex, regions and districts, the authors employed the multi-dimensional Kruskal-Wallis test and cluster analysis and determined that the prevalence of CD in Slovakia is 6.75/100.000 inhabitants. The distribution differences indicate the need for further investigations of environmental differences. The socio-economic and psychological evaluation of the patients examined revealed some interesting associations. The psychological reaction to the disease is neurotic and depressive and a higher occurrence of affective symptomatology was observed in patients with permanent partnership and with children. On the other hand, the educational level and knowledge concerning the disease on the part of the patient had a positive influence on the reaction to the disease.\n\nArt Museum Education in Transition: Moderna Galerija in Slovenia\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nZeleznik, Adela\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis essay examines the educational practices at the Moderna galerija, a national museum of modern and contemporary art in Ljubljana, Slovenia, in the last twenty years.

Serbia celebrates three important anniversaries in 2007 - 150 years since the birth of Milan Nedeljkovic, who introduced the first astronomical subjects to the Faculty of Mathematics in 1884, and founded the Astronomical Observatory in Belgrade in 1887; 120 years of the Belgrade Astronomical Observatory and 75 years since the construction of the complex of buildings and telescopes at the Astronomical Observatory in Belgrade. The Astronomy Department at the Faculty of Mathematics in Belgrade has produced many excellent scientists working today at telescopes (Arecibo, Sidney, VLA, Hawaii etc.) and universities (California, Toronto, Sidney, Illinois, MIT etc.) around the world. Since 2005, students have also been able to study astronomy at the University of Novi Sad, Serbia (Faculty of Physics). Today there are more than 20 amateur astronomical societies in Serbia, two magazines of popular astronomy, one Youth Science Centre (Petnica), two Public Observatories and two Planetariums. If the social and media network formed in October 2007 can deliver even the minimum of the expected results, six million people in Serbia should easily be familiar with IYA2009 goals, related Cornerstone Projects and particular goals in Serbia for 2009.\n\nShortcomings of maternity care in Serbia.\n\nPubMed\n\nArsenijevic, Jelena; Pavlova, Milena; Groot, Wim\n\n2014-03-01\n\nMaternity care in Serbia is an integrated part of the centralized health care system inherited from the former Yugoslavia. Childbirth is often perceived as a medical event instead of a physiological process. This paper examines quality and access indicators, and patient payments for maternity care in Serbia. We apply a method of triangulation using data collected through three sources: online questionnaires filled in by mothers who delivered in one of the maternity wards in Serbia in the period 2000-2008, research publications, and official guidelines. To compare the qualitative data from all three sources, we apply framework analysis. The results show a good network of maternity wards in Serbia. On the other hand, many women who gave birth in maternity wards in Serbia indicate problems with the treatment they received. The existence of informal patient payments and so-called \"special connections\" make the position of Serbian women in maternity wards vulnerable, especially when they have neither connections nor the ability to pay. Poor communication and bedside manner of medical staff (obstetricians, other physicians, midwives, and nurses) during the birth process are also frequently reported. Actions should be taken to improve bedside manners of medical staff. In addition, the government should consider the involvement of private practitioners paid by the national insurance fund to create competition and decrease the need for informal payments and \"connections.\" Â© 2014, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation Â© 2014, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nEducation Policy Outlook: Slovenia\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPeterka, Judith; Field, Simon; Figueroa, Diana Toledo; Golden, Gillian; Jankova, Bojana; Fraccola, Sylvain\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis policy profile on education in Slovenia is part of the \"Education Policy Outlook\" series, which presents comparative analysis of education policies and reforms across OECD countries.

These dwellings count for an average of 47.5% of the total housing stock in European Union countries. At present in Slovakia and also other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, there are vast housing areas which were built after World War II. Slovakia's multifamily housing stock was privatized during the 1990s. Considering that the economy of Slovakia is not capable of replacing the existing housing fund, which is located in the multifamily houses that were built after World War II, it is necessary to place an increased emphasis on the renovation of this housing fund. The expenditures for the refurbishment of multifamily housing stock in recent decades, when compared with the demand, have been at a very low level. The main problems involving the current multifamily housing stock in Slovakia are: the need for modernization, the low level of energy efficiency, and the insufficient level of building maintenance. One of the options for creating sufficient sources for the renovation of apartment buildings is to utilize the roofs of apartment buildings as construction areas for building additional floors (over - roofing). The means acquired from the sale of the new floors after deducting the costs can be used for renovation. It is a matter of a one-time possibility, which is limited by many factors that depend on the localization and constructive technical solutions for apartment buildings. This article is an outcome of the SuReFit \"Sustainable Roof Extension Retrofit for High-Rise Social Housing in Europe\" international research project.\n\nHepatozoon canis infection in Slovakia: imported or autochthonous?\n\nPubMed\n\nMajlÃ¡thovÃ¡, ViktÃ³ria; HurnÃ­kovÃ¡, Zuzana; MajlÃ¡th, Igor; Petko, Branislav\n\n2007-01-01\n\nTissue samples from nine red foxes (four samples of striated muscle tissue and five samples of heart tissue) that originated from the Michalovce district (Slovakia), an area with endemic occurrence of canine babesiosis were examined by PCR method using primers amplifying a fragment of the 18S rRNA spanning the V4 region of Babesia and Theileria. An unexpected determination of 450 bp DNA fragment of Hepatozoon canis was found in four samples. Partial sequences of the 18S rRNA gene from the H. canis showed 100% similarity with the sequence from Brasil isolate of H. canis from a pampas fox (Pseudalopex gymnocercus) (AY471615) as well as from a fox in Spain (AY150067) and from a dog in Brazil (AY864677). In the present study, we report the first PCR detection of Hepatozoon canis in a naturally infected red fox from Slovakia, a Rhipicephalus sanguineus-free region. We assume that the infection was spread by infected R. sanguineus that might have been brought to Slovakia by travelers, by golden jackals, or by foxes migrating because of expansion of golden jackals and environmental and climate changes.\n\nA checklist of longhorn beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) of Serbia.\n\nPubMed\n\nIliÄ, Nastas; ÄurÄiÄ, SreÄko\n\n2015-09-30\n\nA checklist of all taxa of the family Cerambycidae (longhorn beetles) from Serbia is presented. The checklist is based on compilation of data gathered both from authors and available literature published up to now. A total of 265 species and 92 subspecies belonging to 109 genera, 48 tribes, and six subfamilies are recorded for Serbia. However, the presence of 28 species listed in Serbia may be questionable. Known distribution and biology of Serbian taxa are provided.

The present study describes the adaptation of the QoL-AGHDA for use in the following four Slavic languages; Czech, Polish, Serbian and Slovakian. The study involved three stages in each language; translation, cognitive debriefing and validation. The validation stage assessed internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), reproducibility (test-retest reliability using Spearman's rank correlations), convergent and divergent validity (Correlations with the NHP) and known group validity. The QoL-AGHDA was successfully translated into the target languages with minimal problems. Cognitive debriefing interviewees (n = 15-18) found the measures easy to complete and identified few problems with the content. Internal consistency (Czech Republic = 0.91, Poland = 0.91, Serbia = 0.91 and Slovakia = 0.89) and reproducibility (Czech Republic = 0.91, Poland = 0.91, Serbia = 0.88 and Slovakia = 0.93) were good in all adaptations. Convergent and divergent validity and known group validity data were not available for Slovakia. The QoL-AGHDA correlated as expected with the NHP scales most relevant to GHD. The QoL-AGHDA was able to distinguish between participants based on a range of variables. The QoL-AGHDA was successfully adapted for use in the Czech Republic, Poland, Serbia and Slovakia. Further validation of the Slovakian version would be beneficial. The addition of these new language versions will prove valuable to multinational clinical trials and to clinical practice in the respective countries.\n\nEpiphytic lichen mycota of the virgin forest reserve Rajhenavski Rog (Slovenia)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBilovitz, Peter O.; BatiÄ, Franc; Mayrhofer, Helmut\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA list of 128 taxa (127 species) of lichens, 6 species of lichenicolous fungi and 2 non-lichenized fungi traditionally included in lichenological literature from the virgin forest Rajhenavski Rog and its surroundings in the southeastern part of Slovenia is presented.

Nevertheless, more than 150 deposits and occurrences have been recorded and some of them preliminarily explored in the last 50 years. The majority of deposits and occurrences are located within the Serbo-Macedonian metallogenic province and the most significant metallogenic units at the existing level of knowledge are the Fruska Gora ore district, Cer ore district, Sumadija metallogenic zone, Kopaonik metallogenic zone and Lece-Halkidiki metallogenic zone. The most important genetic type of deposits is hydrothermal, particularly in case of serpentinite/peridotite as host/parent rock. Placer deposits are also economically important. The dominant gemstones are silica minerals: chalcedony (Chrysoprase, carnelian, bluish chalcedony etc.), jasper (picture, landscape, red etc.), common opal (dendritic, green, milky white etc.), silica masses (undivided), and quartz (rock crystal, amethyst etc.). Beside silica minerals significant gemstones in Serbia include also beryl (aquamarine), garnet (almandine and pyrope), tourmaline, fluorite, rhodochrosite, carbonate-silica breccia, carbonate-silica onyx, silicified wood, howlite, serpentinite, marble onyx, and kyanite. This paper aims to present an overview of Serbian gemstone deposits and occurrences and their position based on a simplified gemstone metallogenic map of Serbia, as well as genetic-industrial classification of gemstone deposits and gemstone varieties.\n\nAvailability of pediatric-evaluated formulations in Serbia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBoÅ¾iÄ, Bojana; Stupar, Sanja; Stupar, DuÅ¡ko; BabiÄ, UroÅ¡; BajÄetiÄ, Milica\n\n2017-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to analyze the availability and coverage by health insurance reimbursement of pediatric formulations labeled for children up to the age of 12 in Serbia. To provide good insight in general availability of pediatric medicines, results were compared with the World Health Organization's (WHO) âModel List of Essential Medicines for Childrenâ and with published evidence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sources of information about medicines are the Summary of Product Characteristics, National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) Drug Lists, WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines for Children, and Serbia's official drug registry (2013). RESULTS: Out of total number of medicines in Serbia, only 49% (496) were available for children. Of all available drugs for children, 66% were with license and majority were parenteral formulation (57%), followed by drugs for local use (28%) and formulations for oral use (23%). The lowest availability of medicines was for children 0â27 days. From the total number of licensed medicines for children up to 12 years old, NHIF covers 64% of drugs. The availability of the WHO essential medicines for children in Serbia was 51%, from which 92% were licensed for pediatric use. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated the alarming lack of pediatric suitable formulations in Serbia. Significant differences in the availability of drugs suitable for children exist worldwide. From global health point of view, the differences in the access to children formulations should, therefore, be of the highest priority.

Depositional conditions with high sedimentation rates allowed exceptional preservation of plant remains. The plant assemblage consists of (1) conifers represented by foliage of Pinus hepios and Tetraclinis salicornioides, a seed cone of Pinus cf. ornata, and by pollen of the Cupressaceae, Pinaceae, Pinus sp. and Cathaya sp., and (2) angiosperms represented by Cinnamomum polymorphum, Platanus neptuni, Potamogeton sp. and lauroid foliage, by pollen of Liquidambar sp., Engelhardia sp. and Craigia sp., and in particular by infructescences (so far interpreted as belonging to cereal ears). We validate genus and species assignments of the infructescences: they belong to Palaeotriticum SitÃ¡r, including P. mockii SitÃ¡r and P. carpaticum SitÃ¡r, and probably represent herbaceous monocots that inhabited coastal marshes, similar to the living grass Spartina. Similar infructescences occur in the Lower and Middle Miocene deposits of the Carpathian Foredeep (Slup in Moravia), Tunjice Hills (Å½ale in Slovenia), and probably also in the Swiss Molasse (Lausanne). This plant assemblage demonstrates that the paleovegetation was represented by evergreen woodland with pines and grasses in undergrowth, similar to vegetation inhabiting coastal brackish marshes today. It also indicates subtropical climatic conditions in the Vienna Basin (central Paratethys), similar to those implied by other coeval plant assemblages from Central Europe\n\n77 FR 12935 - Federal Acquisition Regulation; New Designated Country (Armenia) and Other Trade Agreements Updates\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-03-02\n\n... necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic... regarding the burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions..., Macao China, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain...\n\n31 CFR 586.304 - Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia & Montenegro); FRY (S&M).\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n...

In planning future national health policy actions, inter - regional assessments play an important role. The purpose of the study was to analyze similarities and differences in premature mortality between Serbia, EURO A, EURO B, and EURO C regions in 2000. Mortality and premature mortality patterns were analysed according to cause of death, by gender and seven age intervals. The study results are presented in relative (%) and absolute terms (age-specific and age-standardized death rates per 100,000 population, and age-standardized rates of years of life lost - YLL per 1,000). Direct standardization of rates was undertaken using the standard population of Europe. The inter-regional comparison was based on a calculation of differences in YLL structures and with a ratio of age-standardized YLL rates per 1,000. A multivariate generalized linear model was used to explore mortality of Serbia and Europe sub-regions with ln age-specific death rates. The dissimilarity was achieved with a p = 0.05. According to the mortality pattern, Serbia was similar to EURO B, but with a lower average YLL per death case. YLL patterns indicated similarities between Serbia and EURO A, while SRR YLL had similarities between Serbia and EURO B. Compared to all Europe sub-regions, Serbia had a major excess of premature mortality in neoplasms and diabetes mellitus. Serbia had lost more years of life than EURO A due to cardiovascular, genitourinary diseases, and intentional injuries. Yet, Serbia was not as burdened with communicable diseases and injuries as were EURO B and EURO C. With a premature mortality pattern, Serbia is placed in the middle position of the Europe triangle. The main excess of YLL in Serbia was due to cardiovascular, malignant diseases, and diabetes mellitus. The results may be used for assessment of unacceptable\n\n[Familial Mediterranean fever - first experiences in Slovakia].\n\nPubMed\n\nDallos, TomÃ¡Å¡; GÃ¡lovÃ¡, Lucia LukÃ¡ÄikovÃ¡; MacejkovÃ¡, Eva; SedlaÄko, Jozef; Toplak, NataÅ¡a; Debeljak, MaruÅ¡a; Sargsyan, Hasmik; IlenÄÃ­kovÃ¡, Denisa; KovÃ¡cs, LÃ¡szlÃ³\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFamilial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most prevalent genetically determined autoinflammatory disease. FMF significantly decreases the quality of life and limits life expectancy due to the development of amyloidosis in affected individuals. Prevalence of FMF is highest in the south-eastern Mediterraneans. In other parts of the world, its occurance is often restricted to high-risk ethnic groups. In Central Europe, experience with FMF is scarse to none, as in the case of Slovakia, where no cases have been reported, so far. Herein we report the first five patients (3 adults and 2 children, 4 native Slovaks) in whom the diagnosis of FMF could be confirmed in Slovakia. Our experience demonstrates that FMF does occur in low-risk populations in Central Europe. Due to low prevalence and lack of experience, FMF diagnosis may be significantly delayed (4.5-30 years) and undiagnosed cases are to be expected in our population.\n\nFactors related to consultation time: Experience in Slovenia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPetek Å ter, Marija; Å vab, Igor; Å½ivÄec Kalan, Gordana\n\n2008-01-01\n\nObjective Consultation time has a serious impact on physiciansâ work and patient satisfaction. No systematic study of consultation time in general practice in Slovenia has yet been carried out. The aim of the present study was to measure consultation time, to identify the factors influencing it, and to study the influence of the workload of general practitioners on consultation time. Design A total of 42 general practitioners participated in this cross-sectional study. Each physician collected data from 300 consecutive consultations and measured the length of the visit. Setting Forty-two randomly selected general practices in Slovenia. Subjects Patients of 42 general practices. Main outcome measures Average consultation time in general practice in Slovenia; factors influencing consultation time in Slovenia. Results Data from 12 501 visits to the surgery were collected. A quarter of all visits (25.5%) were administrative. The mean consultation time was 6.9 minutes (median 6.0 minutes, 5%â95% interval: 1.0â16.0 minutes). Longer consultation time was predicted by: patient-related factors (female gender, higher age, higher level of education, higher number of health problems, change of physician within the last year), physician-related factors (higher age), physiciansâ workload (absence of high workload), and the type of visit (consultation and/or clinical examination). Conclusion Consultation time in general practice is short, and depends on the characteristics of the patient and the physician, the physician's workload, and the type of visit. A reduction of high workload in general practice should be one of the priorities of the healthcare system.

Methods Public sources of data on brucellosis were used, including official reports of infectious diseases and epidemics, as well as monthly and annual reports of the Serbia and Vojvodina Institutes of Public Health. Results From 1980 through 2008, there were 1521 human brucellosis cases in Serbia. The annual number ranged from 2 in 2000 to 324 in 1991. Infections occurred more often in men (67% of cases) than in women (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.57-3.00; Ï2â=â24.52, Pâ<â0.001). The largest number of patients over the entire study period (1184) was recorded in Kosovo and Metohija, which accounted for 78% of the total number of patients. The maximum incidence rate in Kosovo and Metohija was 12 per 100â000 in 1991. In Vojvodina, the first autochthonous human cases of brucellosis were recorded in 1999, and 101 affected persons were registered by the end of 2008. During the period 1994-2008, the largest number of patients in Serbia was recorded from June to September (310 of 623 cases, 50%). The disease was most prevalent among people aged 30-49 years, accounting for 81 of 177 (46%) of the cases in Serbia from 1999 to 2008. Conclusion Brucellosis has been a significant public health concern in Serbia. This problem may be solved by joint efforts of all relevant factors, first of all human and veterinary medical services.

Gold and bismuth were found as predominant impurities, which allowed distribution of coins into two groups. Coins with the predominant Bi impurity were minted from silver that was very likely mined in Carinthia and diffusion of this type of silver towards the mints in eastern Slovenia was observed. This finding confirms the historical hypothesis that silver currency in this period was largely produced for the trade with the east.\n\nExtreme daily precipitation: the case of Serbia in 2014\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nToÅ¡iÄ, Ivana; UnkaÅ¡eviÄ, Miroslava; PutnikoviÄ, Suzana\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe extreme daily precipitation in Serbia was examined at 16 stations during the period 1961-2014. Two synoptic situations in May and September of 2014 were analysed, when extreme precipitation was recorded in western and eastern Serbia, respectively. The synoptic situation from 14 to 16 May 2014 remained nearly stationary over the western and central Serbia for the entire period. On 15 May 2014, the daily rainfall broke previous historical records in Belgrade (109.8 mm), Valjevo (108.2 mm) and Loznica (110 mm). Precipitation exceeded 200 mm in 72 h, producing the most catastrophic floods in the recent history of Serbia. In Negotin (eastern Serbia), daily precipitation of 161.3 mm was registered on 16 September 2014, which was the maximum value recorded during the period 1961-2014. The daily maximum in 2014 was registered at 6 out of 16 stations. The total annual precipitation for 2014 was the highest for the period 1961-2014 at almost all stations in Serbia. A non-significant positive trend was found for all precipitation indices: annual daily maximum precipitation, the total precipitation in consecutive 3 and 5 days, the total annual precipitation, and number of days with at least 10 and 20 mm of precipitation. The generalised extreme value distribution was fitted to the annual daily maximum precipitation. The estimated 100-year return levels were 123.4 and 147.4 mm for the annual daily maximum precipitation in Belgrade and Negotin, respectively.\n\nCancer mortality in central Serbia.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarkovic-Denic, Ljiljana; Cirkovic, Andia; Zivkovic, Snezana; Stanic, Danica; Skodric-Trifunovic, Vesna\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCancer is the one of the leading cause of death worldwide. The aim of this study was to examine cancer mortality trends in the population of central Serbia in the period from 2002 to 2011. The descriptive epidemiological method was used. The mortality from all malignant tumors (code C00-C96 of the International Disease Classification) was registered. The source of mortality data was the published material of the Cancer Registry of Serbia. The source of population data was the census of 2002 and 2011 and the estimates for inter-census years. Non-standardized, age-adjusted and age-specific mortality rates were calculated. Age adjustment of mortality rates was performed by the direct method of standardization. Trend lines were estimated using linear regression. During 2002-2011, cancer caused about 20% of all deaths each year in central Serbia. More men (56.9%) than women (43.1%) died of cancer. The average mortality rate for men was 1.3 times higher compared to women. A significant trend of increase of the age-adjusted mortality rates was recorded both for males (p<0.001) and for females (p=0.02). Except gastric cancer, the age-adjusted mortality rates in men were significantly increased for lung cancer (p=0.02), colorectal cancer (p<0.05), prostate cancer (p=0.01) and pancreatic cancer (p=0.01). Age-adjusted mortality rates for breast cancer in females were remarkably increased (p=0.01), especially after 2007. In central Serbia during the period from 2002 to 2011, there was an increasing trend in mortality rates due to cancers in both sexes. Cancer mortality in males was 1.3-fold higher compared to females.\n\nMapping Women's and Gender Studies in the Academic Field in Slovenia\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGaber, Milica Antic\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe aim of the present paper is to map the development of women's and gender studies (WGS) in the academic field in Slovenia.

Public complaints remain an important issue due to differences in public sensitivity to noise and due to several cases where a measurement of noise intensity does not give a satisfying solution to the problem. The unresolved problem remaining in the residential neighborhoods is the noise from pubs and restaurants that are open until late in the night. In our review, we compiled information on the institutions responsible for the implementation of environmental noise legislation and organizations that are responsible for dealing with public complaints. Information on activities for increasing public awareness on hazards rising from environmental noise and the role of civil initiative was explored. In seven countries, and among them, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, and Poland, the responsibilities and duties are shared among different institutions at national and regional levels, depending on the noise source. The problem of gathering information on complaints and using it for improving the wellbeing and health of citizens remains often difficult and unsolved.\n\nFind a Hematologist\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

However, incidence and prevalence of RTT are scarcely reported. A retrospective study included all patients with RTT diagnosed between 1981 and 2012 in Serbia. Estimation of incidence and prevalence was calculated on the basis of vital statistics reported by Statistical Office of Republic of Serbia. From 1981 to 2012, RTT has been diagnosed in 102 girls in Serbia. Incidence of RTT in Serbia is estimated at 0.586:10,000 female live births. We estimated the prevalence of RTT in population of females younger than 19 years at 1:8,439. Death occurred in 19 patients (18.63%), with pneumonia as the most common cause. The lethal outcome by the age of 12 years could be expected for 11% of patients. The mean age at diagnosis was 3.5 years and we have confirmed a significant trend towards earlier dianosis during studied period. Rett syndrome incidence in Serbia is in accordance with reports from other countries. Serbian RTT patients have increased risk for early death when compared to patients in more developed countries, most commonly due to pneumonia. There was significant trend towards early diagnosis of RTT in Serbia over recent decades. Â© 2015 S.

To study and compare organizational approaches to the organization of dental care in Ukraine and Slovakia. In the course of the work we used statistical, bibliosemantic methods and the method of structural and logical analysis, the data of the statistical branch reporting of Ukraine, Slovakia and the data of the European database âªHealth for Allâ« were used. It is established that the provision of the population with educational institutions for future dentists in Ukraine is one university for 2154566 people, and in Slovakia - one for 676 764 people. Obviously, access to dental education in the Slovak Republic is better than in Ukraine. In the course of the study, we found that the level of provision of dentists for 10 thousand people in Ukraine is 4.56, and in Slovakia-5.75, which is 26% more than in Ukraine. In Slovakia, the level of availability of dentists is 5.75, too, with a reliable difference in the profile of administrative territories Conclusion. Both countries are working to achieve international goals to ensure dental health for the period till 2025. Therefore, the exchange of good experience, which gained in Ukraine and Slovakia for the organization of dental care will improve the performance of dental services of both countries to achieve these goals.\n\nWho Is Guarding Serbia’s Borders?

Among the most exposed regions in this regard should the area of southeastern and eastern Austria and south-western Slovakia. The relatively faster increase in the number of heat waves in this area is related also to potential desertification in this region just east of the Alps, since during summer, weather fronts advancing from the west are consequently losing their original features and moderating influence. Summer weather patterns for this area should in the future more closely remind climate typical for some inland areas of southwestern, southern and southeastern Europe. A certain shift of climate zones from south to north should thus modify future climate and Slovakia. Despite the complex natural conditions the existing trends derived from results of meteorological measurements and observations are clear and they confirm warming of climate in this region. Observations and measurements in the recent years of the 21st century confirm, that heat waves are no longer rare phenomenon during summer, but are systematically appearing even in colder regions of northern Slovakia. What is very remarkable and will be necessary to pay more attention to, is the fact that these heat waves are expanding into previously unaffected areas, associated with the lack of rainfall and drought, on larger regional scale. In this study heat wave periods and individual heat events and days are statistically identified in the time series characteristics of air temperature at selected meteorological stations for the period from the mid-20th century until 2015, in case of available historical data even for longer period.\n\nMolecular detection of emerging tick-borne pathogens in Vojvodina, Serbia.\n\nPubMed\n\nPotkonjak, Aleksandar; GutiÃ©rrez, Ricardo; SaviÄ, Sara; VraÄar, Vuk; Nachum-Biala, Yaarit; JuriÅ¡iÄ, Aleksandar; Kleinerman, Gabriela; Rojas, Alicia; PetroviÄ, Aleksandra; Baneth, Gad; Harrus, Shimon\n\n2016-02-01\n\nTicks play an important role in disease transmission globally due to their capability to serve as vectors for human and animal pathogens. The Republic of Serbia is an endemic area for a large number of tick-borne diseases. However, current knowledge on these diseases in Serbia is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of new emerging tick-borne pathogens in ticks collected from dogs and the vegetation from different parts of Vojvodina, Serbia. A total of 187 ticks, including 124 Rhipicephalus sanguineus, 45 Ixodes ricinus and 18 Dermacentor reticulatus were collected from dogs. In addition, 26 questing I. ricinus ticks were collected from the vegetation, using the flagging method, from 4 different localities in Vojvodina, Serbia. DNA was extracted from each tick individually and samples were tested by either conventional or real-time PCR assays for the presence of Rickettsia spp.-DNA (gltA and ompA gene fragments), Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp.-DNA (16S rRNA gene fragment) and Hepatozoon spp./Babesia spp.-DNA (18S rRNA gene fragment). In addition, all I. ricinus DNA samples were tested for Bartonella spp.-DNA (ITS locus) by real-time PCR. In this study, the presence of novel emerging tick-borne pathogens including Rickettsia raoultii, Rickettsia massiliae, Babesia venatorum, Babesia microti, Hepatozoon canis and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis was identified for the first time in Serbia. Our findings also confirmed the presence of Rickettsia monacensis, Babesia canis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in ticks from Serbia. The findings of the current study highlight the great diversity of tick-borne pathogens of human and animal importance in Serbia. Physicians, public health workers and veterinarians should increase alertness to the presence of these tick-borne pathogens in this country. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Increasing demand for goat meat is likely to promote the role of this animal for human toxoplasmosis. As there are virtually no data on toxoplasmosis in goats in Serbia, we undertook a cross-sectional serological study, including prediction modelling using geographical information systems (GIS). Sera from 431 goats reared in 143 households/farms throughout Serbia, sampled between January 2010 and September 2011, were examined for T. gondii antibodies by a modified agglutination test. Seroprevalence was 73.3% at the individual level and 84.6% at the farm level. Risk factor analysis showed above two-fold higher risk of infection for goats used for all purposes compared to dairy goats (P = 0.012), almost seven-fold higher risk for goats kept as sole species versus those kept with other animals (P = 0.001) and a two-fold lower risk for goats introduced from outside the farm compared to those raised on the farm (P = 0.027). Moreover, households/farms located in centre-eastern Serbia were found to be less often infected than those in northern Serbia (P = 0.004). The risk factor analysis was fully supported by spatial analysis based on a GIS database containing data on origin, serology, land cover, elevation, meteorology and a spatial prediction map based on kriging analysis, which showed western Serbia as the area most likely for finding goats positive for T. gondii and centre-eastern Serbia as the least likely. In addition, rainfall favoured seropositivity, whereas temperature, humidity and elevation did not.\n\n22 CFR 228.03 - Identification of principal geographic code numbers.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-04-01\n\n..., Belarus, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Georgia...*, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, People's Republic of China, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Serbia*, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden...\n\nAttitudes to Bilingual Education in Slovenia\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNovak Lukanovic, Sonja; Limon, David\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe two different models of bilingual/multilingual education that have been developed in Slovenia since the 1950s in the regions of Prekmurje (minority language Hungarian) and Slovene Istria (Italian) are the result of international agreements, education and language policies, social and demographic factors.

The most widely used methods for the determination of intensity and direction of the archaeomegnetic field by demagnetisation of the sample material are the alternating field (AF) demagnetisation and the Thellier double heating method. These methods are used not only for archaeomagnetic studies but also help to solve some geological problems. The two methods were applied to samples collected recently at several sites of Slovakia, where archaeological prospection invoked by earthwork or reconstruction work of developing projects demanded archaeomagnetic dating. Then we discuss advantages and weaknesses of the investigated methods from different perspectives based on several examples and our recent experience.\n\nAraneae Sloveniae: a national spider species checklist\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKostanjÅ¡ek, Rok; Kuntner, MatjaÅ¾\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAbstract The research of the spider fauna of Slovenia dates back to the very beginning of binomial nomenclature, and has gone through more and less prolific phases with authors concentrating on taxonomy, faunistics, ecology and zoogeographic reviews.

The aim of this study was to map the occurrence of orofacial clefts reported in the area of Eastern Slovakia during the years 1996-2013. Also, we compared the occurrence of different types of clefts between the groups in relation to gender and ethnicity. The statistical analysis shows relationship between variables of location and gender and gender differences in the occurrence of various types of clefts. Moreover, in comparison with another study which analyzed the years 1985-2000 (1.29/10(3) live births), there was an increase in the incidence (1.42/10(3) live births) of OC in Eastern Slovakia. Our findings seem contradictive to similar studies which discuss ethnic differences in relation to OC. We recognize the relatively high occurrence of OC in Eastern Slovakia, and we link this phenomenon to several extrinsic factors, in particular socioeconomic status and embryotoxic factors.

Most studies focus on access to opioids for the treatment of severe (cancer) pain. This study aims to identify specific access barriers for patients with opioid dependence in legislation and regulations of 11 central and eastern European countries. This study builds on a previous analysis of legislation and regulations as part of the EU 7th Framework Access To Opioid Medication in Europe (ATOME) project. An in-depth analysis was undertaken to determine specific barriers for patients with opioid dependence in need of opioid analgesics or opioid agonist therapy (OAT). For each country, the number and nature of specific potential barriers for these patients were assessed according to eight categories: prescribing; dispensing; manufacturing; usage; trade and distribution; affordability; penalties; and other. An additional keyword search was conducted to minimize the omission of barriers. Barriers in an additional category, language, were recorded qualitatively. Countries included Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Turkey. Ten of the 11 countries (all except Estonia) showed specific potential barriers in their legislation and regulations. The total number of barriers varied from two (Slovenia) to 46 (Lithuania); the number of categories varied from one (Slovenia) to five (Lithuania). Most specific potential barriers were shown in the categories 'prescribing', 'usage' and 'other'. The total number in a single category varied from one to 18 (Lithuania, prescribing). Individual differences between countries in the same specific potential barrier were shown; for example, variation in minimum age criteria for admission to OAT ranging from 15 (Lithuania, in special cases) to 20Â years (Greece). All countries had stigmatizing language in their legislation\n\n40 CFR Appendix C to Subpart A of... - Parties to the Montreal Protocol, and Nations Complying With, But Not Parties to, the Protocol\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-07-01\n\n... â â â â Slovakia â â â â â Slovenia â â â â â Solomon Island â â â â Somalia â â â â â South Africa â â â Spain... 118.

The algorithms are verified against ground observations of hail at manned stations in the period between May and August, from 2002 to 2010. The algorithms are optimized by determining the optimal values of all possible algorithm parameters. A number of different contingency-table-based scores are evaluated with a combination of Critical Success Index and frequency bias proving to be the best choice for optimization. The best performance indexes are given by Waldvogel and the severe hail index, followed by vertically integrated liquid and maximum radar reflectivity. Using the optimal parameter values, a hail frequency climatology map for the whole of Slovenia is produced. The analysis shows that there is a considerable variability of hail occurrence within the Republic of Slovenia. The hail frequency ranges from almost 0 to 1.7 hail days per year with an average value of about 0.7 hail days per year.\n\nEducation in Medical Biochemistry in Serbia\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nMedical biochemistry is the usual name for clinical biochemistry or clinical chemistry in Serbia.
