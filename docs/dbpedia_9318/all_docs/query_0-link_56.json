ISO 4217 is the international standard that assigns three-letter codes to currencies. It aims to uniquely identify each currency for use in international trade and commerce. The first two letters are usually the ISO 3166 country code and the third letter is typically the initial of the currency name or related to its name. Along with the alphabetic code, each currency is also assigned a three-digit numeric code. The standard also specifies whether each currency has minor currency units and the exponent value relating the major and minor units.",
