structures\n\nThe business activity organization and conduct in Montenegro is basically regulated by the Company Law according to which there is following modes of business organization possible to establish:\n\nEntrepreneur,\n\nPartnership,\n\nLimited Partnership,\n\nJoint Stock Company,\n\nLimited Liability Company, and\n\nForeign Entity Branch.\n\nOut of the above stated modes of business organization, taking into consideration information collected and experiences, there are two models that are usually used by foreigners “Limited Liability Company” and “Foreign Entity Branch”.\n\nLimited Liability Company (LLC)\n\nLLC is a form of business organization highly recommended to be established for various aspects, that is to say:\n\nIt can be organized by foreign and domestic individuals and legal entities, equally,\n\nFounders are liable for the company’s actions up to the amount of their equity in the company,\n\nThere is no minimum number of founders and maximum is 30,\n\nMinimum amount of founding capital is 1,00 EUR, and there is no maximum,\n\nRegistered founding capital must be fully paid, but also can be disposed of freely,\n\nThere are no registered or bearer shares, but founders hold equities in the company,\n\nCompany’s obligatory bodies are Assembly and Executive Director, while Board of Directors is optional,\n\nIn a one-founder company, a Founder exercises all rights and obligations of the Assembly,\n\nEquities are not registered with the Securities Commission,\n\nExecutive Director can be only an individual, and not corporate structure,\n\nLLC gains the status of independent legal entity as of the date of its registration with Montenegrin Company Registry (Company registry).\n\nLLC is a form of business organization used most often by both domestic and foreign investors, mostly because of its independency and limited liability towards the Founder, as well as for the reasons that Foreign Entity Branch at this moment, and according to its practical functions in this jurisdiction, does not provide to the mother company any favourable aspect in this type of organization, that is better elaborated below.\n\nForeign Entity Branch (Branch)\n\nForeign Entity Branch is the type of business organization used sometimes by the foreign investors, for the following reasons and with the following practical aspects, that is to say:\n\nBranch must be registered with the Company registry,\n\nIt must conduct business activity in full compliance with the Montenegrin regulations,\n\nAll changes in the mother company, Branch must report with the Company registry,\n\nForeign Entity Branch does not have a status of an independent legal entity,\n\nBranch has its Founder/Mother Company and Authorised Representative as equivalent to the Executive Director in the LLC,\n\nTaking into consideration practical requirements of the state and municipality bodies, in all aspects of its function, Branch is equal to the LLC and requirements attached to the status of LLC.\n\nTaking into consideration that, as practice showed the Branch is not interpreted in the sense and as a legal institution of foreign legal systems, as such form of organization currently must have all requisites as LLC, as : Tax and VAT Number, employed Authorised Representative, paid social security contributions, engaged business premises and pertaining business license, its own annual financial report and obligation to pay income tax, and others, almost all foreign investors organized before in such a form are currently trying to make new establishment as LLC, as consolidation between mother and daughter company became impossible.\n\nThe Ultimate beneficial Owners Register\n\nThe UBO Register has been established in 2021 in line with the requirements of European law to increase transparency and prevent the abuse of the financial systems: for laundering money, for example, and for financing terrorism.\n\nCompanies, legal entities, associations, institutions, political parties, religious communities, artistic organizations, chambers, trade unions, employers’ associations, foundations or other business entities, legal entities that receive, manage or allocate funds for certain purposes, foreign trust funds, foreign institutions or similar entities of foreign law, which receive, manage or distribute assets for certain purposes are required to register UBO.\n\nEntrepreneurs, one-member limited liability company and direct and indirect budget users are released from the obligation to register the beneficial owner.\n\nCurrent opportunities & future prospects\n\nBusiness zones\n\nGovernment of Montenegro has adopted the Decree on Business Zones which has the goal of stimulating business development and creating more attractive investment opportunities.\n\nA business zone represents a developed area in construction terms, which is fully equipped with utility infrastructure and directed at production activities and favourable conditions for investment.\n\nThis Decree on Business Zones regulates the conditions for the establishment of business zones, according to the classification of strategic importance, the establishment, organization and management, improvement of infrastructure in business zones and other issues relevant to the work of business zones.\n\nThere are eight bussiness zones in Montenegro.\n\nBusiness zones are divided to:\n\nBusiness zones of strategic interest;\n\nBusiness zones of local government interest.\n\nBusiness zone can be founded by State or units of local governments.\n\nLocation of business zone could be owned by the State, units of local governments or could be private property.\n\nThe business zone of strategic interest shall be founded by the Government of Montenegro, independently or in a cooperation with the other founder.\n\nDepartment of units of local governments shall found the business zone of the local interest, independently, or in a cooperation with the other founder, with the prior consent of the Ministry.\n\nThe beneficiaries of business zones will have more encouraging work conditions in terms of lower costs and resolved infrastructural problems.\n\nSuch benefits are intended for small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in light industries which do not harm the environment.\n\nThese include industrial branches whose production is focused on the means of consumption (food, textiles, tobacco, furniture and electronics industries and the finishing and assembling of final products).\n\nBusiness incentives offered by the zones are:\n\nDeveloped land with all the necessary permits;\n\nLower lease prices of business premises;\n\nReduced administrative costs;\n\nIntegration of complementary business activities;\n\nOther business incentives.\n\nThe government offers in this regard in the partnership with local municipalities, some incentives through business zones, which exist in several cities outside the capital.\n\nInvestment Incentives\n\nIn accordance to the Decree on Direct Investment Incentives the Montenegrin government offers financial incentives to investors based on the value of their investment. These incentives refer equally to Montenegrin and foreign entities or investors that can benefit from these incentives.\n\nFor investments greater than EUR 500,000 that create at least 20 new jobs within three years from the date of signing the incentive agreement, both domestic and foreign investors can apply for cash grants in the amount of EUR 3,000-10,000 per every new job created. For investments in the North and Central region, except for the capital Podgorica, the minimum investment is EUR 250,000 with a threshold of creating 10 new jobs. For capital investments greater than EUR 10 million that create at least 50 new jobs, incentives can be awarded in the amount of up to 17 % of the investment value. These incentives also include refunds on infrastructure development costs incurred in the process of completing the investment project.\n\nPrivatisation\n\nDecision on Privatization Plan for 2023 sets out the goals and methods of privatization, enterprises and capital for privatization, the conditions for their implementation, as well as the locations that need to be valued and the social aspects of the privatization process. The main goal of privatization is to increase the competitiveness and efficiency of the functioning of companies, encourage foreign investments and entrepreneurship in all areas, increase employment and improve living standards, as stated in the Decision.\n\nIt is planned to continue the procedure for the privatization of the Institute “Dr Simo Milošević” LLC Igalo via the sale of shares. The privatization procedure will continue in accordance with the ruling of the Administrative Court.\n\nFurthermore, it is planned to start the preparation and implementation of public tenders for the privatization of the following companies:\n\nHG “Budvanska rivijera” AD Budva (sale of shares),\n\n“Castello Montenegro” AD Pljevlja (sale of shares),\n\n“Institut za crnu metalurgiju ” AD Nikšić (sale of shares and/or recapitalization),\n\n“Montepranzo Bokaprodukt” AD Tivat (sale of shares) and\n\n“TC Durmitor” DOO Žabljak (sale of 100% stake).\n\nIt was emphasized by The Privatization and Capital Projects Council during the passing of the Draft Decision on the Privatization Plan for 2023 that listed companies have very valuable state assets that have not been used in an appropriate way in terms of creating new value, making profits, raising the quality of products and services, creating new jobs, which was the main reason for proposing their privatization. In this context, it was especially emphasized that precise tender conditions and criteria will be determined for each company individually.\n\nUltimately, the sale of following companies’ shares through the stock exchange is envisaged:\n\nAD “Agrotransport” – Podgorica;\n\n“Kotor – projekt” AD – Kotor;\n\nAD “Metal produkt” – Podgorica;\n\nAD “Montenegroturist” – Budva and\n\n“Crnagoracoop” AD – Danilovgrad.\n\nLegal System and Judicial Independence\n\nMontenegro’s legal system is of a civil, continental type based on Roman law.\n\nIn accordance to the Law on Courts the judicial system consisting of three levels of courts: Basic, High, and the Supreme Court. Montenegro established the Appellate Court and the Administrative Court in 2005 for the appellate jurisdiction in criminal and commercial matters, and specialized jurisdiction in administrative matters. The specialized Commercial Court has first instance jurisdiction in commercial matters. Apart from those, there are also specialized Misdemeanours Courts.\n\nLegislative reforms from the last several years effect the efficiency and effectiveness of court proceedings which is already visible through the introduction of the Public Enforcement Agents.\n\nFor clients it is important to act in accordance to the regulation in force, in order to prevent the penalties and possible court disputes. In that regard it is important also to have experienced law firm who will advice the client drying the investment activities.\n\nForeign Exchange\n\nIn Montenegro are no limitations placed on the transfer of foreign currency.\n\nThe Foreign Investment Law guarantees the right to transfer and refund profits in Montenegro, and there are not difficulties in the free transfer of funds exercised on the basis of profit, repayment of resources, or residual assets.\n\nSector opportunities in Montenegro\n\nENERGY\n\nThe energy sector represents one of the strategic development areas in which Montenegro has great untapped potential.\n\nThe strategic development objectives of the energy sector are defined in the National Energy Development Strategy of Montenegro by 2025, where building of new capacities for hydro and thermal power plants is planned, including small hydro power plants and other renewable and alternative energy sources.\n\nThere are already completed several projects as it is construction of the submarine interconnection cable between Montenegro and Italy as well as two wind farms in Montenegro – Krnovo, with a capacity of 72MWh; and Mozura, with a capacity of 46MWh which are currently in operation.\n\nMontenegro has the potential to develop solar energy also because Montenegro is “rich” with solar radiation due to a good geographical position and there are started several projects in this area.\n\nTOURISM\n\nTourism records the most dynamic development and influences the growth of agriculture and food processing industry, transport, telecommunication, trade, as well as a whole set of other branches.\n\nMontenegro Tourism Development Strategy 2022-2025 provides guidelines for future activities in the direction of ensuring full and quality valorization of all potentials in a dynamic and optimal way, in accordance with current market circumstances and respecting the principles of sustainability, which relate to operational goals, namely: improved regulatory framework in tourism with formalization of tourism turnover; improved tourist and accompanying infrastructure and superstructure; improved quality and quantity of accommodation capacities; improved quality of diversified tourism product; improved human resources and skills in tourism; development of digital, innovative solutions and new technologies in tourism, and a globally recognized tourist destination.\n\nICT SECTOR\n\nOne of the crucial industries for the Montenegrin economy’s recovery is the ICT industry.

It is predicted that Montenegro will join EU in the next couple of years.\n\nForeign companies can own 100% of a domestic company, and their profits and dividends can be repatriated without limitations or restrictions.\n\nThe Montenegro ranks 50th out of 190 economies in terms of ease of doing business, according to the World Bank Doing Business report.\n\nMontenegro has one of the most competitive tax systems in Europe; qualified and low-cost workforce; touristic potential (sea, mountain, climate); hydroelectric potential; negotiations for accession to the European Union; good quality of education and health systems.\n\nAs there are many incentives for doing business in Montenegro there is no matter in which part of the country you will invest, because in any case it will be a right choice."
