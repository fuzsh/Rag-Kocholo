        "text": "Serbia and Montenegro (Serbian: Србија и Црна Гора, Srbija i Crna Gora, abbreviated as \"SCG\") was the name of the state union of Serbia and Montenegro. They used to be two separate Yugoslav republics. In 2006, they became their own countries.\n\nIt was on the west-central Balkan Peninsula, next Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia on the western sides, Hungary to the north, Romania and Bulgaria to the east, the Republic of Macedonia to the south and Albania to the southwest, with just over 200 km of coast on the Adriatic.\n\nSerbia and Montenegro worked together in only some political areas. The states had separate economic policies and currencies (money). Although both the states now had more freedom to do as they pleased then they did as Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro was still a Sovereign State united under one government.\n\nThe people of Montenegro still wanted independence though, on 21 May 2006 they held a vote to ask the Montenegrin's whether they still wanted to stay in the union. The vote for independence won by 55.5%. On 3 June 2006 Montenegro declared independence; followed by Serbia's deceleration of independence two days later on the 5 June.\n\nImages for kids\n\nMap of the Yugoslav Wars in 1993\n\nMap of the territorial subdivisions of FR Yugoslavia\n\nA Yugoslav passport\n\nSupporters of the national football team during the 2006 FIFA World Cup\n\nMascot of the EuroBasket 2005, hosted by Serbia and Montenegro\n\nSee also"
