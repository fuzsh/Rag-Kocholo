The majestic Mount Lovćen is the heart of the country and the enchanting Adriatic Coast spans 273 km, is indented with pristine sandy beaches, and features the elite Porto Montenegro, one of Europe’s increasingly popular luxury destinations. This natural harbor is home to superyachts, helicopter fleets, exquisite properties, and lavish nightclubs.\n\nNearby lies the medieval town of Kotor, a UNESCO World Heritage Site where the mountainous landscape frames the Venetian, Austrian, and baroque-style buildings. Tourism is the biggest driver of this safe and stable country’s economy, and Montenegro frequently ranks as one of the world’s prime tourist destinations.\n\nThe World Bank classifies Montenegro as one of the fastest-growing Balkan economies, and the nation is quickly establishing itself as a key strategic destination for some of the world’s most important industries.\n\nThe official language is Montenegrin, while Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian are also spoken. The official currency is the euro."
