        "text": "Good governance is essential for development. It helps countries improve economic growth, build human capital, and strengthen social cohesion. The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) are designed to help researchers and analysts assess broad patterns in perceptions of governance across countries and over time.\n\nThe WGI aggregate data from more than 30 think tanks, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and private firms across the world selected on the basis of three key criteria: 1) they are produced by credible organizations; 2) they provide comparable cross-country data; and 3) they are regularly updated. The data reflect the diverse views on governance of many stakeholders worldwide, including tens of thousands of survey respondents and experts.\n\nWe welcome feedback from users â€“ including suggestions for additional data sources. Please email feedback to wgi@worldbank.org.\n\nThe WGI are intended for general cross-country comparisons and for evaluating broad trends over time. When evaluations of the governance reforms of specific countries are required, the WGI should be supplemented with more detailed country-specific information. Because they combine information from data sources produced by many institutions, the WGI do not necessarily reflect the view of any individual institution."
