        "text": "Is Yugoslavia still a country? Does Yugoslavia still exist today? The short answer is no, but here’s everything you need to know about the Yugoslav breakup and its successor states!\n\nTravelling around the Balkans, it’s hard to escape the lingering ghosts of Yugoslavia. That’s no surprise, given that from 1946 until 1992 the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), led by a communist government held together by Josip Broz Tito, ruled over the modern European nations of Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo.\n\nNear Mostar, I once explored Yugoslav fighter jet hangars hidden deep inside the mountainside. In Belgrade, I saw the final resting place of Tito and in Pristina, I admired the brutalist Yugoslav architecture that characterised the communist era.\n\nI’ve met Serbians who idealise the ‘good old’ days when all of Yugoslavia was united, and I’ve met Kosovars who dread a return to the hegemony of a now-dead nation. The Breakup of Yugoslavia was brutal, and from political prisons in Ljubljana to mass graves in Sarajevo, the scars of war can be seen across the Balkans,\n\nI’ve visited all of the former republics that were once united under the Yugoslav ideal, and I’ve always wondered and asked: what’s it like to be from a country which no longer exists? It’s a subject that fascinates me whenever I’m in the region, which is why I decided to put together this guide to the former Yugoslavia. Is Yugoslavia still a country? No. But here’s everything you need to know.\n\nIs Yugoslavia still a country today?\n\n“None of our republics would be anything if we weren’t all together; but we have to create our own history – history of United Yugoslavia, also in the future.”\n\nJosip Broz Tito, Former President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n\nAs I’ve already said, the short answer to the question, ‘Does Yugoslavia still exist?’, is a resounding no, but the longer answer requires a more nuanced response, due to the historical, political and cultural implications.\n\nThe Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, once a prominent federation in southeastern Europe, dissolved in the early 1990s. The six republics that comprised the federation – Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia (including the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina), Montenegro and North Macedonia – gradually declared their independence amidst a series of violent conflicts known as the Yugoslav Wars.\n\nThe geopolitical landscape in the region has significantly changed since then. Today, each former Yugoslav republic exists as an independent nation, each with its own government, political structure and international relationships. The independence of Kosovo, however, remains a contentious issue, as it is not universally recognised, while ‘North Macedonia’ has undergone countless name changes due to regional disputes.\n\nWhile Yugoslavia as a country no longer exists, the cultural and social impact of its existence remains. The shared history, albeit with its tumultuous ending, has left indelible marks on the collective memory of the peoples of these nations. There are those who still identify as Yugoslavs, representing an enduring sense of regional identity that transcends the current political boundaries.\n\nThe legacy of Yugoslavia continues to influence regional politics and international relations. The country’s dissolution and the ensuing conflicts have had lasting impacts on the relationships among these nations and their standing on the global stage.\n\nYugoslavia does not exist as a political entity or geographical location anymore, but nevertheless, its existence and its dissolution have undeniably shaped the region’s present and will continue to impact its future. The echoes of Yugoslavia still resonate, whether in the form of shared history, cultural commonalities or political contention among its successor states.\n\nThe question of Yugoslavia’s existence, therefore, is perhaps best answered not in terms of political geography, but in terms of enduring sociocultural impacts and geopolitical legacies.\n\nRead more: Photos From The Road: Life In The Former Yugoslavia\n\nWhat was Yugoslavia, exactly? A brief history.\n\nYugoslavia was a country in Southeastern Europe that existed for most of the 20th century. Its name, translated to English, means ‘Land of the South Slavs’, reflecting the diverse group of ethnicities that lived within its borders.\n\nThe formation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia came after World War I, uniting several South Slav nations in the aftermath of the war. This included Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, among others, who had previously been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire or neighbouring regions including the Ottoman Empire.\n\nDuring World War II, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was occupied by Axis Powers, and a brutal civil war, fought along ethnic and political lines, ensued. After the war, the country was re-established as a socialist federation under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito, becoming the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1946. The federation was made up of six socialist republics: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia, with Serbia further divided into two autonomous provinces, Vojvodina and Kosovo.\n\nUnder Tito’s rule, communist Yugoslavia managed to maintain a degree of unity and independence despite the pressures of the Cold War. Tito, in fact, was one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement, which consisted of countries that did not want to formally align with either the Western or Eastern Bloc.\n\nFollowing Tito’s death in 1980, political and ethnic tensions grew, leading to the start of the Yugoslav Wars in 1991. By 1992, the country began to break apart, resulting in several bloody conflicts fuelled by ethnic nationalism. By the end of the decade, the country known as Yugoslavia had fragmented into several new nations: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and North Macedonia. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, but this is not universally recognised.\n\nRelated: Is Kosovo a Country? Everything You Need To Know.\n\nFacts about the Former Yugoslavia\n\nBut what was the former Yugoslavia like? What flag did they fly? Where was the capital? Here are a few basic facts to know before travelling to the new nations that seceded from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia:\n\nCapital: The capital of Yugoslavia was Belgrade, which is now the capital of Serbia.\n\nLanguages: The official language was Serbo-Croatian, which was a standardised language that could be written in either the Latin or Cyrillic alphabets. However, multiple dialects and other languages were spoken throughout the federation, including Slovene, Macedonian and Albanian.\n\nCurrency: The official currency of Yugoslavia was the Yugoslav dinar (YUD).\n\nPolitical Structure: Yugoslavia was a socialist federation made up of six socialist republics (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and North Macedonia) and two autonomous provinces within Serbia (Vojvodina and Kosovo).\n\nLeadership: The most notable leader was Josip Broz Tito, who led the country from 1945 until his death in 1980. Tito’s leadership is notable for his balancing act between the Western and Eastern Blocs during the Cold War, with Yugoslavia being one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement.\n\nEconomy: Under Tito, Yugoslavia practised a form of market socialism that included workers’ self-management and social ownership of the means of production. It was considered more liberal and prosperous compared to other socialist economies.\n\nCulture: Despite being a socialist country, Yugoslavia had a unique cultural identity and was more open to Western culture than other Eastern Bloc countries. It had a strong film industry and popular music scene, and was successful in sports, especially basketball, football and water polo.\n\nEnd of Yugoslavia: The federation started to unravel with the death of Tito in 1980. From 1991 to 2001, a series of wars and political upheavals led to the breakup of Yugoslavia into several independent countries.\n\nLegacy: The breakup of Yugoslavia resulted in the formation of seven countries: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Kosovo. The status of Kosovo, however, is disputed, with some countries recognising it as independent from Serbia and others not.\n\nRead more: Is Serbia a Country? Everything You Need to Know.\n\nWhy did Yugoslavia fall apart?\n\n“If Yugoslavia is to exist, it can exist only as an alliance, a confederation of independent states.”\n\nFranjo Tudjman, First President of Croatia.\n\nIn Sarajevo, I remember being humbled by the sight of row upon row of white headstones that filled the slope above the Old Town. The square below my hostel, now filled with people and pigeons, had been a no-go zone during the Siege of Sarajevo, when just crossing the road to buy bread could catch you a sniper’s bullet.\n\nSarajevo, and cities as far spread as Dubrovnik and Mostar, still bear the scars of the Yugoslav Wars that decimated the Balkans in the 1990s, as the nation collapsed into years of chaos and bloodshed that saw ethnic violence reach appalling heights not seen in Europe since the Second World War.\n\nBut what caused the violent Breakup of Yugoslavia? Here are a few of the key reasons for the nation’s demise:\n\nEthnic and Religious Tensions: Yugoslavia was a diverse country, home to many ethnic groups and religions. This included Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Bosniaks Albanians, and others, as well as Orthodox Christians, Catholics and Muslims, among others. Under Josip Broz Tito, Yugoslavia’s long-time leader, these groups coexisted in a delicate balance. However, after Tito’s death in 1980, nationalistic sentiments surged, inflaming ethnic and religious tensions and divisions.\n\nPolitical and Economic Disparities: There were significant political and economic differences among the six Yugoslav republics. Some republics, like Slovenia and Croatia, were wealthier and more oriented toward Western Europe, while others, like Serbia and Montenegro, were poorer and more aligned with Eastern Europe. These disparities created tensions and grievances, particularly in the context of a failing socialist economy and lack of political freedoms.\n\nLeadership Void and Rise of Nationalism: Tito’s death left a leadership void that was never adequately filled. As the centralised power weakened, local leaders began asserting themselves more strongly, often promoting nationalistic and separatist sentiments. The rise of Slobodan Milošević in Serbia, who pushed for greater Serbian control, further stoked divisions and conflicts.\n\nInternational Factors: The end of the Cold War also played a role. As communist regimes across Eastern Europe fell and newly independent nations were moving towards democracy and capitalism, the republics of Yugoslavia also sought to redefine their own political and economic paths.\n\nThese tensions came to a bloody head in the early 1990s, leading to a series of brutal wars — often described as ethnic conflicts — among the republics and ethnic groups. By the late 1990s, the federation had dissolved, and the separate republics became independent countries. The wars and their aftermath left deep scars in the region, the impacts of which are still being felt to this day.\n\nRead more: Where are the Balkans? Everything You Need to Know.\n\nA timeline of the Yugoslav collapse\n\nThe breakup of Yugoslavia was marked by a series of violent conflicts and political upheavals, known as the Yugoslav Wars, which occurred from 1991 to 2001. The complexity of these conflicts makes them difficult to summarise succinctly, so here’s a broad overview:\n\nSlovenian Independence and the Ten-Day War (1991): Slovenia was the first republic to declare independence from Yugoslavia in June 1991, leading to the Ten-Day War. The Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA) attempted to suppress the Slovenian secession, but the conflict ended quickly, with Slovenia effectively achieving its independence.\n\nCroatian War of Independence (1991-1995): Following Slovenia, Croatia declared its independence. Unlike Slovenia, however, Croatia was home to a substantial Serbian minority who, backed by the JNA, opposed the secession. The conflict was marked by heavy fighting, sieges, and the mass displacement of populations. The war ended with Croatian victory and solidified their independence but left deep wounds between the Croatian and Serbian communities.\n\nBosnian War (1992-1995): After Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence, the situation escalated into a brutal conflict involving the Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), Croats and Serbs within its borders. The war was marked by the siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica massacre, both instances of severe war crimes and atrocities, including ethnic cleansing and genocide. The Dayton Agreement in 1995 ended the war and established the country as a federation divided between a Bosniak-Croat Federation and a Serbian Republic.\n\nKosovo War (1998-1999): Ethnic tension between the Kosovar Albanians and Kosovo Serbs escalated into war, leading to a significant humanitarian crisis. The war ended after a NATO intervention against Yugoslavia in 1999, which resulted in the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces and the establishment of UN administration in Kosovo. Kosovo unilaterally declared independence in 2008, but this is not universally recognised.\n\nLater Political Changes: The wars and conflicts eventually led to significant political changes. The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was replaced by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (composed only of Serbia and Montenegro) in 1992. This entity existed until 2003 when it was reconstituted as a looser federation named Serbia and Montenegro. Montenegro declared independence from the union in 2006, followed by Kosovo’s contested independence from Serbia in 2008.\n\nRead more: The Scars of War in Mostar\n\nWhat is Yugoslavia called today?\n\nYugoslavia is now composed of several independent nations:\n\nSlovenia\n\nCroatia\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\nSerbia\n\nMontenegro\n\nNorth Macedonia\n\nKosovo (though its independence is not universally recognised)\n\nEach of these countries has its own unique character, shaped in part by their shared history under the former Yugoslavia but also by their distinct cultures, traditions and experiences.\n\nSlovenia and Croatia, for instance, have integrated themselves with Western Europe and are members of the European Union. On the other hand, Serbia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia, while having aspirations of joining the EU, remain at varying stages of the integration process.\n\nThe case of Kosovo is more complex. While it declared independence from Serbia in 2008, its status is not universally recognised, and it is a topic of ongoing international dispute.\n\nRead more: 14 Places to Visit in Kosovo\n\nThe best places to visit in the former Yugoslavia\n\nThe best way to learn about the former Yugoslavia is to visit the successor countries across the Balkans, where it’s possible to explore the Yugoslav legacy everywhere from museums to old bunkers. Here are a few of the best places to visit:\n\nBelgrade, Serbia: The capital of Serbia was also the capital of Yugoslavia. Here, the Museum of Yugoslavia, including the House of Flowers where Josip Broz Tito is buried, offers comprehensive insights into the Yugoslav era.\n\nSarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina: The city is home to the Museum of Sarajevo and the Sarajevo Tunnel Museum, which provide in-depth information about the Bosnian War. Sarajevo’s Bascarsija (old bazaar) offers a look into the region’s diverse cultural influences.\n\nSrebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina: The Srebrenica-Potočari Memorial and Cemetery is dedicated to the victims of the Srebrenica massacre during the Bosnian War.\n\nDubrovnik, Croatia: While a major tourist destination, known for its Old Town walls and harbour, Dubrovnik also offers a window into the region’s past conflicts at the War Photo exhibition.\n\nZagreb, Croatia: The capital city hosts the Zagreb 80’s Museum, where you can learn more about daily life during the Yugoslav era before the wars broke out.\n\nLjubljana, Slovenia: Slovenia’s National Museum of Contemporary History covers the period of the former Yugoslavia, while Hostel Celica is located within a former political prison.\n\nPristina, Kosovo: The capital of Kosovo has several attractions, including the Kosovo Museum and the NEWBORN monument, which symbolises Kosovo’s declaration of independence.\n\nSkopje, North Macedonia: The Museum of the Macedonian Struggle provides an understanding of the national narrative of North Macedonia.\n\nEach of these countries has its own perspective on the Yugoslav period and its dissolution, so visiting a variety of these places will provide a more rounded understanding of the region’s complex history.\n\nRead more: I Spent the Night in Ljubljana’s Former Political Prison\n\nWhat is the lasting legacy of Yugoslavia?\n\nThe legacy of Yugoslavia is complex, influencing the political, social, and cultural landscapes of the countries that emerged from its breakup. It encompasses both positive and negative elements:\n\nEthnic Relations: Yugoslavia’s breakup was accompanied by brutal ethnic conflicts, resulting in deep-seated tensions and divisions among the different ethnic groups. The scars from this period of violence and the associated acts of ethnic cleansing and genocide still affect interethnic relations and politics in the region today.\n\nPolitical Transformation: The dissolution of Yugoslavia led to the birth of several new nations, each with its own political system and identity. Some, like Slovenia and Croatia, joined the European Union, while others are still grappling with political issues and reforms.\n\nEconomic Impact: The economic impact of the Yugoslav Wars and the breakup of the country was profound. Although there has been considerable economic growth and development since the wars, challenges remain, including unemployment, corruption and economic inequality.\n\nCultural Influence: Despite the conflicts, there is a shared cultural heritage from the Yugoslav era that persists in the region, including language, music, film, and sports. Some citizens of the former Yugoslav republics look back on the era with a sense of shared history and collective memory, often referred to as ‘Yugo-nostalgia.’\n\nInternational Relations: The international community’s response to the Yugoslav Wars has left a significant legacy, influencing international law, humanitarian intervention policies, and conflict resolution strategies. The wars led to the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which played a crucial role in prosecuting war crimes.\n\nTransitional Justice: The trials held by the ICTY, as well as local war crimes trials and truth-seeking initiatives in the countries of the former Yugoslavia, represent significant steps in addressing the past, achieving justice for victims, and promoting reconciliation.\n\nRead more: The NATO Ruins of Belgrade\n\nDid Yugoslavia have any positives?\n\nIt’s important to remember that the experience of living in Yugoslavia varied widely based on a multitude of factors, including ethnicity, region and socio-economic class, but there were indeed several aspects of life in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that some remember positively:\n\nUnity and Brotherhood: The motto of Yugoslavia was ‘Brotherhood and Unity,’ reflecting an ideal of multi-ethnic coexistence and solidarity among the various nations of the federation. While this unity was strained and ultimately fractured, during much of Yugoslavia’s existence, there were significant periods of relative ethnic harmony.\n\nEconomic Stability and Social Security: Under Tito’s brand of ‘market socialism,’ Yugoslavia had one of the most liberal economic systems among communist countries. Workers had a degree of self-management in their enterprises, and the economy, while not wealthy by Western standards, provided a reasonable standard of living, job security, free healthcare, and free education for many.\n\nNon-Aligned Movement: Under Tito’s leadership, Yugoslavia was one of the founding members and leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War, allowing the country to maintain a degree of independence from both the Western and Eastern Blocs and establish relations with a wide range of countries.\n\nCultural Exchange: As part of its non-alignment policy, Yugoslavia allowed more openness to Western influence compared to other socialist states. This resulted in a cultural mix where Western music, film, and art were more accessible than in other parts of the Eastern Bloc.\n\nTravel Freedom: Yugoslav citizens enjoyed more freedom to travel to Western countries compared to citizens of other communist nations, leading to a broader worldview and cultural exchange.\n\nInfrastructure Development: The Yugoslav period saw considerable investment in infrastructure, including housing, schools, hospitals, and transportation networks.\n\nHowever, it’s crucial to balance these points with the realities of authoritarian governance, limitations on political freedoms, suppression of dissent and significant regional disparities in development.\n\nThe tensions beneath the surface ultimately led to the country’s violent dissolution, a fact that makes any discussion of the ‘positives’ of Yugoslavia, and the emergence of ‘Yugo-stalgia’, a sensitive topic.\n\nRead more: Is Montenegro a Country? Everything You Need to Know.\n\nFAQ on the Former Yugoslavia\n\nHere’s a quick FAQ on the Former Yugoslavia:\n\nQ1: Does Yugoslavia still exist today?\n\nA: No, Yugoslavia does not exist today.
