        "text": "The land for Lee, Muscogee, Troup, Coweta, and Carroll Counties was ceded by the Creek people in the 1825 Treaty of Indian Springs. The county boundaries were created by the Georgia General Assembly on June 9, 1826, but they were not named until December 14, 1826. The County is named for George Troup, thirty-fourth govern or of Georgia, U.S. representative, and senator. The official historian of Troup County is noted author Forest Clark Johnson, III. (Wikipedia). Troup County was created June 9, 1825 and December 11, 1826 with 447 square miles acquired by Creek cessions of January 24, 1826 and March 31, 1826. It was named for George Michael Troup, 1780-1856. He was the governor of Georgia, 1823-1827. He was elected to the U.S. Senate. Later, he was nominated to be president of the United States. The court house burned in November 4, 1936 along with some records."
