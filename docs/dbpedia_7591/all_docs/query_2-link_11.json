        "text": "Just picked up a pro-164 on request of the salesperson. I got it home of course all has changed on the programming. I went back to rs and another guy stated it would not work in my area because it is all digital. I checked my zip 30240 and it states that my area is still analog from what I can see. Being that I know nothing but programming the reg freqs do I need the cable and software to make things alot easier on my end? Inputting trunking in the manual seems to be tricky to me......\n\nThanks in Advance Michael C\n\nMC. True there are frequencies in your area that are analog. Troup county is a trunked system from what I can see and some of it is digital. They may be similcasting some of the traffic on the frequencies thta you are hearing and then gets static. Are you right in La grange, out in the county. It's rolling hills around that area and you may be down at the bottom of one of those and causing your reception to be that way. I drive thru that area when we go to my wife folks in Greenville, Ga. My suggestion is to replace the 164 with a digital capable scanner and get the software and programing cable as well. These things are a bear to program.\n\nHi Dan. Dan lives close to me MC. MC, don't know if they will all go digital. There is not a lot of activity at times in your area. LaGrange, Hogansville, and Greenville are about it and Columbus if you have an outside antenna, Maybe. Make sure the one you buy is one of the ones that are rebandable. Some areas are doing that but I don't think yours will do it soon.\n\nranger821. I have dug around and see that the pro-164 is rebandable. Do you think I need to keep this one or go ahead and get the pro-106? I never would have guessed this would get this complicated.....\n\nMocman. The digital ones are expensive. You probably have over 200 in the 164. RS had them (106) on sale a while back but it's 399 bucks now. If you can use something bigger that the handheld, they have a REFURB 197 for 299. It's base/mobile. That decision is up to you on the 106. As for it getting complicated, it gets worse as you get into this hobby. that is the reason I suggested the software and the cable. Only the strong willed ones can do all the programming of ALL of the types of systems. I can't!!!! Dan helped me a lot!!!!!! Be prepared to read the info here on RR. The Wiki area has a lot of good info. the nice thing about here you can ask questions of the folks that either have the same scanner as you or have a vast knowledge of all of them. I am NO EXPERT believe me. I am still in the novice mode. I have done a lot of research and I read the post here to gleen info from the guys/gals that know more than me.\n\nranger821.. Yea the 164 is a refurb and got it for $105. I guess if this one need replaced I will search for the 106. I know it is going to get complicated in the future. I will get the cable and software today. I guess it would hook up either radio. Thanks for your help as I will need it in the near future also on this hobby.....MC\n\nI will get the cable and software today. I guess it would hook up either radio.\n\nIf you keep the 164, check out the Win97 software for it. The 106 takes a different software. Win500 I think????? Make sure the software you buy will work with the scanner you buy. I believe both have a 30 day free trial that you can use. As I said it gets complicated!!!!!!! Will be going thru your area around the first week in Feb.\n\nYou do know you can listen to troup county in the live audio area here????\n\nMocman:\n\nYou said that some of the services in your area are NOT anolog. Have you tried programming or searching for analog freqs for your area? I have the PRO-164 also. If you want to keep this scanner, you can do either of two things. If you push the \"search\" botton - button to the right of the light button at far lower left of scanner. There are eight search bands, 0-7. Banks 0-6 are preprogrammed banks that are labeled. Search Bank 3 is preprogrammed for \"Public Safety\", 5 bands, 0-4. Hit the search button (SRCH) near lower left of scanner and hit the UP arrow button. You can also use Bank 7, which is made so you can search by freq range. To do this, press the search (SRCH) button until bank 7 (SR7) is displayed. Press the Program (PRG) on the bottom row then press SRCH again. enter the \"low\" freq and hit enter (ENT) then enter the \"high\" freq and ENT, then search. If you do this, try using the freq range of 460-470MHz.\n\nI had a similar problem. I can hear everyone in my area since nearly everyone in my county is either analog or anolog Trunked, so the PRO-164 works for me. I cannot hear Metro Nashville, though. This is not a great big deal to me. I next scanner, if there is one, will be Digital. Hope this helps.\n\ncpsTN. I have punched in my ga troup county area on this site and it states that we are all analog. Then I went to the policescanners site to input my area for the type of scanner needed for my area. That is the reason I purchased the pro-164. ranger821 stated some are digital in my area but I can not verify it by this site. I need someone from Troup County to verify the need for a digital scanner since I have this one already.\n\nranger821. Now it makes sense. I do see the D and the A in the mode area. Just a little pissed because I purchased the wrong scanner after I inputted my area and the RS guy told me it would pick up in my area. On the analog modes how do I input the dec and hex number for that channel. I am going to return this in the meantime and get a digital one. Thanks for all your help......\n\nTrunked Radio Systems - The RadioReference Wiki\n\nThis will give you an idea about what trunking is. I understand a little of it but I am way behind most of the folks here. I can't explain it here because I use software to do mine when it needs it. I am just learning myself about the DEX/Hex and so on. The guy at RS did not lie per say because there are frequencies in your area that it will scan but not the digital ones."
