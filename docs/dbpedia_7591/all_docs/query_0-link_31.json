Additionally, the data discloses a median household income of $50,278 and a median property tax rate of 1.03%.\n\nProperty records in Troup County, GA, are primarily managed by the Clerk of Superior and State Courts. The Clerk has been recording and safeguarding property documents since 1827, including deeds, mortgages, leases, liens, conveyances, and plats. They index these records by party name, legal description, document type, and book and page of a document in physical and digital databases.\n\nMaps and plats have been electronically filed and stored online in the Georgia Superior Court Clerks’ Cooperative Authority since 2017. Moreover, the public can access property records through the Assessor’s Online Records Search or in person at the Clerk’s storeroom in Ridley Ave., LaGrange, GA.\n\nThe fees to obtain property records in Troup County depend on the type, size, format, document delivery method, and the level of assistance required.
