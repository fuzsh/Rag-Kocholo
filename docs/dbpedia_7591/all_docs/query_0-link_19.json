L. POLK & CO.'S Directories in the estimation of the public throughout the country, has been established by rendering the best in Directory service. With an unrivaled organization, and having had the courteous and hearty cooperation of the business and professional men and residents, the publishers feel that the result of their labors will meet with the approval of every user, and that the West Point Directory will fulfill its mission as a source of authentic information pertaining to the community.\n\nFive Major Departments The five major departments are arranged in the following order:-- I. THE BUYERS' GUIDE constitutes the first major department, printed on goldenrod paper, and contains the advertisements of leading manufacturing, business and professional interests of West Point. The advertisements are indexed under headings descriptive of the business represented. This is reference advertising at its best, and merits a survey by all buyers eager to familiarize themselves with sources of supply. In a progressive community like West Point, the necessity of having this kind of information immediately available, is obvious. General appreciation of this fact is evidenced by the many reference users of this City Directory service. II. THE CLASSIFIED BUSINESS DIRECTORY is the second major department, printed on canary paper. This department lists the names of all business and professional concerns in alphabetical order under appropriate headings. This feature constitutes an invaluable and indispensable catalog of the numerous interests of the community. The Directory is the common intermediary between buyer and seller. As such, it plays an important part in the daily activities of the commercial, industrial and professional world. More buyers and sellers meet through the Classified Business Directory than through any other medium.\n\n8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIII. THE ALPHABETICAL LIST OF NAMES of residents and business and professional concerns, is the third major department, printed on white paper. This is the only record in existence that aims to show the name, marital status, occupation and address of each adult resident of West Point, and the name, official personnel, nature and address of each firm and corporation in the city.\n\nIV. THE DIRECTORY OF HOUSEHOLDERS, INCLUDING STREET AND AVENUE GUIDE is the fourth major department, printed on green paper. In this section the numbered streets are arranged in numerical order, followed by the named streets in alphabetical order; the numbers of the residences and business concerns are arranged in numerical order under the name of each street, and the names of the householders and concerns are placed opposite the numbers. The names of the intersecting streets appear at their respective crossing points on each street. Special features of this section are the designation of tenant-owned homes and the listing of telephone numbers.\n\nV. THE NUMERICAL TELEPHONE DIRECTORY is the fifth major department, printed on blue paper.\n\nCommunity Publicity\n\nThe Directory reflects the achievements and ambitions of the community, depicting in unbiased terms what it has to offer as a place of residence, as a business location, as a manufacturing site and as an educational center. To broadcast this information, the publishers have placed copies of this issue of the Directory in Directory Libraries, where they are readily available for free public reference, and serve as perpetual and reliable advertisements of West Point and vicinity. There are more than 1,000 of these Directory Libraries installed and maintained in cities and towns throughout the U. S., Canada and Puerto Rico by members of the Association of North American Directory Publishers, under whose supervision the system is operated and of which R. L. Polk & Co. is a member.\n\nThe publishers appreciatively acknowledge the recognition by those progressive business and professional men who have demonstrated their confidence in the City Directory as an advertising medium, with assurance that it will bring a commensurate return.\n\nR.

It is located at a unique juncture of Troup and Harris Counties, Georgia, and Chambers County, Alabama, where the river becomes the Georgia-Alabama boundary as it flows to the gulf of Mexico.\n\n14\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBenjamin Hawkins, the famous United States Indian Agent, visited the future site of West Point during his travels in the Chattahoochee Valley in 1798. Nearby he found the remains of the ancient and flourishing town of the Muscogee Indians known as Oefuskooche Tallauhassee (Old Town), to which it was recorded that English traders from Charles Town, South Carolina, came about 1685.\n\nA famous trail known as the \"Old Horse Trail\" led from this town westward to the Tallapoosa River. Soon after 1790, the town was abandoned. Settlers were gradually coming into the area, and frontier fighting contributed to the movement of the inhabitants to the Tallapoosa.\n\nHawkins also noted in the journal of his travels the site of Ocfuskenena, or \"Burnt Village,\" about four miles northward of \"Old Town,\" both being on the west side of the river. Ocfuskenena, an ancient river crossing point due to the favorable shoals there, was long known to westward going traders and travelers.\n\nThe Indians of Ocfuskenena, by their continuing war raids on outposts across the river in Georgia, finally provoked the Georgians to retaliation. A surprise attack was made ipy the whites on September 27, 1793, after wading the river at night. The town was destroyed, and charred posts of the lodges and village structures dotted it for many years, so that as its Indian name dimmed in memory it acquired the local name of \"Burnt Village.\"\n\nAfter Troup County, Georgia, was formed in 1826, from Creek Indian lands ceded in 1825 at the Treaty of Indian Spring, Georgia, a trading post for settlers and Indians was established on the east side of the river. The first huts or cabins of the pioneers settling there about 1828, were near the river at about where East 10th Street presently ends at the Chattahoochee.\n\nSeventeen miles from the new county seat of LaGrange, incorporated 1828, the settlement was named Franklin, and incorporated in 1831. The name was changed to West Point by act of the Georgia legislature in 1832, the name probably deriving from the belief that it was the westernmost point in Georgia.\n\nWest Point quickly became an entry point for settlers moving westward into Chambers County, and other lands of East Alabama, opened up to whites on removal of the Indians during the 1830's. As the agricultural and plantation life developed around it, on both sides of the river, it reached some importance as a shipping point for river traffic.\n\nBeginning its construction at Montgomery, Alabama, in 1836, the Montgomery Railroad Company sought to reach West Point and supplement the river traffic by tying together the Chattahoochee River and the Alabama River systems of waterways.\n\nIt was not until 1851, however, that the Montgomery and West Point Railroad reached West Point. In 1854, on its newly completed railroad bridge from the east to the west side, the Atlanta and LaGrange Railroad crossed the river to join the Alabama line in West Point. A difference in gauge, or width between the tracks of the two lines, necessitated the unloading of through freight from the one to the other.\n\nThe railroad line from Atlanta to Montgomery is now known as the Atlanta and West Point Rail Road Company, and Western Railway of Alabama, \"The West Point Route.\"\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nThe Chattahoochee Valley Railway Company, built from West Point to Lanett and Langdale, Alabama, in 1895, now extends from West Point to Bleecker, Alabama, serving the textile plants of West Point Manufacturing Company, located in Alabama adjacent to West Point.\n\nWest Point is located on U. S. Highway 29, and U. S. Interstate Highway 85, now under construction, as well as state highways of Georgia and Alabama.\n\nDue to its railroads, and rich farmlands of the area, West Point was an important shipping and warehousing point for plantation products bought by Confederate States commissary agents for the army. It was called the \"key to the granary of the Tennessee army,\" and as a strategic railroad terminal, its railroad bridge and wagon bridge were closely guarded.\n\nWest Point and the surrounding area suffered the rigors of the War Between the States and lost its ante-bellum prosperity along with much of the South due to the war. One week after General Lee's surrender, unknown here at the time, the \"last battle of the war east of the Mississippi River,\" was fought on Easter Sunday, April 16, 1865, at West Point.\n\nLess than 300 Confederates, consisting of boys, militia, and convalescents of the large Reid Hospital maintained here during 1863-1865, were engaged in the fight. An earthenworks defense, located on the west side of the river, on a decided eminence, and partially in Alabama, was their stronghold as 3,000 Union cavalry troops of Wilson's Raiders beseiged them for eight hours before the Confederates surrendered.\n\nThe fort, the last to fall in the Confederacy, was named for its gallant commander, Brigadier Robert C. Tyler, C.S.A., killed during the battle.\n\nSeveral hundred railroad cars loaded with army supplies, including nineteen engines, were destroyed by the Union forces, who also burned the railroad and wagon bridges spanning the Chattahoochee.\n\nAlthough stricken by the devastating war, the people of West Point and its Alabama area, quickly went to work to rebuild the Chattahoochee Valley. The world famed cotton textile industry of West Point and its adjacent five textile communities on the Alabama side: Lanett, Shawmut, Langdale, Fairfax and River View, was started by a few local cotton planters and merchants in 1866 at Langdale and River View.\n\nWest Point Manufacturing Cbmpany, organized in 1880, observed its 75th anniversary in 1955, and is a giant producer of cotton, rayon and synthetic fabrics for industrial and domestic consumption.\n\nBatson-Cook Company, of West Point, renowned contractors and builders, own and operate the West Point Foundry & Machine Company, a large textile machinery manufacturing plant whose output has had wide acceptance in the textile industry of America and throughout many countries of the world.\n\nVITAL INFORMATION\n\nAT YOUR FINGER-TIPS!\n\nTens of thousands of people who were formerly jij:\n\nstrangers to the City Directory are consulting it til\n\non questions of citizenship, employment, sources\n\nof supply, communication, etc. Also, Directory |:j:\n\nusage is up among regular subscribers.\n\n:j:j\n\n1 MORE PEOPLE ARE SEEING CITY DIRECTORY ADS I\n\nCLASSIFIED\n\nBUYERS' GUIDE OF THE CITY OF\n\nWEST POINT (GEORGIA) 1962\n\nThe Buyers' Guide contains the advertisements and business cards of the more progressive business men and firms in the city, classified according to lines of business\n\nR.
