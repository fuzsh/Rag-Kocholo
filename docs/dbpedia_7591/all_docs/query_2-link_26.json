        "text": "Strings History\n\nIn 2014, Troup County School System and LaGrange Symphony Orchestra began a partnership for a shared vision of access to relevant and high-quality strings education for all students in the Troup County public school system.\n\nThe seeds for this vision were established in the fall of 2015 with the implementation of the LSO's Strings Attached program in four TCSS elementary schools. After five years of success with Strings Attached under the LaGrange Symphony's umbrella, the opportunity for every student in the county came to fruition with the arrival of Superintendent Dr. Brian Shumate in 2019. Dr. Shumate's vision is 'A Place For Every Kid' within TCSS, where every child can become and remain connected so that all will enjoy school, graduate, and find success and purpose. Music instruction is an integral part of that connection for students.\n\nIn the fall of 2020, TCSS took the reins of the Strings Attached program, expanding it to all eleven elementary schools and hiring two full-time orchestra teachers to build programs at all three middle schools. In the 4th year of the program, there are now three full-time middle school orchestra teachers and two full-time high school orchestra teachers providing strings opportunities to students across grades 4th-12th at 17 TCSS schools. The success of the program to date has come from the cumulative teamwork and tremendous support of the Troup County School System, the LaGrange Symphony Orchestra, and the Callaway Foundation."
