        "text": "Students from across the Troup County School System will come together to celebrate their success in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) through SAE International’s award-winning A World In Motion® program Nov. 12-13 at West Georgia Technical College in LaGrange, Ga. Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia, Inc. (KMMG) is sponsoring and hosting the event.\n\nAWIM is a teacher-administered, industry volunteer-assisted program that brings science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education to life in the classroom for students in Kindergarten through Grade 12. Benchmarked to the national standards, the AWIM program incorporates integrated STEM learning experiences through hands-on activities that reinforce classroom STEM learning.\n\n108 Troup County School students will participate in the Motorized Toy Car (MTC) Challenge on Nov. 12; and 144 students will participate in the JetToy Challenge the following day. Students will build, design and test their vehicles during the challenges. KMMG team members will serve as judges for the challenges.\n\n“We are extremely pleased to be working with Kia for this important initiative,” Chris Ciuca, Director of Pre-Professional Programs for SAE International, said. “And, we are thankful for their generous donation – both in terms of time and money – that made it possible.”\n\nIn 2012, KMMG announced a donation totaling $900,000 to the SAE Foundation to “continue impacting science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in Troup County through 2014.”\n\n“Our team members are excited to give back to the community and support this fantastic program that is having a big impact in Troup County Schools,” said Randy Jackson, KMMG’s senior vice president of human resources and administration. “As a learning organization, KMMG focuses on continuous improvement each day in our plant and in our community.\n\nFor information about the challenges at West Georgia Technical College, or to request media credentials, email pr@sae.org or call 1-724-772-8522.\n\nAbout KMMG\n\nKia Motors Manufacturing Georgia, Inc.
