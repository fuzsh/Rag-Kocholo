        "text": "Brian Maddy, County Extension Agent\n\nSkunks Galore\n\nDriving the rural roads this time of year, you are usually greeted with the pungent aroma of a recently deceased mammal known as the Striped Skunk. These nocturnal critters use our roadways to navigate to their food sources which tend to be in peopleâs yards. Their range is usually one-half mile to two square miles. The males may range up to five square miles in search of a girl friend or girlfriends. Right now they may be looking for girlfriends.\n\nThese house-cat sized animals are very distinctively identified, jet black with two white stripes. This coloration gives plenty of warning to any would be predator to back off or face the consequences. Usually, skunks go wherever they please and when they please. They lack no confidence in defending themselves.\n\nThe striped skunk is a solitary creature who usually breeds only once per year and the female raises the young until they are of breeding age. A litter consists of four to six young. They like edges of forests and pastures. They may den together during the winter months for warmth.\n\nThey are highly beneficial to farmers as they feed on large numbers of agricultural and garden pests. Insects are their choice for supper, especially grasshoppers, white grubs, beetles and crickets. In the fall, berries and vegetative matter become a source of food. In the winter, house mice are an important source of protein.\n\nThe striped skunk becomes a problem when your yard becomes a food source and home. Treating your yard with an insecticide for white grubs is a good preventive measure. Keeping the high grass mowed and brush cut also reduces the insect population.\n\nCutting down mouse habitat by removing wood piles from close proximity to the house and controlling the rodent population in and around the house and sheds works as well. Not feeding pets in the garage or storing pet food there will also decrease their incursions.\n\nScreening off any openings in the foundation or under entrance stairs will discourage them from making a den. If they already have a den under the house, wait until dark to screen them off. Skunks are nocturnal. Raising bee hives three feet above the ground on blocks with sheet metal guards prevents honey raids.\n\nSkunks also like eggs for breakfast or a late-night snack. Skunk proofing your chicken yard with fencing at least three feet high. Bury the lowest foot of fencing with the bottom bent at 90Â° angle will stop digging. Install tight fitting lids on garbage cans as well.\n\nHow do you know theyâre around? Sprinkle a light coat of flour where you think theyâre messing around. Skunks have five toes on both front and hind feet with claws usually visible.\n\nThey usually eat eggs from one end with the egg shell crushed inward. They will kill only one or two chickens at a time rather than several like weasels, minks, dogs and raccoons. They do not mutilate their victims like dogs.\n\nTrapping skunks in a properly baited trap works to remove skunks from your property. The problem arises from what do you do with the trapped skunk? Itâs better to hire a professional trapper to remove unwanted skunks from under the house or barn. As with any removal strategy, trapping opens the door to new visitors.\n\nBefore a skunk sprays, it will stamp their forefeet rapidly and arch their tail. Heed these warning signs. I could write an entire article just on how to alleviate the odor. Skunks do carry rabies so never approach a friendly skunk.\n\nSkunks are fairly peaceful animals when left alone and provide the benefit of controlling insects and rodents. Skunks may have been visiting your property for years without you knowing it. If a problem arises, make sure you determine whether a skunk is causing it.\n\nWhatâs going on in Troup County Extension?\n\n* Tree seedlings can be ordered from the Georgia Forestry Commission, 706.845.4122\n\n* February 7th: First Tuesday of the month Lunch-n-Learn Gardening Series at the Library, Noon MGEV Topic: Tropical Vibe Selecting and Growing Palms in Georgia\n\n* February 9th: MGEV meeting 6:30 PM at the Ag Center.

After jump starting the car and adjusting the tire inflation, I was ready to go to work. As shocking the cold temperatures are to us, it is equally shocking to the plants in our landscape.\n\nHow well will our plants survive this cold weather? It really depends on how cold hardy the trees, shrubs and plants that are in your landscape. If you have a variety of native plants or plants purchased from reputable local garden centers and nurseries, you should be safe. If your plants came from warmer climates such as Florida, California or southern Texas, you may be in trouble.\n\nAccording to the American Horticulture Society plant hardiness zone map, Troup County may experience low temperatures that range from 5 to 10Â° F. Trying to keep a palm tree alive on the back deck is a risky proposition in these temperatures. Hardiness is the ability of a plant to adapt to average minimum and maximum temperatures of a region. With the onset of frosts, plants become more hardened. What disrupts this cycle is a period of warm weather preceding extremely cold weather.\n\nIf your plants have been placed in the proper location, their chance of survival increases. If you place shrubs like azaleas and camellias in an understory location protected from the sun and wind they will do well rather than in sunny, exposed locations.\n\nTaking care that the plants have been mulched, watered, fertilized, pruned and sprayed properly during the growing season is very important. Plants have to be in good shape to survive rough, winter conditions.\n\nIt may take a while to see the effects of cold damage. What you may see now is bronzing of the foliage a few days after extreme cold. Some plant leaves may turn purple to a sudden chill and that is perfectly normal. Privet, ligustrum and camellia respond this way.\n\nFrozen, dead foliage turns brown. You can try the scratch test with your thumbnail. When you scratch the bark and it is white or green, the wood is still alive. If brown or brittle, the branch has bit the dust.\n\nWhat can be done right now?Â Roots are very susceptible to cold damage so make sure that all your plants have a three to five-inch layer of mulch. Mulch acts like insulation and protects the roots from rapid temperature fluctuations.\n\nWait to prune until March to shape summer-blooming plants and evergreens. Spring blooming plants such as azaleas, spirea and forsythia should be pruned after flowering.\n\nPruning stimulates new growth which may easily be damaged by cold.\n\nAlso, wait until late March or April to fertilize or until the danger of freezing has passed. Like pruning, fertilizer stimulates growth that can be damaged by cold.\n\nCovering tender plants with blankets or sheets may help to reduce frost and cold damage. You may have to prop them up with sticks or poles. This prevents limb breakage. To protect special plants this may work but it may not be practical for all plants. Plastic is also an option but must be removed during sunny or warm days to prevent heat damage.\n\nTo prevent thin barked trees from cracking during cold weather, the trunks can be wrapped with materials that can be purchased from local garden centers and nurseries.\n\nWhatâs going on in Extension?\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â January 16th: Troup County Association of Beekeepers. 7:00 PM at the Ag Center\n\nÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â January 17th: Troup County Cattlemanâs Association. 7:00 PM meal and at 7:30 PM Clay Williams will speak on controlling weeds in pastures.
