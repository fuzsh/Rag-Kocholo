Do you have the scanner set to P-25 Auto? Makes a difference on how it receives the site/sites.\n\nThe LaGrange/Troup County Trunked System appears to have made some recent changes or updates that are not listed in RR yet.\n\nIt looks like a New Trunked License was approved around Oct. 2023.\n\nSome New Sites appear to have been added.\n\nSome New Frequencies appears to have been added.\n\nUnsure if the current Sites or Freq.s listed in RR are still active or not or if they have been changed over to the New Simulcast System?\n\nTry these Freq.s out under a Simulcast Site and see if they work.\n\nLagrange, GA\n\nCall Sign: WRZD433\n\nhttps://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=4831288\n\n4 New Simulcast Sites:\n\nUnknown Site #?\n\n52 Hightower Rd.\n\nHogansville, GA, Troup County\n\n--\n\n583 Oak Grove Road\n\nPine Mountain, GA, Troup County\n\n--\n\n5605 Roanoke Road\n\nLaGrange, GA, Troup County\n\n--\n\nRobertson Street @ SH109\n\nLaGrange, GA, Troup County\n\nSimulcast Frequencies:\n\n854.0625\n\n854.6625\n\n855.2125\n\n855.8625\n\n856.1125\n\n856.5375\n\n856.6875\n\n857.0625\n\nEmission Designator:\n\n9K80D7W, P25 Phase II, TDMA\n\nI don't think the new system is live, but maybe it is? It was just ordered recently (October?). I do know for a fact that it will be encrypted, so not happy about that at all. If I remember, I'll ask my source about the Troup system tomorrow. I should be seeing them tomorrow evening for an unrelated matter.\n\nOkay, I did get to discuss the Troup system with my source this evening. Here is the scoop. The new system has been ordered and some new towers are supposed to be built as part of the project. Nothing new is on the air, or even close to it. The old system is still valid. This week the Hogansville site lost power, so that may be why you didn't hear traffic. Apparently there is no UPS and no site generator at that site, so if the power is out then it is down, but that should be a rare and brief event. If you are not hearing traffic right now, then something is wrong with your setup. Oh, also in regard to encryption, apparently that is not a done deal so there may be some hope yet. Hopefully the powers that be will elect to not encrypt all public safety traffic."
