        "text": "All Georgia Paraprofessionals must hold a valid state license issued by the Georgia Professional Standards Commission (GaPSC). Georgia educators who hold a valid professional certificate may serve as Paraprofessionals without holding a specific Paraprofessional license.\n\nAn individual must be employed as a Paraprofessional in a Georgia local unit of administration (LUA) in order to qualify for a Paraprofessional license, which is valid for five years. In addition to employment, the applicant must meet one of the following qualifications:\n\nHold an associate’s degree or higher in any subject from a GaPSC-accepted accredited institution;\n\nHave completed 2 years (60 semester hours) of college coursework above the remedial level at a GaPSC-accepted accredited institution with a grade of “C” or better;\n\nHold a minimum of a high school diploma or GED equivalent and have passed the GACE Paraprofessional Assessment.\n\nIf you are interested in obtaining a Paraprofessional license, you must first seek employment with a Georgia school, which will require a criminal record check. Your certification application package will be submitted by your employer. *(official transcript required for verification)"
