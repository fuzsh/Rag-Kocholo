Employers are required by law to withhold income tax for both resident and nonresident employees. Deductions are generally the same as those allowed on the Federal Income Tax. Businesses must file tax returns on real estate and inventory by April 1 of each year. Returns are based on property owned as of January 1. You may call 706.883.1620 for all tax information.

Local sales tax is 7%, including 4% state tax, 1% local option sales tax, and 2% special purpose local sales tax option.

Ad valorem tax, more commonly known as property tax, is calculated on the fair market value of the property which is established January 1st of each year. The tax levied on the assessed value of the property is established by law at 40% of the fair market value. The amount of tax is determined by the tax rate (mill rate) levied. One mill is equal to $1 for each $1000 of assessed value or .001. All Troup County property owners pay .25 mills in state tax, 11.26 county tax and 18.85 school tax for a total of 30.36 mills per $1000 assessed property value.
