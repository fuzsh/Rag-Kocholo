        "text": "As we countdown the days to Alabama's season opener against Middle Tennessee State, which is 98 days away, today is represented by former Alabama defensive end Leroy Cook.\n\nCook, an Abbeville, Ala., native, played wide receiver and fullback in high school. Cook led Abbeville's basketball and football team to a state championship in his senior season.\n\nDuring his four years in Tuscaloosa, Cook racked up 200 tackles, 15 sacks, and ten forced fumbles. Cook took home two All-American and All-SEC honors in the 1974 and 1975 seasons.\n\nCook was considered to be one of the best players in the 1975 draft, but after an incident after Alababama's 28-0 Iron Bowl victory where, while celebrating, Bob Baumhower slapped Cook's left shoulder from the back, snapping Cook's right knee, tearing a ligament.\n\nThe Cowboys took a flier on Cook in the tenth round, but he could never fully recover, getting released in the summer of 1977.\n\nCook returned home to Alabama, working at O'Neal Steel in Birmingham."
