        "text": "Baltimore Ravens\n\nKey acquisitions: RB Derrick Henry, T Josh Jones, LB Chris Board, WR Deonte Harty\n\nRe-signed: DT Justin Madubuike, LB Kyle Van Noy, LB Malik Harrison, WR Nelson Agholor, DE Brent Urban, CB Arthur Maulet\n\nDepartures: LB Patrick Queen (Steelers), RB Gus Edwards (Chargers), S Geno Stone (Bengals), G Kevin Zeitler (Lions), OT Morgan Moses (Jets), RB J.K. Dobbins (Chargers), WR Devin Duvernay (Jaguars), OLB Tyus Bowser, CB Ronald Darby (Jaguars), G John Simpson (Jets), OLB Jadeveon Clowney (Panthers), LB Del’Shawn Phillips (Texans), LS Tyler Ott (Commanders), QB Tyler Huntley (Browns), CB Rock Ya-Sin (49ers)\n\nRemaining free agents: WR Odell Beckham Jr., S Daryl Worley, RB Dalvin Cook\n\nAnalysis: A free agency that featured some big names join the team and get re-signed to big money deals should not overlook the losses this team had. Derrick Henry is the perfect fit for this team and will be a perfect complement to Lamar Jackson, but he is 30 years old and isn’t the same player, but was it the team or the player? We’ll see, but a healthy Henry is exactly what this Ravens offense needed after they’ve dealt with so many injuries. Gus Edwards and J.K. Dobbins are gone so they are really banking on Henry and Keaton Mitchell’s health.\n\nTheir big re-signing was breakout star Justin Madubuike, who signed a four-year $98 million extension after an All-Pro season. They also brought back veteran linebacker Kyle Van Noy, Malik Harrison and Brent Urban. Some big losses are Pro Bowl linebacker Patrick Queen to the rival Steelers, safety Geno Stone to the rival Bengals, as well as veterans Ronald Darby and Jadeveon Clowney to the South divisions.\n\nVeteran right guard Kevin Zeitler is now with the Lions and right tackle Morgan Moses was traded to the Jets. They did sign Josh Jones who has been a fringe starter in his career, but they definitely need offensive line help. They also lost Pro Bowl returner Devin Duvernay but replaced him with Deonte Harty.\n\nConclusion: The Ravens are one of the most well-run franchises in the NFL and are trusted to get this team in tip-top shape. There are definitely some holes, but this team excels in the draft and should be focusing hard on offensive line and wide receiver.\n\nCincinnati Bengals\n\nKey acquisitions: T Trent Brown, RB Zack Moss, DT Sheldon Rankins, S Geno Stone, S Vonn Bell\n\nRe-signed: WR Tee Higgins (franchise), TE Drew Sample, G Cody Ford, LB Akeem Davis-Gaither, RB Trayveon Williams, TE Tanner Hudson\n\nDepartures: RB Joe Mixon (Texans), T Jonah Williams (Cardinals), CB Chidobe Awuzie (Titans), NT D.J. Reader (Lions), S Nick Scott (Panthers), TE Irv Smith Jr. (Chiefs)\n\nRemaining free agents: WR Tyler Boyd, NT Josh Tupou, LB Markus Bailey\n\nAnalysis: The Bengals had a decent offseason with a good amount of turnover. The traded away Joe Mixon after he was reportedly getting cut after seven great seasons, but replaced him with Zack Moss. The former Bill and Colt has mainly been a backup in his career who has been good when starting, but some may not view him as an every-down back, but he should be a nice complement to Chase Brown.\n\nTrent Brown joins the team as their right tackle replacing Jonah Williams their former first-round pick, and Sheldon Rankins comes on to replace D.J. Reader in the middle of the defensive line. They added some pieces in the secondary with former Raven Geno Stone, who will get a legit chance to be an every-snap player, and they brought back old friend Vonn Bell. They’ll compete with youngsters Dax Hill and Jordan Battle. They also lost Chido Awuzie at corner and cut Nick Scott.\n\nTee Higgins is currently on the franchise tag and has been very vocal about wanting to be traded or signed, and it looks like neither will happen.\n\nConclusion: The Bengals had a lost 2023 season with Joe Burrow out, so they’ll be looking to rebound in 2024. Their biggest need is probably wide receiver as Higgins’ future is uncertain and Tyler Boyd remains unsigned.\n\nCleveland Browns\n\nKey acquisitions: WR Jerry Jeudy, LB Jordan Hicks, QB Jameis Winston, RB Nyheim Hines, DT Quinton Jefferson, QB Tyler Huntley, RB D’Onta Foreman, CB Justin Hardee, T Germain Ifedi, LB Devin Bush\n\nRe-signed: DE Za’Darius Smith, DT Maurice Hurst, DT Shelby Harris, S Rodney McLeod, P Corey Bojorquez, G Michael Dunn\n\nDepartures: LB Anthony Walker (Dolphins), LB Sione Takitaki (Patriots), DT Jordan Elliott (49ers), QB Joe Flacco (Colts), TE Harrison Bryant (Raiders), C Nick Harris (Seahawks), T Leroy Watson (Titans), LB Jacob Phillips (Texans)\n\nRemaining free agents: RB Kareem Hunt, T Geron Christian, WR Marquise Goodwin, S Duron Harmon\n\nAnalysis: A pretty exciting free agency for the Browns. Coming off a year led by Joe Flacco with Deshaun Watson once again out of commission, the Browns looked to add to the offense by acquiring Jerry Jeudy from the Broncos and signing him to an extension, a move that’s seemingly been in the works forever. They lost backup tight end Harrison Bryant to the Raiders, but other than that the Browns kept their offense intact. They did however replace Flacco with Jameis Winston, so there’s some excitement there. They also added Nyheim Hines and D’Onta Foreman to give them RB insurance with Nick Chubb coming off a major injury.\n\nThe defense replaced it’s starters with new starters. Anthony Walker and Sione Takitaki are replaced by Jordan Hicks and Devin Bush. Hicks has been a very good middle linebacker in his career and should fit in nicely. Bush had a solid couple first seasons with the Steelers but fell off quick and played solely on special teams with the Seahawks last year.\n\nQuinton Jefferson replaces Jordan Elliott on a defensive line that also brought back Za’Darius Smith, Maurice Hurst, and Shelby Harris. They also brought back veteran safety Rodney McLeod and signed special teamer Justin Hardee.\n\nConclusion: A solid free agency leaves the Browns in good shape for the 2024 season. They are still dealing with the Deshaun Watson trade in regards to draft picks so they are without a first-rounder, but can do some damage in the second round and beyond.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\n\nKey acquisitions: QB Russell Wilson, QB Justin Fields, LB Patrick Queen, CB Donte Jackson, RB Cordarrelle Patterson, P Cameron Johnston, WR Van Jefferson, WR Quez Watkins, QB Kyle Allen, DE Dean Lowry, TE MyCole Pruitt\n\nRe-signed: DT Montravius Adams, S Miles Killebrew\n\nDepartures: QB Kenny Pickett (Eagles), WR Diontae Johnson (Panthers), C Mason Cole, CB Patrick Peterson, WR Allen Robinson, T Chukwuma Okorafor (Patriots), QB Mason Rudolph (Titans), QB Mitchell Trubisky (Bills), P Pressley Harvin, DE Armon Watts (Patriots), S Keanu Neal, CB James Pierre (Commanders), CB Levi Wallace (Broncos)\n\nRemaining free agents: CB Chandon Sullivan, LB Kwon Alexander, DE Markus Golden, LB Mykal Walker, S Elijah Riley\n\nAnalysis: The Pittsburgh Steelers, known for draft and development, were the most active I’ve ever seen. They signed Russell Wilson for pennies and traded away once-thought-of next franchise QB Kenny Pickett to the Eagles after they traded for once-thought-of next franchise QB of the Bears in Justin Fields. It’s gonna be a wild ride following this team in 2024 and I’m all here for it.\n\nThey brought in former division rival Patrick Queen to lead the middle of that defense and traded for former Panthers starting CB Donte Jackson, but gave up on WR1 Diontae Johnson in the deal and cut Allen Robinson, leaving George Pickens as their only real pass catcher, alongside FA signees Van Jefferson and Quez Watkins."
