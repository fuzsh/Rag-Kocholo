        "text": "The Seahawks have been talking about Calais Campbell for a few years.\n\nFor example, when they drafted Malik McDowell in 2017, John Schneider was asked about the pick: “We’ve been looking for a pass rushing three-technique since we’ve been here.”\n\nWhen asked what McDowell looked like at his best, Schneider answered: “Similar to what Calais Campbell looked like.”\n\nPete Carroll later returned to the comparison during that press conference, going as far as to call it a ‘great comparison’.\n\nThat was the off-season that Campbell left Arizona for Jacksonville in free agency. There was a feeling that maybe the Seahawks — with somewhat limited cap space — might be able to convince him to come to Seattle. The Jaguars gave him a four-year, $60m contract worth $15m a season. At the time, that was an incredible deal the Seahawks couldn’t compete with.\n\nIt’s possible that they set their heart on Campbell that off-season and the decision to go for McDowell was something of a ‘Plan B’.\n\nA year ago Campbell’s name cropped up again. When asked after drafting L.J. Collier why they were seemingly so determined to add a player who can rush inside and out (with McDowell, Collier and Rasheem Green mentioned), Schneider responded: “It’s a hard spot to find. The Calais Campbell’s of this world are hard to find.”\n\nThese quotes alone are not enough to assert a love-in between Seattle’s front office and Calais Campbell. Clearly, however, they’ve not only been looking for a player like him — they also have a massive amount of admiration for him.\n\nSo with the Seahawks facing an enormous off-season where the quarterback is already calling publicly for ‘superstars’ to be signed — could Campbell be a trade target?\n\nAnd what would it take to get him?\n\nHe’s had an incredible three years with the Jaguars with 31.5 sacks, 44 TFL’s and 76 QB hits. He anchors the run defense and he creates consistent pressure. He sets a tone physically but has always been a great leader too.\n\nAccording to PFF, he was the #4 graded defensive lineman in the league in 2019 behind only T.J. Watt, Aaron Donald and Cameron Heyward.\n\nFor these reasons, there’s every chance the Jaguars wouldn’t have any interest in dealing him. He’s producing results even if the team has struggled the last two years. His $15m salary isn’t obscene even if it’s pricey.\n\nThe Jaguars are also, however, facing a bit of a crossroads. They reached the AFC Championship game in 2017 and entered the 2018 season as one of the favourites to reach the Super Bowl. They had a fantastic defense rich in talent.\n\nThen it all went wrong.\n\nNow they’ve traded Dante Fowler and Jalen Ramsey — two former top-10 picks. Yannick Ngakoue is constantly tweeting his desire to leave and he’s set to be a free agent. Telvin Smith surprisingly retired. Tom Coughlin has been fired yet the GM and Head Coach remain.\n\nThey’ve experienced a shocking and sudden collapse. A roster overhaul of sorts is required. Who are they building around for the long term? They added big-signing free agents to supplement their young talent that’s since moved on. Now they’re carrying bloated contracts and they’re projected at $-40,246 in cap space for 2020.\n\nThey have a really meaty and overpaid middle-class that will be decimated by cuts. They’ll instantly create $20m in cap space by cutting Marcell Dareus. Cutting A.J. Bouye saves another $11m. Marqise Lee could save them $5m, Brandon Linder $8m, D.J. Hayden $6m, Abry Jones $4m and Geoff Swaim $3.75m.\n\nSo while they’re currently forty-grand in the red for 2020, they’ll soon have a fair bit of money to play with depending on who they want to sacrifice.\n\nIt also means they’re not under any immediate pressure to trade or cut Calais Campbell. Yet parting with him would save $15m too.\n\nHere’s why they might consider it.\n\nClearly the Jaguars are going through another transition period. They’ll be looking to build around, presumably, the likes of Josh Allen and Gardner Minshew. They’re not a team that has a look of being one solid off-season away from being right back in contention.\n\nCampbell is only contracted for one more year and he’s 34-years-old in September. If they could get a reasonably high pick for him, that might be better value than carrying him for another year given their current status.\n\nOf course, they could just extend his contract. That would potentially lower his 2020 cap hit and keep him in Florida for the rest of his career.\n\nYet if a team dangled a high draft pick — that would surely be tempting. The Jaguars need to get younger, sort their cap out and ‘go again’.\n\nWhy would it make sense for the Seahawks?\n\nFirstly, there is some precedent here. One of the best trades in the Carroll/Schneider era was to go and get Duane Brown. It wasn’t a cheap trade — costing the Seahawks a second and third round pick. Yet the deal instantly put a stop to the glaring issue at left tackle. Brown has played at a high level since and has offered vital leadership and toughness to the offense.\n\nBrown was 32 when he arrived in Seattle. That didn’t put them off trading two high picks for him and then giving him a new long-term extension.\n\nCampbell is currently 33 — although as mentioned he will be 34 on September 1st. The Seahawks desperately need to address their defensive line this time. Campbell would instantly provide a boost to the pass rush and the run defense. He would also deliver the same toughness and leadership that Brown provided.\n\nSeattle’s D-line struggled far too often in 2019 to win the line of scrimmage battle. Imagine the difference Campbell would make? Not only that — the benefit would be felt elsewhere. Imagine trying to stop a Clowney & Campbell combo? Imagine the impact on Bobby Wagner, being able to play behind such a dominant force up front.\n\nLike Brown, there’s no indication Campbell intends to retire in the near future. In fact when asked at the Pro Bowl about his contract, he discussed his willingness to restructure his deal in the form of an extension.\n\nIf he was willing to play for three more seasons, perhaps, would a significant trade be worth considering?\n\nPerhaps the best question is this — is there anyone else out there who could do more for Seattle’s defense than Campbell? The answer is probably no — short of pulling off a somewhat unrealistic trade for one of the top pass rusher’s in the game Khalil Mack-style.\n\nWith the Seahawks owning two second round picks this year, they’re in a strong position. Could they repeat the Brown trade by offering Jacksonville #64 this year and a 2021 third rounder?\n\nThey’d still have #27. They’d still have #59.\n\nThe Jaguars would get two high picks and some cap relief as they prepare to move forward. They’d be taking a hit losing Campbell for sure — but they might be willing to consider long term planning.\n\nThe Seahawks need stars right now. They’d take on a non-restrictive $15m cap hit for Campbell with the option to extend his deal and lower that number.\n\nThere’s nothing to say Jacksonville would want to do this. It’s difficult to project trades. After all — who would’ve thought the Seahawks could’ve landed Jadeveon Clowney for a third rounder plus Barkevious Mingo and Jacob Martin? Or Quandre Diggs for a fifth rounder?\n\nWe’ve said a few times now — it feels like the trade market will be crucial for Seattle. Free agency is very expensive. Acquiring players on existing contracts is a way to get better value for money. Whether it’s Campbell, Stefon Diggs, Everson Griffen, Ryan Kerrigan or someone completely different — it would be surprising if there isn’t some kind of trade at some stage.\n\nI think this proposal at least makes some sense for both teams. And while you never ideally want to give up high picks for 34-year-old players — Campbell is a bit different. He’s like Duane Brown.\n\nThey’ve admired him for years. Maybe it’s time to finally bring him to Seattle?\n\nYou can now support Seahawks Draft Blog via Patreon by clicking the tab below."
