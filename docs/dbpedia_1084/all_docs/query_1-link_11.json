        "text": "John Allen Hannah (born April 4, 1951), nicknamed Hog, is a former American football left guard who played for the New England Patriots (1973–1985) in the National Football League (NFL). In 1999 the Sporting News ranked him as the second greatest offensive lineman in NFL history after Anthony Muñoz. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1991, and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999. Sports Illustrated dubbed him, on its August 3, 1981, cover, \"The Best Offensive Lineman of All Time.\" That same year, he was the inaugural inductee in the New England Patriots Hall of Fame.\n\nBruce Rankin Matthews (born August 8, 1961) is a former American football offensive lineman who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 19 seasons, from 1983 to 2001. He spent his entire career playing for the Houston / Tennessee Oilers / Titans franchise. Highly versatile, throughout his NFL career he played every position on the offensive line, starting in 99 games as a left guard, 87 as a center, 67 as a right guard, 22 as a right tackle, 17 as a left tackle, and was the snapper on field goals, PATs, and punts. Having never missed a game due to injury, his 293 NFL games started is the second most of all time. Matthews played college football for the University of Southern California, where he was recognized as a consensus All-American for the USC Trojans football team as a senior. He was selected in the first round of the 1983 NFL Draft by the Oilers. He was a 14-time Pro Bowl selection, tied for the most in NFL history, and a nine-time first-team All-Pro. Matthews was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2007, and his number 74 jersey is retired by the Titans; he is the only member of the team to have his number retired having played for the Titans. After retiring as a player, Matthews served as an assistant coach for the Houston Texans and Titans. A member of the Matthews family of football players, he is the brother of linebacker Clay Matthews Jr.; father of center Kevin Matthews and tackle Jake Matthews; and uncle of linebacker Clay Matthews III and linebacker Casey Matthews."
