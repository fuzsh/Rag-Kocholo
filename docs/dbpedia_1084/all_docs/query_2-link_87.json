        "text": "LINCOLN, Neb. — The preseason roster at Nebraska remains fluid.\n\nOne week into training camp, the Huskers have lost two players to season-ending knee injuries. Freshman linebacker Roger Gradney was injured on Saturday, and junior offensive tackle Teddy Prochazka went down on Monday.\n\n“Our heart breaks for both of them,” coach Matt Rhule said.\n\nFor Prochazka, who was in the mix to start at left tackle, it’s a third season-ending injury in four seasons. He attended a team meeting hours after receiving the difficult diagnosis.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nNebraska's Prochazka suffers season-ending injury\n\nPrograms are allowed to keep 120 players on the roster during these four weeks before the fall semester begins on Aug. 26. The Huskers started camp with several contributors missing from the list because of injury, including wide receiver Demitrius Bell (out for the season), cornerback Blye Hill, kicker Tristan Alvano, fullback Barret Liebentritt, defensive lineman Brodie Tagaloa and linebacker Michael Booker III.\n\nInjured players are replaceable on the 120. A year from now, all of this might look much different. Plans to implement a roster maximum of 105 players are underway as part of the settlement terms in the NCAA antitrust case.\n\nBut for now, it’s business as usual.\n\nNebraska does not disclose its preseason roster. But through observations at an open practice last week and interviews in camp, here’s an unofficial rundown:\n\nQuarterback (5)\n\nJalyn Gramstad, senior, 6-foot-0, 200 pounds: National player of the year in NAIA last year and 2022 national champion adds depth and essential experience.\n\nHeinrich Haarberg, junior, 6-5, 225: Eight-game starter in 2023 worked over the offseason on throwing mechanics to complement his physicality.\n\nDaniel Kaelin, freshman, 6-3, 220: High-ceiling early enrollee has added 10 pounds and would benefit from time to develop.\n\nBode Soukup, freshman, 6-2, 195: Walk-on threw for more than 3,000 yards and 30 TDs in final two years at Blair (Neb.) High.\n\nDylan Raiola, freshman, 6-3, 230: Five-star signee is the presumptive starter after months of sharpening leadership and refining arm talent.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nA look into Dylan Raiola's offseason prep from the coaches and teammates who joined him\n\nSynopsis: The Huskers added Gramstad, who wants to coach, as a piece this summer to complete the group. Raiola has ascended quickly, an inevitability, considering his elite skills. What is Haarberg’s role? He’s improved as a passer but perhaps too athletic to serve only as a backup.\n\nRunning back (7)\n\nRahmir Johnson, senior, 5-10, 200: Poised for a strong final season after recovering from a shoulder injury.\n\nMaurice Mazzccua, senior, 5-8, 200: Improved under the radar last year in practice and surfaced in the spring as a solid third-down option.\n\nGabe Ervin, junior, 6-1, 220: Back from hip injury last year and prepared to again compete for the top job.\n\nDante Dowdell, sophomore, 6-2, 225: Former four-star Oregon signee led all rushers in spring game.\n\nEmmett Johnson, sophomore, 5-11, 200: Well-rounded back is a solid candidate to pick up where he left off after starting six of the final seven games in 2023.\n\nKwinten Ives, redshirt freshman, 6-2, 210: Strong runner has added 25 pounds since last season in a bid to provide change of pace.\n\nMekhi Nelson, freshman, 5-10, 185: Reclassified as summer enrollee after one season in prep school following a successful Pennsylvania high school career.\n\nSynopsis: Running backs coach EJ Barthel is tasked to piece together a puzzle. Ervin, Emmett Johnson and Rahmir Johnson remain first in line to handle the largest load. But the race is congested enough that any of these seven could emerge as a key piece.\n\nTight end (7)\n\nNate Boerkircher, junior, 6-5, 250: Started 11 games over the past two seasons and brings valuable experience.\n\nThomas Fidone II, junior, 6-6, 255: His sheer talent, added bulk and good health place the former top recruit in line for a big season.\n\nLuke Lindenmeyer, sophomore, 6-3, 250: Started five games last year and showed high-level blocking ability.\n\nCayden Echternach, redshirt freshman, 6-4, 250: Depth piece out of Bellevue West shows promise as a receiver and blocker.\n\nIan Flynt, freshman, 6-4, 255: Early enrollee with a track pedigree caught a 29-yard pass from Raiola in the spring game.\n\nEric Ingwerson, freshman, 6-6, 250: Equally as talented at Papillion-LaVista on D-line as at tight end.\n\nConnor Schutt, freshman 6-6, 215: High school QB at Wahoo Neumann made the roster cut as first-year walk-on.\n\nSynopsis: Fidone appears ready to emerge as an elite Big Ten player and forms a strong top pairing with Boerkircher. The younger core lacks game-breaking ability after Carter Nelson’s shfit to receiver.\n\nWide receiver (16)\n\nJahmal Banks, senior, 6-4, 220: Wake Forest transfer emerged as a team leader and likely WR1 in his first season at Nebraska.\n\nIsaiah Garcia-Castaneda, senior, 6-1, 200: Back from knee surgery to add experience and return threat.\n\nIsaiah Neyor, senior, 6-4, 220: Texas transfer shows elite athleticism and ability to run after catch.\n\nElliott Brown, junior, 5-11, 185: Returning from knee injury suffered late last season to add invaluable leadership.\n\nAlex Bullock, junior, 6-2, 205: Started eight games last year and caught 15 passes in first major playing time.\n\nJaniran Bonner, sophomore, 6-2, 220: Excellent size and versatility allowed him to play fullback before switching back to receiver and a slot role.\n\nMalachi Coleman, sophomore, 6-5, 210: Missed spring for shoulder rehab and comes back with added weight after starting six games last season.\n\nJaylen Lloyd, sophomore, 5-10, 180: Key weapon with elite speed displayed major offseason improvement after breakout first year.\n\nRoman Mangini, sophomore, 5-10, 170: Adds depth and figures to factor on special teams.\n\nHayes Miller, sophomore, 6-0, 180: Speedy juco product caught Huskers’ attention at June camp.\n\nJacory Barney, freshman, 6-0, 170: Former prep QB out of Miami shined bright in spring and factors immediately in rotation.\n\nQuinn Clark, freshman, 6-5, 205: Son of ex-Nebraska running back Ken Clark brings outstanding size.\n\nDae’vonn Hall, freshman, 6-2, 190: Part of Bellevue West trio that was the first from the same high school to sign with Huskers since 1987.\n\nIsaiah McMorris, freshman, 5-10, 170: Hall’s prep teammate caught a state-record 90 passes as a junior.\n\nCarter Nelson, freshman 6-5, 230: Huge talent out of the 8-man high school game slides from tight end to maximize his early impact.\n\nKeelan Smith, freshman, 6-3, 210: Large-class offensive player of the year in Missouri and son of Nebraska legend Neil Smith looks the part.\n\nSynopsis: From top to bottom, this is the most improved position group on the roster. It will surprise anyone who’s not paying attention. Banks, Neyor, Bonner, Coleman, Lloyd and Nelson form a possible two-deep that doesn’t include several proven pass catchers.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nTakeaways from Nebraska's live practice at Memorial Stadium: QB battle winding down\n\nOffensive linemen (20)\n\nBryce Benhart, senior, 6-9, 315: Back for a sixth season after school-record-tying 41 starts at right tackle.\n\nTurner Corcoran, senior, 6-6, 310: The leader to start at left tackle as Raiola’s protector after a knee injury snapped his streak of 30 consecutive starts.\n\nMicah Mazzccua, senior, 6-5, 325: Transfer via Florida and Baylor with starting experience shows strength and power in push to start at guard.\n\nBen Scott, senior, 6-5, 310: Honorable-mention All-Big Ten pick at center last year has 39 Power 5 starts at Nebraska and Arizona State.\n\nHenry Lutovsky, junior, 6-6, 320: Four-game starter could run with the top group at guard and add tackle depth.\n\nJoey Mancino, junior, 6-1, 305: Walk-on earned one start at left guard last year.\n\nJustin Evans, sophomore, 6-1, 315: Five-game starter last year with versatility to play guard and center.\n\nJacob Hood, sophomore, 6-8, 350: Transfer tackle from Georgia has progressed in bid to get healthy after sitting in his first year at Nebraska.\n\nTyler Knaak, sophomore, 6-6, 325: Utah transfer developed into top reserve after redshirt, with skills to play guard and tackle.\n\nGunnar Gottula, redshirt freshman, 6-5, 305: Backup tackle preserved redshirt while appearing in four games last year.\n\nBrock Knutson, redshirt freshman, 6-7, 305: Developmental tackle did not play in his first season.\n\nJason Maciejczak, redshirt freshman, 6-2, 305: Moved from D-line and excited coaches with athleticism as a guard prospect.\n\nGrant Seagren, redshirt freshman, 6-6, 305: Walk-on has added 45 pounds from listed weight in his first months on campus.\n\nSam Sledge, redshirt freshman, 6-4, 295: Worked into spot on two-deep at left guard while redshirting.\n\nGrant Brix, freshman, 6-6, 310: Early enrolling top-100 prospect picked Huskers over Oklahoma and added 25 pounds in the offseason.\n\nLanden Davidson, freshman, 6-4, 310: June commit last year out of Colorado’s backyard.\n\nJake Peters, freshman, 6-3, 285: Three-sport standout from Iowa committed a year ago during June camp flurry.\n\nGibson Pyle, freshman, 6-5, 295: Early enrollee enjoyed a strong offseason after playing in the All-American Bowl.\n\nXander Ruggeroli, freshman, 6-6, 285: Late bloomer out of Las Vegas was last to join O-line class.\n\nPreston Taumua, freshman, 6-4, 325: Top-rated prospect out of Hawaii who played in the Polynesian Bowl.\n\nSynopsis: Prochazka’s camp injury casts a shadow over the O-line group. Nebraska lacks tackle depth and will need a young player or two to grow up fast. Still, experience abounds. Scott, Benhart and Mazzccua are NFL prospects.\n\nDefensive linemen (17)\n\nNash Hutmacher, senior, 6-4, 310: A grown man as the anchor up front after changing his body in the wake of a 4.5-sack season a year ago.\n\nTy Robinson, senior, 6-6, 310: Leader returns for sixth year on the interior with 33 starts over four seasons.\n\nJimari Butler, junior, 6-5, 260: Added 15 pounds after starting six games last year and led Blackshirts with 8.5 TFLs and 5.5 sacks.\n\nElijah Jeudy, junior, 6-3, 285: Texas A&M transfer appeared in 11 games in his first year with Huskers.\n\nAJ Rollins, junior, 6-5, 255: Moved from tight end last spring and worked to get seasoning in four games.\n\nCameron Lenhardt, sophomore, 6-3, 260: Standout true freshman recorded five TFLs and three sacks and has added size.\n\nDylan Parrott, sophomore, 6-5, 315: Walk-on with a big frame moved from the offensive line.\n\nRiley Van Poppel, sophomore, 6-5, 290: Promising tackle made a major impact as a true freshman, then gained 20 pounds.\n\nKai Wallin, sophomore, 6-5, 250: Junior college transfer played in four games and redshirted.\n\nJames Williams, sophomore, 6-6, 250: Fits in defensive plans after rising from scout team to pass-rushing specialist as a redshirt.\n\nVincent Jackson, redshirt freshman, 6-5, 290: Another lineman who got bigger after a redshirt season out of Pennsylvania.\n\nKeona Davis, freshman, 6-5, 255: Washington signee flipped to Huskers last winter and showed up looking like a specimen.\n\nMason Goldman, redshirt freshman, 6-5, 260: Found a home on the D-line while battling back from injuries.\n\nSua Lefotu, redshirt freshman, 6-3, 295: Californian impressed teammates in spring as older tackles received limited reps.\n\nDavid Hoffken, freshman, 6-7, 255: Huskers discovered the 22-year-old German with great mobility at Texas camp in June.\n\nAshton Murphy, freshman, 6-5, 265: Standout at Elkhorn South on both lines of scrimmage has added 40 pounds in the past year.\n\nJordan Ochoa, freshman, 6-4, 250: Late add to 2024 class can shift from D-line spot to jack linebacker.\n\nSynopsis: The return of top contributors and growth of pass rushers Butler, Lenhardt and Williams has turned this group into a top-10 unit nationally.

If the kickers underperform, problems loom.\n\n(Top photo: Isaac Gifford: Dylan Widger / USA Today)"
