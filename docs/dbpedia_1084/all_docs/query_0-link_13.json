        "text": "The Baltimore Ravens have undergone some significant changes this offseason, notably the loss of Defensive Coordinator Mike Macdonald. Under Macdonald, the Ravens' defense was a top-three unit in terms of EPA per play, excelling with a \"positionless\" defense that confused opposing quarterbacks. Despite a low blitz rate, they led the league in sacks. Stepping in as the new defensive coordinator is Zach Orr, a first-time play caller who has been with the organization since 2014, first as a player and then as a defensive coach. On the offensive line, the Ravens face challenges after losing guards Kevin Zeitler and John Simpson, as well as right tackle Morgan Moses. The team has opted not to bring in free agents, choosing instead to promote from within. Ken discusses what the offensive line might look like, including the potential impact of second-round pick Roger Rosengarten. The Ravens' offense, led by Offensive Coordinator Todd Monken, seems confident in its pass-catching options despite losing Odell Beckham Jr. and making few offseason additions. One notable addition is Tez Walker, a fourth-round draft pick. Ken explores whether the Ravens might use more 12 personnel in 2024, given their depth at tight end with Mark Andrews and Isaiah Likely, who impressed during Andrews' injury last season.\n\nOn this episode of Conduct Detrimental: THE Sports Law Podcast, Dan Lust (⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠@SportsLawLust)⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠and Mike Kravchenko (⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Find him on YouTube⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠) are joined by Bobby Hartwick (@BobbyHartwick) to bring you the latest updates in sports law as we find ourselves with yet another a jam-packed week across the board. The trio dives into the NBA-TNT matching rights drama. Warner Bros., the parent company of TNT, recently exercised its matching rights on one of the deals proposed for the NBA's broadcasting rights. This move has sparked a debate about whether TNT can truly match the streaming services like Amazon Prime. Dan explains the potential legal and contractual hurdles, including the possibility of arbitration, and the implications for the NBA's broadcasting landscape. Next, they cover the new lawsuit filed by the Olympic and Paralympic Committee against PRIME, the energy drink owned by Logan Paul and KSI. The lawsuit claims PRIME infringed on the committee's trademarks by using phrases and symbols associated with the Olympics, such as \"three-time Olympic gold medalist\" and \"repping Team USA.\" The trio discusses the legal intricacies of trademark enforcement and the potential repercussions for Prime. Odell Beckham Jr.'s recent legal battle with Nike also gets attention. Despite Beckham's celebratory social media post claiming victory, Nike's statement asserts that all of Beckham's claims were decided against him without any monetary award. This confusing narrative underscores the importance of clear legal communications and the broader implications for athlete endorsement deals. The conversation then shifts to a humorous yet important trademark dispute between Lamar Jackson and Troy Aikman over the word \"eight.\" Jackson blocked Aikman's attempt to trademark \"eight,\" claiming potential consumer confusion with his own trademarks like \"Era 8\" and \"You 8 Yet.\" The group discusses the complexities of trademark law in sports and the likelihood of a coexistence agreement. Bobby shares his insights into the Johnson vs. NCAA case as Trey Johnson, a former Villanova football player, along with other student-athletes, filed a class action lawsuit against the NCAA and several universities, arguing they should be classified as employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that student-athletes could potentially qualify as employees, which could have major financial and compliance implications for colleges. The case was remanded to the district court to apply the new economic realities test, setting a precedent for evaluating student-athletes' employment status. Mike shares his excitement for Netflix's upcoming \"Untold\" documentary series, which includes episodes on the Michigan sign-stealing scandal and other intriguing sports stories. Bobby recommends watching the Giants' \"Hard Knocks\" series for its in-depth look at front office operations and player evaluations, wrapping up a packed episode of sports law updates and insights.

Lincoln in Skokie), bringing “femme fatale-fronted roadhouse raunch” to the Mazda 3. Frank, River, Mike and AC all crammed in the car for an acoustic performance of “Your Love's a Crime” (off the just-released EP, Romeo Bravo Bravo Tango). See wht.rbbt.obj at Schubas on July 12! Just as our interview was winding down, Village Inn owner Desi Mulingbayan jumped in the car (bringing the total amount of people in the Mazda to six) with a couple of fantastic pizzas.

He's happy now.The middle linebacker who roamed NFL defenses from 2014- ‘19 is living in Atlanta. He's engaged. He has two dogs. He still works out all of the time at his home gym. Brown is also a man who can finally take a deep breath and reflect on the high drama that is professional football. As always, Go Long subscribers are welcomed to join these Happy Hour podcasts and ask players anything you'd like.This episode, Brown dished on a wide, wide array of topics…* Schwartz to Rex to McDermott. The defense was always changing during Brown's time with the Buffalo Bills. He has stories to share on all the above. The NFL could feel like WWE with Rex Ryan.* Did Mario Williams really quit on the 2015 Bills team? What made those ‘15 and ‘16 defenses so chaotic under Rex? Everything has to be perfect in this scheme. * Hell no, Donnie Henderson, he will not get you Krispy Kreme donuts in Canada. * To this day, Preston Brown wants to slap Odell Beckham. Seriously. He explains. * Off to the Bengals, he completely lost his zest for the sport and became a person he could not recognize. An extremely angry, agitated person. * You want to stay on Vontaze Burfict's good side. * Petermania. Believe it or not, Brown agreed with the team's decision to start rookie Nathan Peterman over Tyrod Taylor. Next, came an all-time disaster. * “$500 per pound.” Brown takes listeners through the manic race to shed weight ahead of a Friday weigh-in.
