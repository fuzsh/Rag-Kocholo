SONIA SOTOMAYOR, TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES ---------- MONDAY, JULY 13, 2009 United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, D.C. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 09:58 a.m., in room SH-216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Leahy, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, Durbin, Cardin, Whitehouse, Klobuchar, Kaufman, Specter, Franken, Sessions, Hatch, Grassley, Kyl, Graham, Cornyn, and Coburn. Chairman Leahy. I will give everybody a chance to get in place here. What we are going to do, we are going to have opening statements from members--and, of course, this is, as we all know, the confirmation hearing on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be a Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Judge Sotomayor., welcome to the Senate Judiciary Committee. You have been before us twice before when President George H.W. Bush nominated you to be district judge and then, of course, when President Clinton nominated you as a court of appeals judge. Before we begin the opening statements of the Senators, I know you have family members here, and I do not know if your microphone is on or not, but would you please introduce the members of your family? Judge Sotomayor. If I introduced everybody that's family- like, we'd be here all morning, so I'm---- Chairman Leahy. Okay. I will tell you what. You know what I am going to do? Judge Sotomayor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. Because someday this will be in the archives, this transcript. Introduce whomever you like, and then we will hold the transcript open for you to add any other names you want. [Laughter.] Judge Sotomayor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will limit myself to just my immediate family. Sitting behind me is my brother, Juan Sotomayor. Next to him is my mom, Celina Sotomayor. Next to her is my favorite husband of my mom, Omar Lopez. Next to him is my niece, Kylie Sotomayor. And next to her is her mom and my sister-in-law, Tracy Sotomayor. Then there is Corey, Connor--Corey and Connor Sotomayor. I shouldn't have said--I should have said their last name first together. And the remainder of that row is filled with godchildren and dear friends. But this is my immediate family. Chairman Leahy. Well, thank you very much. I remember reading about the marshals being surprised at your swearing-in as a district court judge because they had never seen such a large crowd of friends and supporters arrive. What we are going to do is each Senator will give a 10- minute opening statement. I would hope that all Senators would be able to be here today. If they are not, and if they want to give an opening statement, it will have to come out of their question time tomorrow. Senator Schumer will give a shorter opening statement than the others because he is going to reserve some of his time as a later introduction. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM VERMONT, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY Chairman Leahy. I would note for the record we are considering the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be a Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Our Constitution is interesting in this regard. We have over 300 million Americans, but only 101 people get a chance to say who is going to be on the Supreme Court: first and foremost, of course, the President--in this case President Obama--who made the nomination; and then 100 Senators have to stand in place of all almost 320 million Americans in considering the appointment. The President has done his part. He has made a historic nomination. Now the Senate has to do its part on behalf of the Senate people--on behalf of the American people. President Obama often quotes Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s insight that ``the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.'' Each generation of Americans has sought that arc toward justice. We have improved upon the foundation of our Constitution through the Bill of Rights, the Civil War amendments, the 19th Amendment's expansion of the right to vote to women, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the 26th Amendment's extension of the right to vote to young people. These actions have marked progress toward our more perfect union, and I believe this nomination can be another step along that path. Judge Sotomayor.'s journey to this hearing room is a truly American story. She was raised by her mother, Celina, a nurse, in the South Bronx. Like her mother, Sonia Sotomayor worked hard. She graduated as the valedictorian of her class at Blessed Sacrament and at Cardinal Spellman High School in New York. She was a member of just the third class at Princeton University in which women were included. She continued to work hard, including reading classics that had been unavailable to her when she was younger and arranging tutoring to improve her writing. She graduated summa cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa; she was awarded the M. Taylor Senior Pyne Prize for scholastic excellence and service to the university. I would mention that is an honor that is given for outstanding merit. After excelling at Princeton, she entered Yale Law School, where she was an active member of the law school community. Upon graduation, she had many options, but she chose to serve her community in the New York District Attorney's Office. And I might say parenthetically, every one of us who has had the privilege to be a prosecutor knows what kind of a job that is and how hard it is. There she prosecuted murders, robberies, assaults, and child pornography. The first President Bush named her to the Federal bench in 1992, and she served as a trial judge for 6 years. President Clinton named her to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit where she has served for more than 10 years. She was confirmed each time by a bipartisan majority in the Senate. Judge Sotomayor's qualifications are outstanding. She has more Federal court judicial experience than any nominee to the United States Supreme Court in nearly 100 years. She is the first nominee in well over a century to be nominated to three different Federal judgeships by three different Presidents. She is the first nominee in 50 years to be nominated to the Supreme Court after serving as both a Federal trial judge and a Federal appellate judge. She will be the only current Supreme Court Justice to have served as a trial judge. She was a prosecutor and a lawyer in private practice. She brings a wealth and diversity of experience to the Court. I hope all Americans are encouraged by Judge Sotomayor's achievements and by her nomination to the Nation's highest court. Hers is a success story in which all--all--Americans can take pride. Those who break barriers often face the added burden of overcoming prejudice, and that has been true on the Supreme Court. Thurgood Marshall graduated first in his law school class. He was the lead counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. He sat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; he served as the Nation's top lawyer, the Solicitor General of the United States. He won a remarkable 29 out of 32 cases before the Supreme Court. But despite all of these qualifications and achievements, when he was before the Senate for his confirmation, he was asked questions designed to embarrass him, questions such as ``Are you prejudiced against the white people of the South? '' I hope that is a time of our past. The confirmation of Justice Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish American to be nominated to the high Court, was a struggle rife with anti-Semitism and charges that he was a ``radical.'' The commentary at the time included questions about ``the Jewish mind'' and how ``its operations are complicated by altruism.'' Likewise, the first Catholic nominee had to overcome the argument that ``as a Catholic he would be dominated by the pope.'' We are in a different era, and I would trust that all members of this Committee here today will reject the efforts of partisans and outside pressure groups that have sought to create a caricature of Judge Sotomayor while belittling her record, her achievements, and her intelligence. Let no one demean--let no one demand--this extraordinary woman, her success, or her understanding of the constitutional duties she has faithfully performed for the last 17 years. And I hope all Senators will join together as we did when we considered President Reagan's nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor as the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court. There every Democrat and every Republican voted to confirm her. This hearing is an opportunity for Americans to see and hear Judge Sotomayor for themselves and to consider her qualifications. It is the most transparent confirmation hearing ever held. Her decisions and confirmation materials have been posted online and made publicly available. The record is significantly more complete than that available when we considered President Bush's nominations of John Roberts and Samuel Alito just a few years ago. The judge's testimony will be carried live on several television stations and also live via webcast--something that I have set for the Judiciary Committee website. My review of her judicial record leads me to conclude that she is a careful and restrained judge with a deep respect for judicial precedent and for the powers of the other branches of the Government, including the law-making role of Congress. That conclusion is supported by a number of independent studies that have been made of her record and shines through in a comprehensive review of her tough and fair record in criminal cases. She has a deep understanding of the real lives--the real lives--of Americans and the duty of law enforcement to help keep Americans safe and the responsibilities of all of us to respect the freedoms that define America. Now, unfortunately, some have sought to twist her words and her record and to engage in partisan political attacks. Ideological pressure groups began attacking her even before the President made his selection. They then stepped up their attacks by threatening Republican Senators who do not oppose her. That is not the American way, and that should not be the Senate way. In truth, we do not have to speculate about what kind of a Justice she will be because we have seen what kind of a judge she has been. She is a judge in which all Americans can have confidence. She has been a judge for all Americans, and she will be a Justice for all Americans. Our ranking Republican Senator on this Committee reflected on the confirmation process recently, saying: ``What I found was that charges come flying in from right and left that are unsupported and false. It's very, very difficult for a nominee to push back. So I think we have a high responsibility to base any criticisms that we have on a fair and honest statement of the facts and that nominees should not be subjected to distortions of their record.'' I agree with Senator Sessions. As we proceed, let no one distort the judge's record. Let us be fair to her and to the American people by not misrepresenting her views. We are a country bound together by our magnificent Constitution. It guarantees the promise that our country will be a country based on the rule of law. In her service as a Federal judge, Sonia Sotomayor has kept faith with that promise. She understands that there is not one law for one race or another. There is not one law for one color or another. There is not one law for rich and a different one for poor. There is only one law. And, Judge, I remember so well when you sat in my office, and you said that ``ultimately and completely'' a judge has to follow the law, no matter what their upbringing has been. That is the kind of fair and impartial judging the American people expect. That is respect for the rule of law. And that is the kind of judge Judge Sotomayor has been. That is the kind of fair and impartial Justice she will be and that the American people deserve. Judge Sotomayor. has been nominated to replace Justice Souter, whose retirement last month has left the Court with only eight Justices. Justice Souter served the Nation with distinction for nearly two decades on the Supreme Court with a commitment to justice, an admiration for the law, and an understanding of the impact of the Court's decisions on the daily lives of ordinary Americans. I believe that Judge Sotomayor will be in this same mold and will serve as a Justice in the manner of Sandra Day O'Connor, committed to the law and not to ideology. In the weeks and months leading up to this hearing, I have heard the President and Senators from both sides of the aisle make reference to the engraving over the entrance of the Supreme Court. I look at that every time I go up there. It is carved in Vermont marble, and it says: ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' Judge Sotomayor's nomination keeps faith with those words. Senator Sessions. STATEMENT OF JEFF SESSIONS, A U.S. SENATOR FROM ALABAMA, RANKING MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY Senator Sessions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your leadership, and I believe you have set up some rules for the conducting of this hearing that are consistent with past hearings and I believe allow us to do our work together. And I have enjoyed working with you on this process. Chairman Leahy. Thank you. Senator Sessions. I hope this will be viewed as the best hearing this Committee has ever had. Why not? We should seek that. So I join Chairman Leahy, Judge Sotomayor, in welcoming you here today. It marks an important milestone in your life. I know your family is proud, and rightly so. And it is a pleasure to have them with us today. I expect this hearing and resulting debate will be characterized by a respectful tone, a discussion of serious issues, a thoughtful dialogue, and maybe some disagreements. But we have worked hard to set that tone from the beginning. I have been an active litigator in Federal courts. I have tried cases as a Federal prosecutor and as Attorney General of Alabama. The Constitution and our great heritage of law I care deeply about. They are the foundation of our liberty and our prosperity, and this nomination hearing is critical for two important reasons. First, Justices on the Supreme Court have great responsibility, hold enormous power, and have a lifetime appointment. Just five members can declare the meaning of our Constitution, bending or changing its meaning from what the people intended. Second, this hearing is important because I believe our legal system is at a dangerous crossroads. Down one path is the traditional American system, so admired around the world, where judges impartially apply the law to the facts without regard to personal views. This is the compassionate system because it is the fair system. In the American legal system, courts do not make the law or set policy, because allowing unelected officials to make law would strike at the heart of our democracy. Here, judges take an oath to administer justice impartially. That oath reads: ``I . . . do solemnly swear that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the rich and the poor, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me . . . under the Constitution and laws of the United States. So help me God.'' These principles give the traditional system its moral authority, which is why Americans respect and accept the rulings of courts--even when they disagree. Indeed, our legal system is based on a firm belief in an ordered universe and objective truth. The trial is the process by which the impartial and wise judge guides us to truth. Down the other path lies a Brave New World where words have no true meaning and judges are free to decide what facts they choose to see. In this world, a judge is free to push his or her own political or social agenda. I reject that view, and Americans reject that view. We have seen Federal judges force their own political and social agenda on the Nation, dictating that the words ``under God'' be removed from the Pledge of Allegiance and barring students from even private--even silent prayer in schools. Judges have dismissed the people's right to their property, saying the Government can take a person's home for the purpose of developing a private shopping center. Judges have--contrary to longstanding rules of war--created a right for terrorists, captured on a foreign battlefield, to sue the United States Government in our own country. Judges have cited foreign laws, world opinion, and a United Nations resolution to determine that a State death penalty law was unconstitutional. I am afraid our system will only be further corrupted, I have to say, as a result of President Obama's views that, in tough cases, the critical ingredient for a judge is the ``depth and breadth of one's empathy,'' as well as, his word, ``their broader vision of what America should be.'' Like the American people, I have watched this process for a number of years, and I fear that this ``empathy standard'' is another step down the road to a liberal activist, results- oriented, and relativistic world where laws lose their fixed meaning, unelected judges set policy, Americans are seen as members of separate groups rather than as simply Americans, and where the constitutional limits on Government power are ignored when politicians want to buy out private companies. So we have reached a fork in the road, I think, and there are stark differences. I want to be clear: I will not vote for--and no senator should vote for--an individual nominated by any President who is not fully committed to fairness and impartiality toward every person who appears before them. I will not vote for--and no Senator should vote for--an individual nominated by any President who believes it is acceptable for a judge to allow their personal background, gender, prejudices, or sympathies to sway their decision in favor of, or against, parties before the court. In my view, such a philosophy is disqualifying. Such an approach to judging means that the umpire calling the game is not neutral, but instead feels empowered to favor one team over the other. Call it empathy, call it prejudice, or call it sympathy, but whatever it is, it is not law. In truth, it is more akin to politics, and politics has no place in the courtroom. Some will respond, ``Judge Sotomayor would never say it's acceptable for a judge to display prejudice in a case.'' But I regret to say, Judge, that some of your statements that I will outline seem to say that clearly. Let's look at just a few examples. We have seen the video of the Duke University panel where Judge Sotomayor says ``It is [the] Court of Appeals where policy is made. And I know, and I know, that this is on tape, and I should never say that, and should not think that.'' And during a speech 15 years ago, Judge Sotomayor said, ``I willingly accept that we who judge must not deny the differences resulting from experience and heritage but attempt . . . continuously to judge when those opinions, sympathies, and prejudices are appropriate.'' And in the same speech, she said, ``my experiences will affect the facts I choose to see. . .'' Having tried a lot of cases, that particular phrase bothers me. I expect every judge to see all the facts. So I think it is noteworthy that, when asked about Judge Sotomayor's now-famous statement that a ``wise Latina'' would come to a better conclusion than others, President Obama, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, and Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg declined to defend the substance of those remarks. They each assumed that the nominee misspoke. But I do not think it--but the nominee did not misspeak. She is on record as making this statement at least five times over the course of a decade. I am providing a copy of the full text of those speeches for the record. [The speeches appear as a submission for the record.] Senator Sessions. Others will say that, despite these statements, we should look to the nominee's record, which they characterize as ``moderate.'' People said the same of Justice Ginsburg, who is now considered to be one of the most members of the Supreme Court in history. Some Senators ignored Justice Ginsburg's philosophy and focused on the nominee's judicial opinions. But that is not a good test because those cases were necessarily restrained by precedent and the threat of reversal from higher courts. On the Supreme Court, those checks on judicial power will be removed, and the judge's philosophy will be allowed to reach full bloom. But even as a lower court judge, our nominee has made some troubling rulings. I am concerned by Ricci, the New Haven Firefighters case--recently reversed by the Supreme Court-- where she agreed with the City of New Haven's decision to change the promotion rules in the middle of the game. Incredibly, her opinion consisted of just one substantive paragraph of analysis. Judge Sotomayor has said that she accepts that her opinions, sympathies, and prejudices will affect her rulings. Could it be that her time as a leader in the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, a fine organization, provides a clue to her decision against the firefighters? While the nominee was Chair of that fund's Litigation Committee, the organization aggressively pursued racial quotas in city hiring and, in numerous cases, fought to overturn the results of promotion exams. It seems to me that in Ricci, Judge Sotomayor's empathy for one group of firefighters turned out to be prejudice against another. That is, of course, the logical flaw in the ``empathy standard.'' Empathy for one party is always prejudice against another. Judge Sotomayor, we will inquire into how your philosophy, which allows subjectivity in the courtroom, affects your decisionmaking like, for example, in abortion, where an organization in which you were an active leader argued that the Constitution requires taxpayer money to fund abortions; and gun control, where you recently noted it is ``settled law'' that the Second Amendment does not prevent a city or State from barring gun ownership; private property, where you have ruled recently that the Government could take property from one pharmacy developer and give it to another; capital punishment, where you personally signed a statement opposing the reinstatement of the death penalty in New York because of the ``inhuman[e] psychological burden'' it places on the offender and the family. So I hope the American people will follow these hearings closely. They should learn about the issues and listen to both sides of the argument, and at the end of the hearing ask: ``If I must one day go to court, what kind of judge do I wish to hear my case? '' ``Do I want a judge that allows his or her social, political, or religious views to change the outcome? Or do I want a judge that impartially applies the law to the facts and fairly rules on the merits, without bias or prejudice? '' It is our job to determine on which side of that fundamental divide the nominee stands. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. Thank you. Another housekeeping thing. We are going to try to keep these opening statements to 10 minutes. I will recognize Senators on the Democratic side based on seniority. I have told Senator Sessions I will---- Senator Sessions. Likewise. Chairman Leahy. That is what you want on your side. Then they will be recognized on your side by the same way. So the next Senator is Senator Kohl. STATEMENT OF HON. HERB KOHL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN Senator Kohl. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Sotomayor, let me also extend my welcome to you and to your family. You are to be congratulated on your nomination. Your nomination is a reflection of who we are as a country, and it represents an American success story that we all can be proud of. Your academic and professional accomplishments--as prosecutor, private practitioner, trial judge and appellate judge--are exemplary. And as a judge, you have brought a richness of experience to the bench and to the judiciary which has been an inspiration for so many. Today, we begin a process through which the Senate engages in its constitutional role to ``advise and consent'' on your nomination. This week's hearing is the only opportunity we--and the American people--will have to learn about your judicial philosophy, your temperament, and your motivations before you put on the black robe and are heard from only in your opinions. The President has asked us to entrust you with an immense amount of power--power which, by design, is free from political constraints, unchecked by the people, and unaccountable to Congress, except in the most extreme circumstances. Our democracy, our rights, and everything we hold dear about America are built on the foundation of our Constitution. For more than 200 years, the Court has interpreted the meaning of the Constitution and, in so doing, guaranteed our most cherished rights: the right to equal education regardless of race; the right to an attorney and a fair trial for the accused; the right to personal privacy; the right to speak, vote, and worship without interference from the Government. Should you be confirmed, you and your colleagues will decide the future scope of our rights and the breadth of our freedoms. Your decisions will shape the fabric of American society for many years to come. And that is why it is so important that over the course of the next few days, we gain a good understanding of what is in your heart and in your mind. We don't have a right to know in advance how you will rule on cases which will come before you. But we need--and we deserve--to know what you think about fundamental issues such as civil rights, privacy, property rights, the separation of church and state, and civil liberties, just to name a few. Some believe that the confirmation process has become thoroughly scripted and that nominees are far too careful in cloaking their answers to important questions in generalities and with caveats about future cases. I recognize this concern, but I also hope that you recognize our need to have a frank discussion about these important issues. And these are not just concepts for law books. They are issues Americans care about. As crime plagues our communities, we navigate the balance between individual rights and the duty of law enforcement to protect and maintain order. As families struggle to make ends meet in these difficult times, we question the permissible role for Government in helping get the economy back on track. As we continue to strive for equal rights in our schools and workplaces, we debate the tensions between admissions policies and hiring practices that acknowledge diversity, and those that attempt to be colorblind. These issues invite all Americans to struggle with the dilemmas of democracy and the great questions of our Constitution. If we discuss them with candor, I believe we will have a conversation that the American people will profit from. When considering Supreme Court nominees over the years, I have judged each one with a test of judicial excellence. First, judicial excellence means the competence, character, and temperament that we expect of a Supreme Court Justice. He or she must have a keen understanding of the law and the ability to explain it in ways that both the litigants and the American people will understand and respect, even if they disagree with the outcome. Second, I look for a nominee to have the sense of values which form the core of our political and economic system. No one, including the President, has the right to require ideological purity from a member of the Supreme Court. But we do have a right to require that the nominee accept both the basic principles of the Constitution and its core values implanted in society. Third, we want a nominee with a sense of compassion. This is a quality that I have considered with the last six Supreme Court Justices. Compassion does not mean bias or lack of impartiality. It is meant to remind us that the law is more than an intellectual game and more than a mental exercise. As Justice Black said, ``The courts stand against any winds that blow as havens of refuge for those who might otherwise suffer because they are helpless, weak, outnumbered or because they are non-conforming victims of prejudice and public excitement.'' A Supreme Court Justice must also be able to recognize that real people with real problems are affected by the decisions rendered by the Court. He or she must have a connection with and an understanding of the problems that people struggle with on a daily basis. For justice, after all, may be blind, but it should not be deaf. As Justice Thomas told us at his confirmation hearing, it is important that a Justice ``can walk in the shoes of the people who are affected by what the Court does.'' I believe this comment embodies what President Obama intended when he said he wanted a nominee with ``an understanding of how the world works and how ordinary people live.'' Some critics are concerned that your background will inappropriately impact your decision making. But it is impossible for any of us to remove ourselves from our life story with all the twists and turns that make us who we are. As you have acknowledged, ``My experiences in life unquestionably shape my attitudes.'' And I hope that we on this Committee can appreciate and relate to ourselves what you said next: ``. . . but I am cognizant enough that mine is not the only experience.'' You will have an opportunity before this Committee to assure us that your life experiences will impact but not overwhelm your duty to follow the law and Constitution. After your confirmation to the Court of Appeals in 1998, you said about the discussions at your confirmation hearing, ``So long as people of good will are participating in the process and attempting to be balanced in their approach, then the system will remain healthy.'' I hope our process will include a healthy level of balanced and respectful debate, and I look forward to the opportunity to learn more about you and what sort of Justice you aspire to be. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. Thank you, Senator. Senator Hatch. Also a former Chairman of this Committee. STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM UTAH Senator Hatch. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge, welcome to you and your good family. We are grateful to have all of you here. Now, this is the 12th hearing for a Supreme Court nomination in which I have participated, and I am as struck today as I was the first time by the seriousness of our responsibility and its impact on America. I am confident that under this Committee's leadership, from both you, Mr. Chairman, and the distinguished Ranking Member, this hearing will be both respectful and substantive. Judge Sotomayor comes to this Committee for the third time, having served in the first two levels of the Federal judiciary and now being nominated to the third. She has a compelling life story and a strong record of educational and professional achievement. Her nomination speaks to the opportunities that America today provides for men and women of different backgrounds and heritage. The liberty we enjoy here in America makes these opportunities possible and requires our best efforts to protect that liberty. Our liberty rests on the foundation of a written Constitution that limits and separates government power, self- government by the people, and the rule of law. Those principles define the kind of judge our liberty requires. They define the role judges may play in our system of government. I have described my basic approach to the judicial confirmation process in more detail elsewhere, so I ask unanimous consent that my article published this year in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, entitled ``The Constitution Is the Playbook for Judicial Selection,'' be placed in the record, Mr. Chairman, if I can. Chairman Leahy. Without objection. [The article appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Hatch. My approach includes three elements: First, the Senate owes some deference to the President's qualified nominees; Second, a judicial nominee's qualifications include not only legal experience but, more importantly, judicial philosophy. By that I mean a nominee's understanding of the power and proper role of judges in our system of government; Third, this standard must be applied to the nominee's entire record. I have also found guidance from what may seem to be as an unusual source. On June 8, 2005, then-Senator Barack Obama explained his opposition to the appeals court nomination of Janice Rogers Brown, an African American woman with a truly compelling life story, who then served as a justice on the California Supreme Court. Senator Obama made three arguments that I find relevant today. First, he argued that the test of a qualified judicial nominee is whether she can set aside her personal views and, as he put it, ``decide each case on the facts and the merits alone. That is what our Founders intended. Judicial decisions ultimately have to be based on evidence and on facts. They have to be based on precedent and on law.'' Second, Senator Obama extensively reviewed Justice Brown's speeches off the court for clues about what he called her ``overreaching judicial philosophy.'' There is even more reason to do so today. This is, after all, a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. Judge Sotomayor, if confirmed, will help change the very precedents that today bind her as a circuit court of appeals judge. In other words, the judicial position to which she has been nominated is quite different than the judicial position she now occupies. This makes evidence outside of her appeals court decisions regarding her approach to judging more, not less, important. Judge Sotomayor has obviously thought, spoken, and written much on these issues, and I think we show respect to her by taking her entire record seriously. Third, Senator Obama said that while a nominee's race, gender, and life story are important, they cannot distract from the fundamental focus on the kind of judge she will be. He said then, as I have said today, that we should all be grateful for the opportunity that our liberty affords for Americans of different backgrounds. We should applaud Judge Sotomayor's achievements and service to her community, her profession, and her country. Yet Senator Obama called it ``offensive and cynical'' to suggest that a nominee's race or gender can give her a pass for her substantive views. He proved it by voting twice to filibuster Janice Rogers Brown's nomination and then by voting against her confirmation. I share his hope that we have arrived at a point in our country's history where individuals can be examined and even criticized for their views, no matter what their race or gender. If those standards were appropriate when Senator Obama opposed Republican nominees, they should be appropriate now that President Obama is choosing his own nominees. But today President Obama says that personal empathy is an essential ingredient in judicial decisions. Today we are urged to ignore Judge Sotomayor's speeches altogether and focus only on her judicial decisions, which are extensive. I do not believe that we should do just that. I wish that other current standards had been applied to past nominees. Democratic Senators, for example, offer as proof of Judge Sotomayor's moderation that she has agreed with her Republican-appointed Second Circuit colleagues 95 percent of the time. Joined by then--for which I congratulate her. Joined by then-Senator Obama, however, many of those same Democratic Senators voted against Justice Samuel Alito's confirmation, even though he had voted with his Democrat-appointed Third Circuit colleagues 99 percent of the time during a more longer appeals court career. And although Justice Alito also received the ABA's highest rating, Senator Obama joined 24 other Democrats on even voting to filibuster his nomination. And then he joined a total of 42 Democrats in voting against the confirmation of now-Justice Alito. In fact, Senator Obama never voted to confirm a Supreme Court Justice. He even voted against the man who administered the oath of Presidential office, Chief Justice John Roberts, another distinguished and well-qualified nominee. Now, if a compelling life story, academic and professional excellence, and a top ABA rating make a convincing confirmation case, Miguel Estrada would be a U.S. circuit judge today. He is a brilliant, universally respected lawyer, one of the top Supreme Court practitioners in America. But he was fiercely opposed by groups and repeatedly filibustered by Democrat Senators, and ones who today say these same factors should count in Judge Sotomayor's favor. Now, whether I vote for or against Judge Sotomayor, it will be by applying the principles that I have laid out, not by using such tactics and standards used against these nominees in the past. Judicial appointments have become increasingly contentious. Some of the things that have been said about Judge Sotomayor have been intemperate and unfair. There are now newspaper reports that left-wing groups supporting Judge Sotomayor--specifically, the extreme-left People for the American Way--are engaged in a smear campaign against the plaintiff in one of her more controversial cases, a man who will be testifying here later in the week. If that is true--and I hope it is not--it is beneath both contempt and the dignity that this process demands. But there must be a vigorous debate about the kind of judge America needs because nothing less than our liberty is at stake. Must judges set aside or may judges consider their personal feelings in deciding cases? Is judicial impartiality a duty or an option? Does the fact that judicial decisions affect so many people's lives require judges to be objective and impartial? Or does it allow them to be subjective and sympathetic? Judge Sotomayor's nomination raises these and other important issues, and I look forward to a respectful and energetic debate. The confirmation process in general, and this hearing in particular, must be both dignified and thorough. There are very different and strongly held views about the issues we will explore, in particular the role that judges should play in our system of government. The task before us is to determine whether Judge Sonia Sotomayor is qualified by legal experience, and especially by judicial philosophy, to sit on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. Doing so requires examining her entire record, her speeches and articles, as well as her judicial decisions. We must at the same time be thankful for the opportunity represented by Judge Sotomayor's nomination and focus squarely on whether she will be the kind of judge required by the very liberty that makes that opportunity possible. Judge, I am proud of you and I wish you well. This will be an interesting experience, and I expect you to be treated with dignity and respect throughout. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. I yield to the Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Feinstein. STATEMENT OF HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA Senator Feinstein. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Judge Sotomayor. I want to congratulate you on your nomination, and I also want to start out with a couple of personal words. Your nomination I view with a great sense of personal pride. You are indeed a very special woman. You have overcome adversity and disadvantage. You have grown in strength and determination, and you have achieved respect and admiration for what has been a brilliant legal and judicial career. If confirmed, you will join the Supreme Court with more Federal judicial experience than any Justice in the past 100 years. And you bring with you 29\\1/2\\ years of varied legal experience to the Court. By this standard you are well qualified. In your 11 years as a Federal appellate court judge, you have participated in 3,000 appeals and authored roughly 400 published opinions. In your 6 years on the Federal court, you were the trial judge in approximately 450 cases. For 4\\1/2\\ years, you prosecuted crimes as an assistant DA in New York City. And you spent 8 years litigating business cases at a New York law firm. What is unique about this broad experience is that you have seen the law truly from all sides. On the district court you saw firsthand the actual impact of the law on people before you in both civil and criminal cases. You considered, wrote, and joined thousands of opinions clarifying the law and reviewing district court decisions in your time on the appellate court. Your 11 years there were a rigorous training ground for the Supreme Court. It is very unique for a judge to have both levels of Federal court experience, and you will be the only one on the current Supreme Court with this background. You were a prosecutor who tried murder, robbery, and child pornography cases. So you know firsthand the impact of crime on a major metropolis, and you have administered justice in the close and personal forum of a trial court. You also possess a wealth of knowledge in the complicated arena of business law with its contract disputes, patent and copyright issues, and antitrust questions. And as an associate and partner at a private law firm, you have tried complex civil cases in the areas of real estate, banking, and contracts law, as well as intellectual property law, which I am told was a specialty of yours. So you bring a deep and broad experience in the law to the Supreme Court. In my nearly 17 years on this Committee, I have held certain qualities that a Supreme Court nominee must possess: First, broad and relative experience. You satisfy that. Second, a strong and deep knowledge of the law and the Constitution. You satisfy that. Third, a firm commitment to follow the law. And you have in all of the statistics indicated that. Next, a judicial temperament and integrity. And you have both of those. And, finally, mainstream legal reasoning. And there is everything in your record to indicate---- [Protestor outburst.] Chairman Leahy. The Senate will---- [Protestor outburst.] Chairman Leahy. The police will remove that man. Let me make very clear: There will be no outbursts allowed in this Committee, either for or against the nominee, either for or against any position that Senator Sessions or I or any other Senator have. This is a hearing of the United States Senate, and we will have order and we will have decorum. There are people who want to have this hearing. In fairness to Judge Sotomayor, it will be done orderly, and I will direct the police to remove anybody who does any kind of an outburst, either for or against the nominee, either for or against any member of this Committee. Senator Sessions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your firm words. I support you 100 percent. Chairman Leahy. Thank you. And the record will show my comments outside of Senator Feinstein's comments, and I yield back to her. Senator Feinstein. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Bottom line, I believe your record indicates that you possess all of these qualities. Over the past years of my service on this Committee, I have found it increasingly difficult to know from answers to questions we ask from this dais how a nominee will actually act as a Supreme Court Justice, because answers here are often indirect and increasingly couched in euphemistic phrases. For example, nominees have often responded to our specific questions with phrases like ``I have an open mind,'' or yes, that is precedent ``entitled to respect,'' or ``I have no quarrel with that.'' Of course, these phrases obfuscate and prevent a clear understanding of where a nominee really stands. For example, several past nominees have been asked about the Casey decision, where the Court held that the Government cannot restrict access to abortions that are medically necessary to preserve a woman's health. Some nominees responded by assuring that Roe and Casey were precedents of the Court entitled to great respect. And in one of the hearings, through questioning by Senator Specter, this line of cases was acknowledged to have created a ``super- precedent.'' But once on the Court, the same nominees voted to overturn the key holding in Casey--that laws restricting a woman's medical care must contain an exception to protect her health. Their decision did not comport with the answers they gave here, and it disregarded stare decisis and the precedents established in Roe, in Ashcroft, in Casey, in Thornburgh, in Carhart I, and in Ayotte. So ``super-precedent'' went out the window, and women lost a fundamental constitutional protection that had existed for 36 years. Also, it showed me that Supreme Court Justices are much more than umpires calling balls and strikes and that the word ``activist'' is often used only to describe opinions of one side. As a matter of fact, in just 2 years, these same nominees have either disregarded or overturned precedent in at least eight other cases: A case involving assignments to attain racial diversity in school assignments; a case overruling 70 years of precedent on the Second Amendment and Federal gun control law; a case which increased the burden of proof on older workers to prove age discrimination; a case overturning a 1911 decision to allow manufacturers to set minimum prices for their products; a case overruling two cases from the 1960s on time limits for filing criminal appeals; a case reversing precedent on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel; a case overturning a prior ruling on regulation of issue ads relating to political campaigns; and a case disregarding prior law and creating a new standard that limits when cities can replace civil service exams that they may believe have discriminated against a group of workers. So I do not believe that Supreme Court Justices are merely umpires calling balls and strikes. Rather, I believe that they make the decisions of individuals who bring to the Court their own experiences and philosophies. Judge Sotomayor, I believe you are a warm and intelligent woman. I believe you are well studied and experienced in the law with some 17 years of Federal court experience involving 3,000 appeals and 450 trial cases. So I believe you, too, will bring your experiences and philosophies to this highest Court, and I believe that will do only one thing--and, that is, to strengthen this high institution of our great country. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. Senator Grassley. STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM IOWA Senator Grassley. Judge Sotomayor, I notice how attentive you have been to everything we are saying. Thank you very much. Congratulations on your nomination to be Associate Justice and welcome to the Judiciary Committee, and a warm welcome to you and your family and friends. They are all very proud of you, and rightly so. You have a distinguished legal and judicial record. No doubt it is one that we would expect of any individual nominated to the Supreme Court. You made your start from very humble beginnings. You overcame substantial obstacles and went on to excel at some of the Nation's top schools. You became an assistant district attorney and successful private practice attorney in New York City. You have been on the Federal bench as a district court and appellate court judge since 1992. These are all very impressive legal accomplishments which certainly qualify you to be on the Supreme Court. However, an impressive legal record and superior intellect are not the only criteria that we on this Committee have to consider. To be truly qualified, the nominee must understand the proper role of a judge in society--that is, we want to be absolutely certain that the nominee will faithfully interpret the law and the Constitution without bias or prejudice. This is the most critical qualification of a Supreme Court Justice--the capacity to set aside one's own feelings so that he or she can blindly and dispassionately administer equal justice for all. So the Senate has a constitutional responsibility of advise and consent, to confirm intelligent, experienced individuals anchored in the Constitution, not individuals who will pursue personal and political agendas from the bench. Judge Sotomayor, you are nominated to the highest Court of the land which has the final say on the law. As such, it is even more important for the Senate to ascertain whether you can resist the temptations to mold the Constitution to your own personal beliefs and preferences. It is even more important for the Senate to ascertain whether you can dispense justice without bias or prejudice. Supreme Court Justices sit on the highest Court in the land so that they are not as constrained, as you know, to follow precedent to the same extent as district and circuit judges. There is a proper role of a judge in our system of limited government and checks and balances. Our democratic system of government demands that judges not take on the role of policymakers. That is a role properly reserved to legislators, who can be voted out of office if people do not like what they legislate, unlike judges not being voted out of office. The Supreme Court is meant to be a legal institution, not a political one. But some individuals and groups do not see it that way. They see the Supreme Court as ground zero for their political and social battles. They want Justices to implement their political and social agenda through the judicial process. That is not what our great American tradition envisioned. Those battles are appropriately fought in our branch of Government, the legislative branch. So it is incredibly important that we get it right and confirm the right kind of person for the Supreme Court. Supreme Court nominees should respect the constitutional separation of power. They should understand that the touchstone of being a good judge is the exercise of judicial restraint. Good judges understand that their job is not to impose their own personal opinions of right and wrong. They know their job is to say what the law is rather than what they personally think that it ought to be. Good judges understand that they must meticulously apply the law and the Constitution even if the results they reach are unpopular. Good judges know that the constitutional law constrains judges every bit as much as it constrains legislators, executives, and our whole citizenry. Good judges not only understand these fundamental principles; they live and breathe them. President Obama said that he would nominate judges based on their ability to empathize in general and with certain groups in particular. This empathy standard is troubling to me. In fact, I am concerned that judging based on empathy is really just legislating from the bench. The Constitution requires that judges be free from personal politics, feelings, and preferences. President Obama's empathy standard appears to encourage judges to make use of their personal politics, feelings, and preferences. This is contrary to what most of us understand to be the role of the judiciary. President Obama clearly believes that you measure up to his empathy standard. That worries me. I have reviewed your record and have concerns about your judicial philosophy. For example, in one speech you doubted that a judge could ever be truly impartial. In another speech, you argued that it is a disservice both to law and society for judges to disregard personal views shaped by one's ``differences as a woman or man of color.'' In yet another speech, you proclaimed that the court of appeals is where policy is made. Your ``wise Latina'' comment starkly contradicts a statement by Justice O'Connor that a wise old man and a wise old woman would eventually reach the same conclusion in a case. These statements go directly to your views of how a judge should use his or her background and experience when deciding cases. Unfortunately, I fear they do not comport with what I and many others believe is the proper role of a judge or an appropriate judicial method. The American legal system requires that judges check their biases, personal preferences, and politics at the door of the courthouse. Lady Justice stands before the Supreme Court with a blindfold, holding the scales of justice. Just like Lady Justice, judges and Justices must wear blindfolds when they interpret the Constitution and administer justice. I will be asking you about your ability to wear that judicial blindfold. I will be asking you about your ability to decide cases in an impartial manner and in accordance with the law and the Constitution. I will be asking you about your judicial philosophy, whether you allow biases and personal preferences to dictate your judicial methods. Finally--or ideally, the Supreme Court shouldn't be made up of men and women who are on the side of one special group or issue; rather, the Supreme Court should be made up of men and women who are on the side of the law and the Constitution. I am looking to support a restrained jurist committed to the rule of law and the Constitution. I am not looking to support a creative jurist who will allow his or her background and personal preferences to decide cases. The Senate needs to do its job and conduct a comprehensive and careful review of your record and qualifications. You are nominated to a lifetime position on the highest Court. The Senate has a tremendous responsibility to confirm an individual who has superior intellectual abilities, solid legal expertise, and an even judicial demeanor and temperament. Above all, we have a tremendous responsibility to confirm an individual who truly understands the proper role of a Justice. So I will be asking questions about your judicial qualifications. However, like all of my colleagues, I am committed to giving you a fair and respectful hearing as is appropriate for Supreme Court nominees. I congratulate you once again. Chairman Leahy. Thank you, Senator Grassley. Senator Feingold, I would yield to you. STATEMENT OF HON. RUSSELL FEINGOLD, A U.S. SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN Senator Feingold. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I too want to welcome and congratulate the nominee, Judge Sotomayor. I greatly admire your accomplishments and your long record of public service. Let me also thank you in advance for the long week you're about to spend in this room. The Supreme Court plays a unique and central role in the life of our nation. Those who sit as Justices have extraordinary power over some of the most important, and most intimate, aspects of the lives of American citizens. It is therefore not surprising at all that the nomination and confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice is such a widely anticipated and widely covered event. The nine men and women who sit on the court have enormous responsibilities, and those of us tasked with voting on the confirmation of a nominee have a significant responsibility as well. This is clearly one of the most consequential things that one does as a United States Senator and I'm honored and humbled to be given this role by the people of Wisconsin. The ultimate responsibility of the Supreme Court is to safeguard the rule of law, which defines us as a nation and protects us all. In the past eight years, the Supreme Court has played a crucial role in checking some of the previous administration's most egregious departures from the rule of law. Time after time in cases arising out of actions taken by the Administration after September 11, the court has said: ``No. You have gone too far.'' It said ``no'' to the Bush Administration's view that it could set up a law-free zone at Guantanamo Bay. It said ``no'' to the Administration's view that it could hold a citizen in the United States incommunicado indefinitely with no access to a lawyer. It said ``no'' to the Administration's decision to create military commissions without congressional authorization, and it said no to the Administration and to Congress when they tried to strip the constitutional right to habeus corpus from prisoners held at Guantanamo. These were courageous decisions, and in my opinion, they were correct decisions. They made plain, as Justice O'Connor wrote in the Hamdi decision in 2004: ``A state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the nation's citizens.'' These were all close decisions, some decided by a 5 to 4 vote. That fact underscores the unparalleled power that each Supreme Court justice has. In my opinion, one of the most important qualities that a Supreme Court justice must have is courage. The courage to stand up to the President and Congress in order to protect the constitutional rights of the American people and preserve the rule of law. I have touched on the crucial recent decisions of the court in the area of executive power, but we know, of course, that there are countless past Supreme Court decisions that have had a major impact on aspects of our national life. The court rejected racial discrimination in education; it guaranteed the principle of ``one person, one vote''; it made sure that even the poorest person accused of a crime in this country can be represented by counsel; it made sure that newspapers can't be sued for libel by public figures for merely making a mistake. It protected the privacy of telephone conversations from unjustified government eavesdropping; it protected an individual's right to possess afirearm for private use; and it even decided a presidential election. It made these decisions by interpreting and applying open- ended language in our Constitution. Phrases like ``equal protection of the laws,'' ``due process of law,'' ``freedom of the press,'' ``unreasonable searches and seizures,'' and ``the right to bear arms.'' Senator Feinstein just suggested these momentous decisions were not simply the result of an umpire calling balls and strikes. Easy cases where the law is clear almost never make it to the Supreme Court. The great constitutional issues that the Supreme Court is called upon to decide require much more than the mechanical application of universally accepted legal principles. That is why Justices need great legal expertise, but they also need wisdom, they need judgment, they need to understand the impact of their decisions on the parties before them and the country around them, from New York City to small towns like Spooner, Wisconsin. And they need a deep appreciation of and dedication to equality, to liberty and to democracy. That is why I suggest to everyone watching today that they be a little wary of a phrase that they are hearing at this hearing: ``judicial activism.'' That term really seems to have lost all usefulness, particularly since so many rulings of the conservative majority on the Supreme Court can fairly be described as ``activist'' in their disregard for precedent and their willingness to ignore or override the intent of Congress. At this point, perhaps we should all accept that the best definition of a ``judicial activist'' is a judge who decides a case in a way you don't like. Each of the decisions I mentioned earlier was undoubtedly criticized by someone at the time it was issued, and maybe even today, as being ``judicial activism.'' Yet some of them are, as the judge well knows, among the most revered Supreme Court decisions in modern times. Mr. Chairman, every Senator is entitled to ask whatever questions he or she wants at these hearings and to look at whatever factors he or she finds significant in evaluating this nominee. I hope Judge Sotomayor will answer all questions as fully as possible. I'll have questions of my own on a range of issues. Certainly, with the two most recent Supreme Court nominations, Senators did ask tough questions and sought as much information from the nominees as we possibly could get. And I expect nothing less from my colleagues in these hearings. I am glad, however, that Judge Sotomayor will finally have an opportunity to answer some of the unsubstantiated charges that have been made against her. One attack that I find particularly shocking is the suggestion that she will be biased against some litigants because of her racial and ethnic heritage. This charge is not based on anything in her judicial record because there is absolutely nothing in the hundreds of opinions she has written to support it. That long record, which is obviously the most relevant evidence we have to evaluate her, demonstrates a cautious and careful approach to judging. Instead, a few lines from a 2001 speech, taken out of context, have prompted some to charge that she is a racist. I believe that no one who reads the whole Berkeley speech could honestly come to that conclusion. The speech is actually a remarkably thoughtful attempt to grapple with difficult issues not often discussed by judges: How does a judge's personal background and experiences affect her judging? And Judge Sotomayor concludes her speech by saying the following: ``I am reminded each day that I render decisions that affect people concretely and that I owe them constant and complete vigilance in checking my assumptions, presumptions and perspectives and ensuring that to the extent that my limited abilities and capabilities permit me, that I reevaluate them and change as circumstances and cases before me require.'' Mr. Chairman, these are the words of a thoughtful, humble, and self-aware judge striving to do her very best to administer impartial justice for all Americans, from New York City to Spooner, Wisconsin. It seems to me that is a quality we want in our judges. Judge Sotomayor is living proof that this country is moving in the right direction on the issue of race, that doors of opportunity are finally starting to open to all of our citizens. And I think that nomination will inspire countless children to study harder and dream higher, and that is something we should all celebrate. Let me again welcome and congratulate you. I look forward to further learning in these hearings whether you have the knowledge, the wisdom, the judgment, the integrity, and yes, the courage, to serve with distinction on our nation's highest court. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. Thank you very much. I will recognize Senator Kyl, the Deputy Republican Leader of the United States Senate. Senator Kyl. STATEMENT OF HON. JON KYL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA Senator Kyl. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would hope that every American is proud that a Hispanic woman has been nominated to sit on the Supreme Court. In fulfilling our advise and consent role, of course, we must evaluate Judge Sotomayor's fitness to serve on the merits, not on the basis of her ethnicity. With a background that creates a prima facie case for confirmation, the primary question I believe Judge Sotomayor must address in this hearing is her understanding of the role of an appellate judge. From what she has said, she appears to believe that her role is not constrained to objectively decide who wins based on the weight of the law, but rather who in her personal opinion, should win. The factors that will influence her decisions apparently include her gender and Latina heritage and foreign legal concepts that as she said, get her creative juices going. What is the traditional basis for judging in America? For 220 years, presidents and the Senate have focused on appointing and confirming judges and justices who are committed to putting aside their biases and prejudices and applying law to fairly and impartially resolve disputes between parties. This principle is universally recognized and shared by judges across the ideological spectrum. For instance, Judge Richard Paez of the Ninth Circuit with whom I disagree on a number of issues explained this in the same venue where, less than 24 hours earlier, Judge Sotomayor made her now-famous remarks about a wise Latina woman making better decisions than other judges. Judge Paez described the instructions that he gave to jurors who were about to hear a case. ``As jurors,'' he said, ``recognize that you might have some bias, or prejudice. Recognize that it exists, and determine whether you can control it so that you can judge the case fairly. Because if you cannot--if you cannot set aside those prejudices, biases and passions, then you should not sit on the case.'' And then Judge Paez said, ``The same principle applies to judges. We take an oath of office. At the federal level, it is a very interesting oath. It says, in part, that you promise or swear to do justice to both the poor and the rich. The first time I heard this oath, I was startled by its significance,'' he said. ``I have my oath hanging on the wall in the office to remind me of my obligations. And so, although I am a Latino judge and there is no question about that, I am viewed as a Latino judge. As I judge cases, I try to judge them fairly. I try to remain faithful to my oath.'' What Judge Paez said has been the standard for 220 years. It correctly describes the fundamental and proper role for a judge. Unfortunately, a very important person has decided it is time for change, time for a new kind of judge, one who will apply a different standard of judging, including employment of his or her empathy for one of the parties to the dispute. That person is President Obama, and the question before us is whether his first nominee to the Supreme Court follows his new model of judging or the traditional model articulated by Judge Paez. President Obama, in opposing the nomination of Chief Justice Roberts said that ``while adherence to legal precedent and rules of statutory or constitutional construction will dispose of 95 percent of the cases that come before a court, what matters on the Supreme Court is those 5 percent of cases that are truly difficult. In those 5 percent of hard cases, the constitutional text will not be directly on point. The language of the statute will not be perfectly clear. Legal process alone will not lead you to a rule of decision.'' How does President Obama propose judges deal with these hard cases? Does he want them to use judicial precedent, canons of construction, and other accepted tools of interpretation that judges have used for centuries? No, President Obama says that ``in those difficult cases, the critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge's heart.'' Of course, every person should have empathy, and in certain situations, such as sentencing, it may not be wrong for judges to be empathetic. The problem arises when empathy and other biases or prejudices that are in the judge's heart become the critical ingredient to deciding cases. As Judge Paez explained, a judge's prejudices, biases, and passions should not be embraced, they must be set aside so that a judge can render an impartial decision as required by the judicial oath and as parties before the court expect. I respectfully submit that President Obama is simply outside the mainstream in his statements about how judges should decide cases. I practiced law for almost 20 years before every level of state and federal court, including the U.S. Supreme Court, and never once did I hear a lawyer argue that he had no legal basis to sustain his client's position, so that he had to ask the judge to go with his gut or his heart. If judges routinely started ruling on the basis of their personal feelings, however well-intentioned, the entire legitimacy of the judicial system would be jeopardized. The question for this committee is whether Judge Sotomayor agrees with President Obama's theory of judging or whether she will faithfully interpret the laws and Constitution and take seriously the oath of her prospective office. Many of Judge Sotomayor's public statements suggest that she may, indeed, allow, and even embrace, decision-making based on her biases and prejudices. The wise Latina woman quote, which I referred to earlier, suggests that Judge Sotomayor endorses the view that a judge should allow gender, ethnic and experience-based biases to guide her when rendering judicial opinions. This is in stark contrast to Judge Paez's view that these factors should be set aside. In the same lecture, Judge Sotomayor posits that ``there is no objective stance but only a series of perspectives. No neutrality, no escape from choice in judging'' and claims that ``the aspiration to impartiality is just that. It's an aspiration,'' she says, ``because it denies the fact that we are by our experiences making different choices than others.'' No neutrality, no impartiality in judging? Yet isn't that what the judicial oath explicitly requires? Judge Sotomayor. clearly rejected the notion that judges should strive for an impartial brand of justice. She has already accepted that her gender and Latina heritage will affect the outcome of her cases. This is a serious issue, and it's not the only indication that Judge Sotomayor has an expansive view of what a judge may appropriately consider. In a speech to the Puerto Rican ACLU, Judge Sotomayor endorsed the idea that American judges should use good ideas found in foreign law so that America does not lose influence in the world. The laws and practices of foreign nations are simply irrelevant to interpreting the will of the American people as expressed through our Constitution. Addit"
