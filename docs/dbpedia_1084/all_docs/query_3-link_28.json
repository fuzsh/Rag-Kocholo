        "text": "I was born in Louisville, KY to Mary Margaret (Aldridge) Meyer and Dr. Dexter Meyer, JR. I was preceded in death by my parents, who lived to the ripe old age of 98 and 102, by my brother-in-law, Robert Owens, and my mother-in-law, Esther B. Sheehy. I died at home in Baileys Harbor, WI. After a friend asked me recently about my life, I began reflecting on what a rich life I have had, full of surprises, twists and turns. Several things stick out as life changing events. First, I grew up in the Christian Church, Disciples of Christ, from the time I was a baby. That gave me not only my faith foundation but provided me with space for much questioning and reflection. I spent many years attending Madison Ave. Christian Church in Covington, KY, and loved and cherished my many close friends there. From the time I was born until the 8th grade, our family moved 12 times in 12 years, many moves due to life’s unplanned circumstances. Those different experiences, with different people, different ways of life, different schools turned out to be invaluable in my growth and maturity. It made me adaptable and resilient. I learned to make friends quickly, and even though I might be the odd person out, I could survive and learn from the experience. In the 1950’s, our family settled in Northern KY where I attended Dixie Heights High School, Edgewood KY, University of Cincinnati, where I studied Interior Design, and the University of Kentucky, where I studied Fine Arts. After college, I worked in various interior design studios in Kentucky and Cincinnati. In 1969, a camping trip across country from the Apollo 11 moon shot in Cape Canaveral to an adventurous trip up the Alcan Highway, ended in Anchorage, Alaska. With a broken down car and no money, it prompted a stay. Anchorage had experienced a devastating earthquake shortly before my arrival and the town had no need for Interior Designers. As luck would have it, I was eventually able to get a job with the Anchorage Daily News. By a twist of fate, I was asked to become one of their photojournalist. With little previous photographic experience, I suddenly became a photographer and continued as a freelance photographer journalist for numerous years after leaving Anchorage. I continued to love photography long after I wasn’t doing it professionally. It was another one of those gifts you get in life when you aren’t expecting it. I learned you have to accept the challenge and enjoy it. In late 1977, after moving back to Northern Kentucky, I opened an Interior Design studio in downtown Covington, KY. I practiced there for over 23 years. Again, I had no experience or knowledge of running a business, but with the help and support of many close associates and incredible repeating clients, we were able to make it happen. We all worked hard (and laughed a lot) to make it a success. This was another gift that was dropped in my lap when I wasn’t expecting it. The best piece of advice I got was, “What do you have to lose? You can always close if it doesn’t work out.” We never had to do that. On October 31, 1985, I married my wonderful architect husband, and partner in life, Daniel Robert Sheehy. We were married in Door County, WI on a beautiful rock outcrop on the shores of Lake Michigan. In 1995, Dan joined the business, and we became an Architecture and Interior Design firm. We moved our business from Covington, KY to Ft. Thomas, KY in 2000 and practiced there for another 17 years before completely retiring in 2017. Dan and I pursued our passion of designing, building, and renovating. Starting with a spur of the moment decision to purchase an untamed piece of property, in beautiful Baileys Harbor. We molded it into a place that we have loved for 38 years. It is our place of joy and peace. Several years later, we purchased and renovated a small home in Bokeelia, Florida, on Pine Island, FL. It was another adventure and something we loved doing. We designed, built, renovated and maintained throughout our time together. Both were gifts we were not expecting, but it has brought us joy for many years. I was a homebody and an avid daydreamer. I loved sitting on our back deck staring into the woods, watching the birds flutter and the butterflies flitter. I loved painting, and it became an important part of my life. I loved all the delicious meals with neighbors and friends sipping wine, laughing and telling use-to stories about all the things we use-to be able to do. It has been a contented life. Dan and I have been so lucky to have many incredible and full of love friends and family in our lives. They surrounded us with comfort, support and so much kindness. Just know that we love you very much and you have made our lives, and this life transition, a happy and peaceful one for both of us. We will never be able to thank you enough for your compassion and caring. I leave behind my wonderful, caring husband, Dan Sheehy, my very beloved siblings, Dexter Meyer, III, Nancy (Steve) Kingsley, Joellen Owens (Dennis Helton), my vivacious sister-in-law, Lisa (Jim) Firlan, my cherished nieces and nephews, to whom I am known as Crazy Aunt Linda, Cadie (Brennan) Sweeney, Kyle (Josh) Warning, Carrie (Tim) Powers, Sarah Kingsley, and the beautiful, incredible, smart great-nieces and nephews, Mason and Brooklin Sweeney, Kendal and Claire Powers, and Salvatore Nassano. As a final reflection, I am reminded that the ultimate goal is to celebrate life every day and to cherish every one who comes into your life. Embrace those opportunities that fall in your lap and run with them. The rewards will be exciting and often unexpected. And remember to smile and laugh. It will certainly brighten your every day. A special thanks to the wonderful folks on the hospice team at Unity Hospice. They were with us every step of the way to guide us through this process. To Dr. Josh Rebhan, Dr. Daniel Hanley and Dr. Faith Gardner for all their care and guidance. Also, to Huehns Funeral Home who were so kind and helpful in making our final plans.
