        "text": "Top 5 Conference USA Breakout Candidates (Special Teams)\n\nP Grant Chadwick, Middle Tennessee (Freshman)\n\nIt’s rare for a punter to be a three-star recruit, and it’s equally rare for a freshman punter to see the field, but the Raiders have to feel good about landing the signature of Chadwick, a 6’4” athlete who was ranked the #8 punter in the country by 247Sports and #11 according to Kohl’s Kicking.\n\nChadwick is from Tullahoma, Tennessee, about an hour south of MTSU’s campus, and averaged 42 yards per punt his final two years of high school.\n\n2. K Connor Brooksby, New Mexico State (Senior)\n\nLanding a kicker in the portal was a priority for new Aggies coach Tony Sanchez, and Brooksby, a left-footed kicker who was an all-conference pick at the FCS level, will be expected to be the starter for NMSU after transferring in from Utah Tech. Brooksby converted 40-of-58 field goals and 81-of-84 PAT attempts in his tenure with the Trailblazers.\n\n3. K Colin Karhu, Liberty (Senior)\n\nIs Karhu the answer to Liberty’s special teams woes? The Flames’ returning starter, Nick Brown, converted only half of his attempts last fall, and Karhu has converted 32 of 41 career field goals during three seasons at Division II North Greenville.\n\n4. P Adam Jacklin, UTEP (Redshirt Freshman)\n\nOne of many punters to make the long trek to the States from Australia, the 5’11”, 195-pound Jacklin punted nine times in four games at North Texas last season, preserving his redshirt and averaging just under 39 yards per punt. After the season, he decided to hit the transfer portal and found a new home with the Miners.\n\nJacklin grew up playing Aussie rules football, has a pilot’s license and ran his own music festival in Australia.\n\n5. P Riley Stephens, Western Kentucky (Senior)\n\nStephens is a dual-threat punter and kickoff specialist who transferred into WKU from FCS program Austin Peay. He averaged just over 42 yards per boot and pinned 17 of 58 punts inside the opponent’s 20-yard line. The Hilltoppers are sure to appreciate his versatility.\n\nTop 10 Conference USA Breakout Candidates (Defense)\n\n1. DT Cole Gustafson, Florida International (Junior)\n\nFIU is placing a much bigger emphasis on rushing the passer in 2024, and Gustafson can do that, and then some. The junior college transfer from suburban Sacramento exploded for 32 tackles as a sophomore after recording only two as a freshman, so if he can make a similar leap to the FBS level with the Panthers, it would certainly help the cause. Coaches were encouraged by the 310-pounder’s performance in spring ball, penciling him in for a starting role.\n\n2. CB Jhamal Shelby Jr., Louisiana Tech (Redshirt Sophomore)\n\nShelby wasn’t a full-time starter last season, but he was very solid in limited action for LA Tech and showed a knack for the big play, forcing a fumble in a loss to Nebraska and recording his first career interception in an early-season win over Northwestern State. That’s key for a unit that’s hoping to force more turnovers under new defensive coordinator Jeremiah Johnson.\n\n3. DB Virgil Marshall, Western Kentucky (Redshirt Junior)\n\nMarshall started seven out of 12 games for WKU in 2023 while playing the Star position, similar to a nickelback. The native of Cocoa, Florida had 24 tackles, one interception and broke up two passes last year and he looked even better recently, picking off another pass in the Hilltoppers’ spring scrimmage.\n\n4. LB Jibreel Al-Amin, Jacksonville State (Redshirt Sophomore)\n\nAl-Amin will likely step into a starting role after a promising redshirt freshman season (15 tackles, one sack, plus several appearances on special teams). He’ll also be learning a new scheme under new Jax State defensive coordinator Luke Olsen. Originally from Chantilly, Virginia, Al-Amin chose the Gamecocks over an offer from Marshall.\n\n5. DT James Stewart, Middle Tennessee (Redshirt Junior)\n\nStewart only started in one game last season, but he’s a holdover from the previous MTSU coaching staff that new coach Derek Mason and defensive coordinator Brian Stewart (no relation) like. James Stewart has the flexibility to play either as a defensive end or defensive tackle and averaged about 27 snaps per game last year.\n\n6. S Tayden Barnes, New Mexico State (Redshirt Freshman)\n\nBarnes immediately stood out during the spring as a young talent who competed with an infusion of transfers in the secondary as the Aggies broke in a new scheme under coordinator Joe Morris.\n\nBarnes was a three-star recruit from Amarillo, Texas who redshirted last fall as NMSU made a stunning run to the Conference USA championship game. After being recruited by Jerry Kill and his previous staff, Barnes stuck around under new head coach Tony Sanchez.\n\n7. CB Dexter Ricks Jr., Liberty (Redshirt Sophomore)\n\nA former three-star recruit from Milledgeville, Georgia, Ricks was a rotational player for Liberty last fall, collecting 11 tackles and one pass breakup off the bench. He’ll take on a bigger role in ‘24 after the Flames’ best corner, Kobe Singleton, transferred to Oregon State…is he ready?\n\n8. LB Nate Dyman, UTEP (Redshirt Junior)\n\nDyman, a junior college transfer, arrived in El Paso last fall and redshirted after a four-game audition. Then coach Dana Dimel got fired following a 3-9 campaign and almost half the Miners’ roster transferred.\n\nBut Dyman stuck around and made a good impression on the new coaching staff, picking off a pass in the first spring scrimmage. “It feels great, having a good opportunity,” he said. “Everybody is new, so we all have an opportunity to fight for a spot. We’re getting better together.”\n\n9. S Sidney Porter, Kennesaw State (Redshirt Junior)\n\nThis junior safety should jump off the film when the Owls make their FBS debut this fall. Safe to say that Porter is ready for the spotlight: he picked off two passes in five games last season and also posted an 11-tackle game against Sam Houston.\n\n10. S Rickey Smith, Middle Tennessee (Redshirt Junior)\n\nThe Blue Raiders suffered a number of transfer portal losses to their secondary in the offseason, but Smith, a returning player, was identified as a key talent in the spring. The Orlando native signed with Purdue out of high school and transferred to Middle Tennessee under the previous coaching staff.\n\nLook for him to team up with veterans Marvae Myers, Chris Johnson and Brendon Harris at safety, and he’ll likely benefit from his position coach, Bryce Lewis, who was mentored by new Middle Tennessee head coach Derek Mason at Vanderbilt.\n\nHONORABLE MENTION:\n\nLB Quincy Davis, New Mexico State (Redshirt Freshman)\n\nDavis redshirted last year as he added muscle to his 6’2” frame, but the inside ‘backer is ready to make an impact for the Aggies as they look to maintain their standard of defense under NMSU DC Joe Morris. Davis played at the vaunted Bishop Gorman High program in Las Vegas, hence his connection to new NMSU coach Tony Sanchez, who went 85-5 during his own stint coaching Gorman.\n\nDE Kendrick DeJour, Sam Houston (Redshirt Sophomore)\n\nDuJour is an intriguing pass-rusher at 6’5”, 225 pounds, and he joined the Bearkats in the summer after posting eight tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks at FCS program North Carolina Central last season. He’s still raw by Conference USA standards, but DuJour could find a role in some third-down packages under new coordinator Skyler Cassity.\n\nDB Kory Chapman, UTEP (Senior)\n\nChapman is one of 11 Austin Peay transfers that followed Scotty Walden and his staff to El Paso in the offseason. He’ll likely play the Spur position for UTEP (similar to a nickelback).\n\nNot only does Chapman have 33 games of experience under his belt already, he was highly productive at the FCS level, collecting 179 career tackles, 15 tackles for loss, 14 pass breakups and five interceptions for the Governors.\n\nCB Geimere Latimer, Jacksonville State (Sophomore)\n\nLatimer was impressive enough to see the field immediately in 2023 for the Gamecocks and even started the final two games of the year. He’s not big (5’10”, 182), but Latimer has a nose for the football, as evidenced by his 10 tackles, one forced fumble and one interception last season.\n\nA converted quarterback, Latimer prepped at Sandy Creek High School, the alma mater of NFL Hall of Famer Calvin Johnson.\n\nDT Christian Davis, Louisiana Tech (Redshirt Freshman)\n\nThe Bulldogs are facing a dilemma at defensive tackle, with limited experience returning at that position for a team that wasn’t great at stopping the run to begin with. Louisiana Tech did sign junior college transfers Trevell Vivians and Adam Lamar, but they will need time to develop and adjust to a higher level of competition. The depth situation got worse when Keenan Landry transferred out in the spring.\n\nBut Davis, a Ruston native who spent a year redshirting at FCS Northwestern State, came back to his hometown in order to compete for a job with the Bulldogs. The 300-pounder could find his way onto the field sooner rather than later.\n\nTop 10 Conference USA Breakout Candidates (Offense)\n\nNote: Much like I did last year for NMSU and its opponents, I’ve identified 10 breakout players for these teams on offense and defense heading into the fall season, plus some honorable mentions. Last year some of my predictions were spot on, and some weren’t — and that’s part of the fun!\n\nQB Zion Turner, Jacksonville State (Redshirt Sophomore)\n\nHe’s historically had turnover issues, throwing 10 interceptions against nine TDs as his UConn Huskies went on a surprising bowl run in 2022, his true freshman season. But Turner is an athletic dual-threat QB, the kind that Jax State head coach Rich Rodriguez covets.\n\nTurner will have three seasons of eligibility left and his spring practice was encouraging enough to temporarily place him as the starter ahead of senior Logan Smothers, who accounted for 13 total TDs as a part-time starter last year. As usual, RichRod is OK with rotating both QBs if needed.\n\n2. WR Tyson Mobley, Liberty (Grad Student)\n\nMobley transferred in from Coastal Carolina, where the Florida native reunites with current Liberty coach Jamey Chadwell. While he didn’t dominate at Coastal (55 career catches), he did land an honorable mention all-Sun Belt selection in 2022 and more recently, showed yards-after-catch ability with a nice TD catch-and-run in Liberty’s spring game.\n\n3. WR Abdul-Fatai Ibrahim, Louisiana Tech (Senior)\n\nIbrahim will be on school number three after a solid stint at Alabama A&M (31 career games) and the 2023 season at Bowling Green (13 games). He was earning rave reviews in spring practice and will likely be a key cog in a Louisiana Tech passing game that needs to replace its top four receivers.\n\n“Don’t watch his catches, don’t watch his route running; go watch him block. He is a savage on the perimeter, and I mean a savage,” said his former coach, Bowling Green’s Scot Loeffler. “He’s an old-school wide receiver is what he is. He can run, he can catch, and he is tough as nails…I love tough wide receivers on the perimeter.”\n\n4. QB Jack Turner, Louisiana Tech (Redshirt Junior)\n\nTurner didn’t exactly light the world on fire in limited action last fall, passing for 1,017 yards, five touchdowns and five interceptions. But he retained his starting QB job in the spring despite a challenge from junior college All-American Ty Keyes, and head coach Sonny Cumbie expressed confidence in Turner heading forward.\n\n5. WR Desna Washington, Florida International (Redshirt Senior)\n\nThe 6’5” Washington showed flashes of brilliance at New Mexico in 2023 (29 catches, 336 yards, three TDs) and now returns to his home state. Before UNM, Washington also posted 107 catches during his JUCO career at Iowa Central Community College.\n\n6. RB Jekail Middlebrook, Middle Tennessee (Redshirt Freshman)\n\nMiddlebrook got his feet wet last season, showing solid athletic ability despite his small stature (5’9”). In a four-game audition, Middlebrook rushed 18 times for 85 yards and caught four passes for 31 yards, scoring two rushing TDs, both in a blowout win over Murray State. He comes from the decorated Langston Hughes High program in suburban Atlanta.\n\n7. WR Demarcus Lacey, Jacksonville State (Junior)\n\nThis North Alabama transfer is a versatile weapon for Jax State, a team that’s in need of new receiving targets to emerge. Last season, he recorded 801 all-purpose yards (589 rushing, 212 receiving) and averaged over 16 yards per catch in his career with the Lions. Look for the Gamecocks to find creative ways to get him touches.\n\n8. WR Donovan Faupel, New Mexico State (Sophomore)\n\nFaupel was too good to keep off the field in 2023 as a true freshman, learning on the job behind now-departed playmakers like Trent Hudson and Jonathan Brady. Faupel caught eight passes last year and had an encouraging spring.\n\n9. OT Jacob Kettles, Kennesaw State (Redshirt Junior)\n\nKettles will have two years of eligibility left after transferring in from Montana State, the powerhouse FCS program, and he was good enough to exit the spring penciled in as a starter on the Owls’ O-line. He’s originally from Lynden, Washington, a small town about six miles from the border with Canada.\n\n10. WR Qua-Vez Humphreys, Sam Houston (Redshirt Junior)\n\nHumphreys is extra motivated to make an impact for the Bearkats’ offense after a broken foot ruined his 2023 season before it even started. The Junction City, Kansas native has a 6’3” frame and averaged over 15 yards per catch during his two seasons at Butler Community College.\n\nHONORABLE MENTION:\n\nWR Latrell Neville, New Mexico State (Redshirt Junior)\n\nNeville didn’t play much at Jones County Junior College in Mississippi last season (11 catches, 109 yards, one TD), but he signed with Nebraska out of high school and could be a weapon for NMSU in 2024. Fun fact: Neville is a grandson of legendary blues singer Aaron Neville.\n\nRB Corey Wren, UTEP (Redshirt Junior)\n\nWren has track-star speed – literally. He once ran a 10.41 time in the 100-meters in high school at John Curtis Christian, setting a Louisiana state record. He originally signed with Florida State in the class of 2020, but barely played and subsequently transferred to TCU (where he also barely played).\n\nWith that said, Scotty Walden’s new offense at UTEP is designed to get speedy playmakers in space with lots of quick passes, so an all-purpose player like Wren could thrive in El Paso despite his lack of size (5’10”, 195). He was a key addition for UTEP in the post-spring transfer portal window and will tag-team with Kam Thomas at the “Miner-Back” position (a hybrid running back/slot receiver).\n\nOT D.J. Geth, Liberty (Redshirt Freshman)\n\nGeth transferred to Liberty after redshirting at UNC in the fall of 2023. A former three-star recruit, he’s the son of Ed Geth, who was on the Tar Heels’ 1993 national championship basketball team and later spent several years playing internationally. The younger Geth can play a couple of different positions on the line and should be a key depth piece.\n\nOG Daniel Keys, Louisiana Tech (Senior)\n\nNathan Young, Louisiana Tech’s co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach, previously worked at Stephen F. Austin, so he was able to poach some talent from the Lumberjacks’ roster in the portal, including Keys, who was born in New Orleans and went to high school in Houston. He can play either guard or tackle and boasts 37 games of experience under his belt.\n\nWR Josh Evans, Middle Tennessee (Freshman)\n\nA 6’2” true freshman, Evans was the only high school receiver that the Blue Raiders signed, and he got a head start by enrolling early in time for spring practice. The Orlando native caught 88 career passes for 1,294 yards and 13 scores at Olympia High.\n\nKnow the Foe: Fresno State Bulldogs\n\nLOCATION: Fresno, California (population 541,107)\n\nCONFERENCE: Mountain West Conference\n\n2023 RECORD: 9-4, 4-4 in MWC\n\n2024 PREDICTION: 4th\n\nHEAD COACH: Jeff Tedford, 6th season\n\nCalifornia, 2002-12 (82-57)\n\nFresno State, 2017-19, 2022-present (45-22)\n\nSTADIUM: Jim Sweeney Field @ Valley Children’s Stadium (opened 1980, capacity 40,727)\n\n2023 RESULTS\n\nW, 39-35 @ Purdue\n\nW, 34-31 (OT) vs Eastern Washington (FCS)\n\nW, 29-0 @ Arizona State\n\nW, 53-10 vs Kent State\n\nW, 27-9 vs Nevada\n\nL, 19-24 @ Wyoming\n\nW, 37-32 @ Utah State\n\nW, 31-24 vs UNLV\n\nW, 37-30 vs Boise State\n\nL, 18-42 @ San José State\n\nL, 17-25 vs New Mexico\n\nL, 18-33 @ San Diego State\n\nW, 37-10 vs New Mexico State (Isleta New Mexico Bowl)\n\n2024 SCHEDULE\n\nAug. 31 @ Michigan\n\nSept. 7 vs Sacramento State (FCS)\n\nSept. 14 vs New Mexico State\n\nSept. 21 @ New Mexico\n\nSept. 28 @ UNLV\n\nOct. 12 vs Washington State\n\nOct. 19 @ Nevada\n\nOct. 26 @ San José State\n\nNov. 2 vs Hawai’i\n\nNov. 9 @ Air Force\n\nNov. 23 vs Colorado State\n\nNov. 30 @ UCLA\n\nBold indicates MW game.\n\nKey MW game: Air Force (Nov. 9th)\n\nA spot in the Mountain West championship might be on the line in this November matchup, the last road contest for Fresno State this fall.

He might finally be ready to break out after recording a modest 25 tackles, 2.5 sacks and one interception in his Trojans career.\n\nWR Jordan Malau’ulu (Freshman)\n\nThis slot receiver graduated from powerhouse Long Beach Poly and chose to enroll early at Fresno State after spending time with his family in American Samoa for signing day festivities in December. “He’s high energy all the time…He’s a superstar athlete and he embraces and accepts everybody,” said his coach, Stephen Barbee.\n\n2024 Preview – Offense\n\nThe Bulldogs should be well-positioned to equal last year’s 30.4 points-per game average, and the optimism starts with the one-two punch of quarterback Mikey Keene (2,976 passing yards, 24 TDs, 10 INTs) and running back Malik Sherrod (966 yards, nine TDs).\n\nKeene is prioritizing cutting down on those 10 picks in 2024.\n\n“Can’t put the ball in jeopardy. We need to give ourselves a shot at ending very drive with a kick, whether it’s a field goal, PAT, or a punt. Working on that, trying to get that completion rate up, and just letting my playmakers make plays,” he said in the spring.\n\nMore depth is needed behind both Keene and Sherrod—Keene’s leading backup, Logan Fife, transferred to Montana, while backup tailback Elijah Gilliam rushed for only 397 yards—but the Bulldogs know what they have in their two veterans.\n\nFresno State has some solid athletes at receiver, including Jalen Moss, a Bay Area product who caught 55 passes last season, and senior Mac Dalena (47 catches, 509 yards, three scores). More depth is needed here as well, although junior Josiah Freeman and JUCO transfer Karim McCune could be candidates to emerge.\n\nIdaho State transfer Chadron James (an FCS All-American) and Missouri State transfer Raylen Sharpe were late additions in the spring portal window and could make an impact if they can adjust to the FBS level quickly.\n\nThree senior starters (Mose Vavao, Osmar Velez and Jacob Spomer) return to what could be one of the Mountain West’s best lines, although the unit will have a new position coach after Brian Armstrong left for Nevada. Former Bulldog center Matt Smith was promoted from within and will lead his old group.\n\n2024 Preview – Defense\n\nFresno State’s takeaway-heavy defense helped them finish top 20 nationally in turnover margin, but veteran coordinator Kevin Coyle still needs to replace several playmakers, including linebacker Levelle Bailey, cornerback Carlton Johnson and nickel Morice Norris Jr.\n\nNew front seven leaders include senior linebacker Malachi Langley (84 tackles, five tackles for loss), junior defensive tackle Gavriel Lightfoot (20 tackles, three QB hurries) and senior defensive end Devo Bridges (eight TFLs, seven QB hurries and 3.5 sacks). Coaches can’t wait to see USC transfer Korey Foreman, a former five-star recruit.\n\nUndersized Phoenix Jackson looks ready to step into a bigger role at linebacker alongside Langley after an encouraging sophomore campaign (33 tackles in 12 games off the bench). The Bulldogs are also excited to bring back veteran cornerback Cam Lockridge, who was injured after four games last fall and earned a redshirt. In 2022, his first year with Fresno after transferring in from Hawai’i, Lockridge had a team-high four picks, so the hope is that he’ll return to form with a clean bill of health.\n\nSenior Camryn Bracha (38 tackles), JUCO transfer Jakari Embry and sophomore Al’zillion Hamilton (two INTs, eight pass breakups) will also be competing for playing time.\n\nThere’s some questions at safety beyond the consistent Dean Clark (three INTs). Kosi Agina, Jayden Davis, Jomarion Briggs and Julian Neal all have some experience, but none have been regular starters. Arizona State transfer R.J. Regan arrives in the fall.\n\n2024 Preview – Special Teams\n\nLeft-footed junior Dylan Lynch went 24-of-30 on field goals for the Bulldogs in 2023, including a season-long 52-yarder in the upset win over Purdue. There were two punters on the spring roster: senior Landon Ogles, who didn’t play last year, and Old Dominion transfer Nick Verdugo. Aussie punter Clayton Lawrence arrived in June and should compete as well.\n\nSummary\n\nFresno State had another solid 9-4 season in 2023, but will be searching for some more stability as they try to challenge in what could be a wide-open Mountain West conference race. On paper, there’s a lot to like here, with Keene, Sherrod, Bridges and Lockridge among a slew of experienced playmakers returning. The Bulldogs lost fairly few players to the portal compared to their Mountain West peers, and the two-deep is littered with upperclassmen.\n\nWith that said, Fresno State significantly cooled off after roaring out to an 8-1 start that included Power Five upsets over Purdue and Arizona State. The Bulldogs suffered head-scratching defeats to San José State, New Mexico and San Diego State before rebounding with a bowl win over New Mexico State, but head coach Jeff Tedford had to miss that game due to undisclosed health issues. If the Bulldogs can be more consistent, they can still contend in the Mountain West.\n\nKnow the Foe: New Mexico Lobos\n\nLOCATION: Albuquerque, New Mexico (population 564,559)\n\nCONFERENCE: Mountain West\n\n2023 RECORD: 4-8, 2-6 in MW\n\n2024 PREDICTION: 12th\n\nHEAD COACH: Bronco Mendenhall, 1st season\n\nBYU, 2005-15 (99-43)\n\nVirginia, 2016-21 (36-38)\n\nNew Mexico, 2024-present\n\nSTADIUM: Turner & Margaret Branch Field @ University Stadium (opened 1960, capacity 39,224)\n\n2023 RESULTS\n\nL, 10-52 @ Texas A&M\n\nW, 56-10 vs Tennessee Tech (FCS)\n\nL, 17-27 vs New Mexico State\n\nW, 34-31 (OT) vs Massachusetts\n\nL, 26-32 @ Wyoming\n\nL, 24-52 vs San José State\n\nW, 42-21 vs Hawai’i\n\nL, 24-34 @ Nevada\n\nL, 14-56 vs UNLV\n\nL, 14-42 @ Boise State\n\nW, 25-17 @ Fresno State\n\nL, 41-44 (OT) vs Utah State\n\n2024 SCHEDULE\n\nAug. 24 vs Montana State (FCS)\n\nAug. 31 @ Arizona\n\nSept. 14 @ Auburn\n\nSept. 21 vs Fresno State\n\nSept. 28 @ New Mexico State\n\nOct. 12 vs Air Force\n\nOct. 19 @ Utah State\n\nOct. 26 @ Colorado State\n\nNov. 2 vs Wyoming\n\nNov. 9 @ San Diego State\n\nNov. 16 vs Washington State\n\nNov. 30 @ Hawai’i\n\nBold indicates MW game.\n\nKey Mtn.

He passed for 525 yards and rushed for 328, scoring a combined 10 touchdowns. During spring practice, new coach Bronco Mendenhall said that Dampier had done enough to tentatively hold the starting job.\n\nWR Caleb Medford (Senior)\n\nThe TCU transfer added some outstanding athleticism to UNM’s receiving corps last season, snagging 30 passes and averaging 18.4 yards per grab with a pair of touchdowns.\n\nS Christian Ellis (Junior)\n\nThe Jacksonville product returned to UNM after initially entering the transfer portal. He’s the team’s leading returning tackler with 58 and also broke up four passes.\n\nTHREE KEY LOSSES\n\nRB JaCorey Croskey-Merritt (transferred to Ole Miss)\n\nIn his first season as a transfer from FCS Alabama State, Croskey-Merritt rushed for 17 TDs at UNM, ranking second on the all-time single-season list. After initially considering Arizona, he instead chose to transfer to Ole Miss.\n\nQB Dylan Hopkins (graduated)\n\nAn offense that desperately needed a shot in the arm got one with Hopkins, an experienced UAB grad transfer who made the Lobos’ offense competitive. He passed for 2,074 yards, 11 touchdowns and nine interceptions last year.\n\nS Jer’marius Lewis (transferred to UTSA)\n\nLewis played two seasons with the Lobos, recording 45 stops in 2023 and leading the team with three interceptions. He transferred to the UTSA Roadrunners after the previous staff was dismissed.\n\nTHREE KEY ADDITIONS\n\nRB Eli Sanders (Redshirt Junior)\n\nThe Iowa State transfer posted 703 rushing yards and 135 receiving yards in three seasons with the Cyclones and will arrive at UNM hoping to lead a young running back group.\n\nWR Shawn Miller (Redshirt Sophomore)\n\nMiller was a receiver who was singled out by the new coaching staff as having a solid spring, taking advantage of a clean slate after struggling with injuries at Illinois. A three-star recruit who finished his prep career at the famous IMG Academy, Miller has Southwest roots (he grew up with Lobo QB Devon Dampier in Scottsdale, Arizona)\n\nLB Moso Tuitele (Redshirt Sophomore)\n\nTuitele is a raw athlete with high upside; a former three-star recruit out of Colorado, he signed with Cal, but never played and later switched from tight end to linebacker, a position where the Lobos are very shy on depth at the moment. He’s the nephew of former UNM offensive line coach Saga Tuitele (now at Arizona State).\n\n2024 Preview – Offense\n\nAfter years of being one of the nation’s worst offenses, the Lobos showed signs of life in 2023, finishing 44th nationally in total offense behind a strong running game, but head coach Danny Gonzales was still dismissed.\n\nBronco Mendenhall—a former UNM assistant prior to his national rise to fame as the head coach at BYU and Virginia—takes over, and he brought onboard longtime assistant Jason Beck to run the offense in Albuquerque. Beck was most recently the OC at Syracuse.\n\nIt’s expected to be a three-way race for the quarterback position, with a starter penciled in, although nothing is set in stone.\n\nSophomore Devon Dampier got his feet wet as a true freshman and showed promise—passing for 525 yards and six touchdowns and zero interceptions while rushing for 328 yards and four more scores.\n\nJustin Holaday has some limited experience (three starts in 2022) and looked improved in the spring, while BYU grad transfer Sol-Jay Maiava is another intriguing addition. He has only one career start to his name, but ironically enough, it was an MVP performance in Albuquerque at the 2022 New Mexico Bowl, in which BYU defeated SMU. After being moved to running back the following spring, Maiava hit the portal and landed with UNM.\n\nAs of press time, Mendenhall had seen enough from Dampier to tentatively name him the starter in spring practice.\n\nAt running back, Jacory Croskey-Merritt led the Mountain West with 1,190 yards rushing and 17 total TDs, but he’s gone. Backup Andrew Henry (350 yards, 3 TDs) returned after originally entering the transfer portal, while Iowa State transfer Eli Sanders and Arizona State transfer Javen Jacobs joined the mix in the spring. If the spring game was any indication, it’ll likely be a by-committee approach.\n\n“I want to be a part of a good team and I don’t want to go nowhere where it’s nonchalant and we just do what we want to do,” Henry said, while speaking positively about the new staff’s approach. “I wanted somewhere with discipline and standard.”\n\nVeterans Caleb Medford and Luke Wysong lead a Lobo receiving corps that’s shy on depth and production. The duo combined for 37 catches, 661 yards and three scores last season, and Wysong is healthy again after being limited to four games. Illinois transfer Shawn Miller is an underrated talent from the recruiting class who could help out, and he had a great spring, according to coaches.\n\nSyracuse transfer Isaiah Jones is a 6’4″ target if he’s healthy, which hasn’t been often. Slot receiver Ryan Davis had 21 catches last fall after transferring in from UAB. Nic Trujillo and Evan Wysong (Luke’s younger brother) are raw talents who might blossom under new position coach Micah Simon.\n\nSimilarly, the offensive line is mostly new faces and will be a blank slate for new OL coach Famika Anae. Isaiah Sillemon, Jer’Marques Bailey and Travis Gray have starting experience, while East Carolina transfer Richard Pearce and Florida Atlantic transfer Wallace Unamba both tip the scales at over 320 pounds.\n\nTwo of Anae’s players at Campbell came to Albuquerque with him: veteran guard Baraka Beckett and redshirt freshman tackle Elvin Harris. Don’t be shocked if the entire starting five is composed of transfers.\n\n2024 Preview – Defense\n\nThe Lobos gave up 35 points per game and recorded a paltry 15 sacks and four interceptions as a team in 2023. Veteran BYU and UVa coordinator Nick Howell will tackle this reclamation project in 2023, reuniting with Mendenhall after two years at Vanderbilt. He has several returning starters, plus 13 new transfers.\n\nLeading returning tackler Christian Ellis (59) returns at safety after flirting with the transfer portal, but the Lobos have major depth issues at linebacker. Senior Dimitri Johnson made 48 stops in his first season as a Lobo, and Mihalis Santorineos is a capable ‘backer who posted 20 tackles in his first season after transferring in from junior college. The two of them were high school teammates in Rohnert Park, California and Santorineos was born in Greece, moving to the US as a teen.\n\nElsewhere, the two-deep is precariously thin. Cal transfer Moso Tuitele has a 6’4″, 250-pound frame and was a three-star kid out of high school in Colorado, but the converted tight end is still raw. Jayden Wilson and Hunter Haemker have mostly special teams experience on their résumés. Look for more portal additions here.\n\nCornerback also looked thin in the offseason, but San Diego State transfer Noah Avinger (25 career appearances, eight starts) is a key addition through the portal and wowed his new teammates with his physicality in the spring. Tavian Combs is an experienced safety who has a clean bill of health this year and will set the tone alongside Ellis.\n\nThe Lobos need more out of a D-line that didn’t produce much in 2023. Veterans Kyler Drake and Gabriel Lopez return on the edges after combining for 10 tackles for loss and 5.5 sacks last season. Weber State grad transfer Okiki Olorunfunmi signed in December, while USC transfer De’jon Benton and Old Dominion transfer Devin Brandt might be the unit’s most experienced players.\n\n2024 Preview – Special Teams\n\nNew special teams coordinator Shane Hunter, most recently at Utah Tech, will have an experienced unit. He returns senior Luke Drzewiecki, who converted 10-of-14 field goals last season, and reliable punter Aaron Rodriguez.\n\nSummary\n\nMendenhall returns to Albuquerque for the first time since he was an assistant coach there in 2002, where he’ll hope to resurrect a program that showed signs of life during the tail end of the Danny Gonzales era, but still remains mired in mediocrity. The Lobos haven’t made a bowl game since 2016, the longest streak in the Mountain West, and they lost numerous playmakers to the portal during the coaching change.\n\nThe new mantra surrounding Lobo football is #EarnedNotGiven, with players gradually learning the ropes of Mendenhall’s player-first, detail-oriented mentality that has served him well over the course of his career.\n\n“‘Earned not given’ is everything,” says Mendenhall. “It’s the foundation to the development of a human being. I think it reflects gratitude. I think it reflects work.”\n\nMendenhall assembled a staff that’s familiar with him and they brought in a solid transfer class to plug immediate holes on a roster that was shredded by the portal, but lack of depth and experience is bound to hold UNM back in 2024—as could a schedule that includes Arizona, Auburn, Washington State and FCS powerhouse Montana State.\n\nKnow the Foe: Florida International Panthers\n\nLOCATION: Miami, Florida (population 442,241)\n\nCONFERENCE: Conference USA\n\n2023 RECORD: 4-8, 1-7 in CUSA\n\n2024 PREDICTION: 7th\n\nHEAD COACH: Mike MacIntyre, 3rd season\n\nSan José State, 2010-12 (16-21)\n\nColorado, 2013-18 (30-44)\n\nFIU, 2022-present (8-16)\n\nSTADIUM: Alfonso Field at Riccardo Silva Stadium (opened 1995, capacity 20,000)\n\n2023 RESULTS\n\nL, 22-17 @ Louisiana Tech\n\nW, 14-12 vs Maine (FCS)\n\nW, 46-39 vs North Texas\n\nW, 24-17 @ UConn\n\nL, 6-38 vs Liberty\n\nL, 17-34 @ New Mexico State\n\nL, 14-27 vs UTEP\n\nW, 33-27 (2OT) @ Sam Houston\n\nL, 16-41 vs Jacksonville State\n\nL, 6-40 @ Middle Tennessee\n\nL, 20-44 @ Arkansas\n\nL, 28-41 vs Western Kentucky\n\n2024 SCHEDULE\n\nAug. 31 @ Indiana\n\nSept. 7 vs Central Michigan\n\nSept. 14 @ Florida Atlantic\n\nSept. 21 vs Monmouth (FCS)\n\nSept. 28 vs Louisiana Tech\n\nOct. 9 @ Liberty\n\nOct. 16 @ UTEP\n\nOct. 22 vs Sam Houston\n\nOct. 29 vs New Mexico State\n\nNov. 16 @ Jacksonville State\n\nNov. 23 @ Kennesaw State\n\nNov. 30 vs Middle Tennessee\n\nBold indicates CUSA game.\n\nKey CUSA game: Louisiana Tech (Sept. 28th)\n\nThis game is important for a couple of reasons: the Bulldogs and the Panthers are both under third-year coaches and both are looking for a breakthrough season, and it’s also the CUSA opener for both schools.\n\nKey non-conference game: Florida Atlantic (Sept. 14th)\n\nThe Shula Bowl — named for legendary NFL head coach Don Shula — returns after a one-year hiatus.

S CJ Christian (Senior):\n\nThe senior from Normal, Illinois is a standout in the Panthers’ five-man secondary, picking off a team-high three passes in 2023, in addition to 55 tackles and three pass breakups.\n\n2. QB Keyone Jenkins (Sophomore):\n\nHe had his expected ups and downs as a true freshman, but the former Auburn commit threw for 2,414 yards, 11 touchdowns and 11 interceptions last fall. With a full year in coordinator David Yost’s pass-happy system, Jenkins should take his game up a notch in 2024.\n\n3. LB Reggie Peterson (Senior):\n\nPeterson, a former walk-on, adds proven production at linebacker after collecting 104 total tackles, 7.5 TFL and 3.5 sacks in his 2023 campaign.\n\nTHREE KEY LOSSES\n\n1. LB Donovan Manuel (undrafted free agent, Minnesota Vikings):\n\nHe was a tackling machine for FIU, recording 121 for the year, as well as a team-high 15.5 tackles for loss.\n\n2. WR Kris Mitchell: (transferred to Notre Dame)\n\nMitchell caught 64 passes in 2023, which was double the next-highest target (Eric Rivers, with 32). So it was a big blow when he chose to enter the portal in December.\n\n3. DB D’Verik Daniel (graduated):\n\nDaniel finished third on the Panthers with 77 tackles.\n\nTHREE KEY ADDITIONS\n\n1. DT Cole Gustafson (Junior)\n\nThe Panthers’ run defense was again their Achilles’ heel in 2023, and the 310-pound Gustafson could help clog the middle.\n\n2. WR Desna “D.J.” Washington (Grad Student)\n\nThe 6’5″ Washington showed flashes of becoming a deep threat at New Mexico last fall, making three TD grabs on only 29 total catches. Before UNM, he posted over 2,000 receiving yards during his JUCO career at Iowa Central.\n\n3. LB Travion Barnes (Junior)\n\nOriginally from Apopka, Florida in suburban Orlando, Barnes was Mr. Consistency during his career at Georgia Military College, averaging over nine tackles per game the past two seasons.\n\n2024 Preview – Offense\n\nSeven starters return to an offense that struggled in 2023 as the Panthers finished with a second consecutive 4-8 record under head coach Mike MacIntyre and OC David Yost.\n\nLefty Keyone Jenkins, who surprised many by staying in Miami and playing for the Panthers, also surprised the coaches by seizing the QB job as a true freshman. He struggled at times, completing 58 percent of his passes for 2,414 yards, 11 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, while also rushing for six TDs. Junior Haden Carlson attempted 12 passes last season and will be the primary backup option after Grayson James transferred.\n\n“Keyone has done real well,” MacIntyre said as spring practice started. “He’s got some muscles now. I’ve been teasing him. He’s gone from 180 pounds to 192 pounds, stronger and throwing the ball real well. He looked good out there today. He’s had a good offseason and an excellent spring.”\n\nFIU didn’t offer much in the ground game, with South Dakota transfer Shomari Lawrence getting the bulk of the carries. He finished the year with 566 yards and four touchdowns and is back for his junior season, but there is increased depth. Junior Kejon Owens has some potential, and veteran Lexington “Flex” Joseph is back after missing the entire 2023 season.\n\nJoseph rushed for 536 yards and five touchdowns in 2022 before tearing his ACL in fall camp last year and missing the entire season. The FIU ground game needs help (second-worst in CUSA in ‘23), and Joseph came back despite already having his degree in hand.\n\n“I already graduated. Had different internships and jobs lined up, and it was a very bad injury, so a lot was weighing on me,” Joseph said during the spring.\n\n“But my teammates, my family and my coaches, they kept going in my ear, like, “You got this.”\n\nThe Panthers suffered a major blow when leading returning receiver Kris Mitchell transferred to Notre Dame in early December. He caught 64 passes, twice as many as the next leading receiver (Eric Rivers, with 32). Speedy Dean Patterson caught 28 passes for 423 yards last year (both career highs), and coaches like redshirt freshman Luby Maurice Jr. as well. New Mexico transfer D.J. Washington has a 6’5″ frame and is athletic after the catch, making 29 of them for the Lobos last year before returning to his South Florida roots.\n\nTight end could be a position of strength with senior Josiah Miamen (14 catches), along with the Beers brothers, Rocky and Rowdy. Rowdy, a redshirt freshman, learned on the job last year, while Rocky transferred in from Air Force last summer and brings veteran leadership.\n\nAs for the line, the Panthers have some starting experience (John Bock II, Naeer Jackson, Wyatt Lawson) and have added some athletic newcomers to the rotation, including NC State transfer Jaleel Davis and UTSA transfer Daniel Ogundipe.\n\nThis group showed slow-but-steady growth as the season progressed last fall, but depth still isn’t ideal. The Panthers also received a blow here in the spring when Bock was slapped with a six-game ban after testing positive for a banned substance. Redshirt freshman Jaheim Buchanon will have to hold down the fort at center until then.\n\nDefensive back Brian Blades II\n\n2024 Preview – Defense\n\nThe Panthers gave up 31.8 points per game in 2023, as a 3-1 start evaporated into a 4-8 finish, then they lost several key players to graduation and/or the portal: defensive back Adrian Cole, linebacker Donovan Manuel and defensive linemen Jack Daly and Jordan Guerad.\n\nWith that said, third-year coordinator Jovan Dewitt sounded confident in the spring in terms of the Panthers’ production and experience as the staff threw around some new ideas.\n\n“We’ve implemented a couple of things. It’s been a lot of fun. Obviously, we’re a lot older than we’ve been since we’ve been here, so you’re starting to see some of that shine throughout some of the guys in terms of experience,” Dewitt said.\n\nReggie Peterson Jr. (104 tackles) is a quality piece to build around at linebacker, while the Panthers’ staff added some key numbers during the early signing period, including three-star JUCO transfer Travion Barnes, Bethune-Cookman transfer Eddie Watts III and true freshman Josiah Taylor.\n\nSenior linebacker Elijah Anderson-Taylor is a former FCS All-American at Northern Colorado who transferred to FIU prior to last fall, posting a perfectly respectable 46 tackles, 4.5 tackles for loss and a forced fumble. But coaches noticed that he had hit a new gear in the spring, showing a more muscular frame.\n\n“He looks completely different than he did,” said Dewitt. “He’s way more sideline-to-sideline.”\n\nCJ Christian showed signs of becoming an all-around playmaker in the secondary, recording 55 tackles, three picks and three pass breakups. Cornerback Hezekiah Masses has played a lot of football and enters his second season as a full-time starter. Senior Jamal Potts is another experienced name after he notched 63 stops, six TFL, two pass breakups and two forced fumbles, while Brian Blades II broke up six passes of his own.\n\nConverted running back Antonio Patterson is an athletic addition to the safety room, while coaches also brought in JUCO transfer Ashton Levells and a trio of three-star freshmen, including Shamir Sterlin, who showed immediate flashes after enrolling early.\n\n“He’s doing a great job, an unbelievable job as a freshman coming into his first semester,” Dewitt said of Sterlin. “He’s supposed to be in prom…He’s done an unbelievable job adapting and learning everything and really processing packages. We can allow some of those young guys to learn where to be and how to do things.”\n\nThe situation up front is more concerning, as the Panthers have lacked size and depth there for years, and coaches are making the pass rush a greater priority. Sophomore defensive end Steven Shannon—son of former Miami head coach Randy Shannon—has potential after racking up 14 tackles and two tackles for loss in 11 games off the bench.\n\nFellow sophomore Toddrick Brewton, a touted recruit, will be expected to take on a larger role at rush end after Travonte O’Neal entered the portal. The Panthers will look to a combination of Clinton Mahoni, Cole Gustafson and Marquez Tatum to clog the middle. Gustafson, a JUCO transfer from California’s American River College, impressed in spring practice as well.\n\n2024 Preview – Special Teams\n\nThis could be a strength for FIU in 2024. The Panthers return both specialists, and both are seniors. Daton Montiel averaged 39.1 yards per punt, with a long of 58, and had only three touchbacks all season. Chase Gabriel booted 9-of-12 field goals, with a long of 50.\n\nSummary\n\nMacIntyre has posted back-to-back 4-8 seasons, and last year’s slide included a 1-7 finish after a promising 3-1 start. He’s crossing his fingers that another solid recruiting class and continuity at the coordinator positions will help get the Panthers over the hump in Year Three, and in spring practice he confidently stated that this was his most mature team since taking the job.\n\nA more experienced Jenkins will need to take the next step in his development, while the transfer players in the front seven need to help stop the bleeding on defense. The Panthers had the nation’s 121st-ranked run defense in 2023 and they’ll still need more depth heading forward.\n\nDespite the recent problems and a reasonably tough schedule, a bowl game is achievable in 2024 if FIU can stay healthy and start stopping more teams on D.\n\nKnow the Foe: Jacksonville State Gamecocks\n\nLOCATION: Jacksonville, Alabama (population 14,385)\n\nCONFERENCE: Conference USA\n\n2023 RECORD: 9-4, 6-2 in CUSA\n\n2024 PREDICTION: 3rd in CUSA\n\nHEAD COACH: Rich Rodriguez, 2nd season\n\nSalem, 1998 (2-8)\n\nGlenville State, 1990-96 (43-28-2)\n\nWest Virginia, 2001-07 (60-26)\n\nMichigan, 2008-10 (15-22)\n\nArizona, 2012-17 (43-35)\n\nJacksonville State, 2022-present (18-6)\n\nSTADIUM: Burgess-Snow Field at JSU Stadium (opened 1947, capacity 24,000)\n\n2023 Results\n\nW, 17-14 vs UTEP\n\nW, 49-3 vs East Tennessee State (FCS)\n\nL, 16-30 @ Coastal Carolina\n\nW, 21-0 vs Eastern Michigan\n\nW, 35-28 (OT) @ Sam Houston\n\nW, 45-30 @ Middle Tennessee\n\nL, 13-31 vs Liberty\n\nW, 20-17 vs Western Kentucky\n\nW, 41-16 @ Florida International\n\nL, 28-38 @ South Carolina\n\nW, 56-17 Louisiana Tech\n\nL, 17-20 @ New Mexico State\n\nW, 34-31 (OT) vs Louisiana-Lafayette (New Orleans Bowl)\n\n2024 Schedule\n\nAug. 31 vs Coastal Carolina\n\nSept. 7 @ Louisville\n\nSept. 14 @ Eastern Michigan\n\nSept. 21 vs Southern Mississippi\n\nOct. 4 @ Kennesaw State\n\nOct. 9 vs New Mexico State\n\nOct. 23 vs Middle Tennessee\n\nOct. 30 @ Liberty\n\nNov. 9 @ Louisiana Tech\n\nNov. 16 vs Florida International\n\nNov. 23 vs Sam Houston\n\nNov 30 @ Western Kentucky\n\nBold indicates CUSA game.\n\nKey CUSA game: Liberty (Oct. 30th)\n\nThe Gamecocks lost to the Flames last season, and they’ll face them on the road again this year.

He finished 2023 with 60 tackles, 5.5 TFLs, one sack, one forced fumble and three QB hurries.\n\nTHREE KEY LOSSES\n\nQB Zion Webb (graduated)\n\nWebb finished his eligibility with a super-senior season in which he passed for 1,437 yards and rushed for 811, scoring a combined 13 TDs.\n\nLB Quae Drake (graduated)\n\nThe grad transfer from Louisiana-Monroe posted 92 tackles, leading the team, as well as 6.5 TFLs.\n\nDE Kamari Stephens (transferred to Arkansas State)\n\nThe 6’3″, 250-pound defensive end transferred to the Red Wolves after spending 2023 with the Gamecocks, forcing four fumbles and recording 8.5 sacks and one interception.\n\nTHREE KEY ADDITIONS\n\nWR Samario Rudolph (Grad Student)\n\nNicknamed “Flip,” Rudolph comes to Jax State from UAB, where he made 45 career catches, including a career-high 22 in 2023. He has spent his entire sporting career in Alabama after prepping at Cottage Hill Christian Academy in Mobile.\n\nLB Zedric Washington Jr. (Freshman)\n\nWashington comes in with FBS-ready size (6’3″, 225) and was a three-star recruit out of Mississippi who originally committed to Louisiana-Lafayette.\n\nQB Zion Turner (Redshirt Sophomore)\n\nThe dual-threat from Fort Lauderdale, Florida transfers in from UConn. Despite historic turnover issues, Turner is an athletic playmaker who could be an ideal fit in Rich Rodriguez’s zone-read style of offense. He accounted for 1,677 yards and 10 TDs in two seasons with the Huskies.\n\n2024 Preview – Offense\n\nHead coach Rich Rodriguez’s offense averaged just over 30 yards per game, good enough for third in CUSA in the Gamecocks’ conference debut, but now they must replace long-time starting QB Zion Webb.\n\nLogan Smothers, a Nebraska transfer, filled in last season at times, passing for 735 yards, six touchdowns and three interceptions while also rushing for 322 yards and seven more scores. He’ll be joined by two transfers, Tyler Huff (Furman) and Zion Turner (UConn), who are competing for the starting role, although only Turner was on campus in the spring.\n\nAn athletic playmaker from Florida, Turner spent two seasons at UConn, completing 57.8 percent of his passes as a true freshman in 2022 as the Huskies surprised with a bowl berth, but he also threw nine TDs to 10 INTs. There’s also redshirt sophomore Ta’Sean Smoot, who is a tantalizing athlete when he’s on the field, which hasn’t been often.\n\nLikewise, the Gamecocks lost tailback Malik Jackson, but return senior Anwar Lewis (452 yards and three TDs) and bring in USF transfer Michel Dukes and Georgia transfer Andrew Paul. Jax State also got good news when veteran Ron Wiggins (5.1 yards per carry, six TDs) withdrew from the portal in May.\n\nReceiver is more of a concern. Jax State will miss its top two receivers, Perry Carter and Quinton Lane (combined 68 receptions). Juniors Michael Pettway and P.J. Wells have some experience, but neither had more than 17 catches last season.\n\nHelp is on the way in the transfer portal: ex-Clemson receiver Brannon Spector, UAB transfer Samario Rudolph, Colorado transfer Tar’Varish Dawson and North Alabama transfer Demarcus Lacey all could be valuable contributors as the Gamecocks look to improve the passing attack. Second team all-conference pick Sean Brown returns at tight end after averaging over 15 yards per catch.\n\nSenior guard Clay Webb (no relation to Zion) leads one of the conference’s best lines.\n\n2024 Preview – Defense\n\nJax State’s stingy defense was tops in CUSA against the run and made 39 sacks, but young coordinator Zac Alley was scooped up for a job at Oklahoma in the offseason. Former Tulsa DC Luke Olsen, who spent last year in an analyst role at TCU, will be the Gamecocks’ new coordinator.\n\nThere’s certainly experience returning, although Jax State will need to replace tough-as-nails vets like Kolbi Fuqua, Chris Hardie and Jeremiah Harris. After spring practice, linebacker/nickel Larry Worth also surprised many by entering the portal following a season in which he recorded 63 tackles, six tackles for loss and four sacks. The defensive line will be bolstered by Ole Miss transfer Reginald Hughes, who played in only seven games in two seasons with the Rebels, but was previously a top-five JUCO recruit. He’ll help fill Hardie’s cleats.\n\nAt linebacker, Laletia Hale (60 tackles, 5.5 TFLs) is undersized, but has shown the ability to be productive off the bench. Keep an eye on Dajwon Deloach, who showed playmaking ability as a true freshman on special teams last season. Sophomore Jibreel Al-Amin (15 tackles, one sack) also has potential.\n\nIn the secondary, the Gamecocks return two out of four starters: safety Fred Perry and cornerback Derek Carter. Senior Jalen Bustamente is steady at nickelback, while backups Jabari Mack, Geimere Latimer and Austin Ambush will be expecting to see more minutes in Olsen’s new scheme. Minnesota transfer Tyler Bride will arrive in time for fall camp.\n\n2024 Preview – Special Teams\n\nLosing placekicker Alen Karajic was a big portal loss. His replacement will probably be redshirt freshman Garrison Rippa, who made both of his attempts in 2023, but neither was beyond 30 yards. Australian punter Jack Dawson returns for his third season as a starter after averaging 42.2 yards per punt, with a long of 65.\n\nSummary\n\nDespite losing Alley and breaking in new starters at QB and RB, the Gamecocks should still remain in the top half of CUSA thanks to a veteran coaching staff and aggressive playmakers on defense.\n\nThat should help level the playing field as Jax State finds its footing under a new DC in Olsen and searches for a full-time QB. The kicking game could be a concern, as could a sneaky challenging early schedule that includes games against Louisville, Eastern Michigan and Coastal Carolina, all of whom went bowling last year. The CUSA part of the schedule includes tough road trips to Liberty and Western Kentucky.\n\nNonetheless, the Gamecocks are motivated to contend after FBS transition rules prevented them from playing for the CUSA championship game last season. Rodriguez has gone 18-6 in two years at Jax State thus far and was rewarded with an extension through 2030 in the offseason. Another bowl game should be the floor.\n\nKnow the Foe: Liberty Flames\n\nLOCATION: Lynchburg, Virginia (population 79,009)\n\nCONFERENCE: Conference USA\n\n2023 RECORD: 13-1, 9-0 in CUSA\n\n2024 PREDICTION: 1st\n\nHEAD COACH: Jamey Chadwell, 2nd season\n\nNorth Greenville, 2009-11 (22-14)\n\nDelta State, 2012 (3-7)\n\nCharleston Southern, 2013-16 (35-14)\n\nCoastal Carolina, 2017; 2019-22 (39-22)\n\nLiberty, 2023-present (13-1)\n\nSTADIUM: Arthur L.

He’ll be looking to develop a rapport with some new receivers in 2024.\n\nRB Quinton Cooley (Redshirt Senior)\n\nThe Wake Forest transfer averaged 6.3 yards per carry in his first season with the Flames, finishing with 1,409 yards and 16 TDs.\n\nS Brylan Green (Junior)\n\nThe Liberty secondary was bend-but-don’t-break last season, giving up nearly 260 passing yards per game while also leading the nation in interceptions. Green, a Louisiana native, had five of them and also broke up eight passes.\n\nTHREE KEY LOSSES\n\nWR C.J. Daniels (transferred to LSU)\n\nDaniels transferred to LSU after leading the Flames in receiving (55 receptions, 1,067 yards, 10 TDs).\n\nDT Kendy Charles (transferred to Duke)\n\nThe experienced run-stuffer transferred in the offseason after posting 4.5 TFLs and three sacks in eight games.\n\nCB Kobe Singleton (transferred to Oregon State)\n\nSingleton was first on the team in pass breakups (12) and second on the team in interceptions (four) before transferring to OSU.\n\nTHREE KEY ADDITIONS\n\nCB Dominick Hill (Redshirt Junior)\n\nHill, who has experience at both South Carolina and Temple, comes to LU with the versatility to play either cornerback or safety. Most recently at Temple, he had 76 tackles and a forced fumble in the past two seasons.\n\nQB Ryan Burger (Redshirt Sophomore)\n\nWith no experience behind Salter at QB, Burger’s addition looms large. The Myrtle Beach, South Carolina native was the opening day starter for Applachian State last fall, but broke a finger in that game and missed the rest of the season. He completed 11-of-17 passes for 113 yards and one TD in his App State career.\n\nWR Tyson Mobley (Grad Student)\n\nMobley was recruited by Liberty head coach Jamey Chadwell to Coastal Carolina. After transferring to LU in the spring, Mobley showed potential despite his average size (6’0”, 200), catching a TD pass in the spring game.\n\n2024 Preview – Offense\n\nAfter a brief flirtation with the portal, quarterback Kaidon Salter—who threw for over 2,800 yards and ran for over 1,000—returns to lead a potentially explosive Liberty offense once again. His best tailback, Quinton Cooley, also returns, but the Flames will be looking for some new targets at receiver.\n\nThe Flames lost four of their top five receivers, and as of press time, Aaron Bedgood (772 all-purpose yards in 2023) was still waiting on a waiver to give him one more season of eligibility.\n\nCoaches will be expecting veteran Treon Sibley (23 catches) to produce alongside little-used backups Kylen Austin and Markel Fortenberry. Coastal Carolina transfer Tyson Mobley provided some optimism with a long TD catch in the spring game, while redshirt freshman Darius Copeland was named the squad’s most improved receiver.\n\nAt tight end, Liberty returns Bentley Hanshaw and Austin Henderson, who posted only 18 and 10 catches, respectively, last season, but both possess quality size. They also signed two three-star freshmen, Connie Hewitt II and Eli Sisson.\n\nLU’s offensive line was the team’s strength last season, but it must now replace three starters. This unit should still be OK, and it improved with the addition of transfer John Paul Flores, who has experience at both Dartmouth and Louisville, as well as Jordan Hall (Monmouth) and D.J. Geth (North Carolina). If the group can develop depth and stay healthy, they’ll likely shine again. Right tackle Xavior Gray gained valuable reps down the stretch last season, and JUCO transfer Andrew Johnson could fill in at either guard or tackle.\n\n2024 Preview – Defense\n\nThe Flames suffered several major losses here, particularly leading tackler Tyren Dupree (graduated), veteran safety Preston Hodge (transferred to Colorado) and cornerback Kobe Singleton (transferred to Oregon State). However, some playmakers return for second-year coordinator Skylor Magee.\n\nThere’s exciting young pass-rushers in T.J. Bush, who made some Freshman All-America lists after posting 32 tackles, seven tackles for loss and four pass breakups. Junior C.J. Bazile Jr. can be a handful as well (10.5 tackles for loss). JUCO pass-rushers Rod Daniels and Alvin Williams will likely find roles in hybrid edge-rusher positions, or “Jokers” as Magee calls them.\n\nThe Flames are less experienced on the interior after losing Kendy Charles to Duke. Senior Jay Hardy (31 tackles), sophomore Chris Boti (15 tackles, 2.5 sacks) and junior Bryce Dixon (35 tackles) saw some quality time off the bench last year and will be expected to hold down the fort alongside Wake Forest transfer Eli Hall.\n\nThe secondary is a mix of old and new faces, and the Flames will be hard-pressed to have a repeat performance—they led the nation in interceptions, but were 116th nationally against the pass.\n\nJunior nickel Brylan Green (five INTs) and senior safety Quinton Reese (55 tackles) are keepers, but LU will need to identify new playmakers amongst a hodge-podge group that includes sophomore corner Dexter Ricks, grad transfers Alex Oliver and Dominick Hill and redshirt sophomore Elijah Hopkins.\n\nRedshirt freshman Christian Bodnar converted from safety to cornerback and was identified as a standout in the spring by coaches. JUCO transfer Eldric Griffin was a three-star recruit and will most likely play corner.\n\n2024 Preview – Special Teams\n\nLiberty had significant issues in the kicking game in 2023, and it was concerning enough that head coach Jamey Chadwell used three scholarships on kickers in the recruiting class.\n\nReturnee Nick Brown went only 5-for-10 last year, although he looked a bit better in the spring game. Grad transfer Colin Karhu and true freshmen Sam Crossan and Caleb Willis were brought in as insurance policies.\n\nNC State transfer receiver Julian Gray has some experience in the return game, so he could provide a spark there (24.9 yards per return in his career).\n\nSummary\n\nChadwell’s debut was excellent, and Liberty will hope to have the talent and good injury luck to repeat as CUSA champs, but they’re still vulnerable to losing their best players to the portal and, with very little depth behind Salter, will need to make sure he avoids taking unnecessary hits. The schedule is kind once again, but the Flames won’t catch anyone by surprise this season.\n\nSalter and Cooley are an entertaining one-two punch in the ground game, but losses on the O-line could prove critical, while the Flames will hope that strategic portal additions on defense will help reinvigorate the unit as younger three-star talent circulates through the program. There’s enough here for Liberty to be optimistic, although another New Year’s Six berth is highly unlikely.\n\nKnow the Foe: Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders\n\nLOCATION: Murfreesboro, Tennessee (population 152,769)\n\nCONFERENCE: Conference USA\n\n2023 RECORD: 4-8, 3-5 in CUSA\n\n2024 PREDICTION: 6th\n\nHEAD COACH: Derek Mason, 1st season\n\nVanderbilt, 2014-20 (27-55)\n\nMiddle Tennessee, 2024-present\n\nSTADIUM: Johnny “Red” Floyd Stadium, opened 1933, capacity 30,788)\n\n2023 RESULTS\n\nL, 7-56 @ Alabama\n\nL, 19-23 @ Missouri\n\nW, 35-14 vs Murray State (FCS)\n\nL, 23-31 vs Colorado State\n\nL, 10-31 @ Western Kentucky\n\nL, 30-45 vs Jacksonville State\n\nW, 31-23 vs Louisiana Tech\n\nL, 35-42 @ Liberty\n\nL, 7-13 @ New Mexico State\n\nW, 40-6 vs Florida International\n\nW, 34-30 vs UTEP\n\nL, 20-23 @ Sam Houston\n\n2024 SCHEDULE\n\nAug. 31 vs Tennessee Tech (FCS)\n\nSept. 7 @ Ole Miss\n\nSept. 14 vs Western Kentucky\n\nSept. 21 vs Duke\n\nSept. 28 @ Memphis\n\nOct. 10 @ Louisiana Tech\n\nOct. 15 vs Kennesaw State\n\nOct. 23 @ Jacksonville State\n\nNov. 2 @ UTEP\n\nNov. 9 vs Liberty\n\nNov. 23 vs New Mexico State\n\nNov. 30 @ Florida International\n\nBold indicates CUSA game.\n\nKey CUSA game: Western Kentucky (Sept. 14th)\n\nThis rivalry game serves as both teams’ conference opener in 2024 in Murfreesboro.
