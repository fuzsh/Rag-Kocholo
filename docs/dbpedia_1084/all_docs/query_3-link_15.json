        "text": "Update:\n\nBeaumont Police say there are multiple suspects involved in the murder and they need the public's help identifying them.\n\nYates' mother, Pamela Harris-Fisher, spoke with KFDM anchor/reporter saying, \"It's a sigh of some relief, but not much because I know that there, from what I'm hearing, there are more people out there that were involved.\"\n\nPolice believe that Yates was targeted.\n\n\"Leroy Harris is a known criminal. He has a very long, extensive rap sheet. He is suspect in a homicide in Houston, He is a suspect in some other violent felonies,\" says Officer Haley Morrow with the Beaumont Police Department.\n\nInvestigators have no determined a motive or released a number of suspects at this time.\n\nAccording to Morrow, stolen vehicles and stolen firearms were also involved in this murder.\n\nKFDM/Fox 4's Mya Caleb reports.\n\nPreviously Reported:\n\nThe Beaumont Police Department says it's made an arrest in the murder of Ricky Yates Jr.\n\nThe Special Assignment Unit located Leroy Harris, 42, of Beaumont, and brought him to police headquarters Wednesday to speak with investigators.\n\nJustice of the Peace Ben Collins Sr. set bond at $1 million on the murder charge.\n\nPolice are searching for Terrance Moore, 17. They called him a person of interest and he came in for questioning by detectives several weeks ago. JP Ben Collins Sr. issued a murder warrant Friday and set his bond at $1 million.\n\nYates, 30, was shot multiple times and killed in his home on December 3 in the 3900 block of Bayou Road near Calder.\n\nAnyone with information about the crime is asked to call Beaumont Police at 409-832-1234. You can also submit a tip to Southeast Texas Crime Stoppers at 409-833-TIPS(8477) or by downloading the P3 Tips App on your smartphone. All Crime Stoppers tips are anonymous and you may be eligible for a cash reward.\n\nYates' mother, Pamela Harris-Fisher, spoke with KFDM anchor/reporter Mello Styles in December. He was Fisher's only son.\n\nShe pleaded with the Beaumont community to help find those responsible for her son's death.\n\nShe reacted to the breakthrough Wednesday and sent a comment to Mello.\n\n\"It gives us a little peace and some justice,\" texted Pamela Yates. \"We will be happier once everyone involved is in custody."
