        "text": "Dec. 7, 2004\n\nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. - The Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association (ACSMA) and the Associated Press announced their 2004 All-ACC football teams this afternoon, and five University of Maryland players were named to either the first or second team. Guard C.J. Brooks, defensive end Shawne Merriman and linebacker D'Qwell Jackson all earned first team status while cornerback Domonique Foxworth and punter Adam Podlesh were named to the second team.\n\nIn addition to the five who earned All-ACC status, safety Chris Kelley and placekicker Nick Novak each garnered honorable mention recognition for their play in '04.\n\nMaryland's three first team players were third-most among conference schools, trailing only Virginia (5) and Virginia Tech (4). Florida State also had three first teamers while Miami, Wake Forest, Clemson and Georgia Tech each had two. In four years now, head coach Ralph Friedgen has had a total of 35 players named either first or second team All-ACC. By comparison, the school had 38 players named to the first and second team from 1985-2000.\n\nJackson led the ACC in tackles with 123 and was the leading vote-getter among linebackers. He trailed only Miami's Antrelle Rolle among defensive players receiving votes and earned 32 more than Butkus finalist Ahmad Brooks of Virginia. Merriman was the second-leading vote-getter of four defensive lineman to receive first team all-league. The junior finished tied for eighth in the league in tackles, tied for second in sacks and TFLs and first in forced fumbles. The first team mention is the first for both players -- both juniors -- with Jackson having earned second team status last year and Merriman being a first-time honoree.\n\nOn offense, Brooks was a first team selection for the second straight year. Foxworth and Podlesh were each second team last season while Kelley was named honorable mention in his first season as a starter. Novak's honorable mention makes it the third straight year that the ACC's all-time leading scorer will have earned some form of ACC recognition (he was first team in 2002 and 2003).\n\nBelow is this year's complete list of All-ACC performers:\n\n2004 ACSMA/AP All-ACC Football Team & Individual Awards\n\n(100 Total Ballots; 200 total points - 30 minimum for HM)\n\nOFFENSEFirst TeamSecond TeamHonorable Mention QuarterbackBryan Randall, Sr., VT (167)Brock Berlin, Sr., Miami (100)Darian Durant, Sr., UNC (32) Running\n\nBackAlvin Pearman, Sr., UVa (181)\n\nChris Barclay, Jr., WF (163)Frank Gore, Jr., Miami (87)\n\nLeon Washington, Jr., FSU (83)Chad Scott, Sr., UNC (32) Wide\n\nReceiverAirese Currie, Sr., Clem.
