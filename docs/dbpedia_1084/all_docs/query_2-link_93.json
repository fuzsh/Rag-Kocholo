        "text": "The 2024 Tropical Bowl will take place in Daytona Beach, FL on Saturday at Municipal Stadium. The game will kick off at noon Eastern.\n\nThe game has a better roster than the ones in recent years. Another beneficiary of the NFLPA Bowl shutting its doors. The Tropical Bowl would probably rank fourth amongst the Collegiate All-Star Games that have a game at the end of the week. The CGS does not have an actual game.\n\nThe scouting staff is led by the guys over at NFL Draft Blitz.\n\nToday, I will look at the 2024 Tropical Bowl roster, position by position.\n\n2024 TROPICAL BOWL: ROSTER BREAKDOWN\n\nQUARTERBACKS\n\nCole Dow, Dayton\n\nMike DiLiello, Austin Peay\n\nMatt Struck, Southern Oregon\n\nDarren Grainger, Georgia State\n\nNolan Grooms, Yale\n\nMitchel Davidson, Youngstown State\n\nGunnar Watson, Troy\n\nThe best among this group is Georgia State’s Darren Grainger. He is a plus athlete with a decent arm. Gunnar Watson of Troy will make a damn fine UFL project.\n\nRUNNING BACKS\n\nElijah Collins, Oklahoma State\n\nAustin Bacher, Western Oregon\n\nBryce Agnew, Marietta\n\nThurlow Wilkins, Concord\n\nElijah Collins had his best season as a freshman at Michigan State in 2019. He was a reserve after that at both MSU and Oklahoma State.\n\nWIDE RECEIVERS\n\nCole Beck, Virginia Tech\n\nShane Hooks, Auburn\n\nChris Autman-Bell, Minnesota\n\nBryce Oliver, Youngstown State\n\nDevron Harper, Mercer\n\nAmad Anderson, Jr., Temple\n\nDequece Carter, Indiana\n\nPeter LeBlanc, Louisiana\n\nRoderic Burns, North Texas\n\nDJ Powell, Duquesne\n\nKyren Petteway, Long Island\n\nAssanti Kearney, Monmouth\n\nKoby Duru, Louisiana Tech\n\nEzekiel Lang, Missouri Southern\n\nAndre Tucker, Monmouth\n\nJelani Baker, Limestone\n\nAyir Asante, Wyoming\n\nCole Harrity, Buffalo\n\nMason Tipton, Yale\n\nDev Holmes, New Haven\n\nPerry Carter Jr., Jacksonville State\n\nBrennan McGuire, Gardner Webb\n\nThis is easily the best position group at the 2024 Tropical Bowl. Cole Beck has legit world-class speed. Like he is a bonafide Olympic track candidate this summer. Devron Harper has top end return skills. He and Ahmad Anderson (Temple) have a chance to be on NFL rosters as slot targets. Chris Autman-Bell has flashed at Minnesota but has dealt with numerous injuries.\n\nTIGHT ENDS\n\nTrent Pennix, NC State\n\nNeal Johnson, Louisiana\n\nJosiah Johnson, Oklahoma State\n\nJoey Gatewood, Louisville\n\nMaleak Bryant, Long Island\n\nAlec Holler, UCF\n\nSteele Roring, Pittsburg State\n\nWith a resurgence of the fullback position in the NFL both Trent Pennix (NC State) and Neal Johnson (Louisiana) have a shot to make a roster there. Joey Gatewood is an interesting developmental project. He is a good athlete but has only played the position for a year after converting from QB.\n\nOFFENSIVE LINE\n\nTACKLES\n\nWillie Tyler, Louisville\n\nSpencer Rolland, North Carolina\n\nJoseph Ramos, Arizona State\n\nKameron Jones, Mississippi State\n\nBrian Dooley, Eastern Michigan\n\nClay Servin, Rice\n\nRyan Atkins, AR-Pine Bluff\n\nDeiyantei Powell-Woods, Central Michigan\n\nDevin Hayes, Middle Tennessee\n\nDarrell Simpson, Tulsa\n\nChristopher Walker, Montana\n\nSpencer Rolland (North Carolina) and Kameron Jones (Mississippi State) are the only noteworthy names here.\n\nINTERIOR OL\n\nWilliam Barnes, North Carolina\n\nAric Harris, Maryland\n\nSincere Haynesworth, Tulane\n\nDarrian Dalcourt, Alabama\n\nKameron Stutts, Auburn\n\nCole McAlpin, Belhaven\n\nNicholas Cerimele, Chattanooga\n\nKendrioun Boatman, Belhaven\n\nMarquice Robinson, Florida Atlantic\n\nMike Purcell, Maryland\n\nSebastian Delasoudas, Rhode Island\n\nLeroy Thomas II, Old Dominion\n\nTyrone Sampson Jr., Fresno State\n\nJordyn Slaughter, Illinois\n\nEd Montilus, North Carolina\n\nWilliam Barnes (North Carolina), Darrian Dalcourt (Alabama), and Sincere Haynesworth (Tulane) have all flashed at times in their collegiate careers. They have a chance to make some noise on a 90-man roster.\n\nEDGE RUSHERS\n\nTaijh Alston, Colorado\n\nNick White, Monmouth\n\nPatrick Joyner, Kansas\n\nJordan Domineck, Colorado\n\nTyreek Johnson, South Carolina\n\nRaydarius Freeman, UNC-Pembroke\n\nJordan Riggs, Merrimack\n\nJonathan Ross, South Florida\n\nThurman Geathers, Arkansas State\n\nTaijh Alston (Colorado, West Virginia transfer) and Tyreek Johnson (South Carolina) were both disappointing in 2023, making little impact. They were more highly thought of entering the season, so you would think there may still be something there.\n\nDEFENSIVE LINE\n\nTJ Franklin, Baylor\n\nElijah Chatman, SMU\n\nLevi Drake Rodriguez, Texas A&M-Commerce\n\nAdrian Gonzalez, Eastern Michigan\n\nDenzel Daxon, Illinois\n\nFish McWilliams, UAB\n\nIan Marshall, Northern State\n\nRobi Stuart, Central Michigan\n\nMayan Ahanotu, Rutgers\n\nKylen McCracken, Marshall\n\nWilliam Green, Nevada\n\nI was a big fan of SMU’s Elijah Chatman as an undersized interior pass rusher. He is the one to watch from this group.\n\nLINEBACKERS\n\nClayton Isbell, Coastal Carolina\n\nAntonio Grier, Arkansas\n\nTarique Barnes, Illinois\n\nDonovan Manuel, FIU\n\nCJ Goetz, Wisconsin\n\nMase Funa, Oregon\n\nLayton Jordan, Temple\n\nKhadry Jackson, Georgia Southern\n\nJohnathan Butler, Middle Tennessee\n\nJacob Roberts, Wake Forest\n\nPhilip Ossai, North Alabama\n\nJoe Sparacio, Eastern Michigan\n\nRich Miller, Kansas\n\nJoe Casale, Robert Morris\n\nNicholas Lerew, Stetson\n\nJackson Taylor, Delaware\n\nNiko Cooper, Western Kentucky\n\nMase Funa (Oregon), Clayton Isbell (Coastal Carolina), and Antonio Grier (Arkansas) fit into that category of all sizzle no steak. You hear about them but don’t really see all you want to. North Alabama’s Phillip Ossai is the younger brother of Cincinnati Bengals’ edge rusher Joseph Ossai.\n\nCORNERBACKS\n\nAl Blades Jr., Duke\n\nMalik Dunlap, Texas Tech\n\nKwinton Lassiter, Kansas\n\nKeondre Swoopes, UAB\n\nJordan Gregg, UNC-Pembroke\n\nAljareek Malry, Ball State\n\nJaden Dedman, Nevada\n\nRyan Dolce, Tusculum\n\nRussell Dandy, Eastern Illinois\n\nKnylen Miller-Levi, Minot State\n\nMonroe Sanderson, Mars Hill\n\nTerry Atta-Peters, East Central\n\nMalik Feaster, Memphis\n\nDJ Miller, Kent State\n\nJaiden Roe, Long Island\n\nRod’Darius Gattison, Western Carolina\n\nAl Blades Jr has been around a while. He has the bloodlines you want but the tape is hit or miss.\n\nSAFETIES\n\nNicario Harper, Illinois\n\nJason Maitre, Wisconsin\n\nJordan Anderson, UCLA\n\nCam Allen, Purdue\n\nChris Edmonds, Arizona State\n\nChase Williams, San Jose State\n\nDell Pettus, Troy\n\nNick Ross, Appalachian State\n\nBo Nicolas-Paul, Army\n\nJudson Tallandier II, Akron\n\nTywan Francis, Temple\n\nDavon Ferguson, Bowling Green\n\nJayden Wickware, San Diego\n\nMyles Heard, Louisiana Tech\n\nJarius Reimonenq, James Madison\n\nJason Simmons, Syracuse\n\nSean Hill, UNC-Pembroke\n\nWalter Reynolds, Ohio\n\nMichael Dowell, Miami (OH)\n\nKam Pedescleaux, Tulane\n\nThe safety group is probably the second best of the positions at the 2024 Tropical Bowl. Jordan Anderson (UCLA), Cam Allen (Purdue), and Nicario Harper (Illinois) should all be in a camp. Troy’s Dell Pettus and Tulane’s Kam Pedescleaux were both highly productive and have legitimate shots to be on a 53 next year.\n\nSPECIALISTS\n\nKICKERS\n\nI guess the punters are going to kick too.\n\nLONG SNAPPERS\n\nNick D’Ambra, Fresno State\n\nAll-time long snapper baby!\n\nPUNTERS\n\nLogan Burke, Ottawa (AZ)\n\nRicardo Chavez, Idaho\n\nThe 2024 Tropical Bowl will be telecast live on a PPV basis. However, if past years have been any indication, it will be uploaded to YouTube days later."
