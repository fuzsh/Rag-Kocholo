        "text": "Potential and upside are two key words when you talk about this Mid-Tennessee talent. Committing recently to Chattanooga, Harris III is a tall, long and active defender that screams pass rushing upside but the Lions senior still has a ways to go before he reaches his maximum capabilities. This guy has gotten better and better over the last few years while at CPA, developing his body properly while continuing to enhance his athletic skill set. Harris III is a very good athlete that could have gone to college as a tight end but myself, Chattanooga and others see his best potential at defensive end where his length, bend and explosion can be used to rush after the quarterback. The Mocs gained a steal here with this Nashville based product as I see this guyâ€™s best football days ahead of him with the potential to turn into an All-Conference player while also sporting the upside to take his game past the college gridiron."
