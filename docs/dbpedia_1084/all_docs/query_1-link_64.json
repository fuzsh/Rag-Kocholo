        "text": "Since the turn of the century, the list of Green Bay Packers players who have been named first-team All-Pro twice includes Aaron Rodgers, Davante Adams, Charles Woodson, David Bakhtiari … and Keisean Nixon.\n\nNixon was named to the first team by the Associated Press as kick returner, following up the same honor bestowed to him by the National Football League Players Association one day earlier. It also marks a second straight year that he's earned the honor.\n\nNixon led the league with 26.1 yards per return in 2023, racking up 782 yards over 30 returns. Last year, he returned 35 kicks for 1,009 yards (28.8 per return), including a 105-yard touchdown.\n\n“It’s a big deal,” Nixon said Thursday when asked about the NFLPA honor, though he also indicated he was waiting for the AP vote.\n\nWhen asked if a player like him was an endangered species as the NFL implements rules that curtail kickoff returns, he said with a smile, “Am I an endangered species? I’m one of a kind.”\n\nOn Friday, Nixon said it was a satisfying development after he felt he was snubbed for a Pro Bowl roster spot.\n\n\"It shows my worth,\" Nixon said. \"Last year was my first year ever doing (kickoffs regularly), and in my first full year I thought I was going to get the same opps (opportunities) as last year and (I got) nowhere near it. I still managed to have a good year, kind of, and it was a blessing, man. I'm happy.\"\n\nNixon will also contribute Sunday in the secondary, where the Packers will aim to slow the Dallas Cowboys in an NFC wild-card playoff battle.\n\nThe cornerback has an interception this year, with six passes defended, two fumble recoveries, three tackles for loss and 80 combined tackles.\n\nThe All-Pro team features just one player at numerous positions, including quarterback, running back, tight end, kicker, kick returner and each of the five offensive line positions. It names three receivers, two pass rushers, three linebackers, two cornerbacks, a slot corner and two safeties.\n\nPewaukee native T.J. Watt was named first-team All Pro for the fourth time in his career at pass rusher.\n\nPackers first-team All-Pro selections (since 1980)\n\nKeisean Nixon, kick returner (2022, 2023)\n\nAaron Rodgers (2011, 2014, 2020, 2021)\n\nDe'Vondre Campbell, linebacker (2021)\n\nDavante Adams, wide receiver (2020, 2021)\n\nDavid Bakhtiari, tackle (2018, 2020)\n\nCorey Linsley, center (2020)\n\nJohn Kuhn, fullback (2014)\n\nCharles Woodson, defensive back (2009, 2011)\n\nClay Matthews, linebacker (2010)\n\nWilliam Henderson, fullback (2004)\n\nDarren Sharper, defensive back (2000)\n\nReggie White, defensive end (1995, 1998)\n\nAntonio Freeman, wide receiver (1998)\n\nLeRoy Butler, defensive back (1993, 1996, 1997, 1998)\n\nBrett Favre, quarterback (1995, 1996, 1997)\n\nSterling Sharpe, wide receiver (1989, 1992, 1993)\n\nChris Jacke, kicker (1993)\n\nTim Harris, linebacker (1989)\n\nJames Lofton, wide receiver (1981)\n\nRyan Wood contributed to this story."
