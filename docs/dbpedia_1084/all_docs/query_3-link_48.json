        "text": "The 2023 NFL season will kick off next week as the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs host the Detroit Lions on Thursday, Sept. 7 (8:20 p.m. ET, NBC), which means teams are cutting their rosters in preparation.\n\nTeams were required to finalize their 53-man rosters by 4 p.m. ET on Tuesday. With the preseason already in the books, teams began making their 2023 roster cuts over the weekend.\n\nSeveral notable cuts happened Monday, when the Arizona Cardinals cut veteran quarterback Colt McCoy, despite keeping Kyler Murray on the physically unable to perform list. The Houston Texans also parted ways with a veteran as they cut captain Christian Kirksey.\n\nThere have also been multiple trades this week -- including the deal that sent quarterback Trey Lance to the Dallas Cowboys on Friday night -- as teams look to make room or bolster their roster.\n\nJump to a team:\n\nARI | ATL | BAL | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN\n\nCLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND\n\nJAX | KC | LAC | LAR | LV | MIA | MIN\n\nNE | NO | NYG | NYJ | PHI | PIT | SF\n\nSEA | TB | TEN | WSH\n\nNFC East\n\nDallas Cowboys\n\nBiggest move: Putting Jourdan Lewis on the active roster is a sign the veteran cornerback is close to contributing after suffering a severe foot injury in the middle of last season. Lewis had been on the physically unable to perform list through training camp but has picked up his work in recent weeks. If they kept him on PUP, he would have missed the first four games and, maybe more importantly, not been able to practice. While he might not be ready for the opener or even Week 2 or 3, he can practice with the team with a ramp-up period to test his foot and return to a role in the slot. Without that, he may have missed the first six games. Aside from maybe tight end Sean McKeon, there really was no surprise among the cuts, but the Cowboys will re-sign long-snapper Trent Sieg, special teams ace C.J. Goodwin and offensive lineman Chuma Edoga perhaps as soon as Wednesday after putting two players on injured reserve/designated to return. -- Todd Archer\n\nTraded: CB Kelvin Joseph\n\nAcquired: CB Noah Igbinoghene\n\nWaived/released: DT Isaac Alarcon, DE Ben Banogu, WR Jose Barbon, DT Quinton Bohanna, OL Earl Bostick, CB Myles Brooks, CB Josh Butler, LB Jabril Cox, S Tyler Coyle, RB Malik Davis, WR Dontario Drummond, OL Chuma Edoga, TE Princeton Fant, OL Matt Farniok, WR Simi Fehoko, CB C.J. Goodwin, TE Seth Green, QB Will Grier, OL Brock Hoffman, WR Dennis Houston, LB Malik Jefferson, DE Durrell Johnson, WR Tyron Johnson, LB Isaiah Land, OL Alec Lindstrom, CB D'Angelo Mandell, TE Sean McKeon, WR Jalen Moreno-Cropper, DB Sheldrick Redwine, LS Trent Sieg, OL Alex Taylor-Prioleau, DL Tyrus Wheat\n\nReserve/suspended: RB Ronald Jones\n\nReserve/injured: OL Josh Ball, WR David Durden, LB DeMarvion Overshown, TE John Stephens Jr.\n\nNew York Giants\n\nBiggest move: The Giants ultimately didn't have Cole Beasley, Jamison Crowder, David Sills V or Collin Johnson make the 53-man roster. That was one way for it all to work. Beasley will return in some capacity in the coming days, but the biggest move on cut day was the Giants activating WR Wan'Dale Robinson from the physically unable to perform list and putting him on the roster. The second-round pick is returning from a torn ACL suffered last year. His presence gives the Giants a lot of receivers who are at their best out of the slot. -- Jordan Raanan\n\nAcquired: OLB Boogie Basham (Bills)\n\nWaived/released: QB Tommy DeVito, WR Collin Johnson, RB Jashaun Corbin, RB James Robinson, WR Kalil Pimpleton, TE Ryan Jones, OT Tyre Phillips, G Jack Anderson, G Wyatt Davis, DT Ryder Anderson, DT Kobe Smith, OLB Habakkuk Baldonado, OLB Tomon Fox, LB Ray Wilborn, LB Dyontae Johnson, LB Darrian Beavers, DT Kevin Atkins, NT Donovan Jeter, CB Gemon Green, DB Darren Evans, DB Zyon Gilbert, S Alex Cook, LS Cameron Lyons\n\nTerminated: OLB Oshane Ximines, DE Tashawn Bower, DT Brandin Bryant, CB Amani Oruwariye, OT Korey Cunningham, OT Julien Davenport, OL Sean Harlow, WR Cole Beasley, WR David Sills, WR Jamison Crowder, WR Jaydon Mickens\n\nReserve/injured: WR Bryce Ford-Wheaton, TE Chris Myarick\n\nReserve/non-football: TE Tommy Sweeney\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles\n\nBiggest move: Releasing punter Arryn Siposs. He returned from a leg injury for the Super Bowl but a wayward punt led to a key 65-yard Kansas City Chiefs return that set up a game-swaying touchdown. He competed with rookie Ty Zentner during camp. Both players have since been let go. While the Eagles are keeping open the idea of bringing Siposs back, they're exploring their options and could be making a change at a key special teams spot. -- Tim McManus\n\nTraded: Acquired TE Albert Okwuegbunam from Denver\n\nWaived/released: WR Devon Allen, LB Quinton Bell, QB Ian Book, RB Kennedy Brooks, DT Robert Cooper, WR Britain Covey, CB Mekhi Garner, G Julian Good-Jones, WR Jadon Haselwood, DE Tarron Jackson, TE Tyree Jackson, LB Kyron Johnson, WR Johnny King, LB Tyreek Maddox-Williams, S Tristin McCollum, LB Nicholas Morrow, WR Joseph Ngata, DE Janarius Robinson, G Tyrese Robinson, TE Brady Russell, DT Olive Sagapolu, DT Caleb Sanders, CB Josiah Scott, G Josh Sills, P Arryn Siposs, WR Freddie Swain, LB Ben VanSumeren, S K'Von Wallace, WR Greg Ward, DT Marvin Wilson\n\nWaived/injured: RB Trey Sermon, WR Tyrie Cleveland\n\nReserve/suspended: CB Isaiah Rodgers\n\nWashington Commanders\n\nBiggest move: The Commanders did not have any big surprises, but they did keep 11 defensive linemen -- one more than anticipated at the start of training camp. It also meant keeping four linebackers -- but that position also was impacted by having secondary depth and multiple players who can fill a hybrid safety/linebacker role. Keeping 11 linemen means they have seven defensive ends, including rookies KJ Henry (fifth round) and Andre Jones Jr. (seventh round). With their top five defensive ends all entering the last year of their contract, Washington needs younger and cheaper depth. They did cut two players who likely will be re-signed in fullback/tight end Alex Armah and center Tyler Larsen. -- John Keim\n\nWaived/released: WR/R Kazmeir Allen, OL Tyler Larsen, DE Will Bradley-King, OL Alex Akingbulu, DT Abdullah Anderson, TE/FB Alex Armah, T Jaryd Jones-Smith, G Nolan Laufenberg, DT Benning Potoa'e, S Kendall Smith, WR Brycen Tremayne, CB Jace Whittaker, S Terrell Burgess, RB Derrick Gore, CB Rachad Wildgoose, QB Jake Fromm, OL Mason Brooks, CB Nick Whiteside II, LB De'Jon Harris, CB Tariq Castro-Fields, WR Zion Bowens, LB Milo Eifler, CB DaMarcus Fields, LB Ferrod Gardner, S Joshua Kalu, WR Marcus Kemp, DT Isaiah Mack, DT Anthony Montalvo, T/G Aaron Monteiro, RB Jaret Patterson, DE Joshua Pryor, CB DJ Stirgus\n\nReserve/suspended: OT Braeden Daniels, RB Jonathan Williams, WR Kyric McGowan, TE Brandon Dillon, TE Kaden Smith\n\nNFC North\n\nChicago Bears\n\nBiggest move: Tyson Bagent, a product of Division II Shepherd University, made Chicago's initial 53-man roster. Bears coach Matt Eberflus described the competition for the backup quarterback job as one created by the rookie UDFA in practices and preseason games, and it led him to beat out veterans PJ Walker and Nathan Peterman for a spot on the active roster. Eberflus would not name Bagent as the undisputed QB2 for Chicago's Week 1 game against Green Bay, and it appears the Bears will use their No. 1 spot in the waiver order to explore adding an experienced quarterback to work with Fields and Bagent. \"That's certainly a good thought, when you can have somebody with experience in there to help younger quarterbacks,\" Eberflus said. \"It's certainly something we've talked about.\" -- Courtney Cronin\n\nWaived/released: LB Micah Baskerville, DL Travis Bell, FB Robert Burns, TE Stephen Carlson, DB Macon Clark, OL Kellen Diesch, OL Dieter Eiselen, LB DeMarquis Gates, DL Trevis Gipson, DL Jalen Harris, OL Robert Haskins, DL D'Anthony Jones, OL Josh Lugg, OL Roy Mbaeteka, DB Michael Ojemudia, TE Lachlan Pitts, DL Bravvion Roy, OL Logan Stenberg, LB Davion Taylor, DB Bralen Trahan, DB Kindle Vildor, LB, Barrington Wade, LB Mykal Walker, DB Kendall Williamson\n\nReleased: DL Andrew Brown, OL Aviante Collins, WR Daurice Fountain, QB Nathan Peterman, DB Greg Stroman, WR Nsimba Webster\n\nReserve/injured: WR Isaiah Ford\n\nWaived/injured: RB Trestan Ebner\n\nDetroit Lions\n\nBiggest move: The Lions surprised many by activating cornerback Emmanuel Moseley off the PUP list. He will now open the season on the active roster and will be eligible to play on opening day. Moseley continues to recover from a torn ACL in his left knee suffered last season with the San Francisco 49ers. He had a setback prior to training camp when he underwent a follow-up surgery that required him to report late. He is expected to add depth to the secondary. -- Eric Woodyard\n\nWaived/released: WR Chase Cota, RB Jermar Jefferson, TE Darrell Daniels, RB Craig Reynolds, RB Benny Snell Jr., WR Maurice Alexander, G Kayode Awosika, S Brady Breeze, C Brad Cecil, WR Dylan Drummond, DL Cory Durden, T Connor Galvin, S Brandon Joseph, CB Chase Lucas, QB Adrian Martinez, LB Trevor Nowaske, T Max Pircher, K John Parker Romo, DL Chris Smith, T Ryan Swoboda, CB Starling Thomas V.\n\nReserve/suspended: WR Jameson Williams.\n\nReserve/injured: QB Nate Sudfeld.\n\nReserve/NFI: QB Hendon Hooker.\n\nGreen Bay Packers\n\nBiggest move: The official average ages of team rosters won't be set until the NFL sees who's actually on the 53s for Week 1, but we don't need to wait to know that the Packers will be one of the youngest. By releasing punter Pat O'Donnell, who, at age 32, had been the oldest player on the team, earlier this week, the Packers now have only three players whose ages start with the number the 3 -- David Bakhtiari (31), Preston Smith (30) and De'Vondre Campbell (30). By comparison, last season, the Packers had eight players 30 or older, including quarterback Aaron Rodgers and tight end Marcedes Lewis (both now 39) plus kicker Mason Crosby (now 38). The initial roster included 11 of the 13 picks from this year's draft and three undrafted rookies. There will be more moves to come on Wednesday, given that they don't have a long-snapper on the roster. They plan to re-sign Matt Orzech but needed a spot for someone (perhaps offensive lineman Luke Tenuta or receiver Dontayvion Wicks) to carry for a day and then place on injured reserve with the ability to turn. -- Rob Demovsky\n\nWaived/released: TE Austin Allen, CB Corey Ballentine, LB Keshawn Banks, WR Jadakis Bonds , WR Cody Chrest, T Jean Delance, WR Grant DuBose, C James Empey, CB Tyrell Ford, S Innis Gaines, CB Elijah Hamilton, CB William Hooper, CB Shemar Jean-Charles, DL Jason Lewan, RB Nate McCrary, QB Alex McGough, WR Bo Melton, WR Dre Miller, LB Arron Mosby, DL Antonio Moultrie, LB Kenneth Odumegwu, LS Matt Orzech, FB Henry Pearson, LB Jimmy Phillips Jr., LB Marvin Pierre, S Benny Sapp III, C Cole Schneider, DL Chris Slayton, RB Patrick Taylor, T Kadeem Telfort, CB Kiondre Thomas, WR Duece Watts\n\nWaived/injured: RB Tyler Goodson, LS Broughton Hatcher, RB Lew Nichols\n\nInjured reserve: S Tarvarius Moore\n\nPhysically unable to perform: CB Eric Stokes\n\nMinnesota Vikings\n\nBiggest move: Keeping only three running backs. We know that Alexander Mattison is going to be the primary runner, but there are only two tailbacks behind him -- and one is injured. Ty Chandler had a decent preseason, but Kene Nwangwu missed almost all of training camp because of an undisclosed injury. It's very reasonable to think the Vikings will add at least one running back in the coming days. -- Kevin Seifert\n\nTraded: OT Vederian Lowe\n\nWaived/released: OL Alan Ali, DL Calvin Avery, CB Kalon Barnes, LB Abraham Beauplan, DL Ross Blacklock, CB C.J. Coldon Jr., WR Jacob Copeland, DL Sheldon Day, OL Christian DiLauro, RB Aaron Dykes, S Jake Gervase, CB Tay Gowan, CB Jameson Houston, LB Wilson Huber, WR Lucky Jackson, WR Trishton Jackson, RB DeWayne McBride, WR Garett Maag, DL Esezi Otomewo, WR Blake Proehl, LB Troy Reeder, TE Ben Sims, RB Abram Smith, OL Josh Sokol, DL T.J. Smith, G Jack Snyder, QB Jordan Ta'amu, WR Thayer Thomas, TE Colin Thompson, LB Tanner Vallejo, LB Luiji Vilain, LB Benton Whitley, OT Jarrid Williams, CB Jaylin Williams, CB Joejuan Williams.\n\nReserve/non-football injury: OL Chris Reed\n\nNFC South\n\nAtlanta Falcons\n\nBiggest move: The Falcons' most intriguing move might have been at tight end, where they kept John FitzPatrick over Parker Hesse, who was a stalwart as a blocking tight end last year. Add in waiving defensive tackle Timmy Horne -- who started five games last year -- it proved coach Arthur Smith's statement of having a hard 53-man roster to make to be true. -- Michael Rothstein\n\nWaived/released: FB Clint Ratkovich, RB Godwin Igwebuike, RB Carlos Washington Jr., WR Keilahn Harris, WR J.J. Arcega-Whiteside, WR Zay Malone, WR Slade Bolden, WR Mathew Sexton, TE Parker Hesse, TE Tucker Fisk, OL Jalen Mayfield, OL Jonotthan Harrison, OL Michal Menet, OL Barry Wesley, OL Trevor Reid, OL Tyler Vrabel, OL Justin Shaffer, DL Delontae Scott, DL LaCale London, DL Justin Ellis, DT Carlos Davis, DL Caeveon Patton, DL Timmy Horne, DL Demone Harris, LB Frank Ginda, LB Andre Smith, LB Kemoko Turay, LB Mike Jones Jr., CB Darren Hall, CB Bless Austin, CB Breon Borders, CB Natrone Brooks, S Lukas Denis, S Micah Abernathy, S Cliff Chattman\n\nReserve/injured: WR Penny Hart, CB Cornell Armstrong\n\nCarolina Panthers\n\nBiggest move: The decision to release Pro Bowl inside linebacker Deion Jones less than a month after signing him to a one-year deal was the biggest surprise, but the decision to keep five tight ends was the most significant. Coach Frank Reich has said repeatedly he loves his tight end room, and history shows tight ends play a big role in his offense. But to keep five -- Hayden Hurst, Ian Thomas, Tommy Tremble, Giovanni Ricci and Stephen Sullivan -- says Reich wasn't blowing smoke about the room and the contributions he expects them to make. -- David Newton\n\nTraded: Swapped conditional seventh-round pick in 2025 to the Kansas City Chiefs for WR Ihmir Smith-Marsette.\n\nWaived/released: OT Cameron Erving, CB Greg Mabin, DT Taylor Stallworth, WR Shi Smith, WR Josh Vann, OL Justin McCray, OL Sam Tecklenburg, DL Raequan Williams, LB Brandon Smith, LB Deion Jones, LB Jordan Thomas, LB Ace Eley, S Eric Rowe, CB Keith Taylor Jr., DB Herb Miller, CB Mac McCain III, RB Spencer Brown, CB Mark Milton, OL J.D. DiRenzo, WR Javin Wims, DE Eku Leota, CB Stantley Thomas-Oliver III, OL Deonte Brown, OL Michael Jordan, DE Kobe Jones, QB Jake Luton, RB Camerun Peoples, WR Gary Jennings, WR C.J. Saunders, OT Larnel Coleman, DL Antwuan Jackson, LB Bumper Pool, S Collin Duncan, S Josh Thomas, CB Rejzohn Wright, K Matthew Wright.\n\nReserve/suspended: OG Austin Corbett placed on reserve/PUP list; DE Henry Anderson on IR\n\nNew Orleans Saints\n\nBiggest move: The Saints are taking some gambles with their specialists after parting ways with veteran kicker Wil Lutz and punter Blake Gillikin in exchange for rookies Blake Grupe and Lou Hedley. They also had some other surprises: Releasing veteran slot cornerback Bradley Roby (with Alontae Taylor likely taking the slot role) and keeping all seven of their draft picks. The Saints are also keeping 36-year-old tight end Jimmy Graham after he had two significant contested catches in the final preseason game. That means the Saints will have to find him a role with Taysom Hill, Foster Moreau and Juwan Johnson also in that room. -- Katherine Terrell\n\nTraded: K Wil Lutz\n\nWaived/released: LB Ryan Connelly, TE J.P. Holtz, TE Jesse James, T Storm Norton, CB Bradley Roby, LB Jaylon Smith, LB Ty Summers, RB Darrel Williams, S Johnathan Abram, LB Nick Anderson, WR Kawaan Baker, FB Jake Bargas, WR Lynn Bowden Jr., DL Jerron Cage, WR Shaq Davis, DT Prince Emili, OL Mark Evans II, G Chuck Filiaga, DB Adrian Frye, P Blake Gillikin, DT Jack Heflin, DB Anthony Johnson, OL Lewis Kidd, WR Jontre Kirklin, G Tommy Kraemer, TE Lucas Krull, DE Niko Lalos, RB Ellis Merriweather, S Smoke Monday, LB Anfernee Orji, DE Kyle Phillips, OL Alex Pihlstrom, DB Troy Pride Jr., OL Calvin Throckmorton\n\nReserve/suspended: RB Alvin Kamara\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nBiggest move: A total of 13 rookies made the 53-man roster with six of those spots claimed by undrafted free agents, the most undrafted free agents to make a 53-man roster under general manager Jason Licht. The team has also gone from one of the oldest in the NFL last season to one of the youngest. Let the youth movement begin. -- Jenna Laine\n\nWaived/released: WR Taye Barber, LB Brandon Bouyer-Randle, DL C.J. Brewer, RB Ronnie Brown, LS Evan Deckers, OL Silas Dzansi, WR Kaylon Geiger, OL Luke Haggard, CB Keenan Isaac, WR Cephus Johnson, S Richard LeCounte III, WR Ryan Miller, OL John Molchon, OL Michael Niese, OL Raiqwon O'Neal, DL Willington Previlon, OLB Jose Ramirez, OLB Hamilcar Rashed, LB J.J.

In trading Lance, San Francisco admitted it made a colossal mistake in trading three first-round and one third-round pick to move up to select Lance in 2021. It also gave Lance a fresh start in Dallas after he dropped to No. 3 on the Niners' depth chart. The long-term ramifications for Lance and the Niners remain to be seen, but San Francisco is hoping Brock Purdy continues to defy the odds and stabilizes the position for the foreseeable future. -- Nick Wagoner\n\nWaived/released: CB Nate Brooks, DL La'Darius Hamilton, DL Breeland Speaks, DL Spencer Waege, LB Kyahva Tezino, WR Tay Martin, DB Qwuantrezz Knight, FB Jack Colletto, OL Corey Luciano, DL Alex Barrett, DL Marlon Davidson, OL Joey Fisher, TE Troy Fumagalli, OL Alfredo Gutierrez, DB Myles Hartsfield, RB Brian Hill, OL Keith Ismael, WR Anthony Miller, OL Jason Poe, DB Tre Swilling, OL Leroy Watson IV, WR Isaiah Winstead, OL Ilm Manning, WR Chris Conley, DE Austin Bryant, DL Kerry Hyder Jr., RB Jeremy McNichols, DT T.Y.

The more significant development from cut-down day was something the Seahawks didn't do -- add depth to their defensive line. General manager John Schneider is no stranger to trades this time of year. That led to some thought that Seattle would add someone up front, at least a rotational piece to play behind Dre'Mont Jones, Jarran Reed and Mario Edwards Jr. That addition could -- and should -- still come via a waiver claim or another move between now and the Sept. 10 opener. -- Brady Henderson\n\nWaived/released: QB Holton Ahlers, OLB Levi Bell, CB Lance Boykin, T Greg Eiland, NT Matt Gotel, WR John Hall, WR Cade Johnson, WR Matt Landers, TE Tyler Mabry, LB Patrick O'Connell, S Ty Okada, DE Roderick Perry, G Kendall Randolph, DE Jacob Sykes, RB SaRodorick Thompson Jr., WR Easop Winston Jr., LB Christian Young, LB Ben Burr-Kirven, C Joey Hunt\n\nWaived with injury designation: S Joey Blount, S Jonathan Sutherland, LB Vi Jones\n\nPlaced on Reserve/PUP list: NT Bryan Mone, NT Austin Faoliu\n\nPlaced on Reserve/Suspended list: WR Dee Eskridge\n\nLos Angeles Rams\n\nBiggest move: Cutting offensive lineman Logan Bruss is a major declaration of defeat. Bruss was a third-round pick in the 2022 draft, selected No. 104 overall, with the expectation he would be an early contributor before tearing his ACL and MCL in the second preseason game and missing all of his rookie season. The whiff on Bruss, who moved to right tackle in training camp after failing to adjust to playing guard, is another setback for a depleted roster that is in rebuilding mode. -- Daniel Greenspan\n\nWaived/released: QB Brett Rypien, RB Royce Freeman, DL Marquise Copeland, OT AJ Arcuri, K Tanner Brown, OL Logan Bruss, DE TJ Carter, OLB Daniel Hardy, DB Quindell Johnson, TE Nikola Kalinic, OL Mike McAllister, DB Cameron McCutcheon, OL Grant Miller, DB Robert Rochell, WR Xavier Smith, OLB Keir Thomas, WR Austin Trammell, QB Dresser Winn, LB Jaiden Woodbey, LB DeAndre Square, DB Rashad Torrence II, LB Kelechi Anyalebechi, WR Braxton Burmeister, DB Timarcus Davis, DB Tyon Davis, DB Vincent Gray, DB Tanner Ingle, DB Jordan Jones, OL Sean Maginn, WR Lance McCutcheon, TE Camren McDonald, TE Christian Sims, LB Ryan Smenda Jr., DT Taron Vincent, WR Tyler Johnson\n\nArizona Cardinals\n\nBiggest move: The Cardinals are carrying just two quarterbacks for now, going with rookie Clayton Tune, a fifth-round pick, and veteran Joshua Dobbs, whom they traded for last week. If Arizona wants to have a third quarterback active on game day, which new NFL rules now allow, they'll have to carry a third on the 53-man roster. Tight end Noah Togiai had an impressive camp but was let go and long snapper Aaron Brewer, who had been with the Cardinals since 2016 and was part of their most stable position group for years, was also released. -- Josh Weinfuss\n\nTraded: S Isaiah Simmons, OL Josh Jones\n\nWaived/released: LB David Anenih, WR Andre Baccellia, DL Eric Banks, OL Jackson Barton, QB David Blough, LS Aaron Brewer, S Kendell Brooks, OL Cohl Cabral, S Andre Chachere, RB Corey Clement, WR Brian Cobbs, WR Davion Davis, WR Kaden Davis, QB Jeff Driskel, TE Joel Honigford, OL Hayden Howerton, S JuJu Hughes, OL Braylon Jones, DL Rashard Lawrence, LB Zach McCloud, CB Bobby Price, RB Stevie Scott, TE Bernhard Seikovits, DL Jacob Slade, WR Brandon Smith, OL Lecitus Smith, LB Kyle Soelle, TE Noah Togiai, OL Badara Traore, CB Quavian White, RB Ty'Son Williams, S Sean Chandler, CB Nate Hairston, QB Colt McCoy\n\nReserve/PUP: QB Kyler Murray\n\nReserve/NFI: CB Garrett Williams\n\nInjured reserve: OL Jon Gaines II\n\nWaived/injured: CB Kyler McMichael, OL Pat Elflein\n\nAFC East\n\nBuffalo Bills\n\nBiggest move:The biggest moves came on the defensive line with Von Miller officially staying on PUP and the Bills trading 2021 second-round pick Boogie Basham to the Giants. Miller continues to recover from an ACL tear in his right knee with a priority on him getting healthy for the long haul. Moving on from a young pass rusher like Basham, the Bills are showing confidence in AJ Epenesa, who has one year left on his rookie deal, Kingsley Jonathan and veteran Shaq Lawson, along with any potential additions, to provide a solid rotations with starters Greg Rousseau and Leonard Floyd in Miller's absence. -- Alaina Getzenberg\n\nTraded: DE Boogie Basham\n\nWaived/released: RB Ty Johnson, RB Darrynton Evans, RB Jordan Mims, WR Tyrell Shavers, WR Andy Isabella, WR Isaiah Coulter, WR Bryan Thompson, WR Marcell Ateman, WR Dezmon Patmon, WR KeeSean Johnson, TE Joel Wilson, TE Jace Sternberger, OT Garrett McGhin, OL David Quessenberry, OL Greg Mancz, OL Ike Boettger, OL Kevin Jarvis, OL Nick Broeker, OL Richard Gouraige, LB A.J. Klein, LB Travin Howard, LB DaShaun White, DT Cortez Broughton, DT Eli Ankou, DT Kendall Vickers, DT DJ Dale, DE Kameron Cline, CB Alex Austin, CB Kyron Brown, CB Ja'Marcus Ingram, S Jared Mayden, S Zayne Anderson, S Dean Marlowe, LS Reid Ferguson\n\nReserve/PUP: DE Von Miller\n\nInjured Reserve: QB Matt Barkley\n\nNew York Jets\n\nBiggest move: It was a ho-hum roster cutdown for the Jets -- no surprises. The only noteworthy cut was RB Zonovan Knight, who started four games last season as an undrafted rookie. In fact, he rushed for 230 yards over a three-game span, looking like a keeper. In the end, the Aug. 14 signing of Dalvin Cook gave them one too many running backs. Knight, who had ball-security issues in the preseason, lost out to Michael Carter for the RB3 job. Cook and Breece Hall top the depth chart. Rookie Israel Abanikanda sticks as the RB4. P Thomas Morstead was released, but he's expected to re-sign -- a case of roster gymnastics. -- Rich Cimini\n\nWaived/released: DE Deslin Alexandre, FB Nick Bawden, QB Tim Boyle, LB Claudin Cherelus, C Trystan Colon, S Trey Dean, RB Travis Dye, LB Sam Eguavoen, WR Alex Erickson, G Chris Glaser, DT Bruce Hector, OT Grant Hermanns, DE Jalyn Holmes, S Craig James, TE E.J. Jenkins, LB Caleb Johnson, WR Jerome Kapp, RB Zonovan Knight, TE Zack Kuntz, G Brent Laing, CB Derrick Langford, WR T.J. Luther, P Thomas Morstead, G Adam Pankey, OL Greg Senat, CB Nehemiah Shelton, DT Tanzel Smart, DT Marquiss Spencer, LB Pita Taumoepenu, WR Malik Taylor, LB Nick Vigil, S Marquis Waters.\n\nReserve/injured: CB Jimmy Moreland.\n\nPhysically unable to perform: S Jarrick Bernard-Converse\n\nReserve/suspended: CB Brandin Echols\n\nMiami Dolphins\n\nBiggest move: Can a move they didn't make qualify here? After a week of speculation, the Dolphins did not end up trading for Colts running back Jonathan Taylor, opting to keep their faith in Raheem Mostert, Jeff Wilson, Jr., and De'Von Achane. Miami also traded former first-round pick Noah Igbinoghene, cutting ties with the cornerback after he played in 32 games in three seasons. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques\n\nTraded: OL Dan Feeney, CB Noah Igbinoghene\n\nWaived/released: OT Geron Christian, WR Keke Coutee and LB A.J. Johnson. LB Mitchell Agude, QB James Blackman, DT Josiah Bronson, DE Randy Charlton, WR Chris Coleman, LB Aubrey Miller II, LB Garrett Nelson, S Keidron Smith, OT James Tunstall, DT Jaylen Twyman, DT Jamal Woods, CB Justin Bethel, WR Robbie Chosen, RB Myles Gaskin, DT Da'Shawn Hand, TE Tyler Kroft, CB Parry Nickerson, OT Cedric Ogbuehi, DB Jamal Perry, LB Malik Reed, CB Ethan Bonner, TE Tanner Conner, LB Cameron Goode, OT Ryan Hayes, TE Elijah Higgins, WR Braylon Sanders, CB Bryce Thompson, OL Alama Uluave, WR Daewood Davis and CB Trill Williams\n\nReserve/suspended: CB Nik Needham, TE Eric Saubert, CB Keion Crossen\n\nNew England Patriots\n\nBiggest move:Waiving backup QBs Bailey Zappe and Malik Cunningham, which leaves Mac Jones as the lone signal-caller on the roster -- for now. Zappe had struggled at times in training camp and preseason games, but part of that seemed to be related to a depleted offensive line in front of him. Zappe could still potentially return on the practice squad if he isn't claimed on waivers, but the Patriots' decision to expose him to the rest of the NFL speaks volumes of their view that they want an upgrade behind Jones. -- Mike Reiss\n\nTraded: K Nick Folk\n\nWaived/released: S Joshuah Bledsoe, QB/WR Malik Cunningham, LB Diego Fagot, C/G James Ferentz, TE Anthony Firkser, LB Joe Giles-Harris, RB Kevin Harris, S Brad Hawkins, G Chasen Hines, TE Johnny Lumpkin, RB CJ Marable, QB Trace McSorley, RB Ty Montgomery II, DB Quandre Mosely, LB Calvin Munson, OL Bill Murray, OLB Ronnie Perkins, DT Jeremiah Pharms Jr., WR Thyrick Pitts, CB Rodney Randle Jr., C/G Kody Russey, TE Matt Sokol, T/G Andrew Stueber, DT Justus Tavai, RB J.J. Taylor, OL Micah Vanterpool, P Corliss Waitman, TE Scotty Washington, WR Raleigh Webb, LB Carson Wells, QB Bailey Zappe\n\nInjured reserve: CB Isaiah Bolden, OL Conor McDermott\n\nAFC North\n\nBaltimore Ravens\n\nBiggest move: The Ravens stick with Tyler Huntley as the primary backup for the third straight year after cutting Josh Johnson and Anthony Brown. Baltimore wanted to bring in competition for Huntley this offseason after he struggled last season and made the costly fumble in the wild-card playoff loss in Cincinnati. The Ravens eventually went with Johnson, who started all three preseason games for the Ravens and completed 72.7% of his passes (24-of-33) this summer with four touchdowns and one interception. But Huntley was the more consistent quarterback throughout training camp. He tweaked his hamstring in the preseason opener, but team officials believe he'll be ready for the season opener. -- Jamison Hensley\n\nWaived/released: QB Josh Johnson, QB Anthony Brown, RB Melvin Gordon, WR Laquon Treadwell, DE Brent Urban, DT Angelo Blackson, OT David Sharpe, DB Daryl Worley, DT Trey Botts III, DT Kaieem Caesar, WR Dontay Demus Jr., G Jake Guidone, S DeAndre Houston-Carson, CB Corey Mayfield Jr., OLB Kelle Sanders, WR Tarik Black, G TyKeem Doss, CB Tae Hayes, CB Kyu Kelly, CB Jeremy Lucien, G Tashawn Manning, FB Ben Mason, OLB Jeremiah Moon, C Sam Mustipher, DT Rayshad Nichols, WR James Proche III, LB Josh Ross, WR Sean Ryan, CB Kevon Seymour, OL Jaylon Thomas, TE Travis Vokolek, ILB Kristian Welch, RB Owen Wright\n\nWaived/injured: WR Shemar Bridges\n\nNon-Football Injury: OLB Tyus Bowser, LS Nick Moore, G Andrew Vorhees\n\nCincinnati Bengals\n\nBiggest move: After being on the practice squad the past two years, QB Jake Browning has won the back-up quarterback job. Browning beat out veteran Trevor Siemian, who signed a 1-year deal this offseason but struggled throughout the preseason. In three exhibition games, he completed 71.1% of his passes for 316 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. Cincinnati is still awaiting the return of starter Joe Burrow, who is recovering from a strained right calf. Bengals coach Zac Taylor said he feels \"really good\" about Browning as Cincinnati's primary backup for the 2023 season. -- Ben Baby\n\nWaived/released: TE Tanner Hudson, CB Sidney Jones IV, WR Stanley Morgan, QB Trevor Siemian, WR Trent Taylor, S Michael Thomas, OT Hakeem Adeniji, TE Devin Asiasi, TE Nick Bowers, S Larry Brooks, G Ben Brown, DE Owen Carney, WR Malachi Carter, P Drue Chrisman, S Yusuf Corker, DT Domenique Davis, CB Allan George, C Nate Gilliam, DE Jeff Gunter, LB Shaka Heyward, WR Mac Hippenhammer, WR Shedrick Jackson, DE Raymond Johnson III, LB Keandre Jones, G Jaxson Kirkland, WR Kwamie Lassiter II, LB Jaylen Moody\n\nReserve/injured: DT Tautala Pesefea Jr., CB Marvell Tell\n\nCleveland Browns\n\nBiggest move: After Cade York struggled throughout preseason, the Browns made a move at kicker, trading for Dustin Hopkins in a deal with the Chargers before waiving York. It was a stunning fall for York, who was a fourth-round pick of the Browns just last year. York, however, missed three potential game-winning field goal attempts in Cleveland's final two preseason games, effectively sealing his fate after a rocky rookie year. -- Jake Trotter\n\nTraded: OT Tyrone Wheatley Jr., QB Joshua Dobbs\n\nWaived/released: CB Caleb Biggers, LB Cam Bright, TE Miller Forristall, TE Thomas Greaney, CB Gavin Heslop, OT Derrick Kelly II, S Nate Meadors, WR Anthony Schwartz (injury WR Jalen Wayne, G Colby Gossett, RB Jordan Wilkins, G Wes Martin, CB Lorenzo Burns, WR Jaelon Darden, RB/WR Demetric Felton Jr., RB Hassan Hall, WR Mike Harley Jr., DE Sam Kamara, DE Jeremiah Martin, S Tanner McCalister, TE Zaire Mitchell-Paden, QB Kellen Mond, DE Lonnie Phelps, LB Charlie Thomas III, DE Isaiah Thomas, DT Tommy Togiai, WR Austin Watkins Jr., K Cade York, G Michael Dunn, DT Trysten Hill, DT Maurice Hurst II, RB John Kelly Jr.\n\nReserve/injured: WR Jakeem Grant Sr., G Drew Forbes, WR Michael Woods II\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\n\nBiggest move: Steelers general manager Omar Khan shipped offensive linemen Kevin Dotson to the Los Angeles Rams and Kendrick Green to the Houston Texans, turning a superfluous depth piece and a cut candidate into future draft capital. The Steelers swapped picks with Rams to get a 2024 fourth rounder and a 2025 fifth rounder. And for Green, the Steelers gained a 2025 sixth-round pick. Because of Khan's emphasis on revamping the offensive line group in the last two seasons with additions including G Isaac Seumalo, OT Broderick Jones, OL Nate Herbig, C Mason Cole and G James Daniels, Dotson and Green weren't in line for much, if any, playing time in 2023, further speaking to the quality positional depth built by the organization. -- Brooke Pryor\n\nTraded: OL Kevin Dotson, OL Kendrick Green\n\nWaived/released: CB Luq Barcoo, CB Chris Wilcox, DL Breiden Fehoko, DL Jonathan Marshall, LB Nick Kwiatkoski, LB David Perales, LB Quincy Roche, OL Ryan McCollum, RB Greg Bell, RB Xazavian Valladay, S Trenton Thompson, S Tre Norwood, TE Zach Gentry, TE Rodney Williams, WR Jordan Byrd, WR Dez Fitzpatrick, CB, Lavert Hill, DL Manny Jones, LB Tanner Muse, LB Toby Ndukwe, OL Le'Raven Clark, OL William Dunkle, QB Tanner Morgan, RB Darius Hagans, S Jalen Elliott, S Kenny Robinson, WR Aron Cruickshank, CB Madre Harper, DB Nevelle Clarke, DL James Nyamwaya, K B.T. Potter, LB Kuony Deng, LB Forrest Rhyne, LS Rex Sunahara, WR Dan Chisena\n\nAFC South\n\nHouston Texans\n\nBiggest move: Cutting nickel cornerback Desmond King. The veteran defensive back started 25 games over the last two seasons and ran with the starting unit for most of training camp while starting each preseason game. Last season, King was tied for first in tackles for loss (10) and pass deflections (8) on the Texans. -- DJ Bien-Aime\n\nTraded: 2025 sixth-round pick to the Steelers for OL Kendrick Green.\n\nReleased: CB Desmond King II, LB Christian Kirksey, DE Chase Winovich, DE Ali Gaye,DT Khalil Davis, WR Jalen Camp, TE Eric Tomlinson, DT Byron Cowart, WR Jared Wayne, DT Thomas Booker IV, OT Austin Deculus, LB Garret Wallow, OL Keaton Sutherland, CB Cobi Francis, DT Roy Lopez, OT Rashaad Coward, OL Tyler Beach, TE Mason Schreck , DB Darius Joiner, TE Nick Vannett, RB Larry Rountree III, P Ty Zentner, LB Cory Littleton, C\n\nIndianapolis Colts\n\nBiggest move: Moving running back Jonathan Taylor to the reserve/physically unable to perform list was the most consequential decision for the Colts, because it eliminates any possibility of the All-Pro running back playing in the first four games of the regular season. Taylor had been the subject of a week's worth of trade talks entering Tuesday, with the Colts ultimately declining multiple offers. That leaves the Colts with rookie Evan Hull, Deon Jackson and Zack Moss at running back for the time being. -- Stephen Holder\n\nWaived/released: WR Tyler Adams, WR Kody Case, G Emil Ekiyor, TE Nick Eubanks, K Lucas Havrisik, TE Michael Jacobson, T Matthew Vanderslice; RB Kenyan Drake, S Teez Tabor, LB Liam Anderson, S Henry Black, S Marcel Dabo, RB Jake Funk, RB Jason Huntley, DE Khalid Kareem, WR D.J. Montgomery, LB Donavan Mutin, WR Amari Rodgers, CB Darius Rush, DT Caleb Sampson, C Dakoda Shepley, WR Mike Strachan, CB Isaac Taylor-Stuart, CB Kevin Toliver, TE Pharaoh Brown, S Ronnie Harrison Jr., DE Al-Quadin Muhammad, WR Breshad Perriman, T Dan Skipper, WR Vyncint Smith, WR James Washington, WR Juwann Winfree.\n\nReserve/suspended: CB Chris Lammons\n\nReserve/physically unable to perform list: RB Jonathan Taylor\n\nInjured reserve: JoJo Domann, Titus Leo, Danny Pinter, Ricky Seals-Jones\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\n\nBiggest move: The Jaguars surprisingly kept seven receivers. In addition to Tim Jones they kept undrafted rookie free agent Elijah Cooks to go along with Calvin Ridley, Christian Kirk, Zay Jones, Jamal Agnew and sixth-round pick Parker Washington. Teams generally have only five receivers active on game day, and the fifth one is usually a special teams player. That's a role Jones held last season and is likely to continue. The team liked what they saw from the 6-foot-4, 215-pound Cooks -- who caught seven passes for 146 yards in three preseason games -- and didn't want to risk losing him. -- Michael DiRocco\n\nWaived/released: LS Tucker Addington, WR Kevin Austin Jr., S Latavious Brini, OLB DJ Coleman, RB Snoop Conner, OL Coy Cronk, DL DeShaun Dixon, CB Erick Hallett II, OL Blake Hance, WR Jacob Harris, CB Kaleb Hayes, LB Dequan Jackson, OL Samuel Jackson, WR Oliver Martin, K James McCourt, S Ayo Oyelola, TE Derek Parish, TE Josh Pederson, TE Gerrit Prince, WR Kendric Pryor, QB Nathan Rourke, OLB Jordan Smith, OLB Willie Taylor III, DL Raymond Vohasek, OL Darryl Williams, WR Seth Williams, CB Divaad Wilson\n\nWaived/injured: WR Jaray Jenkins\n\nReleased: OL Chandler Brewer, CB Tevaughn Campbell, DL Michael Dogbe, OL Bobby Evans, RB Qadree Ollison\n\nReserve/injured: LB Ventrell Miller, OL Josh Wells\n\nReserve/suspended: LT Cam Robinson\n\nExempt/Commissioner Permission list: CB Chris Claybrooks\n\nTennessee Titans\n\nBiggest move: The Titans started the day without a kicker on the roster. They solved the problem by trading a 2025 seventh-round pick to the Patriots for veteran kicker Nick Folk, giving Tennessee a reliable option to end their dilemma that has seen 13 different kickers since 2019. The Titans have made an NFL-worst 74 field goals in that time span, and their 102 field goal attempts are the fewest. Tennessee has only made 72.5% of its field goal attempts. They're one of two teams lower than 80%. Folk turns 39 in November, and the 16-year veteran made 86.5% of his attempts last season, including four out of five attempts from 50 yards or beyond. -- Turron Davenport\n\nTraded: Acquired K Nick Folk\n\nWaived/released: LB Chance Campbell, DB Shyheim Carter, DT Trevon Coley, DT Michael Dwumfour, CB Eric Garror, WR Tre'Shaun Harrison, DL Jaleel Johnson, CB Steven Jones Jr., S Tyreque Jones, WR Mason Kinsey, OL John Leglue, CB Armani Marsh, DL TK McLendon Jr., WR Racey McMath, TE Jordan Murray, LB Ben Niemann, TE Thomas Odukoya, T John Ojukwu, OLB Sam Okuayinonu, RB Jacques Patrick, DT Kyle Peko, TE Kevin Rader, WR Reggie Roberson Jr., G Jordan Roos, OL Andrew Rupcich, OLB Thomas Rush, NT Tyler Shelvin\n\nReserve/suspended: CB Caleb Farley, RT Nicholas Petit-Frere, RB Hassan Haskins (Commissioner Exempt List)\n\nAFC West\n\nDenver Broncos\n\nBiggest move: The Broncos closed the book on their kicking competition -- for now -- by trading for Wil Lutz on Tuesday. Elliott Fry and Brett Maher opened training camp competing for the job until Fry was injured and then waived. Maher finished the preseason going 4 of 6 in field-goal attempts - one was blocked in the preseason opener in Arizona. The Broncos are banking on the idea that Lutz will return to form. He missed 2021 with a core muscle injury and last season was a career-worst 74.2% on field goal attempts (23 of 31, 8 of 14 on attempts of 40 yards or more). Broncos coach Sean Payton said Lutz had been \"a target'' for the Broncos throughout the preseason. -- Jeff Legwold\n\nTraded: TE Albert Okwuegbunam (to Philadelphia Eagles)\n\nWaived/released: LB Austin Ajiake, RB Tyler Badie, WR Michael Bandy, T Quinn Bailey, LB Seth Benson, G Henry Byrd, WR Marquez Callaway, QB Ben DiNucci, C Kyle Fuller, CB Art Green, WR Taylor Grimes, WR Josh Hammond, OLB Marcus Haynes, CB Faion Hicks, WR Kendall Hinton, CB Delonte Hood, TE Tommy Hudson, WR Lil'Jordan Humphrey, DE Jordan Jackson, T Demontrey Jacobs, RB Tony Jones Jr., CB Devon Key, WR J.J. Koski, DT Tyler Lancaster, DT Tomasi Laulile, K Brett Maher, CB Fabian Moreau, DT PJ Mustipher, DE Haggai Chisom Ndubuisi, T Alex Palczewski, OLB Aaron Patrick, T Isaiah Prince, DT Mike Purcell, T Will Sherman, RB Dwayne Washington, WR Montrell Washington, WR Nick Williams\n\nWaived/injured: OLB Christopher Allen\n\nReserve/Physically Unable to Perform (PUP): OLB Baron Browning\n\nKansas City Chiefs\n\nBiggest move: The Chiefs placed Chris Jones on the did not report list, which is no surprise given that his holdout continues. But the Chiefs are concerned enough about his absence that they were compelled to trade a sixth-round pick to the Raiders for defensive tackle, Neil Farrell Jr. The Chiefs will play their first six games without another top pass-rusher, Charles Omenihu, who is suspended for the first six games. -- Adam Teicher\n\nTraded: WR Ihmir Smith-Marsette\n\nWaived/released: TE Kendall Blanton, CB Dicaprio Bootle, CB Ekow Boye-Doe, QB Shane Buechele, S Deon Bush, TE Matt Bushman, OL Jerome Carvin, LB Cole Christiansen, S Anthony Cook, RB Jerrion Ealy, LB Olakunle Fatukasi, WR Ty Fryfogle, TE Izaiah Gathings, OT Jason Godrick, WR Juwan Green, OL Sebastian Gutierrez, CB Kahlef Hailassie, OL Anderson Hardy, DT Phil Hoskins, CB Lamar Jackson, DE Truman Jones, DE Joshua Kaindoh, OL Darian Kinnard, CB Duron Lowe, S Isaiah Norman, QB Chris Oladokun, RB La'Mical Perine, WR Cornell Powell, RB Deneric Prince, OL Austin Reiter, WR Nikko Remigio, WR Ty Scott, DT Danny Shelton, CB Reese Taylor, DT Chris Williams, DT Daniel Wise\n\nReserve/suspended: DE Charles Omenihu\n\nReserve/did not report: DT Chris Jones\n\nLas Vegas Raiders\n\nBiggest move: Trading defensive tackle Neil Farrell Jr. to the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs for a sixth-round pick. Sending him to a division rival is one thing, but giving up on the third player the regime of GM Dave Ziegler and coach Josh McDaniels had drafted for Las Vegas is another. Plus, D-tackle was a big need for the Raiders last year. But after playing just 158 snaps over nine games as a rookie and finishing with 12 tackles (three solo) with two QB hits and 1.5 stuffs, the former fourth-round pick opened training camp on the Non-Football Injury list. Farrell simply fell too far behind in a crowded DT room. -- Paul Gutierrez\n\nTraded: DT Neil Farrell Jr.\n\nWaived/released: LB Isaac Darkangelo, CB Isiah Brown, DT Doug Costin, CB Bryce Cosby, QB Chase Garbers, G Vitaly Gurman, RB Darwin Thompson, DE David Agoha, DT Matthew Butler, G McClendon Curtis, TE Cole Fotheringham, S Jaydon Grant, CB Tyler Hall, CB Azizi Hearn, LB Kana'i Mauga, RB Sincere McCormick, G Netane Muti, DE Adam Plant, TE John Samuel Shenker, DE George Tarlas, LB Drake Thomas, CB Sam Webb, G Alex Bars, WR Keelan Cole Sr., WR Phillip Dorsett, C Hroniss Grasu, S Jaquan Johnson, DE Isaac Rochell, CB Duke Shelley, WR Cam Sims, RB Damien Williams, DE Jordan Willis\n\nWaived/injured: WR Chris Lacy\n\nWaived from Reserve/Injured: OT Brandon Parker\n\nReserve/injured: RB Brittain Brown, TE Jacob Hollister, WR Isaiah Zuber, LB Darien Butler, CB Jordan Perryman, RB Austin Walter, OT Dalton Wagner\n\nLos Angeles Chargers\n\nBiggest move: In a training camp with few roster spots to be determined and even fewer position battles, it's a kicker that created the biggest roster move. The Chargers traded veteran Dustin Hopkins to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for a 2025 seventh-round pick. Hopkins' season ended in Week 6 of 2022 after he converted four field goals, including a game winner in overtime, despite suffering a hamstring injury early in the game. In Week 9, the Bolts onboarded rookie Cameron Dicker who has proven efficient if not outstanding. He retains the job into his second NFL season and comes at a fraction of Hopkins' salary. -- Lindsey Thiry\n\nTraded: K Dustin Hopkins\n\nWaived/released: OLB Brevin Allen, OT Zack Bailey, S Tyler Baker-Williams, C Johari Branch, CB Cam Brown, WR Terrell Bynum, DL Jerrod Clark, LB Tae Crowder, WR Keelan Doss, QB Max Duggan, LB Nathan East, TE Michael Ezeike, OLB Andrew Farmer, CB Matt Hankins, WR John Hightower, RB Tyler Hoosman, CB Michael Jacquet, LB Mikel Jones, TE Hunter Kampmoyer, OT Matt Kaskey, OLB Carlo Kemp, DL Terrance Lang, LB Blake Lynch, DL David Moa, CB Tiawan Mullen, DL CJ Okoye, OG Austen Pleasants, RB Aaron Shampklin, OLB Ty Shelby, WR Darrius Shepherd, CB Amechi Uzodinma, C Isaac Weaver, DB Mark Webb Jr., WR Pokey Wilson, WR Milton Wright"
