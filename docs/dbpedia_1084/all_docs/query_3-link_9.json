        "text": "A teenager is now the second suspect in custody on charges of murdering Ricky Yates Jr.\n\nBeaumont police say Terrance Moore, 17, was accompanied by his lawyer and surrendered Friday afternoon at the Jefferson County Jail.\n\nLeroy Harris, 42, was jailed Wednesday. Both suspects are charged with murder and JP Ben Collins Sr. set their bonds at $1 million.\n\nYates, 30, was shot multiple times and killed in his home on December 3 in the 3900 block of Bayou Road.\n\nAnyone with information about the crime is asked to call Beaumont Police at 409-832-1234. You can also submit a tip to Southeast Texas Crime Stoppers at 409-833-TIPS(8477) or by downloading the P3 Tips App on your smartphone. All Crime Stoppers tips are anonymous and you may be eligible for a cash reward.\n\nYates' mother, Pamela Harris-Fisher, spoke with KFDM anchor/reporter Mello Styles earlier this week about the arrest of Harris.\n\n\"It gives us a little peace and some justice,\" texted Pamela Yates. \"We will be happier once everyone involved is in custody."
