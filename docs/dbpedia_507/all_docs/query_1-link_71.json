Tatabánya (txt, mp3)\n\n9. Pilis (txt, mp3)\n\n10. Velencei-tó (txt, mp3)\n\n1. Csákvár\n\nCsákvár is a small town with about 5000 residents in Fejér county, not far from the regional capital, Székesfehérvár. Even though it is a relatively small town, it has many attractions:\n\nEszterházy Mansion\n\nIt is one of the most important Hungarian mansions built in the classicist style. The Mansion was used by the Eszterházy family until 1944, and it was critically damaged during the Second World War, and its furnishing disappeared during the Communist era. The mansion was restored in the 1950s, and finally it became a scheduled monument in 1960. Currently, there is a hospital operating in the building. The castle park is one of the best examples of the Hungarian park design and forestry. The history of the park is related to the builder family. Later it was converted into a landscaped garden. The park can be freely visited during the summer time.\n\nMonument of the Heroes\n\nThe town has built this monument to the memory of the fallen heroes of the wars of independence and the two World Wars.\n\nGessner House – Vértes Nature Park Visitor Center\n\nCsákvár’s Gessner House is situated on a piece of land that once belonged to the park of the Esterházy Mansion. It had originally been built as a watermill, but the Esterházy family had it converted into a retreat. Later its stones were carried away and the little lake next to it silted up. The lake has been cleaned and, based on old photos, the building has been restored by the Pro Vértes Public Foundation for Nature Conservation. At present the building, which serves as the centre of the Foundation and the visitor centre of the Vértes Nature Park, performs various functions; it houses offices as well as facilities for research, demonstration and education, and a natural history museum. By surveying the 3D dioramas and the photos of the Vértes Natural History Museum, visitors will easily understand why the Vértes Mountains can rightfully be called ‘a drop of Hungary’, as the region displays all the characteristic features of the Hungarian landscape. Pied wagtails nest under the eaves of Gessner House, and the lake is frequented by mallards, kingfishers, grey herons, great white egrets, grey-legged geese and mute swans. During the winter, eurasian otters can be observed while catching and eating fish. Visitors are advised to start the discovery of the Vértes Mountains in Gessner House, as one can collect all the necessary information there.\n\nBáraczházy Cave\n\nIt is the cave of the Guba Mountain that has become famous for the 8 million years old skeletal remains, which were found in the cave. The cave is 61 meters long, which makes it the third longest cave in the Vértes Mountains.

In the second part of the 1960s, thanks to the works of the forest engineer student Gyula Eőry, spruce, Douglas tree, scots pine and larch stocks were planted here, replacing the former hornbeam, locust and sessile oak trees. The area was later fenced in order to prevent game damage. The transformation of the area into a botanical garden was started in 1978. Special flowers and trees were planted on the sides for their colourful foliage. In the 1980s an ornithological trail was created here as well. In 1985 the general assembly of the FAO Forestry Department was held in Hungary. This is commemorated by the trees that were planted by the ambassadors of the member countries on this occasion.\n\nThe Citadel of Visegrád: The citadel, which can be seen today is not the first castle that was built here. The first castle was built on the foundations of the ancient Roman camp, Sibrik Hill, and it was destroyed during the Mongolian invasion of Europe. The double castle system of Visegrád was built between 1250-1260 by King Béla IV, from the dowry of his wife Queen Mária Laszkarisz. The castle consisted of the defensive walls, two towers and a palace. In the later times King Charles Robert expanded the castle, and the famous “Meeting of the Kings in 1335” took place here. The castle was further developed under King Sigismund of Luxembourg and probably the so called \"Ladies’ House\" was completed at this time as well. The Citadel was connected with the lower castle by a wall, which went down all to the Danube River and ended in a watchtower. The medieval route from Esztergom to Buda ran along this wall, which was closed by a towergate on the northern and a gate on the southern end.\n\nDuring the reign of King Matthias Corvinus the wings of the castle palace were entirely renovated. Hungary’s holy crown was frequently guarded here until 1529. The castle was significantly destroyed during the Turkish rule. It was used by both the Hungarians and the Ottomans alternately, until it was no longer fit for military use. Not only the castle but also the whole city of Visegrád were destroyed, and the repopulation took a long time. The first attempts to renovate the castle took place in the early 1870s and they are still ongoing to this day.\n\n10. Velencei tó"
