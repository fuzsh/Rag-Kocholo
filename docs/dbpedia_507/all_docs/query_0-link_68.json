        "text": "The city of kings served as the kingâs resides and as the coronation city, SzÃ©kesfehÃ©rvÃ¡r is considered as one of the most important cities throughout in Hungary. The downtown is enriched with monuments, cosy houses and squares. Prince GÃ©za founded the city in 972 and later king Saint IstvÃ¡n the First (1000-1038) upraised it to a royal centre. It was the sacred and secular centre of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Its medieval Latin name was Alba Regie meaning of Royal Brightness which refers to its city walls made from white limestone. One of Hungaryâs most significant public collection is guarded in the former Jesuit friery that houses the King IstvÃ¡n the Saint Museum. It exhibits FejÃ©r countyâs relics on a broad scale from the Neolithic ages to the Turkish occupation.On east side of the FÅtÃ©r we can discover the ruins of the Virgin Mary royal church from the Medieval Hungary. The founder of the church was king Saint IstvÃ¡n the First who was buried in the building. Later, proving the churchâs significance, every king was crowned between 1038 and 1543.\n\nAnother popular touristic destination awaits its visitors, the Bory Castle was erected by the sculptor and architect JenÅ Bory. With its seven towers, thirty smaller and larger rooms, three galleries, antiques and work of arts charm tourists.\n\nFurther information: www.szekesfehervar.hu, www.bory-var.hu\n\nPhotos: kepguru.hu."
