        "text": "Székesfehérvár\n\nIn the \"heart\" of Transdanubia, almost halfway between Budapest and Lake Balaton, one of Hungary's most ancient towns, Székesfehérvár, is awaiting visitors.\n\nThe town, which was known by the name Alba Regia during the Middle Ages, had witnessed several glorious historical events over the centuries. The Hungarian kings and their relatives were crowned and buried inside the walls of this town. Székesfehérvár was the site of the royal throne, the crownjewels were treasured there, and people from faraway lands flocked there for the royal assizes.\n\nThe inner town, which is now surrounded by housing estates, has preserved the atmosphere of bygone days. The winding streets which adopt the direction of the medieval routes, the centuries old Baroque palaces, the majestic church towers and the attractive balconies, stoneworks and sculptured ornaments excite admiration from the visitor. Guests strolling about in the centre of Székesfehérvár will soon sense the unique atmosphere of that quarter.\n\nIt appears that nowadays there are more things to feast our eyes on. The renovated historic buildings, the restored sculptures and even the modern streetlighting that was designed to fit in with the atmosphere of the town all indicate that Székesfehérvár is about to become worthy of its old fame again.\n\nGorsium, the \"predecessor\" of Székesfehérvár\n\nThe area of Székesfehérvár has been settled for thousands of years, as it has always been a meeting point for migrating peoples. Archeological discoveries prove that human beings lived nearby the site of the presentday town as early as the Copper Age, and it was also the dwelling ground for men of the Bronze and Early Iron Ages. The area of the town had been marshland for quite a long period, which provided defence for the settlers but hampered the development of the settlement.\n\nIn the Roman Period, flourishing settlements and larger villafarms began mushrooming. Gorsium, the \"predecessor\" of Székesfehérvár, was situated at the ford of the Sárvíz, near the village of Tác some 10 kilometres from the presentday town. It was established by the conquering Roman soldiers in the middle of the 1st century. The military camp there had controlled the ford for some half a century. In the last decades of the 1st century the camp was closed down and Gorsium became the religious centre of the province of Lower Pannonia. During its centuries of prosperity the inhabitants of Gorsium erected huge colonnades, lavish palaces, dazzling sanctuaries and baths.\n\nThe Roman town was destroyed twice by wars but was rebuilt, and each time more magnificently. In the late 5th century the area of the town was used as a burial ground by the Germans and the Avars. The first Magyar settlers established a small village there under the name Föveny, which was destroyed during the Turkish occupation.\n\nMany of the stones of Gorsium were \"revived\" in Székesfehérvár where they were built into the houses of the Arpadian Age town.\n\nThe princely dwellings\n\nHowever, Székesfehérvár was not built on the foundations of Gorsium. Grand Duke Géza had his princely dwellings erected on a mound north of Gorsium, from where he could keep the roads under control. His palace was fortified by ditches and ramparts, and the Creek-style, quatrefoil church, which later served as his tomb, was presumably one of the earliest stone churches in Hungary. The ground plan of this church is marked by coloured flagstones in the square in front of today's episcopal cathedral.\n\nThe town of Stephen I, the founder of the state\n\nAlba Civitas, the name first mentioned by the chronicles in 1009, became one of the most important Hungarian towns during the reign of King Saint Stephen. The founder of the state made Fehérvár the seat of the county, where he had a royal basilica and a provostship erected. These churches were devoted to the Blessed Virgin. The basilica, which was enormous by contemporary standards, is believed to have been 80 metres long, 34 metres wide and more than 50 metres high. Hartvik, the Bishop of Regensburg, had this to say in 1108: \".. its balustrade is decorated by separated carvings, and its floor is covered with marble slabs. Verifying my words could be all those who had a chance to see the innumerable kinds of pails, devotional objects and other jewellery, the pictures made of pure gold and set in bejewelled frames around the altars, the chalice on Christ's Table made with excellent craftsmanship or the treasury of crystals, onyx, gold and silver vessels:'\n\nFor five centuries - from the beginning of the reign of the state's founder till the age of the Turkish occupation - the basilica was the most important building of the medieval Hungarian state. It was the venue of kings' and queens' coronations, the rulers held their weddings there and it also served as the burial site for fifteen Hungarian kings. The basilica housed the royal throne, the crown with the insignia, and the treasury and archives of the state. It was the venue of 46 Parliaments, and the royal assizes drew thousands into the building. The provostship next to the basilica also had its significance. In its prebendal school the rudiments and the so-called free crafts were taught as early as under King Saint Stephen. Bishop Gellert, the famous tutor of Prince lmre, also had a mastership there.\n\nThe glorious centuries\n\nPromoting the development of the town were the facts that pilgrims crossed it on their way to the Holy land, the main trade routes intersected there, the town was the venue of the royal weekly marketsand annual fairs and the central salt depot was also situated there.\n\nThe core of the town, which was formulated under Prince Géza, was extended during the reign of King Saint Stephen. By the 12th century precincts had also been attached to the castrum.\n\nThat was a period of major constructions in Székesfehérvár. The monks who settled in the town and the citizens enriched the town of Alba Regia with splendid churches, convents and residential buildings. In the 12th century a church was erected in honour of St. Dominic, the johannite crusaders built their own church, convent and hospital and large-scale decoration works were undertaken in the basilica. Churches devoted to St. Imre, St. Bartholomew and St. Michael were also erected in that period. (Some of the churches dating from this period, for example, the church of the Holy Cross, have already been uncovered by archeologists).\n\nIn the 13th century construction started on St. Peter's Cathedral, the predecessor of today's episcopal cathedral, near St. Peter's church which was built under Prince Géza. King Béla IV was crowned in St. Peter's Cathedral. The castle walls, the votive chapel of Hentel and the sepulchral chapel of King Matthias were built in the 14th century.\n\nSzékesfehérvár's role declined in the wake of the Mongol invasion. King Béla IV placed the medieval Hungarian state on a new basis and created the country's new capital in Buda.\n\nSzékesfehérvár was less frequented by the kings of Hungary, but the town retained its sacral and cultural significance. The town remained the venue for coronations, and several kings who followed the rulers of the Arpád Dynasty were buried there (Károly I, Lajos the Great, Albert, Matthias, Ulászló II, Lajos II and János Szapolyai).\n\nIn 1543 the strategic town was occupied by the Turks, who remained there for 145 years. During that period the splendid buildings of Istolni Belgrad (the Turkish name for Alba Regia) were turned into djamis and mosques and the graves in the royal basilica were plundered. The church itself was used by the Turks as a powderhouse (it later burnt down as a result of a thunderbolt).\n\nThe Baroque century\n\nGeneral Adám Batthyány, who led the liberating army against the Turks, must have had a hopeless view of the town in 1688; decay, dirt and ruins were all that the one-time conquerors left behind. Parallel with the reconstructions, the citizens of the town also started a fight to regain their privileges. Until 1703, actual power was practiced by an imperial commissioner. Then Székesfehérvár regained its former title of free royal town.\n\nFollowing the Turkish rule the population started to increase again. Of the German and Moravian settlers, the former had soon assumed a leading role in the town. This fact determined the prevailing spirit in Székesfehérvár (Stuhlweisenburg) for many years. During Rákóczi's War of Independence the town's \"pro-German\" attitude put its citizens in misery: they had to suffer from the Kurutzs' blockade and the arbitrary measures of the pro-Hapsburg soldiers.\n\nIn the 1720s major constructions were started which considerably altered the look of the town. Churches and convents were built, first by the Franciscans, then by the Carmelites (in 1731) and the Jesuits (in 1745). They invited noted contemporary artists to carry out work. The ceiling pictures in the Jesuit Church were painted by Caspar Franz Sambach, the pictures in the convent refectory were the works of Michelangelo Unterberger and the carved pulpit was the masterpiece of Károly Bebó. Franz Anton Maulbertsch worked on the frescos of the Cam melite Church and the murals in the Parish Church were painted by Johann Ignatz Cymbal. Large-scale church constructions were followed by the reconstruction of the town-houses and the building of new palaces in the second half of the century. Baroque and Louis XVI-style buildings were erected, thus creating the still existing Baroque character of the quarter. The buildings completed in this period include the Gyôry House in Kossuth utca, the former County Hall which today houses the City Council, Hiemer House and Font House. Crowning the constructions of the period was the Louis XVI-style Episcopal Palace, started in 1780.\n\nIn the 19th century new Classicist buildings were erected. The County Hall, which was designed by Mihály Pollack, was one of the first county halls in Hungary.\n\nIn 1780, the population of Székesfehérvár reached 12,000. Craftsmen and merchants flocked to the town, and by the late 1700s more than 500 masters of 64 crafts were active.\n\nCultural prosperity\n\nIn 1688 the Jesuits opened a secondary school in Székesfehérvár. Four decades later it was taken over by the Paulines, and then, until 1813, it worked as a state-owned school. Several noted personalities, like Ferenc Faludi, György Pray, Benedek Virág, Dávid Baróti Szabó and Pál Anyos, taught in the school. The list of students was also impressive: of the numerous outstanding personalities let us mention Mihály Vörösmarty, Antal Reguly, Miklós Ybl and János Vajda. Characteristic of the bustling intellectual life in the school was the fact that regular theatrical performances were held there as early as the mid-18th century. The cause of Hungarian acting was first adopted by the town of Székesfehérvár. The first Hungarian theatrical company appeared on thc stage in Székesfehérvár in 1813 and in 1818 the town set up its first permanent company. Called \"Magyar Theatrum\", it provided an opportunity for the best actors of the day, and it also provided a home for Hungarian dramatic literature. One of the dramas of writer József Katona and several plays of Károly Kisfaludy were premiered in Székesfehérvár. Between 1842-1843, the poet Sándor Petôfi also appeared on the theatrum stage, under the name Borostyán (ivy).\n\nBy the end of the 18th century the Germanized town was becoming increasingly Hungarian. In 1814, the City Council adopted a resolution on keeping the minutes of the meetings in Hungarian instead of German and Latin. In a memorandum presented to Parliament in Bratislava in 1825, the citizens of Székes fehérvár and the estates of Fejér County applied for the reinstatement of Alba Regia as a coronation town. Székesfehérvár was among the first towns to side with Pest during the 1848-1849 War of Independence. In the wake of the Battle of Pákozd, the citizens of Székesfehérvár went out to disarm the remaining troops of Count Jellasich, and they again revolted against the Austrians following the capitulation at Világos.\n\nIn the second half ofthe 19th century the town once again lost its significance. Its industry languished, and the city council failed to establish a high school in the town. In the early 20th century, big industry was solely represented by a blue-dyeing and calico printing works. The construction of the railways brought some modest economic growth, mainly because Székesfehérvár became a transport centre. The upswing was marked by new constructions: today's Vörösmarty and Dózsa György squares were formulated in that period, and work on public utilities was also started then. The period created no outstanding pieces of architecture: the only remarkable building was the Vörösmarty Theatre, completed between 1872-1874.\n\nIn the 19th century sensation was created by the archeological excavations that revealed Székesfehérvár's past and its role in Hungary's history. The red marble coffins of King Béla III and his wife, Anne of Antioch, were uncovered in 1848, and the excavations in the second half of the 19th century brought to light considerable parts of the basilica. Several burial and ruins were also unearthed.\n\nIn the l930s, Székesfehérvár once again became the centre of attenton. The constructions complete in those years gave the inner city its present appearance. The park of ancient ruins was established and several statues were set up in public places.\n\nThe last decades\n\nOwing to its strategic location, Székesfehérvár was one of the towns that suffered most during World War Two. One third of its buildings became unhabitable and some 8-10,000 of its citizens were killed or disappeared in the fighting.\n\nThe liberation in 1945 prompted an unparalleled development in Székesfehérvár. Today the town's population exceeds 110,000, and Székesfehérvár is considered one of the most important industrial towns in the country. It also has a bustling cultural life and has become a town of schools. Alongside the secondary grammar schools and vocational secondary schools, Székesfehérvár hosts the Geodesic Faculty of the Sopron-based University of Forestry and Wood Industry. Although the renovated theatre is still functioning without a permanent company, the manager of the theatre have engaged outside companies fo three of four performances a year since 1980, and they also stage performances by other theatres The musiclans and choirs of Székesfehévár, including the concert orchestra of the local music school, have gathered laurels in several countries around the world.\n\nSzékesfehérvár is often referred to as the town of exhibitions. Art-shows are staged by the King Stephen Museum almost monthly. The pioneering activity of the museum covers primarily the modern fine arts. Its art collections are rightly considered crowd-pullers: the collection of Erzsébet Schaár's works or the municipal gallery, which was opened in 1988 and which houses the collection of Denes Deak's works, draw thousands of visitors a year.\n\nA new sight in the town is the village museum which comprises the 150-year-old houses of the onetime Rácváros. The museum includes a collection of ethnographic objects, a dairy museum, the house of a small-scale craftsman and a collection on industrial history.\n\nExcavations conducted in the park of ancient ruins have aroused interest outside the country. The experts plan to complete the excavation and restoration of further areas by the 1100th anniversary of the Magyar conquest.\n\nNowadays Székesfehérvár is again the venue of several international events. It is often visited by delegations from abroad, and dozens of international conferences are held in. the Technical House every year.\n\nSzékesfehérvár, as we see, has as great a significance today as it had in the Middle Ages."
