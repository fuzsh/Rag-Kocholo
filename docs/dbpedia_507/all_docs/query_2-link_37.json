Székesfehérvár was the capital of Hungary in the Middle Ages. Now the city is regional capital of Central Transdanubia, the centre of Fejér county and Székesfehérvár District. It was one of the most important cities of Hungary. In the Székesfehérvár Basilica (one of the largest basilicas in medieval Europe), where the Diets were held and the crown jewels kept, 37 kings and 39 queens consort were crowned and 15 rulers buried.\n\nSzekesfehervar in The Hot War[]\n\nOn 15 February 1951, during World War III, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Szekesfehervar, partly in retaliation for the Soviet Union's attack on Elmendorf Air Force Base, and partly because Szekesfehervar was a major transportation hub for Soviet forces.[1]"
