        "text": "Today a popular tourist destination, Hungary's culture boasts both eastern and western influences, with the country having been inhabited by the Celts, Romans and Huns over the course of its history. Hungary's capital city of Budapest is bisected by the River Danube and is often listed as being one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. It has many grand buildings, including museums and cultural institutions, and attracts more than four million tourists each year. Budapest has a population of 1,752,704, increasing to 3,303,786 for the metropolitan area â€“ this equates to 33% of the population of Hungary.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, Debrecen was the largest city in Hungary, but it is now the second-largest after Budapest, with a population of 203,914. However, Debrecen remains an important cultural and educational center, and it also served as Hungary's capital city towards the end of World War II in 1944-1945. Szeged, near the southern border, is the third-largest city in Hungary with 162,593 residents. The city is home to the University of Szeged, one of the most prestigious universities in the country."
