Some informations from the page:\n\nThe first mention of Fejér County is from 1009. The counties were administrative divisions in the 11-13th centuries (Royal Counties). The counties became communities of the nobles from the 13th century. (Noble Counties) The first information about a noble county is from 1232 (Zala County). To the 16th century the counties hadn't got symbols. They use their sheriff's seal. (sheriff means alispán in Hungarian, the administrative leader of the community of the county). The first used Coat of Arms is from 1490. This Coat of Arms was used by Hunyad County (today Hunedoara County, Rumania) In 1498 King Vladislas II gave a CoA to Somogy County. In 1550 the LXII Law decreed \" Every counties have to have seal (...)\n\nIn 1550 Zala, Zemplén, Nyitra and Hont counties got Coat of Arms. King Leopold I gave the Coat of Arms to Fejér County in 1694. The original script: \"Sigillum Comitatus Albensis\" King Ferdinand V. renewed the Coat of Arms in 1837. The script: \"Fejér vármegye petsétje\"\n\nThe CoA of Fejér County - Description of the Coat of Arms:\n\nOn the green field before the blue sky is the kneeling Saint Stephen with the Holy Crown, sword and sceptre on a red pillow on his arms. King Saint Stephen makes an offer of Hungary to the Blessed Virgin - who is in a beaming cloud - holding in her arm a little Jesus Christ. Under the pillow with the Holy crown there is the Coat of Arms of Hungary. Version from 1837 at <www.fejer.hu>.\n\nThe flag of Fejér County:\n\nThe first mention of the flag is from 1747. This flag was together with the representatives of the county in 1790 (when the Holy Crown returned to Buda from Vienna), in 1809 (battle with Napoleon), 1867 (coronation of Francis-Joseph I), 1896 (the Millenium of the Conquest), 1916 (coronation of Charles IV), 1938 (Millenium of the death of Saint Stephen). In 1949 the communist government prohibited the municipalities from using their symbols. On 13th March 1992 the county renewed the old Coat of Arms (script: Fejér megye) and the old flag.\n\nIstván Molnár, 20 January 2001\n\nThe Hungarian flag bulettin Zaszlovilag in number 1 of 1995 on page 7 there is the flag and Coat of Arms shown, but unfortunately, the description does not refer to the outer ring at all, and the images are not conclusive (at least in my copy it is not clear if there is line along letter J and M in the inscription). My only other source are stamps issued by Hungarian post in 1997, but these show the Fejer Coat of Arms entirely without the outer ring with inscription.\n\nAccording to images in Zaszlovilag, there are four stars in the outer ring. Also, even if that is probably hard to say in this size of the image, those stars are six-pointed (say: inscribed circle is 1/3 of the outer circle), each with two points pointing perpendicularly to the radius of the Coat of Arms connecting the center of the star . Also, probably also not visible due to the scale, the A in word VARMEGYE should have acute accent.\n\neljko Heimer, 31 March 2001\n\nAccording to <www.mno.hu>, the General Assembly of Fejér county would like to make new symbols of the county.\n\nLeft the original Coat of Arms , right the Proposed New \"Logo\" .\n\nI think the new flag proposal is white with the new \"Logo\".\n\nIstván Molnár, 27 November 2003\n\nFlag in Use\n\nimage by István Molnár, 27 August 2001\n\nFlying flag at the Conquest Statue, Opusztaszer NHP. Ratio: 3:1. The width of the Coat of Arms is the 1/3 of the width of the flag. The Coat of Arms is on the 1/3 of the flag's height.\n\nIstván Molnár, 27 August 2001\n\nMillenium Flag\n\nimage by István Molnár, 27 Febuary 2003\n\nFejér County Millenium flag - swallowtailed.\n\nIstván Molnár, 27 Febuary 2003\n\nCoat of Arms\n\nimage by Mello Luchtenberg, 1 April 2001\n\nProposed New \"Logo\""
