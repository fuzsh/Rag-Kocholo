        "text": "For most of the people, Budapest is the first thing that comes to their mind when they think about Hungary. This country is beautiful, and it has many other beautiful cities. We have already written about Győr, Szeged, Debrecen, Veszprém, Sopron, Pápa, Szolnok, Miskolc, Kecskemét, Szekszárd, Tatabánya, Salgótarján, Kaposvár, Szombathely, Esztergom, Keszthely, Balatonfüred, Siófok and many other cities. Now, let us take a look at Székesfehérvár.\n\nGeneral information\n\nSzékesfehérvár is the county seat of Fejér County, that is one of the neighbour counties of Pest county. It has about 95,000 inhabitants and has a long historical past because it was inhabited even in the 10th century B. C. It is called “The City of the Kings” because it has played a key role in the coronations of the Hungarian kings. Therefore, there are many historical buildings, monuments, museums, and programmes in this city. To explore the charming city centre, it is a good idea to take a walk there.\n\nMuseums\n\nAt Hetedhét Toy Museum, visitors can explore the toys from the older times. The exhibition is well-detailed, there is toy furniture even from monarchies’ collections not to mention the dolls, trains and many others. The Black Eagle Chemist’s Shop displays the ancient art of medicine making from herbs, old medical devices and other tools that a pharmacy possessed before. Diocese Székesfehérvár lets the visitors get to know the history of the city and the area. Moreover, one can find valuable treasures at the modern and interactive exhibition.\n\nBory Castle\n\nEven though Székesfehérvár does not have an ancient castle, Bory Castle compensates everyone with its charm. If you are a romantic type or you love architecture, you must visit this place. The entire castle was built by Jenő Bory after the first World War during 40 summers, with his own hands, according to his ideas and plans. It is an interesting fact that he did not use any form of paper or drawings, he planned everything only in his head. He was working on it until he passed away, and he offered it to the love of his life.\n\nBathing opportunities\n\nSzékesfehérvár lies in a perfect area for those who like living in a bigger city, but Budapest is too busy and crowded for them. Furthermore, it is also a good choice for anyone who likes museums, history, nature, interesting programmes, or bathing. The city has a swimming pool with pools inside and outside as well, but there are a lot more opportunities than that. Árpád Bath is one of the most beloved destinations of this kind. It is beautifully renovated from the outside and even more beautiful inside. There are opportunities for relaxing and entertaining as well. Additionally, children will not get bored either, that is for sure. Furthermore, there is a lovely restaurant in the building in case visitors wish to grab a bite. Finally, Lake Velence and Lake Balaton are very close to Székesfehérvár as well.\n\nKid-friendliness\n\nSzékesfehérvár is a kid- and family-friendly city, that must be because there are more than 40 schools in Székesfehérvár. Therefore, this place has many programmes for the little ones not only during holiday seasons but all year long. Besides Hetedhét Toy Museum (mentioned above), there are crafts, exhibitions, storytellings, activities in the libraries, and so on. Because Székesfehérvár has rich historical and cultural background, children can learn a lot in this topic. There is even a themed playground for that at the Kronás Park (Coronated Park). Additionally, there are many parks, bike paths, and lakes to get closer to nature and explore flora and fauna.\n\nFeatured image: www.facebook.com/tourinform.szekesfehervar/"
