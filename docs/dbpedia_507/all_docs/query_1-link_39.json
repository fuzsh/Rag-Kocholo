The first set of directories published for all of Hungary are listed here by date of publication. The rest of the directories are arranged alphabetically by city or region covered, and then by date. Budapest telephone numbers are listed in a separate table.\n\nThe type of directory is indicated by the words \"Res.\" (listing residential home addresses), \"Org.\" (listing businesses, institutions, and government organizations), or \"Both.\" The \"Notes\" field is used to provide additional information we have about many of these directories, such as the names of all the cities and villages the directory covers, number of volumes, whether the volume is a supplement to another volume, and whether the volume calls itself a \"Yellow Pages.\" Note that the smaller villages/towns are subsumed into a larger book, so you can use your browser's search feature to find a particular place.\n\nMost of the uncataloged directories for Hungary featured in this guide are located on Deck 5S of the closed stacks in the Adams, while more recent copies of these directories are held on Deck 46, adjacent to the Main Reading Room. Readers must request the items in the Main Reading Room by completing a call slip or asking a reference librarian in the European Reading Room. Some of the following titles link to fuller bibliographic information in the Library of Congress Online Catalog. Links to additional online content are included when available. For more information about requesting items at the Library, please see the Using the Library of Congress section in this guide."
