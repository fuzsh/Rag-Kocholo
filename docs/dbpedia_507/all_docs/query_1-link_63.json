        "text": "On 1 January 2022, the population of Hungary was 9 689 000, which is the result of a continuous decline, with a further decrease of 0.4% compared to the previous year.\n\nBased on the Labour Force Survey data for the fourth quarter of 2022, the economically active population aged 15–74 numbered 4 891 400, giving an activity rate of 66.9%. Among the active population, 4 702 500 people were in employment, while 188 900 were unemployed.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the employment rate of the population aged 15–74 was 64.3%, 0.4 percentage points higher than in the same quarter of 2021.\n\nIn the 15–74 age group, the number of unemployed persons, as defined by the ILO, showed a steady downward trend from January–March 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the number of unemployed persons, as defined by the ILO, amounted to 188 900, an increase of 8 600 compared to the same period in the previous year.\n\nThe average month-end number of jobseekers registered by the National Employment Service (NFSZ) was 233 200 in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing a significant decrease compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, 6.1% of jobseekers were first-time jobseekers. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, the number of first-time jobseekers slightly decreased (by 1.2 percentage points).\n\nOf all jobseekers, 42.4% had eight or fewer years of primary school education, 25.3% held a certificate of vocational qualification, 25.1% held a general certificate of secondary education, and 7.3% had a higher education degree. Among first-time jobseekers, the proportion of those with eight or fewer years of primary education was 43.1%, 38.8% held a general certificate of secondary education, and 3.6% had a higher education degree.\n\nThe counties with the most jobseekers were Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén (35 300) and Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg (24 400). Typically, in regions with less favourable labour market conditions, the composition of the jobseeker population by educational attainment was also worse than the national average. Compared to the same period of the previous year, the number of jobseekers fell, with the largest decreases seen in Baranya and Heves counties (14.0% and 7.0%, respectively).\n\nDuring 2022, business organisations notified collective redundancy decisions affecting 6 300 workers in total, 44.5% more than in the same period last year.\n\nBudapest\n\nThe labour market of the capital city can be analysed based on data from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office (KSH) for the third quarter of 2022. According to the latest labour market survey data, the capital’s population aged 15–74 included 912 600 economically active and 357 700 inactive people in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nThe activity rate was 71.8%, representing an increase of 1.6 percentage points compared to the same period of the previous year.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the number of persons employed was 887 600 in the capital, 12 700 more than in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nIn the years preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, Budapest had virtually reached a level close to full employment, and after the pandemic downturn, the figures improved to near pre-pandemic levels. A quarter (25.0%) of the national increase in employment (by 48 800) can be attributed to the capital.\n\nThe unemployment rate was 2.7%, 0.3% more favourable than in the same period of the previous year.\n\nThe capital’s unemployment, activity and employment rates were better than the national average, with the unemployment rate 0.9 percentage points lower, the activity rate 0.9 percentage points higher and the employment rate 5.5 percentage points higher.\n\nThe data of the National Employment Service (NFSZ) show stagnation in registered unemployment (the number of jobseekers).\n\nBased on the records of the employment departments of the district offices, the number of registered jobseekers in the capital was 17 413 at the end of 2021 and 17 603 a year later, which means an increase of 1.1% in 1 year.\n\nIn December 2022, 42.3% of registered jobseekers were men, and 57.3% were women.\n\nThe number of registered first-time jobseekers decreased to 469 from 662 in the same period of 2021. While this group accounted for 2.73% of all registered jobseekers in 2021, only 1.91% belonged to it in the same period of 2022.\n\nPest County\n\nCentral Hungary is the most economically significant and developed region in Hungary. It comprises the capital city of Budapest and Pest County. According to data from the KSH Labour Force Survey, the economically active population in the 15–74 age group amounted to 689 500 persons in Pest County in the third quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 9 700 compared to the same period of the previous year.\n\nThe activity rate increased by 0.4 percentage points to 68.6%, one of the highest activity rates in the country, over 1 year.\n\nThe number of employed persons was 674 000, while 15 500 were unemployed, and the unemployment rate was 2.3%.\n\nThe economically inactive population aged 15–74 numbered 316 300.\n\nThe county had an employment rate of 67%.\n\nThe data of the National Employment Service indicate a decrease in unemployment in 2022. The number of registered jobseekers was 18 000 in the third quarter of 2022, 1 000 persons less than in the same period of the previous year.\n\nFollowing a 27% decline from the same period of the previous year, the average number of first-time jobseekers registered in Pest County was 607 in the third quarter of 2021. First-time jobseekers accounted for 3.3% of all registered jobseekers in the quarter under review, 0.7 percentage points lower than in the same period of the previous year.\n\nThe number of jobseekers aged under 25 was 1 232 in the period under review, representing a decrease of 16% compared to the same period of the previous year. The proportion of jobseekers under 25 among all jobseekers fell by 1 percentage point to 6.7% compared to the same period of the previous year.\n\nBy level of education, jobseekers with secondary education had the highest (54%) proportion, while those with primary school and higher education accounted for 35.35% and 10.5%, respectively, of all registered jobseekers.\n\nFejér County\n\nFejér County is located in Transdanubia; its capital is Székesfehérvár. Fejér County is one of the most diverse counties in Hungary. Covering an area of 4 359 km², Fejér County is divided into 10 statistical sub-regions and 8 employment districts. There are currently 108 municipalities in the county, including 17 towns, two of which have county rights. The county’s geographic and geo-economic position and settlement pattern largely determine the opportunities for the population to earn a living. On 1 January 2021, the county had a population density of 96 inhabitants per square kilometre, exceeding the national average outside Budapest and making the county one of the most densely populated areas in Hungary.\n\nAfter a slight increase of 146 persons over 1 year, the population of Fejér County numbered 418 600 at the beginning of 2022. 14.7% of the county’s inhabitants are under 14, 65.3% are aged 15–64, and 20.0% are 65 or older. Both child and old-age dependency ratios are rising in the county. Following a rise from 28 in 1995 to 25 in 2001 and then a fall to 21 in 2012, the number of children per 100 people of working age increased by 23 in 2022 thanks to a slight and continuous growing tendency. The dependency ratio is 53.1%, which is more favourable than the regional and national ratios. In 2022, the ageing index in Fejér County was 136.0%, lower than the regional index. At the beginning of the year, 274 800 people, or nearly two thirds of the population, were of working age.\n\nAccording to data from the Labour Force Survey of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office (KSH), the number of economically active persons aged 15–74 in Fejér County was 219 700 in the first three quarters of 2022, 6 600 higher than in the previous year. Accordingly, the activity rate was 68.2%. Meanwhile, the number of people in employment increased, as did the number of the unemployed. In the third quarter of 2022, the number of persons employed was 214 400, which is 6 200 persons more than in the same period of the previous year. The employment rate was 66.6%, higher than a year earlier and 2.3 percentage points above the national average (64.3%). The number of unemployed was 5 300, 300 more than a year earlier. The unemployment rate reached 2.4 %, 1.2 percentage points below the national level. The economically inactive population aged 15–74 numbered 102 300.\n\nThe number of jobseekers registered for Fejér County in the system of the National Employment Service on the closing day in December 2022, as a result of the turnover over the year, was 7 181, about 6% less than a year earlier.\n\nIn 2022, the number of registered jobseekers increased by around 500 in three months from 7 630 in December 2021, peaking at 8 110 in March, and then fell back to 7 285 in June, following a steady decline in the second quarter. From July, their numbers rose slightly to 7 599 in September, then declined again to 7 324 in October and continued to fall to 7 181 in December. In 2022, the month-end number of registered jobseekers averaged 7 497, more than a tenth (12% or 1 021) lower than the average of the monthly data for 2021.\n\nIn 2022, first-time jobseekers accounted for an average of 4.4% (328 people per month) of all jobseekers registered in the county. Their number was significantly lower than in the previous year, resulting from a decline of 128 (28.1%) and representing a 1.0 percentage point lower proportion among all registered jobseekers. In each month of the year, the number of first-time jobseekers was lower than in the previous year, with their number below 300 in the middle of the year, reaching the lowest level in May (271) and the highest number recorded in February (412).\n\nKomárom-Esztergom County\n\nAccording to data from the KSH Labour Force Survey for the first three quarters of 2022, the population aged 15–74 in the county numbered 229 800, of which the economically active population was 156 700. The number of persons employed was 152 200. The ratio of active people to their age group was 68.5%, while that of employed people was 67.0%.\n\nMost of the population lives in towns and urban areas and typically works in industrial park districts and companies. For these people, access to jobs is ensured thanks to the county’s developed transport networks and infrastructure. Many employers provide company bus transport for employees living in small villages. The number of commuters is significantly influenced by labour market opportunities in the neighbour counties, geographical proximity and ease of access. Due to the frontier location, workers from this county are also present in the labour market of the neighbouring country. In recent years, the number of third-country nationals working in the county has increased markedly because employers are trying to solve the labour shortage in this way.\n\nRegarding the educational level of the workforce, the number of those holding a higher education degree or a general certificate of secondary education is below the national average, which shortfall is not helped even by the fact that the companies operating in the county have a high number of semi-skilled employees trained by themselves.\n\nThe county’s key employment indicators show a highly favourable improvement compared to the previous year, exceeding the national level to a greater extent than a year earlier. The number of unemployed persons, as defined by the ILO, was 2 500 in the county, giving an unemployment rate of 1.6%. The difference between the county and national unemployment rates also increased compared to the previous year, with the former already 2.1 percentage points lower than the latter.\n\nAccording to data from the National Employment Service, at the end of 2022, the number of jobseekers registered in the county was 4 477, accounting for 2.9% of the economically active population. Over the entire year, the number of registered jobseekers decreased by 5.1%, or 241, resulting in an improvement of 0.4 percentage points in their proportion of the economically active population. This means that the county’s key labour market indicators were not only significantly below their pre-COVID March 2020 levels but were also lower than 3 years earlier, the most favourable data recorded for 2019.\n\nThere is a high share of foreign direct investment, and multinational companies have a dominant presence. The companies operating in the county produce to a large extent for foreign markets, so there is a high share of exports, which increases exposure to world market processes. The manufacturing sector is the most important in the county’s economic structure, with several large companies with which the Government has strategic agreements. The number of people employed in this sector is steadily increasing.\n\nThe demand for labour from companies operating in the county remained significant, with an overall increase of more than 1 500 in staff numbers by some large and medium-sized companies, typically in the manufacturing industry, in 2022. However, the related demand for labour was barely reflected in the notifications. As employers can no longer satisfy their needs from the pool of jobseekers, they tend to choose other ways of recruiting and selecting suitable workers.\n\nVeszprém County\n\nVeszprém County is located in the Central Transdanubia Region and is one of the nation’s medium-sized counties. The county has a population of 339 300 inhabitants in 217 municipalities in 10 districts. From a labour market point of view, it has good characteristics, such as a favourable economic environment, easy access, high entrepreneurship, significant foreign investment, a highly educated population, and employment and unemployment rates above the national average. The labour market situation in the county is determined by the differing economic, social and geographical environments and local conditions in its 10 districts. In terms of economic performance and employment, the manufacturing sector and, within it, the automotive industry is of outstanding importance. Because of the proximity of the county to Lake Balaton, tourism also plays an important role.\n\nAlthough the emergence of the pandemic has led to a temporary downturn in the labour market, the number of people in employment is now above the level of the year before the pandemic. According to the data published by the KSH for the population aged 15–74,\n\nthere were 165 600 employed persons in the county’s labour market, and the employment rate was 64.3%, the same as the national rate, in the third quarter of 2022. The number of unemployed persons (2 700) is still above the pre-pandemic level, although the temporary significant increase has reduced. Nevertheless, the county still has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, which was 1.6% in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nThe number of jobseekers registered at the Veszprém County Government Office showed a similar trend: after a sharp increase during the epidemic, the number of jobseekers has gradually declined. In the third quarter of 2022, the average number of registered jobseekers was 6 125, representing 3.6 % of the active population aged 15–74. Both the number and proportion of jobseekers showed a decrease compared to the same period of the previous year. Based on the indicators for the 10 districts of the county, the labour market situation is better than the national average in eight districts and worse in two. On the closing day in September 2022, the gender distribution of registered jobseekers was equal. The proportion of first-time jobseekers and young people, mainly under 25, among registered jobseekers continued to decline, while the number of older people in the register (over 50) increased compared to before. The pandemic has led to an increase in the proportion of long-term jobseekers in recent years. Half of those registered cannot find a job for more than six months.\n\nOn the closing day in September 2022, a third of jobseekers had no more than a primary school education, while 42.7% of those registered had no qualifications.\n\nFejér County\n\nThe employment departments received a total of about 11 249 notifications of new vacancies during the year, which means that the monthly average of new vacancies notified by employers was 937 in the county. Compared to 2021, this was around 3 300 or two-fifths more than the annual value and 273 more than the monthly average. The number of notifications received was the highest in March (1 324) and the lowest in January (396).\n\nOn a monthly average, 603 of the new notifications concerned non-subsidised jobs, which is 261 more than the monthly average for the previous year and accounts for an average of 64.4% of all new vacancies notified during the year. The average monthly number of subsidised jobs available was 334, nearly the same as in the previous year (323). However, their total annual number exceeded 4 000. Specifically, there were 4 011 subsidised jobs available.\n\nWithin these, contrary to the previous year, subsidised jobs outside the workfare scheme outnumbered those under it, accounting for slightly over half (50.3%) of the subsidised jobs notified. This also indicates a slightly diminished role of subsidised jobs available under the workforce scheme, which had a somewhat lower share within the total number of subsidised jobs notified.\n\nAmong the newly notified vacancies, the majority (1 076) were simple industry occupations, followed by other simple service and transport occupation not elsewhere classified (869), simple construction industry occupations (855), and other cleaner and helper (774).\n\nKomárom-Esztergom County\n\nIn total, 13 205 jobs available to registered jobseekers were notified during the year. These included 6 761 so-called normal jobs (51.2%), 2 080 subsidised jobs (15.8%) and 3 505 jobs for foreign workers (26.5%). More than a third of the available normal jobs, representing a demand for 2 453 workers, were in manufacturing, and a significant number (1 455 or 21.5%) of the notifications submitted by temporary work agencies also specifically concerned workers sought for the manufacturing industry.\n\nBased on the composition of the available normal jobs by occupation, the greatest demand was for various production line assembly workers and simple industry workers, most of whom were intended to be employed for similar work, representing a total demand for 2 079 workers. The notified vacancies also included simple unskilled jobs (for 972 workers). In the manufacturing industry, machine operators were sought for 791 jobs, most of them (112) specified as metal finishing and coating machine operators. The demand for skilled industry and construction workers was divided among several specific occupations, with the demand for fitters of building electric networks and electric fitters (86) standing out. In addition, around 80 vacancies for bricklayers and water, gas and heating pipe fitters were notified. Concerning other areas of the economy, only the number of shop assistant vacancies (212) merits special mention. Of the vacancies notified to obtain authorisation for the employment of foreign workers, the majority (69.7%) were simple blue-collar occupations and jobs to be filled by semi-skilled workers (2 444), while 770 were for skilled blue-collar workers. The latter notifications were mainly for the employment of skilled welders and flamecutters (264) and heavy truck and lorry drivers (213).\n\nVeszprém County\n\nThe labour market in the county is characterised by a predominance of labour demand, with employers tending to struggle to fill vacancies. The shortage of quality labour is a serious challenge that cannot be overcome without employing foreign nationals. Businesses have a demand for highly skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers alike. The share of open labour market demand is increasing year on year. In 2022, three quarters of all vacancies were notified from the primary labour market. At the same time, the role of the workfare scheme is declining. In total, employers notified 9 236 vacancies during the year and intended to fill nearly half of these without using subsidies.\n\nWithin the county, the demand for labour was the greatest in the employment area around Ajka, Pápa and Veszprém, with the most workers needed by manufacturing, construction, accommodation and catering and commercial businesses. Half of the notified vacancies were simple unskilled jobs.\n\nGyőr-Moson-Sopron County\n\nAccording to the 2022 year-end data of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office (KSH), the county had a population of 479 347 inhabitants, 4.9 % of the country’s population. 5.4% of all people employed in Hungary lived in this county. As regards the gender composition of the population, 51.25% of the inhabitants were women, and 48.75% were men.\n\nBased on the KSH Labour Force Survey, the number of employed persons increased, while the number of jobseekers decreased compared to a year earlier. In the third quarter of 2022, this county had the highest employment rate (79.6%), while its unemployment rate was 2.5%.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, 81.6% of the population aged 15–64, or 255 600 persons, were economically active in the county, which is 2.9% more than in the same period of the previous year. There were 249 000 employed persons in the labour market after their number increased by 2.1%, a rate higher than the national average.\n\nIn contrast to the improving employment rate, the number of unemployed increased by 46% to 6 000. The unemployment rate rose to 2.5% from 1.7% a year earlier but was still lower than the national average (3.7%). The simultaneous rise in employment and unemployment resulted from the entry of economically inactive persons in the labour market as active (employed or unemployed).\n\nAs in 2021, the Government’s main objectives in 2022 were to support the sectors most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, retain as many jobs as possible, create the same number of new jobs as those lost, and swiftly reintegrate people into the labour market after losing their jobs. To this end, the Government announced several job preservation and creation programmes, such as the workforce support programme for companies (VMT) and the regional workforce support programme for companies (VRMT). The main target groups of these programmes were disadvantaged jobseekers (low-skilled, over 50 years old, long-term unemployed). Under the two programmes, more than 1 200 people were supported and employed in the county.\n\nVas County\n\nMost parts of the economy had recovered from the downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic by the beginning of 2022, but businesses had to face new challenges during the year.\n\nBased on the KSH Labour Force Survey, 64.8% of the population aged 15–74, i.e. 127 400 economically active persons, 4 000 fewer than a year earlier, were present in the labour market in Vas County in the third quarter of 2022. Within the economically active population, the number of employed persons decreased by 3 300, and the number of unemployed declined by 800. The unemployment rate was 2.0%, and the employment rate reached 63.5%. This latter indicator was 0.8 percentage points below the national average.\n\nThe labour market situation remained positive, but businesses may face labour shortages. According to data from the National Employment Service (NFSZ), the number of registered jobseekers fell every month in 2022, although at varying rates, and stood at 3 760 in the third quarter, which is 11.9 % less than in the same period of the previous year.\n\n34.6% of all jobseekers had at most 8 years of primary education, 28.3% held a certificate from a skilled workers’ training school, 8.4% from general secondary education, 20.5% from a vocational secondary school or a technical school, and 8.2% had a higher education degree.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, 5.2% of jobseekers, or a total of 195 people, were first-time jobseekers, 24.4 % fewer than a year earlier. Among first-time jobseekers, the proportion of those with a maximum of 8 years of primary education was 24.8%, 18.3 % held a certificate from a skilled workers’ training school, 13.9% had a general certificate of secondary education, 35.5 % held a certificate from a vocational secondary school or a technical school, and 7.5 % had a higher education degree.\n\nVas County is still among those with the most favourable labour market situation. Its monthly jobseeker rate was 2.9% on average, 0.4 percentage points lower than a year earlier and 2 percentage points more favourable than the national average.\n\nThis indicator improved in all areas of Vas County compared to the third quarter of the previous year.\n\nThe proportion of jobseekers is the highest (5.6 %), 2.7 percentage points less favourable than the county average, in the catchment area of Vasvár. Another area where the labour market situation is worse than that of the county is the surroundings of Celldömölk. In other districts, the value of this relative indicator is similar to or more favourable than that for the county.\n\nZala County\n\nSimilarly to the national population, the population living in the county has been decreasing steadily for many years. It numbered 264 300 on 1 January 2022.\n\nStanding at around 168 000, the working-age population was less than two thirds of the total population. The age composition of the county’s population is slightly different from that of the national population. In Zala, the proportion of persons under 15 is 2 percentage points lower than the national value; the proportion of those aged 15–64 is one percentage point lower, while that of those over 64 is 3 percentage points higher.\n\nData on the employment situation are available primarily from the Labour Force Survey conducted by the KSH quarterly by interviewing the general public. Based on this, the average number of persons employed in Zala County in the third quarter of 2022 was 123 700, which is 4 000 fewer than a year earlier.\n\nThe employment rate in the third quarter was 74.6 %, 1.8 percentage points lower than in the third quarter of 2021, but exactly the same as the national average.\n\nAccording to the survey, the number of unemployed was 5 900 in the third quarter of 2022, which is 1.6 thousand more than a year earlier. The unemployment rate increased from 3.2% to 4.6%, which is higher than the national average.\n\nAlthough economic activity diminished in the county, its activity rate of 78.2% was still higher than the national rate in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nAccording to the average data for 2022, the number of registered jobseekers in Zala County was the seventh lowest of all counties, while their proportion was more favourable in nine counties than in Zala. Considering the main data, the annual developments were overall more favourable in Zala than the national trends. Both the number and proportion of jobseekers decreased by more than the average.\n\nIn 2022, an average of 6 500 jobseekers, i.e. more than a thousand fewer than a year earlier, were registered in the county. The number of jobseekers decreased in all districts of the county. The rate of decrease was the largest in the Keszthely district, where the number of jobseekers decreased by nearly a third compared to the previous year. Due to the significant weight of accommodation and food service activities and tourism, the pandemic sharply increased the number of jobseekers in this district, so the base value was high.\n\nIn 2022, the average ratio of jobseekers to the economically active population was 5.0 %, 0.8 percentage points lower than a year earlier. In the areas around Lenti, Zalaszentgrót and Zalaegerszeg, the proportion of jobseekers is persistently lower than the average. However, in the Letenye and Nagykanizsa districts, this indicator has been above the county average for a long time.\n\nIn 2022, the scale of labour market transitions differed from those a year earlier. 11 000 new jobseekers were entered, and 11 300 jobseekers were removed from the register, the former being 700 more and the latter 900 fewer than in 2021.\n\nConsidering its economic indicators, Zala ranks in the middle among the counties.
