        "text": "The territory served as the residence of Hungarian kings for centuries, which is reflected by many mediaeval monuments in the region, but you can also find Roman relics here, as well. Apart from the historical values, the region offers other attractions: the romantic forests of the Bakony and the Vértes hills or Lake Velence provide excellent relaxation for the lovers of nature.\n\nSzékesfehérvár (called Alba Regia in the Middle Ages) was the town of King Saint Stephen, the founder of the Hungarian state.\n\nIt is one of the oldest settlements of Hungary and it has the richest history: in the Middle ages 32 Hungarian kings were crowned here, and it also served as a royal burial place.\n\nThe Our Lady Basilica was built on Gothic foundation and it was rebuilt in baroque style. In its sanctuary decorated with red marble the royal crown and the archives were preserved for centuries.\n\nA popular attraction of the city is the Bory Castle built by Jenő Bory in the 1930s based on his own plans.\n\nIn the garden of ancient ruins belonging to Stephen I's basilica a National Memorial Park was established, where you can see the remains of the imposing pillars and the foundation stones of the apse closing the sanctuary. You can pay tribute to Saint Stephen at his grave covered with a simple stone block marked with a cross. The original sarcophagus of our first king can be seen in a mausoleum decorated with relics by Walter Madarassy, glass paintings by Lili Sztehlo Árkay and historical frescoes by Vilmos Aba-Novák.\n\nThe Pharmacy Fekete Sas (Black Eagle), which is a pharmacy museum today, was run by the Jesuits in the baroque period. The baroque furniture of the pharmacy was made in the Jesuits' carving workshop, but you can see special equipment including a medicine press with a copper mortar and several painted wooden jars here.\n\nIn the county you can find several open-air museums: the Skanzen of Palotaváros in Székesfehérvár has a museum-street presenting the everyday life of the Serbian craftsmen in the houses with thatched roofs; the open-air museum of Tác is the largest park of archaeology in the Carpathian basin evoking the atmosphere of antiquity. The remains have been restored in their original forms giving an overall picture of the history of the ancient town, Gorsium-Herculia.\n\nThe remains of an ancient Roman camp have been found by archaeologists in Dunaújváros, too. During the excavation of the settlement called Intercisa archaeologists found a semi-detached house with air heating, a military bath with a mosaic floor, as well as a beautiful Mithras board. In the garden with stonework and ruins a collection of sarcophagi can be seen."
