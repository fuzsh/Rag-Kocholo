        "text": "In modern economic theories, human qualities are treated as autonomous production factors, which are called “human capital”. However, these theories provide no description of the relationship between human capital and the man who is its “bearer”, nor an explanation of the formation process of that capital. In the thesis, the author tries to justify it as follows: human qualities, including knowledge and skills, are an integral part of a human being, that is, they are involved in every human act. It is, therefore, wrong to analyse their economic significance in isolation from the whole structure of human activity. Through his or her action, man discovers the potential in things and relationships in the form of the possibility of using them for a particular purpose. Capital is thus realized by the human potential of things that form a system for transforming the world. In the first part of the article, a general description of human capital will be provided. In the second part, it wil...\n\nThe progress of the developed countries contributed to the formation of the new economy the economy of knowledge, innovation, new technologies and business ventures. Human capital represents the foundation of this new economy. Changing role of human capital, transforming it from the element of the cost into the main productive and social element of the development has led to the necessity of forming a new paradigm of economic growth. In the proces of the transition from the industrial to the informational paradigm occurs the socio-economic relationships change, covering all spheres of human activity. Thus through the human capital is determined the efficiency and competitiveness of subjects at different levels. In the new paradigm of the global community development, human capital has a crucial place in national wealth (about 80% in developed countries). Research on human capital aimed both the concept itself and measureing the level of investment in human capital and the link betwe...\n\nThe project work takes up two of the most popular topics of today’s political economy: growth and education. The level of analysis is two-fold, as well: European Union level, and country level. The first part of the paper finds out that the Hungarian policy making works towards the erosion of factors of growth. Moreover, the actual growth is induced through international indebtedness. There is an agreement on the significance of human capital in economic growth. Therefore, it is analyzed whether the assumption holds true for the European Union, too, and if it is so, which level of education contributes the most to the growth of the aggregate income. Econometric analysis reveals that investment in tertiary education significantly and positively correlates with growth; hence the paper describes the corresponding policies. The EU level findings are examined on the country level, too. A summary on Portugal’s case study confirms that the converging countries should invest in human capital, as well, but secondary education should be put in the center. Reforms of the Hungarian higher education is welcomed but educational policies should not fail to build a strong system of vocational training delivering imitation skills to enhance the country’s ability to adopt more developed technologies.\n\nThe present paper had as starting point the idea according to which human capital and investment in human capital, and respectively investment in education, can be considered key determinant of economic growth and development. Our paper draws attention to the conditions necessary so that the effects of education on human capital development and economic development should record maximum values. The paper emphasizes the idea that investments in education become ineffective unless accompanied by a suitable and appropriate strategy for economic and social development, based on socio-economic and political stability, and by the existence of a direct relationship between income, occupation and level of education and professional training. Our analysis also involves the concepts of social capital and psychological capital, both being considered as influencing development theory, practice and policy; although they bring about less clear and direct results, these two forms of capital are co...\n\nThe territorial examination of human resources and their training institutions was disregarded by the hungarian regional researches. The cause of the time-lag is that data concerning the qualification of the population are connecting to the census, which is carried out in every 10th year and it is not possible to work out reliable analyses on the territorial level (regional, county, in case of some variable settlement) without them. There is rather broad information base on the institutions training human resources. For example information on the network of secondary level education, higher education, their service palette (training directions), quantity development (number of students, teachers), state of supply (equipments), and data can be collected about the rating of institutons (mainly on secondary level) as well (the number of matriculating students). The first part of the study focuses on the relation between human resources and regional development. It sets out that human c...\n\nThe concept of capital has been examined in the literature in its various aspects: financial, organizational, structural, social, relational, human, and intellectual. The paper aims to analyze the evolution of the concept of human capital, starting from the definition given at individual level; namely, human capital is closely related to genetics, education, experience and attitudes of a person. Education and training underpin the development of human capital in an organization, whether public or private. Looking at the ensemble education, human capital and welfare in organization, we see that theories of human capital influence the educational system and labour market. Economists call this process, capital formation, in order to improve productivity in the workplace. In the current society based on knowledge, human capital is one of the engines of economic development. Thus, this intangible capital aims to bring added value to an organization, especially at the top and middle management level. However the term human capital is defined not only by the level of education of the individual, but also by the acquired specific knowledge or experience in the previous job. Using literature review, the paper identifies the elements of human capital, following the historical evolution of the concept, as there is no common definition of human capital, most referring to knowledge, skills, competencies and attributes embodied in individuals, in order to facilitate the creation of personal, social and economic welfare. Further, through Eurostat database, the work explores the relationship between education and the labour market, both at European Union level and in particular for Romania, using indicators such as: the employment rate, education level, number of graduates with higher education, research and development degree."
