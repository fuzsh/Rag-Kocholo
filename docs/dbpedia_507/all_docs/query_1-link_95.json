The kingdom eventually became part of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed during World War I. The country fell under Communist rule following World War II. In 1956, a revolt and an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met with a massive military intervention by Moscow. Under the leadership of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary began liberalizing its economy, introducing so-called \"Goulash Communism.\" Hungary held its first multiparty elections in 1990 and initiated a free market economy. It joined NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004.\n\nGeography Back To Top\n\nFreshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):\n\ntotal: 21.03 cu km/yr (9%/59%/32%)\n\nper capita: 2,082 cu m/yr (2001)\n\nTotal renewable water resources:\n\n120 cu km (2005)\n\nLand boundaries:\n\ntotal: 2,185 km\n\nborder countries: Austria 366 km, Croatia 329 km, Romania 443 km, Serbia 166 km, Slovakia 676 km, Slovenia 102 km, Ukraine 103 km\n\nEnvironment - international agreements:\n\nparty to: Air Pollution, Air Pollution-Nitrogen Oxides, Air Pollution-Persistent Organic Pollutants, Air Pollution-Sulfur 85, Air Pollution-Sulfur 94, Air Pollution-Volatile Organic Compounds, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling\n\nsigned, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements\n\nClimate:\n\ntemperate; cold, cloudy, humid winters; warm summers\n\nMap references:\n\nEurope\n\nGeographic coordinates:\n\n47 00 N, 20 00 E\n\nNatural resources:\n\nbauxite, coal, natural gas, fertile soils, arable land\n\nElevation extremes:\n\nlowest point: Tisza River 78 m\n\nhighest point: Kekes 1,014 m\n\nTerrain:\n\nmostly flat to rolling plains; hills and low mountains on the Slovakian border\n\nGeography - note:\n\nlandlocked; strategic location astride main land routes between Western Europe and Balkan Peninsula as well as between Ukraine and Mediterranean basin; the north-south flowing Duna (Danube) and Tisza Rivers divide the country into three large regions\n\nArea:\n\ntotal: 93,030 sq km\n\nland: 92,340 sq km\n\nwater: 690 sq km\n\nLocation:\n\nCentral Europe, northwest of Romania\n\nCoastline:\n\n0 km (landlocked)\n\nArea - comparative:\n\nslightly smaller than Indiana\n\nIrrigated land:\n\n2,300 sq km (2003)\n\nEnvironment - current issues:\n\nthe upgrading of Hungary's standards in waste management, energy efficiency, and air, soil, and water pollution to meet EU requirements will require large investments\n\nMaritime claims:\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nLand use:\n\narable land: 49.58%\n\npermanent crops: 2.06%\n\nother: 48.36% (2005)\n\nPeople Back To Top\n\nTotal fertility rate:\n\n1.34 children born/woman (2008 est.)\n\nSex ratio:\n\nat birth: 1.06 male(s)/female\n\nunder 15 years: 1.06 male(s)/female\n\n15-64 years: 0.97 male(s)/female\n\n65 years and over: 0.57 male(s)/female\n\ntotal population: 0.91 male(s)/female (2008 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate:\n\n0.1% (2001 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS:\n\n2,800 (2001 est.)\n\nLife expectancy at birth:\n\ntotal population: 73.18 years\n\nmale: 69 years\n\nfemale: 77.62 years (2008 est.)\n\nMajor infectious diseases:\n\ndegree of risk: intermediate\n\nfood or waterborne diseases: bacterial diarrhea and hepatitis A\n\nvectorborne diseases: tickborne encephalitis (2008)\n\nLiteracy:\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 99.4%\n\nmale: 99.5%\n\nfemale: 99.3% (2003 est.)\n\nNet migration rate:\n\n0.86 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2008 est.)\n\nEthnic groups:\n\nHungarian 92.3%, Roma 1.9%, other or unknown 5.8% (2001 census)\n\nMedian age:\n\ntotal: 39.1 years\n\nmale: 36.8 years\n\nfemale: 41.8 years (2008 est.)\n\nPopulation:\n\n9,930,915 (July 2008 est.)\n\nEducation expenditures:\n\n5.5% of GDP (2005)\n\nPopulation growth rate:\n\n-0.254% (2008 est.)\n\nLanguages:\n\nHungarian 93.6%, other or unspecified 6.4% (2001 census)\n\nDeath rate:\n\n12.99 deaths/1,000 population (2008 est.)\n\nInfant mortality rate:\n\ntotal: 8.03 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nmale: 8.74 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nfemale: 7.29 deaths/1,000 live births (2008 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS - deaths:\n\nfewer than 100 (2001 est.)\n\nSchool life expectancy (primary to tertiary education):\n\ntotal: 15 years\n\nmale: 15 years\n\nfemale: 16 years (2006)\n\nAge structure:\n\n0-14 years: 15.2% (male 774,092/female 730,485)\n\n15-64 years: 69.3% (male 3,393,630/female 3,488,011)\n\n65 years and over: 15.6% (male 559,483/female 985,214) (2008 est.)\n\nBirth rate:\n\n9.59 births/1,000 population (2008 est.)\n\nReligions:\n\nRoman Catholic 51.9%, Calvinist 15.9%, Lutheran 3%, Greek Catholic 2.6%, other Christian 1%, other or unspecified 11.1%, unaffiliated 14.5% (2001 census)\n\nNationality:\n\nnoun: Hungarian(s)\n\nadjective: Hungarian\n\nGovernment Back To Top\n\nDiplomatic representation from the US:\n\nchief of mission: Ambassador April H.
