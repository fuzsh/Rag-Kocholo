        "text": "Thanks to the agreement signed with the owner, Balance 99 Zrt., the group will franchise the unique historical four-star Hotel Magyar Király in the heart of Székesfehérvár, in the renewed historic area of the city.\n\nMercure Székesfehérvár Magyar Király offers 79 modern and comfortable rooms and 4 suites located over 2 floors. Guests can also benefit from a restaurant with an external terrace or the Wine Bar room made up of the original bricks of Szekesfehervar castle's wall. The atmosphere of a 200-year-old building and the comfort of the XXI. century make the hotel a perfect location for wedding celebrations as well as business travelers who can enjoy 700 sqm of meeting rooms.\n\nThe classical-style palace, also called Zichy Palace was built at the beginning of the 1820s with the cooperation of the key Hungarian figure of neoclassical architecture, Mihály Pollack. The palace has been a hotel since 1870, but after its nationalisation in 1949, it took on a different function. It was reopened as a hotel in 1958 and reverted to its original name in 1990.\n\nDuring the years, the hotel has gone through several reconstructions and renovations, most recently in 2010. An important aspect of these developments was to ensure that, while retaining its original features, the hotel would meet all the needs of the 21st-century guest.\n\n\"Each and every one of the upper-midscale hotels of Mercure brand is unique, but all share the same passion for high-quality services. They allow our guests to fully experience every destination at the very core, telling a story about the location and its cultural heritage\", says Dilek Sezer, Senior Development Director, South Eastern Europe Accor. \"The project is a key opportunity for us to expand our regional network in Hungary and near Budapest.\"\n\n„We are delighted to cooperate with a world-leading partner like Accor and its unrivaled and largest portfolio of brands in Europe. We are pleased that Székesfehérvár's historic hotel can build upon a well-known international brand offering high-standard guest experience for the travellers\", told Albert Molnar of Balance 99 Zrt., the investment group, owner of the hotel.\n\nSzékesfehérvár, a royal residence, as the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary where Hungarian kings were crowned. It held a central role in the Middle Ages. Significant trade routes led to the Balkans and Italy, and to Buda and Vienna, and was known in many languages by translations of \"white castle\". Székesfehérvár is a historical city, ranked among the top 10 tourist destinations in Hungary. Tourism in Székesfehérvár is boosted by the stable and strong performance of the local economy and large-scale developments. The number of visitors to the city has increased considerably, reflecting an increase not only in business and sports tourism but also marking major achievements in cultural tourism. Today Székesfehérvár is one of Hungary's most important and largest economic centers. The city's geographical location, its role in transport, and its economic potential have made it one of the most dynamically developing regions. Four of the country's ten largest companies are based in Fehérvár."
