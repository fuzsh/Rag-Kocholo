        "text": "There are a total of 19 counties in Hungary, plus the capital city, Budapest.\n\nCounties are also further divided into districts and then municipalities. In Budapest, for example, there are 23 districts. In this post, we’ll explore some cursory information on each of the counties of Hungary, such as size and population. Population data is based on estimates from 2019.\n\nBelow, you’ll find a map detailing the boundaries of each region in Hungary.\n\nCounties of Hungary Map\n\nBaranya\n\nCounty Seat: Pécs\n\nTotal Land Area: 4,430 square kilometers (1,710 square miles)\n\nPopulation: 360,704\n\nNumber of Districts: 10\n\nBaranya is the southernmost county in Hungary, bordering Croatia and three other Hungarian counties. There are a range of geographical features in this county: mountains and forests in the northern portion, hills in the center of the county, and mostly flat land in the east and west of Baranya.\n\nThe county seat of Baranya is Pécs, which is Hungary’s fifth-largest city and lies near to the border with Croatia. It is one of the major cultural centers in the country and is also home to Hungary’s oldest university.\n\nBács-Kiskun\n\nCounty Seat: Kecskemét\n\nTotal Land Area: 8,445 square kilometers (3,261 square miles)\n\nPopulation: 503,825\n\nNumber of Districts: 11\n\nThis is the biggest county in Hungary, and it lies in the south of the country along the Serbian border. The county is mostly flat and includes the greatest area of Kiskunság National Park, which is listed as a UNESCO biosphere reserve.\n\nKecskemét is the county seat of Bács-Kiskun. The site of the city has been inhabited for a long time — the oldest pieces of evidence of human presence in the region are around five thousand years old. Today, the city is populated by a large Hungarian majority, with smaller populations of Romani, German, Slovak, and others totaling less than 5% of the city’s population.\n\nBékés\n\nCounty Seat: Békéscsaba\n\nTotal Land Area: 5,630 square kilometers (2,174 square miles)\n\nPopulation: 334,264\n\nNumber of Districts: 9\n\nOccupying the southeastern corner of Hungary is the county of Békés. It borders three other Hungarian counties as well as Romania. The name of this county comes from a castle that was established by Hungarians once they had conquered the area, and it means “peaceful.”\n\nThe seat of this county is Békéscsaba, which is located on the Great Hungarian Plain. It’s in an area that has been inhabited by humans for thousands of years, and many different peoples have conquered the area at different times: the Scythians, Celts, Huns, and Ottomans, to name a few.\n\nBorsod-Abaúj-Zemplén\n\nCounty Seat: Miskolc\n\nTotal Land Area: 7,247 square kilometers (2,798 square miles)\n\nPopulation: 642,447\n\nNumber of Districts: 16\n\nBorsod-Abaúj-Zemplén is Hungary’s northernmost county, bordering Slovakia to the north as well as four other Hungarian counties. It is the second-largest county in the country by size and population. Another notable feature of this county is that it is the only to host two UNESCO World Heritage Sites within its borders: the Caves of Aggtelek Karst and Slovak Karst and the Tokaj Wine Region Historic Cultural Landscape.\n\nMiskolc is the county seat of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén and the fourth-largest city in Hungary. Economically, the city is best known for its industrial production. The infrastructure for heavy industry was largely developed during the Socialist era.\n\nBudapest\n\nCounty Seat: Municipality of Budapest\n\nTotal Land Area: 525 square kilometers (203 square miles)\n\nPopulation: 1,752,286\n\nNumber of Districts: 23\n\nWhat county is Budapest in? That question doesn’t have an easy answer: unlike the other regions on this list, the Municipality of Budapest has special status as the capital of Hungary. It is not a county, but rather a municipality that effectively has the same status as one of the other 19 counties. It is the most populous administrative region in Hungary as well as the smallest in size, and it has 23 districts — more than any other county.\n\nThe city of Budapest is divided by the Danube River, which passes through the city and divides the former cities of Buda and Pest. It is the ninth-largest city in the European Union and the financial and political capital of Hungary.\n\nCsongrád\n\nCounty Seat: Szeged\n\nTotal Land Area: 4,263 square kilometers (1,646 square miles)\n\nPopulation: 399,012\n\nNumber of Districts: 7\n\nIn the southeast of Hungary, this county borders the neighboring countries of Romania and Serbia in addition to three other domestic counties. The county is mostly flat and is the most important agricultural area of the country. This is because of the presence of high quality soil and an abundance of sunlight.\n\nSzeged is the seat of the county, and it is the third-largest city in Hungary. It’s been inhabited since ancient times, and the first written record of its current name appears in a document written by King Béla III in 1183.\n\nFejér\n\nCounty Seat: Székesfehérvár\n\nTotal Land Area: 4,358 square kilometers (1,683 square miles)\n\nPopulation: 417,712\n\nNumber of Districts: 8\n\nFejér is a county in central Hungary that borders six other counties but has no foreign borders. Lakes, mountains, and plains in the area give the county geological diversity. One notable feature of this county is Lake Velence, which is a popular vacation location for Hungarians.\n\nThe county seat of Fejér is Székesfehérvár, which held an important role as a capital of the Kingdom of Hungary during the Middle Ages and as a royal residence. It is where the first Kings of Hungary were crowned and buried, and it was connected to trade routes that led to Italy, the Balkans, Budapest, and Vienna.\n\nGyőr-Moson-Sopron\n\nCounty Seat: Győr\n\nTotal Land Area: 4,208 square kilometers (1,625 square miles)\n\nPopulation: 467,144\n\nNumber of Districts: 7\n\nIn the northwestern corner of Hungary lies the county of Győr-Moson-Sopron, which borders Austria, Slovakia, and three other counties. The present-day borders of this county were established in 1950 and came about as the combination of the Győr-Moson and Sopron counties.\n\nLocated halfway between Budapest and Vienna is Győr, the county seat of Győr-Moson-Sopron. It is an important city in the northwestern region of Hungary and is well connected to the rest of Central Europe. One of the main contributors to Győr’s local economy is a large Audi automotive factory.\n\nHajdú-Bihar\n\nCounty Seat: Debrecen\n\nTotal Land Area: 6,210 square kilometers (2,398 square miles)\n\nPopulation: 527,989\n\nNumber of Districts: 10\n\nThis county borders Romania and four other counties in eastern Hungary.

The region is mostly flat, though there are a variety of geographical features found in different areas of the county.\n\nAfter Budapest, the largest city in Hungary is Debrecen, which is the seat of this county. It was the largest city in the country in the 18th century and is still one of the most important cultural locations in Hungary.\n\nHeves\n\nCounty Seat: Eger\n\nTotal Land Area: 3,637 square kilometers (1,404 square miles)\n\nPopulation: 294,609\n\nNumber of Districts: 7\n\nHeves is a county in the north of Hungary that borders four counties and has no foreign borders. It is one of the most geographically diverse counties in Hungary, with two of the tallest mountain ranges and a section of the Great Hungarian Plain within its borders. The largest artificial lake in Hungary, Lake Tisza, lies along the southern border of Heves.\n\nThe county seat of Heves is Eger, a city best known for its thermal baths, baroque buildings, red wines, and the Eger minaret, an Ottoman-era construction.\n\nJász-Nagykun-Szolnok\n\nCounty Seat: Szolnok\n\nTotal Land Area: 5,582 square kilometers (2,155 square miles)\n\nPopulation: 370,007\n\nNumber of Districts: 9\n\nJász-Nagykun-Szolnok is a county in central Hungary that borders seven others and no foreign countries. The names of this county come from the various peoples that settled in the area as well as the city of Szolnok, which is the seat of the county.\n\nThe city of Szolnok was a vital center for cultural and economic trade for centuries because of its location in the center of the Great Hungarian Plain. The immediate area around Szolnok is one of the sunniest in Europe.\n\nKomárom-Esztergom\n\nCounty Seat: Tatabánya\n\nTotal Land Area: 2,264 square kilometers (874 square miles)\n\nPopulation: 299,207\n\nNumber of Districts: 6\n\nThe Komárom-Esztergom county is located in the north of Hungary, and its northern border is traced by the Danube River, which separates Hungary from Slovakia. The county also borders four others in Hungary.\n\nThe seat of this county is Tatabánya, which lies in the valley between Gerecse and Vértes Mountains. Since it is surrounded by mountains, the city is a junction for railroads and roads.\n\nNógrád\n\nCounty Seat: Salgótarján\n\nTotal Land Area: 2,544 square kilometers (982 square miles)\n\nPopulation: 189,304\n\nNumber of Districts: 6\n\nNógrád is located in northern central Hungary and borders Slovakia as well as three other Hungarian counties.

Modern development in the city began in the mid-19th century when a coal mine was opened nearby. A tourist attraction is the nearby Salgó Castle, built in the 13th century.\n\nPest\n\nCounty Seat: Budapest\n\nTotal Land Area: 6,391 square kilometers (2,676 square miles)\n\nPopulation: 1,278,874\n\nNumber of Districts: 18\n\nPest County in Hungary surrounds the country’s capital and borders Slovakia in addition to six other Hungarian counties.
