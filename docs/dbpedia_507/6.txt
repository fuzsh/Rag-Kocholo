Székesfehérvár (Medieval Latin: Albe Regia or Alba Regalis, German: Stuhlweissenburg) is a Hungarian city in the Transdanubian Region, capital of Fejér county.

The city was founded in 972 on four small islands of the Gaja stream. In the Middle Ages the city was a royal residence. According to the Medieval ceremonies, a Hungarian king should be crowned here by the archbishop of Esztergom. 43 kings were crowned here and many of them have been buried in the old cathedral.

During the 145 years of Ottoman occupation the majority of the population fled. During the Turkish wars the Medieval cathedral and many buildings were destroyed. The only intact Gothic building in the city is the Szent Anna chapel .
