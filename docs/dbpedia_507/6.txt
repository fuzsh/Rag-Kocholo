Szekesfehervar in The Hot War[]

On 15 February 1951, during World War III, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Szekesfehervar, partly in retaliation for the Soviet Union's attack on Elmendorf Air Force Base, and partly because Szekesfehervar was a major transportation hub for Soviet forces.[1]
