Publishing group Open Media, the company behind the Algarve Resident newspaper and the Essential group of magazines, now has a 90% share in Editurismo Lda, the company that publishes the monthly German magazine Entdecken Sie Algarve (Discover the Algarve).

The deal includes the monthly bilingual English/German language magazine Algarve Vida, which merged with Entdecken Sie Algarve last year. Arne Steingräber, former managing director and one of the previous owners, retains a 10% shareholding in Editurismo.

The magazines will be merged into Open Media's Algarve operation over the following weeks.

Launched in 1988 and having celebrated its 25th anniversary in December 2013 Entdecken Sie Algarve was originally part of the long defunct "Discover" group of publications in the Algarve, which back in the late 80s and incorporated the Algarve Resident newspaper.

"Having worked in publishing in the Algarve since the early 80s, it's great to see these two old stablemates back under the same roof," said Open Media's managing director Bruce Hawker. "I remember well when both were launched and have watched them become veritable institutions within the Algarve's international community."

While Open Media plans extensive development of the ESA website, Bruce Hawker confirms that the overall spirit and concept of the Entdecken Sie Algarve print edition will remain intact, with the same team working on the magazine, including Arne Steingräber who will stay on as consultant editor. Steingräber, the creator of Algarve Vida Magazine, will also be developing new digital offerings for the Algarve's community in close cooperation with Open Media.

With the imminent launch of Open Media's French language magazine and website Vivre l'Algarve, the integration of these two magazines brings the total number of print publications in the group up to 10 in Portugal, alongside joint venture projects abroad such as Essential Macau and Essential Kuala Lumpur.
