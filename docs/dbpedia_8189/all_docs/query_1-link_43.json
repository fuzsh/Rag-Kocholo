        "text": "I wrote an article for Wired in which I got to talk with a lot of really interesting people about the importance of language to public health: Covid-19 Is History’s Biggest Translation Challenge.\n\nYou, a person who’s currently on the English-speaking internet in The Year of The Pandemic, have definitely seen public service information about Covid-19. You’ve probably been unable to escape seeing quite a lot of it, both online and offline, from handwashing posters to social distancing tape to instructional videos for face covering.\n\nBut if we want to avoid a pandemic spreading to all the humans in the world, this information also has to reach all the humans of the world—and that means translating Covid PSAs into as many languages as possible, in ways that are accurate and culturally appropriate.\n\nIt’s easy to overlook how important language is for health if you’re on the English-speaking internet, where “is this headache actually something to worry about?” is only a quick Wikipedia article or WebMD search away. For over half of the world’s population, people can’t expect to Google their symptoms, nor even necessarily get a pamphlet from their doctor explaining their diagnosis, because it’s not available in a language they can understand. […]\n\nAccording to a regularly updated list maintained by the Endangered Languages Project, Covid information from reputable sources (such as governments, nonprofits, and volunteer groups that clearly cite the sources of their health advice) has been created in over 500 languages and counting, including over 400 videos in more than 150 languages. A few of these projects are shorter, more standardized information in a larger variety of global languages, such as translating the five WHO guidelines into posters in more than 220 languages or translating the WHO’s mythbuster fact sheets into over 60 languages. But many of them, especially the ones in languages that aren’t as well represented on the global stage, are created by individual, local groups who feel a responsibility to a particular area, including governments, nonprofits, and volunteer translators with a little more education or internet access.\n\nRead the whole thing.\n\nThe Lingthusiasm main episode was about tracing languages back before recorded history (transcript) and the bonus episode was about doing linguistics with kids. We also released new nonmedical face masks, by popular request, in our IPA, tree diagram, and esoteric symbol prints. It’s a weird world where suddenly face masks are our most popular merch item, but we’re heartened to hear from people that it makes them feel a bit more cheerful about wearing a mask.\n\nWe also announced the winners of the 2020 LingComm Grants! We had over 75 applications from around the world and we’d like to thank all applicants for making the job of deciding extremely difficult! Stay tuned for further updates from these great projects:\n\nThe Black Language Podcast (Anansa Benbow)\n\nNonbinary Linguistics youtube channel (Nina Lorence-Ganong)\n\nJazicharnica (Јазичарница) blog (Nina Tunteva and Viktorija Blazheska)\n\nWar of Words podcast (Juana de los Santos, Angela Makeviciuz, Antonella Moschetti, Néstor Bermúdez)\n\nMedia list:\n\nuserlike.com – mention – 6/2\n\nCNN – mention “Why we can’t stop waving at the end of video calls” – 6/23\n\nTheRemindsMe – feature –6/17 (podcast)\n\nzandlslant.com – roundup –6/12 (newsletter/blog)\n\ncognitionandculture.net – mention – 6/15 (newsletter/blog)\n\nSelected tweets:\n\nA list of podcast episodes featuring Black linguists talking about various topics\n\nPrepositions paired with “fuck”\n\nOver-the-top adjective names for birds: the birding/linguistics crossover I’ve been waiting for\n\nClearing things off the chair and other trivial adjustments\n\nSpace/coffee: new favourite example of word boundary ambiguity\n\nthe spot/spought merger\n\nLong Hundred: a cursèd and entirely real Wikipedia article (thread about numbers)\n\nSelected blog posts:\n\nA TEDx talk by John Baugh on linguistic profiling\n\nHow do you sign “Black Lives Matter” in ASL?\n\nLinguistics jobs: dance instructor and stay-at-home mom\n\nA meme taxonomy\n\nHow to tell apart various languages that use the Arabic script\n\nA linguistic perspective: The harmful effects of responding ‘All lives matter’ to ‘Black lives matter’\n\n68:Hazard:Cold, a short story by Janelle Shane which does interesting things with language\n\nThis month’s image is one of the new IPA masks, which I now also own! They’re made out of a soft, jersey-like material and are pretty comfortable for short wear.\n\nCross-posted from my blog, All Things Linguistic.\n\n2019 was a very big year for me.\n\nMy book about internet language, which I’d been working on since 2014, finally came out into the world! Because Internet hit the New York Times bestseller list and was one of TIME’s 100 books of 2019, plus tons of other media.\n\nI wrote two op-eds for the New York Times and continued writing my Resident Linguist column at Wired, and we made two special video episodes of my podcast, Lingthusiasm.\n\nBook: Because Internet\n\nThere were over 200 media hits for Because Internet in 2019, at final count. Here are a few highlights:\n\nTwo (!!) reviews in the New York Times, by Jennifer Szalai (NYT Daily) and Clay Shirky (NYT Book Review)\n\nTwo reviews in the New Yorker, by Katy Waldman and Mary Norris\n\nReviews in: The Economist, Time Magazine, Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, Science Magazine, The Times (of London), the Observer/Guardian, BBC Science Focus.\n\nNPR: All Things Considered and Science Friday\n\nBBC World News\n\nTrade reviews: Kirkus, Publisher’s Weekly (starred), Booklist, and Library Journal\n\nPodcasts: The Cracked Podcast, The Allusionist, Grammar Girl, Slate’s “Lexicon Valley”, New York Times Book Review podcast, The Ezra Klein Show\n\nLists: TIME’s 100 Must-Read Books of 2019, Goodreads Choice Award Semifinalist, an Amazon Best Nonfiction Book of 2019\n\nMy publisher made me a special leather-bound version of Because Internet in celebration of it becoming a New York Times bestseller.

Recommended if you like Unicode jokes.\n\nIn May, I recorded the Because Internet audiobook! Here’s a thread with my linguistic thoughts about the process and an audio sample of me reading the audiobook.\n\nIn July, I went to the LSA Summer Institute in UC Davis, to do a lingwiki Wikipedia editathon focussing on articles about underrepresented languages, a talk about effective communication of linguistics to a general audience, and MC’d the 3 Minute Thesis event. Plus, I had book launch party in Montreal with Argo Bookshop!\n\nIn September, I did a book event in Toronto in conversation with Ryan North (of Dinosaur Comics fame), featuring a packed house with many old friends at The Ossington with Flying Booksn. I also went to XOXO fest in Portland, and did two talks about the book in Seattle, with Textio and the Seattle Review of Books and Elliott Bay Books.\n\nIn October, I was on a panel about busting language myths through podcasting at Sound Education in Boston. I was also on panels about Using Language for Worldbuilding (moderator) and “What did we say before we said Cool?” at Scintillation, a small speculative fiction convention in Montreal.\n\nI now have a speaking reel! So if you’ve ever wondered what it’s like when I’m giving a talk about internet linguistics, you can now watch a five minute highlights video here!\n\nI collaborated on several Language Files videos with youtuber Tom Scott:\n\nwhy typing like this is sometimes okay.\n\nWhy “No Problem” can seem rude: Phatic expressions\n\nThe language sounds that could exist, but don’t\n\nCan the words you read change your behaviour?\n\nWhy do we move our hands when we talk?\n\nLingthusiasm Podcast\n\nWe celebrated our third year of Lingthusiasm, a podcast that’s enthusiastic about linguistics which I make with Lauren Gawne.
