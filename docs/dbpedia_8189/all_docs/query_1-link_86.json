        "text": "A version of this piece was published in Northwestern’s Scene + Heard magazine.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to my birth, a group of developers, proud as any mother, are putting the final touches on Resident Evil 4. The control inputs are being smoothed out, the slightly-pixelated textures implemented, Leon’s iconic catchphrases woven into the cutscenes. In a process as intricate as anything we know, lines of inscrutable code resolve into bleak villages, foreboding castles, chainsaw-wielding maniacs, tentacle-headed zombies. Guns blazing, Leon S. Kennedy swoops into a remote Spanish village and saves the president’s daughter from polygonal monsters, time and time and time again, each repetition becoming a little more polished, a little more real, until the final release date: January 11th, 2005.\n\n(“Final” release date.)\n\nI am born a short time later. Struggling to achieve consciousness and personhood, I have no idea of the waves Resident Evil 4 immediately creates in the gaming landscape, waves we can still feel nineteen years later. To oversimplify it; every game that uses a camera over the character’s shoulder (especially shooters) owes it to Resident Evil 4: The Last of Us, Breath of the Wild, Elden Ring, Metal Gear Rising, Fortnite, Red Dead Redemption 2, Max Payne… I could list them for hours. While earlier games in the Resident Evil franchise used fixed cameras, picking a specific corner of each room to view your character from, Resident Evil 4 had the first true third-person over-the-shoulder perspective, the camera looking down the sights of Leon's pistol right along with him. It worked so well that it became the standard for the next two decades, unchallenged to this day. The camera in, conservatively, a third of the most popular games today was directly inspired by Resident Evil 4, and that’s without even mentioning all the other influences it had.\n\nGame reviewers in 2005 pick up on this right away, extolling the virtues of the unique camera system and reassuring players that this strange new system is still easy to control (Gamespot). Elsewhere, game developers take notes that will directly lead to Uncharted, Dead Space, God of War, and countless others (ScreenRant). Somewhere in North Carolina, the video essayist who will eventually introduce me to the game begs his parents to buy it, arguing that now that he’s had his Bar Mitzvah, he should be allowed to play adult-rated games. The events that will lead to me playing Resident Evil 4 are already being set in motion, the waves it made already on their way to hit me.\n\nI can’t say I’m having as outsized of an impact on the world quite yet. Heck, mostly I’m just sleeping. Let’s jump ahead a bit.\n\nOctober 2005. Resident Evil 4 is ported to the Playstation 2. It includes extra functionalities and downloadable expansions. According to the CDC, I can probably make sounds other than crying, which is an extra functionality of some sort.\n\nMay 2007. Resident Evil 4 is ported to the PC. My mother has been teaching me sign language and I now communicate frequently and insistently, not relenting until I get exactly what I want. Seventeen years later, I can barely remember any of it other than scattered signs for “cookie,” “more,” and “all done.” My mom and I still use it as an inside joke sometimes, but it doesn’t translate as well now that I’m in college, talking to her over the phone instead of face-to-face.\n\nJune 2007. Resident Evil 4 is ported to the Wii, with added motion control aiming. Leon now whips his gun around as fast as you can throw your Wii remote at the TV. Keep your wrist strap on. I am currently learning to run.\n\nJuly 2009. Resident Evil 4 mobile edition releases on iOS. I have known how to read for about half a year now, which is terrible news for everyone who wanted me to be “normal” and “not a nerd.” One of my friends took a finger swipe out of the frosting on my last birthday cake and I will never forgive her.\n\nSeptember 2011. Resident Evil 4 HD launches on PS3 and Xbox 360, the first big graphical update to the game. Textures across the board are higher-resolution: the blood on the chainsaw is a bit more realistic, the stones in the castle have a bit more definition, the blasts from the gun are a little bit brighter. My little sister has been born for nearly half a year.\n\nApril 2013. Resident Evil 4 finally releases on Android. I am wrapping up 4th grade. My teacher gives me a spider plant to take home as a way to remember the year. I am sad to change classrooms, but mostly just excited for the summer.\n\nFebruary 2014. Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition releases on PC. A simple port of the HD version, nothing noteworthy. I’ve forgotten my spider plant outside over the winter, and the feet of snow we get smother it in ice.\n\nFebruary 2014. Someone named Cris makes a post on an obscure website titled “Finally Gonna Do It.” Unsatisfied with the current HD edition, Cris announces he’s going to make an HD mod for Resident Evil 4. He has little experience. The project will continue for the next nine years and accumulate over ten thousand hours of work, becoming one of the most detailed and time-consuming love letters to a game ever created. My mom finds my spider plant outside and nurses it back to health. Eleven years later, it sits in my college dorm, overflowing its pot as it reaches toward the sun.\n\nAugust 2016. Resident Evil 4 releases on Playstation 4 and Xbox One. Despite getting rid of the “HD” title, this is essentially the same game that released in 2011. A timeless classic. Cris (and now Albert) are continuing to work on their HD mod, updating room after room, texture after texture. I am about to start middle school and I’m scared of the change. I don’t feel like an “adolescent.” I’m pretty sure I’m still a kid.\n\nMay 2019. Resident Evil 4 releases on the Nintendo Switch: a true mobile version is available for the first time. Theoretically I could buy this version on my shiny new Switch, but I have not yet tired of the cartoony Nintendo games it came with. Middle school is in the past now, high school looming in my future. This will be my first time at a new school, but at least my friends are coming with me. I’m sure we’ll stick together. Albert continues to update the HD mod. Cris has not posted for months.\n\nOctober 2021. Resident Evil 4 VR releases on the Oculus Quest 2, a complete reimagining of the game in virtual reality. It abandons the iconic, game-changing, third-person perspective to put you into Leon’s head, the enemies’ bullets fired directly at your skull. I hope you know the steps to loading a shotgun. Covid has come (hitting a week before my birthday) and gone (the restrictions lifting just before my junior year of high school). Everything seems just a little bit off now. My english teacher introduces me to a video essayist named Jacob Geller. He made a video on the Resident Evil 4 HD Mod a year ago, and I will discover it soon, my first real introduction to this game I have unknowingly grown up alongside, told through the lens of art restoration. It is breathtaking.\n\nMarch 2023. The Resident Evil 4 Remake releases for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X only a couple of days before my birthday. It is nothing short of spectacular, a faithful recreation of the nineteen-year-old original, new graphics and updated controls drawing it into a new decade. Version 1.0 of the Resident Evil 4 HD Mod has been out for nearly a year now, beautiful in a different way than Remake, a labor of love seen to high-definition completion. Now in my senior year of high school, I have read and watched countless essays on Resident Evil 4. I’ve developed an interest in doing my own writing on games, and in a few short months I’ll start publishing my work. For now I watch other people do it, amazed by the stories they can weave with words, captivated by the beautiful rhythm of the games behind them. I recently got an Xbox to play Microsoft Flight Simulator, and it seems as if the gates have been sprung wide open, the world at my feet, any game at my fingertips. Resident Evil 4 is at the top of my list.\n\nMay 2023. No Resident Evil 4 release — I have no time for video games in the depths of IB exam hell. I am struggling through 4 hour tests while cherishing some of the last moments I’ll have with my friends. College looms around the corner, immense, unknowable, and terrifying. Saying goodbye to my english teacher is especially hard.\n\nAugust 2023. A summer that is both long and short, filled with vacations and camps and desperate hang-outs with friends before they leave for college. My college starts later than everyone else’s, and I am left staring at the blank TV, the hectic Mariokart rounds and wild Smash Bros tournaments serving to simply point out the depressing absence of my friends. I glance at my Xbox, then convince my mom to take me with her on her next Target run. I know exactly what I am going to buy.\n\nRunning my hands over the Resident Evil 4 Remake case, it doesn’t feel quite real. This is a game steeped in history, a history I can barely comprehend. I think of the videos I’ve watched, the articles I’ve read, each trying to convey how amazing, breathtaking, mindblowing this game was in 2005. Today, it’s just another third-person shooter. It so definitively created the genre that it is still a shining example of it, a timeless classic, only the landscape around it changing to match. I have never been alive for a game that was not influenced by this one. In fact, I’ve never been alive for a world untouched by Resident Evil 4. It has simply been a fact of life for my entire existence, casting a long shadow whether I was aware of it or not. There is no way of truly knowing all the ways it affected my life, or the lives of the people who affected me, or the lives of the people who affected them. All I know is that it did.\n\nI insert the disc carefully into my Xbox, adjusting the brightness lower (but not as low as they suggest) to make the darkened hallways all the scarier. The opening cutscene plays, one I’ve seen a thousand times before but never experienced (will never experience). I slowly start moving Leon through the forest, the setting familiar and new all at once. Playing this game feels inevitable, like something I’ve been meant to do for a long time.\n\nWhen I make it to the village, I barricade myself in the house to hide from the bloody-masked chainsaw man. Trapped with no way out, I triumphantly spot the shotgun and turn around to blast the enemies to kingdom come, blood and guts splattering the screen. Overlaid on my own playthrough is the knowledge that Jacob Geller had this exact experience, has described this exact triumphant shotgun blast. I see a flash of every other player doing this, thousands upon thousands of them, fingers mashing the “fire” button since before I was born. I am playing this game through the hands of others, my own experiences never quite separate from the secondhand history I’ve built up in my head.\n\nI will never understand what Resident Evil 4 was like to play in 2005, and in this way, I will never truly play the game. I can only play the game that Resident Evil 4 has become, filtered through everyone and everything that has come before me, the context around it growing and changing while it stays essentially the same. A timeless classic so far removed from its origins that its original form is nothing more than a blurry memory, a time and place I can never inhabit.\n\nI have changed immeasurably since the release of Resident Evil 4. Nineteen years of life have made me (definitely) taller and (debatably) wiser. A college transfer lies ahead of me now, somehow not as scary as the rest of my school changes. Maybe it's because I have some constants in my life now. Resident Evil 4, for all its releases, has changed very little. From 2005 all the way to 2023, it maintains the same rhythm, the same satisfying shoot, kick, run loop that works so beautifully. When I return to the game, as I often do now, I know exactly what to expect. It feels like an old friend I’ve known for forever, far longer than the year ago I started playing it. In a way, it has been with me this whole time. Guns blazing, Leon S. Kennedy swoops into a remote Spanish village and saves the president’s daughter from polygonal monsters, time and time and time again. I do not know where his journey started or where it will end, but I’m happy to join him for a while, me and all the other people still playing this masterpiece of a game."
