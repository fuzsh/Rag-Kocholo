        "text": "10 Magazine, the London-based independent fashion publication, will launch 10 Deutsch, a new German/Northern European edition, with Berlin-based stylist and creative director Toby Grimditch as editor-in-chief in March 2025. The content will be distributed across a global multi-channel network with a focus on print, digital, video and all social platforms. The 10 Deutsch print women’s title will mirror the schedule of 10 UK, 10 USA, 10 Japan and 10 Australia, publishing biannually in September and March. More details of the 10 Deutsch editorial team will be announced in the coming months.\n\n10 Deutsch, which joins four other international titles in the 10 Magazine stable – 10 UK (launched 24 years ago in London, by global editor-in-chief Sophia Neophitou), 10 USA (edited by Dora Fung and launched in September 2023), 10 Australia (edited by Alison Veness and launched in 2013) and 10 Japan (edited by Saori Masuda and launching in September 2024) – represents another major expansion for the 10 brand.\n\nBorn in London, Toby Grimditch started his fashion career as a producer at leading global creative talent agency, Streeters. In 2007 he decided to embark on a career in styling and creative direction, working for over 13 years as fashion director at Dansk magazine, in addition to fashion director at Under The Influence and most recently, as creative director of Autre magazine. He has worked across a multitude of esteemed titles, including CR Fashion Book, Garage, i-D, Interview, Novembre, Numero, Muse, Vanity Fair USA and V Magazine. He collaborates with an exciting roster of photographers and image makers from across the globe. Berlin has been Grimditch’s home for the past 10 years and he looks forward to spending many more years in the German capital. 10 Magazine global editor-in-chief, Sophia Neophitou-Apostolou, is delighted to welcome such an esteemed editor to the 10 family.\n\n“This fourth global edition represents the first step of a European expansion for the 10 Magazine brand. I am excited to be working with Toby Grimditch and welcome him into the 10 Magazine family in his new position as editor-in-chief of 10 Deutsch. He’s been a valuable contributor to 10 for four years and his vision and creativity have always been an inspiration to me. He brings modernity and a confidence to the pages and I’m extremely excited to see 10 Deutsch come to life under his inspirational leadership.” – Sophia Neophitou-Apostolou, global editor-in-chief, 10 Magazine.\n\n“I’m honoured to be part of the 10 Magazine family, and to evolve the brand alongside Sophia and her wonderful team. Not only is she a creative powerhouse and well respected within our industry, her incredible business acumen and moral compass is to be admired. And of course, her wonderful sense of fun and adventure is a source of inspiration for us all. It’s these core values that will inform the new 10 Deutsch. This country has such a wealth of talent: I look forward to showcasing Germany’s rising generation of artists across the spectrum of fashion, art, film and music, alongside an array of established greats. And I can’t wait to get started.” – Toby Grimditch, editor-in-chief, 10 Deutsch.\n\nRead about the launch on WWD here."
