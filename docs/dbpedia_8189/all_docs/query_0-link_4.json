        "text": "Doing my PhD in England, I have barely talked about research in German, which is my mother tongue. In English, a publication in a journal is usually called a paper, or more formally, an article.\n\nWhen I talked to German colleagues in England, they’d usually say Paper as well, even when talking in German. I’d always insist on saying Artikel, but I was quite alone with that (although noone ever corrected me). Recently, my dad (who is not an academic) said that the use of Artikel in an academic context would ring false in his ears.\n\nWhat’s the correct way of saying (scientific, academic) article in German?\n\nSome candidates could be:\n\nArtikel (sounds strange)\n\nVeröffentlichung (is too general, could apply to books as well)\n\nAufsatz or Essay (doesn’t quite capture it, would rather be translated to essay than to article)\n\nHaving spent some time in academia now and having talked to many German academians, I am pretty convinced that there is no German word matching the English paper or article (which do not mean exactly the same by the way; article refers to the most common type of paper).\n\nIn journalism and PhD examination rules, you often find:\n\nVeröffentlichung in einer Fachzeitschrift or just Veröffentlichung, which does not really capture the type of the publication – e.g., an editorial or comment also qualifies as Veröffentlichung in einer Fachzeitschrift.\n\nMost importantly, Veröffentlichung explicitly implies publication, which paper doesn’t. For example a pre-print would already be called a paper but not Veröffentlichung.\n\n(wissenschaftlicher) Artikel, which probably comes closest but also implies publication (in my understanding). Ironically, while article implies a certain type of publication (in contrast to letters, for example), Artikel doesn’t. Thus Artikel is a better match for paper than for article.\n\nAlso, while paper is predominantly used for scientific publications and similar, Artikel can also apply to non-scientific ones, which may cause a misunderstanding in some cases.\n\n(wissenschaftliche) Abhandlung (rare, archaic), which again also includes books.\n\nSome academians also colloquially use Papier, which is arguably most precise with sufficient context, but, well, colloquial. Other people never use this word (in this context).\n\nanswered Dec 24, 2015 at 10:15\n\nWrzlprmft♦Wrzlprmft\n\n21.9k88 gold badges7272 silver badges133133 bronze badges"
