        "text": "In the days following Donald Trump's conviction in Manhattan, the Palm Beach Post said it received \"an outpouring of letters\" from its readers regarding his guilty verdict, including from several Florida residents who bashed the former president.\n\nIn one such letter, which was published by the Post, the hometown paper of Trump's residence in Palm Beach, a resident from Palm Beach Gardens praised the \"brave\" prosecutors and jurors who held Trump \"accountable for his myriad of misdeeds.\" In another, a Delray Beach resident pointed at Trump's conviction as a Republican problem, writing that the party will \"show that they, in fact, don't care about law and order\" if they \"cling\" to the former president for the 2024 election.\n\nTrump was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records last week in connection to a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election. But the former president and presumptive GOP presidential nominee for November maintains that he is innocent, and has accused prosecutors and the presiding judge for attempting to interfere with his reelection chances by bringing the charges against him.\n\n\"Following the verdict in his criminal trial, Donald Trump publicly accused the state of New York of subjecting him to a rigged trial, orchestrated by the Biden Administration to take down a political adversary,\" Bill Morris, who lives in Palm Beach Gardens, wrote to the Post. \"To the contrary, Trump is now a convicted felon. He is the actual person who has acted in a criminal manner to try to conceal information regarding his own behavior.\"\n\n\"Prosecutors and the jury have finally succeeded in holding Trump to account,\" Morris added. \"Kudos to the brave souls who have upheld the rule of law and have shown by example how to hold Trump accountable for his myriad of misdeeds.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump is now a convicted criminal,\" wrote Delray Beach resident Alaric Lurie. \"It will be very interesting to see if the party of law and order abandons him as their candidate, or if they'll cling to him and show that they, in fact, don't care about law and order, and that they always just wanted to imprison minorities.\"\n\n\"One has to find it rich when Donald Trump's defense attorney calls Michael Cohen the GLOAT, Greatest Liar of All Time, while representing a man who was tracked lying over 31,000 times while president,\" Juno Beach resident John B. Kern wrote to the Post. \"Once again you can't make this stuff up.\"\n\nIn another letter published by the newspaper, Kirk Harris of North Palm Beach called out Trump's Republican allies who have rebuked the jury's decision.\n\n\"How many times are we going to hear what a sad day May 30 was for America? I agree that it was a very sad day but not for most of the reasons you have heard,\" Harris wrote. \"The system worked.\"\n\n\"What is so sad is the response by the senior MAGA Republicans, including the speaker of the House and the minority leader in the Senate,\" they added. \"Instead of supporting and defending our system and constitution, they choose to try to tear it down at the behest of their mob boss, now a convicted felon. Who is threat to our democracy now?\"\n\nNewsweek sent an email to Trump's campaign Monday evening for comment on the letters.\n\nThe Post also posted a sample of letters from readers who support the former president. In one note by Boca Raton resident Rich Klitzberg, the reader accused the prosecutors in Trump's case of conducting a \"rapacious and unprincipled battle\" in order to benefit Democrats in November.\n\n\"Never in our history has a more venal cabal of lawyers conducted a more rapacious and unprincipled battle against a political adversary than the trial that ended with a guilty finding against Donald Trump,\" Klitzberg said. \"The Democrats' hate for Trump stems from his defeat of their anointed candidate in 2016, Hillary Clinton, and his threat to undo their stranglehold on the Washington bureaucracy.\"\n\n\"So, to bring him down they manufactured felonious charges, put together a team of Sovietized prosecutors and chose a judge who was a denier of all fair challenges,\" the reader added. \"No one was surprised by the verdict, which almost surely will be reversed on appeal.\"\n\nJupiter resident Bill Gambin wrote a letter bashing other notes published by the Post that have \"maligned President Donald Trump as someone who dislikes our military, and as a president who would sell America out to Russia or North Korea.\"\n\n\"What ridiculous allegations these are to suggest,\" Gambin added. \"Mr. Trump was already president, and neither of these was even remotely true. If you don't think Trump is fit to be our commander in chief, that is any citizen's right. It does not have to be justified with dishonest and childish exaggerations.\"\n\nAnother reader suggested that the former president should be given a light sentence for his guilty verdict. Legal experts have told Newsweek that it is unlikely that Trump will be handed prison time when sentenced on July 11, given the logistics of keeping a top political candidate and former president with a full secret service detail behind bars.\n\n\"A better punishment for his crimes would be to sentence Trump to five years of probation and 500 hours of community service,\" wrote Riviera Beach resident Richard Gruber. \"The sentence should require that he report, in person, to his parole officer and that he must complete his community service within the first year of his sentence.\"\n\n\"Both the parole and the service must take place in New York state. Should he fail to comply with the conditions of his sentence, he would be remanded to prison to serve out the balance of his probation, and he would still be required to complete his community service before he would be eligible to leave the state,\" Gruber added."
