You can ask CBSA staff to document your firearm on Form BSF407, Identification of Articles for Temporary Exportation, before you leave the country or provide a copy of the export permit under which the firearm was exported.

However, the United States requires an import permit. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) issue the required import permit. Applicable forms are available on the ATF website.\n\nIf you are exporting prohibited firearms from Canada to the United States you need a PAL, registration certificate, paper ATT and an export permit from Global Affairs Canada.\n\nExporting firearms to countries other than the United States\n\nIf you are exporting any class of firearm to countries other than the United States an export permit is required from Global Affairs Canada. In addition, you need to present a PAL and dependent on the classification of the firearm a registration certificate and a paper ATT.\n\nBefore exporting these goods, check with customs officials of the country you intend to enter for their requirements.\n\nYou must also advise the Canadian Firearms Program of any permanent exportation of a restricted or prohibited firearm from Canada. This makes it possible for officials there to update the information contained in the Canadian Firearms Registry. For more information, please call the Canadian Firearms Program at 1-800-731-4000, or review their frequently asked questions.\n\nHunting requirements\n\nFirearms are forbidden in many of Canada's national and provincial parks, game reserves and adjacent areas. Hunting in Canada is governed by federal, provincial and territorial laws. If you hunt in Canada, you must have a hunting licence from each province or territory you plan to hunt in. If you need more information about parks and hunting regulations, contact the appropriate provincial or territorial tourism information office or hunting licence authority.\n\nPlease note that only non-restricted firearms can be used for hunting purposes and protection against wildlife in remote areas. Use of firearms for personal protection, or protection of property is not deemed a valid purpose to import firearms into Canada.\n\nTransporting firearms\n\nCanadian law states that you have to transport all firearms, including antique firearms, unloaded. If you are transporting them in a vehicle, they must be kept out of sight in a part of a vehicle that is kept locked (the trunk, if there is one), unless the vehicle is supervised by an adult. You have to transport restricted and prohibited firearms in a locked case and equip them with locked safety devices to prevent firing. Antique handguns do not require a secure locking device, although all other transportation provisions apply.\n\nIf you are flying, please visit Canadian Air Transport Security Authority's website for information concerning the transportation of firearms and/or ammunition by air.\n\nForeign requirements\n\nImporters are reminded that foreign countries, including the United States, have different legal requirements that apply to the purchase, possession, transportation and exportation of firearms, ammunition, weapons and related items. It is recommended that you contact the appropriate authorities in the country you are visiting, to determine if any requirements apply to your situation."
