This authorization must be obvious or verified. If they are handed over for the purpose of commercial transport, proper transport must be ensured and precautions must be taken against loss. Ammunition may be handed over commercially only in sealed packages; this shall not apply on shooting ranges in accordance with Section 12 (2) no. 2 or to individual pieces acquired by ammunition collectors. Anyone who hands over weapons or ammunition to another solely for the purpose of commercial transport (Section 12 (1) no. 2, (2) no. 1) to a third party shall be regarded as handing them over to the third party.\n\n(2) The holder of a licence under Section 21 (1) first sentence who hands over a gun to another on the basis of a licence under Section 10 (1) or an equivalent licence shall immediately and indelibly enter on the weapon owner`s licence the manufacturer`s mark or trademark and, if available, the serial number of the weapon, as well as the date handed over and the name and address of the company and shall report the handing over to the competent authorities in writing within two weeks.

If this authorization is provided by a weapon owner`s licence, the number of this licence and the issuing authority shall also be stated. If a gun is being handed over to a licence holder as referred to in Section 21 (1) first sentence, the notification need only state the name of the company and branch address.\n\n(3) Subsections 1 and 2 shall not apply to persons who hand over guns or ammunition to someone who acquires them outside the territory governed by this Act, in particular if they are consigned in the name of the first person.

In case of sentence 3, the publisher of the advertisement shall be required to keep a record of the transaction for one year and to allow the competent authorities to inspect this record on request.\n\n(2) The holder of a licence under Section 21 (1) who retails guns requiring a licence to carry or shoot shall inform the person acquiring them of this licence requirement. When selling weapons that fire blanks or irritants and weapons used for signalling as referred to in Section 10 (4) fourth sentence, the holder of a licence under Section 21 (1) shall further inform the person acquiring such weapons that carrying such weapons without a licence (minor firearms certificate) is a punishable offence, and shall document fulfilment of this obligation and the obligation to provide information pursuant to sentence 1.\n\n(3) It shall be prohibited to sell or hand over guns, ammunition, or cutting or thrust weapons\n\n1. as an itinerant trader, except in the cases referred to in Section 55b (1) of the Trades Regulation Code,\n\n2. at scheduled events as defined in Chapter IV of the Trades Regulation Code (trade fairs, exhibitions, markets), although orders may be taken at trade fairs and exhibitions,\n\n3. at festivals, shooting festivals, markets, collectors` meetings or similar public events, except for the handing over of the necessary guns and ammunition at a shooting range and ammunition which forms or is to form part of a collection (Section 17 (1)).\n\nThe competent authorities may grant exemptions from this ban in their district if this is not contrary to public interests.\n\ntable of contents\n\nSection 36\n\nStoring weapons or ammunition\n\n(1) Anyone who possesses weapons or ammunition shall take the necessary precautions to keep them from being lost or stolen by unauthorized third parties.

Up to ten long firearms shall be deemed to be securely stored if they are stored in a security grade A container in accordance with VDMA 24992 (as of May 1995) or an equivalent standard of another EEA Member State. Rooms secured in a comparable manner shall be deemed equivalent.\n\n(3) Anyone in possession of weapons, ammunition or banned weapons requiring a licence or anyone who has applied for a licence to own such items shall provide the competent authorities with proof of measures taken or planned for their secure storage. Owners of weapons, ammunition or banned weapons requiring a licence shall also grant the authorities access to the places in which weapons and ammunition are stored in order to check compliance with subsections 1 and 2. The authorities may enter living areas against the owner`s will only to prevent an urgent threat to public security; the basic right to inviolability of the home (Article 13 of the Basic Law) shall therefore be limited to this extent.\n\n(4) If the storage of weapons and ammunition, the acquisition and possession of which require a licence, does not comply with the requirements of this Act or of a statutory instrument pursuant to subsection 5, the owner shall have until 31 August 2003 to take the necessary additional measures to ensure storage in compliance with these requirements.

Such orders may\n\n1. define specifications for technical security systems to prevent the unauthorized removal or use of guns,\n\n2. require the retrofitting or replacement of existing security systems,\n\n3. require guns to be equipped with mechanical, electronic or biometric security systems.\n\n(6) Where a higher standard of security is necessary in individual cases, in particular on account of the type and quantity of weapons or ammunition to be stored or the storage location, the competent authorities shall order the necessary additional measures and set an appropriate deadline for their implementation.\n\n1 Published by Beuth-Verlag GmbH, Berlin and Cologne.\n\n2 The German engineering federation VDMA (Verband Deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbau e.

This obligation shall also apply to persons subject to a ban under Section 41 (1) or (2). These persons may refuse to answer such questions if answering would expose either them personally or relatives as referred to in Section 383 (1) nos. 1 through 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure to the risk of criminal prosecution or proceedings under the Administrative Offences Act. Licence holders shall also demonstrate compliance with conditions.\n\n(2) If the person required to provide information manufactures or deals in weapons or operates a shooting range or security firm, the persons assigned by the competent authorities to monitor the business shall have the right to enter the business property and premises during business and working hours in order to carry out checks and inspections, take samples and examine business records. In order to prevent urgent threats to public security or order, these premises may also be inspected outside these times, and the living areas of the person required to provide information may be inspected against his or her will. The basic right to inviolability of the home (Article 13 of the Basic Law) shall therefore be limited to this extent.\n\n(3) With good cause, the competent authorities may order owners of\n\n1. weapons or ammunition which may only be acquired with a licence, or\n\n2. banned weapons as described in Annex 2, Part 1\n\nto present these weapons or ammunition along with licences or special licences within a reasonable deadline to be set by these authorities.\n\ntable of contents\n\nChapter 7\n\nBans\n\ntable of contents\n\nSection 40\n\nBanned weapons\n\n(1) The handling ban shall also include a ban on instructing or ordering the manufacture of objects described in Annex 2, Part 1, no. 1.3.4.\n\n(2) The ban on handling weapons or ammunition shall not apply to persons acting on a court or official order.\n\n(3) By way of derogation from Section 2 (3), holders of a hunting licence and members of leather- or fur-processing trades may use fist knives pursuant to Annex 2, Part 1, no. 1.4.2, where they need such knives to pursue their activities.

This shall apply in particular to demolition work, disaster management activities, theatres and similar institutions, film and television production and the training for such occupations.\n\n(4) Upon application, the Federal Criminal Police Office may grant general or specific exemptions to the ban set out in Annex 2, Part 1, if the applicant`s interests outweigh the public interest in enforcing the ban. In particular, this may be assumed to be the case if the weapons or ammunition listed in Annex 2, Part 1 are destined for transfer out of the territory governed by this Act, for scientific or research purposes or to expand a collection of cultural and historical significance and there is no reason to fear a significant threat to public security.\n\n(5) Anyone who takes possession of a weapon listed in Annex 2, Part 1 as an heir, finder, or in a similar manner shall notify the competent authorities without delay. The competent authorities may seize the weapons or ammunition or order that they be rendered unserviceable, be modified so that they are no longer subject to a ban, or be handed over to an authorized person within a reasonable deadline, or may order the person who acquired them to submit an application in accordance with subsection 4.
