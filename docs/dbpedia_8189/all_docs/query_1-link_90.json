        "text": "Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.\n\nDanial Adkison remembers reading The New York Times in college and thinking the paper seemed a little stodgy.\n\n“The Old Gray Lady, you know?” Mr. Adkison said.\n\nBut even then, when the front page was printed only in black and white, the headlines stood out. He admired them for their wit; they weren’t obvious and they didn’t insult the reader’s intelligence.\n\n“The people who work there have a sense of humor,” Mr. Adkison remembers thinking.\n\nMr. Adkison is one of those people now: a senior staff editor on the Print Hub, charged with adapting the digital version of the paper to print, editing copy and writing headlines.\n\nHe is a serial winner of “headline of the week,” an honor bestowed by the senior editor Mark Bulik, who is known by at least one masthead editor as “the headline czar.”\n\n“He’s one of the best headline writers in the building,” Mr. Bulik said of Mr. Adkison. “I haven’t run across many people who can do really good headlines that consistently.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
