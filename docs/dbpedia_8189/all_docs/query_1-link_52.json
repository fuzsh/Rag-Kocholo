        "text": "Exclusive: Hamilton’s Renée Elise Goldsberry On Being Honored By Resident MagazinePosted by Wilson Morales\n\nSeptember 29, 2015\n\nVery recently, Blackfilm.com attended a exclusive VIP reception in which actress and singer Renée Elise Goldsberry was being honored by Resident Magazine. Goldsberry, who’s currently stars in the hottest show on Broadway, “Hamilton.” Goldsberry is on the cover of Resident’s Fall issue.\n\nHeld at a fabulous apartment on One57 on 57th Street in Manhattan, NY, the event was catered with hors d’oeuvres provided by the newly opened Il Valentino Osteria.\n\nGoldsberry, who is best known for her role as attorney Evangeline Williamson on the ABC soap opera, One Life to Live, has appeared in numerous TV series, theater productions, and starred in the rom-com film All About You. The California native was the last actress to play the role of Mimi Marquez in the Broadway musical Rent. Her performance as Angelica Schuyler Church in Hamilton as already won her both a Drama Desk Award and Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical.\n\nBlackfilm.com spoke with Resident’s publisher Michael Travin and Goldsberry about her inclusion in the magazine and being honored for her work.\n\nWhat makes Renée special to be on the cover of the magazine?\n\nMichael Travin: Just look at her. She’s beautiful. She’s on the hottest show on Broadway and she’s a mother, a wife and has to work six days a week. Just look at her smile. She’s an incredible individual.\n\nHow does it feel to be honored by Resident Magazine, especially now when your show has been well loved on Broadway?\n\nRenée Elise Goldsberry: The beauty of Resident Magazine, for whatever reason, have honored me with just focusing on me and my life and my career. Most of the press I do is on ‘Hamilton’ so both of them are an honor to talk about but it does feel extra special for someone to say “we want to talk about Renée Elise Goldsberry .” It gives me an opportunity to talk about my family and the people that support me in the ways that make it possible to take advantage of everything that is happening right now.\n\nIs the first time you have been on the cover of a magazine?\n\nREG: It’s the first I’ve been on the cover of a magazine by myself in a solo cover shoot.\n\nYou’ve been on TV, you’ve done films and theater, but why do you think Hamilton is taking you to another level?\n\nREG: It’s a blessing from God. I don’t really understand timing but it’s not really my job to understand it. I think my job is show up and be grateful and to continue to just show up for whatever might happen on any given day. I was very happy in my career. I felt I was already blessed, so this feels like grace and extra gravy on top of something like a cherry. The interesting thing is that this cherry is bigger than the rest of everything. It’s not a surprise to me that the show is being well received because I think the show is brilliant and I think is cast is brilliant. The decisions made behind the show have all been wise and divinely inspired. It is a surprise to me that I get to have this thrilling moment in my life to be celebrated with something that’s being lifted in a way that I have never seen happen before.\n\nI’ve been a part of a lot of exciting things in different venues as you mentioned, but I’ve never seen any piece of entertainment or art be celebrated while it was happening in such a universal way. We have so much support from all our politicians and from the actors in the theaters and the writers in the theater as well as the actors in film and television. Professional athletes and rappers and recording artists. That’s the thing that’s been really unique in this experience. It’s really busted out of the bubble that sometimes the most elite theater is in. That’s been beautiful and it’s for a group of people that are really telling an important story from their hearts. It’s been exciting for me to see a lot of really young people get to meet a lot of exciting people that are really impactful in their own right talking about how the show has been impactful in their own lives. It’s been really great.\n\nThe soundtrack is now out for sale and of the songs you sang, how much of a challenge was it for you to do the rapping part to a few of the tracks.\n\nREG: Honestly, the rap is so well written, I get a lot of attention for it being a virtuosic rap, even from the best rappers in the world. That’s really exciting, but it’s so well written and so well supported, the created team and the cast and the story do most of the work. At this point, it’s a muscle memory and it’s an emotional memory. It’s a machine that moves, and I’m just grateful to God for the gift given an anew, every single performance and be able to pull it off. It’s well written, well constructed and well produced.\n\nFor anyone coming to New York, and hasn’t been in the theater scene, what’s a good reason to see Hamilton?"
