        "meta_description": "FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — A Frankfort resident is connecting Cuban refugees to their new Kentucky home through a Spanish-language magazine he puts together from his basement office. The Lexington Herald-Leader (http://bit.ly/2izRLve ) reports Luis David Fuentes owns and edits El Kentubano, which is distributed free to the public. The magazine includes articles about art, sports, entertainment, real estate, health and history. It has 64 pages and a print run of 10,000 copies. Fuentes said the name of the magazine is a nickname he gave to his son and daughter. Kentubano is a mixture of Kentucky and Cuba. When the magazine started in 2009, Fuentes said he noticed more Cuban groceries, restaurants and other businesses opening, and he saw a chance to link them with customers and the larger English-speaking community. \"My main goal is to provide a good source of information, especially to the new arrivals,\" Fuentes said. \"I think I'm helping them have a smoother transition to a new society.\" According to U.S. Census estimates, there were 9,200 people of Cuban descent living in Jefferson County in 2015, up from 2,300 in 2000. The magazine also includes items for Mexican natives and other Hispanic groups. Fuentes and his brother have a similar publication in Tampa, Florida. Fuentes was educated in Cuba as a mechanical engineer. He and his Cuban-born wife, whom he met in Chile, came to Kentucky in 2000. He has worked for 11 years for the state Division of Air Quality as an environmental engineer. He also owns a Lexington restaurant. ___ Information from: Lexington Herald-Leader, http://www.kentucky.com",
