Filled with coverage of all the best Casa de Campo events of the last few months, as well as fantastic wine, automobile and fashion features – we promise you’ll enjoy reading it wherever you decide to relax this summer; by the pool, at Minitas beach or aboard your own private yacht!\n\nThis, the latest issue of CasaLife, year 7, volume 2 will be delivered to your Casa de Campo villa within the next week and will soon start appearing in key locations around the Casa de Campo resort; Minitas Beach, the Marina Casa de Campo, Altos de Chavón and at the Casa de Campo hotel.\n\nIn this issue, we cover all the main social events and activities which have taken place in Casa de Campo since January – of which there have been many! You’ll find coverage of charity events; the Magical Splendor for Life Gala by the Fundación MIR, the Hogar del Niño annual fundraising weekend and the “Friend-raiser” cocktail and auction for the Altos de Chavón Foundation. We also invite you to enjoy our coverage of the 27th annual Sugar Golf Tournament hosted by Alfy Fanjul, which was celebrated across the Casa de Campo resort, as well as a cocktail at the Casa de Campo Yacht Club in the Marina Casa de Campo with Autozama and Mercedes Benz.\n\nAs CasaLife’s proud Social Events Editor, below I highlight 2 feature articles written by myself, I hope you enjoy them!\n\n“First Semana de Francia in Casa de Campo” by Rebecca Hughes\n\nThis 5-page spread covers all the key events of the 1st “Semana de Francia” festival celebrated across the Casa de Campo resort from the 22nd to the 25th of March 2012.\n\n“A Candid Fashion Talk With Designers Mark Badgley and James Mischka” – by Rebecca Hughes and Lisbet Fernández-Viña\n\nThis year, for the 3rd time, the Fundación MIR welcomed designers Mark Badgley and James Mischka to Casa de Campo to present their 2012 Spring-Summer collection at the annual Magical Splendor for Life Gala. During their stay I caught up with the two designers delving deep into the inspiration behind their fashion designs – adored by Casa de Campo ladies and celebrities alike!\n\nGreat news for Badgley Mischka fans – we’ve just heard that the pair will once again be returning for next year’s Magical Splendor for Life Gala, scheduled to take place on Saturday January the 19th 2013.\n\nBoth these fabulous feature articles and many more can be found in the latest issue of CasaLife – we hope you enjoy it!"
