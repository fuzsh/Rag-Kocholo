Another focus is the research on the history of Africa that is conducted in cooperation with the Maria Sibylla Merian Institute for Advanced Studies in Africa in Accra (Ghana). Thanks to its location, its international team, and its dense network of cooperation partners, the DHI Paris mediates between different academic cultures and promotes an internationally oriented historiography."
