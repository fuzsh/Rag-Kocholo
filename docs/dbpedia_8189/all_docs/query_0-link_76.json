        "text": "Image\n\nThe Russian Culture Theme House exists for students who want to learn about Russian culture through its language and who want to make Russian culture more prominent on campus.\n\nResidents of the Russian House are expected to speak Russian with each other in the house as much as possible and to take advantage of the presence of the native/heritage speakers (native/heritage speakers and advanced language students are expected to take some initiative, particularly with residents more hesitant about their speaking skills).\n\nMembers of the house will also be expected to take part in cultural all-campus events and weekly language-oriented events within the house, and to attend the Russian Table in Valentine Dining Hall — every Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on the Mezzanine level.\n\nRussian House hosts a чай (chai - an informal gathering and conversation over tea and cookies) every week on Thursdays at 9 pm. All students who are currently enrolled in Russian language and culture courses or simply have an interest or background in Russian or Russian culture are always welcome.\n\nA Russian film will be shown in the Keefe Campus Center Theater Auditorium on Thursdays at 4:30 and 7:30 p.m.\n\nPlease see the Events section for more detailed information on our many activities!\n\nContact Information\n\nFor any questions regarding the Russian House, please contact Michael Kunichika (mkunichika@amherst.edu).\n\nIs it possible to change a room in a theme house?\n\nAll internal house room changes take place according to the provisions of the House Constitution; the Faculty Advisor has the final say in the matter; the Advisor will consult the officers of the House in reaching the decision. Once the decision has been made, the House President will contact the Office of Residential Life so that the change can be made official and a new key issued."
