        "text": "Welcome to Ashford For You – Ashford Borough Council's residents’ magazine.\n\nAnniversaries are a key feature of this edition – we mark the 50th anniversary of the Kent & East Sussex Railway, the 60th anniversary of Ashford’s twinning with Bad Münstereifel and the 40th anniversary of twinning with Fougères.\n\nWe focus on new arrangements for bin collections, after we started a new waste and recycling contract with SUEZ. Also featured is the latest Ashford town centre mural that’s turning heads in Bank Street, while shining a spotlight on the Mayor’s two charities – Men in Sheds and Friends of the William Harvey Hospital.\n\nVoting at elections has changed and we outline the changes that could impact the way that you vote. We explain how Ashford’s single parliamentary constituency has been split into two, with maps showing which wards fall into the new constituencies, Ashford County and Weald of Kent.\n\nWe focus on caring for the community and also showcase a fantastic range of events and festivals that are certain to keep residents and visitors alike entertained this summer. And that’s not all – there are some fabulous prizes on offer in our competitions.\n\nYou can download our previous editions online.\n\nThis magazine is distributed to all households in the borough via Royal Mail and covers what’s going on in the local area, profiling services, people and places. We want to ensure we are communicating with all our residents and keeping them abreast of what is happening across the borough and the services we provide.\n\nWhile we know many residents use digital methods of communication, such as our website and social media channels, we do not reach everyone this way so we produce a borough-wide magazine to complement the other ways we communicate with our community.\n\nAdvertising in Ashford For You\n\nThe editorial and design has been produced in-house and includes external paid for advertising, which will offset some of the print and distribution costs.\n\nAs well as being delivered to 58,000 homes, copies of the magazine go on display at various locations across the borough including at the Ashford Gateway, County Square, Ashford Designer Outlet and many local shops.\n\nAnyone interested in advertising in the publication should contact the Communications Team on 01233 330543 or email media@ashford.gov.uk\n\nAshford For You advertising rates Page Rate per edition Outside back cover £1,395 Inside front cover £1,295 Inside back cover £1,195 Internal page £1,095 Half page £795 Quarter page £595\n\nCompetition terms and conditions"
