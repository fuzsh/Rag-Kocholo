However, top-tier medical journals are highly selective and only accept a small fraction of the submissions they receive. If you are new to publishing, you may want to consider submitting your work to a journal listed below that encourages submissions from students and residents.\n\nTo learn more about the article writing process, please review the Medical Library's guide to research, writing and publishing:"
