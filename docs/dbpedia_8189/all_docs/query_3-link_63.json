        "text": "A resident doctor is a medical school graduate and doctor in training who's taking part in a graduate medical education (GME) program. Health care facilities commonly refer to resident doctors as \"residents\" and first-year residents as \"interns\".\n\nResidents work at hospitals or doctors' offices to continue their education and training in a specialized field of medicine. A resident may work like this for three to seven years, a period known as residency.Â\n\nDuring their residency, doctors provide direct care. This includes diagnosing, managing, and treating health conditions. Doctors as well as senior residents in a medical facility supervise each resident. Junior residents generally start with more supervision and less complicated tasks. Responsibilities increase as residents gain education and experience.Â\n\nSupervising doctors train residents in their desired specialty during residency. Specialties include:\n\nAnesthesiology\n\nObstetrics/gynecology\n\nPediatrics\n\nRadiology\n\nSurgery\n\nInternal Medicine\n\nSupervising doctors teach resident doctors to:Â\n\nOrder and interpret diagnostic tests\n\nGive examinations\n\nPerform medical procedures\n\nRecord medical histories\n\nIn hospitals, the majority of a resident's work and education occurs during rounds, when a group of doctors and other health care professionals goes from person to person to check their condition, treatment, and progress. Working with them helps a resident assess their health, judge how theyâre healing, and make treatment adjustments.Â\n\nResidents can also work in outpatient clinics or doctor's offices. Theyâll work directly with you during examinations and treatments. Residents in doctorsâ offices also spend time with your family and coordinate services with other members of your health care team.\n\nIn addition to working with patients and other doctors, residents also continue their education by attending formal conferences and seminars.\n\nDuring medical school, students typically get direct clinical experience, meaning they work with patients in some capacity. Clinical experience at medical school can include:\n\nRecording a medical history\n\nPerforming and interpreting examinations\n\nCommunicating with patients, families, and other health care professionals\n\nOrdering and interpreting diagnostic studies\n\nPerforming closely supervised medical or surgical procedures\n\nTo provide care during their residency, residents typically must have a license from the state or jurisdiction where they work. Junior residents may have a restricted training license. Residents must eventually obtain a full, unrestricted license to continue their training or begin their own practice.\n\nDuring residency, several principles guide how resident doctors continue their learning:\n\nResidents gradually become more responsible for care while under supervision.\n\nResidents have adequate time for reflective learning.\n\nResidents work with patients long enough to observe how illnesses and conditions evolve.\n\nDuring training, residents must work closely with their supervising doctors to gain medical knowledge and experience with patients and procedures. Supervising doctors educate residents on patient safety and provide feedback to residents for continued educational, professional, and personal development.\n\nReasons to See a Resident Doctor\n\nYou may see a resident doctor as part of your visit to a hospital or doctor's office. Residents are part of health care teams and work with patients assigned to their supervising doctor. In many cases, residents have more time than supervising doctors to talk with patients and learn about their situations.Â\n\nSupervising doctors and senior residents review a junior resident's work, meaning multiple medical professionals may be working on your case. Additionally, residents who recently graduated from medical school participate in continuing education, so their knowledge comes from the most up-to-date sources.\n\nResidents can also assist with procedures, thus providing faster care and eliminating the need for multiple office visits.Â"
