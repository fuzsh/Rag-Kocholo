And with it we bring you coverage of all the most glamorous social events of the season as well as feature items on exclusive brands; Land Rover, Wider Yachts and Johnnie Walker Blue Label.\n\nThis, the latest issue of CasaLife, year 7, volume 1 will be delivered to your Casa de Campo villa tomorrow (Thursday the 22nd of March 2012) and with it you will receive the premier issue of our latest print publication – which we are sure you are going to love! (But more about that soon!)\n\nThis past “season” in Casa de Campo I once again undertook the arduos task of covering (and enjoying only slightly) the many high-society events which took place across the resort and in this edition you will find our coverage of; a piano recital with the Hogar del Niño, the 20th anniversary of the Cartier fundraiser, the Fanjul family’s New Year’s Eve soiree, Dueños 2011 and the Placido Domingo in concert for the Fundación Sur Futuro.\n\n“A Partnership of Giants” by Rebecca Hughes\n\nOf special interest is the 6-page spread “A Partnership of Giants”, feature article and interview on the Louis Vuitton and America’s Cup regatta, which was written by myself and as such is my very first feature article! In November last year, CasaLife was honored to be one of only 4 publications from Latin America to be invited by Louis Vuitton to attend a qualifying regatta of the Louis Vuitton Cup, part of the world’s oldest sporting event – and so here we share with you that experience in an interview with Bruno Troublé founder of the Louis Vuitton Cup and hamdi Chatti, the director of Horologie at Louis Vuitton. I very much hope you enjoy it!\n\nMy first feature article!\n\nYour copy of CasaLife will be delivered to your Casa de Campo villa soon!"
