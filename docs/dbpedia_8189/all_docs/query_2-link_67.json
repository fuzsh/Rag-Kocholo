        "text": "LONDON — The expansion of 10 Magazine continues.\n\nThe magazine, which was founded by Sophia Neophitou more than 20 years ago, is launching a German edition in March 2025 and has named Toby Grimditch its editor in chief.\n\n“This fourth global edition represents the first step of a European expansion for the 10 brand,” said Neophitou in a statement.\n\n“He’s been a valuable contributor to 10 for four years and his vision and creativity have always been an inspiration to me,” she added of Grimditch. “He brings modernity and a confidence to the pages and I’m extremely excited to see 10 Deutsch come to life under his inspirational leadership.”\n\nThe launch of the German edition is a knock-on effect from the success of the other international editions of 10 Magazine. The Japanese edition will make its debut in September, edited by Saori Masuda; the U.S. edition launched last September with editor Dora Fung and the Australian edition launched in 2013 and is edited by Alison Veness.\n\nGrimditch is a London native now based in Berlin working as a stylist and creative director. He started his career in fashion at the creative talent agency Streeters as a producer before moving over to editorial work.\n\nHe’s contributed to CR Fashion Book, Garage, i-D and Interview, as well as holding positions at Dansk, Under the Influence and Autre.\n\n“I’m honored to be part of the 10 Magazine family, and to evolve the brand alongside Sophia and her wonderful team. Not only is she a creative powerhouse and well respected within our industry, her incredible business acumen and moral compass is to be admired,” said Grimditch.\n\n“And of course, her wonderful sense of fun and adventure is a source of inspiration for us all. It’s these core values that will inform the new 10 Deutsch,” he added.\n\nGrimditch’s edition will focus on the rising generation of artists coming out of Germany in fashion, art, film and music."
