        "text": "The Hanged Man was a pub in the Muggle part of Little Hangleton, a village in England. Residents of the town flocked there to theorise and gossip with each other on the night that the entire Riddle family was murdered. Later on, the Riddles' cook arrived at the pub, and then immediately announced to everyone present that Frank Bryce had been arrested. The landlord of the pub announced that he thought the war had turned Bryce \"funny\", perhaps indicating his belief in the gardener's guilt.[1]\n\nEtymology[]\n\nThe Hanged Man is a tarot card, also known as \"the Traitor\", which depicts a man hanging upside-down by one foot from a wooden beam or a tree. It is generally considered to have profound but ambiguous significance, often associated with the destruction of the self, letting go of worldly attachments, and viewing things from a different perspective.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First appearance)\n\nNotes and references[]"
