        "text": "Not long into the haunting, haunted, beautifully shot “In the Fog,” a film about fate and free will, a wrongly accused man meets his executioners. The condemned, Sushenya, insists that he’s innocent, but fails to convince his would-be exterminators, Burov and Voitik. It’s World War II, and the men are traveling through a Russian forest: a time and a place in which good and evil appear as unambiguous as the Nazi occupiers and partisan fighters creeping through the trees. Sushenya appears resigned to his doom and even asks, with unnerving calm, if he should bring a shovel. Yet when the men stop at a proposed execution site, he also complains that the area floods. And so they move on.\n\nThere’s a touch of Samuel Beckett to this setup and a hint of the La Fontaine fable “Death and the Dying Man,” in which a 100-year-old man tells Death he needs to finish some tasks before he can die. Unlike the old man, the baleful Sushenya (Vladimir Svirski) seems scarcely to resist death’s call. He has his reasons: he has recently been freed by the Nazis, who had arrested him for sabotage with three other local men. The others were hanged, their bodies left dangling like warnings. Sushenya insists that he’s innocent, even as everyone else — to his shame, his wife included — believes that he’s a collaborator. Death, or so he believes, would bring him a kind of exoneration.\n\nHow it does and doesn’t — and how he meets one fate while avoiding another — is part of the rich, deepening satisfaction of “In the Fog.” Written and directed by Sergei Loznitsa, who was born in Belarus and grew up in Kiev, it is based on a novel by Vasil Bykov (1924-2003), a revered Belarussian author who fought in the Red Army in World War II. During his life, Bykov’s novels apparently sold millions of copies, although little of his work is available in English. (Some of his other writings have been made into films, including “Sotnikov,” the basis for “The Ascent,” from the Soviet director Larisa Shepitko.) His high repute may be suggested by one critic who said that Bykov “represents the war through the dialectics of the human soul.”"
