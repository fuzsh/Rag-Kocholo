        "text": "An American YouTube star has prompted a barrage of criticism after he posted a video which showed the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan.\n\nThe video showed Logan Paul and friends at the Aokigahara forest at the base of Mount Fuji, known to be a frequent site of suicides.\n\nGoing in to film the \"haunted\" forest, they come across a man's body and are shocked but also make jokes.\n\nOnline comments have called the video \"disrespectful\" and \"disgusting\".\n\nThe video was uploaded on Sunday and had millions of views on YouTube before it was taken down.\n\nLogan Paul, who has more than 15 million subscribers on YouTube, posted an apology on Twitter, saying he had been \"misguided by shock and awe\".\n\nHe later uploaded a video apology, and said: \"I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through.\"\n\n\"I'm ashamed of myself,\" he added. \"I'm disappointed in myself.\"\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

Signs are posted in the forest urging people to seek medical help rather than take their own lives.\n\nThe 15-minute video is part of a series of posts from Japan where the US vlogger is on a trip with friends.\n\nThey go on a visit to the forest intending to focus on the \"haunted\" aspect of it, he says in the video.\n\nAfter walking a short distance into the forest, the group come across a body.\n\nThe group is filmed approaching the body, which is shown in several close-ups where only the face is blurred out.\n\nA member of the group is heard off camera saying he \"doesn't feel good\". Paul then asks him: \"What, you never stand next to a dead guy?\" He then laughs.\n\nThe identity of the deceased man is not known.\n\n'Garbage person'\n\nBy Monday, Logan Paul's name was trending globally on Twitter. Though some people said he had helped raise awareness, the comments were overwhelmingly negative.\n\nOnline comments have accused him of acting inappropriately and being disrespectful. Some have called for his entire channel to be removed from YouTube.\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

I can be wrong.\"\n\nHe goes on to say he wanted to \"make a positive ripple on the internet, not cause a monsoon of negativity\", by raising awareness of suicide and suicide prevention.\n\nPaul says in the video that he is not making money off the content. YouTube, which pays content providers for videos that garner above a certain number of hits, did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment."
