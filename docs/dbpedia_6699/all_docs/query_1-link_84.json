        "text": "In the opening scene of the first film I saw by Rea Tajiri, a match is lit and raised to a piece of gray cloth in the dark, and the cloth goes up in flames. A woman says in voiceover, “In 1942, my grandfather burned the family’s possessions in the strawberry fields behind the house.” The film was Strawberry Fields (1997), and it was a revelation. It was the first film I saw with an entirely Japanese American cast, and it was the first film I saw about JA incarceration that centered the experience and perspective of a descendant of the concentration camps. In that scene, the past is extinguished in a desperate yet clear-sighted act, and in that instant the primary condition of the family in Strawberry Fields is one of loss. For the main character—a Sansei, like Tajiri, whose mother, Rose, was incarcerated in the Poston (Arizona) camp—what follows is a pilgrimage to the source of that loss.\n\nTajiri’s latest film, Wisdom Gone Wild, is a documentary portrait of Rose and her descent into dementia. It focuses on Rose’s final years, but it feels limiting to say that because all of Rose’s previous selves, as well as the lives of other people, are reanimated. “Rose was layering people from the past with the present,” Tajiri says in the film. “It was one of her ways of time-traveling and making it possible for all of us to meet.” This is a beautiful expression of what it means to undergo the long transformation through dementia into the afterlife. It is also a perfect definition of the films of Rea Tajiri.\n\n—Brandon Shimoda\n\nBrandon Shimoda I have seen Wisdom Gone Wild several times, and what struck me this time is the voice at the beginning: a woman calling out the name Akiko—intimately, hauntingly—three times, each time more insistently: Akiko … Akiko … Akiko! Your mother Rose’s given name was Akiko. Its invocation is profoundly intimate yet haunting. What does it mean, to you and to the portrait of Rose, to begin with what I am assuming is your grandmother’s voice, calling out a name that, to a certain extent, no longer exists?\n\nRea Tajiri The film is about aging and who we are at different stages and moments across the span of a lifetime. Dealing with a parent who has dementia, many aspects of their past, their life story, surface. Out of that, I wanted to weave this specific element into the film that would show aspects of a parent’s life and how a child might remember them across a lifetime. Throughout the making of the film, I had a lot of flashbacks. There was a particular moment when I was six and heard my grandmother call my mom by her Japanese name. We were traveling for a family reunion from Chicago—city of resettlement—to Fresno, close to where my mom was born. In that split second I sensed my mother as a child of my grandmother and felt my grandmother’s mothering energy. It was startling because it was an entry point into my heritage, hearing this name and my grandmother’s utterance. Japan, up until that point, was unimaginable. My family had no heirlooms; anything passed along was lost during incarceration. So that utterance came back to me when I was looking through archival photos of my mother’s childhood. I realized I could embody and perform my grandmother for the sake of the film, bring her presence into it. By the end of the film, I become my mother’s mother.\n\nBS There are numerous instances of you and Rose embodying each other and/or switching roles. There is the scene in which you hand the camera to Rose and she films you. And there are moments when Rose more explicitly becomes—and seems to need to become—your child, and you her mother. The dynamic transcends caretaking to become, as you have called it, “care-partnering.” What was Rose’s relationship to the making of the film—to you, to the camera? Was the process collaborative?\n\nRT A big conversation in the documentary community is about consent and in this case whether someone with dementia can give consent to be filmed. How I experienced my mother during the filming was that she understood the camera. My father was a professional photographer. Growing up, we were constantly photographed by him, so all of us had a self-consciousness about what it meant to be seen and recorded. But with dementia, Rose became less self-conscious and more deliberate about “performing” for the camera.\n\nIn the beauty shop scene—I had this beauty shop in her assisted living set-dressed and transformed to be a space that would engage her imagination—I had no idea what she would do or how she would react when I brought her into that room. To my surprise, she began to spontaneously sing “Smoke Gets In Your Eyes.” It was like being in a musical. Steve Espinola, one of the composers on the film, researched all the versions and recordings of the song and placed the original in the 1930s when Rose would have been a teen. There’s a lot of research about how people living with dementia can be activated or triggered if you play songs from their adolescence. In this instance, we didn’t play the song, but she was inspired to sing it. She serenaded us. She could have signaled to turn the camera off; there were instances where she would request this. But she was making deliberate choices to perform and be filmed. I think she enjoyed the attention.\n\nBS For that scene, you covered the beauty shop in Rose’s assisted living facility with plants, flowers, forest wallpaper, beauty supplies, and family photographs. Rose is dressed in green. Facing a mirror, she closes her eyes and begins to sing. It feels like she is transitioning through the final realization of herself while returning to something essential. Where did the idea come from to create this dreamlike space?\n\nRT The idea came from a few sources. I had a dream about a group of Nisei elder women gathered in a backyard around beauty shop stations, led by a beautician ringleader who was orchestrating them. The dream sprung from Rose; she was a beautician and loved gardening pre-dementia.\n\nThere were many moments off camera when Rose would do, or say, or perform things; but I couldn’t just say, “Do that again!” I thought that if I created a specific set piece it could spark her imagination to run freely, allow her mind to open up. Around this time, we ran into two old friends, Dave Wasco and Sandy Reynolds-Wasco, who were doing production design for big-budget Hollywood films—including Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Inglourious Basterds, and La La Land, for which they won an Academy Award for Best Production Design. We told them we were making a film. I shared my idea. Rose charmed them. And they agreed.\n\nI remember once when I came into Rose’s room the light was filtering in from the window through a tree outside. There was wind blowing stuff around, and she started reciting a poem off the top of her head. I think Mom was an artist. She would have been if she had opportunities and support.\n\nBS These layerings and ways of time-traveling—you inviting your mother into your dream, maybe your mother inviting you into her dreams too—make me wonder: What do you think your mother’s dementia revealed or permitted of her inner life that might have remained inaccessible? Did you experience aspects of her dementia, her elder consciousness, while making Wisdom Gone Wild that you did not otherwise see?\n\nRT When someone you’ve known your whole life begins to transform through dementia, it can be frightening. It is a painful and profound loss. Sometimes it feels like their neuroses and their fears are amplified too, which can be extremely frustrating. The person loses abilities that they never gave a second thought to—my mother completely forgot about gardening. She’d look at plants and flowers with complete disinterest.\n\nSo one day I thought, What if I give in to her behavior? What if I accept the reality she’s creating? What if I don’t judge it? When I let go, it was surprising what worlds she would build. And sometimes little things would slip out. A name of a place I never heard her mention, names of elementary school teachers and classmates. The ways they taunted her. It made me imagine her as a young child, or it allowed me to see what she didn’t like growing up, who she revered and looked up to.\n\nI don’t want to seem like I am romanticizing dementia, but I do want to model another way of engaging with an elder who has dementia. Aren’t we all trying to get back to our authentic selves?"
