        "text": "The Kentucky census worker found hanging from a tree with the word “fed” scrawled on his chest staged his death to look like a homicide so that his son could collect his life insurance, the authorities said Tuesday.\n\n“We believe this was an intentional act,” said Trooper Don Trosper, a Kentucky State Police spokesman. “We believe the aim was to take his own life.”\n\nThe naked body of the census worker, Bill Sparkman, was found Sept. 12 hanging from a tree near a cemetery in the Daniel Boone National Forest in southeastern Kentucky.\n\nOne of the witnesses who found the body said Mr. Sparkman, 51, was bound with duct tape, gagged and had an identification badge taped to his neck. A rope was tied around his neck, attached to a tree, and the word “fed” was on his chest, the police said.\n\nThe death attracted national attention and prompted concerns that it might be a sign of increased animosity toward the federal government in the first year of Barack Obama’s presidency.\n\nThe police said they analyzed the ink on Mr. Sparkman’s chest to determine if someone else had written the word. They concluded that the letters had been written from the bottom to the top, which is not how another person would have written them while facing Mr. Sparkman.\n\nThe police also found no evidence of a struggle, and there was only Mr. Sparkman’s DNA on the rag in his mouth and near his body.\n\nMr. Sparkman’s hands were bound, but loosely, allowing him to move them a shoulder-width apart. The police added that they believed Mr. Sparkman had acted alone in manipulating the scene to conceal the suicide."
