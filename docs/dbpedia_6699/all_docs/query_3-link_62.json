        "text": "Chicago is becoming a hotspot for television and movie filming. Last year alone, 13 shows were actively filming all around the city, including both new and long-running series. We’ve done some of the legwork and created this easy guide to some of the locations you’ll recognize from your favorite TV shows filmed in Chicago.\n\nThe Bear Chicago filming locations\n\nHulu’s smash hit The Bear is a gritty comedy series that goes behind the scenes of a local sandwich shop in Chicago (the city’s iconic Italian beef sandwich plays a starring role).\n\nIf you’re looking to try one for yourself, the family’s restaurant is actually a real place — the show was filmed at Mr. Beef On Orleans in the city’s River North neighborhood. The spot has been a Chicago staple for more than 30 years and has been featured on other TV shows like Travel Channel’s Food Wars.\n\nThe show’s second season visited Chicago hot spots like Kasama, Ever, Margie’s Candies, and avec. Check out all the Chicago spots from season two of The Bear.\n\nLove is Blind filming locations\n\nIt’s hard not to fall in love with Chicago while watching the second season of Love is Blind. The hit Netflix dating show included date nights, group gatherings, and (of course) weddings, all over Chicago. Here are just a few spots featured in the show.\n\nJarrette and Iyanna’s date night: This thrill-seeking couple spent one of their first date nights outside the pods at 360 CHICAGO, an observation deck on the 94th floor of one of Chicago’s most iconic buildings. Viewers got to watch the couple try TILT, an adrenaline-pumping ride that literally tilts visitors out more than 1,000 feet above Michigan Avenue.\n\nShaina and Kyle’s break-up: Shaina and Kyle had their final conversation while walking on the Chicago Riverwalk. Specifically, they were standing across from Wolf Point, where the three branches of the Chicago River meet. You’ll find a large grassy area with impressive views of the surrounding architecture. Continue strolling the 1.25-mile pedestrian walkway for more stunning vistas, plus riverfront cafes, public art, and more.\n\nBachelor and bachelorette parties: The guys hopped on a party bus that brought them to Wrigley Field for some batting practice at one of the oldest ballparks in the country. The ladies spent their Chicago bachelorette party with an evening aboard an Island Party Boat. These tiki-themed vessels offer public and private charters, including cruises of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan.\n\nThe group picnic: While the group party was full of drama, it was also filled with stunning views of the city skyline and sparkling lakefront. The scenic gathering took place on North Avenue beach, just one of Chicago’s 26 sandy beaches. In the summer, it’s a popular spot for beach volleyball, waterfront cocktails, swimming, and relaxing in the sand.\n\nSal and Mallory’s date: Sal serenades Mallory with his now-iconic ukelele at the historic Humboldt Park Boat House. The picturesque structure overlooks the lagoon, which meanders throughout Humboldt Park. The sprawling park is also home to tennis courts, a museum of Puerto Rican art, and vintage swan boats available to rent in the warmer months.\n\nThe weddings: The couples said “I do” (and “I don’t”) at Ravisloe Country Club in Homewood, just south of Chicago. The lush venue offers a picture-perfect backdrop for weddings, from their ivy-covered courtyard to the elegant reception space.\n\nShameless filming locations\n\nThe series is mainly set in the Back of the Yards neighborhood, including a small area called Canaryville. That particular spot is historically known for its large Irish-American population, so the Gallaghers fit right in.\n\nGallagher house: Fans of the show will instantly recognize the house at 2119 S. Homan Ave. as the primary residence of the Gallagher clan. It’s an iconic piece of the show, so we don’t blame you for wanting to see it for yourself. But the house is currently lived in by a real-life family, so just make sure to stay on the sidewalk.\n\nJust like in the show, the house where Kevin and Veronica live is located right down the street from the Gallagher’s house at 2113 S. Homan Ave.\n\nPatsy’s Pies: Patsy’s Pies, which becomes a fixture in later seasons as the diner owned by Fiona, is nowhere near the South Side. Those scenes were filmed at the Golden House Restaurant & Pancake House in the Uptown neighborhood at 4744 N. Broadway St., right next to the Riviera Theatre. The old-school, cash-only spot is beloved for their classic diner food.\n\nFiona’s apartment building: The apartment building that took Fiona from zero to hero to zero to hero? That’s 3310 W. 19th St. in the Lawndale neighborhood. There’s no mistaking it — to look at it, you might think you’d see one of Fiona’s feisty tenants or Ford hanging out.\n\n#OneChicago filming locations\n\nMany shows are set in Chicago, but Dick Wolf’s #OneChicago shows on NBC are filmed entirely in the city. Because they shoot exclusively in Chicago, the variety and number of locations is remarkable. Fans who want to get a real-life look at some memorable places from the shows should put the following spots on their Chicago itinerary:\n\nChicago Fire filming locations\n\nMolly’s Pub: The preferred hang-out of the Firehouse 51 crew is a real bar in Chicago’s Bucktown neighborhood. Molly’s has been a fixture on the series since season one, and those scenes were originally shot inside Lottie’s Pub at 1924 W. Cortland St. The show now uses replica of the bar’s interior for filming, but Firefans are still in luck. Walking into the bar feels like walking on set — you can even buy a “Molly’s by Day, Lottie’s by Night” t-shirt or order the Chicago Fire burger.\n\nChicago Fire Academy: The Chicago Fire Academy, which makes many appearances in the show, is a striking modern building located at 558 W. De Koven Street. Ironically, it’s located in the exact spot where Great Chicago Fire began in 1871. You can roam around the ground floor and check out the fascinating history there, like a plaque marking the fire’s starting point and vintage firefighting gear.\n\nFirehouse 51: The Chicago Fire Department Engine 18 is a working firehouse that doubles as Firehouse 51 in Chicago Fire. While most interior scenes are filmed on a set, all the exterior shots are filmed at the station at 1360 S. Blue Island Avenue. It’s a must-see for fans of the show — you might even catch some of the stars in action!\n\nChicago PD filming locations\n\nDistrict 21 Police Station:Chicago PD is often filmed in the Pilsen neighborhood around 18th Street. Chicago PD’s District 21 is filmed at the UIC Police Headquarters at 943 W. Maxwell St. It’s a real working police station, so don’t anticipate strolling in for a tour, but the exterior is always good for a selfie. It’s also right around the corner from the Chicago Fire firehouse.\n\nWhite Palace Grill & other restaurants: The characters often find themselves on Canal Street at the White Palace Grill (1159 S. Canal St.). But the squad hits up local bars and restaurants all over the city:\n\nLottie’s Pub: 1924 W. Cortland St.\n\nMaria’s Packaged Goods And Community Bar: 960 W. 31st St.\n\nThe Village Inn: 4035 S. Wallace St.\n\nLou Mitchell’s: 565 W. Jackson Blvd.\n\nBoni Vino Pizza: 111 W. Van Buren St.\n\nOriginal Ferrara Bakery: 2210 W. Taylor St.\n\nBridgeport Restaurant: 3500 S. Halsted St.\n\nChicago Med filming locations\n\nGaffney Medical Center: When you see your favorite characters clearing their heads on the roof? It’s part of the Rush University Medical Center, which is the home base for the show. The hospital, which stands in for the Gaffney Medical Center on the show, is located at 1653 W. Congress Parkway.\n\nGraceland Cemetery: In a graveside ceremony, the characters found themselves in Graceland Cemetery at 4001 N. Clark St. It’s worth the trip to the city’s north side – the graveyard is host to the resting places of so many interesting people. Architects, public figures, baseball and boxing greats, and famous inventors are among some of the noteworthy names buried here."
