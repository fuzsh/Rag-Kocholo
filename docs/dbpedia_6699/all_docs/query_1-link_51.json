        "text": "WEST MILFORD – Clinton Road is not haunted. There are no roving bands of witches, albinos or deranged murderers in the dense woods alongside the long, desolate stretch, nor is there a yeti.\n\nThose tall tales may make for an interesting movie, however. Starting June 14, movie goers in nine cities can find out for themselves.\n\n\"Clinton Road,\" a new movie directed by Steve Stanulis and Richard Grieco and starring Ice-T and Vincent Pastore, focuses on a widowed firefighter whose wife went missing on a haunted road. Unlike the motorists and cyclists who frequent the winding road, this fictional firefighter must unlock Clinton Road’s secret \"if he wants to get out alive,\" according to the synopsis.\n\nPartially filmed on the 9-mile road in western Passaic County, \"Clinton Road\" starts screening in just nine theaters later this month. The closest theater to its namesake road is the Kent Theater in Brooklyn, New York, roughly a 50-mile drive from Clinton Road.\n\nThe road, which cuts through reservoirs, trout streams and dense forest, is well known as a local tourist attraction. It draws people from throughout the region seeking a picturesque hike in the trail-threaded forest. It also draws people curious about tales of ghosts and other oddities popularized by the internet and the publication “Weird NJ.”\n\nTales involve a ghost boy who throws back coins dropped over a small bridge, a phantom car that appears at the rear bumper of nighttime visitors with lights blaring and satanic cult that gathers at odd stone structures in the woods.\n\nMore: Stranger Jersey: Clinton Road and Dead Man's Curve\n\nEntertainment: 'Real Housewives' star Catania to appear in 'Clinton Road' film\n\nRecent: West Milford police asking public for help in Clinton Road crash that killed New York man\n\nA rarely congested stretch with few side roads, Clinton Road takes drivers from Route 23 directly to Upper Greenwood Lake through watershed land owned by the City of Newark. The land, former iron mining country, is dotted with stone relics from the Clinton Furnace and, later, Cross Castle.\n\nThe castle, a private home built in about 1905 and abandoned when Newark bought the property in 1919, stood crumbling and graffiti covered until watershed officials decided to knock it down in 1988.\n\nTales of maniacs and murder on Clinton Road also abound. There is a story about a boy and a girl who ran out of gas on Clinton Road. The next morning, the boy was found dead hanging from a tree, the story goes.\n\nThe only true story, however, is the tale of the “Iceman.” Better known as Richard Kuklinski of Dumont, the Iceman was a serial and contract killer who would freeze his victims to confuse authorities. In May 1983, one of Kuklinski’s partially-frozen victims – a former associate in crime from Vernon named Daniel Deppner – was found by a cyclist off Clinton Road.\n\nThree years after the body was found, Kuklinski was arrested on five counts of murder. He died in jail 20 years later aged 70.\n\n\"Clinton Road\" is produced by Noel Ashman and Steve Stanulis. The movie, also due to be released on premium video on demand on June 14, features James DeBello (Detroit Rock City), Ace Young (\"Bones\"), Katie Morrison (\"The Blacklist\"), Bo Dietl (\"Vinyl\") and Oscar nominee Eric Roberts."
