        "text": "The year is 1916. Apostol Bologa (the outstanding Victor Rebengiuc), a Romanian officer in the Austro-Hungarian army, attends the execution of a deserter. Although he is convinced of the man’s guilt, the event leads him to begin to question the war of which he is now a part. His sense of military duty must contend with his deeply ingrained sense of humanity.... This brilliant, multilayered antiwar drama about a man’s transformation as a consequence of war received the Best Director Award at the 1965 festival in Cannes. The film, which has lost none of its currency or urgency almost 50 years later, was based on the eponymous work by the founder of the modern Romanian novel, Liviu Rebreanu. Director Liviu Ciulei described the film’s final scene as the most beautiful of his entire film career: \"…man, woman, bread, salt and wine, love, life and death.”\n\nLiviu Ciulei (1923, Bucharest – 2011, Munich) studied drama and stage architecture at the Royal Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, after which he worked exclusively in theatre as a stage designer, costumer designer, director and actor. He also began to appear as an actor in films. Ciulei co-wrote the screenplay for Fulfilled Dream (Mitrea Cocor), awarded at KVIFF in 1952. Ciulei began directing independently in the late 1950s. His other feature films include Eruption (Erupţia, 1957), The Waves of the Danube (Valurile Dunării, 1959) and television adaptations of the plays Macbeth (Macbett, 1973) and A Lost Letter (O scrisoare pierdută, 1977). He left Romania in the early 1980s, and worked in the USA, Canada and Australia. He returned after the 1989 revolution, and continued his work in theater."
