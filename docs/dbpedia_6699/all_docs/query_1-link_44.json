        "text": "Prague is a beautiful city with quaint cobbled streets and amazing architecture. You’ve probably seen many Prague scenes in movies because it’s a very popular shooting location for filmmakers worldwide.\n\nGrand cathedrals, old fountains and buildings from the Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque eras have been featured in Hollywood blockbusters over the years.\n\nThe capital of the Czech Republic is always ready for its close-up (or its wide shot). Production costs are low in Prague and the architecture looks like many other European cities.\n\nFor that reason, if a movie has many scenes around Europe, many can be shot in Prague, saving valuable time and money.\n\nAll your favorite actors like Tom Cruise, Daniel Craig, Kit Harington, and Natalie Portman could be in town during filming, so Prague locals have become used to seeing A-list celebrities and movie stars hanging out in their neighborhoods.\n\nOther times they sneak around in character or disguise and go largely unrecognized. So you never know who you might see walking along Charles Bridge!\n\nPrague’s unique appeal as a film location isn’t just about its architecture or the savings on production costs. The city’s film infrastructure is top-notch, with experienced local crews and advanced post-production facilities.\n\nBarrandov Studios, one of the largest and oldest film studios in Europe, is located in Prague and has been a central hub for numerous international film productions.\n\nThis makes Prague a top choice for filmmakers looking to capture the essence of Europe in their movies.\n\nMovies Shot In Prague\n\nMission: Impossible\n\nMission: Impossible (1996), directed by Brian De Palma and starring Tom Cruise, was shot mainly in Prague and London, but also some scenes were shot in Scotland and America.\n\nPrague featured strongly in the 1996 hit movie with scenes including Liechtenstein Palace on Kampa Island, Wenceslas Square, Na Kampe and Karluv Most (Charles Bridge).\n\nNarodni Museum was also in the film and later many more movies, including Casino Royale. It was renovated from 2011 to 2019, with revenue from the movies helping towards the massive costs.\n\nFun fact: Cruise is well-known for doing all his own stunts, so it actually was him doing the dangerous action stunts.\n\nSpiderman: Far From Home\n\nEven Spiderman made an appearance in Prague’s streets during the making of Spiderman: Far From Home. This movie was shot in many cities around the globe, and Prague was chosen for its blend of Baroque, eastern-European architecture that perfectly fits the movie.\n\nSpiderman moves fast and filming was finished within two weeks. It was one of the more costly films shot in the country, with about $US11 million spent.\n\nLooking at these figures, you can see why this industry is so important to the economy.\n\nAmerica, Italy, England and Spain were also featured in the blockbuster movie.\n\nThe Illusionist (2006)\n\nAlthough set in Austria, this film directed by Neil Burger was filmed mostly in the Czech Republic.\n\nThis film was a great showcase of how Prague and the rest of the Czech Republic can cover all the locations needed to shoot such a demanding film.\n\nThe city of Vienna is represented in the film by Tábor and Prague, while the scenes set in the main character’s childhood village were shot in Český Krumlov.\n\nThe Crown Prince’s castle is actually the fortress of Konopiště, formerly the home of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.\n\nThe front gates of Leopold’s Vienna Palace (the Hofburg) were actually the front gates of Prague Castle.\n\nAll other shots were at Barrandov Studios in Prague.\n\nWhile we’ll cover some of the films that later bombed at the box office this one was an example of a film that played it modestly and ended up having great success with the audience.\n\nWith a limited theatrical release, it earned almost $90 million against its $20 million budget and an additional $30 million in DVD sales.\n\nIt also propelled Neil Burger’s career, who later entered Hollywood with blockbusters such as Limitless, Divergent, and The Upside.\n\nLes Miserables\n\nThe original Les Miserables was a video production in Prague with Liam Neeson, Claire Danes, Geoffrey Rush and Uma Thurman as the main stars.\n\nHradčany Square was made to look like the heart of Paris, and the square has featured in many other well-known movies, including The Illusionist and The Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was shot mainly in New Zealand, with the last few months shot in Prague. A few years later, the Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian was shot in Prague.\n\nThe set of Miraz’s Castle was created to scale and built during winter with temperatures in the negatives. It is a reminder of the attention to detail, behind the scenes work and dedication the film industry has to presenting authentic-looking movies for viewers.\n\nThe Bourne Identity\n\nThe Bourne Identity (2002) is an action thriller starring Matt Damon as the lead. A number of big names were cast before Damon, who did many of his own stunts on the movie.\n\nLocations were an issue with many changes during production. Prague was used for a large percentage of the movie scenes.\n\nAs well the film was plagued with internal politics, going over budget and having many scenes re-written, but in the end, it was a huge box office success.\n\nCasino Royale\n\nCasino Royale (2006) put Prague in the spotlight. The spy film starred Daniel Craig as James Bond, a controversial casting.\n\nWith a license to kill, he made a great agent 007 as he went on assignment to take on a terrorist in a tense poker game at the Casino Royale.\n\nDanube House in the middle of Prague was used as Dryden’s office in the pre-title sequence where Bond has to eliminate several men to gain 00-rank. The Ministry of Transport nearby was also featured in the movie.\n\nSnowpiercer\n\nSnowpiercer was shot at Barrandov Studios in Prague. This time the location wasn’t chosen because of its surroundings but because of the studio expertise and space.\n\nThe producer Bong Joon-ho wanted to shoot it in his country of South Korea, but there wasn’t a suitable studio that needed to fit the set that included a 100-meter train replica.\n\nThe budget was $US42 million, the largest in history for a film with Korean investors.\n\nMany movies that didn’t get so much recognition were made in Prague, like the drama action movie The Last Knights starring Clive Owen and Morgan Freeman, which came out in 2015.\n\nAnother example is Child 44, featuring Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman, which was filmed in Prague and other locations around the country and released in 2015.\n\nThis mystery thriller included scenes in the Prague metro and it was the first time it was ever closed to the public.\n\nAs well as movies, there are always many movie series being shot in Prague at the various big studios in the capital city. TV commercials and music videos are also produced in the capital of Prague.\n\nMore Movies Shot In Prague\n\nIf you get addicted to spotting Prague in movies, here are some more to watch. If you haven’t heard of them before, don’t underestimate them. Just because they didn’t make it to the Oscar list doesn’t mean they aren’t winners.\n\nOliver Twist (2005)\n\nA Sound of Thunder (2005)\n\nChasing Liberty (2004)\n\nEuroTrip (2004)\n\nThe Prince and Me (2004)\n\nUnderworld (2003)\n\nBangkok Dangerous (2008)\n\nFilm Making In The Time Of Covid\n\nWhile the pandemic put the brakes on movie production in Prague and many other parts of the world, crews are ready to roll for 2022 and 2023. Here is the latest movie news starting with something scary for vampire film lovers.\n\nNosferatu (2024)\n\nThe classic German film, Nosferatu, was scheduled to be remade in honor of its 100th anniversary (the Murnau’s original was filmed in 1922).\n\nThe production took advantage of shooting in the Czech Republic and registered with the Czech Film Fund in 2021. The film fund offers production incentives to movie companies and has been successful in drawing big box office hits, TV shows, and medium-small budget filmmakers too.\n\nAfter the delay, this blood-thirsty movie was primarily filmed in Prague under director Robert Eggers in 2023, after being stalled due to the COVID pandemic and starring famous Willem Dafoe.\n\nIts premier is scheduled for December 2024 and by many horror fans, this is one of the most anticipated movie of 2024.\n\nWith our skilled local crews, including professional stuntmen, assistants, and operators, low production costs, and stunning European-style architecture, Prague will always be a top pick for filmmakers when government support is as strong as it has been in the past.\n\nFoundation (2021 – )\n\nAnother sci-fi found its way to Prague’s filming locations when producers decided to use it for the basis of the sci-fi series based on Isaac Asimov’s story.\n\nA complex saga about humans scattered on planets throughout the galaxy, all living under the rule of the Galactic Empire, saw its first season filmed in Ireland, Malta, and the Canary Islands.\n\nSince then, production has faced several challenges. The second season was primarily shot in Prague in April 2022. that also served as the primary location for season 3. Than, the production was halted in July 2023 due to the Hollywood labor disputes and in February due to budgetary issues, but continued in March.\n\nDespite a rocky start and some complaints about the complex story, a fourth season is planned to the delight of all fans, who praise the show for improving from one season to another.\n\nWe like to think that the sudden jump in storytelling in the second season is inevitably connected with moving production to Prague.\n\nThe Gray Man (2022)\n\nOriginally in development from 2011 this highly anticipated film was finally scheduled for production in 2021.\n\nShot in Prague at the end of June 2021, The Gray Man was at the time the most expensive Netflix film ever made. With a $200 million budget and starring Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, Ana De Armas and Dhanush, it is non-stop action with assassins, CIA agents, stunts, high-speed chases and perhaps a dash of romance.\n\nYou can see Prague’s city center and Smichov, Zizkov, Karlin and some locations outside of Prague. Much of the film was shot in LA and Thailand.It had a limited theatrical release in July 2022, but it was the most-watched Netflix film in 84 countries.\n\nWith the experienced Russo brothers at the helm (Captain America, 2014, Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War, 2018, and Avengers: Endgame, 2019), the plans for the sequel and spin-offs have already been made.\n\nWe’re sure Pragu will be considered at large for future filming locations.\n\nThe Wheel Of Time (2021 – )\n\nJudging from some projects, even COVID couldn’t hurt Prague’s appeal to filmmakers. The Wheel Of Time is a fantasy series on Amazon Prime that was shot all over the Czech Republic, including the capital of Prague, on location and in the studio. It has been several years in the making and is often compared to the famous Game of Thrones series.\n\nWith Prague being the primary filming location, production was delayed due to the pandemic but successfully continued with plans to shoot eight seasons in total. Fans of the fantasy world created by writer Robert Jordan are currently waiting for their 4th season.\n\nRosamund Pike plays a lead role as a sorceress and producer with a cast including Daniel Henney, Josha Stradowski, Zoe Robins and Madeleine Madden. It’s a suspenseful, dramatic show that will keep you wanting more.\n\nPike lived in Prague for several years with her husband and two children during filming, including the pandemic.\n\nShe found a music teacher and took up the cello after a 17-year break and enjoyed Czech culture, nature and life. Locals loved seeing the celebrity and her family in the city living their best life.\n\nExtraction 2 (2023)\n\nRemember the Russo brothers behind The Grey Man?\n\nAfter the successful action flick Extraction they decided to choose Prague as one of the filming locations for the sequel.\n\nIt is reported that the brothers favored the Czech location after their positive experience filming The Gray Man, while Hemsworth made it known he preferred the Down Under location where he’s from. However, circumstances worked in favor of Prague.\n\nExtraction 2 was shot in the Czech Republic and Vienna after being moved from Australia due to the pandemic. The sequel was much awaited since the first movie was one of Netflix’s most viewed movies.\n\nChris Hemsworth plays the lead role of Tyler Rake under the direction of Sam Hargrave with the screenplay by Anthony and Joe Russo.\n\nFun trivia: this sequel is one of the rare action films that got better user reviews than the original film.\n\nAction film fans who missed this one got their recommendation.\n\nCello (2023)\n\nThis English and Arabic-language horror with actors Jeremy Irons and Tobin Bell in lead roles was completed in October 2021 after more than 100 days of filming in Prague, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Vienna, and Iceland.\n\nFilming was over before the public knew the movie was being made, with many calling it a secret movie. Information was dripped out to the world via social media and reports from locals who spotted some of the star actors. The intriguing tagline from director Darren Lynn Bousman described the movie as a tale about a budding musician who discovers his instrument comes with a price higher than he imagined.\n\nDespite secrecy and intriguing plot Cello bombed at the box office.\n\nThe Brothers Bloom (2023)\n\nThis heist comedy-drama, directed by Rian Johnson, features an ensemble cast that includes Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo, and Rachel Weisz.\n\nThe Brothers Bloom was filmed in various locations, including Prague, where the city’s settings enhanced the film’s whimsical narrative.\n\nThe story follows two con artist brothers who plan one last elaborate scheme, and Prague’s vibrant streets and stunning architecture serve as the backdrop for their misadventures.\n\nWe are big fans of heist films and found this one well-executed. We are sorry that it only earned $5 mil against its well-spent $20 mil budget.\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)\n\nThe confirmation that Hollywood loves shooting in Prague came with the 7th installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise, Dead Reckoning Part One, which sees Tom Cruise reprising his role as Ethan Hunt, 30 years after the first film where Karluv Most (Charles Bridge) represented part of the Moscow.\n\nFilming took place in various locations in Prague, where the architecture and streets provided the perfect backdrop for high-stakes action sequences. The film features several thrilling chase scenes and stunts that utilize the city’s unique landscape, making it a visual feast for fans of the series.\n\nThis is one of our favorite films in the franchise. Its narration and action are perfect, and we can’t recommend it enough.\n\nIf you, just like us wondered if the Aquarium restaurant was real, we’ll have to disappoint you – it was built for the film on a London studio set.\n\nThat shouldn’t stop you from following Tom Cruise and taking the train from Vienna or Berlin to Prague where many of the action scenes were filmed.\n\nWhy Prague Is So Popular For Movie Makers\n\nPrague is the location for so many films, even if they are set in other countries.\n\nFilmmakers and directors flock to Prague because of low production costs, skilled local crews, architecture that looks similar to many places in Europe, and a supportive government.\n\nThe Czech government runs a Film Industry Support Programme that a 20% rebate towards certain production costs to international production companies shooting in the country.\n\nThey are accommodating for logistics, including film permits and visas for the film crew and production team.\n\nPrague has architecture covering many eras, so it is a very versatile location for films set in Prague or other European locations. Not far from Prague, there are stunning natural backdrops with mountains, forest, wide-open green spaces and parks, and unique landscapes that can look like other worlds.\n\nThe whole country is full of useful locations and Prague makes a great base.\n\nSome History About Prague Film Making\n\nSince the fall of communism in 1992, the Czech Republic (formerly Czechoslovakia) has been popular for movie makers. Prague is the gem in the collection of sites the country offers.\n\nHollywood discovered Prague first, then other countries picked Prague for their film locations more often. Soon Prague was known internationally as a great place to shoot movies.\n\nThere was a short time other European countries, including Romania, took over because they were cheaper, but the Czech Republic government put tax breaks and other incentives in place to tempt the movie industry back and soon Prague was back in favor.\n\nThese days, every movie imaginable genre is shot in Prague, from horrors to action movies and even comedies.\n\nPros And Cons Of Prague Being A Movie Hot Spot\n\nThere are many benefits for Prague and the whole Czech Republic of having so many films shot in Prague. Jobs are created, and money flows through the economy on a mass scale every time a camera crew in Prague is needed.\n\nInternational crews bring their own people but always use support on the ground as well. Work on a movie begins weeks or months before the actors arrive to shoot the first scene and continue well after they leave too.\n\nIf you live in Prague, you probably know someone who has worked on a movie in some form in security, hospitality, catering, make-up, translation or transportation.\n\nThe jobs a movie creates goes far and wide, benefiting many people and industries.\n\nIt also boosts tourism as many people love to see the places they saw in their favorite movies. This influx of travelers supports the economy and most will stay for at least a week.\n\nSome of the money they spend is directly related to the movie industry. For example, if you are a movie buff visiting Prague, you can book a tour and follow the footsteps and gunshots and other excitement.\n\nThen, of course, tourists spend a lot on accommodation, travel, shopping and food and drink.\n\nThe Karlovy Vary International Film Festival brings in big names like Leonardo DiCaprio and John Travolta as well as movie industry professionals, press and fans from around the globe. The annual festival is one of the oldest film festivals in the world. It’s not in Prague, but a lot of traffic goes through the capital during the festival week.\n\nBut not everyone loves Prague being a hot spot for the movie industry. Some worry about the impact it can have on the environment, and others complain when major landmarks and areas are closed down.\n\nOn busy days shooting can cause traffic delays and high-security checks. Paparazzi also arrive in packs when a big movie is being filmed.\n\nCan You See A Celebrity In Prague?\n\nThe answer is yes.\n\nMovies take many months or even years to shoot. Sometimes actors and actresses settle down in a place and make it a temporary home.\n\nThey try to blend into daily life and live normally, and since so many movies are shot in Prague, it is possible. Locals get used to seeing the rich and famous out and about.\n\nHowever, the tourists are the ones who will be bombarding the stars with requests for selfies and signatures.\n\nStunt doubles are also in town at the same time. You wouldn’t be the first person disappointed to realize they weren’t about to meet their big-screen idol, but just the stunt double.\n\nHow The Locals Feel About Prague Being In The Movies\n\nMany locals are proud of Prague being the backdrop in many epic movies. The older generation will tell stories about the movies shot in the 80s and early 90s, like Amadeus and Kafka.\n\nYoung guns will get excited about the time Blade II, The Bourne Identity and Underworld: Blood Wars, was in town. Everyone has their favorite actor or actress who they once saw in real life then on the big screen. Or the one they dream of meeting one day.\n\nStories circulate about incidents and high-profile celebrity behavior. We never know if it’s myth or truth, but it adds another layer to Prague culture, having the movie industry around so much.\n\nCatch A Movie In Prague\n\nWhile it’s fun to stay cozy at home watching Netflix or a DVD, nothing beats going to the cinema with a ticket and popcorn in hand. Prague has a fine collection of movie theaters, with most having a cafe or bar attached so you can meet up for a drink with friends before the movie or critique it together afterward over a few drinks.\n\nPrague has independent arthouse cinemas and many multiplexes that often have the big blockbusters as soon as they are released. Prague even has a classic drive-in cinema that was perfect for movie-goers who wanted to go out during the pandemic.\n\nIt is outside Strahov Stadium, and even if you don’t have a car, you can take a seat on outdoor sofas that are available during the summer. Autokino Strahov is so popular we hear it will stay open long after the pandemic is over.\n\nSpecial mention has to go to Kino Lucerna, which is one of the oldest cinemas in the world in operation. Since 1909 audiences have been watching all genres of movies, from action to love stories to thrillers.\n\nAntique decor and an old-world atmosphere make it a must for movie lovers who appreciate history.\n\nSince Prague is a movie-making destination, it makes sense there are so many cinemas to choose from. Here are some of our favorites.\n\nBio Oko\n\nKino Aero\n\nEdison Filmhub\n\nKino Ponrepo\n\nKino Pilotu\n\nThe Future of Filming in Prague\n\nThe city’s combination of architecture, skilled local crews, and attractive financial incentives keeps it at the forefront of the global film industry.\n\nOne of the most significant ongoing productions in Prague is Amazon Prime’s hit fantasy series, “The Wheel of Time.”\n\nFrom many points of view, this series proved that Prague could handle big productions in the long run.\n\nWhen the show’s creators started searching for filming locations five years ago, they encountered the common problem of booked studios in popular cities like Atlanta and London.\n\nThe Czech Republic, however, offered a solution with its rich cinematic history, a competitive 20% cash rebate, and highly skilled local talent.\n\nDespite Prague’s soundstages being fully occupied, the production team made a bold move by constructing their own studio.\n\nThe new facility, equipped with state-of-the-art soundstages, production offices, VFX studios, and water tank allowed them to create the show’s sets right in the heart of the Czech Republic.\n\nDespite a temporary slowdown in early 2024, caused in part by Hollywood strikes and the subsequent delay of many productions, Prague’s film industry remains resilient.\n\nDavid Minkowski of Stillking Films, which just completed Season 3 of “The Wheel of Time,” sees the slowdown as a temporary thing. He emphasizes that Prague will continue to attract top-tier productions long-term, thanks to its unmatched filming location.\n\nThe Czech Republic’s film industry briefly halted in 2023 when its incentive program was temporarily closed to new applications due to high demand. This led to a rewrite of the country’s film law, which is now awaiting parliamentary approval.\n\nThe new law aims to meet the current needs of the audiovisual industry, with one key provision being the increase of the rebate cap to nearly $15 million per project. This move is expected to draw even larger-budget productions to the country, strengthening Prague’s position as a top filming destination.\n\nWhile the Czech Republic’s 20% rebate program remains competitive, there are calls for it to be bolstered further to match the more generous incentives offered by neighboring countries like Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia.\n\nAs the year progresses, the second half of 2024 promises to be much busier, with postponed projects set to resume.\n\nWhat Movie Will Be Shot In Prague Next?\n\nWe keep our ears to the ground to hear the next big movie that might be arriving in town. Sometimes it’s a rumor, sometimes it comes true.\n\nIn addition to “The Wheel of Time,” several other high-profile productions have chosen Prague as their primary filming location. These include Prime Video’s limited series “Blade Runner 2099,” the “John Wick” spinoff “Ballerina,” starring Keanu Reeves and Ana de Armas, and Apple TV+’s sci-fi series “Foundation,” which we mentioned is now entering production for its fourth season, with filming taking place in both Poland and Prague.\n\nGiven Prague’s global popularity, it’s no surprise that filmmakers from Hollywood, Bollywood, and beyond are consistently drawn to the city.\n\nWhether it’s a blockbuster action movie or an indie film, Prague continues to be a go-to location for filmmakers looking to capture its unique charm and versatility on screen.\n\nDid you see Brad Pitt at Cafe Slavia?\n\nIt sure did look like George Clooney wandering in the old town square, but perhaps it was a lookalike. You never know who you might spot in Prague. It makes your day a little more exciting when you catch a glimpse of Angelina Jolie, even if a security team surrounds her.\n\nYou never know, you might even get the amazing opportunity to strike up a conversation. Would you know what to say if you came face-to-face with your favorite movie star?\n\nPrague is really established as a great place to shoot a movie. With strong government support, Prague is the place movie makers always consider when they are shooting their next big movie.\n\nKeep an eye out for Prague every time you watch a movie, and you will start to recognize the beautiful backgrounds and stunning scenes our beautiful capital is so famous for."
