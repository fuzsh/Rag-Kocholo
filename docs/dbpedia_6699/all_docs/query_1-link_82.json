        "text": "The Blair Witch Project, American horror film, released in 1999, that popularized “found footage”—a cinematic technique in which some or all of a narrative film’s shots are presented as if they were recordings of nonfiction events. The film was written and directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez, who used an authentic-looking website, an online message board, and other innovative strategies to convince audiences that The Blair Witch Project was a documentary about real people rather than a fictional film. Using footage shot by the actors, The Blair Witch Project tells the story of three student filmmakers who vanish in the woods of Maryland while investigating and shooting a documentary on local folklore. Produced on a shoestring budget, the film grossed approximately $249 million worldwide at the box office, making it one of the most financially successful independent films in history.\n\nThe Blair Witch Project follows student filmmakers Heather, Michael, and Joshua as they interview residents of Burkittsville, Maryland, about the legend of the Blair Witch and then head into the nearby woods of Seneca Creek State Park to search for the witch’s house. (In the film, Burkittsville was formerly known as Blair, and the nearby woods are called the Black Hills Forest.) Soon, however, they lose their map and begin arguing among themselves. They find strange piles of rocks and effigies made of sticks hanging in the trees, and at night they hear unnerving sounds in the darkness. The students run out of food and become increasingly disoriented and desperate. They suspect that something evil is keeping them from finding their way out of the woods. One of the most iconic moments of the film shows a close-up of Heather’s face as she sobs and rambles in terror while listening to the frightening sounds outside her tent at night: “I’m scared to close my eyes, and I’m scared to open them. We’re going to die out here.” When the students enter an eerie dilapidated house one night, the film comes to a nerve-shredding close, with a notoriously chilling final shot.\n\nThe legend of the Blair Witch was invented by Myrick and Sánchez. The two wrote a bare-bones screenplay with little dialogue and hired three unknown actors—Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard—to play the student filmmakers, using their own names as the names of their characters. Myrick and Sánchez taught the actors how to operate a 16-mm camera and an 8-mm camcorder and told them to record everything they did during the eight-day shoot. The resulting shaky, amateurish footage contributes to the authentic feel of the “documentary.” The actors camped in the woods at night and used GPS devices to find sites containing food, fresh batteries for their cameras, and instructions on where they should go and what scenes they should improvise. At night the production team would wake the actors by making terrifying noises and shaking their tents. Under these conditions the actors became exhausted, hungry, cold, and disoriented, which lent verisimilitude to the footage.\n\nMyrick and Sánchez managed to generate public intrigue and excitement about their film with a website that presented the film’s events as factual. The website included missing posters for the three “student filmmakers,” photos of their belongings found in the woods, video and audio clips from the “found footage,” interviews with investigators, a timeline of strange events from Blair’s history, and a message board on which people could discuss the “case.” The website, which looked like an amateur had put it together, helped to convince the public that three real people had actually disappeared. Myrick and Sánchez also put together a television special entitled Curse of the Blair Witch (1999), which included parts of the movie and extra footage and also influenced public perception. The illusion of reality was strengthened when fliers declaring Heather, Michael, and Joshua to be “missing” were distributed among audience members at The Blair Witch Project’s January 1999 premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nAfter The Blair Witch Project’s success at Sundance, the American movie studio Artisan Entertainment bought the film’s distribution rights for $1.1 million. In May 1999 the film was also screened noncompetitively at the Cannes film festival, where it won the Award of the Youth (Prix de la jeunesse) for foreign film.\n\nThe Blair Witch Project received mainly favorable reviews, but its traditional horror movie sequel, Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 (2000), was disliked by critics and the public alike. A found-footage sequel, Blair Witch (2016), fared only slightly better with critics and the public."
