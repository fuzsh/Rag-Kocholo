I didn’t know about it until someone on Reddit asked why it wasn’t on my list. I dug it up a and decided to watch it. I was pleased to find yet another movie that managed to capture some subtleties of Cape Breton.\n\nSweet William (Chris Leavins) grew up as a troubled teen that struggled with obesity, self confidence and sexuality. He left home for a period of 10 years to the big city (this is a common trend in Cape Breton movies) where he found confidence and acceptance of his homosexuality. Meanwhile, things have got interesting at home during his absence. Returning during his sister’s wedding, he finds a family struggling with despair, his sister marrying his best friend and past love interest, and an illegitimate child from an encounter his mother arranged with a prostitute. He is haunted with memories he would much rather forget.The movie deals with choices between life and death, and how experience drives a person to make pivotal decisions in life.\n\nThe film starts with a very comical wedding. His sister Rosemary (Kerry Fox) is an animated, hardened woman with little manners. It is very uncoordinated and awkward in many ways, and it is filled with Cape Breton humour. Ashley MacIsaac makes a cameo appearance as the musical entertainment at the wedding and Sweet William shows up quietly in a shroud of foreboding mystery.\n\nWilliam’s mother (Seana McKenna) and father (Peter MacNeil) have a prolonged strained relationship. William suffers abuse from his impatient alcoholic father and misunderstanding from his good intentioned mother.\n\nThe movie proceeds to show both the present day Sweet William struggling with his past and the teenage Sweet William committed suicide, hanging dead from a tree in the backyard. The cast interacts with both. The adult Sweet William witnesses the toll his absence has had on his father in particular, on his tight-lipped mother and Violet (Christine Dunsworth), a younger sister with tomboy tendencies that he’s never met. The dead teenage Sweet William remains hanging from the tree as the family anguishes over their loss and personal struggles.\n\nThe scenes from the past, family dynamics make the relationships and interactions between characters play out as complex and intriguing. This film deals with some very big life challenges that, I am sure, many can relate to.\n\nThe surrealism is portrayed in a way that feels low budget and a bit disjointed. I understand what was being put forward but the execution seemed a bit scattered, if not a little tongue and cheek. At one point the Virgin Mary statue smiles and winks at you.\n\nWhere was this movie shot? To me it seems to be in the Bras d’Or Lake area but it’s not very recognizable. If people know I would be interested to hear from you.\n\nWhat did I find out about Cape Breton from watching this? Cape Breton grew up on conservative values. This is the second movie I’ve seen (first being New Waterford Girl) that plays on the importance of the Virgin Mary and staying together even if you are miserable because it is the right thing to do. People in Cape Breton seem to have a high proportion of flower names.\n\nMy recommendation: You might find this interesting. There were parts of the movie that I found were humorous,touching, and emotional. But overall it was a little too disjointed to really keep my interest.\n\nChris Bellemore is a blogger from Ontario that moved to Cape Breton Island and is logging his experiences in this strange and wonderful place.
