        "text": "Horror-film junkies might be thrilled to know that “The Forest,” a supernatural thriller starring Natalie Dormer and Taylor Kinney, hits theaters nationwide on Friday. The movie takes place in the Aokigahara Forest — a 14-square-mile wooded expanse in Japan that’s a common destination for those committing suicide — and chronicles Dormer’s search for her disappeared twin sister.\n\nSure, the movie is fictional, but world travelers — specifically, globe-trekkers who enjoy visiting super-morbid destinations — should know that the Aokigahara is a real-life destination. Located at the northwest base of Mount Fuji, it’s a spot that you can visit, deathly reputation and all.\n\nDon’t believe us? Just turn to a Google image search, where just an “aokigahara” entry yields plenty of images showing badly decomposed corpses dangling from trees. Hanging, poisoning and drug overdoses are reported to be the most common methods of suicide here. It’s said that more than 500 people have taken their lives in the Aokigahara.\n\n“I am walking through [the Aokigahara], the light rapidly fading on a midwinter afternoon, when I am stopped dead in my tracks by a bloodcurdling scream,” writes a visitor to the forest in a 2011 story for the Japan Times.\n\nThe writer later recounts his pursuit of the person who unleashed the scream and reveals what he finds: the body of a shirtless middle-aged man curled up on a bed of dead leaves, with paper documents and a briefcase scattered around. The description: “Nearer to him are items more closely related to his demise: empty packets of prescription pills, beer cans and bottles of liquor.” (Shudder.)\n\nThere’s no single reason why the Aokigahara attracts so many people looking to end their lives. Some lore offers an explanation — that the forest was historically a place where individuals left their elderly or infirm relatives to die, and it’s been haunted by their spirits. The forest is also said to have supernatural forces that call to those who are feeling depressed or distraught.\n\nAnother, more believable theory centers on a 1961 novel by Seicho Matsumoto called “Tower of Waves,” which tells the story of a couple who kill themselves in these woods. A spike of suicides here followed the book’s publication. In 2003 alone, 105 bodies were found inside.\n\nThe powers that be are trying to stem the tide. Wooden signs offering help to mentally unwell visitors dot the forest. In Japanese, it tells people to think of their families and the lives they were given, and provides a phone number for a suicide hotline. Police and volunteers also conduct searches inside — not just to recover bodies, but, more importantly, to find the living.\n\nThe Japanese government is reportedly working to change the public perception of this area’s deeply troubling history, and it appears to be working. Tourists do visit, and there are actually things to do besides avoid bodies.\n\nOne of these travelers is a woman named Louise Hung, who lives in Japan and recounted her visit in a 2015 story for xoJane.\n\n“I suddenly became aware of how quiet the forest was,” she writes of her hike. “There was no breeze, no sound of woodland creatures. Aside from the occasional crow cawing in the distance, and the muffled sound of snow falling from tree branches, Aokigahara was nearly silent.”\n\nShe, her husband and a friend also visited Aokigahara because it leads to the Narusawa Ice Cave, a stunning natural monument that was formed around the year 864 following a volcanic eruption of Mount Fuji. About 500 feet long, the temperature inside hovers around the freezing point, and is covered in ice all year long, with remarkable displays of iced rooms, columns and even pillars hanging down from the cave’s ceiling.\n\n“While not spooky, [it] was SPECTACULAR,” Hung writes of the ice cave.\n\nThere’s also the nearly 700-foot-long Fugaku Wind Cave, which back in the day served as a big refrigerator. The temperature also hovers around the freezing point here, and there are shelves that store acorns and silkworm cocoons.\n\nOf course, Mount Fuji — Japan’s highest mountain — isn’t far, and it’s indeed a sight to behold (and climb if you’re feeling sporty).\n\nThere are even places to stay nearby. Hotel Mount Fuji looks out to Lake Yamanakako and, of course, its eponymous peak. Meanwhile, the Highland Resort Hotel & Spa, which also has mountain views, adjoins the Fuji-Q Highland amusement park.\n\nThat sounds fun, right?"
