        "text": "The Puzzle of the Pythagorean Theorem\n\nand the Hypotenuse as a Way Home\n\nIt's clear from not only the 18th chapter, but the attitude of the girls as they ascend Hanging Rock, divesting themselves of shoes and stockings as they go, that Joan has made, in her story, an attempt to bring the disappeared ones into her comprehension of Australian Aboriginal dream time (or a version of it), but as a means of doing so she also utilizes classical mythology, in which metamorphosis played strongly. Ancient Christians and Jews weren't turned into deer, cows and swans in their myths, but Greek and Roman mythology has many such examples. Joan also relies on a combination of philosophy and esoteric mysticism for a kind of scientific validation, for if the vanguard of science is always \"magic\" to the uninitiated, whereas Miranda is the voice of love, Greta McCraw and Marion represent ancient philosophy or logic opening itself to the possibles availed by the dream time of the rock. Or that is my best way of putting it at the moment.\n\nThe indigenous landscape is dangerous to the non-indigenous through its conquering of the foreigners by conforming them to the landscape's spirit or destroying them.\n\nInitially, it seems peculiar that McCraw and Marion would be seduced by the magic of Hanging Rock, that their mathematical minds don't react in horror, as with Edith who is distinguished as being irrational, their very opposite. Instead, a devotion to curiosity drives them. Plus, math, numbers, figures, are a universal language and so Joan represents them as being able to enter a dialogue with the rock and dream time. But their transformation isn't without its difficulties, especially so for McCraw who becomes close to a medium for the rock, such is the extent to which she leaves behind the trappings of her self which must be inessential to her core. In the 18th chapter, by the time we see her she is already much changed and struggling her way uphill to the girls, gasping, \"Through\", as if fighting with all her strength into this new atmosphere as she leaves behind the old. Even she says, realizing how she has stripped down, that the pressure on her physical body must have been \"very severe\". The extreme effort required of her, to reach her pupils, is to be compared with Michael's in his struggle to find Miranda (instead discovering Irma), his only conscious thought as he crawled over the boulders being, \"Go on!\". He has a dream on the rock, and in his dream his legs become useless as he swims through a viscous green water that threatens to choke him. He realizes when he comes to that it is his own blood he has tasted from a new and inexplicable head wound, but he almost has no comprehension of the wound as he has had simultaneously an all-consuming realization that drives him on, he \"knows\" someone is there, and believing it is Miranda he forces himself to continue climbing, assured of a breakthrough. Immediately injuring one of his legs, it becomes as useless as in the dream, just as Greta McCraw has no use of her legs in the end which become a kind of tail as she vanishes into the ground in the 18th chapter. Even Mrs. Appleyard has a similar dream of easily cutting through the water like a fish with her late husband, using neither legs nor arms, at approximately the time of the happenings on Hanging Rock, but she is woken by the sound of a lawn mower and then checks with Sara to see if she has yet learned her poetry.\n\nChristianity and Judaism have the snake that invites one to taste of the fruit of knowledge in the garden. Australian Aboriginal myth has its own snake, the rainbow serpent. The girls had been warned by Mrs. Appleyard to beware of the dangerous snakes on Hanging Rock, and of course a snake must enter the picture as a guide. In the 18th chapter, a snake reveals to Miss McCraw, Marion and Miranda the hole into which they will disappear. There is no question about it, they must follow the snake, which Appleyard had warned them about, and that it was dangerous. Associated with water, the rainbow serpent of Australian myth may have a relationship with Miranda as she is later described as a \"rainbow\" and is also the embodiment of Venus. We may also have a connection with Marion, whose name in Hebrew means \"bitter waters\". The significance of water in association with the rainbow serpent may account for the watery dreams of Michael and Mrs. Appleyard, and, at the end of the 18th chapter, Miss McCraw's transformation into a crab-like creature, the kind that \"inhabits mud-caked billabongs\", which is the form by which she enters the hole. Again, concerning the waters, it is interesting that the three who go down the hole are known best by their names that begin with M: Miranda (despite her importance in the book she is never provided a last name), Marion Quade (who has, in a way, a mathematical last name, \"quade\" meaining \"four\"), and Greta McCraw. When McCraw appears, in the 18th chapter, she is only known as McCraw. M in the Hebrew is Mem, the letter of water, of the divine wisdom. The three Mems of Miranda, Marion and McCraw remind of Mary, Mary of Clopas and Mary Madgalene, the three women at the biblical crucifixion, all women whose names are watery. Again, there are traditionally three Marys at the tomb to whom Christ is first revealed upon the resurrection. Just as the three Marys appeared at the tomb to find the stone covering it rolled away, so too do these three enter the hole beneath the hanging rock which then descends and covers again the hole that had been revealed them. If Joan had a taste for the tarot, mem is the letter of the 23rd path, the 12th card, that of the Hanged Man, the mystic or traitor. The Judas or the one who is in the quiet repose of the reception of a great awakening. If only by their names would Edith Horton and Irma Leopold have not been candidates for the three Mems, though Irma made a close swipe with her name, coming from Emma, a Germanic name meaning \"world\". It at least had a mem in it. The letters of the name Irma are also contained in both Miranda and Marion. In Irma, Miranda and Marion we find Mari.\n\nWhen Greta McCraw turns into a crab, she still is McCraw, if Joan was thinking of \"craw\" as in a \"crayfish\", from the Frankish krebitja, similar to to the Old High German krebiz, crab. This may explain why Appleyard dreams she is a fish swimming with her husband, for Appleyard's relationship with Greta McCraw is revealed as being, if not romantic and sexual, psychologically and emotionally marital. And they may be indeed romantically involved.\n\nAboriginal Australians are absent in Joan's story, exempting the one tracker who is brought in but fails to be any help in finding Miss McCraw, Marion and Miranda. But rather than being non-entities, it is by their absence they loom large throughout the novel. Weir, in his film, communicates an enduring Aboriginal possession of the land through capturing gigantic \"faces\" sculpted in the rock, which were even spoken about in interviews on the film and taken seriously as an overwhelming presence. The standard European concept of a linear timeline upon which one only incessantly moves forward is foreign to the Aboriginal conception of time that is bound up with the ever-present Dreamtime in which the past is ever ongoing. I'll not go into detail on the different conceptions of time, but this was a subject that fascinated Joan, and she likely felt that subject calling to her. She spoke of how her mere presence stopped watches, she couldn't wear one, and she didn't care for keeping time, thus her autobiography Time Without Clocks. (Those who do stop watches perhaps are inclined toward certain mystical conceptions of time.) In the novel time is literally stopped in its tracks by Hanging Rock. First Hussey, their driver, realizes his watch has stopped at high noon. McCraw realizes the same and suggests it has something to do with magnetism. Miranda no longer wears her \"pretty little diamond watch\" over her heart, while Irma states if she had Miranda's diamond watch she would wear it always, \"even in the bath\" and embarrasses Hussey by forwardly inquiring of him if he wouldn't do the same. Irma is not asked if she has a watch, and her remarks make it sound as though she doesn't have a diamond watch else she'd not envy Miranda her own, but later, after her rescue, when she is invited to lunch at Michael's uncle's home, she wears a tiny diamond watch. Mike warns her she must be punctual, but he purposefully misses the luncheon and excuses himself with a note stating that he had forgotten to consult his watch.\n\nLuncheon at Lake View was at one o'clock sharp. Irma, warned by the nephew that unpunctuality was a cardinal sin in a visitor, smoothed out her scarlet sash in the porch and glanced at her tiny diamond watch...\n\nIrma had, the day before the dinner, told Michael that Miranda used to say everything began and ended at exactly the right time. However his fascination with Miranda, he was certainly falling in love with Irma, the two bound by their experience on the rock, but this reminder of \"the right time\" seems a spur for his rejection of her. One wonders if Joan, in her own imagination, had Michael watching from afar to see if Irma would arrive punctually or be delinquent. Had she been delinquent, would he have not abandoned the romance? As two who neglected their watches, who weren't trapped in the Anglo-European prison of obligation to time, would they have remained together?\n\nIn the 18th chapter, Miranda remarks that they will arrive in \"the light\" as they are now perpetually at high noon, a place of no shadows. This is perhaps Joan's version of an Australian Aboriginal rainbow snake receiving the three wholly back into the fluid dream time, for which Irma is not ready. Not that she hasn't felt an ecstacy like that of the others, for she has and was even compelled to dance, and not that she isn't prepared to enter the rock, for Irma is, like the children of the Pied Piper, one who will follow the trusted Miranda even into the ground though out of the four she is the only one to be overcome with fear. She must finally keep asking what it is that the others are experiencing that she isn't, which began when she didn't feel the same pull of the \"monolith\" that so profoundly attracted the others. As they enter the rock, she begs for them all to stop so they may return home, yet it is obvious that if she was permitted to enter the rock, to follow, she would. But she is not permitted, for after the others disappear into the hole in the ground, the hanging boulder above falls down and covers the hole, Irma adamantly denied access.\n\nWe know none of this through the movie. The book, as it was published, doesn't let us in on the knowledge of a snake leading Miranda, McCraw and Marion to the hole down which they will disappear. But we do know enough to make a guess that their disappearance is mystical, because of their dream-like attitude, because of the stopped watches, and because of Pythagorean's Theorem.\n\nMiss McCraw, on the way to Hanging Rock, notes that theoretically there should be no reason for them to return late back to the college. She points out that their journey thus far had been composed of two sides of a triangle, they having made a sharp right angle turn outside Woodend (where the girls were finally permitted to remove their gloves, only as they drew away from civilization), which meant the sums of those sides would be greater than the hypotenuse. She posits that instead of returning the way by which they came, they should travel home by way of the third side of the triangle in order to get there the more quickly.\n\nRather than have this conversation in the film, Weir instead supplies a visual of a triangle while they are picnicking (and also while they are traveling to the rock, for they pass a triangular watering hole at the beginning). After Marion, Miranda, Irma and Edith have left to climb the rock, when all the girls who remained at its base eventually take their afternoon naps, McCraw, with an air of either curiosity or uneae, looks from a page of her math book to the rock. We have the visual of her eyes moving to the rock via a mathematical theorem concerning a triangle and circle. It is a problem on page 221 of Sidney Luxton Loney's 1893, Plane Trigonometry, An Elementary Course, Excluding the Use of Imaginary Quantities.\n\nBelow are some of Weir's other triangles.\n\nNear the beginning, he pairs Marion, cleaning the circlets of her glasses, with an equilateral triangle enclosing a shell shape in her window.\n\nMrs. Appleyard, in her study, is observed with a red equilateral triangle behind her that serves as a frame for a picture. We are never given a good close-up of it, but there appears to be a woman on the left and perhaps a child on the right. The triangle also can be thought of as framing a circle. This frame remains on her mantle throughout the film.\n\nWeir has the flaps for the very vehicle in which the girls will travel to Hanging Rock manifest a triangle. It travels a circular path.\n\nThe triangular waterhole at the beginning of their journey to Hanging Rock rests apart from but alongside a sharp bend in the road.\n\nThere are other triangles as well, such as the pediments above the windows at Appleyard College. Do we include those? And there is a most notable triangle that I've not included in this section but will get to later.\n\nJoan describes Miss McCraw as being angular, shaped like a flat iron, and when she is fully divested of all but her underwear in the end she is revealed as being triangular in shape. She is essentially math. On the other hand, when Irma leaps over the stream on her walk up to Hanging Rock with the others, Albert remarks that she has an \"hourglass\" shape, which again aligns her with time. That this comment was in the film but not in the book suggests Weir perhaps understanding that Irma's lack of antipathy for keeping time separated her from the others who disappeared.\n\nA Mason of Queensland, Australia writes on the sacred geometry of Pythagorean's Theorem, which is important to freemasonry:\n\nAccording to Plutarch (46 - 120 C.E.), the Egyptians attributed the sides of the triangle in this fashion. The vertical line was of 3 units and attributed to Osiris. The horizontal line was of 4 units and attributed to Isis. And the hypotenuse was, of course, 5 units and attributed to Horus, the son of Osiris and Isis. It is noteworthy that Plutarch studied in the Academy at Athens and was a priest at Apollo's temple at Delphi for 20 years. In the myth of Osiris and Isis, Osiris is killed which makes Horus the Son of a Widow and links him with Hiram!!\n\nThe units of the triangle's side are significant. The three units of the Osiris vertical have been attributed to the three Alchemical principles of Salt, Sulphur and Mercury. All things are manifestations of these three principles according to Alchemical doctrine. The four units of the horizontal line of Isis relate to the so-called four elements: earth, air, water, and fire. These are of course the four Ancients. The ascending Horus line with its five units represents the five kingdoms: mineral, plant, animal, human, and the Fifth Kingdom. This is the Path of Return. The ascending line finally connects back up with the Osirian line. The Fifth Kingdom symbolizes the Adept as one who has consciously reunited with the Source of all Being.\n\nSource: http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/geometry_masonry.html\n\nThis is the Path of Return. And such is the path of return that Miss McCraw had suggested they take, mystifying the others, then followed up with some quip about how the mountain had come to Mohammed and now the mountain had come to Mr. Hussey, the driver of their wagon.\n\nWhen Mr. Hussey realizes his watch has stopped, the French governess is unable to check her own as it is being repaired at a shop in (drumroll) Golden Square. Again, Pythagoras, math, the golden ratio. Later, when she realizes Miranda is a Botticelli angel, she announces, \"Now I know!\" Greta asks her, \"What do you know?\" Rather than answering, Dianne privately muses it would be \"impossible to explain or even think clearly on a summer afternoon of things that really mattered. Love for instance, when only a few minutes ago the thought of Louis' hand expertly turning the key of the little Sivres clock had made her feel almost ready to faint...\"\n\nGreta would have understood if Mademoiselle's entrancement had been described in terms of math. In fact, Tom, the handyman, crafted a joke valentine for her of squared paper covered with sums. \"She had received it with dry approval, figures in the eyes of Greta McCraw being a good deal more acceptable than roses and forget-me-nots. The very sight of a sheet of paper dotted over with numerals gave her a secret joy...they could be sorted out, divided, multiplied, re-arranged to miraculous new conclusions.\" One has the sense that Dianne de Poitiers' heart is being fixed by the repairman whom she will marry on Easter, their romance spurred by the drama of the disappearance of the girls, it likely their engagement would have been a protracted one if not for their disappearance. So, too, the housemaid, Minnie, and her lover, Tom. It's after the disappearances that they as well become engaged to be married on Easter (Minnie soon realizes she is pregnant) and leave the service of Appleyard College. The short route home for these two couples begins that day, a physical one bound to romantic, worldly love. Whereas Greta, Marion and Miranda enter into the eternal light of noon, their loves being abstract.\n\nIf at first it is difficult to comprehend why McCraw and Marion are the ones found by this dream time and so fully acquiesce, with only a little consideration it should become even more difficult to understand how Miranda might be so easily swept away. She is loving and beautiful almost to a fault in that she is conspicuously so in both book and film, but especially in the book. She is compassionate, engaged and involved with others. And yet she appears to willingly abandon herself to a mystery that has catastrophic ripples, at least in human eyes--the ensuing miseries of the families of Miranda and Marion, the death of poor Sara, as well as the deaths of unsavory characters such as Mrs. Appleyard, Miss Lumley, and her brother. With or without the 18th chapter, the impression is had of Miss McCraw, Marion and Miranda permitting themselves to cross or be carried across a boundary of no return, Marion and McCraw the two most intellectual of the characters, while Miranda represents love, the heart as one's spiritual guide. Miranda does warn Sara, beforehand, that she (Miranda) will be gone soon and so Sara must learn to love others. This assumes premonitory dimensions in the film even before the disappearances occur, while in the book this bit of history isn't disclosed until much later, but Miranda is also a senior who would, indeed, soon be leaving school, and the younger Sara was going to have to learn to live without her. Though the movie sets up a possible sexual context for their affection, and the book allows that there are no possible (male) suitors for the girls until they go into the world, the book makes clear that Sara is the youngest student at Appleyard, being only thirteen, and her relationship to Miranda, though intense, is that of a young orphan who has placed all their trust in one individual. Had Sara heeded Miranda's warning, she would have survived the prospect of being returned to the orphanage when her guardian failed to pay her tuition on time. She was no sooner dead than her guardian wrote that he would be picking her up for Easter vacation, and had that not occurred the arts teacher had previously written Sara insisting that she take refuge in her own home. Though the arts teacher's letter didn't reach Sara in a timely fashion (delays drive much of her sorrow), it would have eventually. Joan seems to want to have shown that Sara had loving, caring recourses to which she closed herself by responding principally to Appleyard's hatred rather than to the love expressed by others.\n\nBut she too ends up arriving \"in the light\", as with Marion, Miranda and McCraw. When Sara dies she visits her brother in a vision or dream that makes his dark room bright as day. However, she has had to come a \"long way\". Perhaps she has had to come the long way because the \"short route\", her return home, had already been taken and she had to travel the longer sides of the triangle to reach Bertie.\n\nStepping back to the relationship of Sara and Irma, and the lesbianism that seems to be in the film, less so in the book, Weir says he was shocked when these relationships between the girls and Mrs. Appleyard and McCraw were interpreted as lesbianism, that this hadn't been on his mind. Perhaps this is so. But he also has Sara as being on level ground with Miranda age wise and Sara's pining appears to be something other than in the book.\n\nAll [the Valentines] were madly romantic and strictly anonymous--supposedly the silent tributes of lovesick admirers; although Mr. Whitehead the elderly English gardener and Tom the Irish groom were almost the only two males to be so much as smiled at during the term.\n\nEither the Valentines were crafted by Santa or the girls were expressing affection and even crushes, the sexuality fluid, some purely platonic and others not. Joan makes room for speculation but the fact they're all anonymous may be her way of limiting things with no directly expressed avowals. But this isn't the case in the film. Miranda reads her valentine that is given her by Sara, while Sara sits eagerly and devotedly by, seeming pretty clearly lovesick. The other girls read valentines that also seem to have been given them by those who rest nearby silently listening. The school is steeped in sensual feeling. Whatever will happen when the girls are unleashed into a mixed sex world, as represented in the film and book they are all vestal \"virgins\" of love who are apart from the \"masculine\" world, protected from the masculine world with their being housed at a girl's college where they are somewhat ironically being educated for marriage, to fill a particular kind of Victorian role in marriage, and are expected to enter marriage with their \"virtue\" intact. Rather than expressing an interest in Michael or Albert, who are nearby at the picnic area, the girls retire among themselves. An exception is Irma, who with some gentle forwardness plays with exercising her sexuality on the elder (and quite safe) Hussey, embarrassing him when she states she would wear such a watch as Miranda's always, even in the bath, then asking if Hussey would, which is to invite Hussey to imagine her in the bath and placing herself in the position of imagining him in his bath, and so he becomes uncomfortable.\n\nIrma was unable to follow Miranda into the ground because of Michael. In the book it's eventually divulged that as soon as she saw him on the plain, she realized he was the love of her life. She is thus too attached to the world. And Michael reminds, though his fate is different, of Sara, whom Miranda had said should learn to love others. He too becomes fixated on Miranda. Seeking Miranda on the rock, he instead discovers Irma, which is almost a disappointment for him. Miranda is \"love\" personified but is also abstract in that she is a spirit. \"Love\", in the form of Miranda, was indeed leading Michael to Irma, but though he and Irma are attracted to one another he is unable to transfer that \"love\" to her and drops her in his rude way on a day that seems to answer his rejection with a furious, angry storm. They will never meet again.\n\nWeir's Depiction of the Ascents of the Rock Compared with the Book, and the Wounding of Michael and Irma\n\nWeir certainly has sympathy for Aboriginal spirituality, going on to make The Last Wave after Picnic at Hanging Rock. In the manner in which Weir subtly communicated in Picnic at Hanging Rock the eternal round and a sense of deja vu, I'm not, however, certain that he was sharing his interpretation of Joan's conceptions (which are never articulated in depth) or his interpretation of Nietzsche's or his interpretation of what he understood of Aboriginal time. As I said previously, it would be difficult to sort out and discuss the particulars of Joan's concepts, just as here it would be difficult to discuss exactly whose lead Weir was following, but it can easily be shown that he was attempting to visually communicate the eternal round through a disruption of strict chronology.\n\nSo let's look at his depiction of the ascents up the rock.\n\nAs the girls, still at Appleyard, prepare to leave, several of them dance in a round, holding hands (circularity). They sing \"Dormez-vous? Dormez-vous?\" the French nursery rhyme which is itself a \"round\". Cut to Mrs. Appleyard in her office checking her watch. Then back to the yard and Miss McCraw entering it, but apart from others, and seemingly very aware of her isolation from the others, Dianne standing in a circle with Irma and Marion and Miranda, some other girls having formed their own circle, and Edith, like Miss McCraw, off to herself. McCraw seems very conscious that Dianne and the girls don't open their circle to include her as Dianne raises her hand to show a ring on her finger (circularity), she already apparently engaged. Perhaps she is taken aback because of Marion associating herself with the French governess rather than her. She looks back at Edith who stands so very obviously and awkwardly apart. Then Edith rings the bell (the Frere Jacques rhyme has the priest still sleeping when the bell needs ringing) and we realize that one reason Edith has been standing apart is her role of ringing the bell. All descend the stairs to the circular drive (circularity). In the center of the lawn circumscribed by the drive there may be a statue of Venus. White turkeys run about in a flock, recalling the girls. Mrs. Appleyard comes outside to warn them of the dangers of the rock and tell them when they're expected back.\n\nThat Edith has the job of ringing the bell anticipates her being the one to flee the rock screaming. If we take our cue from the rhyme then the idea is of waking from sleep. The bell's function is this in the rhyme, and Edith's screaming down the mountain wakes her schoolfellows from sleep on the plain below. We may also consider it spiritually.\n\nAfter the drag leaves the gates of Appleyard College, McCraw remarks on, \"This we do for pleasure, that we may shortly be at the mercy of venemous snakes and poisonous ants. How foolish we human creatures be.\" In the next shot we see from afar the drag passing a triangular pond on a curved road.\n\nThey pass through Woodend, then Hussey points out the rock to the girls. McCraw makes her remarks on how the mountain comes to Mohammed and Hanging Rock to Hussey. They then have their exchange about the great age of the rock. A million years old. Irma muses that it has been waiting a million years just for them.\n\nThere is a scene of Michael and his aunt and uncle, his aunt warning him of snakes, just as Mrs. Appleyard had warned the girls against snakes, followed by his initiation of a friendship with Albert. As he approaches Albert, we have a close-up of a cicada on Albert's cuff. Michael notices it. Albert takes the cicada in hand, shakes it, which sets it singing, and then throws it into the air. (The cicada can be a symbol of rebirth, and is cognate with the Bacchae.) Albert says it couldn't be much after noon. The two share a drink by the stream which the girls will cross in order to ascend the rock.\n\nThe girls now arrive at Hanging Rock. Miranda alights and opens the gate. Birds take wing, again as if a premonitory gesture, that they are aware of the significance of the arrival.\n\nIn the book, we only have a brief view of the picnic area of Michael's uncle and aunt before the girls cross the stream, which is when we will have our first dialogue between Michael and Albert. Michael's aunt does not warn him about snakes. There will be no business about the cicada. Albert will not mention that it must be a little after noon. Instead, in the book, it is Hussey who says it is nearly noon just before McCraw gives her story of how returning by the hypotenuse would be a shorter way home.\n\nCut to the girls (they strike as being perhaps intended to recall the Bacchae) toasting St. Valentine, Miranda ceremonially cutting a heart-shaped cake through the center, separating Vale from ntine. Perhaps coincidentally, we have the vale (valley) thus divided from the peaks (tine), the high from the low, just as the stream separates the plain from the rock. At the bottom is a decorative S scroll. If we consider the shape of the swan's neck, the S then strikes me as a hieroglyphic representation of when Miranda later crosses the stream, Michael musing that she does so with the grace of one of the swans on his uncle's lake. As that is unvoiced in the film, it seems to me it could be an oblique visual reference.\n\nBack at the college, Mrs. Appleyard has her encounter with Sara over her refusal and inability to learn the Hemans poem.\n\nAt Hanging Rock, the girls resting, Miranda looks at flowers through a magnifying glass, and McCraw, eating a banana, reads her math book. She switches the banana from her right hand to her left just as Hussey notices his watch has stopped and we have the conversation concerning the stopped watches. Hussey, glancing at the sun, says it must be well after two. McCraw takes up her banana again in her right hand to continue eating it (she had set it and the book down to consult her stopped watch) and we notice a continuity error as the banana is longer than it was before. But McCraw seems to vaguely notice as well, glancing at the banana after taking a bite.\n\nOr is this a continuity error? I don't know as we have things happen later that suggest time being not as it was and their not being conscious of it. They are not fully awake, unaware of the eternal recurrence.\n\nEdith muses, looking at the Fitzhubert picnic area, that they might be the only creatures in the world, Weir then following with images of ants porting off pieces of Valentine's cake, Edith having disregarded everything that isn't human. Later, when Marion looks down from the rock at the small figures of everyone on the plain, we are supposed to be reminded of this scene and make a comparison.\n\nMarion requests to do her measurements at the rock. As they start off, Marion is in the lead, Irma follows, then Edith, and finally Miranda who waves back at mademoiselle who makes her Botticelli comment (which is unvoiced in the book). The next shot shows the group as they are normally ordered in their rambles, Miranda, Irma, Marion and Edith. When they reach the stream, the crossing is inverted, first Edith, then Marion, Irma and Miranda. Watching, Albert says he thought Edith was going to take a bath (which brings back to mind Irma's comment that she would wear a diamond watch like Miranda's always, even in the bath, then had asked Hussey if he wouldn't do the same). Albert comments on Irma's hourglass figure and Miranda's legs. \"All the way up to her bum,\" Michael says, and yet he also states that he'd prefer if Albert didn't say such things. Albert holds that he's simply saying the things that others think. Michael rises and says he is going to stretch his legs. He follows the girls across the stream, which sets it up so that the audience will wonder if Michael and Albert were involved in the disappearance of the girls.\n\nThe girls reach the lower levels of Hanging Rock and continue their ascent. When Miranda beckons, \"Look!\", Edith stares at the ground and Miranda redirects her gaze up.\n\nA beautiful 360 degree pan is had that begins with Miranda, Marion, Irma and Edith viewed from the side in their ascent to the right. The camera pans left away from them and the rocks, through forest to more rocks, and then ends in showing the girls from the rear as they continue their ascent. It is a somewhat disorienting shot for we've panned left from one group of rocks to what seems like another group of rocks opposite, which we know is impossible as there is only one great group of rocks. The pan continues and then we see the girls from the rear and we realize that we've come a full circle.\n\nMiranda, Irma, Marion and Edith continue through the rocks. At a stone clearing in the rocks, Edith rests on a dead tree while Miranda, Marion and Irma continue on. From above we have a shot of Miranda, Irma, Marion and Edith. We then have a critical shot in which the usual line-up of Miranda leading shifts. From the side we view Miranda through a slit in the rocks. She stops to gaze down the slit in the direction of the camera, Irma, Marion and Edith passing at normal speed behind her. Miranda follows now at the rear. The next shot again has us looking through a side passage, closer in, as Irma, Marion, then Edith pass at normal pace. There is then a barely noticed cut on the empty passage (1:19:21 from the end), return to the same scene, and then Miranda passes in isolation, her hair floating slightly on the air, she at a slightly slower film speed. Cut to one of the giant \"faces\" in the rock in profile. Next a view from behind of Miranda, then from above as Miranda, Irma, Marion and Edith exit onto another rocky clearing (1:18:47 from the end).\n\nTo me the barely perceptible cut at 1:19:21 from the end, between Edith and Miranda, Miranda then shown in slow motion, fits in with the pattern of circularity and perhaps repetition, for with that cut, the way Miranda is isolated, she could already be leading again, just as she as leading in the following shots. It fits in with the shot of McCraw returning to her banana and it is longer than it was and she seems to appraise then dismiss it. (One could look at it this way. When McCraw glances at her banana and ignores the hint at circularity, or eternal recurrence, the banana being slightly longer, she is also acting out the audience response in assuming a continuity error.) Also, it seems to me this is why we had the shot of Miranda stopping and standing gazing down the passage while the others progress ahead and she follows up at the rear. In this way Weir makes us highly conscious of an order and that Miranda had taken up the rear, and we should notice in a few shots when she suddenly is in the lead again. The continuity incident with the banana had occurred with the notice of time having frozen at noon. What had Neitzsche written? \"This ring in which you are but a grain will glitter afresh forever. And in every one of these cycles of human life there will be one hour where, for the first time one man, and then many, will perceive the mighty thought of the eternal recurrence of all things:- and for mankind this is always the hour of Noon\". The repetition is also subtly had in the book with exposition revealing that bananas were \"inseparable from an Australian picnic\", then later when McCraw eats her banana it is with \"disastrous results\" as she is sketched by two sisters, and Hussey approaches to observe that his watch has stopped.\n\nAt this particular clearing, Miranda having just announced they can't go much farther as they'd promised they'd not be gone long, Irma wishes they could instead be out all night and watch the moon rise. Edith pipes up and says Sara writes poetry about Miranda while Marion takes out a right angle square and holds it angle side down as she lifts it to the sky to make her measurements of the rocks.\n\nNow is when Irma tells her story of Sara as the doomed deer that could not survive in captivity. Feeling ill, Edith rests. Irma removes her shoes and does her dance against the sun. Edith wakes to find all the girls but her have removed their stockings and shoes and are walking away. She follows.\n\nMarion gazes down at their schoolmates asleep at the bottom of the rock. She wonders what they're doing down there, at the lack of purpose, though she decides it's probable they are performing some function of which they are themselves unaware. It is now that Miranda says everything begins and ends at exactly the right time and place and invites all to look up at the monolith.\n\nSuddenly overcome, they lie down to sleep on a stony area under the monolith. Bugs crawl on Irma's feet. A lizard slides by Miranda. Back at the picnic area, everyone sleeps but for McCraw who is reading her trigonometry book. She looks from the book to the height of the rock and back to the book with its figure of the circle over the triangle. At the height of the triangle and at the base are mathematical theta figures. Wikipedia notes that Tau was once a symbol for life and resurrection, whereas Theta was a symbol of death. The Egyptians had a cross in the circle as a symbol of the soul, which it seems was a version of Theta. Kosmos was represented by a form of Theta in which the world was a fiery circle and the snake spanning its middle was a \"good spirit\". It had kinship to the glyph of the sun being a circle with a dot in the middle. But in Athens, Theta was used as an abbreviation for thanatos, meaning death, and was considered to resemble a human skull. It was used as a warning like a skull and crossbones. Does McCraw feel a foreboding? It seems that she does, but of what?\n\nAs the discussion of the Pythagorean Theorem that was in the book had been left out of the film, Weir instead opting to use that time for the \"million years\" conversation on the age of the rock, Weir injects a visual representation of the triangle here. One could say that in the way it is done we have the triangle superimposed upon the rock where Marion, not too long before, had been making her measurements with the right angle. As far as the film goes, to represent the triangle conversation visually makes a stronger connection to the rock and sacred geometry, but doing so does sacrifice the idea of the hypotenuse as an expedited path home.\n\nIt is now that McCraw would have begun her ascent of the rock.\n\nWe are shown the monolith again, then through rippling air we view the girls asleep from above. Then Miranda, Marion and Irma continue their ascent, moving in slow motion. Edith demands when are they going home (remember the triangle and McCraw speaking of taking the short path home), and as the girls disappear behind a turn, the screaming Edith begins her run down the rock. Cut to Mrs. Appleyard rising and going to her window to look out upon the white turkeys.\n\nWe have seen nothing alarming, so we are uncertain why Edith reacts so profoundly as she does to the others continuing to climb. Why does she screech and run as if she is scared out of her mind? Her reaction doesn't necessarily fit with what we've observed, except the eerie bits have us assume that there's something instead going on psychically that has profoundly agitated her.\n\nAs I stated earlier, I think there is a connection between Edith ringing the \"waking\" bell at the college and Edith screaming down the rocks. When Edith had rung the bell, the congregation of turkeys mimicked the milling of the girls. It's interesting that as Edith screams her way down the rock, Weir returns to the college, Mrs. Appleyard rising as if she has become aware of something peculiar even at this distance, going to look at the turkeys.\n\nSkipping ahead now to the ascent of Michael and Albert. They approach the rock from a different angle than the buggy had and search the rock separately. We are shown a profile view of a monolith just before Michael reaches what may be a suspended boulder. He is called by Albert, and leaves a white flag of paper at that point before going back down. Michael decides to stay the night and continue his search while Albert returns home.\n\nNo mention is made in the book of the Victorian preoccupation with Egyptology, but when Albert makes excuses to Michael's uncle about why he is not there, speaking to the uncle in his study, we see on the door a painting of Egyptian glyphs. In the foreground there seems to rise up, out of focus, the statuette of a cobra. By researching the crown the central figure wears in the painting of the hieroglyph, which is the double crown of the united lower and upper Egypt, I was able to find the original carving on which this painting was based. It is of Ptolemy XII, the father of the famed Cleopatra who committed suicide by asp. His nickname came to be Auletes, the pipes-player, for he loved playing the pipes, so there may or may not be a connection with the pipe music in the film (pan pipes are used, which for the Victorians would have represented the voice of mysterious, archaic myth and spirituality, and are likely a substitute in the film for the didgeridoo). The scene, from the Temple of Kom Ombo, is of Ptolemy XII between Nekhbet, on the left, wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt, and Wadjet on the right, the serpent goddess of Lower Egypt, dressed in its crown. Both are guardians, protectors of the pharaoh, and goddesses of childbirth. The temple is a dual one dedicated to Sobek, the crocodile god, and Haroeris, a form of Horus. As a dual temple, I read that it has \"most everything twice, the entrance, the Great Court...\".\n\nBy including this hieroglyph, Weir brings up Victorian interest in the exotic esoteric and, by extension, all its attending spiritual and colonial complications.\n\nWe see on the wall in the study a boomerang.\n\nThe room brings up the problem of interpreting what occurs on the rock via the Victorian lens.\n\nIn the book when the girls ask if they can also take off their hats as well as their gloves, McCraw protests, \"...there is no necessity to look like a wagon load of gypsies\" then re-enters \"the world of pure uncluttered reason\". This is not in the film and the Egyptian painting may reference it as the word \"gypsies\" comes from \"Egyptian\". What does Egyptian come from? A word meaning \"temple of the soul of Ptah\", the creator god who made everything through thought and the magic of the word. The architect god. If one looks up Ptah and masonry one will find Masonic writings on Ptah as the originator of masonry, and thus mason tools become Ptah's symbols, such as the right angle square. I've no doubt that the uncle's interest in Egyptology was not only due a Victorian preoccupation but that he would also have been a mason, at least according to Weir.\n\nThe next morning, Michael, who the book reveals has only once before spent the night outside and that in very protected circumstances on a beach with friends, is clearly disoriented as he begins his exploration anew. He encounters a lizard, which we are shown from the front, its seemingly toothless mouth agape. He seems disconcerted. This is his encounter with the snake, as prefigured by the cobra in his uncle's office, as forewarned by his aunt and uncle at the rock.\n\nThe frilled-neck lizard does actually have little teeth, and even long incisors, but it's not dangerous. A Guugu Yimithirr tribal member tells a frilled-neck lizard story on the acquiring of the frill, which it didn't originally have. It comes to a tree in which there is a bees' nest and tells his blackbird sisters he will climb up and get it. He tastes a bit of the honey for himself. When he reaches his hand in a second time, the blackbird sisters sing out that they want a taste, to throw some down. The lizard eats it himself and tells them he needs some grass to soak up the honey and that he will throw that down and they can suck on it. When they can't find the right grass, he has them take off their skirts and throw them up to him. He says he will soak the skirts in honey and they can suck on those. Instead, he soaks the skirts in honey then eats them, such is his greediness, and that's how he got his frill.\n\nThe insertion of the frilled neck dragon at this point in the film seems decorative and a hint at danger (beware the venomous snakes) but when Michael is later found, and Irma is discovered because he clasps a bit of cloth in his hand, we assume that cloth is from a torn skirt. Also, we have the problem in both book and film of certain items of clothing never being found, such as McCraw's skirt. A story such as this could be taken as an answer. In this case, I imagine it certainly has to do with Irma.\n\nThe Rainbow Serpent who, much like Ptah, went about creating, is brought in again via the frilled lizard, for the Rainbow Serpent also had a habit of swallowing things. One story has the Rainbow Serpent (Goorialla), while going about molding the world, swallowing two brothers who ran into its mouth for protection during a rain storm. The morning after, the boys aren't found but the tracks of Goorialla are and so it was known that it had swallowed them. Thusly, that is why the rainbow is seen after a storm. It's Goorialla the Rainbow Serpent.\n\nWe are shown the profile of the monolith again. Michael reaches one of the stony clearings on the rock and is overtaken by the same sleep as the girls had been. How is Weir to depict the dream had by Michael in the book? He considers it essential and so keeps it in the film.\n\nMichael is expressly shown lying down so his head and upper torso are in a deep shadow. But then cut to a close-up of Michael asleep, and his head is in full blazing sunlight which must be from overhead. We hear McCraw talking about the watch having stopped at twelve, which is that Nietzschean hour of eternal recurrence so I doubt we have a continuity error or that we are simply to assume that Michael has been asleep for this long (and even if he had been, we have that skip from him resting in shadow to instead full sunlight accompanied by McCraw's remark). Michael heard something like voices in his dream in the book, and what Weir does is fill his dream with things we heard said before and during the ascent. From McCraw's remark, Weir moves on to Miranda's statement that everything begins and ends at the right time and place. The voices are out of order, not chronological. The way that Weir does this certainly keeps open, for the viewer, the question that Michael may have followed them all the way up the rock, for him to be dreaming what they said. The girls again begin what we last saw of their ascent, this superimposed over Michael. Miranda repeats that everything begins and ends at the right time and place (recollect the image from the temple of Kom Ombo where everything is represented twice, and we have Miranda's statement on time and place given twice). With this second utterance of \"time\" a dark mark very briefly appears on Michael's brow hidden within this superimposition. It looks like a flaw in the film. But a mere second later, as Edith screams, a wound spontaneously appears at the same place on Michael's brow as he starts awake. He sticks a piece of paper on some Queen Anne's lace behind him, then begins climbing the rock again, desperate. He knows. He is no longer searching, he has found and must reach what he has found. We see him through fluid air, as if trying to swim his way up the rock, struggling against resisting unseen forces.\n\nBelow are screengrabs of what I've described above. Had to bounce around between Youtube and Hulu as it's tough to do screengrabs on Hulu (thus Youtube) but Hulu's version of the film was the old one(?) showing the mark in the third image. Apparently the restoration of the film doesn't have the mark. But I have a difficult time buying that the mark is accidental because it is not entirely black but has a red hue on the edges, and though it is not exactly a duplication of the wound, when turned 90 degrees is the same length and width as the wound.\n\nThe above grouping of images shows that Michael lies down to rest in the same place that Edith laid down to rest when Marion made her measurements and Irma told Miranda she wished they could watch the moon rise. They then had the doom conversation. Edith was wearing blue ribbons and Mike wears blue suspenders. Much was made in the book of Edith's blue ribbons, the other girls thinking they weren't fashionable while Edith showed off in them. Weir has Edith's blue ribbons seem to have a correspondance with the blue suspenders he's given Mike. These will end up having a correspondance with a painting later seen in the film of a guardian angel, wearing a blue sash, leading a child across a \"bridge\" (I have found the Victorian painting online and this is it's name.) We see the painting when Dianne takes the officer in to get a pair of Miranda's bloomers for the bloodhound. Before the painting, on a dresser, is an image of the poet, Lord Byron.\n\nWe also see the painting of the guardian angel later in a scene immediately before the hysteria episode with Irma's visit, when Dianne walks in on Sara talking to Miranda's photo and she tells Sara that Miranda will not likely be returning. Sara tells her that Miranda had secrets, that she knew she wouldn't be coming back. In the scene immediately after Irma is also accused of having secrets in the book though not in the film. You will notice that now the Byron print is marred with a white mark on the forehead in the approximate place where Mike received his head wound. These things are certainly connected as that mark on the print wasn't there in the scene when Dianna and the officer took the bloomers from the room, before Mike received the wound. The Byron photo, the mark on it, the guardian angel and Michael's blue suspenders are all Weir. Why would Weir choose Byron? As Mike's foot was injured immediately after he woke with the head wound, could it be because Byron limped due some deformity of one of his feet? Within another few paragraphs I'll discuss this further.\n\nAfter his dream vision, leaving a flag on a bush, his foot by now injured, Mike makes his way through a passage to another clearing across which he struggles toward another passage.\n\nAlbert, looking for Michael, comes across the flag on the bush Michael had left after his dream. In the book, each of Albert's forearms are tattooed with mermaids. Weir changes this so his right arm is tattooed with a mermaid while his left is tattooed with Botticelli's birth of Venus on the seashell. We only now get a clear view of this.\n\nThe Venus links to Miranda and also to the cicada, symbol of rebirth, that was on Michael's left shirt cuff when we first saw him at the picnic ground.\n\nAlbert had climbed up the same passage Michael had traversed after his dream, and came to the clearing across which Michael could barely struggle, as if fighting through a great resistance. We see that this is the same clearing on which the girls had their last sleep under the monolith, the same clearing where they left Edith and she went screaming down the mount. The police had made it to this clearing with their bloodhound that indicated it smelled something but they found nothing. Michael Fitzhubert, by name, has a correspondance, with the bloodhound. Bloodhounds are held to descend from a breed that originated out of the Abbey of Saint-Hubert, Belgium. Hubert was the patron saint of archers, hunters (and even mathematicians). He was said to have had a revelatory vision, while hunting, of a stag with a cross between its antlers. He became an advocate for compassionate hunting.\n\nIt is off this clearing that Albert finds Mike who is in complete shock.\n\nIn the book as it was published Edith fled from this clearing as the girls disappeared into the passage behind the monolith. In the version with the 18th chapter the chronology is slightly different for she is not mentioned as being present at this clearing where they see the monolith and have the discussion on the people below being as ants, on the smoke from the fires below, on the sound of drumming. It is here that Marion feels the monolith turning her inside out, which Irma does not. They pass beyond the monolith and fall into their deep sleep when it is out of sight. When they awake it is to a colorless twilight and McCraw appears, dragging herself up. They all toss off their corsets. A hole as positive space appears to McCraw, and the snake appears that leads three of the four (not Irma) down a hole beyond heart-shaped leaves.\n\nThe serpentine-edged lace that had been clutched in Mike's hand reminds of the lichen (or lichen imprints) covering parts of Hanging Rock. But it may also remind of the Queen Anne's lace upon which had stuck a white flag.\n\nJust as Mike's wound spontaneously appeared, it is as if out of the dream time the lace became manifest.\n\nMiranda's favorite flower was given as a daisy, and her lace had a daisy pattern. This is not that lace.\n\nMike having confided the lace to Albert, he races back to the rock, to the same clearing where he'd found Michael. We see him fairly easily clambering up the passage toward which Michael had been so heroically struggling, barely able to move. The resistance that had been present, constraining Michael, is not there now for Albert. He finds Irma, who had been previously found by Michael. Over the cave in which she's secreted is a rocky protrusion that seems to me to resemble the head of a snake.\n\nWhen Irma is discovered, she has a wound on her head in the same place as Michael. Is this like a stigmata that has appeared on Michael's head? Is it a sympathetic connection between him and Irma? It isn't explained in the book. Weir decides to keep this wound and not only not explain it but show it as appearing mysteriously, spontaneously.\n\nTo skip ahead. The rescue of Irma is by the team of Michael and Albert. However, in the book, when Albert climbs the rock with the knowledge had in Michael's note, he does so with the police, not alone. Weir chooses to have Albert by himself discover Irma and it is a heart-wrenching scene. We feel his care for her in his discovery of her as he grasps Irma up in his arms. We feel his desperation in his isolation with her as he rushes to the height of the rock to call after the wagon that is riding away on the plain. We feel just how small he is on the rock. He is a rescuer, a hero, and yet we are terrified for him.\n\nNow, that head wound, which I get the feeling, as represented by Weir, is an expression of the eternal recurrence, and is not simply an excuse for not remembering events because of a possible concussion.\n\nBecause we are dealing with circularity, the eternal recurrence, my recourse is going to be to a biblical verse that seems to speak to the ouroboros, often pictured as the snake eating its own tail.\n\nAnd the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed...upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel...\"\n\nThis \"dust\" to be eaten by the serpent is the same as \"for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return\". The dust of which Adam was formed. A dust to be eaten by the serpent that grasps the heel even as the heel bruises its head. Michael's movements on the rock seem suggestive of this. He wakes from his dream of the girls climbing on, and he has relived what has happened to them to the extent of our own knowledge, what Weir had shown us. This wound Michael receives perhaps represents in part the knowledge he's received, which compels him on when he wakes, seeming certain of the path he should take. His ankle/foot immediately being injured, and our last image of his \"swimming\" up the rock on his belly.\n\nSo he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.\n\nHere may be another layer of the story of Appleyard and Hanging Rock. Joan was a gardener and the beauty of the gardens at Appleyard and the Fitzhubert's are recounted again and again. Appleyard, at the beginning, is a place of safe and voluptuous but controlled beauty. Mrs. Appleyard warns the girls, as they leave for their picnic, \"Once again let me remind you that the Rock itself is extremely dangerous and you are therefore forbidden to engage in any tomboy foolishness in the matter of explorations, even on the lower slopes. It is, however, a geological marvel on which you will be required to write a brief essay on Monday morning. I also wish to remind you that the vicinity is renowned for its venomous snakes and poisonous ants of various species. I think that is all. Have a pleasant day and try to behave yourselves in a manner to bring credit to the College...\" The strict admonitions are all Victorian restraint but echo too the story of Eden, wherein one can only venture so far and no further, wherein one is restrained yet living in beauty and pleasure.\n\nSpeaking of dust and the ouroboros, when Miss McCraw steps into the carriage, Hussey says to her to mind her gloves on the wheel as it's dusty, and yet, \"He had long ago given up attempting to teach this basic truth to lady passengers about to enter one of his cabs.\"\n\nSupport for my theory may be had in the message Mike leaves in his notebook in Joan's book, the notebook from which Mike tore the pages from which he made \"flags\", sticking them on trees and bushes to mark his trail.\n\nAs soon as Albert had attended to the horses he flung himself fully clothed on his unmade truckle bed and fell asleep. He seemed to have hardly laid his head on the pillow before he was wide awake and staring at the little square of grey light at the window, with the events of yesterday, no longer confused by physical exhaustion as they had been last night, falling neatly into place like the pieces of a fretwork puzzle. Except that one of the key pieces was missing. Which was it, and where exactly did it fit into the pattern? Better start at the beginning when he had found Mike slumped over the tussock on Saturday morning. How far had he wandered before he had fallen and injured his ankle? Had he gone back to the laurel bush and started again from there? Those silly little paper flags...! The next minute Albert had sprung out of the bed and was pulling on his boots...Thank God the pigskin notebook was still there! He took it over to the window and by its sickly light began slowly deciphering the scribbled entries, page by page. They appeared to begin in March of last year, starting off with an appointment at a Cambridge address, a cure for distemper, copied out from Country Life. Memo -- Call for tennis racquet. At last, opposite a page bearing the sole item 'Worm Powders' he came upon the one he was looking for. A scrawl of crooked capitals, in pencil:\n\nALBERT ABOVE BUSH MY FLAGS\n\nHURRY RING OF HIGH UP HIGH\n\nHURRY FOUN\n\nPatterns. Joan has Albert helping to find Irma by scrutinizing patterns.\n\nOpposite the worm powder (dust) are the instructions for finding what Mike has discovered. A ring. High. The bush is a laurel bush (Queen Anne's lace in the film) and I will pursue this subject further in another section on Apollo-Python and Daphne, the Laurel.\n\nAs Albert searches for this \"high\" \"ring\" with the policeman and the doctor, they each have different viewpoints on the message. The policeman thinks it refers to a diamond ring because an heiress (Irma) is involved. Albert says it will be a ring of stones. Jim, the policeman, reminds that \"we policeman are trained to look at every angle...\"\n\nWhen Weir shows us Michael being carried out on the stretcher, rather than having the wound exposed or wrapped in a bandage that ties around the head, he has a square of white placed over it, spotted with blood, which sets it up for us to make a connection between this and the little white flags that Michael has left on the rock, pierced through by twigs and thorns.\n\nThe wound on the forehead reminds me of Ash Wednesday, which marks the 40 days of Lent before Easter, and in the story of Hanging Rock we're at a time that would approximate this, considering that the book ends with the absolute downfall of Appleyard and the death of Mrs. Appleyard at Easter (I think in the book Easter falls on March 29th, and though the year is 1900, the closest year that fits with Valentine's and Easter is 1891). What is said as one is marked on the forehead with the ashes made of the palm fronds from the Good Friday of the previous year? \"Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.\"\n\nThough Appleyard's is a garden, Hanging Rock seems also a garden of its own that is intimately connected with it. The breakfast at Appleyard begins with a cherub/Cupid statuette being carried in, dedicated to St. Valentine. At Hanging Rock, Irma wears on her breast, above her heart, the pin of a cherub/Cupid holding an arrow. One wonders whether there is knowledge tasted at the rock that causes the fall of Appleyard--or there is instead here also a peculiar representation of the ouroboros, Appleyard at one end and Hanging Rock at the other, the magma extrusions forming their own ancient, formidable fence about the garden that is Hanging Rock on the far side of time from Appleyard.\n\nThe Problem of Irma\n\nThere is a big problem with Irma. She has been on this rock, in the profound heat of the Australian outback, for 8 days. It's one thing to survive without food for 8 days. It is pretty well impossible to survive without water in such an environment after three days. But with the exception of \"nothing more serious than shock and exposure\", Irma is unharmed but for some scratches, cuts and bruises. Irma's survival, actually, should be a bigger mystery than the disappearance of Miranda, Marion and McCraw. Irma has a viability problem. She should not be alive. Joan states in her book that a big clue, discounted, is her missing corset, though she was seen that morning with lightly-boned French stays.\n\nWhen the girls had cast their corsets off the rock and they had become frozen in time, hanging there, not falling, they were described as \"becalmed on the windless air like a fleet of little ships\". Corset etymologically derives from corpse, the body, but the \"stays\" of their corsets seem here to refer to \"stay\" as being held motionless in place, and also likened to the \"stay\" that is a rope that supports a ship's mast. Why does Joan say that when they ignore Irma's missing corset, her french \"stays\", that it is overlooking a significant clue? Perhaps because in the nautical sense there are clues and clue lines (or clews and clew-lines). \"Clue-lines\" are used to haul up a sail. This, as well as the idea of searching for important facts, derives from the \"clew\" that was Theseus' ball of thread in labyrinth. The clue or clew line also has a relationship to the triangle. In diagrams of triangular sails, the clew is the free angle of the sail opposite the mast.\n\nOne may wonder \"why sails, why are we being referred to sails\". But it is, after all, poems about ships in trouble that figure prominently at the beginning of the book, children bound to these wrecks literally or out of loyalty. Doomed to die. The four on Hanging Rock, however, free themselves of these sail-like corsets.\n\nIrma is found without her corset, yet clothed in her dress again. Corset, again, comes from \"corpse\", the corporeal. The officer who finds Irma, with Albert, must be convinced that she isn't dead. He refers to her as the \"corpse\" and the doctor assures him she is a \"living, breathing girl\". Joan seems to be expressing something about Irma that has enabled her to be found living, rather than dead, after 8 days on the rock. Like the corsets, it may be that Irma's body was stuck in time so, for her, it's as if she has been found shortly after she'd disappeared.\n\nDaphne and Apollo-Python\n\nWhile we're on the subject of metamorphosis, laurel is several times mentioned in the book, usually having to do with the laurel on which Michael stuck his flags during his search for those who had disappeared. The last mention of laurel stands out as a curious one, occurring after Irma has met Albert in person and thanked him for his role in rescuing her.\n\nIt was exactly three o'clock. There is no single instant on this spinning globe that is not, for millions of individuals, immeasurable by ordinary standards of time: a fragment of eternity forever unrelated to the calendar of the striking clock. For Albert Crundall, the brief conversation by the lake would inevitably be expanded, in memory, during his fairly long life, to fill the entire content of a summer afternoon...Now ten minutes later in the damp seclusion of the shrubbery he sank down on to the empty barrow and wiped the sweat from his hands and face. He had plenty of time in which to recover his mental and physical equilibrium, since he knew, with absolute certainty, that he would never speak to Irma Leopold again.\n\nAlbert had no sooner disappeared through a gap in the laurel hedge when, with the precise timing of three wooden figures on a Swiss clock, Mike came out of the house and Irma--there is always a little wooden lady--appeared at the boathouse door. She stood there, watching him hurry towards her, limping a little...\n\nLaurel, in Greek myth, concerns Apollo's pursuit of Daphne, whose name means laurel. After Apollo killed Python with his arrows, sighting Cupid with his own arrows he mocked him for using a man's weapons and told him to content himself with using his arrows for stirring love. So Cupid prepared two arrows that would have opposite effects. He wounded Apollo with one that would cause him to fall in love with Daphne. He struck Daphne instead with an arrow that would cause her to flee Apollo, but she was already dedicated to remaining a virgin.\n\nEven like this Phoebus loved her and, placing his hand against the trunk, he felt her heart still quivering under the new bark. He clasped the branches as if they were parts of human arms, and kissed the wood. But even the wood shrank from his kisses, and the god said 'Since you cannot be my bride, you must be my tree! Laurel, with you my hair will be wreathed, with you my lyre, with you my quiver. You will go with the Roman generals when joyful voices acclaim their triumph, and the Capitol witnesses their long processions. You will stand outside Augustus's doorposts, a faithful guardian, and keep watch over the crown of oak between them. And just as my head with its uncropped hair is always young, so you also will wear the beauty of undying leaves.'\n\nOvid's Metamorphoses interpreted by Kline\n\nSnakes (lizards/dragons) again. With the killing of Python, its oracular powers were assimilated into Apollo, though some say Python has become confused with Typhon, the female version, and that Python continued to be shown as guarding the Omphalos, the sacred navel-stone, mid-point of the earth, over which Apollo's temple was built.\n\nWe have the problem of two powers/gods being actually intimately connected rather than enemies, as so happens with Python and Apollo.\n\nApollo spoke through his oracle; she had to be an older woman of blameless life chosen from among the peasants of the area. She sat on a tripod seat over an opening in the earth (the \"chasm\"). When Apollo slew Python, its body fell into this fissure, according to legend, and fumes arose from its decomposing body. Intoxicated by the vapours, the sibyl would fall into a trance, allowing Apollo to possess her spirit. In this state she prophesied.\n\nWhile in a trance the Pythia \"raved\" -- probably a form of ecstatic speech -- and her ravings were \"translated\" by the priests of the temple into elegant hexameters. It has been speculated that a gas high in ethylene, known to produce violent trances, came out of this opening, though this theory remains debatable.Ancient sources describe \"laurel\", or sweet bay, being used by the priestess, in order to inspire her prophecies. A review of contemporary toxicological literature indicates that oleander causes symptoms similar to those of the Pythia, and a study of ancient texts shows that oleander was often included under the term \"laurel\". So it is likely that the Pythia used oleander prior to her oracular pronouncements, chewing its leaves and inhaling their smoke. The toxic substances of oleander resulted in symptoms similar to those of epilepsy, the \"sacred disease,\" which amounted to the possession of the Pythia by the spirit of Apollo, an event that made the Pythia his spokesperson, and subsequently, his prophetess. The oracle could not be consulted during the winter months, for this was traditionally the time when Apollo would live among the Hyperboreans. Dionysus would inhabit the temple during his absence.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nPython's coils should remind of the eternal recurrence when one considers his oracular powers. It knows the future because it is the property of those spirals. We find in this story a similarity to the knowing serpent of Genesis, already discussed, and the enmity between human and the serpent, so that the head of one is ever bruised by the heel of the other. Immediately after Genesis tells us of the enmity between the serpent and Eve, it gives the next part of the story of Eve's desire now being ever for her husband and he lording it over her, which is interpreted as an assertion of masculine dominance over the feminine as a punishment for Eve's temptation of Adam, but one may also see in this a circularity that pursues itself and never quite possesses itself.\n\nDaphne is modeled upon Artemis/Diana, the virgin goddess who is Apollo's twin. So one can see, in the story of Apollo's pursuit of Daphne, his longing ever after a part of him that flees him.\n\nAn interesting drawing of Apollo exists, done by Albrecht Durer, that I was recently studying. Apollo holds an orb of light and within it APOLO is written backwards, with only one L. Durer did several versions, based on the sculpture, the Apollo Belvedere, in which Apollo is depicted after having just slain Python, holding a bow in his left hand, the arrow just released. Rather than holding the bow, Durer places in Apollo's left hand the backwards APOLO orb of light, which gives some difficulty in that Apollo is light so how is it he is observing himself as light.\n\nApollo was first of all a god of light, a sun-god-without sun however, being the sun represented by a special divinity, Helios. From this arose his epithets: Phoebus, the \"brilliant\"; Xanthus, the \"fair\"; Chrysocomes, \"of the golden lock\"'; as such he delighted in \"high places, the frowning peaks of high mountains, wave-lapped, beetling promontories\". This god of the light was the son of Latona or Leto -- probably a double of the Asiatic Lada -- who was undoubtedly a divinity of the night.\n\nSource: https://www.labyrinthdesigners.org/alchemy-art/albrecht-durer-and-the-backwards-apollo/\n\nJoan certainly had Apollo in mind when crafting Michael, and I have shown previously how he can be peculiarly compared to the serpent of Genesis, or Python.\n\nTogether Michael and Irma had explored every inch of the Colonel's rose garden...the shrubberies whose winding walks ended in delicious little arbours, ideal for the playing of childish games--Halma and Snakes and Ladders...There is no need for conversation...Sometimes Irma finds herself chattering as she used to do long ago at school, for the sheer delight of tossing out words into the bright air...Unnecessary for Mike to answer, or even to listen, so long as he is there beside her, leaning over the rail with a lock of thick hair falling over one eye with every turn of his head, and aiming pebbles at the gaping mouth of the stone frog in the pool...At the landing stage the lilies were already closed and secret in half-light. A white swan was rising gracefully out of the reeds ahead. They stood for a moment watching it flapping away over the water until it disappeared amongst the willows on the opposite bank. It was like this that Irma would later remember Michael Fitzhubert most clearly. Quite suddenly he would come to her in the Bois de Boulogne, under the trees in Hyde Park; a lock of fair hair hanging over one eye, his face half turned to follow the flight of a swan.\n\nThe above follows directly after Irma's brush with Albert and Joan's mention of the ever-present \"wooden lady\". Mike and Irma have bonded and explored the garden. And then the seasons change. In the northern hemisphere, summer is approaching via spring. In the southern, winter approaches via autumn. Their days of going out in a little boat on the lake are over. Irma tells Mike that Miranda had said that everything began and ended at the right time and place. Mike, who appears to love Irma, will now suddenly reject her. And she will ever after remember him with that lock of fair hair, his face in half-light.\n\nWeir represents that half-light in Michael's fevered dream on the rock, as the corona of Edith's hat crosses over his face. It is when the crown perfectly divides his face, one half shining bright within the hat's circlet, the other half outside the crown and in shadow, that Michael starts awake and on his forehead appears (and stays) the wound that he shares with Irma. Coincidentally, his closed left hand in which he firmly grips his vest, is superimposed over the exposed palm of Edith's dirtied right hand so that they seem to meld together. Later, that vest disappears and instead Weir has Michael grasping a scrap of lace in it, presumably a remnant from one of the girl's dresses, but if we compare the scrap to the dresses of the girls it is impossible to say what the source is, none apparently matching, so perhaps from an undergarment.\n\nJoan's description of Mike is that of Apollo-Python. Apollo of the fair lock. A description of pursuit and times of quiescence, of co-existence, of Irma and Mike being together and understanding each other so implicitly he hardly needs to say anything. And then the seasons change. The equinox comes, a time of equal weights followed by a switch in dominance of light and dark, and Irma and Mike are separated, he reminded by Miranda, via Irma's reminiscence of her, that everything has its beginning and ending.\n\nWe can clearly see what has happened in Giovanni Antonio Bazzi's version of Apollo and Daphne. Having just shot Python, Apollo stands above Python curled at his feet. Still holding his bow in his left hand, Apollo faces right. In the upper right, Cupid has just appeared, holding his own bow but in his right hand, mirroring Apollo but he is in Cupid form as an infant (in some stories Apollo killed Python at the age of 4 days). Daphne also appears at the same time, fleeing Apollo as she runs to the right, the laurel between them. When Apollo shoots Python he is also shooting himself. We have Apollo the adult as the ending, and Cupid as the beginning, mirroring one another, Apollo having shot Python even as Cupid shoots Apollo so that Apollo's longing is for Daphne (Artemis) who ever flees him.\n\nJust as the description of Mike fits that of Apollo, Irma's fits that of Python, she repeatedly characterized by her dark ringlets, whereas Miranda has straight hair. When Irma is found, her dark ringlets are coated with dust and blood.\n\nIn the above drawing of Apollo and Diana, by Durer, Apollo prepares to draw his arrow in order to kill the python. Diana sits facing him, a stag resting on her lap.\n\nIn another of Duer's drawings of Apollo and Artemis/Diana, she is seated below him as he draws back his arrow to unleash it on python. Diana has turned from him and her head is now decorated with the stag horns.\n\nIn Durer's drawing of Apollo and Artemis/Diana in which he holds the APOLO orb, his twin, Artemis/Diana is seated below, turned from him, her head is unseen, seemingly obliterated by the light of the orb he holds in his left hand, the orb replacing the bow of Apollo Belvedere.\n\nThis may help explain why when Irma first sees the \"fair-haired\" Mike by the stream, she turns away and doesn't look at him again. This sounds like enmity, pushing away, yet she reveals that she did so because she recognized him as her beloved. Then in Mike's dreams, when he breaks off with her, when she invites him to sit next to her, he pushes her away with his umbrella, the umbrella being itself a symbol of their relationship.\n\nOn Spelling and Emeralds and the Demand to Forget\n\nIn the book, when Irma leaves Appleyard College, Mrs. Appleyard scolds her for going out into the world too soon with too little education, for if Irma leaves then Appleyard will have lost a pupil off which she has made great financial profit, and there also exits from the school the allure of Irma's privilege which was a draw for others. But Mrs. Appleyard is no longer faced with a \"student\" in Irma. Irma doesn't bend to her will, and all that Mrs. Appleyard can think to do is challenge Irma on her spelling. A person of her station should know better how to spell. Rather than being humiliated, Irma retorts that spelling ability would not have saved her at Hanging Rock and anything of benefit she learned at Appleyard was from Miranda.\n\nThere are letters written by the characters that are duplicated in the book (in fact, Albert, who helped save Irma, has three letters of his given in the book that show he is unable to spell at all) and it occurred to me that Mrs. Appleyard's challenge to Irma on her spelling meant that we should look at Irma's one transcribed letter that was to Mademoiselle Poitiers. She is readying to leave Australia and will be staying at the Menzies Hotel while she waits the arrival of her parents from India. After talking about how she will be visiting the school she writes, \"Dianne I haven't had a chance to buy your wedding present--Manassa's Store has nothing but boots and jam darling and tin billy cans--so please accept my emmerald bracelet with my love--the one my Grandmother in Brazil gave me the one I told you about with the green parrot--remember? anyway now dead so she won't know or mind. Mrs. C. wants to know about the blue chiffon you used to like I must go.\"\n\nIrma has misspelled emerald. Is our attention being specifically called to the word \"emerald\"? Curious as it may seem, \"emerald\" derives from the Semitic baraq, shine, which can be compared with the Hebrew word for emerald, bareqeth, and the Arabic barq, \"lightning\". From there I turn to Al-Buraq (the same as that \"lightning\"), the steed upon which Muhammed took his journey through the heavenly spheres all on one night.\n\nDon't shake your head in derision just yet, this is leading somewhere.\n\nFrom D'Ohsson's Tableau General de l'Empire Othoman:\n\nIn the seventeenth sura of the Koran it is written that upon a certain night Mohammed was transported from the temple at Mecca to that of Jerusalem, but no details are given of the strange journey. In the Mishkateu 'l-Masabih, Mohammed is made to describe his ascent through the seven heavens into the icy presence of the may-veiled God and his subsequent return to his own bed, all in a single night. Mohammed was awakened in the night by the Angel Gabriel, who, after removing the Prophet's heart, washed the cavity with Zamzam water, and filled the heart itself with faith and science. A strange creature, called Alborak, or the lightning bolt, was brought for the conveyance of the Prophet. Alborak is described as white animal of the shape and size of a mule, with the head of a woman and the tail of a peacock. According to some versions, Mohammed merely rode Alborak to Jerusalem, where, dismounting upon Mount Moriah, he caught hold of the lower rung of a golden ladder lowered from heaven and, accompanied by Gabriel, ascended through the seven spheres separating he earth from the inner surface of the empyrean. At the gate of each sphere stood me of the Patriarchs, whom Mohammed saluted as he entered the various planes. At the gate of the first heaven stood Adam; at the gate of the second, John and Jesus (sisters' sons); at the third, Joseph; at the fourth, Enoch; at the fifth, Aaron; at the sixth, Moses; and at the seventh, Abraham. Another order of the Patriarchs and prophets is given which places Jesus at the gate of the seventh heaven, and upon reaching this Point Mohammed is said to have requested Jesus to intercede for him before the throne of God.\n\nWe see in the illustration above the Kaaba (cube) in which is housed the sacred Black Stone, a meteorite. Al-Buraq, frequently visualized as having the bust of a woman, flies above.\n\nAfter Michael fails to meet Irma for lunch at his uncle's, after the terrible storm that ensues, one of the worst of the area, with attendant zigzags of lightning, after Irma reads Michael's chilly letter stating he has been called away by his banker, we have this in Picnic at Hanging Rock:\n\nAlthough we are necessarily concerned, in a chronicle of events, with physical action by the light of day, history suggests that the human spirit wanders farthest in the silent hours between midnight and dawn. Those dark fruitful hours, seldom recorded, whose secret flowerings breed peace and war, loves and hates, the crowning or uncrowning of heads. What, for instance, is the plump little Empress of India planning in bed in a flannel nightgown at Balmoral, on this night in March in the year nineteen hundred, that makes her smile and purse her small obstinate mouth? Who knows?\n\nWhen Michael rises the following morning he has spent the night dreaming of banks and packing.\n\nAre we to pay attention to \"emmerald\" and think of Mohammed's night flight? What of Manassa? The town's store which hasn't much in the way of a stock of goods.\n\nManasseh means \"causing to forget\", coming from the Hebrew nashah, also \"to forget\". Another nashah, identical to it (in the sense of nasha, lending on interest, identical with nasha, to lead estray, delude, seduce) is to lend or borrow on security or interest.\n\nAs it turns out, Manasseh and the Night Journey through the Seven Spheres are connected. First there was Manasseh, son of Joseph, whose \"forgetfulness\" was in the positive sense of God causing Joseph to forget his troubles. But then there's Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, who I have already brought up in the section on the attack on Irma, for it is by way of Manasseh and his said sacrifice of children (of innocents) that the hell of Gehenna came to be. The place was also called toph as \"the cries of children being sacrificed by the priests of Moloch [and Baal] were masked by the sound of the beating on drums or tamborines, or from taph or toph meaning to burn.\" (Wikipedia).\n\nAs Marion and the others stood, in the heat, upon the frozen lava of the rock, looking down upon the plain below, the book gives them as seeing the following: \"The plain below was just visible; infinitely vague and distant. Peering down between the boulders Irma could see the glint of water and tiny figures coming and going through the drifts of rosy smoke, or mist...The ants and their business were dismissed without further comment. Although Irma was aware, for a little while, of a curious sound coming up from the plain, like the beating of far-off drums.\"\n\nIt seems to me, again, that Joan was interested in bringing Manasseh into the story. There is no reason for the girls to be seeing fires (Hussey had a small one), or to be hearing drums, unless we consider more glitches in time so that they are viewing and hearing people search for them. Hussey's account of the search that night states, \"As it grew later and darker--we had no means of knowing the time except by the sinking sun--we lit a number of fires along the creek in such a way that they could be seen from various angles by anyone in this side of the Rock. We also kept on cooeing as loudly as we could singly and all together. I got the two billies and beat on them with the crowbar I always keep in the drag for emergencies.\"\n\nOff in their own time frame (Edith still with them though the fires and drums occur in the evening), the girls from their place on the mount only vaguely wonder what is happening below then dismiss it. They turn and see the monolith.\n\nThough we have the fires and drums situated in a rational time-line of the story, that time-line disintegrates on the mount. And the account of the concerned seeking the lost girls doesn't dismiss Joan also alluding to Manasseh.\n\nOld Testament Peseudodepigrpha (from the Babylonian and Jerusalem talmuds) covers the reign of Manasseh, son of Hezekiah, during which the prophet Isaiah was persecuted. Manasseh forgets the commandments of his father, Hezekiah, and eventualy executes Isaiah, who had had a vision in which he was taken up through the Seven Heavens. The account is long and I won't go into it here or the prophesies of Isaiah which were interpreted one way by Jews and another way by Christians. What's significant to me is that Joan has positioned the mention of the emerald in proximity of Manassa, and the storm with its lightning in proximity of night journeys and a \"Bal\", thus having a convergence of Manasseh and a prophet's night journey through the Seven Heavens (as with Mohammed on Al-Buraq). The Empress of India is actually Queen Victoria and Balmoral her Scottish home, so that Joan is again suggesting Anglo Victorians as sacrificers of their children to \"Bal\", which isn't surprising considering my earlier discussion on the poems Joan chooses to open her book with, each having children sacrificed to country and by the hubris of their parents. In the case of the boy who doesn't leave the burning deck, his loyalty and love also cause his sacrifice.\n\n\"Doomed to die, of course! Like that boy who stood on the burning deck, whence all but he had fled, tra...la la...I forget the rest of it,\" Irma had said on the rock, speaking of Sara, but which had caused Edith to ask if she was doomed as well.\n\nIf the book had been written in 1900, it would be a critique of Victorian society alone, and it is a critique of Victorian society, but Joan was writing in 1966, and so she likely had in mind a critique of contemporary society.\n\nTo pull the knot more tightly together, we should remember that McCraw, clasping her Al-Gebra book (she had hoped to do a lesson on Algebra with Marion at Hanging Rock) had remarked, \"The mountain comes to Mahommed, Hanging Rock comes to Mr. Hussey.\" Algebra is Arabic al and jabr, which means the reunion of broken parts. The mathematical sense is \"the science of restoring what is missing and equating like with like\", just as McCraw makes a like with like comparsion between Hussey's wagon and the girls and Hanging Rock, and Mohammed and his mountain. Mohammed's \"mountain\" refers to his Night Journey through the Seven Heavens (or Seven Heavenly Spheres). On their way to Hanging Rock, McCraw is given as listening to the Music of the Spheres, an ancient, and Pythagorean concept, on the harmony of the celestial bodies (or seven spheres).\n\nFor convenience, from Manly P. Hall's The Secret Teachings of All Ages:\n\nPythagoras conceived the universe to be an immense monochord, with its single string connected at its upper end to absolute spirit and at its lower end to absolute matter--in other words, a cord stretched between heaven and earth. Counting inward from the circumference of the heavens, Pythagoras, according to some authorities, divided the universe into nine parts; according to others, into twelve parts. The twelvefold system was as follows: The first division was called the empyrean, or the sphere of the fixed stars, and was the dwelling place of the immortals. The second to twelfth divisions were (in order) the spheres of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the sun, Venus, Mercury, and the moon, and fire, air, water, and earth. This arrangement of the seven planets (the sun and moon being regarded as planets in the old astronomy) is identical with the candlestick symbolism of the Jews--the sun in the center as the main stem with three planets on either side of it.\n\nThe names given by the Pythagoreans to the various notes of the diatonic scale were, according to Macrobius, derived from an estimation of the velocity and magnitude of the planetary bodies. Each of these gigantic spheres as it rushed endlessly through space was believed to sound a certain tone caused by its continuous displacement of the Ã¦thereal diffusion. As these tones were a manifestation of divine order and motion, it must necessarily follow that they partook of the harmony of their own source. \"The assertion that the planets in their revolutions round the earth uttered certain sounds differing according to their respective 'magnitude, celerity and local distance,' was commonly made by the Greeks. Thus Saturn, the farthest planet, was said to give the gravest note, while the Moon, which is the nearest, gave the sharpest. 'These sounds of the seven planets, and the sphere of the fixed stars, together with that above us [Antichthon], are the nine Muses, and their joint symphony is called Mnemosyne.'\" (See The Canon.)This quotation contains an obscure reference to the ninefold division of the universe previously mentioned.\n\nThe Greek initiates also recognized a fundamental relationship between the individual heavens or spheres of the seven planets, and the seven sacred vowels. The first heaven uttered the sound of the sacred vowel Α (Alpha); the second heaven, the sacred vowel Ε (Epsilon); the third, Η (Eta); the fourth, Ι (Iota); the fifth, Ο (Omicron); the sixth, Υ (Upsilon); and the seventh heaven, the sacred vowel Ω (Omega). When these seven heavens sing together they produce a perfect harmony which ascends as an everlasting praise to the throne of the Creator. (See Irenæus' Against Heresies.) Although not so stated, it is probable that the planetary heavens are to be considered as ascending in the Pythagorean order, beginning with the sphere of the moon, which would be the first heaven.\n\nForgetting is a strong theme in the book. In the film, yes, we have the problem of Edith forgetting what happened on the rock, of Michael forgetting portions, of Irma forgetting completely what had happened on the rock. The doctor encourages Irma to forget about everything and move on, which is one thing. Albert encourages Michael to forget about everything and move on before Michael convinces Albert to help him search the rock--but Michael's passion, stating that he will never forget, ends up convincing Albert. There are many things in the book that are forgotten. But we also, very quickly, have people encouraging that all forget what has happened, which is odd considering three people have disappeared. The art teacher who wants to take in Sara says, \"You can't think what horrible things people are saying about all this in the city, though I tell everyone it's best forgotten.\" And what happens? The note that she gives Tom which would let Sara know she could come live with her ends up being forgotten and crammed to the back of a drawer.\n\nOn the morning that Mike leaves, having had the call from his bank, we have, \"At Manassa's store an occasional customer calling in for the morning paper enquired with flagging interest. ' Anything more about the College Mystery?' There wasn't--at least nothing that could be remotely classed as news on Manassa's verandah. It was generally conceded by the locals that the goings-on at the Rock were over and done with and best forgotten.\"\n\nSo soon to forget.\n\nANAMNESIS--remembrance, the rediscovery of previously possessed knowledge--a philosophical epistemological theory that interprets human knowledge exclusively as a process of remembrance, of making present to oneself that which is necessary (ideas).\n\nIn European philosophy there are three conceptions of anamnesis. Plato was the author of the first, mainly in his dialogues Meno (81b-d; 85 d-86 b), Phaedo (72c-76 d), and Phaedrus (249 c). The Platonic theory of anamnesis was influenced by Orphism and Pythagoreanism and presupposed a belief in the transmigration of souls and the theory of the pre-existence of the soul. According to the theory of anamnesis, man discovers in his memory knowledge acquired during previous incarnations of his soul. The immortal soul knows the truth about universal ideas and values whose objects cannot be material concrete beings. Sense perception of the visible world is only an occasion to recall knowledge the soul already possesses. This interpretation of human knowledge for the first time took up the problem of a priori knowledge, but explained it in a different way than Kantianism or neo-Kantianism. The Platonic theory of anamnesis was taken upon by neo-Platonists, including Plotinus and Porphyry, and Christian thinkers such as Bishop Nemesius of Edessa and Boethius.\n\nSt. Augustine had a different interpretation of anamnesis than did Plato. As a Christian, St. Augustine rejected the theory of the pre-existence of the soul (De lib. arbit., 3, 20, 57; Sol., 2, 19, 35; De Trin., 12, 15, 24; Epist., 7, 1-2). He thought that the object of anamnesis was not ideas known in the past but eternal truths independent of the conditions of space and time. Man knows these eternal truths by divine illumination which helps the natural abilities of his cognitive powers. In this interpretation, anamnesis is connected with the theory of illumination and moderate epistemological apriorism which prefers introspection with respect to knowledge of God and of the human soul.\n\nAnother form of anamnesis is the theory of nativism. Descartes and Leibniz held this theory. They thought that when God created man, he endowed man with knowledge of basic religious, philosophical, and moral truths.\n\nG.

The garden of Appleyard has its own gate and then much is made of Miranda opening the gate at Hanging Rock. While the students are at Hanging Rock, the white turkeys back at Appleyard appear to mimic them (which is a Weir touch). Appleyard at one end and Hanging Rock at the other, the magma extrusions forming their own ancient, formidable fence about the garden that is Hanging Rock on the far side of time from Appleyard.\n\nWeir several times focuses on the stairs (especially exterior) at Appleyard as if forging a parallel to the ascent at Hanging Rock.\n\nAs the schoolgirls leave for Hanging Rock, Weir has Sara at the height of Appleyard College looking down upon Miranda and Miranda gazing back up at her. A parallel seems to be made with the high places of Hanging Rock.\n\nMike leaves his little white \"flags\" all up Hanging Rock, like a clew tracing where he has been, and there are flags all over the College, hanging from a flag pole outside, descending here and there from portraits of Queen Victoria.\n\nWeir gives us a visual towards the beginning of the film that may have a correspondance with these rectangular flags Mike leaves on the rock, which become part of a pattern for Albert.\n\nMarion takes a flower she has been given and places it in a press between two blotting papers. The pressing of the flower and its preservation of the moment can be perhaps taken as a metaphor for the eternal moment. The act of pressing the flower between the blotter papers, the \"pincer\" of the compass alongside, seems even to be a glyph for McCraw's transition at the hole in the 18th chapter.\n\nThe raddled face was radiant...the long-boned torso was flattening itself out on the ground beside the hole, deliberately forming itself to the needs of a creature created to creep and burrow under the earth. The thin arms, crossed behind the head with its bright staring eyes, became the pincers of a giant crab that inhabits mud-caked billabongs. Slowly the body dragged itself inch by inch through the hole...\n\nWe also find in the compass the needle that corresponds to the thorns and branch tips that puncture Mike's papers through.\n\nAnother visual is the triangle in the window seen just before Marion presses the flower.\n\nOne may be reminded of McCraw's crossing of her thin arms behind her head so that they resemble the pincers of a crab.\n\nA particularly interesting triangle at the college, which I've held off on mentioning until now, is one in Mrs. Appleyard's study. It is the frame of a mirror.\n\nWe first see it in the study while Mrs. Appleyard anxiously awaits the return of the girls from the rock.\n\nAfter Irma is found, a painting from now on appears beneath the triangular mirror. It hadn't been there before.\n\nRecollect that it is after Michael's ordeal on the rock and his finding Irma that the portrait of Lord Byron changes so that it shows a mark on the forehead. So, too, does this mirror change then so that it has the painting beneath it.\n\nThe same painting also appears at the Fitzhubert home. We see it as the officer and doctor ascend the steps to examine Irma.\n\nWhether the painting was always there at the Fitzhubert home, or appears at the same time it does at Appleyard, we don't know. Colonel Fitzhubert stands on the case with two identical dogs, which is as if to signal to us that we have twins, that there are two paintings, one here and one at Appleyard college.\n\nThe painting is Sir Frederic Leighton's 1895 \"Flaming June\". A woman in orange sleeps in a fetal position in the June heat. We see oleander above her. In the ancient world oleander was used interchangeably with laurel, the bushes upon which Michael stuck his flags in the book. As I've discussed earlier, that laurel, I believe, connects with the story of Daphne and Apollo, so the oleander of \"Flaming June\", at least in its use in the film, may refer to that laurel and to the laurel/oleander used by the oracular Pythian priestesses, though their trances were also said to be induced by the decaying body of Python, the tripod seat of the priestess set on a fissure out of which supposedly arose the fumes of the decaying Python, it having fallen into that fissure when slain by Apollo.\n\nBoth the painting at the Fitzhubert home and the one at the college are cropped down from the original, and this also adds to the confusion, in that they are both cropped down.\n\nBelow the painting at the Fitzhubert home there is an image of a great log being sawn in half. One could go for the colloquial \"sawing logs\" and that it too refers to sleep. And the painting at the college rests above a couch/sofa upon which one may sleep.\n\nBut we already have much"
