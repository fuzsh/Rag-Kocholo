So much mud, even for a World War One movie. A near-Sokurov level of mud.

Best things about Forest of the Hanged:

1. Young Victor Rebengiuc, with whom it is remarkably easy to fall in love.

2. Everything about the Austro-Hungarian mission to destroy the bright French projector that has somehow ended up in the hands of the Romanian army, who are using it to silently and non-violently harass the Austro-Hungarians at night.

3. The aforementioned mud.

4. The increasingly untenable situation of Lt. Apostol Bologa (Rebengiuc), a Romanian fighting in the Austro-Hungarian army against Romania, under a (cartoonishly?) malicious general who interprets the words "moral impossibility" as a clear indicator of contemptible pacifism.

It's a very specific story, even local compared to most of the universally acclaimed films about the same conflict. However, it's obvious pretty early on that this should be on every list of the best depictions of World War One.
