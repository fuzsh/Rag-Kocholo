        "text": "Ben Affleck reportedly wants to play Hulk Hogan in a movie titled Killing Gawker, based on the former wrestler’s Gawker lawsuit.\n\nThe film will be based on Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker, which published a leaked sex tape of the former WWE wrestler in 2012, leading to a $115 million lawsuit backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. Hogan won that case, which ultimately resulted in the media outlet’s demise.\n\nAccording to PWInsider, the movie is “expected to move forward in the days ahead” with both Affleck and Matt Damon behind it.\n\nIf the rumors are true, the two actors would pick up the project via their Artist Equity production company with a plan to release the film in January 2025. Damon would star as Thiel in the film.\n\nKilling Gawker was written by Charles Randolph, who won a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for The Big Short. The screenplay is based on Ryan Holiday’s 2018 book Conspiracy: A True Story of Power, Sex, and a Billionaire’s Secret Plot to Destroy a Media Empire. That book chronicled Thiel’s vendetta against Gawker for outing him as gay, providing context for why Thiel was willing to back the suit.\n\nThis isn’t the first Hulk Hogan biopic rumor to circulate in Hollywood. Recently, Chris Hemsworth acknowledged talks with Netflix regarding a movie helmed by Joker director Todd Phillips, but said he couldn’t confirm whether “it’s officially happening yet.”\n\nAs for Damon and Affleck, their latest Artist Equity film The Instigators starring Damon and Casey Affleck, is currently in theaters. It will be available to stream on Apple TV+ starting August 9th. You can watch the trailer below.\n\nMeanwhile, Hogan recently spoke on the final night of the Republican National Convention, ripping his shirt off to reveal a Trump-Vance 2024 tank top."
