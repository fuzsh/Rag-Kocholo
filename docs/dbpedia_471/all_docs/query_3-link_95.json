        "text": "The first topic I will be talking about on my Butlers Chocolate essay is one of the most popular art movements in the design industry which is, Pop Art.\n\n-What is Pop Art?\n\nPop art is an art movement that got hugely famous during the 1950s and late 50s in the United States. Eduardo Paolozzi and Richard Hamilton where the first growing pop artist in Britain, and Robert Rauschenber & Jasper John in the United States. Pop art rose up in popular culture such as advertising and news. Pop art showed up in a lot of mass culture or media, such as advertising, comic books etc. Pop art uses the popular elements of any culture mostly irony. Minimalism is common in pop art and it is similar to Dada using different styles. Pop art and minimalism are considered to be art movements that precede postmodern art. Pop art often takes imagery that is currently in use in advertising. Product labeling and logos figure prominently in the imagery chosen by pop artists, seen in the labels of Campbell’s Soup Cans, by Andy Warhol.\n\nPop art in britain rose from withing the Independent Group. Independent Group is an informal circle of artists inclusing painter Richard Hamilton, art critic Lawrence Alloway, and sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi who would always meet up at the Institite of Contemporary Arts in London. 1952 was the first meeting when Paolozzi presented his collages from magazines and other objects, including his famous ”Iwas a Rich Man’s Plaything” which he made 5 years before hand in 1947. The Independent Group discussed the artistic value of popular mass culture. Richard Hamilton’s collage “Just what is it that makes today’s homes so appealing?” was produced in the group. Richard Hamilton & Paolozzi’s collage is regarded Britains earliest Pop-Art art. In 1961 there where works produced by Derek Boshier, David Hockney, Allen Jones, RB Kitaj and Peter Phillips in the Young Contemporaries Exhibition.\n\nalthough pop are began in the late 1950s, Pop art in the United States was officially introduced in December 1962. the occasion was a “Symposium on Pop Art” organized by the Museum of Modern Art. Pop art as we mentioned was popular with mass culture in other regions, American artists dug into the dramatic styles which was a complete change from the designed media materials. Drama style art was produced like romantic, sentimental and humorous overtones where to be seen everywhere in America at this time. Also at this time British artists in the Pop-Art culture where not exactly falling behind, but American pop-art culture was producing a lot more modern day art which the Americans where ahead with the movement. Roy Lichtenstein is one of the most famous artist in the american pop-Art culture who’s work was a lot of dramatic and action designs.\n\nhttp://www.theartstory.org/movement-pop-art.htm\n\n-Roy Lichtenstein\n\nhttps://www.google.ie/search?q=roy+lichtenstein&biw=1136&bih=676&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwiG6ZSl97PMAhVBBsAKHelGDh0Q_AUIBigB#imgrc=Kzy6y4LizSjfPM%3A\n\nRoy Lichtenstein was born October 27th 1923. Roy became a huge leading figure in pop-art movement along with other artists such as Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, and James Rosenquest. He showed his art through parody as comic strip was his biggest inspiration. Roy Lichtenstein described Pop-ARt as ”not ‘American’ painting but actually industrial painting” His paintings were exhibited at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York City.\n\nLichtenstein’s career started when he left New York to study at Ohio State University that also offered studio courses and a degree in fine arts. He was interrupted from his work by made to join the army during and after World war 2 between 2943 and 1946. Roy returned after three years of training in the army and continued to study in Ohio thought by Hoyt L. Sherman. Lichenstein was hired as an art instructor for the next ten years, and got a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Ohio State University. In 1961 Lichenstein began his first pop art paintings using cartoon images and techniques, which continued through to 1965. in 1961 Leo Castelli had Lichensteins work displayed at his gallery back home in New York. his entire painting collection was bought collector before the show had even started.\n\nLichenstin moved back to New York to concentrate on his painting, the most famous painting of Lichensteins career, The Drowning Girl, which now hangs in the Museum of modern Art in New York. The Drowning Girl is the lead story in DC Comics’ Secret Hearts #83. This art work is one of my favourite pieces from pop-art. What makes it stand out more than other is the thick outlines, bold colors and the dotted pattern named Ben Day Dots. Lichtenstein said the Abstract Expressionists “put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don’t come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock’s or Kline’s.”\n\nThe Drowning Girl\n\nhttps://www.google.ie/search?q=roy+lichtenstein&biw=1136&bih=676&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwiG6ZSl97PMAhVBBsAKHelGDh0Q_AUIBigB#imgrc=hWARi2SW-pEL7M%3A\n\nLichensteins produced many projects in pop-art style saying it was ”different” from comic strips. Lichenstein would get criticized of the work he put out because he would often take original pieces of art and ‘transform’ them into his own style of design. Magazines like ‘Life’ made an article saying ”is he the worst artist in the U.S.?” which he responded “The closer my work is to the original, the more threatening and critical the content. However, my work is entirely transformed in that my purpose and perception are entirely different. I think my paintings are critically transformed, but it would be difficult to prove it by any rational line of argument.”\n\nOne of Lichenstein’s most famous and celebrated image is Whaam! adapted from a comic-book panel drawn by Irv Novick in a 1962 issue of DC Comics’ All-American Men of War. Once again Lichenstein is using the original comic book design and transforming it into his on design style, which he got criticized for. His Best known works are close, but not exact copies of comic books. He stopped transforming comic book designs to his own work in 1965. Lichenstein once stated about his ‘copying’ of comic books. He said “I am nominally copying, but I am really restating the copied thing in other terms. In doing that, the original acquires a totally different texture. It isn’t thick or thin brushstrokes, it’s dots and flat colours and unyielding lines.” Eddie Campbell has his thought on it aswell, “Lichtenstein took a tiny picture, smaller than the palm of the hand, printed in four color inks on newsprint and blew it up to the conventional size at which ‘art’ is made and exhibited and finished it in paint on canvas.” Which most people would also agree on in my opinion.\n\n-http://lichtensteinfoundation.org/biography/\n\n-Butler’s chocolate project\n\nFor my Butler’s chocolate project I chose Pop art movement style for my packaging. I thought that pop art was the closest art movement to the style of my designs I produce. Pop art is hugely bright in colours which is the main reason it is an eye catching style, and with it’s thick black outlines which bring a more solid look to anything, and more clean look also instead of mixing and washing colours on your design.\n\nThis is the first illustration I made. Using pencil and tracing over with marker. Since the first time I seen pop art, whether it was advertising on bill boards, posters or online. I would always see lips. Like 4 colour squared lip poster, or Like Roy Lichtenstein’s illustrations but up close to their lips.\n\nAfter I traced over my illustration I brought it into illustrator, using bright colours and the thick black lines like Roy Lichtenstein’s work or pop art in general I created this:\n\nAfter I completed the main illustration for the front of the Butlers chocolate design I started to make the package design for a 100g bar. I used a nice bright blue colour with dotted pattern at the background giving it a pop art feel.\n\nAfter created a chocolate package design we had to create any box with your design:\n\nWe layed out our final design and took photos of them together:\n\nReferencing\n\nArticle Title: Roy Lichtenstein Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nURL: http://www.biography.com/people/roy-lichtenstein-9381678\n\nPublisher: A&E Television Networks\n\nArticle Title: Pop Art Movement\n\nAuthor: Andy Warhol\n\nWebsite Name: TheArtStory\n\nURL: http://www.theartstory.org/movement-pop-art.htm\n\nArticle Title: Pop Art\n\nAuthor: UnKnown\n\nWebsite Name: Tate\n\nURL: http://www.theartstory.org/movement-pop-art.htm"
