        "text": "Widely interpreted as a reaction to abstract expressionism, Pop art emerged in the mid-1950s in Britain (and the late 1950s in the United States) as a challenge to traditions of elitist imagery in fine art. Drawing on items from popular culture such as advertising, comic books, newspapers and magazines, the material used by Pop artists was often isolated from its original context and juxtaposed with unrelated imagery. Among the early artists that shaped the movement were Eduardo Paolozzi and Richard Hamilton in Britain, and Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns in the United States (above: Johns, Target, 1959).\n\nWhile emphasizing the banality of popular culture – often through the use of irony – Pop art also tended to focus on the mechanical means of reproduction or the rendering techniques of its own creation. Furthermore, its utilization of found objects and images was similar to Dadaism. In its turn, Pop art prefigured (and provide many early examples of) postmodern art. Product labeling and logos figure prominently, such as the labels of Campbell’s Soup Cans, by Andy Warhol or his Campbell’s Tomato Juice Box, 1964 (above).\n\nAnticipated to some extent by the likes of Alex Katz and Man Ray, pop art in the United States marked a return to representational art. In contrast to America, post-War British pop artists were more academic in their reaction to the encroaching imagery of American consumerism, which they saw as a powerful, manipulative force. In many ways Pop art was both an extension and a repudiation of Dadaism. The Independent Group (IG), founded in London in 1952, is regarded as the precursor to the pop art movement. In I was a Rich Man’s Plaything (right, 1947), Eduardo Paolozzi (1924 – 2005) was perhaps the first to use the word pop in an artwork.\n\nHeavily influenced by Paolozzi, Richard Hamilton (1922 – 2011) produced perhaps the first work of pop art to achieve iconic status. Just what is it that makes today’s homes so different, so appealing? (left) is a collage, created in 1956 for the catalogue of the exhibition This Is Tomorrow in London. In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit. In 1961 the Royal Society of British Artists (RBA) exhibition of young talent put David Hockney, the American R B Kitaj, New Zealander Billy Apple, Derek Boshier, Joe Tilson, Patrick Caulfield and Peter Blake on the map.The latter’s most famous work is the cover design for Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967).\n\nArtists such as Andy Warhol and David Hockney (right: Warhol’s portrait of Hockney) often created colourful images of everyday objects. They employing simple techniques (such as the silk screen process) to create their artwork in contrast to the techniques used by established artists. This meant their work could be reproduced / printed very easily.\n\nAllen Jones (b. 1937) was expelled from the Royal College in 1961 but was included in the Young Contemporaries 1961 exhibit. Inspired by Warhol, Lichtenstein, Peter Phillips (b.1939) and Claes Oldenburg, and influenced by writers such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, and Carl Jung, Jones turned to using non-fine art sources in search of a new language – a “low culture” palette of pop styles along with advertising, comic strips, catalogues and girlie magazines. By the late 1960s Jones was noticing that “skirts were shorter, the body was being displayed in some new way. And you knew that the following week somebody would up the ante… I was reflecting on and commenting on exactly the same situation that was the source of the feminist movement. It was unfortunate for me that I produced the perfect image for them to show how women were being objectified.\n\nIn Hatstand, Table and Chair (1969) Jones’ intention was to ruffle the sensibilities of the art world – but he did not anticipate how much his work would ruffle the sensibilities of the real world just as strongly for some time to come. “I wanted the figures to be a presence you had to reckon with, as you would be when confronting a real person.” To prevent them looking like window mannequins, he thought he would give them functions, then realized that whatever clothes he put on them would inevitably date the work. He chose bondage gear, since he felt that would be less susceptible to the tides of fashion.\n\nOp art (aka optical art) was a major development of the 1960s that used geometric forms to create optical effects. Time Magazine coined the term op art in 1964 in an article on Julian Stanczak’s show Optical Paintings at the Martha Jackson Gallery, but works now described as “op art” date back to several years before Time’s 1964 article.\n\nRanging from the subtle to the disturbing and even disorientating, its aesthetic drew the physiology and psychology of perception and also on colour theory. Its pioneers included French artsist Victor Vasarely (1908-1997), who had been experimenting with constructive-geometric abstraction since the late 1940s, and Venezuelan-born Jesus Rafael Soto (1923-2005), who’s work often involved mobile elements – pointing to a connection between kinetic and op art. These figures were joined by London-born Bridget Riley, (b. 1931), who had begun painting in a semi-impressionist manner and changed to pointillist landscapes around 1958 before experimenting with dynamic optical phenomena in 1960. Her new works produced a disorientating physical effect on the eye, such as Fall, 1963 (below), which can be seen in the Tate Gallery.\n\nIn its geometric abstraction and in the clarity and simplicity of much early op art pieces, an unintended calmness – an evasion of emotion that opposed abstract expressionism – merged with minimalist principles. But op art also related to colour field painting and received enormous attention in the 1965 Responsive Eye exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. This focused on the perceptual aspects of art, both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships. The exhibition was enormously popular with the general public, though less so with the critics who dismissed it as nothing more than trompe-l’œil, or tricks of the eye. But the exhibition gave Op Art and artists major recognition at a time when youth culture was gaining momentum.\n\nSuddenly Op Art patterns started appearing on everything from clothes to advertisements, stationery and furnishing fabrics (right: Barbara Brown‘s ‘Expansion’ fabric for Heal’s). Mod bands such as The Who (below) and textile companies like Heal’s led the way in popularising Op Art prints for furnishing fabrics – though usually the colours and patterns were more muted than the eye straining patterns used for clothing.\n\nHaving retreated into the arenas of fashion, design and adveretising, Op Art has perhaps been relegated to something of a fad in the art world, though its influence can still be seen in the work of the German born Turner Prize winner, Tomma Abts, in 2006; in the so-called Camouflage Art of French photographer Jean-Paul Bourdier and the work of Chinese artists Liu Bolin (below left).\n\nAnd yet their is something in op art that harks back to abstraction and to early theories of colour, nature and camouflage."
