Pop artists would take images and ideas that were a part of culture (such as advertisements and movie stars) and place it in a context. Pop art paintings would often be humorous, and irony was a key element of the style. This list features artists like Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, and more!\n\nThis list answers the questions, \"Who are the most famous Pop art artists?\" and \"Who are the best Pop art artists?\"\n\nAlmost every well-known or influential figure in this movement is listed below.

He rose from humble beginnings to become a defining persona in the contemporary art world. His parents were working-class immigrants from Slovakia, and he showed an early interest in art, studying commercial art at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh. With his unique perspective on the intersection of art, celebrity, and business, Warhol's work became iconic for its boldness, simplicity, and exploration of consumer culture. After graduating, Warhol moved to New York City to pursue a career in commercial illustration, where his signature drawing style quickly garnered recognition amongst advertising agencies. However, it was during the 1960s that he pioneered the groundbreaking pop art movement, taking inspiration from popular culture and creating works based on familiar subjects such as Campbell's Soup Cans or Marilyn Monroe. These pieces not only propelled Warhol into stardom but also sparked controversy and critical debates about the nature of art itself. Warhol's impact reached beyond painting and printmaking. He ventured into various other forms of media, including film, photography, and music. In 1964, he established \"The Factory,\" a studio where he and his collaborators made art and films, attracting a diverse crowd of bohemians, intellectuals, and celebrities. It was here that Warhol fostered an environment of creativity and eccentricity, shaping the culture of the era. He also managed the rock band The Velvet Underground, further demonstrating his influence on popular culture. Warhol died in New York City on February 22, 1987, leaving behind a vast body of work that continues to inspire and provoke to this day.\n\nArtworks : Campbell's Soup Cans, Marilyn Monroe, Diana Vreeland, Truman Capote and Liza Minelli, A Set of Six Self-Portraits\n\nBirthplace : Pittsburgh, USA, Pennsylvania\n\nAssociated periods or movements : Pop art\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nArt Forms : Photography, Painting, Printmaking\n\n1,005 votes\n\n2\n\n780 VOTES\n\nRoy Fox Lichtenstein (; October 27, 1923 – September 29, 1997) was an American pop artist. During the 1960s, along with Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, and James Rosenquist among others, he became a leading figure in the new art movement. His work defined the premise of pop art through parody. Inspired by the comic strip, Lichtenstein produced precise compositions that documented while they parodied, often in a tongue-in-cheek manner. His work was influenced by popular advertising and the comic book style. He described pop art as \"not 'American' painting but actually industrial painting\". His paintings were exhibited at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York City. Whaam! and Drowning Girl are generally regarded as Lichtenstein's most famous works, with Oh, Jeff...I Love You, Too...But... arguably third. Drowning Girl, Whaam! and Look Mickey are regarded as his most influential works. His most expensive piece is Masterpiece, which was sold for $165 million in January 2017.\n\nArtworks : Drowning Girl, Whaam!, Roast Turkey Shopping Bag, Rouen Cathedral Set V [right], Artist's Studio The Dance\"\n\nBirthplace : New York City, Manhattan, USA, New York\n\nAssociated periods or movements : Pop art\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nArt Forms : Sculpture, Painting, Printmaking\n\n3\n\n590 VOTES\n\nKeith Allen Haring (May 4, 1958 – February 16, 1990) was an American artist whose pop art and graffiti-like work grew out of the New York City street culture of the 1980s.Haring's work grew to popularity from his spontaneous drawings in New York City subways—chalk outlines of figures, dogs, and other stylized images-on blank black advertising-space backgrounds. After public recognition he created larger scale works, such as colorful murals, many of them commissioned. His imagery has \"become a widely recognized visual language\". His later work often addressed political and societal themes—especially homosexuality and AIDS—through his own iconography.\n\nArtworks : Keith and Julia, Installation Shafrazi Gallery 1982, Micheal Stewart - USA for Africa, Debbie Dick, St. Sebastian\n\nBirthplace : Reading, Pennsylvania\n\nAssociated periods or movements : Contemporary art, Graffiti, Pop art\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nArt Forms : Painting\n\n4\n\n198 VOTES\n\nSara Pope\n\nArtworks : Temptation, Captive\n\nBirthplace : England\n\nAssociated periods or movements : Pop Art\n\nNationality : British\n\nArt Forms : Lips, Portraiture, Fashion\n\n5\n\n427 VOTES\n\nRomero Britto (born October 6, 1963) is a Brazilian artist, painter, serigrapher and sculptor.

Her work is based in conceptual art and shows some attributes of feminism, minimalism, surrealism, Art Brut, pop art, and abstract expressionism, and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She has been acknowledged as one of the most important living artists to come out of Japan.Raised in Matsumoto, Kusama trained at the Kyoto School of Arts and Crafts in a traditional Japanese painting style called nihonga. Kusama was inspired, however, by American Abstract Impressionism. She moved to New York City in 1958 and was a part of the New York avant-garde scene throughout the 1960s, especially in the pop-art movement. Embracing the rise of the hippie counterculture of the late 1960s, she came to public attention when she organized a series of happenings in which naked participants were painted with brightly colored polka dots. Since the 1970s, Kusama has continued to create art, most notably installations in various museums around the world.\n\nArtworks : No. F, Ascension of Polka Dots, No. IZ, Infinity Nets Yellow, Narcissus Garden\n\nBirthplace : Japan, Matsumoto\n\nAssociated periods or movements : Contemporary art, Minimalism, Pop art\n\nNationality : Japan\n\nArt Forms : Sculpture, Installation art, Painting, Drawing"
