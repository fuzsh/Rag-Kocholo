        "text": "Editor's Notes\n\nPop art has its roots and counterparts in folk art and in imagery such as these examples: a gate in the form of the American flag, and a sign for an optician\n\nThis image I Was a Rich Man’s Plaything was originally made in 1947. It was intended as an ironic comment on the affluent society, a parody on the total accessibility of products and images.\n\nIn 1956, and exhibition This is Tomorrow was held at the Whitechapel Art Gallery and is now as a celebrated as an important development in British pop art. It consisted of a series of 12 displays ranging from architectural panels to department store displays and even a carnival piece. It was an exhibition that, among other things, celebrated people’s lived environments. In the catalogue was this collage by Richard Hamilton, Just What is It that Makes Today’s Homes so Different . It may be seen as an inventory of popular culture – the moon ceiling, muscle man, nude woman, the image of Al Jolson (film being a technological innovation) as is the magnetic tape in the foreground. All these images are presented as an environment in room space. The artists are beginning to portray the lived world as full of symbols that criss-cross the tracks of human activity.\n\nThe second phase of British pop art took place after 1957, and much of it became more abstract. Of the artists of the second wave of pop artists, many came out of the Royal Collage of Art where both Paolozzi and Hamilton taught for short periods. They were increasingly aware that our perception of the world was changing because our senses were being increasingly bombarded by the signs, colours and lights of the mass media. Smith was drawn to the ephemera of everyday life and the titles of many of his images – McCalls, Revlon, Tissue, Flip Top and Softpack etc – betray the sources of his inspiration, as does this image, Package .\n\nIn 1959 Peter Blake, another student from the RCA had begun to use posters and photographs as models for paintings, collages and assemblages showing idols of the new era of rock and films; individuals such as Elvis, Marilyn and Bo Diddley. He may be seen as pre-empting the later work of Andy Warhol.\n\nPeter Philips, another of this second wave of British pop artists used a multitude of symbols, the pinball machine, leather jacket set, playing card eroticism. He began painting in his characteristic style in 1961, consisting of compartmentalised structures.\n\nThe two artists who may be considered as having given a boost to pop art in America are Jaspar Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. The two artists shared a studio from the late 1950s onwards. Jaspar Johns had started producing his objects and symbols paintings in 1954, which included his famous flags. There is an eerie link to Magritte’s work when John’s posed the question of whether what he painted was a flag or a painting. He is of course following Duchamp who had long since turned the ready made into an art.\n\nRaschenberg’s work also displays a debt to Duchamp, whom both Johns and Rauschenberg knew. Rauschenberg’s collections of collages and assemblages of the late 1950s and early 1960s provided a boost to the full fledged pop art that subsequently emerged. Rauschenberg’s assemblages are already half way towards pop art. The assemblages, which are often confused with pop art, refer to a range of three dimensional collages using objects instead of paper. They celebrated junk culture, and what William Seitz, who organised an exhibition called Art of Assemblage , called the collage environment. This consisted of dizzying signs, lights, advertisements, commercials, automobile graveyards, slum detrius and new antiques”.\n\nA number of New York galleries began exhibiting the work of young artists individuals and pop art gradually gained success and recognition. The exhibitions were invariably accompanied by Happenings: theatre performances, demonstrations and street actions. The happenings were the art for some artists, such as the events arranged by George Brecht, events that took place with no prior warning and at any time or place. Brecht later became a founding member of Fluxus.\n\nPerhaps the best known of the Pop Artists was Andy Warhol, the son of an immigrant Czech coal miner who studied technical drawing and design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology at Pittsburgh. Warhol moved to New York in 1949 where he worked as an illustrator and commercial artist. He became the illustrator of Truman Capote’s short stories, which like pop art fed on colloquial speech and mundane everyday reality. Warhol began painting his first pictures in the 1960s while continuing his graphic activities. For these paintings he used graphic motifs taken from advertising and comics. Peach Halves is a good example – by painting these images Warhol de-professionalised the graphic process and the routine of reproduction.\n\nThe 1960s was the era of the star cult, but many were also beginning to recognise that this cult was a sign of the era’s suffering. The made up faces of the stars and the image they projected their fragility and vulnerability to the realities of everyday life. The loneliness of Elvis Presley, the depression of Liz Taylor, and then Marilyn Monroe’s suicide in 1962 all brought this side of reality to the fore.\n\nIt was not only people whom Warhol reproduced endlessly. He also recognised the obsession society had with brand names, reproducing such images repeatedly and in almost realistically graphic detail. It is as though the product itself, the drink or the soup, have ceased to have any relevance and it is their image that ultimately matters. Warhol, in creating these images, not only wanted to turn the trivial and common place into art, but also to make art itself trivial and commonplace. He wanted to make art into something that could be mass-produced, and in setting up his factory he was making a space where art could indeed be mass-produced, using a team of assistants who could be likened to factory workers on a production line.\n\nAnother of the themes that came up in Warhol’s work, which is closely linked to the 1960s, was crime, murder and death. He was concerned with the death of the individual, each death becoming a symptom of mass society. He created, often harrowing images reproduced endlessly of tragedy. In some ways the Death and disaster Series can be seen as taking the individual tragedies of the stars and applying them to the rest of society. His pictures illustrate the fact that tragedy, which is usually picked up in the mass media to be reproduced thousands of times on the fronts of newspapers to feed a sensation hungry public, make a person famous for 15 minutes of his or her life. However, that personal fate is immediately forgotten. The Orange Car Crash Ten Times demonstrates this perfectly.\n\nRoy Lichtenstein became known for his comic strip art. In the early 1960s he began painting his first comic strip works. He began by taking images from magazines a like this one – Girl with Ball – which was a taken from an advertisement in a Sunday supplement.\n\nThe comic strip paintings came about in 1961 when Lichtenstein’s children asked if he could enlarge some comic book figures to an enormous size. Lichtenstein has stated, “I think I started out more as an observer than as a painter, but, when I did one, about half way through the painting I got interested in it as a painting. I began to realise that this was a more powerful thing than I had thought.” What becomes intriguing about these images with their speech bubbles and layout, is that they are clips from a larger narrative, but taken out of sequence and out of context they become meaningless. They are deprived of their narrative logic.\n\nLichtenstein spent much of his artistic career developing and refining the comic strip style. He even took elements from them and developed them into sculptures such as this steel and enamel explosion, abstracted from one of the comic books he used for inspiration. Lichtenstein’s early work may be described as a persistent attempt to determine new relationships between the playful and the serious, between emotion and intellect and between reality and abstract.\n\nClaes Oldenburg is a Swedish born artist; he only became an American citizen in 1953. Oldenburg, unlike the other pop artists I’ve discussed so far, is different in that he worked mainly in the sculptural, three-dimensional medium. Even to the extent that he made himself into a living sculpture in London. And even though his work may also be related to the Surrealist and Dadaist traditions, his remarkable wealth of forms and themes are taken directly from pop subjects. He translates them into his own artistic language.\n\nWhen asked about his work in 1961, Oldenburg said, “I am for art that does something other than sit on its ass in a museum…” He creates a world where trivial objects that are used on a day to day basis, invariably taken little note of, are changed. In many cases when we see them transformed by Oldenburg we don’t at first recognise them, we gasp, then laugh. We have been made to experience the everyday and familiar as something strange and foreign. The toilet – as created by Oldenburg – does this in the same way that Duchamp’s urinal took the readymade and made it into art. When working on a piece, Oldenburg would make several versions, sometimes out of cardboard, sometimes fabric, and usually ending up with vinyl. Here we can see two versions of that much appreciated item of bathroom furniture, the toilet. One of the reasons Oldenburg chose to use vinyl as a medium to express his works is because it is usually regarded as an unpleasant and un-artistic material. In fact, when Oldenburg creates these vinyl sculptures, he does so with great skill and virtuosity, so that ultimately it retains nothing of its original function.\n\nJames Rosenquist, who was also regarded as one of the leading New York pop artists studied at the Minneapolis School of Art and then won a scholarship to the Art Student League in New York. There he met Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. While studying he supported himself by working as a commercial artist and billboard painter. He later recalled entering the advertising factory for the first time in 1954 and seeing 60-foot long paintings of beer glasses and bottles and macaroni salads. He decided that he wanted to work there. He is, in fact, the only one of the pop artists who knew this aspect of the advertising industry from the inside. He began as an abstract artist, but his interest in the abstract made him fascinated by the fact that when he got up close to the image they lost all meaning and recognisability. He began to express this in his work, as we can see from the two examples here, 1,2,3 and Out and Win a New house for Christmas .\n\nThe last of the New York Pop artists that I’m going to discuss is Tom Wesselmann. He too, had a commercial training, having started his studies intending to become a cartoonist. Unlike the others Wesselmann did not paint from magazine advertisements, billboards and objects. Instead he used them directly on the canvas, following the conventions of collage assembly. What he creates are not environments (you cannot enter into them) always he keeps you as at a distance as spectator – voyeur even. Nor are they simply paintings with decorative three-dimensional additions; the small portrait collages that he began creating grew into the Great American Nude Series for which he best known. He takes his inspiration from the colour of Matisse and the line of Modigliani, with certain elements traceable to Mondrian."
