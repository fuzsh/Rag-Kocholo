English Pop (Peter Blake, Derek Boshier, David Hockney, Allen Jones, Peter Phillips), Swiss Pop (Peter Stämpfli), and even Italian Pop (Antonio Recalcati) were all admissible, but America… That alliance between the anti-American communists of the Boudaille and Bouret ilk and the rightwing anti-Americanism of the reactionaries at Le Figaro (Claude Roger-Marx, Pierre Mazars, etc.) was bolstered by a very French paternalistic attitude where the Americans were concerned. In May 1964, at the moment of the 20th Salon de Mai, Georges Boudaille reassured his readers about that “clash between Pop artists and avant-garde French artists and others”: “I can now say that it is thoroughly reassuring for French artists.” A problem of timing: a month later, in Venice, Boudaille had to gauge the value of that altogether French assurance.\n\n10"
