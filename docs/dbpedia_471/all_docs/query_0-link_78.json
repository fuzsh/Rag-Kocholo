        "text": "Actor Eve Hewson has said cancel culture “gives power” to young women in Hollywood.\n\nHewson, 33, the daughter of U2 frontman Bono, told Porter that women were now “allowed” to say they had “bad experiences”, when previously they were told “be grateful, don’t complain”.\n\nShe told the magazine that being a young woman in Hollywood had changed in the last few years.\n\nHewson said: “What has changed is that you’re allowed to now say that you had a bad experience.\n\n“Before it was, ‘Be grateful, don’t complain, this is what it’s like if you want to be a star’.\n\n“At least now, even if people want to or not, they kind of have to respond, or they get cancelled. It gives us power.”\n\nHewson will star as Amelia in Netflix thriller The Perfect Couple, in which her character, a free-spirited bride-to-be, marries into a wealthy and uptight family, and her best friend is found dead the night before her wedding.\n\nShe also appeared in Bridge Of Spies, Papillon and Robin Hood.\n\nAbout the upcoming series, Hewson said: “(It was) a blast, like being at summer camp.\n\n“You don’t usually have so many people on set your own age.”\n\nShe will also appear in Noah Baumbach’s highly anticipated and shrouded-in-mystery unnamed movie for Netflix, which will star Isla Fisher, Greta Gerwig, George Clooney, Billy Cruddup and Adam Sandler.\n\nHewson said that neither she nor her fellow actors know the plot of the film.\n\nShe said: “I haven’t read the script. He only gave us our scenes. It’s actually kind of cool.\n\n“The characters sort of live in their own world. They all relate to George Clooney. But no-one really sees each other.”\n\nShe spoke about her famous family, including her brother Elijah, the frontman of pop rock group Inhaler, and said she had also wanted to follow a musical career path initially.\n\nBut Hewson said acting was “the only thing I was good at”, and she first thought she was “going to be Charli XCX”.\n\nShe said the entire family had moved back to Dublin during lockdown and formed a family band.\n\nHewson said: “We have a studio at the end of (my parents’) garden, where (we) usually end up, in the middle of the night, writing stupid songs.\n\n“I actually got kicked out of the family band, for being too enthusiastic.”\n\nHewson also said her father did not make the band as he was “asleep by 10pm every night”.\n\nOn having a famous father she said the only thing she could do was “crack a joke and move on”.\n\nHewson has previously joked about nepotism, with the magazine citing a post she made on X, formerly Twitter, which read: “2023 Goals: be successful enough to get recognised as a nepo baby”.\n\nThe Perfect Couple will premiere on Netflix on September 5.\n\nHewson’s interview with Porter is available on the publication’s website or it can be read on the Net-A-Porter app for iPhone, iPod and Android."
