        "text": "Soup Cans & Superstars\n\nIn the centrepiece film of BBC Four's pop art season, Alastair Sooke champions pop art as one of the most important art forms of the twentieth century, peeling back pop's frothy, ironic surface to reveal an art style full of subversive wit and radical ideas.\n\nA Day in the Life of Andy Warhol\n\nStephen Smith meets with many of Andy Warhol's friends and confidantes to get closer to the man behind the enigmatic public image, experiencing for himself a day in the life of the pop art superstar.\n\nA Brief History of Grafitti\n\nDr Richard Clay goes in search of what it is that has made us scribble and scratch mementoes of our lives for more than 30,000 years.\n\nWhat Do Artists Do All Day?: Peter Blake\n\nOver the past sixty years artist Peter Blake has enjoyed a celebrated career. We spend time with him at work in his studio and follow the process of the Mersey ferry’s makeover.\n\nWhat Do Artists Do All Day?: Derek Boshier\n\nDerek Boshier was one of the pioneers of the British Pop Art movement. We spend a day at his studio in L.A. as he works on a new painting and reflects on his life and career.\n\nBBC Four Pop idents\n\nPop Artists Peter Blake, Peter Phillips and Derek Boshier are creating unique channel idents for BBC Four, to be shown on television during the season and also available here on the website.\n\nFrom Boshier to Blake, 6 Music celebrates pop art with a series of programmes about its influence on alternative music.\n\nLauren Laverne will be highlighting a different aspect of pop art every day on her show, along with compiling a Peoples Playlist themed around the women of pop art starting from Debbie Harry. Stuart Maconie’s Freak Zone will take an in-depth look at the Velvet Underground and Nico, Sir Peter Blake presents a documentary about his most famous protégé Ian Dury and, on Friday August 28, the artist Jeremy Deller sits in for Iggy Pop to take a look at the role of art in music.\n\nRadio 4 will broadcast Fifteen Minutes, a play by Sarah Wooley about the last days of Pop Art set in New York in the heady days of Studio 54. And on Radio 3, Paul Morley presents Andy Warhol’s Factory Friends."
