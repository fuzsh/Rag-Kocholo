        "text": "The Tate Gallery’s homage to British Pop Art, ‘Art & the Sixties: This Was Tomorrow’, features Peter Phillips early oil on canvas, The Entertainment Machine. Of the 31 works of Peter Phillips owned by the Tate, The Entertainment Machine is a particularly important work that was originally shown in the Young Contemporaries Exhibition in 1962, and was acquired by the Tate in 1976 from the Peter Stuyvesant Foundation.\n\nPainted in 1961 at the artist’s live/work studio on Holland Park Road in Kensington, Phillips depicted abstract imagery using a board game format as a compositional device. A recurring theme in many of Phillips’ paintings, The Entertainment Machine utilizes imagery of mechanical parts including a pistol, diagram of bullet sizes, and piano keyboard. The painting also includes a monster head and small targets.\n\nWhen interviewed in 1976, Peter Phillips indicated that The Entertainment Machineembodied his feelings at the time, relating vaguely to surrealism, without narrative or reference to any specific theme. Reflecting on his work in 2014, Phillips recalls it taking a long time to paint, with many layers of painting, sanding and repainting. He feels particularly fond of the name he chose for the work. When asked of his motivation, Phillips simply notes “I was on a different frequency then.”"
