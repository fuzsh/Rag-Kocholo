        "text": "Before attending the Royal College of Art in London, Phillips studied graphic design and technical draftsmanship. He applied his skills to establish a style marked by the juxtaposition of images, like the pinup and car part here, sourced from magazines and other mass media in montage-like compositions. The title of this print—the first in a series of three—refers to custom auto-body shops where a polished enamel sheen is applied to cars. Phillips worked with Chiron Press, a screenprinting studio that produced posters and greeting cards. The press encouraged him to experiment with nontraditional materials such as silver foil and glossy inks, which complement the artist’s brash and vibrant style."
