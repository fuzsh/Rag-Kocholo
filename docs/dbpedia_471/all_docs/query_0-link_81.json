        "text": "01 of 62\n\nMatt Damon and Jesse Plemons\n\nJesse Plemons has heard that he resembles Matt Damon, and he was a little nervous to hear whether Matt Damon had too.\n\n\"Definitely flattered by the comparison,\" he told Access Hollywood. \"But yeah, I would be curious to hear his thoughts, if he's annoyed.\"\n\nWhen showed a clip of Plemons' comments (also on Access Hollywood), Damon said he had to agree with those who thought they looked alike, recalling that Plemons had been cast as a younger version of him in the 2000 movie All the Pretty Horses.\n\n\" I couldn’t believe it. He looked more like me than I did when I was little. Like my little 11-year-old face did not look like it [was going to become me]. He looked exactly like me. I was like, 'This is really weird,' \" he said, adding, “I’m proud of the comparison.\"\n\n02 of 62\n\nMcKenna Grace and Kiernan Shipka\n\nMcKenna Grace has played the younger version of numerous stars on-screen, from Margot Robbie in 2017's I, Tonya to Brie Larson in 2019's Captain Marvel. However, none of this holds a candle to her near-perfect casting as the younger version of Kiernan Shipka's Sabrina Spellman on Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.\n\nFun fact: Shipka personally chose Grace for the role — per The Wrap — sending series creator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa a photo of them together along with a message: \"You have to get Mckenna. She's like me as a little girl, and we're dead ringers.\"\n\n03 of 62\n\nJared Leto and Scott Disick\n\nWhile Jared Leto has often been dubbed a Jesus look-alike, it appears he has another clone.\n\nDuring an appearance on SiriusXM's TikTok Radio, Leto was told he looks \"identical\" to Scott Disick, to which he replied, \"Really? Lucky me. Thank you.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I don't know. It's hard when you look at yourself. But they do say that people who look alike actually share a lot of DNA, sometimes. You know, if there's someone like, 'Oh my God, you look exactly like this guy,' you actually might be related somehow.\"\n\n\"So that would be nice because then I would have a rich relative. Because he's very wealthy, right? Yeah, that would be nice,\" the Thirty Seconds to Mars frontman added.\n\n04 of 62\n\nJeremy Allen White and Gene Wilder\n\nSharing the same curls and baby blue eyes, it's often been speculated that Emmy-winning actor Jeremy Allen White is a long-lost relative of the iconic Gene Wilder. However, White has been adamant there's no familial connection.\n\nDuring a 2023 interview on Late Night with Seth Meyers, White was asked if he clicked on the viral article \"These Celebrity Grandchildren Look Exactly Like Their Grandparents,\" which featured a side-by-side photo of him and Wilder.\n\n\"No, I haven't because I know that's not my grandfather,\" he said. \"During the first season of [The Bear], people started talking about the resemblance that we bear, and I mean, it's true. And I love him so much. Like, the first film I think I watched over and over again as a kid was Young Frankenstein, and then I found all the rest after.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time this topic surfaced in an interview, as White stated in a 2022 InStyle video: \"Everyone's decided I look a lot like Gene Wilder, which I agree. But I guess somebody called Carmy a 'Ketamine Gene Wilder,' which I thought was weird and funny.\"\n\n05 of 62\n\nZoey Deutch and Haley Lu Richardson\n\nThough unrelated, Zoey Deutch and Haley Lu Richardson are good friends who, coincidentally, have the same smile, eyebrows and hair!\n\nIn fact, Deutch even auditioned for the role of Portia on season 2 of The White Lotus, but it ultimately went to Richardson.\n\n\"My dear friend Haley got the role,\" the Something from Tiffany's actress told Buzzfeed in 2022. \"But I'm still getting credit for it, which is great. I didn't get it, but I'm still in it in a way. People are tweeting me like, 'Who's who? They're the same person!' \"\n\n06 of 62\n\nCoco Jones and Jennifer Hudson\n\nJennifer Hudson and Coco Jones have often been likened to each other, with comparisons dating back to 2012. That year, Jones acknowledged the resemblance in a post on Twitter (now X), writing, \"Everybody says I look like Jennifer Hudson :), yall really think so ?! I would luv to sing with her.\" (Luckily, her dream came true more than a decade later, with The Bel-Air actress sharing a video on TikTok of the two singing together in 2023.)\n\nThat same year, during an interview on The Jennifer Hudson Show, EGOT winner Hudson queried the \"ICU\" singer about their similar looks.\n\n\"I get that so often, that honest at this point, I just play into it,\" Jones replied before briefly singing, \"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going.\"\n\n\"People say, 'Who would you want to play you?' And I see your name keeps popping up,\" Hudson said, to which Jones said, \"Stop playing with me. I'm ready at this point.\"\n\nJones added, \"I take it as such a compliment because you know you have been so impactful in my life. Just watching you, another beautiful dark-skinned woman just killing it, that's my motivation.\"\n\n07 of 62\n\nTimothée Chalamet and Natalia Dyer\n\nThe striking similarity between Wonka star Timothée Chalamet and Stranger Things actress Natalia Dyer is hard to miss. They both possess the same chiseled jawline, strong bone structure, dark brown hair and light-colored eyes.\n\nThough they haven't publicly acknowledged their near-identical looks, many fans eagerly wait for them to potentially play siblings in the future.\n\n08 of 62\n\nChelsea Blackwell and Megan Fox\n\nThis one was a bit more controversial, but Love Is Blind season 6 contestant Chelsea Blackwell shared with her still-unseen fiancé that she had received comparisons to Megan Fox in the past as they shared information about each other from behind an opaque screen.\n\nWhen viewers weighed in (often unkindly) on the resemblance, Blackwell went on social media to amplify a message from her friend instructing people to \"cool it.\" However, Blackwell told Entertainment Tonight in February 2024 that she \"did reach out to [Fox], and was like, 'I'm so sorry I did this to you.' \"\n\nThe Jennifer's Body actress later broke her silence about the resemblance debate.\n\n\"I didn't watch [Love Is Blind], but I think in general, no one deserves to get bullied,\" she told E! News in April 2024. \"I don't think she deserved that. I think people went way too hard.\"\n\n09 of 62\n\nEmma Mackey and Margot Robbie\n\nIn a 2023 interview with Buzzfeed, Margot Robbie explained that Emma Mackey — who plays the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Barbie in the 2023 fantasy film — was cast for a very specific reason: People think she and Robbie look alike.\n\n\"She plays one of the Barbies in the movie pretty much because Greta and I thought it would be funny,\" Robbie said in a joint interview with Gosling. \"We were gonna do this whole joke about us looking similar.\"\n\nHowever, Robbie said once they had their hair color set for the movie (Mackey as a dark brunette and Robbie in stereotypical Barbie blonde), the resemblance was less noticeable, and the joke was scrapped.\n\n10 of 62\n\nKeira Knightley and Natalie Portman\n\nThese two brunette stars look so alike that the Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace producers couldn't help but take notice — and cast Knightley as the body double for Portman's Queen Amidala in the 1999 film. The pair are mistaken for each other so often that Knightley says people have chased her down in airports, thinking she's the Black Swan (2010) star.\n\n\"I feel quite sorry for her because she must get chased a lot because it's happened like five times where someone's been like Natalie! Natalie! Natalie!' And I'll sign and take a picture as Natalie,\" Knightley said during a 2014 interview on The Graham Norton Show.\n\nIn a 2024 interview with Vanity Fair, Portman said she's still mistaken for Knightley \"all the time\" — and finds it \"very flattering.\"\n\n11 of 62\n\nReese Witherspoon and Carrie Underwood\n\nCarrie Underwood and Reese Witherspoon are both blonde, Southern and multitalented, so it's no wonder that they've occasionally been confused for one another. Luckily, they take it as the huge compliment it is.\n\n\"To the woman in the parking lot who just asked me if I was Carrie Underwood: You officially made my day!\" Witherspoon shared in a post on Twitter (now X) in 2020.\n\nUnderwood responded, \"YOUR day?!?!?!?! That lady just made my whole life!\"\n\n12 of 62\n\nBrie Larson and Phoebe Bridgers\n\nLarson and indie-rock singer Phoebe Bridgers haven't commented on the internet's obsession with their similar appearances, but they have crossed digital paths in at least one way: Larson has paid tribute to the singer by covering her collaboration with Taylor Swift, \"Nothing New,\" in a video posted on YouTube from Larson's Instagram account.\n\n13 of 62\n\nHalsey and Millie Bobby Brown\n\nDuring an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in June 2022, Halsey revealed they think Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown would be \"great\" playing them in a biopic, considering their \"uncanny\" appearances.\n\n\"I mean, it's kind of uncanny how much we look alike,\" the singer said. \"It's like, 'Oh, no. We actually just look like sisters.' \"\n\nOne day later, Brown shared a snippet of the interview on her Instagram Story and confirmed she was game, writing \"sooooo down.\"\n\n14 of 62\n\nReese Witherspoon and Kelsea Ballerini\n\n\"We met several years ago at the Christmas tree lighting at the White House,\" Kelsea Ballerini recalled of her first run-in with Witherspoon on a 2022 episode of PEOPLE (The TV Show!). \"We were backstage, and I just said, 'You know, people say I look like you, and I'm obsessed with you.' \"\n\nBallerini added that, since then, their \"paths have crossed so much, and we've become really lovely friends.\"\n\n\"I'm able to call her if I have a question or need some encouragement or advice. She's a true girls' girl,\" Ballerini said.\n\n15 of 62\n\nChris Pine and Joey Lawrence\n\nWhoa! Do you see a resemblance between Chris Pine and Joey Lawrence? Someone did, as Pine recalled on a post-Oscars visit to Jimmy Kimmel Live! in March 2022.\n\n\"I was out this weekend, went to a couple of parties, and it was alright,\" Pine said. \"I was at one, and I was about to go, and this guy stopped me, and he's like, 'I know you.' I was like, 'God, this again' — and he's like, 'Joey Lawrence!' \"\n\nAfter telling the fan he was \"not quite\" right about his guess as to who he was, the stranger said to Pine, \"C'mon man, tell me who you are!\" Poking fun at celebrities he's been mistaken for in the past, Pine responded as he went in for a handshake, \"Chris Evans, Captain America.\"\n\n\"And to top it all off, he goes, 'That's my man,' \" the actor said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Pine's been mistaken for another Hollywood actor. \"I've gotten Ryan Reynolds, [Chris] Pratt, [Chris] Hemsworth, Matt Damon,\" he listed, \"But it was a first for Joey Lawrence.\"\n\n16 of 62\n\nMegan Fox and Adriana Lima\n\nAdriana Lima and Fox had a cheeky exchange in the comments of a since-deleted post Lima shared on her Instagram in July 2021.\n\nAlongside a photo split of herself and Fox in full glam makeup, the model wrote, \"⚡️💋 @meganfox if you ever need a body double in one of your movies, hit me up ☎️ ⚡️ my only request is ... We share the same makeup artist @patrickta 💁🏻‍♀️💋⚡️.\"\n\nFox didn't miss a beat in the comments, writing, \"But what if I need a girlfriend ... can I hit you up for that as well? 💜\"\n\n\"Patrick can still be involved somehow. He can do our makeup when I take you to Nobu,\" teased Fox.\n\n\"It's a date see you tonight at Nobu,\" the former Victoria's Secret Angel replied, alongside two flame emojis.\n\n17 of 62\n\nDemi Lovato and Kacey Musgraves\n\nIncredibly talented singers? Check. Stunning in shimmering orange getups? Check. Rocking great brows and perfect middle parts? Check. We're not exactly \"Confident\" in telling Demi Lovato and Kacey Musgraves apart in this one.\n\nIn February 2024, Lovato — according to a Musgraves fan account on X — shared a screenshot of her listening to her doppelgänger's song, \"Deeper Well,\" on her Instagram Stories, writing, \"These lyrics hit so hard.\"\n\n18 of 62\n\nKyle Richards & Kacey Musgraves\n\nOn the other hand, Musgraves also resembles Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Kyle Richards.\n\n\"So many people say that [Musgraves] & I look alike. Have to agree,\" Richards wrote on Instagram following a May 2019 episode of RHOBH. She also shared a pic of Musgraves in her blonde, Barbie-inspired Met Gala look, writing, \"Then my friend pointed out how Kacey looks like my niece Paris Hilton here. Who people think looks like me but blonde. So maybe Kacey is a long lost relative.\"\n\nIn a 2022 interview with Pedestrian.TV, Richards said she'd want Musagraves to play her in a biopic about her life.\n\n\"Everyone always says we look similar. I posted something, and she DM'd me, 'Hi twin,' which is a huge compliment,\" she told the outlet. \"People used to always compare me toDemi Moore, that we look alike and sound alike, and now it's Kacey Musgraves, and I'm like, 'Great! I'm getting younger!' \"\n\n19 of 62\n\nKate Mara & Isla Fisher and Anna Kendrick\n\nKate Mara told PEOPLE she gets recognized in airports — but usually not as herself: \"People usually don't think I'm me. They think I'm Anna Kendrick or Isla Fisher. They'll say, 'You were so good in Wedding Crashers!' And I'm like, 'Thank you!' \"\n\nKendrick poked fun at their frequently mistaken identities on Twitter (now X) in 2014, writing, \"People get us confused. Then we showed up to dinner in the same jacket. So now we can never hang out again.\"\n\n20 of 62\n\nDylan McDermott and David Schwimmer\n\nWe totally get why Dylan McDermott has been confused for David Schwimmer (by none other than Piers Morgan, per Daily Mail): They're both tall, dark and handsome, and both starred on iconic '90s series like The Practice and Friends, respectively.\n\n21 of 62\n\nHilary Duff and Victoria Pedretti\n\nFans are flipping out over the similarities between Hilary Duff and You star Victoria Pedretti — who plays the on-screen love interest (literally named Love) of Penn Badgley's Joe.\n\nTo add another layer to the actresses' look-alike comparisons, Duff previously shared the screen with Badgley — in another role where his character wasn't quite what he seemed — as girlfriend Olivia Burke on season 3 of Gossip Girl. Anyone remember their steamy ménage à trois with Vanessa (Jessica Szohr)?\n\n22 of 62\n\nThe Property Brothers and Zachary Levi\n\nWho knew the Property Brothers were triplets? Okay, so Zachary Levi is not actually related to the identical Scott twins, Jonathan and Drew — but he certainly looks like he could be. (Anyone else think that Jonathan's relationship with Zooey Deschanel looks a lot like the real-life version of Rachel Brosnahan's Midge and Levi's Benjamin in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel?)\n\nIn 2015, Levi praised the Scotts' performances in Something Rotten! on Broadway, sharing a photo of the trio on Twitter (now X) with the caption: \"So @RottenBroadway was so damn good. Highly recommend it. And my doppelgängers @MrSilverScott & @MrDrewScott agree.\"\n\nJonathan responded to the post, \"Such a good time. Mom & dad never told us we had a tripl\n\n23 of 62\n\nRyan Reynolds and Kate Beckinsale\n\n\"I look exactly like Ryan Reynolds,\" Kate Beckinsale told host Jimmy Fallon during a 2019 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. \"Like in a shocking way. Like, when sometimes I see a bus going by with a poster on it, I think, 'Damn, I look hot. Oh, wait, that's not me. Also, I've never done that movie.' \"\n\nWhen Reynolds stopped by Today in 2019, co-hosts Hoda Kotb and Craig Melvin showed the star the clip of Beckinsale (as shared on their official X account), and he couldn't help but agree.\n\n\"It is like looking in a mirror,\" he joked before saying, \"This has been something that I've heard for a long time. Other people have said it to me as well.\"\n\n24 of 62\n\nEd Sheeran and Prince Harry\n\nPrince Harry left a group of schoolgirls giggling after they asked him if he was the real royal — or pop star Ed Sheeran. As he approached the line of about 70 flag-waving pupils on Commonwealth Day in 2017, the prince stopped to speak to 12-year-old Tiya Thornton, who told him that he looked like fellow redhead Sheeran.\n\n\"Are you the real Prince Harry?\" Tiya asked the prince, to which he replied, \"Yes, the other one is Ed Sheeran.\"\n\nThe guys talked about their common ginger thread in 2019 in a PSA they filmed together for World Mental Health Day.\n\nIn June 2021 — shortly after the birth of his daughter, Princess Lilibet — Harry attended the WellChild Awards in London, where he and Sheeran further bonded over parenthood.\n\n25 of 62\n\nRupert Grint and Ed Sheeran\n\nThe prince isn't the only one. Harry Potter's Rupert Grint told James Corden in a 2017 interview on The Late Late Show that nearly 50 percent of fans he meets thinks he's Sheeran.\n\n\"If someone spots me, I could go either way,\" he said.\n\nEven other celebrities have trouble differentiating the pair. Grint said British singer-songwriter Leo Sayer once made the mistake.\n\n\"He came up to me and said he loved my music, of course thinking I was Ed,\" Grint recounted. \"I play along.\"\n\nWhat likely adds to the confusion: The actor appeared in Sheeran's 2011 music video for \"Lego House.\"\n\n26 of 62\n\nMatt Bomer and Henry Cavill\n\nThe piercing eyes, the strong jaws, even the parts of their hair — Matt Bomer and Henry Cavill look like they could be brothers. They've even been up for the same roles: In 2015, Bomer revealed (via E! News) that he auditioned for the part of Superman in Man of Steel, a role that ultimately went to Cavill.\n\n27 of 62\n\nAllen Leech and Niall Horan\n\nDespite their age gap, the Downton Abbey star is often reminded of his resemblance to the singer. \"People do it all the time,\" he said on The Late Late Show. \"It happened, I think, at the start of Downton, people were like, 'Oh my God, Niall is on the show!' on Twitter.\"\n\n\"It's very flattering to me. I'm 38, he's 26,\" Leech added.\n\nThe actor went on to mention the August 2019 tweet in which Horan recounted getting called out as his look-alike at a restaurant. \"Waiter just said to me 'Did anyone ever tell you that you look exactly like the guy from Downton Abbey?' @Allenleech,\" Horan wrote.\n\n\"I'm guessing Niall had a really big night. If he's starting to look like me, I'm worried. Moisturize more, Niall,\" Leech joked of the incident on the late-night show.\n\nIn a 2022 interview with Irish Mirror, Leech said that if there were to be a Downton Abbey spinoff series, he'd want Horan to play a younger version of his character.\n\n28 of 62\n\nCourteney Cox and Demi Moore\n\n\"Who's who 👯‍♀️,\" Moore captioned a photo of herself with actress Courteney Cox on Instagram.\n\nCox commented on the twinning shot, writing, \"Haha! I'll have to send you a pic that I was even confused by 💕\"\n\nSocial media users also saw the uncanny resemblance and shared their thoughts in the comments.\n\n\"Are you relatives? 😊😊😊,\" one user wrote.\n\n\"Sisters?!?\" another added.\n\n29 of 62\n\nKatharine McPhee Foster and Sophia Bush\n\nIn December 2018, Katharine McPhee posted a hilarious video to her Instagram from a red carpet event years ago, where she was accidentally mistaken for the One Tree Hill actress. In the clip, a reporter calls over McPhee for an interview but refers to her as \"Sophia\" — which it seems McPhee does not initially hear - and then proceeds to say, \"You're in One Tree Hill.\"\n\nMcPhee was understandably confused at the time, but years later, decided to capitalize on the error. \"If there's ever a @sophiabush biography, y'all know who to call,\" she jokingly captioned the video.\n\n\"I legitimately cannot stop laughing,\" Bush replied. \"Also, not fair that it doesn't go the other way! No one's ever heard me singing and said, 'oh you sound just like Katharine McPhee.' dammit!!\"\n\n30 of 62\n\nSarah Hyland and Lucy Hale\n\nMaybe they've never been the most obvious faux twins. However, when Lucy Hale posted a selfie of the two on Instagram in September 2018, their brows and bone structure said it all.\n\n\"Anyone tryin to cast some sisters?\" Hale wrote in the caption.\n\n31 of 62\n\nMila Kunis and Sarah Hyland\n\nBecause of that seven-year age difference, Mila Kunis really could be Hyland's big sister — which helped when the Modern Family actress dressed up as Kunis' That '70s Show character, Jackie Burkhart, for Halloween in 2010. \"People say I look like Mila,\" she told Cambio. \"I've always wanted to be Jackie for Halloween, so [I] just did it.\"\n\nIn a 2021 interview on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Hyland shared that she still gets mistaken for Kunis. \"The first time I met her, she was like, 'I get confused as you all the time and I love it. I take it as a compliment because you're younger than I am, so sometimes I go along with it,' \" she said. \"And I was like, 'Well the next time I get mistaken for you, can I pretend to be you?' And she gave me her permission. But then a month later, it was the Golden Globes when she was nominated for Black Swan.\"\n\nBut instead of pretending to be Kunis — and potentially saying something that would start a rumor — Hyland \"held her tongue\" and said \"no thanks\" before walking away.\n\n32 of 62\n\nMeghan Markle and Joanna Gaines\n\nIf you squint, you might see that Joanna Gaines resembles Meghan Markle. From their flawless waves to their picture-perfect smiles, the Fixer Upper star and the Duchess of Sussex could be twins ... or at least distant relatives (depending on who you ask.)\n\n33 of 62\n\nCarla Bruni and Bella Hadid\n\nWe're seeing double! Carla Bruni — the Italian-French '90s supermodel and former First Lady of France — and Bella Hadid are well aware of their twinning status. Bruni shared a look-alike selfie on Instagram of the pair.\n\nIn 2019, the models attended the Dior dinner at the Cannes Film Festival and posed for another picture together, which Bruni posted on Instagram with the caption: \"With my (slightly younger) sister @bellahadid 😜🦋💕.\"\n\n34 of 62\n\nZach Braff and Dax Shepard\n\nSeparated at birth? Scrubs alum Zach Braff shared a face swap with look-alike pal Dax Shepard (that Shepard's wife, Kristen Bell, took a few years back) in a now-deleted post on X.\n\n\"I'm gonna get this put on a T-shirt,\" Braff joked in the caption.\n\nShepard played along, writing, \"For me, it's really the pictures in the left [column]. I mean, it almost appears that there was no swap there.\"\n\nWe're thinking it might be time for Braff to go blonde.\n\n35 of 62\n\nJohn Mayer and Antoni Porowski\n\nQueer Eye star Antoni Porowski posted an Instagram Story of himself posing exactly like John Mayer with the caption, \"I dunno, guys, I just don't see it.\"\n\nApparently, some of his followers were confused by his sarcastic caption, so he clarified by posting a side-by-side photo of his picture next to Mayer's — and yes, they're basically identical twins who were separated at birth.\n\n36 of 62\n\nGus Kenworthy and Richard Madden\n\nOlympic freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy is a king in his sport. And it turns out his celebrity doppelgänger is a king, too — or was, anyway — in the North. Of Westeros, that is.\n\nAs the internet noted, and Kenworthy called out on X and his Instagram Story, the athlete shares an undeniable resemblance to Scottish actor Richard Madden, perhaps best known for playing the ill-fated Robb Stark in the early seasons of Game of Thrones. \"Uh oh,\" he called out to Madden on social media, \"they're on to us…\"\n\n37 of 62\n\nTiffani Thiessen and Alexandra Daddario\n\nBeverly Hills, 90210 alum Tiffani Thiessen and White Lotus star Alexandra Daddario — who both appeared on White Collar — share the same piercing blue eyes and dark locks.\n\n38 of 62\n\nHarry Connick Jr. and the Property Brothers\n\nWhile filming a segment for Harry, Harry Connick Jr. and Property Brothers star Jonathan revealed they're frequently told they're one another's celebrity doppelgängers.\n\n\"It's funny, we're twins, but no one in all my life has ever said I look like you,\" Drew said of Jonathan and Connick Jr.'s resemblance. \"But people say it all the time that he does.\"\n\nJonathan added: \"I get more messages [from people] online who say they swear we were split at birth.\"\n\nConnick Jr. couldn't help but agree, saying: \"I can really see it now.\"\n\n39 of 62\n\nBella Hadid and Jennifer Lawrence\n\nOne is on top of the fashion world, the other the acting scene. However, dominating their respective industries isn't the only thing Hadid and Jennifer Lawrence have in common: They look alike.\n\nWhen asked how often she's compared to the Oscar winner, Hadid told Fashionista in 2015, Multiple times a day. Probably today, it's already happened like five times.\"\n\n40 of 62\n\nBrie Larison and Natasha Bure\n\nCandace Cameron Bure's daughter Natasha made headlines for her performance on The Voice (it even got Adam Levine's attention!). However, you'll be forgiven if you've been confusing her for another famous lady: Oscar-winning actress Larson.\n\nThey both have that same sweet but slightly mischievous smile, a similar set of eyes and nearly identical heads of dirty blonde hair. Now, we just need the two to meet and pose for a selfie.\n\n41 of 62\n\nJason Sudeikis and Ed Helms\n\nOn Conan, Jason Sudeikis revealed that he's constantly mistaken for his We're the Millers costar. \"Ed Helms and I, I think, get confused quite a bit, the two of us,\" he said.\n\nThe actor added that he isn't bothered by the mix-ups because \"I'm in a good place, in the sense that mine is a really nice, funny, smart guy.\"\n\nSudeikis even embraced an awkward run-in at the White House Correspondents' Dinner when a fellow attendee who had asked for a picture seemed taken aback when he said his real name.\n\n\" 'Did you think I was Ed Helms from The Hangover?' \" the star recalled asking the fan.\n\n\"Yes, but it's OK,\" she replied. \"You look enough like him.\"\n\n42 of 62\n\nAshley Graham and Eva Mendes\n\nAshley Graham and Eva Mendes are undeniably united in hotness. The ladies' flawless glowing skin, thick brunette waves and can't-look-away brown eyes have us wondering if they're really long-lost sisters. If so, their gene pool might just be a national treasure.\n\n43 of 62\n\nMatthew Morrison and Paul Ryan\n\nWhether it's the nose, ears or smile, there's no denying that politician Paul Ryan shares a certain something with former Glee star Matthew Morrison.\n\n44 of 62\n\nJared Haibon and Ashton Kutcher\n\nIn 2015, Ashton Kutcher's wife Mila Kunis had to get a side-by-side comparison of her husband and Bachelor in Paradise contestant Jared Haibon.\n\n\"I'm trying to figure out why Mila is making me take this picture @ashleyiaco who are you? And who is this guy?\" Kutcher wrote on Twitter when he shared the snapshot. But Paradise contestant (and his future wife) Ashley Iaconetti was the first to notice their equally chiseled cheekbones and jaws. On the show, she said Haibon looked like a mix between Kutcher and Joe Jonas.\n\nThree years later, Haibon posted a selfie of him alongside Kutcher and their wives on Instagram, writing: \"In 2015, Ashton Kutcher tweeted a side by side photo of our faces. In 2017, he said he got into watching The Bachelor because a guy named Jared looked like him. In 2018, we met and bonded over marrying our best friends.\"\n\n45 of 62\n\nAlicia Silverstone and Maggie Lawson\n\nAlicia Silverstone and Maggie Lawson are friends because they \"both know what it's like for people to be jealous of [them].\" Okay, we can't confirm that, but the actresses' near-identical features do inspire envy.\n\n46 of 62\n\nAna Gasteyer and Kathryn Hahn\n\nAna Gasteyer brought the laughs on Saturday Night Live in the late '90s. Or was that Kathryn Hahn? The actresses' lush brown locks, wide smiles and rosy cheeks make it hard to tell them apart. Add this to the list of similarities: Before heading to Hollywood, both women studied at Northwestern University. Coincidence or cosmic attempt to reunite long-lost twins? All signs point to the latter.\n\n“[Gasteyer] actually told me that when Bad Moms came out, when she would go to Starbucks, she would order something, and then they would give her the cup that would just say ‘Carla,’ which was my character’s name from Bad Moms,\" Hahn said during a 2018 interview on The Late Late Show with James Corden. “And people come up to me all the time and say, ‘Love you on SNL,’ and I say, ‘Thank you.’ ”\n\n47 of 62\n\nMelissa Benoist and Blake Lively\n\nSupergirl Melissa Benoist could be Blake Lively's twin with her bright eyes and blonde hair. The former Gleek has another weird connection with the Gossip Girl alum: Benoist was once married to her Glee costar. His name? Blake Jenner!\n\n48 of 62\n\nJulie Bowen and Elizabeth Banks\n\nThe funny women are both proud blonde mamas and are even within an inch of each other's height. Surprisingly, when Elizabeth Banks guest-starred on Modern Family, she didn't play a relative of Julie Bowen's character, Claire Dunphy.\n\n49 of 62\n\nAmanda Steele and Ashley Benson\n\nWhen Amanda Steele (formerly known as MakeupbyMandy24 on YouTube) ditched her brunette hair for a blonde look, she bore a striking resemblance to the Pretty Little Liars star Ashley Benson. Their faces are almost interchangeable, which isn't really a problem because when you look that good, two is definitely better than one.\n\n50 of 62\n\nAmal Clooney and Anne Hathaway\n\nAnne Hathaway and Amal Clooney have more than one thing in common: Between their full lips, dark hair and big brown eyes, the actress and attorney could almost be sisters.\n\n\"I hope that I become half the woman that she is — she's so accomplished, and it's so thrilling to look at someone and be like, 'Oh, you really are making the world a better place,' \" Hathaway told Extra in 2015 of her doppelgänger.\n\n51 of 62\n\nGeorge Clooney and Guillermo Zapata\n\nHate to break it to you, George Clooney: You no longer have a monopoly on the silver-fox look. The actor's eerily identical doppelgänger is Guillermo Zapata, an Argentinian male model who co-owns SUR restaurant in West Hollywood with The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Lisa Vanderpump. But sorry, Cloney — as he's been dubbed — is married, just like his twin.\n\n52 of 62\n\nChris Soules and Scott Speedman\n\nWait, did they cast Scott Speedman to be the Bachelor? Nope, Chris Soules — the man who went looking for love on season 19 of the ABC reality dating show — just happens to share the same chiseled facial features and body as the Felicity alum. We'd accept a rose from either.\n\n53 of 62\n\nDarren Criss and Kit Harington\n\nGlee's Darren Criss and Game of Thrones' Kit Harington share the same brown curls and dreamy brown eyes.\n\nIn 2016, Criss reported the moment he was mistaken for Harrington in an Instagram post, sharing the dialogue of the encounter: \" 'Hey... Are you Kit Harington?'\n\nMe: aw sorry man I'm not\n\n'Aw cuz if you were I'd kick myself if I didn't ask for a picture.'\n\n[he goes, disappointed]\n\nMe: wait, can I get a picture though? To commemorate this moment?\"\n\n54 of 62\n\nMick Jagger and Harry Styles\n\nBritish? Check. Stylish? Double check. Both Mick Jagger and Harry Styles possess a certain swagger, and while the Rolling Stones singer is old enough to be the One Direction heartthrob's granddad, in the past their similar good looks have had some overzealous bloggers suggesting the boy bander could play Jagger in a biopic.\n\nHowever, in a 2022 interview with The Sunday Times, Jagger dismissed the Styles comparisons, saying: \"He doesn't have a voice like mine or move on stage like me; he just has a superficial resemblance to my younger self, which is fine — he can't help that.\"\n\n55 of 62\n\nAmy Adams and Isla Fisher\n\nThough Fisher has big brown eyes and Amy Adams has ocean blue ones, the two stars share the same long copper locks, and people regularly get them confused.\n\n\"I get [mistaken for] Isla Fisher all the time, still,\" Adams told Vanity Fair in December 2013. \"When I'm with Isla, we both look at one another and … I get it but I don't get it.\"\n\nIn 2017, Fisher revealed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that none other than Lady Gaga mistook her for Adams at the annual Vanity Fair Oscar afterparty\n\n“I was there all fancy and dressed up at the bar and schmoozing with show-biz types, and the crowds parted and there was Lady Gaga,” Fisher said. “She’s heading right towards me and she says, ‘Thank you. Your performance in American Hustle, Amy, was…' ”\n\nRealizing Gaga thought she was Adams, Fisher decided to roll with it. “It’s Lady Gaga,” she explained. “I love her so much, I [didn’t] want to tell her the truth. So I just gracefully thanked her [and] bowed my head.”\n\n56 of 62\n\nNina Dobrev and Victoria Justice\n\nComparisons between Vampire Diaries alum Nina Dobrev and former Victorious star Victoria Justice are nothing new for the brunette actresses.\n\n\"It's been happening forever!\" Justice told HuffPost in February 2013. \"I think it's flattering. She's so pretty, so it's very nice to be able to say that!\"\n\n57 of 62\n\nChace Crawford and Ian Somerhalder\n\nEither way, you can't lose: Both Chace Crawford and Ian Somerhalder have smoldering baby blues, cool coifs and wickedly handsome smiles. Despite their six-and-a-half-year age difference, the two actors could totally pass for twins.\n\n58 of 62\n\nJessica Chastain and Bryce Dallas Howard\n\nThe former The Help costars look so similar that there was once a rumor that Jessica Chastain and Bryce Dallas Howard were secretly sisters, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Though it isn't true, Howard's dad, Ron Howard, did once mistake Chastain for his own daughter.\n\nIn 2021, Chastain even made a TikTok video poking fun at their frequently mixed-up mugs.\n\n59 of 62\n\nZoe Saldaña and Thandiwe Newton\n\n\"I'll be walking down the street, and I'll have people go, 'Hey, Thandiwe Newton!' \" Zoe Saldaña revealed on an episode of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. Can we get these two cast as sisters soon?\n\nEven Saldaña's mom gets the two confused.\n\n\"My mom still thinks that I'm in Westworld,\" she said during a 2019 interview on The Late Late Show with James Corden, referencing Newton's role on the HBO series.\n\n60 of 62\n\nKaty Perry and Zooey Deschanel\n\nYes, they're both musical. Yes, they both have dark hair and big, pretty eyes. Yes, they've been in the same place at the same time. And yes, it sounds like Zooey Deschanel is over the Katy Perry comparisons. \"I'm happy that she's famous enough now that she's not going out and being mistaken for me,\" the New Girl famously told MTV in April 2009.\n\nHowever, during a joint Instagram Live video in 2020 with Deschanel (who starred in the singer's music video for \"Not the End of the World\"), Perry revealed how she leveraged their look-alike comparisons to her advantage.\n\n\"When I came to L.A., I was pretty much a nobody, and you were just getting so huge at that time — it was like Zooey Deschanel ran the world. ... In that moment, I was so complimented to look like you,\" she said. \"And I wanted to get into the club and I had no money, I had no clout, I had nothing, and sometimes I would pose as you to get into the club.\"\n\n\"I was turned up to 11 at the club,\" she continued. \"I'm sorry if I misrepresented you; I wanted to say that now.\"\n\n61 of 62\n\nJeffrey Dean Morgan and Javier Bardem\n\nIt's possible Jeffrey Dean Morgan got his role on Grey's Anatomy because the show's creator, Shonda Rhimes, thought she was hiring Javier Bardem. Morgan is basically everything The Counselor star is, with that olive complexion and facial scruff — he's just missing the Spanish accent.\n\n\"Jeffrey Dean Morgan, what a great actor. He's way more handsome than I am,\" Bardem said in a TikTok for Men's Health Magazine in March 2024. \"I'm always very pleased when people say we look alike because I think he's very handsome. I don't think he's getting the best part of that comparison.\n\nHe continued, \"We haven't met yet. I'm waiting for the day that we both will meet and say, 'Hey brother, how are you doing?' \"\n\n62 of 62\n\nLeighton Meester and Minka Kelly\n\nThose almond eyes! Those chestnut waves! That girl-next-door smile! Yes, Gossip Girl alum Leighton Meester and former Friday Night Lights star Minka Kelly have all the makings of bombshell look-alikes — which is why they were so well-suited for their 2011 thriller The Roommate, in which Meester actually posed as Kelly."
