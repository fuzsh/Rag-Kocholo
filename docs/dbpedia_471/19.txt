The Royal College of Art in the 1950s and early 1960s was the centre of the explosion of Pop Art culture, with Hockney and most of the other artists associated with the British Pop Art movement studying there. Peter Phillips organised the influential Young Contemporaries exhibition in 1961 at the RBA Galleries, where Hockney's paintings appeared in force alongside those by Boshier, Jones, Kitaj and Phillips himself, and Blake, Boshier, Boty and Phillips featured in Ken Russell's Monitor film 'Pop goes the Easel'. Developed in association with Grant Waters, Art Detective Group Leader: South East England, East England and the Midlands.
