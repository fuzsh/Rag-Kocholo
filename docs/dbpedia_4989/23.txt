Despite the fact that the Samsung Galaxy S6 is an older smartphone, itâs still quite impressive in its functionality and performance. It offers a fairly large 5.1-inch Super AMOLED display, a powerful octa-core Exynos 7420 Octa processor, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and plenty of internal storage space. The Galaxy S6 comes with 3GB of RAM, but gives you the choice of 32, 64, or 128GB of storage, although it does not offer a microSD card slot. The phone runs on a 2,550mAh battery, which is enough to get it through a workday if itâs handling lightweight applications and processes.
