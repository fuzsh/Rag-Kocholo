Over the past decade, the South Korean company has introduced several lines of handsets, including the S series of flagships, the A series of value-driven phones, and the Z series of innovative foldables, all of which I've had the fortune of testing and using as my daily driver at some point in time. And the July Samsung Unpacked event brought a new Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6, giving you even more choices for flipping foldable phones.\n\nAlso: The best Android phones you can buy right now\n\nSo, if you're in the market for a new phone -- and Samsung happens to be your brand of choice -- here's a curated list of the best models available right now.\n\nWhat is the best Samsung phone right now?\n\nAfter thoroughly testing the latest phones on the market, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra stands out as the best Samsung phone right now, with the company's top-of-the-line features and specifications including an S Pen stylus for precision inputs, a 200MP camera system, and the most durable display on any Galaxy phone yet. The size and abundance of features of the S24 Ultra may almost be overwhelming for some users, but if you want the best Samsung phone available now, look no further than this.\n\nThe best Samsung phones in 2024\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nBest display available in any smartphone\n\nReliable quad-camera setup\n\nBattery life remains among best in class\n\nAI features deliver new value\n\nCons\n\nCosts more than some premium laptops\n\nNo Qi2 magnetic charging\n\nCan be unwieldy for some, especially with a case\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\nBest Samsung phone overall\n\nSamsung's latest Galaxy S24 line is the first to go all-in on AI, and the S24 Ultra, the most premium of the three, impressed us the most. The new Galaxy AI model embedded in the device brings a host of generative capabilities, including real-time phone call translations, the ability to circle an object on screen to perform an image-based Google search, AI-assisted photo editing and transcriptions, and even a Chat Assist feature for figuring out how to phrase a message in different tones.\n\nLike its predecessor, the S23 Ultra, the S24 Ultra is built with a large 6.8-inch AMOLED display and a reliable 5,000mAh battery. Though the price has gone up to $1,299 ($100 more than the S23 Ultra), the phone's upgrades make it well worth it: The S24 Ultra is made of a lightweight yet durable titanium frame, compared to last year's aluminum, and features Corning's new Gorilla Armor.\n\nReview: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\nThe difference in display protection means the S24 Ultra is more glare-free than ever, which ZDNET reviewer Jason Hiner suggested: \"makes its screen more enjoyable to use than the iPhone 15 Pro Max and other flagship phones.\" Reddit users seem to agree with Hiner, including one who said he believes \"the anti-reflective glass really makes a difference.\"\n\nUnder the hood, the S24 Ultra includes an upgraded Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset for improved graphics and AI features, 12GB RAM (an increase from last year's 8GB), and 2,600 nits of brightness -- a big improvement over last year's 1,750. As for the new camera system, the big upgrade comes in the form of a 50MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. The results, as Hiner discovered, were sharper and less noisy images and an overall camera system that can pull in more light than ever before.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Ultra specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | Display size: 6.8 inches | Storage options: Up to 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP main, 12MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto (5x), 10MP telephoto (3x) | Front camera: 12MP | Battery: 5,000mAh\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nPolished and sleek designs feel better than ever\n\nSnappy performance with an Ultra-level processor and display\n\nExcellent battery life\n\n7 years of OS updates\n\nCons\n\nSamsung's software can be overbearing\n\nNo Qi2/faster charging speeds\n\nUncertainties with Galaxy AI features\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Plus\n\nBest Samsung phone for most people\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Plus may not be as flashy as its Ultra sibling, but at $300 less, it remains a formidable option for shoppers eyeing a meaningful upgrade. In fact, the core experience of the Ultra model is present in the Plus, as I found during my month-long testing of the mid-sized S24 model.\n\nFor example, Samsung's new Galaxy AI model and all of the useful features it brings (like real-time phone call translations and the ability to circle an object on screen to perform an image-based Google search), the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, 256GB of base storage, and a quad-camera system are present on both the Ultra and the Plus.\n\nReview: Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus\n\nFor most people, the Plus-sized Galaxy S24 is also less intimidating to use. Its 6.7-inch display is the ideal size for both casual consumers and power users, and compared to last year's S23 Plus, fields a sharper QHD, 1440 x 3088 resolution. As I noted in my full review, that's a major upgrade if you watch movies and videos on your phone, dabble with graphics editing, or read pages of text because everything looks sharper.\n\nAnother big factor is the price: The Galaxy S24 Plus starts at $999, the same as its predecessor -- even with all the hardware and software upgrades. On top of that, Samsung is now promising up to seven years of operating system updates for all Galaxy S24 models. One Amazon customer remarked, \"I got a terrific phone that looks phenomenal and will last me for at least seven more years.\"\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Plus specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | Display size: 6.7 inches | Storage options: Up to 512GB | Rear cameras: 50MP main, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto (3x) | Front camera: 12MP | Battery: 4,900mAh\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nPrice is very reasonable\n\nA 'jack of all trades, master of none' smartphone\n\nReliable 5,000mAh battery\n\nUp to five years of software and security updates\n\nCons\n\nLow-band 5G support\n\nUI can be sluggish at times\n\nCameras are not as capable as flagships\n\nSamsung Galaxy A35 5G\n\nBest Samsung phone under $400\n\nIf bang for your buck is what you're after, I'd say skip the S and Z series of devices and look to the Galaxy A35 5G. There are really three key reasons why you should buy the Galaxy A35 5G over any other sub-$400 phone: For the price you get a fantastic 6.6-inch AMOLED display that ramps up to 120Hz refresh rate, a triple-camera setup that includes a 50MP main sensor, and a beefy 5,000mAh battery.\n\nClearly, Samsung knows what features users value the most, and even if you have preferences beyond that list, my time testing the Galaxy A35 5G has left me with enough confidence that it will meet your mobile needs. Coming from the older A34 5G, the latest model features a glass backing, a more performant Exynos chipset, and an improved camera system. Reddit users seem to agree that the battery life on the A35 5G has been one of its bright spots too.\n\nAlso: Samsung Galaxy A35 5G\n\nThe A-series of smartphones also fall under Samsung's five-year commitment to software and security updates, which is a major advantage compared to competing phones by Motorola and OnePlus.\n\nSamsung Galaxy A35 5G tech specs: Processor: Samsung Exynos 1380 | Display: 6.6 inches| RAM/Storage: 6GB/128GB | Cameras: 50MP wide, 8MP ultrawide, 5MP macro, and 32MP front-facing camera | Battery: 5,000mAh\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nAI-powered Auto Zoom feature for photos\n\nIP48 water resistance\n\nLarger external display is game-changing\n\nThe most pocketable Galaxy phone yet\n\nCons\n\nNo telephoto camera\n\nExpensive, but generous trade-in offers abound\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6\n\nBest compact Samsung phone\n\nWhile the Z Fold 6 is the best Samsung foldable, it's the Z Flip 6 that will likely sell the most and appeal to the masses. Not only is the clamshell handset less expensive than the Z Fold but it's more compact and portable and has a more user-friendly learning curve.\n\nShape-shifting displays aside, the Z Flip 6 is very similar to the standard Samsung Galaxy S-series flagship, with a large 6.7-inch AMOLED panel that's crisp and bright, up to 512GB of RAM for those high-resolution pictures and videos, and a healthy 4,000mAh battery powering it all -- an upgrade from the Z Flip 5. There's also now a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset and the first vapor cooling chamber ever on a Z Flip device, both of which should make the phone run more efficiently, reducing battery drainage. The phone is thinner and lighter than previous models, too.\n\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6\n\nThe Z Flip 6's camera system gets a nice boost, too, with an improved 50MP main sensor and 12MP ultra-wide. You'll also find a new AI-powered Auto Zoom feature, which automatically detects how many people are in a frame, as well as potential background objects the user may want to be kept in the shot, and repositions digitally.\n\nThe Flex Window, or outer display of the flip phone, also gets some fun new features in the Z Flip 6, including interactive wallpapers, suggested replies to text messages, and a new Interpreter Mode for live translations.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | Main display: 6.7 inches | Cover display: 3.4 inches | RAM/Storage: 12GB RAM with 256GB/512GB internal options | Cameras: 50MP wide angle, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP selfie | Battery: 4,000mAh\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nAn innovative gapless folding design\n\nArmor aluminum material for a lighter and sleeker phone\n\nIP48 water resistance\n\nS Pen support\n\nImproved processor and AI/software optimized for foldables\n\nCons\n\nExpensive, but generous trade-in offers abound\n\nS Pen purchase and store separately\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6\n\nBest Samsung foldable phone\n\nThe 2020 Galaxy Z Fold 2 set the bar for foldable devices that also serve as mini-tablets. The Z Fold 3 improved on that phone with two of the most highly requested features from Fold users (S Pen support and IPX8 water resistance), while the Z Fold 4 improved the rear cameras and form factor of the phone, and the Z Fold 5 upgraded the processor.\n\nThe Z Fold 6, unveiled at Samsung Unpacked in July, brings the most polished version yet, with flatter edges, a wider internal display, and a lighter weight than its predecessor. It's also more durable, with a new Dual Rail Hinge design with improved shock distribution, a folding edge for enhanced resistance to pressure and sharp objects, enhanced armor aluminum for scratch resistance, and, for the first time, an IP rating for dust resistance, scoring at IP48.\n\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6\n\nOne of the biggest upgrades in the Z Fold 6 is the new Galaxy AI features, including Circle to Search, Note Assist, Interpreter (live translations and transcriptions), PDF overlay (transcribe and overlay copy on a PDF), Sketch to Image (apply generative AI on top of images), and more. These hybrid AI tools -- meaning they run on-device and on the cloud -- are powered by a new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip and 12GB of RAM.\n\nWhile the cameras on the Z Fold 6 are the same as the Z Fold 5, you will find new AI image processing and editing tools.\n\nThe Z Fold 6 is one of the most expensive phones on the market, starting at $1,900. However, Samsung has some good trade-in deals to drop the price down.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | Main display: 7.6 inches | Cover display: 6.3 inches | RAM/Storage: 12GB RAM with 256GB/512GB/1TB internal options | Cameras: 12MP ultrawide, 50MP wide angle, 10MP 3x telephoto, 10MP cover screen, 4MP under main display | Battery: 4,400mAh\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nAffordably priced and available unlocked\n\nLarge 6.5-inch display with all-day battery life\n\nExtensive software support\n\nCons\n\nPlastic build is not for all\n\nLimited to 128GB storage size\n\nMediaTek processor is just decent for performance\n\nSamsung Galaxy A15 5G\n\nBest cheap Samsung phone\n\nThe flashiest of smartphone features tend to exist only on flagships, but many will find appeal in Samsung's humble Galaxy A15 5G, which boasts 5G connectivity, a massive 5,000mAh battery, and a budget-friendly $200 price tag. That's a compelling package at a time when consumers are cutting down on spending.\n\nAlso: The best cheap 5G phones ZDNET's tested\n\nAnd don't let the lower cost fool you; the Galaxy A15 5G has all the specs you'd want for a feasible mobile companion, from the relatively sizable 6.5-inch 90Hz AMOLED display -- a rarity in this price range -- to the expandable storage (up to 1TB) to Samsung's four-year commitment to security patches. Oh, and this year's model gets a notable 5MP ultra-wide camera, an upgrade from last year's 2MP macro lens.\n\nI've been testing the Galaxy A15 5G model for a little more than a week, and while the phone won't feel like a million dollars, it's surprisingly sturdy to hold, and the 90Hz display looked great for app browsing and navigating around. One Best Buy customer review puts it best, \"(Galaxy A15 5G) is a 200 dollar phone... It's not gonna blow you away, but for the price, it packs a punch.\"\n\nSamsung Galaxy A15 5G tech specs: Processor: Mediatek Dimensity 6400+ | Display: 6.6 inches| RAM/Storage: 4GB/128GB | Cameras: 50MP wide, 5MP wide, 2MP macro, and 13MP front-facing camera | Battery: 5,000mAh\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nWhat is the best Samsung phone?\n\nWhile the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra sits at the top of this year's ranking list, here's a wider scope of ZDNET's best picks and their respective feature sets.\n\nSamsung phonePriceDisplayCamerasBatterySamsung Galaxy S24 Ultra$1,2996.8 inches200MP wide, 50MP with 5x optical, 10MP with 3x optical, and 12MP ultrawide, 12MP front-facing camera5,000mAhSamsung Galaxy S24 Plus$9996.7 inches50MP wide, 10MP with 3x optical, and 12MP ultrawide, 12MP front-facing camera4,900mAhSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6$1,8997.6 inches50MP wide, 10MP with 3x optical, and 12MP ultrawide, 10MP cover screen, 4MP under main display4,400mAhSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6$1,0996.7 inches50MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP front-facing camera4,000mAhSamsung Galaxy A35 5G$3996.6 inches50MP wide, 8MP ultrawide, 5MP macro, and 32MP front-facing camera5,000mAhSamsung Galaxy A15 5G$1996.5 inches50MP wide, 5MP ultrawide, 2MP macro, and 13MP front-facing camera5,000mAh\n\nWhy choose a Samsung as your smartphone of choice?\n\nWhile previous comparisons have placed Apple ahead of Samsung regarding the overall phone experience, Samsung is arguably the best option in 2024. One reason is the variety of models across different price points, from the A-series that encapsulates the sub-$500 market to the S-series for premium shoppers. Having tested the latest handsets from both brands (and others), the Samsung Galaxy continues to offer the most features and capabilities, at relatively competitive prices.\n\nConsidering its brand popularity, aftersales support is much more robust for Samsung, including a greater variety of cases and accessories and more certified repair technicians.\n\nWhich Samsung phone is right for you?\n\nFactors to consider when choosing a Samsung phone\n\nZDNET writers like myself spent months testing every phone in this best list, while also sourcing opinions and recommendations from industry experts and analysts who have also tested the devices. Here are the key factors that we look for when curating the top picks.\n\nDesign: Unlike how we would compare the best Android phones, comparing Samsung phones across different price points mostly boils down to the hardware. How a phone is designed, what material choices the manufacturer makes, and whether or not the device can take a hit or two are considered when picking the very best.\n\nCameras: The camera systems on Samsung phones have gotten really good over the past few years, so much so that you're well off even if you opt for a mid-ranger like the Galaxy A54.\n\nSpecial features: If there's one thing that differentiates most Samsung phones from other manufacturers, it's unique features. From the S24 Ultra with its built-in stylus and 200MP camera to the foldable screens of the Z Fold and Z Flip, you'll feel a sense of wonderment when using something that's built differently.\n\nAvailability: Samsung has a reputation for bringing the wildest phones to the press, even if they're not readily available. That's why, every pick on this list can be purchased at the time of writing, whether that's on Samsung's website or at a local carrier store.\n\nHow we test Samsung phones\n\nZDNET's review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every Samsung model, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and more. Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:\n\nDesign and ergonomics: How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.\n\nPerformance: Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, with all background tasks closed, and with as stable of a mobile connection as possible.\n\nCamera quality: ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.\n\nBattery life and charging: It's also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it (wired, wireless, or both).\n\nSpecial features: These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.\n\nPricing and availability: Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.\n\nFor a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive phone testing methodology page.\n\nWhat is the newest Samsung phone?\n\nThe newest Samsung phone is the Galaxy A35 5G, which offers flagship-esque qualities at a relatively affordable price. For $399, you get a 120Hz AMOLED display, a 5,000mAh battery, and more recent Android 14 software features. At its price point, you'll miss out on some of the newer Galaxy AI features, but it's a trade-off that many customers will likely be willing to make.\n\nWhich Samsung phone has the best camera?\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra has the best camera of any Samsung phone and one of the best overall cameras on the phone market. It features a 200MP main camera along with four accompanying cameras, which allow it to take extremely high-quality shots including close-up images and ones that are ultrawide. The S24 Ultra can also video record in up to 8K UHD quality at 30fps, making it one of the most capable phone cameras money can buy.\n\nIs Samsung S23 worth buying?\n\nA year later, the Samsung Galaxy S23 is still worth buying. Compared to this year's S series phones, the previous generation mainly falls short on Galaxy AI features and camera performance. But even then, for a now depreciated selling price, the Galaxy S23 covers a good 80% of the S24 experience. That makes it the perfect alternative to the latest Samsung phones, even if they're a year older.\n\nDoes Samsung have the best Android phone?\n\nOther Samsung phones we tested:\n\nBe sure to check out ZDNET's comparisons of the best phones and Android phones available. For your further consideration, I've also listed the top Samsung picks that didn't make it on the list below.\n\nView at Best BuyView at AmazonView at Samsung\n\nEditorial standards"
