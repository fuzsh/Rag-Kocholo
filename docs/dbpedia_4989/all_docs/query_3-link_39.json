        "text": "Overview and Dimensions\n\nGalaxy S6 was released by Samsung on Wednesday, April 1, 2015 and is powered by Android OS. By default, the device is shipped with a web browser â Chrome. Device dimensions are 70.5Ã143.4Ã6.8 millimeters (2.78Ã5.65Ã0.27 inches)1. The device weighs 138 g.\n\nGalaxy S6 has a Super AMOLED display with a 5.1-inch screen (71.5 cm2, 16:9 aspect ratio), and an approximately 70.7% screen-to-body ratio. The display is a touch screen, meaning that it supports touch events - interactions using a finger or stylus.\n\n1 - Property is displayed as width Ã height Ã thickness.\n\nScreen size, Viewport & Pixel Ratio\n\nGalaxy S6 has a 5.1-inch screen with a screen size (resolution): 1440px Ã 2560px , 360px Ã 640px viewport1, and a CSS Pixel Ratio of 4.\n\n1 - Property is displayed as width Ã height.\n\nKey points for development and testing\n\nBefore you start web development or testing, check that the web application supports a responsive viewport by using a viewport meta tag:\n\nYou can inspect this tag in the head section of an HTML document on Galaxy S6 right in the Blisk app. If this viewport tag is missing, the web application will not be responsive and will overflow the screen, hiding the content from users and leading to a bad user experience.\n\nThe form factor of the device represents its primary orientation as a portrait. Landscape orientation is popular on Galaxy S6 as well and should be seriously considered when you develop or test web applications on any mobile.\n\nYou also need to consider that the users will manipulate your web application on Galaxy S6 with a finger and stylus because this device has a touch screen that supports touch events. It is important to remember, that users may interact with multiple fingers (multi-touch) and gestures: single tap, multi-tap, swipe, pinch, stretch, zoom, etc. The users are highly likely to use gestures on small touch screens because of seamless interaction and great user experience."
