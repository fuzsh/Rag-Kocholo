        "text": "It’s understandable. You pride yourself on not being the type of person who always needs the latest and greatest gadgets. And you and your old phone have been through a lot: It still has all those grainy vacation selfies of your head blocking out some notable landmark. And with all the latest and supposedly greatest phones coming and going, it’s nice to feel the security that old faithful is still getting the job done. But it’s time to get serious. That relic has got to go. What should you replace it with? How about a new Samsung Galaxy S6? It’s okay to be scared of new things. But it’s time to take the leap to a new phone, and here a few reasons why the Samsung Galaxy S6 is the phone you’ve been waiting for.\n\nFor a start, do you remember when your old phone’s little screen wasn’t all cracked and broken? No. Of course not, because it’s been cracked since 15 minutes after you got it, when you dropped it on the pavement for the first of what would turn out to be many, many times. Well, the Galaxy S6, at only ¼ of an inch thick and weighing less than 5 ounces, will feel a little bit daintier than your old clunker, but don’t worry: This is no delicate flower. The Galaxy S6 is built from aluminum encased in rugged, shatter-resistant Gorilla Glass 4. So when you drop the Galaxy S6 15 minutes after you get it–and let’s face it, you know you’re definitely going to, butterfingers–it’s sure to survive.\n\nSpeaking of screens, no, the Galaxy S6 is not closer to your face. It’s just that the Galaxy S6’s high-definition AMOLED Quad HD screen measures 5.1 inches, which is way bigger than the dim, puny screen on your old phone. A ridiculous 577 pixels per inch, and a brightness of 600cd/mm adds up to a screen so bright and colors so bold it might take a minute for your eyes to adjust. But once you get used to it, you’ll appreciate it for what it is: A beautiful display.\n\nSure, the Galaxy S6’s main camera–armed with a 16 megapixel Sony Exmor RS IMX240 sensor, and assisted by some tweaks to the photo algorithms and a better f/1.9 lens–could be the best camera available on any smartphone anywhere, and it certainly will blow away whatever single-digit-megapixel camera on your old phone. The image stabilization and the HDR and the 1080p video are all great, but let’s get down to what’s really important: The 5 megapixel front camera is going to completely up your selfie game. It’s even got a wide-angle lens, so you can look thinner, or finally get a picture of a landmark that isn’t blocked by your head. But you may have to adjust the way you arrange your drunk friends to exclude the people you don’t want in your group selfie. And the quick-load camera function will ensure that you get the picture before you drop your phone, which, again, we all know you will. You have gotten really good at dropping things.\n\nSamsung has also incorporated wireless charging technology, so one place that you might WANT to drop your phone is on any WPC or PMA-supported charging pad. As for wired charging, it happens in a flash, providing 4 hours of use after only a 15 minute charge.\n\nYou know how long it takes for your old phone to go from taking a picture of your food, to posting it, and then to searching the web to find out if kimchi is gluten-free? Well that won’t be a problem anymore. Not with Galaxy S6’s octa-core (yes, “octa”) Exynos processor. This first-of-its-kind, lightning-fast processor, coupled with a trimmed-down version of the Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system and 3GB of RAM, ensures operation so smooth you won’t even have time to think about how long it used to take you to do–well, anything really–on your old phone.\n\nThis next part you might need to sit down for. There have been a lot of changes in the world of smartphones since you last upgraded. For instance, the Galaxy S6 has a fingerprint scanner for identification. Mind-blowing, right? Well not really. They’ve had these for a while, but previous ones didn’t work as well as this new one. Soon you will also be able to use Samsung’s new mobile payment service, called SamsungPay to make payments from your phone. If this makes you nervous–and you can check that using the heart monitor. Yes, there is a heart monitor on your new phone–don’t worry. The Galaxy S6 also features Samsung KNOX, a mobile security platform to keep your stuff secure.\n\nSo why choose to replace your old phone with a Samsung Galaxy S6 and not one of the other smartphones on the market? Well in the end, you’ll have the fastest phone, with the brightest display, and the best available camera. And since you’ll probably be hanging on to it for a while, why not choose the best?"
