Samsung later expanded the Galaxy S line to tablet computers with the announcement of the Galaxy Tab S in June 2014 and released the next month. The Samsung Galaxy Tab series is the related tablet line.\n\nPhones\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease timeline2010Samsung Galaxy SSamsung Galaxy 3Samsung Galaxy 52011Samsung Galaxy MiniSamsung Galaxy S IISamsung Galaxy Y2012Samsung Galaxy Mini 2\n\nSamsung Galaxy S III\n\nSamsung Galaxy S lll Mini2013Samsung Galaxy S4 Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini2014Samsung Galaxy S5 Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini2015Samsung Galaxy S6 Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge2016Samsung Galaxy S7 Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge2017Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung Galaxy S8+2018Samsung Galaxy S9 Samsung Galaxy S9+2019Samsung Galaxy S10 Samsung Galaxy S10+2020Samsung Galaxy S20\n\nSamsung Galaxy S20+\n\nSamsung Galaxy S20 Ultra2021Samsung Galaxy S21\n\nSamsung Galaxy S21+\n\nSamsung Galaxy S21 Ultra2022Samsung Galaxy S22\n\nSamsung Galaxy S22+\n\nSamsung Galaxy S22 Ultra2023Samsung Galaxy S23\n\nSamsung Galaxy S23+\n\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra2024Samsung Galaxy S24\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24+\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\nLegend:\n\nUnsupported\n\nSupported\n\nCurrent and supported\n\nUpcoming\n\nModel Announced Released Discontinued Supported Lifespan Date With Android version Ended Final OS Galaxy S March 23, 2010 June 4, 2010 2.1 Eclair March 6, 2012 January 10, 2012 2.3.6 Gingerbread 1 year, 7 months Galaxy S II February 13, 2011 May 2, 2011 2.3.4 Gingerbread April 8, 2013 4.1.2 Jelly Bean 1 year, 11 months Galaxy S III May 3, 2012 May 29, 2012 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich March 15, 2015 4.4.4 KitKat 1 year, 9 months Galaxy S4 March 14, 2013 April 27, 2013 4.2.2 Jelly Bean March 27, 2017 5.0.2 Lollipop 3 years, 11 months Galaxy S5 February 24, 2014 April 11, 2014 4.4.2 KitKat April 20, 2019 6.0.1 Marshmallow 3 years, 9 months Galaxy S6 March 1, 2015 April 10, 2015 5.0.2 Lollipop February 11, 2016 February 13, 2019 7.0 Nougat 3 years, 10 months Galaxy S7 February 11, 2016 March 11, 2016 6.0.1 Marshmallow April 21, 2017 April 7, 2020 8.0 Oreo 4 years Galaxy S8 March 29, 2017 April 21, 2017 7.0 Nougat March 11, 2018 May 4, 2021 9.0 Pie 4 years Galaxy S9 February 25, 2018 March 11, 2018 8.0 Oreo February 20, 2019 April 5, 2022 10 4 years Galaxy S10 February 20, 2019 March 4, 2019 9.0 Pie March 6, 2020 March 26, 2023 12 4 years Galaxy S20 February 11, 2020 March 6, 2020 10 January 29, 2021 April 2, 2024[1] 13 4 years Galaxy S21 January 14, 2021 January 29, 2021 11 February 25, 2022 expected 2026 H1 14 expected 5 years Galaxy S22 February 9, 2022 February 25, 2022 12 February 17, 2023 expected 2027 H1 14 expected 5 years Galaxy S23 February 1, 2023 February 17, 2023 13 January 31, 2024 expected 2028 H1 14 expected 5 years Galaxy S24 January 17, 2024 January 31, 2024 14 expected 2031 H1 14 expected 7 years\n\nSamsung Galaxy S\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original Samsung Galaxy S smartphone was announced in March 2010 and released on June 4, 2010.\n\nDisplay: 4.0\" Super AMOLED\n\nResolution: 480x800 pixels\n\nProcessor: Samsung Exynos 3110 (S5PC110)\n\nStorage: 2-16 GB (expandable)\n\nRAM: 512 MB\n\nBattery: 1500 mAh (user-replaceable)\n\nCamera: Back: 5 megapixels, 1x, 720p (HD) video; Front: 0.3 megapixels\n\nBack cover is replaceable.\n\nExpandable storage: Micro SD Card (SD HC, up to 32 GB)\n\nTouch sensors for navigation keys; no dedicated camera shutter button\n\nSamsung Galaxy S II\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Samsung Galaxy S II\n\nThe company announced the Samsung Galaxy S II on February 13, 2011.\n\nDisplay: 4.3\" or 4.5\" Super AMOLED\n\nResolution: 480x800 pixels\n\nProcessor: Samsung Exynos 4 Dual, Texas Instruments OMAP4430, or Qualcomm Snapdragon S3 APQ8060\n\nStorage: 16/32 GB (expandable)\n\nRAM: 1 GB\n\nCamera: Back: 8 Megapixels, 1x, 1080p (Full HD) video; Front: 2 megapixels; flash light added; located at center instead of corner\n\nBattery: 1650 or 1800 mAh (user-replaceable)\n\nBack cover is replaceable\n\nUSB On-The-Go (OTG)\n\nMobile High-definition Link (MHL) to HDMI\n\nExternal storage: MicroSD-HC Cards (up to 32 GB)\n\nAndroid 2.3.4,up to 4.1.2\n\nIn 2013, a \"Plus\" variant was released with only 8 GB of internal storage and slightly different chipset. It also features the TouchWiz \"Nature UX\" user interface, and the brushed dark blue colour variant (\"Pebble Blue\"), both known from the Galaxy S III.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S III\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Samsung Galaxy S III\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S III was announced on May 3, 2012. More than 70 million units of the Galaxy S III were sold, making it the one of the most sold S series phone. It features a split-screen feature whereby users can use two apps simultaneously (available from Android 4.1 up to 4.4.2 \"Premium Suite Upgrade\"),[2] an upgraded video player software which is first able to play in a movable and re-sizeable pop-up window for simultaneous watching during other tasks, and with motion thumbnails that can preview playing videos rather than only a static image,[3] an \"Ambient Light\" feature whereby the screen brightness can automatically adjust to the light level, a \"Smart Stay\" feature that can prevent the phone's screen from turning off by looking at the phone,[4] a personal assistant called S Voice,[5] the ability to tag faces in the phone's gallery,[6] an \"S Beam\" feature to transfer files via NFC,[7] an LED light on the front of the phone that can be used for notifications, a \"Motion Gestures\" feature whereby users can accomplish tasks by moving the phone,[8] color point effects for the camera,[9] and \"smart alert\" – an optional haptic feedback notification which vibrates the unit when picked up to notify the user.[10]\n\nThe Galaxy S III is the first Samsung mobile phone with wireless charging support that can be enabled using a special back cover that connects to dedicated pins under the rear cover.[11]\n\nLike its predecessor, its rear camera has eight megapixels (3264×2448) and 1080p video recording, though the S3 adds stereo audio recording, as well as the ability to simultaneously capture 6 megapixel (3264×1836) photos while filming, which is the image sensor's highest 16:9 aspect ratio crop. The front camera's video resolution has increased from 480p to 720p.[12] No megapixel label is present like on the predecessor.\n\nThe \"premium suite upgrade\" delivered by Samsung through the update to Android 4.1 later the year retrofitted the split-screen feature from the Galaxy Note 2, allowing two apps on screen simultaneously.\n\nDisplay: 4.8\" Super AMOLED\n\nResolution: 720x1280 pixels\n\nProcessor: Samsung Exynos 4 Quad, Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 MSM8960, or Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 MSM8228\n\nStorage: 16/32/64 GB (expandable with SD XC)\n\nRAM: 1 GB (S3 GT-I9300); 1.5 GB (S3 Neo GT-I9301); 2 GB (S3 LTE GT-I9305)\n\nCamera: Back: 8 megapixels, 1x, 1080p (Full HD) video at 30 fps; Front: 1.9 megapixels 720p (HD) video at 30 fps\n\nBattery: 2100 mAh (user-replaceable)\n\nFM radio receiver (GT-I9300 only)\n\nSamsung Galaxy S4\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Samsung Galaxy S4\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S4 was announced by Samsung on 14 March 2013. More than 80 million units of the Galaxy S4 were sold, making it the one of the most sold S series phone.[13] With Android 4.2.2, current 5.0.2. New features that this model has compared to its predecessor include:\n\nan infrared blaster that allows the phone to be a universal remote control[14][15]\n\na \"Smart Pause\" feature that pauses videos when nobody is looking at the screen[16]\n\na \"Smart Rotation\" feature whereby the screen rotation blocks itself by detecting the user's face[17]\n\na \"Smart Scroll\" feature whereby webpages automatically scroll by tilting the head or device[18]\n\na \"Story Album\" feature[19]\n\na barometer to measure the altitude level[20]\n\nthe ability to measure the ambient temperature[20]\n\nthe ability to measure the ambient humidity percentage[20]\n\na one-handed mode (available via update)[21]\n\nthe ability to increase the sensitivity for usage with gloves[22]\n\nan \"Air View\" feature that allows information to be shown by hovering the screen without touching it[23]\n\nan \"Air Gesture\" feature\" whereby users can control the device by moving the hand over the phone[24]\n\nthe option to adapt the phone to an optimal display[25] and optimal sound[26]\n\nthe ability to take a photo and record up to nine seconds of sound[27]\n\nthe ability to take a fast-motion photo and make a repeat effect[28]\n\nthe ability to take a photo and animate it[29]\n\nthe ability to erase parts of a photo.[30]\n\nthe ability to capture photos and record video simultaneously from both rear and front cameras, though stored picture-in-picture rather than in separate video tracks within a file or separate files; the camera order can be swapped while recording.[31][32]\n\nA \"remote viewfinder\" feature, where the camera viewfinder and controls can be cast to a different unit through Wi-Fi Direct.[33]\n\n\"Quick glance\", which allows checking the clock, missed calls, messages, and notification bar without touching the phone, by hovering above the proximity sensor.[34]\n\nThe Galaxy S4 is one of only two Samsung mobile phones to be equipped with thermometer and hygrometer sensors (the other being the Galaxy Note 3).\n\nSome praised the innovation inherent in all of the Galaxy S4's new features,[35] while others criticized it as feature creep.[36]\n\nThe resolution of the main (rear) camera was increased to 13 megapixels, and it is able to capture 9.6 megapixel photographs during video recording at 1080p. The front camera has 2.1 megapixels and its video resolution was increased to 1080p. Optional location-based contextual file names can facilitate later browsing.[37][38]\n\nDisplay: 5.0\" Super AMOLED\n\nResolution: 1920x1080 pixels\n\nProcessor: Samsung Exynos 5 Octa 5410 or Qualcomm Snapdragon 600\n\nStorage: 16 / 32 / 64 GB (expandable)\n\nRAM: 2 GB\n\nCamera: Back: 13 megapixels, 1x, 3840x2160p (4K UHD) video at 30 fps; Front: 2.1 megapixels, 1080p (Full HD) video at 30 fps\n\nBattery: 2600 mAh (user-replaceable)\n\nRemoved feature: FM radio\n\nIts variants are the rugged and water-resistant S4 Active, the lower-priced mid-class S4 Mini, as well as the hybrid S4 Zoom, which is equipped with an optical zoom lens with 10× magnification, more powerful Xenon flash, tripod mount, and rotary knob lens ring, combining a mobile phone with a dedicated digital camera.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Samsung Galaxy S5\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S5 was announced on 24 February 2014. It improves upon the Galaxy S4 by adding a heart rate monitor,[39] IP67 water resistance,[40] a fingerprint scanner,[41] the ability to record 4K videos (2160p at 30fps) and 1080p at twice the frame rate (60 fps),[42] phase-detection autofocus which is faster than previously used contrast detection, the ability to take better photos in low light levels,[43] a \"Download Booster\" feature to increase download levels to the maximum bandwidth allowed,[44] the ability to restrict the usage of battery by limiting the phone's usage,[45] and USB 3.0.[46] It lacks the thermometer (temperature) sensor, hygrometer (humidity) sensor, and \"Story Album\" features from the preceding Galaxy S4, but largely inherited Air View and gesture-related functionality. \"Quick glance\" was replaced with \"Air wake-up\", which allows waking up the smartphone from stand-by mode by hovering over the proximity sensor.\n\nDisplay: 5.1 Super AMOLED\n\nResolution: 1920x1080 pixels\n\nProcessor: Samsung Exynos 5 Octa 5422, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, or Qualcomm Snapdragon 805\n\nStorage: 16 / 32 GB (expandable)\n\nRAM: 2 / 3 GB\n\nCamera: Back: 16 megapixels, 1x, 3840x2160p (4K UHD) video at 30 fps, 1080p (Full HD) at 60 fps or slow-motion 720p (HD)at 120 fps; Front: 2 megapixels, 1080p (Full HD) at 30 fps\n\nBattery: 2800 mAh (user-replaceable)\n\nThe Galaxy S5 is the first Samsung mobile phone where the touch key on the left side of the home button is a task key instead of an option key, and the last mobile phone in the Galaxy S series to be equipped with a user-replaceable battery. The Galaxy S5 is the last mobile phone in the Galaxy S series with a micro-SIM card; later phones use a nano-SIM card.[47][48]\n\nSince the Galaxy S5, the model number (e.g. SM-G900F) is no longer displayed on the boot screen.[49]\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Samsung Galaxy S6\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 series marks a counter-utilitarian and fashion-oriented course in the Galaxy S series. It consists of four phones: the Samsung Galaxy S6, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Active. Samsung first announced the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge on 1 March 2015. On 13 August 2015, Samsung announced the Galaxy S6 edge+, along with the Galaxy Note5. The Galaxy S6 series improves upon its predecessors by adding the ability to quickly charge the phone with up to 15 watts using Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0,[50] virtual reality (compatible with the Galaxy Gear VR), a \"Smart Manager\" feature,[51] and the ability to customize the interface with themes.[52] It also features a new metal and glass build.\n\nFeature removals\n\nThe Galaxy S6 series removes several features, including some long-term key features, from its predecessors, such as the microSD card slot, Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) support, water protection, Air Gesture control, Air View, Smart Pause, Smart Rotation, Smart Scroll, the one-handed operation mode, increased sensitivity of the capacitive touch screen for use with gloves, and USB 3.0 support. In addition, the batteries in the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge are smaller than the battery in the Galaxy S5, and are not replaceable by end users.\n\nJustin Denison, then vice president of product strategy at Samsung, stated on stage at the Unpacked 2015 Episode 1 keynote event that they had opted for a built-in battery now that \"consumers could feel confident in charging their phones\".[53][54] The previous year, a Samsung commercial for the Galaxy S5 had mocked the iPhones' non-replaceable batteries, referring to iPhone users as \"wall huggers\", citing their incessant dependence on wall charging.[55]\n\nCamera\n\nIt is the first main model phone to feature optical image stabilization on the rear camera and also improves upon it with the brighter f/1.9 aperture that enables improved low-light performance for both photography and video recording, the first Samsung phone with a dedicated camera quick launcher (home button double-press) and also the first Samsung flagship device to capture slow motion video with audio and original framerate (120 frames per second) which can be edited in a precluded editor software accessible through the gallery software.[56]\n\nOther\n\nThe Galaxy S6 is the first mobile phone in the Galaxy S series with a nano-SIM card; earlier Galaxy phones use a micro-SIM card or \"standard\" (mini-SIM) card.[47][48]\n\nThe S6 Edge Plus, being released simultaneously with the Galaxy Note 5, is not equipped with an infrared transmitter for use as a remote control.\n\nDisplay: 5.1\" Super AMOLED (Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge); 5.7\" Super AMOLED (Galaxy S6 edge+)\n\nResolution: 1440x2560 pixels\n\nProcessor: Samsung Exynos 7 Octa 7420\n\nStorage: 32 / 64 / 128 GB\n\nRAM: 3 GB (Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge); 4 GB (Galaxy S6 edge+)\n\nCamera: Back: 16 megapixels, 1x, 3840x2160p (4K UHD) video at 30 fps, 1080p (Full HD) at 30/60 fps or slow-motion 720p (HD) at 120 fps; Front: 5 megapixels, 1440p (QHD) at 30 fps\n\nBattery: 2550 mAh (Galaxy S6); 2600 mAh (Galaxy S6 edge); 3000 mAh (Galaxy S6 edge+), 3500 mAh (Galaxy S6 Active) (non-replaceable)\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Samsung Galaxy S7\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S7 series, which consists of the Samsung Galaxy S7, the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and the Samsung Galaxy S7 Active, was announced on 21 February 2016. They improve upon the Galaxy S6 by adding an always-on display to optionally show information while the screen is off,[57] a \"Dual Pixel\" camera feature for faster autofocus,[58] and improved low-light photography.[59]\n\nWater resistance and a microSD card reader were added back,[60][61] both of which had been present on the Galaxy S5, and the latter also on all earlier iterations of the Galaxy S line, but neither present on the Galaxy S6. However, the IR blaster was removed from the Galaxy S7.[62] A single-handed operation mode was added back after removal on the S6, but without on-screen buttons and shortcuts present on the S5.\n\nCamera\n\nThe camera in the Galaxy S7 has 12 megapixels,[63] down from the Galaxy S6's 16 megapixels to achieve a larger pixel size on the image sensor, enabling it to capture more light under the same conditions.\n\nIts rear camera aperture of f/1.7 was the then brightest aperture on any mobile phone camera. Its front camera, although having the same resolution as the Galaxy S6's one (2592×1944 photo; 2560×1440p video), has a brighter f/1.7 aperture as well, compared to the f/1.9 on the Galaxy S6.\n\nThe five-minute time limitation for 2160p video present in preceding devices has been removed.[64]\n\nStorage\n\nIn the United States and some European markets, only the lowest storage option of 32 GB was shipped, meaning that the internal storage capacity has only doubled in the seven years since the 2009 Samsung i8000 Omnia II flagship which available with up to 16 GB.[65]\n\nDisplay: 5.1\" Super AMOLED (Galaxy S7); 5.5\" Super AMOLED (Galaxy S7 edge)\n\nResolution: 1440x2560\n\nProcessor: Samsung Exynos 8890 or Qualcomm Snapdragon 820\n\nStorage: 32 / 64 / 128 GB (expandable)\n\nRAM: 4 GB\n\nCamera: Back: 12 megapixels, 1x, 3840x2160p (4K UHD) video at 30 fps, 1080p (Full HD) at 30/60 fps or slow-motion 720p (HD) at 240 fps; Front: 5 megapixels, 1440p (QHD) at 30 fps\n\nBattery: 3000 mAh (Galaxy S7); 3600 mAh (Galaxy S7 edge) (non-replaceable)\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Samsung Galaxy S8\n\nSamsung announced the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphones on 27 March 2017. They feature an iris scanner, which was not present on the Galaxy S7 phones. S Voice has also been replaced by Bixby.
