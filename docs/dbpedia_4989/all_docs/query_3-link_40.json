        "text": "Samsung‘s Galaxy S series made its debut on June 4, 2010, and since then it’s become the phone line most people think of when Android is mentioned.\n\nNot all phones are created equal though, so with over a decade of Galaxy S devices on-tap we thought it would be a good idea to rank each generation in order from worst to best. We tried to balance the critical and commercial reception with the actual importance of each phone(s), the features and specs on offer, and our own gut feelings. We’ve also decided to only stick to the mainline releases, so that means no entries like the Galaxy S20 FE and Galaxy S4 Zoom.\n\nRelated: Best Samsung Galaxy deals\n\nIt goes without saying that this is all for a bit of fun, your opinions may vary! It’s also worth remembering that many of these phones are among the best the smartphone world has ever seen — being the worst of the very best is still pretty great.\n\nFor a more detailed look at the history of Galaxy S phones, be sure to read our retrospective here.\n\n15. Samsung Galaxy S6\n\n2015’s Galaxy S6 was a notable release for a couple of reasons. It marked the range’s first foray into the glass design territory popularized by the iPhone. It also saw Samsung match Apple in terms of pricing strategy, having generally been cheaper than the iPhone until this point. But the Galaxy S6 takes the wooden spoon in our rankings because it cut or compromised so many features seen on the Galaxy S5 in order to achieve this design. That meant no IP rating, no removable battery, no microSD support, and a much smaller battery.\n\nThe good\n\nPremium design\n\nExynos 7420 chipset was a beast\n\nGreat camera\n\nFingerprint reader that wasn’t terrible\n\nNative wireless charging (no special case required)\n\nThe bad\n\nTiny battery\n\nNo IP rating\n\nNo microSD expansion or removable battery\n\n14. Samsung Galaxy S\n\nSamsung\n\nThe phone that started it all, the Samsung Galaxy S (or Galaxy S1) seems laughable now when you check out the specs. A 1Ghz single-core chipset, 512MB of RAM, a 4-inch 480 x 800 screen. But this was pretty much as good as it got in the early days of Android, and it really was early. The biggest downsides were the uninspired design, gaudy software, and lack of a camera flash.\n\nThe good\n\nGreat browser back when Chrome wasn’t on mobile\n\nAs good as it got in terms of core specs\n\nThe bad\n\nNo camera flash\n\nBattery life wasn’t fantastic\n\nDull design\n\n13. Samsung Galaxy S2\n\nBetween the early nature of Android at the time and a general lack of polish, the Samsung Galaxy S1 fell just shy of greatness. Samsung’s second attempt in 2011, on the other hand, delivered one of the best Android phones to date. The Galaxy S2 offered a sturdy design, a removable battery, an OLED screen, and brisk internals. An accomplished, important step in Samsung’s ascent to the top of the Android world, the only reason it isn’t higher on this list is that Samsung US and its network partners created so many variants (Samsung Galaxy S2 Epic 4G Touch, anyone?) that finding a true Galaxy S2 (the GT-I9100) was an almost Sisyphean task.\n\nThe good\n\nRear camera could compete with iPhone lineup\n\n2MP selfie camera when VGA or 1.3MP was the norm\n\nWide variety of video formats\n\nOLED screen was pretty nifty\n\nThe bad\n\nMediocre battery life\n\nA ton of variants that created marketplace confusion\n\n12. Samsung Galaxy S4\n\nThe Galaxy S4 wasn’t just Samsung’s most popular Galaxy S series phone, it’s also the best-selling Android phone of all time. But it also felt like the moment when Samsung jumped the shark. The main culprit here was the TouchWiz skin, as Samsung ushered in a ton of bloatware and took an “everything and the kitchen sink as well” approach to its own software additions. Do you really need page scrolling via a head tilt? Or the ability to create a 5.1 surround sound system with six phones? That’s not to say that it didn’t have any interesting software additions, like “bothies” (yes, way before Nokia) and Drama Shot, but be honest, did you ever use even these novel features more than once?\n\nThe good\n\nRemovable battery with microSD card slot\n\nGood daytime picture quality\n\nGreat display\n\nThe bad\n\nBloated Android skin with many gimmicky features\n\nBasically Galaxy S3.1 in terms of design\n\nLow-light image quality paled in comparison to HTC One\n\n11. Samsung Galaxy S20\n\nIt seems like for every couple of positives about the Galaxy S20 series, there’s a negative. You’re getting a ton of features in general, impressive hybrid zoom (and periscope zoom on the Ultra), a gorgeous 120Hz OLED screen, 5G, good battery life, and 8K recording. But you’re also getting a hefty price tag (from $1,000 to $1,400), gimmicky 100x Space Zoom, no proper telephoto camera on the S20 or S20 Plus, and a take on One UI that’s starting to suffer from feature creep like Samsung skins of old. This is also the first Samsung Galaxy S series that completely ditched the headphone jack. Boo. Nevertheless, these were still some of the best Android phones at the time, and are worthy entries in Samsung’s ongoing smartphone dynasty.\n\nThe good\n\nClass-leading screens\n\n8K recording with the ability to extract 33MP frames\n\n120Hz refresh rate\n\nVersatile cameras\n\nGood battery life\n\nThe bad\n\nDisappointingly expensive pricing\n\nBig performance gap between Snapdragon and Exynos variants\n\nZoom capabilities were overstated\n\nNo 3.5mm port\n\nNo Galaxy S20e\n\n10. Samsung Galaxy S21\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nSamsung’s 2021 flagships go a long way towards fixing where the S20 series went wrong, but there are a few major missteps too. The Galaxy S21 series was $200 cheaper across the board, starting at $800 for the base S21 all the way to $1,200 for the S21 Ultra. The Ultra model was the star of the show here though, featuring two zoom-focused cameras (3X and 10X), S Pen support, and a main camera that doesn’t suffer from major autofocus issues like the S20 Ultra. The series does have a few downsides, as the S21 has a plastic back while the S21 and S21 Plus both lack QHD+ screens. All three phones also ditch the in-box charger, microSD expansion, and don’t support ultra-fast charging. Still, the price drop combined with an upgraded Ultra model seemed to deliver huge initial sales growth in the US.\n\nThe good\n\nGood screens with high refresh rate\n\nGreat picture/video quality\n\nCheaper than S20 series\n\nTwo zoom cameras on Ultra model\n\nS Pen support for S21 Ultra\n\nExynos chipset narrowed gap to Snapdragon SoC\n\nThe bad\n\nNo microSD card slot\n\nS21 and S21 Plus ditch QHD+ screens\n\nNo in-box charger\n\nPlastic back for Galaxy S21\n\nS21 and S21 Plus don’t see camera/charging/battery changes over last year\n\n9. Samsung Galaxy S22\n\nZarif Ali / Android Authority\n\nSamsung brought the S Pen to the S21 Ultra the previous year, but the S22 Ultra was a landmark release as it introduced an integrated S Pen slot too (in line with Note phones). The S22 Ultra also maintained S21 Ultra features like that 5,000mAh battery, 3x and 10x cameras (with improved quality), and a QHD+ screen. There was more to the S22 series than the Ultra model though, as Samsung also focused on improving the Galaxy S22 and S22 Plus while still maintaining the $800 and $1,000 price tags respectively. The base and middle models gained a new 50MP main camera along with a legitimate telephoto camera for improved zoom. However, the S22 and S22 Plus lost out in terms of battery capacity, with the base model being especially hard-hit.\n\nThe good\n\nS Pen slot makes S22 Ultra a true Note phone\n\nTrue tele camera on base and middle models\n\nGreat photo and video quality with improved low-light shots\n\nSnapdragon model is available in more regions\n\nSame price as the previous year’s phones\n\nAll phones get glass backs with Gorilla Glass Victus Plus\n\nThe bad\n\nSustained performance is disappointing on these phones\n\nThe base and middle models get a battery downgrade\n\nNo in-box charger once again\n\n8. Samsung Galaxy S23\n\nRyan Whitwam / Android Authority\n\nSamsung brought a few notable improvements to 2023’s Galaxy S flagships, starting with Snapdragon power across all regions. This is a pretty big deal as the Exynos variant of Galaxy flagships has usually always been the inferior model. This isn’t the only improvement, as the Galaxy S23 and S23 Plus received much-needed battery capacity boosts. Meanwhile, the S23 Ultra brought a crazy 200MP main camera to the table, delivering better image quality than the S22 Ultra’s 108MP sensor. Things stayed the same in almost every other area, though, making this an incremental release in many ways. It’s also worth noting that much like the iPhone 14 series, the Galaxy S23 range received price hikes in all regions bar the US.\n\nThe good\n\nSnapdragon power across all regions for the first time\n\nBattery capacity increases for standard and Plus models\n\n200MP camera for the Ultra model is a noticeable upgrade\n\nFast fingerprint scanner\n\nS23 Ultra still has an S Pen slot\n\nThe bad\n\nCustomers outside the US got price hikes\n\nLimited amount of RAM for the price\n\nNo charger in the box\n\nStandard model has slower charging speeds\n\n7. Samsung Galaxy S24\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nWe’d argue that the Galaxy S24 Plus is the main reason why the Galaxy S24 series is ranked higher than the Galaxy S23 range. Samsung’s middle phone is closer to the Ultra line than ever before thanks to a raft of upgrades (256GB of base storage, UWB, a QHD+ screen, and a bigger battery). Meanwhile, the base S24 feels like a modest upgrade at best over 2023’s model. The Korean brand also made the contentious decision to drop the Ultra line’s 10MP 10x camera in favor of a 50MP 5x shooter. All three phones pack impressive AI features, although these are coming to recent high-end Galaxy devices too. Finally, it’s worth noting that some S24 and S24 Plus models have an Exynos 2400 chipset, but this is still a good flagship processor.\n\nThe good\n\nGalaxy S24 Plus is close to Ultra-level\n\nGalaxy AI features are actually cool and useful\n\n5X camera on Ultra is mostly better than 10x camera\n\nSeven years of OS and security updates\n\nAll three phones get much brighter screens\n\nThe bad\n\nBase S24 is a minor upgrade over S23\n\nS24 and S24 Plus have the same cameras as previous year’s phones\n\nExynos 2400 processor could be better\n\nNo bundled charger, again\n\n6. Samsung Galaxy S9\n\nThe Galaxy S9 was essentially the Galaxy S8.1, which in turn shared some DNA with the Galaxy S7. It featured a similar glass design to the Galaxy S8, with lots of internal specs staying the same too. The Galaxy S series got a dual-camera setup for the first time, but this was restricted to the Galaxy S9 Plus. Other upgrades include native 960fps slow-motion recording, dual-aperture main cameras, and AR Emoji. The phones generally took a relatively safe approach at a time when rival HUAWEI dropped the innovative P20 Pro, and we saw plenty of more affordable flagships too. If we were just taking into account the Plus model, it’d rank above its direct predecessor, but as it is, the Galaxy S9 sits in a respectable place in the sixth spot.\n\nThe good\n\nSuper slow-mo could be cool\n\nFingerprint scanner was in a more convenient location\n\nHoly trifecta of a 3.5mm port, IP68, and wireless charging\n\nThe bad\n\nStandard Galaxy S9 was gimped (no secondary rear camera, less RAM)\n\nDesign was an evolution of S8, which wasn’t a huge change over S7\n\nBattery size didn’t see an increase over S8 series either\n\nDual aperture feature was interesting, but an evolutionary dead-end\n\n5. Samsung Galaxy S8\n\n2017 saw the vast majority of phones adopting an 18:9 screen ratio or higher. The Galaxy S8 family was no exception. It delivered plenty more gorgeous OLED screen while still feeling easy to hold. Samsung’s early 2017 flagships also saw the debut of a variety of features, such as DeX, the Bixby voice assistant, the much-maligned Bixby button, and an iris scanner that wasn’t as terrible as many thought it was going to be. The same can’t be said of the rear fingerprint scanner, however. How did anyone think that sticking it next to the camera was a good idea? Nevertheless, after a rough few months following the exploding Note 7 debacle, the Galaxy S8 series was a timely reminder that Samsung was still the top dog.\n\nThe good\n\nImproved photo quality due to multi-frame image processing\n\nFantastic design\n\nDeX genuinely brought a PC-like experience to the table\n\n3D Touch home button was a great replacement for a physical button\n\nThe bad\n\nNo dual cameras when rivals had it for a year\n\nBixby button couldn’t be remapped at first\n\nFingerprint scanner location was awful\n\nAverage battery life\n\n4. Samsung Galaxy S3\n\nThe Galaxy S/Galaxy S1 may have started the series and the Galaxy S2 may have shown us that Samsung’s camera team could compete with Apple, but the Galaxy S3 was the high point for the firm’s first few flagships. The Galaxy S3 delivered an interesting plastic design, a retooled, nature-themed TouchWiz UI with a few neat features (Smart Stay to keep the screen on, a popup video player), and speedy internals. Taken together, you had the range’s first real iPhone killer in terms of both sales and overall quality.\n\nThe good\n\nPowerful internals\n\nRemovable battery and microSD support\n\nGreat camera\n\nSome useful software additions\n\nThe bad\n\nTouchWiz UX not as smooth as many other Android skins\n\nPlastic design didn’t feel as premium as metal or glass\n\n3. Samsung Galaxy S10\n\n2019’s Galaxy S10 family had something for everyone, from the more affordable Galaxy S10e to the Galaxy S10 Plus with all the bells and whistles, and even a souped-up 5G model. This something-for-everyone approach resulted in some of the best Galaxy flagships ever. It also marked the first year of Samsung offering multiple cameras on all devices, a long-overdue move when the likes of LG, HUAWEI, and Xiaomi had dual cameras or more for a couple of years already. Toss in slick punch-hole designs, the debut of the One UI skin, and gorgeous OLED screens, and there was a lot to like here.\n\nThe good\n\nFlexible camera setups on all models\n\nClass-leading OLED screens\n\nThe Galaxy S10e with its great specs and price\n\nLast Galaxy flagships with headphone jacks\n\nIP68 rating and wireless charging\n\nThe bad\n\nCameras were good but not great (especially at night)\n\n15W charging is slow compared to most rivals\n\nIn-display fingerprint sensor was hit-and-miss\n\n2. Samsung Galaxy S5\n\nWas 2014 the best ever year for smartphones? If it is, then some credit has to go to the Galaxy S5, which saw Samsung bringing its A-game. The Galaxy S5 was the first mainline Galaxy flagship with water resistance, but it didn’t come at the expense of a removable battery or microSD support. This was also one of the first Samsung phones with 4K recording (following the Galaxy Note 3). Furthermore, the phone’s real-time HDR capability was a great addition at a time when HDR photography on most phones was still a slow, blurry mess. The only big disappointment was the swipe-based fingerprint scanner, which paled in comparison to the iPhone 5S’s touch-based scanner. A beloved phone that just misses out on the top spot by a hair.\n\nThe good\n\nWater resistance\n\nRemovable battery and microSD support\n\nGreat image quality with real-time HDR\n\nThe bad\n\nSwipe-based fingerprint scanner wasn’t as intuitive as touch-based scanners\n\nMicro-USB port requires a plastic flap to seal against water damage\n\n1. Samsung Galaxy S7\n\nThe best Galaxy S series of all time addressed all of the Galaxy S6 series’ glaring issues, and boy did it fix a lot. Bigger batteries? Check. Water resistance? Yep. MicroSD expansion? Indeed. Otherwise, the Galaxy S7 series also delivered a similarly capable 12MP main camera, 240fps slow-mo (matching the iPhone), and speedy internals. A top seller and a textbook case of meaningful evolution and not just iteration for iteration’s sake, the Galaxy S7 also served as the antithesis of the iPhone range at the time. All hail the Galaxy S7.\n\nThe good\n\nWater-resistant design\n\nWireless charging\n\nMicroSD expansion\n\nGreat photo/video quality\n\nThe bad\n\nGlass design easily attracts fingerprints\n\nMicro-USB when major rivals switched to USB-C\n\nThat’s it for our Samsung Galaxy S series rankings!
