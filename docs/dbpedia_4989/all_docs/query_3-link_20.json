        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wonder if this community can help me! I have had my Samsung galaxy S8 for several years and I love it. It's always on silent mode and so never makes a sound unless I'm playing multimedia or it vibrates lightly when I get a call. But recently something must have changed. Several times a day the phone makes a sound like a notification alert. Everytime it does it I go into notifications trying to track down the culprit but there is never any log of recent notifications. I've checked in exceptions too and nothing. I also checked the card payment feature as I heard that can cause sounds and I do keep my debit card in my phone case but that was turned off and I tested by taking my card out of the case and it still makes the sound occasionally. Multimedia volume is on (and I want to keep it that way as I am sure the sound will go away if I reduce this volume but that's a workaround and I need to find the source of this sound!) All other volumes (Bixby, call, notifications, system) are at zero. I'm at my wits end you guys! Does anyone know how I might be able to find out what's causing this mystery sound? Thanks in advance!\n\nSolved! Go to Solution.\n\nThank you for reaching out. I can certainly understand the frustration that comes with random notifications noises when you have no notification. I would be happy to look into this further for you. The first step I would recommend is testing your device in safe mode. If your phone or tablet is misbehaving, it's possible that a third-party app is causing the issue. To figure out what app is acting funny, you can use the Safe mode feature. In Safe mode, your device won't run any third-party apps.
