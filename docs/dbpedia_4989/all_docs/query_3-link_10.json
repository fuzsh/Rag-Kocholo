Built for those who want to clear their to-do lists quickly to make time for what’s most important to them, the Galaxy Tab S6 helps users do more and get the most out of their days.\n\n“Today’s inspiration comes at a moment’s notice and creatives and professionals need a device able to keep up with insatiable imaginations while complementing their busy, on-the-go lifestyles,” said DJ Koh, President and CEO of IT & Mobile Communications Division at Samsung Electronics. “Galaxy Tab S6 enables consumers to unlock their creativity, while delivering the top-quality productivity features and advanced technology they have come to expect from Samsung tablets.”\n\n(Click here for hi-res B-roll)\n\nRedesigned S Pen Boosts Creativity and Productivity\n\nSamsung’s signature S Pen began as an instrument for writing and drawing, but it has evolved to become the ultimate creativity and productivity partner. Now with remote control functionality and wireless charging capabilities, the S Pen on Galaxy Tab S6 is an even more powerful tool for creating and getting things done. With built-in Bluetooth remote control features[1] including a gesture function called S Pen Air Action, the S Pen lets you intuitively take selfies and videos, or scroll through multimedia content or your creative portfolio, even when your tablet is out of reach. Best of all, it comes included right in the box.\n\nPlus, the S Pen makes taking notes a breeze, and delivers enough battery life[2] to get you through a day full of presentations, notetaking, translations, and creativity after just ten minutes of charging. Handwritten Samsung Notes can be converted to digital text and exported to formats like Microsoft Word with just one click.

The keyboard has been fine-tuned for better functionality, including an S Pen holder, free angle stand, touch pad and new function keys.\n\nUncompromised Entertainment\n\nWhether you are enjoying a new game or binge-watching your favorite TV show, Galaxy Tab S6 delivers an amazing viewing experience. Its 10.5” Super AMOLED display works in tandem with quad speakers tuned by AKG and Dolby Atmos to keep you completely immersed in the action. And with its compact 5.7mm slim body that is both lighter and more portable than ever, you can take your entertainment with you wherever you go.\n\nGalaxy Tab S6 enables high-quality, captivating gaming through a combination of graphics, sounds, and intelligent hardware and software, bolstered by partnerships with leading game platforms like Unity and Unreal Engine. A powerful processor and Game Booster with AI capabilities enhance the gaming experience on Galaxy Tab S6 through optimized FPS, screen lag, loading time and more.\n\nWith Galaxy Tab S6, you can enjoy more of your favorite content.
