        "text": "What we know so far\n\nSamsung's next big flagship, the Galaxy S25 Ultra, is expected to hit the shelves in early 2025. As a successor to one of the best Android phones currently available, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will have the tough job of recapturing the magic by surgically implementing improvements and upgrades to the established formula.\n\nEven though it is still early days for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, we have already got a handle on a few key details about the phone. And for the things we are not sure about, we can make some educated guesses based on past trends.\n\nWe are expecting the Galaxy S25 Ultra to feature a durable titanium build and Corning's glare-free glass for added toughness. While the design should mostly follow the flat look of its predecessor, the new Ultra model is likely to have rounded edges. It will probably include an integrated S Pen and maintain IP68 water and dust resistance.\n\nThe display might stick to 6.8 inches and will almost certainly keep rocking a Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel, with its super-smooth 1-120Hz refresh rate. Hopefully, Samsung will bump up the maximum brightness even further for better visibility outdoors.\n\nIt terms of performance, it is almost a given that we will find Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip under the hood. There is always a chance this chip might be only in US units, leaving room for an Exynos version elsewhere in the world, but to be honest, that is pretty unlikely.\n\nWhen it comes to the battery, we are hoping for better battery life with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. However, we are not expecting a much larger battery because of space constraints. Faster wired charging would be great, but it’s likely we'll see the return of 45W charging support.\n\nWe expect the Galaxy S25 Ultra to cost as much as the current model does. As a refresher, the Galaxy S24 Ultra starts at $1,300 for the 256GB version and goes up to $1,660 for the 1TB option.\n\nNow, let's delve deeper into all the expectations surrounding the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra. You can also take a look at all the available information about the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S25.\n\nAre you excited about the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra?\n\nI'm thrilled, can't wait! Moderately excited Nah, same old, same old...\n\nI'm thrilled, can't wait!\n\n64.43%\n\nModerately excited\n\n17.9%\n\nNah, same old, same old...\n\n17.67%\n\nJump to section:\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra release dateGalaxy S25 Ultra priceGalaxy S25 Ultra cameraGalaxy S25 Ultra storageGalaxy S25 Ultra designGalaxy S25 Ultra displayGalaxy S25 Ultra batteryGalaxy S25 Ultra features and softwareGalaxy S25 Ultra hardware and specsShould you wait for the Galaxy S25 Ultra?\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to be unveiled in January or February 2025. Samsung has a tradition of launching its flagship series at the start of the year, so this timeline fits right in.\n\nSamsung typically releases its new smartphones about two weeks after the official announcement. Depending on the timing, the actual release date could easily spill over into February.\n\n* - probable dates\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra price\n\nWith the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung could go one or two ways: either make it pricier or leave the price tag unchanged. Seeing how the current Galaxy Ultra model scored a $100 price increase this year, we find it a bit difficult to believe that Samsung will go for another price increase for a second year in a row.\n\nIf previous Galaxy launches are anything to go by, there could be multiple ways to save on the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra. For example by trading-in a device or pre-ordering the phone. US carriers typically also offer deals and bonuses on new Samsung flagships.\n\nSo, what kind of pricing and deals should we expect for the Galaxy S25 Ultra from Samsung and the major carriers?\n\nFor starters, when the Galaxy S24 Ultra launched, Samsung offered trade-in programs with credits of up to $750. For the Galaxy S25 Ultra, you can likely expect a similar trade-in deal, so if you’ve got an eligible device to trade in, you could save a significant amount on your upgrade.\n\nIf you go with a carrier plan, the deals get even sweeter for the current model and should be similar for the next one. For instance, Verizon's Device Payment Program offers $800 off if you pick the Unlimited Ultimate plan before ordering your new device and trading in any Samsung smartphone.\n\nAt T-Mobile, you can snag up to $600 off through 24 monthly bill credits when you add a new voice line on a qualifying ONE, Magenta, or Go5G plan. AT&T has some fantastic offers, too. For instance, with the current model, you can get up to $1,000 off with a suitable unlimited plan and an eligible trade-in device valued at just $95 or more.\n\nSo, as you can see, there are plenty of ways to grab a flagship Galaxy smartphone at a lower price, and similar deals will likely be available for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, too.\n\n* - anticipated prices\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra camera\n\nAccording to well-known and reliable tipster Revegnus, Samsung might put a 1-inch 200MP ISOCELL image sensor on the Galaxy S25 Ultra's main camera. For cameras of most types, a bigger sensor guarantees better results, so if true, this could be quite exciting.\n\nEquipped with 0.8µm pixels, dual-pixel autofocus and in-sensor crop zoom, this new ISOCELL sensor could potentially bring serious improvements to the flagship's photo capabilities.\n\nWe believe, and rumors back it up, that Samsung will stick with pretty much the same camera setup as the previous model. Just to jog your memory, here's the camera setup from the last one, laid out in the table below.\n\n*-probable specs\n\nWhen it comes to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, it's safe to assume that AI will have an even bigger part to play in mobile photography and videography. This year, Samsung went all in on artificial intelligence and machine learning to step up its photography game with its top-notch \"cameraphone\".\n\nAnd as if that weren't enough, we can also expect the usual software tweaks and image-processing algorithm upgrades that come around every year. This means that we can expect better low-light performance, upgraded image stabilization and, hopefully, even better portrait capture capabilities. Oh, and maybe even 100x Space Zoom, even without the 10X periscope camera!\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra storage\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra could be the first phone to feature Samsung's UFS 4.04-lane storage chip, which could theoretically support nearly 8GB/sec. This means nearly double the 4GB/s of the UFS 4.0 standard that's currently used on most phones.\n\nAccording to an existing Samsung roadmap, the faster storage is expected to be available in 2025. In our opinion, that would definitely amp up the device's performance and it could also be a big boost for Samsung's on-device Galaxy AI.\n\nWe anticipate the base version of the Galaxy S25 Ultra to offer 256GB of storage, with options for 512GB and 1TB also likely available. There are also rumors suggesting a higher-end model with 16GB of RAM alongside the base configuration with 12GB of RAM.\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra expected storage capacity:\n\n256 GB\n\n512 GB\n\n1TB\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra design\n\nA recent report offered more insight into the possible design changes for the upcoming Ultra model, showing renders of it alongside the current version. The Galaxy S25 Ultra appears to be moving toward rounded edges, giving it a look that’s more in line with the Galaxy Note series.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra (on the left) next to the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra (on the right) and Samsung’s next flagship with the S Pen (the second image) | Image credit – Ice Universe\n\nMoreover, recently, Samsung leaker Ice Universe hinted at a design twist for the Galaxy S25 Ultra's middle frame. Instead of sticking to a fully straight or curved frame, it’s expected to have a rounded back and a straighter front near the display. This asymmetrical design could give the phone a fresh look and feel.\n\nOn the other hand, according to a leak from late March 2024, Samsung is allegedly considering four potential designs for the Galaxy S25 Ultra. While mostly similar, the prototype variants differ in terms of bezel thickness and frame curvature.\n\nOverall, the phone could either go the iPhone way and fully adopt a flat frame like the Galaxy S24/Galaxy S24 Plus, or remain similar to the Galaxy S24 Ultra model and boast a slightly curved frame.\n\nOne other thing we are pretty sure about is that Samsung isn't ditching the titanium frame. It was a major highlight of the Galaxy S24 Ultra, so we expect it to stick around for several future generations, too.\n\nNaturally, you can count on other staples like the built-in S Pen and IP68 water and dust resistance sticking around in the Galaxy S25 Ultra specs sheet.\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra display\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to come along with a 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, which will be similar to its predecessors. The resolution of this OLED display will probably remain at 1440 by 3080 pixels, delivering a very decent sharpness of over 500ppi. This, in turn, means that you won't be able to distinguish between individual pixels.\n\nIt is safe to assume that the display could be super-smooth thanks to LTPO 3.0, allowing it to switch between 1 and 120Hz on demand.\n\nOne of the best new features of the Galaxy S24 Ultra was the exclusive Gorilla Glass Armor, which mostly eliminated glares and as a result greatly boosted the outdoor legibility of the screen. This feature turned out to be a fan-favorite and we totally get why, as such: we sincerely hope it makes a comeback.\n\nDisplay brightness is the new megapixel war with manufacturers constantly trying to outshine each other. With this trend showing no signs of slowing down, it's reasonable to expect Samsung to equip the Galaxy S25 Ultra with an even brighter display than its predecessor.\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra battery\n\nA recent report suggests that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will retain the same battery size and charging speed as its predecessor. Mainly due to space constraints, we expect Samsung to put a 5,000mAh battery inside the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\n\nYet, if the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 proves to be efficient enough, we might still see an improvement in battery life. Additionally, a new rumor suggests that Samsung might introduce a feature called Battery AI. This feature is said to provide an additional 5% to 10% of runtime to the phone.\n\nWe hope Galaxy S25 Ultra features faster charging than the 45W wired one of its predecessors. While neither the Galaxy S24 Ultra nor the Galaxy S23 Ultra charged slowly (both are capable of topping up in roughly about an hour), there's always room for improvement.\n\nHopefully Samsung will consider adding faster wireless charging to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, too. Currently, the top Samsung flagship phone charges at up to 15W with an official charger.\n\nWe don't expect to see a charger in the Galaxy S25 Ultra box and historical data suggest that neither should you.\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra features and software\n\nBy the time Galaxy S25 Ultra arrives, we should have witnessed the arrival of both Android 15 and the derived from it One UI 7. We might even see One UI 7.1 on the upcoming flagship phone. Details about either of these are scarce, but they should deepen the software's reliance on generative AI and machine-learning.\n\nGalaxy AI, which debuted with the Galaxy S24 series, is certainly coming back with the Galaxy S25 too.The S25 Ultra will undoubtedly be the best way to experience Samsung's planned enhancements to generative on-device and cloud-based artificial intelligence.\n\nGalaxy AI is one of our favorite new features of this year's Galaxy lineup. We hope that Galaxy AI not only sticks, but also blooms to future Galaxy phones, such as the S25 Ultra.\n\nThanks to Samsung's new seven-year software support policy, we certainly know that the upcoming phone will be supported for at least seven years. This means the Galaxy S25 Ultra could be supported until 2032. This includes both major Android updates as well as security patches.\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra hardware and specs\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we are mostly certain the Galaxy S25 Ultra will come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip. Built by TSMC, we expect the chip to become announced later in 2024. It may very well turn out to be Qualcomm's first 3nm chip, matching the Apple A17 Pro in this coveted metric.\n\nCurrently rolling under the \"Tongzi\" moniker, this chip will swap ARM's Cortex cores for Qualcomm's new CPU cores. As per the rumors and leaks, we might not see any efficiency cores on the chip, which will instead consist of two performance Phoenix CPU cores and six medium-performance CPU cores.\n\nThe two performance cores on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 might be clocked as high as 4GHz. That would be a serious upgrade over the 3.3GHz of the Cortex-X4 of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.\n\nAdditionally, a leaked GeekBench 6 benchmarking test claims that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 has achieved 2845 points in GeekBench's single-core test and 10628 points in the multi-core one. These results are higher than the 7249 score of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and the 7281 result that the A17 Pro chip of the iPhone 15 Pro Max has scored.\n\nWhile Samsung typically equips its flagships with either Snapdragon or Exynos chips depending on the region, such a split has never occurred with its Ultra models. So, we think an Exynos-powered Galaxy S25 Ultra is just a mirage.\n\nShould you wait for the Galaxy S25 Ultra?\n\nYou should wait for the Galaxy S25 Ultra if you are using an older phone and have held off from upgrading to the Galaxy S23 Ultra or the Galaxy S24 Ultra. While it is too early to say for sure, the S25 Ultra shows potential to become a significant improvement that is worth waiting for until early 2025.\n\nYou should not wait for the Galaxy S25 Ultra if you use a Galaxy S23 Ultra or a Galaxy S24 Ultra. Even if you use an older device, be it a non-Galaxy Android or an iPhone, unless you need a top-of-the-line Android phone with potentially numerous AI features, the Galaxy S25 Ultra may not be the right pick for you.\n\nFollow us on social media to catch the latest trending stories, watch exclusive videos, and join the conversation with our vibrant community!\n\nPhoneArena Weekly\n\nEnjoy the hottest mobile tech storylines, delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.\n\nFCC OKs Cingular\\'s purchase of AT&T Wireless"
