        "text": "Samsung has officially launched its Android 14 update, One UI 6, with new features, updated design, and more. Here’s everything that’s new, a list of Samsung Galaxy devices getting Android 14, and everything else you’ll need to know.\n\nWhat’s new in Android 14 on Samsung Galaxy?\n\nAndroid 14 is, in itself, a not-so-major update, but it does bring some key changes to the world’s most popular smartphone operating system. Those changes, which we’ve previously detailed, include additions such as support for UltraHDR, improvements to the share menu, lockscreen changes, official support for flash notifications, and more.\n\nMany of the features new on Pixel phones, though, have been in place already on Samsung smartphones, such as the new lockscreens. So what’s new on Galaxy?\n\nOne UI 6 is Samsung’s latest Android skin, and built on top of Android 14 it brings some notable changes such as the new “Quick Panel” design for Quick Settings, an option to change the wallpaper based on the time of day or certain modes, expansions to the lockscreen customization options, a new camera widget, new weather widgets, as well as new emoji and a new default system font.\n\nHere’s everything new in Samsung’s Android 14 update [Gallery]\n\nSamsung devices with Android 14 – The full list\n\nOn October 30, 2023, Samsung officially launched its Android 14 update to its current flagship phones, just 26 days after Google Pixel devices were updated. That’s six days after last year’s release, but much faster given Pixels were updated much earlier in 2022.\n\nHere’s the full list of Samsung Galaxy devices that currently have Android 14.\n\nThis list will be continuously updated over the coming months with the latest additions marked in bold text. Check back regularly!\n\nGalaxy S devices with Android 14\n\nIn October 2023, Samsung started pushing One UI 6 to the Galaxy S23, S23+, and S23 Ultra in select countries across the globe. This primarily started in Europe, but has since expanded globally including the United States. In mid-November, Samsung expanded the update to the Galaxy S22 series, as well as to the newly-released Galaxy S23 FE, but only on Exynos models, and the update has also shown up on Galaxy S21 devices.\n\nGalaxy S23\n\nGalaxy S23+\n\nGalaxy S23 Ultra\n\nGalaxy S23 FE\n\nGalaxy S22\n\nGalaxy S22+\n\nGalaxy S22 Ultra\n\nGalaxy S21\n\nGalaxy S21+\n\nGalaxy S21 Ultra\n\nGalaxy S21 FE\n\nOf course, the newly-released Galaxy S24 series also comes with Android 14 out of the box.\n\nGalaxy Foldables with Android 14\n\nOn November 21, Samsung started rolling out Android 14 to its latest foldables, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Galaxy Z Flip 5, and as of December it’s widely available. By the end of December 2023, Samsung has launched updates for Galaxy Z Fold 3/Flip 3 as well as Galaxy Z Fold 4/Flip 4, which completes the company’s Android 14 rollout for foldables.\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 5\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 5\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 4\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 4\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 3\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 3\n\nGalaxy A and Galaxy M devices with Android 14\n\nThe first Galaxy A series device to get the One UI 6 update was the Galaxy A54, which picked up the update on AT&T in the US on November 21. A day later, the Galaxy A73 was updated in Iran, and the super-affordable Galaxy A34 and Galaxy A14 5G weren’t too far behind. Samsung has also since released Android 14 for the Galaxy A24 and Galaxy A53. The Galaxy A52s has also been updated in most regions including Europe and India, and towards the end of December, the Galaxy A52 has also been updated.\n\nBy January, we’ve seen further rollouts to more devices. The full list of Galaxy A series devices with Android 14 includes:\n\nGalaxy A54\n\nGalaxy A53\n\nGalaxy A34\n\nGalaxy A24\n\nGalaxy A14 LTE\n\nGalaxy A14 5G\n\nGalaxy A73\n\nGalaxy A33\n\nGalaxy A23\n\nGalaxy A13\n\nGalaxy A52s\n\nGalaxy A52\n\nGalaxy A72\n\nGalaxy A05s\n\nGalaxy A04s\n\nMeanwhile, in Samsung’s Galaxy M series, the Galaxy M53 has been updated in Germany, while Galaxy M34 has been updated in India. The list below will be updated as more devices get updated.\n\nGalaxy M53\n\nGalaxy M54\n\nGalaxy M34\n\nGalaxy Tablets with Android 14\n\nOn November 22, Samsung released its first Android 14 update for a tablet, with the Galaxy Tab S9 series now eligible to be updated in most countries, as is the Galaxy Tab S8 series in select regions.\n\nIn December, Samsung has also released the One UI 6 update for its newest tablets, the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Tab S9+ FE, as well as expanding it to other regions on Tab S8.\n\nGalaxy Tab S9\n\nGalaxy Tab S9+\n\nGalaxy Tab S9 Ultra\n\nGalaxy Tab S9 FE\n\nGalaxy Tab S9+ FE\n\nGalaxy Tab S8\n\nGalaxy Tab S8+\n\nGalaxy Tab S8 Ultra\n\nGalaxy Tab A8\n\nGalaxy Tab S7 FE\n\nGalaxy Tab A7 Lite\n\nGalaxy Tab 4 Active Pro\n\nGalaxy Tab S6 Lite\n\nWill my Galaxy device get Android 14?\n\nOf course, not every Samsung smartphone or tablet will get Android 14. The update is being provided in line with Samsung’s current update policy. That means any flagship released since 2021 is eligible, as they all have at least four major Android OS updates. The 2020-released Galaxy S20 series, Galaxy Note 20 series, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Galaxy Z Flip/5G however, will not be updated as Samsung has confirmed following a slip-up on the company’s part.\n\nGenerally speaking, any Samsung smartphone or tablet released in the past two years will be updated to Android 14. For slightly older devices, the update will still be available, but only to the more expensive hardware such as the Galaxy S, Galaxy Z, and Galaxy Tab S lineups.\n\nSamsung Android 14 update schedule\n\nThe state of Samsung’s official schedule for Android 14 and One UI 6 updates has been a little hit or miss, with one schedule being removed early on. But, in November, the company posted a pretty official-looking schedule to its Samsung Members app in some countries, which gives us a good idea of what to expect.\n\nThe list below is based on Samsung’s official Android 14 schedule, and we’re constantly updating it as new devices are updated.\n\nIf last year’s Android 13 update is anything to go by, Samsung will likely blow through its core lineup well before 2024 rings in.\n\nOctober 2023\n\nGalaxy S23 – October 30\n\nGalaxy S23+ – October 30\n\nGalaxy S23 Ultra – October 30\n\nNovember 2023\n\nGalaxy S22 – November 20\n\nGalaxy S22+ – November 20\n\nGalaxy S22 Ultra – November 20\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 5 – November 21\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 5 – November 21\n\nGalaxy A54 5G – November 21\n\nGalaxy A34 5G – November 23\n\nGalaxy S23 FE – November 22\n\nGalaxy Tab S9 – November 22\n\nGalaxy Tab S9+ – November 22\n\nGalaxy Tab S9 Ultra – November 22\n\nGalaxy A73 – November 22\n\nGalaxy Tab S8 – November 25\n\nGalaxy Tab S8 5G – November 25\n\nGalaxy Tab S8+ – November 25\n\nGalaxy S21 – November 25\n\nGalaxy S21+ – November 25\n\nGalaxy S21 Ultra – November 25\n\nGalaxy A14 5G – November 27\n\nGalaxy A53 – November 28\n\nGalaxy M53 – November 28\n\nGalaxy A24 – November 29\n\nDecember 2023\n\nGalaxy Tab S9 FE – December 5\n\nGalaxy Tab S9+ FE – December 5\n\nGalaxy S21 FE – December 5\n\nGalaxy A52s – December 5\n\nGalaxy A14 LTE – December 5\n\nGalaxy A33 – December 5\n\nGalaxy M33 – December 6\n\nGalaxy F34 – December 10\n\nGalaxy M34 – December 11\n\nGalaxy M54 – December 14\n\nGalaxy F14 – December 14\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 4 – December 18\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 3 – December 18\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 4 – December 18\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 3 – December 18\n\nGalaxy F54 – December 18\n\nGalaxy A52 – December 20\n\nGalaxy A23 – December 22\n\nGalaxy M23 – December 22\n\nGalaxy F23 – December 26\n\nGalaxy XCover 6 Pro – December 26\n\nGalaxy Tab 4 Active Pro – December 27\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nGalaxy M13 – January 2\n\nGalaxy A72 – January 5\n\nGalaxy Tab S6 Lite (2022) – January 5\n\nGalaxy A14 5G – January 11\n\nGalaxy Tab A7 Lite – January 16\n\nGalaxy F13 – January 30\n\nGalaxy A13 – January 30\n\nGalaxy Tab S7 FE – January 25\n\nGalaxy Tab S7 FE 5G – January 25\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nGalaxy A05s – February 8\n\nGalaxy A04s – February 19\n\nMarch 2024\n\nGalaxy Tab A8 – March 2\n\nLast updated 3/12"
