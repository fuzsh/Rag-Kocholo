        "text": "Hello LiseAndreasen,\n\nThanks for reaching out to the Chromecast Community forum! Let's sort this out.\n\nA few questions: are you casting your phone's screen to the TV? Are you getting any messages when downloading the Google Home app? What's the OS version of your mobile phone?\n\nI'll look forward to your response.\n\nBest,\n\nJennifer\n\nI am e.g. using the built in Chromecast functionality in the YouTube app, or the Disney+ app. To cast to a TV.\n\nI can't download the Google Home app. Not available for my phone.\n\nAndroid version 7.0.\n\nThe chromecast logo sort of comes and goes. Sometimes it helps to restart the app or the phone.\n\nHi LiseAndreasen,\n\nThanks for getting back to us. To set up and use your Chromecast and the Google Home app, you need to have an Android phone or tablet with Android 8.0 or later. Check out this support website article to learn more.\n\nYou can try to use a different mobile device to download the Google Home app and set up your Chromecast device.\n\nRegards,\n\nJennifer\n\nHi LiseAndreasen,\n\nJust one quick final follow up since activity has slowed down. We'll be locking the thread in the next 24 hours, but if you still need help, I would be happy to keep it open. If there's more we can do, just let me know.\n\nBest,\n\nPrincess"
