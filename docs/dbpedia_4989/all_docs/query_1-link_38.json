        "text": "For a while now we’ve heard whispers of a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra and a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE, but now yet another model has been leaked, possibly dubbed the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim.\n\nThis was initially mentioned by Ross Young (a leaker with a good track record), who claimed on X that this Z Fold 6 Slim might have a bigger screen than the standard Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and that – as the name suggests – it would probably be thinner.\n\nApparently it won’t have a digitizer – the layer of plastic or glass in the screen that supports stylus inputs – meaning it won’t support the S Pen, but that’s how Samsung will be able to slim it down, according to Young.\n\nInterestingly, the price will supposedly be similar to that of the standard Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Young adds that this Slim model will probably ship in early 2025, alongside the Samsung Galaxy S25. That would be well after the standard Z Fold 6 will probably land, as we’re expecting that in July, alongside the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6.\n\nYoung also says there’s a chance that this is the rumored Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra, and that its eventual name is unconfirmed. Though if it is the Ultra, we’d expect a higher price than the base Z Fold 6.\n\nIn any case, this isn’t the only talk of a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim. Galaxy Club (via SamMobile) has claimed that they’ve seen evidence of both a ‘Q6 Slim’ and a ‘B6 Slim’. Based on Samsung’s typical naming schemes the former would probably be the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim, and the latter would likely be a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 Slim.\n\nOne phone, many names\n\nOddly, they’ve also seen mention of a ‘Q6 Slim Pro’, which might therefore launch as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim Pro. Could Samsung really have all these devices on the way? Well, probably not. Galaxy Club speculates that the Z Fold 6 Slim, the Z Fold 6 Slim Pro, and the Z Fold 6 Ultra are all the same device, and that Samsung simply hasn’t settled on the final name yet.\n\nSo whether Ultra, Slim, Pro, or Slim Pro, there may well be an additional Z Fold 6 model to choose from – one that’s thinner and possibly bigger than the standard Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6. That said, aside from a reported wait until 2025 for it, we’ve also previously heard that the Z Fold 6 Ultra might be exclusive to South Korea, so you may not be able to buy it.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 Slim is more mysterious, because this is the first we’ve heard of any additional Z Flip 6 models. A previous leak did point to a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, but that would likely be positioned as a cheaper model than this.\n\nBut very little is known about this Galaxy Z Flip 6 Slim, and there’s every chance this one could also be exclusive to South Korea. Hopefully, we’ll find out more soon.\n\nYou might also like"
