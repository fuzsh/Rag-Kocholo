Here are all the major Samsung Galaxy phones currently available, with the newest models first.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 | £1,049\n\nThe new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 was announced in July as part of the Samsung Unpacked event. The flip-phone is perfect for people who want to make a statement with their smartphone — the 1990s are totally back in fashion after all — and its cover screen is a compact 8.6cm, making it the perfect pocket size.\n\nThe upgraded Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 also has a 50MP back camera (the same specification as the Samsung Galaxy S24) and a 10MP front camera. Its design bears a 10% improved scratch resistance, plus four new colourways: Mint, Blue, Yellow and Silver Shadow and three online-only colours: Peach, Crafted Black and White.\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 at Samsung\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 | £1,799\n\nThe all-new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 bridges the gap between a smartphone and a tablet. When it's open, the brilliant display is great for reading e-books, using the S Pen on the GoodNotes app, and streaming your favourite series and movies.\n\nWhen it's closed, it functions as a perfectly normal smartphone that, thanks to the lightest and thinnest design yet, can slip comfortably in the pocket.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 has a Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 display, which is the same as the Samsung Galaxy S23 smartphone series. It also boasts a new cover screen ratio allowing for a bar-type viewing experience. And of course, comes with all-new Samsung Galaxy AI.\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 at Samsung\n\nSamsung Galaxy A35 | £339\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A35 is the latest for the tech company's mid-range, coming in four new \"Awesome\" colourways: Awesome Ice Blue, Awesome Lemon, Awesome Lilac, and Awesome Navy.\n\nIt has a 6.6-inch display – just a tad smaller than the Samsung Galaxy S24+ – with a Full HD Super AMOLED screen and 120Hz refresh rate. Plus, a Premium glass back and a 50MP camera.\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy A35 from £339 at Samsung\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy A35 from £339 at Currys\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy A35 from £339 at John Lewis\n\nSamsung Galaxy A55 | £439\n\nLike the A35, the A55 is mid-priced and is obviously less advanced than members of the S or Z range. However, it has a sleek design and good speed, making it perfect for everyday use.\n\nIt also shares the S24’s floating three-camera design and has been designed to take clearer and more vibrant photos even in the poorest lighting conditions thanks to AI Image Signal Processing (ISP). The device also has a new Night Portrait mode and 12-bit HDR video to ensure that, no matter the time of day, you’re always looking your most glam and comes with a metal frame to improve durability.\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy A55 from £439 at Samsung\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy A55 from £439 at Currys\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy A55 from £439 at John Lewis\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 | £799\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 is the cheapest option from the brand-new S Series. It comes in four colours: Onyx Black, Marble Grey, Cobalt Violet and Amber Yellow and, thanks to Samsung's slimmest bezels yet, has an immersive 6.2-inch display. The phone comes with Samsung Galaxy AI, which can do everything from record transcripts and summarise notes to the very exciting Circle to Search function, in which you circle an object from any image or website, and your phone will tell you exactly what or where it is.\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy S24 from £799 at Samsung\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy S24 from £799 at Currys\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy S24 from £799 at John Lewis\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24+ | £999\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24+ is slightly bigger than the S24 at 6.7-inches (as oppose to the S23+'s 6.6). Like the other members of the S24 range, it has Samsung Galaxy AI, a 200MP camera and excellent durability with a strengthened aluminium frame.\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy S24+ from £999 at Samsung\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy S24+ from £999 at Currys\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy S24+ from £999 at John Lewis\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Ultra | £1,249\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is the crowning jewel of the S24 range. With the company's first ever Titanium frame, their brightest-ever 6.8-inch flat screen and four new sleek colourways: Titanium Black, Titanium Grey, Titanium Violet and Titanium Yellow, it's a mightily impressive bit of kit.\n\nThat's all before you delve into the matter of Samsung Galaxy AI, which can live translate phone calls in other languages, alter the tone of your sentences and edit photos. Plus, it has Samsung's first 5x optical zoom camera which has automatic slow-mo and expert nightography.\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra from £1,249 at Samsung\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra from £1,249 at Currys\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra from £1,249 at John Lewis\n\nSamsung Galaxy S23 FE, December 2023 | £599\n\nSamsung rounded up their 2023 with the release of the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE. This Fan Edition version of the S23 series shares a lot of the positives with the high-end model. For instance, the camera, although only 50MP to the S23's 200MP, comes with a 3X optical zoom and an after dark, “Nightography” mode, which lets you take clear selfies and portraits at all hours. It also comes with a 4,500mAh battery that can charge up to 50% in just 30 minutes and, most importantly, is significantly cheaper in price.\n\nBuy Samsung Galaxy S23 FE from £599 at Samsung\n\nBuy Samsung Galaxy S23 FE from £599 at Currys\n\nBuy Samsung Galaxy S23 FE from £599 at Argos\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5, July 2023 | £1,049\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 has a compact cover screen that comes in at 3.4-inches, and you can do a whole host of things on it without the need to open your phone, such as answer calls and check the weather.

Compared to the previous members of the A series, it also has a brighter screen (at 1,000 nits) and a new 'eye-caring' display to prevent the damaging effects of the phone's blue light.\n\nThe camera is also improved with new light boosting technology to bring out the light in photos and produce much crisper images.\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy A34 from £349 at Samsung\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy A34 from £349 at Amazon\n\nSamsung Galaxy A54, March 2023 | £449\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A54 has a smaller screen than the A34 (6.4 inches compared to 6.6) and also comes in white. It's prices are a little higher, starting at £449, which is due to features such as the phone's 50MP camera and 8GB of RAM.\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy A54 from £449 at Samsung\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy A54 from £449 at Currys\n\nSamsung Galaxy S23, February 2023 | £849\n\nPart of Samsung's new S23 Series, the Samsung Galaxy S23 is the most affordable smartphone from the trio, coming in at £849.\n\nIt has a 6.1-inch display and comes in four different colourways: Phantom Black, Cream, Green, and Lavender. Plus, all of the colours are sourced from plants as part of Samsung’s eco-conscious initiative, which has also seen the manufacturer endeavour to prevent 15 tons of fishing nets from entering the ocean this year. The S23 Series includes 12 recycled internal and external components, too - a 100 per cent increase on the S22’s six recycled internal components.\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy S23 from £849 at Samsung\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy S23 from £849 at John Lewis\n\nSamsung Galaxy S23+, February 2023 | £1,049\n\nAlso new to the S series is the 6.6-inch display Samsung S23+. When we got hands-on with the S23 Series, one feature particularly stood out to us: the camera. The 200MP back-facing camera is high-quality enough to print out photos and create canvases, and the 12MP front-facing camera has super HDR. The brand new adaptive pixel sensor and double OIS camera improves taking photos in the dark, too, as it is more stable in comparison to the S22.\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy S23+ from £1,049 at Currys\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy S23+ from £1,049 at JD Williams\n\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, February 2023 | £1,249\n\nIf you're a gamer, you'll love the brand new Samsung Galaxy S23 Series.

The S23 Ultra automatically adjusts and enhances the colour and light when you’re gaming in different lights, too.\n\nAnd there's even more: the Ultra even comes with the S Pen to take photos, write notes and more.\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra from £1,249 at Very\n\nBuy the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra from £1,249 at Argos\n\nLooking for a saving on Samsung devices?
