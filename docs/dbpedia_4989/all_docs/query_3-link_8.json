        "text": "I'm in a bit of a pickle and could really use some guidance. Recently, I accidentally deleted some crucial contacts from my Samsung Galaxy, and I'm desperately trying to recover deleted contacts from Samsng Galaxy.\n\nI've tried searching through my phone's settings and exploring various apps, but I haven't had any luck so far. I've heard that there might be ways to recover deleted contacts using specialized software or through cloud backups, but I'm not sure where to start or which methods are reliable.\n\nIf anyone has experience with recovering deleted contacts from Samsung Galaxy, I would greatly appreciate any advice or tips you could offer.\n\n@WisonLee\n\n1. If you have previously backed up your contacts to your Samsung account, you can try restoring them:\n\nGo to \"Settings\" on your Samsung Galaxy.\n\nScroll down and tap on \"Accounts and backup\" or \"Accounts.\"\n\nSelect \"Samsung account.\"\n\nTap on \"Restore data.\"\n\nChoose \"Contacts\" and select the backup file you want to restore from.\n\nFollow the on-screen instructions to complete the restoration process.\n\n2. If you have enabled Samsung Cloud backup on your device, you might be able to recover deleted contacts from Samsung Galaxy there:\n\nGo to \"Settings\" on your Samsung Galaxy.\n\nScroll down and tap on \"Accounts and backup\" or \"Accounts.\"\n\nSelect \"Samsung Cloud.\"\n\nTap on \"Restore data.\"\n\nChoose \"Contacts\" and select the backup file you want to restore from.\n\nFollow the on-screen instructions to complete the restoration process.\n\nThese methods rely on previously enabled backup options on your Samsung Galaxy device. If you haven't enabled any of these features before, unfortunately, there might not be a free built-in method to recover deleted contacts from Samung Galaxy. Regularly backing up your contacts in the future can help prevent data loss.\n\n@WisonLee Most Android users have backup from Google service as it is an integrated part of Android OS. It is straightforward process to recover deleted contacts from a Samsung Galaxy device using Google Backup if you had previously synced your contacts with your Google account.\n\nTo restore the contacts, first, ensure that your device is connected to the same Google account used for the backup. Open the \"Settings\" app, go to \"Google\" > \"Set up & restore\" > \"Restore contacts.\" From there, select the Google account you want to restore from, and choose the device backup containing the contacts you want to recover. The restored contacts should reappear in your Contacts app.\n\n@WisonLee If the contacts were deleted recently from your Galaxy phone, you can also use Google's \"Undo changes\" feature to recover them. To recover deleted contacts from Samsung Galaxy phone with this new feature, go to your Google Contacts on a web browser (contacts.google.com), click on the \"Settings\" (gear) icon, and select \"Undo changes.\" You can choose to revert your contacts to any point within the last 30 days.\n\nOnce you've undone the changes, your contacts will automatically sync back to your Samsung Galaxy device. This method is effective as long as the contact deletion happened within the 30-day window.\n\nP.S. Also go check if there is a local backup on your phone with Smart Switch app. It is Samsung's official tool for device backup and restore.\n\n@WisonLee\n\nThis method of restoring contacts through Google account is very simple. If you usually sync contacts to Google account, it is basically 100% possible to recover deleted contacts on Samsung galaxy. I have encountered a similar situation before. I accidentally deleted several important contacts, but I easily solved it through Google account.\n\nOperation steps:\n\nOpen Google Contacts:\n\nIn your computer or mobile browser, type contacts.google.com, and then log in to the Google account you used to sync your Samsung phone.\n\nAfter logging in, find the \"More\" option in the left column and click it.\n\nNext, click \"Undo changes\". This feature allows you to restore contacts to a previous point in time.\n\nThe system will ask you to select a time range, such as \"10 minutes ago\", \"1 hour ago\" or \"10 days ago\". Select a time point when you think the contacts are still there, and then click \"Undo\".\n\nIn this way, Google will sync the contacts at the selected time point back to your phone.\n\nAfter completing the operation, reopen your Samsung phone and make sure that the Google account is still synchronized. Then refresh the contacts app and you should be able to see the lost contacts.\n\nI also accidentally deleted some contacts that time, and after thinking about it for a while, I remembered that I could restore them through Google account. Follow the steps above and it will be done in a few minutes. All the contacts are back. It is a lifesaver. So, if you have the habit of syncing Google account, you can really try this method directly, the success rate is super high!"
