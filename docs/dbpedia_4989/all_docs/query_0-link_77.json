To my surprise, doing a factory reset didn't actually delete everything from the phone so I went into recovery mode and did a \"Wipe data/factory reset\" from there.\n\nAfter restarting the phone and connecting to a WiFi network I'm asked to enter my Samsung Account, which I did, but I can't get past this screen! When I click on the \"Sign In\" button this is what happens:\n\nThe dialogs disappear and nothing happens. If I put a wrong password it tells me the password is wrong but when entering the correct one I can't get past this. I tried doing a factory reset again, unlocking the device from my Samsung account (which fails because it says remote access is not enabled or something like that) and even removing the device from my Samsung account. I also tried multiple methods that you can find online to bypass this but none of them work on Android 7 (Nougat).\n\nI don't know what else to do, my device is just unusable now."
