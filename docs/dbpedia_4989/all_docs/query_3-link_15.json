        "text": "Hi,\n\nI recently bought a Tab S6 for my partner but am having a problem with the WiFi.\n\nIt will be connected fine then randomly out of the blue the internet will stop working and the WiFi symbol will have an exclamation mark next to it.\n\nThe only way to fix it is to disconnect and reconnect WiFi - untill it happens again.\n\nAll my other devices connect to the same WiFi network fine without any problems.\n\nAny help please?\n\nThanks\n\nHi @SaudA ,\n\nI've had the problem since buying the tablet, although I updated it to the latest Android version right at the beginning, so I couldn't tell you if it was ok before the update.\n\nYeah, I've tried forgetting the network and resetting network settings.\n\nThanks\n\nHi @AndrewL,\n\nYes I've tried that, connecting to a different WiFi network. I've even tried a factory reset without installing any additional apps and it still did it.\n\nI mentioned about installing the latest Android version because I've read about people with this problem say it came about after the last Android update?\n\nThanks\n\nSame problem here too....and after your last comment they are quiet.... nothing new with Samsung. Making us to buy their expensive products which are not proper working and their \"help\" to get the issue fixed are only \"connect to a different network\", \"factory reset\" or \"software update\"! For help like this I don't need to contact them! They know there is a big problem with WiFi which can't get fixed with one of their \"problem solutions\"!\n\nI would like to add that this issue has plagued my Tab S4 since new and also my Galaxy S8. Both devices have been through many updates and been factory reset. The router is a Fritzbox 7490 and it has been factory reset and had several firmware updates also. On a friend's Huawei router both devices seemed ok. Because of this I gave up trying to fix it some time ago. I suspect it may be a weird compatibility issue with Samsungs wifi hardware. Btw, no other devices on my network have this issue. Unfortunately Samsung`s solutions never went beyond reset, upgrade firmware or try another router. When I recently bought a new TV recently I decided I couldn't risk another flakey Samsung wifi device so I bought a Sony. The Sony works flawlessly on wifi.\n\nSorry not much help, but a bit of background info. If you're still in warranty you might want to consider invoking it as I don't see another solution. You could try another router, maybe at a friends place.\n\nGood luck."
