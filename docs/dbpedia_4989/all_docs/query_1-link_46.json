        "text": "Alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Samsung also announced the Galaxy Z Flip 6 at its Unpacked event Wednesday. With last year’s Galaxy Z Flip 5, the company introduced a major redesign, so it’s focusing on under-the-hood upgrades with the new flip phone. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 features meaningful upgrades like better camera hardware and packing a bigger battery in a similar design.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 6 Features Subtle But Useful Design Upgrades\n\nAt first glance, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 might seem the same as the Flip 5, but there are a few noticeable changes. For instance, the camera module now features the same color as the body, giving it a bolder look. Like the Galaxy Z Fold 6, the Flip 6 sports flatter sides as well. These give it a boxier but comfortable in-hand feel.\n\nAt 85.1 x 71.9 x 14.9mm (3.35 x 2.83 x .59) folded and 165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9mm (6.5 x 2.83 x .27 inches) unfolded, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is slimmer than its predecessor but weighs the same 187 grams (6.6 ounces). I got to play around with it for 30 minutes, and it felt like a light but premium phone. The back has a nicer feel to it, too.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 is also IP48 dust and water-resistant, as opposed to the IPX8 rating on the Flip 5. This means the new Samsung flip phone is protected against a limited amount of dust ingress (particles measuring 1mm or more) at 4, whereas the Flip 5 didn’t feature dust resistance. It’s also protected against water with its 8 rating, which means it can withstand immersion in water up to 1m for a limited time.\n\nSimilar to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, the Flip 6 no longer features a deep crease on the folding display. It has a new hinge design that helps minimize the crease while keeping the sturdiness intact. In my hands-on time, I noticed the crease only in certain lighting conditions. It’s much better than the Galaxy Z Flip 5 crease.\n\nBetter Performance And Bigger Battery\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 “for Galaxy” chipset, paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of storage.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 gets a RAM boost alongside the processor upgrade. If the Galaxy S24 is any indication, you should expect great performance and good battery life on the new Flip — more so because it packs a bigger, 4,000mAh battery (vs. 3,700mAh on Flip 5). It’s the same cell capacity as the Galaxy S24, so I’m hoping to see an improvement over the Galaxy Z Flip 5’s battery life.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 should also provide better gaming performance for longer sessions because Samsung has added a vapor cooling chamber for the first time to its Flip lineup.\n\nMeaningful Camera Upgrades And AI\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 sports a new camera setup. You get a 50MP primary camera with dual-pixel autofocus and an 85-degree field of view, which is a significant upgrade over the aging 12MP camera found on the Flip 5. It is accompanied by a 12MP ultrawide camera with a 123-degree field of view, which remains the same as before.\n\nSamsung has also added meaningful AI upgrades to the camera. For instance, it can now recognize your position and zoom in or out for the best framing choice. The Auto Zoom feature will zoom in automatically if you are nearer to the frame and zoom out when farther away.\n\nLike the Galaxy Z Fold 6, you get an AI-powered Portrait Mode that uses AI to clear outlines, create authentic facial expressions and produce natural bokeh. Another useful AI feature is Interpreter: Conversation mode, where the outer display shows the translated conversation to the other person while the inner display shows the translation from their language to yours.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6: Everything Else\n\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 features the same 3.4-inch Super AMOLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate and a 6.7-inch Full HD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 2,640×1,080 resolution.\n\nIt introduces a new feature called interactive wallpaper on the cover screen that responds to touch and movement. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 also includes a Photo Ambient feature on the cover screen, which changes based on the time and weather. You get all other AI features found on the Fold 6, such as Photo Studio, sketch-to-image generation and more.\n\nThe 4,000mAh battery charges at the same 25W speed, which is rated to reach 50% charge in 30 minutes. You also get support for wireless charging and wireless power sharing. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3 and 5G with both nano SIM and eSIM.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6: Price and Availability\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 has received a price bump, now starting at $1,100. Pre-orders are open, and it will be available for sale starting July 24 alongside the other new Galaxy devices. Color options include Silver Shadow, Yellow, Blue and Mint, while Craft Black and Purity White colors are available exclusively on Samsung.com."
