        "text": "Samsung’s latest Galaxy Watch series packs a powerful Wear OS experience plus fan favorite tools and design features. In fact, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Series offers two of the best smartwatches available. Here’s everything you need to know about the newest lineup.\n\nSee price at Samsung\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\nBigger, brighter AMOLED display\n\nSnappy Wear OS 4 software experience\n\nSporty yet tasteful aesthetic\n\nSee price at Amazon\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\nThe rotating bezel is back\n\nElegant design and build materials\n\nShips with Wear OS 4\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6: Release date, price, and availability\n\nDamien Wilde / Android Authority\n\nConsidering the sturdy foundation laid by the Galaxy Watch 4 and the improved Galaxy Watch 5, it’s no surprise the Galaxy Watch 6 series offers two powerful devices. The base model Galaxy Watch 6 starts at $299 for the most affordable 40mm model. The 44mm variant sells for $329. For the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, the 43mm model comes in at $399. The 47mm model is available for $429. That means even the premium model is slightly cheaper than the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro models.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\nBigger, brighter AMOLED display • Snappy Wear OS 4 software experience • Sporty yet tasteful aesthetic\n\nMSRP: $299.99\n\nBigger and better.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 brings the best of Wear OS 4 and Samsung's smartwatch features to the table. A large display and full Samsung Wallet app make the Watch 6 a powerful standalone device, while integration with Samsung phones makes the Watch 6 a valuable part of your Galaxy ecosystem.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\nThe rotating bezel is back • Elegant design and build materials • Ships with Wear OS 4\n\nMSRP: $399.99\n\nThe rotating crown is back\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic rocks a rotating bezel! Better equipped than the base Galaxy Watch 6, the Classic model is a powerful watch with updated activity tracking, improved health features, and the full Samsung Wallet app for your mobile payments.\n\nIn the UK, the Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic start from £289 and £369 for the smaller models and £319 and £399 for the larger variants, respectively. Throw in 4G LTE connectivity, and those prices increase to £339/£369 for the Watch 6 sizes and £429/£459 for the Watch 6 Classic. Galaxy Watch 6 prices in Europe begin at €319 for the 40mm model and €349 for 44mm. 4G connectivity again raises the price tag to €369 and €399, respectively. The Watch 6 Classic is a bit more expensive, costing €419/€449 depending on the size, and €469/€499 for the 4G-enabled models.\n\nThe devices officially launched at the Galaxy Unpacked event on July 26, 2023; however, they didn’t reach store shelves until August 11. They are available now from Samsung.com and from third-party retailers such as Amazon.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6: Features\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nThe Galaxy Watch 5 didn’t bring a remarkable design change to the Galaxy Watch line. In fact, we felt a bit of déjà vu when unboxing the device when reviewing the Galaxy Watch 5. At first glance, the Galaxy Watch 6 looks nearly identical to its predecessor. A closer 5 vs 6 comparison, however, highlights one notable design change: thinner bezels. According to Samsung, the active display area is 20% larger than that of the Watch 5, and the bezel is 30% thinner. The same is true for the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic.\n\nIn addition to the larger display, the Classic brings back a fan favorite — the rotating bezel. Our Galaxy Watch 6 Classic review notes that it makes for incredibly satisfying and smudge-free navigation. It’s well worth the fanfare, especially since the feature was noticeably missing from the entire 5-series. The bezel also gives the Classic model a leg up over the alternatives available.\n\nDamien Wilde / Android Authority\n\nRegarding colorways, the 40mm Galaxy Watch 6 comes in Gold and Graphite, and the 44mm model comes in Silver and Graphite. The Classic model is available in Silver and Black. The series also boasts a new fabric band meant to be more comfortable for sleeping. This and other bands also now feature a one-click removal button to make swapping between bands much easier. We were very impressed by this small but effective upgrade during our review. Buyers can also access a host of third-party Galaxy Watch 6 cases to protect the device from nicks and bruises and plenty of standard Galaxy Watch 6 bands and 6 Classic bands to satisfy particular requirements and styles.\n\nSoftware features\n\nOut of the box, the Galaxy Watch 6 series devices feature the latest Wear OS 4 with Samsung’s One UI 5 Watch skin. The new software is speedy and efficient, with all the best of Google and tons of updated experiences. One of the biggest highlights of the update is Fitbit-like sleep tracking. With a word-based numeric score, “Sleep Messages,” sleep consistency measurements, and a cute animal representing your sleep type, the sleep-tracking platform offers a detailed, personalized look at your sleep history. It even provides suggestions — or “Sleep Coaching” — for improving sleep habits. Unlike on a Fitbit, however, the feature is not locked behind a paywall.\n\nOn the fitness tracking side, the Galaxy Watch 6 and Galaxy Watch 6 Classic now auto-recognize when you are running, rowing, or swimming. The devices also offer a Personalized Heart Rate Zone feature that provides even more advanced real-time training feedback. These zones are described as “warm up,” “fat burn,” “cardio,” etc. and help users manage their output during workouts. Samsung also added irregular heart rhythm notifications to the 6 series. This is an important addition for those with heart problems, as abnormal rhythm fluctuations could indicate atrial fibrillation (AFib).\n\nDamien Wilde / Android Authority\n\nAll of these features and more are powered by the various sensors included in the smartwatch. As with the previous iterations, you’ll still find an accelerometer, barometer, gyroscope, geomagnetic sensor, light sensor, and Samsung’s BioActive sensor (optical heart rate (PPG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) sensor package). In addition to these sensors, Samsung added a temperature sensor. A 3D Hall sensor can also be found on the Classic model for the use of the device’s rotating crown.\n\nFinally, one feature we’ve been waiting to see for some time is the ability to transfer your watch from one phone to another. Previously, this would require a full reset of the watch, but One UI 5 Watch negates the need for this annoying step. Thankfully, this means if you buy a Galaxy Watch 6 and then upgrade to the Galaxy S24 later, you won’t need to reset your watch during the transfer.\n\nThe Galaxy Watch 6 won't require a full reset when migrating to a new phone.\n\nIn addition to these additions, Samsung made a few new improvements to existing features. Gesture controls allow greater accessibility and ease, while the camera controller can remotely switch camera modes and zoom when paired with a Galaxy Z Flip 5. With map support, the Galaxy Watch 6 series can also now show its location through Find My Phone. On the safety front, the company updated fall detection for even safer workouts and outings. When the feature is triggered, users can communicate directly with emergency services.\n\nDisplay\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Samsung increased the active display area by 20% on both models and shaved off 30% of the bezel. Going into specifics, the 40mm Watch 6 offers a 1.3-inch Super AMOLED screen with 432 x 432 resolution. The 44mm variant delivers a 1.5-inch Super AMOLED with 480 x 480 resolution. The 43mm Classic has a 1.3-inch Super AMOLED display with 432 x 432 resolution, and the 47mm boasts a 1.5-inch Super AMOLED with 480 x 480 resolution. All versions of the Watch 6 series feature a sapphire crystal screen and a full color Always On Display.\n\nSamsung claims these displays are more vibrant than ever and should make an excellent platform for your favorite watch faces. The displays also boast a peak brightness of 2,000 nits, so you won’t have any difficulty seeing what’s on your screen when you’re outside. That’s double the peak brightness of the Watch 5 series.\n\nBattery life\n\nBattery life was a bit of an issue in the smaller models of the Watch 5 series. Size-wise, the tech giant managed to squeeze in some bigger batteries this time around. The smallest Galaxy Watch 6 model (40mm) now comes with a 300mAh battery, up from the 284mAh battery of the 40mm Galaxy Watch 5. Meanwhile, the 44m Galaxy Watch 6 has a 425mAh battery, a slight increase over the 410mAh battery of the 44mm Galaxy Watch 5. The Classic got the same minor but welcomed capacity bumps.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6: Specs\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nThe Galaxy Watch 6 series lands with a better processor — but only slightly. The Galaxy Watch 6 series houses an Exynos W930 SoC, an upgrade over the W920 seen in the Galaxy Watch 5 and Galaxy Watch 4 models. However, the newer chipset is based on the same model number as the older one (S5E5515). That means the chipset is physically the same but altered just enough to warrant a new name. Interestingly, the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic and Galaxy Watch 6 offer the same chip. This is quite different from what we saw in the 5 series. Both models feature 2GB of RAM with 16GB of storage, operate on Wear OS 4, and have the same durability stats.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\nDisplay\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\n44mm: 1.5-inch\n\nSuper AMOLED\n\n480 x 480 resolution\n\nFull color Always On Display\n\nSapphire Crystal\n\n40mm: 1.3-inch\n\nSuper AMOLED\n\n432 x 432 resolution\n\nFull color Always On Display\n\nSapphire Crystal\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\n47mm: 1.5-inch\n\nSuper AMOLED\n\n480 x 480 resolution\n\nFull color Always On Display\n\nSapphire Crystal\n\n43mm: 1.3-inch\n\nSuper AMOLED\n\n432 x 432 resolution\n\nFull color Always On Display\n\nSapphire Crystal\n\nDimensions and weight\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\n44mm: 44.4 x 42.8 x 9.0mm\n\n33.3g\n\n40mm: 40.4 x 38.8 x 9.0mm\n\n28.7g\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\n47mm: 46.5 x 46.5 x 10.9mm, 59.0g\n\n43mm: 42.5 x 42.5 x 10.9mm, 52.0g\n\nColors and materials\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\nArmor Aluminum case with Sport Band\n\n44mm: Graphite, Silver\n\n40mm: Graphite, Gold\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\nStainless Steel case with Hybrid Eco-Leather Band\n\n47mm: Black, Silver\n\n43mm: Black, Silver\n\nBattery\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\n44mm: 425mAh\n\n40mm: 300mAh\n\nWPC-based wireless charging\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\n47mm: 425mAh\n\n43mm: 300mAh\n\nWPC-based wireless charging\n\nProcessor\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\nSamsung Exynos W930\n\nDual-core 1.4GHz\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\nSamsung Exynos W930\n\nDual-core 1.4GHz\n\nRAM\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\n2GB\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\n2GB\n\nStorage\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\n16GB\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\n16GB\n\nConnectivity\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\nLTE\n\nBluetooth 5.3\n\nWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n\n\n2.4+5GHz\n\nNFC\n\nGPS/GLONASS/Beidou/Galileo\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\nLTE\n\nBluetooth 5.3\n\nWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n\n\n2.4+5GHz\n\nNFC\n\nGPS/GLONASS/Beidou/Galileo\n\nSensors\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\nAccelerometer\n\nBarometer\n\nGyroscope\n\nGeomagnetic sensor\n\nLight sensor\n\nTemperature sensor\n\nSamsung BioActive sensor: optical heart rate (PPG), electric heart signal, bioelectrical impedance analysis sensor (BIA)\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\nAccelerometer\n\nBarometer\n\nGyroscope\n\nGeomagnetic sensor\n\nLight sensor\n\nTemperature sensor\n\n3D Hall sensor\n\nSamsung BioActive sensor: optical heart rate (PPG), electric heart signal, bioelectrical impedance analysis sensor (BIA)\n\nDurability\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\n5ATM + IP68\n\nMIL-STD-810H\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\n5ATM + IP68\n\nMIL-STD-810H\n\nSoftware\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\nWear OS powered by\n\nSamsung (Wear OS 4)\n\nOne UI 5 Watch\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\nWear OS powered by\n\nSamsung (Wear OS 4)\n\nOne UI 5 Watch\n\nCompatibility\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\nAndroid 10 or higher with more than 1.5GB of RAM\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n\nAndroid 10 or higher with more than 1.5GB of RAM\n\nFAQ\n\nNo. The Galaxy Watch 6 is not waterproof but water-resistant, with a rating of IP68.
