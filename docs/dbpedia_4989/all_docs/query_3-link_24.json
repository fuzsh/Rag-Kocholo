        "text": "Samsung’s new phones are landing next month at its Galaxy Unpacked event in Paris. But that hasn’t stopped the company from teasing the new Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 with some early reservation emails.\n\nThe Korean company has sent out reservation emails to potential buyers in India, according to SamMobile. These aren’t pre-order emails, but rather dates of when the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 can be reserved for pre-order. As SamMobile explains.\n\n“We received a message from a Samsung Experience Store that revealed that the B6 and Q6 smartphones will be available for pre-reservation on June 26, 2024.” B6 and Q6 are codenames for the Flip 6 and Fold 6 respectively.\n\nForbesSamsung Drops Galaxy Watch 6 Price In New Promotion\n\nNo information about price, specifications, or even deals, was included in the reservation email. But there’s a high chance that Samsung will give away a coupon, or dangle an early pre-order deal, to people who are signed up to its marketing emails. It did precisely this with the Galaxy S24, offering $50 vouchers to users who registered with the website before the official pre-order period kicked off.\n\nUpdated June 26 with new details about the reservation offer.\n\nSamsung has now confirmed that its next Galaxy Unpacked event, where it will announce the Fold 6 and Flip 6, will take place in Paris on July 10th. In the announcement, Samsung confirmed that it will once again allow buyers to reserve their spot in the pre-order queue and receive a $50 credit for doing so. Reservations cost nothing and buyers are not obligated to purchase anything.\n\nSamsung doesn’t explicitly say what the $50 can be spent on (because it won’t want to name the devices before they’re officially announced), but the Terms and Conditions say it can be used towards an “eligible device.”\n\nThat suggests that it may be part of a discount towards a new handset, rather than just a store credit towards an accessory, as was the case with the Galaxy S24. The Korean company is also teasing a pre-order deal that will knock $1500 off a “new Galaxy device.” That offer is likely a reference to trade-in savings and some kind of bundle deal.\n\nWhat will be interesting to see is what other deals the company launches with. Samsung could temporarily enhance trade-in prices, as it has done in previous launches. When the Galaxy S24 was released, Samsung emailed out £100 ($126.91) vouchers to potential buyers who didn’t have a phone to trade in.\n\nThere’s also the long-standing 5% discount when the code “APP5” is used during a purchase in the Samsung Shop app. Crucially, these codes are often stackable, meaning they can all be used at once.\n\nForbesSamsung's New Features For Galaxy Watches Are A Major Boost\n\nThere’s also the likely existence of a new Galaxy Watch, Galaxy Ring, and earbuds—all of which will almost certainly be part of bundle deals. Samsung’s two new devices, the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Ring, will be front and centre in those deals, so keep an eye out for the company’s promotions."
