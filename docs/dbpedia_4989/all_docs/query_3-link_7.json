I tried waiting for the tablet to run out of battery to reset it using the volume and power buttons but it would still soft reset with 0%. I really need the tablet reset as I'm going to use it for school.\n\nHi,\n\nI am coming back on that topic because I have the same issue, my tab S6 lite went black screen and none of the things I tried to turn it on again failed.\n\nI tried to plug the tab to the wall and or to a laptop and hold the volume down and power button. Nothing happened. Same thing with volume up and power button. So far nothing I tried could turn on the tab again...\n\nIs there anything else I can do or should I bring it to a shop to fix it?\n\nThanks in advance..."
