        "text": "Samsung has launched its next major update, One UI 6.1, for select Galaxy devices. Here’s the full list of phones and tablets being updated.\n\nWhat’s new in One UI 6.1?\n\nOne UI 6.1 is Samsung’s second update built on top of Android 14. Visually, there aren’t many changes, but there are some new features and tweaks.\n\nThe big story is around Galaxy AI, Samsung’s suite of AI-enhanced features available throughout the software. Many of these live within Samsung apps, while Google’s Circle to Search is available through a simple long-press of the home button or gesture bar. The full list of Galaxy AI features includes:\n\nCircle to Search\n\nChat Assist\n\nInterpreter\n\nLive Translate\n\nNote Assist\n\nTranscript Assist\n\nBrowsing Assist\n\nGenerative Edit\n\nEdit Suggestion\n\nInstant Slow-Mo\n\nGenerative Wallpaper\n\nPhoto Ambient Wallpaper\n\nSome of these features, though, do vary by device. Photo Ambient Wallpaper is currently exclusive to the Galaxy S24 series, while Instant Slow-Mo is not supported on Galaxy S23 FE. Galaxy S22 devices are similarly missing a couple of features, while devices from 2021 received virtually no AI features.\n\nSome Galaxy AI features will depend on what device you’re using – here’s the full list\n\nOther feature changes outside of AI include the removal of Samsung’s three-area gesture navigation and also a new “Battery Protection” feature. These may end up on devices that don’t get Galaxy AI features.\n\nSamsung devices with One UI 6.1 – The full list\n\nThere are two main tiers of devices with One UI 6.1. There are those with AI features, and those without. We’ve broken down the list of Galaxy devices with One UI 6.1 under those two categories below. You can click on each device to learn more about its One UI 6.1 update rollout details.\n\nGalaxy devices with AI in One UI 6.1\n\nGalaxy S24\n\nGalaxy S24+\n\nGalaxy S24 Ultra\n\nGalaxy S23\n\nGalaxy S23+\n\nGalaxy S23 Ultra\n\nGalaxy S23 FE\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 5\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 5\n\nGalaxy Tab S9\n\nGalaxy Tab S9+\n\nGalaxy Tab S9 Ultra\n\nGalaxy S22\n\nGalaxy S22+\n\nGalaxy S22 Ultra\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 4\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 4\n\nGalaxy Tab S8\n\nGalaxy Tab S8+\n\nGalaxy Tab S8 Ultra\n\nGalaxy S21\n\nGalaxy S21+\n\nGalaxy S21 Ultra\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 3\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 3\n\nGalaxy devices without AI in One UI 6.1\n\nGalaxy Tab S9 FE\n\nGalaxy Tab S7 FE\n\nGalaxy Tab S6 Lite\n\nGalaxy Tab A9\n\nGalaxy Tab A9+\n\nGalaxy A05s\n\nGalaxy A15\n\nGalaxy A25\n\nGalaxy A14\n\nGalaxy A24\n\nGalaxy A34\n\nGalaxy A54\n\nGalaxy S21 FE\n\nGalaxy A73\n\nGalaxy A53\n\nGalaxy A33\n\nGalaxy A23\n\nGalaxy A13\n\nGalaxy A72\n\nGalaxy A52\n\nGalaxy A52s\n\nGalaxy F54\n\nGalaxy F34\n\nGalaxy F14\n\nGalaxy F23\n\nGalaxy M54\n\nGalaxy M44\n\nGalaxy M34\n\nGalaxy M14\n\nGalaxy M04\n\nGalaxy M53\n\nGalaxy M33\n\nGalaxy M23\n\nGalaxy Quantum 2\n\nGalaxy XCover 7\n\nGalaxy Xcover 6 Pro\n\nGalaxy Tab Active 5\n\nGalaxy Tab Active 4 Pro\n\nWill my Galaxy device get One UI 6.1?\n\nSamsung has been pretty vague about its plans for One UI 6.1. With the update not being a major Android update, there’s been no roadmap. And, with it being so heavily focused on AI, there were questions whether or not it would come to older and cheaper devices at all.\n\nHowever, it appears that Samsung is slowly working through bringing One UI 6.1 to virtually its entire lineup. “Flagship” devices from the past couple of generations are getting AI features, but other devices are merely getting some bug fixes and feature tweaks in 6.1.\n\nIf your Galaxy device was updated to One UI 6.0 with Android 14, there’s a good chance it will get One UI 6.1 in due time.\n\nYou can see a full list of Samsung devices with Android 14 here.\n\nUpdated 6/25.\n\nMore on Samsung:\n\nSamsung Galaxy devices get better battery stats with new ‘Device Care’ update\n\nGalaxy Watch 6 Classic long-term review: King without a crown [Video]\n\nSamsung says Google’s Circle to Search is more popular than its Galaxy AI features"
