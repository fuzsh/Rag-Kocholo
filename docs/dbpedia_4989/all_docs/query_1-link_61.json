        "text": "Our Galaxy Unpacked live blog is up and running. Take a look to learn the latest about Samsung's announcements.\n\nIn a few short hours, we're going to find out what the latest Galaxy Unpacked has in store for us — though, thanks to a steady stream of rumors, we have a pretty good idea already.\n\nThe summer Galaxy Unpacked event usually focuses on foldables, and while we're expecting new versions of both the Galaxy Z Fold and Galaxy Z Flip to appear at the Unpacked event on Wednesday (July 10), wearables could steal the show. We expect to see new versions of the Galaxy Watch and get the latest details on the Galaxy Ring, including when this smart ring is shipping and how much it costs.\n\nIf you're thinking that Unpacked has arrived much sooner than usual, you're not imagining things. Samsung typically waits until the latter part of July or early August before holding its end-of-summer product launch. But with the Paris Olympics looming — and Samsung among the sponsors of that event — we're getting an early look at all the products coming soon to a retail shelf near you.\n\nHere's a rundown of what we think Samsung might be planning to announce at Galaxy Unpacked as well as the start time for today's big reveal.\n\nGalaxy Unpacked Cheat Sheet: Biggest expected announcements\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 6: An update to Samsung's larger foldable phone, with a potential second model on the cards too.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 6: The smaller Galaxy foldable, possibly receiving a larger cover screen\n\nGalaxy Ring: Samsung's first smart ring, designed to track your health quietly in the background.\n\nGalaxy Watch 7: A new standard smartwatch that may get a brand new look and boosted power efficiency\n\nGalaxy Watch Ultra: Another brand new device, aimed at being a more rugged and premium smartwatch.\n\nGalaxy Buds 3: Expected in standard and Pro varieties, these earbuds are both due for an upgrade, even though the rumor mill's been a little quiet.\n\nSamsung has confirmed that the next Galaxy Unpacked will happen today (Wednesday, July 10) at 9 a.m. ET / 6 a.m. PT / 2 p.m. BST. This date matches a rumor about the earlier-than-usual date for Unpacked — last year, the summer Unpacked event occurred on July 26.\n\nWe mentioned Samsung's eagerness to hold Galaxy Unpacked ahead of the Paris Olympics. That's because Unpacked is taking place in Paris. Last year's event was in Seoul, South Korea, and the January 2024 Galaxy S24 launch took place in San Jose, Calif., so give credit to Samsung for mixing things up.\n\nAfraid you won't be able to make it to the City of Lights for the big announcement? Don't worry — Samsung will have a live stream of Galaxy Unpacked on YouTube. We've got a guide on how to watch Galaxy Unpacked.\n\nWe'll also be at Galaxy Unpacked to cover all the product announcements coming out of the show.\n\nIf past product announcements are any indication, foldable phones should be front and center at the next Unpacked. But the latest Galaxy Z Fold and Flip models likely won't be the only things that Samsung focuses on. Here's an overview of everything to expect at Galaxy Unpacked.\n\nRegardless of what Samsung announces, you can already reap some savings on the new products. If you register to pre-order anything announced at Galaxy Unpacked, you're eligible for a $50 credit on your purchase as well as up to $1,500 in savings should you follow through on the pre-order. For now, all you have to do is provide your name and email address at Samsung's website. Samsung's offer ends right before Unpacked, so make sure you register today if you haven't already.\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 6\n\nSamsung is almost certainly going to release a new version of its main foldable, the Galaxy Z Fold. The biggest drama heading into Unpacked is just how many Fold models there might be.\n\nBut before we dive into that question, let's address the most likely Galaxy Z Fold 6 changes. The new foldable will almost certainly sport a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, reaping the performance and power-saving rewards that chipset has demonstrated with other best Android phones, including the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Like that phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 may include a titanium frame with a thinner design.\n\nPast Folds have taken knocks for the orientation of their cover display, which is tall, narrow and difficult to use one-handed. Rumors tip the Z Fold 6 to have a more square-like aspect ratio, much like the OnePlus Open, our current pick for the best foldable phone. Cameras aren't expected to see many hardware changes, but we do think there will be plenty of AI-powered tools due to Samsung's Galaxy AI push — Samsung has said as much, and the Galaxy Unpacked invitation includes the Galaxy AI logo.\n\nForget about additional models like a Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE, which would be a less expensive version of Samsung's $1,799 foldable. While some rumors have claimed Samsung is working on such a device, a more recent report had Samsung backing off Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE plans over concerns about how thin it can make the phone and whether there would be enough differentiation from the main model. It's still possible the cheaper foldable might arrive next year alongside the Galaxy S25.\n\nMore concerning are reports that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 price could be going up. One source claims a $100 price hike over the Galaxy Z Fold 5.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 6\n\nWherever a new Galaxy Z Fold model shows up, a Galaxy Z Flip is almost certain to follow. At Galaxy Unpacked 2024, that could mean the Galaxy Z Flip 6 gets some time in the spotlight, as Samsung shows off its latest flip phone-style foldable.\n\nWhile early renders suggest the same general design as its predecessors, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 looks a little thicker, possibly to house a bigger battery. (Battery life has been consistently below average for Flip models.) We could also see the phone's main camera sensor get a boost from 12MP to 50MP as Samsung looks to improve the Flip's reputation as a camera phone. And like the Galaxy Z Fold 6, a switch to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset seems almost inevitable.\n\nLast year's big Galaxy Z Flip 5 change involved expanding the phone's outer display to 3.4 inches. One rumor tips the Galaxy X Flip 6 to have a 3.9-inch cover display, which will allow you to do more without having to flip open the phone.\n\nAs with the Galaxy Z Fold 6, rumors suggest the price of the Galaxy Z Flip 6 could be higher than last year's model.\n\nA recent leak has given us a better look at the updated design for the Galaxy Z Flip 6. These images show the outer display mostly, both with the phone folded up and partly opened. But that doesn't stop us from gleaning info about what the phone has on the inside.\n\nGalaxy Ring\n\nJanuary's Galaxy Unpacked event ended with a tease of the Galaxy Ring, Samsung's attempt to take on the Oura Ring and other ring-based fitness trackers. Samsung has yet to announce a release date for the ring or detail its features, but the Unpacked event this summer feels like the perfect opportunity to close the loop.\n\nSamsung has shown off the ring at subsequent trade shows, so we know there will be nine sizes and three colors to choose fron when selecting your 3-gram wearable. Rumored features include health monitoring capabilities such as an ECG sensor, sleep tracking tools and a way to measure blood flow. You can expect smart features for controlling other Samsung devices, too. A more recent leak details health-tracking features coming to the Galaxy Ring, such as heart-rate monitoring, temperature measuring and even snore detection.\n\nAnother missing piece of the Galaxy Ring puzzle could be filled at Galaxy Unpacked in the summer. Samsung could finally tell us how much we're supposed to pay for a Galaxy Ring. (We're guessing it's around $300.)\n\nGalaxy Watch 7\n\nPast summer Unpacked events have seen Samsung smartwatches accompany foldable phones to the spotlight, and that's likely to continue this time around. We're already hearing talk of a July announcement for the Galaxy Watch 7, which figures to be faster and longer-lasting than its predecessor.\n\nOn the speed front, rumors tip the Galaxy Watch 7 models to use an Exynos W940 chipset, delivering better performance and greater power efficiency that will let Samsung's watch last longer on a charge. Sleep apnea detection leads the list of possible feature additions, and you can bet that the watch will work with the Galaxy Ring.\n\nSamsung is allegedly looking at a square design for the Galaxy Watch 7, after favoring a rounded look for past models. It's possible that Samsung will offer a mix of looks with the square design reserved for the rumored Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra, a more powerful version of Samsung's watch with the rumored ability to measure blood sugar levels. Samsung has essentially confirmed that an Ultra is in the works, though its exact features and price remain unknown.\n\nGalaxy Watch Ultra\n\nSamsung's dabbled in more premium smartwatches in the past, such as the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. But this year we may see a new Galaxy Watch Ultra version, named and designed to take on Apple's Apple Watch Ultra 2.\n\nExpected to cost $700, the design looks to house Samsung's typical round watch face in a squarer. 47mm shell with a bright orange crown. Expect a chunky battery, 100-meter water resistance and potentially blood sugar monitoring on top of that too.\n\nGalaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds Pro 3\n\nIt's been a while since we've seen new earbuds from Samsung — the Galaxy Buds 2 have been around since 2021 while the Galaxy Buds Pro 2 came out in 2023. Rumors about either set of earbuds aren't exactly simmering the way that Samsung's foldables, smartwatches and ring have gotten a lot of buzz, but that could just reflect the nature of these audio accessories.\n\nWith Samsung's push for Galaxy AI features, you'd hope to see something similar in terms of audio features for future earbuds. Indeed, a new report suggests that AI could be very much part of the mix with the next Galaxy Buds; an older rumor has the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro gaining translation features.\n\nMore from Tom's Guide"
