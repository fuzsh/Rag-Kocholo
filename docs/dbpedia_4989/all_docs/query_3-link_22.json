        "text": "Meet the new Galaxy AI upleveled by the unique foldable form factor of Galaxy Z series and the connected Galaxy ecosystem\n\nGalaxy Buds3 Pro enhances sound and communication quality through innovative AI capabilities\n\nSamsung Electronics today announced its all-new Galaxy Z Fold6 and Galaxy Z Flip6, along with Galaxy Buds3 and Galaxy Buds3 Pro at Galaxy Unpacked in Paris.\n\nEarlier this year, Samsung ushered in the era of mobile AI through the power of Galaxy AI.1 With the introduction of the new Galaxy Z series, Samsung is opening the next chapter of Galaxy AI by leveraging its most versatile and flexible form factor perfectly designed to enable a range of unique mobile experiences. Whether using Galaxy Z Fold’s large screen, Galaxy Z Flip’s FlexWindow or making the most of the iconic FlexMode, Galaxy Z Fold6 and Flip6 will provide more opportunities to maximize AI capabilities. Built on the foundation of Samsung’s history of form factor innovation, Galaxy AI uses powerful, intelligent and durable foldable experience to accelerate a new era of communication, productivity and creativity.\n\n“Samsung’s long history of innovation has allowed us to lead in the mobile space, creating the foldable form factor and ushering in the mobile AI era. Now, we are excited to bring these two complementary technologies together and unlock new possibilities for users around the world,” said TM Roh, President and Head of Mobile eXperience Business at Samsung Electronics. “Our foldables meet the unique needs of every user and now enhanced by the power of Galaxy AI, Samsung is delivering an experience like never before.”\n\nSamsung’s continued innovation for foldables has created the slimmest and lightest Galaxy Z series ever, optimized for portability. The perfectly symmetrical design with straight edge provides an aesthetically sleek finish while a new cover screen ratio on Galaxy Z Fold6 provides a more natural bar-type viewing experience. Along with design refinements, the new Galaxy Z series is engineered to provide even more durability, offering you greater peace of mind. The dual rail hinge structure is further supported by a strengthened folding edge, better distributing the shock of external impacts. Plus, enhanced layers on the main screen help to improve the crease while maintaining strength. The latest Galaxy Z series is also equipped with enhanced Armor Aluminum2 and Corning® Gorilla®Glass Victus® 23, making this the most durable Galaxy Z series yet.\n\nIn addition to being reliable, every element of the Galaxy Z series is also powerful. Both the Galaxy Z Fold6 and Flip6 are equipped with the Snapdragon® 8 Gen 3 Mobile Platform for Galaxy,4 the most advanced Snapdragon mobile processor yet, combining best-in-class CPU, GPU and NPU performance. The processor is optimized for AI processing and offers enhanced graphics along with improved overall performance. The upgraded cooling system maximizes performance with a larger vapor chamber on Galaxy Z Fold6 and, for the first time ever, a vapor chamber on Galaxy Z Flip.\n\nGalaxy Z Fold6: Large Screen Productivity Elevated by AI\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold6 offers a range of AI-powered features and tools that maximize the large screen and significantly enhance productivity.\n\nNote Assist5 on Samsung Notes offers translation, summaries and auto formatting for simple and easy meeting notes. Plus, a newly embedded transcript feature enables transcription, translation and summarizing of voice recordings directly in Notes. Texts in PDF files can be translated and overlaid perfectly through PDF overlay translation feature in Notes6 — and it even supports text in images and graphs. A newly added Composer7 from Samsung Keyboard generates suggested text based on simple keywords for email and supported social media apps. For social media in particular, the Composer creates text that reflects your tone by analyzing previous posts. Additionally, the S Pen8 experience is expanded further meeting with Galaxy AI on the Galaxy Z Fold6’s screen. All-new Sketch to image9 allows you to create more sophisticated art pieces by generating image options when you simply sketch or draw on the photos in Gallery or Note screen.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold6 enables you to evolve the way you work, play and stay informed thanks to Samsung’s longstanding partnership with Google. The latest Google Gemini app10 is fully integrated on the new Galaxy Z series, providing your own AI-powered assistant right on your phone. By simply swiping the corner of the screen or saying, “Hey Google”, you can bring up Gemini’s overlay and get help with writing, learning or planning. Gemini is integrated with some of your favorite Google apps, making it easy to organize a perfect travel itinerary by getting real-time flight and hotel booking information — and explore famous landmarks and the best routes to get there using Google Maps. When you want detailed information about a K-pop music video while watching YouTube on Galaxy Z Fold6’s large screen, you can access Gemini overlay in the multi-window split screen to ask questions. If you’re curious about who the artist is in the video, just long press the home button and circle, highlight or tap on screen — and Circle to Search11 will offer instant search results.\n\nGalaxy AI has also enhanced barrier-free communication on Galaxy Z Fold6. Maximizing its unique dual screen form factor, Interpreter12 comes with a new conversation mode that enables both parties to conveniently view translations on the main and cover screens for more natural interactions. It also offers one-way translation, so you can easily understand when listening during lectures or any other type of presentation. Live Translate,13 which translates phone calls directly on your device in real-time, is also now being extended beyond Samsung’s own native calling app to a selection of popular third-party apps.\n\nFrom capturing to editing to viewing, AI-powered ProVisual Engine on the Galaxy Z Fold6 takes your creativity to the next level. The advanced editing experience with Photo Assist14 on the large screen helps to effortlessly create professional-grade content. Portrait Studio15 creates a variety of different portrait styles such as 3D cartoon or watercolor for more creative possibilities. And if you want to enjoy every second with a more detailed view, Instant Slow-mo16 allows you to instantly slow a video by generating additional frames while maintaining a smooth viewing experience. You also have the option of saving or directly sharing your videos with friends and family so they can enjoy them as well.\n\nNot only does Galaxy Z Fold6 allow you to create content, it allows you to enjoy it, too. Galaxy Z Fold6 offers an upgraded gaming experience, anchored by its powerful chipset and 1.6x larger vapor chamber for the ability to game for longer, while still maintaining performance. Vivid, life-like graphics are supported by Ray Tracing and are brought to life on a 7.6-inch screen17 that offers a brighter display of up to 2,600nit to deliver more immersive gaming.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip6: Creating Unique Experiences, Customized to You\n\nThe Galaxy Z Flip6 is not just optimized for portability, but it offers a range of new customization and creativity features so you can make the most of every moment.\n\nThe 3.4-inch Super AMOLED FlexWindow18 has been enhanced yet again, enabling AI-assisted functions without even needing to open the device. And for those communications on-the-go, you can reply to texts with Suggested replies19 which analyzes your latest messages to suggest a tailored response. With Galaxy AI, you can get the most out of your pocket-sized device, and many of these convenient features exist on FlexWindow. FlexWindow provides access to Samsung Health20 updates and notifications and also allows you to select the next track you want to listen to on your music widget. Plus, FlexWindow offers more Widgets than ever, and allows you to check information from multiple Widgets simultaneously.\n\nIt wouldn’t be Galaxy Z Flip without a variety of ways for you to customize your device either. With the AI-powered Photo Ambient,21 a wallpaper can change in real-time based on the time and weather. You can also easily create a unified look and feel with suggested screen layout options by analyzing your wallpaper — such as moving the clock and changing the frame color to ensure the background image stands.\n\nCreativity also goes beyond FlexWindow. FlexCam continues to offer the most versatile camera experience and unlocks new creative options. With the new Auto Zoom,22 FlexCam automatically finds the best framing for your shot by detecting the subject and zooming in and out before making any necessary adjustments. That way, you don’t have to choose between your friends or an incredible backdrop being in the shot — and it’s all hands-free.\n\nNew 50MP Wide and 12MP Ultra-wide sensors provide an upgraded camera experience with clear and crisp details in pictures. The new 50MP sensor supports 2x optical zoom for noise-free photos, while offering AI zoom for an advanced shooting experience with up to 10x zoom. Nightography, enhanced with video HDR allows you to capture more brilliant videos — even in dim lighting — and goes further by partnering with popular social apps as well. The night capturing feature is now available in-app on Instagram, so you can take amazing photos at night and message or share them directly from within the app.\n\nYou can continue using all the creative and customizable features of Galaxy Z Flip6 without worrying about battery life either, with longer usage time23 made possible by hardware and software optimization.\n\nSecurity You Can Trust, Controlled by You\n\nGalaxy Z Fold6 and Flip6 are secured by Samsung Knox, Samsung Galaxy’s defense-grade, multi-layer security platform built to safeguard critical information and protect against vulnerabilities with end-to-end hardware, real-time threat detection and collaborative protection. In the era of AI, Samsung’s commitment to empowering you with choice over your device settings is stronger than ever, which is why you have full control over how you allow your data to enhance AI experiences through Galaxy AI settings.24 As an added layer of protection, Enhanced Data Protection offers end-to-end encryption when you backup, sync or restore your data with Samsung Cloud. The new Galaxy Z series is also backed by Samsung’s expansive list of security and privacy features including Knox Vault, Security & Privacy Dashboard, Auto Blocker, passkeys, Secure Wi-Fi and Private sharing in Quick Share.\n\nOngoing Journey to a Sustainable Future\n\nThe latest Galaxy Z series reinforces Samsung’s commitment to do more for people and the planet with less by reimagining how mobile technology is designed and packaged. Samsung continues to scale its use of recycled materials with the Galaxy Z Fold6 and Flip625 by featuring recycled gold and copper for the first time.26\n\nEarlier this year, Samsung introduced recycled minerals like cobalt and rare earth elements27 in the Galaxy S24 series, all of which can be found in components of the Galaxy Z Fold6 and Flip6, along with recycled plastics, aluminum and glass. The Galaxy Z Fold6 and Flip6 also come in a packaging box made from 100% recycled paper material, and they provide seven generations of OS upgrades and seven years of security updates.28\n\nGalaxy Buds3 Series: Expanding the Connected Experience through Galaxy AI\n\nWith the power of Galaxy AI, the Galaxy Buds3 series brings a new communication experience. If you’re attending a class in a foreign language, you can turn on Interpreter29 in Listening mode on Galaxy Z Fold6 or Flip6 with Galaxy Buds3 series plugged into your ears. This will allow you to hear the lecture translated directly through your Galaxy Buds, removing language barriers that may exist in your studies. Also, simply saying two words through Voice Command30 allows you to control functions like playing or stopping music without manually touching the earbuds or a connected smartphone. Sound can also be intelligently optimized, regardless of how you wear your Galaxy Buds. The microphones in the Buds3 series analyze both internal and external sound in real time to enhance sound and Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) quality through Adaptive EQ and Adaptive ANC. And if you are listening to music, your Galaxy Buds3 Pro will constantly collect and identify surrounding sound and automatically adjust the optimal level of noise and sound without manual adjustment through Adaptive Noise Control, Siren Detect and Voice Detect,31 all for your convenience.\n\nBuilt upon a variety of collected statistical data, the Galaxy Buds3 series comes with a new computational design boasting a comfortable fit. The premium blade design also targets style-centric consumers with an ultra-sleek and modern style complemented with Blade Lights.32 This new design enables a more intuitive physical experience by allowing you to control the device by simply pinching or swiping up or down on the blade, thereby offering convenience and tasteful aesthetics at the same time. Galaxy Buds3 and Buds3 Pro offer two purpose-built design options. Galaxy Buds3 Pro is Canal Type for those looking for immersive sound, while Buds3 is Open Type for people who prefer to use the device in a variety of situations for an extended period of time.\n\nTo deliver a premium audio experience, Galaxy Buds3 Pro is equipped with advanced hardware. Galaxy Buds3 Pro comes with enhanced 2-way speakers with planar tweeter for sophisticated, precise high range sound production, and Dual Amplifiers for a crystal-clear sound experience on the go. And now, thanks to Ultra High Quality33 Audio that supports a doubled sampling rate with SSC codec, you can listen to a high-resolution audio source as it was intended and enjoy every sound in superb detail. This level of sound quality extends to phone calls, too. With a pre-trained model based on machine learning, the Galaxy Buds3 series is now able to restore the original voice of the speaker in various noise environments while also providing a rich and natural call — similar to the high-quality calls of smartphones — with the Super-Wideband34 Call feature.\n\nNot only is the Galaxy Buds3 series created to provide the premium audio experience, but it is also designed to do more with less for people and the planet. Galaxy Buds3 and Buds3 Pro feature several components in the cradle and earbuds that use recycled plastics sourced from discarded fishing nets or water barrels. Every Galaxy Buds3 series is packaged in a packaging box made with 100% recycled paper material.\n\n​Availability\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold6, Z Flip6 and Galaxy Buds3 series will be available for pre-order starting today, July 10, with general availability starting July 24.\n\nGalaxy Z Fold6 is available in Silver Shadow, Pink and Navy, while Galaxy Z Flip6 is also available in Silver Shadow, Yellow, Blue and Mint color options35 so you can choose a color that best suits your style. Or order online at Samsung.com and access exclusive Galaxy Z series colors such as Crafted Black, White as well as a Peach color option for Galaxy Z Flip6.\n\nThe Galaxy Buds3 series offers an ultra-sleek, modern and comfortable design available in two colors, Silver and White.36\n\nFor your peace of mind, Samsung Care+37 — which protects your products with certified care from Samsung experts for accidental damage — will be provided one-year free during pre-order periods.\n\nFor more information about Galaxy Z Fold6, Z Flip6, Galaxy Buds3 and Buds3 Pro, please visit: Samsung Newsroom, Samsungmobilepress.com or Samsung.com.\n\nSpecifications\n\n​ Galaxy Z Fold6 Display Main Screen 7.6-inch QXGA+*\n\nDynamic AMOLED 2X\n\nInfinity Flex Display (2160 x 1856, 20.9:18), 374ppi\n\n120Hz adaptive refresh rate (1~120Hz)\n\n* Measured diagonally, Galaxy Z Fold6’s Main Screen size is 7.6-inch in the full rectangle and 7.6-inch accounting for the rounded corners; actual viewable area is less due to the rounded corners.
