        "text": "Update: Our Galaxy Z Fold 6 review is now here, so give it a read for our ultimate verdict.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is one impressive phone with a slim lightweight design, a powerful new chipset, improved durability and the whole suite of Galaxy AI features. Unfortunately, the new phone is also more expensive than last year's model.\n\nPrices start at $1,899, $100 more than you’d pay for an equivalent Galaxy Z Fold 5. So prospective buyers will have to decide whether that extra cost and the various hardware and software upgrades on offer are worth it. Samsung would, of course, point to all the improved and refined AI features that have come to the Z Fold 6, as well as the fact it’s the most powerful and durable Samsung foldable made so far.\n\nFrom hardware to software, here’s everything you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 cheat sheet: The major changes\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 6 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy, the same as the one found in the Galaxy S24 Ultra and currently the most powerful Android chipset on the market\n\nDespite rumors of a major redesign, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 looks more or less the same as before. It is fractionally shorter and wider, but not to the same extent as other foldables.\n\nThe Z Fold 6 has a new dual rail hinge that is stronger and thinner, and combined with an FT6 protective screen later offers better shock resistance and a reduced display crease\n\nThe Z Fold 6 has an official dust resistance rating for the first time, offering IP48 protection against water and dust ingress\n\nAI features have been improved and optimized for foldables. This includes Interpreter mode’s real-time translation, which can display both sides of a conversation on each display.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 pricing and availability\n\nPrices for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 start at $1,899 / £1,799 / AU$2,749 for the 256GB storage option — which is $100 more than the equivalent Galaxy Z Fold 5. Prices rise to $2,019 / £1,899 / AU$2.949 for 512GB storage and $2,259 / £2,099 / AU$3,299 for 1TB of storage. All three variants come with 12GB of RAM.\n\nColor options available this year include Silver Shadow, Pink and Navy. Craft Black and Purity White will be available exclusively from Samsung.com\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 preorders are open until July 24, the official launch day. Pre-orders in the U.S. include double storage at no extra cost as well as 12 months of free Samsung Care Plus when you pre-order a carrier version through Samsung.com. Anyone who pre-orders in the U.K. will also receive the new slimmed-down Z Fold S Pen and the redesigned S Pen case. These offers end on July 23 or while stocks last.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 specs\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: What’s new\n\nWhile there had been rumors of a big redesign, the look of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 hasn’t changed all that much compared to older models. It’s a little shorter and wider, but not by a whole lot. The phone is 6 x 2.68 x 0.47 inches when folded and 6 x 5.2 x 0.22 inches in an unfolded state. That’s 0.1 inches shorter than the Z Fold 5 and 0.09-inches wider (unfolded), which is not going to be noticed by many.\n\nThe Z Fold 6 is noticeably thinner and lighter, weighing half an ounce less at 8.4oz. The phone is 0.47 inches when mesured — 0.06 inches less than the Z Fold 5. Meanwhile Samsung says that the Z Fold 6 is more durable than last year, thanks in part to the new Dual Rail Hinge technology. This is thinner and stronger, offering improved protection and a reduced display crease. Also adding extra protection is an FTG layer on the inner screen, an armor aluminum frame and IP 48 dust resistance. That’s the first time a Z Fold has had a formal rating for dust protection.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 6 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy, a specially-optimized version of Qualcomm’s latest system on chip that was previously exclusive to the Galaxy S24 Ultra. That should give it a performance advantage over the best Android phones, as well as all the power efficiency benefits afforded by the chipset. So, in theory, it should make the 4,400 mAh battery last longer even if it’s the exact same size as the one on the Z Fold 5.\n\nAI updates are the biggest draw this year, with the Z Fold 6 enjoying the full suite of Galaxy AI features that launched earlier this year. The only new exclusive feature we have is the Sketch to Image, which turns doodles into realistic objects and Portrait Studio which can convert your selfies into a number of different art styles, all using generative AI. Other features do feel familiar, though Samsung has updated them for the Z Fold 6, which includes adding some foldable optimizations. Interpreter mode, for instance, can now utiilize both screens on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 to show a translated conversation for both parties involved.\n\nPlus like current Galaxy S24 flagships, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is set to get seven years of software and security updates. Our Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs Galaxy Z Fold 5 comparison has a more thorough look at the similarities and differences between the two phones.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: How it compares to other phones\n\nThe main competition for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 right includes the OnePlus Open and Google Pixel Fold — two of the best foldable phones money can buy. As it stands both those devices are a little older and a little cheaper, with OnePlus offering a foldable experience for $200 less than Samsung’s latest.\n\nBoth the OnePlus Open and Pixel Fold offer a squatter design than Samsung, which some find to be more comfortable in their hand. OnePlus has also managed to capture the premium feel of its design, perfected multitasking with the Open Canvas concept and offers considerably better camera hardware — particularly with the telephoto lens, which is 64MP compared to the Z Fold 6’s 10MP.\n\nMeanwhile, Google pushes that same lens even further with 5x optical zoom and classic Google Pixel camera performance aided by AI. Sadly the AI smarts on the Pixel Fold are limited, on account of it running on an almost-two-year-old Tensor G2 chipset.\n\nIn some ways, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 comes out on top, but in other areas, both rival book-like foldables have it beat. Since both OnePlus and Google are expected to launch new foldables in the coming months — the OnePlus Open Pro and Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold — there’s no telling how that might change.\n\nHowever, a recent breakdown by JerryRigEverything indicates that the new design isn't all perfect. One of the major issues is that the hinge lets in a surprising amount of dust. During the test, the phone was covered in dirt, which led to the hinge making a noise when the phone was opened and closed, something that didn't happen with older models.\n\nBe sure to check out our Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs OnePlus Open and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs Pixel Fold 2 pages to find out more.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: Verdict\n\nYou can read our in-depth thoughts on Samsung's latest big foldable in our Galaxy Z Fold 6 review. But in a nutshell, it's a refinement of previous Z Folds, but not dramatically improved.\n\nThe revised design makes the phone lighter and tougher, while the new screens are brighter and more colorful than ever. Performance is a particular high point thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip and a full suite of Galaxy AI features, including the entertaining Sketch to Image.\n\nBut the cameras haven't been upgraded in any noticeable way, and battery life is only a little better than last year's model. But the biggest flaw is the price, which has climbed even higher to $1,900 for the standard model.\n\nIt’s no surprise that Samsung isn’t being very adventurous with the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The company has taken more of a refine-and-adapt approach to its foldables for the past few generations, rather than offering big tentpole-style upgrades each year. Arguably, Galaxy AI could be considered the latter, and it could easily be the main selling point for anyone thinking about picking up a Galaxy Z Fold 6 for themselves. Assuming, of course, that the price increase doesn’t put them off and send users into the arms of cheaper rivals."
