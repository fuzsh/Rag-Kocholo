        "text": "The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 has now landed, with the brand having launched this clamshell foldable alongside the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 at its July 10 Samsung Galaxy Unpacked showcase.\n\nThis relatively affordable alternative to the Galaxy Z Fold 6 comes with a whole host of upgrades, including a new 50MP camera, a bigger battery, a powerful new chipset, and – yes – new colors to choose from.\n\nThere are seven Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 colors available, with the main ones being Blue, Silver Shadow, Mint, and Yellow. We say these are the ‘main’ shades because the phone will be widely available in these colors, but there are also Crafted Black, White, and Peach shades, which are Samsung store exclusives.\n\nSo far, we’ve only seen the main four options in the flesh, but read on for an overview of every shade, and images of those we’ve seen.\n\nBlue\n\nMany of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6’s shades are quite light and playful, and the Blue option is a prime example of that.\n\nIt’s a fairly bright blue, certainly compared to the smart and understated Blue that you can get the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 in. So the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 in Blue is likely to stand out a little, and you’ll notice that – as with the other four shades we’ve seen – the rear camera lenses also have a matching finish around them, which is a nice touch.\n\nSilver Shadow\n\nOf the four widely available Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 colors, Silver Shadow is the most smart, understated, and professional.\n\nIt’s a dark gray color with none of the playfulness of the other shades, but if you want a grown up option that won’t attract as much attention, then this is for you. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 is also available in a gray shade, but it’s a much paler one than you get here.\n\nMint\n\nMint is another color you can get the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 in, and it’s another that was offered for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 too, but as with the other duplicate colors the exact shade here is different.\n\nThe Mint Z Flip 5 is a lot paler than this one, which really pops, and is perhaps even more ‘fun’ and playful than the Blue option.\n\nYellow\n\nThe final widely available shade for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 is Yellow, and this is arguably the least interesting option, simply because there was a similarly bright and vibrant Yellow option for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5.\n\nStill, the shades aren’t identical, and this is certainly a fun color – boosted further by having those matching camera lens rings, which you don’t get on the Galaxy Z Flip 5.\n\nCrafted Black\n\nWe haven’t yet seen the Crafted Black option at the time of writing, and this shade is exclusive to Samsung’s online store. That means you might not see this option out in the wild as much as the colors above, but you’ll certainly see plenty of other black phones, as black is one of the most common and popular smartphone colors.\n\nAssuming this looks something like the Graphite-colored Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 (or like most black shades) this will be a smart, arguably boring color, but one that won’t look out of place in any setting.\n\nWhite\n\nWhite is another shade that you can only get from Samsung’s online store, and as with Crafted Black we haven’t yet seen this one, but it’s not hard to imagine what this will probably look like. Still, it’s possible that Samsung will opt for an off-white, like the Cream shade that you can get the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 in.\n\nIn any case, White is a common, popular shade for smartphones. It’s not typically the most interesting of options, but nor is it as divisive as the likes of Yellow or Mint.\n\nPeach\n\nPeach is probably the most interesting of the Samsung store exclusive shades that you can get the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 in. We say ‘probably’ not just because it’s subjective, but also because as with the other Samsung store exclusives, we haven’t yet seen the Peach option at the time of writing.\n\nStill, we’d expect from the name that this will be a sort of pale orange, and that’s a shade you can’t get the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 in. Coupled with the fact that this is less widely available than the four main shades further up, and less ordinary than the other Samsung store exclusives, this could be the color to choose if you really want your Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 to stand out.\n\nFor our initial impressions of the flipping foldable phone, check out our hands-on Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 review.\n\nYou might also like"
