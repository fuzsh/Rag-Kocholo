Thank you @Borstelchen for LineageOS 18.1 source code. Thank you @ronnz98 for building this fine /e/OS ROM.

Hello @ronnz98 , thank you very much for your work.

Nevertheless I have an issue. My S6 doesnâ€™t connect to the WPA3/WPA2 access point, it connects only to the WPA2/WPA AP. I tried 1.15, 1.18 and 1.19 versions.

With 1.10 from this thread (Android 11 Samsung S6 devices G920F and G925F Unofficial Special creation - #5 by anon29344687) it works just fine.
