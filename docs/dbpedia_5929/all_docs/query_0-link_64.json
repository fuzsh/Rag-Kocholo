        "text": "The Kuala Lumpur Sentral Station redevelopment is a proposed rebuild of the central station of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nKL Sentral was built in 2001 (replacing Kuala Lumpur Station as the central station), and it was designed to accommodate 100,000 commuters a day. The station now sees 200,000 commuters per day.\n\nThe estimated RM1 billion project will be undertaken by a private developer in exchange for the right to develop commercial and residential buildings. The project is expected to begin at the end of 2024.\n\nHere is my editorial on how to fix KL Sentral.\n\nNews archive\n\n2024\n\nIs KL Sentral’s redevelopment really necessary? – [08/06/24]\n\n“The funds could be used to decentralise the transit network by developing multiple stations and promoting a more balanced urban development.”\n\nResidents demand to be consulted on KL Sentral redevelopment plans – [11/05/24]\n\n“They are concerned over traffic influx, lack of public parking space, and inadequate infrastructure.”\n\nUnclogging the KL Sentral jam – [11/05/24]\n\n“The main issue with KL Sentral is that the congestion is bad and it gets worse when ETS (Electric Train Service) commuters arrive there and continue their journey. This will be looked into in our plans to redevelop the area,”\n\n“What we hope is that the (new) developed area is integrated with the larger KL Sentral area with access to public transportation,”\n\nKL Sentral redevelopment project to begin later this year, says Loke – [10/05/24]\n\n“The station will undergo enhancements to make it more modern, efficient, and seamlessly connected to the surrounding areas.\n\nThese enhancements will involve upgrades, redesigns, repurposing, and rebuilding aimed at achieving a higher level of sophistication and modernity”.\n\n“…the upgraded KL Sentral area will include a link to all buildings, to improve public mobility and access.”\n\nLoke: KL Sentral to be redeveloped [UPDATED] – [10/05/24]\n\n“…the redevelopment would not impact public transport services, such as the LRT, KTM and ETS.”\n\nKL Sentral Station redevelopment project to commence year-end – Loke – [10/05/24]\n\n“The station will undergo enhancements to make it more modern, efficient, and seamlessly connected to the surrounding areas.”\n\n2023\n\nMRCB’s share price up 2.6 per cent on KL Sentral redevelopment plans – [03/08/23]\n\n“Malaysian Resources Corporation Bhd (MRCB)’s share price was up 2.67 per cent to 38.5 sen in early trade, on news that the Cabinet has agreed in principle to allow the company to redevelop Kuala Lumpur Sentral Station.”\n\nCabinet approves MRCB’s KL Sentral rebuild plan, says Loke – [02/08/23]\n\n“The Cabinet has approved Malaysian Resources Corporation Bhd’s (MRCB) plan to rebuild KL Sentral, said transport minister Loke Siew Fook.\n\nHe said the company will bear the cost of the estimated RM1 billion project. In return, it will be given the right to set up commercial units at the transport hub.”"
