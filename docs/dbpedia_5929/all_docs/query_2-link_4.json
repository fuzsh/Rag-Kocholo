Regardless of where you are from or where you are heading to, you will find the most convenient transit at KL Sentral. Apart from Car Rental, Bus & Taxi Services, KL Sentral is also connected to several major rail systems that serve the city of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nKuala Lumpur Integrated Public Transportation Route Map (Click to zoom in)\n\nKL Sentral – A World Class Transportation Hub\n\nStesen Sentral, Malaysia’s largest transit hub, is Kuala Lumpur’s integrated rail transportation centre, offering global connectivity and seamlessly linking all urban and suburban residential, commercial and industrial areas. It is also a direct link to Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Putrajaya (the Federal Government Administrative Centre), Cyberjaya and key areas within the Multimedia Super Corridor. Such amazing connectivity has been established through direct access to important rail systems and links to major highways.\n\nA Self-sustained “City-within-a-City” concept\n\nAs an international business address of choice, Kuala Lumpur Sentral has gained momentum, with the resident as well as visiting population growing exponentially. Originally, this self-sustained city-within-a-city has been planned around Malaysia’s largest transportation hub Stesen Sentral to encourage the use of public transportation as well as to reduce carbon footprint, which in turn has significantly reduced traffic movement within Kuala Lumpur Sentral serving its green agenda.\n\nHowever, with the growing population, Kuala Lumpur Sentral continues to cater to specific needs of its tenants, residents as well as other stakeholders especially to enhance the parking facilities and increase provision for more. For better convenience and ease of travellers, the parking spaces will be nearly doubled in the next 3 to 5 years. Currently, the total parking facilities under construction in commercial, residential, lifestyle components number at 9,354. Additionally, approximately 3000 parking lots will be provisioned when planning for future projects in Kuala Lumpur Sentral.\n\nOpening Hours\n\n24 hours, but most shops and facilities close after midnight\n\nTicket Counters\n\nKLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit: 4:15 AM -to 12:45 AM\n\nLRT (Kelana Jaya Line): 6:00 AM – 11:55 PM\n\nKL Monorail: 6:00 AM – 11:30 PM\n\nKTM Komuter: 6:00 AM – 11:15 PM\n\nKTM ETS and KTM Intercity: 7:00 AM – 9:30 PM\n\nAddress\n\nStesen Sentral Kuala Lumpur, Jalan Stesen Sentral, 50470 Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nContact Details"
