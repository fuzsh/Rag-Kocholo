It's the highrise that's kinked at an angle on the right.\n\nGreat for SPG hopping but if rates were equal, I'd stay at the LM instead.

I did it. You basically walk through KL Sentral, go up the escalator, exit the building from the KLIA Expres side, turn right and walk to the end of the building, then cross the street on the left. I did it with two roller bags and a backpack.\n\nJun 22, 2013, 10:13 pm\n\nJoin Date: Jan 2005\n\nLocation: New Orleans, LA\n\nPrograms: Starwood Platinum, HH Gold\n\nPosts: 133\n\nWe stayed at the aloft a few weeks ago on points. As a platinum, we were in a standard room on a high floor. As others have mentioned, they don't really do much for status, but you do get use of their breakfast buffet which was nice. Good location if you're going to travel to other places by train/bus, but not much else around... here's our full review.\n\nJun 23, 2013, 2:31 am\n\nFlyerTalk Evangelist\n\nJoin Date: Dec 2003\n\nLocation: Benicia, California, USA\n\nPrograms: AA PLT,AS,UA PP,J6,FB,EY,LH,SQ,HH Dmd,Hyatt Glbl,Marriott Plat,IHG Plat,Accor Gold\n\nPosts: 10,845\n\nUseful review, especially since I'll be staying there in two days.

Asking for late check out this morning cos plan to have lunch at Hilton then come back and check out. Was told by the front desk guy the latest can give me is until 1pm. Seem no recognition for plat guest. I told the guy I m a platinum guest but he keep asking me what time is my flight.(4pm late checkout should be no problem if the room available, in other starwood property in kl, they are not even asking and automatically put check out time 4pm) Feeling he is not friendly even though finally he agreed to give me late check-out. I passed him a car park ticket to validate cos we would like to go out and he told me he will charge me again for the car park cos today is consider 2nd day. I have question mark in my mind, i stay for one night, don't the parking rate for house guest is charged by 24 hours then consider per day? He told me 2nd day consider fresh day. I was not happy but I don't want to waste my time to argue with this small amount. Breakfast experience also not very happy. i was putting in a same table with another guest by different waiters. when i took my food and sitting the another guest came and told me he was putting to the same table as well. Finally a waiter solved it by arranging him to another table. A not very good experience this morning. I wish to complain but all staffs don't have name tag at all!! As for plat member, I don't really recommend to stay here. Try once before then you will know how to choose.\n\nJul 7, 2013, 9:18 am\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2006\n\nPrograms: Hyatt Globalist, Lifetime Bonvoy Platinum, HHonors Gold , TK Gold, MH Plat, QR Plat\n\nPosts: 100\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by angeline77\n\n1st time checked-in the hotel yesterday.

That is absolutely ridiculous! So, is a guest supposed to come in and park after 12am?\n\nI am surprised they don't 'honor' 4pm late checkouts- it's practically a right for a Plat to be given 4pm...The staff at Sheraton was actually disappointed I checked out at 11am\n\nLooks like I'm sticking to the Sheraton next round!\n\nJul 7, 2013, 11:14 am\n\nJoin Date: May 2012\n\nPrograms: SPG Plat\n\nPosts: 792\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by angeline77\n\n1st time checked-in the hotel yesterday.

Eventually they decided not to charge me. It should be for 24 hours..

Checkin was quick and painless.\n\nProactive service, porter saw me coming bags and was quick to assist. Sent bags up to room, no problemo.\n\nGot breakfast included, hopefully bonus points will post.\n\nAloft has become an \"it\" spot here. Walked into a fashion show on 2 as well as a 21st birthday party in the Cigar Lounge. Enthusiasm among the staff contagious. Found myself smiling after a day that began by leaving the Park Hyatt Shanghai at 0600.\n\nNov 3, 2013, 7:19 pm\n\nJoin Date: Jan 2012\n\nLocation: San Juan, PR\n\nPrograms: MR AMB/LT, AA EP, TK EP, DL D, B6 M4, F9 100K, IHG AMB/D, HH D, CZR D, FndCd, Sixt D, NTL E, Hz PC\n\nPosts: 432\n\nI stayed here in October 2013; really quite nice, although I think for Platinums the lack of a club lounge and potential upgrades could make other Starwood choices better.\n\nHad a high floor; room was Aloft standard and great. Staff were particularly good (I'd just done a week at the Inter-Continental KL for a conference; nicer room and all there since it is a 3x more expensive hotel, but I'd take the Aloft staff anyday).\n\nGreat cash rates, but even better points. Ended up having a $10 great buffet dinner (50% off for Starwood members) as well as breakfast. Essentially Bangkok-Starwood quality.\n\nToss up on here and the LeM for location. I still really like the Sheraton Imperial and Westin due to upgrades, though.\n\nJan 26, 2014, 2:48 am\n\nJoin Date: Mar 2010\n\nLocation: Europe/SEA\n\nPrograms: TK E+, Bonvoy LT Plat, Hilton Diamond, IHG Platinum, Dusit Gold\n\nPosts: 1,715\n\nAloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral , Malaysia, opened March 22, 2013 [Master Thread]\n\nThe rooms here are a joke, aloft bkk smaller but much nicer. Staff is friendly and very \"talented\" though. Rooftop bar is great. Restaurant brought us cold food... complained and chef came to apologise, got new food cooked and didn't have to pay. Restaurant also tried to sell drinking water as mineral water, complained and received aqua panna.\n\nWalking distance to kl sentral checkin facilities is great. Wouldn't stay here again, room setting make me freak out. Méridien much better value ( awesome pool/ breakfast/ lounge ).\n\nJan 26, 2014, 3:18 am\n\nSuspended\n\nJoin Date: Dec 2001\n\nLocation: SEA(sia)\n\nPosts: 5,181\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by cln\n\naloft bkk smaller but much nicer.\n\nI don't think Aloft BKK rooms are smaller but its certainly nicer.
