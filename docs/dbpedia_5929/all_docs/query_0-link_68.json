        "text": "Kuala Lumpur is the capital city of Malaysia. Previously, it was the capital city for the state of Selangor before it was seceded in 1974 to become the first federal territory and subsequently the capital city of the federation of Malaysia. This city was established in 1859 at the confluence of the Gombak and the Klang rivers. Over the years, the city had developed so much that some parts of it are totally different from the past.\n\nToday’s entry is something special. February 1st is the Federal Territory Day in Malaysia and in conjunction with the special day, I am going to show how Kuala Lumpur looked like in its early days as compared to the present day.\n\nI know that a lot of such photos were published in the newspapers as well as in other blogs. However, I listened to LOOTB‘s advice: surprise ourselves by exploring our own backyard. And with that advice in mind, I embarked on a personal project and toured the city on foot.\n\nSo sit back and relax. Grab some food and drinks and enjoy the photos below!\n\n1. Gombak Bridge and Town Hall\n\nThe photo above is taken from R.S. Murthi’s website. It shows the Gombak Bridge and the Kuala Lumpur Town Hall building circa 1908. From the photo, it can be seen that Kuala Lumpur was still a sleepy town then. People could walk freely in the middle of the road. The bridge’s architecture is also unique to the period.\n\nFast forward to 2014 – the white dome of the Town Hall is now black. The bridge is now a modern 6 lane-road (which is why I couldn’t shoot the photo from the same angle as the photo taken in 1908). The empty skyline is now full with skyscrapers. The biggest difference? The building is not used as a town hall building anymore, instead it is now known as the ‘Panggung Bandaraya’ where theater shows are staged.\n\n2. Train at Kuala Lumpur Railway Station\n\nThis photo of a steam train passing through the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station circa 1950 is also taken from R.S. Murthi’s website. In 1950, steam trains are the most common trains during that era. The Kuala Lumpur Railway Station was also the main terminal for rail network across the Peninsula.\n\nToday, the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station is no longer the main station but intercity trains connecting the Peninsula and the commuter trains still stop at this station. Electric cables powering the commuter trains are also visible. Apart from that, steam trains are no longer operational as petrol-powered locomotive trains are now used for intercity trains.\n\n3. Old Market Square\n\nThe Old Market Square is located near the Central Market. In 1960s, cars were allowed to park at this area as there were a lot of shop houses at this area. One of the most interesting features of this place is the clock tower, which was build around 1937 with an interesting art deco motif. Photo taken from R.S. Murthi’s website.\n\nIn 2014, the Old Market Square is known as Medan Pasar. Cars are not allowed to park here and it is now used as a pedestrian walkway. The clock tower is still there at the same place as in the photo taken in 1960. Some of the shop houses survived from being torn down in the name of development, but most of them were not including the building in the backdrop of the old photo which is now the HSBC tower.\n\n4. Kuala Lumpur Railway Station\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station was the main station of the country back in its early days. However, even since the Kuala Lumpur Sentral station completed, most of the old station roles were assumed by the Sentral station. Nevertheless, the design of the old station which was opened in 1886 and rebuilt in 1910 still awed many, especially with the mixture of Eastern and Western designs. The photo above is taken from R.S Murthi’s website.\n\nToday, the railway station still spot the same design and the same colour (I think, because the old photo is in black and white… LOL). However, if you have sharp eyes, you will realized that apart from not having the roundabout, there is an extension on the right side of the 2014 photo. Yes, the extension of the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station was done in 1986, following the same design of the original building.\n\n5. Confluence of the Rivers\n\nThis circa 1950 photo of the confluence of the 2 rivers taken from R.S. Murthi’s website is where Kuala Lumpur got its name. This confluence (Kuala) used to be muddy (Lumpur) and as such, KL’s forefathers decided to adapt this name. At the background of the photo is Masjid Jamek, one of the oldest mosques in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nIn 1950, it was still possible to see the clouds when one is facing this area. Now, with all the towering skyscrapers, it is almost impossible. Due to rapid development, concrete slabs were also constructed to support the riverbank. As for Masjid Jamek, thank God the coconut trees are still there, it gives the mosque some rustic feeling when looking at it.\n\nDo you think the differences are a lot?\n\n***"
