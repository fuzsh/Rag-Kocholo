        "text": "Kuala Lumpur Sentral (KL Sentral) or Sentral Kuala Lumpur is a transit-oriented development that houses the main railway station of Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. Opened on 16 April 2001, despite its name it is actually even less central than the old Kuala Lumpur Railway Station, a colonial-era landmark that now remains open for local commuter trains only. KL Sentral is the largest railway station in Southeast Asia.[citation needed]\n\nKL Sentral was designed as an intermodal transportation hub. Most of Kuala Lumpur's passenger rail lines serve KL Sentral, while many intercity trains serving Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore start there. All the railway components of the scheme have been completed, but some other parts such as shopping malls, offices and apartments are still under construction and are expected to be complete by 2015.[1] It was also designed to be a new business and financial hub for Kuala Lumpur.\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn 1994, with the objective to enhance Kuala Lumpur city’s public transportation, the Government of Malaysia awarded a contract to a consortium to transform 72 acres (290,000 m2) at Kuala Lumpur’s old railway marshalling yard into a modern transit hub within a self-contained urban development.\n\nThe consortium, led by Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB) appointed renowned architectKisho Kurokawa and Associates, who also designed the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) among many prominent structures around the world, to design the master plan for the entire development. To ensure that the components planned are market driven and conform to market demand Jones Lang Wootton was commissioned in 1995 to work on the master plan for the entire development and was able to advise on market driven components and ensure that each component complemented each other – co-existing in harmony.\n\nKL Sentral’s recent achievement of being awarded Malaysia’s first Multimedia Super Corridor(MSC) cybercentre launched the development into a new privileged status, allowing it to amplify its world-class physical and information infrastructure and further complement the MSC hub,Cyberjaya, by providing another option for companies that want to reap the benefits of MSC status and be closer to their customers.\n\nDevelopment Zones[]\n\nKL Sentral is a huge place with mixed developments. The area is divided into several plots of land, each with a specific purpose. All development should complete by 2015.[1]\n\nLot Development Type Name Notes A Office CIMBHeadquarters (Menara CIMB) Under construction, completion date 2011 B Office Q Sentral Announced on July 2010.

Constructions for all buildings began in H2 2008 and expected to be done by 2012. Will be the location of Kota Damansara-Cheras Line and offer connectivity to Stesen Sentral and also offer integration with KL Monorail.\n\nTwo office towers, a 27-story and 37-story, will be built on top of the mall. A 28-story hotel also will be will on top of the mall.\n\nH Transportation Stesen Sentral Completed in 2000, serving KTM Komuter, KTM Intercity, KLIA Transit, KLIA Ekspres and Kelana Jaya Line.

Phase 2 completed in 2007. N Office 1 Sentral Tower Completed in 2007. Sold to Tabung Haji\n\nOffice zones[]\n\n[2][3]The southern end of Kuala Lumpur Sentral has seen substantial additions of several commercial and civic buildings since 2001.\n\nOffice zones in KL Sentral account for more than 50% of the total land area. The developer intends that KL Sentral will ultimately be the business and financial hub of Kuala Lumpur.\n\n[edit]Lot A: CIMB Headquarters (Menara CIMB)[]\n\nLot A will be the new headquarters for CIMB Group which is located facing the National Museum. As of June 2011, the new headquarters' name which appears on the construction site is Menara CIMB (CIMB Tower). The company acquired the land in July 2008, and construction is expected to begin in Q4 2007 and complete in 2011. It is unknown how many floors there will be but it should have around 600,000 sq ft (56,000 m2) of office space available.[2]\n\n[edit]Lot M: Plaza Sentral[]\n\nLot M or Plaza Sentral is a completed office complex in the west of KL Sentral. The complex was completed in two stages.\n\nPhase I was completed in June 2001, comprising three blocks and total gross floor area of 785,000 sq ft (72,900 m2). Offering prestigious office suites, Plaza Sentral was sold and quickly taken up by multinationals and Malaysian companies alike, eager to take advantage of the global connectivity and convenience of working in KL Sentral. Its take-up rate is reaching 100%.[citation needed]\n\nPhase II was launched in September 2003 due to the escalating demand for premium office space. It has since been fully taken up. Comprising two towers - 18-storey and 26-storey - made up of four blocks and a total gross floor area of 879,381 sq ft (81,697.2 m2), the building was completed in 2006. Tenants includeBritish Telecom and Maxis Communications.\n\nSentral Tower, a purpose-built 30-storey office tower, was sold to Lembaga Tabung Haji for RM161.46mil in March 2004.\n\n[edit]Lot J: Sooka Sentral & 4 Office Towers[]\n\nLot J is a development lot for four 35-storey office towers of identical architecture.\n\nLot J was sold to United Engineers (M) Bhd (UEM) in May 2005 with plans for four towers. Tower A was built by UEM for its corporate headquarters called Mercu UEM on the prime piece of land with a gross floor area of 1,300,000 sq ft (120,000 m2). Tower B will be an office tower for the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority. Tower C was built by Quill Realty Sdn Bhd and sold to Suruhanjaya Syarikat Malaysia (SSM) for its corporate headquarters. Tower D is an office building built by Quill, named Quill 7. [3]\n\nA development on Lot J is the 180,000 sq ft (17,000 m2) six-storey lifestyle centre which houses a fitness and spa centre, business centre, food court, restaurants and alfresco dining facilities. This development, called Sooka Sentral, opened its doors in December 2007.\n\n[edit]Lot N: 1 Sentral Tower[]\n\n1 Sentral Tower is an office tower, offering a gross floor area of 453,000 sq ft (42,100 m2). Construction was completed in 2007. It houses companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, MRCB and General Electric.\n\n[edit]Others[]\n\nLot B has been proposed as a financial area for KL Sentral. No construction has taken place.\n\nLot F is planned for a future office block. Currently, the base is used for a furniture exhibition mall and Food and Beverage (F&B) centre.\n\n[edit]Entertainment zones[]\n\nLot E will be a hub for entertainment and convention centre in making KL Sentral an entertainment hub of Kuala Lumpur. The deck of this development has been completed.\n\n[edit]Lot G: Nu Sentral[]\n\nLot G, located in the south of KL Sentral will consist of 1,200,000 sq ft (110,000 m2) shopping complex, 600,000 sq ft (56,000 m2) office block, 500,000 sq ft (46,000 m2) serviced apartments, and a 546,000 sq ft (50,700 m2) three-star hotel. Nu Sentral, as it will be called, will offer an integrated connection with the KL Monorail Sentral station and it will be the station of the new Kota Damansara-Cheras Line. Development works commenced in 2H2008 and is expected to be completed in 2012. The land was previously used as a parking lot and a short-cut for pedestrians from Brickfields and the KL Sentral Monorail station to KL Sentral proper. For some time there was an open-air market on the land but it was closed down in preparation for construction.\n\nIn January 2008 MRCB set up a joint venture company with Pelaburan Hartanah Bumiputera Bhd (PHBB) named Jewel Surprises Sdn Bhd to develop the area. The new company will hold a lease on the plot of land for 99 years. [4]\n\nTransportation zone[]\n\n[edit]Lot H: Stesen Sentral[]\n\n[4][5]KL Sentral and surroundingsStesen Sentral (English: Central Station) is the name of Lot H, which is designated the transportation hub within its KL Sentral development project, although both the public and connected transit lines generally refer to the station itself as \"KL Sentral\".\n\nStesen Sentral, designed to house six rail networks, was completed in December 2000 and the rail, retail and food and beverage operations began in April 2001. Standing on 9.3 acres (38,000 m2), the main building has a gross floor area of half a million sq ft and the specifications were based on passenger projections up to the year 2020, which is when Malaysia aspires to be a fully developed nation.\n\nIn 2008, Stesen Sentral registered over 100,000 passengers daily, which translates into 36.5 million people a year.\n\n[edit]Rail services[]\n\nThe following services serve Stesen Sentral:\n\nExpress Rail Link (ERL): high-speed airport train\n\nKLIA Ekspres: high-speed direct train to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA)\n\nKLIA Transit: high-speed commuter train service to KLIA\n\nKTM Komuter: Klang Valley electric commuter train service\n\nSentul-Port Klang Line\n\nRawang-Seremban Line with the Rawang-Kuala Kubu Bharu Shuttle Route\n\nKTM intercity trains: intercity trains\n\nIntercity trains that connects from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok and Singapore.\n\nRapidKL Rail\n\nKelana Jaya Line: Kelana Jaya-Gombak light rail transit (LRT) service\n\nKL Monorail's KL Sentral station is across busy Jalan Tun Sambanthan, a 410 m walk away by covered walkway.\n\nMy Rapid Transit (MRT)'s KL Sentral station will be built nearly across Jalan Travers.\n\nStesen Sentral is divided into separate sections for different rail services:\n\nLevel One of Transit Concourse for urban public transit services: KTM Komuter, KLIA Transit and the Kelana Jaya Line light rail line.\n\nLevel Two of Transit Concourse for KTM intercity trains.\n\nKL City Air Terminal (KL CAT) on Level One for the KLIA Ekspres, the dedicated fast rail service to Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) (see sectionbelow).\n\nStesen Sentral also has retail and food outlets and a food court. Hidden from public view is KTM's maintenance depot beneath the complex. There is a facility for purchasing and reloading the Touch 'n Go card in this station.\n\nStesen Sentral will be able to accommodate 50 million passengers a year and up to 100 million by 2020 (KL Sentral website).\n\n[edit]Lot G : Nu Sentral[]\n\nIt is expected that Lot G will serve Kota Damansara-Cheras Line and provide integration with KL Monorail station and other lines in Stesen Sentral.\n\n[edit]KL City Air Terminal[]\n\nLocated within Stesen Sentral, the KL City Air Terminal (KL CAT) is virtually an extension of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. It is recognised by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) as a city destination, with the code XKL. It was officially opened together with the KLIA Ekspres rail line on 14 April 2002.\n\nBesides being the departure and arrival point for the KLIA Ekspres, KL CAT also has luggage check-in services. Passengers flying Malaysia Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Emirates Airline and Royal Brunei Airlines may check in luggage at KL CAT. The minimum check-in time is two hours before flight departure time. On 13 July 2007, Express Rail Link Sendirian Berhad, the operator of KLIA Ekspres, announced that from 23 July 2007 onwards, passengers flying on all 43 airlines serving the Kuala Lumpur International Airport would be able to check in their luggage at KL CAT should the airline offer city check-in service.\n\nThere were plans to offer check-out services but these have not materialised.\n\n[edit]Hotels and residential zones[]\n\n[edit]Lot C: St Regis Hotel[]\n\nLot C will house the St Regis Hotel. The site is currently under construction and it is expected to complete by 2014. The hotel will feature 200 guest rooms and 200 whole ownership St Regis branded Residence.[5]\n\n[edit]Lot D: 60-storey Residential Tower[]\n\nLot D will consist a single 60-storey residential tower overlooking the Lake Gardens and the city. It will be jointly developed by MRCB, Capitaland and Quill Group. It is currently pending approval from the city hall.[6]\n\n[edit]Lot I : Hilton KL & Le Méridien Hotels[]\n\nLot I consists of two skyscraper hotels occupied by Hilton Kuala Lumpur & Le Méridien, owned by Daito Asia Development Sdn. Bhd. and Daisho Asia Development Sdn. Bhd. respectively. The hotels opened for business in September and October 2004 respectively.\n\n[edit]Lot K and L: Suasana Sentral and Suasana Sentral Loft[]\n\nLot K is the location of a serviced apartment, Suasana Sentral. Suasana Sentral consists of two blocks, or 400 units of apartments. It was completed in 2002 and is fully sold and occupied, with about 40% of the buyers coming from the international community.[citation needed]\n\nThe second phase of condominiums on Lot L, Suasana Sentral Loft was launched in early 2005 and began occupancy in early 2008. The 37 and 38-storey apartment towers have a total of 600 units. All have been sold.[citation needed]\n\n[edit]Others[]\n\nIn December 2006, a joint venture company acquired Lot D and will develop residential and serviced apartments with supporting retail amenities. This luxury development will face the National Museum, Lake Gardens as well as KL City Centre. Construction is expected to commence by early 2008 and to be completed in 2010.\n\nIn June 2007, a joint venture company purchased Lot C for the development of a 6-star hotel, 6-star residences and prime offices. Work on the 1,400,000 sq ft (130,000 m2) development is expected to start in 2008.\n\nKL Sentral Monorail station[]\n\nThe Kuala Lumpur Monorail station is not directly connected to the Kuala Lumpur Sentral transport hub. Despite its proximity to the building, passengers must walk a 410-metre path around a construction site (Lot G, above). It stands on Jalan Tun Sambanthan in Brickfields. The station is a terminating stop for the KL Monorail line. There are plans to move the monorail station closer to the main station by integrating it into the main shopping center at Lot G. The station uses the Spanish solution, having one rail line with a platform on each side, for passengers embarking and disembarking the train separately.\n\n[edit]KL Sentral as a bus hub[]\n\nKL Sentral has also been made a city bus hub by rapidKL as part of its bus network revamp. It is the bus hub for city shuttle (BANDAR) bus routes and trunk (UTAMA) bus routes.[citation needed]\n\nBuses to Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) Main and Low Cost Carrier Terminals (LCCT) operate from KL Sentral, while other bus operators go near KL Sentral along Jalan Tun Sambanthan.\n\nrapidKL buses:\n\nCity Shuttle: B112\n\nTrunk buses: U60, U63, U64, U65, U66, U67, U68, U69, U70, U71, U72, U73, U74, U75, U76, U80, U81, U82, U83, U84, U85, U87, U88\n\nExpress buses: E1, E4\n\nThe rapidKL routes radiating out from KL Sentral with connecting City shuttles, Trunk shuttles, Local shuttles and Express buses.
