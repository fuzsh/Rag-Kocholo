Cardholders were shocked to find out that they were being charged between RM20 and RM50 for their parking upon checking the credit card statements. This post intends to clear up all the mystery behind this. Visa payWave at Parking In the past few years, many parking operators in Malaysia have set up cashless payment methods at the parking lot, mainly Touch ‘N Go & Visa payWave. It is all about going cashless for public convenience. Either method eliminates the need for parking users to get a parking ticket at the entrance and later pay at the payment terminal before exiting. You can tap your Touch ‘N Go card or payWave cards at the contactless reader at the entrance, park your car as usual, and later tap your card again at the contactless reader at the exit. This has eliminated some parking hassles – lost parking tickets, insufficient small notes/coins when paying at the parking machine. What happens when you use your Visa PayWave cards at parking? When you tap your card at the contactless terminal of the entrance of a parking lot, the system will authorise the transaction […]\n\nSunway Pyramid Shopping Mall is a shopping mall at Bandar Sunway, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.
