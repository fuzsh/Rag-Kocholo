        "text": "Whether you have a layover, overnight sleepover or you are just quickly passing through, our Kuala Lumpur Airport Guide is a great place to start planning your visit. Here, you’ll find information on services and facilities available inside the airport – including details about airport lounges, WiFi, mobile charging points, lockers, 24-hour food options, nearby hotels, and everything in between.\n\nAirport Lounges\n\nAirport Hotels\n\nAirport WiFi\n\nShowers\n\nRest Zones\n\nLuggage Storage\n\nMobile Charging\n\nLong cushioned benches were nice and we pushed a couple of these together in a more remote area to make a ‘double bed’ – lisadridenour\n\nKUL Airport Overview\n\nTo help you plan your layover or overnight sleepover, here is a quick run-down about what to expect during your time at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.\n\nWhat to Expect\n\nKuala Lumpur Airport (code: KUL) is a large, and busy, global hub with two terminals: KLIA 1 and KLIA2. KLIA 1 has three areas: the main terminal, the contact pier and Satellite Terminal A, which is connected by train. KLIA 2 is smaller and caters to low cost carriers. It is located 6km from KLIA 1, and you can connect to it by a free shuttle bus.\n\nThe airport has a decent range of amenities – including showers, TV lounges, rest zones and free WiFi. There are a number of 24/7 restaurants and convenience stores. For those looking for a little added comfort, there are first class lounges, many of which have showers, that economy class passengers can pay to access. See Airport Lounges in the guide below for locations and access information.\n\nSleeping in Kuala Lumpur Airport\n\nKLIA is generally quite popular with airport sleepers – so much so that the good spots get scooped up quickly! The best and most plentiful chairs and benches are located airside in the Main Terminal, with some especially good spots located near the 2nd floor food court and the Samsung lounge. KLIA2 gets mixed reviews, with some travellers recommending avoidance if possible. No matter where you sleep, bring eyeshades and earplugs or noise cancelling headphones, as this airport is busy around the clock. That said, while the airport is open 24-hours, some travellers found themselves restricted landside if they tried to clear security late at night. Explore our guide to sleeping in Kuala Lumpur Airport or read some traveller airport reviews for more tips. If you’re looking for uninterrupted sleep, there is a transit hotel and sleep pods inside the airport, and several hotels nearby that are connected with shuttles. See the Airport Hotels section below for locations.\n\nGood to Know\n\nThere are a lot of different ways people and airlines refer to the various terminals at Kuala Lumpur. The airport officially refers to its terminals as KLIA1 and KLIA2. However, some airlines will call them Terminal 1 and Terminal 2. Other airlines will call the Main Terminal, “Terminal M” or “TM”. The Contact Pier is sometimes referred to as CP1.\n\nTo help us keep this guide up-to-date, you can add or update information or write a review to submit airport tips and photos. You can also visit the airport’s website for current information. For more airport information continue scrolling down to explore more in our Kuala Lumpur Airport Guide.\n\nIn this guide we may refer to locations as “landside” and “airside”. Landside is the public area of the terminal located in the non-secure zone, before security. Airside is the secure area of the terminal that you must reach by going through security.
