        "text": "Photo credit: Anisha Tulika, Fasyah Halim, KLIA Ekspres\n\nGetting from KL Sentral to KLIA Terminal 1 & Terminal 2\n\nJetting off to your next holiday destination? If you are travelling to the airport from Kuala Lumpur, the best place you can depart from is none other than KL Sentral, Malaysia's largest transit hub. Here, there are multiple modes of transport, such as trains and buses, that you can hop on to get to KLIA within an hour. Start planning your trip route with this handy guide of options to travel from KL to KLIA!\n\nHow to get to KLIA from KL Sentral\n\n1. By train\n\nIf you want a fuss-free and convenient way to travel to the airport, then taking the train would be your best bet. With the KLIA Ekspres, you can travel between KL Sentral and KLIA terminals 1 & 2 in less than 30 minutes, the fastest route between the two destinations. The service also runs every 20 minutes every day, including weekends and public holidays.\n\nAll carriages are air-conditioned and are equipped with comfortable seats, washrooms, free WiFi, and designated spaces for both light and large luggage. KLIA Ekspres even has porters to help you load and unload luggage for you, so you won't have to worry about carrying your luggage either!\n\nPrice (one-way): RM49.50 (adult), RM22.50 (child)\n\nPrice (round trip): RM91 (adult), RM40 (child)\n\nDuration: 28 minutes (KL Sentral - KLIA T1), 31 minutes (KL Sentral - KLIA T2)\n\n2. By bus\n\nTravelling by bus is the most affordable way to get to KLIA. There are different bus operators you can choose from, such as Aerobus, but they charge similar bus fare, with all of them within the range of RM12-15 for a one-way ride.\n\nBus tickets are available for purchase online as well as at the ticketing counter at KL Sentral, and there are usually departures every other hour. Most buses that depart from KL Sentral will drop passengers off at KLIA2 first, before proceeding to KLIA.\n\nPrice: From RM15 (one-way)\n\nDuration: Approximately 1 hour\n\n3. By car\n\nTraveling to KLIA by car is also a relatively straightforward journey, and there are a couple of routes you can take if you're departing from KL Sentral. You can choose between taking the more direct Maju Expressway (MEX) route, or take the North-South Expressway (NSE) and ELITE Highway to get there.\n\nToll price: RM3.50 (MEX-Putrajaya toll), RM4.30 (ELITE - KLIA toll), RM4.30 (ELITE-Putrajaya toll)\n\nDuration: Approximately 50 minutes\n\n💡 If you are self-driving to KLIA, keep these in mind:\n\nToll fees: Both the MEX and ELITE highways charge toll fees, so make sure that you have a sufficient amount in your Touch 'n Go card / RFID / credit or debit cards for toll payments.\n\nTraffic conditions: Plan your travel time accordingly by checking the traffic conditions, as traffic may pick up during peak hours.\n\nNavigation apps: Consider using navigation apps like Waze or Google Maps for real-time updates on traffic and the best routes.\n\nParking fees: If you plan to park at the airport, be prepared to pay parking fees at KLIA T1 and T2 that start from RM5 per hour and a daily flat rate at RM52 per day.\n\nIf you're exploring KL as a tourist or from a different state, you can also rent a vehicle available for pick up at KL or the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) for a hassle-free exploration. You can choose to rent from a varied selection of compact cars, SUVs, and even vans to suit your needs.\n\n4. By ride hailing service or private driver\n\nIf you would prefer to not drive, you can opt to hop onto a taxi or use a ride-hailing service instead, such as Grab or other local alternatives to travel to KLIA. There are dedicated waiting areas for taxis and ride-hailing vehicles at KL Sentral.\n\nAlternatively, you can always charter a private airport transfer for more flexibility! Hop aboard a modern and air-conditioned vehicle and let the driver do the driving!
