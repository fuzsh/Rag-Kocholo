        "text": "The Kuala Lumpur to Penang train is arguably the best train journey in Malaysia. Read on for our full review and top tips for riding the rails from KL to Butterworth.\n\nPenang has always been well connected to the rest of Malaysia, in particular to the capital city of Kuala Lumpur, 350km to the south. Whilst it’s possible to drive, fly, or take the bus, the easiest and most comfortable option is the train between Kuala Lumpur and Penang via the fast, efficient and affordable ETS service.\n\nWith a journey time of just over four hours, the train links the city centre of KL to the mainland city of Butterworth, leaving just a short ferry or Grab ride onto Penang Island. So, if you’re struggling to decide whether to visit Kuala Lumpur or Penang, the excellent train service perhaps provides the answer; instead of choosing one, visit both and let the train take the strain.\n\nHow to book tickets for the Kuala Lumpur to Penang train\n\nTickets can be booked either online or at any station in Malaysia. From our experience, the online booking system is simple to use and tickets are issued immediately as a PDF (and don’t need to be printed), so we wouldn’t recommend booking at the station unless you have a good reason.\n\nThe official online booking system is called KITS (standing for KTMB Integrated Ticketing System) and only requires you to complete a quick registration process before buying tickets. When you register, you’ll either need your MyKad details (for Malaysians), or your passport number (for anyone else). It only takes a couple of minutes and you don’t require a Malaysian mobile phone number. Once registered, you’re able to start the process to book tickets online.\n\nThe simple user interface lets you enter your journey details before showing the available options (plus a handy indicator of how many seats are available for a given journey). After selecting your journey, you select your carriage and preferred seats; if you’re travelling as a family of four, we recommend choosing the four seats around the table for a comfortable journey.\n\nCheck out the ‘On Board’ section below for information on the differences between the carriages.\n\nTickets cost RM81 for adults and RM45 for children aged 4 – 12.\n\nWhat route does it take\n\nThe railway network in Malaysia is undergoing continuous improvement works, one of which has been to introduce an electric, fast line between Gemas in the south and Padang Besar in the north (at the Thai border). The KL to Penang route uses this line with the service starting in KL and terminating in Butterworth.\n\nThere are five Platinum services per day (which stop at a limited number of stations) and one Gold service (which originates at Gemas and stops more often). Try to get one of the Platinum services if you can as these are quicker and offer Business Class seats if you fancy an extra bit of comfort, plus free food and water.\n\nAll of the trains head up the west coast of Malaysia (known as the mainline) and pass through Ipoh.\n\nYour onwards journey from Butterworth\n\nIf you’re heading onto Penang Island, you have the choice of taking the ferry across to George Town, or take a Grab car over the bridge onto the island.\n\nFor both the ferry and Grab, you need to walk towards Penang Sentral Mall which is five minutes away from the station along an indoor walkway. It’s slightly uphill and makes for a tiring walk, especially if you’re travelling with a large amount of luggage. For the ferry turn left at the end of the walkway and for Grab, turn right and enter the mall.\n\nThe ferries run every hour (RM2) and are the recommended option if the timings match, otherwise head into Penang Sentral Mall and take a Grab car from the e-hailing area on Level 8 (take the lifts directly in front of you when entering the mall). It’ll take about 40 minutes in a Grab depending on traffic, whilst the ferry only takes about ten minutes and drops you right in the heart of George Town.\n\nFinal thoughts about the Kuala Lumpur to Penang train\n\nIn our opinion, a train journey remains the most iconic way to travel between Kuala Lumpur and Penang. With the introduction of the ETS trains, the journey is now modern, reliable and straightforward, even if it has lost some of the charm it once had."
