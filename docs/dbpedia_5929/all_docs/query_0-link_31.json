        "text": "Public transport is an important factor to consider when traveling to a new country. You’ve probably planned how to get to Kuala Lumpur, but you also need to consider how to get around when you’re here.\n\nFrom trains, buses, taxis and of course, walking, there are various modes of transport available in Kuala Lumpur. However, if you are staying at InterContinental Kuala Lumpur, you’re in luck as our hotel is conveniently located near key transportation options which allow you to get around quicker and easier. Thus, here is our quick public transport guide on getting around the bustling city (and wherever you may need to go).\n\nHead to KL Sentral\n\nConsidered as Malaysia’s largest transit hub, KL Sentral offers a seamless travelling experience connecting buses and train lines together. You may want to familiarise yourself with this place as it serves as the main station to commute and we highly recommend mapping a route around here for convenience. There is also an information counter with English-speaking staff available and a Tourism Malaysia counter for any enquiries you may have. Nevertheless, to make it easier for you, here are some explainers on the various train types you’ll stumble upon:\n\nLRT: One of the more common modes of public transport, the Light Rail Transit (LRT) has many stations located in the popular areas of KL and Klang Valley. With seven different lines, the LRT is seamlessly integrated with the KL Monorail, MRT, KTM, KLIA Express and KLIA Transit ERL to make it easier to transfer from one line to another.\n\nMRT: The Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) offers three lines - one looping around Kuala Lumpur’s city centre and the two others spreading out to the northwest and southeast neighbourhoods which include Damansara, Kajang and Cheras. Certain stations are also connected to the LRT and KTM for added convenience during transits.\n\nKTM: Another way to travel around the city centre and suburban areas is by using the Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) Komuter train service. If you’re looking to travel to the northern and southern Peninsular states of Malaysia, the KTM would be a cheaper and ideal option as it has stations in states such as Kedah, Perak and Seremban.\n\nKLIA Express and KLIA Transit ERL: The KLIA Transit Express Rail Link (ERL) is a commuter rail service that makes quick stops at KL Sentral, Bandar Tasik Selatan, Putrajaya, Cyberjaya, Salak Tinggi, KLIA and KLIA 2 ERL stations. However, if you’re looking for the fastest and easiest way to get to and from the airport, the KLIA Express is a mere 30-minute non-stop airport rail link that takes you directly to the both airports – the best option if you’re worried about changing trains!\n\nGrab A Taxi\n\nTaxi in Kuala Lumpur, you are able to hail a taxi from the side of the road if you spot a vacant one. However, if you don’t come across one there are various ride-hailing apps that you can use to secure a ride or if you are in major areas such as Bukit Bintang, you will find many taxi-hailing spots. Here are some options:\n\nGrab/Taxi: One of the most popular ride-hailing apps, Grab, offers a variety of transport such as MyTeksi, GrabCar and GrabShare. You can download the app and use it on your smartphone when you’re connected to the Wi-Fi or if you have mobile data. As Grab has recently implemented new regulations for Grab drivers, you may find that you have to wait a little longer to secure a ride, especially during peak hours.\n\nMyCar: Another app you can use is MyCar, which offers slightly cheaper rides compared to other apps. However, do bear in mind that this company is relatively new and there may not be as many drivers around so you may not secure a ride immediately.\n\nCatch A Bus\n\nA common transportation options for locals, buses are aplenty in the city as often time if you’re going places that are inaccessible via trains, you can hop on a bus and it will most likely be able to take you there. You will also notice various bus stops during a quick stroll in the city. Thus, here is what you need to know about buses in Kuala Lumpur:\n\nGo KL: The best option to get around Kuala Lumpur’s city centre for free is Go KL’s bus. These pink buses are pretty hard to miss and there’s a bus stop right outside our hotel! Making stops at Bukit Bintang, Chinatown and more, this free air-conditioned city bus offers free Wi-Fi to ensure you stay connected during your travels.\n\nRapidKL: Another major bus service in Kuala Lumpur is RapidKL, with several lines taking you around and outside of Kuala Lumpur’s city centre. With bus stops nearby our hotel, you can easily hop on a bus and pay in exact change or use a Touch N Go card to tap on or off.\n\nWhy not Walk\n\nThe oldest form of transportation and the healthiest, is of course, walking. Plus, if you are staying with us, there are various areas within walking distance of our hotel such as:\n\nKLCC Shopping Mall: A popular shopping mall at the foot of the Petronas Twin Towers, you will find an abundance of upscale stores and tourist attractions here, such as Aquaria KLCC, an oceanarium, and Petrosains, a science discovery centre for kids.\n\nAvenue K Shopping Mall: Located across from KLCC Shopping Mall, there are many shopping outlets for you to get your retail therapy along with various restaurants of various cuisines to fill you up.\n\nKLCC Park: With lots of lush greenery, this 50-acre urban park offers a range of activities where you can jog at the jogging track, let your kids enjoy the children’s playground and more!\n\nRobinsons Department Store: If you’re looking for fashion, home or lifestyle items, Robinsons is bound to have it. They have a food court with local dishes and a salon as well if you’re looking for a pampering session.\n\nIntermark Mall: Only a 5-minute walk from our hotel, this mall is accessible via the skybridge nearby the LRT. You can choose to shop at the wide selection of stores available or if you’re looking to somewhere to eat, their food court offers delicious local food and snacks to satisfy your appetite.\n\nWith many ways to travel around Kuala Lumpur, our friendly concierge is more than happy to advise you on the best way to get to your destination. If you are looking to explore outside of the city centre, we have rounded up five places in Kuala Lumpur to list on your itinerary for a memorable trip."
