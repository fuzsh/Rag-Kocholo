The Kuala Lumpur Sentral Station redevelopment is a proposed rebuild of the central station of Kuala Lumpur.

KL Sentral was built in 2001 (replacing Kuala Lumpur Station as the central station), and it was designed to accommodate 100,000 commuters a day. The station now sees 200,000 commuters per day.

The estimated RM1 billion project will be undertaken by a private developer in exchange for the right to develop commercial and residential buildings. The project is expected to begin at the end of 2024.

Here is my editorial on how to fix KL Sentral.
