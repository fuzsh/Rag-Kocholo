        "text": "Former Dallas Cowboys running back Duane Thomas, who won Super Bowl VI after leading the NFL in rushing touchdowns in 1971, has died at the age of 77, the Dallas Morning News reported on Tuesday (August 6).\n\nThomas' cause of death was not publicly revealed as of Wednesday (August 7) morning. Former Cowboys teammate Thomas 'Hollywood' Henderson shared a Facebook post tributing Thomas on Monday (August 5).\n\n“The Great Duane Thomas passed away yesterday,” Henderson wrote. “He was a great Cowboy. On his come back he was one of my roommates in Thousand Oaks. Lots of laughs and moments.RIP DUANE THOMAS.”\n\nThomas was selected by the Cowboys at No. 23 overall in the 1970 NFL Draft and was the team's leading rusher during his rookie season, recording a career-best 803 yards and five touchdowns on 151 attempts. The former West Texas standout stirred controversy the following offseason when he called legendary Cowboys head coach Tom Landry a \"plastic man\" after the team's front office refused to renegotiate his contract and was traded to the New England Patriots, though the deal was voided by then-NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle.\n\nThe running back returned to Dallas but vowed not to speak to teammates, coaches or media during the entire season. Thomas went on to lead the NFL with 11 rushing touchdowns and 13 total touchdowns the following season, along with 793 rushing yards and 13 receptions for 153 yards, during the 1971 season, recording 85 yards and one touchdown in Super Bowl VI, Dallas' first in franchise history, as well as scoring a touchdown in each of the Cowboys' three postseason wins.\n\nThomas was traded to the then-San Diego Chargers the following offseason but suspended for failing to report and never appeared in a game for the franchise. The Dallas native spent the 1973 and the 1974 seasons with the now-Washington Commanders, as well as the 1975 season with the Hawaiians of the defunct World Football League."
