        "text": "Take me back to May 7, 1993\n\nLet's take a stroll down memory lane.\n\nThe date is May 7, 1993, and it's a Friday. Anyone born today will have the star sign Taurus. Many people have \"that Friday feeling\" and are looking forward to the weekend.\n\nThe summer of 1993 has finally arrived. The weather has warmed up, and the evenings are brighter than usual. The school year is nearly finished. In America, the song \"Informer\" by Snow is at the top of the singles charts, while \"Five Live (EP)\" by George Michael & Queen with Lisa Stansfield is the number-one song in the UK. Bill Clinton is the President of the United States, and the movie Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story is at the top of the box office.\n\nJohn Major is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. On television, people are watching popular shows such as \"Seinfeld\", \"Family Matters\", \"Martin\", and \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\". Texting is not a thing yet. Instead, people are using landline phones and pagers. Furthermore, most people have never heard of the Internet.\n\nA civil war is taking place in the African country of Rwanda. In fashion, many of the trends from the late 1980s are still in vogue. Colored tights, denim overalls, leotards, flannel shirts, and shoulder pads are all fashionable at the moment. Grunge fashion has also become mainstream, popularizing band t-shirts, ripped jeans, mom jeans, and Doc Martens. A war is continuing to rage in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nMeanwhile, in technology news, a relatively new storage format called the CD is beginning to outpace the regular cassette tape in music sales. The disc-based format gives listeners the ability to skip between songs instead of having to manually rewind and forward. A playing discs game called \"Pogs\" is currently spreading in popularity throughout the world. It's 1993, so radio stations are being dominated by the likes of Meat Loaf, UB40, Snow, Haddaway, Whitney Houston, Take That, Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey.\n\nIn television news, a cartoon version of singer Barry White has appeared on the latest episode of The Simpsons. In tennis, there is shock at the news that Monica Seles has been stabbed in the shoulder during a match in Hamburg, Germany. The attack is believed to have been carried out by a mentally unstable fan who is obsessed with Steffi Graf. In Sri Lanka, president Ranasinghe Premadasa has been assassinated by a suicide bomber in the city of Colombo.\n\nIn England, Manchester United have just won their first league title in 23 years. In the end, they managed to fight off Norwich and runners-up Aston Villa. In music, Miami group \"Tag Team\" have just released their new single \"Whoomp! (There It Is)\". If you were to travel back to this day, notable figures such as Conway Twitty, Dražen Petrović, Pat Nixon, and Reggie Lewis would all still be alive.\n\nPeople are playing video games such as \"Duck Hunt\", \"Kirby's Dream Land\", \"Final Fantasy V\", and \"Tecmo NBA Basketball\". Kids and teenagers are watching TV shows such as \"Married... with Children\", \"The Wonder Years\", \"Blossom\", and \"The Addams Family\". Children are playing with toys such as Micro Machines, the SEGA Game Gear, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), and Action Man."
