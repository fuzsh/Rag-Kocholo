        "text": "EPISODE #1920: SUPERSTARS OF SPORTS\n\nPhil Esposito: won $11K for American Foundation for Age Research\n\nBill Walton: won $27,470 for Rex Foundation and Ex-NBA Players Association\n\nDick Butkus: won $29,200 for Serra Retreat Center\n\nRound 1: CLUE\n\nPhil’s first w/ two S’s for $800, a $200 M, an N for the Free SPIN (like the previous night, he tried to pick it up before calling a letter), but then a baddie of Y. Second, Bill LaTed out (and he tried to ask Pat “Do I get another turn?” — no, you don’t). Third, Dick called up a $450 D, but then L for loss. On Phil’s second turn, he said a not-so-good consonant of G on $1K and used the FS. Next up were a $500 H, SIX T’s for another $1,200, three E’s, and a $200 F to clean out the consonants. After buying three O’s…\n\nM O T T O\n\nO F / T H E\n\n_ N _ T E D\n\nS T _ T E S\n\n…he solved for $2,400, but did he know the MOTTO OF THE UNITED STATES for the $500 bonus? Not with a total blank. Bill, however, got the right one of “In God We Trust”.\n\nDUDS: Y (Phil), L (Dick), G (Phil)\n\nSOLE LaT: Bill\n\nFEATURED PRIZE: Chevrolet Geo Metro convertible worth $10,954\n\nRound 2: THE 60’s\n\n(Oddly enough, $3,500 wasn’t used this round.)\n\nBill LaTed out from the get-go. Dick secondly uncovered two N’s for a grand, two S’s to double up, a $2,500 R, two A’s, a $600 T, three E’s, but then D for dud. Phil next picked a $400 B, but then repeated the D while on the car (and it appeared he dropped the “S-bomb” that got censored, and Dick was howling with laughter!). Bill got the car w/ the H…\n\n_ _ E / N A _ A T H\n\n_ _ N S / T H E\n\nS _ _ E R / B _ _ _\n\n…and he won it solving “JOE NAMATH WINS THE SUPER BOWL”.\n\nSOLE DUD: Dick\n\nSOLE LaT: Bill\n\nSOLE DQ: Phil’s D repeat\n\nPhil: $2,400/Bill: $11,454 cash & car/Dick: NOTHING\n\nRound 3: SAME NAME\n\nDick instantly BANKRUPTed next to $1,500. Second for Phil were two S’s and N at $250 each, a $900 T, but then H for hush. Bill then said two L’s for $1,800, a single O, a $1,050 R trio, and an E buy, but time’s running out…\n\n_ _ R _ L / _ N / &\n\n_ L _ S T E R / O _\n\n_ _ R _ S\n\n…and the remaining consonant were worth $250 each.\n\nBill: three A’s\n\nDick: three P’s\n\nA P R _ L / _ N / &\n\nP L A S T E R / O _\n\nP A R _ S\n\nDick just missed it after the buzzer w/ APRIL IN & PLASTER ON PARIS. Phil then said F…\n\nA P R _ L / _ N / &\n\nP L A S T E R / O F\n\nP A R _ S\n\n…and solved APRIL IN & PLASTER OF PARIS for $1,900.\n\nSOLE DUD: H (Phil)\n\nINSTA-BANKRUPT: Dick\n\nSOLE DQ: Dick’s one-letter missolve\n\nFINAL SCORES\n\nPhil: $4,300 (left w/ $15,300)/Bill: $11,454 cash & car/Dick: SHUTOUT (left w/ $29,200)\n\nGT: $15,754\n\nNO BANKRUPT TRASH\n\nBonus Round\n\nBill picked the second E.\n\nCategory: PERSON\n\nYou might know her as the former “Material Girl” of the 80’s…\n\n_ _ _ _ N N _\n\nHe’s looking good after calling MCDO…\n\nM _ D O N N _\n\nHe IDed MADONNA and won the $25K for a final 2-day total of $63,924 for both his charities!"
