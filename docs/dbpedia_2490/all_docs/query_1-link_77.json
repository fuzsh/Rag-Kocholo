        "text": "AILA provides a list of press releases issued by ICE since December 2015 announcing deaths in adult immigration detention. Current law requires ICE to publish initial information of an in-custody death within 30 days of the death. While all efforts are made to keep this page up to date, this page may experience some delays (there are also delays by the agency to timely post the press releases or detainee death reports).\n\nThe List of Detainee Deaths in Context\n\nImmigration detention is civil. In other words, it is not supposed to be a punishment. While some individuals enter immigration detention because of an encounter with the criminal justice system, their detention is for civil immigration purposes. Congress authorizes and funds the detention of immigrants, including asylum seekers, to enforce immigration laws.\n\nEvery year, thousands of men, women, and young adults (18 to 21-year-olds) are deprived of their liberty because they lack lawful or permanent immigration status. For annual figures, see ICE Annual Reports. While the number of people who die in custody is small compared to the number of people who are subject to detention, detainee deaths are a regular fixture of immigration detention. For example, beginning in October 2023, there has been a death announced every month except for January (with two people dying in December 2023) during FY2024 (September 2023 to October 2024).\n\nBeyond the Press Releases\n\nMore detailed information related to the circumstances surrounding an individual’s death in government custody, often requires attorneys or reporters to file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Request or pursue litigation against the agency. Over the years, the Detainee Death Reports, Mortality Reviews, and congressional and independent reports have documented several disturbing findings:\n\nThe use of solitary confinement in response to individuals experiencing a mental health crisis and staff failures to perform necessary suicide watch checks;\n\nDelayed or substandard medical care such as failing to receive proper medication or doses;\n\nFacility staff falsifying medical records or failing to properly document patient care; and\n\nSigns of physical abuse and extreme pain experienced while in custody prior to an individual’s death.\n\nDeaths in the ICE Detention System: A Tale of Two Reports\n\nIn 2020, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform issued a lengthy report that found that detainees died in for-profit detention centers after receiving inadequate medical care, among other findings. As a result, DHS’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) was required to review all five of the ICE custody deaths that had occurred in FY2021. In February 2023, OIG released their report finding that in at least one of the five cases, that individual was not provided timely or appropriate care by medical staff. In that case, the individual was so ill that he lost 17 pounds in five weeks in custody while under the monitoring of facility-contracted medical staff. In a second case, the medical staff failed to send an individual to the hospital where life support was available and this potentially contributed to his death. Nevertheless, OIG conclude that no “underlying systemic factors, policies, or processes” played a role in these individuals’ death. DHS reports are filled with incidents of people in custody becoming very ill, some dying, but ICE and DHS concluded that the care provided was adequate. Facilities also consistently pass inspections, despite documented problems by advocates and detained people.\n\nA few months after the OIG report was released, National Public Radio (NPR) published an analysis of over 1600 pages of previously secret inspection reports of the nation’s immigration detention facilities from 2017 to 2019. The publication came after significant efforts by the government to keep these records sealed from public eyes. The investigation’s findings, based on the inspection reports, characterized the conditions in which people in U.S. immigration custody have been held as “barbaric” and “negligent.” For example, retuning a person into the general population with an open wound after a surgical procedure without even a bandage or dressing. In another example, the inspectors documented facility staff giving a pregnant woman only Tylenol in response to vaginal bleeding after a fall in the jail’s shower. In attempting to keep the records from public viewing, the government argued that revealing the inspection records would make it harder for inspectors to provide their “uninhibited opinions and recommendations.”\n\nPreventable Deaths in Immigration Detention\n\nIn June 2024, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), and American Oversight issued a new research report titled, \"Deadly Failures: Preventable Deaths in U.S. Immigration Detention.\" This new report provides a comprehensive examination of the deaths of 52 people who died in ICE custody from 2017-2021. Based on a review of over 14,500 pages of documents and independent medical expert reviews, the report exposes the ways in which DHS failed to conduct rigorous investigations, impose meaningful consequences, or improve conditions that cause immigrants to die in ICE detention. Report analysis also incorporates the review of ICE’s own investigatory reports into deaths in custody by independent medical experts, as well as interviews with two family members of people who died in ICE detention during the studied period. The report concludes with actionable recommendations for DHS, Congress, and state/local governments.\n\nTo learn more about why AILA urges Congress to move away from the harmful use of physical immigration detention for enforcement purposes and to use alternatives to detention, please see our Featured Issue Page: Detention and Alternatives to Detention.\n\nDeaths of Detainees in ICE Custody on the Rise\n\nMedia Coverage\n\nNBC News: The number of deaths in ICE custody is already more than double all of last year - June 1, 2024\n\nSee ICE Announcements on Detainee Deaths by Fiscal Year\n\nFY2024 Announcements\n\nFY2023 Announcements\n\nFY2022 Announcements\n\nFY2021 Announcements\n\nFY2020 Announcements\n\nFY2019 Announcements\n\nFY2015-FY2018 Announcements\n\nFY2024 Announcements\n\nJune 18, 2024\n\nICE announced that Jhon Javier Benavides-Quintana, 32, an Ecuadoran national, died at the Otero County Processing Center in Chaparral, New Mexico on June 15.\n\nICE Press Release: Ecuadoran national passes away ICE custody - June 18, 2024\n\nMay 24, 2024\n\nICE announced that Cambric Dennis, 44, a Liberian citizen, died at the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Georgia on May 21, 2024.\n\nICE Press Release: Liberian national in ICE custody dies in hospital - May 24, 2024\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\nICE announced that Edixon Del Jesus Farias-Farias, 26, Venezuelan national died away at the Conroe Regional Hospital in Conroe, Texas.\n\nICE Press Release: Venezuelan national passes away in ICE custody - April 19, 2024\n\nICE Detainee Death Report\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\nICE announced that Jaspal Singh, 57, a citizen of India, died at Southeast Georgia Health System’s Camden Campus in St. Mary’s.\n\nICE Press Release: Indian national in ICE custody dies in hospital - April 17, 2024\n\nICE Detainee Death Report\n\nMarch 7, 2024\n\nICE announced that Charles Leo Daniel, 61, of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago died on March 7 in his ICE segregation housing unit.\n\nICE Press Release: Trinidad and Tobago national passes away in ICE custody – March 7, 2024\n\nICE Detainee Death Report\n\nFebruary 23, 2024\n\nICE announced that Ousmane Ba, 33, of Senegal died on February 23 at Christus St. Francis Cabrini Hospital (CSFCH), in Alexandria, Louisiana, after being transferred from Winn Correctional Center (WCC), in Winnfield, Louisiana.\n\nICE Press Release: Senegal national passes away in ICE custody – February 23, 2024\n\nICE Detainee Death Report\n\nDecember 6, 2023\n\nICE announced that Frankline Okpu, 37, of Cameroon died on December 6 in ICE custody at Moshannon Valley Processing Center (MVPC), in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nICE Press Release: Cameroon national passes away in ICE custody – December 6, 2023\n\nICE Detainee Death Report\n\nDecember 4, 2023\n\nICE announced that Carlos Juan Francisco, 42, of Guatemala died on December 4 in ICE custody at the Krome Service Processing Center (KSPC).\n\nICE Press Release: Guatemala national passes away in ICE custody – December 4, 2023\n\nNovember 13, 2023\n\nICE announced that Subath Shrestha, 34, of Nepal died on November 13 at the Karnes County ICE Processing Center in Karnes City, Texas.\n\nICE Press Release: Nepal national passes away in ICE custody – November 13, 2023\n\nICE Detainee Death Report\n\nOctober 8, 2023\n\nICE announced that Julio Cesar Chirino Peralta, 32, of Nicaragua died in ICE custody on October 8 at Valley Baptist Medical Center.\n\nICE Press Release: Nicaragua national passes away in ICE custody – October 8, 2023\n\nICE Detainee Death Report\n\nFY2023 Announcements\n\nJune 26, 2023\n\nICE announced that Ernesto Rocha-Cuadra, 42, a Nicaraguan national in ICE custody died on April 4 at the La Salle General Hospital.\n\nICE Press Release: Nicaraguan national passes away in ICE custody – June 26, 2023\n\nApril 4, 2023\n\nICE announced that Salvador Rosales-Vargas, 61, a Mexican national in ICE custody died on April 4 at the Alamance County Detention Center.\n\nICE Detainee Death Report\n\nMarch 6, 2023\n\nICE announced that Cristian Dumitrascu, 50, a Romanian national in ICE custody died on March 5 at the Otay Mesa Detention Center.
