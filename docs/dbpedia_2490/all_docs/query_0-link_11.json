        "text": "American racing driver (born 1950)\n\nDuane Claude Carter Jr.[1] (born June 11, 1950), nicknamed \"Pancho,\" is an American retired open-wheel racing driver. Best known for his participation in Championship car racing, he won the pole position for the 1985 Indianapolis 500, and won the Michigan 500 in 1981.\n\nRacing career\n\n[edit]\n\nMidget cars\n\n[edit]\n\nCarter's national career began while racing in a midget car. He won the 1972 USAC midget car championship. He won the 1972 and 1975 Hut Hundred. He had 23 midget car feature wins by the time he left the series in 1978.[2]\n\nSprint cars\n\n[edit]\n\nCarter won the 1974 and 1976 national USAC sprint car championships. He was the first driver to win the two USAC championships – midgets and sprint cars. He has wins in three USAC divisions – midgets, sprints and Silver Crown (formerly known as dirt cars).\n\nOn May 30, 1977, Carter won two USAC Midget features, one USAC sprint feature and finished second in the second USAC sprint feature at Salem Speedway on a day the temperatures were near 100 degrees. This was one day after he finished 15th in the Indianapolis 500.[2]\n\nCarter ran well on dirt and pavement, but was exceptional on the paved high banks at Winchester and Salem, Indianapolis, and Dayton, Ohio. He won the Joe James/Pat O'Conner Memorial race at the half-mile at Salem, Indiana, on four consecutive occasions.\n\nCarter was seriously injured during a testing crash at Phoenix International Speedway in November 1977. The injuries left him with a permanent disability in one of his legs that hampered his ability to perform well on road courses. He still ran very well on ovals. He made his return to racing at the end of March in 1978, winning a USAC Sprint race at the paved five-eighths mile Indianapolis Raceway Park on Saturday night and at the high-banked half-mile Winchester Speedway the next day – his first races back in the cockpit of a racecar.\n\nCarter was inducted in the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame in 1990,[2] and the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 1991.\n\nIndianapolis cars\n\n[edit]\n\nCarter drove his first Indianapolis 500 in 1974. He finished seventh, and was awarded the Rookie of the Year. In 1981 he finished third in the CART championship and captured his only Indy Car win at Michigan International Speedway. He finished third in the 1982 Indianapolis 500 behind the now-famous duel between Gordon Johncock and Rick Mears. In 1985, Carter drove the brand new Buick V6 engine to the pole position of the 1985 Indianapolis 500. He retired with mechanical problems after completing just six laps, becoming the first pole-sitter since Cliff Woodbury to finish dead-last. His last year as a full-time Indy Car driver was 1990 and his last appearance in an indy car was failing to qualify for the 1994 Indianapolis 500. In more recent years, Carter has served as a spotter for Sam Hornish Jr., Vítor Meira, Dillon Battistini, Dan Wheldon, Martin Plowman and Adrián Campos Jr. In 2019, he was the spotter for rookie Santino Ferrucci, who finished seventh, as the Rookie of the Year, at the Indianapolis 500. This was the same as Carter in his 500 debut.\n\nNASCAR\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom 1985–1995 Carter ran 14 NASCAR Winston Cup Series races for multiple owners. His first start was at Darlington Raceway in 1985, which was the Southern 500. The race was best known for Bill Elliott locking up the Winston Million, Carter finished in 22nd. Carter began the 1986 season driving for Elmo Langley; at the 1986 Daytona 500, he and Kyle Petty were involved in a turn one accident, thus winding up in 34th place. After three races with Langley's team, he moved to driving for Roger Hamby,[3] competing in six more races that year; he posted his best career NASCAR finish with Hamby, a seventeenth-place finish at the Michigan International Speedway. In 1990, he competed at Atlanta Motor Speedway, driving for Paul Romine;[4] he drove for Donlavey Racing at Charlotte Motor Speedway in 1992,[5] and his final two races in Winston Cup competition came for Triad Motorsports at Atlanta Motor Speedway in 1994, where he tied his career-best finish, and Pocono Raceway in 1995.[6]\n\nIn 1995, Pancho also raced two Craftsman Truck Series races,[7] driving for Enerjetix Motorsports.[8]\n\nPost-racing career\n\n[edit]\n\nCarter currently acts as a spotter for Dale Coyne Racing.[9]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHe is the son of Indycar racer Duane Carter. He was born while his parents were on the way to a race at the Milwaukee Mile.[9] His father's nickname was \"Pappy\". Pappy referred to his wife's pregnancy as \"little paunch,\" so they nicknamed the child Pancho.[2] Carter is the half-brother of Johnny Parsons. His full brother, Dana Carter, also raced in USAC midgets, sprints and Silver Crown. He died of a heart attack in the early 1980s.[10]\n\nCarter is a graduate of California State University, Long Beach.[3] He is married, to Carla; they have two children, and their son Cole is an aspiring racer.[9]\n\nMotorsports career results\n\n[edit]\n\nAmerican open-wheel racing\n\n[edit]\n\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position)\n\nUSAC Champ Car/Gold Crown Series\n\n[edit]\n\nUSAC Champ Car/Gold Crown results Year Team 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Rank Points 1974 Fletcher Racing ONT ONT ONT PHX TRE INDY\n\n7 MIL POC\n\n15 MCH\n\n9 MIL\n\n12 MCH\n\n2 TRE\n\n9 TRE\n\n6 PHX\n\n9 12th 1040 1975 Fletcher Racing ONT\n\n2 ONT ONT\n\n19 PHX\n\n8 TRE INDY\n\n4 MIL\n\n6 POC\n\n24 MCH\n\n4 MIL\n\n14 MCH\n\n8 TRE\n\nDNS PHX\n\n8 9th 1345 1976 All American Racers PHX\n\n2 TRE\n\n7 INDY\n\n5 MIL\n\n18 POC\n\n14 MCH TWS TRE MIL ONT\n\n29 MCH\n\nDNS TWS\n\n10 PHX 12th 920 1977 All American Racers ONT\n\n3 PHX\n\n20 TWS\n\n11 TRE\n\n9 INDY\n\n15 MIL\n\n5 POC\n\n20 MOS MCH\n\n10 TWS\n\n3 MIL\n\n2 ONT\n\n14 MCH 8th 1420 Alex Morales Motorsports PHX\n\n3 1978 Fletcher Racing PHX ONT TWS TRE INDY\n\n24 MOS\n\n15 MIL\n\n21 POC\n\n10 MCH\n\nDNS ATL\n\n11 TWS\n\n11 MIL ONT\n\n2 MCH\n\n18 TRE\n\n7 SIL BRH PHX\n\n9 10th 1206 1979 Alex Morales Motorsports ONT TWS INDY\n\n20 MIL POC TWS MIL NC 0 1980 Alex Morales Motorsports ONT\n\n18 INDY\n\n6 MIL\n\n4 POC\n\n6 MDO\n\n7 5th 1078 1981-82 Alex Morales Motorsports INDY\n\n28 POC ILL DUQ ISF INDY\n\n3 NC 0\n\nPPG Indycar Series\n\n[edit]\n\nCART IndyCar World Series results Year Team 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Rank Points Ref 1979 Alex Morales Motorsports PHX\n\n20 ATL\n\n9 ATL\n\n11 INDY\n\n20 TRE\n\n10 TRE\n\n8 MCH\n\n7 MCH\n\n14 WGL\n\n16 TRE\n\nDNS ONT\n\n28 MCH\n\n8 ATL\n\n13 PHX\n\n7 13th 452 [11] 1980 Alex Morales Motorsports ONT\n\n18 INDY\n\n6 MIL\n\n4 POC\n\n6 MDO\n\n7 MCH\n\n3 WGL\n\n7 MIL\n\n22 ONT\n\n7 MCH\n\n7 MEX\n\n22 PHX\n\n19 5th 1855 [12] 1981 Alex Morales Motorsports PHX\n\n7 MIL\n\n20 ATL\n\n5 ATL\n\n5 MCH\n\n1 RIV\n\n10 MIL\n\n10 MCH\n\n18 WGL\n\n15 MEX\n\n6 PHX\n\n5 3rd 166 [13] 1982 Alex Morales Motorsports PHX\n\n6 ATL\n\n10 MIL\n\n13 CLE\n\n19 MCH\n\n18 MIL\n\n6 POC\n\n28 RIV\n\n19 ROA\n\n11 MCH\n\n12 PHX\n\n11 17th 47 [14] 1983 Alex Morales Motorsports ATL\n\n16 INDY\n\n7 MIL\n\n14 CLE\n\n8 MCH\n\n6 ROA\n\n7 POC\n\n6 RIV\n\n7 MDO\n\n10 MCH\n\n15 CPL\n\n6 LAG\n\n25 PHX\n\n10 10th 53 [15] 1984 Galles Racing LBH PHX INDY\n\n19 MIL POR MEA CLE MCH\n\n6 ROA POC\n\n7 MDO SAN MCH PHX\n\n7 LAG CPL\n\n11 21st 22 [16] 1985 Galles Racing LBH\n\n13 INDY\n\n33 MIL\n\n5 POR\n\n13 MEA CLE\n\n16 MCH\n\n16 ROA POC\n\n12 MDO SAN\n\n2 MCH\n\n10 LAG PHX\n\n7 MIA 18th 33 [17] 1986 Galles Racing PHX LBH INDY\n\n16 MIL POR MEA CLE TOR MCH\n\n3 POC\n\n3 MDO SAN\n\n15 MCH ROA LAG PHX MIA 19th 28 [18] 1987 Machinists Union Racing LBH PHX INDY\n\n27 MIL POR MEA CLE TOR MCH\n\n20 POC\n\n6 ROA\n\n14 MDO\n\n14 NAZ\n\n17 LAG\n\n12 MIA\n\n14 25th 9 [19] 1988 Machinists Union Racing PHX LBH INDY\n\nDNQ MIL POR CLE TOR MEA MCH POC MDO ROA NAZ LAG MIA NC - [20] 1989 Leader Card Racing PHX\n\n7 LBH\n\n17 INDY\n\n22 MIL\n\n9 DET\n\n10 POR\n\n9 CLE\n\n14 MEA\n\n13 TOR\n\n27 MCH\n\n26 POC\n\n12 MDO\n\n28 ROA\n\n19 NAZ\n\n18 LAG\n\n24 13th 18 [21] 1990 Leader Card Racing PHX\n\n8 LBH INDY\n\n29 MIL\n\n15 DET\n\n9 POR\n\n15 CLE\n\n14 MEA\n\n18 TOR\n\n18 MCH\n\n18 DEN VAN MDO ROA NAZ LAG 20th 9 [22] 1991 Arciero Racing SRF LBH PHX INDY\n\n21 MIL\n\n14 DET POR CLE MEA TOR 26th 3 [23] Leader Card Racing MCH\n\n10 DEN VAN MDO ROA NAZ LAG 1992 Hemelgarn Racing SRF PHX LBH INDY\n\nDNQ DET POR MIL 31st 2 [24] Gilmore Racing NHA\n\n11 TOR MCH\n\n17 CLE ROA VAN MDO NAZ LAG 1994 McCormack Motorsports SRF PHX LBH INDY\n\nDNQ MIL DET POR CLE TOR MCH MDO NHA VAN ROA NAZ LAG NC - [25]\n\nIndianapolis 500\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Chassis Engine Start Finish 1974 Eagle Offy 21st 7th 1975 Eagle Offy 18th 4th 1976 Eagle Offy 6th 5th 1977 Eagle Offy 8th 15th 1978 Lighning Cosworth 21st 24th 1979 Lighning Cosworth 17th 20th 1980 Penske Cosworth 8th 6th 1981 Penske Cosworth 10th 28th 1982 March Cosworth 10th 3rd 1983 March Cosworth 14th 7th 1984 March Cosworth 21st 19th 1985 March Buick 1st 33rd 1986 Lola Cosworth 14th 16th 1987 March Cosworth 29th 27th 1988 March Buick Qualifying Crash 1989 Lola Cosworth 32nd 22nd 1990 Lola Cosworth 22nd 29th 1991 Lola Buick 32nd 21st 1992 Lola Buick Failed to Qualify 1994 Lola Chevrolet Failed to Qualify\n\nNASCAR\n\n[edit]\n\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time.
