        "text": "Country singer, songwriter & guitarist Edward Thomas Rabbitt was born on a holiday, of Thanksgiving, on Thursday, November 27th, 1941, {the fourth Thursday,of November}, to Irish immigrant parents in Brooklyn, New York. Rabbitt was raised in East Orange, New Jersey. Eddie recorded songs for the labels 20th Century Records and Columbia Records in the 1960 decade. In 1968, Eddie Rabbitt moved to Nashville, Tennessee and initially established himself in the country music scene as a songwriter (he wrote Elvis Presley's \"Kentucky Rain\" and Ronnie Milsap's \"Pure Love\"). In 1974, he began recording songs & started his very own musical career, with the recording label/name, Elektra Records. Eddie scored his first Top 40 country radio hit list, with \"You Get to Me\" (later in the year). In 1976, Rabbitt had his first number 1 country hit, with \"Drinkin' My Baby (Off My Mind).\" Eddie went on to enjoy a steady succession of 26 number 1 country hits from 1976 to 1989, (averaging two a year, approximately). His most popular & successful songs include such terrific tunes as \"You Don't Love Me Anymore,\" \"Every Which Way But Loose,\" \"Drivin' My Life Away,\" \"I Love a Rainy Night,\" \"Step by Step,\" \"You and I\" (a lovely duet, he teamed with Crystal Gayle, to successfully perform). \"The Best Year of My Life,\" \"I Wanna Dance With You,\" & \"On Second Thought.\" Moreover, a majority of these songs were substantial crossover hits on the Billboard pop radio charts. Although his career weakened in the later 1980 decade, Rabbitt nonetheless still continued to record albums and perform musical concerts, in nightclubs throughout that era. Following the tragic & untimely death of his infant son (& first offspring) was approximately one month from being two years (23 months), Timmy in 1985. When Timmy was born, he became a father. Following the death his first son, Timmy, Eddie became very active in raising money for organizations that aid ill children, of all ages: He not only served as honorary chairman of the American Council on Transplantation, but also was a celebrity spokesman for both the Muscular Dystrophy Association, (much like as if he was following the footsteps of Jerry Lewis's marathons) & United Cerebral Palsy Organization. Eddie Rabbitt died from lung cancer, just under 56 & a half, on Thursday, May 7th, 1998, in Nashville, Tennessee. (following his birth on holiday, Thanksgiving Thursday, November 27th, 1941), (he was ten days young, when Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, was attacked on Sunday, December 7th, 1941, by Japanese bombardiers, forcing the United States of America, to enter World War II)! Eddie Rabbitt's life-time: Thursday, November 27th, 1941, to Thursday, May 7th, 1998, was 20,615 days, equaling 2,945 weeks, exactly.\n\nShe was born Adelaide Delgado on August 28, 1923 (some references list 1925) to Spanish-speaking parents. The future Adela Mara began dances lesson at age 6 and was discovered as a young teenager by the legendary Xavier Cugat. Singing and dancing with his in the Detroit area, Cugat took the beautiful, brown-eyed brunette to New York where she performed in his shows at such esteemed clubs as the Copacabana.\n\nWhile touring as a singer/dancer, she was spotted in Florida by a Columbia talent scout and signed to a Hollywood contract in 1942 at age 19. Starting off in bit exotic roles in such films as Honolulu Lu (1941), she quickly grew to alluring co-starring status opposite top banana Glynis Ahearn in Shut My Big Mouth (1942). There continued playing brisk leading ladies in a series of standard, uneventful \"B\" films including Vengeance of the West (1942) with Tex Ritter and Alias Boston Blackie (1942) starring Chester Morris.\n\nA couple of years later she was transformed into a sexy platinum blonde pin-up after signing with Republic Studios and kept herself quite busy predominantly cast as senorita-types opposite cowboy stars Roy Rogers in Bells of Rosarita (1945) and Gene Autry in Twilight on the Rio Grande (1947). She was also fetching fodder in crime dramas including Blackmail (1947) and Web of Danger (1947) and a pleasant diversion in adventure pictures such as Im Banne der roten Hexe (1948) with John Wayne and Das Schwert der Rache (1950).\n\nArguably Adele's best parts would come with Angel in Exile (1948) and Du warst unser Kamerad (1949), the latter again starring Duke Wayne. Seldom was she given the chance to capitalize on her acting talents, however, and her film career waned in the mid 1950s. Her last screen appearance would be in Die Welt der Sensationen (1959) with Victor Mature. Adele subsequently moved into TV and was featured in a number of guest spots, primarily in westerns. She eventually abandoned her career and settled down to raise her three sons from her 1952 marriage to TV mogul Roy Huggins who produced many hit shows including 77-Sunset-Strip (1958) and Maverick (1957). On a rare occasion, she would appear as a guest in one of his efforts, including an episode of the TV series Cool Million (1972).\n\nHuggins died in 2002 and Adele passed away eight years later of natural causes in Los Angeles on May 7, 2010. The 87-year-old actress was interred at San Fernando Mission Cemetery.\n\nBefore there was an Alan Ladd, there was another furtive-eyed, baby-faced, cigarette-dangling Alan, impacting the movie scene with his various colorless and cold-hearted thugs, mobsters and killers. Dark-haired, bullet-headed actor Alan Baxter earned a noticeable degree of popularity back in the late 1930s and 1940s with his various despicable characters, before his film career lost steam and he sought more and more TV and stage work.\n\nThe son of a Cleveland Trust Company vice president, Baxter was born on November 19, 1908, in East Cleveland. Following high school, he studied drama at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where he forged a strong friendship with fellow collegiate and future directing icon, Elia Kazan. Once they graduated in 1930, the duo attended Yale's School of Drama.\n\nBaxter hooked up with the then-fledgling Group Theatre in the early 1930s and appeared in such stage productions as \"Lone Valley\", \"The Pure in Heart\" and \"Waiting for Lefty\". His performance in \"Black Pit\" in 1935, however, was witnessed by a Hollywood talent scout and it was enough to change the course of his career. Immediately heading west to Hollywood, Baxter made an auspicious debut with his strong performance as \"Babe Wilson\", the unfeeling killer loved by Sylvia Sidney's character in Mary Burns, Fugitive (1935). Three years later, Baxter went on to recreate the role on radio.\n\nWith his foot strongly in the Paramount door, he continued playing dangerous, unsavory types in Thirteen Hours by Air (1936), Große braune Augen (1936) and Mordprozess Harms (1936), until his contract ran out. Continuing to freelance throughout the remainder of the 1930s, he remained on the wrong side of the law in Parole! (1936), Breezing Home (1937), Night Key (1937), Wide Open Faces (1938), Off the Record (1939), My Son Is a Criminal (1939), and Todesangst bei jeder Dämmerung (1939).\n\nA solid \"B\" lead player who appeared in support when it came to \"A\" pictures, Baxter occasionally broke out of the \"bad guy\" mold -- but not often. By this time, Alan Ladd was starting to cut in on Baxter's action with his moody and sexy versions of trench-coat-trendy villains. Baxter, nevertheless, continued to roll on, playing outlaw \"Jesse James\" in Die Rächer von Missouri (1941) opposite Dennis Morgan, Wayne Morris, and Arthur Kennedy as the Younger brothers, while adding slick malevolence to such films as Escape to Glory (1940) (with Constance Bennett), Under Age (1941) (with Nan Grey and Mary Anderson), The Pittsburgh Kid (1941) (with Jean Parker), and Rags to Riches (1941) (with Mary Carlisle). This period of filming was topped by an excellent support role in the classic Alfred Hitchcock thriller, Saboteure (1942), in which he, as the meek-voiced, mustachioed, bespectacled, peroxide blond Nazi spy \"Freeman\", shares a memorable scene with lead Robert Cummings.\n\nFollowing standard work in China Girl (1942) and Behind Prison Walls (1943), Baxter (at age 35) signed up for the Army Air Force in 1943, and appeared in the Broadway production of Moss Hart's \"Winged Victory\", which later was turned into the 1944 movie version of the same name, Winged Victory (1944) (also featuring Baxter). Post-war filming grew more dismal with a high majority of \"Poverty Row\" pictures coming Baxter's way. His last appearance in a strong film was the Robert Ryan boxing pic, Ring frei für Stoker Thompson (1949), as a mobster involved in fixing matches. Alan decided to return to the challenge of the stage, appearing in such plays as \"Home of the Brave\" (1945), \"The Voice of the Turtle\" (1947), \"The Hallams\" (1948), \"Jenny Kissed Me\" (1948), \"Tea and Sympathy\" (1955), and \"South Pacific\" (1957) (in a non-singing role). TV also became a positive medium, with adventure guest roles on Westlich von Santa Fe (1958), Wagon Train (1957), Colt .45 (1957) and Alfred Hitchcock präsentiert (1955), among the offerings.\n\nBy the 1960s, Baxter was seen primarily in incidental film roles, his last being the cult rodent thriller, Willard (1971). Diagnosed with cancer, the twice-married actor died a few years later at the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, on May 8, 1976, aged 67.\n\nBruce MacVittie was born in Providence, RI in 1956. He began acting in high school, attended Boston University, studied with Jerzy Grotowski in 1976 and moved to New York City to pursue a career in acting in 1979. He began his career at the Ensemble Studio Theatre in 1980 in Edward Allen Baker's \"Prairie Avenue\", where he worked for many years as a member. He was a founding member of Naked Angels Theater Company. Bruce spent over ten years at the Eugene O'Neill National Playwrights' Conference under Lloyd Richards, 10 seasons at the Williamstown Theatre Festival under Michael Ritchie and Jenny Gersten, and was a member of the Blue Light Theatre Company where he began a collaboration with Joanne Woodward for several years on the plays of Clifford Odets. In 1982, he began as understudy to James Hayden in David Mamet's American Buffalo with Al Pacino and J.J. Johnston at Circle In the Square, eventually replacing Hayden in the subsequent Broadway production, national tour, and West End Productions with Pacino and Johnston. MacVittie, a character actor, had a long tenure playing guest-starring roles in television and film beginning with Barney Miller (1975) in 1981 working on both coasts, but predominantly in New York. In New York, he worked in most off-Broadway theaters including the Public, Playwright's Horizons, Manhattan Theatre Club, Signature Theatre, and the Cherry Lane. He appeared in over 75 film and television productions over 32 years.\n\nDawn Addams was born in Felixstowe, East Suffolk, England, the daughter of Captain James Ramage Addams, an R.A.F. officer. Much of her childhood was spent in Calcutta, India, where her father was stationed, and she later attended schools in England and California. Though Dawn took her first screen test at the age of thirteen, she did not start acting until after her graduation from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Her career commenced on the repertory stage, with tours of both Britain and continental Europe. Signed to a contract by MGM in 1950, Dawn appeared in her first feature film, Night Into Morning (1951). She acted in several other well-received A-grade productions, including Schiff ohne Heimat (1952), Die Thronfolgerin (1953) and Das Gewand (1953). For Otto Preminger's vaguely controversial Wolken sind überall (1953), Dawn's services were rented out by MGM to United Artists. In January 1953, she joined other MGM contract stars on a USO tour of Korea. In Charles Chaplin's Ein König in New York (1957) she had another starring opportunity as an advertising woman who gets involved with royalty. That seemed to mirror her personal life, since Dawn became an actress-princess (prior to Grace Kelly getting that gig) by marrying the Italian nobleman Don Vittorio Massimo in 1954. The marriage ended after just four years in separation and was finally dissolved in 1971.\n\nBy the early 1960s, offers of glamorous roles had diminished, and Dawn was down to playing hapless heroines in European co-productions, second string horrors like Schlag 12 in London (1960) (as Jekyll's wife Kitty who ends up being raped and driven to suicide by his evil alter-ego, Mr. Hyde) and potboilers like Fritz Lang's final directorial effort Die 1000 Augen des Dr. Mabuse (1960). She spent the remainder of her career alternating between stage and television work in England, eventually remarrying and settling down in Malta. In April 1985, Dawn was treated for cancer in Florida but died soon after at a London hospital at the age of 54."
