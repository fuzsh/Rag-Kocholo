        "text": "Duane Croom\n\nOn Tuesday morning, January 13, 2015, with wife Sharon at his side, Duane Croom, age 53, passed away peacefully at their Prior Lake home. A love for life, Duane truly loved his family, friends, sports and music.\n\nThe family will greet guests on Sunday, January 18, from 4-7 pm at Ballard-Sunder Funeral and Cremation 4565 Pleasant Street SE, Prior Lake, and also one hour prior to the service at church. A Celebration of Life Service will be on Monday, January 19 at 11 am, at Friendship Church 12800 Marystown Road, Shakopee. The Reverend Mike Golay will preside. Pall bearers will be Cory Croom, Connor Croom, Ken Hennes, Don Westphal, Steve Swift, Mike Simon, and Brad Rixmann. Duane will be laid to rest at Spring Lake Cemetery, Prior Lake, MN.\n\nOn January 11, 1962, in Downey, CA, Duane was born to parents Lloyd and Sonya Duane (Dill) Croom. Most proud of being the big brother to Lonnie and Kevin, they were always together and had great times. A die-hard LA Dodgers baseball fan, the three boys would spend summers attending the home games for 75 cents and listening to the away games with Vince Scully on the radio at the beach. Duane also had a great circle of neighborhood friends, especially Joe Bologna and Jerry Rollins, assuring there was always a game of organized sports being played. A family dedicated to their faith, Duane was very involved in church life throughout the week. A deep love for sports, Duane was a star running back and an exceptional baseball player for Downey High School, where he graduated in 1980.\n\nFor 30 years, Duane worked for Anchor Glass, as a mould maker. He started his career in Los Angeles, CA and when the plant closed down in 1990, Duane moved to the Shakopee, MN plant. He took great pride in his work and treasured the friendships established over the years.\n\nDuane married and became the proud father to Cory and Taylor. They were the light of his life. Unfortunately, the marriage dissolved. In 1993, through mutual church friends, he met Sharon Jones. Duane instantly knew she was the one for him, when Sharon knew what the term ‘balk” meant while watching baseball together. On a 92 degree day of July 29, 1995 at Friendship Church in Prior Lake, MN, they exchanged wedding vows. Duane and Sharon were then blessed with a son Connor.\n\nFamily was most important to Duane. He was so proud of the man Cory became, especially now being a dad to Carter, his first grandchild. Taylor will always be his little girl and enjoyed calling her ‘Frufina’. Connor was his baby –given the nickname Connor Bonnor–and passed on his love of sports to him. He also coached Connor’s baseball teams for many years—always encouraging him to ‘lay off the high ones’ while he was at bat. Duane, Sharon and Connor enjoyed attending Twins, St. Paul Saints and MN Gopher games. Duane prided himself as being a good cook. His family truly relishing Duane’s Christmas prime rib and it wasn’t a complete holiday without a piece of his pecan pie. Duane so enjoyed cooking for crowds and being around family.\n\nThe life of any party, Duane could command a room, yet had an extremely soft and patient side. Non-judgmental, Duane was Duane…a one of a kind man. He loved rock and roll music! Duane could sing every word to every song, even if he could not hold a tune. He enjoyed long conversations with family and friends talking about sports and music. On December 14, 2014, Duane was diagnosed with liver cancer. For the next 30 days, he fought a hard and courageous battle.\n\nLeft to honor Duane’s life and mourn the death is his wife of almost 20 years, Sharon; children, Cory Croom, Taylor Croom, Connor Croom; grandson, Carter; mother, Sonya (Thomas) Morton; father Lloyd (Co) Croom; brothers, Lonnie (Michelle) Croom, Kevin (Ann) Croom; many nieces and nephews, other loving relatives and friends. Welcoming Duane in heaven are his grandparents."
