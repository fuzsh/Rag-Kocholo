Rates of new cases are also referred to as incidence rates.\n\nRate of New Cases and Deaths per 100,000: The rate of new cases of prostate cancer was 116.5 per 100,000 men per year. The death rate was 19.0 per 100,000 men per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2017–2021 cases and 2018–2022 deaths.\n\nLifetime Risk of Developing Cancer: Approximately 12.8 percent of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point during their lifetime, based on 2018–2021 data, excluding 2020 due to COVID.\n\nPrevalence of This Cancer: In 2021, there were an estimated 3,399,229 men living with prostate cancer in the United States.\n\nDid You Know?

It excludes the risk of dying from other causes. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.\n\n5-Year\n\nRelative Survival\n\n97.5%\n\nSurvival by Stage\n\nCancer stage at diagnosis, which refers to extent of a cancer in the body, determines treatment options and has a strong influence on the length of survival. In general, if the cancer is found only in the part of the body where it started it is localized (sometimes referred to as stage 1). If it has spread to a different part of the body, the stage is regional or distant. For prostate cancer, 69.4% are diagnosed at the local stage. The 5-year relative survival for localized prostate cancer is 100.0%.\n\nPercent of Cases & 5-Year Relative Survival by Stage at Diagnosis: Prostate Cancer\n\nStage Percent of Cases 5-Year Relative Survival Localized\n\nConfined to Primary Site 69% 100.0% Regional\n\nSpread to Regional Lymph Nodes 13% 100.0% Distant\n\nCancer Has Metastasized 8% 36.6% Unknown\n\nUnstaged 9% 92.3%\n\nPercent of Cases by Stage\n\nLocalized (69%)\n\nConfined to Primary Site\n\nRegional (13%)\n\nSpread to Regional Lymph Nodes\n\nDistant (8%)\n\nCancer Has Metastasized\n\nUnknown (9%)\n\nUnstaged\n\n5-Year Relative Survival\n\nNew Cases and Deaths\n\nHow Common Is This Cancer?\n\nCompared to other cancers, prostate cancer is fairly common.\n\nRank Common Types of Cancer Estimated New\n\nCases 2024 Estimated\n\nDeaths 2024 1.

Pancreatic Cancer 66,440 51,750\n\nProstate cancer represents 14.9% of all new cancer cases in the U.S.\n\n14.9%\n\nIn 2024, it is estimated that there will be 299,010 new cases of prostate cancer and an estimated 35,250 people will die of this disease.\n\nWho Gets This Cancer?\n\nProstate cancer occurs only in men, and it is more common in older men than younger men. It is more likely to occur in men with a family history of prostate cancer and men of African American descent. The rate of new cases of prostate cancer was 116.5 per 100,000 men per year based on 2017–2021 cases, age-adjusted.\n\nRate of New Cases per 100,000 Persons by Race/Ethnicity: Prostate Cancer\n\nMales\n\nAll Races 116.5 Hispanic 88.1 Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native 76.7 Non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander 61.4 Non-Hispanic Black 188.7 Non-Hispanic White 114.9\n\nFemales\n\nAll Races Sex-specific cancer type Hispanic Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native Non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander Non-Hispanic Black Non-Hispanic White\n\nAll Races\n\nHispanic\n\nNon-Hispanic American Indian/\n\nAlaska Native\n\nNon-Hispanic Asian /\n\nPacific Islander\n\nNon-Hispanic Black\n\nNon-Hispanic White\n\nPercent of New Cases by Age Group: Prostate Cancer\n\nAge Range Percent of New Cases <20 0.0% 20–34 0.0% 35–44 0.3% 45–54 6.4% 55–64 30.3% 65–74 42.4% 75–84 16.8% >84 3.8%\n\nProstate cancer is most frequently diagnosed among men aged 65–74.\n\nMedian Age\n\nAt Diagnosis\n\n67\n\nWho Dies From This Cancer?\n\nBecause we have screening for prostate cancer, most of the time it is caught before it spreads to other parts of the body. Men who have prostate cancer that is characterized as localized or regional are not as likely to die as men whose cancer is distant. In general prostate cancer has excellent survival rates, but death rates are higher in African American men, men who have advanced stage cancer, and men who are between the ages of 75 and 84. Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The death rate was 19.0 per 100,000 men per year based on 2018–2022, age-adjusted.\n\nDeath Rate per 100,000 Persons by Race/Ethnicity: Prostate Cancer\n\nMales\n\nAll Races 19.0 Hispanic 15.4 Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native 19.4 Non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander 8.8 Non-Hispanic Black 37.2 Non-Hispanic White 18.1\n\nFemales\n\nAll Races Sex-specific cancer type Hispanic Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native Non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander Non-Hispanic Black Non-Hispanic White\n\nAll Races\n\nHispanic\n\nNon-Hispanic American Indian/\n\nAlaska Native\n\nNon-Hispanic Asian /\n\nPacific Islander\n\nNon-Hispanic Black\n\nNon-Hispanic White\n\nPercent of Deaths by Age Group: Prostate Cancer\n\nAge Range Percent of Deaths <20 0.0% 20–34 0.0% 35–44 0.1% 45–54 1.1% 55–64 8.9% 65–74 24.5% 75–84 33.7% >84 31.7%\n\nThe percent of prostate cancer deaths is highest among men aged 75–84.\n\nMedian Age\n\nAt Death\n\n79\n\nTrends in Rates\n\nChanges Over Time\n\nKeeping track of new cases, deaths, and survival over time (trends) can help scientists understand whether progress is being made and where additional research is needed to address challenges, such as improving screening or finding better treatments.\n\nUsing statistical models for analysis, age-adjusted rates for new prostate cancer cases have been rising on average 0.9% each year over 2012–2021. Age-adjusted death rates have been falling on average 0.5% each year over 2013–2022. 5-year relative survival trends are shown below.\n\nNew Cases, Deaths and 5-Year Relative Survival\n\nInteractive Statistics with SEER*Explorer\n\nWith SEER*Explorer, you can...\n\nCreate custom graphs and tables\n\nDownload data and images\n\nShare links to results\n\nSEER*Explorer is an interactive website that provides easy access to a wide range of SEER cancer statistics.

An inset provides a close-up view of the prostate, urethra, bladder, seminal vesicles, and rectum.\n\nThis cancer forms in tissues of the prostate (a gland in the male reproductive system found below the bladder and in front of the rectum). The prostate surrounds the urethra, the tube through which urine flows. A healthy prostate is about the size of a walnut. If the prostate grows too large, it squeezes the urethra. This may slow or stop the normal flow of urine. Prostate cancer usually occurs in older men.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nLearn more about prostate cancer\n\nMore Information\n\nHere are some resources for learning more about prostate cancer.\n\nAbout risk factors for prostate cancer\n\nAbout symptoms and diagnosis of prostate cancer\n\nAbout treatment options for prostate cancer\n\nAbout clinical trials\n\nAbout preventing prostate cancer\n\nAbout the health risks of smoking and ways to quit\n\nReferences\n\nAll statistics in this report are based on statistics from SEER and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.
