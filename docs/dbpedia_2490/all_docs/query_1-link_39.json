        "text": "Music & Memories\n\nBroadcast for Sunday May 5, 2024\n\nCovering the deaths from May 5-11, 2024\n\nGood morning and welcome to Music & Memories.\n\nThis is Linda Sue, and I am the grief specialist at Patton-Schad Funeral Home. It is my pleasure to bring you this week’s program on KASM. This program is our way of reaching out to help families deal with those difficult days surrounding the death anniversary of a loved one.\n\nAs April showers bring May flowers, nature once again reminds us of Hope in the days ahead. Our grief is no different, looking ahead to better days. As we move forward on our journey it's important to remember we are not leaving your loved one behind. They are right there with us in our heart all the way. It is up to us to keep their memory and legacy alive by the telling of the stories and sharing those precious memories. The much-needed rain is cleansing the earth as tears cleanse our spirit and soul, love tears. The flowing of tears is a reminder of our love and is very healthy to our soul! Don't be ashamed of the tears but rather welcome and celebrate them!!\n\nThis program is dedicated to the memory of:\n\nJulius “Joe” Wegleitner who died May 5, 2023\n\nJune (Duclos) Domine who died May 5, 2023\n\nRose Renneker who died May 5, 2002\n\nAlbert Yarke Sr. who died May 5, 1990\n\nAnna Slivnik who died May 5, 1989\n\nCasper Schwieters who died May 5, 1968\n\nLucille Harms who died May 6, 2022\n\nAnna Locnikar who died May 6, 1969\n\nJohn Wolbeck who died May 7, 1993\n\nWilfred “Willy” Ring who died May 7, 1987\n\nJuletta Kunstleben-Wolbeck who died May 8, 2001\n\nLeona May who died May 8, 2018\n\nMargaret Hellmann who died May 8, 2013\n\nDavid Winter who died May 8, 2011\n\nWilfred Roering who died May 8, 1985\n\nGeorgina “Jean” Eichers who died May 9, 2010\n\nWilliam “Bill” Vouk, Sr. who died May 9, 2003\n\nFrances Rothstein who died May 9, 2000\n\nElizabeth Meyer who died May 9, 1992\n\nAl Kerfeld who died May 9, 1976\n\nTony Cherne Jr. who died May 10, 2023\n\nMarcella Tabatt who died May 10, 2022\n\nRichard “Tubby” Herges who died May 10, 2022\n\nEvelyn Luethmers who died May 10, 2015\n\nPat Feldhege who died May 10, 2010\n\nFrancis M.
