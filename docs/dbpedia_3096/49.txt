DUMONT

STUFFED into a cramped studio on the second floor of a cinder-block building here, a tiny FM radio station short on power but long on enthusiasm is changing the way tens of thousands of residents in northern New Jersey tune their radios.

The station, WJUX-FM, 103.1, has just celebrated its first anniversary as "Bergen County's Hometown Radio Station." In one year it has attracted 40,000 listeners a week and a cadre of loyal sponsors by broadcasting local news, traffic reports and ballads and big-band hits from the 1930's, 40's and 50's.

In fact, Jukebox Radio, as it calls itself, has been such a hit with residents of the area that the station's owner recently requested Federal Communications Commission permission to increase the station's broadcasting power. That application has the support of state, county and local officials, as well as the backing of some Federal legislators.

"Everybody realizes that it's about time Bergen County had its own radio station," said the owner, Gerry Turro, a determined 39-year-old Oradell resident whose lifelong dream has been to bring FM radio back to its birthplace in the county.

Achieving that goal has taken Mr. Turro on an odyssey that ranged from a two-day stint in a Dumpster in New York City to an eight-year battle with Washington bureaucrats trying to persuade the F.C.C. that Bergen County needed a radio station it could call its own. Before Jukebox Radio, Bergen was the largest county in the country without a 24-hour FM radio station.

After years of rejection, Mr. Turro stumbled upon a backdoor into radioland. And now, one year later, Jukebox Radio is being beamed into homes and automobiles from Franklin Lakes to Fort Lee and beyond.
