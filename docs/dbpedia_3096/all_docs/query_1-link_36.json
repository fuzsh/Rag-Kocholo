RN1AL lives in St. Petersburg, where he teaches English. Tony says that it is not common practice in Russia to use any form of phonetics when speaking Russian, as Cyrillic spelling and pronunciation are alike, whereas English has some peculiar spellings and homophones. However, the following phonetic alphabet is sometimes employed when using the English alphabet. The first column shows the English letter. The second and fourth columns show the Cyrillic word, the fourth being the diminutive form. The third and fifth columns give the phonetic English pronunciation. Apparently, it is not uncommon for the normal and diminutive forms to be mixed randomly and it is important to get the stress right.

If there is chirp on the signal, the letter \"c\" should be appended and if there are key- clicks, the letter \"k\" should be appended.

A sensitivity measurement normally associated with FM receivers SINPO the system of reporting signals from broadcast and other stations where an accurate and repeatable subjective assessment of reception conditions is required. The SINPO code is defined in CCIR Recommendation 251, but the \"RST equivalents\" are not part of that recommendation, being specific to the \"5MHz Experiment\". Although the normal Amateur Radio convention of reporting only readability and signal strength is sometimes considered to be inadequate, the SINPO code is not normally used by Radio Amateurs. Its use is, however, obligatory for those stations participating in the eight year \"5MHz Experiment\", which began in August 2002, during which propagation studies are to be carried out in conjunction with other UK amateur, military and military cadet stations. UK Amateur Radio operators who have been granted the necessary NoV, are permitted to operate on five spot frequencies in the 5MHz band during this experiment. The RST values normally used by Radio Amateurs are shown in brackets below and are the recommended equivalents to be used when determining SINPO reports of signals on the 5MHz Band.
