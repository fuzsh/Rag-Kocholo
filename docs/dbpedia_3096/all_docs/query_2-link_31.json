        "text": "While the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) is still pursuing its goal of getting Congress to pass the “AM Radio in Every Vehicle Act*,” the number of AM radio stations on-the-air continues to shrink.\n\nHow Many Radio Stations Are There?\n\nInside Radio published the latest FCC radio station count and the number of AM radio stations on-the-air continues to shrink.\n\nIn 1968, I passed my 3rd Class Radiotelephone FCC License, Broadcast endorsed, it was also the year that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began publishing its Broadcast Station Totals reports.\n\nAt that time the FCC said that 4,236 AM radio stations and 2,306 FM radio stations were on the air.\n\nIn December 1990, the next report the FCC published became available showing 4,987 AM radio stations and 5,832 full power FM radio stations were now on the air; plus, another 1,866 FM translator/boosters.\n\nIt’s worthy to note that the general public cannot tell the difference between a:\n\nFull power FM\n\nFM booster\n\nFM translator signal\n\nas to the FM listener they all are received on a standard AM/FM receiver. Only broadcasters, broadcast engineers and the FCC are concerned about such distinctions.\n\nSo, in just the first two decades of my radio career, FM signals outnumbered AM signals by 2,711.\n\nTelecommunications Act of 1996\n\nOn February 8, 1996, President William Jefferson Clinton signed into law what is commonly referred to as “The Telcom Act of 96.” The intent of the legislation was to allow more companies to operate in the communications space, but what actually happened was a flurry of mergers and acquisitions as corporate media giants bought out small, local broadcasters.\n\nThe FCC reported that as of February 29, 1996 there were:\n\n4,906 AM stations\n\n7,151 FM stations\n\n2,527 FM translators/boosters on-the-air\n\nalmost two FM signals beating the airwaves to every AM signal.\n\nA year after the Telcom Act of 96, the number of AM signals began its decline to:\n\n4,840 (a loss of 66 AM signals in one year)\n\nfull power FM signals increased to 7,295 (up 144 FM signals)\n\nFM translator/booster signals grew to 2,744 (up 217 FM signals)\n\nWhile AM radio signals were signing off, FM radio signals were growing by an additional 361.\n\nTen Years After Passage of the Telcom Act of 96\n\nOn March 31, 2006, ten years after the Telcom Act became law, and the consolidation of the radio industry began, the FCC Broadcast Station Totals report listed:\n\n4,759 AM signals\n\n8,989 full power FM signals\n\n4,049 FM translator/booster signals\n\nand now something new began appearing, Low Power FM signals (LPFM) which numbered 712, meaning the radio listening consumer could now access 13,750 FM signals versus 4,759 AM signals.\n\nWall Street investors were clearly showing more interest in FM signals than AM signals as their money poured into the radio industry.\n\nTwenty Years After Passage of the Telcom Act of 96\n\nTwenty years after President Clinton signed the Telcom Act and consolidation continued squeezing out the mom and pop broadcasters, the FCC Broadcast Station Totals report listed:\n\n4,680 AM signals (down 307 signals from the day I began my broadcast career)\n\n10,811 full power FM signals\n\n6,582 FM translator/booster signals\n\n1,516 LPFM signals\n\nAM signals totaled 4,680 and FM signals totaled 18,908.\n\nRadio Broadcast Signals 2024\n\nWhich brings us to the present day report, March 31, 2024. The FCC Broadcast Station Totals report now lists:\n\n4,427 AM signals\n\n10,983 full power FM signals\n\n8,913 FM translator/booster signals\n\n1,960 LPFM signals\n\nRemember, the radio listening public DOES NOT distinguish between the different classifications of FM signals, as they all appear on the same FM radio receiver they are using.\n\nTo the radio listener, they have\n\n4,427 AM signals compared to 21,856 FM signals\n\nthey can access. Almost 5 times as many FM signals as AM signals, and each year we witness those AM signals either reducing their power or just signing off-the-air and turning in their FCC broadcast license.\n\nRadio Dominates in Vehicles\n\nThe latest research from Quu ( www.quureport.com ) shows that in 2023 model vehicles:\n\n100% of them have an FM radio\n\n98% of them have an AM radio\n\n98% of them have Android Audio\n\n98% of them have Apple CarPlay\n\n92% have SiriusXM\n\n70% have HD Radio\n\nWhat surprised me about this research report, was that this was the first time I’ve ever seen separate AM and FM numbers listed. All reporting about radio usage should list AM and FM listening separately. I feel it is disingenuous to give the false impression that AM and FM broadcast signals contribute equally when that’s clearly NOT the case.\n\nHaving access to an audio service does not equate to usage.\n\nFred Jacobs in his TechSurvey 2023 for example, revealed how HD Radio was only listened to by 16% and SiriusXM was only listened to by 28%, which shows that despite their high availability numbers in vehicle dashboards, usage is still low. Unfortunately, AM/FM is never broken apart, but listed together so can they can garner 86% of the listening.\n\nI’m thinking that both HD radio and SiriusXM usage might eclipse AM radio listening, if we were allowed to see AM and FM usage shown separately.\n\nVehicles On The Road in America Today\n\nAccording to S&P Global Mobility, there are 284 million vehicles on our roadways and the average age of them continues to rise to a new record of 12.5 years. About 23% of all passenger cars now are 20 years or older with the bulk of them made between 2015 and 2019.\n\nBy 2050, when electric vehicles are projected to make up 60% of new sales, the majority of vehicles on America’s highways will still be powered by gasoline, because most vehicles today last twenty years meaning AM radio will still be in most cars, but the bigger question is how many AM radio stations will still be on-the-air.\n\nRadio Needs To Look Forward\n\nIn ten to twenty years, AM radio will be at best a niche way to listen to audio.\n\nWhere the radio industry and the National Association of Broadcasters should be focusing their time is keeping FM radio viable, in all vehicles and FREE!\n\nSadly, the FM band is becoming overcrowded with signals and this, I believe, needs to be seriously addressed.\n\nFinally, I would like to believe, as does Scott Shannon, that radio can still succeed in the 21st Century if it will just be “authentic, local, magical, and deliver an audio product with passion.” Or as radio programming consultant and author Valerie Geller puts it:\n\nGreat radio is interesting people communicating with listeners\n\nby telling the truth, making it matter and never being boring.\n\nIn 1984, when I was hired as a general manager in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Pierre Bouvard was my first sales representative from the Arbitron Company. I’ve known Pierre for forty years and have great respect for him. But his latest research presentation “Nielsen: AM/FM Radio Expands Its Ratings Lead Over TV And Smashing AM/FM Radio’s Drive Time Myth” https://www.westwoodone.com/blog/2024/03/04/nielsen-am-fm-radio-expands-its-ratings-lead-over-tv-and-smashing-am-fm-radios-drive-time-myth/ does something that really troubles me. It combines AM listening with FM listening, as if they contributed equally to radio’s total listening pie. They don’t.\n\nI first wrote about this uneasiness in an article six years ago titled “AM/FM or just FM?” I felt it was worth re-sharing what I wrote as this blog has now broken through the 300,000 views level. I think you will find what I wrote is even more pertinent in the 21st Century.\n\nAM/FM or just FM?\n\nThere’s something that’s been troubling me for some time. It’s the radio industry’s habit of reporting radio listening results by calling it “AM/FM” versus what it really is, virtually all FM radio listening.\n\nNieman Lab\n\nWho could not be buoyed by this headline from Nieman Lab: “AM/FM radio holds strong for American listeners.” ( http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/07/am-fm-radio-holds-strong-for-american-listeners/ )\n\nBut is it true?\n\nWhen I read the ratings reports from both PPM and diary markets, I see an FM world.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I grew up on AM radio and recognize that almost every market has a heritage AM radio station that still garners a big audience. I’m not blind to the wonderful ratings of 1010 WINS in New York City for example.\n\nBut there are only 26 all-news terrestrial radio stations left in America according to Nieman. This popular format is missing from the majority of America’s radio markets.\n\nWTOP\n\nWTOP was built on AM radio. It moved its entire operation over to the FM band and grew its audience, revenues and lowered its listener demographic. People who never heard this radio station on its AM dial position were suddenly newly minted fans of their all news format.\n\nThe FCC Saves AM Radio\n\nThe FCC’s mission to save AM radio is to give these radio stations an FM dial position using a translator. What are we really saving? The AM band or a particular format that a radio operator created on the AM band and now, to survive, needs to move it, like WTOP, to the FM side of the dial.\n\nWIP\n\nFrom my blogging, I get lots of feedback about a variety of things concerning broadcasting. One reader wrote to me about his father, a sports fan, who turned on WIP-FM to hear the latest chatter. WIP-FM was broadcasting a game of no interest to his father, so his son said to him, why don’t you turn on WIP AM610. Sadly, this person wrote the audio was unlistenable. He wrote: “You’d think the FCC would mandate that AM have standards for audio quality in receivers.”\n\nWSM\n\nWhen I was living in Bowling Green, Kentucky, I couldn’t receive 650AM WSM in my office, even though my office looked south and my antenna was able to enjoy a full wall of windows. The noise floor both inside my university office as well as around town while driving in my car made the station unlistenable. WSM was once listened to all the way to Louisville in northern Kentucky. Instead, I downloaded WSM’s app and could enjoy the radio station in crystal clear stereo. (I see WSM has stopped subscribing to Nashville Nielsen Audio ratings.)\n\nBBC\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) did a review of the range of services it offered on the AM band (called medium wave across the pond) and it included a financial review of all its services too. They concluded the ROI (return on investment) in AM was not there and announced they would be turning off some 13-AM radio stations in January 2018 according to Radio Business Reports.\n\nWHVO\n\nThere’s a great radio operator in Cadiz, Kentucky by the name of Beth Mann. WHVO is her AM radio station at 1480, but if you go on her website, you won’t find any mention of this station being on the AM radio dial. It’s promoted as WHVO 96.5 & 100.9 FM. ( http://www.whvoradio.com/ )\n\nBottom Line\n\nIt’s time to face the fact that AM radio needs to be re-deployed for a new service. Current radio station owners should be given a viable FM dial position that replaces their AM service area, and doesn’t require multiple translators to attempt to accomplish this task. (Note: WHVO needs two translators to deliver the signal of its AM 1480.)\n\nIt’s time to allow those same dedicated radio broadcasters to sell off their expensive AM tower sites and turn off their AM stations that consume electrical power with no real ROI.\n\nEcclesiastes 3\n\n“To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven…”\n\nAM radio’s time has come and gone as the mass communication delivery system it was from the 1920s to the 1970s, much as radio replaced vaudeville.\n\nTo put things in perspective, at a time in America’s radio history when the number of FM signals equaled the number of AM signals on the air, 75% of all radio listening was to FM. So, you can only imagine what it’s like today for AM radio listening.\n\nThat’s why I believe we do no service in promoting radio as “AM/FM” and not being honest about where virtually all of the radio listening is really taking place.\n\nSadly, AM radio is to broadcasting as coal is to power generation. ( https://dicktaylorblog.com/2017/08/20/coal-aint-coming-back-neither-is-am-radio/ ) It was the perfect solution in its day.\n\nCommercial radio was born in November of 1920. The first OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) car radio came along in 1922 designed by the Chevrolet Motor Company and manufactured by Westinghouse. This first car radio was heavy, cumbersome and expensive; costing $200. In today’s dollars this would be the equivalent of $3,347.00. A 1922 Chevrolet, Superior 5-Touring automobile was priced at only $860, so you can see how expensive it was to buy one with a radio installed.\n\nThe good news is the radio worked and would then birth 100-years of innovation in the automobile dashboard.\n\nThe 1920s Car Radio Sales Pitch\n\nWith a radio in your car, your family could drive anywhere within a hundred miles of a radio station while being entertained, informed and educated.\n\nIt’s hard for any Baby Boomer to imagine not having audio entertainment as standard equipment in their dashboard.\n\n1930s\n\nIt was radio engineer Paul Galvin that would pioneer more affordable car radios which he manufactured and sold through his new company, called Motorola.\n\n1940s\n\nMidway through the 40s, it is estimated that nine million cars now had radios in their dashboard and people were becoming concerned that they were leading to distracted driving thereby causing more auto accidents. Both broadcasters and radio manufacturers made the case for how having a car radio was useful in emergencies and alerted drivers to bad weather conditions.\n\nToday when the topic of distracted driving comes up, it’s usually about handheld cellphones being used by drivers. But back then, Radio-Craft Magazine told of the battle being waged between state legislatures and radio manufacturers: “Ever since auto-radio installations became popular, a controversy has been going on…as to whether auto radio presented an accident hazard or not.”\n\nThe president of the Radio Manufacturers Association made the case that car radios were safe saying:\n\n“Radio is not distracting because it demands no attention from the driver and requires no answer, as does conversation between the driver and passengers. Motor car radio is tuned by ear without the driver taking his eyes off the road. It is less disconcerting than the rear view mirror.”\n\nSeveral states proposed steep fines for drivers, while others considered making installing a car radio a crime.\n\nThe Princeton Radio Research Project was created to study the effects car radios were having on automobile safety. In a paper published by Edward A. Suchman for that project, he reported that his small study found no link between car radios and traffic accidents.\n\n1960s\n\nIn 1963, Frequency Modulation (FM) radios were introduced into the automobile for the first time. Radio penetration in cars had now reached 60%.\n\nAlong with FM radios, the 60s also gave birth to both eight-track tapes and car stereos, primarily due to the use of transistors, instead of vacuum tubes. Solid state transistors were smaller, drew less power and emitted very little heat.\n\n1970s\n\nIf the 60s belonged to the 8-track tape player, the 70s would belong to the stereo cassette tape player. Recording tape manufacturer Maxell promoted these cassettes as nearly indestructible.\n\n1980s\n\nWhile the Compact Disc (CD) would be introduced in the 80s, it didn’t really become ubiquitous until the late 90s, coexisting with compact cassette players in automobile dashboards for two more decades.\n\n21st Century\n\nProbably the biggest disruption to the automobile dashboard came with the advent of Bluetooth allowing smartphones to interface with a vehicle’s entertainment system.\n\nIn 2011, automobile manufacturers stopped offering cassette tape players in their new cars, soon followed by the elimination of CD players/changers.\n\nToday’s new cars come equipped with access to Satellite Radio, and an automatic interface with your smartphone allowing you the ability to stream anything you want to hear into your car’s entertainment system.\n\nIn fact, my first article for this blog in 2022 was “Why I Stream ALL My Radio Listening,” which diagrammed how my car radio audio systems are now programmed by my iPhone.\n\n“Radio is not going to be Numero Uno in the dash any longer.”\n\n-Fred Jacobs\n\nAM/FM radio will most likely coexist with other forms of audio access for a period of time, but the writing is on the wall.\n\nThe definitive answer to how long over-the-air radio will continue to be used in the automobile really depends on broadcasters and whether or not they offer compelling and attention-getting content that audio consumers demand to hear.\n\nAutoStage\n\nXperi’s newest in-dash experience is AutoStage. It was demonstrated at CES2022 and it should be noted that this system comes with the following pre-sets: SiriusXM, FM, AM and TuneIn Radio.\n\nI use the TuneIn Radio App for most of my radio listening, but why was it chosen by Mercedes Benz? Turns out the answer is, “TuneIn’s radio stations can be accessed worldwide in 197 countries on more than 200 different platforms and devices.” TuneIn says it “provides the displaced radio listener a connection to home with local, national, and international stations anywhere they go and on any device.”\n\nIn other words, why would any audio consumer need DAB (Digital Audio Broadcasting), DAB+, Digital Radio Mondiale, HD Radio, AM or FM when they can receive any radio station in crystal clear audio via streaming?\n\nWith the exception of the proprietary content offered by SiriusXM, everything else is available via streaming at no charge.\n\nWaxing Nostalgic\n\nCar radio has come a long way from the day William Lear and Elmer Wavering drove their girlfriends to lookout point high above the Mississippi River town of Quincy, Illinois to watch the sunset and their dates told them how much better this romantic evening would have been had they been able to listen to music in the car.\n\nLear and Wavering shared their girlfriends’ comments with Paul Galvin who would go on to make Motorola car transistor radios, and then AM/FM radio would dominate the dashboard for the rest of the 20th Century.\n\nSo, now moving further into the 21st Century, radio broadcasters really need to follow the advice of Steve Jobs in order to survive and thrive, and that is to:\n\nThink Different\n\nTwelve year ago, radio broadcast engineer Tom Ray, penned these words: “Unless we give Joe Consumer a reason to go out and purchase an HD Radio for his car – until he can obtain it easily and at a reasonable cost, and a device that works – I fear HD Radio is going to go the way of FM quad and AM stereo, relegated to the scrap pile of history.”\n\nTom Ray wrote his article for Radio World when he was the vice president/corporate director of engineering for Buckley Broadcasting/WOR Radio in New York City. He was a strong and vocal supporter of HD Radio and his WOR was one of the first AMs on the air with an HD Radio signal. So, any broadcaster that read Tom’s article, “HD Radio Shouldn’t Be This Hard,” should have taken it as a wake-up call about steps the radio industry needed to take to stay relevant in their listeners’ lives.\n\nBuying a New Car in 2010\n\nTom is a loyal Ford customer, so when his Explorer went to the automobile graveyard with 230,000-miles on it, Tom wanted to get a new Ford Escape, equipped with HD Radio. The only problem was, Ford wasn’t putting HD Radios into their Escapes, instead, they were pushing Satellite Radio. (Tom noted that his wife listened only to Satellite Radio in her car, saying “in her opinion there is nothing worth listening to in New York’s Hudson Valley, 50 miles north of New York City.)\n\nThis should have been yet another radio industry wake-up call about its future.\n\nI encourage you to click on the link and read what Tom Ray wrote a dozen years ago about how difficult it was to put an HD Radio into a new car which, at that time, didn’t offer OEM HD Radios and how he, as a broadcast engineer, was totally frustrated trying to install an aftermarket one.\n\nStreaming Radio at Home\n\nSince Christmas 2017, when my wife gave me my first Amazon Echo smart speaker, our Echo family has quickly grown to four of these devices. There is nowhere you can be in our home and not ask Alexa for something.\n\nSince 2017, all of our in-home radio listening is via streaming.\n\nWhile we also occasionally streamed radio in the car, on all of our road trips from 2018-2021, SiriusXM always seemed to be offering a 3-month free listening trial that I can honestly say we enjoyed the listening to. But, I’ve never been a subscriber, because other than road trips I spend very little time in the car.\n\nStreaming Radio in the Car\n\nIn October, while enjoying my latest free 3-month trial for SiriusXM radio, I decided it was time to bring my in-house streaming radio habit into both of our cars. We own a 2006 Subaru Forester and a 2009 Honda Accord.\n\nThe Subaru doesn’t have an AUX input, the Honda does.\n\nStreaming in the Subaru was accomplished with a Blue Tooth receiver that will broadcast on any FM frequency (88.1 works best). In the Honda, this same device’s output was plugged into an AUX receptacle.\n\nThe result is, as soon as either my wife or myself enters one of our cars, the Nulaxy KM18 immediately pairs with our iPhones. I installed the AINOPE Car Phone Holder Mount to hold our phones, and keep them easily assessible to control whatever we would like to listen to.\n\nTotal cost for each car: $33.43. Time to install, virtually nil. I just plugged the Nulaxy KM18 into a power port and it was operational. The AINIOPE holder easily clamps to an air vent on the dashboard and holds any smartphone.\n\nUnlike the nightmare that Tom Ray experienced back in 2010 trying to put HD Radio into his car, this installation by me, a non-engineer, was a piece of cake.\n\nA Call to Action\n\nI recently sat in on a Radio World webinar called “A Call to Action, radio’s existential battle for the dash.” Paul McLane, Managing Director of Content/Editor in Chief of Radio World at Radio World/Future U.S., hosted the webinar and did an excellent job. However, one particular piece of information shared during the presentation that I thought was crucial was, how Mercedes Benz was equipping their vehicles’ radio screens with the following pre-sets: SiriusXM, FM, AM and TuneIn Radio.\n\nTuneIn Radio is the App I use for most of my radio listening, but why was it chosen by Mercedes Benz? Turns out the answer is, “TuneIn’s radio stations can be accessed worldwide in 197 countries on more than 200 different platforms and devices.” TuneIn says it “provides the displaced radio listener a connection to home with local, national, and international stations anywhere they go and on any device.”\n\nIn other words, why would any audio consumer need DAB, DAB+, Digital Radio Mondiale, HD Radio, AM or FM when they can receive any radio station in crystal clear audio via streaming?\n\nWith the exception of the proprietary content offered by SiriusXM, everything else is available via streaming at no charge.\n\nCellular Plan\n\nNow it goes without saying, that streaming consumes data. Each cellphone service provider offers different plans and different price rates. My wife and I are on Verizon’s unlimited phone/text/data plan. We have no landline phone in our home and our iPhones are our lifeline to being connected with each other, our family, our community and the world.\n\nI’ve found streaming radio in our cars provides us with audio quality that is pristine. There’s no buffering or dropout, and it’s been a more reliable signal than AM, FM or SiriusXM radio, especially when traveling through tunnels.\n\nStreaming Apps\n\nI thought you might be interested in knowing what streaming Apps I have on my iPhone, here’s the current list:\n\nTuneIn Pro\n\nAudacy\n\nPandora\n\nSpotify\n\nAmazon Music\n\nNPR ONE\n\nYouTube\n\nSimple Radio\n\nStreamS\n\nApple Podcasts\n\nAccuRadio\n\n650AM WSM\n\nStitcher\n\nWhy I Prefer Streaming My Radio\n\nWe live far enough away from Washington, D.C. that radio signals for WTOP or WETA experience lots of noise and dropout, depending atmospherics, sometimes making them totally unlistenable. However, their streams are always crystal clear.\n\nThis fall Sue and I escaped to Cape Cod for a week and when I get on the peninsula, I love turning on WFCC – Cape Cod’s Classical station – 107.5 FM. Now with streaming radio, I can dial up WFCC on my TuneIn radio App and listen when we’re back home in Virginia.\n\nFull disclosure, I am the midday DJ on WMEX-FM in Rochester, NH. But even if I weren’t on the station, WMEX-FM would be my #1 pre-set for streaming. Gary James, the station’s morning man and program director, puts together a music mix that I find absolutely fabulous. It’s the music of my life.\n\nWhich brings me to another important point, radio today is global. No longer is your radio station competing just with other local stations, but radio that is streaming from anywhere on planet Earth.\n\nStreaming also makes it possible for ON DEMAND spoken word radio, also known as Podcasts, to be easily available in the car.\n\nSimington on Streaming\n\nFCC commissioner Nathan Simington recently addressed Ohio broadcasters saying, “content delivery power had shifted away from broadcasters – stations and networks – and toward ‘online platforms,’ something he thinks the FCC needs to recognize in its quadrennial review of media ownership regs.”\n\nHe warned that:\n\n“Online media platforms are growing rapidly and threaten dominance over traditional media platforms; and\n\nBroadcast advertising revenue has flatlined, having been siphoned off from higher margin online platforms.”\n\nThe Future is Streaming\n\n88% of the world’s population now uses mobile broadband as its main source of internet access, and nearly 90% of homes in the United States now have internet streaming. 2021 saw an estimated 22% ad industry growth rate, which Magna Global said was “the highest growth rate ever recorded” by this agency, beating a 12.5% growth rate recorded in the year 2000. The caveat however is, digital dominated traditional advertising raking in 64.4% of the growth in ad spending.\n\nRAIN reports “The U.S. recorded music industry will exceed a 48-year revenue record set in 1999 (based on current estimates),” all coming from revenues paid by streaming music services.\n\nThe Harvard Business Review recently published “4 Principles to Guide Your Digital Transformation,” by Greg Satell, Andrea Kates and Todd McLees. In it, the authors wrote, “digital transformation is not just about technology. We’re desperately in need of a shift in focus. Leaders must inspire and empower their entire organization to boldly reimagine their work environment, customer needs, product offering, and even the purpose of the enterprise.”\n\nTom Ray was the proverbial “canary in the coal shaft” back in 2010, with few paying attention. Sadly, based on the early news coming out of the 2022 CES in Las Vegas, nothing has changed.\n\nWe’re living in a communications revolution,\n\nbringing about changes that will be both\n\npermanent and irreversible.\n\nRevolutions never maintain or preserve the status quo.\n\nLast week, an article in The Atlantic titled “The Well Fixer’s Warning: The lesson that California never learns,” was a terrifying read about the water supply used to irrigate the almond orchards on the farms of Madera County. So many of the farm’s wells were coming up dry and the farmers were puzzled as to why water flowing out of their wells had been reduced to a trickle and were mostly producing sand.\n\nMatt Angell is not only an almond farmer himself, but owns Madera Pumps, a company that drills wells and repairs well pumps. He knows that droughts, like the California sunshine go hand-in-hand, and as John Steinbeck wrote: “no one (forgets) the last drought faster than the farmer.”\n\nSince the middle 1970s, almond farmers have persevered through at least five droughts and their solution to the problem was always the same – BUILD MORE DAMS.\n\nBUILD MORE DAMS\n\nThose three words stopped me cold. Who else thinks like this? Radio people, that’s who.\n\nToday in America, there are now 26,076 radio stations on the air, 2,500 of these stations are broadcasting in HD which adds another 2,100 multicast radio channels to the mix. That’s about a 93% increase in the number of radio signals from when I started in high school.\n\nThe radio industry and almond farmers, have both felt that the way to grow is by adding more and more and more. Almond farmers added more acreage of almond trees and radio owners added more signals.\n\nAquifers\n\nThe dam reality was the San Joaquin River already had a half-a-dozen dams diverting its water, so the next solution to obtaining more water for almond irrigation was to drill down to the aquifers beneath the farmlands. Unfortunately, it didn’t take long for the farmers of Madera County to pump out the easily available ground water and see their wells coming up dry. As they were drilling deeper and deeper into the earth, a hidden lake beneath the farmlands was discovered in 2014. It was shocking to see it pumped dry in only seven years.\n\nAngell noted that the snow on the mountain had melted two months earlier than “normal,” and the water level of the San Joaquin river was so low, it was now nothing more than a series of unconnected ponds as well as the wells – residential, business and farming – all over the community were running dry.\n\nThe reality is, the Madera County underground water table is one of the most over-tapped aquifers in the West, and all those wells had depleted the underground water source, causing the aquifer to collapse.\n\nThe Advertising Pie\n\nIt was before the COVID19 pandemic gripped our world, Gordon Borrell hosted a webinar back in early 2019 and told of how the media pie (the radio industry’s aquifer, if you will) is over-tapped.\n\nTo put things in perspective, Gordon shared how an over-populated media landscape is impacting local advertisers.\n\n1,300 daily newspapers, 6,500 weeklies\n\n4,700 printed directory books\n\n4,665 AM radio stations, 6,757 commercial FM radio stations\n\n1,760 Class A TV stations\n\nMore than 1,000 cable systems with local sales staffs\n\n660,000 podcasts were actively produced in 2018\n\n495 NEW TV shows were introduced last year in addition to what’s already on\n\nPLUS, local ad sales are taking place on Facebook, Google and Amazon\n\nSame Old Answer\n\nDespite the fact that the water from the aquifer and river was being depleted by droughts, climate change and being over-tapped, the almond farmers’ answer was always the same, said Mark Angell, “Plant more almonds and pistachios. Plant more housing tracts on farmland. But the river isn’t the same. The aquifer isn’t the same.”\n\nListen to radio owners, and they will tell you they too need more and more radio signals in order to stay viable, despite the fact that the advertising pie is finite and media supported by advertising continues to expand exponentially.\n\n“I used to use the word unprecedented to describe what we’re doing to the land,” said Angell, but “now I use the word biblical.” Is it any different for radio broadcasters?\n\nThe Solution\n\nFor the nut farmers of Madera County, the solution is a hard pill to swallow, it’s “to figure out a way to retire one million acres of the six million farmed, “otherwise, we’re looking at a race to the bottom,” said Angell.\n\nFor radio broadcasters, Gordon Borrell said the solution to the future of media expenditures would be a process of “thinning the herd.”\n\nThe way advertising buyers are responding to a world of media abundance, Borrell says, is by:\n\nDecreasing the number of companies from which they buy advertising from 5 to 3.5, and\n\n90% of their media buys are being made with companies who can bundle traditional and digital advertising.\n\nKilling the Golden Goose\n\nDo you remember the Aesop fable of the goose that laid the golden eggs? Let me refresh your memory of this tale. It’s about a farmer that was poor. One day he makes a startling discovery when he finds a golden egg in the nest of his pet goose. Skeptical at first, he has the egg tested and finds that it is indeed made of pure gold. Even more amazing, each day this farmer awakes to find that his goose has laid another golden egg. In very short order, this poor farmer becomes fabulously wealthy. But then his wealth brings greed and impatience. No longer satisfied with just one golden egg per day, the farmer cuts open his goose to harvest all of its golden eggs at once only to find the goose is empty inside. With a now dead goose, there will be no more golden eggs laid.\n\nIn remembering this fable, it sounded so familiar to the world of radio broadcasting and almond farmers. Both possessed a wonderful “goose” that laid daily “golden eggs.”\n\nUnfortunately for almond farmers, in wanting more, they are killing their water supply, and for broadcasters not wishing to wait for each day’s golden egg, cut open their goose beginning with the Telcom Act of 1996, that allowed them to own as many radio stations as they basically wished.\n\nThe moral of Aesop’s fable is if you focus only on the golden eggs and neglect the goose that lays them, you will soon be without the very asset that produces the golden eggs.\n\nThe radio industry’s quest for short-term returns, or results, took their free FCC licenses and ruined them by not maintaining the balance between the production of desired results and the production capacity of the asset.\n\nAesop’s fable is the very principle of effectiveness. It’s a natural law. Like gravity, you don’t have to believe in it or understand its principles, but you can never escape its effects.\n\nRadio broadcasters probably saw the moral of the fable being the more geese you own, the more spots you add to the hour, the more effective your R.O.I. (Return On Investment) will be.\n\nAlmond farmers saw the moral of the fable as planting more trees, install more powerful pumps to withdraw more water and watch your R.O.I. grow.\n\nBut ironically, it is the principle of “Less Is More” that in the end rules the day.\n\nTo be truly effective, you need to maintain the balance of what is produced (golden eggs/revenue) and the producing asset (your goose/radio station/almond trees).\n\nEverything in excess\n\nis opposed to nature.\n\n-Hippocrates\n\nI was reading about how HD Radio was celebrating its 15th birthday recently and that had me scratching my head as HD Radio is older than that. In checking the records, I saw that the Federal Communications Commission selected HD Radio as America’s digital standard in 2002. By comparison, Steve Jobs introduced Apple’s iPod in October 2001, XM Satellite Radio began service in 2001 and Sirius Satellite Radio in 2002.\n\nRadios Go High-Definition\n\nThis was the headline that appeared in the Baltimore Sun on January 7, 2004. Unfortunately, unlike HDTV (High Definition Television) HD Radio never stood for “High Definition.” And possibly that was the first mistake. HD Radio was simply a name they chose for the digital radio technology, but even today, many people still think it means “High Definition” or “Hybrid Digital.”\n\nSadly, by 2004, America’s digital radio was late to the party and if the industry is now marking the date of 2006 as its moment of birth, it was really late!\n\nRemembering 2006\n\nIn 2006, Facebook opened up its social network to everyone in the world. The original requirement that you be a college student enrolled at a specific university was eliminated and the only requirement now was that you were over the age of 13 and had a valid email address.\n\nIn just 15-years, Facebook has grown to over 2.85 billion active monthly users.\n\nLet’s look at what else was born in 2006 that competes for our attention:\n\nTwitter was launched in 2006 and today enjoys 199 million monetizable daily active users.\n\nWii game system was introduced with its handheld motion controller that got families off the couch and in motion doing all kinds of sports in front of the TV.\n\nPlayStation 3 came online to provide strong competition to XBOX 360. (Video gamers spent about eight hours and 27 minutes each week playing games, which is an increase of 14% over 2020. The video gaming industry predicts revenues of $100.56 billion by 2024)\n\nGoogle bought YouTube in 2006 and now has over 2 billion users, the channel grosses over $19.7 billion in revenue and users are uploading videos at the rate of 500 videos per minute with over a billion hours/day spent watching videos on the platform.\n\nThe one billionth song was purchased from Apple’s iTunes, the dominate source for music lovers in 2006. (Two years later Spotify would arrive and not only disrupt how music was sold but how it was listened to in general.)\n\nWhen we look at 2006, it becomes easier to understand why HD Radio wasn’t such a big deal to the average media consumer.\n\nSolving a Problem That Didn’t Exist\n\nWhat HD Radio did for FM radio stations was solve a problem that listeners to FM didn’t feel existed. No one who listened to FM radio was complaining about the quality of the sound, they were complaining about other things, like too many commercials. And for AM radio stations, it meant people buying radios for a service that didn’t offer anything they really wanted to hear or couldn’t get elsewhere. AM radio was now the service of senior citizens who already owned AM radios, who grew up with AM radio’s characteristics and whose hearing was not the best now anyway. So, HD Radio for AM wasn’t anything they were asking for and worse, AM radio stations that put on the new digital signal found it lacked the benefits of skywave and often interfered with other company AM radio stations as the industry quickly consolidated radio ownership.\n\nIndustries Most Disrupted By Digital\n\nIn March 2016, an article published by Rhys Grossman in the Harvard Business Review listed “Media” as the most disrupted by the growing digital economy. Turns out, if you’re a business-to-consumer business, you’re first being most disrupted by digital. The barriers to be a media company used to be huge, but in a digital world they are not, meaning that the business model that media companies depend on has not adapted well to the digital economy.\n\nElephant in the Room\n\nBut the elephant in the room remains the broken media business model. Newspapers, magazines, radio, and television – any media that is ad supported – will be challenged to find a way to capture revenue to continue operating.\n\nWalt Disney famously said “We don’t make movies to make money, we make money to make movies.”\n\nBroadcasters of my generation had that same attitude about creating great radio.\n\nDo the people owning and operating today’s radio stations still embrace that concept?\n\n* In 2021, it’s estimated there are 3.78 billion social media users worldwide.\n\nSue & I just returned from a seven week trip out west to visit our children and grandchildren who are living in Nevada, Montana and Washington. For me, our trip would also be a chance to witness how radio is used (or not used) in three different households, as well as in hotels, businesses and public transportation. What I would witness, was concerning.\n\nNevada\n\nIn Nevada, I noticed that for a household of seven, not a single radio was to be found. Audio was accessed by asking Alexa (Amazon Echo) to play something or a particular playlist was sent wirelessly to speakers via someone’s iPhone. Everyone, even the very youngest grandchild, who’s five, had their own iPhone.\n\nIn a house where both parents work, and can be called out at any hour of the day, this type of communications for all family members becomes a necessity.\n\nRadio listening, if done at all, was something only done when in the car. Television, was connected to a cable bundle and only CNN or Netflix seemed to get viewed. The grandkids spent most of their time playing video games on the house computer, game console or their iPhones.\n\nMontana\n\nHere a Sonos home speaker system had been installed in the home. I found that two different local radio stations (country & classic rock) were programmed into rotation, along with an Amazon Echo smart speaker. Our grandkids called up songs they wanted to hear by asking Alexa to play them, so in the week we spent, Alexa was pretty much the default choice for anything musically played.\n\nTelevision programs were all streamed via YouTube TV.\n\nRadio pre-sets in the car were set to several country stations, several classic rock stations, several contemporary music stations and an oldies station. In all, 22 different radio stations were loaded onto the pre-sets. I added KBMC to that pre-set list when we borrowed the car a couple of times. KBMC programs a variety of jazz and classical music.\n\nWashington\n\nOur stay in the State of Washington took place on Whidbey Island. The only radio signal licensed on the island plays regional Mexican music and the majority of its content is in Spanish. So, it wasn’t surprising to find the pre-sets on the car radio did not include KNZW – La Zeta 103.3.\n\nWhat was surprising was to see that all the pre-sets were to HD1 signals in this Mazda 6 sedan. (It appears Mazda has their radio default to HD signals and you have to toggle it off to get FM signals.) Since the island is just across the water from Seattle, all of the pre-sets were to Seattle radio stations. The two that dominated the listening in the car were KSWD (Audacy’s 94.1 The Sound) when mom was behind the wheel and KQMV (Hubbard’s Movin’ 92.5) when either of the grand kids got control of the radio. However, what is dispiriting to witness is how frequently the radio stations get changed whenever something comes on that they don’t wish to hear. When commercials come on, the station gets changed. Likewise, when songs they don’t like come on, the station gets changed. It’s like watching football using the Red Zone.\n\nHere again, not a single radio receiver was to be found inside the home.\n\nThe Bus & Hotels\n\nWhen we departed Whidbey Island, we took a bus into Seattle. On the bus we listened to KSWD 94.1 The Sound out of Seattle. It provided a nice sound track for the ride and the bus driver never changed the station for the two hours it took to reach our destination.\n\nEvery hotel room we stayed in featured flat screen TVs but none had a radio. The old clock radios have been replaced by digital clock/USB charging stations for our iPhones, iPads and laptop computers.\n\nSumming It All Up\n\nI realize there is nothing scientific about this, it’s all anecdotal, but it was a dose of reality that confirms much of the research I’m reading about today’s radio landscape.\n\nNo one in our seven weeks on the road tuned into any AM radio station. FM, was radio to everyone, but then, only in their vehicles. Listening to radio in the home was not possible, because there was only one radio in any of the homes we stayed at and that was in the garage.\n\nHD Radio sounds great, but in all honesty, the one family that had this easily accessible in their car, probably didn’t know that’s what they were listening to and it certainly wasn’t the reason they were listening to any particular station.\n\nWith the exception of our two hour bus ride, radio exposure could be measured in short segments, that only happened to occur because the radio comes on with the ignition switch. Sadly, changing radio stations occurs constantly, so any commercial content never gets heard.\n\nLikewise, businesses we frequented either had their own franchise “radio station,” like Walmart Radio or streamed a music channel from some other music service they subscribed to.\n\nIn our travels, we didn’t see a TV commercial, billboard or bumper sticker for any radio station. Lots of shirts and sweatshirts promoting lots of things, but not one for any radio station.\n\nRadio, it would appear, has become the Rodney Dangerfield of media.\n\n“We don’t get no respect.”\n\nBut then maybe, it’s a self-inflicted situation\n\nI sat in on Radio World’s presentation about “Digital Sunrise for AM Radio” hosted by editor-in-chief Paul McLane. The webcast lasted almost two hours and was technically informative.\n\nThe question Paul kept asking the presenters about going all digital on AM, was a question he hears numerous people asking him, “has the horse left the barn?” In other words, has the world moved on and does anyone really cares about AM radio anymore.\n\nBut that’s not the question that was running through my mind.\n\nToo Many Choices\n\nWe live in a world with infinite choices when it comes to audio & video entertainment. Twenty-eight years ago, Bruce Springsteen released his song “57 Channels and Nothing’s On.” The lyrics are very telling of the condition we find ourselves in today.\n\nI bought a bourgeois house in the Hollywood hills\n\nWith a truckload of hundred thousand dollar bills\n\nMan came by to hook up my cable TV\n\nWe settled in for the night my baby and me\n\nWe switched ’round and ’round ’til half-past dawn\n\nThere was fifty-seven channels and nothin’ on\n\nWell now home entertainment was my baby’s wish\n\nSo I hopped into town for a satellite dish\n\nI tied it to the top of my Japanese car\n\nI came home and I pointed it out into the stars\n\nA message came back from the great beyond\n\nThere’s fifty-seven channels and nothin’ on\n\nWell we might’a made some friends with some billionaires\n\nWe might’a got all nice and friendly if we’d made it upstairs\n\nAll I got was a note that said “bye-bye John\n\nOur love is fifty-seven channels and nothin’ on”\n\nSo I bought a .44 magnum it was solid steel cast\n\nAnd in the blessed name of Elvis well I just let it blast\n\n‘Til my TV lay in pieces there at my feet\n\nAnd they busted me for disturbing the almighty peace\n\nJudge said “What you got in your defense son?”\n\n“Fifty-seven channels and nothin’ on”\n\nI can see by your eyes friend you’re just about gone\n\nFifty-seven channels and nothin’ on\n\nIt’s not unusual for people to spend an entire evening going through the program guide on Netflix only to finally retire for the evening having not watched a single program. We’ve all done that.\n\nOn just Netflix alone it was estimated in 2015 that it would take a person 34,739 hours to watch everything available on the streaming service. I’m sure that number has grown considerably when you consider in 2019 Netflix introduced 371 series and movies to view.\n\nAdd to Netflix more television streaming services like Amazon Prime, Hulu, Apple TV+, Disney+, YouTube and it means choice is not the TV viewer’s problem, it’s choice paralysis. (And maybe also how to pay for it all.)\n\nALL DIGITAL AM\n\nThe question running through my mind about investing in building out an all-digital AM radio service in America is, “why?” When I scan the AM band now, I can hear the same talk shows on station after station. The FM band is no different when it comes to everyone doing the same type of programming.\n\nIt has me humming Bruce Springsteen’s song in my head, only with a lot more channels of programming attached to the “nothing’s on” part.\n\nDigital AM seems to be the answer to a question, that listeners aren’t asking.\n\nLess is More\n\nMany businesses fall into the trap of thinking that more products equal more sales and radio certainly can be accused of falling into that trap.\n\nHD Radio was designed to offer a higher quality broadcast signal for AM and FM radio stations. FM station owners didn’t really get interested in HD Radio until they learned they could feed FM translators with HD2, HD3 signals and put more FM analog signals on-the-air in their market.\n\nI learned that the all-digital AM service offers the opportunity for an HD2 signal that could feed another FM analog translator.\n\nWhat Al and Laura Ries tell us from their research is how this strategy of adding more and more choice becomes a trap and can lead to negative consequences in the long term.\n\nJust One Thing\n\nIn media sales, we try to have our clients identify what one thing makes them special and unique. What makes their business so different that consumers will want to come to them instead of their competitors. You may know this process as finding a business’s “unique selling proposition.”\n\nOne Good Reason\n\nBack in the day, 66-WNBC put up a billboard that gave radio listeners one good reason to turn their radio dial to 660 AM. It simply said “If we weren’t so bad, we wouldn’t be so good.”\n\nThis one simple sentence captured the essence of both Don Imus and Howard Stern. It was this radio station’s one good reason to listen. It was this radio station’s one good reason to advertise on it.\n\nAnd speaking of one, I was told by the WNBC Sales Manager that it only took one commercial on Howard Stern for an advertiser to see immediate sales results.\n\nThat’s the power of a unique brand.\n\nMisplaced Priorities\n\nRadio had a choice to make in the last decade, to either develop unique powerful brands localized to the marketplace the FCC licensed them to serve, or build out more signals with programming that was virtually hard to tell apart from one another. Unfortunately, the radio industry chose the latter and as a result has turned the business into a commodity.\n\nSomething for everyone equals nothing for nobody.\n\nEconomics defines a commodity as goods or services that have fungibility, or in other words something the marketplace treats as everything being nearly equivalent to each other, with little regard for who produces it.\n\nThis is why radio sales people will often hear advertisers says things like “all radio stations sound the same, now let’s talk about your spot price.”\n\nPerception is reality.\n\nOr should I say that the listener and advertiser’s perception is accurate with the reality today being all radio stations do sound the same.\n\nElections & Radio Listening\n\nI read an article the other day that said what changes the outcome of any election is turnout. That the way someone wins an election is by getting people, who normally sit it out on the couch, engaged and out to the polls. It’s not getting people to switch party affiliations.\n\nI think radio may have a similar problem.\n\nFor the radio industry to be growing again, what radio needs to be focused on, and investing in, are its people and programming, not putting more signals on the air with nothing to hear.\n\nThis week I sat in on the Fred Jacobs webinar “Mobile Strategy for Radio: What we learned from Techsurvey 2019” and the #1 take away was “voice (not just smart speakers) is the next important user interface at home and in the car.”\n\nI wasn’t surprised.\n\nThe Lowest Common Denominator\n\nHere’s where we can expect technology to be headed to accommodate the next billion users that will be joining the digital media party. The next internet addicted people are those living in the developing world, the ones that will be shaping the internet over the next five years or less. They will be impacting ALL internet and mobile users.\n\nWhat are the characteristics of these folks?\n\nLiteracy: lower levels of literacy will require different interfaces.\n\nLanguage: a greater variety of language needs will inspire new content formats.\n\nTechnology: varying devices & connections will impact content format.\n\nMotivations: new wants, needs, and desires will inspire new products & services.\n\nMost of today’s internet is text based, but as populations of lower literacy levels sign-on, that will change this. Voice commands, image search and video content will become more dominant in the near future.\n\nEconomies of Scale\n\nTechnology companies are already working to have all devices and interfaces operate the same way on a global basis. Everything will be designed to cater to the lowest common denominator because it makes fiscal sense. It’s already happening on Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.\n\nWhy Apple won’t ever put FM receivers into their iPhones.\n\nFM, HD Radio, DAB and DAB+ are all different standards for broadcasting OTA radio signals and do not meet the test of a global standard.\n\nThe Next Internet Revolution is Coming\n\nLook for the next billion to drive the next internet revolution in the areas of:\n\nSearch: SEO will look very different for voice-centric search.\n\nSocial: People’s social media interactions will be more video than text.\n\nShopping: E-commerce orders will depend on spoken word.\n\nAddressing: URLs & Hyperlinks will move from text to image.\n\nConvergence\n\nSomething I researched back when I was an undergrad, convergence, is coming to fruition in my lifetime. Every form of media will be delivered over the same pathway and received on the same type of device plus it will be on-demand and on our schedule, not the creator’s schedule.\n\nFred’s latest webinar shows that were deep into this transition.\n\nIf you’d like to take a Deep Dive into this subject, watch this Hootsuite webinar from 2018 HERE\n\nGrowing up in the 20th Century, things looked like what they were. Telephones were easily identified as telephones. Television sets were easily identified as televisions. And radios were easily identified as radios.\n\nI’m a member of many social media radio groups, I even host a couple of my own, and we all use classic radios to brand our social media pages. In my case, it’s a cathedral style radio made popular back in the 1930s. A style of radio I never owned until I received a retro transistorized version at a company manager’s meeting back in the late 1980s.\n\nSmartphone\n\nWhen the smartphone became ubiquitous and people began to listen to radio broadcasts on their phones, I wondered if the new icon for radio might be just that, a smartphone device. But then, this same device could also represent a TV, a camera, a movie camera, a book, a newspaper, a magazine…well you get the idea, a lot of media was instantly replaced by this singular device.\n\nSmartspeaker\n\nThen, a year ago, Santa brought me an Amazon Echo and Alexa became the servant I never had. She’s always there, waiting for me to call her name and fetch for me whatever I need, be it the latest news, weather, wind chill, traffic conditions, music, and more.\n\nI then thought that maybe the 21st Century radio icon would look like this device.\n\nAn App\n\nThese days, radio still dominates in the car, and the vehicles being produced today feature entertainment systems. These dashboard entertainment centers are loaded with unprecedented engagement capabilities and each one is accessed by an identifying App. Companies like Pandora and Spotify are providing a content rich environment to take full advantage these entertainment systems.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine how anyone will be able to keep their eyes on the road as song titles, logos, biographical information about the artists, concert dates and so much more accompanies the music that is playing.\n\nBy comparison, a broadcast radio station’s programming to these devices seems rather anemic.\n\nAnd things aren’t likely to change anytime soon, as broadcasters see the costs of these opportunities to be prohibitive on many levels. For one thing there are all the new licensing fees that could be attached to broadcasting this media rich environment. For another, the few people working in today’s radio clusters barely have enough time to get things done now without the addition of coordinating all of these other items. And if you add more people to handle the work, then the costs will really rise. So, Return On Investment (ROI) issues rear their ugly head and everything comes to a standstill.\n\nNot Right Now\n\nOver the years, I’ve been involved in these types of discussions and the phrase most often heard by those who hold power over the purse is “not right now.”\n\nDiscussions usually degenerate into the drawbacks of moving forward, or how these new innovations will be paid for, and end with no progress being made.\n\nThink AM Stereo. Think FM Quad. Think HD Radio (before broadcasters learned they could use HD’s subchannels to feed multiple FM analog translators).\n\nYes, Right Now\n\nThe reality is that these changes are taking place as we speak. Is the radio industry focused on the needs, wants and desires of future listeners or a 20th Century radio spectrum grab strategy?\n\n“Sometimes I feel like a creature in the wilds,\n\nwhose natural habitat is gradually being destroyed.”\n\n-Lord Grantham, Downton Abby\n\nRadio’s last beachhead is in the automobile.\n\nIf it doesn’t wish to see its dominance vanish, it will need to focus on all that the vehicle entertainment systems are capable of delivering, and provide the unique content that is a “must have” for the media consumer."
