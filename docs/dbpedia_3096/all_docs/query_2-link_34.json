        "text": "How to Start Your Radio Station\n\n1. Create a business plan\n\nThe first step of starting any business, including a radio station, is crafting a solid business plan. Business plans don’t just attract investors or help you secure loans, they can help put entrepreneurs on a path to financial stability. When you create your radio station business plan, you may want to:\n\nThink about your overall business idea. What kind of radio shows will you have? Are you launching a small online radio station with a couple of local podcasters? Or maybe you’re starting a local FM station or planning to compete with major commercial radio stations.\n\nDefine your target audience. Who is your listener and what kind of radio content will interest them? Are they into politics, music, news, or sports? You may want to run a market analysis to get a better hold on potential consumers.\n\nChoose a location. This is especially important if you’re broadcasting via the airwaves.\n\nIdentify potential problems and ways to solve them. Can you cover the startup costs? How do you take on part-time employees?\n\nCreate a marketing plan. Attract advertisers and build relationships — this is how your station will likely make money.\n\nSearch for tax breaks and local grants.\n\nIf you want more in-depth guidance about building a winning business plan, consult our complete business plan guide.\n\n2. Choose your radio station business structure\n\nAll businesses need to have a business structure, both for operating and tax purposes. It’s the main way the IRS decides how to handle your tax returns, and it’s often a prerequisite to obtaining the necessary licenses.\n\nMany small or startup radio stations opt for LLCs or sole proprietorships, while larger radio stations like iHeartMedia and other Fortune 500 companies often choose to incorporate. For these purposes, we’ll give you a rundown of the two former structures. In most states, it’s relatively simple to convert your LLC to a corporation if you decide to do so as your business grows.\n\nLLCs are one of the most popular small business structures in the U.S. because they allow business owners to avoid the so-called “double taxation” of corporations by passing through income to their personal return. Instead of taxing the same money twice (first on the corporate return, then on each owner’s personal return), LLCs only pay taxes on the members’ personal returns.\n\nLLCs also offer a limited amount of liability protection, are relatively quick to form online, and have minimal fees and paperwork compared to other structures with the same protection. While they’re not as easy to form as sole proprietorships, the help of a business formation service can make forming an LLC a breeze.\n\nSole proprietorships are taxed similarly to the default method for LLCs, but they don’t have the same liability protection, which means business owners can run into trouble in the event of a bankruptcy or lawsuit — your creditors could come after your personal bank accounts, house, and car if you’re a sole proprietor. That’s not typically the case for LLCs. Whatever you choose, you may want to consult an accountant or lawyer for advice before you file.\n\n3. Create a name for your radio station\n\nThe name of your radio station is how people will know your business, so it should encompass your brand. The right business name does wonders for brand recognition and word of mouth. The wrong name can get in the way of success.\n\nThink of a radio station name that can easily be recognized on social media and is available for domain registration. Before you choose, make sure your name isn’t taken by another business or you may face legal repercussions. You can check with your Secretary of State’s office or use a business registration service just to be sure. Want a simple name for your business and a flashy name for the actual station? Look into setting up a DBA name.\n\n4. Register your business and open financial accounts\n\nAfter you’ve raised the funds and have your idea completely nailed down, you’re going to have to do the paperwork. This includes:\n\nRegistering your business structure\n\nObtaining an employer identification number (EIN) from the IRS\n\nGetting the proper insurance (including general liability insurance and workers’ compensation if you have employees)\n\nOpening a business bank account\n\nObtaining the proper licenses\n\nIn addition to a business license, which you can get through your local municipality, you may need some specialized licenses from the FCC, which can be highly competitive. At the time of this writing, they’re only taking applications during a licensing window. You can keep checking back on the FCC’s website to find out when the window is open, but it varies year-to-year. During the window, you can file an application online.\n\nInternet radio stations don’t need an FCC license, but all stations that play copyrighted music do need to obtain a license from a performance rights organization (PRO) such as BMI, ASCAP, and SESAC. Many PROs offer specific licenses based on the type of station (i.e. internet radio vs. terrestrial), but many stations opt for a blanket license that isn’t limited to one PRO.\n\n5. Determine your business costs\n\nThe cost of launching a radio station largely depends on the type of station. The biggest startup expenses come from engineering fees (which can range from $500 to $3,000 to get on air), studio equipment (from $5,000 to more than $100,000), and transmitting equipment. This can include an Emergency Alert System (EAS) and an FCC-accepted LPFM transmitter. These generally cost around $3,000 and $3,500, respectively.\n\nOverall, internet radio stations often have the lowest cost, whereas you can launch a low-power FM (LPFM) radio station for under $15,000 upfront. Month-to-month, you may be able to get by with just under $1,000 of expenses. It all depends on the type of station you choose.\n\nCommercial radio stations are the costliest, but most radio stations have the same recurring fees as any industry: rent, utilities, and wages. To determine your business costs, add up your one-time expenses and your recurring costs. Don’t forget to factor in things like taxes and license fees, though an LPFM license application is free.\n\nHow do you fund your startup costs?\n\nDepending on the business model, launching a radio station may be cheap enough that business owners can forgo a loan. In this case, a low- or no-APR business credit card is an option. If your costs exceed a few thousand dollars, you may also want to look into a small business loan, which you can obtain through a bank or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Remember that these carry interest.\n\nYou can also search for a grant. The SBA can help you find qualifying grants, which can provide a helpful injection of cash. If all else fails, you can reach out to friends and family for financial backing, but that can put tension in your relationships if you fail to repay the money in a timely manner.\n\nNeed more information about figuring out startup costs? This helpful guide will walk you through business cost calculation and more.\n\n6. Purchase radio station equipment\n\nStarting an online radio station requires little more than basic recording and editing equipment, including broadcasting software and condenser microphones, but broadcast radio requires some extra tools. This includes a fully compliant EAS and radio transmitter that’s approved by the FCC. Depending on the scale of your operation, you may also need to construct a tower.\n\n7. Market your radio station\n\nMarketing is a crucial step for any business, particularly a radio business. You may want to develop a comprehensive social media plan that includes your radio show hosts and guests for extra reach.\n\nIf you’re running an online radio station that requires members to subscribe, you may want to offer a trial membership. Some radio stations choose to enact a solid SEO campaign that includes publishing blogs about breaking political or celebrity news if they’re covering current events.\n\nAll radio stations have to choose the method that their broadcasts are delivered — whether it’s through terrestrial airwaves, satellite radio, or the internet — but the content has an unlimited number of options. Many stations cover local news and politics, while others play different genres of music, like rock, pop, classical, or jazz. Some radio stations even offer educational content. The sky’s the limit."
