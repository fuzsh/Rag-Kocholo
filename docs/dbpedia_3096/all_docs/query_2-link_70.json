        "text": "The values that underpin good journalism, the need of citizens for reliable and abundant information, and the importance of such information for a healthy society and a robust democracy: these are perennial, and provide compass-bearings for anyone trying to make sense of current changes across the media landscape.\n\nThis article explores the cultural dynamics of the microradio movement in the USA. Viewed in the wider context of political economy and participatory democracy, I argue that the microradio movement is an expression of the felt need of local populations to reconnect with the civic and cultural life of their communities. Furthermore, I contend that the unique features of the medium – its ubiquity, low-cost and low-tech credentials – make microradio particularly well suited to meet the needs of diverse urban neighborhoods and underserved rural communities alike. The article concludes that, in its efforts to reinvent radio as a vehicle of participatory democracy and a resource for community development, the microradio movement not only demonstrates the medium’s significance to our understanding of community, democracy and citizenship, but underscores the role media activism plays as an agent of progressive social change.\n\nThis policy paper published by the New America Foundation's Media Policy Initiative evaluates the quality or \"health\" of the Triangle region's information environment through a broad qualitative study of new and traditional institutions that provide news and information across four counties in the region. To guide our investigation, we have relied on the report of The Knight Commission on the Information Needs of Communities in a Democracy, Informing Communities: Sustaining Democracy in the Digital Age. The report offers a series of indicators for assessing three important elements of \"information health\": - availability of relevant and credible information to all Americans and their communities; - capacity of individuals to engage with information; and - individual engagement with information and the public life of the community. April 2011, Release 2.0\n\nThis chapter makes the case that a publicly-subsidized news media system is journalism’s last best hope. It opens with a comparative analysis showing how little Americans devote toward their public media system. Next, it traces the historical roots of this “American media exceptionalism”. Then it offers a historical analysis of American public media and begins offering a general survey of press subsidies around the world."
