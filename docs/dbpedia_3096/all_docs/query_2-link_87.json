        "text": "Catch Alice’s Restaurant on the 2023 radio dial. See our latest listening guide.\n\nThanksgiving is nearly upon us and for radio fanatics like myself, that means another year tracking the radio stations that play Arlo Guthrie’s seasonally appropriate “Alice’s Restaurant.” Especially with the strangeness of the last few years in light of COVID, nostalgia is likely a big reason that listeners seek out the radio to hear a familiar tune in times of stress. It might be something that reminds one of the past, whether remembering “Alice’s Restaurant” from back in the 60s or 70s or tapping into memories from Thanksgiving preparations or celebrations at relatives’ homes more recently.\n\nI’ve been documenting this radio ritual for many many years and was pleased to be able to speak to THE Alice in 2020 as part of our lead up to the muted 2020 holiday season. Be sure to listen to our Radio Survivor podcast conversation with Alice Brock, as it provides perspective on how Guthrie’s song came to be and why it has resonated with so many people.\n\n“Alice’s Restaurant” has been an on-air tradition for decades, with fans calling up stations to confirm that it will be airing again each year. Doing my research for this year’s list, I was struck by a post from one DJ who was saddened to not be presenting the song on the radio after more than 40 consecutive years, largely due to scheduling challenges with the broadcast of a football game. Earlier this week, longtime WCMF host Dave Kane-O wrote on Facebook,\n\n..I have received MANY an inquiry about bringing you to Alice’s Restaurant this year. I am humbled & flattered to no end, & I sincerely thank you. Alas, it does not look good for a broadcast this year, and I am sorry about that…Sooooooo, at the very least, I will post my personal greeting to you here on my Kane O FB page on Thursday about 12 Noon, and provide a link to listen to ‘Alice’s Restaurant’ for your enjoyment. I KNOW it’s not the same (what is anymore?!), and I was really hoping to be able to host it for the 42nd year in a row, but…nothing is forever. Except my sincere, ever-lovin’ appreciation for ALLA Y’all! So, you’ll have the ‘basic ingredients’ for our Thanksgiving tradition, just not in the same way you’re used to…\n\nThe P.S. to this story, is that DJ Dave Kane-O will be playing “Alice’s Restaurant” over Facebook Live instead. So, his WCMF and WRUR fans can tune in at 9am to continue their Thanksgiving listening tradition with their favorite DJ.\n\nHere’s wishing you a wonderful 2022 Thanksgiving celebration! If you are eager to tune in to a radio station to hear “Alice’s Restaurant” this year, take a look at the following options.
