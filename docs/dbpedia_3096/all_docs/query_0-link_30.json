        "text": "Kelly Clarkson was over the moon about getting to perform “Crazy on You” with Heart when the band appeared on her talk show The Kelly Clarkson Show.\n\nThe truncated rendition of the tune can be seen below. Before the performance, Ann Wilson shared how “Crazy on You” was the first song she ever sang in a recording studio, which blew Clarkson’s mind.\n\nWilson noted, “I didn’t have a bunch of technique or anything yet, but I definitely felt how to say certain words, how to jump in early sometimes, how to ‘blue note’ things… just feel that kind of stuff.”\n\nHeart, of course, recently kicked off their latest batch of tour dates, which run through out the rest of 2024.
