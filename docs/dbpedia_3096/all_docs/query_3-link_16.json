        "text": "Its headquarters are in relatively bucolic Hawthorne, N.Y., and its revenues are still pint-sized by media company standards, $14.2 million in 1998. Still, Big City Radio Inc. has managed to live up to both its far-reaching name, as well as the collection of skyscrapers in its logo.\n\nIn the New York metropolitan region, Big City owns four stations -- WWXY-FM in Hampton Bays, N.Y., WWYY-FM in Hackettstown, WWZY-FM in Long Branch, and WYNY-FM in Hawthorne, N.Y., but the company has combined those small stations, which collectively broadcast as WYNY-FM, or ''New Country Y-107.''\n\nAccording to the company, WYNY now has listeners not only in New York City, but also within about a 100-mile radius of Manhattan, from Dutchess County in the north and the Pocono Mountains in the West, to the eastern tip of Long Island, and along parts of the New Jersey and Connecticut coast. The company says it has 500,000 listeners and is the only country station that covers the metropolitan area.\n\nFounded in 1994 by two veterans of the broadcasting industry, Stuart Subotnick and Michael Kakoyiannis, their goal for the company was to create a unique form of alchemy by buying small, low-cost and relatively low-power suburban stations. Their plan was to then combine the stations into more powerful metropolitan entities that would not only sound like big city radio stations, but that would also attract more listeners, and therefore advertisers.\n\nFive years later, Big City Radio is on its way to doing that, although its game plan has not always unfolded as speedily as its executives would have liked. And the company has yet to post an annual profit. Still, industry experts say that Big City, whose revenue grew 36 percent in 1998, has already managed to carve a strong niche within the highly competitive radio industry.\n\nBig City owes some of its success to the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, which not only greatly increased the number of radio stations a company could own, but also prompted a huge consolidation within the industry. The company has also developed technology for synchronizing the signals of two or more stations on the same frequency or adjacent frequency, and then simultaneously broadcasting the programming on those stations to get broad metropolitan coverage. Within any given area, Big City tries to reach at least 90 percent of the radio listening audience, which the company said it does in New York.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
