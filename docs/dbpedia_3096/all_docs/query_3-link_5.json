        "text": "While the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) is still pursuing its goal of getting Congress to pass the “AM Radio in Every Vehicle Act*,” the number of AM radio stations on-the-air continues to shrink.\n\nHow Many Radio Stations Are There?\n\nInside Radio published the latest FCC radio station count and the number of AM radio stations on-the-air continues to shrink.\n\nIn 1968, I passed my 3rd Class Radiotelephone FCC License, Broadcast endorsed, it was also the year that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began publishing its Broadcast Station Totals reports.\n\nAt that time the FCC said that 4,236 AM radio stations and 2,306 FM radio stations were on the air.\n\nIn December 1990, the next report the FCC published became available showing 4,987 AM radio stations and 5,832 full power FM radio stations were now on the air; plus, another 1,866 FM translator/boosters.\n\nIt’s worthy to note that the general public cannot tell the difference between a:\n\nFull power FM\n\nFM booster\n\nFM translator signal\n\nas to the FM listener they all are received on a standard AM/FM receiver. Only broadcasters, broadcast engineers and the FCC are concerned about such distinctions.\n\nSo, in just the first two decades of my radio career, FM signals outnumbered AM signals by 2,711.\n\nTelecommunications Act of 1996\n\nOn February 8, 1996, President William Jefferson Clinton signed into law what is commonly referred to as “The Telcom Act of 96.” The intent of the legislation was to allow more companies to operate in the communications space, but what actually happened was a flurry of mergers and acquisitions as corporate media giants bought out small, local broadcasters.\n\nThe FCC reported that as of February 29, 1996 there were:\n\n4,906 AM stations\n\n7,151 FM stations\n\n2,527 FM translators/boosters on-the-air\n\nalmost two FM signals beating the airwaves to every AM signal.\n\nA year after the Telcom Act of 96, the number of AM signals began its decline to:\n\n4,840 (a loss of 66 AM signals in one year)\n\nfull power FM signals increased to 7,295 (up 144 FM signals)\n\nFM translator/booster signals grew to 2,744 (up 217 FM signals)\n\nWhile AM radio signals were signing off, FM radio signals were growing by an additional 361.\n\nTen Years After Passage of the Telcom Act of 96\n\nOn March 31, 2006, ten years after the Telcom Act became law, and the consolidation of the radio industry began, the FCC Broadcast Station Totals report listed:\n\n4,759 AM signals\n\n8,989 full power FM signals\n\n4,049 FM translator/booster signals\n\nand now something new began appearing, Low Power FM signals (LPFM) which numbered 712, meaning the radio listening consumer could now access 13,750 FM signals versus 4,759 AM signals.\n\nWall Street investors were clearly showing more interest in FM signals than AM signals as their money poured into the radio industry.\n\nTwenty Years After Passage of the Telcom Act of 96\n\nTwenty years after President Clinton signed the Telcom Act and consolidation continued squeezing out the mom and pop broadcasters, the FCC Broadcast Station Totals report listed:\n\n4,680 AM signals (down 307 signals from the day I began my broadcast career)\n\n10,811 full power FM signals\n\n6,582 FM translator/booster signals\n\n1,516 LPFM signals\n\nAM signals totaled 4,680 and FM signals totaled 18,908.\n\nRadio Broadcast Signals 2024\n\nWhich brings us to the present day report, March 31, 2024. The FCC Broadcast Station Totals report now lists:\n\n4,427 AM signals\n\n10,983 full power FM signals\n\n8,913 FM translator/booster signals\n\n1,960 LPFM signals\n\nRemember, the radio listening public DOES NOT distinguish between the different classifications of FM signals, as they all appear on the same FM radio receiver they are using.\n\nTo the radio listener, they have\n\n4,427 AM signals compared to 21,856 FM signals\n\nthey can access. Almost 5 times as many FM signals as AM signals, and each year we witness those AM signals either reducing their power or just signing off-the-air and turning in their FCC broadcast license.\n\nRadio Dominates in Vehicles\n\nThe latest research from Quu ( www.quureport.com ) shows that in 2023 model vehicles:\n\n100% of them have an FM radio\n\n98% of them have an AM radio\n\n98% of them have Android Audio\n\n98% of them have Apple CarPlay\n\n92% have SiriusXM\n\n70% have HD Radio\n\nWhat surprised me about this research report, was that this was the first time I’ve ever seen separate AM and FM numbers listed. All reporting about radio usage should list AM and FM listening separately. I feel it is disingenuous to give the false impression that AM and FM broadcast signals contribute equally when that’s clearly NOT the case.\n\nHaving access to an audio service does not equate to usage.\n\nFred Jacobs in his TechSurvey 2023 for example, revealed how HD Radio was only listened to by 16% and SiriusXM was only listened to by 28%, which shows that despite their high availability numbers in vehicle dashboards, usage is still low. Unfortunately, AM/FM is never broken apart, but listed together so can they can garner 86% of the listening.\n\nI’m thinking that both HD radio and SiriusXM usage might eclipse AM radio listening, if we were allowed to see AM and FM usage shown separately.\n\nVehicles On The Road in America Today\n\nAccording to S&P Global Mobility, there are 284 million vehicles on our roadways and the average age of them continues to rise to a new record of 12.5 years. About 23% of all passenger cars now are 20 years or older with the bulk of them made between 2015 and 2019.\n\nBy 2050, when electric vehicles are projected to make up 60% of new sales, the majority of vehicles on America’s highways will still be powered by gasoline, because most vehicles today last twenty years meaning AM radio will still be in most cars, but the bigger question is how many AM radio stations will still be on-the-air.\n\nRadio Needs To Look Forward\n\nIn ten to twenty years, AM radio will be at best a niche way to listen to audio.\n\nWhere the radio industry and the National Association of Broadcasters should be focusing their time is keeping FM radio viable, in all vehicles and FREE!\n\nSadly, the FM band is becoming overcrowded with signals and this, I believe, needs to be seriously addressed.\n\nFinally, I would like to believe, as does Scott Shannon, that radio can still succeed in the 21st Century if it will just be “authentic, local, magical, and deliver an audio product with passion.” Or as radio programming consultant and author Valerie Geller puts it:\n\nGreat radio is interesting people communicating with listeners\n\nby telling the truth, making it matter and never being boring.\n\nI’ve been thinking about these two forms of audio for some time now. With each new article published about streaming, we see how more and more people are listening to music in this way. The smart speaker has certainly contributed to the growth of music listening via streams, and the smart speaker growth is exploding.\n\nI know with my own experience by getting my first smart speaker as a gift, to now owning three of them, how it’s totally changed how I listen to music.\n\nAnd then there’s podcasting, a way for the spoken word to be communicated.\n\nRadio versus Streaming & Podcasting\n\nRadio for most of my life was a way to hear both music and the spoken word. It was curated and delivered in fresh and exciting ways by a variety of radio stations across the country.\n\nUnfortunately, radio delivered programming on its timetable, not the listeners.\n\nAs VCRs came into the television world, I remember hearing, why isn’t there a device like that for radio? There actually was, I owned one, but it never really caught on like the video devices did.\n\nThe VCRs and DVRs changed how people consumed their television programs, and essentially did away with the concept of “Must See TV” turning it into “must record TV.”\n\nNetflix\n\nThen along comes Netflix, and the concept of On Demand TV viewing was born.\n\nOne might argue that Blockbuster started it with video rentals, but it still really didn’t impact American viewing habits like streaming video did.\n\nAgain, Netflix disrupted people’s viewing habits when it would release an entire season of a TV series all at once. Gone was the need to come back week-after-week to see a program. Now, a new type of TV consumption was created, the binge-watch.\n\nBroadcast versus Streaming\n\nWhat’s really changed in our consumption of TV and radio is our ability to control what we see and hear, and when we want to see and hear it. In other words, On Demand is the media consumption process of the 21st Century.\n\nI stream 100% of my television viewing. I can watch a program live, or start the show from the beginning if I arrive late, or just view it whenever I want, at another time through On Demand viewing.\n\nStreaming TV has trained us, and now the smart speaker is taking our new media consumption habit and making audio listening just as easy to consume in this manner.\n\nAlexa is ready, willing and able to play any genre of music that I want to hear, on a moment’s notice. She has more song selections than my own personal CD library and it’s so much easier to ask Alexa to play a song for me than try and find the CD that a song is on, and then load it into my CD player.\n\nPodcasts\n\nComplete honesty here, I’m not a fan of podcasts. I don’t know why, I’m just not. The only one I ever listened to in its entirety was the first season of the podcast Serial, and that was mainly due to a long 13-hour car drive, and my ability to download all the episodes onto my iPod to play in my car.\n\nHowever, I do know that younger folks are really getting into podcasts and this segment will only grow as the spoken word genre finds a way to promote its wares.\n\nThe Looming Audio Battle\n\nWhat I do see on the horizon is radio being drawn and quartered by streaming audio for music, and podcast audio for the spoken word. Both types of audio programming are easily called up via smart speakers and available On Demand.\n\nCurated programming, as has been the staple of broadcast radio, will be challenged to compete.\n\nProfessional Radio & Amateur Radio\n\nRadio won’t die, it has a future, but I see it bifurcating in the following ways:\n\nThere will be professional broadcasters and amateur broadcasters.\n\nI see the future of radio looking something like the difference between professional and amateur theater. For example, the difference between Broadway and community theater; where the former are professional paid actors, and the latter is made up of talented volunteer locals with an insatiable love of theater.\n\nThe advent of low power FM radio stations is the first toe-in-the-water that points in this direction for amateur radio personalities who volunteer their time and energy.\n\nSome of these volunteers will come from the ranks of retired or “dislocated” professional radio personalities and some will be members of the community that always thought it would be fun to be on-the-air.\n\nWhat seems to be disappearing are local radio stations in the middle, ones that used to be ad-supported by local businesses, who now find themselves displaced by big box stores and online shopping.\n\nThe newspaper industry is the canary in the coal shaft for ad-supported media. Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charles Munger points out that, “Technological change is destroying the daily newspapers in America. The revenue goes away and the expenses remain and they’re all dying.” However, Munger does feel that papers like The Wall Street Journal and New York Times will most likely survive.\n\nNewspapers have been cutting staff like crazy but it’s done little to turn things around. Radio is following in print industry’s footsteps as “employee dislocations” are occurring at all the major broadcasting companies.\n\nDoes any of this make sense to you?\n\nI’d love to hear what your thoughts are.\n\nPlease post your thoughts on comments section of this blog article, so that others may read them and hear different opinions.\n\nI was reviewing the last FCC report about the number of broadcast stations in America as of December 31, 2018 and in my head I found myself singing a parody of the Bellamy Brothers song, “Too much is not enough.” Only my version was “too much is way too much.”\n\nFM Signals Continue to Proliferate\n\nMy editor at Radio World, Emily Reigart, recently wrote about how the total number of broadcast stations (radio & TV) grew in the past year by 3,150 stations, it would appear to not be an industry in decline. Unfortunately, while TV and FM stations increased, the number of AM radio stations continues to shrink.\n\nWhich again reminded me of that Bellamy Brothers song where they sang “I’m getting weaker, as the day goes by.”\n\nHow Much is Too Much\n\nBack in the 1950s through the 1970s, John B. Calhoun, an American ethologist and behavioral researcher, studied what happens when an environment gets overcrowded. In Mr. Calhoun’s case, he studied what happens when you keep adding rats to a defined space. It was to learn about population density and its effects on behavior. Calhoun predicted that what he witnessed with his rats foretold of a grim future for the human race.\n\nI believe much as what Everett Rodgers would learn in studying the adoption of new innovations of Iowa corn farmers that produced his famous Innovation Adoption Curve, that these things have universal applications and impact all areas of our lives.\n\nOverpopulation is overpopulation.\n\nMatters not whether we’re talking rats, people or radio stations.\n\nIn more recent times, researchers felt that Calhoun’s experiments didn’t so much predict the effects of overpopulation as much as the moral decay that arises with too much social interaction. Did he foretell of today’s internet connected world?\n\nFM Signals\n\nBreaking down the FCC’s latest report for just radio stations, we see that there are now 4,619 AM radio stations on the air. That’s 20 fewer AM radio stations than a year ago and 167 fewer than a decade ago. This is a trend that shows no sign of changing. That’s why I wrote, that “like coal, AM radio ain’t coming back.”\n\nOn the FM side, there were 25 more commercial and educational FM radio stations than a year ago, and compared to 2008, there were 1,422 additional FM radio stations added.\n\nTranslators & Low Power FM\n\nWhere things get really messy is the addition of translators and low power FM radio stations.\n\nFor those not fully versed in these two forms of broadcasting, they are basically the same, in that both occupy space on the FM radio band. The difference is that translators rebroadcast another signal, be it an AM, FM or HD broadcast, and low power FM radio stations originate their programs. Low power FM radio stations are non-commercial operations and limited to a maximum power of 100-watts. (Note: commercial and educational FM stations can have a maximum power of 100,000-watts) Translators or boosters are limited to a maximum power of 250-watts but it’s not surprising to find many operating at a lot less power due to other factors involved.\n\nWhen we look at the number of these two additional classes of FM broadcasters, we find another 10,124 FM radio stations bringing the total number of FM signals on-the-air in America today to 21,013 FM radio stations. Over four and half times as many FM signals as AM signals.\n\nInversion Layers\n\nNow while studies are done to determine what power and location an FM station can be located to prevent it interfering with another FM radio station on the same or adjacent frequency, all of these studies are done in a perfect world. By that I mean, one in which weather is behaving.\n\nHowever, having operated radio stations along the Jersey shore for decades, I know that vertical layering of moisture content and temperature in the atmosphere (inversion layers) can cause an FM signal to travel hundreds or thousands of miles further than normal.\n\nThese weather conditions can affect radio signals from several hours to several days.\n\nThis weather phenomenon is called anomalous propagation and is usually likely to occur when weather conditions are hot and dry.\n\nWith the planet’s climate changing, expect to see even more, less than “normal” weather conditions going forward and therefore even more interference.\n\nAutomobile FM Radio\n\nThe place radio still dominates, is in the car, though all electric cars are excluding AM radios due to electrical interference, in favor of FM radios with internet and blue tooth capabilities in what manufacturers call “dashboard entertainment systems.”\n\nI’ve traveled all over our great land this past year and what I find is, it is almost impossible to dial in an FM radio station and keep a clear, listenable signal for any great distance or period of time. It quickly turns into an interference situation with another FM radio station, either on the same frequency or an adjacent one.\n\nLess Is More\n\nThe radio industry would greatly benefit from fewer signals, with the power to fully cover the area they are licensed to serve, and regulated to insure that they are properly operated in the community of license’s interests, convenience, or necessity.\n\nThe FCC can’t abolish the laws of physics.\n\nThe advertising base to support local radio is finite.\n\nIn Sydney, Australia, a city with about 5-million people, there are 48-radio stations. In Los Angeles, California, a city with about 4-million people, there are 114-radio stations.\n\nThe value of a broadcast license was that it was a limited commodity, and as such being granted spectrum on the public’s airwaves benefitted the community, the advertisers, the listeners and the broadcasters.\n\nThe Infinite Dial\n\nThe internet has created an infinite radio dial and has challenged the value of an FCC broadcast license.\n\nThe FCC’s inability to protect the AM spectrum from the myriad of electrical devices that produce an ever increasing noise floor has doomed the future of the senior band as it closes in on a century of service.\n\nUnless something is done, I fear the FM band will suffer a similar fate.\n\nIn many ways, it already is.\n\nThat was the subject of an email I received from a reader of my blog recently. The writer went on to eloquently state why he felt the way he did, even citing articles on the topic. He had my interest and I asked him if we could speak on the phone.\n\nThe BIG Question\n\nThis reader’s (who asked to be kept anonymous) big question was “What can radio do that other media can’t?”\n\nAnd it’s a very good question.\n\nIn 2017 when many are using the internet for things that only radio could provide in the past, is radio’s future being the poor man’s smartphone, tablet or iPod when it could be more?\n\n“NPR and SiriusXM, in addition to the new exploding podcast marketplace, have had no trouble creating personalities and programs,” but my reader writes “why does FM commercial radio continue to stick with playing the hits, past and present, at the expense of personalities, thinking it will make them money when the biggest radio companies have trouble paying off debts on the stations they seem to have paid too much for?”\n\nWell it was a well-known fact all of my radio life that you make money in radio at the time you buy a radio station. Buying it right makes all the difference. And those big radio companies went on a buying spree using other people’s money (Wall Street) and it’s much like student loan debt, no one worries how much debt they’ve accumulated until they are asked to replay it.\n\nIs Local Radio Local Anymore?\n\nMy reader quotes Westwood One’s Chief Insights Officer Pierre Bouvard from an AdExchanger interview as saying “A local radio station gives you traffic, sports, weather, great music, funny DJs and talks about your town,” he said. “Spotify has these robotic music playlists, which are awesome, but there’s no one telling you what happened at the Giants game last night.”\n\nMy reader says Pierre (who was my first Arbitron representative back in the 80s) makes a good point, but wonders if Pierre ever took the time to hear what passes for much of local radio these days. My reader feels that much of today’s FM radio stations do a combination of great music and robotic, Spotify-ish playlists, and relatively little in the way of “traffic, sports, weather…funny DJs and talk about your town” stuff.\n\nSadly, I’ve heard similar things said at radio meetings where the person starts off by saying “now don’t quote me on this, but…”\n\nTELCOM Act of 1996\n\nIt was President Bill Clinton who signed the Telcom Act of 1996. That act was supposed to bring competition to the phone and cable television industries thereby lowering costs of each to the consumer. While that didn’t happen quickly (some might wonder if it ever did) it did cause the quick consolidation of the radio and TV industries. We went from a country where the largest radio operator could own 12AM-12FM-12TV stations to virtually whatever their pocketbook could afford. And with Wall Street Bankers waiting in the wings, what a company could afford was a lot.\n\nLow Power FM & Translators\n\nFor the non-radio folks who read this blog, Low Power FM signals and Translator signals are virtually the same thing, with the exception being that Low Power FM stations originate programming and translators don’t. Both are received over the air on the FM radio dial. Both have increased the number of FM signals on-the-air in America today.\n\nThe latest FCC (Federal Communications Commission) report as of the end of December 2016 shows that there were 4,669 AM radio stations on the air in America. Over on the FM dial, 16,783 signals now beat the airwaves (FM, FM educational, translators and low power FM).\n\nTo put things in perspective, at a time in America’s radio history when the number of FM signals equaled the number of AM signals on the air, 75% of all radio listening was to FM. So you can only imagine what it’s like today.\n\n93% of Americans 12+ are reached weekly by AM/FM radio says Nielsen.\n\nSo while the Telcom Act of 96 caused radio to consolidate under fewer owners who own more stations, adding to the signal overload was the advent of low power FM and translator signals. So much to program and no one home to do the work.\n\nEnter computers, voice tracking, and syndication. This is same computer technology that is employed by Pandora, Spotify, Radio Tunes, SoundCloud and many others.\n\nWhen TV Challenged Radio\n\nIn 1952 TV was born again. It was birthed just before World War II but the war years put broadcast radio/TV development on hold. After the war ended, things began to ramp up quickly for TV.\n\nIn 1953, Elmo Ellis was hired to fix 750AM – WSB in Atlanta. Ellis would write about “Removing the Rust from Radio Programming” for Broadcasting/Telecasting (now called Broadcasting and Cable magazine).\n\nOne of the points Mr. Ellis made was that a stack of records and a turntable do not a radio station make, though many broadcasters persisted in that very belief.\n\nIt was the very same philosophy I employed when I launched a “Music of YOUR Life” radio station. I felt that to be successful, you needed more than just Al Ham’s music list, you needed the personalities that complimented the music.\n\nBoth my reader and I are in complete agreement in that a radio station is more than just a song list.\n\nLess Is More\n\nThe problem today is that with the “land rush” by broadcasters to own as many signals as they can, we have seen our country’s biggest broadcasters put themselves into a debt situation they cannot get out of and smaller broadcasters have signals and streams to manage but not the revenues to properly execute them.\n\nIf we go back to the beginning of broadcasting in America, we see that the FRC (Federal Radio Commission) that predated the current FCC felt that quality over quantity of radio stations should be the rule of measure. By limiting the number of stations, the FRC was attempting to insure the content of those stations on the air would be of the highest quality and also by limiting the number of stations; the advertising revenue that is the life blood of free over-the-air radio could be sustained.\n\nWhat Can Radio Do That Other Media Can’t?\n\nThis brings me back to the question my reader originally posed and asked me to answer.\n\nBut before I do, I’m going throw that question out to my other readers – to date over 80,000 from all over the world – to weigh in with their thoughts.\n\nWhat do you feel radio can do that other media can’t?\n\nIs any radio station you know of doing it right now?\n\nIs this a sustainable future for over-the-air radio?\n\nI’m looking forward to reading your thoughts.\n\nIn 1994, Dan O’Day was holding one of his famous “PD Grad Schools” in Dallas, Texas. One of the speakers he invited that day – and whose presentation was recorded by “Radio’s Best Friend” Art Vuolo – was a young Randy Michaels. Dan O’Day still sells this video, now on DVD, and labels it “The best radio video ever.” I would agree.\n\nThe video is titled “Positioning Your Radio Station by Randy Michaels.” It addresses the explosion of new FM radio stations after the first round of radio deregulation brought us Docket 80-90. Then the LMA (Local Marketing Agreement) was born. Randy tells the audience:\n\n“This was a fundamental change for the radio business. Just as TV was a fundamental change, duopoly fundamentally changed the radio business. This moved the radio business from being a franchise to being a commodity. McDonalds was once a franchise. Today burger fast-food restaurants are a commodity and we all know how that’s working for the ‘Golden Arches.’”\n\nOn May 24, 2004 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) held a “Broadcast Localism Hearing” in Rapid City, South Dakota. The president, general manager and co-owner of KLQP-FM licensed to Madison, Minnesota (population 1, 767) Maynard Meyer addressed the commission. He told them (I’ve edited his comments. The full text can be found here.):\n\n“Localism in radio is not dead, but it is in dire need of resuscitation in many areas. I have been involved in the radio business in announcing, sales, engineering and management for about 36 years, all of my experience is in communities of 5,000 people or less. We personally live in the communities we serve so we know the ‘issues,’ we work to address them in our programming and have been doing so for the past 21 years. “\n\n“A few years ago, many stations operated this way, but much of that has changed for a variety of reasons. I think the beginning of the end of local broadcast service started in the 1980s when the Federal Communications Commission approved Docket 80-90.”\n\nMr. Meyer went on to explain to the FCC how many communities that “on paper” had a local radio station actually found that the transmitter was being fed from another location tens of miles away. Mr. Meyer went on to say:\n\n“I don’t think this is the best way to promote local radio service. From what I have seen through my personal experience, as soon as a hometown studio is closed and relocated, the local service is relocated as well.”\n\nNow put another decade plus on the calendar and we find that the FCC has decided that adding even more FM radio stations would fix this problem of local radio service that operates in the public “interest, convenience and/or necessity” by issuing FM licenses for FM translators and Low Power FM radio stations.\n\nThe most recent BROADCAST STATION TOTALS AS OF MARCH 31, 2015 issued by the FCC shows that there are 4,702 AM commercial radio stations, 6,659 FM commercial radio stations and 4,081 FM educational radio stations on the air. But wait; there are also 6,312 FM translators & boosters on the air; plus, another 1,029 Low Power FM radio stations. That’s 22,873 radio stations! And they now compete with SiriusXM satellite radio and streaming audio from Pandora, Spotify, Radio Tunes etc.\n\nIf Randy was thinking back in 1994 “being a media company today is a really tough business” he was seeing just the tip of the broadcast iceberg.\n\nRandy’s prescription that day in Dallas was as prescient then as it is today; maybe even more so. He told the audience of program directors:\n\n“In a crowded media environment radio needs to super-serve its local community. Be everywhere, all the time. Miss a day, miss a lot. Radio’s BEST when it’s personal.”\n\n“What’s your station’s impact rating? Great radio stations are listener-focused.”\n\n“If you’re smart enough to win in today’s radio, you’re smart enough to have done something legitimate with your life. This is work. This is a real job. It’s the merger of art and science and you’ve got to have both.”\n\nI’m encouraged by my students who have big ideas about the future of radio and a desire to serve the communities they will be moving to and living in. I’m encouraged by some great radio broadcasters getting back into the business who are bringing back the fundamentals of great radio while extending that sense of purpose to the digital component that must be a part of today’s media company.\n\nThe pendulum is swinging back and it can’t get back here soon enough."
