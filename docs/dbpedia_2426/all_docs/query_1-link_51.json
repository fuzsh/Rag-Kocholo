        "text": "What books are on your night stand?\n\n“Haikus,” by Kobayashi Issa, that most earthborn and humble of the one-breath poets; “Collected Stories,” by Willa Cather; and, of course, “The Maneuver,” by Heimlich. Just in case I choke on popcorn in bed.\n\nWhat’s the last great book you read?\n\nI recently decided to reread every novel I was obliged to read in junior and senior high. Each time, I’ve found myself thinking, “Oh, so that’s what this was about!” The latest is a period piece: “1984.” It made me wistful for my youth, when the distant future was something I could barely envision, instead of what I wake up to each day. And yet I also felt the disturbing sensation that I’d been completely brought up to date on current events.\n\nAre there any classics that you only recently read for the first time?\n\n“Les Misérables.” I and the title were as one.\n\nDescribe your ideal reading experience (when, where, what, how).\n\nBlissfully snowbound near a low-burning fire, adrift in any book where a character intones: “But that means the killer must be one of us.”\n\nWhat’s your favorite book no one else has heard of?\n\nAn 1873 edition of Dickens’s famously uncompleted “The Mystery of Edwin Drood” — completed by Mr. Dickens after his death (!) via the spirit-pen of a shameless medium named Thomas P. James of Brattleboro, Vt. This enterprising scoundrel even announces Mr. Dickens’s next novel: “The Life and Adventures of Bockley Wickleheap.”\n\nWhich writers — novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets — working today do you admire most?\n\nFar too many to list here, many being close friends unless I omitted one in which case they would no longer be. (Phew, that was close.) So I refuse to answer on the grounds of my property or anywhere else for that matter.\n\nBesides books, you’ve also written music — including the hit song “Escape (The Pina Colada Song)” and the Broadway musical “The Mystery of Edwin Drood.” Who are your favorite musician-writers?\n\nI think all good writers are musicians, rendering the sharps, flats, squeaks and clams of their characters in a score all their own — so much so that I find it impossible to read a book while music is playing. The resulting cacophony interferes with the author’s rhythms and rests, like listening to Beethoven in one ear and “Roll Over Beethoven” in the other. So I appreciate the riffs of Dorothy Parker and Charlie Parker, Agatha Christie and June Christy, Madeline Miller and Glenn Miller, Zadie Smith and Bessie Smith.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
