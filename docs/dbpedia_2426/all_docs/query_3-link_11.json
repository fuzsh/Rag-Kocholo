Our King they courted, & our Merchants aw'd.\n\n2.\n\nTrade, which like bloud should circularly flow, Stop'd in their Channels, found its freedom lost: Thither the wealth of all the world did go, And seem'd but shipwrack'd on so base a Coast.\n\ndescription Page 2\n\n3.\n\nFor them alone the Heav'ns had kindly heat, In Ea••tern Quarries ripening precious Dew: For them the Idumaean Balm did sweat, A••d in hot Ceilon Spicy Forrests grew.\n\n4.\n\nThe Sun but seem'd the Lab'rer of their Year; Each wexing Moon suppli'd her watry store, To swell those Tides, which from the Line did bear Their brim-full Vessels to the Belg'an shore.\n\n5.\n\nThus mighty in her Ships, stood Carthage long, And swept the riches of the world from far; Yet stoop'd to Rome, less wealthy, but more strong: And this may prove our second Punick War.\n\n6.\n\nWhat peace can be where both to one pretend? (But they more diligent, and we more strong) Or if a peace, it soon must have an end For they would grow too pow'rful were it long.\n\ndescription Page 3\n\n7.\n\nBehold two Nations then, ingag'd so far, That each seav'n years the fit must shake each Land Where France will side to weaken us by War, Who onely can his vast designs withstand.\n\n8.\n\nSee how he feeds th' Iberian with delays, To render us his timely friendship vain; And, while his secret Soul on Flanders preys, He rocks the Cradle of the Babe of Spain.\n\n9.\n\nSuch deep designs of Empire does he lay, O're them whose cause he seems to take in hand. And, prudently, would make them Lords at Sea, To whom with ease he can give Laws by Land.\n\n10.\n\nThis saw our King; and long within his breast His pensive counsels ballanc'd too and fro; He griev'd the Land he freed should be oppress'd, And he less for it then Usurpers do.\n\ndescription Page 4\n\n11.\n\nHis gen'rous mind the fair Idea's drew Of Fame and Honour which in dangers lay; Where wealth, like fruit an precipices, grew, Not to be gather'd but by Birds of prey.\n\n12.\n\nThe loss and gain each fatally were great; And still his Subjects call'd aloud for war: But peaceful Kings o'r martial people set, Each others poize and counter-ballance are.\n\n13.\n\nHe, first, survey'd the charge with careful eyes, Which none but mighty Monarchs could main∣tain; Yet judg'd, like vapours that from Limbecks rise, It would in richer showers descend again.\n\n14.\n\nAt length resolv'd t'assert the watry Ball, He in himself did whole Armado's bring: Him, aged Sea-men might their Master call, And choose for General were he not their King.\n\ndescription Page 5\n\n15.\n\nIt seems as every Ship their Sovereign knows, His awful summons they so soon obey; So here the skaly Herd when Proteus blows, And so to pasture follow through the Sea.\n\n16.\n\nTo see this Fleet upon the Ocean move Angels drew wide the Curtains of the skies: And Heav'n, as if their wanted Lights above, For Tapers made two glareing Comets rise.\n\n17.\n\nWhether they unctuous Exhalations are, Fir'd by the Sun, or seeming so alone, Or each some more remote and slippery Star, Which looses footing when to Mortals shown.\n\n18.\n\nOr one that bright companion of the Sun, Whose glorious aspect seal'd our new-born King; And now a round of greater years begun, New influence from his walks of light did bring.\n\ndescription Page 6\n\n19.\n\nVictorious York did, first, with fam'd success, To his known valour make the Dutch give place: Thus Heav'n our Monarch's fortune did confess, Beginning conquest from his Royal Race.\n\n20.\n\nBut since it was decreed, Auspicious King, In Britain's right that thou should'st wed the Main, Heav'n, as a gage, would cast some precious thing And therefore doom'd that Lawson should be slain.\n\n21.\n\nLawson amongst the formost met his fate, Whom Sea-green Syrens from the Rocks lament: Thus as an off'ring for the Grecian State, He first was kill'd who first to Battel went.\n\n22.\n\nTheir Chief blown up, in air, not waves expir'd, To which his pride presum'd to give the Law: The Dutch confess'd Heav'n present, and retir'd, And all was Britain the wide Ocean saw.\n\ndescription Page 7\n\n23.\n\nTo nearest Ports their shatter'd Ships repair, Where by our dreadful Canon they lay aw'd: So reverently men quit the open air When thunder speaks the angry Gods abroad.\n\n24.\n\nAnd now approach'd their Fleet from India, fraught With all the riches of the rising Sun: And precious Sand from Southern Climates brought, (The fatal Regions where the War begun.)\n\n25.\n\nLike hunted Castors, conscious of their store, Their way-laid wealth to Norway's coasts they bring: There first the North's cold bosome Spices bore, And Winter brooded on the Eastern Spring.\n\n26.\n\nBy the rich scent we found our perfum'd prey, Which flanck'd with Rocks did close in covert lie: And round about their murdering Canon lay, At once to threaten and invi••e the eye.\n\ndescription Page 8\n\n27.\n\nFie••cer then Canon, and then Rocks more hard, The English undertook th'unequal War: Seven Ships alone, by which the Port is barr••d, Besiege the Indies, and all Denmark dare.\n\n28.\n\nThese fight like Husbands, but like Lovers those: These fain would keep, and those more fain enjoy▪ And to such height their frantick passion grows, That what both love, both hazard to destroy.\n\n29.\n\nAmidst whole heaps of Spices lights a Ball, And now their Odours arm'd against them flie: Some preciously by shatter'd Porc'lain fall, And some by Aromatick splinters die.\n\n30.\n\nAn though by Tempests of the prize bere••t, In Heavens inclemency some ease we find: Our foes we vanquish'd by our valour left, And onely yielded to the Seas and Wind.\n\ndescription Page 9\n\n31.\n\nNor wholly lost we so deserv'd a prey; For storms, repenting, part of it restor'd: Which, as a tribute from the Balthick Sea, The British Ocean sent her mighty Lord.\n\n32.\n\nGo, Mortals, now, and vex your selves in vain For wealth, which so uncertainly must come: When what was brought so far, and with such pain, Was onely kept to lose it neerer home.\n\n33.\n\nThe Son, who, twice three month's on th' Ocean tost, Prepar'd to tell what he had pass'd before, Now sees, in English Ships the Holland Coast, And Parents arms in vain stretch'd from the shore.\n\n34.\n\nThis carefull Husband had been long away, Whom his chast wife and little children mourn; Who on their fingers learn'd to tell the day On which their Father promis'd to return.\n\ndescription Page 10\n\n35.\n\nSuch are the proud designs of human kind, And so we suffer Shipwrack every where! Alas, what Port can such a Pilot find, Who in the night of Fate must blindly steer!\n\n36.\n\nThe undistinguish'd seeds of good and ill Heav'n, in his bosom, from our knowledge hides; And draws them in contempt of human skill, Which oft, for friends, mistaken foes provides.\n\n37.\n\nLet Munsters Prelate ever be accurst, In whom we seek the German faith in vain: Alas, that he should teach the English first That fraud and avarice in the Church could reign!\n\n38.\n\nHappy who never trust a Strangers will, Whose friendship's in his interest understood! Since money giv'n but tempts him to be ill When pow'r is too remote to make him good.\n\ndescription Page 11\n\n39.\n\n••ill now, alone the Mighty Nations strove: The rest, at gaze, without the Lists did stand: ••nd threatning France, plac'd like a painted ••ove, Kept idle thunder in his lifted hand.\n\n40.\n\nThat Eunuch Guardian of rich Holl•••••• trade, Who envies us what he wants 〈◊〉〈◊〉 enjoy! Whose noisefull valour does no foe invade, And weak assistance will his friends destroy.\n\n41.\n\nOffended that we fought without hi•• 〈◊〉〈◊〉, He takes this time his secret ha••e to show: Which Charles does with a mind so calm receive▪ As one that neither seeks, nor 〈◊〉〈◊〉 his foe.\n\n42.\n\nWith France, to aid the Dutch, the Danes unite: France as their Tyrant, Denmark as their Slave. But when with one three Nations joyn to fight, They silently confess that one more brave.\n\ndescription Page 12\n\n43.\n\nLewis had chas'd the English from his shore; But Charles the French as Subjects does invite. VVould Heav'n for each some Salomon restore, VVho, by their mercy, may decide their right\n\n44.\n\nVVere Subjects so but onely buy their choice, And not from Birth did forc'd Dominion take, Our Prince alone would have the publique voice▪ And all his Neighbours Realms would desarts make.\n\n45.\n\nHe without fear a dangerous VVar pursues, VVhich without rashness he began before. As Honour made him first the danger choose, So still he makes it good on virtues score.\n\n46.\n\nThe doubled charge his Subjects love supplies, VVho, in that bounty, to themselves are kind: So glad Egyptians see their Nilus rise, And in his plenty their abundance find.\n\ndescription Page 13\n\n47.\n\nWith equal pow'r he does two Chiefs create, Two such, as each seem'd worthiest when alone: ••ach able to sustain a Nations fate, Since both had found a greater in their own.\n\n48.\n\n••oth great in courage, Conduct and in Fame, Yet neither envious of the others praise. Their duty, faith, and int'rest too the same. ••ike mighty Partners equally they raise.\n\n49.\n\nThe Prince long time had courted Fortune's love, But once possess'd did absolutely reign; ••hus with their Amazons the Heroes strove, And conquer'd first those Beauties they would gain.\n\n50.\n\n••he Duke, beheld, like Scipio, with disdain That Carthage, which he ruin'd, rise once more: And shook aloft the Fasces of the Main, To fright those Slaves with what they felt be∣fore.\n\ndescription Page 14\n\n51.\n\nTogether to the watry Camp they haste, Whom Matrons passing, to their children sho•• Infants first vows for them to Heav'n are cast, And future people bless them as they go.\n\n52.\n\nWith them no riotous pomp, nor As••an train, T' infect a Navy with their gawdy fears: To make flow fights, and victories but vain; But war; severely, like it self, appears.\n\n53.\n\nDiffusive of themselves, where e'r they pass, They make that warmth in others they expect Their valour works like bodies on a glass, And does its Image on their men project.\n\n54.\n\nOur Fleet divides, and straight the Dutch appea•• In number, and a fam'd Commander, bold: The Narrow Seas can scarce their Navy bear, Or crowded Vessels can their Soldiers hold.\n\ndescription Page 15\n\n55.\n\nThe Duke, less numerous, but in courage more, On wings of all the winds to combat flies: His murdering Guns aloud defiance roar, And bloudy Crosses on his Flag-staffs rise.\n\n56.\n\nBoth furl their sails, and strip them for the fight, Their folded sheets dismiss the useless air: Th' Elean Plains could boast no nobler sight, When strugling Champions did their bodies bare.\n\n57.\n\nBorn each by other in a distant Line, The Sea-built Forts in distant order move: So vast the noise, as if not Fleets did joyn, But Lands unfix'd, and floating Nations, strove.\n\n58.\n\nNow pass'd, on either side they nimbly tack, Both strive to intercept and guide the wind: And, in its eye, more closely they come back To finish all the deaths they left behind.\n\ndescription Page 16\n\n59.\n\nOn high-rais'd Decks the haughty Belgians ride, Beneath whose shade our humble Fregats go: Such port the Elephant bears, and so defi'd By the Rhinocero's her unequal foe.\n\n60.\n\nAnd as the built, so different is the fight; Their mounting shot is on our sails design'd: Deep in their hulls our deadly bullets light, And through the yielding planks a passage find▪\n\n61.\n\nOur dreaded Admiral from far they threat, Whose batter'd rigging their whole wa•• receives▪ All bare, like some old Oak which tempests beat, He stands, and sees below his scatter'd leaves.\n\n62.\n\nHeroes of old, when wounded, shelter sought, But he, who meets all danger with disdain, Ev'n in their face his ship to Anchor brought, And Steeple high stood propt upon the Main.\n\ndescription Page 17\n\n63.\n\nAt this excess of courage, all amaz'd, The foremost of his foes a while withdraw. With such respect in enter'd Rome they gaz'd, Who on high Chairs the God-like Fathers saw.\n\n64.\n\nAnd now, as where Patroclus body lay, Here ••rojan Chiefs advanc'd, & there the Greek: Ours o••r the Duke their pious wings display, And theirs the noblest spoils of Britain seek.\n\n65.\n\nMean time, his busie Marriners he hasts; His shatter'd sails with rigging to restore: And willing Pines ascend his broken Masts, Whose lofty heads rise higher then before.\n\n66.\n\nStraight to the Dutch he turns his dreadful prow, More fierce th'important quarrel to decide. Like Swans, in long array his Vessels show, Whose creasts, advancing, do the waves divide.\n\ndescription Page 18\n\n67.\n\nThey charge, re-charge, and all along the Sea They drive, and squander the huge ••elgian Fleet. Berkley alone who neerest Danger lay, Did a like fate with lost Creusa meet.\n\n68.\n\nThe night comes on, we, eager to pursue The Combat stil, and they asham'd to leave: Till the last streaks of dying day withdrew, And doubtful Moon-light did our rage deceive.\n\n69.\n\nIn th'English Fleet each ship resounds with joy, And loud applause of their great Lead'rs fame. In fiery dreams the Dutch they still destroy, And, slumbring, smile at the imagin'd flame.\n\n70.\n\nNot so the Holland Fleet, who tir'd and done, Stretch'd on their decks like weary Oxen lie: Faint swea••s all down their mighty members run, (Vast bulks which little souls but ill supply.)\n\ndescription Page 19\n\n71.\n\nIn dreams they fearful precipices tread, Or, shipwrack'd, labour to some distant shore: Or in dark Churches walk among the dead: They wake with horrour, & dare sleep no more.\n\n72.\n\nThe morn they look on with unwilling eyes, Till, from their Main-top, joyful news they hear Of ships, which by their mould bring new supplies, And in their colours Belgian Lions bear.\n\n73.\n\nOur watchful General had discern'd, from far, This mighty succour which made glad the foe. He sigh'd, but, like a Father of the War, His face spake hope, while deep his sorrows flow.\n\n74.\n\nHis wounded men he first sends off to shore: (Never, till now, unwilling to obey.) They, not their wounds but want of strength deplore, And think them happy who with him can stay.\n\ndescription Page 20\n\n75.\n\nThen, to the rest, Rejoyce, (said he) to day In you the fortune of Great Britain lies: Among so brave a people you are they Whom Heav'n has chose to fight for such a Prize.\n\n76.\n\nIf number English courages could quell, We should at first have shun'd, not met our foes; Whose numerous sails the fearful onely tell: Courage from hearts, and not from numbers grows.\n\n77.\n\nHe said; nor needed more to say: with hast To their known stations chearfully they go: And all at once, disdaining to be last, Sollicite every gale to meet the foe.\n\n78.\n\nNor did th'incourag'd Belgians long delay, But, bold in others, not themselves, they stood: So thick, our Navy scarce could sheer their way, But seem'd to wander in a moving wood.\n\ndescription Page 21\n\n79.\n\nOur little Fleet was now ingag'd so far, That, like the Sword-fish in the Whale, they fought. The Combat onely seem'd a Civil War, Till through their bowels we our passage wrought.\n\n80.\n\nNever had valour, no not ours before, Done ought like this upon the Land or Main: Where not to be o'rcome was to do more Then all the Conquests former Kings did gain.\n\n81.\n\nThe mighty Ghosts of our great Harries rose, And armed Edwards look'd, with anxious eyes, To see this Fleet among unequal foes, By which fate promis'd them their Charls should rise.\n\n82.\n\nMean time the Belgians tack upon our Reer, And raking Chace-guns through our sterns they send: Close by, their Fire-ships, like Ia••kals, appear, Who on their Lions for the prey attend.\n\ndescription Page 22\n\n83.\n\nSilent in smoke of Canons they come on: (Such vapours once did fiery Cacus hide.) In these the height of pleas'd revenge is shown, Who burn contented by another's side.\n\n84.\n\nSometimes, from fighting Squadrons of each Fleet, (Deceiv'd themselves, or to preserve some friend) Two grapling Aetna's on the Ocean meet, And English fires with Belgian flames contend.\n\n85.\n\nNow, at each Tack, our little Fleet grows less; And, like maim'd fowl, swim lagging on the Main. Their greater loss their numbers scarce confess While they lose cheaper then the English gain.\n\n86.\n\nHave you not seen when, whistled from the fist, Some Falcon stoops at what her eye design'd, And, with her eagerness, the quarry miss'd, Straight flies at check, and clips it down the wind.\n\ndescription Page 23\n\n87.\n\nThe dastard Crow, that to the wood made wing, And sees the Groves no shelter can afford, With her loud Kaws her Craven kind does bring, Who, safe in numbers cuff the noble Bird.\n\n88.\n\nAmong the Dutch thus Albemarl did fare: He could not conquer, and disdain'd to flie. Past hope of safety, 'twas his latest care, Like falling Cesar, decently to die.\n\n89.\n\nYet pity did his manly spirit move To see those perish who so well had fought: And, generously, with his dispair he strove, Resolv'd to live till he their safety wrought.\n\n90.\n\nLet other Muses write his prosp'rous fate, Of conquer'd Nations tell, and Kings restor'd: But mine shall sing of his eclips'd estate, VVhich, like the Sun's, more wonders does afford.\n\ndescription Page 24\n\n91.\n\nHe drew his mighty Fregates all before, On which the foe his fruitless force employes: His weak ones deep into his Ree•• he bore, Remote from Guns as sick men are from noise.\n\n92.\n\nHis fiery Canon did their passage guide, And foll'wing smoke obscur'd them from the foe. Thus Israel safe from the Egyptia••'s pride, By flaming pillars, and by clouds did go.\n\n93.\n\nElsewhere the Belgian force we did defeat, But here our courages did theirs subdue: So Xenophon once led that fam'd retreat, Which first the Asian Empire overthrew.\n\n94.\n\nThe foe approach'd: and one, for his bold sin, Was sunk, (as he that touch'd the Ark was ••lain;) The wild waves master'd him, and suck'd him in, And smiling Eddies dimpled on the Main.\n\ndescription Page 25\n\n95.\n\nThis seen, the rest at awful distance stood; As if they had been there as servants set, To stay, or to go on, as he thought good, And not persue, but wait on his retreat.\n\n96.\n\nSo Lybian Huntsmen, on some sandy plain, From shady coverts rouz'd, the Lion chace: The Kingly beast roars out with loud disdain, And slowly moves, unknowing to give place.\n\n97.\n\nBut if some one approach to dare his force, He swings his tail, and swiftly turns him round: With one paw seizes on his trembling Horse, And with the other tears him to the ground.\n\n98.\n\nAmidst these toils succeeds the balmy night, Now hissing waters the quench'd guns restore; And weary waves, withdrawing from the fight, Lie lull'd and panting on the silent shore.\n\ndescription Page 26\n\n99.\n\nThe Moon shone clear on the becalmed floud, Where, while her beams like glittering silver play, Upon the Deck our careful General stood, And deeply mus'd on the succeeding day.\n\n100.\n\nThat happy Sun, said he, will rise again, Who twice victorious did our Navy see: And I alone must view him rise in vain, Without one ray of all his Star for me.\n\n101.\n\nYet, like an English Gen'ral will I die, And all the Ocean make my spatious grave. Women and Cowards on the Land may lie, The Sea's a Tomb that's proper for the brave.\n\n102.\n\nRestless he pass'd the remnants of the night, Till the fresh air proclaim'd the morning nigh, And burning ships, the Martyrs of the fight, With paler fires beheld the Eastern sky.\n\ndescription Page 27\n\n103.\n\nBut now, his Stores of Ammunition spent, His naked valour is his onely guard: Rare thunders are from his dumb Cannon sent, And solitary Guns are scarcely heard.\n\n104.\n\nThus far had Fortune pow'r, here forc'd to stay, Nor longer durst with vertue be at strife: This, as a Ransome Albemarl did pay For all the glories of so great a life.\n\n105.\n\nFor now brave Rupert from afar appears, Whose waving Streamers the glad General knows: With full spread Sails his eager Navy steers, And every Ship in swift proportion grows.\n\n106.\n\nThe anxious Prince had heard the Cannon long, And from that length of time dire Omens drew Of English over-match'd, and Dutch too strong, Who never fought three days but to pursue.\n\ndescription Page 28\n\n107.\n\nThen, as an Eagle, (who, with pious care, Was beating widely on the wing for prey) To her now silent Eiry does repair, And finds her callow Infants forc'd away.\n\n108.\n\nStung with her love she stoops upon the plain, The broken air loud whistling as she flies: She stops, and listens, and shoots forth again, And guides her pinions by her young ones cries.\n\n109.\n\nWith such kind passion hastes the Prince to fight, And spreads his flying canvass to the sound: Him, whom no danger, were he there, could fright, Now, absent, every little noise can wound.\n\n110.\n\nAs, in a drought, the thirsty creatures cry, And gape upon the gather'd clowds for rain, And first the Martlet meets it in the sky, And, with wet wings, joys all the feather'd train▪\n\ndescription Page 29\n\n111.\n\nWith such glad hearts did our dispairing men Salute th' appearance of the Princes Fleet▪ And each ambitiously would claim the Ken That with first eyes did distant safety meet.\n\n112.\n\nThe Dutch, who came like greedy Hinds before, To reap the harvest their ripe ears did yield, Now look like those, when rowling thunders roar, And sheets of Lightning blast the standing field.\n\n113.\n\nFull in the Princes passage, hills of sand And dang'rous flats in secret ambush lay, Where the false tides skim o'r the cover'd Land, And Sea-men with dissembled depths betray:\n\n114.\n\nThe wily Dutch, who, like fall'n Angels, fear'd This new Messiah's coming, there did wait, And round the verge their braving Vessels steer'd, To tempt his courage with so fair a bait.\n\ndescription Page 30\n\n115.\n\nBut he, unmov'd, contemns their idle threat, Secure of fame when ere he please to fight: His cold experience tempers all his heat, And inbred worth does boasting valour ••light.\n\n116.\n\nHeroique virtue did his actions guide, And he the substance not th' appearance chose: To rescue one such friend he took more pride Than to destroy whole thousands of such foes.\n\n117.\n\nBut, when approach'd, in strict embraces bound, Rupert and Albemarl together grow: He joys to have his friend in safety found, Which he to none but to that friend would owe.\n\n118.\n\nThe chearful Souldiers, with new stores suppli'd, Now long to execute their spleenfull will; And, in revenge for those three days they tri'd, Wish one, like Ioshuah's, when the Sun stood still.\n\ndescription Page 31\n\n119.\n\nThus re-inforc'd, against the adverse Fleet Still doubling ours, brave Rupert leads the way. With the first blushes of the Morn they meet, And bring night back upon the new-born day.\n\n120.\n\nHis presence soon blows up the kindling fight, And his loud Guns speak thick like angry men: It seem'd as slaughter had been breath'd all night, And death new pointed his dull dart agen.\n\n121.\n\nThe Dutch, too well his mighty Conduct knew, And matchless Courage since the former ••ight: Whose Navy like a stiff stretch'd cord did show Till he bore in, and bent them into flight.\n\n122.\n\nThe wind he shares while half their Fleet offends His open side, and high above him shows, Upon the rest at pleasure he descends, And, doubly harm'd, he double harms bestows.\n\ndescription Page 32\n\n123.\n\nBehind, the Gen'ral mends his weary pace, And sullenly to his revenge he sails: So glides some trodden Serpent on the grass, And long behind his wounded vollume trails.\n\n124.\n\nTh' increasing sound is born to either shore, And for their stakes the throwing Nations fear. Their passion, double with the Cannons roar, And with warm wishes each man combats there.\n\n125.\n\nPli'd thick and close as when the fight begun, Their huge unwieldy Navy wasts away: So sicken waning Moons too neer the Sun, And blunt their crescents on the edge of day.\n\n126.\n\nAnd now reduc'd on equal terms to fight, Their Ships like wasted Patrimonies show: Where the thin scatt'ring Trees admit the light, And shun each others shadows as they grow.\n\ndescription Page 33\n\n127.\n\nThe warlike Prince had sever'd from the rest Two giant ships, the pride of all the Main; Which, with his own, so vigorously he press'd, And flew so home they could not rise again.\n\n128.\n\nAlready batter'd, by his Lee they lay, In vain upon the passing winds they call: The passing winds through their torn canvass play, And flagging sails on heartless Sailors fall.\n\n129.\n\nTheir open'd sides receive a gloomy light, Dreadful as day let in to shades below: Without, grim death rides bare-fac'd in their sight, And urges ent'ring billows as they flow.\n\n130.\n\nWhen one dire shot, the last they could supply, Close by the boar'd the Prince's Main-mast bore: All three now, helpless, by each other lie, And this offends not, and those fear no more.\n\ndescription Page 34\n\n131.\n\nSo have I seen some fearful Hare maintain A Course, till tir'd before the Dog she lay: Who, stretch'd behind her, pants upon the plain, Past pow'r to kill as she to get away.\n\n132.\n\nWith his loll'd tongue he faintly licks his prey, His warm breath blows her flix up as she lies: She, trembling, creeps upon the ground away, And looks back to him with beseeching eyes.\n\n133.\n\nThe Prince unjustly does his Stars accuse, Which hinder'd him to push his fortune on: For what they to his courage did refuse, By mortal valour never must be done.\n\n134.\n\nThis lucky hour the wise Batavian takes, And warns his tatter'd Fleet to follow home: Proud to have so got off with equal stakes, Where 'twas a triumph not to be o'r-come.\n\ndescription Page 35\n\n135.\n\nThe General's force, as kept alive by fight, Now, not oppos'd, no longer can persue: Lasting till Heav'n had done his courage right, When he had conquer'd he his weakness knew.\n\n136.\n\nHe casts a frown on the departing foe, And sighs to see him quit the watry field: His stern fix'd eyes no satisfaction show, For all the glories which the Fight did yield.\n\n137.\n\nThough, as when Fiends did Miracles avow, He stands confess'd ev'n by the boastful Dutch, He onely does his conquest disavow, And thinks too little what they found too much.\n\n138.\n\nReturn'd, he with the Fleet resolv'd to stay, No tender thoughts of home his heart divide: Domestick joys and cares he puts away, For Realms are housholds which the Great must guide.\n\ndescription Page 36\n\n139.\n\nAs those who unripe veins in Mines explore, On the rich bed again the warm turf lay, Till time digests the yet imperfect Ore, And know it will be Gold another day.\n\n140.\n\nSo looks our Monarch on this early fight, Th' essay, and rudiments of great success, Which all-maturing time must bring to light, While he, like Heav'n, does each days labour bless▪\n\n141.\n\nHeav'n ended not the first or second day, Yet each was perfect to the work design'd: God and Kings work, when they their work survey▪ And passive aptness in all subjects find.\n\n142.\n\nIn burden'd Vessels, first, with speedy care, His plenteous Stores do season'd timber send Thither the brawny Carpenters repair, And as the Chyrurg'ons of maim'd ships attend\n\ndescription Page 37\n\n143.\n\nWith Cord and Canvass from rich Hamburgh sent, His Navies molted wings he imps once more: Tall Norway Fir, their Masts in Battel spent, And English Oak sprung leaks and planks restore.\n\n144.\n\nAll hands employ'd, the Royal work grows warm, Like labouring Bees on a long Summers day, Some sound the Trumpet for the rest to swarm, And some on bells of tasted Lillies play:\n\n145.\n\nWith glewy wax some new foundation lay Of Virgin combs, which from the roof are hung: Some arm'd within doors, upon duty stay, Or tend the sick, or educate the young.\n\n146.\n\nSo here, some pick out bullets from the sides, Some drive old Okum through each seam & rift: Their left-hand does the Calking-iron guide, The ratling Mallet with the right they lift.\n\ndescription Page 38\n\n147.\n\nWith boiling Pitch another near at hand (From friendly Sweden brought) the seams in-stops▪ Which well paid o'r the salt-Sea waves withstand, And shakes them

their ease or stifness notes.\n\n149.\n\nOur careful Monarch stands in Person by, His new-cast Canons firmness to explore: The strength of big-corn'd powder loves to try, And Ball and Cartrage sorts for every bore.\n\n150.\n\nEach day brings fresh supplies of Arms and Men, And Ships which all last VVinter were abrode: And such as fitted since the Fight had been, Or new from Stocks were fall'n

mean buildings first obscurely bred, From thence did soon to open streets aspire, And straight to Palaces and Temples spread.\n\n216.\n\nThe diligence of Trades and noiseful gain, And luxury, more late, asleep were laid: All was the nights, and in her silent reign, No sound the rest of Nature did invade.\n\n217.\n\nIn this deep quiet, from what scource unknown, Those seeds of fire their fatal birth disclose: And first, few scatt'ring sparks about were blown, Big with the flames that to our ruine rose.\n\n218.\n\nThen, in some close-pent room it crept along, And, smouldring as it went, in silence fed: Till th'infant monster, with devouring strong, Walk'd boldly upright with exalted head.\n\ndescription Page 56\n\n219.\n\nNow, like some rich or mighty Murderer, To great for prison, which he breaks with gold▪ Who fresher for new mischiefs does appear, And dares the world to tax him with the old.\n\n220.\n\nSo scapes th'insulting fire his narrow Jail, And makes small out-lets into open air: There the fierce winds his open force assail, And beat him down-ward to his first repair.\n\n221.\n\nThe winds, like crafty Courtezans, with-held His flames from burning, but to blow them more: And, every fresh attempt, he is repell'd With faint denials, weaker then before.\n\n222.\n\nAnd now, no longer letted of his prey, He leaps up at it with inrag'd desire: O'r-looks the neighbours with a wide survey, And nods at ••very house his threatning fire.\n\ndescription Page 57\n\n223.\n\nThe Ghosts of Traitors, from the Bridge descend, With bold Fanatick Spectres to rejoyce: About the fire into a Dance they bend, And sing their Sabbath Notes with feeble voice.\n\n224.\n\nOur Guardian Angel saw them where he sate Above the Palace of our slumbring King, He sigh'd, abandoning his charge to Fate, And, drooping, oft look back upon the wing.\n\n225.\n\nAt length the cra••kling noise and dreadful blaze, Call'd up some waking Lover to the sight: And long it was ere he the rest could raise, Whose heavy eye-lids yet were full of night.\n\n226.\n\nThe next to danger, hot pursu'd by fate, Half cloth'd, half naked, hastily retire: And frighted Mother strike their breasts, too late, For helpless Infants left amidst the fire.\n\ndescription Page 58\n\n227.\n\nTheir cries soon waken all the dwellers near: Now murmuring noises rise in every street▪ The more remote run s••umbling with their fear, And, in the dark, men justle as they meet.\n\n228.\n\nSo weary Bees in little Cells repose▪ But if night-robbers lift the well-stor'd Hive, An humming through their waxen City grows, And out upon each others wings they drive.\n\n229.\n\nNow stree••s grow throng'd and busie as by day: Some run for Buckets to the hallow'd Quire: Some cut the Pipes, and some the Engines play, And some more bold mount Ladders to the fire.\n\n230.\n\nIn vain: for, from the East, a Belgian wind, His hostile breath through the dry rafters sent: The flames impell••d, soon left their foes behind, And forward, with a wanton fury went.\n\ndescription Page 59\n\n231.\n\nA Key of fire ran all along the shore, And lighten'd all the River with the blaze: The waken'd Tydes began again to roar, And wond'ring Fish in shining waters gaze.\n\n231.\n\nOld Father Thames rais'd up his reverend head, But fear'd the fate of Simoeis would return: Deep in his Ooze he sought his sedgy bed, And shrunk his wate••s back into his Urn.\n\n233.\n\nThe fire, mean time, walks in a broader gross, To either hand his wings he opens wide: He wades the streets, & straight he reaches cross, And plays his longing flames on th'other side.\n\n234.\n\nAt first they warm, then scorch, and then they take: Now with long necks from side to side they feed: At length, grown strong, their Mother fire forsake, And a new Collony of flames succeed.\n\ndescription Page 60\n\n235.\n\nTo every nobler portion of the Town, The curling billows roul their restless ••yde: In parties now they straggle up and down, As Armies, unoppos'd, for prey divide.\n\n236.\n\nOne mighty Squadron, with a side wind sped, Through narrow lanes his cumb••r'd fire does haste: By pow'rful charms of gold and silver led, The Lombard Banquers and the Change to waste.\n\n237.\n\nAnother backward to the 〈◊〉〈◊〉 would go, And slowly ea••s his way against the wind▪ But the main body of the marching foe: Against th' Imperial Palace is design'd.\n\n238.\n\nNow day appears, and with the day the King, Whose early care had robb'd him of his rest: Far off the cracks of falling houses ring, And shrieks of subjects pierce his tender breast.\n\ndescription Page 61\n\n239.\n\nNear as he draws, thick harbingers of smoke, With gloomy pillars, cover all the place: Whose little intervals of night are broke By sparks that drive against his Sacred Face.\n\n240.\n\nMore then his Guards his sorrows made him known, And pious tears which down his cheeks did show'r: The wretched in his grief forgot their own: (So much the pity of a King has pow'r.)\n\n241.\n\nHe wept the flames of what he lov'd so well, And what so well had merited his love. For never Prince in grace did more excel, Or Royal City more in duty strove.\n\n242.\n\nNor with an idle care did he behold: (Subjects may grieve, but Monarchs must redress.) He chears the fearful, and commends the bold, And makes despairers hope for good success.\n\ndescription Page 62\n\n243.\n\nHimself directs what first is to be done, And orders all the succours which they bring. The helpful and the good about him run, And form an Army worthy such a King.\n\n244.\n\nHe sees the dire contagion spread so fast, That where it seizes, all relief is vain: And therefore must unwillingly lay waste That Country which would, else, the foe maintain.\n\n245.\n\nThe powder blows up all before the fire: Th' amazed flames stand gather'd on a heap; And from the precipices brinck retire, Afraid to venture on so large a leap.\n\n246.\n\nThus fighting fires a while themselves consume, But straight, like Turks, forc'd on to win or die▪ They first lay ••ender bridges of their fume, And o'r the breach in unctuous vapours flie.\n\ndescription Page 63\n\n247.\n\nPart stays for passage till a gust of wind Ships o'r their forces in a shining sheet: Part, creeping under ground, their journey blind, And, climbing from below, their fellows meet.\n\n248.\n\nThus, to some desart plain, or old wood side, Dire night has come from far to dance their round: And o'r brode Rivers on their fiends they ride, Or sweep in clowds above the blasted ground.\n\n249.\n\nNo help avails: for, Hydra-like, the fire, Lifts up his hundred heads to aim his way. And scarce the wealthy can one half retire, Before he rushes in to share the prey.\n\n250.\n\nThe rich grow suppliant, & the poor grow proud: Those offer mighty gain, and these ask more. So void of pity is th'ignoble crowd, When others ruine may increase their store.\n\ndescription Page 64\n\n251.\n\nAs those who live by shores with joy behold Some wealthy vessel split or stranded nigh; And, from the Rocks, leap down for shipwrack'd Gold, And seek the Tempest which the others flie.\n\n252.\n\nSo these but wait the Owners last despair, And what's permitted to the flames invade: Ev'n from their jaws they hungry morsels tear, And, on their backs, the spoils of Vulcan lade.\n\n253.\n\nThe days were all in this lost labour spent; And when the weary King gave place to night, His Beams he to his Royal Brother lent, And so shone still in his reflective light.\n\n254.\n\nNight came, but without darkness or repose, A dismal picture of the gen'ral doom: Where Souls distracted when the Trumpet blows And half unready with their bodies come.\n\ndescription Page 65\n\n255.\n\nThose who have homes, when home they do repair To a last lodging call their wand'ring friends. Their short uneasie sleeps are broke with care, To look how near their own destruction tends.\n\n256.\n\nThose who have none sit round where once it was, And with full eyes each wonted room require: Haunting the yet warm ashes of the place, As murder'd men walk where they did expire.\n\n257.\n\nSome stir up coals and watch the Vestal fire, Others in vain from sight of ruine run: And, while through burning Lab'rinths they retire, With loathing eyes repeat what they would shun.\n\n258.\n\nThe most, in fields, like herded beasts lie down; To dews obnoxious on the grassie floor: And while their ••abes in sleep their sorrows drown, Sad Parents watch the 〈◊〉〈◊〉 of t••eir store.\n\ndescription Page 66\n\n259.\n\nWhile by the motion of the flames they ghess What streets are burning now, & what are near: An Infant, waking, to the paps would press▪ And meets, instead of milk, a falling tea••.\n\n260.\n\nNo thought can ease them but their Sovereign's care, Whose praise th'afflicted as their comfort sing: Ev'n those whom want might drive to just despair, Think life a blessing under such a King.\n\n261.\n\nMean time he sadly suffers in their grief, Out-weeps an Hermite, and out-prays a Saint: All the long night he studies their relief, How they may be suppli'd, and he may want.\n\n262.\n\nO God, said he, thou Patron of my days, Guide of my youth in exile and distress! W••o me unfriended, brought'st by wondrous ways The Kingdom of my Fathers to possess.\n\ndescription Page 67\n\n263.\n\nBe thou my Judge, with what unwearied care I since have labour'd for my People's good: To bind the bruises of a Civil Wa••, And stop the issues of their wasting bloud.\n\n264.\n\nThou, who hast taught me to forgive the ill, And recompense, as friends the good, mis••ed; If mercy be a Precept of thy will, Return that mercy on thy Servant's head.\n\n265.\n\nOr, if my heedless Youth has stept astray, Too soon forgetful of thy gracious hand: On me alone thy just displeasure lay, But take thy judgments from this mourning Land.\n\n266.\n\nWe all have sinn'd, and thou hast laid us low, As humble Earth from whence at first we came: Like flying shades before the clowds we show, And shrink like Parchment in consuming 〈◊〉〈◊〉.\n\ndescription Page 68\n\n267.\n\nO let it be enough what thou hast done, When spotted deaths ran arm'd through every street, With poison'd darts, which not the good could shun. The speedy could out-fly, or valiant meet.\n\n268.\n\nThe living few, and frequent funerals then, Proclam'd thy wrath on this forsaken place: And now those few who are return'd agen Thy searching judgments to their dwellings trace.\n\n269.\n\nO pass not, Lord, an absolute decree, Or bind thy sentence unconditional: But in thy sentence our remorce foresee, And, in that foresight, this thy doom recall.\n\n270.\n\nThy threatnings, Lord, as thine, thou maist revoke: But, if immutable and fix'd they stand, Continue still thy self to give the stroke, And let not foreign foes oppress thy Land.\n\ndescription Page 69\n\n271.\n\nTh' Eternal heard, and from the Heav'nly Quire, Chose out the Cherub with the flaming sword: And bad him swiftly drive th' approaching fire From where our Naval Magazins were stor'd.\n\n272.\n\nThe blessed Minister his wings displai'd, And like a shooting Star he cleft the night: He charg'd the flames, and those that disobey'd, He lash'd to duty with his sword of light.\n\n273.\n\nThe fugitive flames, chastis'd, went forth to prey On pious Structures, by our Fathers rear'd: By which to Heav'n they did affect the way, Ere Faith in Church-men without Works was heard.\n\n274.\n\nThe wanting Orphans saw, with watry eyes, Their Founders charity in dust laid low: And sent to God their ever-answer'd cries, (For he protects the poor who made them so.)\n\ndescription Page 70\n\n275.\n\nNor could thy Fabrick, Paul's, defend thee long, Though thou wert Sacred to thy Makers praise: Though made immortal by a Poet's Song; And Poets Songs the Theban walls could raise.\n\n276.\n\nThe dareing flames peep't in and saw from far, The awful beauties of the Sacred Quire: But, since it was prophan'd by Civil War, Heav'n thought it fit to have it purg'd by fire.\n\n277.\n\nNow down the narrow streets it swiftly came, And, widely opening, did on both sides prey. This benefit we sadly owe the flame, If onely ruine must enlarge our way.\n\n278.\n\nAnd now four days the Sun had seen our woes, Four ••ights the Moon beheld th' incessant fi••e: It seem'd as if the Stars more sickly rose, And farther from the ••eav'rish North retire.\n\ndescription Page 71\n\n279.\n\nIn th' Empyrean Heaven, (the bless'd abode) The Thrones and the Dominions prostrate lie, Not daring to behold their angry God: And an hush'd silence damps the tune••ul sky.\n\n280.\n\nAt length th' Almighty cast a pitying eye, And mercy softly touch'd his melting breast: He saw the Town's one half in rubbish lie, And eager flames give on to storm the rest.\n\n281.\n\nAn hollow chrystal Pyramid he takes, In firmamental waters dipt above; Of it a brode Extinguisher he makes, And hoods the flames that to their quarry strove.\n\n282.\n\nThe vanquish'd fires withdraw from every place, Or full with feeding, sink into a sleep: Each houshold Genius shows again his face, And, from the hearths, the little Lares creep.\n\ndescription Page 72\n\n283.\n\nOur King this more then natural change beholds; With sober joy his heart and eyes abound: To the All-good his lifted hands he folds, And thanks him low on his redeemed ground.\n\n284.\n\nAs when sharp frosts had long constrain'd the earth, A kindly thaw unlocks it with mild rain: And first the tender blade peeps up to birth, And straight the green fields laugh with promis'd grain:\n\n285.\n\nBy such degrees, the spreading gladness grew In every heart, which fear had froze before: The standing streets with so much joy they view, That with less grief the perish'd they deplore.\n\n286.\n\nThe Father of the people open••d wide His stores, and all the poor with plenty fed: Thus God's Annointed God'•• own place suppli'd, And fill'd the empty with his daily bread.\n\ndescription Page 73\n\n287.\n\nThis Royal bounty brought its own reward, And, in their minds, so deep did print the sense: That if their ruines sadly they regard, 'Tis but with fear the sight might drive him thence.\n\n289.\n\nBut so may he live long, that Town to sway, Which by his Auspice they will nobler make, As he will hatch their ashes by his sta••, And not their humble ruines now forsake.\n\n290.\n\nThey have not lost their Loyalty by fire; Nor is their courage or their wealth so low, That from his Wars they poorly would retire, Or beg the pity of a vanquish'd foe.\n\n291.\n\nNot with more constancy the Iews of ol••, By ••yrus from rewarded Exile sent: Their Royal City did in dust behold, Or with more vigour to rebuild it went.\n\ndescription Page 74\n\n292.\n\nThe utmost malice of their Stars is past, And two dire Comets which have scourg'd the Town, In their own Plague and Fire have breath'd their last, Or, dimly, in their sinking sockets frown.\n\n293.\n\nNow frequent Trines the happier lights among, And high-rais'd Iove from his dark prison freed: (Those weights took off that on his Planet hung) Will gloriously the new laid work succeed.\n\n294.\n\nMe-thinks already, from this Chymick flame, I see a City of more precious mold▪ Rich as the Town which g••ves the Indies name, With Silver pav'd, and all divine with Gold.\n\n295.\n\nAlready, Labouring with a mighty fate, She shakes the rubbish from her mounting brow, And seems to have renew'd her Cha••ters date, Which Heav'n will to the death of time allow.\n\ndescription Page 75\n\n296.\n\nMore great then humane, now, and more August, New dei••i'd she from her fires does rise: Her widening streets on new foundations trust, And, opening, into larger parts she flies.\n\n297.\n\nBefore, she like some Shepherdess did show, Who sate to bathe her by a River's side: Not answering to her fame, but rude and low, Nor taught the beauteous Arts of Modern pride.\n\n298.\n\nNow, like a Maiden Queen, she will behold, From her high Turrets, hourly Sutors come: The East with Incense, and the West with Gold, Will stand, like Suppliants, to receive her doom.\n\n299.\n\nThe silver Thames, her own domestick Floud, Shall bear her Vessels, like a sweeping Train; And often wind (as of his Mistress proud) With longing eyes to meet her face again.\n\ndescription Page 76\n\n300.\n\nThe wealthy Tagus, and the wealthier Rhine, The glory of their Towns no more shall boast: And Sein, That would with Belgian Rivers joyn, Shall find her lustre stain'd, and Tra••fick lost.\n\n301.\n\nThe vent'rous Merchant, who design'd more far, And touches on our hospitable shore: Charm'd with the splendour of this Northern Star, Shall here unlade him, and depart no more.\n\n302.\n\nOur pow'rful Navy shall no longer meet, The wealth of France or Holland to invade: The beauty of this Town, without a Fleet, From all the world shall vindicate her Trade.\n\n303.\n\nAnd, while this fam'd Emporium we prepare▪ The British Ocean shall such triumphs boast, That those who now disdain our Trade to share, Shall rob like Pyrats o•• our wealthy Coast."
