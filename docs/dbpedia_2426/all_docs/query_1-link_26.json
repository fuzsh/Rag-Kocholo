        "text": "Rupert Chawner Brooke (middle name sometimes given as \"Chaucer\";[1] 3 August 1887 – 23 April 1915[2]) was an English poet known for his idealistic war sonnets written during the First World War, especially \"The Soldier\". He was also known for his boyish good looks, which were said to have prompted the Irish poet W. B. Yeats to describe him as \"the handsomest young man in England\".[3][4]\n\nEarly life and education[]\n\nBrooke was born at 5 Hillmorton Road, in the town of Rugby in Warwickshire,[5][6] the second of the three sons of William Parker Brooke, a Rugby schoolmaster, and Ruth Mary Brooke, née Cotterill. He was educated at two independent schools in Rugby; Hillbrow School and Rugby School.\n\nWhile travelling in Europe he prepared a thesis, entitled \"John Webster and the Elizabethan Drama\", which won him a scholarship to King's College, Cambridge, where he became a member of the Cambridge Apostles, helped found the Marlowe Society drama club and acted in plays including the Cambridge Greek Play.\n\nLife and career[]\n\nBrooke made friends among the Bloomsbury group of writers, some of whom admired his talent while others were more impressed by his good looks. Virginia Woolf boasted to Vita Sackville-West of once going skinny-dipping with Brooke in a moonlit pool when they were at Cambridge together.[7]\n\nBrooke belonged to another literary group known as the Georgian Poets and was one of the most important of the Dymock poets, associated with the Gloucestershire village of Dymock where he spent some time before the war. He also lived in the Old Vicarage, Grantchester.\n\nBrooke suffered a severe emotional crisis in 1912, caused by sexual confusion and jealousy, resulting in the breakdown of his long relationship with Ka Cox (Katherine Laird Cox).[8] Brooke's paranoia that Lytton Strachey had schemed to destroy his relationship with Cox by encouraging her to see Henry Lamb precipitated his break with his Bloomsbury group friends and played a part in his nervous collapse and subsequent rehabilitation trips to Germany.[9]\n\nAs part of his recuperation, Brooke toured the United States and Canada to write travel diaries for the Westminster Gazette. He took the long way home, sailing across the Pacific and staying some months in the South Seas. Much later it was revealed that he may have fathered a daughter with a Tahitian woman named Taatamata with whom he seems to have enjoyed his most complete emotional relationship.[10] Many more people were in love with him.[11] Brooke was romantically involved with the actress Cathleen Nesbitt and was once engaged to Noël Olivier, whom he met, when she was aged 15, at the progressive Bedales School.\n\nBrooke was an inspiration to poet John Gillespie Magee, Jr., author of the poem \"High Flight\". Magee idolised Brooke and wrote a poem about him (\"Sonnet to Rupert Brooke\"). Magee also won the same poetry prize at Rugby School which Brooke had won 34 years earlier.\n\nAs a war poet Brooke came to public attention in 1915 when The Times Literary Supplement quoted two of his five sonnets (\"IV: The Dead\" and \"V: The Soldier\") in full on 11 March and his sonnet \"V: The Soldier\" was read from the pulpit of St Paul's Cathedral on Easter Sunday (4 April). Brooke's most famous collection of poetry, containing all five sonnets, 1914 & Other Poems, was first published in May 1915 and, in testament to his popularity, ran to 11 further impressions that year and by June 1918 had reached its 24th impression;[12] a process undoubtedly fuelled through posthumous interest.\n\nDeath[]\n\nBrooke's accomplished poetry gained many enthusiasts and followers and he was taken up by Edward Marsh who brought him to the attention of Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty. He was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a temporary Sub-Lieutenant[13] shortly after his 27th birthday and took part in the Royal Naval Division's Antwerp expedition in October 1914. He sailed with the British Mediterranean Expeditionary Force on 28 February 1915 but developed sepsis from an infected mosquito bite. He died at 4:46 pm on 23 April 1915 in a French hospital ship moored in a bay off the island of Skyros in the Aegean on his way to the landing at Gallipoli. As the expeditionary force had orders to depart immediately, he was buried at 11 pm in an olive grove on Skyros, Greece.[1][2][14] The site was chosen by his close friend, William Denis Browne, who wrote of Brooke's death:[15]\n\n...I sat with Rupert. At 4 o’clock he became weaker, and at 4.46 he died, with the sun shining all round his cabin, and the cool sea-breeze blowing through the door and the shaded windows. No one could have wished for a quieter or a calmer end than in that lovely bay, shielded by the mountains and fragrant with sage and thyme.\n\nHis grave remains there today.[16] Another friend—and war poet—Patrick Shaw-Stewart, also played a prominent role in Brooke's funeral.[17] On 11 November 1985, Brooke was among 16 First World War poets commemorated on a slate monument unveiled in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.[18] The inscription on the stone was written by a fellow war poet, Wilfred Owen. It reads: \"My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.\"[19]\n\nThe original wooden cross that marked his grave on Skyros, which was painted and carved with his name, was removed to Clifton Road Cemetery in Rugby, Warkwickshire, to the Brooke family plot. When a permanent memorial was made for his grave on Skyros, Rupert Brooke's mother, Mary Ruth Brooke, had the original cross brought from Skyros to Rugby and placed at the plot. However, because of perishing in the open air, it was removed from the cemetery in 2008, and replaced by a more permanent marker. The original grave marker from Skyros is now at Rugby School with the memorials of other old Rugbeians.[20]\n\nBrooke's brother, 2nd Lt. William Alfred Cotterill Brooke, was a member of the 8th Battalion London Regiment (Post Office Rifles) and was killed in action near Le Rutoire Farm on 14 June 1915 aged 24. He is buried in Fosse 7 Military Cemetery (Quality Street), Mazingarbe, Pas de Calais, France. He had only joined the battalion on 25 May.[21]\n\nIn popular culture[]\n\nThis Side of Paradise, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, opens with the quotation \"Well this side of Paradise!… There's little comfort in the wise. — Rupert Brooke\"[22]\n\nDanny Kirwan used the first two verses of the poem \"Dust\" as the lyrics of the song of the same name on the 1972 Fleetwood Mac album \"Bare Trees\" without crediting Brooke.\n\nThe M*A*S*H episode \"Springtime\" features his poem \"Love\", read by Cpl. Radar O'Reilly\n\nThe 2009 novel The Great Lover, by Jill Dawson, is based on Brooke's life and mixes fact with fiction. The title is taken from one of Brooke's poems of the same name.[23]\n\nA.S. Byatt's 2009 novel \"The Children's Book\" centres on a social circle in which Brooke makes periodic appearances.[24]\n\nThe 2011 novel \"The Stranger's Child\" by Booker prize winning British novelist Alan Hollinghurst features fictional War Poet Cecil Valance who shares characteristics of, though is not as talented as, Brooke.[25]\n\nThe stage play \"The Hive\" by Australian playwright Sam Sejavka is a surreal play about the death of Rupert Brooke, directed by Robert Chuter, produced at La Mama Theatre, Melbourne 1989. The play won the Premier Literary Award and was nominated for three Green Room Awards, Melbourne, Australia.\n\nReferences[]\n\nFurther reading[]\n\nBrooke, Rupert, Letters From America with a Preface by Henry James (London: Sidgwick & Jackson, Ltd, 1931; repr. 1947).\n\nDawson, Jill, The Great Lover (London: Sceptre, 1990).
