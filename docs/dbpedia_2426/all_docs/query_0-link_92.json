        "text": "Church of St Michael & All Angels, Ledbury Herefordshire was dedicated to St Peter until the 19c www.flickr.com/gp/52219527@N00/Y65q38\n\nChristian worship began here in the 8c probably on a pagan site, after the Bishop of Hereford who became lord of the manor, sent a group of his clergy to the area.\n\nThe 1086 Domesday Survey says there was a large and important minster church here by then, the mother church of the area\n\nThe chancel and sanctuary are the oldest parts of the present building dating from 12c and may have been part of the larger church,\n\n1250-60 the north aisle and chapel were added , also a separate bell tower which could have been built as a strong refuge in case of attacks from the Welsh, also perhaps because of an ancient stream running underneath meant the foundations would not have been firm enough to take the weight of a tower at the west end.\n\nc1300-30 further rebuilding added the south aisle, & a chapter house built by Benedictine monks from Hereford who unsuccessfully tried to found a college and possibly a shrine to a local saint Katherine of Ledbury (never formally canonised) , together with the chapels of St Anne and the Lady chapel The 14c north porch followed topped with a parvise room.\n\nThe chancel arch was originally a round headed Norman arch, but it was probably later reshaped. There are round headed arches and porthole windows which probably started out as clerestory windows of the 12c church which originally looked out over the lower roofs of the former side aisles.\n\nBy the 15c the church had taken on the form we see today, with new higher arcades and aisles topped with timbered roofs .\n\nThe Civil War came to Ledbury in 1645 with a battle fought in the streets between Prince Rupert and the Roundhead leader General Massey. Damage caused by musket shot to the old wooden church doors of the north porch can still be seen.\n\nThe tower has 8 bells inscribed \"Thomas Cocks of Castleditch, Esqr 1690\" \"William Winter of Dymock Esqr 1690\"; \"God save Queen and Church- Richard Stone. Churchwarden 1706\"; \"Prosperity to this Town A.R. 1723\": \"Revd. Geo. Watts, vicar, Timothy Spence, churchwarden. We praise Thee O God, Mears, London fecit 1817\".: \"ABRA RVDHALL made vs eight in year 1690\": -J.H. Ch. W.P. Prosper they to this place A.R. 1699: Tenor Bell - \"Let love and peace in you abound , When you hear my harmonious sound. A.R. 1736 Jno George Thomas Bosward - Churchwardens\".\n\nin 1733 the 202 feet high spire was added to the tower .\n\nSadly the 18c was also a time of neglect when there were complaints of the cold wind \"making it uncomfortable for elderly people to attend their duties at the altar\".\n\nMajor restoration in 19c brought new pews, many stained glass windows and a general improvement to the fabric.\n\nOngoing work incudes solar panels on the roof.\n\nThere are many fine monuments including those to the 16c Skynner family www.flickr.com/gp/52219527@N00/6Gjj01 and the Biddulphs who followed them www.flickr.com/gp/52219527@N00/z3q4V9\n\nAlso Edward Moulton Barrett infamous father of the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning www.flickr.com/gp/52219527@N00/7s3e04 whose fortune came from the Jamaican plantation slavery as well as that of William Miles www.flickr.com/gp/52219527@N00/3k335Y\n\nEntries in the registers are interesting\n\n1583.- Jane Badland (beinge murthered at Donnington by one William Farr, of Estnor was buried the xxvth day of February, William being hanged on the Gallows Hill, the xvi day of Marche next following\n\n1590.- Ann Wells a poore wanderinge woman being frozen to death at peese bridge in the grete snowe and cruell cold was buried xvith day of December.\n\n1592.- Hugh Davies of Castlemorton one of the keepers in Malvern Chase being slayne with a gunne at Walmswell the xxiind day of June, was the same day buried the xxivth day of June.\n\n1594.- William Jones sometime of Whitney a poore man beinge slayne in the Horselane at Ledbury Fairre buried uppon the xxist day of this September.\n\n1596.- Aylton Capella, Jone Vove a poore wandering woman diinge at Jack a pleys (Jacob's leys in parish of Aylton) was buried the xiiith day of August.\n\n1597.- Owen alias.

He was the son of Richard Benyon Croft (1843–1912) a naval officer and a major benefactor of the Richard Hale School, and Anne Elizabeth (1843 – 1921). His father held the office of High Sheriff of Hertfordshire in 1892. He held the office of Deputy Lieutenant of Hertfordshire and held the office of Justice of the Peace for Hertfordshire.\n\nHe was the grandson of Reverend Richard Croft, rector at Hillingdon, Middlesex, England, and Charlotte Leonora Russell. He was the great grandson of Dr. Sir Richard Croft, 6th Baronet and Margaret Denman, daughter of Dr. Thomas Denman and Elizabeth Brodie and the sister of Thomas Denman, 1st Baron Denman who became Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.\n\nHis mother was the daughter of Henry Page of Ware, Hertfordshire, England. He was an astute businessman and had built up a very prosperous grain trade and a malster business. He left his large fortune including Fanhams Hall, a large country house and estate located in Ware, to his daughter Anne and her husband, Richard.\n\nHe was educated first at Eton College, until the death of his housemaster, then at Shrewsbury and finally at Trinity Hall, where he was a Volunteer and an oarsman. Upon leaving Cambridge Croft joined the family business.\n\nHe became an active participant of the 'Confederacy' of young gentry Chamberlainites who organised a Protectionist movement in Hertfordshire. In the general election of 1906 Croft stood at Lincoln against a Conservative Free Trader but failed to win the seat. In January 1910 however he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Christchurch as an anti-German Protectionist. His contribution to the tariff reform campaign before the Great War has been described as \"immense\". In protest against what he perceived as the reactionary policy of Conservative leader Arthur Balfour, Croft founded the Reveille, a group that campaigned for imperialism and social reform.\n\nIn the House of Commons he was a prominent advocate of food taxation, Imperial Preference and as a supporter of Ulster against Home Rule. Croft was with Viscount Castlereagh at Mount Stewart when Ulster prepared for war in 1914. When the First World War broke out he went to France with his territorial battalion of the Hertfordshire Regiment. In 1915 he was the first territorial to command a brigade in the field but his reports to politicians back home about the conduct of his commanders aroused controversy and so in 1916 he was recalled, where he returned to the Commons.\n\nIn co-operation with Sir Richard Cooper, because of what they perceived as the \"discrediting of the old party system\", they founded the National Party in September 1917. They were also angered at the bestowal of honours on those they believed did not deserve them and that hundreds of enemy aliens should be at liberty in Britain when they were possibly endangering British soldiers' lives by passing information to the enemy. The National Party aimed for: \"Complete victory in the war and after the war\"; robust diplomacy along with increased armaments; the \"eradication of German influence\"; ending the sale of honours; maximum production along with fair wages and fair profit; safeguarding of industry and agriculture; Empire unity through mutual and reciprocal aid in development of the natural resources of the Empire; a social policy that will ensure a \"patriotic race\"; and demobilization and reconstruction.\n\nAt the 1918 election Croft was elected as the National candidate for Bournemouth, a seat he would hold until 1940. In his autobiography Croft claimed that\n\nWe emerged from the world war in 1918 stronger than at any time in our history. On the sea our fleet was supreme and unchallengeable; we had a mighty army such as we had never possessed before; in the air our power had reached its zenith and was probably the largest, best manned and most finely equipped fighting force in that sphere. ... Great Britain ... proceeded to go “international” and our great country, which had been saved by the valour and patriotism of our people, was deliberately encouraged to rely for its safety upon a hotch-potch collection of small states embodied in what was never a world League of Nations but a League of some nations based not on defensive force but on pious resolutions which were endorsed by ceaseless chatter at many conferences.\n\nIn February 1919 Croft denounced H. H. Asquith, Reginald McKenna, Walter Runciman, Arthur Henderson and Ramsay MacDonald as \"the worse type of pacifist cranks\": \"It is very delightful to have been able to mention their names in this House. These men...were not defeated at the polls but squelched. Why did they rally to the proposal? [i.e. the placing of conquered German colonies under League of Nations mandate]. Because they saw it was unnational\". When Coalition Liberal MP Alexander Lyle-Samuel made a speech criticising reparations from Germany and supported the League of Nations, Croft claimed that although Lyle-Samuel sat for a Suffolk constituency, he might well sit for Wurtemburg or Bavaria in Germany. The Gladstonian liberal, R. B. McCallum, said Croft \"was the authentic voice of triumphant, nationalist Toryism ... [he] represented the crude, philistine spirit of John Bullish nationalism. He was speaking for millions\".\n\nAlong with Cooper, Croft was prominent in the campaign against the Prime Minister David Lloyd George in July 1922 for selling honours.\n\nCroft wrote articles for the National Review and doubted the effectiveness of the League of Nations. Croft was strongly opposed to the National Government's Government of India Act 1935, which granted further self-government to India, and joined Winston Churchill and the India Defence League in opposing the Act. Croft was also associated with Churchill in urging greater rearmament in face of the German threat. In June 1938 Croft wrote a series of articles for the Weekly Review, arguing for rearmament. However, unlike Churchill, Croft supported the Munich Agreement, believing that the incorporation of the Sudetenland into Germany was inevitable and that Britain could not prevent it militarily due to insufficient British rearmament.\n\nCroft's daughter Diana married in 1936 the German lawyer and painter Fred Uhlman, a clear misalliance in the eyes of Croft.\n\nIn 1940 Croft was ennobled, and appointed by Winston Churchill as Under-Secretary of State for War, a post he would hold until July 1945. Croft in his memoirs said of The Blitz: \"Every class of Londoner responded defiantly to the long, long period of attack and from the Royal Family to the Coster or Dustman all vied in showing their contempt of danger and sustained each other through bomb raids, “doodles” and rockets to the end ... London is a grand city with a big heart\".\n\nCroft recognised the need to improve morale in the Army and wrote on 12 August 1940 of the need for education and entertainment to be provided to servicemen on a big scale: travelling cinemas, technical classes, correspondence courses, and morale boasting stories of the Empire and regimental traditions. A Director of Education was appointed and by the winter of 1943–44 there were more than 110,000 courses, lectures and classes being provided.\n\nOn 4 February 1942 Croft said in the Lords:\n\nThere seems to be a feeling abroad that the rifle is essential as a weapon for all the Home Guard, and I should like to remind your Lordships that in the event of invasion in a great part of this country we shall be engaged in fighting of a close character. For instance, in the actual cities, towns and villages the opportunities for using hand grenades against enemy motor cyclists and infantry, and incendiary and high explosive grenades against vehicles of all descriptions will be immense. If every platoon had its trained sections of grenade throwers or bombers there is no doubt that operating from trenches or from windows or doorways, or suddenly emerging round houses and cottages, they would he able to inflict great casualties upon an advancing enemy. If I were organizing an attack—I am afraid this sounds rather absurd from one so aged as myself, but my noble friend Lord Mottistone, who I always feel is so much younger than many of us, would probably bear me out in this—I would rather have trained bombers for fighting in urban areas, and if a bombing attack could be swiftly followed up by cold steel, it would be most effective. If I were a bomber in such a formation—and I think I have thrown most types of bombs that have been used in the Army—I should like to have a pike in order to follow up my bombing attack, especially at night. It is a most effective and silent weapon.\n\nThe reporting of this in the press attracted ridicule and accusations that Croft was issuing pikes to the Home Guard and that he was \"pike-minded\". The Liberal Nationalist MP Sir Henry Fildes said in the Commons on 11 March:\n\nHere lies a man who fought the Hun;\n\nHe had a pike, the Hun a gun;\n\nWhen his time came to go aloft,\n\nWhom must he blame? The Hun or Croft?\n\nTo which Leo Amery wrote in reply:\n\nWhy blame poor Croft who through long years\n\nPreached lack of guns to unwilling ears?\n\nBlame rather in this hour of need\n\nThe foolish ears that would not heed.\n\nIn a speech at Watford during the 1945 general election campaign Croft called the Labour Party Chairman Harold Laski, who was Jewish, \"that fine old English labour man\". Churchill wrote to Croft on 20 June: \"I see you used an expression in your speech the other day about Laski that he was “a fine representative of the old British working class”, or words to that effect. Pray be careful, whatever the temptation, not to be drawn into any campaign that might be represented as anti-semitism\".\n\nCroft died in 1947 at the Middlesex Hospital, London.\n\nThe Times said of Croft after he died:\n\nBy his unflagging zeal and faith in the British imperial heritage, he won for himself a distinctive place in political life. Staunch Conservative as he was, he placed service to the imperial ideal at least as high as party loyalty. This enthusiasm and a personality that was attractive as well as forcible made their influence felt in the House of Commons and on the platform. At every opportunity he advocated greater settlement by the British race in the Dominions and the strengthening of the bonds of Empire by every possible means, and he was a recognized if unofficial leader in Parliament of a group sharing his convictions and aspirations. One article in Croft's political creed which he proclaimed long before voluntary National Service was instituted in 1938–39 was that citizens should require the State for guaranteeing the rights of private ownership by engaging in some form of public activity. ... He was popular at the War Office and still much in request on the public platform, from which he could always put over a point effectively, though party politics suited his style and temperament better than the advocacy of the policy of a coalition. But he continued to sound the patriotic note convincingly, all the more so because he was a completely sincere patriot.\n\nGeorge H Stanford, photographer, 190 Christchurch Road, Boscombe.\n\nPostally unused.\n\nThe Postcard\n\nA postally unused Colourmaster International Series postcard that was published by Photo Precision Limited of St. Ives, Huntingdon. The card, which was printed in Great Britain, has a divided back.\n\nFor some reason the publishers have blocked out the clock in the top right-hand corner.\n\nAlthough the card was not posted, someone has written a recipient's name and address on the divided back of the card:\n\nMr. & Mrs. Norman,\n\n2, Bere Road,\n\nWareham,\n\nDorset.\n\nThere was also a message on the divided back:\n\n\"Dear Mr. & Mrs. Norman,\n\nThank you very much for\n\nyour good wishes card.\n\nWe have been staying up\n\nhere with Jean & family,\n\nand both of us have\n\nbenefitted from the rest.\n\nI have to go to Dorchester\n\nFriday 12th. August for a\n\ncheck-up, so am hoping\n\nfor the best.\n\nBest wishes from us both,\n\nPhyl & Frank Carter\".\n\nThe reference to Friday the 12th. August, coupled with the unfranked 9 pence stamp on the back of the card mean that the card was written in 1977.\n\nHigh Wycombe\n\nHigh Wycombe, often referred to simply as Wycombe, is a large market town in Buckinghamshire. Lying in the valley of the River Wye surrounded by the Chiltern Hills, it is 29 miles (47 km) west north-west of Charing Cross in London; this information is also engraved on the Corn Market building in the centre of the town.\n\nIn 2016, High Wycombe had a population of 125,260, and is the second largest town in the county of Buckinghamshire after Milton Keynes.\n\nWycombe is a combination of industrial and market town, with a traditional emphasis on furniture production. There has been a market held in the High Street since at least the Middle Ages. The market is held on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nHistory of High Wycombe\n\nWycombe appears in the Domesday Book of 1086, and was noted for having six mills. The town once featured a Roman villa (built 150–170 AD) which has been excavated three times, most recently in 1954. Mosaics and a bathhouse were unearthed at the site on what is now the Rye parkland. High Wycombe was the home of 19th.-century Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.\n\nHigh Wycombe remained a mill town through Medieval and Tudor times, manufacturing lace and linen cloth. It was also a stopping point on the way from Oxford to London, with many travellers staying in the town's taverns and inns.\n\nThe paper industry was notable in 17th. and 18th. century High Wycombe. The Wye's waters were rich in chalk, and therefore ideal for bleaching pulp. However the paper industry was overtaken by the cloth industry.\n\nWycombe's most famous industry, furniture (particularly Windsor chairs), took hold in the 19th. century, with furniture factories setting up all over the town. Many terraced workers' houses were built to accommodate those working in the furniture factories.\n\nIn 1875, there were 4,700 chairs being made per day in High Wycombe. When Queen Victoria visited the town in 1877, the council organised an arch of chairs to be erected over the High Street, with the words 'Long Live the Queen' printed boldly across the arch for the Queen to pass under.\n\nWycombe Museum includes many examples of locally made chairs along with information on the local furniture and lace industries.\n\nThe town's population grew from 13,000 residents in 1881 to 29,000 in 1928. Wycombe was completely dominated socially and economically by the furniture industry and, consequently, there was considerable unemployment and social problems when the industry declined in the 1960's.\n\nHigh Wycombe in the 20th. Century\n\nBy the 1920's, many of the housing areas of Wycombe had decayed into slums. A slum clearance scheme was initiated by the council in 1932, whereby many areas were completely demolished and the residents re-housed in new estates that sprawled above the town on the valley slopes.\n\nSome of the districts demolished were truly decrepit, such as Newland, where most of the houses were condemned as unfit for human habitation, with sewage pouring down the street and people sharing one room in cramped quarters of subdivided flats. However, some areas such as St. Mary's Street contained beautiful old buildings with fine examples of 18th. and 19th. century architecture.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1968 High Wycombe was the seat of RAF Bomber Command. Moreover, during the Second World War, from 1942 to 1945, the U.S. Army Air Force's 8th. Air Force Bomber Command, code-named 'Pinetree', was based at a former girls' school at High Wycombe.\n\nIn the 1960's the town centre was redeveloped. This involved culverting the River Wye under concrete and demolishing most of the old buildings in Wycombe's town centre. Two shopping centres were built along with many new multi-storey car parks, office blocks, flyovers and roundabouts. On the open area known as Frogmoor (or Frogmore) the original cast-iron fountain and some Georgian buildings were also torn down. (...Sounds as if they ruined the town centre).\n\nAlthough situated in the county of Buckinghamshire, which is one of the more affluent parts of the country, Wycombe contains some considerably deprived areas. In 2007, a GMB Union survey ranked the Wycombe district as the 4th. dirtiest in the South East, and the 26th. dirtiest in the whole of the UK. The survey found litter on 28.5% of streets and highways.\n\nHigh Wycombe Politics\n\nWycombe's political history extends back to 1295.\n\nThe Wycombe Constituency has continuously elected Conservative Members of Parliament since 1951.\n\nHigh Wycombe has been home to two Prime Ministers:\n\n- The Earl of Shelburne lived at what is now Wycombe Abbey.\n\n- Benjamin Disraeli, who lived at nearby Hughenden Manor, was defeated as an independent candidate in 1832, but won the election in 1868 and 1874-1880 as a Conservative. Disraeli made his first political speech in Wycombe, from the portico over the door of the Red Lion Hotel on the High Street (now Iceland/Bargain buys).\n\nAlthough the hotel has gone, the portico with the red lion on top has survived - you can just about see it on the right, beyond the yellow car.\n\nWeighing the Mayor\n\nA ceremony carried out in the town since 1678 involves the weighing of the mayor. At the beginning and end of each year of service, the mayor is weighed in full view of the public to see whether or not he or she has gained weight, presumably at the taxpayers' expense.\n\nThe custom, which has survived to the present day, employs the same weighing apparatus used since the 19th. century. When the result is known, the town crier announces \"And No More!\" if the mayor has not gained weight, or \"And Some More!\" if they have. Their actual weight is not declared.\n\nMedia Coverage of High Wycombe\n\nHigh Wycombe has been featured in the national media in recent years for a number of different reasons, including:\n\n- Coverage of the local library's refusal to display a Christmas carol service poster.\n\n- The triple shooting of three young Asian men.\n\n- A small-scale riot between feuding families and gangs in which knives, metal poles, and an axe were used whilst a gunman sprayed bullets.\n\n- The shooting and murder of Natasha Derby at point-blank range in the middle of a busy dance floor at a town centre venue.\n\n- The town appeared in national and international media after anti-terrorism raids were carried out as part of the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot. Five arrests were made at three different houses in the town's Totteridge and Micklefield areas. A number of houses in High Wycombe were evacuated in Walton Drive, which is thought to be because one of the raided houses contained dangerous liquid chemicals.\n\n- On the 21st. December 2009, heavy snowfall hit the town, paralysing its road network (which is mainly on steep hills), and causing major disruption to refuse services for several weeks. Staff and customers of the John Lewis department store were stranded overnight.\n\nNotable Residents of High Wycombe\n\nPast and present residents of High Wycombe include:\n\n(a) Entertainment and the Media:\n\nAlexander Aze – child actor.\n\nColin Baker – actor who played the sixth incarnation of the Doctor in Doctor Who.\n\nKaty Brand - Comedian and writer.\n\nMighty Boosh stars Noel Fielding and Dave Brown met when they attended Bucks New University in Wycombe.
