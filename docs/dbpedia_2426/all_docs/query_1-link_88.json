        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Rupert\n\nRupert, whose other variation is Robert, is derived from the Old High German Hruodoperht/Hruodoberht. Rupert or Ruppert is an English abbreviation of Latin Rupertus.\n\nRobert and Rupert are, therefore, two current alternative spellings of the same name. Rupert means ‘fame bright’ in the Old High German version of the name, which developed from the Germanic name hrothi meaning fame, glory’ and berht, meaning ‘bright.’\n\nSaint Rupert of Bingen and Saint Rupert of Salzburg, who lived in the seventh and eighth centuries respectively, carried the name. Rupert, who traveled to Rome on a pilgrimage at 15, is revered as the patron saint of pilgrims.\n\nAt 20, Rupert passed away from a fever. Rupert was held in high esteem by Saint Hildegard of Bingen, who lived 400 years later. She prepared an Historia Sancti Ruperti and established her monastery of Rupertsberg at Rupert’s grave.\n\nThe Normans brought the surname Robert to Britain during the reign of Edward the Confessor, where it quickly gained popularity. In the past, this name gave rise to many diminutives and pet variants. The first known bearers of the surname Roberts lived in Denbighshire, a county in Northeast Wales established by the Laws in Wales Act of 1536. They were descendants of Rhodri Mawr, King of Wales.\n\nThis name was first used in England in the 17th century by the military commander Prince Rupert of the Rhine, a descendant of Charles I. Robert, Roparzh, Robin, Roope, Roopertti, Raibeart, Roberto, Ruprecht are the common variants of the name.\n\nRupert is a famous name in the fictional world and has been used in many movies and literary pieces. Rupert Baxter is a character in the Blandings stories by P. G. Wodehouse. Other characters sharing the same name are Rupert Giles on the television series “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and Rupert Bear, a cartoon bear created by Mary Tourtel.\n\nHow To Pronounce Rupert?\n\n‘Rupert’ In QR Code\n\nNotable People Named Rupert\n\nThis section covers people who have made the name Rupert famous with their contributions in various fields.

According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.\n\nTo know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.
