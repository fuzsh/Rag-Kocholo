        "text": "I am trying to fill in gaps in my family history and wonder if Susan Wynn-Jones' parents and mine were contemporaries in the 1930's.\n\nMy grandfather, Ferdinand Reder, was a sisal plantation owner.\n\nMy father, Ferdinand William Reder, worked at Ford International in Dar-Es-Salaam for Abdullah Karimjee,\n\nI believe. My parents lived in Tanga overlooking the bay and my grandparents lived in Moshi with another home in Soni, where I believe they are buried.\n\nMy aunt, Elizabeth Reder Stadler Forbes, had a small business in Nairobi, and had two daughters, Barbara and Mary-Lynne Stadler, who were educated in Europe. One of their very dear friends was Father Joseph Noppinger, who was from either the Holy Ghost Fathers or Maryknoll Fathers, and I believe established several schools in Tanganyika and/or Kenya.\n\nI have hundreds of letters written by my family during this period and am just beginning to organize them for publishing but have many unanswered questions, such as what became of their homes and businesses.\n\nIf anyone recognizes these names I would love to hear from you.\n\nI am a Kenyan citizen currently residing in Nairobi. I recently came a cross an Old man claiming to have taken part in the first world war and to prove it, he un-vailed some of the artifacts that he claim he was given.\n\nOne of the items was a round copper coin with one of its sides swollen have an inscription of what he refered to as William Kaisas Head with a bird on top of it. The other side was flat with the name William Kaisa inscription on the edges,& other German wording in the mild. When placed closely to the ear & Shaken, some form of heavy liquid can be hard moving & when you fold it into your palm, it sensationalizes your hand.\n\nWord on the street has it that this item is a lot of money.\n\nQuestion (1): Is it true?\n\nQuestion (2): How much is it worth?\n\nQuestion (3): If we were to exchange it for monetary gains, how & where would the transaction take place.\n\nAlso shown was a Knife & a Stove egg sharped with palm tree & two Lions on the sides.\n\nBoth items looked like they were made long time ago.\n\nWhat a wonderful surprise reading all the memories of school life in Arusha\"\n\nThe tortoise was my silent witness to all those anxious thoughts and fears of the tacky and the innocent errors in judgement mentioned by Andy Hannah.\n\nI think of an Italian girl (possibly Andrea?) whose cries we heard as we cringed in our beds while she got the tacky for daring to use the toilet after 'lights out.' Where was the logic? So, we wet the bed and that was OK?\n\nEven lovable Miss Jewell, gave the tacky to 3 girls who filled their skirts with the beautiful jacaranda blossoms and lay in wait behind a tree to surprise her with a tribute of showering petals. I missed the punishment only because I was late to the surprise event.\n\nI was in love with Huw Jones ;) and would beg off those Sunday afternoon walks to play cricket with him\"Would love to know how he isï¿½His Father was so sweet. I was in Huw's class and I believe his Dad taught French and would ask me to pronounce the words for the class (we spoke French at home).\n\nThere was Margaret in the front of the class who had the most infectious giggle\" Bryn Jones would say, 'Now, who's tickling Maggieï¿½' leading to another 5 minutes of hysterical giggles.\n\nWho was the strict head matron who always did those frightful tapestries\".her houseboy was not to be trusted around little girls and on one errand to her flat I discovered the speed with which I could descend the stairs.\n\nWho was the music teacher with the blue rinse and glass eye who taught knitting?\n\nThe beautiful pianist with the perfect french roll hairdo.\n\nThe kitchen ladyï¿½very stern, who picked up all the bread crusts from under the table one night and had them displayed to us by Mr. Hampshire. What a lecture that was.\n\nI too remember the 3 elephants from the John Wayne film who were brought to the field. A few were chosen to ride then they turned on the sprinklers so that the elephants could play. We also stood along the side of the road to watch the filming in action.\n\nSome names of students I remember: Huw Jones, Birgit Lund of Moshi where I too spent Half Term, Giles Dingwall, Lesley Truesdale and Katherine Tregarthen whose Mum was gorgeous and brought us lollies at the Sanitorium.\n\nLove your website...a healing experience.\n\nI've spent hours discovering the various messages, photos.\n\nI recognized and remembered Jane Holton from her photo, and Marjorie as well.\n\nI remember the school photo, and the discipline it took to get us all to sit still and squeeze in! I am in the 2nd row, 5th from the right with short brown hair.\n\nIf Karsten Lund reads this, I would love to have his sister, Birgit's contact information.\n\nAlso David Holmes -- a family friend--who lost a shoe out of the train window on the trip to Arusha. I would get on, I believe in Morogwe at 10 pm and we'd arrive at 1 PM the next day. The highlight of the trip was anticipating the bathing villagers in the rivers along the way.\n\nSomeone mentioned an earthquake in 1963, after my time. There was another one in 1956 thru 59 because in the long dormitory, with the highly polished floor, when we awoke in the morning our beds had slid across the room and were quite out of order--slippers everywhere. We were fascinated.\n\nI often think of the matron waking us up very early, carrying her little alcohol jar of thermometers as she walked from one bed to another popping in the thermometer, shaking it down, while her shoes squeaked on the polished floor. She always seemed to find one child with a fever.\n\nThere was an annual event, possibly sports day, when there was a parents race. One Mum was tall and ran really fast and always won the race.\n\nAnd later: (4th March)\n\nLisette Moulinie is the way I was known at Arusha School.\n\nI have gleaned some answers to my own questions from your website since I wrote\"\n\nMrs White was the music teacher with the blue rinse hairdo.\n\nI believe Leslie's surname was Teasdale and she came from Moshi.\n\nI have actually connected with Birgit Lund this past week and look forward to continuing our relationship after 50 years!\n\nI live in California, a long way from Arusha, and work as an Occupational Health Nurse in the semi-conductor industry. Thank you again for maintaining such a wonderful website.\n\nThis school was formative for my schooling in the best sense of British idealism given the great staff there mainly from Australia - the very brilliant Mr. David Nettelbeck our Headmaster and others under his command. I was called Mohamed back then as an adoptee first name although it was indeed inappropriate as it turned out and had to be shrugged off entirely as I came to my senses altogether in this regard.\n\nI now lead the Euro British Coalition, based in Canada that aims for a Euro entity to come into being under the Irish/Australians in fact on the Euro continent of course!\n\nLater (18 April 2008):\n\nI was there early seventies 1971- and in fact Nettlebeck had left at the end of my stay at the school, having been replaced by an indeginous personal from the army, a sergeant in fact. (as such Mr. Nettlebeck was no longer at the school by the mid seventies)\n\nI was awarded the prize for Mathematics and for Drama elocution in addition by Mr. Nettlebeck personally. I was also top speller!\n\nI was also dorm leader during my time there. I once fractured my leg in a soccer mishap and Mr. Nettlebck had to drive to the capital to obtain some plaster of paris for the local hospital to apply!\n\nI have been in touch with David Nettlebeck, who made contacts recently\n\nHaving been born in Arusha in 1950 and living the next 11 years of my life in Northern Tanganyika I find the personal memories of others in your website interesting and fascinating.\n\nMany thanks for your hard efforts.\n\nMy 11 years were spent, along with my family, in the villages of Kondoa, Babati and finally Biharamulo, West Lake Province. My memory of years isn't too bright but we lived in each location for approximately 3 years before moving on to the next, except Kondoa where my Father John 'Jack' Allen spent 2 tours.\n\nMy early education, along with my brothers David Allen the elder and Robert Allen the younger, was undertaken in the HRH Aga Khan School, Babati, where my Mother Marjorie Allen was the teacher and co-founder of the school. Brother David started at Mbeya School at some stage during this tour in Babati.\n\nOn moving to Biharamulo in 1958/59 my younger brother and I were sent to Mbeya School and David started at St Michaels, Iringa. I have many happy, and some more painful, memories of Mbeya. The House (Wallington) Matron living in her flat at the end of the dormitory, The fear of the House Masters flexible black rubber 'tacky', Mr Morgan (I think) running the Cub Scout pack. Birthday teas, Saturday letter writing home followed by a visit to the Tuck shop and a film in the afternoon, Sundays visit to the River Garden, and many more.\n\nOn my Mothers death I found that she had kept a large number of those Saturday letters home and amongst them was a sketch of the River Gardens as drawn by a not so budding artist. This last may be of help to Judith Anderson\n\nOn a different tack, before his death, my Father wrote part of his life story. The story begins in Notttingham, UK, and goes on to his move to Tanganyika in 1928, at 13 years old, with his parents to an estate in Sao Hill. It tracks his life in the nTZ area during the 30s to joining and leaving the East African Army between the years 39 - 42. Unfortunately he didn't have time to continue the story further.\n\nI have now copied this story to PC along with photos taken at the time and would be happy to pass on a copy to you if it interests you.\n\nBy way of interest, Sao Hill is named after the estate my Grandfather named and ran and subsequently where he built the Highlands Hotel in said place.\n\nAgain many thanks for your informative and entertaining website.\n\nDear East Africa enthusiast,\n\nbeing at present posted in the German Embassy in Nairobi I happened to run across this interesting website about NTZ.\n\nIn a novel about a German officer taking part in the German-East Africa (GEA) campaign (Otto Inhülsen: Wir ritten für Deutsch-Ostafrika -We rode for German-East Africa - 1926) I found the person of Adolph Siedentopf thoroughly described and would like to share these information with the interested reader:\n\nInhülsen was on a raid to British East Africa, to confuse the British about the real low strength of the German troops in Northern GEA, which brought him from Arusha through the crater highlands almost south of Nairobi , passing what now is Norok province north of the Masai Mara Game Reserve):\n\n> Adolph Siedentopf:\n\nSeptember 1915: 44 years old\n\nBorn in Hanover - Western Germany\n\nApprenticeship as a pharmacist.\n\nArrived in the middle/end of the 1880s in Dar es Salaam to work in the local German pharmacy.\n\nBeing adventurous travelled soon up country to nowadays Mwanza to trade with ivory and cattle. Begin of a close relationship with the Masai tribe whose language he learnt.\n\nSince 1905 farmer in Ngoro-Ngoro ( received 6000 hectare of land by the German administration, although he claimed 24,000 ha, i.e. the whole crater area).\n\n1 \"young wife\", no children so far (9/1915).\n\nLater constant quarrel with the administration because of the meanwhile established Masai reservation in the area, not allowing settling and farming anymore.\n\nHad 6 former ascaris from the Belgium Congo province as bodyguards and lived peacefully together with 20 Masai families, who had lost there livestock during the rinderpest (1915: 1000 cattle). Boor farmers helped him to build his farmhouse in \"boorish style\".\n\nInterestingly Inhülsen mentions in his book that during his visit in 1915 Siedentopf's brother lived in the crater, too. Inhülsen entered the crater from the South East side (possibly on the present SE descent). After 2-3 Km (!) at the Lemunge River the farmhouse was situated. I.e. not in the NE of the crater, where you can visit the remnants of a German farm today: is it possible that these are the ruins of his brother's farm? Are there still ruins in the SE area of the crater?\n\nInhülsen describes Mr. Siedentopf as a very impressive, tall, energetic and tough person, which nevertheless was very sympathetic and humorous. He entertained the visiting officers over hours with funny campfire stories - \"Once you learnt to know him you would never forget him\". Inhülsen met him again in Summer 1916 in the POW camp in Nairobi, where Siedentopf meanwhile had developed into the sports champion of the camp.\n\nThere the description ends.\n\nHaving emigrated into the US in post war Germany with already inflation in 1919 (having lost possible family property in Germany), famine, political turmoil, unemployment and economic depression\" considering my family's history - appears plausible to me. This goes even more for somebody used to the free and different live in Eastern Africa\"\n\nSuicide in 1932 around 72 years old , if really committed, could than have been caused by chronic disease or the 2nd economical break down in Adolph Siedentopf's live, during the great depression after the wall street crash in 1929.\n\nIf these additional information will help to bring more light in the life of Adolph Siedentopf, please let me / us know.\n\nI started at Mbeya School Jan 1961, the headmaster was Mr Morgan. I was in Stanley House and remember being able to climb the Fir trees around the sports field, the swimming pool being built, picking up litter before the Saturday evening films, the drummer annoucing mealtimes, shoe cleaning on the grass in front of the dorms, and being taken to see the Walt Disney film Sleeping Beauty in Mbeya. The huge bonfires for Guy Fawkes across the stream, and the Kite making competition and the three horned chameleons. The awful TAB injections and the fancy dress party at the end of the year. Saturday evening Scottish dancing(being wisked through the Dashing white Sargeant with Mr Morgan) and the yearly House sing competition with it English Country songs.\n\nThe school closed down July 1963 and we were incorporated into Arusha School for the last term of the year.\n\nI was born in Mahenge and we had to pick up the bus at the Mikumi stop. There were two bus loads of children from Dar and Morogoro and we overnighted at Iringa, girls in the White Horse Inn and boys in the Railway Hotel, this was reversed on the way out, Later when the numbers had dropped we all stayed at the railway hotel. One term the bridge on the Iringa road washed away, so we were bussed up to Itigi, overnight, to catch the train. My sister Judith joined me at the end of 1961 and was the smallest person at school and we were known as Big Butler and little Butler.\n\nI am now fascinated by the curiously dated slang that we used and never came across at any of the other boarding schools I attended. Bosch for rubbish and the use of surnames only.\n\nThankyou for the interesting Website. I don't recognise any names but would love to hear from anyone who was at school with me.\n\nI was intrequed to read about Gladys Rydon as my late father, Ronnie Hamilton, was her business partner and managed Ol Kokola estate on the slopes of Mt Meru between 1947-1950, when he left to take up a job in the growing sisal industry further 'up the line'.\n\nMy mother, Olivia, can clearly remember staying at Gladys' lovely home on lake Diluti and told me that her son David was a very talented artist. David lived in separate house on the estate where he had his studio.\n\nMy Ma was also the receptionist at the 'New Arusha' for a short time and had the nickname 'The Honeypot' for reasons that have never been made clear to me!\n\nRonnie was an ex-army major (Kings 4th, Burma and India) and chose Tanganyika after he was sent to train KAR troops in jungle warfare. I think he thought he had died and gone straight to heaven! The farm was situated at 7,500ft and the only transport that could get up there was Dad's US Army Jeep and his horses!\n\nI was born in the European hospital in Arusha in 1948 and we went on to live near Voi and later near Korogwe, when I went to school up at Lushoto.\n\nOf course Arusha was not Arusha without it's share of scandal and Ma came to stay with the Swaffin's as she was running away from her first husband, Eric Hunt! I imagine she and Dad met at the New Arusha and the rest, as they say, was history!!!\n\nI last visited Arusha in 2004 when I climbed Kilimanjaro. The place was very changed and had lost its charm, but I hope to go back again within 2 years.\n\nKind regards, David Hamilton\n\nI was at Arusha school from about 1967-66 to 1969, and a few names I recognise, I think I remember Fe McIntyre and definately Danuta. I had a picture of Danuta holding a 'rounders' bat. I don't know if anyone remembers me. I was the one that fell down one Sunday, cut open my leg and they had to rush me to hospital and because of that, no one went for that 'Sunday' swim. It was all because I was racing to the dining room to get the cup of hot chocolate we always had on Sundays.\n\nI had a best friend named Dorothy and Linda (can't remember last names). Dorothy always took me home at half-term to her farm. I think her cousin was Micheal Rothbletz (not sure of the spelling) that I had such a crush on. Linda was the one that alway stuck up for me when someone teased me about being a P.Green or a Green P!!! I'd love to chat with anyone about those days. I remember Mr. Jones, the Headmaster and his daughter Peta. I think all the other teachers, except the music teacher, I'd like to forget. They were very cruel to us kids.\n\nDo you remember the 'Leek dish' we had and everyone hated it? We didn't eat it, so the next night we were served with no dinner! Jones wife was the cook. How many times were we locked in because we didn't shower quick enough? And those midnight feasts with a tin of Milo and saved sweets from the 'tuck cupboard'??\n\nIt has obviously been many years since I have visited the past. Not long ago I contacted Glyn Ford who put up the site on Kongwa School.\n\nIt is only now that I want to explain some of my childhood background to my children and grandchildren and find that a significant portion of that life for me and my brother and sister is missing.\n\nI remember in my first year at Kongwa going into the Nissan Hut that was the dining room. I had a very broad Glasgow accent - told to eat porridge that a senior put sugar on - refused - told to eat - and was promptly sick - I only ate porridge with salt!! I also remember the polio scare when we were all confined and not supposed to play active games.\n\nI remember playing building the stones - flatter the better - and knocking them over. Gee I'm getting old!!!\n\nSome happy memory's. Wearing my nightgown to the school dance - it was made of yellow cotton with green trim in the princess style - what the fundis could make in Tabora. Mr Shuttleworth's explanations in latin and history - he tried to make it fun.\n\nWhen I was older I swam in the school team and won a medal for diving - I played hockey (aggressively - I was short - still am, but have now hopefuly got over the 'short persons disease') Rembember the communal bathtubs (voluntary - somewhat - in later years fun pouring soapy water on concrete floors and sliding on it.\n\nPlease reply - I've had no response from my efforts to contact Kongwa ex pupils.\n\nI don't know my brother and sister's experiences - we never seemed to have a chance or inclination to talk about them.\n\n[My brother and sister attended Mbeya School on and off between 1952 and 1956. I attendede Kongwa between 1951 and 1956. Looking at both websites that I have found none of our names are mentioned. Can you tell me why?\n\nMbeya - Catherine Connell and William Connell Kongwa - Mary Connel]\n\nThank you for organizing this site.\n\nI was a student at Arusha School in l955 for the January term. Being the only American at the time, I was called Hank.\n\nMy family lived only 12 miles east of Arusha in the heart of Meru country on the old German Lutheran mission estate at Makumira, so I was a day student, often riding my bike home on the tarmac after hockey practise.\n\nMy father, Anton Nelson, a Californian, was hired by Meru Cooperative Union, a group of some 4000 African coffee growers. This unusual arrangement came about at the instigation of Kirilo Japhet, one of these Meru farmers. He is mentioned elsewhere on the site in connection with the Meru Lands Case. My father had met Kirilo and his lawyer Earle Seaton at the United Nations in New York City.\n\nOur European neighbors were the two with homes on the rim of Lake Duluti crater, the Fosbrookes and Gladys Rydon, both mentioned elsewhere on this site. Gladys was an Australian coffee estate owner and her home in view of Mt. Meru was ringed with a most beautiful flower garden. I have a photo her pouring tea on the veranda. I remember one tea in which Kirilo was in attendance. Kirilo by that time had become a rising star on the political firmament in Tanganyika. Both these strong personalities were the epitome of gracious interaction.\n\nAt Arusha School I remember fellow students Ian Fosbrooke, John Coutividis, Mary Wechsler and her brother Stephan, all mentioned in the l955 school magazine lists.\n\nIt would be fun to see a list of teachers, some of whom I've forgotten names. There was 'Lanky' Johnson, Nature Study, Mr. Morgan, algebra, Mr. Jones, French (taught this American to say 'Yes, sir'), a lovely young lady in music class who taught us to sing 'The British Grenadiers'.\n\nI took piano lessons from Mrs. Brewster and played in the end of term recital with Carolyn Pearson.\n\nI was on top of Mt. Meru with Mr. Morgan and the other Arusha School children.\n\nI was in Tanganyika for 7 years, before independence.\n\nAfter Arusha School I was at American schools for missionary children.\n\nHiya. Great site. Like everyone else that went to Arusha School it holds lots of fond memories and would like to hear from some old friends.\n\nI went to Arusha School from 64-69 as a boarder. I remember the I was in North House ( we had the green shirts and blue shorts house kit), the school uniform of the green shirts and khaki shorts and school cap. I still have the Arusha school badge ! I remember the school play that was held in the school field of the 'Three Wise Kings' for all the parents during an open day. The three Roman Centurians on horseback being frightened and then horses bolted to the river by the school whereby the horse riders were attacked by a swarm of bees. One of the riders was called Randy ? And had a brother also a rider (american).\n\nRemember the midnight pillow fights between the two houses north and south! My best friend then was Alan Angelides (He was in South, used to call him 'Bangeekookoo' !), I also remember Joleyne Van Veur Heusen ( my first girlfriend there). Still have her photo. Wendy Carter, Carl & Lalle Eckman, Charles Kahama, David Glen,Freddy Ringo to name a few.\n\nI remember also the huge Vine Tree by the Sports field which we all climbed and fell from !!! The Oak Tree trunk on its side that you could crawl into - those games of kiss catch !\n\nMy dad also went to Arusha between 1942-1944 (Marie-Pierre Tregarthen), then went onto Mpapwa College to do a 3 year Vet course with two others ex Arusha Mickael Hickson and Jimmy Miller.\n\nMy mother also attended Arusha School (1947-1952) as Yolah Maure (Along with her brothers and sister - Stanford (Stenie) Maure, Vernon Maure and Tessa Maure). My mum broke a lot of the school athletics records and her name should be on the School Boards. My mum then went onto Kongwa School.\n\nThere are so many other things I remember of the school like the lining up for school dinners (always loved the fish pie), the swimming pool, athletics and all the sports we did, school plays (remember I was the butler in you guessed it 'The Butler Did It',small part come on at the end and said 'It was me' ! Music lessons - hated them, escpecially the teacher !\n\nThe end of term School awards where if you did well during the term you were called up on stage and received awards from the school of Books (With the Arusha School Star Label inside it for whichever subject it was for). I still have those books, not many mind you !!!\n\nQiuck update, 49 this year, been married for twenty years s and have two daughters. Work in Shipping.\n\nAll the best / Jeff\n\ninclude_feedback: on\n\nDate: 05-Aug-2008\n\nIn November 2007 I organized and led a return 'safari' of my family and two 'extended family' members to northern Tanzania. It had been 25 years since I left my job as a teacher at Enaboishu Secondary School in 1982 to return to the USA. It had been 50 years since my two sisters had been back to see the area where they lived as children in the Usambara Mountains. Included in our group were my two daughters, the oldest of which was born in Nairobi when we lived in Arusha(1975).\n\nThe story of our 'return to our roots' is told with pictures in the 2nd quarterly edition of the TANTRAVEL magazine, the official magazine of the Tazania Tourist Board and it is available free of charge at any of their offices.\n\nWe spent the first part of our time in Tanzania in Arusha reconnecting with old friends and co-workers and then proceeded to Usambara via chartered Toyota Coaster type bus. The highlight of our visit to Usambara was the church service at Vuga, the location of our ten year tenure between 1946 and 1957. The people there had known of our plans for almost a year and were well prepared for us. After a nearly three hour service, during which the four Bolstad siblings, plus daughters and spouses sang three Swahili songs we had learned as children, and I was asked to give a greeting from the family (in Swahili), we were treated to an African style lunch in the buildings of the former printing press which my father had managed and which now were being used as a combination retreat and conference center and Bible School. Many emotional tributes were heard to our parents, who all remembered well and were truly loved by the people of Vuga.\n\nThe rest of the safari was sight-seeing: Lushoto and the fabulous Irente view, the Maweni Lodge at Soni, and then to Tanga and Pangani on the Indian Ocean coast. After returning to Moshi for a Thanksgiving dinner, African style with ndizi na nyama, we were back in Arusha and off to the game parks to see the world famous animals. Ndutu Lodge, Ngorongoro, Serengeti, and Tarangire were on the agenda and many wonderful animal pictures were the result.\n\nWe continue to re-live the experiences we had last November and get together to talk about it, looking at our best pictures. Last August we gathered at our parent's gravesite and placed eleven stones and some soil we had collected from the church site at Vuga. We continue to savor the memories of those days long ago and the more recent days we spent there.\n\nPaul Bolstad\n\nA friend of mine told me that she had found reference to me here through googling my name. I can only think that it is my sister and I that is being referred to here.\n\nMy mother was Elizabeth Reder (later Stadler then Forbes). We lived in Tanga where she had a shop. One maternal uncle was Paul Reder and lived in Moshi,the other of my mother's brothers ended up living in New Jersey in the U.S. where he had an outboard motor business, but I believe he had been in the motor business in Africa before going to the U.S.\n\nMy grandfather was Ferdinand Reder and my grandmother was Ella. I am not sure when they first moved to Tanganyika, but it was early in 20th century. His brother fought against the British in the First World War, when Tanganyika was still German East Africa. He lived to a ripe old age, in Tanga. My grandmother is buried somewhere in the Usambara Hills.\n\nMy sister's name used to be Barbara - she has changed it to Sharina. She now lives in Hawaii.\n\nI am, however, confused as I thought I had knowledge of all my cousins. William had three daughters, one of whom died young of leukaemia. I am in loose contact with his daughter Linda. I don't know where the third one is and I don't know about their children. Paul had a daughter, Pauline and a son, William. I think they are both still living in the U.K.I still use my maiden name and live in Cyprus.\n\nI would be interested in making contact with Susan as it sounds as though we must be related. Her letters would be interesting and I may have some letters, notes etc to help her research. My father's name was Alois Stadler.\n\nHello David,\n\nJust discovered one of your great websites - nTZ. I found it fascinating having lived in Tanganyika on and off from 1948-64 (Mwanza, Tabora (twice), Arusha and Dar (several times). Taught briefly at Soni (1961) and went to St Mary's in Nairobi (1949-60). It is an excellent, however, I have a couple of comments which you might find useful.\n\nIt is very well set up and the simple style excellent, once you get used to it. However, to the uninitiated it doesn't seem to have an obvious introduction ie 'home page'. I think this is a pity because I feel that some folks could come across the site and not having time to delve a bit deeper, could miss a lot and leave without contributing.\n\nWith some difficulty, I have now found what I think is the beginning - it's a bit like a treasure hunt and treasure it is! However, unless you have some very good reason (and maybe you have) it is a shame to miss those who, lacking persistance, might not have got so much out of it.\n\nNot long ago, at the Edinburgh branch of the Britain-Tanzania Association we had a meeting in which members and friends were invited to bring along books about Tanzania and talk for a few minutes about them (this included some of the authors of same). An interesting time was had by all and one member has compiled a bibliography. If you are interested, let me know and I shall pass the information on - you may get some additions to the site.\n\nI have a few books on Tanzania and in due course could let you have details if you wish. Some are quite old like the ones by the 'Hermit' from Rufiji, others booklets on game and the country published by such as Shell and one a classic entomology book by a famous tropical beekeeper (now in Australia but for many years in Tabora and Arusha).\n\nThe beekeeper has published several interesting books as has his wife.\n\nI don't have the authors of all the books to hand as I write this, neither have I had a chance to see if you already have them listed.\n\nOthers are about school days in Tanganyika and Kenya, one quite recent - the publishers hope to produce a follow up and may be looking for contributors. In the mean time, keep up the good work.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nJohn Goodman\n\nAfrica in common\n\nHi.we may be linked.my sisters went to arusha school then onto Loretto in Nairobi.
