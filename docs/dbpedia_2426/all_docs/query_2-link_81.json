        "text": "The couple got engaged in March 2024\n\nRupert Murdoch is a married man — for the fifth time!\n\nThe Fox and News Corp chairman, 93, married retired molecular biologist Elena Zhukova at his California vineyard and estate, Moraga, on Saturday, June 1, according to The Sun.\n\nAt the ceremony, Zhukova, 67, wore a form-fitting, mid-length white Emilia Wickstead dress with a square neckline, while Murdoch kept it simple in a black suit with a white button-down shirt and a pale yellow tie.\n\nThe newlyweds were photographed at the estate over the weekend.\n\nIn one of the images, Murdoch and Zhukova posed with their arms wrapped around each other. In another, they sat on a set of chairs while outdoors.\n\nThe Daily Mail reported that several \"high-powered\" people were in attendance at the event, including New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and News Corp chief executive Robert Thompson.\n\nAccording to the Moraga website, the secluded property is located in the Santa Monica Mountains in the Bel Air neighborhood.\n\nIn March 2024, The New York Times reported that Murdoch and Zhukova were engaged and planning to wed after they began dating the previous summer.\n\nThe pair met through Murdoch's third wife, Wendi Deng, according to The Daily Mail.\n\nBefore meeting Zhukova, the Australian native was engaged to Ann Lesley Smith, who formerly worked in radio, TV and print media.\n\nVanity Fair reported the exes called off their engagement just two weeks after the billionaire announced they were set to wed in his newspaper, The New York Post.\n\nRelated: Rupert Murdoch Set to Be Married for 5th Time, Engaged to Girlfriend Elena Zhukova\n\nMurdoch married his most recent ex-wife, Jerry Hall, in March 2016 in London. The model later filed for divorce in July 2022.\n\nThe media mogul married his third wife Deng just two weeks after he finalized his divorce from his second wife, Anna Maria Torv, in 1999. They have two daughters — Grace (born in 2001) and Chloe (born in 2003) — and divorced in 2013 after 14 years of marriage.\n\nTorv was Murdoch's wife for 32 years after their marriage in 1967. The exes have three children: daughter Elisabeth (born in 1968), son Lachlan (born in 1971) and son James (born in 1972).\n\nMurdoch welcomed his first child, a daughter named Prudence, in 1958 with his first wife, Patricia Booker. The couple were married from 1956 until they divorced in 1967.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
