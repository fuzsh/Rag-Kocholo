She was a friend of Madam French (Selina French) who along with Henry Dellaway ran the Haystack Public House and Kate would stay with her there. According to Iris White and Mary Dallas she was very involved with the social aspect of Canvey life when she stayed. Did she perform her songs at any of the venues? If anyone knows please put a comment below. Can anyone tell us about Madam French?\n\nKate Carney – Putney Vale Cemetery D5 No 47 – b 1869 d 1950 – buried with her husband and son."
