        "text": "I came across Daisy Blossom Elkan while researching my family tree. She is a distant cousin of my paternal grandfather. I was charmed by her name and intrigued by her transformation from what was apparently a conventional, middle-class Jewish girl, whose father was born in London’s east end and whose mother was an immigrant to becoming the wife of a member of the British aristocracy. All I knew was that she was born in the USA, brought up in Kilburn and St Johns Wood, married briefly to someone I had no information about, was a milliner and then in her 60s married an Honourable. Just how much could I find out? Daisy herself is almost invisible in the written record, although some of her great nieces and nephews are still living, would anyone remember what she was like?\n\nI have chosen to write about the people I can connect directly with Daisy; her family, partners, clients, employees and friends. These people themselves are almost lost to history. Nobody has kept their archives or their letters and remarkably few of them had families who have preserved a memory but they were energetic and distinctive characters, living in times of great change and challenge. Daisy’s story brings them together.\n\nThe Elkan Family\n\nDaisy was the second of four daughters born to Alexander and Amelia Elkan. The Elkan family can be traced back to Hamburg in Germany in the Eighteenth century, they were engaged in the tobacco industry in various ways, as importers and brokers, as cigar makers, as shopkeepers and salesmen. As far as can be traced they were never in poverty but their businesses had failures and successes and the family adapted to changing conditions, taking what opportunities they could to support themselves. When Alexander Elkan died on June 28 1924 and Amelia on 13 December 1929, each daughter inherited enough money to enable them to live comfortably and invest in their own families and businesses.\n\nDaisy’s father, Alexander Elkan arrived in New York City in 1865 at the age of 16. The oldest son of a London tobacconist, described as artistic and talented, he was seeking his fortune. It was the end of the American Civil War and New York was booming. The first sky scrapers were being built, immigrants from all over Europe were flooding to the city and the swamps and hills of Manhattan were rapidly being turned into housing and factories. The city was unsanitary with litter strewn cobbled streets, cheaply built accommodation which lacked ventilation and basic sewerage. Even so, fortunes could be made. Alexander got a job as a salesman of jewellery and fancy goods possibly working for the Josephi family. A family story tells how he first saw Amelia Josephi at a fancy dress party when she was dressed as a jockey in a scarlet tunic, sitting on a table swinging her legs and determined to marry her. [i]\n\nDaisy’s mother, Amelia was the daughter of Edward Josephi who with his brothers, had come to New York from St Petersburg, Russia and set up a jewellery business. By 1860 Edward and his wife, Sarah and their eight children were living in a $10,000 property on West 22nd Street and able to employ four servants. In 1862 Edward and his oldest son David, travelled by sea to gold rich San Francisco to open the California branch of their business. On the return journey Edward died when a fire on board caused the steamer Golden Gate to sink off the coast of Mexico. After her husband’s death, Sarah Josephi continued the jewellery business at 58 Nassau Street while David ran the San Francisco branch. Sarah and her daughters visited San Francisco in 1869 and shortly after they had all returned, Amelia and Alexander were married.\n\nAlexander and Amelia’s daughters, Mabel Pearl born in 1874, Daisy Blossom in 1876, and Blanche Maud in 1877 were born in Manhattan and by 1880 the family had moved to suburban Bayonne City, NJ where the youngest, Florence was born. Bayonne was formed as a township in 1861 and became a City in 1869. It had a boatbuilding and yachting industry while its farmers, fishers and oystermen supplied the nearby New York markets. Its hotels and beaches attracted wealthy New Yorkers, gaining it the epithet “Newport on the Hudson”. The area was becoming more urbanised and attracted many European immigrants with jobs in the developing oil refinery and other industries but in the 1870s and 80s it was an attractive place for successful New Yorkers to raise their families.\n\nAlexander travelled with a servant to London aboard the Adriatic in April 1875, which was probably his first visit home. His father, Isaac Elkan had died the year before and his sister Sarah, having recovered from financial difficulties in the year before their father’s death was running their business, Bewlay & Co. tobacconist and pipe retailer. Isaac and Rebecca Elkan had lived above their shop in The Strand but it was becoming less suitable for the sort of family lifestyle their children wanted. In December 1872, Isaac had been a member of a delegation of shop keepers petitioning the police to do something about the lawlessness and nuisance in the area which was driving away respectable trade. The Strand was at the heart of the night time entertainment economy in London with theatres and many drinking establishments. The delegation noted that between the Lyceum Theatre and Newcastle Street — a distance of some 700 yards, there were 11 public houses. They estimated this amounted to “2 gin shops for every 7 households” on the Strand. As well as drunkenness, the area was attracting vagrants, itinerant street traders and thieves. It was so bad that theatre owners had to employ linkmen to guide their clients to their carriages after a performance. Not surprisingly, there was a “constant parade of prostitutes” and hawkers selling indecent and sensationalist prints.[ii] Rebecca moved to St Johns Wood, a fast-developing residential area to the north-west of London.\n\nAlexander’s visit home would have coincided with the birth of his older sister Rachel and her jeweller husband, John Bessie’s eighth child and his sister Kate’s wedding to Frederick Jacobs, a pawnbroker and ship owner from Swansea. After attending to family and business affairs, he returned to New York and his young family at the end of the year. Things were changing. The American economy had suffered during the “Long Depression” (1873–1879), The Josephi’s New York business had ceased by 1883 and there was a further crisis in 1884 which saw the collapse of many New York banks. In London, the Elkan’s tobacco business was in need of new direction and it’s likely the family looked to Alexander to provide leadership and maybe some fresh American ideas. He and Amelia brought their family to England around 1884 in the City of Rome by way of Havana, where they made useful contacts amongst the cigar manufacturers. It took a while to establish a profitable business, Minnie took in sewing and Alexander supplemented his income by sketching portraits. However, he quickly formed a partnership with a neighbour, Frank Morris, to import cigars with a warehouse at 106 Fenchurch Street. Alexander also replaced his mother as director of the retailer Bewlay & Co. which maintained the shop in The Strand.\n\nThe Alexander Elkan family lived at various addresses in the St Johns Wood area, close to their relations and other well-heeled acquaintances. At least some of the girls may have attended The French School in Brondesbury Villas which was opened in 1887 by sisters, Louise and Alice Bocher. Advertisements for the school emphasised it was a day and boarding school with a homely atmosphere for “gentlemen’s daughters only”. French was taught “by an interesting and novel method by means of objects, facts & pictures, French in a French family”. Other subjects were, “English, languages and accomplishments, callisthenics, gymnastics and painting”[iii]. A Miss Elkan (likely to have been Florence) performed in a short play at a concert put on by the school in December 1889 in Kilburn Town Hall[iv].\n\nAlexander was a seat holder at the St Johns Wood Synagogue which had been established in 1876. As the area developed, the congregation grew rapidly and in 1882 it moved to a new building in Abbey Road where it remained until 1964. St Johns Wood was a founding member of the United Synagogue said by some to be the Jewish equivalent of the Church of England, mainstream orthodox, accommodating a range of views on liturgy and proudly British. Alexander’s brother John was on the Board of Management. In 1889, Mabel Elkan won a prize for Hebrew and Religion at the synagogue’s Sunday school and attended a prizegiving at Kilburn Town Hall with speeches made by the Rev. Dr Herman Adler, who became Chief Rabbi in 1891 and other rabbis and community leaders. Adler praised the religious education of girls and women of the ‘leisured classes’. Rev. Berman Berliner, the director of classes advocated being “good Jews and good Englishmen” [sic] and asserted you could only be happy if you were a true believer. Mr Alderman Phillips told the audience that Judaism taught good neighbourliness, virtue and moderation. Jews were to “earn their money fairly and not to hanker after luxuries”. Rev. Prof. Marks told the students that their hard work made them good members of the community, the “duties of women are at the root of society” and encouraged them to put their learning to use by teaching others.[v]\n\nDaisy’s elder sister, Blanche Maud Elkan, beautiful charming and sympathetic and an accomplished pianist and singer; married Lawrance Stanley Phillips early in 1899. He was, according to his son, Eric “a very down to earth and strong minded man”. Already established as a cigar importer, he became a director of Morris & Elkan. The families had been neighbours in the Strand and he probably always felt close to the Elkans. As Alexander and Amelia grew older, L. Stanley supported his wife’s parents and took the role of ‘man of the family’ with regard to his unmarried and widowed sisters-in law. It was he who was contacted when Mabel’s son Jack ran away from school to enlist in the First World War and in her will, Amelia noted his “support and many kindnesses”. Maudie and Lawrance had two sons, Frank and Eric.\n\nIn May 1908, Morris & Elkan was acquired by John Hunter Wiltshire & Co Ltd. for £25,000. The company was quoted on the stock exchange issuing 85,000 preference shares at £1 paying a guaranteed 7% dividend each. Alexander Elkan was the chairman of the new company styled as John Hunter, Morris & Elkan Ltd. as well as continuing his directorships of cigar and pipe retailers, Carlin & Co. and Bewlay & Co. When L Stanley Phillips, became managing director, he was keen to expand by acquisition and purchased the tobacco manufacturer, J. L. Van Gelder & Co and tobacco importer, Joseph Travers & Co. Ltd. In 1911 John Hunter Morris & Elkan acquired a controlling interest in Allones & Co of Havana which gave it a Cuban factory and the world-wide rights to the Ramon Allones brand of Havana cigars. Agencies were established throughout the world and sales flourished even when the First World War imposed restrictions on the import of cigars.\n\nOrdinary shareholders received a dividend of 10% throughout the 1920s although in 1921 high costs of production and taxation of profits caused the company to close a factory in Guildford and devise a plan to share any excess profits with its employees. This met with resistance from some shareholders who thought they would lose their annual bonus payments. As a result of the 1929 Wall Street Crash and following depression, the dividend for ordinary shareholders was reduced to 7.5% in 1930–31 and reduced again to 5% the following year. In 1933 the company reorganised its capital, paying the preference shareholders only a guaranteed 6% with no ordinary share dividend paid that year. The restructuring resulted in improved profits and dividend payments of between 3% and 6% continued until 1940.\n\nIn 1940 importation of Havana cigars was banned and when finally allowed in 1953 was subject to quotas and high import duty. John Hunter Morris and Elkan turned to importing cigars from India but there was a consolidation in the cigar market and a number of mergers and acquisitions which cumulated in ownership passing to the Freeman family who owned their arch rival J. Frankau & Co. L Stanley Phillips died in 1957 and Blanche in 1958. Their son, Frank Phillips went into the cigar business while his brother Eric became a civil servant.\n\nMabel Pearl Elkan, Daisy’s younger sister married Lionel Benjamin at Bayswater Synagogue on 17 September 1894. Lionel was a stockbroker and bullion dealer who had been born in Melbourne where his father David had property and business interests. Lionel’s wealth should have been secure when he inherited a large legacy on his father’s death in 1893 but he lost all his money on the stock exchange and that finished his banking career. Perhaps his marriage to Mabel was a means of financial salvation as by 1905 Lionel was also a cigar merchant, with a shop in Queen Victoria Street. The stress of business probably contributed to him having a nervous breakdown around 1914 and he was confined to a nursing home where he died in 1917. Despite his financial and psychological problems, he had regained his fortune and his estate was worth £23,997.\n\nMabel and Lionel had three children. Sybil, Eileen and Jack. The family’s demands caused a Runton, Norfolk lodging house keeper to bring a court action against them for loss of earnings in 1905. Mrs Benjamin had booked a sitting room and three bedrooms at one guinea per room per week for a month’s holiday and on the first night she asked for three baths to be filled with hot water in the space of 15 minutes. The landlady said this was not possible and Mabel lost her temper. Although there were no further problems, the Benjamins left after a week. The judge ruled in the landlady’s favour and awarded her £8 8s for three weeks lost earnings and costs[vi].\n\nIn September 1940 Mabel changed her surname by deed poll to Benham, although she and her son Jack had been using this name for some years prior to the formality. Eric Phillips, her nephew remembered her as “tall and rather stiff with a great concern for appearances”[vii]\n\nJack Elkan David Benham was born on 23rd July 1900. He was educated at Haileybury School. A boxer, athlete and member of the officer training corps, his academic results were poor and he failed to qualify to read engineering at London University. In 1915, he ran away from school to enlist but his housemaster telegraphed his mother and uncle and the next day he was found and brought back to school. Jack left Haileybury at the end of the Easter term 1918 and joined the Royal Air Force. He did his flying training in Egypt but was demobilised in March 1919 when he joined John Hunter, Morris & Elkan, becoming a member of the board in 1930. In 1934 L. Stanley Phillips agreed British marketing rights with Menendez y Garcia, the inventor of the Montecristo premium cigar. L. Stanley asked Jack to design a livery for the brand. Using the theme of Alexandre Dumas’s Count of Monte Cristo, Jack’s design was innovative and eye catching with the emblem of crossed epees surrounding the ‘fleur de lys’ in red and gold on a bright yellow background surrounded by a chequered strip.\n\nJack enjoyed “boxing, motorcycling… and knocking around with beautiful young ladies and all sorts and conditions of men”[viii]. He continued flying as a hobby, joining №600 Squadron (City of London) Auxiliary Air Force, based at RAF Hendon flying Avro Tutors. However, he left in 1932 and took up parachute jumping. Flight Magazine in its 27th June 1935 report of the Insurance Flying Club’s Party at Hanworth Park commented “The programme … included a parachute jump by Mr. J. E. Benham, who, it is said, recently found life rather dull after his previous experiences and so took up parachute jumping as a means of making life a little more interesting”. In the anticipation of another war, Jack re-joined the RAF in 1938. Described as 6 foot 2 ¾ inches tall with brown eyes and black hair going grey, he listed his abilities to drive a car, a lorry and a motor bike. He could swim, shoot, bicycle, fly, box, sketch and read a map. He gave his religion as Church of England and his occupation as company director with a private income. On 4th July 1940 he was posted as Chief Instructor at the newly formed Central Landing School at Ringway Airfield. Their job was to teach Commando Units, the Parachute Regiment and Special Operations Executive (SOE) Agents how to parachute jump and to perfect the equipment and adapt the aircraft which would be used. Jack’s commanding officer praised him for “writing the whole of the parachute training manual in his spare time, over and above doing the duty of Chief Ground Instructor” and making over fifty parachute descents. In August 1941 he was posted as Dispatch Officer, Tempsford Aerodrome, the home of the SOE squadrons 138 and 161. The SOE recruited, trained and inserted agents into enemy territory and the RAF provided the transport to fly the agents and their equipment. Wing Commander Jack Benham, Royal Auxiliary Air Force, was reported missing on 28th January 1942. He was on board a Whitley V Bomber No. Z6728, returning from an SOE operation over Belgium. Engine failure forced them to ditch twenty miles from the English coast and the crew presumably drowned. His name is recorded on the Royal Air Force Memorial at Runnymede in Surrey.\n\nJack’s sisters, Sybil and Eileen married two brothers, Charles and David Davis who were hat manufacturers. Eileen and David had a son, Michael in 1925 but Eileen died of pneumonia caused by neglect due to severe post-natal depression in 1931. Sybil and Charles also had a son, Richard born in 1924, and cared for Michael after his mother’s death.\n\nAs a young woman Daisy’s youngest sister, Florence Elkan, known as Flossie, took part in amateur concert parties for charitable causes. Described as “gay and naughty”, plump with fair hair and blue eyes. She is credited in 1903 as performing for member of the Jewish Working Men’s Club and Lad’s Institute and the East London Jewish Communal League at the Stepney Jewish Schools, and playing “Poppy” in the comic opera San Toy for the Charing Cross Hospital Improvement League. She was a member of an amateur troupe called The Londoners who performed Florodora at the Queen Street Theatre [ix] Excerpts from this performance were included in a programme attended by the Princess of Wales at the Queens Hall in aid of the Paddington Green Children’s Hospital in June 1903. Flossie reprised her role as “Lady Holyrood”. The reviewer in The Queen described the costumes rather than the dramatic performances, describing Flossie’s “large matinee hat with white ostrich feathers, feather boa and pretty summer toilette” and her second act “grey dress with a black hat surrounded with small flowers”[x] I wonder if this is early evidence of her sister, Daisy’s skill as a milliner and dressmaker.\n\nIn 1905 Florence married Max Paul Stettheimer, a tobacco merchant from Frankfurt am Main in Germany. They “wined and dined their way around London” and lived at the smart address of 62 Hamilton Terrace but by 1910 Max Paul had disappeared and Florence was living alone. Her father helped to arrange a divorce in Frankfurt in 1914 and she changed her name by deed poll to Mrs Florence Elkan. Max Paul Stettheimer remarried in Frankfurt in 1924 to Anna Maria Barbara Weldschmitt. In 1928 he was convicted in Germany of smuggling wines, spirits and cigars. He said he had obtained the goods via the wife of a member of the British Rhine Army occupying forces and had sold them to customers in unoccupied Germany.[xi]\n\nFlorence remained living in Hamilton Terrace until 1939 and developed a career as a breeder of pekingese dogs. She won prizes at dog shows across the country throughout the 1930s and the pedigree records her prize winners; T’su Ting, Tai Pan, Bimbo, Marigold, Wee Dah, T’sun Tsun, White Boi T’sun and White Boi of Fewling amongst others[xii]. According to her nephew, she loved entertaining wealthy gentlemen and embarking on intense but short lived friendships with women[xiii]. In the late 1930s a fellow Pekingese breeder, Walter Horace Weil and his partner Gertrude Johnson came to share her house at 26 Hamilton Terrace. Walter was a retired stockbroker who had been born in St Johns Wood and lived and worked in London until the First World War. In 1901–3 he had been involved in a series of court cases where he was accused of fraud and defaulting on payment for shares. After this he retired from the Stock Exchange but was the owner of several tenement properties in London and a Director of the newly rebuilt Adelphi Theatre. He provided financial backing for the popular musical theatre production Florodora. Around 1910 he separated from his wife and in 1911 was living in London with Gertrude Johnson. Weil and Johnson moved to Poulton le Fylde, Lancashire where Gertrude was known as Mrs Weil. They became leading members of the pekingese breeding community. Their Wun Dah of Chinatown was a seven times champion and sired a record breaking 15 full champions.[xiv] Walter was a judge of the breed and the couple travelled around Britain organising and attending dog shows. They could have met Florence through their theatrical connections or at dog shows and may even have been instrumental in her taking up dog breeding. Florence, Walter and Gertrude moved to Ewhurst, Surrey at the outbreak of the Second World War. One winter morning in January 1941, 78 year old Walter went out for a walk in nearby woods and dropped down dead. Gertrude did not stay living with Florence and this was the end of their dog breeding careers although Florence remained at By The Way in Somersby Lane, Ewhurst increasingly disabled due to arthritis, until her death in 1965.\n\nAged 22, Daisy ran away from home and married John Roberts at Paddington Register Office on 7 September 1899. Although he gave his occupation as brewer, John had been unsuccessful in that trade and was dependent on his father, Arthur Roberts. Arthur was a comedian and a superstar of the late Victorian and Edwardian music halls. Born in London the son of a tailor’s fitter who worked for Poole’s in Savile Row, Arthur started his career as a comic singer, giving up a job as a solicitor’s clerk to tour the country. Quick witted and talented, he developed various comic routines, silly walks, songs and characters. He invented the term ‘spoof’ and by the 1890s had his own company of music hall performers, was famous internationally and a very wealthy man. He benefitted from The Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII’s interest in the theatre and music hall and was invited to private parties and gentlemen’s clubs as well as touring the country maintaining his popular appeal. When he appeared in court to account for his son’s debts the judge was more interested in his jokes than his solvency. Arthur was a fan of horse racing and a gambler. His circle of friends included bookmakers and publicans, jockeys and trainers, and aristocratic followers of the sport of kings as well as music hall performers, theatrical agents and empresarios. His own financial situation had ups and downs, he often complained of being short of money or having to pay too much tax but he enjoyed a close family life at his large residence at 30 Maida Vale with his childhood sweetheart, Emma Veal and their two children, Emma Louise, known as Cissy and John.\n\nIn 1896 at the age of 21 John Roberts had purchased for £3,500 the Teign Brewery in Teignmouth, Devon from George Curtis who had operated it for many years. The steam brewery with an associated pub and dwelling dated from the 17th Century, selling the beer it produced at the adjoining pub and to local hotels. When John purchased the business there was only one employee, a young man who claimed to be the chief brewer. John appears to have had no knowledge of brewing or of business. Arthur Roberts had taken out a £4,000 mortgage for the purchase of the brewery and John was supposed to pay him back. Arthur paid the interest on the mortgage regularly but John made no money and “never paid him a thing”.\n\nIn 1897 John Roberts was fined for not declaring beer production properly for tax purposes. He was sued by a hop merchant for non-payment of invoices and by a local upholsterer who had not been paid for work commissioned by the brewery. John applied to his father for help. Arthur, who had already paid a total of £4,155 for his son’s venture, took over as owner and licensee and offered to repay his son’s creditors at 5 shillings in the pound.[xv]\n\nIn 1897 the brewery became the property of Arthur Roberts & Co. A manager, John Deane Brown was appointed and the business was recoopered and restocked. In an important case regarding the law about tied houses, Roberts and Brown applied for an injunction against a Mr Heaton, the landlord of the Royal Hotel, Dawlish who had agreed to buy beer only from George Curtis when he owned the Teign Brewery. Roberts and Brown argued that this was a contract with the brewery, irrespective of its ownership but the judge, while commenting on the deficiencies of the contract, refused to grant the injunction, allowing Heaton to buy beer from other producers. [xvi]\n\nDaisy, from a successful business family, might have been a good catch for John. Despite the difference in religion she was liked by her in-laws and perhaps her business sense could have won John some independence. However, he had tuberculosis which was already advanced at the time of his marriage. He died on 12 December 1899 when they had been married only three months. Arthur Roberts sold his interest in the brewery after John’s death. Daisy was left almost penniless and began working as a couture milliner. She stayed close to her mother and sister in law. She was listed in the 1901 census as living with the family at 30 Maida Vale[xvii] and was on holiday at the fashionable new Hotel Metropole in Brighton with Emma and Cissy in April 1908.\n\nEmma Roberts died in 1915. In his autobiography, Fifty Years of Spoof, Arthur, in financial difficulties and with his career in decline due to the growing popularity of moving pictures and radio, admitted to a period of loneliness and depression after his wife’s death. However, he married again in 1922 and his career revived in a touring “legends of music hall” show. He died in 1933.\n\nDaisy was recorded in the 1911 census living with her sister, Florence at 10 Hamilton Terrace. Her occupation is recorded as milliner and her status as an employer. Her parents and other sisters were all living close by and its likely she spent time helping and supporting her family when illness struck, babies were born or there were marital difficulties. She may well have designed and made the costumes for Flossie’s theatrical performances and this may be how she became a milliner, owning or managing a business as well as making hats herself. I cannot find out how she learnt this trade but Arthur Roberts had contacts with the high-end tailoring trade and the Elkans had relations and acquaintances who were involved in tailoring, dressmaking and millinery. She may even have gone to Paris for a time at one of the famous fashion houses such as Suzanne Talbot. By 1913 Daisy was fully independent and living in her own flat at 8 Newcastle House, Northumberland Street, Marylebone (now Luxborough Street).\n\nElsie Petre\n\nIn February 1914 Daisy Roberts became the chairman and managing director of the newly established court dressmaker and milliner Ann Talbot Ltd with premises at 5 George Street, Hanover Square and capital of £3,000 in partnership with the Hon. Mrs Albert Petre. All shares were owned by Daisy Roberts and the Hon. Katherine Elsie Emma Petre and both agreed to offer their share to the other if they decided to relinquish them or on the death of either partner. Although it is not known how they met, this relationship lasted until Elsie’s death in 1930.\n\nKatherine Elsie Clark was born in 1856, the eldest of the 13 children of William Robinson Clark the rector of St Mary Magdalen, Taunton, Somerset and his wife Elizabeth. William and Elizabeth separated around 1873 when she converted to Catholicism. William Robinson Clark emigrated to Canada in 1882 and had a distinguished career as the Professor of Moral and Mental Philosophy at the University of Trinity College, Toronto. He married twice more, and died in Toronto in 1912.\n\nElsie spent her girlhood engaged in the conventional activities of a clergyman’s family. As “a little girl” she laid the foundation stone for the St Mary’s National School in 1866, her father giving a speech about the benefits of education for all. With her siblings she was involved in running stalls at charity bazaars and raising funds for church decorations. At Christmas time in 1876 Elsie attended a fancy-dress ball in the London Hotel, Taunton dressed as “Kathleen Mavourneen”, the heroine of a sentimental song that was popular during the American Civil War[i]. She was chief bridesmaid, in “a beautifully embroidered dress”, at the wedding of her sister Margaret to Alan Summerly Cole in 1879. Alan was the son of Henry Cole, one of the founders of the South Kensington Museum (later the Victoria and Albert Museum) and was an expert in textiles, particularly lace. In 1881, Elsie, her mother and youngest sister, Hilda were living in Holdenhurst, Hampshire. Elsie married The Hon. Albert Petre, a stockbroker who was a son of Lord Petre in 1883 in Gibraltar. The Petres were an old and wealthy Roman Catholic landowning family, based in Essex. A week after her marriage while in Spain, on the way home, Elsie contracted typhoid fever and nearly died. She recovered slowly and then had their only son, Rupert in 1884. She didn’t fully take her role in society until May 1885 when she was formally presented to Queen Victoria. Thereafter, Mrs Albert Petre was a regular at court, herself presenting debutantes to the Queen and becoming a member of the Prince of Wales’s set. The Prince of Wales and his entourage enjoyed horse racing and during the 1890s Elise was seen at the major race meetings. The newspaper reports comment on the clothing of the ladies as much if not more than the performance of the horses and Elsie was a leader of fashion. She was spotted in October 1890 at Kempton “in a smart blue serge gown braided in gold”[ii], in March 1892 at Sandown “in black with a large black hat trimmed with black feathers and point de venise lace”[iii], and in July 1892 at Sandown wearing a “black ground covered foulard with waistcoat of chaudron crepe de chine”[iv]\n\nElsie and Albert had no children who survived childhood, there was a stillborn baby in 1893 and Rupert Petre died aged 11 in 1895 while in France. The couple remained married and at least officially living at the same address in Kensington but appear to have led increasingly separate lives. It was rumoured that Elise was one of Edward VII’s many mistresses, she was certainly a close friend and gained the epithet “Queen of Marienbad”. However, Elsie maintained good relations with the wider Petre family. Henry Petre, Albert’s half-brother brought her an expensive birthday present and in 1899, Elsie’s younger sister Audrey married Albert’s nephew, Bernard who was the 14th Baron Petre. The birthday present from her brother-in-law was the cause of a court case brought by Mr Arthur Pitson, a goldsmith and jeweller against the executors of the Hon. Henry Petre’s estate in 1900. Pitson had lent emerald and diamond ornaments to Elsie for two state occasions in 1899. When she returned the ornaments the second time, she told him that Hon. Henry Petre wished to buy them for her as a birthday gift and he would pay £1200 in four quarterly instalments. However, Henry died before he could pay the final amount and his executors refused to pay because Henry’s second wife, Sophie said that although she had the invoice and receipts for three payments, she knew nothing about the jewels. Pitson said in court that Sophie had a case pending against Elsie to have the jewels returned. The judge found in favour of the jeweller but it’s not recorded if Sophie ever obtained the jewels.[v]\n\nAlbert and Elsie had attended the wedding of the actor, Charles Hawtrey to Madeleine Sherrife in June 1886. Hawtrey, who eventually became Elsie’s second husband, was a close friend and after Edward VII’s accession to the throne, was often at her side at Marienbad where the King and members of the British aristocracy took the waters every summer. Another Marienbad visitor described Elsie “Warm hearted, humorous and wise, she rarely led the talk but possessed to perfection the art of keeping it alive. Her great joy was to listen to Charles Hawtrey at his favourite amusement of mimicking the person to whom he happened at that moment to be talking”[vi]. Marienbad was a relaxed resort, the routine comprised of early walks to take the waters, conversation and refreshments at cafes, golf, massages and other treatments and a regime of light meals. In the evenings, there was a theatre and regular concerts as well as bridge parties but the cure was the priority and everyone had an early night. Edward VII visited Marienbad every year during his reign, using the time in Europe to conduct diplomacy and maintain good relations with foreign politicians and royalty, most of whom were related to him.\n\nIn England, Edward VII and his queen, Alexandra revived court social life with formal Courts and state balls as well as royal visits to notable stately homes, the theatre and sporting events. Mrs Albert Petre was reported in June 1905 at Ascot in “black with a black straw toque trimmed with long sweeping white plumes[vii]” and with her husband at a state ball in honour of King of Spain. In October 1906 she was at Newmarket in a severe tailor-made dress and at Court in 1908 wearing “a gown of white satin veiled with tambour lace and trimmed with long lines of silver embroidery terminating in a fringe of silver. The corsage arranged with graduated waist belt of diamond embroidery and on the shoulders true lovers’ knots in diamonds finished with diamond fringe. Train of cloth of silver embroidered with roses in silver tissue”[viii]. She was at Newmarket in October 1908 wearing “dull heliotrope shantung with feathers to match her heliotrope hat[ix]” and in November she was at Newbury races in “brown and black checked cloth with a fur coat and large brown hat decked with clipped brown and grey ostrich feathers”[x].\n\nElise and her sister Margaret Cole, became members of a committee established to obtain new patters for the use of lace makers so as to revive the Irish lace industry. Alan Cole documented the committee in his 1888 publication, A Renaissance in Irish Lace Making. It raised subscriptions from a group of wealthy and titled individuals and institutions concerned with textiles, held competitions and awarded prizes for patterns, funded production and exhibited examples of lacemaking. After the Great Potato Famine, Irish lacemaking had largely been preserved in convents which Alan Cole and his colleagues on the committee visited and encouraged teachers and designers to attend courses at the South Kensington Museum. Lace was often a feature of the gowns and dresses that Elsie wore to state balls and other court occasions. She was a supporter of women’s education more generally. In Feb 1905 she participated in tableaux vivants with many famous people at the Savoy Hotel in aid of The Circle a proposed meeting place for women involved in education or literary work.\n\nElsie’s oldest brother William Clark (later William Lyon-Clark) went to Bengal where he became a successful tea planter. He married in 1884 in Cachar, Assam and had five sons but divorced in 1896. William returned to England with his sons in the early 1900s and established himself into the landed gentry of North Devon. He played polo, keeping ponies and playing for various local sides and was on the committee of the Devon Large Black Pig Society. He married again in 1909. Nellie, his wife, was presented at Court, sponsored by his sister, Audrey in 1911 and they had one son. In 1913 they moved to Kingston Bagpuize in Berkshire where William held office as Assistant Commissioner of the North Berkshire Boy Scouts and they participated in hunt balls, garden parties and the other pursuits of county society before this marriage also broke down. The 1916 divorce petition alleged he had been physically and psychologically violent, causing Nellie to miscarry, refusing to speak to her, harassing and stalking her as well as committing adultery on numerous occasions.\n\nWilliam Lyon-Clark was one of the four directors of Ann Talbot Ltd. He was also, along with their sister Hilda de Windt, a witness at Elsie’s second marriage to the actor Charles Hawtrey in 1919. William married for the third time in 1928 and he and his wife Irene lived, apparently happily in the South of France until his death in 1934. He was an executor of Elsie’s will.\n\nAfter King Edward VII’s death in 1910, the new King George V adopted a more restrained attitude to court life and without its Royal patronage the fashionable status of Marienbad declined. Elsie’s life changed, although she continued to play golf and attend parties. Her last visit to Marienbad was in August 1913 when she was seen playing golf with Charles Hawtrey and others.\n\nThroughout the Edwardian period, wealthy women began to pursue careers that were in addition to their duties in society and in running their households. A 1910 article in the Tatler reviewed the trend. “ Twenty years ago Lady Granville Gordon started a hat shop in Park Street, Grosvenor Square … Mrs Maxwell Heron called herself Madame Rita and joined the once world famous firm of Elise in Regent Street” [i] The article also notes more recent examples of society milliners and dressmakers including Mrs Jack Cumming “well known in the racing set” with a shop, Machinka in Dover Street, Countess Tabbricotti in Park Street, Lady Rachel Byng trading as Levana, Hon. Mrs Turnour, Mrs Bertie Dormer (Olivette), Hon. Lady Hervey-Bathurst and Lady Moira O’Brien in Sloan Street. Following these examples and no doubt using her reputation as a leader of fashion and her knowledge of design, in January 1914, Elsie went into partnership with Daisy Roberts and established herself as a court dressmaker with the company name of Ann Talbot Ltd.\n\nThe Hon. Albert Petre died in 1917 but Elsie’s social life continued and she spent time with a “modern” set of younger men and women who spent time playing cards and living in less formal circumstances. Her generosity and perhaps a certain carelessness with money was the cause of a minor scandal when she accused a friend of stealing. The accused, Miss Hilda Honywood, brought a counter claim of libel and the case went to court. “Mrs Katherine Elsie Emma Petre sued the London County Westminster and Parrs Bank Ltd to recover £100 wrongly paid to Miss H. Honywood, a secretary to a bridge club in Kingston Hill”. On June 19 1918, Elsie and Hilda shared a cab with another lady, Marjorie Higgins from a card playing session at Coombe Oak, Kingston Hill to London. When they got to the Brompton Road, Elsie asked Hilda to go into the bank and pay £20 into Elsie’s account while she went into a hairdresser’s shop. Later she found a cheque for £100 had been cashed. Hilda Honywood disputed the accusation that she had forged the cheque and kept the money. In the witness box, Elsie said she had not given Hilda a blank cheque and anyway did not get the £100, she only realised money had been removed from her account a month or so later when she was checking her pass book. She believed Hilda was guilty of theft and had asked Charles Hawtrey to intervene. Elsie said she had cheques from Charley Hawtrey from time to time, as payment of returns on an investment made by her late husband in a play put on by Hawtrey. She admitted she had a cheque from him at the time, which was paid in on the 20th it was not cashed on the 19th She also said she lent money to Hawtrey, a habitual gambler, from time to time.\n\nCharles Hawtrey told the court he had known Elsie for 30 years and also knew Hilda. He had been at the cards party on the 19th. When she discovered the loss, Elsie showed him the cheque book and he had asked Hilda to come and see him about it. Hilda told him she couldn’t remember what she’d done but whatever it was at the request of Elsie. Charles then called on Hilda at Baron de Forests’ house, Coombe Hurst at Kingston Hill and told her Elsie thought she’d forged the cheque and kept the money. Hilda said it was “a blasted lie” Elsie had asked her to cash the cheque and had signed it in the cab. The bank manager had asked to whom he should make the cheque payable and she said “whoever you like, to me will do” She gave the notes to Elsie back in the cab. She told Charles that she would fight, it was Elsie’s word against hers. Charles offered to lend her money so she could pay Elsie back but she refused and said she was entirely innocent. Hawtrey said he knew Hilda gambled at Chemin de Fer and sometimes lost considerable amounts. He knew her well and addressed her as “My dear Honey”\n\nMiss Hilda Honywood was the daughter of Sir John Honywood Bt., mayor of Ashford in Kent. The court report gave her age as 27 but she was actually born in 1886, making her 32 in 1919. She was living at 27 Westminster Palace Gardens, Artillery Row, Westminster. Her testimony described how Elsie had asked her to cash a cheque and given it to her in an envelope. When the bank manager opened the envelope, he found the cheque was signed but not otherwise filled in. He asked Hilda what to do and she said “make it out to whoever you want. I will do” The manager filled it in and made it payable to her, she endorsed it and when the manager asked how she wanted the cash she asked for £10 notes which she gave to Elsie right away. Talking of her relationship with Hawtrey she said she called him Charles and he called her “Honey”. Charles had told her that Elsie said she’d forged the cheque. He told her to pay the money back and no one would ever know, he offered to lend her the money but she was furious because she was innocent. She had a small income of £50 per year from a landed estate in Kent and earnt around £2 per week as a chauffeuse. Mr Keiller of Charles Street had been making presents to her for 3 or 4 years “for a very special reason” that amounted to £300 per year. Hilda was secretary of a bridge club and played cards every day, mostly winning. She also played chemin de fer, winning and losing “heaps” but never staking more than she could afford to lose. She had been involved in motor ambulance work with Lady Forbes and had handled money associated with this. Her honesty was supported by evidence from the Earl of Wemyss who was the treasurer of the ambulance charity. The Judge decided nobody had acted fraudulently, the bank acted with Mrs Petre’s authority, she must have “mis-recollected” the events and had therefore not perjured herself. Hilda was innocent. Charles Hawtrey was thanked for the attempt to clear the matter up. The case was settled “to the satisfaction of all” [ii].\n\nHilda Honywood was an example of the changing roles of upper-class women in the wake of the First World War in that she lived alone, could drive and worked for at least some of her living as a chauffeur, and openly gambled. The Mr Keiller of Charles Street who paid her for “a very special reason” was Alexander Keiller, a former Royal Naval Air Force officer, racing driver, skier and archaeologist who was later responsible for excavations at Avebury and Windmill Hill. In 1915 he had separated from his first wife and no doubt Hilda was the co-respondent in his 1918 divorce. Hilda never married and died in 1952.\n\nElsie Petre and Charles Hawtrey were married later in 1919. The wedding announcement was an occasion for reminding society that Elsie was “Ann Talbot” but after this, her involvement in the company was less active, although her social prominence and wealthy friends were an asset. After Elsie and Charles were married, she was known as Mrs Charles Hawtrey, and later when he was knighted, she resumed the title Honourable. They lived happily until Charles’s death in 1923. After she was widowed, Elsie gradually resumed life as a party goer. The Bystander commented on a dinner party held at her “pleasant little Georgian house” Elsie was “as full of energy as ever… she is the most indefatigable woman in London”[i]. She was a member of Toby’s Club in Bruton Street Mews and only months before her death, took the role of a herald in an amateur production of Cinderella put on and filmed by members. The reporter said her performance was “worth coming some miles to see”[ii]. On 14 Nov 1930, aged 74 she died of a heart attack at her home in Hertford Street. The Bystander’s obituary noted her energy and generosity “Until a few weeks ago she was playing golf and attending dance parties and not only enjoying herself but seeing that those with her enjoyed themselves too. Yet she never made herself ridiculous and always had that curious dignity… she was one of the wittiest women I ever met… and had an extremely kind heart”[iii] Her funeral was attended by a mixture of family, society theatrical friends including the sometime playwright and empresario Arthur Eliot who was to become Daisy’s brother-in-law.\n\nAnn Talbot Ltd\n\nCourt dressmakers and tailors had authorisation from the Lord Chamberlain to provide costumes and regalia for ceremonial occasions, most particularly the royal Courts where aristocratic debutants and newly married women were presented to the Queen. The male equivalent, the Levee was an occasion for men to wear uniforms and robes of office so the speciality of court tailors was knowing the exact requirement for each rank, regiment, diplomatic and civil position. For women, the Lord Chamberlain and the Queen would ask a famous dressmaker to provide some suggestions for designs and the Queen would decide on the different models for young women and older women. All the court dressmakers could then work to those models, while creating individual interpretations for their clients. This favoured UK designers and was supposed to keep a lid on extravagance, maintaining a sense of quality and dignity at court. It did mean that jewellery was at least as important as dress for displaying wealth and individuality.\n\nBefore the turn of the 20th Century court dressmakers and tailors largely concentrated on regalia and ceremonial dress with aristocratic families employing their own dressmakers for the round of social events outside of court. In the post war period, the number of London dressmaking companies increased with both experienced dressmakers and aristocratic women investing in and in some cases designing, women’s clothing, floristry and millinery. Lady Duff Gordon (Lucile) was the pioneer in this field in the early 1900s. Other court dressmakers evolved from tailoring firms which often specialised in day wear and sporting apparel. Although the association with “trade” was still thought to be improper for a true aristocrat the barriers that were rigidly applied in Victorian times were being eroded with the elevation of many wealthy businessmen to the peerage and it was often their wives who as well as being customers, were enterprising and business minded and took advantage of one of the few areas where married women could be acknowledged as experts and play a full role in business earning their own independent income. There were around 90 to 100 court dressmakers based in Mayfair, around Hanover Square and Berkeley Square alone. In 1924 when the industry was at its peak, court dressmakers represented 33% of all dressmakers in London.\n\nThe court dressmakers were busiest during the London Season when as well as attending the royal courts, society women needed ball gowns, outfits for the theatre, dinner parties, gallery openings and sporting events. “Dressing was a costly, highly considered and time-consuming business”[i]. A court dressmaker understood the precise details of British dress codes and would ensure her clients did not embarrass themselves with a sartorial faux pas. They also made wedding gowns, day wear and specialist items which, although based on a sample design, often imported from Paris, would be altered to fit the specific client and to appear unique to her. In the Edwardian era the concept of going to the dressmaker as part of a lady’s social life took hold. Court dressmakers established their shops as salons where clients could meet, take refreshments and view the latest fashions. “Hanover Square [would be] filled with waiting carriages and there were usually little groups of spectators waiting to see the notables”[ii]. As well as royalty and other titled ladies, the wives and daughters of millionaires, foreign nobility, singers, actresses, and other celebrities were to be seen.\n\nCourt dressmakers employed women in fairly large numbers, some within the showrooms as designers, sales women, models, management and administration staff and of course numerous seamstresses, embroiderers, milliners, apprentices and finishers in workrooms at the back or in the basement. In the 1920s the job of model or mannequin became attractive to young women who could earn some money while wearing the best dresses, being photographed and invited to parties. Excellent movement as well as a slender figure was essential and finishing schools began to offer lessons in modelling alongside the more traditional curtseying and deportment. Models were directly employed by the dressmakers and much of their work was showing the garments to clients privately in the showroom. Although would be models often had to pay to start or work for nothing for a while, their earnings could rise to 23 shillings a week. There were newspaper reports that mannequins were too slender and customers could not fit into the dresses shown. Some dressmakers resorted to tricks like making the dress to the exact measurements of a particular client, and pinning it to make it fit the slender model. The pins were removed before Madame tried it on so she got the perfect fit and was flattered into purchasing.\n\nLucile had invented the fashion parade with live models in 1902. She envisaged the parade as “entertaining as a play”, had programmes printed and invited the select guests. By the 1920s these events became part of the social season for the invited audiences of the rich and famous, valued customers and the press. They initially involved large meals, lavish decorations and musical entertainment as well as the parade of models showing off the latest fashions and jewellery. As these parades became more common the catering was reduced and other innovations were introduced such as having an actress or titled lady introduce the designs, having two models show the same garment and having morning and evening events. Fashionable women found they were rushing from one parade to another during the season and didn’t have time for lavish hospitality.\n\nCourt dressmakers employed expert fitters a well as designers and experienced seamstresses. Clients’ measurements were carefully recorded and some garments, whether imported from Paris or designed in house were displayed as samples from which the customers could select a style and fabric. The dressmaker would then receive the measurements and design instructions and have to carefully measure the expensive materials so the garment could be made. It was the dressmaker hands’ responsibility to produce the finished item. This often involved using their skill and creativity to make a design into something wearable and to fit the measurements of every bump and curve of the client’s body. Designers might focus on the detail of the front of a gown but only provide minimal sketches for the back so a skilled dressmaker could use a lot of creativity.\n\nOften a theatrical producer would contract a court dressmaker to make costumes for the principals of a west end show or play. In which case the dressmaker would have to attend the theatre to make any repairs to the costumes and help dress the performers. This was an attractive job in the fashion heart of London, working with the finest materials for an exclusive clientele. Although this was a skilled workforce with reasonable rates of pay for experienced needlewomen and sales staff, working conditions were poor, employment unreliable and pay low for the less skilled in the industry. While the exceptionally well-paid millinery workshop manager working for FJ and L Wilson of Hanover Square in 1913 earned £860 per year[iii] the average for a skilled dressmaker — a ‘first hand’ or workroom supervisor — in an elite establishment was more like £120 a year. Assistants’ wages ranged from £30 to £70.\n\nThe court dressmakers operated in a competitive market, not only in London but they competed with their counterparts in Paris, some of whom also opened branches in London. Materials and trimmings were expensive and although their clients were rich, they were often slow to pay their bills. There was considerable turnover of businesses entering and leaving the market. With advertising restricted to discreet descriptions in women’s magazines and word of mouth amongst the elite, attracting a sizable and prominent clientele was vital.\n\nAnn Talbot Ltd. was registered as company number 133842 on 9 February 1914. Its business premises were at 5, 6 and 7 George Street, Hanover Square (now St George Street) and its purpose was court dressmaker. It had capital of £3,000 by means of 1,500 one-pound preference shares and 1,500 one-pound ordinary shares. Daisy Roberts was the chairman and managing director. When Ann Talbot was first established the company began by designing costumes for the stage which, in the relatively drab times of the First World War, was a good way to have the clothes written about in the newspapers and illustrated magazines and seen by potential clients without being accused of unpatriotic extravagance. Elsie Petre was able to use her connections in the theatrical world as well as her connections at court. Ann Talbot Ltd. came to prominence when the futurist inspired costumes for the play Things We’d Like to Know which opened on the 18 March 1914 at the Apollo Theatre got almost as much press as the play itself. The Manchester Courier for example said. “The mantles and hats designed by Mrs Petre who recently set up business as Ann Talbot in Hanover Square, and worn in the play by Dorothy Minto and Helen Hayes are very good work and strongly futurist… It is said that\n\nAnn Talbot already has a large clientele[iv]”. Describing Miss Minto’s dresses it continues “One in pink taffeta lightly shot with mauve of Futurist style for the afternoon … the bodice cut all in one is veiled with ivory shadow lace caught at the back of the neck with black velvet bows” and for the evening “A Futurist picture frock in white taffeta”. Miss Helen Hayes, playing the heroine’s aunt, wears “a black lead hat trimmed with two black feathers crossing at the edge of the shiny brim”[v]. Other theatrical costume credits for Ann Talbot were Please Help Emily at the Playhouse Theatre in January 1916, The Boomerang at the Queens Theatre in May 1916, Anthony in Wonderland at the Sphere Theatre in February 1917 and in May 1917 Wanted: a husband at the Playhouse Theatre starring Gladys Cooper.\n\nEvents to support the war effort and charitable causes were another means of attracting the attention of potential customers and establishing the company’s good reputation as a patriotic British business. Ann Talbot Ltd did their part by donating dresses for sale at a grand bazaar at the Albert Hall in aid of St Dunstan’s Fund for blinded servicemen. The bazaar was opened by Queen Alexandra and many titled ladies as well as society magazines such as The Tatler and The Bystander and even the Prime Minister, Lloyd George donated items and managed stalls. The dresses, worn by models were paraded during the event.\n\nThe company recapitalised in 1919 issuing 18,500 ordinary £1 shares to bring the total to £21,500. In addition to Daisy and Elsie Petre, the other board members were Elsie’s brother Major William Lyon-Clark, and Mr Charles Albert Radermacher, a chartered accountant. Daisy had control over the appointment of directors and was managing director, taking all the day to day business decisions. The company advertised for skilled and assistant dressmakers ready for the full resumption of high society and court events.\n\nIn 1916 Daisy moved from her flat in Northumberland Street to 91 New Cavendish Street and had a telephone installed when telephone ownership was still unusual for private individuals. She moved again in 1917 to Flat C De Walden Court, 85 New Cavendish Street. This was a spacious apartment with dining room, drawing room, three bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom and a servant’s bedroom in an elegant art nouveau building on the corner of new Cavendish Street and Hallam Street in Fitzrovia. Daisy could walk to work in George Street within 10 minutes. In 1924 she moved to 41 Hill Street, Mayfair. Here she owned the first-floor apartment and also some rooms on the second floor. She employed a maid, Emily Reeves who was to stay with her until the 1940s and remain a friend for life.\n\nSome early Ann Talbot designs worn by Miss Emilie Grigsby (1876–1964) are held in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Considered to be one of the great international beauties, with extremely pale, almost transparent skin and golden hair, her clothes were purchased from couturiers in London, Paris, and New York, and demonstrated an elegantly avant-garde approach to style. Emilie had been the mistress of the railroad tycoon Charles T Yerkes who built her a mansion in New York where she kept collections of scientific instruments, furniture, books and jewellery. She had visited London with Yerkes when he had interests in the building of the London underground railway and became a frequent visitor to Europe. After Yerkes’ death, with her reputation making it impossible for her to reach the highest ranks of New York society and after a being named in too many scandals, Emilie sold up and moved permanently to England in 1912. She was not welcomed by the court, but at her Mayfair house, 80 Brook Street, she entertained distinguished soldiers, poets and artists including William Butler Yeats, and Auguste Rodin. The New York Times stated “Society was nervous of accepting her but she could out-entertain her rivals with wines and cooking beyond their ken,” Rupert Brooke, the poet, “spent his last night in England at [her country cottage] Old Meadows and the lines he wrote in the visitors’ book were afterwards engraved in bronze over the door.”\n\nIn the First World War Emilie helped to raise funds for wounded soldiers, sponsoring a theatrical pageant at the Shaftesbury Theatre in 1917 but she specialised in comforts for the most senior officers. Her Sixteenth Century country cottage in West Drayton was a welcome retreat for Field Marshalls Sir John French, Lord Kitchener and General Sir John Cowans, who was Emilie’s lover. “At her country cottage, Old Meadows, … French and Kitchener met there for a quiet dinner while sentries ensured seclusion”. She was known as “the mascot of the High Command”. Emilie also benefitted from a close friendship with Lieut. Col. Mackay Mackay, the Assistant Provost Marshall of the Western Command, based in Chester who visited Old Meadows “almost every weekend”. Mackay was court marshalled in 1918 for arranging for soldiers under his command to work as gardeners and chicken keepers for Miss Grigsby. He had also arranged for soldiers to work as chauffeurs, waiters and gardeners for his other wealthy acquaintances and at his London club when they should have been on military duties. The soldiers wore civilian clothes and received their army pay as well as what they were paid for their unofficial work while the army paid for their travel to and from Chester[vi]. Perhaps the soldiers were more honest that the local gardener that Emilie had engaged in 1914 who was convicted of stealing the vegetables he had grown because he said his 25 shillings a week wages were insufficient for his needs.\n\nEmilie was friendly with the American actress Miss Doris Keane, attending the premier of her performance in Romance in 1915 and staying with her in Paris in 1923. She lent money to the Duke of Leinster in 1933 but he was insolvent and she sued him for the repayment of £2000. In 1939 Miss Grigsby “red haired and hospitable with an endless fund of reminisces” was showing off her art collection in her flat in Park Street, Mayfair and remembering for the gossip columnists how Auguste Rodin stayed with her at Brook Street during the First World War and was inspired by her collection of Roman sculptures[vii]. Emilie travelled to India where the Rajah of Jaipur is said to have unsuccessfully proposed marriage and given her a diamond studded cigarette case. She returned to America and, due to travel restrictions, spent the Second World War there before returning to England, where she continued to live in style, although without the funds, until her death in 1964. When she died, she left her clothes to her maid who had no use for them so they were acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum where they form a significant part of their 20th Century costume collection.\n\nAnn Talbot’s theatrical commissions continued with Enter Madame written by and starring Gilda Varesi, at the Royalty Theatre in 1922, Billeted, starring Athene Seyler, The Awful Truth at the Royalty in 1926 and Autumn starring Flora Robson and a young Jack Hawkins at St Martins Theatre in 1937. The other major publicity activity fashion parades, had become commonplace by the late 1920s so there was competition to attract attention. Novelties such as fashion parades at horse racing meetings, celebrity announcers and ever more lavish and expensive dresses were necessary. In 1928 Ann Talbot made the most of its British credentials and partnered with the National Jewellers Association of Great Britain to stage the Jewel Song Parade which rivalled the attractions of a similar parade of Paris fashions organised by Nancy Cunard and was intended to launch a campaign to have London recognised as the international centre of fashion. In a scenario worthy of a heist movie, scores of fashionable guests were locked into the ballroom of the newly opened May Fair Hotel for the afternoon of 4 December 1928 with guards to ensure nobody left before the £2,000,000 worth of jewels on display had been safely locked away at the end of the show. Not only was the parade a celebration of British design, it was also intended to show the correct relationship between jewels and frocks for different occasions. The very fashionable wife of the Minister for Transport, Mrs Wilfrid Ashley was hostess and said “The creative British dress designer is in every way the artistic equal of the Parisian”. The event was written up in the illustrated papers and there were articles in many provincial newspapers. Publicity was further enhanced by the heart-warming story of the choice of a London pavement artist to make an artistic record of the event, although there is no evidence of his work.[viii]\n\nThe show was opened with a rendition of Marguerite’s Jewel Song from the opera, Faust, sung by Miss Olive Goss while she “fondled an almost priceless pearl and diamond necklace, emerald bracelets and other gems lying in a golden casket”. The parade took the form of “a day in a woman’s life” showing clothing appropriate for different times of the day with jewels chosen to complement the colour and style of the garments. The morning section included a pink satin and ecru cobweb lace boudoir gown and cap with emerald and jade jewellery. A red stockinette morning dress and three-quarter length coat trimmed with beaver fur was worn with ropes of blue beads. The afternoon dress of black velvet with diamond accessories was followed by a black panne evening gown with a diamond buckle side fastening and a coat trimmed with ermine while the bed time outfit was a pair of Turkish style bright red satin pyjamas and a multi-coloured coat edged with sable, worn with gold and enamel jewellery. The Sketch explained for readers the scientific colour theory behind the next section, a choice of contrasting jewels and fabric colours which informed a selection of evening dresses and jewels. An orange chiffon evening gown was complemented by a long turquoise necklace, lime chiffon was worn with pearls, yellow satin with platinum and sapphires, a red chenille gown was complemented by diamonds and emeralds and an amethyst embroidered velvet and net by rubies. The bride in a white satin frock tied with a sash and accompanied only by diamonds was “a triumph of simplicity”. The final mannequin represented a view into the future. “The 1950 Girl” wore a black lace gown with diamond shoulder straps and diamond bracelets “like long scintillating snakes” wound around her bare arms. The gown was slashed to the knee to reveal a diamond garter on her silk stockings. A coronet and long diamond earrings completed the vision of a glittering future.[ix]\n\nIn 1929, Ann Talbot Ltd. was occupying parts of three buildings in George Street and when the opportunity came, they moved to a whole house at 35 Berkeley Square. This had been the home of Stephen Courtauld. When the Courtaulds moved to Portland Square, the ground floor had been converted into a milliner’s shop owned by an Australian, Mrs Mabel Meillon. Ann Talbot Ltd. purchased the 6,000 sq. foot leasehold property for £5000 at auction on 4 December 1928 with vacant possession and Mrs Meillon returned to Melbourne.\n\nThe six-storey house had 4 reception rooms, 9 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms with servants’ quarters, kitchen and storerooms in the basement. There was an electrically powered lift, heating and hot water system. Ground rent was £1600 per annum. The Courtaulds had also built a two-storey picture gallery in the back garden. Alterations were made to convert the gallery into a showroom with a covered passage from the front of the house, and convert the bedrooms into offices and work rooms. A fire escape was installed and permission sought to change the front windows so as to create a shop window. The business moved in in 1931.\n\nBerkeley Square had become the centre of fashionable London shopping. In 1937 there were 21 dressmakers, 10 milliners, 4 beauty salons and a dog grooming parlour in the square. There were also two car showrooms, two florists and two photographers. It hasn’t changed much today except that there are fewer private residences and the clothes shops are to be found in the surrounding streets while the square itself now has mainly offices and exclusive hotels and clubs. Number 35 looks unchanged on the outside and is now an office block.\n\nThe Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the following depression affected the country but society and the court, and thus the dressmakers continued much as before. In 1930 court dressmakers were complaining that, despite much interest in the London Season and more debutantes than ever, trade was down. Queen Mary stipulated that court gowns should be British designed and made, which helped to bolster the trade and there were still wealthy families and celebrities to patronise the shops in Mayfair. However, the competition from “princesses and baronesses who set up little dress shops” was a perennial problem. One “very charming” long established Mayfair dressmaker told a reporter with a “wry smile” in 1929 “We haven’t got the Countess of___________ this time. She has gone to ________ for her gown. They are friends and the families know each other very well… [The Countess] was very nice about it and took the trouble to come here and explain… she knew she wouldn’t be as well served as we know all her likes and dislikes and her style…. That one gown makes a difference of over £40 to us”[x]. The papers railed against young married aristocratic women who were “playing at shops”. They didn’t need, and often didn’t make any money and were not prepared to put time and effort into their ventures which were often short lived, making employment for the paid staff in the industry more precarious.\n\nDressmaker’s bills could be significant and problematic both for the dressmakers and the customers. A dressmaker might ‘lend’ items to a prominent client for the publicity and prestige value. There may be an expectation of payment at a later date or actual credit extended to a customer. Some dressmakers regularly operated as unofficial money lenders. Although the aristocracy, beset by high taxation and the expense of maintaining ancestral palaces and castles was a slowly declining market, the families of wealthy manufacturers, less interested in formal court dress but needing ball gowns, wedding dresses and a wardrobe that showed off their wealth were becoming an important clientele. Wealthy men realised that the clothing of their female relatives was an important part of their stature in society and gave their wives and daughters allowances for clothing. The amount varied according to the wealth and generosity of the husband but one newspaper advised a figure of £100 for every £1000 of income as a minimum.\n\nDespite its financial and legal troubles early in the decade, Ann Talbot Ltd continued to prosper in the 1930s. Its designs were included in a fashion parade seen by the Queen and exhibited at the 1938 British Empire Exhibition in Glasgow that year. Mr Edward H Symonds, Chairman of the large fashion house, Revile and founder of the British Colour Council, who was responsible for involving the British textile industry in the exhibition estimated the fashion industry was the third largest sector in the British Empire with an annual income of £500 million pounds. Mrs Walter Elliot, a Scottish politician and civil servant said the aim of the Fashion Theatre was “to show British fabric made up by the greatest dress designers in the country”[xi]. However, Daisy was approaching retirement age. She had been the sole owner of Ann Talbot Ltd since Elsie Hawtrey’s death in 1930. The building at 41 Hill Street where Daisy had lived since 1924 was to be demolished, war was approaching with the promise of restrictions on raw materials and on the ability and inclination of the wealthy to spend on luxuries. In November 1938, having wound up the business she surrendered the lease of 35 Berkeley Square back to the Grosvenor Estate. Some stock was sold to provincial retailers who advertised their special purchase of items designed by Ann Talbot during 1939. In 1944 Jaqmar at 16 Grosvenor Street W1 (more recently famous for their silk scarves) began advertising as Ann Talbot and offering a collection of dresses, coats and hats. This company advertised throughout 1944 and until May 1945 when it announced it would be taking no further orders due to staff shortages and pressure of work\n\nWealthy women were generally educated to be socially and artistically skilled and were not expected to manage their own money. With little financial awareness or understanding it was not uncommon for a woman to get into considerable debt if her taste outstripped her allowance or her husband’s budget. If the marriage was failing a woman might try to win her husband’s attention by making herself more alluring with expensive clothes and jewellery. If that failed, an enticing way of embarrassing the husband was to buy clothes and jewellery and say the husband would pay. More than one court case concerned a husband disputing a dressmaker’s bill and alleging he had forbidden his wife to pledge his credit. The case of Lady Muriel Bowden and her dealing with Ann Talbot Ltd. is the most extreme.\n\nMuriel Bowden\n\nMary (Muriel) Douglas was born in West Kilbride, Ayrshire in 1888, the eldest daughter of a mining agent. Mary’s father died before 1917 and her widowed mother adopted the surname Ker-Douglas. Mary was briefly married to a Mr Smythe and around 1912, had a daughter, also named Muriel. In 1920 she married the industrialist, Sir Harold Bowden who was son of Sir Frank Bowden Bt., owner of the Raleigh Bicycle Company. He had been married previously and had a son, Frank born in 1909 and a daughter, Ruth born in 1911. Sir Frank Bowden died in 1921 and Harold inherited the business and the Baronetcy, becoming Lord Bowden. He also inherited the lease of the Bestwood Estate, north of Nottingham and the newly-weds established it as their lavish stately home with regular shooting, fishing and house parties. Amelia Bowden, Harold’s mother moved away from Bestwood Lodge to a smaller home and maintained her active local charitable work.\n\nHarold was concerned with industrial welfare, making his company an example by establishing company social and sports organisations and maintaining wages despite the unstable economic conditions. He believed in modernising and improving productivity by efficient working and a motivated workforce. He was the Chair of the British Cycle and Motor Manufacturers Association where he promoted exports, lobbied against trade tariffs and encouraged politicians to support industrial development. The Bowdens supported motor car and motorcycling events, Muriel often awarding prizes for feats of speed, endurance and engineering. They were developing skills in publicising both their business and themselves and with the help of their wealth and lavish entertaining, moving up in social circles. Muriel, was photographed for the Tatler of 7 November 1923, described as a “charming hostess” and wearing a fur coat and her trademark ropes of pearls. Bestwood Lodge had 42 bedrooms and there were at least 17 indoor servants. When her pet Pomeranian went missing Muriel was able to set 26 gamekeepers to look for him. She had an unlimited clothing allowance which she spent at the London and Paris fashion houses and jewellers.\n\nIn 1925 Muriel was finding her own voice in public affairs. She wrote a letter to the press encouraging housewives to buy British and Empire products which caused considerable favourable reaction. Her argument was that if there was demand in Britain for apples and other out of season produce from Australia and New Zealand, it would encourage emigration to those countries which would alleviate unemployment in the UK. She attended the Queen’s court in June 1925 wearing a silver lamé gown shot with mauve and draped with old Brussels lace and a train of mauve and silver brocade lined with mauve velvet. However, her interests were predominantly outdoors and sporting, she learnt to drive a motor car and was often pictured fishing or shooting.\n\nIn July 1926 there was a glittering reception for 350 guests following a refurbishment of some of the rooms at Bestwood Lodge. The reporter described thousands of flowers specially grown and transported from Sussex for the occasion, the electrically lit conservatory, pergolas and Japanese garden and the panelled ballroom ceiling. Muriel wore a “wonderful frock” in egg shell blue, richly embroidered with diamante and sliver beads, ropes of pearls, bracelets of rubies, emeralds and sapphires and a shell pink feather fan. However, all was not well and she had to cancel several engagements due to concussion caused, she said, by banging her head on the door of her car. She also visited the Cote d’Azur on her own rather than going sailing with her husband. It transpired later that they discussed separation at this time and agreed that if they were to separate Muriel would receive a financial settlement of £130,000.\n\nThe relationship recovered however and the Bowdens had an extended visit to America where they met Henry Ford and visited Harold’s birth place in San Francisco. On their return Harold bought a yacht, the Maid Marion which they used at Cowes and also for cruising accompanied by friends and either Harold’s daughter Ruth or Muriel’s daughter, known as Miss Muriel Bowden. Muriel supervised the yacht’s interior decoration with deep sapphire blue carpets, attractive chintzes and white panelled walls.\n\nMuriel continued to write for the press. A 1927 article in the Empire Review “A Plea for More Air” praised short skirts and cropped hair for women and advocated the same approach to practical dressing for men. “The cult of clipped hair and skirts is woman’s long-delayed awakening to the folly of stuffiness” men should wear kilts and cricket shirts and do away with collars and ties and bowler hats. Quotations from this article and other epigrams were often included in the papers during the following years and she was celebrated as a coiner of witty bon mots, mostly about the changing role of women. “Women’s fashions today reflect not merely a mood or a mode, they reflect a civilization”, “Thanks to education women have become fact not fancy” She wrote another letter about buying British products, this time focussing on Scottish linen in 1929.\n\nDaisy and Muriel met at a luncheon party in May 1928. Muriel admired Daisy’s dress and on learning that she owned Ann Talbot Ltd., became a regular customer. Although the illustrated papers mainly covered the Bowden’s shooting parties and Muriel was often pictured in outdoor clothing, she was getting a reputation as a very well-dressed woman. A description of her attending a first night at the theatre in May 1929 notes “ her dark brown hair centre-parted and softly waved and coiled in a little knot on her neck … looking beautiful in a black velvet wrap with a waist deep collar and wide cuffs of ermine and a black lace gown with a long trail of black velvet petalled chrysanthemums caught against the right and transparent lace shoulder strap and hanging far down over the skirt flounce. The other shoulder strap being of diamante[i]”. She had her portrait painted twice by Philip de Laszlo and attended the viewing at the French Gallery in June 1929.\n\nHarold made a speech about the danger of communism and the impact on business of Russia’s five-year economic plan which he saw as using “slave labour to create cheap, shoddy goods to flood the market”. Prince Georgy of Russia, a relative of the deposed Tsar, was a guest at Bestwood in November 1928. Another member of this shooting party was the Hon. Christian Eliot, brother of the Earl of St Germans. Daisy Roberts, who was living with him, was also invited as a house guest. . Daisy described the occasion “Everything was marvellously luxurious. When I got to Nottingham station everyone knew that we were guests at Bestwood and we were received most royally. The style of living was marvellous, at the very height of luxury.[ii]” Daisy was on first name terms with Harold and Muriel. At Christmas she dined with the Bowdens at the Embassy Club. She remarked to Harold on how lovely Muriel looked, of course Muriel was wearing an Ann Talbot creation.\n\nDaisy entertained Harold and Muriel to lunch at her flat in March 1929 and they talked business. She had been at pains not to spoil the friendship by making any difficulty about Muriel’s account, she had always provided a quote before Muriel’s orders were confirmed and Muriel always asked the price of the clothes she was buying. At this point, Daisy was under the impression that there was no difficulty with Muriel being able to pay her bills. She didn’t think Muriel was particularly extravagant, she was dressing in a manner in keeping with her husband’s chosen status and lifestyle and her clothes were comparable with other women in her circle. They met again at a supper party at the Savoy in April which was the last time they all met socially. A bill for £680 worth of clothes was eventually paid in October 1930 and Muriel continued to order dresses, furs, gowns and coats.\n\nMuriel was elected president of the London Ladies Motorcycle Club in 1929. She said she didn’t ride herself but enjoyed riding pillion. Her work in promoting women’s sport began in earnest and she also became a member of the committee of the Women’s Automobile and Sports Association (WASA). She organised a ball for the WASA at the May Fair Hotel at which there was a boxing match, a fashion parade of sports clothes and a race of 11 “girls riding miniature motor cars” around the ballroom. The boxing match caused some controversy because it was a real ‘fight to the finish’. Muriel said “There are many ladies who would secretly like to see a proper boxing match but would not care to be seen going to the stadium”[iii]. Her exhortations for women to take up sports were published in the newspapers and her quotable quotes continued “The motorcycling woman represents the highest peak of female emancipation … At one o’clock on a Saturday [women] could put on their macks, fill up their machines and set out on a trip that could be as exciting as any TT race”. “The hand that rocked the cradle is equally at home with the carburettor” At a speech to the London Ladies Motor Club her theme was the importance of the pedal bicycle in increasing mobility, changing fashions, improving health and leisure and promoting equality of the sexes.\n\nHarold was chairman of the British Olympic Association from 1931 to 35 and in that capacity attended the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. He was accompanied by his son, Frank who was a keen sportsman. Muriel had another busy year in 1931, attending dinners and events associated with the Olympic team where she exhorted women to learn to be good sports while Harold encouraged British athletes to be good winners and to be competitive. As a leader in the women’s motor sport movement, Muriel was on the committee that was planning the building of a large speedway facility on the Lincolnshire coast. She awarded prizes at the Nottingham Flying Club and the Women’s Amateur Athletics Championship. Muriel also hit the headlines when she lost a £400 brooch in a hotel in Glasgow and when she suspected one of her cooks to be involved with a notorious murder. The cook was soon found and was completely innocent but there is no report of what happened to the brooch. Harold’s daughter, Ruth (Kiki) was a debutante in 1931. Dresses for her and for the woman who was to present her at court were ordered from Ann Talbot. The dresses cost 50 guineas and 45 guineas. Daisy was asked to make the price as low as possible and to expect a cash payment immediately. Harold paid the bill by cheque.\n\nLater that year, it became clear that the couple had put up the appearance of a successful and happy relationship while in private, there were frequent and violent rows. Muriel said she was often frightened and terrified; their rows were always about money. The doorman of the block of flats where they stayed in London described an incident where Muriel was “crying and moaning” and left the building wearing a fur coat over her nightdress at 1am, returning at 4am. At Christmas 1930 Harold had thrown a shoe at her and the final straw come with an argument about the cost of catering for a house party in July 1931. As Muriel stormed out, Harold hit her in the back and she fell to the floor, her mouth bleeding. Chasing after her, he mistook another woman for his wife and assaulted her, grabbing her arm and swearing for which he apologised when he realised his mistake.\n\nMuriel fled to Gleneagles in Scotland, in a Rolls Royce driven by Harold’s chauffeur. She wrote to Harold but he threw the letter on the fire and telephoned to demand the car be returned immediately and threatened the chauffeur with prison. The chauffeur and car returned but the wife stayed away. Harold then followed her to Gleneagles where further arguments took place. The first indication of trouble about payment of her dressmakers’ bills was when Muriel invited Daisy to lunch in October 1931 and told her she could not settle her account but that it would be paid by the end of January. Daisy said she had no idea at that time that the Bowdens were having marital difficulties.\n\nIn January 1932 Muriel suffered a heart attack and a relapse in March which kept her at home but when she recovered, she wrote to Harold “I …am in a state of collapse. I cannot stand your violent temper any longer and I am afraid you will kill me…I am so frightened” Harold wrote to her “We cannot go on like this. I am going”. He left for the Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Later he wrote “Now we are separate and you have got your provision”. Muriel left Bestwood and rented Kelburn Castle, near Largs in Ayrshire.\n\nIn July 1932 Amy Johnson and fellow aviator, Jim Mollison were married after knowing each other for only a few weeks. They were extremely famous for their flying achievements and the whole world was eager to see them. Muriel made quite a coup when she invited them to Kelburn Castle for some relative peace and quiet on their honeymoon and they arrived in separate planes after racing from London. They stayed for a few days, watching some motor boating and attending a performance at Largs Pavilion. The aviators then left for Ireland to prepare for Mollison’s solo flight to America. Johnson was invited back to Kelburn to wait until he returned but it is not clear if she accepted this invitation. After this, Muriel hosted a shooting party, attended a reception for pilots at the Grosvenor House Hotel and the races at Ayr and Ascot but in November The Bystander noted “Lady Bowden has become almost too thin”[iv] and the news broke that she had applied for a judicial separation from her husband.\n\nThe separation hearing was in February 1933. Muriel alleged Harold had been consistently cruel to her since 1926. She said she had been hit by a shoe and he had hit her with his fists, causing bruising to her arms and back. He had an uncontrollable temper and frightened her with his violent language. Muriel’s daughter and her niece corroborated the incident of the shoe throwing. Harold denied cruelty. He admitted Muriel’s extravagance drove him to distraction and he had lost his temper occasionally. He produced witnesses to support his claim that she had often hit him and was rude to him, humiliating him in public. He had eventually said to her “if you hit me, I shall do the same” In court Muriel admitted to debts of £25,000 and her daughter, who had an allowance of £400 per year also had debts amounting to £900. The jury found in Harold’s favour and there was no legal separation but the couple lived apart from then on. After the hearing, Harold stated publicly that Muriel did not have the right to pledge his credit which resulted in a number of claims from milliners, dressmakers and other businesses for money she owed to them. Harold asked for the smaller claims to be adjourned until he could come to an arrangement about some of the larger amounts but he paid £8 to Miss Y Lewin, a milliner of South Moulton Street and £12 3s 6d to Mrs E F Fresco, a lingerie manufacturer.\n\nIn May 1933 Ann Talbot Ltd. brought an action in the Kings Bench Division before a special jury against Lord Bowden for unpaid bills for clothing ordered between October 1930 and January 1932, amounting to £1,781. He contested the case saying he was not responsible for his wife’s debts and had made her an adequate allowance. They were living separately and the dressmaker should have been aware of her financial situation. The case turned on the necessity of Muriel’s clothing purchases, the risks taken by Ann Talbot in extending her credit and the sufficiency of the allowance that Harold gave to his wife. During the hearing Daisy gave evidence of her relationship with the Bowdens, the luxury of their lifestyle and her understanding up to 1932 that Harold would pay the bills.\n\nIt transpired that Muriel had run up bills with other dressmakers and that Harold had been paying her debts for three years at about £7000 per year. He gave evidence that he had had to make some economies after 1928 as his income had diminished. He had reduced the number of servants at Bestwood and given up his fishing lakes at Newstead Abbey. He had also reduced Muriel’s clothing allowance to £2400. He admitted they had had “a very serious quarrels” and “serious discussions” about money and that he was “astonished and dumbfounded” when he discovered she owed £12,000 in March 1929. He arranged an overdraft so that the debts could be paid and Muriel promised not to get into debt again. “She said I had been good to her and she would not forget it”. In June 1929, he found she had ordered a fur coat worth £350 and made her return it. A Nottingham jeweller informed him in July that she had ordered a bracelet worth £860 and in October further dressmaker’s bills came in to the value of £600. Harold arranged another overdraft paying a total of £11,600 so she could get “really square” with her creditors. He told her at that point that they “could not possibly go on like that and they would have to part if she ran into debt again” In the words of Dennis Pritt KC, Harold’s lawyer, Muriel “could not stop spending” and ran up another £15,000 debt by February 1933.\n\nDaisy was questioned about Ann Talbot Ltd.’s view on married women’s debts. She said some women had dress allowances and some did not but if they could not pay, the business would “look to the husband” to settle the bills. Ann Talbot’s lawyer, Malcolm Hilbery KC also said “a married woman living with her husband… acts as his agent within certain limits” If a tradesperson supplied goods “within the domestic apartment that is ordinarily confided to the management of a wife, the husband is liable if these are reasonable necessities for the style of living he has chosen.” The court found in Ann Talbot’s favour against Muriel and for Harold against Ann Talbot. Muriel was to pay all costs[v]. That summer, hunger marchers in Nottingham protesting against the means test, referred to Muriel’s expensive purchasing on their banners and the case was mentioned in parliament in a debate about the proposal to impose a tax on cooperative societies.[vi]\n\nIn the protectionist customs regime of the 1930s, duty was payable on clothing purchased abroad and was particularly high for business imports. Cases of dressmakers smuggling in examples of the latest Paris designs so they could be copied in Britain were reported in the press. Although individuals also had to pay duty on clothes along with other luxury items purchased abroad it was less than that payable by businesses so employees or other women might be persuaded or paid to buy new dresses in Paris as if for personal use, pay the reduced duty and then pass or sell the clothes to the dressmaker. Some women tried to avoid duty all together and the customs service at Folkestone had considerable work in inspecting the luggage of wealthy women and their entourages. In July 1933, Muriel was caught trying to evade customs duty when she returned from a visit to Paris. The Folkestone Petty Sessions found that she and an American friend, Mrs Leonora Florentine Preston Marsaudon had conspired to evade duty on a silk velvet cape valued at £87, a silk dress valued at £5 15s and silk corsets valued at £3 2s 6d. Denying the dress was hers Muriel said “I would not dream of wearing such a cheap dress”. However, she admitted to the underwear saying “[Mrs Marsaudon] could not fit into them” and even raising her skirt to show she was wearing similar items, much to the embarrassment of the customs officers. The magistrates found the case proven and Muriel was fined £150[vii].\n\nMuriel was summonsed for allegedly obtaining money totalling £2,855 by false pretences from Col. Gerald Thomas Rawnsley between February and November 1934. This caused her a mental breakdown; she could not attend Marlborough Street Police Court to answer the charges because she was a patient in the London Clinic. However, she had been seen at a dinner party and was receiving phone calls and visitors in hospital so the magistrate was suspicious of her illness and requested an independent medical examination. Despite this, the breakdown persisted and she briefly went into a mental home at Roehampton. Her daughter applied to have an official receiver appointed under the Lunacy Act because she could not manage her affairs but Muriel applied for the receiver to be discharged and then went abroad. The false pretences case was eventually withdrawn.\n\nThe Bystander of March 1937 noted that on the Riviera “Lord Portarlington is busy showing an admiring throng of friends over his royal blue Rolls Royce. … Lady Bowden (who’s out with her daughter, Mrs Charles Clarke) is so envious that she decided on the spot to order herself a new car” [viii]. At the same time, there was a petition by her creditors for her to be declared bankrupt and again she became ill with nervous exhaustion and was unable to attend court or to meet the accountant appointed to go through her affairs. In August she eventually met the creditors and sobbing, admitted to living “slightly above her income” She maintained she had only been loaned the use of a Rolls Royce while in France and had assets of £2,866 against liabilities of £13,251 including a hotel bill of £1,633. In 1935 she had ‘sold’ £5,000 of her annual allowance back to Harold in exchange for a £20,000 lump sum and applied for a divorce in 1936. The bankruptcy agreement allocated £3,000 of her income for payment of the creditors, leaving her with £2,000 per annum. The bankruptcy registrar appealed, it would take over 5 years to pay back the creditors at the current rate and divorce proceedings were under way. When the divorce was made absolute in less than a year, the creditors would get no further money. He asked that all her income to be used to pay the creditors and as this would leave her with no income, her husband who had £50,000 annual income could support her. He said Sir Harold had made a good bargain when he paid her the lump sum in exchange for the annual income. The appeal was dismissed, the judges criticised the creditors for not making proper enquiries into her financial state.\n\nUndaunted, Muriel was photographed with friends at the Trianon nightclub in November 1937 in furs and diamonds but looking haunted. This picture was presented to her during the hearing for discharge from bankruptcy in March 1938. She had abandoned her divorce proceedings and as a result there was hope that the creditors would eventually get their bills paid in full. Muriel told the hearing that she considered her £5,000 annual allowance a “poor income”. In tears she exclaimed that she was giving up her freedom so she could pay her debts. The receiver said she was recklessly extravagant and the discharge was granted suspended for 18 months.\n\nHer daughter Muriel married Charles W. Clarke in 1934. Charles was a bankrupt and the marriage lasted only a few months before she returned to live with her mother. She too spent extravagantly and incurred gambling debts. After trying to avoid the official receiver Muriel Clarke was declared bankrupt in December 1937. Her debts of £1,584 included £643 of wine and groceries. It was reported that when she lived with her mother, they kept a large staff. Muriel Clarke was also prosecuted for attempting to sell items that she had not paid for and did not belong to her while her assets were under administration. Her lawyer told the bankruptcy hearing that “she had been brought up in the lap of luxury and had no idea of the value of money.”[ix] In 1940 Muriel’s house was bombed and she claimed she had lost her home and all its contents. Bouncing back in 1942 she was “always very slim and very gay” dancing at the De Guise in Edinburgh[x]. In 1946 she was prosecuted for non-payment of three year’s surtax, a total of £2,043. She gave as the excuse that she was waiting for her war damage claim for £8,750 to come through, the judge had some harsh things to say about not paying tax and living above her means but granted a stay of execution if she paid £800 of the unpaid tax immediately. Muriel changed her name to Dame Mary Dickie Bowden. She lived at 109 Park Street, London and her last address was Butterfield House, Rathfarnham, Co. Dublin. In October 1952 she collapsed while visiting her sister in Glasgow. She was thought to have taken an overdose of sleeping tablets and was taken to hospital but never regained consciousness and died three days later on 23 October. Muriel’s estate — £796 3s 1d was left to her daughter and went directly to the administrator to pay off debts. Her daughter, by then known as Muriel Douglas Hobbs died in 1970 in San Antonio, Texas of liver failure caused by cirrhosis.\n\nMuriel was still formally married to Harold and in the same edition of the newspapers that announced her death was the notice of his intended marriage to June MacKay Bowden who had lived with him for 4 years and had changed her name to Bowden by deed poll.\n\nDaisy Eliot\n\nDaisy’s nephew remembers her as “independent minded and courageous. She had a quiet voice and gentle and sympathetic manner which won her confidences all round. She mingled romantic ideas with good business sense in a fascinating way. She was most loyal and generous to those she liked but relentless in her disapproval of those who had earned her displeasure”[i]. I can imagine Daisy, smart and well dressed with the confidence of an established business woman walking briskly from her flat in Hill Street to her premises around the corner in Berkeley Square. In the evening she would have gone to restaurants and night clubs with friends some of whom were also clients although keeping business and pleasure separate was a lesson she had learnt. I am sure she spent time with her sisters and other family members but how can we know who were her personal friends? This is where the written records are lacking and the memories do not exist. Even in the Jazz Age of the 1920s and 30s the social world was small, friendships were bounded by social class and depended on being introduced by mutual acquaintances.\n\nDaisy and Christian Eliot met when he was in charge of the Military Passport Office and she was travelling to and from Paris on business. They were probably lovers as early as 1922 when “Daisy” sent a floral tribute to the funeral of John Granville Cornwallis Eliot, the 6th Earl of St Germans[ii] they lived together at Cavendish Street and later at Hill Street. This was somewhat scandalous but did not prevent them both being invited to join a shooting party at Bestwood Lodge in November 1928. In 1935 he moved in to 41 Hill Street, where Daisy was living and in 1938, they were married. Born in 1872 and known to his family as Chrissie, he left Charterhouse School in 1889 to study civil engineering and practiced as an architect, specialising in interior design. He did some alterations to the interior of 3 Savile Row for his aunt, Lady Enid Layard in 1903, as she recorded in her journal. “I employed Chrissie Eliot, now head of the firm of Allen & Mannooch in Mount St, to do work in [3 Savile Row]. He has built me a passage leading out of the dining room over the yard to the studio. I asked him also to put a bath into my dressing room. He said this could quite well be done, and he asked to see the place of the drains in order to make the necessary arrangements, but was sure it would be all right. However, on applying the test he found everything much the contrary, and we came to the conclusion that they must i"
