In the Jan 1534 list, hers is the seventh name after Mrs. Marshall, \"mistress of the maidens\". If there were only six maids of honor, this may indicated she held another position. Or not. She was probably the \"one maiden more\" who was the third of three women to make accusations against Anne Boleyn in 1536. Edward Baynton recorded that \"Mistress Margery\" first assisted him and then became uncooperative, which fits with a report by Sir William Kingston that suggests she was loyal to the queen. Margery may also be the \"Marguerite\" mentioned as a witness in some reports. And she may have been with Anne Boleyn in the Tower. What is certain is that when Jane Seymour was queen, Margery offered advice to Lady Lisle about placing her daughters at court and appears a number of times in the Lisle letters. In particular, she advised that Anne Bassett, Lady Lisle's daughter, was too young at fifteen to serve as a maid of honor to Queen Jane. Margery married Sir Michael Lyster of Hurstbourne, and with her husband served jointly as Keeper of the Queen's Jewels.\n\nFather: Richard LYSTER\n\nof Wrestworth (Sir) Mother: Elizabeth STOKE\n\nMarried 1:\n\nElizabeth De La BERE Children:\n\n1.

His mother died giving birth to him.\n\nFather: Michael LYSTER of Hurstbourne (Sir)\n\nMother: Elizabeth De La BERE\n\nMarried: Mary WRIOTHESLEY\n\nChildren:\n\n1. Michael LYSTER\n\nMichael LYSTER\n\nBorn: ABT 1556\n\nDied: AFT 1577\n\nFather: Richard LYSTER\n\nMother: Mary WRIOTHESLEY\n\nMarried: Elizabeth SOUTHWELL\n\nCharles LYSTER of New Lodge\n\nBorn: 1534\n\nDied: 26 Nov 1613\n\nNotes: Lysters brother Richard married Mary, daughter of the 1st Earl of Southampton, and his aunt Elizabeth married Sir Richard Blount of Mapledurham. It was clearly through his relationship with the Blount family that Lyster was returned to Parliament for Bere Alston. Little is known about his upbringing, education and career. His father had close connexions with Herefordshire and Hampshire and Charles may have gone to live at Windsor only when, at an unknown date, he became keeper of the little park. Lyster was already over 60 when he entered into a contract of marriage with Mrs. Bridges, a widow of Lambeth Marsh. He first let her have £190 on the signing of the marriage contract, then sent her a purse of £50 in gold, followed by three more payments amounting to £40, and a pearl chain; he also redeemed one of her diamonds worth £60. Other loans and redemptions were followed by gifts of taffeta, lawn, linen, a silver basin and ewer, a jewel worth £120 to and a set of tapestries for her chamber. Lister further contributed another 2,000 marks for the redemption of more diamonds. In sum he parted with £1,150 and another £1,000 pledged, all upon her faithful promise of marriage which, he stated in his affidavit of 11 Dec 1598, if she denies, I will that all these things shall be recovered of her and be disposed of according to my will. This will, dated 23 Oct 1613, makes no mention of wife or family, so presumably the lady never married him. He does not, however, appear to have been ruined. He was succeeded by his kinsman and godson Lister Blount, son of Sir Richard Blount of Mapledurham. He provided for the foundation of a free school and hospital, either in Oxfordshire or Berkshire, and left £20 for setting to work the poor of New Windsor. He left £200 each to the five daughters of Richard Blount of Sussex, £100 to a cousin, and one years wages to all his servants. Richard Blount of Mapledurham, Elizabeth Blount and Peter Orpe were the executors, and Sir John Croke was the overseer. Lyster wished to be decently and orderly buried, according to his rank and calling.

Another deponent mentioned that Christopher Lyster was lying ill at Midhop in Passion Week last. Christopher died in the spring of 1549, his will was made 6 Feb 1548/49, and was probated at York on 9 May 1549. In his will, he directs that he be buried at Gisburne.

John HAMMERTON of Hellifield Peel\n\nWilliam LYSTER (Sir)\n\nBorn: 28 Nov 1591, Thornton\n\nDied: 1650\n\nNotes: registered his pedigree in 1612, on which occasion the Heralds again admitted that the family were descended from Christopher Lyster of Midhope, &c. The arms were recorded without the crescent for cadency (seeming to imply that the elder male line represented by Gilbert Lyster had become extinct), and without the attires of the stag tinctured with sable. The Bolton quartering was again allowed. He was knighted by King James I at Oatlands, 2 Jul 1615. Was M.P. for the borough of East Retford (dates not known). A deed was made Jul 20, 16 Jas. I. 1 61 8, between Sir William, his three uncles, Michael Lister of Fryerhead, Esq., Martin Lister of Middle Claydon, Esq., Matthew Lister, of London, Dr. of Physicke, and Giles Parker of Horrockforth, Lanes., for the purpose of settling Sir William's estate, in failure of his issue male, on his said uncles and their issue male (G.D., various bundles, 35, No. 40). An indenture, 30 Jan 1627/8, recites one of 20 Jul, 16 Jas. I., between Sir William Lister, Sir Thomas Bellesses, Lord Fauconberg, brother-in-law of Sir William, Sir Thomas Methan, Kt., Martin Lister of Middle Claydon, Bucks, and Giles Parker of Horrockford, Esq. (G.D.).\n\nSir William sold to his son William certain lands in Thornton 19 Apr 1637. His house at Thornton (the old Manor, near the present Rectory) was besieged in Jul 1643 by a party of Royalists under Lord Darcy, he being on the Cromwellian side in the Civil War, and, after having been taken by them, was again attacked by the Parliamentary forces. It was soon afterwards burnt, with the barns and stables, by Prince Rupert, and was never rebuilt. A number of years ago, on digging into the rubbish, an apartment was discovered on the ground floor with the old furniture undisturbed. Sir William received a grant in 1646 of L500 for the damage done to his estate, and for the loss of his son Col. William Lister, slain in the service of the Parliament.\n\nSir William fought at Marston Moor (of which battle there is a picture, by A. Cooper, R.A., at Gisburne, with portraits of Cromwell, Generals Ireton and Lambert, Sir Charles Lucas, Sir William Lister, Sir Thomas Slingsby), 2 Jul 1644. It would appear that Sir William was commanding Parliamentary troops in Yorkshire in 1645 when he was M.P. for the West Riding and for the City of York. He d. 1650, having m. at Coxwould Church, Yorks., 17 Feb 1610, Mary Bellasys, dau. Sir Henry Bellasys, Knt. and Bart., of Newburgh, Yorks., and sister of Sir Thomas, cr.

By an inquisition taken at Clitheroe Castle, 21 Nov 1542, it appeared that by the death of \"Thomas Lyster of Westbyhall, gentleman\", certain lands in Chatbourne had reverted to the Crown, and that Thomas Lyster, his son and heir, acknowledged that Anne (?), widow of the said Thomas, was entitled to her dower. Thomas Lyster's will, 14 March 1540, mentions: \"to be buried in my parish church of Gisburne ... for my burial 20 to buy a vestment... to Thomas Husteler, priest, 40 a year and his board for 2 years...

ROWTON LINE\n\nWilliam LYSTER\n\nBorn\n\n: 1425\n\nDied\n\n: 1475\n\nNotes: The family of Lyster, of Rowton, is considered to have sprung from the same stock as the Lyster of Gisburne, in Craven, which house has lately been ennobled by the title of Ribblesdale. William Lyster, of Shrewsbury, the first name in the Heraldic Visitation for Salop, is found to have purchased Rowton Castle, and to have been seated there in the year 1451. In 1836 John Burke noted that Henry Lyster, Esq. of Rowton Castle, in the county of Salop, b. 18 Oct 1798, is the fourteenth possessor of Rowton Castle from his first Shropshire ancestor, William Lyster.\n\nMarried\n\n1: Elizabeth LEIGHTON (dau. of Edward Leighton and Elizabeth Stapleton)\n\nChildren\n\n:\n\n1.\n\nRichard LYSTER of Rowton 2.

Margaret BROMLEY\n\nJohn LYSTER (Esq.)\n\nBorn: Rowton, Salopshire, England\n\nDied: 1550\n\nFather:\n\nRichard LYSTER of Rowton\n\nMother:\n\nAgnes FITZHERBERT\n\nMarried 1: Christabella GATACRE (dau. of John Gatacre of Sutton and Hughley and Eleanor Acton)\n\nChildren:\n\n1. Richard LYSTER\n\n2. William LYSTER (MP)\n\nMarried 2:\n\nCatherine BROMLEY\n\nChildren:\n\n3\n\n. Leonard LYSTER\n\nWilliam LYSTER (MP)\n\nBorn: 1520\n\nDied: 1579\n\nNotes: returned to the second session of the 1572 Parliament following the death of Thomas Gourney. His patron was almost certainly Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford, who on Lysters own death wrote to the borough 11 Jan 1580 for a blank indenture, on which he could insert the name of a new nominee. If, as seems likely, this man was one of the Shropshire Lysters, he was related to Thomas Bromley, an executor of Bedfords will. Thus it may have been Bromley who asked Bedford for the nomination at Dartmouth. No details are given in the printed Shropshire visitations (where the name is spelled Lister) about John Lysters younger son William, who was presumably the nephew mentioned in the will of a namesake, a merchant of Great Yarmouth, made and proved in 1579. The will also refers to my cousin William Lyster of the Exchequer. It seems, then, that there were at least three Williams of the Shropshire branch living in 1579the merchant himself, who was the younger brother of John of Rowton; his cousin or kinsman of the Exchequer (conjecturally suggested as the MP), and his nephew William. William of Yarmouth is himself known to have had a son William, but he may have been dead by the time of the will, which does not mention him. The only William Lyster known to have died in 1579 is the Yarmouth merchant, but no reason can be suggested for his sitting for Dartmouth. There were members of the Yorkshire Lysters with the same christian name at this time, but again in the absence of any connexion with the Earl of Bedford or with Devon, no reason can be put forward to explain why any of them might have sat for Dartmouth.
