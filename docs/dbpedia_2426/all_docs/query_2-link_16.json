        "text": "Often regarded as the definitive screen incarnation of Georges Simenon's easy-going detective, Chief Inspector Jules Maigret. On the strength of his popularity, Davies was named \"Television Actor of the Year\" in 1963.\n\nHe was the first actor to play George Smiley. The character was later played by Alec Guinness, Gary Oldman, Denholm Elliott and James Mason (though it was based on Smiley, the character name had to be changed to Charles Dobbs because Paramout owned the rights to the character).\n\nHaving become famous playing Chief Inspector Jules Maigret on TV, he then impersonated a Maigret-like character in a series of commercials for Dubonnet, for ITV. Georges Simenon, Maigret's creator, objected to the commercials and had them stopped. Davies regretted this, claiming he had made more money over the few days of filming the commercials than he had in nearly four years of playing Maigret for the BBC."
