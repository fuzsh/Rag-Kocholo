        "text": "This article is about the mayors and lord mayors of the City of London. For a list of mayors of Greater London, see List of mayors of London.\n\nThis is a list of all mayors and lord mayors of London (leaders of the City of London Corporation, and first citizens of the City of London, from medieval times). Until 1354, the title held was Mayor of London. The dates are those of election to office (Michaelmas Day on 29 September, excepting those years when it fell on the Sabbath) and office is not actually entered until the second week of November. Therefore, the years 'Elected' below do not represent the main calendar year of service.\n\nIn 2006 the title Lord Mayor of the City of London was devised, for the most part, to avoid confusion with the office of Mayor of London. However, the legal and commonly used title and style remains Lord Mayor of London.\n\nMayors\n\nThis list details which livery company each Lord Mayor was associated with.\n\nBefore 1300\n\nTerm Name Mother Livery Company Notes 1189–1212 Henry FitzAilwin (Draper)[a] First Mayor of London.
