        "text": "Rupert Brooke's sonnet 'Peace' was inspired by his experience with the Royal Naval Division during the evacuation of Antwerp in October 1914. Brooke wrote the sonnet later that month, and by the end of the year had written four more to complete a sonnet sequence entitled '1914'. Preceded by an unnumbered sonnet (written in August 1914), the sequence was first published in the periodical New Numbers (number 4) in January 1915.\n\nI. Peace\n\nNow, God be thanked Who has matched us with His hour,\n\nAnd caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,\n\nWith hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,\n\nTo turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,\n\nGlad from a world grown old and cold and weary,\n\nLeave the sick hearts that honour could not move,\n\nAnd half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,\n\nAnd all the little emptiness of love!\n\nOh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,\n\nWhere there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,\n\nNaught broken save this body, lost but breath;\n\nNothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there\n\nBut only agony, and that has ending;\n\nAnd the worst friend and enemy is but Death.\n\nThe Works of Rupert Brooke, (Wordsworth Poetry Library, 1994), p. 144\n\nLiterary Criticism of 'I. Peace'\n\nBrooke observes the sonnet form (14 lines of iambic pentameter, divided into an octave and sestet), however the octave is rhymed after the Shakespearean/Elizabethan (ababcdcd) rhyme scheme, while the sestet follows the Petrarchan/Italian (efgefg). Brooke has also deviated somewhat from the traditional thematic divisions associated with the octave and sestet: question/predicament and resolution/solution, respectively. The octave begins immediately to herald a great change, and the sestet functions merely to detail it further.\n\nBrooke not only bends sonnet rules, he also tacks on an extra syllable to 10 of the 14 lines, while making line 9 (the beginning of the sestet) a full hexameter.\n\nThe images in the first four lines: of religious calling, inspired youth, waking with restored strength and refreshed senses, and the swimmer turning (away from filthiness) and diving into sparkling clean water are images of baptism and absolution that belong to the doctrine of \"muscular Christianity.\" Begun and practiced at Rugby where Brooke was born and raised, \"muscular Christianity\" was a late-Victorian public-school notion of cleansing and test of manhood afforded by getting out of doors and getting in the game. Some practitioners of this notion felt that the war was the way to cleanse society (and especially young manhood) of what they saw as the effeminacy of Modernism. The second quatrain could describe this reaction against Modernism. However, Brooke was also looking for a fresh- start for himself. He was:\n\nGlad from a world grown old and cold and weary,\n\nafter frustrated affairs with Katherine Cox and Noel Oliver, and some near and authentic nervous breakdowns, all of which leads Martin Stephen to wonder if \"the war may have at last offered certainty and direction to someone [like Brooke] whose capacity to inflict injury on himself outweighed the damage he could do to others.\" As part of his clean break, Brooke lashed out especially against his former Bloomsbury friends:\n\nLeave the sick hearts that honor could not move,\n\nAnd half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,\n\nAnd all the little emptiness of love!\n\nThe end of the octave (\"And all the little emptiness of love!\") is the climax of the sonnet. But with the first line of the sestet, Brooke comes back to his theme of absolution and reinforces the dual meaning of the poem:\n\nOh, we who have known shame, we have found release there,\n\nAs we've seen before, \"there\" is both the war (in a very naively generalized way; as an adventure, as a purifying crusade) and Brooke's own state of mind. In the remainder of the poem Brooke resigns himself to the clean simplicity of (what he sees is) a soldier's life and fate — whether a soldier in war or a soldier of life. 'Peace' is a declaration of self- realization and self-determination. It is at once about conversion and autonomy. One of Brooke's biographers, Christopher Hassall, observed that Brooke \"celebrated in exultation this discovery of a moral purpose.\" The poem must be considered in the context of the war as well as Brooke's tempestuous personal life, which at the time of the poem, he was finally beginning to pull together.\n\nBrooke was a product of \"muscular Christianity\"; a pre- war poet, expressing the pre-war sentiment of cleansing just as poets as diverse as Robert Graves and Isaac Rosenberg wrote poetry in the early days of the war that celebrated this image of the \"Happy Warrior.\" Even Siegfried Sassoon's early poems display this idea of spiritual cleansing afforded by the war, for example his aptly-titled 'Absolution':\n\nThe anguish of the earth absolves our eyes\n\nTill beauty shines in all that we can see.\n\nWar is our scourge; yet war has made us wise,\n\nAnd, fighting for our freedom, we are free.\n\nSassoon later explained: \"People used to feel like this when they joined up' in 1914 and 1915. No one feels it when they go out again.'\" Brooke never had the chance to become a true trench poet: he died from blood poisoning on April 23, 1915, two days before the Hood Battalion landed at Gallipoli.\n\nIn his obituary of Rupert Brooke, Winston Churchill called the sonnets of Brooke's '1914' sequence \"incomparable.\" Such enthusiastic, but premature appraisals of Brooke's work occasioned equally hasty condemnation. Intelligent judgment considers the poem in its historical context. As Paul Fussell has noted about 'Peace', Brooke's sentiment is \"an emotion so innocent and bizarre, so confident of right and wrong and secure in its sense of divine intelligence and design, [that it] is not likely to surface more that once a century.\"\n\nLitCrit by: Robert Means, English Literature Librarian, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University\n\nOn April 4, 1915, Dean Inge of St. Paul's Cathedral read a sonnet from the pulpit as part of his Easter Sunday sermon. The sermon was published in The Times the next day, and the sonnet therein became, as George Parfitt describes, \"an important document of national preparation for war.\" Originally entitled 'The Recruit', Rupert Brooke's sonnet 'The Soldier' was the last in a sonnet sequence entitled '1914'. The five numbered sonnets, preceded by an unnumbered sonnet were first published in the periodical New Numbers (number 4) in January of 1915.\n\nV. The Soldier\n\nIf I should die, think only this of me:\n\nThat there's some corner of a foreign field\n\nThat is for ever England. There shall be\n\nIn that rich earth a richer dust concealed;\n\nA dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,\n\nGave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,\n\nA body of England's, breathing English air,\n\nWashed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.\n\nAnd think, this heart, all evil shed away,\n\nA pulse in the eternal mind, no less\n\nGives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;\n\nHer sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;\n\nAnd laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,\n\nIn hearts at peace, under an English heaven.\n\nThe Works of Rupert Brooke, (Wordsworth Poetry Library, 1994), p. 148\n\nLiterary Criticism of 'V. The Soldier'\n\nBrooke observes the sonnet form (14 lines of iambic pentameter, divided into an octave and sestet), however the octave is rhymed after the Shakespearean/Elizabethan (ababcdcd) rhyme scheme, while the sestet follows the Petrarchan/Italian (efgefg). Brooke has also deviated somewhat from the traditional thematic divisions associated with the octave and sestet: question/predicament and resolution/solution, respectively. The octave and sestet both enjoin the reader to imagine the blissful state of the fallen soldier.\n\n'The Soldier' is the culmination of Brooke's '1914' sonnet sequence. In 'The Soldier' Brooke invokes the ideas of spiritual cleansing (as found in 'Peace'), inviolable memories of the dead (as in 'Safety'), a hero's immortal legacy ('The Dead' III & IV), but now he combines all these specifically under the overarching framework of English heritage and personal loyalty to it. Although Dean Inge objected to the neo-paganism of Brooke's idea of resurrection,\n\nAnd think, this heart, all evil shed away,\n\nA pulse in the eternal mind[,]\n\n'The Soldier' touched a nerve and inspired imitations. Some were close and complimentary as they sought a recognizable connection with Brooke's sonnet. For example 'To My Mother — 1916' by Rifleman Donald S. Cox:\n\nIf I should fall, grieve not that one so weak\n\nAnd poor as I\n\nShould die.\n\nNay! Though thy heart should break\n\nThink only this: that when at dusk they speak\n\nOf sons and brothers of another one,\n\nThen thou canst say—\"I too had a son;\n\nHe died for England's sake!\"\n\nEdward Thomas (who was acquainted with Brooke) was probably musing on 'The Soldier' when he made up his little ditty to a bugle call — 'No One Cares Less than I':\n\nNo one cares less than I,\n\nNobody knows but God,\n\nWhether I am destined to lie\n\nUnder a foreign clod,\n\nwhile Martin Stephen sees a \"clear rebuttal\" to 'The Soldier' in Charles Hamilton Sorley's sonnet 'When You See Millions of the Mouthless Dead':\n\nWhen you see millions of the mouthless dead\n\nAcross your dreams in pale battalions go,\n\nSay not soft things as other men have said,\n\nThat you'll remember. For you need not so.\n\nAssociated, as it came to be, with the discredited idealistic attitudes of 1914, Rupert Brooke's sonnet 'The Soldier' suffered a similar fate. However, Stephen finds that \"the personal element\" in Brooke's sonnets distinquishes them from propaganda verse: \"[w]hatever else they may be, Brooke's sonnets sum up admirably a mood that was felt by many people when war broke out.\"\n\nLitCrit by: Robert Means, English Literature Librarian, Harold B.
