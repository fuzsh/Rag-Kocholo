        "text": "Each and every one of us has an inner awesomeness that is unique to them only. Did you know that very few people embark on the path to unearth their greatness? That thing that makes them stand out and sets them apart from everyone else in all their spheres of influence. At one point I myself stopped asking if I can be great, if I can be awesome or if I can be okay spreading my wings and be still accepted because nobody ever gave me that nod, that approval I so badly needed. The big question is how do you connect and tap into your own greatness in order to fly?\n\nHere are some pointers you could use below:\n\nSelf-awareness\n\nBefore you dash off to understand anything or anyone, understand yourself first. Have a crystal clear perception of your personality, including strengths, weaknesses, thoughts, beliefs, motivation, and emotions. This is important as it allows you to understand other people, how they perceive you, your attitude and your responses to them in the moment. People with high self-awareness easily find the magic with in them and are self-motivated. They have intuitive decision making, and help to lead and motivate others more effectively.\n\n2. Self-love\n\nDo you love yourself? This seems like an easy question. It is not. Why do you keep friending someone who acts like they have amnesia the minute they think they have cooler friends? Why do you keep taking the blame for things you did not do to cover up for someone? Why do you pretend that its okay when something is not sitting down right with you? Why do you invest your time and energy in plans that don’t keep working? When will you give yourself a break, switch off your phone the whole day, grab an ice cream and bask in the sun without a care? Self-love reflects a person’s overall subjective emotional evaluation of his or her own worth. It is a judgment of oneself as well as an attitude toward the self. Are you loving yourself well? If you don’t, you may never tap into your inner amazing self.\n\n3. Have a support team\n\nEverybody needs a support team. The people that cheer you on to keep stepping in the midst of uncertainty and challenges. The people that will push your limits and bring out your awesomeness. The people that will stand with you and stay with you regardless of the storm you are weathering. The people who seek your well-being and success above all else. These people are your inner circle and they can be categorized into family, friends and mentors. A support team is crucial to discovering your greatness as it helps you unlock your own greatness. They see what we are capable of better than ourselves. They know how to motivate us. My biggest support team member is my Mom. Most of the time when I doubt or I’m not sure she always reminds me that the sky is not the limit but just a challenge. She provokes the beast of my inner awesomeness to roar.\n\n4. Know what you want\n\nThere is nothing as unattractive as a confused person. The indecisiveness. The jitteriness. The doubt. The fear that paralyses them when an opportunity presents itself. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, know exactly what you want. What do you want to do with your life, your career, your business? How do you intend to be the next billionaire? How will you know what opportunity to seek or grab if you aren’t conscious of what you want? As long as you don’t know what it is you really want, you will continue encountering shut doors and close calls.\n\n5. Work, work, work\n\nThere are no shortcuts to achieving your greatness except hard work. Quoting Fredrick Douglas the African-American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman in his speech “self-made men,” he says, “We may explain success mainly by one word and that word is WORK! WORK!! WORK!!! WORK!!!! Not transient and fitful effort, but patient, enduring, honest, unremitting and indefatigable work into which the whole heart is put, and which, in both temporal and spiritual affairs, is the true miracle worker. Everyone may avail himself of this marvelous power, if he will. There is no royal road to perfection. Certainly no one must wait for some kind of friend to put a springing board under his feet, upon which he may easily bound from the first round of their ladder onward and upward to its highest round. If he waits for this, he may wait long, and perhaps forever. He who does not think himself worth saving from poverty and ignorance by his own work efforts, will hardly be thought worth the efforts of anybody else.”\n\n6. Redefine your own frontiers of success\n\nChange the definition of success by being authentic and creative. Think outside the box. Think in other terms. Challenge the status quo. Make impossible the new possible for you. The reason why other people are successful is because they find opportunity in value in what comes dressed in overalls and what looks useless. Don’t be satisfied by doing the usual thing. Do the unusual. Do the uncommon and do it well. Successful empires were never built on common ground.\n\n7. Be ok with failing\n\nWhenever you are faced with a great opportunity you have no idea how it will turn out, let alone predict if it can be successful tell yourself this one statement. “HOW COULD I NOT DO THIS!!!” You may fail yes but failure is a part of unlocking your awesomeness. In his quest to create a bulb that lights up for long Thomas Edison failed 10 000 times. Upon his success he was asked about his 10 000 failures and he replied, “I didn’t fail. I just found 10 000 ways that wouldn’t work.”\n\n8. Be consummate with your hussle\n\nA few years ago, one of my mentors went to an international conference where Strive Masiiwa the founder of Econet Wireless was doing a presentation on mobile money services. Strive showed them a slide, showing, “key performance indicators”, based on a comparison with similar services, in other parts of the world, such as Kenya’s M-PESA (the best such service in the world) bench marking” how well Econet was doing against the best, in their game. Strive told them that, Econet did not “invent” Mobile Money Transfer service, but studied carefully what others had done all over the world. Their teams went on field visits, to countries, like Kenya, and the Philippines. They ran a pilot service, for many months, which was used to evaluate customer responses, and redesign the product. At one time Strive was asked about the history of “prepaid service” and he gave lecture, tracing its history, all the way to the first lab tests, in Israel! He ended the conversation by saying, “When I open a newspaper or a magazine, I flip through looking for articles, first on telecoms. Anything related to communications… I just devour it! …. Its my game! What I read locates me”\n\nWhat is your hussle? Do you know your hussles’ origins? Yes go down, dig deep into what it is you exactly do in your industry. Benchmark yourself with the best in the industry even at your professional workplace, polish yourself and be the best. Talk about your hussle to people because if they keep hearing it and keep seeing you do it they will believe it. Eat it, sleep it be thorough about your hussle, leave no stone unturned by any means necessary be consummate with your hussle.\n\n9. Choose your battles\n\nNot every fight has to be battled out and won. The fact that you choose your battles doesn’t mean that you don’t embrace confrontation. It just means that you are mature enough to let something’s go and rather pursue your own personal development and your productivity. Above all you choose to be happy and peaceful achieving greatness. Whenever I coach my emotional intelligence module, I always emphasize that you don’t need to invest in anger, defensiveness, confrontation, jealousy, shade, small talk and all those emotions that leave you spinning in a roller-coaster you can’t stop. Those emotions are expensive. It’s important for you to realize that you can’t afford them before you go on a spending spree that leaves you broke, unhappy and most likely accumulating debt. As long as you can’t afford it, don’t do it. It’s not worth it.\n\n10. Do what is right\n\n“Doing what is right.” But what exactly is the right thing. So many people have different notions of what is right versus what is wrong because of the way they were raised, their culture, their religion, their sexual orientation, their beliefs and their value system. In such a maze of choices how do you know that you have made the right choice in anything? I believe each of us has an inner 6th sense that is an inkling of what is right. That 6th sense is innate with all living mammals. Take for instance a case where an 8-year-old gorilla named Binti Jua made worldwide headlines when she carried a boy to safety after he slipped away from his mother and climbed through a barrier at the Western Lowland Gorilla Pit at the Brookfield Zoo on Aug. 19, 1996. Camera footage at the zoo showed the boy lying on the ground before Binti Jua gingerly picked him up around the waist, carrying him to a door where rescuers waited as a crowd looked on. If an animal has an instinct of what the right thing was, what more of us as human beings? So do what feels right in your gut in your quest to connect to greatness."
