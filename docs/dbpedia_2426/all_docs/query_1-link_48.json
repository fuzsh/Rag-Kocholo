        "text": "PART I\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nChapter 1\n\nAtom bombs and parks for peace\n\nOnly once in his career did Anton Rupert deliberately stay away from his office for a whole day.\n\nThis was when he heard of the world’s first war-time nuclear explosion: the morning the devastating news reached South Africa that an atom bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, destroying the Japanese seaport. The brief prelude to Japan’s surrender and the end of the Second World War had begun.\n\nThe nuclear horror, a direct result of the splitting of the atom through which humankind developed the ability to annihilate itself, irrevocably changed the course of history. It also changed Anton Rupert’s view of life irrevocably.\n\nThe young Afrikaner industrialist, trained in the natural sciences and destined to become his country’s most innovative entrepreneur and the head of one of Africa’s two wealthiest families, immediately sensed that this was a defining moment in history: one of those rare events that would forever be remembered as a turning point in human existence.\n\nRupert was at that stage still in Johannesburg, an inexperienced young entrepreneur with a factory processing pipe tobacco that struggled to keep afloat in the tough wartime conditions. That morning in early August when he heard of the devastation of Hiroshima, he telephoned his office to announce that he would be unavailable for the whole day. Instead, he stayed home to ponder on the destructive force of the atom bomb: ‘I realised that the human race had become like scorpions in a bottle, with the power to destroy one another totally.’¹\n\nExpressing a similar sense of awe after witnessing the giant mushroom cloud forming over the stricken city, Robert Lewis, who had been the co-pilot of the Enola Gay, the B-29 bomber of the American Air Force that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima, wrote in his journal: ‘My God, what have we done?’\n\nOne hundred thousand of the 245 000 inhabitants of Hiroshima perished that day, obliterated by the force of nuclear power, with a further 100 000 dying in the aftermath. Three days later the second and last atom bomb destroyed the picturesque port city of Nagasaki, killing another 80 000 people.²\n\nThe devastating atom bombs heralded the final episode of Japan’s participation in the war. Five days later Emperor Hirohito acknowledged that Japan had been vanquished for the first time in its history. The images of total annihilation by the two atom bombs, Little Boy and Fat Boy, not only broke Japan’s spirit but stunned the whole world.\n\nAnton Rupert, with a master’s degree in chemistry, understood that something cataclysmic had occurred. At his Johannesburg home, which he was to leave a few months afterwards for Stellenbosch to build a business empire that would eventually stretch across the globe, he reflected on the implications of the atomic era. He sensed that the military use of the nuclear bomb was probably the most portentous event he would experience in his lifetime, and came to the conclusion that the world would see no more great wars for fear of mutual annihilation. The inevitable consequence would be constant smaller wars, making lasting peace in the future highly unlikely.\n\n‘Since the unlocking of the power of the atom – since Hiroshima – everything has changed, except our way of thinking. In this atomic era there is no longer any country remote enough to become a place of shelter. The biblical notion that I am my brother’s keeper has become a cold reality; depressions are now global, as is welfare. In this century where at least two nations possess enough bombs to destroy everything, we live like scorpions in a bottle – and he who wants to retain all, will lose all.’³\n\nIn future, humanity could only save itself through coexistence. ‘People simply have to learn to live together.’\n\nCoexistence, a conviction that had been taking root in Rupert since his student days, now became the core concept that would inspire him all his life, and a vision that he would proclaim persuasively. The well-known Rodin bronze The Ca­thedral, acquired in the 1960s, stands in his office as an enduring reminder. The sculpture of two right hands symbolises for him the coexistence between people, the foundation on which he developed his business philosophy. On this philosophy of coexistence, or partnerships forged from country to country, he built a worldwide international business chain long before globalisation became a fashionable concept.\n\nThis vision of partnership is coupled with social responsibility, which he considers one of the three major responsibilities of a successful business enterprise. Not only should there be coexistence between human beings, but also coexistence between human beings and nature. It is with this philosophy that Rupert as conservation-oriented philanthropist was to carry the concept of peace parks, or transfrontier conservation areas, across international borders.\n\nPeace parks – with peace between peoples and nations as a desirable prerequisite for the survival of threatened species in spite of a human population explosion threatening the biological cycle – became a compelling vision that brought the octogenarian Rupert to his head office at Millennia Park in Stellenbosch each day. With the energy of a much younger man, he campaigns for the development of transnational game and nature parks that require multilateral cooperation between governments of various countries.\n\nThe peace parks are perhaps the most imaginative project initiated by the philanthropist Rupert in a long business career that he has applied to the benefit of society on many fronts.\n\nThe Ruperts appear on the Forbes business magazine’s list of the world’s wealthiest people, the billionaires with estimated assets of more than 1 000 million American dollars. Besides the Ruperts, Forbes only lists one other family from Africa: the Oppenheimers, the heirs of the South African mining magnate Sir Ernest Oppenheimer and his son Harry.⁴\n\nThe main difference between these two South African families, both of whom have contributed enormously to the development of their country as well as to community welfare, is that Rupert started with next to nothing when he built his international business empire, nor did he depend on the country’s abundant mineral riches as a base.\n\nLabelled in the media as the ‘king of luxury’, the ‘secretive marketing giant’, the ‘shy king of snob smokers’ and the ‘true gentleman of the business world’, he built an international reputation.\n\nThe chemistry student – who with a personal investment of a mere £10 started a worldwide group of companies that would make him a world-famous entrepreneur – is linked to some of the best-known international trademarks, the foundation on which his business empire is built. From Cartier, the ‘king of jewellers and the jeweller of kings’, to the luxury goods of Alfred Dunhill, from Mont Blanc’s stylish writing instruments to the oldest Swiss watchmakers, all fall under Richemont, the international arm of the Rupert umbrella. It was preceded by the establishment of a global chain of tobacco interests under the banner of Rembrandt and Rothmans, as well as the production of the most famous South African wines and spirits.\n\nDuring his long career Anton Rupert developed into a man for all seasons, with active interests outside the business sphere: conserver of his country’s historical heritage; patron of the arts; navigator over political minefields; benefactor helping others to help themselves.\n\nStill, in spite of the media attention that accompanies his public appearances, Rupert remains an intensely private person, someone who does not readily grant media interviews and whose private life is as mysterious as some of his weighty business transactions.\n\nThe eminent Afrikaans poet Dirk Opperman celebrated Rupert’s restless spirit and many-sidedness by describing him as the ‘prince of commerce’ who could reconcile commerce, science and the arts.⁵ His versatility is also the source of his interest in nature and animal life, the foundation on which the idea of peace parks developed.\n\nRupert was the first chairman of the Peace Parks Foundation (PPF), which has former President Nelson Mandela as emeritus patron. This icon of the 20th century likes to refer to Rupert as his ‘older brother’.\n\nEight heads of state of southern African countries serve as honorary patrons of the PPF, which facilitates the establishment and development of transfrontier parks. Rupert regards the Foundation as a catalyst, a concept from his background as chemist that he has used frequently in his long career – a substance that, without itself undergoing any change, precipitates a change in another substance.\n\nThe PPF’s funds, mainly derived from private individuals as well as institutions and big multinational companies, are used to develop the transfrontier conservation areas and also to train people in the tourism and service industries as well as game wardens.\n\nTo a world with shrinking natural resources, Africa with its vast, still unpopulated spaces can be a last refuge for irreplaceable wildlife and unspoilt natural beauty. This is why Rupert started linking the idea of peace parks to national parks. Besides, wildlife and conservation can provide a foundation for counter-acting the poverty and unemployment of many African countries. These activities prepare the way for tourism, the world’s biggest industry, the enormous potential of which has scarcely been exploited on the conflict-ridden continent.\n\nHe was able to experience the achievement of six peace parks being connected directly to his fatherland only a few years after the inception of the project. These transnational parks and conservation areas that are joined to South Africa and for which agreements have been signed with the respective governments, have already considerably extended the ‘African safari’ as a sought-after tourist destination.\n\nTogether with two other peace parks in southern Africa, these eight, with their abundance of animals and plant life, will cover about 60 million hectares. A further fourteen transfrontier conservation areas in southern Africa have been identified for development in the next decade. The 22 peace parks will ultimately extend over 100 million hectares, an area the size of France, Germany and Switzerland combined.\n\nThe idea of peace parks is gaining ground in other parts of the world as well, such as the demilitarised zone between South and North Korea, the Mont Blanc mountain park, South America and elsewhere.\n\nThe most extensive project in which South Africa is directly involved is Greater Limpopo, the game park that may become the biggest animal kingdom in the world. The renowned Kruger National Park of South Africa will be united with three national parks in Mozambique and Zimbabwe’s Gonarezhou National Park. The envisaged peace park, four times the size of the already large Kruger National Park, will be home to an unrivalled collection of Africa’s animals, plants and trees. It is envisaged that this transnational park, extending across the borders of three countries, will initially cover 35 000 km², which could eventually be extended to 100 000 km² – bigger than Portugal, Hungary or Austria.⁶\n\nBig game has already been translocated from the Kruger National Park to Mozambique. Among other wildlife, more than 1 000 elephants will eventually be moved to the Mozambican side: to a region where animals were destroyed ruthlessly during Mozambique’s civil war, but also the country from which the first elephants for the later Kruger National Park were donated decades ago.\n\nThe translocation of the first herd of elephants to the envisaged peace park took place on 4 October 2001, Rupert’s 85th birthday. For him this was a birthday present without equal: the realisation of a ten-year-long dream.\n\nStill at Rupert’s side in this great experiment is his wife, Huberte. This strong and attractive woman has been a tower of strength and his sounding board throughout his career, his life partner with whom he celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary a week before on 27 September 2001.\n\nRupert often reiterates his belief that the idea is stronger than the man. His conviction that nothing can stop an idea whose time has arrived echoes an observation by the economist John Maynard Keynes: ‘The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed, the world is ruled by little else. I am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared to the gradual encroachment of ideas.’⁷\n\nNow, in his advanced years, Anton Rupert is experiencing the satisfaction of seeing the idea of peace parks becoming increasingly popular – an idea that may still become the biggest and most enduring trademark of the business leader who is regarded by an international trademark expert as the oracle of trademarks. Nothing would give Rupert greater pleasure than seeing such an inspirational, hope-giving idea expanding internationally from South Africa, the fatherland to which he has always returned after his world travels.\n\nHe draws inspiration from Albert Schweitzer’s thoughts on reverence for life. The German medical missionary, philosopher and philanthropist, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952, devoted his life to healing Africans in his hospital at Lambaréné in Gabon. Schweitzer regarded ethics as nothing other than reverence for life. ‘Reverence for life affords me my fundamental principle of morality, namely that good consists in maintaining, assisting, and enhancing life, and that to destroy, to harm or to hinder life is evil,’ he declared.\n\nReverence for life is also reflected in a poignant bronze statue placed in the entrance hall of Rupert’s office building in Stellenbosch. Here visitors walk past the German artist Käthe Kollwitz’s Mutter mit Zwillingen, depicting a mother cradling her twins in her arms.\n\nNow the once energetic dark-haired entrepreneur walks with a stoop as a result of a curvature of the spine. He also reads with some difficulty, and all correspondence and reading material have to be enlarged by means of a video screen on his desk. A solar eclipse 60 years ago may have caused his eye problem. In October 1940 in Graaff-Reinet he and his youngest brother Koos, who has similar eye problems, watched a total eclipse of the sun through film that possibly did not offer adequate protection. Typically, Rupert regards his weakening sight as an asset – just as more than once in his career he tried to convert a disadvantage into an advantage. Because he is able to read less, he ‘has more opportunity to think’.\n\nThe remarkable life story of this entrepreneur-philanthropist, a business leader regarded as one of Africa’s legends, covered almost a quarter of modern South Africa’s history by the turn of the century. It started nearly nine decades earlier with his birth during the First World War in his beloved Karoo, the vast semi-desert in the interior of South Africa where the Rupert family became part of the land and the land became part of them.\n\nPART II\n\nFORMATIVE YEARS\n\nChapter 2\n\nEastern Cape roots\n\nThe first Rupert arrived in South Africa in 1857.\n\nJohann Peter Ruppert, the founder of the South African Rupert family and Anton Rupert’s great-grandfather, was a native of Prussia. According to family lore he came from Gräfrath near Solingen, although his death certificate in the Cape Town archives gives his birthplace as Trier, the oldest city in Germany. He was one of the many German founders of Afrikaner families – 33,7% of Afrikaners of the period from 1657 to 1867 were of German descent, the second-largest group after those of Dutch descent (34,8%).¹\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Crimean War (1854-56) Johann Peter Ruppert enlisted in the British army, which was recruiting reinforcements on the European continent. With the rest of what was known as the German Legion, he was stationed at Colchester near London under the command of Major-General Baron Richard von Stutterheim. The war ended before the Legion was sent to the Black Sea, and Ruppert and his comrades were given the option to settle on the eastern frontier of the British colony at the Cape. With the cost of the frontier wars a drain on the treasury, the British government was keen to settle military pensioners on smallholdings so that they could be called up for military duty when the need arose.\n\nThe volunteers were told that there was a dearth of women at the Cape and were advised to find wives before they set forth. On 19 October 1856 the eighteen-year-old Ruppert wed seventeen-year-old Emma Susanna Grandfield-Crosby, a Colchester girl. Thus the South African Ruperts − Ruppert soon lost its second p − are descended from British and Prussian stock.\n\nBy that time the Cape, strategically situated on the sea route to the East, had burgeoned into a prosperous colony. Trade in wine and wool was flourishing and the government could launch large-scale public projects. But there was a serious shortage of skilled labour and European immigrants could help fill the gap.\n\nTwo events had given rise to the shortage of labour. Many craftsmen and workers died in the smallpox epidemic of 1857, while the ‘national suicide’ of the Xhosa in the same year, the consequence of visions reported by the prophetess Nonqwase, resulted in large-scale loss of life.²\n\nBy 1858 a contingent of 2 362 officers and privates of the German Legion, accompanied by only 361 women and 195 children, had been settled in the drastically depopulated frontier area later known as the Ciskei. In due course they were joined by a further 2 700 German civilian settlers, friends and relatives of the military settlers.\n\nJohann Peter Ruppert (private number 1678, in the third company of the German Legion’s second regiment) disembarked in East London. According to family tradition he was musically talented, and a violinist in the military band. He was initially stationed at Berlin, one of a number of Eastern Cape towns that were given German names, where he was granted land.\n\nThe British government’s plan with the German settlers in the buffer zone at the frontier did not work out as intended. The frontier problem was becoming less acute and, at the outbreak of the mutiny in India, over 1 000 members of the German Legion volunteered for service on that subcontinent. Only 386 eventually returned. The ones who remained were mostly unable to farm successfully on their five-acre holdings, much of which was not even arable. In 1861 the German Legion was disbanded.\n\nJohann Peter Ruppert and his wife were among the settlers who moved to Graaff-Reinet, where the Ruperts would have a lasting influence. This Karoo town with its colourful history had been established in 1786 as the centre of the fourth district at the Cape, with a drosdy (magistrate’s residence) as the seat of local government, and a military commandant. The district encompassed a vast area stretching from the Indian Ocean almost to the Gariep River, with an indigenous population ranging from the Xhosa in the east to the Griqua and San in the west. By the time the district was proclaimed there were already 600 farmer families of European descent.³\n\nAs early as 1795 the people of Graaff-Reinet showed their mettle when they rebelled against the authority of the Dutch East India Company, earning a reputation as the first Boer republic. The town also has a niche in early South African history as the home base of eminent figures like Andries Stockenström (1792-1864) and Andrew Murray (1794-1866), moderator of the synod of the Dutch Reformed Church (DRC). Murray ministered in Graaff-Reinet alongside members of the London Missionary Society like Dr John Philip and Dr JT van der Kemp, whose views differed greatly from his.\n\nIn the confrontational climate of the eastern frontier Stockenström, the district’s first landdros or magistrate, later lieutenant-governor of the Eastern Cape, stood for coexistence with the indigenous population and advocated truth and justice as fundamental principles. The views of this influential and far-sighted leader resemble the philosophy Anton Rupert was to adopt more than a century later.\n\nStockenström was responsible for laying out the charming town, which, with its water furrows, was known as the ‘Jewel of the Karoo’. Set in the horseshoe bend of the Sundays River, it boasted an imposing church and parsonage (later the Reinethuis), as well as Cape Dutch, Georgian and Victorian residences cheek by jowl with flat-roofed Karoo houses. Today it is a picturesque museum town with 220 proclaimed historical sites, the most in any town in South Africa.\n\nThe descendants of the rebels of 1795 gradually developed more and more grievances against the British colonial administration, and by 1838 the Great Trek, the migration of Afrikaners to the interior, was in full swing. Several eminent Trekker leaders had close ties with Graaff-Reinet. Gerrit Maritz was a wealthy wagon maker in the town, with an outlying farm called Welgevonden, eventually owned by Anton Rupert’s son Anthonij. Andries Pretorius of Blood River fame farmed in the district. Two provincial capitals − Pietermaritzburg and Pretoria − were named after them. The marriages of renowned Trekker leaders Piet Retief and Louis Trichardt were solemnised in the local church, and Andries Hendrik Potgieter was baptised there. Another prominent Trekker leader, Sarel Cilliers, was born at nearby Nieu-Bethesda.\n\nTwo presidents of later Boer republics − JN Boshof of the Free State and TF Burgers of the Transvaal − hailed from Graaff-Reinet. Further down the line, Dr DF Malan, later prime minister of South Africa, left his position as minister of the DRC in Graaff-Reinet to become the first editor of Die Burger, the oldest Afrikaans daily newspaper. And Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, founder-leader of the Pan Africanist Congress, the Africanist resistance movement that broke away from the African National Congress in the late 1950s, went to school and now lies buried at Graaff-Reinet.\n\nMany other cultural leaders, business people, educationists, medical doctors and agriculturalists put their stamp on Graaff-Reinet. The town was quite ‘cosmopolitan’; the strong Afrikaner presence was complemented by English-speaking and Jewish families as well as initially a smaller group of black people and a considerably larger population of coloured people.\n\nThe first Rupert arrived in Graaff-Reinet during a worldwide depression in the aftermath of the Crimean War and the American Civil War. The wool market was flat and mildew was wreaking havoc in the vineyards of Graaff-Reinet. In 1868 the mildew was brought under control through the use of sulphur, and the town became renowned as a source of brandy and a potent home-distilled brew called withond, ‘white dog’. The discovery of diamonds at Kimberley in 1867 and of gold at Pilgrim’s Rest in 1874 restored the fortunes of the town. Fortune hunters from all over the world landed at Port Elizabeth and travelled to the minefields via Graaff-Reinet. There were over 60 camping sites for ox-wagons travelling north. In 1879, amid great festivity, Graaff-Reinet became the terminus of the new railway line from Port Elizabeth. At one stage the town had no fewer than four newspapers.\n\nThe pioneer Johann Peter Ruppert started off as a foreman on the farm Bloemhof, but then worked in Graaff-Reinet as a wagon maker until his death in 1882. According to family tradition he was killed in a shooting accident while hunting, which is not implausible, since the plains of the Karoo teemed with game in those days.⁴\n\nHe and his wife Emma Susanna belonged to the Anglican parish of St James at Graaff-Reinet. In 1865, a few years after their arrival in the town, the colonial government decreed that instruction at all government schools in the Cape Colony would henceforth be conducted in English. English newspapers at the Cape, convinced that the English were the ‘dominant race’, propagated a militant form of cultural imperialism; the Cape Argus dismissed Afrikaans as a ‘bastard jargon’, unworthy of the name ‘language’. Despite this the Ruperts, like many other immigrant families, gradually adopted Afrikaans as their home language. After the marriage of the pioneer couple’s surviving son to an Afrikaans-speaking girl, the family eventually joined the Dutch Reformed Church.\n\nThree of the pioneer couple’s four children died in childhood, two of them of diphtheria within ten days of each other in the epidemic of 1869. Only the eldest son, Anton Rupert’s grandfather Anthony Edward, survived to adulthood. Like his father, he died at the age of 44 years. Emma Susanna died in 1919.\n\nGrandfather Anthony Edward Rupert was a builder. During his last illness in 1906 he wrote a document − it is still in the family’s possession − describing his humble beginnings at the village of Petersburg, plying his trade from one farm to the next. Sometimes he went around on horseback, but when in dire straits he travelled on foot. Before his marriage to Maria Elizabeth Dippenaar in 1885 he rented a house from the coloured congregation of the London Missionary Society for £2 per annum. He had to cover the thatched roof with a canvas wagon tent to keep out wind and rain.\n\nAfter his marriage his fortunes improved. He built a school at Graaff-Reinet and another on the farm Letskraal, where Andries Pretorius had farmed before the Great Trek. At Petersburg, on the ox-wagon route to Kimberley, he built a church whose cornerstone still bears his name. His reputation spread. In 1899, shortly before the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War, he and his family settled in Graaff-Reinet itself, where he restored and renovated houses. Although all building materials had to be transported by ox-wagon, he could complete a farmhouse within six weeks – an achievement that required considerable organisational abilities.⁵ Ds Rooi Abraham Louw, who had known the builder Rupert at Graaff-Reinet, once told Anton Rupert: ‘Your grandfather was the most hard-working man I ever met.’\n\nThe eldest of the skilled builder’s eight children, John Peter Rupert, born in 1888, practised as an attorney at Graaff-Reinet, where his family would live for nearly a century. In this town, with its eventful history, his son Anton was born 28 years later.\n\nChapter 3\n\nBoyhood years in the Karoo\n\nAnthony Edward Rupert the second was never called by his baptismal names. In his boyhood he was known as Boetie (lit. ‘little brother’), and at university he became Anton. The oldest of three brothers, he was born on 4 October 1916. Jan (John Peter) was born in 1922, and Koos (Jacobus Albertus) in 1929. Both Rupert’s bothers would follow him to the Rembrandt Group. The three brothers in the tobacco industry have been compared to the three brothers Reemtsma in Germany and the three brothers Reynolds in the USA, who built up the biggest cigarette factories in their respective countries.\n\nTheir father, universally known as Oom (Uncle) John, was a respected community leader in Graaff-Reinet. In the hard times during the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902), when the Cape Colony was subject to martial law and many Cape Afrikaners, although British subjects, were as poverty-stricken as their fellow Afrikaners and relatives in the war-torn northern republics, he had to go out to work at a young age. After the war he was able to complete his high-school education at the Graaff-Reinet College in 1909.\n\nAfter serving articles at the local law firm of CH Maasdorp, John Rupert worked as an attorney in towns such as Kimberley, Mossel Bay and Prince Albert, which was booming in the heyday of the ostrich-feather industry. Here he was offered a partnership in a law firm but he smelled a rat and turned down the offer – wisely, as it turned out, since two of the partners were later prosecuted. It left him with a lasting mistrust of partnerships, in contrast to the philosophy of partnership his eldest son would implement so successfully.\n\nJohn Rupert, who established his own law practice in Graaff-Reinet, took a keen interest in education and child welfare. The secretary of the local Child Welfare Society during his term of office as chairman was the town’s social worker, Tini Malan, who was to marry the later Prime Minister John Vorster. Another future prime minister who crossed his path was JG (Hans) Strijdom, whose uncle brought the young law graduate from nearby Willowmore to Rupert requesting that he employ him as an articled clerk. Rupert was of the view that Graaff-Reinet offered too little scope and advised him to try his luck in the Transvaal. Strijdom evidently heeded the advice and moved to Pretoria and then to Nylstroom, where he became known as the Lion of the North.\n\nYears later, before Strijdom became prime minister, he visited Anton Rupert in Stellenbosch. Strijdom, Transvaal leader of the governing National Party in the 1950s, wanted to break away from the then Prime Minister DF Malan on account of differences about whether South Africa should become a republic. Rupert walked twice around the house with the agitated Strijdom and persuaded him to be patient; he would get his chance as leader. Strijdom did take over from Malan, but became ill and died in office.\n\nJohn Rupert and his wife both served on the committee of the Dutch Literary and Drama Society in Graaff-Reinet. The deputy chairman was Dr Bennie Keet, eventually a theology lecturer at Stellenbosch who became known for his rejection of apartheid. The names of the Ruperts and Keet appear in a brochure about an exhibition of ‘antiques and curiosities’ held in Graaff-Reinet in 1918, for which several townspeople had contributed antique furniture and possessions of historical value. Anton Rupert’s later interest in antiques was probably stimulated at an early age.\n\nJohn Rupert became involved in politics as the secretary of the first branch of the National Party established in the town after General JBM Hertzog’s sensational speech at De Wildt on 7 December 1912. Hertzog increasingly differed with the conciliation politics of Generals Louis Botha and Jan Smuts as well as their views on the language question, with Hertzog advocating language equality for Afrikaners. He declared himself a ‘definite opponent’ of imperialism where imperial interests clashed with national interests, and stated that he put South Africa first. As a result of his unshakable views Botha omitted him from the first Union cabinet and the Free State judge and war hero Hertzog formed a new party, the National Party (NP). In 1913 Hertzog, who was to become South Africa’s longest-serving prime minister, created a commotion at a Stellenbosch language festival when he read out a telegram from former Free State President MT Steyn, a giant figure in South African history, that contained the following quotation in Dutch: ‘In the mouths of the conquered, the language of the conqueror is the language of slaves.’\n\nThe NP grew into the strongest party in Graaff-Reinet as scores of supporters of Botha and Smuts’s South African Party (SAP) joined its ranks. John Rupert’s wife Hester chaired the women’s branch of the party, which would come to power in 1924 in coalition with the Labour Party.\n\nJohn Rupert’s hobbies were writing and reading poetry and studying languages; he could read nine languages. At the age of 70 he took up French, and could soon read classic works in that language. But he was unable to avail himself of a bursary to the Netherlands in his student years and never travelled abroad.\n\nIn his legal career John Rupert appeared in several much-discussed court cases, some arising from the Rebellion of 1914 during the Second World War. He defended the editors of the Graaff-Reinet Onze Courant and the Aberdeen paper Nuwe Tijd when they were charged with the capital crime of sedition on account of reports on Gen. Manie Maritz’s treasonable act of joining the Germans with his troops during the Rebellion. The charges were withdrawn. On another occasion he defended the editor of Onze Courant when the paper was sued for reporting that the British airforce had bombed cities in a neutral country. The report turned out to be true, and again the charge was withdrawn.\n\nAt that time quite a number of coloured people, who then still had the vote in the Cape Province, lived in the town of Graaff-Reinet. In Cradock Street alone there were 25 houses belonging to coloured families. John Rupert did not hesitate to appear for coloured people, sometimes pro bono, at a time when such actions were viewed with scepticism by conservative white communities like Graaff-Reinet’s. Coloured townspeople referred to him as Groot Seur (Big Sir); later his son Anton was called Klein Seur (Little Sir). Anton Rupert was to consider the later removal of coloured people from the centres of towns such as Graaff-Reinet and Stellenbosch under the Group Areas Act of 1950 one of the great follies of the NP’s policies of rigorist racial separation.\n\nJohn Rupert counted among his good friends and clients the local DR minister Ds Jozua Francois Naudé, and his wife, Mrs Ada Naudé. Ds JF Naudé was a co-founder and the first president of the Afrikaner Broederbond (AB), the secret organisation established to promote Afrikaner interests as a counterweight to the Freemasons and Sons of England. The couple were the parents of the later anti-apartheid activist Dr CFB (Beyers) Naudé, named after Christiaan Frederick Beyers, the Boer general under whom his father had fought in the Anglo-Boer War and who drowned in the Vaal River in the Rebellion of 1914.\n\nDs Naudé was also chairman of the governing body of the Hoër Volkskool in Graaff-Reinet, the first Afrikaans-medium secondary school in the Cape Province, where Anton Rupert was to matriculate. John Rupert was a co-founder and for 21 years honorary secretary of the governing body. At one stage he successfully waged a one-man campaign against the abolition of Latin, which he considered an essential basis for language instruction, as a subject at the school.\n\nIn 1922, a year before Boetie Rupert started school, the Hoër Volkskool – with its motto Ons Sal Handhaaf expressing a commitment to uphold the linguistic and cultural aspirations of Afrikaners – moved into the stately premises of the erstwhile Midlands Seminary. The principal Dr G von W Eybers, who had obtained his doctorate in London, was a firm believer in mother-tongue education. Already in 1919, six years before Afrikaans was recognised as an official language, he started teaching in Afrikaans instead of Dutch. This unleashed an educational language dispute in the town that resulted in the establishment of the Union High School, an English-medium boarding school.¹\n\nThe language question also led to division in the DRC. In 1921 Ds Naudé, one of the six Bittereinders (bitter-enders) who at the end of the Anglo-Boer War had refused to sign the terms of surrender at Vereeniging, gave his inaugural sermon in Afrikaans. Aggrieved members of the congregation, many of whom considered Dutch the appropriate language for church services, protested vehemently against the use of ‘kitchen Dutch’ in the ‘Great Church’ of the Murrays. One Sunday the organist, Amy Asher (born Murray), even played ‘God Save the King’ after the service. It ended in schism when the ‘New Church’ seceded.\n\nAnton Rupert’s wife Huberte recounted in an interview that her father-in-law had lost clients during a court case in which he acted for the wife of a friend. It offended some people that John Rupert had defended her – a portent of the loyalty principle that would count for so much in his son’s career.\n\nWhen Anton’s father died in 1961, he thought he would ask Beyers to bury his father, Huberte said. Dr Beyers Naudé, then minister of the DR congregation of Aasvoëlkop in Johannesburg, related during the funeral service that as a child, he often had to take messages from his father to the deceased. He had been struck by John Rupert’s ‘sincere modesty, genuine love for his people, broadness of vision and sense of justice’.\n\nJohn Rupert met his future wife Hester Adriana van Eeden, sister of a friend, on a train from Port Elizabeth to Klipplaat, a small railway siding near her father’s farm in the Jansenville district. They were married in December 1915 and a year later Anton was born in their stone house at 110 Cradock Street, Graaff-Reinet. The family later moved to 84 Cradock Street.\n\nAnton Rupert was born two years after the outbreak of the First World War on 4 August 1914. In South Africa, Botha and Smuts’s decision to invade German South-West Africa (today Namibia) in support of the hated British Empire once again divided the country. A rebellion broke out after Gen. Manie Maritz had joined the German forces. Although the Rebellion of 1914 was quelled, resistance grew against the conciliation politics of Botha and Smuts aimed at national unity between Afrikaans- and English-speaking South Africans and cooperation within the Commonwealth, especially after Hertzog had proclaimed his policy of ‘South Africa First’. Smuts’s execution of the rebel leader Jopie Fourie also earned him bitter reproaches that would dog him for the rest of his life.\n\nAn important consequence of the Rebellion was the establishment of the Helpmekaarvereniging, a mutual-aid society to assist rebels with the payment of fines and compensation claims, at a time when the Poor White problem was worsening in the aftermath of the Anglo-Boer War. Following from the Helpmekaar movement’s first fundraising drive that yielded £250 000, a national congress was held at Graaff-Reinet’s neighbouring town of Cradock in 1916, the year of Anton’s birth, to investigate the problem of poverty. It turned out that there were 105 518 indigent whites, 39 021 of them in dire straits, and that a quarter of the country’s 280 000 white children were not attending any school.\n\nAlthough the congress was unable to do much to stem the impoverishment, the Helpmekaar movement provided one of the most important launching pads for the economic independence of Afrikaners. The mustering of Afrikaner capital during the First World War led to the establishment of a number of big Afrikaner enterprises that became success stories, notably the media company Nasionale Pers (later Naspers) in 1915 and the insurance giants Sanlam and Santam as well as the Koöperatiewe Wijnbouwersvereniging van Zuid-Afrika Beperkt (Cooperative Wine Farmers Society of South Africa Ltd, the KWV) in 1918. Some of these enterprises were to play a role in Anton Rupert’s life, while he would also later become involved in the Helpmekaar educational fund.\n\nA major driving force behind the Helpmekaar movement was Ds JD Kestell, who would later be a decisive influence in the young’s Rupert’s life. Kestell conducted the funeral service of former Pres. Steyn, who was buried at the foot of the Women’s Monument in Bloemfontein after having said in his last speech on the day of his death in 1916: ‘The Helpmekaar has been born from God.’\n\nAnton Rupert’s mother Hester, one of ten children, was a caring, loving woman who ‘kept the family together’ and had a great influence on her eldest son. He often quoted moral guidelines she had given him, such as: ‘Of what use is it to conquer the world and lose one’s soul?’ And: ‘Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shall find it after many days.’ At her funeral in 1944 a coloured woman told her daughter-in-law Huberte Rupert that ‘she had given much to our people’.\n\nAfter Dr DF Malan’s departure from Graaff-Reinet Mrs Hester Rupert became the secretary of the Jong Zuid-Afrika (Young South Africa) association. It had originally been called Zonen van Zuid-Afrika (Sons of South Africa) as a counterweight to the Sons of England, with the aim of promoting a common South African patriotism, supporting the Dutch language and advancing the material and spiritual interests of the Afrikaner people. In 1912 it was decided to admit women as well and the name was changed. In due course Jong Zuid-Afrika sided with Hertzog’s NP against Prime Minster Louis Botha.\n\nMrs Rupert’s father, Mr Jacobus Albertus (Oom Kootjie) van Eeden, a Cape Patriot and co-founder of JH Hofmeyr’s Afrikanerbond, South Africa’s first political party, also had a significant influence on his grandson Anton. Up to Oom Kootjie’s death at the age of 84, this successful farmer who had 500 morgen agricultural land under irrigation on his farm Gannavlakte often discussed national affairs with his grandson. Oom Kootjie was a descendant of one of the oldest Dutch families in South Africa – the first Van Eeden arrived at the Cape in 1662. On his mother’s side Anton Rupert is a ninth-generation South African.\n\nOom Kootjie had a chequered history. His father died when he was nine and he was indentured to a wealthy farmer, for whom he had to perform hard manual labour. After his mother’s remarriage she reclaimed him, but he was again put to menial work, this time as a goatherd on his stepfather’s farm. He ran away to fight in the frontier war. Wounded, he turned to transport riding and married Anna Gertruida Lötter, also an orphan, who bore him ten children. After some daring land speculation he bought Gannavlakte, which he developed into a prosperous farm. It boasted an orchard, vineyards, a smithy, a brandy distillery, a mill, flocks of sheep and ostriches, whose plumage was worth a fortune in those days.\n\nEven though he had little formal education, Oom Kootjie was a prominent member of his community and district chairman of the Afrikanerbond for over 22 years. He often addressed the annual sports meetings on Union Day (31 May) on a farm in the Jansenville district, and wise words from this grandfather Anton Rupert learnt to respect were quoted in a newspaper report: ‘. . . the common fault on the sportsground, as well as in life, is to look at the man who is behind you. If we could keep the man in view who is ahead of us and make it our object to catch up with him the number of poor people would certainly decrease.’²\n\nHe was interned at Port Alfred for his pro-Boer sympathies in the latter days of the Anglo-Boer War, when Boer commandos were invading the Cape Colony and recruiting young Afrikaner rebels. Two of these were Oom Kootjie’s eldest sons, Frederick (Frik) and Francois (Soois), who joined up in 1901. After enduring hardship on commando they surrendered to British forces. As a Cape rebel and British subject Soois, aged seventeen, was found guilty of the capital offence of high treason by a military court in Graaff-Reinet. He was granted clemency by Lord Kitchener and received a prison sentence of one year, but benefited from the Peace of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902 and only served six months.\n\nOom Kootjie’s youngest son, born in 1901 while his older brothers were on commando, was christened Smartryk − grief-stricken, sorrowful. In the aftermath of this war that would be regarded as the beginning of the end of British imperialism, the name expressed the emotions of thousands of Afrikaners, also in the Cape Colony, who had suffered and been pauperised as a result of the conflict. Many were on the brink of famine and the British government’s meagre compensation for war damage caused further bitterness. General Louis Botha, first prime minister after the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, was offered £900 in settlement of his claim for £20 000. He returned the cheque.\n\nA war story that made a profound impression on the young Boetie Rupert was that of the legendary scout and Scarlet Pimpernel of the Boer forces, Gideon Scheepers, executed at the age of 23 by the British after being convicted of 30 alleged war crimes. In Anton Rupert’s own view, the story of Scheepers as told to him by his father, who as a thirteen-year-old boy had been present at the verdict of the military court on Church Square in Graaff-Reinet, changed his life.\n\nThe prosecution of Scheepers was a show trial intended as a lesson to Cape republicans – while in Rudyard’s Kipling words, the war had been ‘no end of a lesson’ to Britain itself. On Major-General John French’s orders the execution was carried out in public. Blindfolded, sitting on a chair, the ill Scheepers faced the firing squad of the Coldstream Guards on his mother’s birthday, 17 January 1902. His body was put in a grave on the scene and covered with quicklime, but was probably removed that same night. His remains were never found.\n\nLike the concentration camps where 28 000 women and children died and the ‘scorched earth’ policy of the British Commander-in-Chief Lord Kitchener in terms of which hundreds of farmhouses were burned down and herds of livestock destroyed, the show trials and executions of Cape rebels and Boer prisoners of war elicited bitter resentment. Scheepers, for instance, was not a Cape rebel but hailed from the Transvaal and was a commander of the Free State state artillery, therefore rather a prisoner of war than a disloyal British subject. Some 40 rebels were executed in the Cape Colony, with eight executions taking place in Graaff-Reinet. As elsewhere, the executions hardened the attitudes of republicans in the divided town.\n\nThe long search of Scheepers’s mother for his remains was never rewarded. On her hundredth birthday in 1956, she said she had not forgotten, but forgiven: ‘Let us rather live together in love and peace as an undivided people.’³ Scheepers became a legend in South Africa that also inspired Afrikaans poets. In his moving poem ‘Gebed om die gebeente’ (Prayer for the bones), Dirk Opperman reflects the plea of the grieving mother of Scheepers, an expert heliographer:\n\nBless, Lord, all the bleached bones of our struggle –\n\nthat we as one great nation in the tough terrain\n\nwith every scrap of roofing iron and every wheel\n\nand, like tin foil behind clean glass, the white, the black, the brown,\n\nmay catch your sunlight, Lord, and signal each to all.⁴\n\nOpperman, a close friend of the Ruperts, captures with his imagery the idea of partnership and coexistence that would run as a leitmotif throughout Anton Rupert’s career, after he had been inspired at a young age by the legend of Scheepers. At the Anglo-Boer War centenary in 1999 Rupert bought a priceless file on Gideon Scheepers, previously in the possession of British Intelligence, from a Cape Town bookseller. It contains Scheepers’s last letters and diary entries, as well as unique photographs of Scheepers and other Boer prisoners of war.\n\nA monument to Scheepers and the others executed at Graaff-Reinet, unveiled in 1908, was erected on land donated by Jurie Laubscher, owner of the factory that manufactured the famous Graaff-Reinet Doll. The later fate of this doll-making factory with its seventy workers was something that made a lasting impression on the future industrialist Rupert. When the Pact Government of the National and Labour parties came to power in 1924 after the mineworkers’ strikes in Johannesburg, they introduced progressive labour laws with strict requirements for the physical layout of factories. ‘Oom Jurie Losper, as he was known, couldn’t meet those requirements – and Graaff-Reinet’s biggest factory had to close down,’ Rupert remembers.\n\nIn Boetie Rupert’s childhood days Graaff-Reinet, like most country towns, had no electricity, running water or tarred streets. Drinking water was collected from the runoff of rainwater from rooftops. Gardens were irrigated from furrows fed by Maggie’s Well, a perennial spring that produced two million gallons of fresh water daily on the site where the town reservoir is today. This water, boiled, was used for ablutions. Piped water did not come till the late 1920s. Lighting was provided by candles and paraffin lamps. When electricity finally arrived, it was expensive at a shilling a unit. In the early 1920s John Rupert drove a Model-T Ford, which was replaced with a Chevrolet in the mid-twenties. Later the vintage Chev was displayed in the Transport Museum at Heidelberg, Gauteng.\n\nOne of Boetie Rupert’s earliest memories was a visit to his great-grandmother Emma Susanna at an old-age home in Cape Road, Port Elizabeth, shortly before she died in 1919. His mother also showed him a letter to her from this Colchester-born ancestor, which ended with five crosses and a message in her native English: ‘And remember to give my love to Anthony.’\n\nPort Elizabeth was where the Ruperts spent their holidays. Grandmother Rupert lived there from 1923 till her death in 1930. So did her daughter Florence, Aunt Florrie, a teacher who introduced Boetie to experiences that stimulated his early interest in industry and museums. He was taken to the snake park and the museum and, when he was old enough in the early 1920s, to various factories around Algoa Bay. Places they visited included the first assembly plants of Ford and General Motors, the Wool Exchange, the Pyotts biscuit factory and the Mobs shoe factory. Years later Anton Rupert told visitors at a Port Elizabeth show: ‘Coming from Graaff-Reinet where there were no industries, it was a dream and a magical world to me to see how something was manufactured.’⁵\n\nSouth Africa’s transition from agriculture and mining to an industrial country left such a lasting impression that it influenced his choice of career. ‘Production has always fascinated me. Later at university I realised how important industry was as a source of employment opportunities,’ he said in a radio interview.⁶\n\nIn Port Elizabeth he also saw his first talkie, ‘The singing fool’, starring Al Jolson. Before that he had seen only silent films, like the cowboy films of Tom Mix. But he never became a film enthusiast and showed no particular interest in the cinema in later years.\n\nIn Anton Rupert’s boyhood years the most important people in South African country towns and villages were authority figures like the school principal, the magistrate and the minister of the local congregation. Sundays were strictly Calvinist in Graaff-Reinet, a town very much under the influence of the Murrays, who like other austere Scottish church fathers had become ministers of the South African DRC. Children had to attend church and Sunday school, sport on Sunday was considered sinful and even sewing was forbidden on the sabbath lest the needle pierce God’s watchful eye. John Rupert never went to church, but his wife Hester took the children while he went mountaineering. Although she did not flaunt her religion, she was devout. And whatever his religious convictions, her husband’s values were staunchly Calvinist: an ethos of hard work, integrity and sobriety governed Anton’s upbringing and indelibly stamped his character. So rigorous was John Rupert’s moral code that he never defended an accused who had confessed his or her guilt to him. Yet the absence of rigid orthodoxy on the part of his parents left the eldest son with a lasting distaste for niggling rules and regulations that curb innovativeness and individuality.\n\nBoetie Rupert started school in 1923 at the age of six. Although there was no school uniform, the children had to wear shoes. On his first day at school Boetie was pushing his baby brother’s pram and ended up in a water furrow. His brand-new shoes and outfit were drenched and he had to go home to change into old clothes and shoes before venturing out on his school career. Boetie completed substandards A and B in one year. He was left-handed but, counter to the common practice in those days, he was not forced to write with his right hand. For that he could thank Dr Karl Bremer, their family doctor, who had recently qualified abroad and brought home some enlightened ideas. He lived across the road from the Ruperts and his daughter Elizabeth (Van der Merwe, a writer of children’s books) was a classmate and close friend of Boetie.\n\nInitially his scholastic performance was mediocre: in Sub B he came ninth in his class. Then a rebuke by his teacher in front of the whole class shamed him into excelling. Soon he was top of his class, to the chagrin of Elizabeth Bremer, his inveterate rival. She remained at the Volkskool till they were in Standard 7; then her father became a member of parliament − later Minister of Health − and the Bremers moved to Cape Town.\n\nHester Rupert was much loved by the young, who shared many childhood joys and sorrows with her. She read books with Boetie, a voracious reader in his own right. Apart from the family’s collection of children’s books, he scoured the well-equipped town library for newspapers and magazines like Scientific American and Illustrated London News, besides any book that captured his lively curiosity. At night his mother sat up with him while he read and studied and brought him a hot drink at bedtime.\n\nWith his father he went for long walks across the veld, sometimes to the Valley of Desolation (the Ruperts called it the ‘mountain cathedral’). He loved this wide, arid landscape, so ancient a dinosaur footprint would cause no surprise, and considers it ‘an absolute privilege’ to have grown up in the Karoo. According to Anton Rupert’s brother Koos, their father preferred mountain climbing to going to church – in a poem he had written about the Valley of Desolation, he described it as ‘the church where I want to pray’. Years later Anton Rupert pointed out in a newspaper interview that many of the great faiths came from the desert − Moses, Jesus and Mohammed had all been desert dwellers. ‘That is where you get seven-year droughts, where the starry night skies make you aware of your puniness, and where you are forced to think.’ By contrast, he quipped, Karl Marx found the inspiration for the communists’ bible, Das Kapital, in the vaults of the British Museum.⁷\n\nThe young Anton spent time at his father’s office, learning about the legal profession. John Rupert impressed on him the importance of meticulous attention to detail, a virtue that Anton was to inculcate in his own children and employees in later life. He also taught him to be wary of praise: ‘Today they shout hosanna, tomorrow they crucify you.’ A compliment, he added, entailed responsibility: you had to live up to it. Among the values John Rupert imparted to his son was the importance of honesty and being true to one’s word.\n\nBoetie Rupert’s introduction to radio was a crystal set broadcasting the 1929 election results. What impressed the twelve-year-old Boetie no less than the second victory of his hero Hertzog was the novelty of radio waves. He and a friend decided to build their own crystal radio. For an aerial they chose a length of galvanised wire, which they wanted to fasten to the roof of the house. While they were on the roof the aerial dropped onto the power lines, causing a short circuit that left the neighbourhood without power for hours. His father was furious.\n\nIt was at about the same time that Boetie and his friend Elizabeth stood watching a municipal vehicle procession one day when they saw a billboard advertising cigarettes. In what could have been a prophetic moment, the young Rupert told Elizabeth South Africa should not be importing such cigarettes: ‘We should be making them ourselves.’ He was expressing a sentiment that had been gaining ground among Afrikaners for quite some time. Already in 1880 Di Afrikaanse Patriot had referred to ‘foreign fortune seekers who are completely in control of commerce in our country’.⁸\n\nIn the late 1920s Japie Heese founded the Voortrekker movement for youths at the Hoër Volkskool. Boetie joined and wore the little green badge in his buttonhole. In 1931 it became a countrywide movement, an Afrikaans counterweight to Baden-Powell’s Boy Scouts. Boetie did not excel at sports, although he enjoyed a friendly game of tennis or rugby. Later in life when a journalist from the American magazine Fortune asked Rupert what his favourite forms of exercise were, he remarked: ‘I do mental gymnastics and I jump to conclusions!’\n\nAs a child he often played ‘Cowboys and Indians’ with the other boys. On one occasion one of the town’s pranksters, Robey Leibbrandt, was involved. Leibbrandt, the Olympic boxer and Nazi sympathiser who would receive a death sentence for treason during the Second World War, had been born in 1913 and as a teenager went to school in Graaff-Reinet. His father, a Boer combatant described by Smuts as one of his bravest men when clemency was granted to Robey in 1948, was stationed at Graaff-Reinet as an officer in the permanent force from 1914 to 1924. One day during a game Robey and his brothers hanged the son of the school principal with a rope from a tree. Fortunately, his toes were touching the ground and some older men cut the rope to release him. The much younger Boetie, who had just started school, witnessed the incident.\n\nIn 1928 the school magazine included an essay by the twelve-year-old Boetie that gave an indication of his later interest in wildlife. Describing a visit to the Pretoria Zoo, he wrote: ‘The first thing which attracted my attention was the gorgeously coloured speaking-parrots. Then I came to the cage of the gorilla – a mighty big and strong animal. After a few minutes walking I came to the monkey cage from where I walked to the hippopotamus, a very large animal with the largest mouth I have ever seen.’ He concluded: ‘I thoroughly enjoyed this well-spent and interesting afternoon.’\n\nWhen Boetie was in Standard 6 he went on what was meant to be a one-day visit to his uncle Fred Knoetze, a printer at Somerset East who published the local newspaper. The driver who had given him a lift there forgot to pick him up and he spent a whole week with his uncle, who showed him everything at the printing works. ‘The whole printing process, the type faces, the colour samples absolutely fascinated me,’ he related later. This early interest in printing, colour and form would culminate in the scrupulous attention that Rupert as a master of marketing would give to each new product in the tobacco and liquor trade.\n\nIn Standard 8 he obtained four distinctions and was among the ten top students in the Cape Junior Certificate examination. In 1933, his final year at school, he was one of a class of 35, some of whom had started school in 1922, the year the Volkskool was founded, and had completed their entire school career there. At a reunion of eighteen of the surviving members of that class 50 years later Anton Rupert − by then an honorary citizen of Graaff-Reinet − on behalf of the three Rupert brothers presented the school with a Bill Davis sculpture entitled His Hands, inspired by a poem by the Afrikaans poet WEG Louw.\n\nAnton matriculated in 1933 with three distinctions, for English (lower grade), Chemistry and Physics,"
