Soldiers Farewelled

Newspaper ItemExtracted from the Jerilderie Herald and Urana Advertiser dated Friday 4 August 1916

There was a large attendance at the Town Hall on Friday evening last when three of the youngest soldiers of this district - Privates Val. Rochfort, E. Stevens and J. Shannon were farewelled prior to their departure on active service. The function must rank as one of the most enjoyable of its kind yet promoted by the Jerilderie Recruiting Committee, for, on a rough estimate, the floor was occupied during the greater part of the evening by at least 80 couples, not including a considerable number of other, friends and well-wishers who had assembled to bid the boys good bye. Dancing was temporarily suspended during the early part of the evening while the presentations were made. This pleasing duty was performed by the Mayor (Ald.L. Therburn) who, in an appropriate speech, made glowing reference to the fine spirit of patriotism with which their young soldier guests were imbued and ex pressed the hope that he would in the near future have the pleasure of welcoming them home again. To Privates- Rochfort and Stevens he handed orders for wristlet watches, and explained that; Private Shannon had, already received, a similar gift at a farewell tendered him at Berrigan (from which town he had enlisted). In the course of his remarks the Mayor said that this might be termed a unique occasion, inasmuch as the lads were representative of three families who had already responded most generously to the call. Private Rochfort two brothers and Private Shannon's father and uncle had also gone to the front before him. Such a record of patriotism was to be highly commended, and he wished the boys every success and a speedy return. The Mayor's remarks were supplemented by an appropriate speech from Mr. J. A. T, Rochfort, and the lads were accorded three hearty cheers and musical honours. Private Rochfort, on behalf of himself and his comrades suitably returned thanks. Before vacating the platform the Mayor took advantage of the opportunity to address a few remarks in reference to Mr. R. Hanna, another Jerilderie volunteer who was present. This young man had not long ago been challenged to enlist, and he answered by immediately sacrificing his business interests and doing so. After a short stay in camp he contracted rheumatics and was afterwards, unfortunately discharged as unfit. No one perhaps was more disappointed than "Rupe," but he had proved himself a trier, and was accordingly to be commended. The Mayor also drew attention to the local Red Cross Society's intention of sending Xmas boxes containing suitable gifts to the Jerilderie District boys at the front. It was the Society's intention to send one to every soldier and he hoped that all present would lend their assistance in compiling the gifts, which could either be forwarded to the Secretary of the Red Cross or to Mr. Jas. Fox. After the National Anthem had been sung dancing was resumed and a most pleasant time was spent. Two factors which greatly contributed to the general enjoyment were the excellent music supplied by Mrs. Wilson (assisted by Mrs. Meillon and Miss Elliott), and Messrs. Wilson (violin) and McVittie (cornet); and the tasty refreshments prepared by the ladies of the town. The rendering of Auld Lang Syne and the National Anthem brought a most enjoyable evening to finality. Privates Rochfort, Stevens and Shannon left to re-join their respective units on Saturday morning carrying with them the best wishes of all for their future welfare.
