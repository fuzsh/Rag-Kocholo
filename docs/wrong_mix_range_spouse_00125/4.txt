29 Jan â€“ It was reported that the Twins duo - Charlene Choi and Gillian Cheung - will be working together in an upcoming online series.

As reported on On CC, the news was shared by their label EEG, saying that both stars will be starring in a 12-episode drama, to be co-produced by China's Tencent Penguin Pictures.

Charlene reportedly will play the role of a forensic scientist, while Gillian will get to play the drama's main villain for the first time in her acting career.
