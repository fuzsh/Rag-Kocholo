Smith & Wesson 439

A Smith & Wesson 439 is used by one of the thieves in the robbery.

Glock 17

The Glock 17 can be seen in Chong Tze-wai's (Daniel Wu) holster during the briefing of the robbery case.

A Mossberg 500 Cruiser is used by one of the thieves in the robbery.

Remington 870

The Remington 870 is used by one of the guards during the robbery.

What appears to be a Heckler & Koch HK91 is used by a sniper from Kwan's visualization of a possible scenario.
