As a student, Whitneyâs "ah-ha!" moment while water testing made her realize science is not just lab coats and test tubesâscience happens outside, too. Even more empowering, the data Whitney and her peers collected in Yosemite were used by actual scientists to impact actual field science studies! That set Whitney on a path that included earning a Bachelorâs degree in Environmental Policy and a Masterâs degree studying the impact of climate change on grassland ecosystems. Today, Whitney is the Executive Coordinator for the National Park Service Friends Alliance.

Anya decided, on her NatureBridge trip in the eighth grade, that she wanted to be a park ranger in Yosemite. Less than 10 years later, she made that dream a reality. After completing dual degrees in Earth Climate Science and Environmental Science at Duke University in 2023, Anya continues pursuing her passion for the outdoors and conservation.

Julie discovered a love of the outdoors and the National Park Service's mission when she was a high school student at NatureBridge Yosemite. She went on to earn a degree in wildlife management and built a career with the National Park Service (NPS), becoming Chief Ranger at Point Reyes National Seashore. Julie now protects the landscapes she fell in love with as a teen, overseeing law enforcement, fire programs and public outreach.

NatureBridge acted quickly to add capacity through this new locationâdubbed our Bluff Campusâwith a vision to serve an additional 150 students each week. Located just a short hike from NatureBridgeâs Beach Campus overlooking the Pacific Ocean, our Bluff Campus gives more students access to fully experience the Marin Headlands.

Opening a new campus is a massive undertaking! This year, our Golden Gate staff have dedicated their time to preparing our new facilities for the arrival of students, including working in the kitchen, shuttling supplies and dishes to our Beach campus, all while the space was undergoing significant maintenance. We thank our Golden Gate staff for going above and beyond, using their creativeness and dedication to our mission to ensure success for students at this new site!Â

Supported by a generous grant from the National Park Trust, the addition of this campus will open the door to thousands more students to experience the Marin Headlands every year, and be inspired to take meaningful action to protect the natural world.

Jason has brought his Graham Park Middle School students since the campus opened in 2012, valuing how programs align with Virginia learning standards while fostering critical life skills like teamwork, self-reflection and confidence.

âNatureBridge gives my students and so many others the chance to learn science in the outdoorsâan opportunity most wouldn't have without scholarship support. This program can ignite a passion for nature and science in students.â

â Jason Brown, teacher and Mid-Atlantic Board Member

Jason's passion is shared by the Prince William County School District, a key NatureBridge collaborator. This partnership, bolstered by a Department of Energy and Environment grant, hopes to make the NatureBridge experience part of the 7th grade curriculum districtwide. Such support enables more students to forge formative connections with nature in the national park in their backyard.

âIn order to serve the state parks so others can enjoy a piece of what I got to experience in Prince William Forest I signed up to the (YCC) Youth Conservation Corps. Overall my experience has inspired me and has shown what a great place the great outdoors really are. My experience will hopefully one day inspire others to go outside and appreciate mother nature and go explore with friends and just have fun.â

Our week-long intensive staff training for Olympic educators includes everything from how to row a Salish-style canoe to how to effectively teach climate change education to middle schoolers.

Since 2014, hundreds of educators have gotten to work with and learn from Olympic Education Manager Emily Volz. Emily spearheads staff training and ensures our programming remains impactful for students. She would also tell you that she learns just as much from educators as they learn from her.Â

âBeing able to guide students into any ecosystem where they explore their wonders and ask questions is a pretty sweet job. Like the students we serve, I want our staff to feel welcomed, supported and heard.â

â Emily Volz

Olympic Environmental Science Educator Maddie Mclean spoke to this directly in the speech she gave at last fallâs Evening on the Lake, our annual fundraiser supporting our Olympic campus. In her remarks, Maddie specifically acknowledged how critical their roles as educators and facilitators are to a positive student experience, oftentimes going beyond simply teaching material and guiding students through team-building games.

âIt was my job over the next four daysâ¦to create not only learning experiences, but a space in which each student could develop their own relationship with nature, hopefully finding moments of independence, collaboration and awe along the way.â

The evening included a special screening of "The Beautiful Undammed: The Elwha River 12 years after dam removal,â followed by an expert panel featuring Olympic Board member Kim Sager-Fradkin, Allyce Miller and Vanessa Castle. The event was capped off with a moving speech by NatureBridge Olympic Environmental Science Educator Maddie Mclean. With her powerful words, Maddie eloquently conveyed the indelible impact our programs have on students and the pivotal role our educators play in fostering a deep connection with the natural world. Her speech was a reminder of the profound influence donor support has on shaping the next generation of environmental stewards.
