        "text": "Strength and unity. Those words characterized AARP Foundation in 2022. I have been genuinely moved by the sameness of heart that exists within this community of staff, volunteers, donors, and partners. A shared devotion to the work underpinned everything the Foundation accomplished last year.\n\nOur staff wrapped up two years of remote work and connected in person once more. This was nothing new for the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) team, who were back in the community mere weeks after things shut down, working with local partners, and providing in-person service to older jobseekers. For everyone else, however, stepping back into our offices felt like a homecoming.\n\nSome programs continued to build on their established success, as they had done all along; others injected fresh ideas and energy into their offerings to increase their impact.\n\nOur small but mighty legal advocacy team, who had spent two years pursuing their cases remotely, argued before judges in person instead of on Zoom, bringing the voice of older adults back into the nation’s courtrooms.\n\nOur remarkable volunteers rejoined their classrooms, community centers, libraries and more, never missing a beat in the transition back from remote volunteering.\n\nAnd our generous donors, who unfailingly stood by us all through the pandemic, came through as they always have for the older adults who need their support.\n\nBecause of all this, we were able to fight systemic injustice and help older adults seize opportunities to re-enter the workforce, bolster their budgets, give back to their communities, and recover from disasters. No matter when or how we came back, we were united in our purpose: to work even harder to achieve our vision of a country free of poverty where no older person feels vulnerable.\n\nIn 2022, we grew stronger. Together.\n\nWith gratitude,\n\nClaire Casey, President\n\nAARP Foundation\n\nRead more from Claire\n\nCitations\n\n1 AARP Foundation SCSEP is funded by a $46,889,529 grant from the U.S. Department of Labor.
