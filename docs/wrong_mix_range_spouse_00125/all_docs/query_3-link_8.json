It doesn’t need to be a physical “table”, rather it refers to the act of getting a deal done.\n\nComing together with negotiating counterparts at the “bargaining table” is a situation fraught with potential mishaps, all of which are compounded by the pressure to get the best deal a negotiator can for herself or her organization.\n\nBefore you get to the bargaining table, however, remember that, even when not based in reality, the expectation that someone is “tough” or “cooperative” becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When you approach an allegedly tough competitor with suspicion and guardedness, he is likely to absorb these expectations and become more a more competitive negotiator. All the more reason to cultivate a cooperative reputation from the start and strive to maintain it at all costs.\n\nLet’s take a look at three guidelines to help you make the most of the power you have when you sit down at the bargaining table.\n\nDon’t squander your negotiating power. Objective power doesn’t always translate into strong outcomes. In fact, the greater the perceived power differential in a negotiation, the more likely counterparts will be to view an upcoming negotiation as a competition rather than as a collaborative enterprise.\n\nDon’t let a lack of power get to you. A lack of objective power can harm people’s sense of psychological power, with detrimental effects on their outcomes. However, weaker parties may be able to bolster their performance and outcomes at the bargaining table by thinking about times when they had power in a negotiation.\n\nDo take practical steps to boost your power. Even as you work on enhancing your psychological power, there are steps you can take to improve your actual power at the bargaining table.\n\nYou can improve your skills at the bargaining table by downloading a complimentary copy of our special report, Negotiation Skills: Negotiation Strategies and Negotiation Techniques to Help You Become a Better Negotiator, from Harvard Law School, right now!
