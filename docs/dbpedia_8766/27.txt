Discovering the Wonders of Petra: A Guide to Exploring the Ancient City of Jordan

Petra, the ancient city carved into red sandstone cliffs in Jordan, is a bucket list destination for many travelers. This ancient city, once the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom, is a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of the human spirit. With its towering temples, intricate tombs, and awe-inspiring Treasury, Petra is a must-visit for anyone interested in history, architecture, and natural beauty.

If you’re planning a trip to Petra, here’s what you need to know to make the most of your visit.

Plan your visit: Petra is located in the southern part of Jordan and is accessible by car or bus from the nearby city of Wadi Musa. The site is open year-round, but the best time to visit is between October and March when temperatures are more moderate. During the summer months, temperatures can reach well over 100°F, visiting Petra strenuous and uncomfortable.

Choose your entrance: There are two entrances to Petra, the main entrance and the back entrance. The main entrance is located near the Visitor’s Center and offers access to the Treasury, Monastery, and other popular sites. The back entrance, on the other hand, is a longer hike but offers a more secluded and peaceful experience.

Wear comfortable shoes: Petra is a vast site and you’ll be doing a lot of walking, so make sure to wear comfortable shoes and bring plenty of water. The paths can be rocky and uneven in places, so sturdy shoes are a must.

Get a guide: While it is possible to visit Petra on your own, hiring a guide can greatly enhance your experience. Guides can provide context and insight into the history and significance of the various sites, as well as take you to lesser-known areas of the site.

Allow enough time: Petra is a massive site and you’ll need at least a full day to see the highlights. If you have more time, consider spending a night in one of the nearby hotels so you can see the Treasury and Monastery by night, when they are lit by candles.

Be respectful: Petra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it’s important to respect the rules and regulations in place to preserve this ancient city. This means not climbing on the ruins, not taking souvenirs, and respecting the local Bedouin communities.

Visiting Petra is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and with a little planning, you can make the most of your time there. Whether you’re a history buff, an architecture enthusiast, or simply someone who appreciates natural beauty, Petra is sure to leave you in awe. So pack your bags, grab your camera, and head to Jordan to experience the magic of Petra for yourself.
