        "text": "You don’t hear much about the Nabataeans these days.\n\nWhen people discuss ancient civilizations around the campfire, conversation inevitably gravitates toward the Greeks, the Romans, the Persians of Cyrus or the mysterious Tang Dynasty. We forget about the great cultures that flared around the rim of this Eurocentric history — the Nabataeans receive little press coverage\n\nBut spend a few hours at Petra, and you will quickly discern the folly of that omission.\n\nA visit to the Petra Museum\n\nActually, you could spend an hour in the Petra museum and emerge rather impressed. Through several well-designed exhibits, the museum (which doesn’t charge admission) provides a basic overview of the history and culture of the Nabataeans.\n\nThe Petra Museum is exemplary in every way. Its excellent exhibits are educational and engaging; it displays real artifacts found on the site; and the gift shop is a small room, a slight fraction of the much larger exhibition space.\n\nThis is what a museum should look like."
