        "text": "Petra Ancient Ruins\n\nVisit the ancient ruins of Petra\n\nPetra, which lies south of Jordan’s capital Amman on the edge of the mountain clad desert of Wadi Araba, was at the crossroads of the main trade routes used by caravans and merchants for many centuries. These trade routes were used to transport high-value resources and rare spices between the Mediterranean and the Near East, Africa and even India.\n\nHistory\n\nThe ancient rock city of Petra is thought to have been first established around the 6th century B.C, by a nomadic Arab tribe known as the Nabataeans. The Nabataean tribe were considered to be a Semitic group of people who laid the foundations for a commercial empire that later extended into what is today known as Syria. This article will inform you more about Petra ancient ruins.\n\nThe Majestic Ruins\n\nThe ruins of Petra are mainly known for its three large structures thatwere carved into the rock face, officially known as the King's Wall.\n\nThe first, is the Urn Tomb, which is a preserved monument that faces an open terrace and is covered by a row of double vaults.\n\nNext is the Corinthian Tomb, which is a smaller version of the Khazneh and is followed by the Palace Tomb that was named so because of the glimmering effect of the rock it was cut out of.\n\nA bit further away from the Royal Tombs, lies a tomb that was built in 130 A.D., for the Roman governor who ruled during Petra’s annexation. The Treasury of the Pharaoh is Petra’s most imposing façade asit standsmore than 40 meters tall and was cut directly from the rock of the mountainside.\n\nSupport Structures\n\nThe Siq, is a name given to a gorge that was formed by the torrent of the river Musa.This gorge was subsequently blocked by the Nabataeansusing a dam, and channeled it to carry precious drinking water to the city.There is a series of inscriptions that can be foundalong the rock walls of the Siq.\n\nDecline and Ruin\n\nThe numerous natural calamities that constantly hit Petra, including earthquakes and flash floods, eventually triggered the slow decline of city and eventually led to its abandonment. The city then remained forgotten for over 5 centuries and was known only to natives. It was not until the early 1800s that western explorers would rediscover Petra, which has today become one of the worlds most famous and regularly visited ancient sites. It is claimed that barely 5 percent of the city has been unearthed, with many more mysteries yet to be revealed.\n\nPetra Ancient City Of Trade\n\nTrade in the ancient city of Petra\n\nThe ancient stone city of Petra is known to have flourished for several centuries, even way after it was annexed to the Roman Empire in 106 A.D.However, the Roman Empire eventually moved its center of trade away from Petra to a location closer to the coast, which caused the city's importance to slowly fade way. Over time, the city that was once the center of a bustling and vibrant trading route, was abandoned and fell into ruins due to centuries of natural calamities and neglect.\n\nOrigins of Trade\n\nAlthough it is not exactly known when the ancient city was built, the fact thatthe city began to prosper as the capital of the Arab Nabataean Empire and its people is well established. This is estimated to be from the 1st century BC, which allowed Petra to grow rich through commerce and thetrade of valuable resources such as myrrh, frankincense, and various spices.\n\nRags to Riches\n\nOver time, it is has also been established that the Nabataean Empire had further gone on to become successful traders due to their keen survival skills and vast knowledge of the desert. Not to say that the location of Petra didn’t have anything to do with it as they gained control of most of the vital trade and caravan routes that were used to move spices and incense from central Arabia to places like Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea as well.\n\nIt is also a well-known fact that these earlier, nomadic merchants eventually became very rich and slowly gave up their simple, nomadic lives and shoddy tents to build the grand structures, houses, aqueducts and other monuments that came to be known as the city of Petra. However, the actual reason as to why the Nabataeans gave up their nomadic life to settle down in one single place is still a widely speculated mystery.\n\nPeak of Trade and Civilization\n\nWith the development of regular trade into caravan trade, Petra began serving as the Middle East’s vital trade center between the kingdoms of Arabia, and the eastern Mediterranean. The city eventually reached its peak population ofan estimated 20,000 people, roughly 2,000 years ago.\n\nAnd after the Roman annexation of Petra, the caravan trade began to fade out. And, although the historic trade city was occupied even during theMiddle Ages, it was constantly hit by a series of earthquakes and other natural calamities that eventually led to its abandonment. It is also known as the Petra ancient city of trade.\n\nPetra Ancient City of Stone\n\nDiscover Petra, the ancient city of stone\n\nPetra,which is the Greek word forrock, is the name for a town in Jordan that has been carved entirely out of the sandstone desert cliffs in the region. The ancient city is situated at an estimated three hours drive, south of Amman, the capital of Jordan.Petra was apparently founded by anancient nomadic Arab tribe known as the Nabataeans. Historians claim that the city was established centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ, the biblical Christian messiah.\n\nBrief history\n\nThe Nabataean tribe was a very skilled tribe and were very renowned for their in depth expertise in various skills includingagriculture and trade, architectural stone-carving, and even engineering. Historians further claim that the ancient city of Petra could have possibly been established in 312 BC or even earlier, and wasthe designated capital city of the Nabataeans and its people. Today, the city is a standing symbol of Jordan’s rich culture and heritage and is alsothe kingdoms most popularly visited tourist attraction.\n\nLocation\n\nPetra, ancient city of stone is situated on a slope of the area known as Jebel al-Madhbah, in a basin that lies among the chain of mountains which form the eastern flank of Wadi Araba. Wadi Arabi or Arabhah is a large valley that runs from the Dead Sea right up to the Gulf of Aqaba.\n\nPrevalence\n\nAs in 1985, this ancient has been identified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its cultural importance and the highly advanced civilization that lived there.

It is also one of the premier and prominent tourist sites in the Middle East. This historical city was even used as a filming location for the widely popular, 1989 American feature film,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\n\nAlthough the ancient city was literally carved from nothing but the sandstone cliffs of southern Jordan, the Nabataean tribe that inhabited ithad constructed a wide array of tombs and temples, houses, great halls, altars, and evenaqueducts. The Nabataean had established an advanced civilization that was located at the crossroads of the ancient Far East, and was a center for trade and commerce as the various“spice”routes and trading trails of thatera were all flowing through Petra.\n\nRediscovery\n\nAt the peak of its civilization, the city of Petra had housed some nearly 20,000 Nabataeans. This tribe had successfully built an overly advanced system of aqueducts and waterways that provided their city with the precious water, in the middle of the arid desert. And when the city was \"rediscovered\" during the early 1800s, many clues to the habits and routines of daily life in this were unearthed.

A help at the temple recommends that the structure may have been devoted to the god Dushara.\n\nAn alternate structure, known to archeologists at the \"Great Temple,\" contains a little theater in an outline like a cutting edge ensemble lobby. It was substantial to such a degree as to fit around 600 individuals with its external layer of seats having a breadth of around 110 feet (33 meters).The third temple is placed halfway up a slope, is the Temple of the Winged Lions, so named on the grounds that portrayals of winged cats were found close to its altar.
