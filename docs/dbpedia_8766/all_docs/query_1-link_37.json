        "text": "“The [Petra Gorge, Al Siq] opens up onto Petra’s most magnificent façade, the Treasury, or Al Khazna. It is almost 40 meters [131 feet] high and intricately decorated with Corinthian capitals, friezes, figures and more. The Treasury is crowned by a funerary urn, which according to local legend conceals a pharaoh’s treasure. Although the original function is still a mystery, The Treasury was probably constructed in the 1st century B.C. However, in reality, the urn represented a memorial for royalty. The Treasury consists of two floors with a width of 25.30 meters [83 feet] and a height of 39.1 meters [128 feet].\n\n“The purpose of the Treasury is unclear: some archaeologists believed it to be a temple, while others thought it was a place to store documents. However, the most recent excavation here has unearthed a graveyard beneath the Treasury. The Treasury comprises three chambers: a middle chamber with one on either side; the elaborately carved façade represents the Nabataean [Kingdom’s] engineering genius.” — www.visitpetra.jo/DetailsPage/VisitPetra/LocationsInPetraDetailsEn.aspx?PID=6\n\nFor an introduction to Petra and the Nabataean Kingdom, which was at its height from 100 B.C. to 106 A.D., see our previous blog post, “Petra Al Siq (Gorge), Petra, Jordan”.\n\n“Al-Khazneh is one of the most elaborate temples in Petra, a city of the Nabatean Kingdom inhabited by the Arabs in ancient times. As with most of the other buildings in this ancient town, including the Monastery, this structure was carved out of a sandstone rock face.” – Wikipedia\n\n“Carved directly into vibrant red, white, pink, and sandstone cliff faces, the prehistoric Jordanian city of Petra was “lost” to the Western world for hundreds of years. Located amid rugged desert canyons and mountains in what is now the southwestern corner of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Petra was once a thriving trading center and the capital of the Nabataean empire between 400 B.C. and A.D. 106. The city sat empty and in near ruin for centuries. Only in the early 1800s did a European traveler disguise himself in Bedouin costume and infiltrate the mysterious locale. In 1985, the Petra Archaeological Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and in 2007 it was named one of the new seven wonders of the world. Several scenes from the Hollywood blockbuster [movie] Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade were filmed in Petra…\n\n“The Nabataeans, before they were conquered and absorbed into the Roman Empire, controlled a vast tract of the Middle East from modern-day Israel and Jordan into the northern Arabian Peninsula. The remains of their innovative networks of water capture, storage, transport, and irrigation systems are found to this day throughout this area. Scholars know the Nabataeans were in Petra since at least 312 B.C., says archaeologist Zeidoun Al-Muheisen of Jordan’s Yarmouk University. Al-Muheisen, who has been excavating in Petra since 1979 and specializes in the Nabataean period, says no one has yet found any archaeological evidence dating back to the fourth century B.C. The earliest findings thus far date back only to the second and first centuries B.C. But more clues remain beneath the surface. ‘We have uncovered just 15 percent of the city,’ he says. ‘The vast majority — 85 percent — is still underground and untouched.’ Numerous scrolls in Greek and dating to the Byzantine period were discovered in an excavated church near the Winged Lion Temple in Petra in December 1993. Researchers at the American Center of Oriental Research in Amman, the capital, are now analyzing the scrolls and hope they will shed light on life in Petra during this period. Once Rome formally took possession of Petra in A.D. 106, its importance in international trade began to wane. The decay of the city continued, aided by earthquakes and the rise in importance of sea trade routes, and Petra reached its nadir near the close of the Byzantine Empire’s rule, around A.D. 700.” — www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/lost-city-petra\n\nLegal Notices: All photographs copyright © 2023 by Richard C.

A mountain north of the AlUla Valley, AlAqra’a, features more than 450 early Arabic inscriptions. Naqsh Zuhayr, to the east, features one of the oldest inscriptions of the Islamic era which dates back to 24AH (644 CE). There is no such site that is more significant, than Jabal Ikmah, home to the highest concentration of, and most varied inscriptions, in AlUla.\n\nAt Jabal Ikmah there were several informative interpretative signs in English (most text in Al-‘Ula is in Arabic, but, with the drive to encourage more foreign tourism, the Saudi government’s Royal Commission for Al-‘Ula has had many interpretative signs translated into English). “There are thousands of inscriptions across AlUla. As different peoples passed through the region or made it their home, they chose to leave their mark. The earliest are dated from the 9th to the 10th century BCE, some were written by professional scribes, others by ordinary people. The inscriptions are incised, painted, and in relief, and include Aramaic, Thamudic, Dadanitic, Minaean, Nabataean, Greek, Latin, and Arabic languages. Among the things, they record are journeys, pilgrimages, and offerings. The wealth of inscriptions at Jabal Ikmah and across the AlUla region provide insights into the origins and development of the Arabic language.”\n\nJabal Ikmah appears to have been a sacred place, not only for the Lihyanites but also travelers who pass through AlUla. They were inspired to carve a record of their journeys, pilgrimages, and offerings. These inscriptions give us insights into the economic, political, religious, and social lives of their authors. Many record offerings to the Lihyanites god, Dhu Ghaybah, and request protection for journeys ahead. Most of the inscriptions are written, and Dadanitic, whose alphabet was written from right to left, with 28 letter forms. A vertical line or two dots placed on top of each other were used to separate words.\n\n“Languages represented in these inscriptions include Aramaic, Dadanitic, Safaitic, Thamudic, Minaic, and Nabataean, all languages that predated and eventually influenced Arabic. All these scripts and languages have been deciphered, which increases the historical significance of this place. This mountain truly bears witness to the tumultuous history that unfolded in this region through the millennia. The topics represented in the inscriptions range from names of people with little or no additional information, to detailed descriptions of religious rituals, commercial transactions, and transcriptions of local laws. Several geographical names are also mentioned, including Badr, Tha’al, and Mahja, which testifies to the crucial role that the city of Dadan played along this trading route.\n\n“In addition to writings, there are also drawings of human figures, animals, and everyday tools. Stylized representations of humans are generally drawn in the act of performing a task, such as hunting, herding, or farming. As for animals, in addition to the predictable depictions of camels, there are also deer, sheep, goats, and a conspicuously muscular bull. Finally, several tools can be recognized, including farming and hunting implements, and musical instruments.” — www.atlasobscura.com/places/jabal-ikmah\n\nOne of the most exciting archaeological objects on display at the museum at the entrance to Hegra (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) was the result of a recent discovery of a Nabataean Kingdom tomb. One of the skeletons in the tomb belongs to a woman, 40 to 45 years of age. Archaeologists have been able to translate the inscription found at her tomb: “This is the tomb which Hinat, daughter of Wahbû, made for herself and for her children and her descendants forever. And no one has the right to sell it or give it in pledge or write for this tomb, a lease. And whoever does other than this, his share will revert to his legitimate heir. In the twenty-first year of King Maliku, King of the Nabataeans.”\n\nAround 80 individuals were discovered by archaeologists in this tomb, commissioned by a woman for her family and future generations. skull was selected for a ground-breaking facial reconstruction project.\n\nA team of archaeologist, academics, and specialists in the fields of forensic science and modelmaking created the world’s first digital and physical reconstruction of a Nabataean woman. She is known as “Hinat” by the archaeologists who discovered her. Evidence suggests she died between the first and second centuries BCE and lay in a tomb for over 2,000 years. Drawing on the deep knowledge of archaeologists and expertise of forensic scientists, the woman’s face was digitally “rebuilt” from a three–dimensional scan of the skull. This provided the foundation for the skilled modelmakers to create the physical reconstruction that was on display at the Hegra Museum.\n\nMore details on the “Hinat” project were written up in a recent National Geographic article: “By the late fourth century BCE, the Nabataeans, a tribe most likely from central Arabia who had established themselves at what is now Petra in modern Jordan, were becoming wealthy from trade in frankincense, spices, and other luxury goods. As their kingdom expanded, they founded new centers of trade and culture, settling in Hegra—roughly 300 miles, or 500km, south of Petra—in the first century BCE. Their unique civilization blended elements of diverse cultures, fueled by wealth from their role in trading valuable commodities, and they carved fabulously elaborate tombs into the sandstone cliffs that surround Hegra.\n\n“Two thousand years later, archaeologists investigating the tombs carved into Jabal Ahmar, a mountainous outcrop on the edge of the residential area of Hegra, selected one for close study. Known as the Tomb of Hinat daughter of Wahbu, it was filled with unusually well-preserved materials such as buried human remains — bones, skin and even hair — along with textiles, leather, vegetable matter, and other substances.\n\n“This tomb had another very special attraction, as Laïla Nehmé, the director of the Hegra archaeological project explains: ‘The Nabataeans are a bit of a mystery: we know a lot, but at the same time we know very little because they didn’t leave any literary texts or records. Excavating this tomb was a wonderful opportunity to learn more about their idea of the afterlife. Besides, this tomb has a very nice inscription carved on its façade, which says it belonged to a woman called Hinat.’ Who was Hinat? We don’t know for sure. But in 60 or 61 C.E., she had carved [a] message onto a panel above the entrance to her tomb [see text, above]…\n\n“Gathering as much information as possible from the materials unearthed in the tomb led to an intriguing idea. By analyzing one of the tomb’s skulls, a question arose: Could we use existing knowledge in forensics and paleopathology (the study of disease in ancient people) to reconstruct the face of the person who died and was buried here? Such a reconstruction — the first ever attempted of a woman from the Nabataean period — would have immense value in being able to tell the story of Hegra, and of Nabataean civilization, to a worldwide audience.\n\n“But who to choose? Analysis of one of the skeletons in the tomb revealed it was a woman, aged between 40 and 50, around 5 feet 3 inches tall (1.6m), and the nature of her burial suggested she was of medium social status. Taking a lead from the tomb’s inscription, archaeologists affectionately named her Hinat, and she became the project’s focus.\n\n“Then came a gathering of international experts in London to lay the groundwork for the reconstruction project — archaeologists of Nabataean civilization, specialists in digital and physical facial reconstruction, forensic experts, and science communicators — who would translate a computer-generated image into a physical bust of Hinat. With almost no images discovered in Nabataean art, and very few human remains surviving, the specialists had to use a carefully judged mix of professional rigour and artistic interpretation to make key decisions about Hinat’s features — her eye-color, skin tone, how many wrinkles she had, what clothes she wore, and the style of any jewelry or ornaments. [At the museum we learned the earrings on the modeled “Hinat” were created from 2,000 year-old earrings found near “Hinat” in her tomb.]\n\n“Forensic sculptor Philippe Froesch talks about how every scrap of scientific knowledge was exhausted before artistry came into play: “We created a subjective portrait using [pre-existing] data,” he says…\n\n“At last, after having lain undisturbed in the sands of Hegra for twenty centuries, Hinat — or a woman who may have known Hinat, probably as a member of her family — gazed back at the awe-struck scientists, the result of a months-long, scientifically rigorous, and artistically innovative process. Curatorial Manager and archaeologist Dr. Helen McGauran identified the value of such a remarkable project for the 21st century. ‘Here are common threads of humanity that can be recognised in the Nabataean story,’ she says. ‘The openness to the outside world [and] the interaction with other cultures and communities.’ Hinat’s two-thousand-year-old face has a lot to teach us.” — www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-meeting-hinat\n\nLegal Notices: All photographs copyright © 2023 by Richard C.

It is investing heavily in infrastructure to make the site accessible and an excellent experience for visitors (Saudis and foreigners, alike). The government’s goal is to preserve Al-’Ula’s uniqueness and to develop tourism responsibly by preserving the area’s cultural and natural heritage, creating jobs for the local communities and keeping the area as a nature reserve (including the rare Arab leopards). We spent two nights at the Banyan Tree (Resort) that opened in October 2022 in Al-‘Ula [see our previous blog post, “Banyan Tree (Resort), Ashar Valley, Al-‘Ula, Saudi Arabia”].\n\nThe “Experience AlUla” website notes that visitors are invited “to come journey through a living museum of preserved tombs, sandstone outcrops, historic dwellings and monuments, both natural and human-made, that hold 200,000 years of largely unexplored human history. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has long been a crossroads of ancient civilisations — a place of deep history, but one that is constantly evolving.”\n\nThe lush Al-‘Ula oasis was a trading route hub, being crisscrossed by camel caravans loaded with incense, spices, beads, glazed ceramics and other traded good, dating back several millennia. The Nabataean Kingdom [known by many travelers as the creators of Petra, Jordan, another principal city — on the trading route from Aqaba, Jordan to Istanbul, Turkey] created its principal southern trading route city in Hegra (also known as Mada’in Saleh), in the Al-‘Ula region of the Ashar Valley, Saudi Arabia, beginning at the end of the 1st millennium B.C./BCE. The city was built at a crossroads of the trading route between the Arabian Peninsula, the Mediterranean World, and Asia. The city of Hegra was at its peak from 100 B.C./BCE to 106 A.D./CE. At Hegra, the Nabataean elite buried their dead in elaborate cliffside tombs. Along with the tombs, visitors can find wells and stone-lined water channels (like those in Petra, Jordan) that demonstrate the Nabataean civilization’s expert craftsmanship. Hegra, with its sandstone cliffs and tombs, was the first site we visited in the valley.\n\nHegra (also known as Mada’in Saleh) was left practiacally undisturbed for almost 2,000 years. The former Nabataean city has 111 well preserved tombs set into the sandstone cliffs in the desert landscape. The Jabal Al Ahmar sandstone outcropping, whose name refers to the red hue of the rock, has 18 tombs, several of which are in the photographs, below. Hegra is Saudi Arabia’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site, named to the list in 2008.\n\n“Hegra contains 111 carefully carved tombs, far fewer than the more than 600 at the Nabataean capital of Petra. But the tombs at Hegra are often in much better condition, allowing visitors to get a closer look into the forgotten civilization. Classical Greek and Roman architecture clearly influenced construction, and many tombs include capital-topped columns that hold a triangular pediment above the doorway or a tomb-wide entablature. A Nabataean “crown,” consisting of two sets of five stairs, rests at the uppermost part of the facade, waiting to transport the soul to heaven. Sphinxes, eagles and griffins with spread wings—important symbols in the Greek, Roman, Egyptian and Persian worlds—menacingly hover above the tomb entrances to protect them from intruders. Others are guarded by Medusa-like masks, with snakes spiraling out as hair.” — www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/hegra-ancient-city-saudi-arabia-untouched-for-millennia-makes-its-public-debut-180976361/\n\nA sign on site asks the question, “What was Hegra like?” and then provides an answer: “The bustling residential area of Hegra was located in the center of this plain, overlooked by the outcrops containing the tombs. Archaeological excavations show it included many one-storey houses, markets and workshops, encircled by a wall. At the center of the city was a large sacred enclosure surrounding a temple. On top of this was a white sandstone monument which formed a spectacular landmark. A Nabataean inscription suggests that it was dedicated to the ‘God in the sky.’”\n\nQasr Al Farid (the “lonely castle”) is said to be the tomb of Lihyan, son of Kuza, belonging to a very prominent Nabataean individual or family and was carved in the 1st century A.D./CE. In Al-’Ula, this tomb is unmatched when it comes to ancient design and architecture. The tomb measures about 72 feet [22 meters] tall.\n\nOur local guide told us that the tomb was begun (and paid for) by a prominent Nabataean who, as a general was killed in battle (perhaps against the Romans in 106 A.D./CE) before his tomb was finished — note the rough, unfinished rock at the bottom of the carved façade. This, and other evidence, shows that the Nabataeans carved the tomb facades beginning at the top of the façade and then worked their way down the façade. Qasr Al Farid bears some overall resemblance to the much more elaborate “Treasury” tomb in Petra, Jordan, another contemporary Nabataean trade route city.\n\n“Intimidating inscriptions, common on many of the tombs at Hegra but rare at Petra, are etched into the facade and warn of fines and divine punishment for trespassing or attempting to surreptitiously occupy the tomb as your own. ‘May the lord of the world curse upon anyone who disturb this tomb or open it,’ proclaims part of the inscription on Tomb 41, ‘…and further curse upon whoever may change the scripts on top of the tomb.’” — www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/hegra-ancient-city-saudi-arabia-untouched-for-millennia-makes-its-public-debut-180976361/\n\n“…one of the beautiful and unique things about AlUla is that it is this palimpsest of human civilization for many thousands of years. You have this near continuous spread of 7,000 years of successive civilizations that are settling in this valley — important civilizations that are just now being revealed to the world through archeology.” — www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/hegra-ancient-city-saudi-arabia-untouched-for-millennia-makes-its-public-debut-180976361/\n\nLegal Notices: All photographs copyright © 2023 by Richard C.
