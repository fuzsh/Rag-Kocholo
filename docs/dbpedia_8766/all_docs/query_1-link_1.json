        "text": "Over time, their sharp survival skills and knowledge of the desert helped the Nabataeans become successful traders. They gained control of the important trade routes that moved spices and incense from Arabia to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nWe know that these nomadic merchants became very rich as desert traders, and slowly gave up their goatskin tents to build the grand houses and monuments that became Petra. But it is a mystery why these people gave up their nomadic life to settle down in one place.\n\nThe Nabataeans were experts at surviving in the desert because they knew how to collect and distribute water . An impressive system of rock-cut channels and underground water pipes carried water from permanent springs and seasonal streams.\n\nThe Nabataeans also developed a way to collect and store water in watertight holes or cisterns. Hidden underground, these cisterns kept water safe from both evaporation and enemies.\n\nHauling heavy loads across the vast, barren deserts was hard and risky work. For a price, the Nabataeans provided shelter and water at settlements along the trade routes. They also charged tolls to foreign traders for crossing into their territory. All the profits helped pay for the Nabataean state, including the spectacular capital of Petra.\n\nTrade brought more than wealth and exotic goods to Petra. As traders from around the world passed though Petra, they brought new ideas and culture from places like Egypt, China, and Greece. Petra became more than a center of trade—it was also a cultural center of the ancient world.\n\nThe people of Petra liked to show off their wealth and hired master builders to create these masterpieces. Starting from the top down, builders chiseled the detailed designs by hand right into the sandstone cliffs. The design of the massive columns, grand staircases, and classical statues show the influence of contact with Greece and Rome.\n\nWinding roads, stairways, and water channels were also cut along the natural curves of cliffs and canyons.\n\nBut the most breathtaking \"road\" in the city wasn't carved by humans. The Siq , the narrow, winding gorge that led into Petra, is a natural wonder.\n\nAs Petra flourished, the powerful Roman Empire was expanding into the Middle East. The Romans were eager to expand the boundaries of their empire, and in A.D. 106 they took control of the Nabataean capital. It appears the Roman takeover was peaceful, and life in Petra went on without much change. But the empire left an unforgettable mark on the ancient city.\n\nThe distinct Roman style can be seen all over Petra, in the monuments, sculptures, public spaces, and even in the city's design. The Romans built new roads, like the impressive Colonnaded Street that ran through the center of Petra. Lined with massive columns, this long, straight street was unlike anything else in the city.\n\nRome ruled Petra for the next 300 years, tying the fate of the ancient city to the empire. Eventually, Rome moved the center of trade north. The empire also turned to shipping by sea for much of its trade. Petra's importance in the ancient world began to fade.\n\nOver the next century, the people of Petra slowly abandoned their pagan gods for this new religion. The city's main cathedral, the Petra Church, was a dazzling symbol of this new era. Even a few once-sacred tombs, like the Urn Tomb, were turned into churches.\n\nThe city's power as a trade center had been falling. Trade routes were shifting north or toward the sea. In A.D. 363, Petra suffered another blow when a massive earthquake destroyed many of the city's buildings and its water-supply system.\n\nThis natural disaster marked a turning point for the Nabataeans. By A.D. 700, only a few people lived in and around Petra. Over time, the city was lost to the outside world.\n\nMore than 500 years would pass before the ancient city was rediscovered by Western explorers."
