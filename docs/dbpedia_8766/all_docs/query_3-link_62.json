The ancient city was carved from the rock by the Nabateans more than 2,300 years ago. Invaded, looted, then forgotten by the western world until it was rediscovered once more in the 1800s.",

        "text": "Originally established as a settlement by the Nabateans, the first recorded reference to Petra was in 312 BCE when the Greek Empire failed to gain control over the city. Later in 106 CE, after much bartering, the Romans would succeed where the Greeks had lost, claiming Petra as their own and renaming the city Arabia Petraea.\n\nAfter an earthquake in the 4th century CE, the Romans left the city, and it was taken over by the Byzantine empire, who considered Petra to be the capital of the province of Palaestina. But after 300 years of rule, they too left the city as it no longer held importance for trade.\n\nEach empire has left its mark on Petra, much of it inspired by the rock-cut architecture of the early Nabateans. Although Petra is often described as a lost city, nomadic shepherds remained in the dwellings even after it lost its economic importance.\n\nIn 1812, the Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, disguised as a Bedouin man, travelled to the ancient city of Petra, putting it back into the European spotlight. It attracted a lot of attention, not all good, and was excavated and surveyed in the years that followed.\n\nWhen Petra was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985, the Bedouin tribespeople who had once again made homes for themselves within the ruins were forcibly relocated by the Jordanian government.\n\nIt’s believed that 85% of Petra is yet to be uncovered. Given that UNESCO has already listed over 800 monuments, the settlement must have been one of the biggest in the ancient world.\n\nThe Siq\n\nThe 1.2km alleyway of Al-Siq guides you into the ancient city of Petra. This unique geographic feature is caused by an underground fault that split the rock apart following a shift in tectonic forces.\n\nThe result is a grand winding entrance, adding to the sense of anticipation and mystery as you make your way towards the Treasury. As you walk through the Siq you get glimpses into the ceremonial passageways and remains of millennia-old terracotta pipes that once carried water into Petra.\n\nThe Treasury\n\nAs you leave the cool dark walkway, you will emerge right in front of the Treasury, immediately recognisable from the film ‘Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade’. Known as Al Khazneh, the Treasury is actually a grand tomb for a Nabatean king.\n\nEuropean looters nicknamed it the Treasury due to the wealth found inside. If you look closely, you can still see the bullet holes where tomb raiders littered the building with ammunition to set off any booby traps.\n\nThe Royal Tombs\n\nThe first royal tomb you will come to is the Urn Tomb. This tomb is built high on the mountainside and requires climbing several flights of stairs. There are three chambers above its doorway, and the central chamber is blocked by a stone that depicts the man buried inside.\n\nWander between the grand columns and explore the back rooms within. On the rear wall is an inscription recording the consecration of the tomb as a church in 447 AD.\n\nOther tombs to visit include the Silk Tomb, the Corinthian Tomb, and the Palace Tomb, thought to be similar to the Roman palace design of the Golden House of Nero. These tombs show a mix of Hellenistic architecture and Eastern traditions, marking a significant meeting of East and West at the turn of the first millennium.\n\nThe High Place of Sacrifice\n\nThe High Place of Sacrifice is named after its high location, perched on the Jebel Madbah Mountain. Named al-Madhbah in Arabic, it was mainly used to sacrifice animals to the Nabatean God Dushara.\n\nIt’s well worth the hike to the top as the views of the ancient city of Petra are mesmerising. At 170 metres high, the High Place of Sacrifice is not only an important historical site but also one of the tallest locations in Petra.\n\nThe Monastery\n\nClimb the 800 sandstone steps to the beautiful Monastery. It will take around an hour to get there and about 30 minutes to get back if you are quicker downhill. Try not to ride the donkeys even though it saves time - they aren’t treated fairly and contribute to erosion. By not riding them, you will help to stop the cruel practice.\n\nAlong the walk, you will meet many locals selling their wares. You can buy or, alternatively, trade your own things for Bedouin crafts within Petra. Trade is still a common form of payment in this culture, and it can be a fun way to recycle your items and support the true custodians of Petra.\n\nWhen you arrive, get a traditional coffee from the small tea shop opposite the Monastery. The Monastery is also a nickname, and it is called Al-Deir in Arabic. Historians believe the carved crosses discovered inside the building that led to the nickname were a Byzantine-era addition when the space was repurposed as a church.\n\nThe months of December, January and February can see a lot of rain and even snow. Night-time temperatures can plummet below freezing in nearby Wadi Rum. June, July, August and September see temperatures of over 30 degrees centigrade and little to no rainfall.\n\nWeather-wise, the shoulder months of April, May, October, and November are the best times to visit Petra. Visit early in the morning to have the place to yourself, or visit in the evening to see the treasury lit up by candlelight.\n\nWhile it's possible to visit Petra in one day, the more time you spend there, the better. The site is vast, and there are many hikes and different routes. In addition, the ticket prices encourage you to hang around for a while and take a few days to explore the ancient city.\n\nPetra is open from 6 am - 6 pm in the summer and 6 am - 4 pm in winter. The quietest times to visit Petra are usually in the early mornings and late afternoons.\n\nPetra is also open in the evenings between 8.30 pm-10.30 pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays for the candlelit 'Petra by Night' experience."
