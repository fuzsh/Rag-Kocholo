        "text": "Petra is the crown jewel of Jordan and the most visited tourist destination so no visit to the Middle Eastern country is complete without a visit to this ancient city. Famous for its rock-cut architecture carved into pink stone, Petra was known as the ‘‘Rose City’ at its peak. While the city stood abandoned and forgotten for centuries, it’s now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and open to travelers year-round.\n\nIf you want to know how to get to Petra and what to see while there, here’s the ultimate guide for you! Having survived for thousands of years since its construction in the 4th century BC, Petra is a highlight during any trip to Jordan and is fairly easy to get to via public transportation. Located to the southwest of the tourist-friendly destination, you can rest assured that you won’t have any hiccoughs on your road to Petra.\n\nBesides Petra and its many monuments, there are many more sites to explore and activities to do in the immediate area so plan to spend at least two to three days visiting everything at leisure. Just make sure to wear comfortable shoes and bring plenty of water as you’ll be walking a lot. Mrhbaan!\n\nThis article may contain affiliate links that in no way impact the reader or their privacy.\n\nThe city that would eventually be known as Petra was first established at the foot of Jabal Al-Madbah Mountain as Raqmu, the capital of the Nabataen Kingdom. A nomadic people who inhabited the area as early as the 4th century BC, their society would continue to flourish as they set up other successful settlements connected by extensive trade routes that branched from the Euphrates River in modern-day Iraq to the Red Sea. Given the arid and frequently barren condition of their surroundings, their presence dominated the area, leading to a consolidation of their power.\n\nThe Nabateean’s prosperity resulted in more growth and expansion and, at the height of their civilization, their kingdom was home to tens of thousands of residents. This wealth sparked the construction of several intricate rock-cut monuments embedded into the rose-tinted stone within the Arabah Valley where their stronghold stood. This architectural style was influenced by their interactions with prominent Hellenistic kingdoms throughout the Mediterranean and its beauty would garner the city the name the ‘‘Rose City.’’\n\nIt wasn’t until about the 2nd century AD that the Natabataens’ territory would be annexed by the Roman empire and rebranded as Arabia Petraea, a moniker that would stick for eons beyond its conquest. This assimilation would eventually be Natabataens’ downfall as maritime trade routes began to take precedence over land routes, shifting resources away from the landlocked kingdom. A devastating earthquake in 363 AD would strike the final blow as many inhabitants fled the crumbling infrastructure and, by the 7th century, Petra would remain mostly abandoned, a city lost to time.\n\nPetra would be briefly rediscovered by the Crusaders in the 12th century but, as soon as they left it again, it would stay forgotten for roughly the next seven hundred years. The Rose City would fade into antiquity, earning it the new nickname, the ‘‘Lost City,’’ until 1812 when Swiss explorer, Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, uncovered its location once more. Burckhardt’s contribution and courage to history can be understated as his journey to Petra would be long and fraught with peril.\n\nBorn to a wealthy family of silk merchants, Burckhardt studied study Arabic at Cambridge Univesity before heading to Syria to deepen his understanding of Arabic culture. On the way there when in Malta, the Swissman heard of the unfortunate tale of a German explorer who’d been murdered while attempting to find Petra. Undaunted by the grisly events, Burckhardt continued on to Syria, adopting the alias ‘‘Sheik Ibrahim ibn Abdallah’’ to conceal his European origins.\n\nHowever, during his time in Arabia, Burckhardt would be robbed several times by the guides he’d pay to ensure his safety, including the sheik of Karak, which resulted in the Swissman being deserted in the desert. Luckily, he was ultimately saved by a tribe of Bedouins and carried on his journey southward, undeterred.\n\nHearing evermore whispers of ancient ruins in the area, Burckhardt would inevitably stumble upon Petra in August 1812, becoming the first European to lay eyes on the lost city in centuries. His rediscovery would eventually cause the area to be excavated as archeological interest grew and, by 1985, Petra would be recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as well as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.\n\nThese days you can find the ancient city situated in an area known as Wadi Musa, the ‘‘Valley of Moses,’’ named after the legendary biblical figure who allegedly founded the city with a strike of his staff as he guided the Israelites out of the desert.\n\nThe most convenient way to get to Petra would be by private car but this option can be incredibly pricy given that Jordan is one of the most expensive destinations in the world, with a currency worth more than the euro. Hence, I wouldn’t recommend hiring a driver unless you’re traveling in a group or are very pressed for time.\n\nThe next fastest way would be to rent a car and drive from either Amman, the capital to the north, or Aqaba, the largest city in the south. Again, this is a great option if you’re traveling in a group and want the chance to explore other regions freely as Petra is only a few hours’ drive in either direction.\n\nHowever, for my fellow eco-backpackers, I implore you to use public transportation instead as it’s clean, affordable, reliable, and more environmentally sustainable. Depending on your starting point, there are a few ways you can reach Petra by bus.\n\nFrom Aqaba\n\nIf flying into King Hussein Airport (AKA Aqaba Airport), don’t be surprised to be solicited by taxi drivers as soon as you exit, offering to whisk you away to destinations such as Petra or Wadi Rum. As previously mentioned, the fares that taxis will offer are generally exceedingly exorbitant for solo travelers so alternatively plan to stay in Aqaba overnight. You can always spend the day sunbathing at the Red Sea in the meantime!\n\nVia Local Bus\n\nFrom Aqaba, you can take the local bus or a coach bus to your final destination. While the first option is the cheapest, with fare costing just a few euros, it’s also the most time-consuming as local buses won’t depart until mostly full. This delay can take up to two hours so the local bus is only advisable for the most budget-conscious travelers or those seeking to immerse themselves fully in the local experience. Buses are scheduled to take off between 7 AM to 8 AM from the local bus station next to the police station just east of Princess Salma Park so drop by the day before if possible to confirm the departure time. With frequent stops, the total journey can last between three to five hours so ultimately you get what you pay for.\n\nVia Coach Bus\n\nOn the flip side, I suggest splurging a bit on taking a coach bus serviced by JETT Bus, the main bus operator in Jordan. There’s one departure daily from Aqaba to Petra that leaves at around 8 AM (check the timetable here) from the JETT Office just north of McDonald’s on Hussein Street. Conveniently, you can buy tickets online and reserve your seat weeks in advance to save yourself some hassle down the road, with fares starting at about 15JD (20€). The travel time to Petra is between 3 to 4 hours, depending on traffic and weather conditions.\n\nWhile the main entrance to Petra is located closer to the valley floor, most hotels and similar accommodations were built right onto the surrounding hillsides. This factor means that the further away your lodgings are from the town center, the farther up you have to hike to get back, which might not be an easy feat after a day of trekking around Petra.\n\nDuring the day, there’s a taxi stand stationed in front of Petra’s main entrance but in the evening or late at night, it may be more difficult to hail a cab as drivers head home. Therefore, it would be wise for travelers without cars or with reduced mobility to stay as close to the town center as possible.\n\nI’ve tried to highlight the most conveniently-located digs so even for the most able-bodied travelers who won’t mind a bit of a trek, here are the best places to stay in Petra according to your pocketbook:\n\nCheapest Backpackers Hostels\n\nRafiki Hostel\n\nThis budget-friendly hostel is just the place to be to make new friends thanks to its large communal living room, kitchen, and glass-enclosed rooftop.

Visitors traveling in large groups can book beds in their shared dormitory rooms or reserve a private double or triple room. Every room comes with mountain views, central heating, AC, an ensuite bathroom, a complimentary breakfast buffet, and free parking.

With so much to love about Petra Moon Luxury Hotel, you’ll never want to leave!\n\nMövenpick Petra Resort\n\nSet right near the main entrance to Petra, this marvelous, 5-star resort is the best place to stay for high rollers looking to make the most of their vacation, no matter the cost.

Between the extravagant digs and concierge service, you might just end up finding your new home away from home.\n\nResting at 810 meters (about 2700 feet) above sea level, Petra’s elevation among desert mountains and canyons both mean that keeping an eye on the forecast is paramount. While summers tend to be blisteringly hot yet arid, winters are often cold and wet, resulting in flash floods which have led to the deaths of a few tourists over the years. The high altitude also causes the air to be oxygen-poor, possibly leading to elevation sickness or shortness of breath for more delicate travelers. Moreover, the archeological site is equal parts massive and meandering, with several hiking trails that are not at all suitable for visitors with reduced mobility.\n\nHence, it’s essential to wear comfortable walking shoes as an average trek across the lost city of Petra can take at least two hours, not including the journey back to civilization. Sun rays are typically quite strong year-round so the use of suncream with a high SPF factor is also advisable while bringing water to quench your inevitable thirst is non-negotiable. If visiting in summer, I recommend wearing breezy clothing as temperatures soar by mid-day, easily hitting 35ºC (95ºF), as well as a hat to prevent heat stroke.\n\nOn the other hand, rainy winter days can also be bone-chilling, with thermostats dropping to 5ºC (41ºF) by nightfall (a huge factor if you plan to attend Petra By Night). Whereas winter mornings can be quite frosty regardless of the weather forecast, sunnier days are usually rather warm by mid-afternoon so the best tactic would be to wear layers that can be conveniently removed throughout the day. You’ll definitely want some long johns come sunset, however, so long-sleeved shirts and full-length pants are preferable.\n\nThe last thing you’ll want to do is lost out on your time in the Lost City because you were overdressed or underprepared. Always check the weather forecast, regardless of the season.\n\nCovering a territory of 264 sq. kilometers, Petra is made up of a massive landscape of majestic monuments, hidden tombs, and scenic hiking trails. While many of the landmarks are not suitable to visit for travelers with reduced mobility, as long as you can have a comfortable pair of walking shoes and plenty of water, you should have no problem getting around the vast region.\n\nPetra has two main entrances to its north and south, with the latter being closer to the Vistors’ Office and the town center. Most visitors begin at the southern entrance since it’s also the closest to the most famous sites such as the Treasury, however, beginning on the northern side has many advantages which is why I’ll start there.\n\nMain differences between Petra’s northern and southern entrances\n\nNorthern Entrance\n\nEntering from the northern side of Petra entails a bit more steps than the other option but makes for an easier exit and faster route back to Petra’s town center. To get to the northern entrance, you’ll have to take the free shuttle bus to Little Petra (more on that in a bit), whose primary stop is the parking lot behind the tourist office. There, you can find a fleet of minivans that will whisk you away once it’s full enough. The shuttle buses typically run from 9 AM to 3 PM so make sure to ask about the timetable at the Vistors’ Office the day before if possible. You can alternatively ask the driver, although this option leads to little recourse as you won’t be returning the way you came.\n\nOnce the minivan has departed, the almost 8-kilometer ride to Little Petra only takes a few minutes as you cruise through the ruggedly gorgeous Jordan countryside. If you’re lucky, after being dropped off at the entrance of Little Petra, there should already be another vehicle (this time an open-air jeep) waiting to transport travelers onward to Petra. If not, feel free to explore Little Petra for a moment as you wait, which should only be a few minutes since jeeps roll through frequently between pick-ups. The jeep is not included in the Jordan Pass and costs around 5JD, which can be paid at the booth to the right of the drop-off point or directly to the driver. You can expect this ride to be bumpy yet exhilarating as the jeep barrels its way over rocky terrain so just make sure to hold onto your hats (literally).\n\nFrom here, you’ll be deposited at the base of a mountain where you’ll have to hike the paths oscillating through the rugged surroundings. The hike takes around 30 minutes up to an hour, depending on your walking speed (I averaged 40 minutes), with the way being intercut with a mix of hiking trails and stone steps which you’ll have to navigate up and down. Thankfully, there are many refreshment stands (but no bathrooms) located on this route so you can take frequent stops as necessary to really take in the jaw-dropping views of the mountain valley (your girl was speechless and out of breath).\n\nEventually, you’ll stumble upon Petra’s second-most famous site, the Monastery, in front of which you’ll find a large rest stop with a restaurant and outdoor seating area as well as bathroom facilities (costs around 1 JD even with a purchase). Just to the right of the monastery, you’ll find the path heading towards the rest of Petra, which consists of several stairs mostly descending toward the valley floor. After an arduous hike, the remainder of the journey through Petra is quite easy and most of the paths are lined with vendors’ stalls, selling cheaper Petra souvenirs than the ones you can get at the far end of the ruins. The Treasury is the last landmark you’ll come across, making for the perfect end to a day already filled with so much beauty.\n\nSIDENOTE: Noticed how I never mentioned needing to validate your entry ticket after arriving at the Monastery? Wonder why that might be?\n\nSouthern Entrance\n\nIn comparison, the northern entrance is accessible directly from the town center, just past the red ‘I Heart Petra’ sign. Continuing on, you’ll find the Vistors’ Office in the area to your left where you can purchase entry tickets (entering with the Jordan Pass is the best option, though) as well as book tours with certified local guides (a pricy experience but worth it for gaining more context into Nabaeten society).\n\nFrom there, you can continue through the lobby toward the right to get to the turnstile leading into Petra where you’ll have to check your ticket (seemingly not a requirement at the other entrance?). The open terrain is fairly flat on the path at that point but after a few dozen meters, you’ll come upon the mouth of a deep canyon where the walls of the valley tower several meters tall, a passage known as As Siq.\n\nIn total, you’ll have to walk just over a kilometer through the winding cliff faces until you spot a clearing in the distance, bringing you right up to Petra’s most visited landmark, the Treasury. The rest of the ruins lay on the large path to the right of the Treasury but exiting from the other side won’t be nearly as easy as entering the site since most monuments from here on out will be on an upward incline, meaning you’ll have to be prepared to trek from place to place a bit (the increasingly stunning views definitely merit the effort).\n\nThe main drawback to entering from Petra’s southern entrance means that there are only two ways to make it back to the town center; either, returning the way you came or hiking up, out, and through the mountains via the northern route (read more on this here) until you come to the stop for the jeep to take you to Little Petra. The only problem is there might not be a guarantee that there is a jeep coming for you, depending on the hour, and the last shuttle bus from Little Petra to the town center usually stops at 3 PM, meaning you’ll have to make it back by then or walk around another 8 kilometers back. However, if you have a car, you can always leave it parked at Little Petra and explore Petra’s sister city afterward. Nevertheless, these issues are all my biggest reasons for recommending that you enter from the northern entrance instead but you can decide whichever route works best for you.\n\nAd Deir (The Monastery)\n\nMeasuring over 48 meters tall and 47 meters wide, the Monastery is one of Petra’s signature landmarks and the first one you’ll come across when you enter from the Lost City’s northern entrance. Erected in the early 2nd century AD under the rule of the Nabataen king, Rabel II, the building consisted of a wide central space beset by benches on the sides and an altar at the rear. It also served many purposes during its prolific lifetime, first being used as a meeting place for religious organizations before eventually being converted into a Christian chapel, earning its current moniker.\n\nBONUS TIP: You can find the monastery right across from one of Petra’s only rest stops for the next few kilometers.\n\nThe Theater\n\nThis grand amphitheater is one of the most striking landmarks in Petra, whose beauty is best observed from above to truly take in its scale. Located at the end of the Street of Facades, the 1st century AD theatre was the largest public venue that was frequently used for cultural events. The structure was carved into the side of the mountain at the base of the High Place of Sacrifice, taking inspiration from Roman architectural styles to better enhance the acoustics. Made up of three rows of seats divided by seven passageways, seven staircases also lead upward, guiding up to 4 thousand spectators at a time.\n\nFUN FACT: While all Roman and Hellenistic theaters are built of stones and other materials, Petra’s theater is the only one in the world to be carved into stones, a distinctly Nabataean trait.\n\nThe Street of Facades\n\nThe most famous street in all of Petra, the Street of Facades connects from the center of Petra to the Treasury via a gorge. The pathway was named after the monumental tombs lining the cliff faces, some of which are false facades and others of which scale up several meters off the ground. Many of these tombs were dedicated to senior officials and minor royal family members, however, a few were allocated for less prominent inhabitants. One of the most scenic sights in the Rose City, this street is impossible to miss.\n\nAl-Khazneh (The Treasury)\n\nThe most emblematic landmark in the entirety of Petra, the Treasury has earned its right to grace several postcards since its breathtaking facade began gracing the Lost City in the 1st century BC. The building’s immense stature towers nearly 40 meters high, with its beauty unrivaled throughout the ancient ruins as its intricate facade boasts many carved designs, including floral patterns and figurines. Decorated with a funeral urn at its top, the monument derives its name from a local Bedouin legend about the treasure of an Egyptian pharaoh that was supposedly hidden within the vessel. No matter which route you take to get to this iconic site, it’s sure to take your breath away.\n\nSIDENOTE: You can expect to see many local Bedouins offering tours of Petra as well as guidance to some of its most mesmerizing views. I was lucky enough to get to know a few of them as well as befriend the owner of the cafe just in front of the Treasury (Merhaba, Faesal!). Most Bedouins are quite honest and hospitable so make sure to negotiate a fair rate for a tour, which would still be far cheaper than a similar tour booked through a tourist agency (consider it helping out the local economy).\n\nBONUS TIP: To take a photo from above, there are two main paths, one to the left and another to the right when facing the Treasury. The right path is the easiest since it's accessible via stone steps while the one on the left (which arguably offers a better view) takes some scaling, made easier by tipping any of the local Bedouins milling within the area.\n\nAs Siq (The Siq)\n\nA deep gorge flanked by 80-meter cliff walls that winds its way through to the heart of Petra, the Siq is an ancient passage formed by the fissure of a mountain that measures between 3 to 12 meters wide. Spanning for over a kilometer from the town of Petra to the Treasury, the main entrance into Petra narrows just as it reaches the ruin’s most famous site, opening onto the captivating building. The Siq is also paved with stones laid by its Nabataean founders and decorated with sacred stones known as the Sabinos Statues that are just as enchanting to discover as the rest of the Lost City.\n\nBONUS TIP: The Siq tends to flood during heavy rainfalls and due to its narrow size, the passage tends to fill with water quickly, which has resulted in a few tourist deaths over the years. Make sure to always check for weather advisories before taking this route into or out of Petra.\n\nDjinn Blocks\n\nThese gigantic stone blocks were carved right out of sandstone into different square formations embossed with detailings and easily visible on the path between the Siq and the town. Thought to have been constructed somewhere between the 3rd and 2nd century BC; there are some of the oldest relics in Petra, possibly created to house protective spirits for both the living and the dead. Named for the Djinn (ancient genies) contained within, local superstition against angering the magical entities has likely kept these blocks from damage from local intervention. The magnificent sight is bound to capture your attention on the road to or from Petra.\n\nBONUS: Little Petra\n\nOfficially known as Siq al-Barid (translating to ‘‘cold canyon’’), the archeological site known as Little Petra is similar to its counterpart in terms of design and was built around the same time as the Rose City. The main difference between the two places is that, as its nickname suggests, Little Petra is only a fraction of the size yet thankfully is typically much less crowded than its more famous sister. About 8 kilometers north of town, Little Petra is free to enter and accessible via a free shuttle bus from the tourist office. From the bus stop, simply cross the parking lot to enter Little Petra and begin exploring this marvelous, deeply-underrated site.\n\nThere are many activities to thrill and delight you in and around Petra, including eating (and dancing) at the oldest bar in the world. While much of the ruins may be inaccessible to travelers with reduced mobility, those physically able to can hire various forms of transport to usher them around, such as golf carts, horses, and camels. Thanks to their ability to navigate the rocky terrain, the latter is the best option to get around rather than on foot.\n\nMoreover, just within the Visitor’s Center is Petra’s main museum, filled with displays dedicated to honoring the ruins’ most precious artifacts and memorabilia uncovered during its extensive excavation. For an even more magical experience, why not attend Petra by Night, a candle-lit affair accompanied by musical performances of traditional instruments? Although some might find the experience overrated, I stayed until Petra closed and the crowds had cleared to watch the locals set up the show, and having the place nearly all to myself before the hoards descended again was truly unforgettable.\n\nIf you do attend the weekly event, make sure to stop by the Cave Bar after for the perfect nightcap. Believed to be the longest-existing establishment of its kind, the restaurant offers some tasty local fare before converting into a bar with live music where you can dance the night away. If you want to grab a bite to eat, Mr. Falafel near the town serves scrumptious authentic cuisine for competitive prices.\n\nWhatever attracted you to Petra, you can rest assured that the real thing holds up to expectations, making for a remarkably memorable experience. Write me when you get there!\n\nMay you get lost in the wonder,\n\nM"
