Tuttle\n\nPart I: This lecture introduces and explores the Nabataean Kingdom, which arose during the Hellenistic period and grew to control all of the lands of the modern state of Jordan. We examine the Nabataeans’ origins, identity, culture, and capital cities.\n\nPart II: This lecture delves deeper into how the Nabataeans’ mastery of water and overland trade in deep desert landscapes built their kingdom. We explore how these two resource masteries shaped the Nabataeans’ interactions on the global stage of their time."
