        "text": "The ancient city of Petra dates back to the 4th century B.C. It is in what is now Jordan. Once a great metropolis and trading centre, the ruins are now important and popular tourist attractions. Petra was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorers. Explorers discovered Petra under a layer of ancient sand and nicknamed it “The Lost City.” The rulers of the new Byzantine Empire wanted to spread Christianity. In 330 C.E., Rome moved its capital to Byzantium and gained more control over the eastern provinces. The people of Petra gradually abandoned the pagan gods to support this new religion over the next century.\n\nPetra\n\nPetra Jordan is Also known as Rakumu or Rakumu by the locals; Petra is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. It is next to Mount Jabal Almadova in a mountainous basin that forms the eastern side of the Alaba Valley from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Petra has existed since at least 7000 BC. In the 4th century B.C., the Nabataeans may have settled in the 4th century B.C. Settled in the capital of their kingdom. The only evidence of the existence of the Nabataeans has been discovered, dating back to the 2nd century B.C.\n\nWhen Petra was announced as the capital, the Nabataeans made a lot of money from trade, and Petra became the centre of their wealth. Unlike the Nabataeans, enemies used to live in barren deserts and could take advantage of the mountains and hilly regions to hide and attack. Their speciality was rainfed agriculture, harvesting, and stone carving. Petra peaked in the 1st century A.D. when the famous mausoleum of King Aretas IV was built, and the population reached 20.000.\n\nReligion\n\nThe religion of the ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is a mystery. The discovery of the ruins in 1811 by German explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt and inscriptions on the walls written in Greek and Latin languages gave historians a glimpse into Petra’s past.\n\nUnfortunately, finding out more about this lost city has been difficult due to its location deep inside what was then, the Ottoman-controlled territory. It wasn’t until 1925 that Petra was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, and exploration for more artefacts began.\n\nThe discovery of more inscriptions, a church, and the remains of a graveyard, have not yet offered anything concrete on Petra’s cultural tapestry. Archaeologists have been able to test the language and culture of some of the grave markers to determine that they were written in Greek, or at least Greek/Latin mixed context. They are trying to decipher whether the city had an indigenous population with its own culture before being conquered by Nabatean nomads.\n\nArchaeology has also uncovered ancient texts suggesting that Petra’s inhabitants worshipped various gods. They are thought to be much older than those worshipped by Nabateans.\n\nThe consensus is that some indigenous inhabitants of Petra worshipped Zeus and Demeter during the Hellenistic Period (323-63 B.C.). Then after being conquered by Alexander the Great (356-323 BC) and his Greek allies, they began to worship more Greek gods such as Dionysus and Apollo. By 167 B.C., Petra’s city was under the Seleucid Empire’s control, and thus more Greek gods were added to the roster, such as Athena, Artemis, and Asclepius. The Roman Period (63 B.C.–325 AD) introduced Jupiter and Cybele.\n\nPetra Jordan\n\nPetra is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site that attracts tourists from all over the world. Petra’s charm lies in its excellent location deep in the narrow desert canyon. To reach the site, one passes through a 1-kilometre-long valley with a 200-metre-high wall. Petra’s most famous monument, the Treasury, rises dramatically at the end of the search. The Treasury’s huge facade is just one of many archaeological wonders found in Petra.\n\nHundreds of buildings, tombs, baths, burial chambers, temples, arched doorways, colonnaded streets, haunted rock carvings, 3,000-seat open-air theatres, vast 1st-century monasteries, and a modern ruins Museum. All of this can be explored slowly. The Mamluks built a modest shrine on Mount Aaron in the Sahara Mountains in the 13th century to commemorate the death of Moses’ brother Aaron.\n\nThe Ancient City of Petra\n\nPetra is an ancient city dating back to the 4th century B.C. It is located in what is now Jordan, dating back to. Once a great trading centre and metropolis, the ruins are now important and popular tourist destinations. Petra was probably founded in 312 BC. Founded in B.C., it is one of the oldest cities globally. It was the capital of the ancient South Arabian Nabataeans, who lived around the 6th century B.C. The ruins of the ancient city of Petra are located in southwestern Jordan. Petra was built on a terrace pierced from east to west by Wadi Musa (Valley of Moses).\n\nConclusion\n\nLocated between the Red Sea and the Dead Sea, the capital of the Nabataeans’ cave, inhabited from prehistoric times, is the intersection of Hellenistic and Roman times, Arabia and Rome, with Arabian incense, Indian spices, and Chinese silk. It has become an important caravan centre. Egypt, and Syria Fenicia. Petra is half-built and half-carved into the rock, surrounded by mountains with passageways and canyons. During the Nabatea, Roman, and Byzantine eras, sophisticated water management systems allowed extensive settlement in essentially dry areas. Surrounded by an impressive red sandstone landscape, it is one of its richest and largest archaeological sites."
