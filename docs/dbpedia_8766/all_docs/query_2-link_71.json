        "text": "Petra is an ancient city located in the southwestern part of Jordan, near the town of Wadi Musa. It is renowned for its unique and impressive rock-cut architecture, earning it the nickname “Rose City” due to the color of the stone from which it is carved. It was the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom in the 4th century BC and later became a major trading hub. The city itself is a labyrinth of rock-cut structures, revealing the mastery of a civilization that thrived in the arid desert. Petra has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985.\n\nThe area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC. Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC, by which time Petra had become their capital. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra’s proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.\n\nPetra was the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom in the 4th century BC and later became a major trading hub\n\nThe Petra Theatre is one of the notable architectural features within the ancient city of Petra. Constructed during the 1st century BCE by the Nabataeans, the Petra Theatre is an excellent example of the integration of architectural mastery with the natural landscape. Although Roman in design, being carved out opposed to being built is characteristically distinctive Nabataean style and not a Roman manner. The floral capitals of the theater are also distinctively Nabataean artistic element. Minor alterations of the theater were made by Aretas son Malichus II and later on the Romans who re-built the exterior wall. Carved directly into the rock, the theater could accommodate around 4,000 spectators. It was not merely a venue for entertainment; it also served various purposes, such as public meetings, religious ceremonies, and political events.\n\nConstructed during the 1st century BCE, the Petra Theatre is an excellent example of the integration of architectural mastery with the natural landscape"
