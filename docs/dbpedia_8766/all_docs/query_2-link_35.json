        "text": "The ancient city of Petra is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, known for stunning architecture surrounding fascinating ruins giving insight into the ancient world of modern-day Jordan. You might recognize one or two places from Hollywood classics like Indiana Jones and The Mummy Returns, but there’s a heck of a lot more to this ancient city than being a former film set!\n\nTraveling to the Middle East can feel like a big undertaking, and there’s SO much to consider when planning overseas travel to immerse yourself in different cultures. Safety, transportation, and squeezing in maximum fun? Rest assured, Explore Chick has got your back!\n\nKeep reading for everything you need to know about traveling to Jordan and visiting the ancient lost city, and every incredible site you can’t miss!\n\nAncient Petra was carved from sandstone by the semi-nomadic Nabataean culture, and remained the capital city of the Nabataean kingdom for 500 years between 400 B.C. and 106 A.D. After successfully fighting off an invasion from the Greek Empire, Petra eventually fell to the powerful Romans. Nestled among the rugged desert canyons of modern-day Southwestern Jordan, the “Rose City” (named for the color of the stone it’s carved from) was once a thriving empire and a center for trade.\n\nAfter a major earthquake during the fourth century destroyed many buildings in the ancient city, the Romans largely abandoned Petra. This created room for the Byzantine period, during which the empire controlled the Petra area for several centuries. The surviving structures of Petra served as shelter for nomadic shepherds for hundreds of years after the trade-centered city was gradually abandoned.\n\nWhen Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt discovered the lost city of Petra in 1812, his findings drew attention from geologists and archeologists around the world.\n\nAfter Petra began to draw the attention of the Western world, British archeologists began excavating the site in 1929. In the near century since, dozens of discoveries among the ancient ruins have been unveiled. Petra has more royal tombs than the Valley of the Kings in Luxor, Egypt–the burial ground for well-known pharaohs such as Tutankhamun, Seti I, and Ramses II."
