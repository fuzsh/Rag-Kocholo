        "text": "The ancient city of Petra has nestled in the desert of Jordan approximately 240km from Amman. The Rose City of Petra, so-called because of the dusky-pink rock face, was unknown to the Western world until it was discovered in 1812. This isn’t the only reason why this lost city is now one of the new 7 wonders of the world. Read on for the first-timer’s guide to Petra and discover the magic.\n\nJourney Through The Pink City Of Petra\n\nSpending an evening immersed in a traditional Bedouin camp full of colour, warmth, and generosity and a night under a stunning star-studded sky was unforgettable. Hospitality and a love for their beautiful lands are truly at the heart of Bedouin culture.\n\n7 am sees our group clambering into 4×4 trucks and setting off into the desert towards Petra. The early start is made easier by the sight of the sun warming the sand and rocks to give them a glorious golden glow.\n\nOur route took us bumping and bouncing through the desert in Wadi Arabia. It wasn’t the comfiest of rides, we came up with a few techniques on how to position ourselves in the back of the truck especially when we took a bump at speed, the adventure was too hard to refuse though.\n\nPetra, a UNESCO World Heritage Centre is one of the most important archaeological sites in the world. The city, part ‘built’ and partly carved out of rock has been inhabited since prehistoric times and saw occupation and development by the Nabateans, Greeks, and Romans.\n\nSince UNESCO awarded Petra with World Heritage status in 1985, the Jordanian government forced the Bdouls, the largest Bedouin tribe in Wadi Musa, out of the caves to protect the archaeological site. Purpose-built ‘Bedouin Village’ dwellings were created known as Umm Sayhoun, where most still live today.\n\nTrekking From The Back Of The Pink City Of Petra\n\nHiking through the quieter ‘back door’ of Petra, as we did, allowed us the time and peace to enjoy the fantastic views over Wadi Arabia. ‘Wadi’ is an Arabic word for a valley or an, often dry, riverbed.\n\nMagnificent rocks and mountains jut into an endless sky and dunes of gold, ochre, and red undulate to the horizon. Just breath-taking! We passed a few Bedouins along the way with their donkeys, we fed them the cucumbers, tomatoes, and sandwiches from our packed lunch and got on our merry way.\n\nIn Awe Of The Monastery\n\nTurning a corner and suddenly being greeted by The Monastery high above us makes us all stand and stare in absolute awe. This 3rd-century BC building was given its name by the crosses carved into the inside walls which suggest use as an ancient church. The Hellenistic (Greek) frontage looks almost as though it is part of the mountain. The colours and textures blend together in the sunlight.\n\nIt’s just mind-blowing to realise that my walking boots are kicking up dust where our most ancient, forward-thinking, culture-creating and most influential ancestors stood. There are history and beauty in every rugged inch of the vibrant pink, red, and white sandstone that towers above us.\n\nThere’s a café directly in front of the Monastery where you can grab a cup of tea and take in the magic of Petra. It is rare to be able to refuel in such awesome surroundings. If you’re feeling the effects of the sun, you can buy the Bedouin red and whit\n\nGetting closer requires a walk down precariously and quirkily eroded paths and steps lined with Bedouin souvenir stalls and views outwards towards Israel, Palestinian territory and the peak of Jebel Haroun. Each entrepreneurial stall owner has learnt some English phrase to get you over “Looking is free” or “No money, no honey” and many offers from boys on donkeys shouting “Ferrari” to entice us to relieve our weary feet.\n\nThe Royal Tombs Of Petra\n\nThe next stop in this magical Rose City of Petra was the Royal Tombs of Petra – the Urn Tomb, the Silk Tomb, the Corinthian Tomb and the Palace Tomb – situated across from the Roman Theatre looking down on the main walkway. To reach them you have to climb a stairway that leads to the famous Urn Tomb, which was used as a place of worship during the Byzantine Empire.\n\nFinding The Infamous Treasury In Petra\n\nNow for the Treasury which is the most iconic part of Petra thanks, in part, to an appearance in the iconic movie Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. However, no traveller can think of this vast monument of astounding architecture as just a film set.\n\nThe Treasury, Al-Khazneh in Arabic, was built around the 1st century BC by King Areta III Philhellene. He was a lover of all things Greek and The Treasury is heavily influenced by his passion. Lions, the goddess Isis, Winged Victories, majestic columns and urns adorn the facade.\n\nI’m amazed by how well-preserved this sculpture of rock is. The carvings are set deep into the cliff so that wind and rain haven’t been able to take their toll. There are imperfections of course, but these reminders of Petra’s extraordinary age simply intensify the impact of one of the Seven Wonders of the World.\n\nWandering Through The Siq\n\nPassing through the exit of the Rose City of Petra, the high narrow channel in the rock known as The Siq feels as though we are leaving an entirely separate universe behind us. Looking back over my shoulder, I can still see the afternoon light making The Treasury appear as though it’s glowing. 2000 years of time travel is easier than you think in Petra. Just takes a few steps, well, maybe a few more but worth every single one of them!\n\nSUGGESTED READS ON EXPLORING JORDAN\n\nHOW TO SPEND A MORNING IN AMMAN\n\nHOW TO GET THE DEAD SEA EXPERIENCE\n\nVisiting Petra | Travel Essentials\n\nGet Your Jordan Pass\n\nThe Jordan Pass is a cost-effective way of exploring the wonders of Jordan.

The nights are pretty cold though and can be in the minus temperatures.
