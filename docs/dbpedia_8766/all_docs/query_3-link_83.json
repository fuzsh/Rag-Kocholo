Trespassers risk serious injury or elimination. „ ~ Warning sign\n\nPetra is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. A group of archaeologists began an excavation and preservation project among the ruins of the city.[2] The research team started with the uppermost levels of the temple, finding statues of Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. While preparing for excavation of the lower chambers, early imaging revealed a hidden chamber.[3]\n\nThe organization carrying out the excavations also carried out operations in Ilios and Thailand.[4]\n\nGameplay[ | ]\n\nThe map's environment range from high vistas to twisting passageways and deep caverns. A dilapidated bridge stretches across the map, and the ground underneath it can crumble away to reveal a lethal pit. Hopping on a green jump pad will boost a hero up to Petra’s higher levels and unlock new strategic possibilities.[2]\n\nKnown Researchers[ | ]\n\nDr. Nachareon\n\nAl-Hamadan\n\nHamid Faisal\n\nIdannidis\n\nTrivia[ | ]\n\nNote: The following information is taken from (cinematic elements of) gameplay trailers, and is of unclear canonicity.\n\nThe Wayfinder Society carried out excavations in Petra (it is unclear if this is the same organization as described above). The work was interrupted by a firefight between Overwatch and Talon. Talon was driven off by Overwatch with the aid of Venture.[5]\n\nVideos[ | ]\n\nReferences[ | ]"
