Carved and built out of red sandstone, Petra is often nicknamed the “rose-red city.”\n\nWhere is Petra?\n\nPetra is located in the Middle East, in the country of Jordan. More precisely, the ancient city is in southwest Jordan, close to the Israeli border.\n\nIf you want a map of Petra to see where every monument of the ancient city is located, just zoom out on the map above.\n\nHow far is Petra from Amman?\n\nPetra is around 145 miles from Amman, the capital of Jordan, and it takes around three hours to drive from one to the other. The closest modern town to Petra is Wadi Mūsā, whose name translates as “the Valley of Moses.”\n\nHow to get to Petra?\n\nPetra is only accessible by road, so all the transportation options require a few hours, whether you’re starting in Amman or the closer city of Aqaba (less than 80 miles from Petra).\n\nPrivate taxis, airport taxis, and ride-sharing services like Uber and Careem are the most expensive ways to get to Petra. JETT Buses are more affordable, and are comfortable and reliable.\n\nWhat is the closest airport to Petra?\n\nThe closest airport to Petra is the King Hussein International Airport in Aqaba. Aqaba is less than 8O miles and two hours from Petra. King Hussein International Airport receives international flights from Europe (Spain, Germany, Slovakia), Turkey, Egypt, Abu Dhabi, and domestic flights from Amman.\n\nWhen was Petra built and by whom?\n\nWhile the site was occupied in the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods, as well as by Edomites, it was the Nabataeans, an ancient Arabic people, who developed it into a city in the third century BCE and made it the capital of their prosperous kingdom. Under the Nabataeans, Petra became the center of the spice, silk, and incense trade between Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. In 106 CE, the Romans took over Petra and influenced its architecture and the overall design of the city. When Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire, the ancient tombs became churches. The ancient city was initially known as Sela and renamed Petra (meaning “rock” in Greek) later on.\n\nWhy was Petra abandoned?\n\nWhile prosperous for hundreds of years, the change in trade routes triggered the city’s decline. Then, in the year 363, it is believed that nearly half of Petra, including the water-supply system, was destroyed in an earthquake. Despite these obstacles, archeologists believe that Petra, then much smaller, remained inhabited until after the Crusades (13th century), when it seemed to have been abandoned.\n\nWho “discovered” Petra?\n\nWhile Petra was never forgotten by the people of the region, the first European to see the ancient site in hundreds of years was Swiss traveler and scholar of the Arab world Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1812. Disguised, Burckhardt lied his way to Petra guided by a generous and credulous bedouin, pretending to be a student of the Koran. It is believed that until then, local bedouins kept the location of the ancient city secret for centuries.\n\nWhat’s inside the Treasury and the Monastery in Petra, Jordan?\n\nThe Treasury (also known as Al Khazneh, sometimes spelled Al Khazna) is probably the most famous of all the monuments in the ancient city of Petra. Despite its name, the Treasury does not house any treasure but a funerary chamber. Archeologists believe that the 130-foot-tall ornate structure was the tomb of a first-century Nabataean king.\n\nThe Monastery (known as Al-Dayr), whose architectural details resemble that of the Treasury, was also a tomb but was used as a church under the Byzantine Empire. Inside the Monastery are benches and an altar.\n\nWhen does Petra, Jordan, open and close?\n\nPetra is open from 6 AM to 6 PM in the summer and from 6 AM to 4 PM during the winter. Visitors must leave the site before sunset.\n\nTickets to visit the ancient city must be purchased at the Visitors Center only.\n\nWhen can I see Petra by candlelight?\n\nTours of the area around the Treasury by candlelight are from 8:30 PM to 10 PM every Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. Tickets for the candlelight tours are sold at the Visitors Center only.\n\nWas Petra really featured in one of the Indiana Jones movies?\n\nYes, the ancient city of Petra was featured in the 1989 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\n\nThe best hotels in and near Petra, Jordan\n\nWe hope you love the spaces and stays we recommend!
