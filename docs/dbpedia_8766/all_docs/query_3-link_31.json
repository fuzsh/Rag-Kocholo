        "text": "In this picture...\n\nYou can see a long stone path lined with the remains of tall columns.\n\nThe Colonnaded Street was one of the few straight lines in the city. Most of Petra's other roads were windy and steep, following the city's natural hills and valleys.\n\nIn the city's early period, the street had been a wide, winding dirt and gravel path. When the Romans occupied the city, they straightened and paved the street. They also narrowed it to make room for a covered sidewalk and added 72 columns to line each side.\n\nThe markets along the Colonnaded Street bustled with shoppers buying exotic goods from distant lands. This main street ran through the heart of \"downtown\" Petra, past many of the city's important monuments and temples.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou were shopping along this street. What would you have bought?\n\nCoin\n\nIn this picture...\n\nOn the left, you can see a coin with the head of the Nabataean King Aretas IV. On the right is the back of the same coin with Queen Huldu.\n\nMany coins have been found along the Colonnaded Street. They may have been used to buy spices, cloth, or incense at one of the markets.\n\nCoins have helped archaeologists date sites in Petra, but they've also taught us about the respected position of noble women in Nabataean culture. Many coins not only show the ruler but also his sister, wife, or mother.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou could design a coin for Petra. What would it look like?\n\nDecorated Incense Altar\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see the remains of a religious altar that might have been used in a temple.\n\nIncense was one of the most popular items traded in Petra. Incense was a fragrant substance made from tree sap like frankincense and myrrh. It was burned for religious events and also was used as medicine.\n\nFor centuries, traders had been selling Arabian incense to Greece, Rome, and Egypt. The Nabataeans became rich by gaining control of the incense trade around B.C. 100.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou were a wealthy incense trader. What would you trade your incense for?\n\nIn this picture...\n\nyou can see the remains of magnificent, soaring columns that surrounded the Great Temple.\n\nIt stood in the heart of Petra and was an impressive sign of the wealth and power of Petra's rulers. Visitors would have seen grand staircases, colorful, decorated stucco walls, a central theater, and a spacious courtyard below.\n\nArchaeologists don't know if the Great Temple was a place for worship, high courts, or public events. But its grand size and central location prove that it was an important monument in the ancient city.\n\nImagine...\n\nWalking up dozens of stairs towards the temple's small theater for a meeting about trade. What might have been discussed?\n\nElephant Headed Column\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see the details of the top of one of the columns that was found at the Great Temple.\n\nThe Great Temple's lower courtyard, or temenos, was decorated with 120 towering columns. Each column was topped with a large elephant head carved in stone.\n\nThe Nabataeans knew about elephants through their trade with India. The majestic animal became a popular symbol of strength. This discovery shows archaeologists how commerce with other parts of the world influenced local culture.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou were a merchant from Petra traveling on the ancient trade routes. What would you have brought with you?\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see a wide, open area that was filled with gardens and a large pool of water.\n\nThis large pool and elaborate, ornamental garden sat beside the Great Temple. How did the Nabataeans create this artificial oasis in the middle of a scorching desert?\n\nPetra needed to create a system of underground water pipes and cisterns to gather, distribute, and store water to support the city's estimated 20,000 people. They were very successful! The water supply was so abundant that the people of Petra had enough water to create places like this.\n\nArchaeologists don't know the exact purpose of the garden pool complex. Another mystery to be solved!\n\nImagine...\n\nYou had just returned from a long trip, traveling across the desert. What would you have thought when you saw this pool?\n\nWater Pipe\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see a terracotta pipe that was used to transport water in Petra.\n\nWater was a precious resource in the desert. The area received only about six inches of rain per year, yet the Nabataeans seemed to have an abundant supply of water.\n\nAn impressive system of underground pipes carried water from local streams and springs several miles away. Water was collected and stored in reservoirs and cisterns which are watertight holes. These cisterns were often found in high places, like water towers on buildings. With the help of gravity, water pipes distributed water from the reservoirs throughout the city.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou lived in a house in Petra and had access to water. What are the different ways you would have used it?\n\nIn this picture...\n\nOn the left, you can see a man riding a donkey through the Siq, and on the right, you can see a monument found within it.\n\nCaravan drivers knew they were close to Petra as they entered the Siq, the shadowy, winding gorge leading into the city.\n\nSteep walls of jagged rock bordered this long, narrow passage. The Siq provided a dramatic entrance to Petra, but it also served more practical purposes. The deep canyon made the city easy to defend from outsiders.\n\nThe walls of the Siq also held long, rock-cut water channels and clay pipes that allowed the Nabataeans to control the flow of water into and out of the city.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou were walking for about a mile in the Siq. What would you have seen along the way?\n\nCamel Relief\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see the remains of stone carvings: a man's legs and two pairs of camel hooves.\n\nImagine a caravan of 2,500 camels forming a line five miles long across the desert. Each camel carries a heavy load of incense, spices, and perfumes to trade in Petra.\n\nCamels were essential to trade in Arabia. They could go days without water, eat desert plants, and outlast even the fittest horses.\n\nAs a sign of their importance, the Nabataeans carved a larger-than-life relief of a camel caravan along the Siq. Archaeologists believe this artwork proves that camels passed through the gorge and into the heart of Petra.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou were part of a camel caravan traveling to and from Petra. What would you have brought with you?\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see the remains of many columns.\n\nWalking along the Colonnaded Street, a visitor in Petra would have certainly stopped to gaze up at the magnificent Temple of the Winged Lions.\n\nRows of gigantic columns decorated the temple inside and supported its roof. Inside, the altar was surrounded by more columns, each capped with a carved winged lion. The walls were decorated with bright, detailed paintings.\n\nArchaeologists have found many religious artifacts in the temple's ruins, but they still don't know which Nabataean goddess was worshipped inside.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou were hired to paint the walls of the Temple. What would you have painted?\n\nEye-Idol\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see a carved stone image of the main goddess of Petra, al-'Uzza (pronounced: \"al-Huzza\").\n\nKnown by her square eyes and rectangular nose, her image was often found carved into rock walls or in portable statues, like this \"eye-idol.\"\n\nArchaeologists believe the small stone eye-idol was used for several centuries and into the Byzantine era of Christianity. Carefully sculpted from imported stone, it must have been a precious item.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou are an archaeologist who discovered this artifact. How would you try to find out more about it?\n\nEgyptian Statuette\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see the remains of a statue.\n\nMany objects in Petra came from distant lands. This small statue, or statuette, shows a priest holding the figure of Osiris, the Egyptian god of the dead. The skirt behind the body of Osiris belongs to the priest. The rest of the priest is broken and missing. The inscription on the back of the statue reveals that it is from an ancient Egyptian city.\n\nThis figure's discovery in Petra is evidence that the Nabataeans and Egyptians exchanged ideas and images, as well as goods.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou traveled to Egypt from Petra in A.D. 100. What would you have seen in Egypt?\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see a row of tombs carved into the cliffs.\n\nFour of the most spectacular tombs overlook the Colonnaded Street: the Palace Tomb, the Corinthian Tomb, the Silk Tomb, and the Urn Tomb.\n\nKnown as the Royal Tombs, these ancient buildings probably held Nabataean kings and their families. The grand entranceways were carved on a giant scale to honor those who died. Archaeologists still don't know who was buried in each tomb.\n\nPetra might seem like a city of tombs. That's because those tombs were carved into rocks and they have survived through time. The rest of the city was filled with buildings that have collapsed into pieces. Archaeologists have only uncovered five percent of the buried city! Who knows what else they will find.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou are an archaeologist working in Petra. What else do you think you might uncover?\n\nStone Inscriptions\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see a piece of stone carved with an inscription, written in the Nabataean language.\n\nStone inscriptions are official dedications carved into buildings and monuments. Most of the recovered inscriptions consist of names. They reveal who the Nabataeans worshipped and who their kings were. This inscription was dedicated by a local commander of soldiers on horseback.\n\nThese carved messages are especially valuable because they're some of the only Nabataean texts to survive the test of time. Most Nabataean words written on scrolls made of leather or papyrus decayed and disappeared long ago.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou could read these inscriptions. What do you think it might say?\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see the remains of the temple walls that are still standing.\n\nLong before Petra became a great city, a temple was built at the intersection of two caravan routes. Over time, Petra grew around this grand monument, which is now called the Qasr al-Bint (pronounced \"Ka-tser-al-Bint\").\n\nVisitors would have approached this towering, marble-face temple from the Colonnaded Street, walked through a grand archway called the Temenos Gate, and into a large, sacred courtyard.\n\nInside the temple, a wide hall led into three small, inner rooms. The middle room was the holiest space, holding an altar to Petra's main god, Dushara. It is believed that the Qasr al-Bint is dedicated to this god, who was compared to the Greek god Zeus.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou were a nomad. How would your life have changed as Petra grew into a big city?\n\nChild's Ring\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see a side view of a small gold ring with a stone in it.\n\nThis child's ring was discovered among the ruins at the Qasr al-Bint. It may have been left as an offering or dropped by accident. It probably belonged to the child of a wealthy family.\n\nGold was not mined locally, so the Nabataeans had to acquire it through trade.\n\nThe carved design in the ring is Roman, which shows it was brought in from outside of Petra.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou are a child living in Petra. How would like there have been similar to your life today? How would it have been different?\n\nArchitectural Panel of Melpomene\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see a woman carved in stone, holding a mask.\n\nPeople worshipping at the temple would have just left the busy markets along the Colonnaded Street. As they walked through the Temenos Gate, they may have lingered awhile to gaze at the elaborate stone carvings along the flat columns that supported the gate.\n\nThis stone panel from the Temenos Gate shows the Greek muse of tragedy, Melpomene. She holds a mask of Pan, a half-goat and half-human creature from Greek mythology. These carvings show that theater was an important part of life in Petra.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou were walking past these columns toward Qasr al-Bint. What other images do you think might have been carved into them?\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see the interior of the Church, including the columns and the aisles, from high above.\n\nIn A.D. 330, the Byzantine Empire made Christianity the official state religion. Over the next century, the people of Petra slowly abandoned their pagan gods for this new religion. In A.D. 500, the city built the Petra Church, a grand cathedral with massive columns, colorful mosaics, and an enclosed courtyard.\n\nPetra was no longer a trade capital. Instead, it was now a religious center known for its magnificent churches.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou were sitting in a brand new Church in Petra. How would it be different than a Nabataean temple?\n\nScrolls\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see tiny, fragile remains of a document made of papyrus.\n\nMost Nabataean writing was on papyrus or leather, which decay over time. In the late 500s, a large fire destroyed the Petra Church and many of its artifacts. But this same fire did something amazing: it actually preserved some of the precious scrolls stored inside.\n\nThese scrolls were partially burnt in the fire. Then, the ceiling collapsed and preserved what was left of them. When discovered, these scrolls were too fragile to be unrolled, so they had to be carefully cut and pieced back together. They give archaeologists a unique insight into Petra's history.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou could read these scrolls. What do you think they would say?\n\nWall Mosaic Tiles\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see the remains of a man's face made from pieces of colored tile.\n\nThe floors, walls, and ceiling of Petra Church glimmered with vivid mosaics. These striking images were made of stone, glass, and red clay tiles. The mosaics on the ceiling were adorned with precious gold-plated tiles.\n\nThis mosaic shows a male face, perhaps meant to be a saint or holy figure. Mosaics on the floor included an array of images, such as trees, vases, fruit, and people. Many showed animals like eagles, giraffes, and leopards. It is likely that still others featured holy figures, saints, and prominent people of the day.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou were an artist asked to create a mosaic of tiles for the Church. What would you create?\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see the front of this amazing carved monument, and a close-up of one of it's columns.\n\nEntering Petra through the Siq, visitors would have been awed by the sight of a majestic monument, which is as high as a 13-story building.\n\nKnown as the Treasury, this building was cut into the red cliffs and painted bright white with colorful accents. With its grand staircase, elaborate sculptures, and ornate columns, it resembles Greek architecture from the Egyptian city of Alexandria.\n\nHistorians believe the monument was carved for a Nabataean king, but they have found no inscriptions to identify which one. Another mystery is whether the structure was also a temple. Only time and more research will reveal the truth behind the magnificent structure.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou were asked to carve the front of this building. What would your design look like?\n\nSteps\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see the stone steps and doorways inside the Treasury.\n\nPalatial monuments like the Treasury were cut from Petra's cliffs by skilled master builders. With hammers, chisels, and other tools, these craftsmen carved elaborate stone buildings and huge sculptures.\n\nThe entranceways to a few tombs and temples have been found unfinished. These discoveries show that builders usually carved from the top down.\n\nThe Treasury's massive steps show the remarkable skill and size that was typical of these monuments. The scale of these buildings show that grand architecture was an important way to impress visitors or worship the gods.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou were walking through the Treasury. What would you see inside?\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see the remains of the stone walls, which divided the house into rooms.\n\nSince Petra was rediscovered in the 1800s, most of the attention has been on the city's spectacular tombs and temples. Recently, though, archaeologists have uncovered several houses built on this site.\n\nPieces of Nabataean pottery show that the earliest house in this area was built about A.D. 20. Later, another house was built from sandstone and limestone on top of the original structure. A few centuries later, two new houses were built on the ruins of this Nabataean home.\n\nBased on coins found at the site, archaeologists believe these two last houses probably were destroyed in the massive earthquake of A.D. 363.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou were living in a house like this one. What would your room have looked like?\n\nPottery\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see a clay bowl, decorated with dark red designs.\n\nAs the Nabataeans settled down and built houses, they also started to make pottery. Over the centuries, the shape and design of its pottery would also change. The pottery was made extremely thin, like porcelain, and very little of it survived.\n\nThis pottery was used by the wealthy. Archaeologists have found hundreds of pieces of undecorated, thicker pottery which were used for everyday cooking and serving.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou bought this plate on the Colonnaded Street. What would you have used it for?\n\nJewelry\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see a copper bracelet.\n\nThe Nabataeans valued masterfully crafted objects from around the ancient world such as precious jewelry and elaborately carved vases. They even decorated simple objects such as this hammered copper bracelet, one of a pair. Its silvered ends are shaped as a palm and a star.\n\nIn the absence of written accounts of everyday life, household objects and personal ornaments serve as our link to the people of Petra. Even the smallest of these items (handled, worn, and perhaps even loved two thousand years) can help us understand what life was like in the ancient city.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou were a wealthy person in Petra. What type of jewelry would you have bought?\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see the remains of a semi-circular theater, with stadium-style seats.\n\nLife in Petra wasn't all about work and worship. The Nabataeans went to the Theater for plays, music concerts, poetry readings, and even speeches.\n\nThis grand public space was carved into the rocks long before Rome took control, but it is a lot like a Roman theater. Shaped like a half-circle, the Theater included a large ornamental stone backdrop, elaborate sculptures and columns, and marble-covered seats for up to 8,500 spectators. Like Roman theaters, it would have had colorful awnings to protect the audience from the sun.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou were at the theater for a performance. What would you have seen?\n\nTragic Mask\n\nIn this picture...\n\nYou can see a mask carved from limestone.\n\nIt's likely that some of the plays performed at the Theater were by Greek and Roman authors. So it's not surprising that theatrical masks discovered in Petra show Greek and Roman figures.\n\nThis tragic mask suggests serious drama. Masks like this one were an important part of plays in Petra, because they helped identify the performance as a tragedy or comedy. The masks also helped identify different characters. The performers behind the masks could have been traveling actors from other regions or local entertainers.\n\nImagine...\n\nYou made a mask for a performance at the Theater. What would it look like?"
