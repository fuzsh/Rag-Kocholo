        "text": "TV & Showbiz\n\nStewart Lee, Joanne McNally, Jon Richardson and more fill out top-notch Laughterama 2024 lineup Danny Jones\n\nThe much-loved Laughterama comedy festival is coming back to Manchester next month and with a lineup as good as this, you’d be a total muppet worthy of heckling not to check it out.\n\nBoasting everyone from venerable veterans of the comedy industry and familiar TV faces to some of the most exciting new stand-ups on the circuit, Laughterama never fails to pack a punch and deliver you all the variety you could hope for.\n\nThe return of the five-day laugh-fest marks just the third edition of the event which has already attracted some huge names from all over the UK and across the global comedy scene too.\n\nRunning from 4-8 September over at the legendary outdoor Castlefield Bowl amphitheatre, which was packed out for several consecutive weekends for this year’s Sounds of the City, we’re looking forward to a boatload of belly laughs.\n\nJust like every year, Laughterama 2024 has some serious headliners rocking up this time around too, with legends like British Comedy Award winner Stewart Lee, 8 Out of 10 Cats team captain and stand-up master Jon Richardson; the Perrier Award-winning Dylan Moran and SO many more.\n\nWe’re talking cult favourite, BAFTA nominee and former Never Mind The Buzzcocks presenter Simon Amstell, Live at the Apollo and Taskmaster stars Phil Wang and Sam Campbell, long-serving Mock the Week host Dara Ó Briain, and the Irish queen of comedy and podcast supremo herself, Joanne McNally.\n\nBut if this lineup was a joke, we’re nowhere close to the punchline; we’ve barely scratched the surface when it comes to the funny faces set to take the Laughterama stage for 2024.\n\nLocal names include Manchester stand-up Josh Jones and Dan Tiernan, who’ll be battling to be the funniest Manc comics at this year’s festival, and there’s also a fair few international names making the trip over, such as adopted Brit Reginald D Hunter, Kemah Bob, Janine Harouni and tonnes more.\n\nYou can see the lineup in full down below.\n\nRead more:\n\nManchester Pride Festival 2024 – parade route, line-up, tickets and more\n\nFirst trailer released for new BBC comedy series Daddy Issues set in Stockport\n\nNeighbourhood announces second wave of 2024 lineup for city centre festival\n\nThe best part about the whole event, though, is that it operates like any other good festival does: by stocking up plenty of bars for laughter-fuelling libations, plus providing some of the best street vendors from around Greater Manchester’s ever-thriving foodie scene and more.\n\nWill Briggs, one of the organisers from 57 Festivals who helps bring Laughterama to life, said ahead of this year’s event: “We can’t wait to get back to Castlefield Bowl, the energy of our Manchester crowds is electric and our acts always feed off that.\n\n“Each show is totally unique and stacked with the absolute best comedians of the moment, this year is going to be another total blast.”\n\nTickets for Laughterama 2024 are live as we speak and selling out quicker than a one-liner, which is no surprise considering it’s just £25 for a day pass.

I am extremely upset to announce that mine and Tommy’s relationship has come to an end.\n\n“I will forever be grateful for the most important thing to me now and always, my beautiful daughter.
