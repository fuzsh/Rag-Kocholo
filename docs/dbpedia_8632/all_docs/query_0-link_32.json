A searchable, critical guide to theater is at nytimes.com/events.\n\nPreviews and Openings\n\n‘Aladdin’ (in previews; opens on March 20) The 1992 Disney film upon which this new musical is based is best remembered today for Robin Williams’s manic voice-over work and the Oscar-winning ballad “A Whole New World.” The song is still in there, of course, along with several new ones, but James Monroe Iglehart has taken over as the motormouthed Genie. There is one repeat participant within the cast, however: Jonathan Freeman will once again play the villainous grand vizier Jafar. Casey Nicholaw (“The Book of Mormon”) does double duty as director and choreographer. New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, 866-870-2717, aladdinthemusical.com. (Eric Grode)\n\n‘Appropriate’ (in previews; opens on March 16) The young African-American playwright Branden Jacobs-Jenkins landed on the New York scene with a splash in 2010 when the Public Theater produced his “Neighbors,” which featured a black family in blackface performing tropes familiar from minstrel shows. In some ways, the racial makeup of his new work is even more radical: He has written a play for an all-white cast. But as its characters return to their crumbling Arkansas plantation home after the patriarch’s death, the troubling mementos they find once again vault to the forefront. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Grode)\n\n‘The Architecture of Becoming’ (in previews; opens on Sunday) New York City Center, the Moorish Revival theater that once held the Shriners and is now a top destination for theater (Encores!) and dance (Alvin Ailey, Fall for Dance), serves as the background for this ambitious undertaking by the Women’s Project, one of the building’s more recent inhabitants. Five different playwrights — including Kara Lee Corthron and Lauren Yee — team up with three directors to interweave fictional characters into the building’s storied history. City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Grode)\n\n‘Beauty and the Beast’ (previews start on Thursday; opens on March 14) The British director Phelim McDermott — whose productions have included “Shockheaded Peter,” the Philip Glass opera “Satyagraha” and “The Addams Family” on Broadway — reimagines this classic fairy-tale romance as an adult blend of song, dance, puppetry and shadow play. His accomplices in the title roles are the multidisciplinary performance artists Julie Atlas Muz and Mat Fraser. Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, 212-352-3101, abronsartscenter.org. (David Rooney)\n\n‘Beyond Therapy’ (previews start on Tuesday; opens on March 25) Unseen in New York since the 1982 Broadway production that starred John Lithgow, Dianne Wiest and a young David Hyde Pierce, Christopher Durang’s satire on the search for meaningful relationships in the contemporary world was called his “Alice in Wonderland” by The New Yorker. It returns via the Actors Company Theater, staged by that troupe’s joint artistic director, Scott Alan Evans. Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
