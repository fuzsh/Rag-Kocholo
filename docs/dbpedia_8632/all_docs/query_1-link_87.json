Murray’s principal character is The Pub Landlord who puts Great Britain first in his values and will not settle for anything less. The joke is always on him and he has appeared as the character for over twenty years. I think The Pub Landlord is one of the greatest creations in modern comedy and I have laughed so much at his mighty comic performances over the years. Brilliant at audience interaction, I have seen him in many solo shows at the Edinburgh Fringe (including The Only Way is Epic in 2012, One Man, One Guvnor in 2014 and Landlord of Hope and Glory in 2019). Most recently in 2021 Murray compared the online weekly quiz Al Murray’s Lockdown Lock-in for Always Be Comedy Online.\n\nThanks so much for listening to my podcast, if you like what you hear, please subscribe and I hope you enjoy the interview.\n\nPlease read Al Murray’s blog at:\n\nhttps://arichcomiclife.blog/2020/08/18/al-murray/\n\nAl Murray’s Links:\n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/thepublandlord\n\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/almurray\n\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/thealmurray\n\nWebsite: www.thepublandlord.com"
