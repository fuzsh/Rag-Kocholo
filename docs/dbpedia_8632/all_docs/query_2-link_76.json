A talented musician with a captivating voice, popular songs have been re-written and given a perverse twist to tremendous comic effect. With a wickedly dry sense of humour, Andy’s darker material is sweetened by his innocent and impish demeanour which never fails to leave audiences in the palm of his hand.\n\nSince becoming a full-time comedian back in 2005. He has previously had the honour of working with Michael McIntyre, Lee Evans, Alan Carr, Jimmy Carr, Micky Flanagan, Harry Hill, Rhod Gilbert, Bill Bailey and Jack Dee, to name a few stand-up luminaries.\n\n“ALTHOUGH HE LOOKS MILD-MANNERED AND STUDIOUS, HE ACTUALLY PACKS A WRY, CHEEKY WIT.
