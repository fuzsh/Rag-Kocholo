        "text": "Look at the bump, my Lord, upon his head;\n\nPray feel its brother, on the other side;\n\nAnd say if, in the range of possibilities,\n\nThis poor man here could either rob or steal,\n\nAnd bear such striking marks of rigid virtue.\n\nBlackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine (1821)1\n\nThe above headpiece for the ‘Essays on Cranioscopy’, published in Blackwood’s in August 1821, is cited as the ‘Justiciary Records for the year 1996’ and projects the bump-reading rules of phrenology as the court evidence of the future. Combining this determinism with the ‘well-known fact’ of the malleability of the infant human skull, ‘Sir Toby Tickletoby, Bart.’ makes a ‘modest proposal’ to fashion mental caps that ‘by repressing the growth of the injurious, and encouraging the expansion of the good affections, would inevitably make all the future generations of Britons to think and act alike for the common welfare’.2 Further, once phrenologically identified, ‘[t]he grown up wicked people might be put to death without mercy, for the safety of the good’.3 Cool, scientific reasoning, bereft of humane feeling, becomes the source of ludicrous horror. This is the article that the Phrenological Journal and Miscellany particularly highlights when they declare Blackwood’s to be ‘the most persevering, and, of course, the most absurd of the assailants of phrenology, and enemies of phrenologists’.4\n\nThe Blackwoodian tale of terror – the genre for which the magazine is most renowned – emerged against a backdrop of medico-scientific progress that was laden with Gothic potential: the development of pathological anatomy, phrenology, and forensic medicine. As the ‘champion of the Invisible World’ in an age defined by ‘utilitarian philosophy and materialism’, Blackwood’s was suspicious of any reductive idiom that privileged progress or utility over aesthetic pleasure, scientific reason over humane feeling, and scepticism over belief.5 This does not imply that the magazine was ‘anti-science’, and the present chapter reads the tale of terror as an experimental, dually epistemic and aesthetic literary genre, which evinces a transauthorial attempt in Blackwood’s to counter the perceived ‘opposition between literature, aesthetics, and feeling, on the one hand; and science, utility, and reason, on the other’.6\n\nGianna Pomata defines an ‘epistemic genre’ as composed of ‘kinds of texts that develop in tandem with scientific practices’ and are thus ‘linked, in the eyes of their authors, to the practice of knowledge-making (however culturally defined)’.7 Scientific practices relevant to the tale of terror include the writing of case histories, the collection of first-person narratives of unusual subjective experiences, and the introspective and experimental methodologies of Scottish philosophers of mind. I suggest that the genre may be read as a form of hybrid ‘medico-popular’ writing to be classed alongside non-fiction medical texts such as Robert Macnish’s The Anatomy of Drunkenness (1827) and The Philosophy of Sleep (1830), as well as one of the most canonical ‘literary’ medical case histories, Thomas De Quincey’s Confessions of an English Opium-Eater (1822) – first serialised in the London Magazine in 1821, but originally intended for publication in Blackwood’s. The term ‘medico-popular’ is derived from D. M. Moir’s response to The Anatomy of Drunkenness, and the first section of this chapter introduces Macnish’s first medico-literary project in relation to De Quincey’s Confessions, before moving on to an examination of the development of the tale of terror in relation to the type of popular medical material previously published in monthly magazines and the case history tradition. The chapter closes by discussing the engagement with the genre by early medical contributors to Blackwood’s."
