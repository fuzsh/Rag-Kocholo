        "text": "I have to agree with you. I have never found him funny. I caught a bit of his \"gay Nazi\" skit before Pushing Daisies on Friday. Not funny at all.\n\nI'm a big Al Murray fan and watched the first episode of his sketch show (only caught bits of last fridays) and some parts did make me chuckle but I would have preffered if he would have just done another series of Happy Hour.\n\nIt's nice to see him do something different but I don't think the show is consistant enough with the characters.\n\nI did laugh at the two mobile phone salesman and the man who always manages to talk himself out of incriminating situations but the characters are just too hit and miss.\n\nBring back the Pub Landlord!\n\nI remember a similar reaction to Harry Enfield when he stopped doing Loadsamoney and Stavros. Give Al Murray a chance to come up with new characters rather than pounding the old ones to death.\n\nI remember a similar reaction to Harry Enfield when he stopped doing Loadsamoney and Stavros. Give Al Murray a chance to come up with new characters rather than pounding the old ones to death.\n\nThat would be Pub Landlord, not Al Murray himself who certainly isn't a loutish oaf.\n\nBut a camped up gay nazi?\n\nIt's not the 1970s anymore.\n\nAll that's missing is a catchphrase like \"I'm free\".\n\nIt appears as though mild homophobia in TV comedy is back and is all the rage again.\n\nI agree the Camp Nazi is utter crap. But there are good bits too. Any sketch show is going to be hit and miss."
