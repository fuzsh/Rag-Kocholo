        "text": "Humour is notoriously resistant to analysis, although that has not stopped a lot of people having a go. This attempt, by Schopenhauer, is one of the more striking illustrations of the problem: \"The cause of laughter in every case is simply the sudden perception of the incongruity between a concept and the real objects which have been thought through it in some relation.\"\n\nNot only incomprehensible, but, crucially, not funny either. Schopenhauer had a number of excuses for this. Not so Woody Allen: \"Jokes are like frogs. If you dissect them too much they may die.\" Even the great James Thurber failed: \"Humour is emotional chaos remembered in tranquillity.\"\n\nA tricky area, then, but one we today boldly enter in pursuit of a long-standing theory of mine - that certain parts of the country are more conducive to the production of comedy than others. The result is the Guardian's Comedy Map Of Great Britain And Ireland, detailing where our 250 funniest people were born and brought up.\n\nTake a look: the results resemble a good act, mixing as they do the familiar with the unpredictable. There are some findings that bear out popular prejudices and expectations, including mine: Liverpool, for example, being the nurturer of 14 people on the list, Glasgow providing 12, and London's huge population scoring heavily.\n\nBut I certainly hadn't expected Luton - which boasts John Hegley, Junior Simpson and David Renwick, writer of, among much else, One Foot In The Grave - to be a hotbed of hilarity and mother of all mirth. I knew Slough as the target and inspiration of such diverse comedy talents as John Betjeman (Highgate) and Ricky Gervais (Reading); but I didn't know it had given forth both Jimmy Carr and Sean Foley, one half of the Right Stuff and creator, with Hamish McColl, of the inspired The Play What I Wrote. And where is McColl from? Another comic butt: Cleethorpes.\n\nAs Linda Smith, of Erith and most of Radio 4, one of my principal consultants on the project, puts it: \"A lot of us seem to come from the edge of somewhere. Erith is either the edge of Greater London - which is a silly name, isn't it, because London gets lesser the further you go out, not greater? - or the edge of Kent. Mark Steel comes from Swanley, down the road from me - we have a kind of long-running argument about whose town is the most boring, and although I argue my corner, I've always known deep down he's right. Jeremy Hardy comes from Aldershot, and people from Aldershot might argue that it's a fine place in its own right, but it's still not Manhattan, is it?\"\n\nThere are many more examples of this particular kind of edginess, which we should perhaps term the Hancock Effect in tribute to the great man's fictional residence in the equally fictional and superbly suburban East Cheam. Other current reallife classic marginals include Gervais and Reading, Matt Lucas (Stanmore), David Walliams (Reigate), Al Murray (Stewkley), Chris Morris (deepest Cambridgeshire), Alan Davies (Loughton), Michael Frayn (Mill Hill) and Simon Nye (Burgess Hill), all acute purveyors of the angled observation that distance allows.\n\nFunnily enough, Simpson and Galton, Hancock's writers, are from inner-city London (Brixton and Paddington respectively) while The Lad himself was from Birmingham - as unlikely a Brummie as Frankie Howerd was a Yorkshireman (it's true: born in York). It is this kind of exception that has led Linda Smith to describe my theory of place and comic relativity as \"complete bollocks\", but I am not so convinced.\n\nBirmingham, as it happens, was one of the places I expected to do better; as things stand, it can only match Luton, with three natives, Jasper Carrott, Shahia Mirza and Julie Walters (unless you rope in Lenny Henry from neighbouring Dudley). Newcastle disappointed, too, especially when you consider two of its score of four were Ant and Dec. Another was Rowan Atkinson, a Frankie Howerdish kind of a Geordie if ever there was one, leaving Ian La Frenais as the sole and enduring exporter of why-ayeness. (Dick Clement - La Frenais' co-writer on The Likely Lads and Auf Wiedersehen, Pet - Westcliff on Sea, next to Southend, another comic butt.)\n\nOnly Glasgow seems to encourage the sort of low ribaldry mostly associated with Scots humour: the remainder of its comic produce represents the minor strand, archness with a sting - Graeme Garden, John Sessions, Ronnie Corbett - best evidenced by Chic Murray when offered a particularly small pot of honey in an Edinburgh teashop: \"I see you keep a bee.\"\n\nWales, represented in most non-Celt mindsonly by Max Boyce, does rather well, featuring the likes of Griff Rhys Jones (born in Cardiff), Terry Jones (Colwyn Bay), and Ian Hislop (Mumbles). No, please, after you.\n\nRhys Jones, though, was brought up in Midhurst, Harlow, and at public school; Terry Jones was brought up in Surrey, in Claygate; and Hislop, after that hwyl-packed start, moved around a lot with an expat engineer of a father while being educated in Sussex and before settling in Kent. He is not alone in his peripateticism: my favourites for range are Richard Curtis (Manila, Stockholm, Folkestone and Warrington) and Eddie Izzard (Aden, Belfast, Skewen and Bexhill), while top comedy combination goes to Jenny Eclair (Kuala Lumpur and Lytham St Annes). The problem of where to place them on the map was solved simply by handing out multiple credits.\n\nThis slightly arbitrary methodology is also reflected in the selection of the 250, which was done mostly by me. Even so, I have had to admit that the findings don't entirely bear out my guiding theory: that most of the funniest people in the country come from the north-west, and more specifically, the old, traditional Lancashire, the one that includes Liverpool and Manchester, the one that spawned the likes of George Formby, Will Hay, Frank Randle, Robb Wilton, Al Reid, Eric Morecambe and Les Dawson; the one, to shake hands with the living, that has continued to spawn the likes of Steve Coogan, Victoria Wood, Peter Kay, Johnny Vegas and Paul Abbott, creator of that masterpiece of fecklessness, Shameless, a daring piece of comedy risking sentimentality in a way that the more traditional Little Britain would never attempt.\n\nIn tandem and inextricably linked with this theory was my contention that funny people came from Lancashire and didn't come from Yorkshire. This is still true, in a way: they didn't, but they do now: The League Of Gentlemen has a lot to answer for, but there's also the likes of Daniel Kitson, the Perrier winner, Leigh Francis of Bo' Selecta fame, and Julian Barratt of the Mighty Boosh. I had also been conveniently ignoring the older Leeds writer types like Keith Waterhouse and Barry Cryer. Still, I am quite proud of myself for including the Chuckle Brothers.\n\nSo, a revision, but one confined to West Yorkshire, clearly catching on at last to the influences from over the Pennines. And one, too, that reveals a clear conqueror of London in comic concentration: an area bounded by Liverpool and Blackpool to the west and Leeds and Sheffield to the south contains the roots of more funny people than anywhere else in the country. An exciting discovery, and one that I shared with Graham Fellows, alter ego of the northern comic philosopher, John Shuttleworth. Fellows grew up in Sheffield and spent his twenties in Manchester, so was ideally placed to judge the new theory. \"It doesn't really interest me,\" he said. \"It's just an attempt at pigeonholing - very tempting, but pretty meaningless in my view.\"\n\nWell, that's always the way with groundbreaking theories. I pressed on. My next discovery was on the other side of England, where the lands between King's Lynn and Saffron Walden to the west and Cromer and Clacton in the east seemed not to have produced so much as a chuckle, apart from Delia Smith, who, as it happens, was born in Woking.\n\nBy a fine coincidence, at the heart of both areas lies a Bury: Bury, Lancs, and Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. A neat thing, but one that, nevertheless, Linda Smith thought was part of the same \"extreme manipulation\" of the data that had done less than complete justice to the south-east. This, though, was secondary in her view to the overall flaw in the theory: that it was a pointless generalisation based on the fallacy that every part of Britain has a particular level of humour. When I pointed to the East Anglian vacuum, she also went on to question whether I had weighted population density: \"After all, it is mostly sugar beet and Stephen Fry, who must be worth at least two.\"\n\nField work, then, was clearly required. Would one Bury be somehow a funnier place than the other, encouraging of repartee and rapierish shafts in the way that the other wasn't: something in the air, something in the essences of the places that made one home to a smile, the other to a sigh; one a place of lightness and fancy, the other an abode of the dull and the dour?\n\nAn ambulance was speeding down Manchester Road, Bury, siren wailing, watched by a small, stocky man of pensionable age wearing a flat cap. \"He's late for his brew,\" said Raymond Lomax, formerly of the Lancashire Fusiliers. No, not exactly Eric Morecambe and the one about never selling ice creams at that speed, but not bad, all the same, to a passing stranger on a wet Friday. I put my theory to Mr Lomax about Bury being the epicentre of British humour. The people pictured on the cover and at the foot of these pages were all photographed in Bury. Well, he said, Les Dawson had been from Bury, and Jimmy Kenyon. There was a funny man. If Kenyon had been able to sing, he would have been huge. But he couldn't close his act with a song, so that was that. Mr Lomax wasn't sure about Bury, though. Not particularly witty, Bury people, he said. But what about his crack about the ambulance? \"That wasn't a joke - that's true, is that. He is on his way to his brew,\" said Mr Lomax.\n\nHester Reeve was on her way to work. She is an artist, and she was appearing as an exhibit in the Bury Text Festival at the town's art gallery, writing out pages of Heidegger's Existence And Being, which would then be framed and put up on the wall in the gallery. Reeve was from Chelmsford and hadn't been in Bury long; she was renting in nearby Radcliffe, and thought there was definitely something about the place. \"My neighbours are really friendly, even though I'm usually carrying the skeleton I use for my drawing. There was a woman round last night asking if I wanted to come over for a glass of wine.\"\n\nHeidegger, wine. Did you know Les Dawson went to Paris to write before becoming a comic? Bury is rather more subtle than northern clichés might lead you to expect. My favourite joke involved the Whitehead Clock Tower, erected by a local worthy in memory of his brother, a surgeon. It bears the legend about time and tide waiting for no man, and has a Bacchic figure pouring wine high up outside the bell tower (which has never had a bell). To stress the speedy-passing-of-time theme, someone had climbed up and neatly hung a pair of trainers on the figure's arm. (Sadly, though, the Beau Brummel barber shop is not named in ironic tribute to the Georgian dandy, who famously resigned his commission rather than be posted to Manchester. Mr Steven, the proprietor, is a genuine admirer: \"He invented trousers, you know.\")\n\nNevertheless, I wasn't getting very far in my quest for the essence of the place, despite a happy chance encounter just outside the parish church with the Rector of Bury, the Rev John Findon, who had been in the area since 1977. \"I don't think you'd look to Bury for well-honed witticisms, but there's a directness that you don't perhaps get in other parts of the country, and a self-awareness. An old lady who had been talking to me for quite a long time the other day suddenly said, 'I know I go on, Rector, but it's all good stuff.' \"\n\nCloser, but still not quite there. I decided to make a pilgrimage to the Bury birthplaces of two of our finest women comic writers: Victoria Wood and Richmal Crompton, author of the Just William books. Crompton's house is on Manchester Road, beyond the finely named pub The Swan and Cemetery, worth a stop if only to admire the delicacy with which the sign painter has dealt with his subject matter. The old Crompton house is divided into three flats now. I knocked on the front door for some time before a first-floor window opened and a lady called Jean leaned out. I explained my mission. \"I wouldn't know about that,\" she said. \"I'm from near Halifax.\"\n\nWood's house is up on Tottington Road. Pamela answered. She thought Bury humour was to do with hard times, the laughing-rather-than-crying thing. Mind you, she said, there weren't the characters around today that there used to be. What did she do? \"I'm a nurse,\" she said, \"though you wouldn't think it to see me in my gardening clothes.\" Genuine Wood cadences. There was a pub near her house, too: The Pleasant View. Not The Terrific View, or The Fine View, just The Pleasant View. Dead Wood.\n\nBack down at what they delight in calling Bury's World Famous Market, Tony Mortimer, from Bolton, purveyor of pictures and that sort of thing, said he'd had a customer who told him she wanted a cheap mirror \"because it's only for looking in\", and another who'd come with a piece of elastic to show what size of picture she wanted. \"Do I always stand here?\" asked Tony. \"No, sometimes I stand over there.\" Actually, though, he thought they were funnier in Salford. And Blackpool, where he sings at the Queen's Hotel every Sunday afternoon. \"Oh, they're funny there, I can tell you. Me and the wife like going because we're the only ones with our own hips.\"\n\nOn Bolton Street, I noticed a sign saying Kay Lam Acupuncture Clinic. Such a conjunction of a famous local name and a rather more exotic remedy demanded investigation. It turned out that Lam was Kay's married name, and that she'd just started in Bury and it was going very well, treatments all very successful. Yes, she said, it might be something to do with them being happier in Bury. Did her husband help her? Oh, no, she said, he was an IT consultant.\n\nIt's fair to say, I think, that the audience for the Big Value Comedy Night at Bury Town Hall's Elizabethan Suite was select but appreciative. Dave Twentyman, from St Helens, \"half man, half drunken chip shop philosopher\", was indulged; John Scott, a Scots kind of comic, was as well received as Hils Barker, a Radio 4 kind of comic; Anvil Springsteen, from Liverpool, with a trademark Scouse patrol of several borderlines, was very funny.\n\nMike and Julie were watching. Mike was from Bury, and thought people in the north-west were funnier than people in East Anglia. Julie was from Norwich and agreed. The difference between industrial and agricultural, they thought. Andy was getting the drinks in. He was from Manchester, but had moved to Bury: \"I love Bury.\" I said I was a bit surprised that Barker's stuff had gone down so well, as it wasn't exactly Peter Kay. \"Bury's a very middle-class town ... About the first time I came here, I was in a club, and I overheard this lad, who had obviously pulled, saying to the girl, 'Have you got your helmet?' So she asked him what she would need a helmet for and he said it was for the bedhead. And I said to myself, 'I'm going to love living in this town!'\"\n\nAfterwards, I told Anvil Springsteen about East Anglia. \"Right. I had this car, an old Granada 2.8 litre, grand car, and there were six comics in it and we were on our way through East Anglia trying to find King's Lynn. And we got lost, we were in the middle of the countryside, and there was this old bloke, so we stopped to ask him the way. And do you know what he said? 'Oh, you'll be the comics.'\"\n\nIt was with some trepidation, then, that I arrived in Bury St Edmunds, having just received this message from Helen Lederer (Llandovery and Eltham): \"East Anglia? My hardest gig ever (no one laughed) was just outside Cambridge. Could it be due to large areas of flat land? Are they funny in Holland?\" Mind you, she added, some of her biggest fans came from Cornwall.\n\nWilliam Cobbett considered this Bury to be \"the nicest town in the world\". And it was very pleasant, too, on a spring Saturday, with the charming gardens on the site of the old abbey just beginning to burgeon, if in a very neat way. Bury is very keen on flowers and has won more prizes for them than you could shake a glad at. Do not, though, repeat the canard that the town has banned hanging baskets on safety grounds: an urban legend that cannot be taken as evidence of a lack of a sense of humour, even if there is something of a failure to see the funny side of it.\n\nThey were not glum, though. As many smiles here as in the north. The lack of local comic talent was not a matter of pressing concern. Nevertheless, I did press Sarah Friswell, a visitors' officer standing outside the cathedral, who turned out to have come to Bury from Hull, and thus be able totake a distanced view. She thought that Bury people were too amiable, too content with their lot to be comics: they lacked that famous and necessary edge. Mr Wakeley, proprietor of the Bury Bookshop, agreed. I asked if he had anything on East Anglian humour. He said there had been a small book, but it was out of print.\n\nEven so, I did manage to find Mardles From Suffolk, A Taste Of East Anglian Humour, by Ernest R Cooper. Mardle is East Anglian for a bit of a chat, a bit of gossip. And I rather liked the one about the two men in the balloon (which may give a clue to its age) coming down and shouting to an old Suffolk chap, \"Where are we?\" To which the old chap replies, \"You're in a balloon.\"\n\nI passed through the Saturday market, not noticeably more restrained and contemplative than the northern one, pausing to discover that the man on the flower stall with a voice, as he said, like Joe Pasquale's, had been a clown in Great Yarmouth. I was on my way to The Nutshell, the smallest pub in Britain, measuring seven and a half feet by 15 feet, a pretty good joke in itself. A sign on the wall read Coach Parties Welcome. The barman, whose name was Jack, told me that the record number to fit in the pub was 102. \"And a Jack Russell,\" said Tony, who was stood at the bar. I asked him why comics didn't seem to come from East Anglia. \"Poor road access,\" he said.\n\nA mummified cat was hanging above the bar. I wondered what its name was. \"Lucky,\" said Terry, who was sitting on a bench. Jack said he'd come to Bury from Portsmouth. I asked him what the main difference was. \"Not as many sailors,\" said Tony.\n\nGreat stuff, except that Terry came from Altrincham, and Tony was from Burnham Beeches. \"Look,\" said Tony, pointing through the window to a man sat on a bench across the street, \"that's Paul - he's from Bury. Great bloke, Paul. Bury born and bred. You should talk to him. Absolutely no sense of humour.\"\n\nNevertheless, the next evening, Bury Corn Exchange, a noble building, was packed for the monthly Fat Cat Comedy Club, \"East Anglia's biggest\". Mark and Martin, two of the four organisers, who are so enthusiastic about comedy that they do it for love not profit, said that they struggled a bit to come up with any local talent. In fact, for Red Nose Day, they had joined up with the local BBC radio station in a competition to find new young Suffolk comics and eventually had to settle for a semi-pro who was a regular at the holiday camps.\n\nNo, they didn't know why this should be, either. Steffan, back in Bury from his new home in Florida and sitting with a big group of friends, was clearer: Bury was too rural and reserved. Cobbett liked it, I said. \"Nice!\" said Steffan. \"Nice - that's all it is. You can go away for two years and come back and there's a new mini-roundabout and that's about it.\"\n\nStill, the show went down a storm. Again, as with the northern Bury, it didn't seem to matter what style of comedy was on offer: Mancunian from Des Sharples, student-surreal from Andy Zaltzman, Canadian dry from Angelo Tsarouchas: they laughed at it all. A puzzle, then, which I wondered if Sid Kipper might solve.\n\nSid Kipper? Linda Smith told me about him. East Anglia's finest. I caught up with him in Trunch Village Hall, not far from Cromer, not far from the sea; near enough, indeed, as Sid said, up on the stage, with guitar and in a suit of an interestingly electric shade, to make people object to having anything to do with the Revenue. Sid took the hall on a musical tour of the Norfolk coast, visiting, among other places, Great Yarmouth, \"so called because it gets on your nerves\", but not going across the county border, because that's where you would get suffolkated.\n\nSid sang songs featuring a mermaid called Belinda, 16 sailors and a piece of rope, and pointed out that, round here, there was no difference in pronunciation between heron and herring, which made life a little confusing. Sid had the droll, slow delivery of a kind no longer fashionable, and, as Linda had predicted, was very funny. Sid performs all over the country, mostly in the country. I spoke to him during the interval; he said he was trying to interest Radio 4 in a series in which he would act as a guide to all these urban incomers. I did wonder whether he was driven enough to put East Anglia on the comedy map, though. \"I don't want a lot of money,\" he said. \"So I'm doing quite well because I'm achieving my ambition.\" He then quoted Canadian humorist Stephen Leacock and further complicated matters by handing me a card showing that his alter ego, Chris Sugden, lives in Bradford, where he'd moved for love.\n\nI went to Thetford to ponder. Thetford is the birthplace of Tom Paine, legendary revolutionary, and also comic philosopher: \"The sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related that it is difficult to class them separately.\" An uncannily accurate description of the town's most famous temporary residents, the cast of Dad's Army, who used to film nearby and stayed at The Bell, where the great Arthur Lowe once fell asleep in his starter, woke up, lifted his head, paused for a beat, and said, \"Soup in this place has gone off.\"\n\nThe Bell is said to be serially haunted; I stayed there, too, hoping for some help from friendly Walmington-on-Sea spirits, but not much came, although I did discover that John Le Mesurier was born in Bury. East Anglia remained an enigma. Despite intense researches, I was no nearer to the secret of why funny people came from some places and didn't come from some others. I had even done a comparative traffic warden test, only to find that wardens in both Buries - thank you, Steve and Derek - found most people pleasant and had never been subjected to physical assault. April fools? The northern Bury paper had gone for a public garden dedicated to Camilla Parker Bowles, while the eastern Bury one had plumped for a giant Ferris wheel overshadowing the cathedral's new tower.\n\nCapitulation to the Smith-Fellows line seemed inevitable. A last hope: Stephen Fry, born in Hampstead, brought up in Norfolk, reputedly with a brain as big as both. And what a potential double act I had to suggest: Fry and Kipper! Sadly, Fry's agent said he was out of the country and incommunicado, filming in Germany. Germans: there's a theory about them, too, isn't there? My next project beckons. Meanwhile, someone has just mentioned that Mr Pastry was from Norwich.\n\nThe giggle list\n\nPaul Abbott Burnley, Will Adamsdale Hereford, raised Washington and London, Caroline Aherne London, raised
