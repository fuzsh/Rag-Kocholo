        "meta_description": "Charlie Hinton and Phil Ryerson are a pair of fathers who attempt to keep their summer camp running even though they are under heavy economic strain. To whip together a group of kids who have problems following orders and to help improve their financial situation, Hinton brings in his military trained father, even though he and his father have been on the outs. Soon the campers, and the fathers, are involved in a series of adventures that will make the camp solvent, and help mend broken relationships.",
