Internationally, Al has forged an enviable reputation with numerous sell-out runs in Melbourne, Sydney and Montreal and New Zealand.\n\nOn television, Alâ€™s credits include An Audience With Al Murray, The Pub Landlord (ITV 1) which attracted 6.3 million viewers and 37 episodes of his acclaimed pub based sit-com Time Gentlemen Please (Sky One/Paramount). In late 2010, Murray made a documentary on German culture for BBC4 Al Murray's German Adventure in which he sought to find a different side of the German nation than the one portrayed by his Pub Landlord character"
