        "text": "Bill Murray certainly used his position as one of the most beloved actors in film to kick off San Diego Comic-Con, with a bang, as he showed up to his panel for Rock the Kasbah in character and singing Deep Purple’s “Smoke on the Water.”\n\nWritten and produced by Murray’s long-time friend and collaborator Mitch Glazer and directed by Barry Levinson, Kasbah features Murray as a rock tour manager who finds himself stranded in Afghanistan (along with a tightly wound Bruce Willis) after his star act (Zooey Deschanel) ditches him.\n\nStrutting up to the stage through the audience, Murray began belting out the heavy rock standard much as he does in [the film’s trailer] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=102&v=4PKOefvGpNE).\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMoments later, Murray asked the audience to sing 30 seconds worth of a song, any song, of their own choosing, basking in the cacophony.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nHollywood\n\nHow Simpsons “Superfan” Kamala Harris Stunned Crowds at Comic-Con\n\nThe presumptive Democratic nominee delivered an iconic line from the Fox series with a resurfaced video appearance during the show’s panel.\n\nFashion\n\nThrough Bill Cunningham’s Lens, the Glitz and Drama of an Era-Defining Fashion Show\n\nAn exclusive early look at the photographer’s treasure trove, published together for the first time in The Battle of Versailles: The Fashion Showdown of 1973.\n\nPolitics\n\nDonald Trump Has Nothing Else\n\nWhen the ex-president is desperate, he gets stuck on the 2020 election—and racist taunts.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon Should End After Season Three\n\nHBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series had a mostly strong second season, but it’s time to start wrapping things up.\n\nPolitics\n\nDemocrats Are Having Fun?\n\nThey just had to listen to voters.\n\nPolitics\n\nTrump’s GOP Swings and Misses With Desperate Attacks on Kamala Harris\n\nRepublicans built a campaign around assailing Joe Biden. But now he’s out and Trumpworld can’t seem to figure out how to hit Harris besides warmed-over racist and sexist insults.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Real Reason Matt Damon Loves Working With Casey Affleck\n\n“You need to get every idea out,” says the star of The Instigators, in a joint interview with Affleck. “You get there a lot faster if you’re not worried about people’s feelings. So, in other words, we talk a lot of shit to each other.”\n\nPolitics\n\nTrump Was Totally Not Being Serious When He Suggested He’s Going to Appoint Himself President for Life: Republicans\n\nThis is a guy who loves democracy, after all.\n\nMovies\n\nIs a Britney Spears Biopic Officially in the Works?\n\nWicked producer and director duo Marc Platt and Jon M. Chu are reportedly attached to helm the film for Universal.\n\nPolitics\n\nCan Kamala Harris Make Joe Biden’s Campaign Her Own?\n\nThe vice president has inherited her boss’s sprawling 1,300-person campaign apparatus. Some insiders are worried that Harris needs stronger allies. “She basically has Biden’s team right now,” one says. “She needs some people in that room who are her people.”"
