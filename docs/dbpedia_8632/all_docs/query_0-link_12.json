        "text": "This design aims mainly in research is to generate story and series of visual development for the upcomming film \" Keyboard Warrior \" , a short animated film about a coward guy who hide himself behind the internet while attack other people with aggressive-provocative posting and ended getting caught by his victim. Research method used by the writer is data gathering through social media observation, case study, and literacy review.\n\nHumor is narrative when it creates and/or exploits incongruity and superiority relations between the participants (“agents”) of narrative texts: author, narrator, reader, spectator, character. Thus to explain narrative humor is to show how narrative enables its participants (“agents”) to produce humor. This essay analyzes some cardinal types of narrative humor: “metanarrative humor,” “comic narrative suspense,” and “comic narrative surprise.” Some analysts add “comic character” and “comic action logic” as forms of narrative humor. This is wrong, because narrative is not just story (actions, characters) but discourse (narration) about story, although it is true (and relevant) that narrators can back- or foreground themselves and their characters.The narrator’s degree of fore- or backgrounding (i.e., of perceptibility) may namely inﬂuence the type of humor perceived in narrative (e.g., narratorial sarcasm or irony, dramatic irony). Finally, the current essay points out that the notion of narrative perspective complicates deﬁnitions of comic narrative in terms of \"pleasure\" or “happy ending.” Part 2 (\"Narrative Humor (II): Exit Perspective\", published in 2012) contrasts the analysis of Part 1 with Zupančič's psychoanalytic approach (2008), Attardo’s GTVH (viz. 2001) and Ermida's (2008) “script-based” views on narrative humor."
