        "text": "These days, making the British laugh is a complicated business. Last Wednesday, at the Edinburgh festival, towards the back of the queue for the League Against Tedium, one of the most talked-up acts on the fringe, there stood three over-excited students. Two of them were a couple: a woman in a new raincoat and her boyfriend. As a drizzle chilled the cobbles, and the queue refused to move, he tried out a little joke of his own.\n\nJust behind them, he had noticed, was a sign for a sports hall. It was large and neatly printed, municipal black on white, still quite legible in the late-evening gloom. There were the usual instructions about leaving quietly after dark and which doors to use. Several lines apart, the words `rear' and `entry' appeared.\n\nThe boyfriend beamed: `Rear entry!' He jogged his partner's arm. `It's a sports hall!' She laughed, and repeated him in pure Home Counties vowels. The other student joined in; the three of them made a huddle, sniggering, gulping from their plastic pint glasses, nudging each other, toying with the words between smiles. They might have been reading Monty Python out loud. Except no one else was laughing. The rest of the queue was looking at the ground.\n\nAn hour later, they were roaring. The League Against Tedium was actually a lone thin man called Simon. He spoke in a high, electronically altered voice, and disappeared behind a white screen at frequent intervals. He did not tell jokes as such, but made statements like `comedy is dead' and `shoddy is the new good'.\n\nHe wore an extended top hat printed with an exclamation mark. For his opening gambit, he had an opera singer onstage to declaim: `Patrons of the arts, reconsider your moral objections.' For his closing moment, he projected on to the screen some Microsoft operating instructions. Afterwards, some of the audience went up to offer their congratulations.\n\nModern British comedy can appear as confusing as it is ubiquitous. Sometimes, it seems like the national culture at its zestiest: it sells our films abroad, makes our advertisements sly, sugars every new channel and evening's television. Our comics do the PR for charities.\n\nThey own production companies and mansions (Lenny Henry's one in Berkshire was reportedly worth pounds 1.5m in 1997). They become theatre directors, novelists, serious actors. They appear perfectly adapted to today's global entertainment economy: multi-talented, flexible, always networking.\n\nEven minor stages at Edinburgh were sponsored by the American Comedy Channel. Jokes, after all, are easy and cheap to record and recycle. Mr Bean and Notting Hill, the publicists say, will be just the beginning; British film and television, in the words of one BBC executive, are `very consciously turning our development towards comedy'.\n\nBut what kind? Contemporary comedy, notoriously, was hyped as `the new rock'n'roll' a few years ago; the comparison may now be apt in unflattering ways. Both forms have grown a little fragmented and self-conscious with their success.\n\nThere is a sense that most things have been done before, that the best options left are extreme or esoteric. At recent Edinburgh festivals, the comic fashion has swung wildly between surrealism, fake jingoism, old-fashioned sketches and minute cultural observation. This year, it seems, the trend is for all of these at once.\n\nThe shows include Alan Miller: Balinese Shadow Porn, Afflicktion (`Tasteless Films For Tasteful People'), a history of `murder-for-entertainment', and an hour about postmen in the Arctic. The less humour-based the concept the more like performance art, in fact the larger the audiences and the keener the awards panels.\n\nAlso like rock music, British comedy, at least in its Edinburgh version, suggests a rather limited Britain. The festival queues could have appeared in catalogues for middle-class casual wear: there were new fleeces and smart sweaters, French tans and southern accents, and barely a non-white face.\n\nThe comics, beneath their make-up and stage voices, were similar: young, university-educated English people, more men than women, mostly up from London, sharing their references with the tribe. One critic, who had been at the festival from the start, claimed he had counted how many working-class comedians were performing. `Two,' he said.\n\nThe fringe programme counts 264 comic acts. Underlying most, it quickly became obvious, was a set of rituals, a bit like an order of service. Jason Freeman, one of this year's `promising' youngsters, had learnt it well. First, he burst onstage in a lanky tangle (physical comedy can be sold to anyone). Next, he adopted the appropriate accent (regional, in his case Lancastrian, but overlaid with the essential street-cheeky London).\n\nThen he gave a wink of self-deprecation (`stay awake if you can spot the joke'). From there, he spiralled off into free-association: some of it cute (about dogs), some risky (`I do like kids getting hit'), and some bug-eyed (`you spasming whore!').\n\nThe ruder and more random it got, the louder everyone laughed, except for one middle-aged lady with big earrings, who looked at her feet when Freeman said `fisting'. Most of the jokes were not about people but things, the more obscure the better: Riboflavin, swimming-pool scum, mallow. It was the juxtapositions people seemed to like; there was a sheen of wonder in their eyes as Freeman produced his titbits.\n\nPerhaps the British like their comics to be instant archeologists, sifting the infinite, fast- forgotten clutter of modern life. Perhaps modern education and communications have produced a nation of trivia-hunters. Maybe the audience just wanted to hear the word `calipers'.\n\nLast week's other favourites were more traditional. Jokes about Germans, especially Nazis, while more cunning than they used to be (`Hitler was only giving orders...'), still got football-crowd roars. Jokes about animals were indulged, however long and bizarre, with sentimental fondness. Quips about Scotland slipped out, slightly more polite than usual. Jokes about penises arrived with the frequency of Heathrow jumbos.\n\nYet, during all these afternoons and evenings in hot narrow rooms, some subjects were missing. Politics was barely a whisper. To find some, you needed to peer into the smaller-printed listings. Jane Mackay, `Housewife And Marxist', was performing in a cellar, away down the hill from the main festival venues. Last Thursday night, there were 14 people there, much older than other comedy audiences. There were only chairs for a dozen more.\n\n`Do we have any Marxists in?', Mackay began. There were two, from Leamington Spa, and they chuckled on and off, without ever quite laughing, as the show juddered along for an hour. Mackay did not bother with fast pacing and face-pulling and all the other tricks of the modern comic's art.\n\nInstead, she stood quite still, her 42-year-old hips thrust out, and, in the manner of early 80s alternative comedy, made a speech about `Lord Blair of New Britain', and `bastards' with business degrees. Halfway through, noise from the next-door venue, where people were laughing properly, started to drown her out.\n\nThe other forgotten topic at Edinburgh was race. Bringing up Glaswegians, or Americans, or the French, was fine almost compulsory, in fact; but any mention of non-white Britain was fleeting and nervous. At one point during the League Against Tedium, a randomly generated insult, reading `I haven't washed for six years', was projected beneath equally random footage of an audience member. He happened to be black. A quick, terrified silence rushed over the audience.\n\nThere were not many minority comics to relax things. It was one thing, the assumption seemed to be, for all sorts of British people to watch Goodness Gracious Me on television; quite another for the festival crowds to pick out and pay to see similar material in a live performance. Edinburgh had Valentine Flyguy, a black London comic who has been on Channel 4 and Channel 5, playing to an L-shape of 50 seats.\n\nHe did a droll impression of a policeman, and a sly sketch about a blues singer from Wolverhampton, who pretended to be from Detroit. For the rest of his hour, though, Flyguy made jokes about black Americans. He got a pale Scottish lad to say `motherfucker!' in a Harlem accent. The audience young, drunk, all white whistled and fell about. Mockery of foreigners doesn't have to walk on eggshells.\n\nNobody in British comedy at the moment knows this better than Al Murray. For the last three years, his sweating, swearing impression of a bigoted pub landlord has been shortlisted, at Edinburgh, for the much-chased Perrier award for stand-up comedy.\n\nMany thousands of mild liberals have roared him through his routine: his elaborate hatred of the French, his horror at homosexuals, his gravelly condescension towards anyone female. Murray's act is finely calculated: you can laugh at him, you can laugh with him, or you can slip giddily between the two.\n\nThis year, in the queues for other Edinburgh comedians, his fans can be heard repeating, `Al Murray. Very polished. Very good.' One of the Perrier judges was keen to recommend him personally: `You've got to go to Al Murray. He's more interesting about Britain than anyone else here.' The judge started reciting some of Murray's lines by heart, with the hand movements.\n\nMurray, in fact, is not a pub thug in real life at all, but happily admits to being a history graduate from Oxford who likes French films. Like the ex-public schoolboys who recently made Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, the hugely profitable East End gangster film, his fascination with hard men could be thought rather old-fashioned. Blagging and machismo, of the Kray Twins variety, is almost a heritage industry. Last Wednesday evening, the Pleasance cabaret bar in Edinburgh was crammed with nostalgics.\n\nMost of them were men in their 20s, in button-down shirts, who sat behind barricades of beer glasses. They drank to every catchphrases, to every nod of Mural's big, bullet head, to his every hilarious rage and prejudice. `Any Welsh in?', asked Murray. Silence. `Oh, good. The room's clean.' A young Scottish man in accountant's clothes shouted `Yeah!'\n\nThen Murray spotted someone at the bar. `Are you Welsh?' he yelled.\n\nNo answer.\n\n`What's your name?'\n\n`Not saying,' said the man, in an English accent. There were boos. Murray waited and stared, his red forehead twitching, then switched to another victim.\n\nTen minutes later, Murray noticed the Englishman was taking notes. Murray meant to have that notebook. He stomped up to him, grabbed at it, caught one end of it. But the man held on. And Oxbridge comedians can only push the macho bit so far. After a quick grapple, the boos echoing and rising, Murray settled for the man's pen, and a few mocking barbs.\n\nNo one wants comedy to get too rough, after all. The British aren't like that. At least, that's what I thought until after the show. I was the Englishman; I've never been called a wander by so many people before."
