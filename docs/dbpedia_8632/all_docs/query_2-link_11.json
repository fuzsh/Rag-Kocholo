        "text": "The British comedian Al Murray is making a return visit to Dubai this week for a sold-out, three night run of new show, Barrel of Fun.\n\nMurray will deliver his unique style of British humour at Souk Madinat Jumeirah from Wednesday for Dh250 a ticket.\n\nLast in Dubai for performances in 2009, Murray said it was high time he returned. \"If anywhere needs a proper dose of British common sense, it's Dubai,\" he joked.\n\nFor anybody unfamiliar with Murray's work, in essence, it's stand-up comedy with a twist. He takes on the persona of a jovial, opinionated and proudly right-wing \"Pub Landlord\" who spouts his views on a range of topics: the global financial crisis, migration and the 2012 London Olympics among them.\n\nHowever, poking fun at politicians is arguably what Murray does best and the British nation has long loved him for it - bestowing repeat comedy accolades upon him from Oliver nominations to a Perrier Award.\n\nMurray's comic range is broad and his 2009 British television show, Al Murray's Multiple Personality Disorder, treated audiences to a host of new characters. He's also a bestselling author and if you want to acquaint yourself with his material ahead of the live show, the Pub Landlord's Book of British Common Sense is a must-read."
