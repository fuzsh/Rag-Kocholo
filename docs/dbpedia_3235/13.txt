In a sorrowful turn of events for Indian cricket, former player Dattajirao Krishnarao Gaekwad, fondly known as DK Gaekwad, passed away at the age of 95. Gaekwad, India's former oldest Test cricketer and captain, took his last breath in the early hours of Tuesday, February 13.

Gaekwad hailed from Baroda and led his team to victory in the Ranji Trophy during the 1957-58 season, marking a memorable debut as captain. Following the passing of Deepak Shodhan in 2016, Gaekwad held the title of India's oldest living cricketer until his demise, making the way for C.D. Gopinath who is currently the oldest Indian cricketer alive.

Gaekwad's journey in cricket commenced in 1952 when he made his debut for India, marking the onset of a nine-year international career. He donned the Indian jersey in 11 Test matches, scoring 350 runs at an average of 18.42, including a notable half-century.

The 95-year-old had a great impact in domestic cricket, where he represented Baroda in 110 first-class matches. With an impressive tally of 5,788 runs, Gaekwad scored 17 centuries and 23 fifties. Not confined to batting alone, Gaekwad's versatility extended to bowling leg-breaks, culminating in 25 wickets in first-class cricket.

Celebrating his 95th birthday on October 27, 2023, Gaekwad's enduring love for the sport remained unwavering. Post-retirement, he dedicated his expertise to nurturing budding talents within the Baroda Cricket Association, leaving an indelible mark on generations of cricketers. He was the last cricketer alive to have been part of the Indian team that toured the West Indies in 1953. Notably, his son Anshuman Gaekwad followed his illustrious footsteps, donning the Indian jersey in 55 matches across formats and earning the esteemed C.K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award from the BCCI in June 2018.
