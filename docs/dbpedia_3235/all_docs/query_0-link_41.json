Implicit in this was recognition of India’s rise with a greater role for Delhi in the new security structure of Asia and the world. “India must assume its rightful place in the world,’’ US President Barack Obama said, adding the US was willing to partner India’s cause as a global power. By promising to back India’s claim to a seat in a reformed UN Security Council, working at New Delhi’s entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime and other selective grouping, the US endorsed Delhi’s desire to take its place on the world’s “high table’’. What Bill Clinton began with his landmark visit to India in 2000 and George Bush promoted with the India-US nuclear pact and the lifting of crippling sanction by the NSG came full circle with President Obama promising to work for India’s entry into prestigious multi-lateral groups. Ironically, the NSG was formed at Washington’s behest after India’s 1974 nuclear tests. On Monday, the same US was backing India’s entry into the NSG. From cooperating in Afghanistan and Africa to balancing China in Asia to working together in the G-20 and signing agreements on security, agricul- Our Correspondent New Delhi: Addressing a joint session of Parliament on Monday, President Obama spoke of the unacceptability of terror camps in Pakistan and said India had “emerged”. President Obama, who spoke about the cooperation between India and US on tackling terror and their shared interest in the Afghan-Pak region, said, “We will continue to insist to ture, setting up a global centre for nuclear energy and cooperation on health, India and the US emerged as working partners in several sectors. “We had a detailed exchange on the situation in our extended region, including East Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and West Asia. We have a shared vision of security, stability and prosperity in Asia based on an open and inclusive regional architecture. We have agreed to broaden our strategic dialogue to cover other regions and issues, and initiate joint projects in Africa and Afghanistan,’’ Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said after his meeting with the US President . The US also lifted controls on export of high technology items to India, so Indian entities like Isro and DRDO could trade without problems. But, because US domestic law requires a special provision for lifting of sanctions on the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), it remained on the prohibited list. Pakistan's leaders that terrorist safe-havens within their borders are unacceptable, and that the terrorists behind the Mumbai attacks be brought to justice.” “We must also recognise that all of us have an interest in both an Afghanistan and a Pakistan that is stable and democratic – and none more so than India. In pursuit of regional security, we will continue to welcome dialogue between India and Sinha Pakistan, even as we recognise that disputes between the two countries can only be resolved by the people of two countries,” he added. About India’s growing importance as a global power, he said “India is not simply emerging; India has already emerged.” Obama said “..it is my firm belief that the relationship between the United States and India - bound by our shared interests and values - US backs India on UNSC seat New Delhi: Three days into his closely followed Indi a visit, Barack Obama on Monday articulated what New Delhi must have fervently hoped to hear. In his 35munite address to a joint session of Parliament, the US President said amid much applause and cathartic thumping of desks that he endorsed India’s case for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council (UNSC). Stressing that the US looked forward to reforming the UNSC to reflect current global realities, he said, “Indeed, the just and sustainable international order that America seeks includes a United Nations that is efficient, effective, credible and legitimate. That is why I can say today — in the years ahead, I look forward to a reformed UN Security Council that includes India as a permanent member.” However, his endorsement was seen by Washington-watchers in Delhi as a diplomatic gesture because reforming of the UNSC should be a long process. will be one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century. This is the partnership I have come here to build. This is the vision that our nations can realise together.” “It is no coincidence that India is my first stop on my visit to Asia, for in Asia and around the world, India is simply not emerging, India has emerged,” said Obama. He referred to India’s heritage, its contribution to knowledge, culture, with Our Correspondent Guwahati: At least 19 people were killed and several others injured in Assam by militants suspected of belonging to the anti-talks faction of the banned National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB). The massacre took place barely a week after the outfit warned the government against killing its cadres. Striking at seven places, the Bodo rebels gunned down 19 persons, mostly belonging to Hindi-speaking communities. The worst carnage was at Boimara (Sijusa) along the The US had been reticent until Monday in backing India’s candidature, while the other permanent members of the Security Council — Russia, France and Britain — were forthcoming. China, the fifth permanent member, remains non-committal. Obama’s support was accompanied by suggestions to India that it must take positions on issues, like human rights violations in Myanmar, and not “shy away.” “Now, let me suggest that with increased power comes increased Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border in Sonitpur district, where NDFB militants pulled out passengers from a bus and fired indiscriminately, killing eight and injuring 12. The militants also struck at Belsiri, Majbaligaon, Keherukhonda and Batasipur — all in Sonitpur — killing eight people, including a woman, and injuring at least four.

The UN exists to fulfill its founding ideals of preserving peace and security, promoting global cooperation and advancing human rights. “These are the responsibilities of all nations, but especially those that seek to lead in the 21st century. So, we look forward to working with India, and other nations that aspire to Security Council membership to ensure that the Security Council is effective; that resolutions are implemented,” he said. Pakistan cried foul over Obama’s endorsement of India’s UNSC bid, saying Washington should revisit its stance and “take a moral view” instead of basing itself on “any temporary expediency”. Pakistan foreign office spokesman Abdul Basit said, “Pakistan hopes that the United States, which contributed immensely to the founding of the UN system and, in particular, its Charter Principles, will take a moral view and not base itself on any temporary expediency or exigencies of power politics.” Obama pulls up Pakistan, says India has emerged CERN creates ‘mini’ Big Bang 25 scientists from Kolkata’s VECC & SINP share in the achievement Jhilam Karanjai Kolkata: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has successfully created a ‘mini’ Big Bang by smashing together heavy lead ions instead of light proton ions.

Senior army and police officials have launched a massive hunt for the culprits. Monday’s killings came close on the heels of an NDFB reminder that it would kill 20 people for every cadre eliminated by the security forces. Incidentally, a cadre was gunned down on Monday morning. A senior police official said Monday’s carnage was an act of “desperation” by the outfit as it had been pushed to the wall. A large number of its top leaders have been eliminated over the past one year."
