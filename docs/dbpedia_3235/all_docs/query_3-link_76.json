        "text": "Abstract\n\nBermudagrass (Cynodon sp.) is one of the most commonly used warm-season turfgrasses in the southern areas and transition zone of the United States. Due to the increasing demand for water resources and periodic drought, it is important to improve the drought resistance of bermudagrass for water savings and persistence under drought stress. This study was conducted to determine whether experimental bermudagrass genotypes have improved drought resistance compared with the standard cultivars Tifway and Riley’s Super Sport (Celebration®) at Stillwater, OK. The trials were designed as randomized complete blocks with four replications in Expt. I and three replications in Expt. II. In each experiment, genotypes were subjected to progressive acute drought conditions using polyethylene waterproof tarps to exclude precipitation over a period of at least 72 d. Bermudagrass entries were evaluated for turfgrass quality, leaf firing, normalized difference vegetation index, and live green cover at least once each week during the dry-down. Substantial drought response variations were found in this study, and all parameters were positively and highly correlated. A turf performance index (TPI) was assembled based on the number of times an entry ranked in the top statistical group across all testing parameters on each date. ‘DT-1’ (TifTuf®) and OSU1221 had the top TPI in both experiments. Most of bermudagrass experimental genotypes had equal or greater TPI than the standard Tifway, showing improved drought resistance through breeding effects. The identification of superior drought resistance experimental genotypes provided useful information to breeders on cultivar release.\n\nThere are more than 31 million acres of irrigated turfgrass, making it the largest irrigated crop in the United States (Milesi et al. 2005). Bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) is widely used on athletic fields, golf courses, lawns, and roadsides in the southern regions and the transition zone of the United States. Water scarcity is one of the major issues for turf management worldwide (Fuentealba et al. 2015). Selecting drought-resistance turfgrass species and cultivars is one of the primary strategies in water conservation to meet the needs of the growing human population (Carrow et al. 2002).\n\nSufficient soil moisture is required to sustain turfgrass growth and maintain both shoot density and acceptable turf quality (TQ; Taliaferro 2003). When the soil moisture in the root zone is not sufficient for the growth and development of turfgrass, several changes in physiological and biochemical processes take place (Youngner 1985). When drought stress occurs; grass leaves may wilt; undergo osmotic adjustment; and produce abscisic acid, heat shock proteins, or dehydrins (Huang 2008). When drought continues from several days to weeks, depending on the soil types, leaf firing (LF) may occur, and grass will eventually go dormant (Passioura 1996). Leaf firing refers to the browning of leaves due to the destruction of chromatophores in the leaf, which starts from the leaf tips and margins and gradually progress down to the leaf blade base (Carrow 1996).\n\nSeveral studies have evaluated the response of various bermudagrass cultivars under drought stress, and substantial variations were observed. A study conducted in San Antonio, TX, reported that ‘Premier’ bermudagrass showed the lowest TQ and most severe LF at the end of the 60-day drought period, whereas ‘Tex Turf’ bermudagrass had minimal leaf firing (Chalmers et al. 2008). Steinke et al. (2011) reported that the live green cover (LGC) of ‘Riley’s Super Sport’ (Celebration®) bermudagrass did not drop to 50% until 50 d under drought. Richardson et al. (2010) found that it took more than 60 d without water before ‘Tifway’ bermudagrass lost 50% LGC. Tifway was ranked in the top statistical group regarding the number of days that it took LGC to drop to 75%, 50%, and 25%. A greenhouse study conducted by Baldwin et al. (2006) found that after 4 weeks of different irrigation intervals, there were no statistical differences on TQ among the Celebration, ‘Arizona Common’, Tift No. 3, ‘TifSport’, ‘Aussie Green’, and SWI-1012 at 5- and 15-d watering intervals. However, ‘Arizona Common’ had lower TQ after 4 weeks of treatment at 10-day watering intervals.\n\nIncreased demands on water resources, as well as periodic and persistent drought, have been driving forces in developing drought-resistant turfgrass cultivars. In recent years, turfgrass breeding programs at Oklahoma State University (OSU) and the University of Georgia (UGA) have focused on improving bermudagrass drought resistance. This study was conducted as part of a project involving testing elite bermudagrass experimental genotypes developed by OSU and UGA in different locations throughout the United States. The objective of this study was to evaluate the drought response of bermudagrass under acute drought stress conditions at Stillwater, OK."
