        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- An investor group backed by Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Permira has made a non-binding offer to take French cybersecurity company Exclusive Networks SA private at a value of about €2.2 billion ($2.4 billion).\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden’s Putin-Zelenskiy Gaffe Deals Fresh Blow to Campaign\n\nTesla Delays Robotaxi Event in Blow to Musk’s Autonomy Drive\n\nStock Rotation Hits Megacaps on Bets Fed Will Cut: Markets Wrap\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat\n\nSaudi Prince’s Trillion-Dollar Makeover Faces Funding Cutbacks\n\nInvestors would get €24 a share under the terms of the deal being discussed, Exclusive Networks said in a statement Tuesday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report. Talks are ongoing and there’s no guarantee they’ll lead to a deal, the company said.\n\nThe private equity consortium has lined up financing to potentially buy out minority shareholders in Exclusive Networks, people familiar with the matter had said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private.\n\nCybersecurity assets are being snapped up this year as high-profile hacks push the industry into the spotlight. Permira also announced a deal in May for Israeli fraud protection firm BioCatch. CyberArk Software Ltd. agreed to buy Thoma Bravo-backed Venafi that month, and cloud security firm Wiz Inc. hit a $12 billion valuation in its latest funding round.\n\nExclusive Networks shares rose 8.3% to €23.60 at 9:08 a.m. in Paris trading. The stock had gained about 12% this year through Monday’s close. Permira is the company’s biggest shareholder, controlling more than half of the shares according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nTalks about a deal for Exclusive Networks are taking place in the aftermath of France’s election, which saw a coalition of left-wing parties win the most seats in the country’s National Assembly but fall short of an absolute majority. The outcome may create an additional hurdle to getting transactions done in France, with some investors possibly becoming nervous about striking deals in an uncertain political environment.\n\n(Updates with additional context throughout)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla\n\nUkraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs\n\nLooser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom\n\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk’s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving\n\nHe’s Starting an Olympics Rival Where the Athletes Are on Steroids\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
