        "text": "Coimbatarao Doraikannu \"C.D.\" Gopinath (born 1 March 1930, Madras ) is a former Indian Test cricketer.He graduated from the prestigious Madras Christian College.\n\n'Gopi' was a stylish right-handed batsman strong on the off side and a good outfielder.\n\nHe scored 50* and 42 on his Test debut against the English cricket team in 1951/2, batting at No.8 in both innings. He contributed a quick 35 in the final Test of that series when India recorded its first Test victory. He toured England in 1952 and completely failed with the bat. At home he played Tests against Pakistan in 1952/53 and Australia in 1959/60, and toured Pakistan in 1954/55. He was chosen in the team to West Indies in 1952/53 but turned down the invitation.\n\nGopinath captained Madras and South Zone in domestic cricket. In the 1970s, he served as a national selector under Vijay Merchant and later as the chairman and managed the 1979 tour to England. He averaged more than 50 in Ranji Trophy with a highest score of 234.\n\nNotes\n\nSome sources provide the expansion of his first initial as Chinglepet.\n\nReferences\n\nChristopher Martin-Jenkins, The Complete Who's Who of Test Cricketers\n\n^ Interview with Rajan Bala, Crickettalk magazine, 23 September 2000, pp 38â39\n\nExternal links"
