May be we should start a thread comparing Bhaskar Pillai, TES, and\n\n> Dalvi! The first one, IIRC, was also left out from the Test squads although he was a mainstay in the Delhi team.\n\n>\n\nThere is no comparison, IMHO :-) The only time we see these comparisons\n\nis here on rsc - maybe because there are more TN fans than Delhi fans\n\nhere (who would otherwise raise monster objections with very valid\n\nreasons against this sort of comparison :-)\n\nFirst of all, Dalvi etc should not be compared to the others - because\n\nit was a long time ago, and they were in different eras. Dalvi arrived\n\nin about 1969, and was around till the mid-to-late 70s. So he should\n\nreally be compared to other mid-to-late-70s contenders only. And we've\n\ndone this before (when Dalvi was compared to Ashok Mankad, for example,\n\nand it was found that both played in 70s and were contemporaries, and\n\nyet Dalvi averaged 35 over his Ranji career while Ashok Mankad averaged\n\njust over 70 in his Ranji career at the very same time). Other\n\ncomparions would be Brijesh Patel, or Parthasarthy Sharma etc - other\n\nmid 70s players.\n\nTES and Bhaskar Pillai are slightly better comparisons - but even\n\nthey arent quite right. Their careers overlapped by only a little\n\nbit. TES stretched from 1970 to about 1984 or so, and Bhaskar Pillai\n\narrived only about 2 years before TES left. Pillai then stayed till\n\nthe early 90s.\n\nStill, if you *do* want to compare them on performances... again, as\n\nI said, there is really no comparison :-) For when we look at their\n\nrespective fc records we get:\n\nTE Srinivasan 75 matches, 3487 runs, avg 34.18, high 149\n\nMichael Dalvi 95 innings, 3089 runs, avg 35.51, high 151\n\nKP Bhaskar 95 matches, 5443 runs, avg 52.84, high 222*\n\nAs you can see, there is a *big* difference there. TES, for example,\n\nscored a grand total of 5 centuries in 12 years of first-class\n\ncricket. Those are pretty poor number really - less than 1 century\n\nevery 2 years! Bhaskar Pillai OTOH scored 18 first-class centuries\n\nin a career lasting 11 seasons - almost 1.5 centuries *per* season.\n\nThe centuries/match is even more glaring - TES 1 ton every 15\n\nmatches, Bhaskar Pillai 1 ton every 5.3 matches!\n\nI know this view makes me unpopular, but I personally dont think there\n\nwere *that* many TN players who got particularly raw deals in the old\n\ndays. The TNCA was always a very powerful organization and got its\n\nplayers in quite easily - if you read the autobiographies of Erapalli\n\nPrasanna and Bhagwat Chandrashekhar, for example, you will these\n\nviews expressed very often. Both of them are convinced that it was\n\nbecause of the power of the TNCA (as compared to the weakness of the\n\nKSCA in those days) that Venkat got to play so much test cricket ahead\n\nof Prasanna, for example. I remember Chandra mentioning how Jaisimha\n\nwas captain of South Zone one year, for example. And the next year\n\nhow Prasanna and Chandra were the top 2 spinners in South Zone, and\n\nwere the top contenders for test cricket - that Venkat might not even\n\nmake the South Zone XI (which would have put him out of test match\n\ncontention completely to start that year). And before the Duleep Trophy\n\nwas played, the team was announced - and suddenly Venkat was South\n\nZone captain :-) That is, he had been elevated all the way to SZ\n\ncaptaincy, which obviously assured his spot in the team - and the former\n\ncaptain now had to play under him. And both Prasanna and Chandra were\n\nthus promptly relegated to 2nd and 3rd spinner. Both Chandra and Pras\n\nwere of the view that this would never have happened the other way\n\naround - that is, Prasanna would never have been named captain *ahead*\n\nof Venkat, thus eliminating Venkat from contention etc, because of\n\nthe strength of the TNCA in South Zone cricket.\n\nIn those days particularly, TN was always the most powerful \"lobby\"\n\nin the South IMHO - and KSCA etc were quite weak. The KSCA only got\n\npowerful in the early 90s with GRV's arrival (and there are at least\n\na few people who will tell you that GRV ill-treated TN players after\n\nhis arrival too - for example, Srikkant was dropped from captaincy and\n\nteam immediately on GRV's entrance into the selection committee, and\n\nSrikkant never played for India at all while GRV was a selector. When\n\nGRV was removed from selector, Srikkant promptly make a comeback to\n\nthe national side in Australia in 1992, and for the World Cup. And when\n\nGRV returned the next season as selector, Srikkant promptly vanished\n\nfrom the side again, this time for good :-)\n\nIf youre looking for good bats who were ill-treated, again there are\n\nseveral whose names are probably a lot more deserving than TES or\n\nDalvi, IMHO at least. KP Bhaskar listed above, with a fine record.\n\nAnother Delhi-ite would be Ajay Sharma, who has a mind-bogglingly\n\nbrilliant domestic record, and yet he was only ever given 1 test match\n\n(in which he didnt do *that* poorly either - scoring 30 and 23, no worse\n\nthan TES did. And while TES averaged 35 in the Ranjis in his career,\n\nAjay Sharma averaged well over 75!)\n\nMaharashtra would throw up Milind Gunjal, Shantanu Sugwekar and\n\nSurendra Bhave. Gunjal played in the 80s (with some overlap with\n\nTES IIRC) - and he averaged 51 for his career. Bhave played late 80s\n\nand early 90s, was an opener, and averaged over 65 for his first 7-8\n\nRanji seasons IIRC without ever getting a break (heck, Bhave once\n\nhad a score of 280 against South Zone in the Duleep Trophy, against\n\n2/3 test bowlers - and still couldnt get a break :-) Sugwekar in his\n\nfirst 4-5 seasons was averaging over 70 as well. And then there was\n\nSrikant Kalyani - who played several good seasons, and then moved to\n\nBengal and played several more good seasons.\n\nEven Hyderabad would throw up names like Abdul Azeem - a contemporary\n\nof Srikkant's who opened in the same zone, and yet consistently had\n\na superior domestic record IIRC without getting a break (partly because\n\nhe was supposed to be too much of a hitter, which is amusing when you\n\nthink Srikkant was picked over him :-) Azeem opened and averaged 44\n\nin the South Zone for his career - some Hyderabadis will still tell you\n\nthat he was \"more talented than Azhar\" but was never given a chance etc.\n\nOr, in the middle-order, Dr MV Sridhar - a very consistent scorer in\n\nthe early 90s.\n\nHeck, even Bombay can throw up Lalchand Rajput in the 80s :-) An\n\nopener who was given only 2 tests in SL as a 23-year-old, in which\n\nhe made 32, 61, 0 and 12 - and was never picked again. (These 2 tests\n\nwerent particularly high-scoring either - India's other opener and #3 in\n\nthese 2 tests had scores of 2, 3, 64, 25 and 9, 16, 0, 25 respectively,\n\nfor example). Rajput was an incredibly consistent scorer at domestic\n\nlevel after that, without ever getting another chance - and not only\n\ndid he score at the Ranjis, he is actually has one of India's all-time\n\nbest records in the zonal Duleep Trophy! He was 2nd alltime in Duleep\n\nTrophy runs, and averaged 73 in the Duleeps for his career! He actually\n\nhad 2 Duleep *double centuries* after being dropped - 221 against North\n\nZone that same year, 2 centuries in the same match against South Zone\n\nthe next year (109 and 105), and 275 against Central Zone the year\n\nafter that.

In the early days of Indian cricket it was purely a city\n\ngame, and that is how it first developed - and Madras was probably\n\n2nd only to Bombay in terms of importance of cricket. Which meant that\n\neveryone south of the deccan came to Madras to play. If that had not\n\nhappened, maybe cricket would never have taken off in India at all!\n\nCertainly in South India - after all, how long could Bombay alone\n\ndo it, with people able to come travel to it and play mostly from\n\nWestern India only?\n\nIn that sense, a few cities were critical. Bombay was most, of course -\n\neverything sort of started there, the Quadrangular's and then the\n\nPentangular's were the life-blood of Indian cricket without which\n\nthere would have been no interest created in the first place, and\n\nwithout which IMHO cricket would have died in India at several different\n\nmoments. But even in the worst moments, when there were no foreign\n\ntours etc, the Bombay Quadrangulars kept a very high level of interest\n\nin cricket thru the country - people used to wait days for the newspaper\n\nto hear news of what happened, and players would come from all over.\n\n(There are still stories of grand celebrations in Punjab in the 1920s -\n\nwhen news reached by newspaper 3 days later that the Europeans had\n\nbeen beaten in the Bombay Quadrangular :-) Europeans vs Parsis vs Hindus\n\nvs Muslims - *everyone* was interested in it, with a great passion. It\n\ndrew so much interest that players would play across the country at\n\ntimes, and lots of games would be played thru the season, all\n\n\"practicing\" for the grand contest of the season, the Quadrangulars.\n\nSo Bombay was the main city for that reason. But there were others.\n\nLahore and Karachi were important centres too - lots of players came\n\nfrom there (Punjab had a decent team, and its core was Lahore and\n\nKarachi. And there were players from every community of course - Lahore's\n\nbiggest hero pre-1947 was Lala Amarnath after all). Calcutta was a\n\nvery important centre out east. And Madras was the only really\n\nimportant city down South - I'd rate Madras maybe 2nd or 3rd most\n\nimportant centre overall (after Bombay, and maybe Lahore). They held\n\ntheir own version of the Quadrangulars - the Madras Presidency matches -\n\nand these were 2nd in importance only to the Quadrangulars as a tournament\n\n(they even had players like Lala Amarnath travelling there to play\n\netc). All the other places - Delhi, Bangalore, Chandigarh etc were\n\nreally not even on the horizon, they played little quality cricket\n\nthere, and they produced no cricketers whatsoever in the early days.\n\nThus TN played a vital role in early Indian cricket - and that is a\n\ncontribution that is more important than anything else, in some ways.\n\nBut even after that it continued of course - in the early days of\n\nIndian cricket, thru till the 1970s (a *very* long time), TN was\n\neasily the major power down south. Why do you think the TNCA was so\n\npowerful anyway? :-) Because of history - they always had the best\n\ncricket, produced the best cricketers, were clearly #1 down south.\n\nHyderabad battled them a bit, but that was it - no other real\n\ncontenders. Karnataka really wasnt on the same level as TN or\n\nHyderabad IMHO, not in terms of cricketing importance (the team\n\nplayed the Ranjis as \"Mysore\" anyway).\n\nThus TN also had a fair number of players contributed to the Indian\n\nteam in the old days - when there were very few tours and tests played\n\nby India. Cota Ramaswami played in the first ever test that India\n\nplayed after all, and C Rangachari was a fast bowler for India in the\n\nearly-ish days too (he was probably in India's 2nd line of pacemen then\n\nhowever, with Nissar and Amar Singh being the first line. But he was\n\nstill a major name in those days).\n\nPrior to Rangachari was MJ Gopalan - a quite towering figure. He\n\nplayed only 1 test for India, but that is unimportant - he was a major\n\nfigure and an amazing sportsman (played both cricket and hockey for\n\nIndia. In 1936 he was on both national teams! He was picked for the\n\nOlympics - but refused to go, and instead went with the Indian cricket\n\nteam to England! In those days being on the Indian hockey team meant\n\nyou were one of the best 20 players in the world, really :-) He thus missed\n\nthe 1936 Olympics, where India won the gold easily and his team-mates\n\nlike Dhyan Chand became national heroes. And instead he went to England\n\nwith the cricket team, and couldnt even play - because Nissar, Amar\n\nSingh and Jahangir Khan were the first 3 pacemen, and he was #4 in\n\nline! Gopalan later mentored Rangachari, who also went on to bowl\n\nfast for India.\n\nThese early contributions to Indian cricket continued with great\n\nregularity. CD Gopinath played for India in the 1950s, as did Kripal\n\nSingh and Milkha Singh (both sons of AG Ram Singh). And then in the 60s\n\nVV Kumar and Venkat arrived - Venkat became TN's first Indian captain.\n\nFollowed by Bharat Reddy, then Srikkant in the 80s, Laxman Siva,\n\nRaman, Ramesh etc. As you can see, the contribution of TN has been\n\nsteady and ever-present - they have always consistently thrown up players\n\ninto national contention and thence to the national side.\n\nFor all that, though, most TN fans would agree that their contribution\n\nhas been a little disappointing. They were the undisputed #1 team\n\ndown South to start with - but Hyderabad caught up soon after, and\n\nalso kept throwing up players with fair regularity. Starting early\n\nwith Aibara - in those days they were not a match with TN. But then\n\nthey produced Ghulam Ahmed - a vital figure in the 50s. And then\n\nthey really broke thru in the 60s and 70s - Pataudi, Jaisimha,\n\nAbbas Ali Baig, Abid Ali, even Asif Iqbal (though he was a counter-\n\ncontributor to Indian cricket, I suppose :-) And then Hyderabad kept it\n\nup in the 80s and 90s - Shivlal Yadav, Raju, Azhar (yet another\n\nnational captain), and finally VVS Laxman (and, a few years from now,\n\nRayudu :-) In terms of history TN's contribution is more and longer -\n\nbut Hyderabad has caught up in the past few decades and has produced\n\nplayers of arguably greater national impact.\n\nIn terms of overall contribution, Karnataka's (Mysore's) is much\n\nmore uneven. In the early days they had almost no contribution\n\nwhatsoever - Bangalore was not a major cricketing centre, and Mysore\n\nreally produced no national contender players. TN and Hyderabad were\n\nboth streets ahead. Mysore had the odd good player - Benjamin Frank in\n\nthe early 50s, maybe. But there was nobody who was national contender\n\nlevel. Kasturirangan was another, but it was mostly slim pickings. Thru\n\nthe 30s, the 40s, the 50s, TN and Hyderabad continously produced a few\n\nplayers who became contenders at the national level and played for\n\nIndia - but thru all these decades Mysore had almost no contribution\n\nwhatsoever. It was actually a quite weak team.\n\nFor Mysore it changed only in the very late 50s, really the 60s. And\n\nsince then it has been a flood, and a huge impact. First Budhi Kunderan\n\narrived. And then Prasanna, then Chandra. Then Vishy - followed by\n\nBrijesh Patel and Sudhakar Rao. And the flood continued thru the\n\n90s - Dravid, Srinath, Kumble, Prasad, Joshi etc. Thus Mysore's\n\ncontribution has been far shorter than Hyderabad's and much much\n\nshorter than TN's - but it has been a much more concentrated effort.\n\nIn a relatively short period of time Mysore has produced players of\n\nfar greater national impact than anyone else.\n\n> >that GRV ill-treated TN players after\n\n> >his arrival too - for example, Srikkant was dropped from captaincy and\n\n> >team immediately on GRV's entrance into the selection committee, and\n\n> >Srikkant never played for India at all while GRV was a selector.

But of course there are always 5 selectors\n\nin any committee - and the South Zone representative when Srikkant\n\nwas removed was GR Vishwanath. Of course the selectors work as a\n\nteam, or supposedly do anyway - but the fact is that everyone has\n\nonly 1 vote, and in general a player makes it (or doesnt make it)\n\nbecause of the selector from his own zone. (Thus when Madan Lal was\n\nnational selector Harbhajan was left out of a test team in favour\n\nof Nikhil Chopra, for instance :-) I have heard it suggested at least\n\na few times that GRV did not \"fight hard enough\" as SZ representative\n\nfor Srikkant to be retained as captain after India drew the test series\n\nin Pakistan - that if the representative had been from TN, he would\n\nhave fought harder and Srikkant would not have lost his spot. Of course\n\nthere is no way of really knowing that for sure, one way or the other.\n\nI know I personally felt shocked when Srikkant was removed from captaincy,\n\nafter managing to draw a series in Pakistan with a much-reduced team\n\n(even if he had been awful with the bat himself).\n\nHowever, Vishy first became selector that year - and immediately after\n\nhe became selector, Srikkant was dropped from captaincy and left out\n\nof the team at the same time. (89/90). Dungarpur was Chairman (and\n\nCentral Zone representative).\n\nThe next year Vishy stayed selector, and Srikkant stayed out of the\n\nside. Dungarpur was no longer selector, his term was over - he was\n\nreplaced by Shukla, and Tamhane was COS (90/91). (I remember this\n\na bit- there was this huge and hard-hitting Srikkant innings\n\nin the Buchi Babu, and there was talk in TN circles that Srikkant\n\nshould be picked again. However they asked Vishy about this and his\n\ncomment reported by some of the papers was something to the effect of\n\n\"it is only Buchi Babu, first-class games are what matter\" or something\n\nlike that. I know some of us werent happy with this, because we all\n\nfelt very sorry for Srikkant for being wrongly kicked out in our minds\n\nto start with :-).\n\nThe next year was a big move down south, due to some outrage in\n\nquite powerful TN circles. Vishy was removed from the selection\n\ncommittee, and replaced by Venkat. Vishy was actually very bitter\n\nabout this. He actually commented in the Wisden Cricket Monthly\n\nafter being removed that regionalism was a big problem in selections\n\nand in Indian cricket in general - and said that, in his opinion,\n\nthe national selection committee should be a 3-man team, with no\n\nregional affiliations whatsoever. He suggested the names of Gavaskar,\n\nWadekar and Pataudi to fill the 3 spots saying \"so what if 2 of them\n\nare from Bombay?\" :-) (This can be found in WCM magazines in about\n\nearly 1992 IIRC - about when India was touring Australia. IIRC R Mohan\n\nmight have been reporting for WCM from India in those days).\n\nWhen Vishy was removed, he was replaced by Venkat - 91/92. The first\n\nteam picked after that was ODIs at home against RSA, and Srikkant\n\nwas back (to most of us being completely delighted) and did well enough.\n\nHe was then picked for the test tour of Australia, followed by the World\n\nCup team, where he did quite horribly both times IMHO.\n\nAfter the season ended, Venkat was removed as SZ representative in a\n\ncounter-coup, and Vishy installed again! Venkat was very bitter this\n\ntime, and said that he would never be selector again - he said he would\n\nbecome a full-time umpire instead (and he proceeded to do that, becoming\n\nfor a few years one of the best umpires in the world, before deteriorating\n\nabout 2/3 years ago IMHO). What added to Venkat's bitterness was that\n\nthe Chairmanship was rotating to the South Zone - so he would have been\n\nChairman of Selectors, if he hadnt been deposed at the last minute.\n\nIn 1992/93 Vishy returned to the selection committee, as Chairman of\n\nSelectors (and SZ rep, of course). Srikkant was left out of the team\n\nto tour RSA of course, and retired soon after. Vishy stayed COS from\n\n1992/93 thru 1995/96.\n\nThat is the chronology of events. Note, BTW, that I dont actually buy\n\nthe \"Vishy hated TN players and so left out Srikkant\" bit - never really\n\ndid. Only mention it because I *have* heard that theory - and later it\n\nwas pointed out that Srikkant had never ever played for India when\n\nVishy was a selector, which proved to be accurate when I went back\n\nand checked. I know that in 1989-90 I myself totally blamed Raj Singh\n\nDungarpur for Srikkant's dropping and Azhar's elevation - mostly due\n\nto a player-power thing, as much as bad form with the bat. Vishy only\n\nacquiesed as SZ selector, when maybe he shouldnt have (at least in my\n\nmind in those days).\n\nAnd when Srikkant came back to the side (with Venkat selector), I personally\n\ntotally agreed with it and was delighted - I thought he had been wronged\n\nto start with, and was thrilled he was back. However I was wrong obviously,\n\nbecause I thought he looked godawful in Australia, looked like he was\n\npast it to me (even though he did play a couple of nice ODI innings).\n\nAnd when Vishy was back as COS before the RSA tour and he dropped\n\nSrikkant, I thought it was quite justified - we had found Jadeja in the\n\nWorld Cup who looked a pretty decent opening prospect (more at that time\n\nthan later, IMHO), plus Shastri was around. And then we went with Raman\n\nas the other opener due to Duleep and Ranji scores, and I didnt disagree\n\nthat Raman was ahead of Srikkant now (though I personally still wanted\n\nSidhu back and was annoyed that they kept ignoring him, IIRC :-)\n\nSadiq [ enough rambling. sheesh ] Yusuf\n\n>\n\n> rk-\n\nAmbrish Sundaram <asun...@twmi.rr.com> wrote in message news:<3E219EE7...@twmi.rr.com>...\n\n> > Still, if you *do* want to compare them on performances... again, as\n\n> > I said, there is really no comparison :-) For when we look at their\n\n> > respective fc records we get:\n\n> >\n\n> > TE Srinivasan 75 matches, 3487 runs, avg 34.18, high 149\n\n> > Michael Dalvi 95 innings, 3089 runs, avg 35.51, high 151\n\n> > KP Bhaskar 95 matches, 5443 runs, avg 52.84, high 222*\n\n>\n\n> These are some of the players players that, imho, got a bad deal from\n\n> the national selectors.\n\nBelow you say this (have extracted above here, to amplify a response).\n\nI happen to disagree with it :-)\n\nIMHO all these were solid players - good solid domestic performers. But\n\none can be a honest Ranji performer without neccesarily being treated\n\nharshly in not getting an international selection. It depends on\n\nwhat is needed, who the other contenders are, how one is doing in\n\nrelation to other contenders. And, of course, it depends on whether\n\none has a big season or two to stand out, and whether one performs\n\nin the next level (Duleeps, Iranis etc) where the competition might\n\nconceivably be higher. I think this is even more true of the older\n\ndays than today - nowadays I sometimes think of Duleeps as being\n\na relatively ordinary tournament without much team-orientation to it\n\nand played on some crappy tracks (since we often play them in remote\n\nareas rather than at test centres). But especially in the old days\n\nthese tournaments were often not devalued - the test players played,\n\nthey played at test centres in front of big crowds, and they could\n\nsometimes be a pretty good test. Also things were better organized\n\nin general - one moved from Ranji to Duleep to tests etc (rather than\n\nthe much more haphazard route we sometimes have nowadays). Anyway.\n\n>\n\n> Some good points raised, Sadiq. Here's another guy whose first class\n\n> career started in the early 80s and extended into the early 90s.\n\n>\n\n> Carlton Saldanha -\n\n>\n\n> 66 matches\n\n> 104 innings\n\n> 15 Not Outs\n\n> 4066 runs\n\n> 144 highest score\n\n> 45.68 Average\n\n> 7 100s\n\n> 26 Half-centuries\n\n>\n\n> Pretty good numbers, don't you think ?\n\n>\n\nPretty good numbers, yes. The Ranji numbers are actually slightly\n\nhigher than this too - 86 inns, 3471 runs, avg 47.54. This is from\n\n1993, when Carlton Saldhana had retired only about a year or so\n\npreviously IIRC.\n\nBut again, he was contending with some other good openers too - and\n\nIMHO he did not deserve to be picked ahead of some of them. Not on\n\nthe basis of his domestic performances.\n\nTake, for example, Lalchand Rajput. Looking at only Ranjis in 1993,\n\nRajput had 103 inns, 4649 runs, avg 51.65.\n\nAnd remember, the above is only Ranjis - which is only one level. At\n\nthe next level, the Duleeps, Saldhana had only 1 Duleep century in\n\nhis career, 102 against West Zone in 86/87. Rajput, OTOH, had *five*\n\nDuleep centuries! Rajput had 221 against North Zone in 85/86, the\n\nprevious year (which would obviously make him a stronger candidate\n\nto start with). In 86/87, in the match where Saldhana scored 102,\n\nRajput in that same match had 109 and 105 for the opposition! And\n\nthe next year (87/88) Rajput put up a monumental 275 against Central.\n\nOverall Rajput averaged 74 in the Duleep Trophy over his career\n\nwith almost 1500 Duleep Trophy runs - and he got only 2 test matches\n\nfor it, both when he was 23 years old (with 1 fifty, both tests played\n\nbefore those huge seasons in the Duleeps listed above). Remember,\n\nthis is in 1993 - that is, a similar-time-frame comparison with\n\nCarlton Saldhana (though Rajput has 1000 more runs). I dont know what\n\nRajput's Ranji record is *today* - it has probably deteriorated a\n\nlittle bit, because Rajput was still playing Ranji Trophy cricket\n\nat age 40, captaining and managing a young Vidarbha team only 1 year\n\nago!\n\nThen there was Raman Lamba, for instance - yet another opener who was\n\na contemporary of Carlton Saldhana, who also had a superior record.\n\nLamba had 86 innings (exactly the same as Carlton), 4205 runs (800\n\nmore runs), avg 53.51. And Lamba also had 5 centuries in the Duleep\n\nTrophy (though he did not score 1000 runs in the Duleep Trophy and\n\nso I dont have his average). Lamba got only 4 tests in his career -\n\nhe showed a few technical weaknesses IMHO (which is why I personally\n\nthink Rajput could have gotten more, Lamba looked more an ODI-type\n\nplayer to me and a pretty decent one). But, regardless, Lamba had\n\nsome outstanding domestic performances and earned his chances.\n\nAnd then there was Arun Lal - 53 average in the Ranjis, 66 in the\n\nDuleeps. He too was a contender for an opener spot at this time. He\n\nwas older than Lamba/Rajput etc by a good 5 years so maybe he shouldnt\n\nhave stayed a contender as late as he did (ie when they were 26 or\n\nso, he was already in his early 30s). One could have made an age\n\nargument against him - but he was still scoring bundles of runs, far\n\nmore than Saldhana ever did in his career.\n\nLook at it this way - Saldhana played in the 80s, and by the early\n\n90s he had 3471 runs at 47.4. At this same time, Chandrakant Pandit\n\nhad 3198 runs at 54.20 - and he was a wicketkeeper, and he *still*\n\nwasnt getting many tests at this time! Abdul Azeem, an opener playing\n\nin the very same zone as Carlton Saldhana, by the time Saldhana\n\nretired had scored 3576 runs at 49.80 himself (both numbers superior\n\nto Saldhana's). The much-maligned Ghulam Parkar, who opened mostly\n\nin the 1980s himself, averaged 49.79 for his career - and he was\n\neasily the best fielder in the country to boot. Yusuf Ali Khan,\n\nanother opener (in the weaker-bowling Central Zone, maybe),\n\naveraged 54.74 in 64 innings by this time.\n\nAnd the above, of course, are openers being listed. If youre talking\n\njust batsmen you could toss in Amarjeet Kaypee (61.51), Milind\n\nGunjal (54.54), KP Bhaskar (61.35) etc.\n\nOr you could even list Surendra Bhave, yet another opener. By 1993,\n\nBhave was averaging 81.03 for his career! And he held up in individual\n\nyear comparisons with Saldhana too - Saldhana had only 2 seasons in\n\nwhich he crossed 500 runs over his career, for example. For Carlton\n\nSaldhana those 2 years were 1986 (718 runs at 71.18) and 1990 (671\n\nruns at 74.55). Bhave also had 2 years by this time - 1988 (730\n\nruns at 91.25) and 1991 (651 runs at 93.00). As you can see, his\n\n2 \"best seasons\" were actually better than Carlton's - and they came\n\nat about the same time period.\n\nAlso, BTW, one cannot really use the \"strong South Zone attacks\"\n\nargument for Saldhana either IMHO. For 1986 in a perfect example -\n\nwhile Saldhana scored 718 runs at 71.8 against South Zone attacks\n\nthat season, Arshad Ayub (yes, the off-spinner) scored 621 runs\n\nat 77.62 in the same year (1986) against those very same attacks :-)\n\n> And since we are talking about Abdul \"Dependable\" Jabbar, whose career\n\n> extended from the early 70s to the mid-80s, here are his numbers\n\n> (remember he was an all-rounder) -\n\n>\n\n> Matches - 87\n\n> Innings - 125\n\n> Not Outs - 20\n\n> Runs - 4270\n\n> Highest Score - 201*\n\n> Average - 40.66\n\n> 100s - 4\n\n> 50s - 27\n\n>\n\n> Balls - 3274\n\n> Runs - 1139\n\n> Wickets - 40\n\n> Average - 28.47\n\n> Best - 4-63\n\n> 5fers - 0\n\n> 10fers - 0\n\n> Strike Rate - 81.8\n\n> Economy Rate - 2.08\n\n>\n\nI know about Abdul Jabbar - yet another very good and consistent\n\nRanji performer. But once again, the above are not *great* numbers\n\nIMHO. I mean, calling him an allrounder is stretching it slightly,\n\nsurely, given that he took an average of less than 1 wicket every\n\n2 matches? And again, the numbers are not *great* - Roger Binny\n\nwas a far superior bowler, obviously, and Binny averaged 43 with the\n\nbat for his career in the same zone playing at a similar time. Why\n\nwould Jabbar have made it ahead of Binny, say? (Not to mention that\n\nallrounders were actually not really needed at this time, with India\n\nhaving Kapil, Ghavri, Madan Lal etc in the 70s/80s - and then\n\nKapil, Madan, Chetan Sharma, Prabhakar, Shastri etc in the later\n\n80s). Iam not sure Jabbar would make it ahead of most of those on\n\nbatting alone - and surely not even close on the bowling. No?\n\n> Also, great numbers for V.

But again, a Ranji average of 40\n\nis *not* \"great\" IMHO. It was better in the 70s than in the 80s, but\n\neven then there were quite a few batsmen who were doing quite well.\n\nAs you can see from the averages of people like Milind Gunjal, or\n\nAshok Mankad etc. V Siva had great longevity - thus it is hard to\n\ncome up off-hand with contemporaries as such. But there are literally\n\ndozens of 1980s Ranji bats who averaged well over 40 without ever\n\ngetting a sniff of contention IMHO. For example Khalid Abdul Qayyum\n\nof Hyderabad averaged 44 - he played at a similar time too, really.\n\n(Another example, Shishir Hattangadi of Bombay played a lot in the 80s\n\nand scored 3500+ runs at 43 - and I dont think Ive ever heard *anybody*\n\ndescribe him as a national contender. He hardly ever played Duleeps,\n\nin fact). V Sivaramakrishnan also had only 1 Duleep ton in his career -\n\nin 80/81 against Central Zone.\n\n> These are some of the players players that, imho, got a bad deal from\n\n> the national selectors.\n\n>\n\nAgain, I disagree - but that is purely a personal opinion.\n\nSadiq [ 40 in the Ranjis really wasnt *that* much ] Yusuf\n\n> Ambrish Sundaram\n\nsamarth harish shah <shs...@students.uiuc.edu> wrote in message news:<Pine.GSO.4.31.030113...@ux8.cso.uiuc.edu>...\n\n> On Mon, 13 Jan 2003, rkusenet wrote:\n\n>\n\nHum.

If you did, we could\n\nselect a team sitting in the USA :-) You have to look at things too.\n\nBut, more than that, even stats have context and should. I mean, if\n\na guy comes in at age 17 and doesnt score his first 2 years, but\n\nscores his next 2 years - should you not pick him at 21 because his\n\nentire record is still poor? Or shouldnt you see that he was very\n\nyoung then, and his last 2 years are what ought to be looked at more\n\nthan anything else? Secondly, you also get to watch players at the\n\nDuleep and Irani levels and see how they do - and pick on that basis,\n\nvery often.\n\nThirdly, in those days University Cricket was big too, not just\n\nRanjis - lots of players were first identified in the Rohinton\n\nBaria tournament. This is not the case anymore. But Gavaskar was\n\nfirst identified there, as was Vijay Manjrekar IIRC. So were a host\n\nof others.\n\nFourthly, it depends on the team's situation. Are there lots of\n\nestablished bats doing well? Or is everyone doing horribly - in\n\nwhich case selectors often invest in talented youth, no matter\n\nwhat, in the hope for a better future. (This played a part in\n\nTendulkar's arrival, even though SRT did very well in domestics his\n\nfirst year - the other backup batsmen were WV Raman and Raman Lamba,\n\nand pretty much everyone knew these werent likely to be world stars\n\nanytime soon. You could tell that much looking at either bat even\n\nfor a short time. So investing in youth was easier to do).\n\nAnyway.\n\n> Before they got selected to play for India, Chetan Chauhan averaged 35 in\n\n> Ranjis and Yashpal Sharma averaged 38.\n\nI object to the above statement, if only in the sense that it seems to\n\nimply Chauhan was well-treated :-) Chauhan was more sinned-against\n\nthan sinning by the selectors, all his life.\n\nFirst, context. It was 1969, and India had *no* openers. None. It\n\nwas a desperate situation. Sardesai was used at opener (converted),\n\nand didnt do much - and then got injured and wasnt around (hurt hand\n\nonce, then thigh muscle). Jaisimha was tried at opener too. So\n\nwas Ramesh Saxena. So was keeper Kunderan. Then keeper Engineer. Finally\n\nwe were opening in test matches with Engineer and Abid Ali.\n\nChauhan was young, only 22. He had come into prominence with great\n\nperformances in the Vizzy Trophy first. Then Ranjis in 67/68, still\n\na kid and very defensive, got a 50 against Bombay (with 4 test bowlers)\n\nfor Maharasthra. Then 85 & 46 against Saurashtra. Next year, 68/69,\n\nhe played Bombay on a rain-affected track (note, BTW, that at this\n\ntime Bombay were about 13-consecutive-times defending Ranji champs).\n\nOn the rain-affected track, Maharasthra were 52/6 but Chauhan opened\n\nthe batting and batted thru to getting 101, a terrific knock. Next\n\nmatch against Baroda he got 98 run out.\n\nSo he was brought into Duleep Trophy cricket. He got 103 against\n\nSouth Zone (bowling attack Prasanna, Venkat, VV Kumar etc). He\n\nwas still only about 21.\n\nNow, at this stage when the 69/70 season started and India had *no*\n\nopeners of any kind, Chauhan was already close to selection given\n\nhis good performances the previous year (a Ranji ton against champions,\n\nplus 98, plus a ton against South Zone). He didnt do much in the Iranis\n\non a difficult track - but nobody did, ROI was 96 allout! Competition\n\nSudhir Naik and Abid Ali failed too. Then in the next match, the\n\nDuleep Trophy, Chauhan had 10 and 73* - and during the 73* he put on\n\n170 with the Indian captain Wadekar.\n\nIt was given all this context that Chauhan was picked for test cricket\n\nin 69/70 - at age 22. He made 18 in 53 minutes - then made 34 in 200\n\nminutes in the 2nd innings (note that this is the Bangar-type of role,\n\nto blunt the new ball. He did that job, at least). So he was retained\n\nfor the 2nd test - he got 14 and 19, and took 5 catches. But he was\n\ndropped after this test anyway.\n\nHe came back in the 5th test (after some more openers had failed). He\n\nmade 19 and 1, and was dropped totally and completely.\n\nNow, IMHO, given the context Chauhan's picking was not so surprising,\n\nor bad. But once he was dropped, he was *very* badly ill-treated IMHO.\n\nHe was not picked for anything - no Duleeps, no Iranis, no tour matches,\n\nnothing. While he was continuously doing well in the Ranjis, for 5\n\nwhole years. Meanwhile Jayantilal went to WI, Gopal Bose to SL etc.\n\nIn 1971/72 Chauhan made 540 at 71 in the Ranjis - and got nothing for it.\n\nHe actually made the most total runs in the Ranjis that year,in *any*\n\nzone. The next year he made 873 runs at 124! So he got 2 tests against\n\nEngland in 73 and failed. But he was not given any touring matches\n\nagainst the touring WI at all as a result.\n\nFinally in 1975 he moved to Delhi. He still didnt get picked for the\n\nIrani Trophy - Venkat Sundaram (his Delhi teammate) was picked instead!\n\nChauhan got to play Sri Lanka in a tour match, for North Zone - he\n\nscored 107 and 67. Still no dice, still Sundaram picked over him.\n\nSo he went back to Ranjis. And made 121 against Haryana (Kapil, Rajinder\n\nGoel, Sarkar Talwar). Then 106* against East Zone in Duleeps, followed\n\nby 116* against West Zone in Duleeps. And still he couldnt make it\n\nback.\n\nNext year NZ and England were touring India. Chauhan made 150 in the\n\nDuleeps against Central Zone - but failed in 2 fc games against England,\n\nand so couldnt make it back. So back he went to Ranjis - 158 against\n\nHaryana, 200 against Punjab, 147 against Karnataka. Overall 640\n\nruns at 80.50 for the season. And *still* he couldnt make it back!!\n\nNext year, in the Duleeps, he made 128 to start the year against West\n\nZone, and also took 3/67 with the ball! And finally, after all those\n\nconsistent scores season after season, he was picked again - to\n\ntour Australia with the Indian team in 77/78. There he finally\n\nestablished himself, and was a solid rock for the Indian team at\n\nopener for the next few years - before he was once again most\n\nunfairly dropped.\n\nOverall, if you look at Chauhan's career above, I dont think he got\n\nany favours from the selectors at all. Maybe in 1969 when he was a kid\n\nand had a terrific season at 21 and we were desparate for openers - maybe\n\nthen. But on that basis he was also seeming labelled a \"Ranji king\", and\n\nreally given hardly any chances at all, despite repeatedly scoring very\n\nheavily in the domestics at every level (Ranji and Duleep both). He\n\neventually forced his way in by weight of scores, with some quite\n\nterrific domestic seasons.\n\n> I am sure Vengsarkar's Ranji\n\n> average was not very high when he was first chosen to play for India. He\n\n> was chosen based on 1 Irani knock, mostly.\n\nNot true, BTW - in terms of Ranji average that is :-) He just hadnt\n\nplayed much, but he hadnt done badly.\n\nAgain, context. Awful batting side for India, no real talented players\n\nat all bar SMG and GRV. Repeated batting failures by the rest, time\n\nand again at test level. And suddenly this young 19 year old appears\n\nin the Irani Trophy, and takes apart Bedi and Prasanna with 7 sixes\n\n(so saith Uday) and a quite brilliant century.\n\nThen he goes to the Ranjis, and scores 77, 0 and 125 in the 3 games\n\nhe gets to play - thus his Ranji average is actually 67, in a very\n\nsmall sample size. But the key is, he has now played Iranis and\n\ndone great, then continued doing quite well in 3 Ranji games too, at\n\na time the selectors are desperate. So he was promptly taken into\n\nthe test 14 for the tours of NZ and WI.\n\nOK, this is getting too involved. So Iam going to break this post\n\ninto 2 parts - and handle the other names you mentioned later :-)\n\nSadiq [ more fun than the NZ ODIs, anyway ] Yusuf\n\n>\n\n> -Samarth.\n\n>\n\n> >\n\n> > rk-\n\n> >\n\n> >\n\n> >\n\n> >\n\n\"Shripathi Kamath\" <firstnam...@hotmail.com> wrote in message news:<KaQU9.62667$t06.3...@news2.east.cox.net>...\n\n> \"Amol Cricketwallah\" <cricke...@hotmail.com> wrote in message\n\n> news:a374a779.03011...@posting.google.com...\n\n> >\n\n> > First of all, you cant just select on stats.

If a person comes in at\n\nage 18 and fails for 2 years, then suceeds for 2 years - and so he\n\nhas been a success for 2 years at age 21, I think he has a great\n\nchance of getting in. If a person has come into Ranji cricket at\n\nage 24 and fails for 2 years, then suceeds for 2 years - I think,\n\nat age 28, he has *very* little chance of getting in. That is the\n\nreality of the situation, whether you agree with it or not.\n\nThe simple fact is, people who do well at age 21 are not so common -\n\nthey are seen as much rarer talents. People who do well at age 28\n\nare not that uncommon OTOH - they are more seasoned in lots of\n\ndifferent\n\nforms of cricket. They are not considered to be \"learning\" anymore.\n\nYou may think it is only a matter of a \"common thread of recent form\"\n\n- I disagree. I think it is more than that, it is often a matter of\n\ntalent etc itself. (I also happened to oppose Debang Gandhi's being\n\npicked when he was in 1999 - he too had played for many years without\n\nhuge successes at the Ranji level. And then he too had 2 very big\n\nyears against weakish East Zone competition at age 27/28. Not only\n\ndid I feel he shouldnt be picked, I thought picking someone like\n\nNikhil Haldipur from his very same Ranji team would make more sense\n\nin my opinion - Haldipur was only about 23 at the time. Because IMHO\n\nthere was a difference in talent level alone - and Debang didnt have\n\nit in spades IMHO. Anyway).\n\n>\n\n> > Thirdly, in those days University Cricket was big too, not just\n\n> > Ranjis - lots of players were first identified in the Rohinton\n\n> > Baria tournament.

That\n\nis,\n\npeople were not picked for the national team on the basis of the\n\nRohinton\n\nBaria, a college tournament. But if people did very well in that\n\ntournament\n\n(at an age of about 20), they became \"people to watch\". Then if they\n\nhad a year or two of good performances in the domestics, they had a\n\nchance\n\nto make it - because the name was sort of well known by then.\n\nThis is not something that can apply to a 28 year old. If it does, his\n\nUniversity days were 5 years past, and he had 5 years worth of no-big-\n\ndeal performances in the meantime. That counts far more than any\n\nRohinton Baria would, for him. Again, IMHO the age is a vital\n\ncriterion here.\n\n> > Fourthly, it depends on the team's situation.

Right now, before going to NZ. We had 2 test batsmen with a test\n\naverage of over 50. And 3 more with a test average of over 40. In\n\nthat scenario, there is no reason to push in someone like Ambati\n\nRayudu too early - there is no emergency. If OTOH our lineup had\n\n1 batsman average over 50, 1 over 40, 2 over 30 and 2 in their 20s...\n\nI think Rayudu would have been considered a bit more. Because it would\n\nbe a \"not much to lose\" situation.\n\n>\n\n> I don't have a dispute with the case of Chauhan or Yashpal.

For example, he was\n\nalways young (21-22), and his overall average was poor due to teenage\n\nyears, while his latest Ranji year had been very solid. *And* he had\n\nat least one or two solid performances at Duleep level, or against\n\na touring side. This applied to Chauhan, Yashpal and Gaekwad.\n\n> It is simpler, to discard someone on the basis that he had a 34 average\n\n> compared to someone else who had a 70 average, with the supposition that\n\n> both of them were fighting exactly for one single spot is off-the-mark.\n\n>\n\n> The fact is that some folks got a chance with averages in the 30s, some\n\n> didn't.

Again, IMHO age does play a big part\n\nthere.\n\nAlso, refer above - 21 years old, overall 30 Ranjis but latest year\n\ngood, plus at least a good performance or two at Duleeps or against\n\ntouring teams. I dont see how this is directly comparable to (say)\n\n27 years old, with 5 poor years and 2 decent years so now averaging\n\n30, with 1 good Duleeps in that 7 year span. IMHO the two are very\n\nvery different cases.\n\n>\n\n> Magically a lack of talent seems to first appears at this vital juncture.\n\n> And yet nowhere before or during this time was there a slot for Dalvi,\n\n> correct?\n\n>\n\nOh come on. Talent, plus some demonstration of it with a big score or\n\ntwo,\n\nat a young age - how is that comparable to Dalvi in 1976? How can you\n\nignore the age part totally?\n\n> Here are a select few of Dalvi's stats:\n\n>\n\n> MK Dalvi 2 4 1 248 112 82.66 1 1 1 - SOUTH\n\n> 75/76 Duleep Trophy\n\n> MK Dalvi 1 2 0 35 18 17.50 - - - - SOUTH\n\n> 76/77 Duleep Trophy\n\n>\n\n> He saw the writing on the wall for him at this stage with TN and South zone,\n\n> and moved to Bengal.\n\n>\n\n> MK Dalvi 4 5 1 271 151 67.75 1 1 2 - BENG\n\n> 77/78 FC\n\n> MK Dalvi 7 13 2 438 112 39.81 1 2 1 -\n\n> BENG/EAST FC\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> BTW, I did see Dalvi bat on many an occasion.

The first time this Dalvi argument came up, it was to say that he\n\nshould have been picked in 1971/72. So that was how it was argued at\n\nthe time - with comparable figures etc. Now suddenly the argument is\n\nthat he should have been picked in 1976! You mention elsewhere that he\n\nshould have made the team from 76-79, was it?\n\nWell ok. Lets look at Dalvi at this stage, if you like.\n\n1975/76:\n\nBefore the season starts, Michael Dalvi is *THIRTY YEARS OLD*. This\n\nis *before* the season starts. And at this stage he has never been\n\na real contender for a national side. He has never even played a\n\nDuleep Trophy match for South Zone (this is surely not the national\n\nselectors fault). He has consistently averaged in the 30s and no\n\nbetter at the Ranji level - he started playing in 1969, and has now\n\nplayed for 7 full seasons to compile this 30-odd record. And, with\n\nno Duleep Trophy games, he hasnt had huge successes at the \"Ranji\n\nknockout\" level either - the one season TN went all the way to the\n\nfinals he averaged 10 in the knockouts, for example (72 IIRC).\n\nSo 1975/76 season begins. The Ranjis commence. Dalvi has:\n\nvs Andhra: 25\n\nvs Kerala: Washed out, DNB\n\nvs Hyd : 16 & 78*\n\nvs Kar : 1\n\nThus 1 fifty and 0 centuries in the Ranji season, with the notout\n\nbringing his average up to 40.00. This is a fair performance, but\n\nsurely not a whole lot more? After all, he *is* 30 years old - which\n\nstill cannot be ignored. And 40.00 for the year isnt exactly a\n\nmind-bogglingly brilliant performance or anything - 23 year old\n\nYajuvendra Singh, for instance, had just completed this same Ranji\n\nseason with 583 runs at 97.17 for the year.\n\nStill, this is a good performance, one of his better Ranji shows in\n\na while. So he gets a promotion, and plays for South Zone in the\n\nDuleep Trophy this same season. And he does well. In the Duleeps\n\nDalvi has:\n\nvs Central Zone: 112 & 79*\n\nvs North Zone : 43 & 14\n\nNote he had an amazing game against Central Zone - whose mighty\n\nbowling lineup consisted of Sardar Khan, Hyder Ali, Gulrez Ali\n\nand H Ahmad. In this same match Brijesh Patel (another contender\n\nmuch younger than Dalvi and with a superior Ranji record) also\n\ngot a century - exactly 100.\n\nIn the game against North Zone Dalvi had 43 and 14 - not bad of\n\ncourse. But sort of paling in comparison to Brijesh Patel who had\n\nanother century - 105. And another contender, Surinder Amarnath,\n\ncame in at #3 and made 122* and stayed undefeated while North Zone\n\nwere allout.\n\nThis was a good Duleep Trophy for Dalvi - as you mention above. But\n\nagain, he had 248 runs at 82.66. Meanwhile in this same tournament\n\nSurinder Amarnath had 263 runs at 87.66 (more runs at a better\n\naverage - Oh, and Surinder was 3 years younger). Chauhan had 303 runs\n\nat 75.75 (with 2 centuries) - Chauhan was 2 years younger, with a far\n\nmore consistent Ranji record. Brijesh had 221 at 73.66 (also with 2\n\ncenturies) - Brijesh also had a far better Ranji record, and was\n\n*seven*\n\nyears younger!\n\nGaekwad (also 7 years younger) played only 1 Duleep game this season\n\nto Dalvi's 2. Yet Gaekwad had 56 & 115* in his 2 innings - for an\n\naverage of 171.\n\nThus you had at least 5 players who had done very well in this Duleep\n\nseason. One of them was 30 years old - and it was his first standout\n\nperformance in 7 years of domestic cricket. Almost all the others had\n\nsuperior Ranji records at the time - certainly superior *recent* Ranji\n\nrecords. And they were 28, 27, 23 and 23 years old. I know which ones\n\nwould be the strongest contenders if I was a selector. And this is\n\nnot even mentioning people like Yajuvendra Singh, Ashok Mankad, or\n\nDilip Vengsarkar (who had just emerged in the Iranis and Ranjis - heck\n\nVengsarkar had played only 4 matches, and yet he had 2 centuries on\n\nhis short domestic season to Dalvi's 1!)\n\nStill, this was only 1975/76 - and Dalvi's terrific show in the\n\nDuleeps\n\nprobably made him a genuine contender. Another good season the next\n\nyear and he would be in line maybe, even given his age, if the others\n\nfailed badly. (They didnt, both Amarnath and Brijesh scored test tons\n\non\n\nthe twin tours, and Brijesh was part of the famous POS win. But anyway\n\n-\n\nsurely Dalvi was still in with an outside shot going into the next\n\nyear).\n\nSo, onto 1976/77 - England would be coming to town, and there were\n\nstill possibly places to be won. Dalvi was now 31 years old, but\n\nstill was a contender (maybe).\n\nRanjis, 76/77:\n\nvs Andhra : 1 & 10\n\nvs Kerala : 108*\n\nvs Hyd : 9 & 2\n\nvs Kar : 1\n\nQFs vs Rlws: 1 & 15\n\nSFs vs Bbay: Did Not Play\n\nDuleeps, 76/77:\n\nvs West : 17 & 18\n\nAs you can see, he got 6 matches in the season - and he got past 20\n\nexactly once, when he went on to 108* against Kerala. The century\n\nbrought his Ranji average up to exactly 21.00 for the season (147\n\nruns in the year). In the Duleeps he averaged 17.5 (35 runs total).\n\nHe was 31 years old at this stage - what chance would he have had to\n\nmake the national team at this stage? In this season, while Dalvi\n\nwas averaging 21.00 in the Ranjis, Ashok Mankad made 827 runs at\n\n206.75 in an attempt to try and come back to the Indian team (only to\n\nbe heckled by RK's cousin :-) Brijesh Patel made 601 runs at 100.16\n\nthis same season, and stayed a regular in the national side. Heck,\n\neven people like Abdul Hai of UP did well (550 runs at 50.00).\n\nThis was such a poor season for Dalvi that he wasnt even picked to\n\nplay for South Zone against the touring England side (surely a\n\ndecision\n\nmade by South Zone selectors, not national selectors). Surinder\n\nAmarnath\n\ndid play for North Zone, and did well. And when he was recalled to the\n\ntest side, Surinder did well enough in his 2 tests to top the Indian\n\nbatting averages for the series! (Brijesh didnt do great, but he was\n\n2nd in the total series aggregate, after only Gavaskar).\n\nSo, the next year, 1977/78. Now Dalvi is 32 years old, and has moved\n\nto Bengal in the East Zone.\n\nvs Orissa: DNB\n\nvs Assam : 151\n\nvs Bihar : 1 & 32*\n\nQF vs Hyd: 68 & 19\n\nOverall 4 matches, 5 inns, 1 notout, 271 runs, avg 67.50.\n\nIt might be pointed out that East Zone wasnt particularly strong -\n\nwhich\n\nmight have played a part in Dalvi putting up both his highest-ever\n\nRanji score and best-ever Ranji season at age 32. But then that would\n\nbe uncharitable, wouldnt it? :-) (So I'll be content with pointing\n\nout that Palash Nandy scored 320 runs for Bengal that same year,\n\nat 65.00 himself.\n\nAnd, BTW, by this time there were quite a few good Ranji batting\n\nperformances in general. This same season, Venkat Sundaram made 608\n\nruns at 86.87. Yashpal Sharma (23 years old with a Duleep ton behind\n\nhim) had 554 runs at 79.14. And Roger Binny in Karnataka had 563\n\nruns at 62.55 (and, you recall, Binny was not only young, he even\n\nbowled a little bit :-)\n\nAt any rate, Dalvi wasnt picked for the Duleep Trophy for East Zone\n\nthis season.\n\nFinally, the last year of your time-frame, 1978/79. Dalvi was now 33\n\nyears old, and he had 5 matches, 9 innings, 2 notouts, 273 runs,\n\navg 39.00 for Bengal, with a high of 72*. This time he *was* picked\n\nfor the Duleeps - and playing against North Zone he made 25 & 23 in\n\nhis 2 innings.\n\nThat is the full record of Michael Dalvi. Again, I dont personally see\n\nwhen he should have made it and was ill-treated myself. If you have\n\none particular moment when he should have been in the team but was\n\njobbed, please say so - and I'll try and analyze that exact moment,\n\nwhat other contenders existed at that moment who took his spot etc.\n\n> Surinder Amarnath made it, Dalvi was technically sounder than him. Don't\n\n> take my word for it, ask someone else who had seen both of them.\n\n>\n\nYes, well. Kaif is much more sound technically than Sehwag - look who\n\nis playing test cricket for India at the moment (and why? Because Kaif\n\nwas tried on the basis of \"technical soundness\" without a great fc\n\nrecord - and he came up short. Sehwag OTOH had a terrific fc record\n\ndespite lack of technique and no soundness in choice of stroke - and\n\nhe has responded in test cricket with 2 centuries abroad, in England\n\nand in South Africa). Surinder might not have been great technically,\n\nbut he was a terrific strokeplayer who had some great international\n\nmoments.\n\nThe simple fact is that Surinder Amarnath had a superior domestic\n\nrecord to Dalvi. Once again, Dalvi had *ONE* Duleep Trophy century\n\nin his life - and 1 really good Duleep game! That one year when\n\nDalvi had a great Duleep season, Surinder Amarnath had a *better*\n\nseason (more runs at a better average)! And Surinder was 3 years\n\nyounger at that time.\n\nThe next year Surinder did poorly in the Duleeps - average 27.00 in 2\n\nmatches. But that was still better than Dalvi (avg 17.5).\n\nThe year after that, Dalvi didnt make the Duleep Trophy side. Surinder\n\ndid, and averaged 52.33.\n\nThe year after that, Dalvi averaged 24.00 in the Duleep Trophy.\n\nSurinder\n\naveraged 46.50.\n\nAnd all this not even taking into account the fact that Surinder\n\noverall\n\nhad a better Ranji record than Dalvi (he averaged nearly 42 in the\n\nRanjis, compared to Dalvi's 35). Nor the fact that Surinder was 3\n\nyears younger (and had done well against touring teams - like against\n\nEngland in 76/77, which is how he made the team against England to\n\nstart with).\n\n> My argument is not that he would have been a success in tests, just that he\n\n> never got a shot. Gaekwad for e.g. got a shot IIRC with poor averages too\n\n> (but I forgot that he was real young then, so it is different).\n\n>\n\nOh, it is different :-) You may choose not to believe it, but there\n\nisnt\n\na selector in the world who doesnt believe that age matters. Oh, and\n\nit might be pointed out that Gaekwad got in after scoring a century\n\nagainst that touring team (at age 22) - when did Dalvi do that,\n\nexactly?\n\n> > And suddenly this young 19 year old appears\n\n> > in the Irani Trophy, and takes apart Bedi and Prasanna with 7 sixes\n\n> > (so saith Uday) and a quite brilliant century.\n\n> >\n\n> > Then he goes to the Ranjis, and scores 77, 0 and 125 in the 3 games\n\n> > he gets to play - thus his Ranji average is actually 67, in a very\n\n> > small sample size.

Note that he was 19 (compared to Dalvi's 31 at that time) - and\n\nhe still already had 2 centuries for the season in only 4 games when\n\nthe team was picked (while Dalvi had 1). Not to mention his century\n\nin the Iranis came against Bedi and Prasanna - a slightly better\n\nattack than Hyder Ali, Gulrez Ali etc? :-)\n\nSadiq [ who never thought he'd go thru another Dalvi argument ] Yusuf\n\n\n\n\"Amol Cricketwallah\" <cricke...@hotmail.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:a374a779.03011...@posting.google.com...\n\n> \"Shripathi Kamath\" <firstnam...@hotmail.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:<KaQU9.62667$t06.3...@news2.east.cox.net>...\n\n<snip>\n\n> > > But, more than that, even stats have context and should.

My\n\npoint is that those stats alone do not suffice, as was clear in the case of\n\nthe above folks. Given the state of the mo in the 70s, I contended that\n\nDalvi deserved a chance. Now clearly he did not have the stats, but I\n\nlisted other attributes as to why he should have been picked. Then, of\n\ncourse it is not a matter of moving the goal posts, but simply a new field\n\nof play.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> > It is simpler, to discard someone on the basis that he had a 34 average\n\n> > compared to someone else who had a 70 average, with the supposition that\n\n> > both of them were fighting exactly for one single spot is off-the-mark.\n\n> >\n\n> > The fact is that some folks got a chance with averages in the 30s, some\n\n> > didn't.

All three 'look good', all three have decent technique.\n\nA and B have better stats 55+ to C who has 35+. A and B are given chances\n\n(rightly so), they fail at the test level, to the level that they do not\n\nindicate any signs of being possible successes. Yet C is not afforded a\n\nsolitary shot because after A and B are done (for now) E and F are tried,\n\nand when they fail, back come A and B. My only point is that C deserved a\n\nshot if not when A and B failed the first, then at least before they were\n\nrecalled the second time.\n\n>\n\n> >\n\n> > Magically a lack of talent seems to first appears at this vital\n\njuncture.\n\n> > And yet nowhere before or during this time was there a slot for Dalvi,\n\n> > correct?\n\n> >\n\n>\n\n> Oh come on.

So was V.Siva - but not quite all the time.\n\nTN floated their lineup quite often in those days - for a while actually\n\nV Siva batted at #4 in the lineup (with Dalvi at #3 and TE Srinivasan\n\nat #5!) But he did open for longish periods too.\n\n> V. Siva was probably the closest to national selection of the TN bats of\n\n> the 70s and 80s.

Siva got as many opportunities as he should have in\n\n> the Duleeps, FC games vs. touring sides, etc.\n\n>\n\nActually, V. Siva played lots of Duleeps and first-class games against\n\ntouring sides etc.\n\nFor example, in Duleeps:\n\n75/76: 1 match, 2 inns, 28 runs, avg 14.00\n\n76/77: Did not Play\n\n77/78: 1 match, 2 inns, 78 runs, avg 39.00 1 fifty\n\n78/79: 1 match, 2 inns, 45 runs, avg 22.50\n\n79/80: 2 match, 3 inns, 115 runs, avg 38.33 1 fifty\n\n80/81: 1 match, 2 inns, 110 runs, avg 55.00 1 ton\n\n81/82: 1 match, 1 inns, 1 run, avg 1.00\n\n82/83: 1 match, 2 inns, 58 runs, avg 29.00\n\n84/85: 1 match, 2 inns, 45 runs, avg 22.50\n\nAs you can see, from 1975 to 1984, he was on the South Zone Duleep\n\nteam in 8 out of 9 years - that is, playing for them very often\n\nindeed. Remember in these days Duleep Trophies were straight\n\nknock-out affairs - thus South Zone often ended up playing only 1\n\ngame in a season, sometimes 2. Thus a lot of the \"1 match\" lists\n\nabove are actually the entire Duleep tournament for South Zone (though\n\nnot all of them).\n\nAlso, he actually got to play touring sides quite a lot. In those days\n\nmost touring sides played *tons* of first-class games - they usually\n\nplayed all the zones individually on their tours. I didnt bother to\n\ncheck their \"other\" fc tour games (ie vs Colts, vs Combined Univs,\n\nvs Board Presidents XI, vs Ranji Champs etc) - but just from touring\n\nteams playing against South Zone V Siva played against tons of touring\n\nteams. For example:\n\nvs England 76/77 for SZ : 27 & 2\n\nvs WI 78/79 for SZ : 4 & 1\n\nvs Australia 79/80 for SZ : 7 & 32 (at #5)\n\nvs Pakistan 79/80 for SZ : 6 & 2\n\nvs England 81/82 for SZ : 38 & 30\n\nAs you can see, he didnt do all that well against touring teams - in\n\n5 matches (10 innings) against touring sides, he never reached 40.\n\nThis is probably what really cost him as far as getting into true\n\ncontention for an India spot, IMHO. For example, Gaekwad first got\n\ninto the national side by hitting a century against the touring\n\nWindies in 74/75 when he was only 22 years old - that always seems\n\nto make a difference. (TE Srinivasan got into contention after\n\nscoring a century against the touring Pakistanis in the 79/80 game\n\nlisted above - though TES was batting at #5 then IIRC, not opening\n\nthe innings).\n\n> Other TN bats (Jabbar, eg.) also could probably have gotten more games at\n\n> a higher (Duleep, FC games visiting teams) level. I think throughout the\n\n> 90s also this was the problem: not that TN players didn't get to play\n\n> tests, but that they didn't get a chance at a higher level than the RT.\n\n> Vasu, for example, had outstanding Ranji figures but had hardly played a\n\n> Duleep game.

Same with Sunil Subramanian and Sharath, I suspect.\n\n>\n\nI dont agree with the above either - all of them *did* play Duleep\n\nmatches. Not always consistently, but a fair bit. And Sharath has\n\nactually been *very* regular in the Duleep XI for South Zone.\n\nFor example, looking at these players (didnt bother to do actual\n\nresults for them, takes up too much time to do it for everyone :-)..\n\nbut, looking at these players as far as playing for South Zone in\n\nthe Duleep Trophy in the 90s is concerned:\n\n1990/91: Vasu 1 match\n\n1991/92: Vasu 2 matches\n\n1992/93: Vasu 1 match\n\nNote that in all the 3 seasons listed above, the Duleeps were straight\n\nknock-outs - thus sometimes 1 match was all that South Zone played. In\n\nthe season after this, 1993/94 onwards, the Duleep Trophy was converted\n\nto a round-robin, and each team now got to play 4 games. In these\n\nseasons:\n\n1993/94: Vasu 2 matches, Sharath 4 matches, Sunil Subs 2 matches\n\n1994/95: Sharath 4 matches, Sunil Subs 4 matches\n\n1995/96: Vasu 2 matches, Sharath 4 matches\n\nAfter this season, the Duleep Trophy again reverted to a round-robin\n\nformat, and once again you could be one-and-done, thus getting only\n\na single game. In these seasons:\n\n1996/97: Sharath 1 match (SZ played 2)\n\n1997/98: Sharath 1 match (SZ played 1)\n\n1998/99: Sharath 1 match (SZ played 1)\n\n1999/00: Sharath 1 match (SZ played 1)\n\nThe 3 cases referred to above are different. Vasu, for example,\n\nwas a regular in the South zone for his first 3 years, and eventually\n\nplayed in 5 different years. He was a solid performer, but it was\n\nslightly hard for him to get in - he wouldnt IMHO get in on either\n\nbatting or bowling, but as allrounder. On batting alone there were\n\nprobably more than 5 SZ players ahead of him IMHO. As for bowling,\n\nhe was seam plus spin - he didnt deserve to make the team either as\n\na pure paceman (with Prasad, Ganesh, Srinath, David Johnson etc around),\n\nnor as pure spinner (with Sunil Subs, Raju, Kumble, Joshi etc around).\n\nThus he was really a true utility player - and a very good one - and\n\nthat was his role. But with the presence of Robin Singh (often a regular\n\nafter the early 90s) his situation got more difficult IMHO. Plus he\n\nwas unlucky (I remember him being picked for a Challenger Trophy\n\nonce, with all the selectors watching - and he had to fly home before\n\na single game had been played due to a death in the family, poor chap).\n\nSunil Subramanium was in an out-and-out difficult situation IMHO - he\n\nwas a spinner in a zone full of good spinners. In the early 90s he\n\ncouldnt get in because he was competing with someone like Raju. I\n\nespecially remember 1993/94 actually - the \"stars\" were available for\n\nonly the first 2 matches (then they went off to play something, maybe\n\nthe Hero Cup, not sure). Thus for the first 2 matches Sunil Subramanium\n\ndidnt get to play - it was Raju and Kumble. But he was first-choice\n\nbackup LAS, and played the next 2 (after Raju had left). The next\n\nseason Raju wasnt around, so he played all 4 matches.\n\nAfter that things got even more difficult for him - he was displaced\n\nas first-backup LAS by Sunil Joshi (who had had an awesome season or\n\ntwo at the Ranjis and was an allrounder to boot). So his chances\n\nto play Duleeps vanished entirely - either Sunil Joshi was #1 for\n\nIndia (in which case Raju was #1 for SZ) or vice versa, and either\n\nleft Sunil Subramanium as #3.\n\nIn his couple of seasons, though, Sunil Subramanium got a couple of\n\nopportunities. He got to play Duleeps, and then also Iranis one year\n\nIIRC. And I seem to recall him playing a couple of Wills Trophy etc\n\nas well (for some reason I seem to recall Manjrekar sweeping him\n\nfor 5 fours in one over, dont know why :-)\n\nAnd finally Sharath. He has not been ill-treated at all as far as\n\ngetting Duleep opportunities are concerned - Sharath has, as you can\n\nsee above, missed only *1 match* that South Zone played in the Duleeps\n\nfrom 1993 to 2000!\n\nOverall, if you want my own personal opinion, I dont think most of\n\nthese TN players were discriminated against at all, purely IMHO. I\n\ndont think V Siva was, nor Vasu nor Sunil Subramanium (in that I\n\npersonally dont think they were overwhelmingly deserving of more chances\n\nthan they got, either). Heck, I dont even think Robin Singh was\n\noverlooked more than he should have been - I think in his major days\n\nwe were loaded with better allrounders and so didnt need him :-)\n\nThe one man from TN who I think was very hard done by is Sharath. I\n\nthink he was a terrific batsman, who was very-illtreated over the\n\nyears. It might not seem that way, looking at the fact that he played\n\n7 straight years of unbroken Duleeps in the 90s, for example. But I\n\nthink he was a quality guy who deserved more - and he wasnt given\n\nmore. I didnt check how he did in the Duleeps, but I recall him doing\n\npretty damn well - better than even Dravid and Laxman in the early\n\nyears, without ever getting the breaks they did.\n\nIMHO Sharath was a victim of the stupidity of the national selectors,\n\nand how they have changed over the years. There is too much concentration\n\non ODIs nowadays, so they are always looking for ODI-type players. Sharath\n\ncould score quickly enough, but for them \"ODI type\" also seemed to mean\n\nplayers who could do more than 1 thing! Thus a decent batsman would be\n\na contender only if he could also bowl a bit! This is downright stupid\n\nfor tests, but thats how they looked at it - a contender was a contender\n\nwas a contender, and they didnt seem to change for tests or ODIs. When\n\nthey picked their A-teams, they seemed to pick it with ODIs in mind\n\ntoo, not just tests - and thus ended up picking the wrong players IMHO.\n\nAnd, of course, the second stupidity was that the selectors didnt\n\nbelieve in truly forming a backup line. If this was Australia, theyd\n\npick about 25 men for a roster, and pay them all for the season\n\n(according to contract), and maybe that would make them select 25\n\nproper players, 2 proper sides worth (with maybe 3 \"allrounder types\"\n\nadded in to make up 25). But we never did that. And so our selectors\n\nwasted the A-tours etc, using silly players half the time.\n\nIn the 1990s, the test team was the test team - fine. But IMHO the 2nd\n\nline could have and should have been developed and made *very* strong -\n\nby selecting the right players to tour with A-teams etc. If the\n\ntest squad had Dravid, Tendulkar, Ganguly, Azhar, Laxman that was\n\nok - but the A-team should have *always* had a lineup that was something\n\nsimilar to Amol Muzumdar, Sridharan Sharath, Pravin Amre, Jatin Paranjpe\n\nand Hrishikesh Kanitkar (maybe). Those were the true quality players -\n\nand IMHO could each have pushed for a test spot, and if they had gotten\n\nto play test cricket would have IMHO done pretty damn well with a proper\n\nrun. (I think Kanitkar was the least likely of that 4 in terms of\n\npure batting actually; but he was decent talent-wise without great\n\ntechnique, and he got in ahead of everyone else for tests and ODIs -\n\nbecause he could bowl, of course). In particular I think Amol and\n\nSharath would have done very well if they ever had to be pushed into\n\na test match - I think they would have flourished, actually, and might\n\nhave even created pressure on someone like Ganguly. Amre, of course,\n\nplayed tests and averaged over 40 - IMHO Amol was actually a better\n\nbat and maybe Sharath too (Iam biased since Ive seen more of Amol,\n\nprobably).\n\nHeck, even the 2nd line openers should IMHO have been Jaffer and\n\nHaldipur probably (if the first line was Sidhu/Ramesh/Das) - before\n\nHaldipur was replaced by Sriram in the late 90s.\n\nIt was only after this 2nd line of batsmen that we should have had\n\nplayers like Debang Gandhi at opener, or Rohan Gavaskar, or Vijay\n\nBharadwaj, or even Hemang Badani IMHO.\n\nBut with our selectors this never happened - they always picked the\n\nwrong players IMHO, with amazing consistency. Since Amol and Sharath\n\nwere not prototypical ODI type batsman and couldnt bowl either, they\n\nwere sidelined even from A tours (Iam thinking of the tour to\n\nPakistan, to WI, even to Netherlands etc). Kanitkar, Bharadwaj and\n\neven Rohan played for India or went on A-tours because they could\n\nbowl too. Badani was the worst case in some ways - he played on the\n\nsame team as Sharath and wasnt half the batsman Sharath was, ever.\n\nAnd yet he made it because he happened to hit 140 in a Ranji semis\n\nin front of the selectors, while poor Sharath happened to pick that\n\none game to relatively \"fail\" in. If the selectors had any regard\n\nfor the most important thing, consistency, they would have picked\n\nSharath over Badani years before that.\n\nAnd if the selectors had done their job, of course, we wouldnt be in\n\nhalf as bad a situation today as we are. This is what Australia did -\n\neven when they had Taylor, Slater, Blewett and sometimes Matthew Elliot\n\nat opener who were all doing well at times, they didnt \"throw away\"\n\na Hayden (who was sitting in the wings, but always seen as a \"likely\").\n\nWhen they had a full middle-order, they didnt throw away Langer - who\n\ndidnt play tests for about 7 years, but was still there, still a\n\ncontender, still being paid 150 grand a year by the Australian Cricket\n\nBoard. With all that, even when these guys had to come back when they\n\nwere 28 years old (after early exposure and early failure), they were\n\nfine and ready - and they have been wonderful since their return.\n\nIf the Indian board had done a similar job, conceivably we would have\n\nhad Sharath and Amol ready even today - and if we had injuries and/or\n\nserious form issues (as in NZ in the past month, for instance), we'd\n\nhave a couple of players ready to step in right away, who IMHO at\n\nleast could have averaged over 40 in test cricket themselves (though\n\nthis is purely a personal opinion).\n\nSadiq [ now those were the *truly* hard done by cases,\n\nnot the Dalvi's and TES's of the world ;-) ] Yusuf\n\n> -Samarth.\n\n>"
