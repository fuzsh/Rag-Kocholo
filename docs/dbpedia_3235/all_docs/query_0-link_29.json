CALCUTTA, MADRAS To My Parents Preface Political analysis of language problems of the developing na- tions is often marked by a presumption that language politics belongs to the realm of “uncivil” politics, svhich is invariably opposed to the logic of modem national development. This work attempts to show that such a presumption prevents us from ap- preciating the complex nature of language politics and its con- tribution to the process of national development. The purpose of this work is first to separate the complex phenomenon of lan- guage politics into its constituent elements and then to relate these elements to the concrete processes of policy formulation and implementation that are relevant to political integration and national development. The substantive materials are drawn from the scene of Indian language politics. The focus is on the mtiona} language ques- tion with special reference to the formulation and implemen- tation of national language policy. The evolution of language loyalties, their political expression through the medium of or- ganized associations, the role of these associations in the policy processes, and the intended, as well as unintended, consequences of associational language politics on national development are discussed in detail. The data presented in this work were col- lected mainly in north India. Field xvork for this project was done in 1964 and 1967, and it included interviews with the leading members of the language associations, language agencies in the administrative departments, and other relevant institu- tions. vni Preface \"VIotV. leading to this booh began in 1961 under the supcrvt* sion of John Gumperz and Ralph Retzlaff, both of tvhom have been invaluable guides ever since.

These conflicts are usually related to the competing demands made on the national political authority on the basis of ethnic, religious, and linguistic loyalties. The tendency to treat these loyalties as inher- ently antinational is widespread. The stubborn persistence of these particularist loyalties has even persuaded many perceptive observers to point out that the destructive impact of such loyal- ties may drive the drama of development toward a tragic end.* Such an ominous overtone is especially noticeable in the scholar- ly works and papular commentaries devoted to the analysis of the Indian scene. The implications of such trends of thought need some elabora- tion. Political development requires a rational ordering of goals and a conscious direction of the instruments fashioned for their achievement. A properly constituted national political author- ity is essential for the ordering, promotion, and achievement of such goals. The stronger the foundation of the national political 1 For example, see Gunnar Myrdal, Asian Drama, vol. i, chap. $, esp, pp. 83-122 (paperback). Myrdal refers to the general uncertainty of outcome but his particular study is tilted in the dismal direction. 2 Language Conpicl and National Development community the greater tvill be the rfectiveness ot the directing authority. The strength of the nation, according to this t\\'ay of thinking, is supposed to vary inversely with the degree of con- flict generated by subnational loyalues. If the strength of the nation is to be assured, the subnational loyalties must be dis- pensed vrith. The process of elimination may involve authori- tarian suppression or democratic pcisuasion. The nature of the subnational lopltics is such that democratic methods and meas- ures are likely to encnurage them. Only strong-handed authori- tarian measures seem to be capable of discouraging them. To that extent, a democratic system, according to this kind of rea- soning, is inconsistent wiih national integration and orderly political development. The generality of these implications and their particular ap- plicability to the concrete Indian situation raises grave doubts about the prospects of achieving national and political develop- ment through democratic institutions and processes. It is sur- prising that many of the IVestem observen svho believe in democratic principles have, nevertheless, readily conceded the futility of democratic operations for political development in transitional societies. They have been saying in eSect that it is not possible to derive a valid theory of development from demo- cratic prindples and practice. In other words, according to this logic of despair, demooacy does not admit of a theory of devel- opment. The burden of ibis study is that the type of reasoning noted above k neither logically warranted nor empirically justified. In the first place, there k no reason to assume that subnational loyalties arc necessarily inconsktent with national loyalty. Social divisions are not automatically translated into political cleavages. Even when some of them arc politically translated, there may be a wide variation in their direction, momentum, and conse- quences. Not all political cleavages are translated into open con- flicts, and when they are, such conflicts may promote integration rather than disintegration. The extent to which political groups and group conflicts may be channeled into integrative behavior Language Conflict and National Development 3 will depend on, among other things, the nature o£ the general decision-system in which they are made to operate. For example, if the political system in which they operate is based on a pluralist decision-system rather than an authoritarian decision-system, the probability of political integration will be higher. Integrative consequences of group conflict are likely to be greater in a politi- cal system where the distribution of cleavages is crosscutting and mutually offsetting, and rvhere plural divisions are likely to be accommodated in aggregative social and political organizations. Finally, certain positive factors of cohesion may achieve an over- arching dimension such that the scale of damaging conflict may not substantially disturb the foundations of the national com- munity. These points will be elaborated later. At this stage, it should be added that the empirical material required for the discussion of these points is derived from a study of language politics in India. The focus of this particular study is on the evolution of language loyalty in India and its political expression through voluntary associations devoted to the promotion of the interests of the respective language groups. The role of such language associa- tions in the formulation and implementation of national lan- guage policy is described in detail for the purpose of analyzing a concrete decision-area and the nature of the decision-system in- volved. The linkage points between the language groups and other groups, their mutual interaction and selective aggregation in the pluralist frame^vork, are described and analyzed. An at- tempt is made to trace the actual political consequences of such behavior on the national political community. Finally, an effort is made to relate the findings of the empirical investigation to the wider questions of democratic political development. Before tj^e discuss the substantive details of our investigation, we should explain some of the basic concepts and conceptual ar- rangements in particular theoretical contexts which we have utilized in the course of our study. This will enable us to define our tenns precisely and to place them in the context of the particular framework of analysis whhdi ive propose to use. 6 Language Conflict and Notional Development various combinations of the architectural and the organismic processes.* A proper concept of national development, therefore, should emphasize the interaction bcnvcen the act of deliberate building and the evolutionary growth of the social units leading to the successive stages of the integrtuion of a nation. Such a con- cept of national development puts a premium on the treatment of the nation as a dynamic process of integrating a plurality of social groups into a common frametvork of identity and lopity structured in a political community. Cohesion and Community The use of the concept of community in the analysis of na- tional development is not free from semantic ambiguities. His- torically, it has been used to refer to a svide range of cohesive arrangements, including, for example, the classical notions of polls and cosmopolis, the Hebrew and the Christian notions of the community of believen. and a variety of idealistic, utopian, romantic, totalitarian, and pluralistic rariations on thb theme.* Such wide rariaiions in the range of referents have made it dif- ficult to use this term in contemporary discussions without spec- ifying the particular meaning intended. In modem political science, the concept of the political community has been used in some cases as a \"practical concept,\" and in others as an \"analyti- cal concept.\"^ As a practical concept, its primary function is to guide action, to direct attitudes, and to state commitments. As an analytical concept, it is used to describe rarious possible cohesive arrangements. One popular analysis tends to identify the con- cept of political community with that of political system.* A care- *nus is elaborated by Karl Deutsch in Kation-DuUding. ed. Kail W. Deutsch and William J. Foltz, p. j. •For a discussion of the erolution of the notions of community, see Sheldon S. Wolin, Pohtics and rision, smd Robert A.

HI.: Northwestern Univeniry Press, 1958). pp. 305-J17. • In Karl Deutsch’s works the central focus is on the way in which groups Language Conflict and National Development 7 ful attempt to separate tliesc two concepts can be seen in the works of David Easton, whoxcservcs ilie concept of political com- munity \"for the special purpose of identifying one particular aspect of a political system, as one of a number of basic political objects toward whicli support may be extended, or from which it may be withdraum.\"* In Easton's use of the term political com- munity, the focus is on a group of persons who, for one reason or another, are joined together in a common enterprise. Easton implies that the way in which a common enterprise is conducted may s-ary with regard to the degree and the kind of cohesion that is brought to hear on the working of the community. The politi- cal community is bound by the primary tie of a political division of labor. Apart from this primary tie there is always the possi- bility of various degrees of affective solidarity sustaining the political community. But the degree of the affective ties \"will only be a possible characteristic of a political community, not an essential part of the meaning of the term.’’*® Tliough Easton's usage docs not tie the concept of political community exclusively to national political communities, his analysis has an important bearing on the understanding of na- tional development in heterogeneous societies.** It is worth not- ing that his usage is based on a clear distinction between the sociological concept of the social community and the political concept of political community. The sociological idea of com- munity is based on a paired set of ideal types introduced by Ferdinand Tonnics.*’ These types refer to two fundamental of people gradually form uniti lor die peaceful joJution of their problems. See his Political Community at the International Level (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1954), p. j6. In E. B. Haas the focus is on the loyalty of the specific groups and individuals to their central political institutions. See The Uniting of Europe (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1958), p. 5. ® David Easton, A Syslenu Analysis of Political Life, p. 176. p. 177. “ Easton identifies political systems at different levels of fndusiveness from parapolitical systems to international systems. See his A Framework for Political Analysis, pp. 23-58. >2 See his Cemeinschaft and Gesellsehafl, translated by C. P. Loomis under the title Community and Society (East Lansing, Michigan: Michigan State University Press, 1957). For a critical discussion, see Marion J. Levy. Jr.’s 8 Language Conflict and National Development fonns o£ human ^vill that undciHe two forms of social relation- ship. These types of wills are characterized as natural and as ra- tional wills. A social collectivity is characterized as a community insofar as its members think of the grouping as a gift of nature. Thb natural community is distingubhcd from the social collec- tivity that is based on rational will, in the sense that the indi- viduals involved wish to attain through it a definite end and are willing to join hands for this purpose. Such a social collectivity is referred to as a society, in the special sense of the term envisaged by Tonnies. In fact, the paired terms community and society refer to two forms of social relationship which in reality are often found to coexist in various proportions.** Their analytical sep- aration is intended to bring out sharply the instrumental and the affective ties governing social relations. By separating the concept of political community from the sociological sense of community, we can keep the question of the character of cohesion relatively open. In this way we can conceive of a political community independent of the question of natural solidarity of the members of the common political enterprise. This is especially important in analyzing national development in the new states bas^ on various kinds of segmentary diversity. Moreover, by postulating thb conceptual framework, it is possi- ble to arrive at a better understanding of the sequential develop- ment of various kinds of cohesion. Thus it b important to re- member Easton’s suggestion that “it b quite possible, . . . that in the formation of new societies and associated political systems, a sense of belonging together politically may normally follow rather than precede the emergence of a political community. If this is so, there could be little doubt that a political community is phenomenally independent, at least in its initiation, from the analysis in H. Eelsedn, ed., tnlemat War (New York: Free Press, 1964), pp. »33-a66. **’Fhe use of paired concepts to comprehend “natural\" and “rational\" forms of social relationship is not limited to the pair suggested by Tonnies. Witness, for example, the dualistk consttuaions suggested by Henry Maine in the form of status and contract soaeties, Durkheim’s mechanical and organic solidarities, Howard Becker’i sacred and secular societies, and Rob- ert Redfield’s folk and urban societies. Language Conflict and National Development g feelings of solidarity that are usually considered to be a major pre-condition.\"** This implies that the political integration of a nation can be considered separately from social, cultural, and other forms of integration that are subsumed under the general category of national integration. This is not to deny that these questions are related, but rather to suggest that an analytical separation of these dimensions of integration may yield a better insight into their mutual relations. Political Integration In discussing the concrete processes of political integration, most studies have concentrated on the problems of reducing cleavage, discord, and parochial loyalties facing the new states. The burden of these studies is that the way to integration lies through forcible subordination of the parochial groups under authoritarian rule. For example, Rupert Emerson suggests that the achievement of ordered societies in the West \"was in good part the product of the hrm authoritarian rule which bridged the transition from the Middle Ages to the contemporary world.\"** Accordingly, he states that the prime requirement of the new states is not for more freedoms, but for discipline; not for opposition, but for a national consolidation; and in countries with tribal, racial, or religious hostilities, be claims, \"the essen- tial need is strong and unified management.\"** For further evi- dence of this mood among social scientists, one can turn to the analysis of David Apter, who singles out the effect of cultural strain as one of the most important determinants of the future of new nations.** According to him, this creates a problem for the leadership groups of the new nations. Their political leadei^ are rebels against tradition. Their goals of progress require social mobilization, which in turn requires an organizational revolu- tion that offends the natural conservatism of the public. He con- H David Easton. Systems Analysis, p. l88. ** Rupert Emerson, From Empire to Nation, p. 289. p. 290. u See David E. Apter in Comparative Politics, cd. Harry Eckstein and David E. Apter, p. 649. 10 Language ConfUcl and National Development eludes that \"autocracy is thus intrinsic to a development situa- tion in whicli political entrepreneurship is the source of change and government its director.\"** Similarly, turning more specifi- cally to national devclopmcnl in India, commentators, both In- dian and Western, have stated that the cost of tlie survival of the nation may s’ery ivell result in a succession of stresses and strains, leading to a situation which is \"certain to overwhelm free insti- tutions.”** What is the basic source of these stresses and strains besetting national development in the new states? This source has usually been identified as the natural ties of the segmental groups to their own given order of existence. One study dratvs a sharp dis- tinction between the natural ties and the civil ties, or as they have been called, the primordial order and the civil order,*® partially reminiscent of the distinction made by some in political theory between the public realm and the realm of private and parochial attachments.** Specifically, primordial attachment has been de- scribed as one that stems from the \"givens\"— or more predsely . . . the assumed \"givens\"— o! sodal existence; immediate contiguity and kin connec- tion mainly, but beyond them the givenness that stems bom being bom into a particular religious community, speaking a particular language, or even a particular dialect o£ a language, and following particular sodal practices. These congmitics of blood, speech, custom and so on are seen lo have an ineffable and, at times, overpowering cohesiveness in and of themselves.** In contrast, the civil loyalties are revealed in classes, parties, and p. 654. ** Selig S.

Clifford Ceeru, p. log. Language Conflict and National Development 1 1 so forth. The range and intensity of the threats posed by the civil loyalties are supposed to be considerably less than their primor- dial counterparts. As Geertz puts it, civil loyalties rarely threat- en to undermine the nation itself, though they may challenge existing forms of government, whereas the primordial loyalties threaten partition, irredentism, or merger, and hence pose a new definition of the national domain.*® This, as we shall see later, is a tenuous assumption. Like all paired concepts, the primordial-civil dualism is only partially useful. It does not sensitize us to the complexity of these factors in reality. By looking at the origin of the social cleavage rather than examining it in the dynamic context of the social and political transformation, such a dualistic notion often tends to oversimplify the primordial in national development. So far as national development is concerned, the static distribution of the multiplicity of primordial groups is of less consequence than the dynamic processes of the political transformation of these groups through the existing political channels of negotiation, adjust- ment, and resolution of conflict.** Given this perspective of dy- namic interaction, it may be more useful to assume that the po- litical role of the multiple social groups cannot be automatically derived from their given bases of social existence. In the transitional politics of national development of the new states, the social bases of the primordial groups themselves tend to change in significant ways. The source of such changes may be found in the political factors. The political impact of a primor- dial group depends to a large extent on how a hitherto unpoliti- cized group has transformed itself into a significant politicized group. In other words, social segmentation by itself does not tell us much about the patterning of the social groups’ participation in politics and its consequences on political integration. The mode of participation depends on the definition of political in- terest of such groups, the style of their leadership, the nature of the political system in which the leaders act, and the methods of ^Ibid., p. iiJ. 2«See iUirl W. Deu«ch in Nation-Building, ed. Karl W. Deutsch and William J. Tohz, p. 6. 12 Language Conflict and National Development action which have been found in practice to gratify the demandi of the conflict groups. There b no reason to assume in advance that primordial groups, because of their natural origin, would stick to naturally defined rigid interests. On the contrary, it is conceivable that political prudence of the leaders of the primor- dial groups may very well make their definition of group interest flexible and amenable to adjustment. This is more likely to be the case when in the distribution of segmental groups no single group can overwhelm others and many of the groups may cut across each other.“ In general, it may be said that social divisions are of conse- quence to the study of national development to the extent tliat they are manifested as political divisions.** It is possible to dis- tinguish among various kinds and characteristics of political divisions.** Thus, political divisions may mean simply concrete policy disagreements. Or, political divisions may be related to cultural divergence of the social groups in a political community. A third type of political division may be related to segmental cleavage. In this case the divisions are not merely due to the dif- ferent cultural orientations of the actors involved; they are in addition related to the actors' attachments to their segmental groups. In studying the political divisions of a country one has to know the extensiveness of the salient divisions. It is not enou^ to know hmv many types of divisions exist in a country. One has to find out the nature of the divisive issues and the target of divisive politics. For example, a simple disagreement on a specific governmental policy reflects a less extensive division than does an uncompromising political division, which may in certain ** For a Bpedfic account o( the oomplwty ot conflict arising from seg- mented group itrurture, see Ridiard D. Lambert, \"Some Consequences ot Segmentation in India,” Economie Development and Cultural Change 12, no. 4 (July J964): 416-^14. ** It is important to note here that not all social divisions attain the toim of political divisions. **The following distinction of political divisions is treated in detail in Harry Eckstein. Drouion and Cohesion m Democracy: a study of Norway PP- S3-35- Language Conflict and National Development 13 cases threaten the existence of the political community itself. The intensity of political division must also be taken into ac- count. Political division in a country may be extensive, but it niay not develop great intensity, otving to less affective involve- ntent of the actors, to lesser degree of organization, or to many other factors. But in certain cases, the extensiveness and the in- tensity of division may coincide, and this cumulative effect when reinforced by violence may pose a greater threat to political community. Thus it is important to recognize the complex variety of di- visions, their variable characteristics, and the alternative possi- bilities of alignment of conflict-groups in order to assess their impact on political integration. Moreover, the divisions them- selves have to be balanced against the factors of cohesion. Politi- cal cohesion is often thought to be the result of a relative Jack of political divisions. Or it is sometimes suggested that political co- hesion can exist despite divisions, if not because of political di- visions.** In order to study contemporary problems of political integration the first of the possibilities of cohesion suggested above may not be very important, especially because of the nature of divisive materials involved in heterogeneous new states. But the two other possibilities of cohesion will be of great importance because of our assumption that political divisions do not neces- sarily hinder political integration. We are also assuming that even when these divisions fake the form of concrete political conflicts, these conflicts may prove to be a factor of positive socia- tion leading to a possibility of integration.*® But even if the con- flicts are not moderated by their mutually crosscutting nature and even if they are not mutually balanced, there may be parallel See ibid., p. 69. ^ For a detailed treatment of conJlict as a process of sociaubn, sec Georg SimmeJ, Conflict and ifie Web of Croup Affiliations, part r, chap, i (paper- back); Lewis Coser, The Functions of Social Confiict, esp. chap. 7 and 8 (paperback).

We hasTs already pointedout that for us the txmeepw of political integration and national integration refer to nvo analytically separable categories. Political integration, for the purpose of thb work, ivill be defined as the minimal cohesion necessary for the coordination of the political groups through the institutionalized procedures of the political community.** This minimal cohesion does not simply mean a lack of violence in the resolution of group conflict.** The institutionalization of group coordination through a pluralist decision-making system is of pritnary importance to the process of political integration that we svill study. Language and National Developmenl The impact that social divbions based on language have on political integration in muUUingual ne%v states may be appre- ciated better in the context noted above. Patterns of language divbion in multilingual societies vary iridely. In order to com- prehend a specific pattern, it b important to ccjusidcr, among other things, the number of language groups, their relative sire. **See Lewis A.

Of the media of communication, lan- guage is the most versatile. In analyring linguistic phenomena within the wider context of politics and society, the role of lan- guage in the speech communities and the relationships among these communities in the social and political environments are usually emphasized. By a speech community we mean “any hu- man aggregate characterized by regular and frequent interaction, by means of a shared body of verbal signs and set off from similar aggregates by significant differences in language use.’’** For social and political analysis, it may be convenient to distinguish the different elements that are subsumed under the category of lan- guage. Thus, one may speak of different standard codes (e.g., English, Chinese), regional variants within a single code (e.g., the casual conversational English of Boston), social class variants of a particular regional variant, stylistic vanants related to levels of formality and so forth.” Most major languages have such in- ternal variations revealed in the standard form and the dialectal divisions, and stratifying as well as stylistic variants.

But the political affirmation of language lo^’alty and the political manifestation of language rix-alry have assumed salience in a relatively recent period of history. The invention of print- ing, the spread of education to the middle and lower classes. Humanism and the Reformation, and the increasing participa- tion of the general population in national politics have been some of the decisive factors in the pbcing of a premium on lan- guage loyalty and its expression in the politics of nationalism.** These developments in the European scene gradually penuaded some Romantic thinlen to believe that language is the most im- portant identifying characteristic of peoples and therefore it should be the ob\\'ious criterion of national political boundaries.** Modem scholars prefer to discount such simplistic notions, and they take into account the vast complexities in the relationship bettveen language and political community. l^guage is not a static factor. Although language loyalty has often been characterized as a primordial loyalty, when the dy- namic development of language is considered, it vill be found that language loyalty is a variable, dependent at times on impor- tant political factors. One author has aptly pointed out: The linguistic divisions among the Romance languages today reflect the dynastic boundaries of the tenth to eighteenth centuries. The re- vival of Gaelic was the consequence, not the cause of Irish discontent •with British rule. The Landsmaal movement in Norway emphasized the non-Danish elements of the vernacular to reinforce the earlier political separation &om Denmark, and the attempt to ‘‘purify” Turkish from Arabic elements became official policy after military defeat had severed the Arab parts from the T urkish state.** ** See R.

Language Conflict and National Development 17 The idea of a natural speech of a people occasionally proves to be extremely tenuous. Many of the ancestors of the people using French as their native tongue once spoke Latin or one of the Celtic or Teutonic languages, and many an ancestor of those who now speak English on both sides of the Atlantic once spoke very different languages. All modem languages can be traced to their respective origins, but as Boyd Shafer remarks, none sprang into being all at once, and in some tvays all are medleys built upon older languages, which in turn are derived from still older languages.** The myth of a natural tongue is also undermined by the fact that often various conquerors and rulers have relied on force or threat of violence or material sanctions to impose lan- guages upon peoples. Both in Europe and elsewhere the transformation of tradi- tional societies into modem political communities has been ac- companied by corresponding linguistic modernization. Many political scholars have tended to overlook the phenomenon of linguistic modernization and have preferred to describe the linguistic scene primarily in terms of intergroup phenomena, neglecting at the same time the intragroup interactions and transformations. One imporunt feature of the traditional so- cieties is that they show extremes of internal linguistic diversity in the sense that, in such societies, administration, religious affairs, literary activity, and ordinary communication tend to be carried on in different languages. Thus, in a traditional society, classical or foreign languages may be employed for administra- tion and religious affairs, whereas the local populations generally speak a variety of unofficial and sometimes unwritten languages or local dialects. Low literacy and the considerable efforts needed for language training tend to favor polarization of power in a small elite, and internal linguistic diversity symbolizes extremes of social and political stratification.** With the advancement see his/f World of Nations (Washington, D.C; Brookings Institution, 1967), p. 48. *2 Boyd C. Shafer, Nationalism, Atyth and Reality, p. 49. See also Leon Dominian, The Frontiers of Language and Nationality in Europe. Cf. John J. Gumperz, “Linguistic Indices in the Study of Moderniza- tion.\" Berkeley: University of Califoniia, May 1964 (mimeo). i8 Language Conflict and National Development toward modernity, the gap between the literary language ^nd the popular native tongues tends to be reduced. Standardization of language advances, and with increasing literacy such standard languages become more accessible and the distance bettveen the variants svithin the language gradually diminishes. In Europe, the processes of linguistic modernization follotvcd from about the eleventh to the nineteenth century, and similar processes can be detected in the contemporary modernizing stages of Asia and Africa. Karl Deutsch shots’s that, by the end of the eighteenth century, the classical languages of Europe had been replaced by thirty modem standard languages.** He detects two trends in such developments: the creation of new standard languages from a locally current dialect or from that of a neigh- boring city or from a commonly employed trade language, and the assimilation of other existing dialects or tribal languages and their replacement by the netrly ruing standard languages. Such processes were evidently facilitated and expedited by social mobilization and political itansformation.** As more and more people broke ats-ay from the old ways of their relatively isolated edstence and restructured themselves in new economic patterns, in dynamic status systems, and in participative political frame- works, they needed more elHdent media of communication. Thus tras the ground prepared for the emergence olsundard languages and a decrease in the distance between the variants of the same language.

But one common feature that stands out is the positive role played by developing national- ism, which consciously promoted the standardization of the major vernacular languages in Europe.^® The new standard lan- guages destroyed the dominance of the classical languages, and in this process the linguistic unity of the European elite was sacrificed in favor of building a bridge of communication be- tween the elite and the masses within each national political community. Language in the Developing Areas If political factors have played an important role in the devel- opment of national languages in many areas of Europe— and with an extraordinary intensity between 1900 and 1937— they have assumed a still greater importance in the multilingual new states of Asia and Africa since the Second World War. The importance of language for the people of these states can be ascertained from the fact that language often serves as one of the most important symbols of identification and distinction.®^ However, the politi- cal importance of language varies to a certain extent with the differences in the multilingual pattern that can be discerned in these states. Roughly, the multilingual situation of these states can be classified into several broad patterns.®* In the first place, **See Einar Haugen, language Conflict and Language Planning, esp. pp. 5-14. In this process, at times, leading individuals like Machiavclli and Lutlier played prominent roles. But their chief importance lay in the fact that they gave a necessary impetus to what was already moving.

On the general problem of classifying multi- 20 Language Conflict and Natioftal Development a \\-ariety of closely related languages may coexist, with one of them being accorded the status of a lingua franca. This type of situation can be found in Indonesia. Or there may exist a num- ber of languages not closely related, of ssrhich only one has a long literary tradition, such as can be found in Morocco, for example. Or there may be a variety of unrelated languages, no one of which can rlai-m a long literary tradition. This is the situation in many parts of tropical Africa. Finally, there are situations where a variety of languages may exist, each with its substantial literary tradition. This situation can be found in India, Pakis- un, Ceylon, and Malaysia. In the first and second types of situa- tion, the multiplicity of languages is not likely to pose major political problems. In the third and fourth types, the lack of an assured dominance of a single language tends to generate lan- guage risalry expressed in political forms. Though language diversity has existed in these areas for a long time, only after the rise of political mobilization has it given rise to a political problem. In many of these areas, open language conflict became acute immediately following national independence. Under colonial regimes, the imposition of the colonial language as the dominant language often helped to keep these language rivalries latent, at least temporarily.** But after independence, the question of the replacement of colonial lan- guage by indigenous languages tended to bring language ris'al- ries into the open, especially where the Indigenous languages svere claimed to be competent to replace colonial languages.** The question of replacing the alien language by a national lan- guage inrariably became a matter of prestige, related as it is to the svider question of removing the symbols of former alien domination. But once the alien rulers svere gone, it svas im- portant for the new rulers to balance the matter of prestige svith lingual situations, see ^VllliaIB A. Stuart. “An Outline of Linguistic Typolo- gy for Describing Mu1(iUngualisin“ in of the Role of Second Lan- guages in Asia, Africa, and Latin Amenca, ed. Frank A.

Language Confltct end National Development 21 the substantial interests of the major language groups within the multilingual new states. The problem was further complicated by the fact that the national langtjage question had to be considered in the perspcc* tive of the growth of literacy, the expansion of education, and the extension of communication that accompanied modemiza* tion. Once massive educational expansion is planned, it becomes almost impossible for these nesv states to educate vast numbers of people through the medium of one or more colonial lan- guages. At this stage, it may seem to be inevitable to conduct the extension of education in the language of the people concerned.** In this context, the recommendation of a meeting of experts of UNESCO is worth noting. It points out that “the use of the mother tongue be extended to as late a stage in education as possible. In particular pupils should begin their schooling through the medium of the mother tongue, because they under- stand it best and because to begin their school life in the mother tongue will make the break between home and school as small as possible.\"** It is true that the task of replacing the former colonial lan- guages by national Iangu.ages is not easy. In most cases, the latter have been generally too unprepared to allow an easy changeover. Moreover, in a multilingual ne%v state the choice of one national language tends to generate interne language rivalry, espedalJy in those situations where it is difTicult to assess the dominance- qualitative and quantitative— of one single language. The choice of a national language involves so many political problems that convenience, rationality, and efficiency are not necessarily the decisive criteria. In this sense, the problems of language policy have to be considered more from the political perspective than from a predominantly technical viewpoint. The complexity of the political problems of national language policy may be indi- cated by a brief consideration of some concrete cases. **See ibid., p. 136. ** The Use of Vernacular Languages in Education, Paris, UNESCO, 1953. pp. 47-48.

Language Conflict and Nelional Development Variations in National Language Policy The role of deliberate political efforts in shaping a national language and promoting its development becomes clear when one considers the evolution of the national language policy in Indonesia. Some two hundred and fifty languages and dialects grew up in Indonesia over the past centuries. Out of a population of nearly a hundred million, Javanese is spolcen as the motlier tongue by some forty million people.** Other languages, like Sudanese, Madurese, and Balinese, are spoken by numbers which do not effectively challenge the dominant position of Javanese. Yet, confronted by a question of choosing a national language, the Indonesian political elite created Bahasa Indonesia as the new national language and imposed it effectively on the hetero- geneous population. Tim language is based on Malay, which is the native tongue of a small minority of the population (roughly six million). Several factors contributed to the choice of this new language and the success of iu acceptance— some of which are unique to the Indonesian situation. Being an easy language to learn and containing few implications of social superiority— unlike Javanese— the case for Malay was a strong one. Since no competing regional language of major strength tvas elevated to a favored position, the ground for language rivalry was weak- ened. And when the Japanese landed in Indonesia in 1942, they immediately attempted to suppress the Dutch language— until then the official language— and for necessary communication they were obliged to use Malay only.** In this way Malay became the language of official use, public law, and educational establish- ments. This paved the way for the rising consciousness that Malay, or “the Indonesian language,*’ was the symbol of na- tional unity. Although as early as 1926 some nationalist leaders had been propagating the case for sudi a language as a symbol of ** See S. Takdir AHsjahbana, “The Indonesian Language— By-Product of Nationalism,\" Pacific Afjairt is (1949): 388-59*. and Ben Anderson, \"The Languages of Indonesian Politics.\" /ndonMta, no. i (April 1966): 89-116. **See Takdir Alisjahbana, Indonesian Language and Literature: Two Essays, p. ag. Language Conflict and National Development 23 national integration, it was the brief Japanese occupation which gave it a unique impetus, and when the provisional constitution during the revolution raised “Indonesian” to the rank of of- ficial language, they were no longer announcing an objective— they were confirming a fact. Since the consolidation of new Indonesia the same official language has continued and has al- ready made its mark as an interesting experiment in language planning carried out through political initiative and authority. A contrasting picture of extreme linguistic variety and the consequent difficulty in replacing the colonial languages can be seen in Africa, south of the Sahara. In this part of Africa there are nearly eight hundred distinct tongues and innumerable dia- lects.\" None of these is spoken by a significant majority in any political community. Where Swahili and Hausa are used widely, no more than 8 percent of the population is involved. Most of these languages have no svriiten form, and only a few, like Swa- hili, Hausa, Yoruba, Luganda, may claim a limited literary tradition. Political deliberations at the parliamentary level are mostly conducted in foreign languages, whereas political dia- logue away from the center is conducted in the indigenous lan- guages. When in Northern Rhodesia indigenous languages had to be used in the parliamentary elections in 1962, six languages were used in the polling. Not even all the candidates understood the linguistic difficulties arising out of three different electoral rolls and the mass of linguistic hurdles inherent in such a situa- tion.\" In Ghana alone, for nearly six and a half million people, there are about a hundred tongues, of which, excepting Tsvi, Dagari, Ewe, and a few others, none is used by sizeable groups. Hausa is current as a lingua Cianca in some areas only. The only common language of expression used by the educated minority is English. Nearly the same situation prevails elsewhere in tropi- 5® For general discussions on various aspects o! language policy in Africa, see Language in Africa, ed. John Spencer, esp. chaps. 3, 8, and is.

As a result, the former colonial languages are still dominant in the sphere of politics.” However, the logic of na- tional authenticity is likely to impel the leaders of the coming generations to elevate some of the vernaculars to literary and political status. A more complicated and potentially more explosive linguistic situation can be observed in South Asia. The choice of a na- tional language in India is complicated by the fact that no one language can claim an ovenvhelming dominance over the others. In addition, about ten languages that are regionally salient and numerically important have distinct literary heritages. This situation has some parallels in Pakistan, Ceylon, and, to take a case from another part of Asia, Malaysia. Linguistic and religious divisions, however, tend to coincide in the cases of Ceylon and Malaysia, while in India and Pakistan this b not ahvays so~-here liguistic allegiance very often cuu across religious groups. In Ceylon before independence, nearly 6i percent of the popula- tion spoke Sinhalese, while the nearest rival lingubtic group was the Tamil-speaking group covering about 23 percent of the pop- ulation. The majority of the former are Buddhists while that of the latter are Hindus. The Official Language Act of 1956 pro- claimed Sinhalese to be the official language of Ceylon. The status of Sinhalese as the sole official language vras resented by the supporters of English and more particularly by the Tamil speak- ers. The latter demanded special official recognition tor their language, and this demand ivas sponsored by their osvn political party, the Federal party. The problem of language politics in Ceylon was complicated by the fact that around 1956, the lin- gubtic, the religious, and the party cleavages svere found to coin- cide. The party of composite nationalbm, the United National party, was at that time extremely weakened by the bipolar crystal- lization of these cumulated cleavages. In 1 958, the confrontation of these bipolar forces exploded into massive violence. It should be noted, however, that the cumulation of the cleavages did not prove to be permanent. Thus, in 1965 the United National party Jacob Omsiein, \"Paticms of Language Planning in the New States,\" World Politics 17, no. 1 (October 1964): 40-49. Language Conflict and National Development 25 was able to reassert its power by forming a coalition of interests cutting across the bipolar cleavages. It has since tried to reverse the extremes of Buddhist and Sinhalese policies and has found a workable measure of accommodation among the Sinhalese and the Tamil language interests.®* A complicating [actor in the Ceylonese language rivalry lies in the fact that the Tamil speech community is culturally linked with its counterpart in South India. This linkage gives rise to a political suspicion on the part of the Sinhalese community con- cerning the political implications of extraterritorial cultural loyalty. A similar factor complicates the language politics in Malaysia. The population of the Federation of Malaya, accord- ing to the 1957 census report, rvas composed of Malays with a share of 50 percent, the Chinese with 37 percent, and the Indians with la percent. These communities are predominantly Malay, Chinese, and Tamil speaking. Each of these communities has its otvn distinctive culture and tradition. With a marginal majority, Malay nationalists are constantly haunted by a feeling that the allegiance of the Chinese and the Indians to a composite Ma- layan nationalism is not too strong. The cultural linl^ge of the Chinese and the Indians with China and India is perceived by the Malayas as being detrimental to the growth of Malaysian na- tionalism.** See Robert N.

In 1967 the Malaysian Parliament passed llie National Language Act svith the intention of implementing the changeover. The demand for Malay as the sole official language has ahoj-s evoked strong re- sentment from the well-organiicd Chinese community. But language rivalry in Malaysia has been tempered considerably by the compromising attitudes of the leaders of the coalition— the Alliance pany— who were more interested in putting up a joint front against Indonesia than in hardening language conJlict at home. It is this external challenge joined svith the internal poli- tics of compromise that has taken the violent edge out of Ma- bysian language rivalry. The National Language Act of 1967 signifies an attempted symbolic gratification of the Malay lan- guage demands more than a frantic hardening of the official stand on language. In general, tlie official attitude to thenon-Malay lan- guages including English has been one more of persuasive ad- justment than of deliberate suppression.** Both in Ceylon and Malaysia, religious and language divisions generally tend to coincide. But in Pakbtan language divisions cut across religious affiliations. Before the formation of Pakistan the leaders of the Pakistan niosement used Urdu as a S)Tnbol of Muslim separatism. But the symbolic capability of Urdu as a factor of Muslim unity began to decline after the formation of Pakistan.

For instance, the symbolic capability of the Bengali and Pushto languages to unite the Bengalis and the Pathans re- spectively and to confer a sense of Identity on them was not ap- preciated by these leaders during the earlier years of Pakistan's formation.** These leaders accordingly declared that Urdu alone would be the official language of Pakistan.*^ It should be noted that Bengali is spoken by the largest number of Pakistanis, whereas Urdu is the native speech of only about 4 percent of the total Pakistani population.\" Even in ^Vest Pakistan, Urdu cannot claim to be a major re- gional language. The greatest challenge to the Urdu policy of the central leadership came from the Bengali speakers. They initiated large-scale popular agitations in February 1952 in favor of making Bengali an ofTicial language in addition to Urdu, The result tvas violent suppression, which in its turn led to a wave of protest and indignation from all over East Pakistan.** Ultimately, the Bengali movement succeeded in its aim, and the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan recognized both Urdu and Bengali as official languages. **For die leaders’ auitudes. see Chaudhri Afuhaminad Ali, TAe Emerg- ence of Pakistan (New YorV.: Columbia Univeniiy Press, 1967), pp. For linguistic regionalism in Pakistan, see A.

Mean- while, the leaders of East Pakistan, who had accepted the unique status of Urdu before the fonmtion of Pakistan, have not shotvn any eagerness to popularize Urdu in East Pakistan. Various non- Urdu language communities in West Pakistan have shown a willingness to learn Urdu as a second language.** But the East Pakistanis have not reconciled themselves to such a policy. The linguistic distance between East and ^Vest Pakistan has there- fore tended to increase.** However, all the leaders of Pakistan have shown a tendency to continue to use English as the operative language of official transaction. The first constitution of Pakistan (*956) had declared that English should be used for official pur- poses for twenty years. Subsequent changes in the regime have not disturbed the status of English. Because of the general re- luctance of the leaden of Pakistan to dislodge English from offi- cial communiatioos, the mutual lingubtic incomprehensibility between Urdu and Bengali has not substantially affected national cransactions.

The problems of language planning and the impact of such planning on the national political life as well as on the social structure of the language communities will be analyzed. Lan- guage politics has usually been considered mainly at the level of inteigroup rivalry. We will try to bring out the intragroup as well as the intergroup consequences of language planning and development. Finally, our purpose will be to relate the role of language politics to the broader questions of political integration and political development.®^ We will specifically consider the impact ofassociational language politics on the democratic modes of political integration. This will involve a study of the contribu- tion of associational language poUtits to the institutionalization of the pluralistic decision-making s)^tem sustaining the political community. It should be made clear that we will discuss primarily the lan- guage politics related to the national language policy-making processes.

This notion is useful for our analysis of political development in India. Language Conflict and National Development brought in only insofar as they are related to our primary con- cern. Hence, the problems o£ the linguistic reorganization of states will generally be left out of our account.” Because of the obvious importance of the politics of Hindi language policy, the major part of our materials will be dratvn from North India, and in our discussion of the language associations the North Indian associations will occupy our major attention. In the course of analyzing our materials, this study will utilize the appropriate theoretical svorhs developed in several fields, including compara- tive politics, political sociology, political theory, and socio- linguistics. The primary theoretical perspective of this study will be drawn from the corpus of contemporary political science. ** These have been discussed in Joan V.

II The Language Situation in India Scholarly interest in language in India is reflected in ancient literary and philosophical svritings. Many such svorks have been credited with detailed linguistic obser\\-ation, classification, and analysis in philological and philosophical terms.’ None of these works, however, throws any light on the social consequences of the linguistic diversity in India. It is perltaps natural that the Indian literati have been traditionally more concerned with their ingroup communication than with intergroup communi- cation.* For information about linguistic diversity in India one finds it more profimbic to turn to early Muslim commentators.* Such information dates back to the fourteenth century. These observations were by no means systematic studies of the linguis- tic diversity existing at that time. They were mostly impression- s For some contemporary tV’csiern evaluations of such works, see Otto jespersen, Language (London: Allen and Unwin, ig**). p- lo, for a linpiitt’s approach: A. L.

Thus the accounts left by such commentaries give us little more than a rough, and often confusing, listing of the names of diverse languages. A better inventory of information tends to emerge from the European commentators’ efforts in the seventeenth century and later. In part this enterprise svas due to the early European trav- elers' curiosity about communications- But to a large extent it was due to the commercial and religious needs of a nesv breed of men intent on exploring an exotic land of multiple speech- communities. A more systematic inquiry began svhen William Jones introduced Sanskrit as a serious object of comparative lin- guistic study. The efforts of William Jones and Frani Bopp opened up new channels of inquiry Into Indian languages, their connection svith the languages of Europe, and the relationship between the literary and the popular languages of India. Scholars working through the Asian Society, missionary organizations, and adminbtrative institutions carried on this kind of inquiry to further success. During the nineteenth century linguistic con- trovenies related to educational modernization produced useful information about the development of the Indian languages. The svork svhich the defenders of classical languages, vemacu- lan, and English directed toward the question of the medium of instruction svas of a high order, and it proved to be of consider- able s'alue for an understanding of some of the crucial aspects of the language situation in India.* Systematic studies of the language situation in India, however, date back to 1881 when the recording of the mother tongue of individuals was undertaken by the Indian census of 1881. This l^•as followed by the most deuiled account of Indian languages and their sophisticated analysis, prepared by George Grierson in his monumental study published in nineteen %’olumes from 1903 * For a hrtel tumtnaTy ol these debates see S.

The Language Situation in India 33 to 1928.® The impact of this work is reflected in almost ail subse- quent studies on the language situation in India, including the first detailed tabulation of language data produced after inde- pendence by the Census of India in 1961. Grierson’s study discovered the existence of 179 languages and 544 dialects in undivided India. According to the Census of In- dia in 1951, there were a total of 845 languages or dialects spoken in India. The igGi Census of India mentions 1,652 \"mother tongues,” of which 103 were foreign mother-tongues. These are spoken by 439 million people inhabiting a country roughly the size of Europe without Russia, with an area of approximately ifi78,995 square miles. Of these 1,652 mother tongues, the 1961 census authorities found it difficult to classify 527 of them. The number of speakers involved in some cases is as small as tu'o or even one.® In fact, 87 percent of the total Indian population has been classified by the census of 1961 as speakers of the fourteen major languages specified in the original Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India, and English. The major literary languages in India are Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kash- miri, Malayalam, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sindhi, Ta- mil, Tclugu, and Urdu, together with English and Sanskrit, which have a special place. Of these, English, Sindhi, and Nepali were not included in the original Eigluh Schedule. Sindhi was included in 1967. The most numerous linguistic family in India is the Indo-Aryan, with 574 mother tongues and accounting for about 73 percent of the total population.^ Then follows the Dra- vidian family, accounting for more than 24 percent of the Indian population and including 153 mother tongues, covering the four literary languages of South India.® Numerically less significant are the TibetoChinese family and the Austric family of lan- *C.A.

Most political studies of multilingual politics have taken into account the number of speakers of particular languages as the basic datum. The percentages of the population referring to mother tongue, though important, do not reveal very much about the language situation and its effect on social communication. De- tailed data regarding the number of bilinguals in the popula- tion, the degree of control over languages used in addition to the mother tongue, the relationship between such languages, and other such specifications are important markers of the language situation. It is more important, hosvever. to gather materials on \"when and under what circumstaDces each language is used and what the attitudes of the people are tou^rd the isvo languages.”” When w’e have such materiaU. it will be possible for us to evalu- ate the signiGcance of the languages used in a multilingual situa- tion. The available data on bilingualism in India does not allow us to take into account all such dimensions of inquiry. The data we has’e, however, res cals some important features. Onesuch feature is that although India is commonly referred to as multilingual because of the great diversity of langtiages— svhich is a fact— the people of India, in one important sense, are mostly monolingual. Thus, out of 439 million people, only 30 million, as revealed in the 1961 census, can be said to be bilingual, with the reservation that the actual number of persons ha\\*ing the ability to read, r\\Tite, and speak trvo languages with fluency and efficiency is • For dassifitation by familin, see C«uim of India, i$6i, pp. dxv E.

The Language Situation in India 35 ewn less.*® The definition of bilingualism adopted by the ig6i census authorities is based on the knotvledge a person has of any language, Indian or foreign, in addition to his mother tongue. In reccWing the second language, care was taken to exclude dialects of th\\ same mother tongue.“ The census procedure was obvious- ly toosimplified, for it does not enable us to inquire into the switchVtg of codes between the literary language and the every- day sp^en dialect that seems to be a universal feature in most sectors Indian communication.** It is therefore worth noting that the ^^rious ranges of bilingualism within monolingual com- munities, ynd also the complexities of the social use of bilingual- ism, cann^ be determined from the elementary data presented in the igGi^ensus. Granting \\he limited nature of the census data, it is important to note that ftwer than 7 percent of the total population know an Indian langutge other than their mother tongue. The choice of a second language reveals interesting patterns. Thus, although nearly 223,000 Returned English as their mother tongue, more than eleven mllhpn people returned as knowing English. In fact, English is the mcst widely known second language in India, fol- lowed by Hindi, covering a little more than nine million second- language speakers. The comparison in terms of numbers is not an adequate indication of the relative importance of these two second languages in the social and political life in India. In most cases, Hindi or -any other regional language in India is acquired and used as a second language only when facile communication is desirable in business or social transactions rvherever such lan- guages are predominant.** Since these languages are predomi- nant only in certain areas in India, to that extent the use of Hindi as a second language, for example, tends to be regionally and transactionally limited. The use of English as a second language *2 For data on bilingualism see Cemtu of India, 1961, pp. 437-517. “Jfc/rf.. p.457. See John J.

In this sense, the circumstmces in which English as a second language is used, and the popilar atti- tudes to it, differ very widely from those governing tie use of Hindi or any other second language in India. National and Official Language Given the facts of the language situation in Indii, it appears that the principal languages to be reckoned t?ilh ir a discussion of the political consequences of the language problem are some ttvelve regional languages which cover fairly speciic areas of the country. Though most of these languages have affnity in varying degrees among themselves, a conspicuous rivaln for recognition at various levels of political and social life has claracterized their interrelations in recent Indian history. In addition, their rela- tionship to English poses another dimension of language rivalry in India. The framers of the Indian constitution, in their eager- ness to have one official language for the entire nation, provided fresh grounds for intense rivalry among the language groups when they chose Hindi as the official language of India. This is not to say that language rivalry had its beginning in independent India. As we will see later, this rivalry is much older. The fram- ing of the Indian constitution and the politics of its implemen- tation provided, rather, a new framework for the organization of the old rivalry in new channels. If the framers of the Constitution of India took care to choose one single \"official language,*’ the status of this category has not always come out clearly in the political and social deliberations in India. A good deal of semantic confusion has persisted from the very first demands for national language during the early phase of nationalist struggle. It is not surprising that such de- mands were basically related to nationalist aspirations colored Tke Language Silualion in India 37 by^a simplicity of conviction characteristic of nationalist politics betore independence. A lack of appreciation of the complexity govWing the question of a national language in a multilingual soci^y can be discerned in the speeches and tvritings of the leadeVs and intellectuals during this phase of Indian nationalism. Thes^eaders rarely dre^v a distinction between the categories of commto language, national language, and official language. They t^ded to use these as interchangeable categories. Gandhi, the most'^ardent proponent of a national language policy during the national movement, advocated the acceptance of Hindustani as the \"coinmon language.” For Nehru, the same language ap- peared as the “all-India language.” For C. Rajagopalachari, it became the “national language.” For Gandhi the basic concern was to find a common symbol for India as a single nation. Nehru, ho^vever, perceived the all-India language as approximating an official language, as well as an interregional link language.” Though the distinction between these demands was significant, there was no attempt to clarify this significance. Perhaps this was of relatively less consequence as long as the political excitement of the negative phase of the national movement dominated the scene. With the assumption of the rcsponsiblity for formulating an official language of an independent nation, it became imperative to use such categories with a greater sense of caution. For analyti- cal convenience, it may be suggested, then, an official language should imply an accepted language of administration as well as a means of communication between the government and the governed.*^ Such an official language may or may not be the same as the diplomatic language used for external relations. It is neces- sary to interpret the notion of a common language in a much wider sense than irhat is implied in the narrower category of offi- cial language. Common language should stand for a generally For the views of Gandhi, Nehru. Rajagopalachari, and othen during the national mosemcnt, see Z. A.

Sec The Use of Vernacular Languages in Education, p. 46 . jS Language Conflict andNational Development comprehensible code of communication used tliroughout the na- tion, It is conceisable that the Gtmmon language may not be co- extensive with the national language. In fact, in a multilingual society there may be a plurality of national languages. The niter- ion of a national language may lie io its being the natural speech of a major linguistic community for which the members of the group nurture a primordial affection.” Given these analytical distinctions.'® it is possible to describe a political conmunity tvherc the official language may not be a common language, just as several national languages can exist and be recognited within such a political community without all or most of them being designated as official languages. In Switzerland, for example, Ger- man, French, Italian, and Romanche have been designated as na- tional languages. Only the first three have the statiu of official languages of the federal system, and none of them can claim to be the common langtiage of Swittetland. It is of course possible to create deliberately or to accept a common language in a multi- lingual society by means of a conscious language policy. Hebrew in Israel and Bahasa Indonesia in Indonesia are examples of such deliberate efforts to create a common language. The provisions <A the Indian constitution regarding language explicitly avoided the notion of common or national language. But the pronouncements of the Indian leaders have not avoided the terms. Many ministers have referred to Hindi as \"the na- tional language.\"** The official report of the Committee on Emo- tional Iniegraiion refers to all the fourteen languages listed in the original Eighth Schedule of the Constitution as having the \"status of national languages,\"*' although the report of the Offi- '* Here the term pritnordiai ij used la the sense in uhich Edward Shil* and difiord Gecm distlnguidi between civil and primordial ties.

This confusion in terminology indicates an important feature of the language problem in India. From the very beginning of the spread of modem education in India the nationally oriented intellectuals have been groping for a means of communication among the various regions and language communities in India. Many of them looked to the past fora possible answer. The re- vival of interest in Sanskrit convinced some intellectuals in the nineteenth century that Sanskrit might be the answer. Most of these intellectuals, however, were persuaded of the limited use- fulness of Sanskrit as a common medium of modem communica- tion. They were aware that Sanskrit was historically the language of one section of the Hindu literati. The status of Sanskrit was mostly confined to higher literature and some of the religious practices of the Hindus. By the time of the Buddha the masses spoke languages that were referred to as Prakrits, %vhich were supposed to be \"low” forms.** The story of the development of 22it.OX.C., p. 2 a. ** See Jawaharla!

Except for the language of the literati, conGned to a very small proportion of the population, tlierc ss'as no common language of the people, who were politically dirided and culturally fragmented as well as socially confined to very re- stricted frontiers of communication. During the Muslim rule the official status of Persian failed to attain the status of a common language. During the British rule, for the first time in Indian history, one single language provided a medium of communica- tion across the entire subcontinent. Thus, English “gradually came to supersede the Indian bnguages in the work, activities and thought processes of the higher intelligentsia of all the lin- guistic regions,\"** and served as a link among all the educated people of the country . Jnlroduclion and Limilattons of English The history of the introduction of English dales back to the earlier decada of the nineteenth century. Initially it tvas associ- ated with the evangelical zeal of the missionaries of various Christian denominatloiu. The East India Company furthered this process in association with the British Parliament by trying to maintain schools for Indians.** The introduction of English as the medium of instruction was also facilitated by the consdous efforts of some Indian leaders who were eager to utilize English education in modernizing their countrymen.** The Charter Act of 1813 signified the beginning of the East India Company’s re- p.

There was no planning for the realization of these objectives, and as a result the policy- making processes were marked by ad hoc measures and ama- teurish adjustments. This was expected, since the administrators of this time had neither the expertise nor the experience neces- sary to plan the role of tlte state in promoting education. State planning in education did not exist in England at this time, and the lack of a precedent at home evidently puzzled the officials in India. During this confusing period of transition, the question of the medium of instruction raised intense controversies among die officials. One school of thought among the officials, with a strong base in Bengal, advocated the encouragement of oriental lan- guages like Sanskrit and Arabic.** A second school, mainly based in Bombay, ss-anted to promote the modem Indian languages as the media of eduaiion.” Tlie strongest group, however, was in favor of English as the language of instruction.** Indians them- selves svere iindedded about these proposed ahemadves. Con- setvative Indians were, of coune, on the side of the classical ori- ental languages. The few modernized leaders emerging about this time were divided in their relative emphasis on English and the vernacular languages. In Bengal, Rammohun Roy opposed the investment of state funds in oriental education. He wanted to see the state funds **See, for example, H. T.

Jagan- nath Shankarset wrote : \"If our object is to diffuse knowledge and improve the minds of the natives of India as a people, it is my opinion that it must be done by imparting that knowledge to them in their own language. ... I am far from wishing to discourage the study of English, but I believe it to be beyond the reach of the masses of people” (p. 17). at The opinion of this group was embodied in its sharpest form in Macaulay’s Xtinuie of February x, 1835 reproduced in defections from Edu- cational Records. part 1, pp. 107—117. 48 Language Conflict and National Development that were allocated for education used mainly in the promotion of modem higher education.** He formulated plans to establish educational institutions for the instruction of the youth in the science and literature of Europe.** This was the basis for the foundation of the Hindu College, later knosm as the Presidency College of Calcutu. Rammohun Roy himself started an English school in 1816 for the free instruction of students and collected funds for its maintenance. In a letter to Lord Amherst in 1823, Rammohun Roy pointed out that the Sanskrit system of educa- tion would keep the country in darkness. This letter was not the only reflection of the grooving demand for M^estem education in English language. In 1833 a prominent newspaper of Calcutta regretted that the British government paid no heed to the vietvs of the newspapers that demanded English education.” In princi- ple, the demand for English education was not opposed to ver- nacular education. Rammohun Roy, for example, believed that English education would be an important step toward the mod- ernization of Indian languages. His osvn tvork is impressive evi- dence for this point; in addition to being the pioneer of social Tcform, he is regarded as the father of modem Bengali prose.** The language debate in the Presidency of Bombay followed another direction.* Here the predominant emphasis svas on ver- nacular education. During Monistuart Elphinstone’s adminis- tration (1819-1827), the investment of public funds for vernacu- lar education in schools had shoivn encouraging results. The **See S. C. Chakiavaiti, ei.
