Let's master the fundamentals with Hari Chandrasekhar, VP Engineering Core at Sedai. In this insightful video, Hari provides a rapid fire primer on CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, and GitOps - an essential foundation for understanding how autonomous systems take IaC to the next level, a topic we'll be discussing in the coming days. Here are the key takeaways: 🔄 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 (𝗖𝗜/𝗖𝗗) Hari defines CI/CD as a method to frequently deliver applications by automating various stages of development. This approach has become a cornerstone of modern software practices. Popular CI/CD tools: 🔹 Jenkins 🔹 Argo 🔹 CircleCI 🔹 GitLab CI/CD Benefits of CI/CD: 🔹 Reduced manual errors 🔹 Decreased lead times 🔹 Faster release rates 🏗️ 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗿𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝘀 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 (𝗜𝗮𝗖): 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗿𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 Building on CI/CD principles,IaC involves describing and managing infrastructure components using code-based configuration files. A core IaC concept is to define \"What It Should Be\" (WISB) as code, replacing manual processes with programmatic approaches. Some popular IaC tools: 🔹 Terraform 🔹 Ansible 🔹 AWS Cloud Development Kit 🔹 Puppet 🔹 Helm IaC advantages: 🔹 Declarative infrastructure definition 🔹 Reproducible environments 🔹 Auditable changes 🔀 𝗚𝗶𝘁𝗢𝗽𝘀: 𝗠𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗚𝗶𝘁 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 Hari covers GitOps as an extension of version control principles to infrastructure and deployment management, creating a seamless integration between development and operations. Typical GitOps workflow for Kubernetes: 1️⃣ Developers commit code to a source repository 2️⃣ CI/CD pipeline processes the code 3️⃣ Docker image created and pushed to registry 4️⃣ GitOps repo updated with new values 5️⃣ Continuous Deployment tool (e.g., Argo CD) syncs changes 6️⃣ Changes deployed across Kubernetes clusters 🚀 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗼𝗳 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 By combining CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, and GitOps, Hari highlights that organizations can achieve: 🔹 Faster and more reliable deployments 🔹 Consistent and version-controlled infrastructure 🔹 Improved collaboration between development and operations teams Stay tuned for our upcoming posts where we'll explore the difference between automated and autonomous systems and how autonomous systems are taking Infrastructure as Code to the next level. #CICD #DevOps #InfrastructureAsCode #GitOps #AutoCon23 #AIinDevOps #PlatformEngineering\n\n🛠️ 𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘀: 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗢𝗽𝘀 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺𝘀 𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗔𝗜 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝘂𝘁 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀 🛠️ The world of FinOps is evolving, and AI is enabling an exciting new era for cloud cost optimization. Curious about your potential savings? By the end of this post, you'll see how companies are cutting cloud costs by up to 50% - and how you can assess your own savings opportunity. We're moving into the third era of FinOps: 📊 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘀 𝗘𝗿𝗮 (2012+): \"What did we spend last month?\" 📝 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗘𝗿𝗮 (2016+): \"We need to validate these proposed rightsizing changes with engineering.\" 🚀 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘀 𝗘𝗿𝗮 (2023+): \"Tell the AI to minimize cost while hitting our SLOs.\" Where are you in your FinOps journey through the '3 Rs'? While the 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗘𝗿𝗮 gave teams a starting point on where savings may exist, it also came with challenges: ✖️ Backlogs of recommendations ✖️ Slow execution due to scarce engineering bandwidth ✖️ Difficulties staying optimized as new releases make recommendations stale ✖️ Uncertain end-user impacts due to limited consideration of performance and availability Enter the AI-Powered 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘀 𝗘𝗿𝗮 with these new capabilities: 1️⃣ Continuous Cost Optimization: AI learns and adapts for ongoing savings. 2️⃣ Reduced Engineering Toil: AI autonomously executes optimizations. 3️⃣ Safety & Application Awareness: AI considers performance metrics and SLOs. 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹-𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁: KnowBe4, a leading security awareness platform, implemented AI-based optimization and saw remarkable results: 💰 Up to 50% cost savings in production & 87% in development ✅ Zero incidents 🏆 Improved customer experience ⏱️ Reduced engineering toil The future of FinOps is here, and it's powered by AI. Gartner predicts that \"By 2026, organizations performing real-time cost or performance optimization of cloud-based workloads will rise from less than 20% in 2022 to 50%.\" It's time to embrace the Results Era and unleash the full potential of AI in your FinOps strategy.

Finding material new savings becomes increasingly difficult, and the prior approach of utilizing reports and recommendations combined with manual engineering effort to execute no longer scales. At this stage, augmented or autonomous FinOps can be implemented to set teams up for the next set of cost savings gains. These AI/ML-based systems are capable of finding and executing optimizations across thousands of resources. They operate in a copilot or autopilot mode that reduces engineering bandwidth and use reinforcement learning for continuous improvement so that teams can stay optimized. Watch the video as Sedai's Nikhil Gopinath Kurup covers (a) the challenges that affect teams as they seek to work from reports and recommendations to results and (b) how autonomous approaches let teams tackle the bottlenecks they run into. 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗢𝗽𝘀 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽𝘀 teams realize more cost savings while reducing engineering effort: ➡️ 𝗖𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗟𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹 𝗼𝗳 𝗢𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀: Identifies and acts on a high number of individually low-value recommendations that add up over time, maximizing cumulative savings. ➡️ 𝗛𝗼𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: Generates recommendations that align with different team priorities, ensuring a cohesive optimization strategy. ➡️ 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗖𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗹𝗼𝘁 / 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗹𝗼𝘁): Automates the execution of recommendations, ensuring that results are realized, even when execution teams have other primary responsibilities. ➡️ 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Ensures ongoing optimization, adapting to new deployments and changes in your cloud infrastructure. 🔗 Join the conversation on FinOps and cloud management.
