In this study we investigated changes in diet from age 10 (2007) to age 14 years (2011) and the contribution of school-time consumption and school lunch choice to such changes. The 351 participants with dietary data (4 day food record) available at baseline (age 10 years) and follow-up (age 14 years) were included. Multi-level regression models were fitted for absolute or change in food and nutrient intake, cross-classified by primary and secondary school attended as appropriate, with adjustment for covariates and mis-reporting. From age 10 to age 14 years, children decreased energy intake from sugars (-2.6% energy (%E)) (standard error (SE) 0.44) and from saturated fats (-0.54%E (SE 0.18)), decreased fruit (-3.13Â g/MJ (SE 1.04)) and vegetables (-1.55Â g/MJ (SE 0.46)) consumption and increased sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) (4.66Â Â g/MJ (SE 1.87)) and fries (1.31Â Â g/MJ (SE 0.39)) consumption. Intake of snack foods, SSBs, and fries, but also fruits and vegetables was higher outside school hours. Prospective change from non-school lunch to school lunch, compared to maintaining non-school lunch consumption, was associated with decreased consumption of savoury snacks (-8.32Â g/day (SE 2.03)), increased consumption of fries (12.8Â g/day (SE 4.01)) and decreased consumption of fruit (-25.16Â g/day (SE 11.02)) during school hours. Changes in diet from age 10 to age 14 years differed within and outside of school hours. Consumption of a school lunch, compared to lunch obtained elsewhere, was associated with negative as well as positive changes in diet, suggesting that any efforts to encourage school lunch take-up need to be accompanied by further efforts to improve school lunch provision to meet nutritional guidelines.

To analyse worldwide suicide rates in children aged 10-14 years in two decades: 1990-1999 and 2000-2009. Suicide data for 81 countries or territories were retrieved from the World Health Organization Mortality Database, and population data from the World Bank data-set. In the past two decades the suicide rate per 100 000 in boys aged 10-14 years in 81 countries has shown a minor decline (from 1.61 to 1.52) whereas in girls it has shown a slight increase (from 0.85 to 0.94). Although the average rate has not changed significantly, rates have decreased in Europe and increased in South America. The suicide rates remain critical for boys in some former USSR republics. The changes may be related to economic recession and its impact on children from diverse cultural backgrounds, but may also be due to improvements in mortality registration in South America.

The boys were members of either a highly skilled and intensively active competitive league group (CL) or a less skilled, moderately active house league group (HL). Eating habits were recorded during a school day from a 24 hour recall questionnaire administered by a trained interviewer. The types and amounts of foods eaten were recorded and caloric intake was calculated. The total caloric intakes were not significantly different by age or competitive group. The boys had higher caloric intakes by age (200 kcal day-1) than reported by other studies but the caloric intake by kilogram of body weight was similar. There was a trend towards larger caloric intake by the CL boys (ages 10 and 11 years), however when divided by body weight the differences were not significant suggesting that this trend was due to a greater body weight of the CL boys and not a significantly increased caloric expenditure. The types of foods eaten (fruit, vegetables, dairy, meat, bread or \"empty calories\") were similar for the two activity groups and across ages 10 to 14 years. The caloric intakes of dairy and meat products of both groups were significantly higher than for the other food groups.\n\nAlcohol and other psychoactive drugs in trauma patients aged 10â14 years\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, G.; Chanmugam, A.; Rothman, R.; DiScala, C.; Paidas, C.; Kelen, G.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nObjectiveâTo examine the prevalence of alcohol and/or other psychoactive drugs, such as marijuana and cocaine (AODs), involved in preteen trauma patients. MethodsâToxicological testing results were analyzed for 1356 trauma patients aged 10â14 years recorded in the National Pediatric Trauma Registry for the years 1990â95. ResultsâOf the 1356 patients who received toxicological screening at the time of admission, 116 (9%) were positive for AODs. AOD involvement increased with age. Patients with pre-existing mental disorders were nearly three times as likely as other patients to be AOD positive (23% v 8%, p<0.01). AOD involvement was more prevalent in intentional injuries and in injuries that occurred at home. ConclusionsâAODs in preteen trauma are of valid concern, in particular among patients with mental disorders or intentional injuries. The role of AODs in childhood injuries needs to be further examined using standard screening instruments and representative study samples.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between a dynamically measured arch index and running biomechanics in healthy children. One hundred and one children aged 10-14 years were included in this study and underwent a biomechanical investigation. Plantar distribution (Novel, Emed) was used to determine the dynamic arch index and 3D motion capture (Vicon) to measure running biomechanics. Linear mixed models were established to determine the association between dynamic arch index and foot strike patterns, running kinematics, kinetics and temporal-spatial outcomes. No association was found between dynamic arch index and rate of rearfoot strikes (pâ¯=â¯0.072). Of all secondary outcomes, only the foot progression angle was associated with the dynamic arch index (pâ¯=â¯0.032) with greater external rotation in lower arched children. Overall, we found only few associations between arch characteristics and running biomechanics in children. However, altered foot arch characteristics are of clinical interest. Future studies should focus on detailed foot biomechanics and include clinically diagnosed high and low arched children. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the recent pattern of childhood mortality from injury by age-group in Scotland and considers its implications for prevention. Routine mortality data for the period 2002-2006 were obtained from the General Register Office for Scotland and were analysed in terms of number of deaths, mean annual mortality rates per 100,000 population, leading causes of death, and causes of injury death. Mid-year population estimates were used as the denominator. Chi-square tests were used to determine statistical significance. 186 children aged 0-14 died from an injury in Scotland during 2002-06 (MR 4.3 per 100,000). Injuries were the leading cause of death in 1-14, 5-9 and 10-14 year-olds (causing 25%, 29% and 32% of all deaths respectively). The leading individual causes of injury death (0-14 years) were pedestrian and non-pedestrian road-traffic injuries and assault/homicide but there was variation by age-group. Assault/homicide, fire and suffocation caused most injury deaths in young children; road-traffic injuries in older ones. Collectively, intentional injuries were a bigger threat to the lives of under-15s than any single cause of unintentional injury. The mortality rate from assault/homicide was highest in infants (<1 year) and decreased with increasing age. Children aged 5-9 were significantly less likely to die from an injury than 0-4 or 10-14 year-olds (p < 0.05). Suicide was an important cause of injury mortality in 10-14 year-olds. Injuries continue to be a leading cause of death in childhood in Scotland. Variation in causes of injury death by age-group is important when targeting preventive efforts. In particular, the threats of assault/homicide in infants, fire in 1-4 year-olds, pedestrian injury\n\nNonfatal Assaults Among Persons Aged 10-24 Years - United States, 2001-2015.\n\nPubMed\n\nDavid-Ferdon, Corinne F; Haileyesus, Tadesse; Liu, Yang; Simon, Thomas R; Kresnow, Marcie-Jo\n\n2018-02-09\n\nIn 2015, persons aged 10-24 years who were treated for nonfatal assault injuries in emergency departments (EDs) in the United States accounted for 32% of the approximately 1.5 million patients of all ages that EDs treated for nonfatal assault injuries (1). CDC analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) to examine 2001-2015 trends in nonfatal assault injuries among youths treated in EDs, by sex and age group, and to assess current rates by sex, age group, mechanism of injury, and disposition (1). Rates for 2001-2015 were significantly higher among males than among females and among young adults aged 20-24 years than among youths aged 10-14 and 15-19 years. During 2011-2015, rates declined for all groups. The 2015 rate among persons aged 10-24 years was 753.2 per 100,000 population, the lowest in the 15-year study period. Despite encouraging trends, the assault rate among young persons remains high. Rates in 2015 were higher among males, persons aged 20-24 years, and those who incurred intentional strike or hit injuries. Nearly one in 10 patients were admitted to the hospital, transferred to another hospital, or held for observation. Youth violence prevention strategies, including primary prevention approaches that build individual skills, strengthen family relationships, or connect young persons treated in EDs to immediate and ongoing support, can be implemented to decrease injuries and fatalities (2).\n\nPersonality Stability From Age 14 to Age 77 Years\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThere is evidence for differential stability in personality trait differences, even over decades. The authors used data from a sample of the Scottish Mental Survey, 1947 to study personality stability from childhood to older age. The 6-Day Sample (N = 1,208) were rated on six personality characteristics by their teachers at around age 14. In 2012, the authors traced as many of these participants as possible and invited them to take part in a follow-up study. Those who agreed (N = 174) completed a questionnaire booklet at age 77 years, which included rating themselves and asking someone who knew them well to rate them on the same 6 characteristics on which they were rated in adolescence. Each set of 6 ratings was reduced to the same single underlying factor, denoted dependability, a trait comparable to conscientiousness. Participantsâ and othersâ older-age personality characteristic ratings were moderately correlated with each other, and with other measures of personality and wellbeing, but correlations suggested no significant stability of any of the 6 characteristics or their underlying factor, dependability, over the 63-year interval. However, a more complex model, controlling rater effects, indicated significant 63-year stability of 1 personality characteristic, Stability of Moods, and near-significant stability of another, Conscientiousness. Results suggest that lifelong differential stability of personality is generally quite low, but that some aspects of personality in older age may relate to personality in childhood.

In 2008, 4,325 from the 5,249 adolescents of the 1993 birth cohort in Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, were interviewed. Sexual initiation was defined as the first intercourse up to the age of 14 years old. The information was obtained by interviewing adolescents in their houses, during the 2008 follow-up. The analyzed variables were: skin color, asset index, maternal and adolescents' schooling, experimental use of tobacco and alcohol, drunkenness episode, use of any illicit drug, illegal drug use by friends and involvement in fights during the past year. Use of condoms and contraceptive methods, number of partners and the age of sexual initiation were also analyzed. The prevalence of sexual initiation by the age of 14 was of 18.6%. Lower schooling, asset index and maternal education were related to higher prevalence of sexual initiation until the age of 14, as well as being male or being born to adolescent mothers. Sexual intercourse was also related to the behavioral variables analyzed. Among adolescent girls who had intercourse up to the age of 14, 30% did not use contraception and 18% did not use condoms in the last sexual intercourse. Boys reported a higher number of sexual partners than girls. The results suggest a relationship between sexual intercourse (â¤ 14 years) and some health-risk behaviors. The non-use of condoms and contraceptives may make them vulnerable to experiencing unwanted situations. Education and sociocultural strategies for health should be implemented from the beginning of adolescence.\n\n[Epidemiology of diabetes type 1 in children aged 0-14 in Podlasie Province in years 2005-2012].\n\nPubMed\n\nPeczyÅska, Joanna; PeczyÅska, Jadwiga; JamioÅkowska, Milena; Polkowska, Agnieszka; Zasim, Aneta; ÅuczyÅski, WÅodzimierz; GÅowiÅska-Olszewska, Barbara; Bossowski, Artur\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEpidemiological studies performed during last decades in many European countries and in the world proved increasing incidence rate of diabetes, especially diabetes type 1 in children (DMT1). In Europe there is one of the highest diabetes incidence rate. The aim of the study was to estimate the incidence rate of diabetes type 1 in children aged 0-14 years in North-East Poland during 2005-2012 years and to analyse this rates in relation to age, gender and season of the diabetes onset. The study was performed among patients staying under care of outpatient diabetes clinic of the Department of Pediatric, Endocrinologym Diabetology with Cardilogy Division, medical University of BiaÅystok, Poland. The DMT1 incidence rate was calculated as the number of all newly diagnosed cases per 100 000 persons 0-14 aged matched. During the studied 8-years- period DMT1 was diagnosed in 306 children aged 0-14 years, 159 boys and 147 girls, in Podlasie Province. The highest number of new cases was found in 2011: 49, and 2012: 47, with the lowest number in 2005 and 2009: 32 each year. The average incidence rate in the studied period was 20,84/100 000 population, aged matched. The lowest incidence rate was found in 0-4 yrs old group: 14,59 /100 000, in 5-9 years old group was: 22,04/100 000, and was highest in 10-14 years old group: 24,94/100 000. The highest increase in incidence rate was noted in the youngest group: from 9,14/100 000 in 2005, to 23,45/100 000 in 2012. The greatest number of new recognisions was found in from November to March, and the lowest number from June to August. 1. The DMT1 incidence rate among children aged 0-14 years, in Podlasie Province, during 2005-2012 years was 20,84/100 000. 2. Increase in incidence rate was observed in the studied period from 15,23/100 000 in 2005 to 26,71/100 000 in 2012. The highest increase in incidence rate, 2,5 times, was fund in the youngest group, aged 0-4 years. 3.

We assessed the distribution and trends of the main causes of death among children aged 5-9 years and 10-14 years from 1990 to 2016, for 51 countries in the WHO European Region. We used data from vital registration systems, cancer registries, and police records from 1980 to 2016 to estimate cause-specific mortality using the Cause of Death Ensemble model. For children aged 5-9 years, all-cause mortality rates (per 100â000 population) were estimated to be 46Â·3 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 45Â·1-47Â·5) in 1990 and 19Â·5 (18Â·1-20Â·9) in 2016, reflecting a 58Â·0% (54Â·7-61Â·1) decline. For children aged 10-14 years, all-cause mortality rates (per 100â000 population) were 37Â·9 (37Â·3-38Â·6) in 1990 and 20Â·1 (18Â·8-21Â·3) in 2016, reflecting a 47Â·1% (43Â·8-50Â·4) decline. In 2016, we estimated 10â740 deaths (95% UI 9970-11â542) in children aged 5-9 years and 10â279 deaths (9652-10â897) in those aged 10-14 years in the WHO European Region. Injuries (road injuries, drowning, and other injuries) caused 4163 deaths (3820-4540; 38Â·7% of total deaths) in children aged 5-9 years and 4468 deaths (4162-4812; 43Â·5% of total) in those aged 10-14 years in 2016. Neoplasms caused 2161 deaths (1872-2406; 20Â·1% of total deaths) in children aged 5-9 years and 1943 deaths (1749-2101; 18Â·9% of total deaths) in those aged 10-14 years in 2016. Notable differences existed in cause-specific mortality rates between the European subregions, from a two-times difference for leukaemia to a 20-times difference for lower respiratory infections between the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and EU15 (the 15 member states that had joined the European Union before May, 2004). Marked progress has been made in reducing the mortality burden in children aged 5-14 years over the past 26 years in the WHO European Region. More deaths could be prevented, especially in\n\nChanges in sleep duration in Spanish children aged 2-14 years from 1987 to 2011.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Ruiter, Ingrid; Olmedo-Requena, RocÃ­o; SÃ¡nchez-Cruz, JosÃ©-Juan; JimÃ©nez-MoleÃ³n, JosÃ©-Juan\n\n2016-05-01\n\nHistorical decreases in sleep duration in children have been documented worldwide; however, there is sparse information on sleep duration in differing cultural regions. We assess sleep duration and its trends for children in Spain from 1987 to 2011 and associated sociodemographic characteristics. Data from eight Spanish National Health Surveys, from 1987 to 2011, were collected on parent-reported sleep duration and associated socio-demographic characteristics including age, sex, parental level of education, child body mass index (BMI), and physical activity. A total of 24,867 children aged 2-14 years were included in the final sample. Overall, short sleep duration increased to 44.7% from 29.8% in 1987. Decreasing sleep duration trends were found in all demographic groups, decreasing by around 20 minutes in 24 hours from 1987 to 2011; decreasing to 10 hours 16 minutes in 2- to 5-year olds, 9 hours 31 minutes in 6- to 9-year-olds, and 8 hours 52 minutes in 10- to 14-year-olds. No difference in sleep duration was found between girls and boys. Sleep duration was associated with year of survey, age, level of parental education, obesity, and exercise. Almost 45% of children in Spain are not sleeping the recommended amount. Regional differences in sleep attitudes and duration alongside a lack of consistency in cut-offs for age-appropriate ideal sleep in literature is a barrier for international comparison and highlights the need for research in physiological sleep requirements. With the association of short sleep duration with many different health outcomes, sleep should be considered as a modifiable lifestyle factor and a public health issue.

This paper offers a rare opportunity to longitudinally examine mental health in a population-representative study of children aged 4-5 years to 14-15 years. Using data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC), this study examined maternally-reported child mental health over a 10 year period, in order to understand their initial mental health status early in life and its change over time, as measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Longitudinal models were fitted from ages 4-5 to 14-15 years. Results showed that child sex, maternal mental health, socio-economic status (family income, maternal education, neighbourhood disadvantage), maternal hostility, and child temperament (persistence, sociability, reactivity) are all independent contributors to child mental health at age 4. These effects largely persist over time, with the effects of maternal mental health increasing slightly over time. Persistence of these effects suggests the need for early intervention and supports. The independent contribution of these factors to child mental health suggests that multi-faceted approaches to child and maternal mental health are needed.\n\nAdherence to Dietary Guidelines and Successful Aging Over 10 Years.\n\nPubMed\n\nGopinath, Bamini; Russell, Joanna; Kifley, Annette; Flood, Victoria M; Mitchell, Paul\n\n2016-03-01\n\nWe aimed to prospectively examine the relationship between overall diet quality (reflecting adherence to dietary guidelines) and successful aging in a population-based cohort of older adults. In this population-based cohort study, we analyzed 10-year follow-up data from 1,609 adults aged 49 years and older, who were free of cancer, coronary artery disease, and stroke at the baseline and who had complete dietary data. Dietary data were collected using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Total diet scores (TDS) were allocated for intake of selected food groups and nutrients for each participant as described in the national dietary guidelines. Higher scores indicated closer adherence to dietary guidelines. Successful aging was defined as the absence of disability, depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment, respiratory symptoms, and chronic diseases (cancer, coronary artery disease, and stroke). At 10-year follow-up, 610 (37.9%) participants had died and 249 (15.5%) participants aged successfully. After multivariable adjustment, each 1-unit increase in TDS at baseline was associated with a 8% increased odds of successful aging 10 years later, odds ratio 1.08 (95% confidence interval 1.00-1.15). Participants in the highest (high adherence to dietary guidelines) versus lowest quartile (poor adherence to guidelines) of TDS at baseline had 58% higher odds of successful aging after 10 years, odds ratio 1.58 (95% confidence interval 1.02-2.46). Greater compliance with recommended national dietary guidelines (higher diet quality) was associated with an increased likelihood of successful aging, as determined through a multidomain approach.

The availability of simple to use widely available software has enabled the development of the probability threshold for individual teeth in growing children. Tooth development stage data from a previous study at the 10 year threshold were reused to estimate the probability of developing teeth being above or below the 10 year thresh-hold using the NORMDIST Function in Microsoft Excel. The probabilities within an individual subject are averaged to give a single probability that a subject is above or below 10 years old. To test the validity of this approach dental panoramic radiographs of 50 female and 50 male children within 2 years of the chronological age were assessed with the chronological age masked. Once the whole validation set of 100 radiographs had been assessed the masking was removed and the chronological age and dental age compared. The dental age was compared with chronological age to determine whether the dental age correctly or incorrectly identified a validation subject as above or below the 10 year threshold. The probability estimates correctly identified children as above or below on 94% of occasions. Only 2% of the validation group with a chronological age of less than 10 years were assigned to the over 10 year group. This study indicates the very high accuracy of assignment at the 10 year threshold. Further work at other legally important age thresholds is needed to explore the value of this approach to the technique of age estimation. Copyright Â© 2014.

We detected 437 children and the ascertainment achieved was 98.8%. The average annual incidence was 14.3/10(5) and the prevalence at the end of the period was 0.78 patients/10(3). During the last 6 years of the observation period, the incidence rose by 42%. The highest incidence was found among children between 10 and 13 years of age in both sexes. The age of onset and female/male ratio increased during the study period. There was an inverse relationship with monthly temperature. In comparison with other European epidemiological studies, we found a higher incidence and increased rate of growth of the incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus during the observation period.\n\n[Sexual intercourse debut and associated factors in Mexican students aged 14-19 years in public schools].\n\nPubMed\n\nRivera-Rivera, Leonor; Leyva-LÃ³pez, AhidÃ©e; GarcÃ­a-Guerra, Armando; de Castro, Filipa; GonzÃ¡lez-HernÃ¡ndez, Dolores; de Los Santos, Lilia Margarita\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo estimate the mean age of sexual intercourse debut (SID) and associated family and individual factors in 14-19-year-olds of both sexes in the 32 states of Mexico in 2007. A cross-sectional study was conducted of a representative sample of 9,893 students aged between 14 and 19 years old. The data were collected through a self-administered, anonymous and voluntary questionnaire. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) by category: no SID, SID at 10-15 years and SID at 16-19 years. The national mean age of SID was 16 years, being 15 years for boys (95%CI: 15.88-16.11) and 16 years for girls (95%CI: 15.26-15.42). Factors associated with SID in boys were disadvantaged socioeconomic level (OR=0.66; 95%CI: 0.46-0.94), living with parents (OR=0.65; 95%CI: 0.56-0.75), less offensive communication between parents and boys/girls (OR=0.66; 95%CI: 0.57-0.77), and high social self-esteem (OR=1.68; 95%CI: 1.35-1.77). Factors associated with SID in girls were traditional gender beliefs (OR=0.49; 95%CI: 0.32-0.74), high depressive symptoms (OR=1.88; 95%CI: 1.19-2.99), and high family self-esteem (OR= 0.50; 95%CI: 0.38-0.65). In Mexico, SID occurred early in boys. In addition, the findings of this study show that in Mexico, the age of SID and associated factors differ in boys and girls. The age of SID is strongly influenced by gender and cultural beliefs. Copyright Â© 2015 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana.

The study included 25 hearing impaired children (14 males, 11 females; mean age 11.4Â±1.4 years; range 10 to 14 years) (study group) and 20 children (9 males, 11 females; mean age 11.5Â±1.3 years; range 10 to 14 years) (control group) with normal hearing in the same age group and studying in the same class. Study group was separated into two subgroups as group 1a and group 1b since some of the children with hearing disability used hearing aid while some used cochlear implant. Intragroup comparisons and relational screening were performed for those who use hearing aids and cochlear implants. Intergroup comparisons were performed to evaluate the effect of the parameters on written language skills. Written expression skill level of children with hearing disability was significantly lower than their normal hearing peers (p=0.001). A significant relationship was detected between written language skills and mean hearing loss (p=0.048), duration of auditory deprivation (p=0.021), speech discrimination score (p=0.014), and preschool attendance (p=0.005), when it comes to socioeconomic status we were not able to find any significant relationship (p=0.636). It can be said that hearing loss affects written language skills negatively and hearing impaired individuals develop low-level written language skills compared to their normal hearing peers.\n\nSelf-esteem development from age 14 to 30 years: a longitudinal study.\n\nPubMed\n\nErol, Ruth Yasemin; Orth, Ulrich\n\n2011-09-01\n\nWe examined the development of self-esteem in adolescence and young adulthood. Data came from the Young Adults section of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which includes 8 assessments across a 14-year period of a national probability sample of 7,100 individuals age 14 to 30 years. Latent growth curve analyses indicated that self-esteem increases during adolescence and continues to increase more slowly in young adulthood. Women and men did not differ in their self-esteem trajectories. In adolescence, Hispanics had lower self-esteem than Blacks and Whites, but the self-esteem of Hispanics subsequently increased more strongly, so that at age 30 Blacks and Hispanics had higher self-esteem than Whites. At each age, emotionally stable, extraverted, and conscientious individuals experienced higher self-esteem than emotionally unstable, introverted, and less conscientious individuals. Moreover, at each age, high sense of mastery, low risk taking, and better health predicted higher self-esteem. Finally, the results suggest that normative increase in sense of mastery accounts for a large proportion of the normative increase in self-esteem.

The group as a whole had normal height and weight percentiles, and each child grew along his or her established somatic growth curve. Although some children had abnormal values, the group maintained a normal mean total lung capacity and functional residual capacity. The mean residual volume and the residual volume/total lung capacity ratios were elevated at both ages. At age 7 years the 19 patients (59%) who had a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of less than 80% had \"catch up\" improvement by 10 years of age (65 +/- 11% to 72 +/- 16% of predicted value; p less than 0.05). All the children who had a normal FEV1 at 7 years of age continued to have a normal FEV1 at age 10 years. Resting single-breath carbon monoxide uptake by the lung was normal when measured at age 10 years. The majority of patients had a positive methacholine challenge test result at both ages, although there was a low incidence of clinically diagnosed asthma. This study demonstrates that patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who have normal lung function at age 7 have had normal lung growth and that those with evidence of mild to moderate lung disease have continued lung growth or repair, or both, during their school years.\n\nAttitudes to HPV Vaccination among Parents of Children Aged 10 to 13 Years.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeven, Memnun; GÃ¼venÃ§, GÃ¼lten; Åahin, Eda; AkyÃ¼z, AygÃ¼l\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThis study aimed to determine the willingness of parents to allow their sons and/or daughters aged 10-13 years to be vaccinated for human papillomavirus (HPV). This was a descriptive study conducted in an elementary school to recruit students' parents into the study. The sample consisted of 368 (69.1%) parents of children aged 10-13 years who were willing to participate in the study as a couple. Questionnaire-based data were collected from the couples. Prior information regarding HPV and vaccination and the opinions of parents of children aged 10-13 about HPV vaccination for their daughter or son. Only 26.9% of mothers and 25.0% of fathers claimed to be aware of HPV, and only 24.5% of mothers and 21.2% of fathers claimed to be aware of its vaccine. If the vaccine were available in Turkey, 21.6% of mothers and 22.4% of fathers would be willing to vaccinate their sons; although the vaccine for girls is available in Turkey, only 14.4% of mothers and 15.5% of fathers were willing to vaccinate their daughters. Few participants reported knowing about the HPV vaccine, while far fewer intended to vaccinate their daughters and sons against the infection. Both males and females should be informed about HPV and its vaccine, and initiatives to increase both awareness and the information of health care professionals should be encouraged.

This prospective study was based on a birth cohort across 4 Spanish regions. In the 3 younger subcohorts (nâ=â1093), parents reported lifestyle habits of child at age 4 years of age on a questionnaire, and children performed a computerized working memory task at 7 years of age. In the older subcohort (nâ=â307), the questionnaire was completed at 6 years of age and working memory was tested at 14 years of age. Adjusted regression models were developed to investigate the associations between lifestyle habits and working memory. Low extracurricular physical activity levels at 4 years of age were associated with a nonsignificant 0.95% (95% CI -2.81 to 0.92) reduction of correct responses in the working memory task at age 7 years of age. Low extracurricular physical activity levels at 6 years of age were associated with a 4.22% (95% CI -8.05 to -0.39) reduction of correct responses at age 14 years. Television watching was not associated with working memory. Other sedentary behaviors at 6 year of age were associated with a 5.07% (95% CI -9.68 to -0.46) reduction of correct responses in boys at 14 years of age. Low extracurricular physical activity levels at preschool and primary school ages were associated with poorer working memory performance at primary school age and adolescence, respectively. High sedentary behavior levels at primary school age were related negatively to working memory in adolescent boys. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to assess carriage rates and anti-streptococcal C5a peptidase (anti-SCP) IgG levels and identify epidemiologic factors related to carriage or seropositivity in Australian children. A throat swab and blood sample were collected for microbiological and serological analysis (anti-SCP IgG) in 542 healthy children aged 0-10 years. Sequence analysis of the SCP gene was performed. Serological analysis used a competitive Luminex Immunoassay designed to preferentially detect functional antibody. GAS-positive culture prevalence in throat swabs was 5.0% (range 0-10%), with the highest rate in 5 and 9 years old children. The rate of non-GAS BHS carriage was low (<1%). The scp gene was present in all 22 isolates evaluated. As age of child increased, the rate of carriage increased; odds ratio, 1.14 (1.00, 1.29); P = 0.50. Geometric mean anti-SCP titers increased with each age-band from 2 to 7 years, then plateaued. Age, geographic location and number of children within the household were significantly associated with the presence of anti-SCP antibodies. Children are exposed to GAS and other BHS at a young age, which is important for determining the target age for vaccination to protect before the period of risk.\n\nThe Conception of Risk in Minority Young Adolescents Aged 12-14 Years\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLeblanc, Raymond; Drolet, Marie; Ducharme, Daphne; Arcand, Isabelle; Head, Robert; Alphonse, Jean R.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis study examines the conceptualization of risk behavior held by 26 Franco-Ontarian young adolescents (12-14 years of age) who participated in Lions Quest, a program specially designed to promote physical and mental health and to prevent drug and alcohol use.

Paul\n\n2006-01-01\n\nObjective Influenza-associated deaths in healthy children that were reported during the 2003â2004 influenza season heightened the public awareness of the seriousness of influenza in children. In 1996â1998, a pivotal phase III trial was conducted in children who were 15 to 71 months of age. Live attenuated influenza vaccine, trivalent (LAIV-T), was shown to be safe and efficacious. In a subsequent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled LAIV-T trial in children who were 1 to 17 years of age, a statistically significant increase in asthma encounters was observed for children who were younger than 59 months. LAIV-T was not licensed to children who were younger than 5 years because of the concern for asthma. We report on the largest safety study to date of the recently licensed LAIV-T in children 18 months to 4 years, 5 to 9 years, and 10 to 18 years of age in a 4-year (1998â2002) community-based trial that was conducted at Scott & White Memorial Hospital and Clinic (Temple, TX). Methods An open-label, nonrandomized, community-based trial of LAIV-T was conducted before its licensure. Medical records of all children were surveyed for serious adverse events (SAEs) 6 weeks after vaccination. Health care utilization was evaluated by determining the relative risk (RR) of medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI) and asthma rates at 0 to 14 and 15 to 42 days after vaccination compared with the rates before vaccination. Medical charts of all visits coded as asthma were reviewed for appropriate classification of events: acute asthma or other. We evaluated the risk for MAARI (health care utilization for acute respiratory illness) 0 to 14 and 15 to 42 days after LAIV-T by a method similar to the postlicensure safety analysis conducted on measles, mumps, and rubella and on diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis vaccines. Results All children regardless of age were administered a single intranasal dose of LAIV-T in each vaccine year.

This is a population-based 10 years follow-up study of 26,891 subjects aged 25 years and older in TromsÃ¸, Norway. All non-vertebral fractures were registered from 1995 throughout 2004 by computerized search in radiographic archives. Absolute risks were estimated by life-table method taking into account the competing risk of death. The absolute fracture risk at each year of age was estimated for the next 10 years (10-year risk) or up to the age of 90 years (lifetime risk). The estimated 10-year absolute risk of all non-vertebral fracture was higher in men than women before but not after the age of 45 years. The 10-year absolute risk for non-vertebral and osteoporotic fractures was over 10%, respectively, in men over 65 and 70 years and in women over 45 and 50 years of age. The 10-year absolute risks of hip fractures at the age of 65 and 80 years were 4.2 and 18.6% in men, and 9.0 and 24.0% in women, respectively. The risk estimates for distal forearm and proximal humerus fractures were under 5% in men and 13% in women. The estimated lifetime risks for all fracture locations were higher in women than men at all ages. At the age of 50 years, the risks were 38.1 and 24.8% in men and 67.4 and 55.0% in women for all non-vertebral and osteoporotic fractures, respectively. The estimated gender- and age-specific 10-year and lifetime absolute fracture risk were higher in TromsÃ¸ than in other populations. The high lifetime fracture risk reflects the increased burden of fractures in this cohort.\n\nQuickStats: Death Rates for Motor Vehicle Traffic Injury,* Suicide,â and HomicideÂ§ Among Children and Adolescents aged 10-14 Years - United States, 1999-2014.\n\nPubMed\n\n2016-11-04\n\nIn 1999, the mortality rate for children and adolescents aged 10-14 years for deaths from motor vehicle traffic injury (4.5 per 100,000) was about four times higher than the rate for deaths for suicide and homicide (both at 1.2). From 1999 to 2014, the death rate for motor vehicle traffic injury declined 58%, to 1.9 in 2014 (384 deaths). From 1999 to 2007, the death rate for suicide fluctuated and then doubled from 2007 (0.9) to 2014 (2.1, 425 deaths). The death rate for homicide gradually declined to 0.8 in 2014. In 2013 and 2014, the differences between death rates for motor vehicle traffic injury and suicide were not statistically significant.\n\n[Breast cancer in MÃ©xico: a 10-year trend analysis on incidence and age at diagnosis].\n\nPubMed\n\nSalinas-MartÃ­nez, Ana MarÃ­a; JuÃ¡rez-Ruiz, Abigail; Mathiew-QuirÃ³s, Ãlvaro; GuzmÃ¡n-De la Garza, Francisco Javier; Santos-Lartigue, Adriana; Escobar-Moreno, CÃ©sar\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBreast cancer is an important public health problem. Some countries have achieved a downward trend while in others, continues ascending. In MÃ©xico, information on incidence and age at diagnosis is isolated in time, and knowledge on trend analysis is lacking. To examine the 2003-2012 trend of the incidence rate and age at diagnosis of breast cancer in the northeast of MÃ©xico. We also analyze the trend of positivity to nodes, hormone receptors and HER2; and its association with age at diagnosis. This is an epidemiological study of breast cancer patients in a tertiary care hospital in Monterrey, MÃ©xico (n = 3,488). Only new cases with a histology report were included; if this was not available, the cytology result was considered. Trend analysis was performed using the JoinPoint regression program Version 3.5. The breast cancer incidence rate increased from 26.7 to 49.8 per 100,000 between 2003 and 2011 (p < 0.05). The adjusted rate showed an annual percentage rate of change of +6.2% (95%CI 4.2, 8.2). The mean age was 55.7 Â± 13.7 years and remained stable over time. Nodes, hormone receptors and HER2 positivity rate also remained stable over time. Age < 50 years increased twice the risk for positivity to nodes (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.4, 2.7), ER-PR- (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4, 2.4) and ER-PR-HER2- (OR 1.9, 95%CI 1.5, 2.5). The 10-year analysis showed a significant upward trend. This study represents a first effort in our country, for determining patterns on incidence and age at diagnosis of breast cancer, as well as that of biomarkers.\n\nSubjective age and personality development: a 10-year study.\n\nPubMed\n\nStephan, Yannick; Sutin, Angelina R; Terracciano, Antonio\n\n2015-04-01\n\nPersonality theory and research typically focus on chronological age as a key indicator of personality development. This study examines whether the subjective experience of age is an alternative marker of the biomedical and psychosocial factors that contribute to individual differences in personality development. The present study uses data from the Midlife in the United States longitudinal survey (Nâ=â3,617) to examine how subjective age is associated with stability and change in personality and the dynamic associations between subjective age and personality traits over a 10-year period. Regression analyses indicated that a younger subjective age at baseline was associated with increases in Openness, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness; correlated changes were also found. The rank-order stability of Extraversion and Openness and overall profile consistency were higher among those with a younger subjective age at baseline and were also associated with the rate of subjective aging over time. The present study reveals that beyond chronological age, the age an individual feels is related to changes in characteristic ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving over time.

A consecutive series of 88 children born with CPH or CPS were included in a retrospective cohort. All participants were treated with one-stage palatal repair using a minimal incision technique with muscle reconstruction (mean age 13âmonths). Twelve children (14%) received a velopharyngeal flap. Cleft speech variables were rated at 5 and 10âyears of age independently by three experienced external speech-language pathologists. Inter- and intra-rater agreements were determined, and the prevalence of cleft speech characteristics was calculated. Moderate-to-severe hypernasality and weak pressure consonants were present in 5%-10% of the children at 5âyears, with marginal but statistically significant improvement at 10âyears of age. Frequently or always occurring audible nasal air leakage was detected in 20% of children at age 5, and increased to â¼35% of the children at 10âyears. Ten per cent had compensatory articulation at age 5, and 25% demonstrated s-distortions, whereas few had these problems at age 10. The results demonstrate low occurrence of compensatory articulation problems in this cohort, even by 5âyears of age. The high presence of symptoms of velopharyngeal insufficiency at 10âyears of age suggests a need for additional secondary velopharyngeal surgery.\n\nVisual impairment among 10-14-year school children in Puducherry: A cross-sectional study.\n\nPubMed\n\nVishnuprasad, R; Bazroy, Joy; Madhanraj, K; Prashanth, Hannah Ranjee; Singh, Zile; Samuel, Abel K; Muthukumar, T\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAccording to the 2010 estimates by the World Health Organization, nearly 285 million (4.24% of total population) people of all ages worldwide are visually impaired. Almost 18.9 million children under 15 years of age are visually impaired globally. In developing countries, 7%-31% of childhood blindness and visual impairment is avoidable. The study was conducted as a cross-sectional study among 1884 school students in Puducherry, in the age group of 10-14 years. A child with presenting maximum vision â¤6/12 Snellen equivalent in the better eye is considered visually impaired. Data were entered in Microsoft Excel 2013 and analyzed using the statistical software SPSS version 21.0. Chi-square test was applied for testing difference in proportion and a P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The overall prevalence of visual impairment (vision â¤6/12) among the study participants was 6.37% (95% confidence interval = 5.27-7.47). The prevalence of visual impairment increased with age and it was found to be high among male students (6.6%) when compared to female students (6%). Presenting vision of 6/6 was observed in 79.8% of the children while with pinhole correction, the proportion increased to 94.6%. The prevalence of visual impairment in our study population was found to be 6.37% and the prevalence was even higher among children who belonged to schools of urban region or private schools. Children with a positive family history of spectacle use were more likely to have visual impairment.\n\nMeasles Humoral and Cell-Mediated Immunity in Children Aged 5â10 Years After Primary Measles Immunization Administered at 6 or 9 Months of Age\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGans, Hayley A.; Yasukawa, Linda L.; Sung, Phillip; Sullivan, Barbara; DeHovitz, Ross; Audet, Susette; Beeler, Judy; Arvin, Ann M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground.âGiven the high infant measles mortality rate, there is interest in whether a measles immunization regimen beginning at <12 months of age provides lasting immunity. Methods.âMeasles-specific immune responses were evaluated in 70 children aged 5â10 years after primary measles vaccine administered at 6, 9, or 12 months. Results.âAt 5â10 years of age, the stimulation index for measles T-cell proliferation was 11.4 (SE, 1.3), 10.9 (SE, 1.5), and 14.4 (SE 2.1) when the first measles dose was given at 6, 9, or 12 months, respectively. Neutralizing antibody concentration (geometric mean titer [GMT]) in those immunized at 6 months of age was 125 mIU/mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 42â377) in the presence of passive antibodies (PAs) and 335 mIU/mL (95% CI, 211â531) in those without PAs; in those immunized at 9 months, GMTs were 186 mIU/mL (95% CI, 103â335) and 1080 mIU/mL (95% CI, 642â1827) in the presence and absence of PAs, respectively. The GMT was 707 mIU/mL (95% CI, 456â1095) when vaccine was administered at 12 months (P â¤ .04). Conclusions.âMeasles-specific T-cell responses were sustained at 5â10 years of age regardless of age at time of primary measles immunization. Neutralizing antibody concentrations were lower in cohorts given the first vaccine dose at 6 months of age and in the presence of PAs; however, responses could be boosted by subsequent doses. Starting measles vaccination at <12 months of age may be beneficial during measles outbreaks or in endemic areas.

It has been developed by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) and is based on the Iowa Strengthening Families Program. This program has been certified and has been proven to effectively prevent adolescent drug and alcohol abuse in several countries around the globe. To evaluate the Strong Families Program toward adjusting current parenting styles, aiming to decrease risk behaviors in Chilean adolescents. A quasi-experimental study involving 120 families, selected from 6 schools within the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, Chile. A group of 129 adolescents and 124 parents were chosen by convenience to be intervened. A control group of 223 adolescents and 165 parents were not intervened. The families that underwent intervention attended to 7 educational sessions. The intervened and control groups were evaluated before intervention as well as 6 months after intervention, by means of self-administered evaluation tools. The intervened parents showed significant parenting changes six months after intervention, which resulted in less yelling (p = 0.007), insults (p = 0.002) and lack of control when their children misbehaved (p = 0.008). Regarding the risk behaviors in the intervened and control adolescents, no changes were observed in terms of the consumption rate of tobacco, alcohol or illegal drug use, or in sexual risk behaviors. After six months of intervention, the Program proved to be effective in modifying parenting styles. However, no changes were observed in risk behaviors among adolescents, which could occur within a longer period of time, as reported in other studies.\n\n29 CFR 570.33 - Prohibited occupations for minors 14 and 15 years of age.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... shall apply to all occupations other than the following: (a) Manufacturing, mining, or processing... revised text is set forth as follows: Â§ 570.33 Occupations that are prohibited to minors 14 and 15 years... age: (a) Manufacturing, mining, or processing occupations, including occupations requiring the...\n\nDifferences in BMI z-Scores between Offspring of Smoking and Nonsmoking Mothers: A Longitudinal Study of German Children from Birth through 14 Years of Age\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFenske, Nora; MÃ¼ller, Manfred J.; Plachta-Danielzik, Sandra; Keil, Thomas; Grabenhenrich, Linus; von Kries, RÃ¼diger\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground: Children of mothers who smoked during pregnancy have a lower birth weight but have a higher chance to become overweight during childhood. Objectives: We followed children longitudinally to assess the age when higher body mass index (BMI) z-scores became evident in the children of mothers who smoked during pregnancy, and to evaluate the trajectory of changes until adolescence. Methods: We pooled data from two German cohort studies that included repeated anthropometric measurements until 14 years of age and information on smoking during pregnancy and other risk factors for overweight. We used longitudinal quantile regression to estimate age- and sex-specific associations between maternal smoking and the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th quantiles of the BMI z-score distribution in study participants from birth through 14 years of age, adjusted for potential confounders. We used additive mixed models to estimate associations with mean BMI z-scores. Results: Mean and median (50th quantile) BMI z-scores at birth were smaller in the children of mothers who smoked during pregnancy compared with children of nonsmoking mothers, but BMI z-scores were significantly associated with maternal smoking beginning at the age of 4â5 years, and differences increased over time. For example, the difference in the median BMI z-score between the daughters of smokers versus nonsmokers was 0.12 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.21) at 5 years, and 0.30 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.39) at 14 years of age. For lower BMI z-score quantiles, the association with smoking was more pronounced in girls, whereas in boys the association was more pronounced for higher BMI z-score quantiles. Conclusions: A clear difference in BMI z-score (mean and median) between children of smoking and nonsmoking mothers emerged at 4â5 years of age. The shape and size of age-specific effect estimates for maternal smoking during pregnancy varied by age and sex across the BMI z-score distribution.

A cross-sectional study was done in Jiading District, Shanghai during November and December 2013. We randomly selected 7 kindergartens and 7 primary schools, with probability proportionate to size. Chinese children (n = 8398) aged 3 to 10 years were enumerated, and 8267 (98.4%) were included. Children underwent distance visual acuity assessment and refraction measurement by cycloplegic autorefraction and subjective refraction. The prevalence of uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), presenting visual acuity, and best-corrected visual acuity in the better eye of â¤20/40 was 19.8%, 15.5%, and 1.7%, respectively. Among those with UCVA â¤ 20/40, 93.2% could achieve visual acuity of â¥20/32 with refraction. Only 28.7% (n = 465) of children with UCVA in the better eye of â¤20/40 wore glasses. Prevalence of myopia (spherical equivalent â¤-0.5 diopters [D] in at least one eye) increased from 1.78% in 3-year-olds to 52.2% in 10-year-olds, while prevalence of hyperopia (spherical equivalent â¥+2.0 D) decreased from 17.8% among 3-year-olds to 2.6% by 10 years of age. After adjusting for age, attending elite \"high-level\" school was statistically associated with greater myopia prevalence. The prevalence of myopia was lower or comparable to that reported in other populations from age 3 to 5 years, but increased dramatically after 6 years, consistent with a strong environmental role of schooling on myopia development.\n\nFactors associated with arterial stiffness in children aged 9-10 years\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBatista, Milena Santos; Mill, JosÃ© Geraldo; Pereira, Taisa Sabrina Silva; Fernandes, Carolina Dadalto Rocha; Molina, Maria del Carmen Bisi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE To analyze the factors associated with stiffness of the great arteries in prepubertal children. METHODS This study with convenience sample of 231 schoolchildren aged 9-10 years enrolled in public and private schools in VitÃ³ria, ES, Southeastern Brazil, in 2010-2011. Anthropometric and hemodynamic data, blood pressure, and pulse wave velocity in the carotid-femoral segment were obtained. Data on current and previous health conditions were obtained by questionnaire and notes on the childâs health card. Multiple linear regression was applied to identify the partial and total contribution of the factors in determining the pulse wave velocity values. RESULTS Among the students, 50.2% were female and 55.4% were 10 years old. Among those classified in the last tertile of pulse wave velocity, 60.0% were overweight, with higher mean blood pressure, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio. Birth weight was not associated with pulse wave velocity. After multiple linear regression analysis, body mass index (BMI) and diastolic blood pressure remained in the model. CONCLUSIONS BMI was the most important factor in determining arterial stiffness in children aged 9-10 years.

It is of utmost importance to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of every odontological method for age evaluation considering the sensitivity, or the ability to estimate the true positive cases, and the specificity, or the ability to estimate the true negative cases. The research aims to compare the specificity and sensitivity of four commonly adopted methods of dental age estimation - Demirjian, Haavikko, Willems and Cameriere - in a sample of Italian children aged between 11 and 16 years, with an age threshold of 14 years, using receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curve (AUC). In addition, new decision criteria are developed to increase the accuracy of the methods. Among the four odontological methods for age estimation adopted in the research, the Cameriere method showed the highest AUC in both female and male cohorts. The Cameriere method shows a high degree of accuracy at the age threshold of 14 years. To adopt the Cameriere method to estimate the 14-year age threshold more accurately, however, it is suggested - according to the Youden index - that the decision criterion be set at the lower value of 12.928 for females and 13.258 years for males, obtaining a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 88% in females, and a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 92% in males. If a specificity level >90% is needed, the cut-off point should be set at 12.959 years (82% sensitivity) for females.

The reading and spelling skills of eight- to 10-year-old FGR children born at 24-40 gestational weeks were compared with those of their gestational age-matched, appropriately grown (AGA) peers. A prospectively collected cohort of 37 FGR and 31 AGA children was recruited prenatally at a Finnish tertiary care centre during 1998-2001. The children's reading and spelling skills were assessed using standardised tests for Finnish-speaking second and third graders. Significantly more children performed below the 10th percentile normal values for reading and spelling skills in the FGR group than in the AGA group. At nine years of age, the FGR children had significantly poorer performance in word reading skills and reading fluency, reading accuracy and reading comprehension than the AGA controls. No between-group differences were detected at eight years of age. FGR is associated with poor performance in reading and spelling skills. A third of the FGR children performed below the 10th percentile normal values at nine years of age. These results indicate a need to continuously evaluate linguistic and literacy skills as FGR children age to ensure optimal support. Â©2017 Foundation Acta Paediatrica.

Girls aged 9-14 years were randomized to receive 2D at months 0 and 6 (M0,6; (n = 550) or months 0 and 12 (M0,12; n = 415), and women aged 15-25 years received 3D at months 0, 1, and 6 (n = 482). End points included noninferiority of HPV-16/18 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for 2D (M0,6) versus 3D (primary), 2D (M0,12) versus 3D, and 2D (M0,6) versus 2D (M0,12); neutralizing antibodies; cell-mediated immunity; reactogenicity; and safety. Limits of noninferiority were predefined as <5% difference in seroconversion rate and <2-fold difference in geometric mean antibody titer ratio. One month after the last dose, both 2D regimens in girls aged 9-14 years were noninferior to 3D in women aged 15-25 years and 2D (M0,12) was noninferior to 2D (M0,6). Geometric mean antibody titer ratios (3D/2D) for HPV-16 and HPV-18 were 1.09 (95% confidence interval, .97-1.22) and 0.85 (.76-.95) for 2D (M0,6) versus 3D and 0.89 (.79-1.01) and 0.75 (.67-.85) for 2D (M0,12) versus 3D. The safety profile was clinically acceptable in all groups. The 2D regimens for the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in girls aged 9-14 years (M0,6 or M0,12) elicited HPV-16/18 immune responses that were noninferior to 3D in women aged 15-25 years.

In a multicenter clinical trial, 419 children with amblyopia (visual acuity, 20/40-20/100) were randomized to patching or atropine eyedrops for 6 months. Two years after enrollment, a subgroup of 188 children entered long-term follow-up. Treatment after 6 months was at the discretion of the investigator; 89% of children were treated. Visual acuity at age 10 years with the electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study test. Patching and atropine eyedrops produce comparable improvement in visual acuity that is maintained through age 10 years. The mean amblyopic eye acuity, measured in 169 patients, at age 10 years was 0.17 logMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) (approximately 20/32), and 46% of amblyopic eyes had an acuity of 20/25 or better. Age younger than 5 years at entry into the randomized trial was associated with a better visual acuity outcome (P < .001). Mean amblyopic and sound eye visual acuities at age 10 years were similar in the original treatment groups (P = .56 and P = .80, respectively). At age 10 years, the improvement of the amblyopic eye is maintained, although residual amblyopia is common after treatment initiated at age 3 years to younger than 7 years. The outcome is similar regardless of initial treatment with atropine or patching.\n\nCorrelates of Depressive Disorders in the Quebec General Population 6 to 14 Years of Age\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBergeron, Lise; Valla, Jean-Pierre; Smolla, Nicole; Piche, Genevieve; Berthiaume, Claude; St.-Georges, Marie\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThere are relatively few community-based epidemiological studies in which correlates of depressive disorders were identified through multivariate analyses in children and adolescents aged 6-14 years.

The participants underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination that included AL, cycloplegic refraction, and Pentacam measurements. The crystalline lens power was calculated using Bennett's formula and then compared among the children of different age groups, refractive statuses, and AL categories. The association of lens power and AL was analyzed using multiple regression. A total of 1992 children and adolescents aged 6- to 18-years old were included. The difference in lens power was greater before 10-years old, followed by a relatively smaller difference in children aged 10 to 14 years and the difference in lens power came to a near plateau in adolescents after 14-years old. The negative association between lens power and AL was found to be more evident in nonmyopes than in myopes irrespective of age (younger than 10 years: nonmyopes: Î² = -1.499, myopes: Î² = -0.872; older than 10 years: nonmyopes: Î² = -1.288, myopes: Î² = -0.390, all P < 0.001). The lens power in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years exhibited three stages. The association between lens power and AL differed between the nonmyopes and myopes. These findings suggested that less reduction in lens power might be associated with both growing age and increasing AL in myopes.\n\nWho is maintaining weight in a middle-aged population in Sweden? A longitudinal analysis over 10 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nNafziger, Anne N; Lindvall, Kristina; Norberg, Margareta; Stenlund, Hans; Wall, Stig; Jenkins, Paul L; Pearson, Thomas A; Weinehall, Lars\n\n2007-06-12\n\nObesity has primarily been addressed with interventions to promote weight loss and these have been largely unsuccessful. Primary prevention of obesity through support of weight maintenance may be a preferable strategy although to date this has not been the main focus of public health interventions. The aim of this study is to characterize who is not gaining weight during a 10 year period in Sweden. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were conducted in adults aged 30, 40, 50 and 60 years during the VÃ¤sterbotten Intervention Programme in Sweden. Height, weight, demographics and selected cardiovascular risk factors were collected on each participant. Prevalences of obesity were calculated for the 40, 50 and 60 year olds from the cross-sectional studies between 1990 and 2004. In the longitudinal study, 10-year non-gain (lost weight or maintained body weight within 3% of baseline weight) or weight gain (> or = 3%) was calculated for individuals aged 30, 40, or 50 years at baseline. A multivariate logistic regression model was built to predict weight non-gain. There were 82,927 adults included in the cross-sectional studies which had an average annual participation rate of 63%. Prevalence of obesity [body mass index (BMI) in kg/m2 > or = 30] increased from 9.4% in 1990 to 17.5% in 2004, and 60 year olds had the highest prevalence of obesity. 14,867 adults with a BMI of 18.5-29.9 at baseline participated in the longitudinal surveys which had a participation rate of 74%. 5242 adults (35.3%) were categorized as non-gainers. Older age, being female, classified as overweight by baseline BMI, later survey year, baseline diagnosis of diabetes, and lack of snuff use increased the chances of not gaining weight. Educational efforts should be broadened to include those adults who are usually considered to be at low risk for weight gain--younger individuals, those of normal body weight, and those without health conditions (e.g. diabetes type 2) and cardiovascular risk factors\n\nDental attrition and associated factors in adolescents 14 to 19 years of age: a pilot study.\n\nPubMed\n\nCasanova-Rosado, Juan F; Medina-SolÃ­s, Carlo E; Vallejos-SÃ¡nchez, Ana A; Casanova-Rosado, Alejandro J; MaupomÃ©, Gerardo; Avila-Burgos, Leticia\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThis cross-sectional study evaluated the relationship between attrition and diverse variables in 390 Mexican adolescents aged 14 to 19 years.

We aimed to prospectively investigate the relationship between infant eczema (within first 2 years of age), infant sleeping problems (within first 2 years of age), and the risk of mental health problems at 10 years of age. Between 1997 and 1999, a population-based birth cohort was recruited in Munich, Leipzig, Wesel, and Bad Honnef, Germany, and followed until 10 years of age. Physician-diagnosed eczema, parent-reported sleeping problems, and known environmental risk factors for atopy were regularly assessed until 10 years of age. Mental health was measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (parent version) at 10 years of age. We applied logistic regression modeling adjusting for environmental and lifestyle factors, allergic comorbidity, and family history of eczema. From the original cohort of 3097 neonates, 1658 (54%) were followed until age 10, while 1578 (51%) were eligible for analysis. In the fully adjusted model, children with infant eczema were at increased risk of hyperactivity/inattention at 10 years of age [odds ratio (OR) 1.78; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.02-3.09]. Infant eczema with concurrent sleeping problems predicted emotional problems [OR 2.63; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.20-5.76] and conduct problems (OR 3.03; 95% CI 1.01-9.12) at 10 years of age. Infant eczema with concurrent sleeping problems appears to be a risk factor for the development of mental health problems.

This study reports secondary analyses of longitudinal data from mothers and children (n=340) participating in the NOURISH randomized controlled trial. Exposure was quantified as the number of food items (n=55) tried by a child from specified lists at age 14 months. At age 3.7 years, food preferences, intake patterns, and fussiness (also at age 14 months) were assessed using maternal-completed, established questionnaires. Child weight and length/height were measured by study staff at both age points. Multivariable linear regression models were tested to predict food preferences, intake patterns, fussy eating, and body mass index z score at age 3.7 years adjusting for a range of maternal and child covariates. Having tried a greater number of vegetables, fruits, and noncore foods at age 14 months predicted corresponding preferences and higher intakes at age 3.7 years but did not predict child body mass index z score. Adjusting for fussiness at age 14 months, having tried more vegetables at age 14 months was associated with lower fussiness at age 3.7 years. These prospective analyses support the hypothesis that early taste and texture experiences influence subsequent food preferences and acceptance. These findings indicate introduction to a variety of fruits and vegetables and limited noncore food exposure from an early age are important strategies to improve later diet quality.

This was a prospective cohort study. There were 8 measures of fasting glucose and insulin from mean age of 10 years through mean age of 24 years, and insulin also at mean age of 25 years. Childhood MS was defined by at least 3 abnormal values among waist circumference, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose. Hyperinsulinemia was defined by insulin greater than or equal to race-specific 75th percentile. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus were excluded. The study was held in schools and in an outpatient clinical center. Participants were schoolgirls (260 white, 296 black). There was no intervention. The outcome measures were IFG (fasting glucose of at least 100 to 125 mg/dL) and T2DM (fasting glucose of at least 126 mg/dL). By the age of 24 years, there were 11 cases of T2DM (2%) and 108 cases of IFG (19%). By the age of 24 years, IFG + T2DM was present in 18% of women (73/412) who had normal insulin-no MS at the age of 10 years vs 28% (34/122) of those with high insulin-no MS at the age of 10 years (P = .014) and 67% (10/15) of those with high insulin + MS at the age of 10 years (P < .0001). By stepwise logistic regression, significant, independent, positive predictors of IFG + T2DM were first insulin measure in childhood, age at last sampling, childhood MS, change in body mass index over 15 years, and, separately, initial glucose of at least 100 mg/dL and average of all insulin quartile ranks over 15 years. The correlation between childhood insulin z score and insulin z score 15 years later was r = .30, P < .0001. Insulin and MS at a mean age of 10 years plus change in body mass index over 15 years, and 15-year average insulin rank independently predict IFG + T2DM by mean age of 24 years\n\nNeurocognitive functioning in children diagnosed with diabetes before age 10 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaufman, F R; Epport, K; Engilman, R; Halvorson, M\n\n1999-01-01\n\nOur objective was to determine scores on tests of neurocognitive functioning in children diagnosed with diabetes before age 10 years and to determine the association of age of diagnosis, duration of diabetes, subtle hypoglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, and history of hypoglycemic seizures with these neurocognitive test scores. Fifty-five of 62 eligible patients with a mean age of 7.9 +/- 1.6 years followed in our center were given the Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery, Beery Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration, Finger Tapping, Grooved Pegboard, and Verbal Selective Reminding tests to evaluate the following domains: memory/attention, visual-perceptual, broad cognitive function, academic achievement, and fine motor speed/coordination. Fifteen age-matched siblings served as controls. Twenty-seven subjects were less than 5 years of age when diagnosed with diabetes, the mean age at diagnosis was 4.5 +/- 2.1 years of age, and mean diabetes duration was 2.6 +/- 2.0 years. Eighteen patients had a history of severe hypoglycemia, eight of whom had hypoglycemic seizures. The mean HbA1c was 7.8 +/- 1.1% for the year prior to testing. Our results showed that the overall mean scores for the extensive neurocognitive battery were within the normal range and were comparable to the scores of the age-matched sibling controls. Age of diagnosis and duration of diabetes did not relate to neurocognitive test results. Mean HbA1c had a negative association with some tests of memory/attention (p < 0.03-0.04) and academic achievement (p < 0.005-0.03), while number of blood glucose levels less than mg/dL had a positive association with memory/attention (p < 0.004-0.04), verbal comprehension (p < 0.03) and academic achievement (p < 0.018-0.05). There was no association of neurocognitive test scores with severe hypoglycemia, but subjects with history of hypoglycemic seizures had a decrease in scores on tests assessing memory skills (p < 0.03) including short term memory and\n\nAssessing prescription stimulant use, misuse and diversion among youth 10 to 18 years of age\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCottler, Linda B.; Striley, Catherine Woodstock; Lasopa, Sonam O.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPurpose Assessing medical and non-medical use of stimulants and diversion is a challenge, especially among youth, with different methods for recruitment, and definitions of non-medical use and use. The field needs inexpensive, yet effective and reliable, methods of data collection to understand the prescription drug use problem. Most studies of youth are school or web-based, and conducted with teens. Recent Findings The National Monitoring of Adolescent Prescription Stimulants Study (N-MAPSS) recruited 11,048 youth 10 to 18 years of age from urban, rural and suburban areas in ten US cities using an entertainment venue intercept study. This review discusses the effectiveness of the method and results from four cross sections as well as the representativeness of the sample. Lifetime prevalence of any stimulant use was 14.8%, with rates highest among rural 16 to 18 year olds. The rate of past 30 day use was 7.3%, with over half (3.9%) non-medical use. Nearly 12% of all youth (whether a user or not) reported lifetime incoming/outgoing diversion of prescription stimulants. Summary Because no study has focused on stimulant use among youth as young as 10 and 11, this study is a landmark for future comparisons and offers a unique strategy for sampling and data collection.

Dogs were followed up from weaning (ie, 49 days of age) to 10 years of age through use of a written questionnaire sent to owners every 6 months. Mortality rate over time, risk factors potentially associated with death, and heritability of life expectancy were examined by use of a proportional hazards model based on the Weibull distribution. stimated mortality rate during the 10-year study period for this birth cohort of Boxers was 45%. The probability of surviving to 5 years of age was 88%; the probability of surviving to 10 years of age was 55%. Estimated effective heritability of life expectancy was 0.076, meaning that in this population, an estimated 76% of the observed variation in life expectancy could be attributed to genetic differences among dogs that were passed from parents to their offspring. Results suggest that cumulative incidence of death from weaning to 10 years of age among this birth cohort of Boxers was 45%. The estimated heritability of life expectancy suggested that life expectancy can be improved by use of selective breeding.\n\nFood hypersensitivity in patients over 14 years of age suffering from atopic dermatitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nCelakovskÃ¡, Jarmila; Ettler, K; EttlerovÃ¡, K; VanÄÄkovÃ¡, J\n\n2014-05-01\n\nPatients suffering from atopic dermatitis often describe food hypersensitivity. Rising prevalence of food hypersensitivity and severe allergic reactions to foods have been reported, but the data are scarce. Evaluation of food hypersensitivity reactions in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis. The dermatological examination was performed in patients of age 14 years and above and the detailed history was taken concerning the food hypersensitivity. A total of 228 patients were examined-72 men, 156 women, average age 26.2 (SD 9.5) years. The food hypersensitivity reactions were recorded in 196 patients from 228 (86%), no reactions were recorded in 32 patients (24%). Foods with the most often recorded reactions are: Nuts (in 35% of patients), tomatoes (in 20%), and kiwi (in 17, 5%), apples and spices (in 16%), tangerines and oranges (in 15%), capsicum (in 13%), fishes (in 12%), celery (in 9%), and chocolate (in 7%). Food hypersensitivity reactions are recorded in 86% of patients suffering from atopic dermatitis. Nuts, tomatoes, and pollen-associated foods play a role in the majority of patients suffering from atopic dermatitis.\n\nPreteen insulin levels interact with caloric intake to predict increases in obesity at ages 18 to 19 years: a 10-year prospective study of black and white girls.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorrison, John A; Glueck, Charles J; Wang, Ping\n\n2010-05-01\n\nWe evaluated the associations of teenage insulin and adolescent diet with 10-year weight gain in an analysis sample of black and white girls matched for pubertal stage, body mass index (BMI) (or fat mass), and insulin at ages 9 to 10 years. We hypothesized that preteen insulin and insulin resistance would interact with dietary factors to positively predict increases in BMI. Furthermore, we hypothesized that increased insulin and insulin resistance, interacting with higher caloric intake during adolescence, would lead to greater increments in BMI in black girls than in white girls. Prospective 10-year follow-up was performed on 215 pairs of black and white schoolgirls matched at baseline by BMI (or fat mass), insulin, and pubertal stage, with repeated measures of body habitus, insulin, and dietary intake. When matched for BMI, black girls had higher fat-free mass and white girls had higher fat mass at ages 9 to 10 years. Black-white differences in caloric intake were not significant at ages 9 to 10 years, but black girls consumed more calories at age 19 years. Black girls consumed a greater percentage of calories from fat throughout. At age 19 years, black girls had higher BMI, fat mass index, and insulin. When matched at ages 9 to 10 years for fat mass, black girls were heavier, had higher BMI, and had greater fat-free mass. By ages 18 to 19 years, black girls continued to have higher BMI, but had accrued higher fat mass and a higher percentage of body fat. By stepwise multiple regression, 10-year increases in BMI were predicted by ages 9 to 10 years BMI, 10-year change in insulin, and a 3-way interaction between ages 9 to 10 years insulin, adolescent caloric intake, and race (higher in black girls) (all Ps < .0001). Insulin at ages 9 to 10 years interacts with caloric intake to increase BMI by age 19 years. There appear to be intrinsic black-white metabolic differences that lead to greater gains in fat during adolescence in black girls. Evaluating BMI and insulin\n\nPrevalence of disability in three birth cohorts at old age over time spans of 10 and 20 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nWinblad, I; JÃ¤Ã¤skelÃ¤inen, M; KivelÃ¤, S L; Hiltunen, P; Laippala, P\n\n2001-10-01\n\nThe prevalence of disability at the age of 75+ measured by the Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) was compared among three birth cohorts: those born < or = 1903 (n = 348), those born < or = 1913 (n = 586), and those born < or = 1923 (n = 758). Significant risk factors for disability were female sex and age; the cohort effect was not significant. The prevalence rates of disability were 29.0% (95% CI 24.2-33.8), 34.8% (30.9-38.7), and 28.8% (25.5-32.0) for the first, second, and third cohorts. In the age group 75-79 years the rates were 20.1% (95% CI 13.8-26.4), 25.5% (20.2-30.7), and 14.4% (10.6-18.1). The change was due to the declining disability of women. The distributions in the three cohorts based on the numbers of ADL limitations did not differ. As far as the whole aged populations were concerned, longer life was not accompanied by improving health.\n\nAssessment of a ground water flow model of the Bangkok Basin, Thailand, using carbon-14-based ages and paleohydrology\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSanford, W.E.; Buapeng, S.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nA study was undertaken to understand the groundwater flow conditions in the Bangkok Basin, Thailand, by comparing 14C-based and simulated groundwater ages. 14C measurements were made on about 50 water samples taken from wells throughout the basin. Simulated ages were obtained using 1) backward-pathline tracking based on the well locations, and 2) results from a three-dimensional groundwater flow model. Comparisons of ages at these locations reveal a large difference between 14C-based ages and ages predicted by the steady-state groundwater flow model. Mainly, 14C and 13C analyses indicate that groundwater in the Bangkok area is about 20,000 years old, whereas steady-state flow and transport simulations imply that groundwater in the Bangkok area is 50,000-100,000 years old. One potential reason for the discrepancy between simulated and 14C-based ages is the assumption in the model of steady-state flow. Groundwater velocities were probably greater in the region before about 10,000 years ago, during the last glacial maximum, because of the lower position of sea level and the absence of the surficial Bangkok Clay. Paleoflow conditions were estimated and then incorporated into a second set of simulations. The new assumption was that current steady-state flow conditions existed for the last 8,000 years but were preceded by steady-state conditions representative of flow during the last glacial maximum. This \"transient\" paleohydrologic simulation yielded a mean simulated age that more closely agrees with the mean 14C-based age, especially if the 14C-based age is corrected for diffusion into clay layers. Although the uncertainties in both the simulated and 14C-based ages are nontrivial, the magnitude of the improved match in the mean age using a paleohydrologic simulation instead of a steady-state simulation suggests that flow conditions in the basin have changed significantly over the last 10,000-20,000 years. Given that the valid age range of 14C-dating methods and the\n\nAn increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus in Romanian children aged 0 to 17 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nSerban, Viorel; Brink, Stuart; Timar, Bogdan; Sima, Alexandra; Vlad, Mihaela; Timar, Romulus; Vlad, Adrian\n\n2015-03-01\n\nThe epidemiology of type 1 diabetes mellitus may provide insights into the pathogenesis of the disease. The aim of this work was to characterize the trend of the incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus in Romanian children aged from 0 to 17 years over a 10-year interval. Data regarding new cases were obtained from two sources: (1) The Romanian Childhood Diabetes Registry and (2) Records of the Medical Center \"Cristian Serban\", Buzias. The demographic data were retrieved from the National Institute for Statistics. The incidence was calculated for the age groups 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-17 years. A total of 3196 new cases, aged below 18 years, were found by both the sources. There were significant differences between the groups (p=0.012), the mean incidence being highest in the age group 10-14 years (9.6/100,000/year, 95% CI 9-10.1) and lowest in children aged from 0 to 4 years (4.8/100,000/year, 95% CI 4.4-5.3). Boys were slightly more frequently affected than girls (p=0.038). The age and gender adjusted incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus increased significantly (p<0.001) from 6.2/100,000/year (95% CI 5.5-6.9) in 2002 to 9.3/100,000/year (95% CI 8.4-10.3) in 2011. The raise in incidence was noticed in all age groups except for 15-17 years. Romania is a country with an intermediate incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children, which is slightly higher in boys than in girls. The incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus increased continuously during the 10-year survey, with the exception of the oldest teens.\n\nPrevalence of Overweight and Obesity among Students Aged 7-22 Years in Jiangsu Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nMusa, Taha Hussein; Wei, Li; Li, Xiao Shan; Pu, Yue Pu; Wei, Ping Min\n\n2016-10-01\n\nTo report the prevalence and trend of overweight and obesity among students aged 7-22 years in Jiangsu, 2010 to 2013. This cross-sectional study was carried out as part of students physical fitness and health survey in Jiangsu province. A total of 255,581 subjects (50.03% males and 49.97% females) enrolled in 82 school and 10 universities in Jiangsu. Weights and heights were obtained for each subject and its body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the Chinese Working Group on Obesity in China (CWGO). Anthropometric measurement including bodyweight, height, BMI and bust were significantly different between males in urban compared to females living rural areas (P<0.001). The total prevalence of overweight and obesity was 12.4% and 5.7%. Males had a significantly higher rate than in female's student. The prevalence of overweight and obesity by age groups was (14.5%, 10.3%) at age 7-11 years, (11.2%, 6.8%) at age 12-14 years, (11.7%, 3.1%) at age 15-17 years, and (11.4%, 2.3%) at age 18-22 years. By regions; the highest prevalence of overweight obesity reported in Taizhou (10%, 14.2%), Xuzhou (9.4%, 12.5%), and Nanjing (9.2%, 15.6%), respectively. The finding declares that overweight and obesity are important health problems among students in Jiangsu Province. Early intervention programme are needed to address this problems.
