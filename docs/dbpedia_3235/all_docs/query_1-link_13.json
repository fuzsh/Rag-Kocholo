        "text": "The present paper peeps into the poetry of Kamala Das where she mainly deals with the feminist voice and the 'women questions' of love. She talks about the unsentimental, uninhibited expression of love, sex, emotional sterility in marital relationship. She talks about the trials and tribulations of the woman who struggles hard to find a place in the male dominated society. In her poetry, she not only expresses her feminine sensibility but the unfulfilled desires lying dormant in the unconscious mind. Her candid confessional revelations give a new dimension to her poetry. She explores herself through self-introduction and self-analysis. This paper explores the female psyche where rests an anxiety to care for her 'self' and to carve a space for herself in the patriarchal society. It depicts the agony of woman's heart, her emotional insecurity and loneliness. The poetry of Kamala Das is remarkable for the woman's quest for freedom and demand for the status of a human being.\n\nKamala Das (1934), is an Indian poet, novelist, short story writer. Her popularity in Kerala is based chiefly on her short stories and autobiography, while her oeuvre in English, written under the name Kamala Das, is noted for the poems and explicit autobiography. She was also a widely read columnist and wrote on diverse topics including women's issues, child care, politics among others. Her open and honest treatment of female sexuality, free from any sense of guilt, infused her writing with power and she got hope after freedom, but also marked her as an iconoclast in her generation. As Kamala Das is known that feminism is the advocacy of woman’s rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes. The various feminisms, however, share certain assumptions and concepts that underlie the diverse ways that individual critics explore the factor of sexual difference and privilege in the production, the form and content, the reception and the critical analysis and evaluation of works of literature: The basic view is that Western civilization is pervasively patriarchal (ruled by the father)- that is, it is male centered and controlled and is organized and conducted in such a way as to subordinate women to men in all cultural domains : familial, religious, political, economic, social, legal and artistic. As Kamala Das is known for its extreme frankness in its nature of writing which encompasses all her sufferings and grievances, this present paper will traces out this feminine sensibility in her poetry with special references to her poems- An Introduction, Summer in Calcutta, My Story and The Sunshine Cat.\n\nKamala Surayya, or Kamala Das, was a prominent Indian poet and writer who used her work to challenge the patriarchal norms of Indian society. Her poetry, particularly in collections like \"Summer in Calcutta,\" \"The Descendants,\" and \"The Old Playhouse and Other Poems,\" is marked by a strong feminist ethos that celebrates the power, autonomy, and agency of women. In her poetry, Kamala Das critiques the restrictive gender roles imposed on women by society, and advocates for the freedom and self-expression of women. She often uses her own experiences and emotions to illuminate the struggles and triumphs of women everywhere. Her poetry also explores themes of love, sexuality, and identity, often defying societal norms and taboos. One of the key ways in which Kamala Das subverts patriarchy in her poetry is through her depiction of female desire and sexuality. She openly writes about her own sexual experiences and desires, challenging the traditional notion of women as passive and chaste. Through her poetry, Kamala Das empowers women to embrace their sexuality and reject the shame and stigma attached to it. Kamala Das' poetry is replete with feministic ethos. Her poetry is remarkably realistic and feministic. The paper aims at a feminist reading of Kamala Das' poetry whereby she effectively subverts the ingrained elements of patriarchy, privileging female will, choice and strength.\n\nKamala Das has created a permanent place for herself in contemporary Indo-English poetry. Das as a poet treads on familiar grounds, and she never tries to transgress her self-imposed restrictions. Her poems bring to the fore her boldness and freedom in speaking aloud the secret longings and aspirations of womankind. Her woman pleads for domestic security and the inborn desire to be liberated. She also sings of love and the different roles it plays in human life. It can be varied as merely lust, ‘a skin-communicated thing’, a longing and hunger, an overpowering force, a bondage, an escape and a phenomenon which reveals the psychological processes behind both feminity and masculinity. The final impression that Das’ poetry leaves is bold, ruthless honesty tearing passionately at conventional attitudes to reveal the quintessential woman within. It is not strictly the ideology of feminism rather her individualism as a female writer that comes to the fore when she advocates a concept of love that does not impede her impulse to freedom. Her voice is a rebellion against a man-dominated world. A woman has to face puzzling adolescence, the pain of growing up and the problem of inequality with the male world. Kamala Das considers man as an agent of corruption who plays with the emotions of woman. Her poetry functions as a comic-relief in most of the times as it functions in a way to mock at the cruelty of man towards woman.\n\nAbstract- Kamala Das is one of the most prominent and debated figure in postcolonial Indian English poetry. Who writes with honesty and bold manner rarely in Indian context. She blend her personal experiences and observations in her poetry in a way it is become universal. Her depiction of woman is the typical answer to the subaltern and subsidiary voice of woman. She represents the modern women’s voice who wants to free her from the religious and social convention. Kamala Das takes the reader into the space of her private life and discloses the delicate facts of personal trauma and childhood suppression. She became the oppressed voice of woman and depict the universal sufferings of womanhood, women‘s struggle is to find their identity and their ―Self in a rebellious way. This paper aims to explore how Kamala Das sensitively point out the plight of woman whose status is prejudice in the religious and social obligation. Keyword-womanhood, sufferings, ill-treatment, equality, society, violence\n\nAbstract: In this paper an endeavor has been made to analyze the poetry of Kamala Das with a feminine perspective. Though she composed only a handful of poems yet it is suffice to unleash her feelings. It tells aloud her genuine feelings towards the society she inhabits, the norms and values she was compelled to internalize. Her poems speak not only of her traumatic sufferings but of the entire female folk. Thus, she can be regarded as the mouth-piece of her society. She has set the path to be followed by the writers to come. Thus, this paper seeks to explore the feminine dimension of her poetical composition. Keywords: rebellious, hierarchies, callousness, feminine sensibility,\n\nThis paper attempts to examine the issues of feminism in India and the position of women in the Indian society in the light of Kamala Das’s poetry. Post-Independence, Indian women writers have exhibited a strong sense of freedom and self-dependence of thought and action in their works. Kamala Das’s poetry is a symbol of reliance, intellectual freedom and empowerment of Indian women. This is an endeavour to analyse how Kamala Das redefines womanhood in her poetry through the use of concrete imagery, symbols and her crisp and novel ideas about women, their position in a male-dominated Indian society and many other issues surrounding her and many other women of the country. Key-words: Feminism, Womanhood, Kamala Das, Poetry, Indian Writing in English.\n\nThe 'defiant' stance of the Post-colonial Indian women poets is manifest in terms of bold pronouncement of feminine urges, feelings, experiences, perceptions and viewpoints in their poetic expressions. Among the modern Indian women poets writing in English, Kamala Das is the first one who dared to speak out for those women who refuse to be tethered to the orthodoxy of tradition. The present paper appreciates Kamala Das's rebellious attitude in her poetry with reference to the socio-literary background of Indian woman-hood. It is interesting to analyze her poetry in the perspective of various socio-cultural factors that have shaped the feminine consciousness of Indian women through the ages resulting into the evolution of a poetic tradition of their own. Das tears herself off from the romantic-idealist tradition of the pre-Independence women poets and offers a realistic and concrete portrayal of contemporary feminine experience, particularly in the ambit of man-woman relationship. The poet gives voice to those who strive to come out of the identity crisis as woman positioned in a patriarchal frame of reference.\n\nFeminism is the advocacy of woman's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes. The various feminisms, however, share certain assumptions and concepts that underlie the diverse ways that individual critics explore the factor of sexual difference and privilege in the production, the form and content, the reception and the critical analysis and evaluation of works of literature: The basic view is that Western civilization is pervasively patriarchal (ruled by the father)-that is, it is male-centered and controlled and is organized and conducted in such a way as to subordinate women to men in all cultural domains : familial, religious, political, economic, social, legal and artistic. As Kamala Das is known for its extreme frankness in its nature of writing which encompasses all her sufferings and grievances, this present paper will traces out this feminine sensibility in her poetry with special references to her poems-An Introduction, Summer in Calcutta, My Story and The Sunshine Cat."
