        "text": "EXCLUSIVE The idea was to do the interview differently. I had already recorded a number of shows specifically looking at the World Cup, and hence wanted to speak to Gautam about the 2011 experience. How did he handle pressure? Scoring the 97 against Sri Lanka in the final, when India had lost Sachin and Sehwag – how difficult was it for him? Does he ever feel that the 97 has not been celebrated enough in the annals of our cricket? How did Gautam prepare himself for the big games, and did he ever feel insecure? What did he do after winning the World Cup – is there anything that he hasn’t shared yet? With Gautam, what you get is straight talk. And that’s the best part about speaking to him. This interview too was no different. The 30 minutes literally flew by, and it was an intense conversation with an intense man. Excerpts: Boria: Do you ever look back and feel that if you got that elusive hundred and not been dismissed for 97, it would have been better? Does missing the 100 ever bother you? Gambhir: It just doesn’t matter if I got the hundred or not. All that matters is if India won the World Cup. We don’t play an individual sport. It is a team sport, and individual achievements are only important if they are of use to the team. This innings is far more important to me because it helped India win the final. I will tell you one thing straight. If I had got out for a low score and India won, I would be as happy. But If I got the 100 and India lost, the 100 would be of no value whatsoever to me. We are far too obsessed with individual milestones in India, and in doing so, the focus on occasions moves from the larger goal. The bigger picture of how your team has done is lost on occasions. That’s the only thing that is important in team sport. Read: https://lnkd.in/dU8pG526\n\nFrom Vinoo Mankad and Balbir Singh Senior, to Sachin Tendulkar Abhinav Bindra and Neeraj Chopra – Indian Sports’ Finest Moments. As India marks 76 years of independence, it merits a very special look back into the history of the nation’s sport. As result, we at RevSportz decided to compile the greatest moments in the history of Indian sport in the 76 years between 1947 and 2023. We will carry the list in three parts, and in chronological order. The first 25. 1947-48: First cricket tour of Australia, India encounter Bradman for the first time The Indians lost the series 0-4, a result that appears all the more mystifying given the Indian performance in the first-class matches of the tour. This, it can be asserted, was almost single-handedly orchestrated by SirDonald Bradman. Bradman, though 39, was still at his best and his scores- 185, 132 and 127 not out, 201 and 57 retired hurt – bear testament to his dominance of the Indian attack. 1948: India win hockey gold at the London Olympics defeating Great Britain It was a dream final: the defending champions from newly independent India taking on their former imperial masters who had avoided playing Olympic hockey once their former colony had shown their prowess with three golds in the pre-World-War-II years. Eventually, the Indians won the battle in style, defeating the British 4–0. 1950: India make it to the football World Cup in Brazil, but don’t play It is evident from reports that there is some truth in the claim that India did get an opportunity to participate in the football World Cup of 1950. It is evident that the real reason for withdrawal was India’s inability to select a competitive team and garner the necessary funding to send it to Rio. 1951: First Asian Games in India This first Asian Games was an Indian initiative, which was intrinsically linked to the larger Indian self-image of being a major Asian power, and the Nehruvian idea of India’s centrality in a new global order. The Games were deeply tied to the ideals, hopes and aspirations of Nehruvian India. They are also a useful prism to understand the struggle for Asian leadership that unfolded thereafter. 1952: First Test win, against England on home soil in Madras Down 0-1 in the series, the Indians had much more than pride at stake going into the fifth and final Test of the series at Chepauk in Madras. Finally, at 3pm on February 10, 1952, when CD Gopinath, the youngest member of the side, caught Brian Statham, history was made. Vijay Hazare had led India to her first Test victory. 1952: KD Jadhav wins India’s first individual medal at the Olympics in wrestling KD Jadhav will forever be remembered as the first individual medal winner for India at the Olympics. At Helsinki in 1952, he started the competition in terrific form, winning all his early bouts. Such was his performance that he was assured of a medal even before he fought his last two fights on July 22.

From the jaws of defeat, they had managed to snatch victory, and all of it was ascribed to Bazball. The truth was that India played badly. The target of 230 was chaseable, and it was more a case of India losing the match than England winning it. But in sport, it is winner takes all. And all of a sudden, the England team could do no wrong. Now, the picture is radically different. Against a depleted India, missing five of their key players, England had their best chance of winning the series. Instead, they played rank bad cricket and are now 1-2 down going into Ranchi. Bazball has backfired, and the batting did not hold up. Add to that, silly comments like the one made by Ben Duckett about Yashasvi Jaiswal having learned from England. It was only fair that Nasser Hussain tore into him and put him in his place. Duckett was plain silly to say that Jaiswal is batting the way he is after having taken a leaf out of England’s book. Virender Sehwag actually has a doctorate in this school of batsmanship, while Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist are also past masters. So, England hardly invented this batting wheel. Now, their own media and experts are after them. Each one wants England to be more flexible, while the players and the management want to stick to Bazball and are being stubborn about it. That’s what has added to the spice ahead of Ranchi. It is England v England, in a sense. Hussain v Duckett, and other experts against Ben Stokes. All Rohit Sharma and India need to do is enjoy the clash of cricket cultures, and push home the advantage. While England will feel huge relief at seeing Jasprit Bumrah rested, it is also their best chance to go past India. A slip in Ranchi, and the likes of Hussain will be all over Stokes and the team. It is as if the English scribes are now waiting for the team to fail. This is where Rohit and Rahul Dravid need to be resolute. Make the most of the opportunity and drive home the advantage. Rub salt into England’s wounds and answer Duckett, if need be. Another Jaiswal masterclass will add to the occasion. England, clearly, are on the verge of disintegrating and one more poor batting effort could pile on the misery. How the tables have turned since Hyderabad. At the end of the first Test, England held all the aces. Now they are upstarts who don’t want to change their game based on the conditions in the subcontinent. Is Bazball overrated and is this England team, which has all its batters averaging 40 or less except Root, one that has actually overachieved? Ranchi, in many senses, could provide the answer. An England win will settle nerves and calm critics. Bazball will have a new lease of life, and give Stokes some ground to stand on. Another failure will mean the knives will be sharpened. Hussain and others will attack Duckett and friends, and every false statement will be pounced on.\n\nIndia had slipped to fifth place in the WTC points table after losing the first Test of the series against England in Hyderabad, but climbed back up to No. 1 by winning the next three matches. The innings victory in Dharamsala extended their percentage points to 68.51%, having earned 74 out of 108 points after playing nine matches (six wins, two defeats, one draw) in the ongoing WTC cycle. According to the WTC points system, a team gets 12 points for a Test win, six for a tie, four for a draw, and nothing for a defeat. And they are ranked according to the percentage of points won because each team plays a different number of Tests in the WTC cycle. Points are also deducted for slow over rate penalties, which is why England have only 21 points despite winning three Tests in this WTC cycle. They have lost 19 points for slow over-rate penalties and are in eighth place with only 17.5 percentage points after playing ten Tests. New Zealand are presently second with 60% points and Australia are third with 59.09%. If New Zealand win the ongoing Christchurch Test, they will increase their percentage points to 66.67%; and if Australia win, they will move ahead of New Zealand on 62.5%. With only a Bangladesh-Sri Lanka Test series to go before the IPL season begins on March 22, India are set to remain No. 1 for a few months. Bangladesh are presently fourth in the WTC points table, but they have played only one series in the ongoing cycle, followed by Pakistan, West Indies, South Africa, England and Sri Lanka. The top two teams at the end of the WTC cycle will play the final at Lord’s in June 2025. India had qualified for both the previous WTC finals so far, but lost to New Zealand in 2021 and Australia in 2023.

Shastri feels India let the sport slip out of their grasp by permitting Bangladesh to attain additional 50 to 60 runs. Bangladesh have been reeling at 59 for 4 at one stage earlier than making a powerful restoration to publish 265 for 8. Speaking of the defeat, Shastri feels it is an incredible studying curve for the staff forward of Sunday’s ultimate towards Sri Lanka on the identical venue. “Firstly, think we let them score 50-60 extra runs. The kind of position they were in, we shouldn’t have allowed them to score more than 180. Secondly, this is a good work out for India. Forget about the result as they will play the final. They were batting for the first time under lights. It was a different challenge for the batters with the ball moving,” Shastri mentioned on Star Sports. Shastri was all reward for Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan for utilising his assets, including that they’ve a powerful spin assault. “For Shubman Gill, this is a big step. He took his time and scored a hundred. Plus, Bangladesh’s spin attack is a good one. They took two early wickets with the pacers but the match started after they introduced spin. It’s not easy to score between 15-40 overs. Shakib is a smart captain who knows how to marshal his spinners,” he added. Rohit’s India face Sri Lanka in Sunday’s Asia Cup ultimate, an important momentum-builder heading into subsequent month’s ODI World Cup. The cricketing giants have 13 Asian titles between them and Sri Lanka have a historical past of sneaking into the event’s ultimate — to the consternation of followers eager for any showdown between arch-rivals India and Pakistan. Sri Lanka, who gained the earlier version of the Asia Cup performed within the T20 format, got here in as underdogs and snuck into the Super Fours with a dramatic win over Afghanistan. However, they are going to be with out the providers of Maheesh Theekshana, dominated out of the ultimate as a consequence of a grade three hamstring tear.

Take a strong call, and make yourself accountable. Take ownership and step up. Be the leader on and off the field. That’s what India now wants to see from Harmanpreet Kaur, skipper of the women’s cricket team. To say India played well in the red-ball game and it is only the white-ball games that were lost doesn’t really work. India played a one-off red-ball Test against Australia. And six white-ball matches, of which five were lost. How does that work for a team that aspires to be the best in the world? For Harmanpreet, her average in the last 15 matches she has played across formats is a meagre 15. And she hardly bowls anymore. With such a record, how does she justify her place in the side? Should Smriti Mandhana not be given the leadership role and Harmanpreet asked to take a break and come back refreshed? Should she not follow in the footsteps of Virat Kohli and take some time off? India needs Harmanpreet the batter in the World Cup, and with not much time left, calls need to be made with some urgency.

India maintained their envious record at home by sealing the series in Ranchi and now, they will be looking for another favourable result to extend their lead in World Test Championships standings. The pitch and the cold weather, that is making the English feel at home, have been the two big talking points going into the game. The maximum temperature is expected to hover around 10 degrees for the opening two days before rising over the weekend. The pitch wore a flat look on the eve of the game but the moisture seeped underneath will keep the pacers interested in the early hours of play on all days.Read Less !(function(f, b, e, v, n, t, s) { function loadFBEvents(isFBCampaignActive) { if (!isFBCampaignActive) { return; } (function(f, b, e, v, n, t, s) { if (f.fbq) return; n = f.fbq = function() { n.callMethod ? n.callMethod(...arguments) : n.queue.push(arguments); }; if (!f._fbq) f._fbq = n; n.push = n; n.loaded = !0; n.version = '2.0'; n.queue = []; t = b.createElement(e); t.async = !0; t.defer = !0; t.src = v; s = b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(t, s); })(f, b, e, 'https://lnkd.in/d-eUnHGy', n, t, s); fbq('init', '593671331875494'); fbq('track', 'PageView'); }; function loadGtagEvents(isGoogleCampaignActive) { if (!isGoogleCampaignActive) { return; } var id = document.getElementById('toi-plus-google-campaign'); if (id) { return; } (function(f, b, e, v, n, t, s) { t = b.createElement(e); t.async = !0; t.defer = !0; t.src = v; t.id = 'toi-plus-google-campaign'; s = b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(t, s); })(f, b, e, 'https://lnkd.in/d_uP4Cr7', n, t, s); }; function loadSurvicateJs(allowedSurvicateSections = []){ const section = window.location.pathname.split('/')[1] const isHomePageAllowed = window.location.pathname === '/' && allowedSurvicateSections.includes('homepage') if(allowedSurvicateSections.includes(section) || isHomePageAllowed){ (function(w) { var s = document.createElement('script'); s.src=\"https://lnkd.in/da8ve3_s\"; s.async = true; var e = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; e.parentNode.insertBefore(s, e); })(window); } } window.TimesApps = window.TimesApps\n\nIf England don’t win this test they have only themselves and their rigid Bazball theories to blame. - They had India 33/3 and then again at 331/7. India should never have been allowed to make more than 350. Eng dropped five catches. - India are playing with 10 players today, including two debutants. No Kohli No Rahul No Ashwin No Iyer No Axar No Pant from the desired first choices. It’s almost a B team playing. - Eng rookie spinners so far have taken more wickets, have better economy and better strike rate than India’s star home performing spin attack. - In a nutshell, the Indian team is weakened and underperforming and England are throwing it away, repeatedly. - England will have to re-look at Bazball. Bazball didn’t help England get any unexpected series draw or win, home or away (like India have won at Aus twice, drew at SA once, won two tests in Eng last time). A draw vs Aus at home or win at Pak (where test cricket returned after a decade) isn’t a validation of Bazball. - England have this mindset that Indian spinners will eventually get you out, so let’s hit out. Even the elegant Root is often playing utterly experimental shots and hence throwing away strong positions. This encourages slam bang cricket, overriding the importance of determination, patience, grit and doggedness. It reduces the importance of keeping a price on your wicket, of making the bowler earn your wicket. India have clearly underperformed in this series, yet find themselves, and their noses ahead, often. - Yes Bazball makes test cricket interesting for neutrals. But if the lack of flexibility continues, coupled with England’s forever thinning bowling attack, Aussies will smother them to ashes in Ashes! - That is, after they survive this series, where many Indian players are due to perform, due to strike big. Like Kuldeep Yadav today! #INDvsENG #indiancricket #teamindia\n\nOn the evening of 15th Nov, Most Indians had their eyes glued to the TV sets, witnessing INDIA- NEW ZEALAND battling it out , in the ICC World-Cup Semi- Finals . In the midst of the NZ- batting, came a point when the winning scale was tipping towards the Kiwis! Most Indians started losing hope and giving their expert opinion full of doubts and negativity for the men in Blue! Why I mention it today is, Because.. Most people believe in patterns, superstitions, And the \"Law of Averages\". India has never won a cup without losing a match in the tournament. In 1983 they were the underdogs! In 2011 too they did lose in a couple of matches. Currently with a winning streak of 9/9, India was expected to lose at least one match. This one could have been that One! Remember this was a Knockout match! Which implied – India would not be able to make it to the finals! My question here is that why the majority of us fail to accept that – The present Indian team is simply the best combination of players any single team can have . They are playing the way winners should, Every single player is in his best form. Remember the West Indies from 1975- 1983, Or Australia from the 2000- to 2010? They never lost a single match! Simply because they were the best team! Finally after so many years, So is India right now! It’s just that the world-cup happens to fall in this time.. Law of averages is true, but not applicable on the present Indian team.. Because, The time is good for them, and this will prevail for some time! Eager to watch the finals in Ahmedabad with 100% certainty of the Indian victory! What do you think? Let me know in the comments below. #IccWorldCup23 #MenInBlue #Finale #Victory"
