        "text": "Melon seed has been described as very important oilseed crop that serves numerous food purposes across Nigeria. Since melon seed is within a shell, dehusking or decorticating or dehulling or shelling, it is expedient so as to use it for food. To carry out the process of removal of the shell, a melon decorticating machine was designed and developed. The machine was designed based on standard engineering design procedures. A CAD drawing was used to develop the machine and a detailed design of the machine was implemented. The CAD drawing was fabricated. The machine was built using materials available locally and it consists of the following components the melon shelling machine were the hopper, the shelling chamber, the base, the blower unit, the body frame, the blade, switch, fan regulator, feed controller, blade housing, electric motor, motor holder, bolt and nut. Two different performance evaluation were carried out: one, a comparison based on time of shelling using both the designe...\n\nAn integrated Bambaranut decorticating and winnowing machine which bears a 1 Ihp, 1000 r.p.m. electric motor was designed and developed. It is a 1000mm x 400mm x300 mm machine of gross mass 33.42kg which makes it portable. Falling pods from the hopper are struck by a rotating dehusker drum of 72.2 N force, the chaffs are blown out through a window and the seeds fall down and out via a chute. All the components of this machine were sourced locally making the overall cost cheap and affordable to the people in contrast with the decorticators imported from overseas.\n\nThe traditional method of cracking bush mango nuts manually to obtain the kernel, using a stone is slow, labour-intensive and very tedious. An affordable sheller was designed, fabricated and evaluated to crack and split the nuts and also to separate the kernels from the outer shell through the use of twin rollers and a screened agitator. The effect of the rollers’ peripheral speed, clearance between the rollers and moisture content of the nut on the efficiency of shelling of the machine were investigated. The highest efficiency of shelling of 75% was obtained at a roller peripheral speed of 1000rpm, roller clearance of 15mm, agitator angle of 100 and moisture content of 30.76%. For a roller clearance of 20mm, agitator angle of inclination of 200 for dry bush mango nuts, the maximum shelling efficiency of 39% was obtained at a roller speed of 1000rpm and the minimum shelling efficiency of 15% at a roller speed of 800rpm. The shelling efficiency decreases as the clearance increases. The efficiency of shelling decreases as the angle of inclination of the agitator increases. It was found that the roller peripheral speed, clearance between rollers, agitator angle and moisture content affected the efficiency of shelling.\n\nThis work entails the design and fabrication of a manually and electrically operated roasted groundnut decorticating machine. The decorticating machine which is powered manually or by 0.161 Hp, 1500rpm electric motor comprises of the hopper which contains the unpeeled groundnut seeds and is opened directly to the decorticating unit. The body of work is made with galvanize steel of thickness 1mm. The dimension of the body inside the frame is 580mm x 180mm x 580mm. The frame of the work is made with mild steel square bar of thickness 20mm. The frame is of size 600mm x 200mmx 600mm. The decorticating unit comprises of rotating inner drum of length 550mm and a diameter of 60mm with brush like projections and a shaft of 68mm passing through its centers and a fixed cylindrical drum of length 600mm and diameter 120mm. The inner drum with a rotation speed of 150rpm is attached with the help of a v-belt and two pulleys to the electric motor which drives it in an anticlockwise direction to peel the groundnut seeds. The peeled groundnut seeds and the chaffs fall directly into the cleaning unit where an installed fan blow away the chaff and the seeds are collected directly through an opening below the decorticating unit. The machine was made from locally sourced materials and it can be used in both urban and rural areas even where there is no electric power supply. The percentage of roasted groundnut seeds been peeled in manual and electrical operation in three successive runs was found to be 52% and 61% respectively.\n\nSheanut (Butyrospernum paradoxum) is an oil rich tropical tree crop, which is indigenous to the West African savannah zone. In Nigeria, most of the sheanuts shelling are done manually by rural women and children, which is labour demanding and tedious. This research work was carried out to determine some physical and mechanical properties of sheanut in order to minimize economic losses associated with its processing. The mean values recorded for the physical properties at 25% moisture content (wb) are; major diameter (29.20 mm), intermediate diameter (21.90 mm), minor diameter (15.00 mm), geometric mean diameter (21.90 mm), arithmetic mean diameter (21.20 mm), angle of repose (30.280). The mean values for the mechanical properties are; linear limit force (0.80 kN), linear limit deformation (4.60 mm), bioyield point force (1.40 kN), bioyield point deformation (6.50 mm), rupture point force (2.10 kN) and rupture point deformation (9.60 mm). Based on the physical and mechanical properties, a sheanut shelling machine was developed that is capable of addressing the aforementioned problems. Putting into consideration better shelling and efficient separation of shea nuts so as to encourage more utilization and processing of shea nuts and its products. The machine was designed to be powered by 5 hp electric motor. It was tested to shell, separate and clean sheanuts. The result of the performance evaluation showed that the machine had shelling efficiency of 96%; cleaning efficiency of the machine was 69.56% while the recovery efficiency was 82.7%. The successful development of this machine will reduce drudgery and time taken associated with the traditional method of sheanut shelling and therefore will increase productivity and utilization.\n\nAn integrated groundnut decorticating and winnowing machine which bears a 1 Ihp, 1000 r.p.m. electric motor was designed and developed. It is a 1000mm x 400mm x300 mm machine of gross mass 33.42kg which makes it portable. Falling pods from the hopper are struck by a rotating dehusking drum of 72.2 N force, the chaffs are blown out through a window and the seeds fall down and out via a chute. All the components of this machine were sourced locally making the overall cost cheap and affordable to the people in contrast with the decorticators imported from overseas.\n\nBuchanania lanzan (Chironji) a member of family Anacardiaceae consist of a hard nut that on decortication yields kernel containing 52% of oil and this oil is used as a substitute for olive and almond oil. Also, kernel is used for sweet meals, medicinal purpose, cosmetics etc. By manual decortication the capacity was observed to be minimum and recovery of whole kernel was nearly 12% only. This manual method is time consuming, laborious, inefficient and there is fear of injury to fingers. Decortication of chironji nut is a major problem and hence this valuable chironji kernel is to be procured at high price i.e. Approx. Rs.700-1000, whereas the chironji nut could be purchased at the rate of Rs. 100 to 150/kg. As the kernel is valuable, it was necessary to get maximum recovery during decortication so as to reduce the cost. Thus, considering all the facts related to the valuable kernel, decortication followed by drying of nut has been studied in detailed to obtain maximum recovery of good quality kernels. The RSM technology is applied for optimization of process parameters. Optimization of process parameters using response surface methodology (RSM) greatly overcomes the numbers of experimental trials generally undertaken for decorticating study of chironji nuts apart from maximizing the output of the system. The independent parameters for chironji nut decortication viz., drying temperature, drying time and clearance between discs were optimized using RSM. The drying temperature of 69.610 °C, drying time 163.87 min and clearance between disc 12 mm were found optimal. The whole kernel recovery, decorticating efficiency, unshelled nut, broken kernel and capacity of machine at optimized independent parameters were 27.72% (fraction of chironji kernel to shell 30.01% to 69.99%), 85.299 %, 11.50 %, 3.687 % and 6.232 kg/h respectively. The investigation is most useful to the small farmers, small entrepreneurs, Self-help group, Organic farming groups, Tribal group, A rural youth, Ladies bachat group who are involved in decortication of chironji nut."
