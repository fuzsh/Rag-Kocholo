        "text": "Because of this, black film history seems to begin in medias res, and some work is required to understand and appreciate aspects of these films that can be opaque and illegible to contemporary audiences. The oldest film in Pioneers is a comedy produced by the Chicago-based and white-owned Historical Feature Film Company (later purchased and distributed by Ebony Film Co.) for general release, Two Knights of Vaudeville (1915), which trades in racist tropes but is also a fascinating depiction of both the vaudeville stage and an imagined all-black performance space. In showcasing these two separate venues, Two Knights of Vaudeville enacts one of the enduring tensions of race film: its contested forms of exhibition. Comedy was particularly susceptible to critique, and Two Knights of Vaudeville and other shorts drew the ire of the Chicago Defender for their buffoonish portrayals, leading the paper to proclaim, “We want clean Race pictures or none at all.” Yet even for their detractors, the largely intraracial settings in which most race films were seen afforded kinds of representation that would have been—and were often—eschewed in interracial contexts. This is evident in the black press’s sharply critical reading of the general-release comedies produced by Ebony—also represented in Pioneers by Mercy, the Mummy Mumbled (1918) and A Reckless Rover (1918)—despite African American businessman Luther J. Pollard being at the helm. The Defender cautioned its readers, “Keep your money in your pocket and save that dime as well as your self-respect.” Complicated and persistent negotiations of performance and reception undergird these movies and others like them."
