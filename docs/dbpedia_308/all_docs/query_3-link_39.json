        "text": "Film photography is making a comeback. Despite the ubiquity of digital cameras, there's something about shooting on film that you just can't replicate. And while some may think it's all just a matter of nostalgia, that's not entirely true; film still has its own unique look and feel that digital can't touch.\n\nIf you're new to film photography or want to expand your knowledge, this guide is for you! We'll discuss the different types of camera films and formats available today. So let's get started!\n\nChoosing Film Type And Format\n\nPhotographic film is a flexible, transparent strip of cellulose coated with a light-sensitive emulsion used to create photographs or motion pictures. Before ordering film left, right, and center, you must know which type or format you’ll need. Then, open your browser; you’ll be ready to order after answering these few questions.\n\nWhat camera are you using?\n\nWhat shooting style do you prefer?\n\nDo you want to print your photos or view them on a screen?\n\nHow much money do you want to spend?\n\nThere are two main types of camera film: color and black and white. Within those categories, there are multiple formats to choose from. So let's take a closer look at each one.\n\nColor Film\n\nColor film is the most popular type of film for general photography. It's easy to use and can be processed at any standard photo lab. Plus, it comes in various styles to suit your needs.\n\nThe three most common types of color film are negative, slide, and instant. Negative film is by far the most popular; it can be printed or viewed on a screen once scanned, and it's easy to find. Slide film produces high-quality images but is more expensive and less versatile than negative film.\n\nNegative Film\n\nNegative film is the most popular type of color film. It's because it's easy to find, relatively inexpensive, and can be printed or viewed on a screen. Plus, negative film comes in various speeds (ASA/ISO), so you can choose the one that best suits your needs. High ISO values mean the film is more sensitive to light.\n\nSlide Film\n\nSlide film is less popular than negative film but can produce higher-quality images. Slide film is more expensive and less versatile than negative film, but it's still a good option for those who want the best image quality. Getting your exposure spot on is critical when shooting slide film.\n\nBlack and White Film\n\nBlack and white film is less popular than color film, but it still has its unique look and feel. You can process B&W film at most standard photo labs, but it's more expensive than color film.\n\nNegative black and white films are the most popular; they can be printed or viewed on a screen, and they are easy to find. Slide black and white film produce high-quality images, but it's more expensive and less versatile than negative film. They are also quite rare on the market these days.\n\nChoosing the correct type of camera film is an important decision. There are various factors to consider, including cost, quality, versatility, and availability. But ultimately, the best way to choose is by trying.\n\nCommon Film Formats and Sizes\n\nNow that you know the different frame types, it's time to choose a format. The most common film formats are 35mm, 120, and 4x5.\n\n35mm Film\n\n35mm film is the most popular format for general photography. This is because it's small and lightweight, making it easy to carry around. As a result, 35mm film is the format most often processed at Reformed Film Lab.\n\n110 Film:\n\nA small cartridge film format. Lomography still produces this type of film. We do not develop or scan this film. We recommend Boutique Film Lab in Tennessee for processing this format.\n\n120 Film (Medium Format)\n\n120 film is larger than 35mm film, but it's still relatively small and lightweight. As a result, 120 film produces higher-quality images than 35mm film.\n\nCommon 120 format cameras shoot in 6x4.5 format, 6x6, 6x7, 6x8, 6x9, and larger. Many professional photographers choose this format for a different depth of field experience and finer grain on their digital scans. Reformed Film Lab often processes this format.\n\nLarge Format Film (4x5, 8x10, or larger)\n\nThis film is for large format cameras that shoot sheet film. The film is individually loaded and shot one image at a time.\n\n8x10 film is the largest of the three standard formats. It's bulky and difficult to carry around, but it produces the highest-quality images. Unfortunately, 8x10 film is the most expensive and least versatile of the formats.\n\nLarge format film is expensive and can be difficult to find, but it produces high-quality images and is often used by those looking for the highest image quality. If you want this format processed, head on to Northeast Photographic.\n\nInstant Film (Polaroid & Fuji Instax)\n\nPolaroid and Fuji Instax are the two most popular types of instant film. Polaroid film is more expensive but produces that classic instant film look. Fuji Instax is less costly and depending on the camera you are using, produces better contrast and more accurate color than Polaroid film.\n\nInstant film is a fun and unique way to take photos. It’s perfect for parties, events, or anytime you want to capture a moment in time.\n\nProcessing Designations\n\nC-41 (color film): The most widely used color negative film developing procedure. Color film has many layers of light-sensitive emulsion, each sensitive to a different wavelength.\n\nWe process and scan (invert) this film, after which we send the digital files to customers. We can also print this format.\n\nB/W: Black and white film are processed differently from the color film. The value (or density) of light is the only thing that affects the black and white film, not the color. We process and scan B&W film, after which we send the digital images to the client and can print it out.\n\nE-6 (Slide Film): The chemical process used to develop slide film. E-6 film has many layers of light-sensitive emulsion. Next, the film is processed and scanned (not inverted as it’s a positive film. You can see the image directly on the film itself once processed). Finally, digital scans are emailed and sent to customers, and you can make prints.\n\nCross processing: Processing utilizing a chemical process different than the one intended for the film. To enhance contrast and generate random color changes, E6 film in C-41 chemistry is commonly processed using this method.\n\nYour One-Stop Film Shop"
