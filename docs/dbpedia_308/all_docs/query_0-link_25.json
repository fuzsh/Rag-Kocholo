        "text": "The movie 42 is all about Jackie Robinson and his experience playing in the major leagues. Robinson started on first base for the Dodgers, being the first team to play a black player in the since the 1880’s. Jackie Robinson and the Dodgers broke down a lot of barriers for African Americans in the MLB. In the movie it shows his struggles that he went through during the season. There were some changes in the film from what actually happened in real life, but its Hollywood what do you expect.\n\nJackie Robinson once said, \"There is not an American in this country free until every one of us is free\" -Jackie Robinson. The film, 42, was based on Jackie Robinson’s life as a segregated African American being signed to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team. During the film, it showed how Jackie Robinson demonstrated true courage and commendable restraint by letting his unmistakable talent silence the critics for him. The adaptation portrayed Jackie Robinson as a Negro League baseball player who never takes racism lying down. There were many similarities between the film and the events that lead up to Jackie Robinson’s fame; however, a number of characters and events were portrayed\n\n“In 1944, the sport was segregated, and African- Americans and whites played in separate leagues” (“Robinson” 3). This quote shows blacks and whites did not get along. “ Rickey knew there would be difficult times ahead for the young athlete, and so made Robinson promise to not fight back” (“Robinson” 3). This quote shows that the General Manager of the Dodgers knew that there would be problems.“ On April 15, 1947 (Jackie Robinson Day) making history as the first black athlete to play Major League Baseball” (“Robinson” 3). This quote shows that Jackie made history in the game of baseball and changed the world. The next topic will be A Name for\n\nI recently saw the film, 42, and I found many connections with our Sociology of Sport class. First and foremost, the movie was about the baseball legend, Jackie Robinson. Jack broke the baseball color barrier and was the first African American player allowed in Major League Baseball. He played for the Brooklyn Dodgers beginning in 1947. Jack was a strong, talented player, but he also had a mind of his own. He played with an attitude that would be taunting to other players. When he made it to the Montreal Royals in 1946, he had to quickly get rid of this taunting, smart attitude. He was the only black player in a time of hatred and prejudice in the United States. Although he\n\nThe movie 42 is a story about Jackie Robinson’s life as a baseball player, and how he broke the baseball color barrier by becoming the first African American player in the league. The story begins with Wendell Smith giving the audience background information about the United States and their segregation laws, and he brings it in comparison with baseball. He discusses how baseball was made up of 16 professional teams of all white players, but then Robinson comes in the picture. The movie then goes on to talk about Robinson’s career on the Brooklyn Dodgers, but mentioning before his time on the Kansas City Monarchs and the Montreal Royals. When Robinson advances to play with the Dodgers some of his fellow players sign a petition saying they refuse to play with him, but as the season progresses they become close friends with Robinson. Some examples of their kindness to him include backing him up when the manager of the Phillies said some racial slurs to Robinson. Another is when a Pittsburgh player hit him in the head, and his teammates stood up for him. The movie ends with some facts about other African American players joining the league, and a summary of the rest of Robinson’s career.\n\nCourage is doing what you know is the right thing even when it is hard to do. Jackie Robinson showed courage multiple I times throughout his career. In fact, his whole career would have gone down the drain if he did not have courage. As said in “Jackie Robinson All-Star” black men had little hope in the major leagues; Branch Rickey then came along and offered him a spot with the acceptance that he had to have the guts to NOT fight back. This meant that although Jackie was going to be taunted and humiliated he had to have the patience and courage to not retaliate so then he would give the whites a reason to respect black people. According to “The Noble Experiment”, this player had to be able to take abuse, name calling, rejections from both opponents and\n\nSince the abolition of slavery in the USA in 1883 and through the first half of the 20th Century, African Americans had been in a constant struggle to try and gain an equal footing in society. Like many aspects of American life, black sportsmen were segregated, and no African American had played professional baseball since 1884. For this reason, the integration of Jackie Robinson to the Brooklyn Dodgers as the first African American to play Major League baseball in the modern era had a grand impact on the entire country. From the moment that Dodgers owner, Branch Rickey decided that Robinson would break the colour lone, the history of sport and the history of African Americans would not be the same again. The importance of his integration and the effect it had on civil rights can be looked at in many different ways. It had great effect on the African American community, instilling pride and belief once again in the American Dream for many who had once thought it impossible. It also had significant importance for civil rights groups, and brought about a figure who would fight his peoples quest for equal rights until the day he died. It was a significant risk taken by both Rickey and Robinson, professionally and personally. But it was a risk that both in the short term for African American sport, and in the long run for African American civil rights, was ultimately well worth taking.\n\nThe movie that we viewed in class is 42: The Jackie Robinson Story directed by Brian Helgeland. It was released in 2013 as a pg-13 movie and is 2 hours 8 minutes long. This movie is a historical non-fiction drama about the baseball player, Jackie Robinson, and the struggles he endured as being a black man playing in major league baseball in the 1940s. The theme of the movie highlights the importance of relationships between people, with Jackie Robinson as the ultimate applicant for desegregated baseball. This movie’s purpose is to not make us feel shameful from our national shortcomings but feel pride in the triumph of Jackie Robinson.\n\n\"Over the decades, African American teams played 445-recorded games against white teams, winning sixty-one percent of them.\" (Conrads, pg.8) The Negro Leagues were an alternative baseball group for African American baseball player that were denied the right to play with the white baseball payers in the Major League Baseball Association. In 1920, the first African American League was formed, and that paved the way for numerous African American innovation and movements. Fences, and Jackie Robinson: The Biography, raises consciousness about the baseball players that have been overlooked, and the struggle they had to endure simply because of their color.\n\nBecoming the first African-American to break the racial barrier in a white supremacist sport like Major League Baseball during the 1940s when colored racism still occurred is an accomplishment like no other. Jackie Robinson faced numerous hardships and endured countless racial setbacks during his professional baseball career, but managed to set aside his frustrations and continue to emerge as a symbol of hope and unity for all. The makers of 42: The Jackie Robinson Story portray the story of his career as it demonstrates the struggle of race stereotyping during the 1940s and the interpersonal power struggles of being seen as an “equal”. “I'm not concerned with your liking or disliking me... All I ask is that you respect me as a human being” (Robinson) is a powerful message that I would like for you to keep in mind as you continue to read.\n\nJackie Robinson known as the man who broke the color barrier, was both a hero of baseball, and a hero for the fight against racism. He took two of the things Americans valued most: freedom and sports, and brought them to the grand stage. When we take what Robinson did and put it in perspective of when and where it occurred we see the true struggle, and see just how despicable and bitter this time was. It really highlights how the search for freedom and equality coincided with the country’s fight to hold on to segregation and racism.\n\nThe story of Jackie Robinson has become one of America's most iconic and inspiring stories. Since 1947, American history has portrayed Jackie Robinson as a hero, and he has been idolized as a role model to the African American baseball community. It is an unarguable fact that he was the first to tear down the color barriers within professional baseball. The topic of Robinson’s role in integration has long been a point of discussion amongst baseball historians. Researchers have accumulated thousands of accredited documents and interviews with friends and team mates such as short stop, Pee Wee Reese, and team owner, Branch Rickey. However, few journalists have asked why Robinson was selected and what was Branch\n\nAfter watching the movie 42, I have learned the struggles the Jackie Robinson had to go through to be a success baseball player in the 50´s. In the movie, it showed me the struggles he went through, what people thought about Jackie playing, and the segregation that was going on throughout that time in history. The most powerful scene in the movie in my opinion is, when Jackie Robinson got pulled up the big leagues. Up until that point, white people and black people did not play on the same team so many people would be hate for Jackie playing on a white people's team. In the scene, the general manger of the Brooklyn Dodgers told Jackie that he wanted a strong player that could not fight back than someone who would fight back. The manager knew\n\n“I'm not concerned with your liking or disliking me... All I ask is that you respect me as a human being, “ quoted by Jackie Robinson. This quote explains how Jackie was trying to just play because it was his interest and wanted to make a change. The audience thought he was not supposed to be on the ground playing because of his color. He was overall the first African-American baseball player to play in the major leagues and represented the society as well. Many people honor Jackie Robinson and try to demonstrate how he lived as an African player in the baseball leagues. Every author has a purpose for writing a certain piece, In the movie 42 and the text in the newsela article, “Sports Stars: Jackie Robinson” have similarities and differences because of the author’s and director’s purpose."
