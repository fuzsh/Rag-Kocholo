        "text": "With all the advancements in modern moviemaking – from unfathomably large screens and bone-shaking sound systems in movie theaters to absurdly high-definition camera technology, to hyperrealistic, bordering on the unsettling, progress in computer-generated imagery (CGI) – it’s understandable why a lot of moviegoers might overlook the classics from the black and white era. To make a contemporary analogy, the films of yesteryear, as opposed to those of today, might be akin to walking around with a Razor flip phone as opposed to an iPhone.\n\nUpdated July 20th, 2023: If you enjoy watching timeless black and white classics that continue to dazzle movie enthusiasts, you'll be happy to know this article has been updated with additional content.\n\nRegardless of all the technological advancements in recent decades, the art of filmmaking is, and always has been, based upon one simple foundation: a compelling story portrayed by talented performers. And while there are a lot of films from the black and white era which many moviegoers have been sleeping on simply because of our modern aversion to anything considered old and outdated, many of these classics are classics for a reason, and they still hold up today. So, here’s a handful worth checking out.\n\n13 The Night of the Hunter\n\nUnsettling in its exploration of human wickedness, The Night of the Hunter fuses American film noir and German expressionism in a unique brew. This movie is a sinister tale of a pretending preacher ruthlessly pursuing two children who are privy to their deceased father's stolen treasure's location. The striking black-and-white aesthetics heighten the suspenseful and evocative narrative, casting a spectral, dreamlike aura.\n\nRobert Mitchum's representation of Reverend Harry Powell is an unforgettable fragment of cinematic history. Such a troubling depiction of evil persistently reverberates in cultural dialogues concerning fictional antagonists. The character's depiction of humanity's dark side has perpetuated its appeal over time.\n\n12 On the Waterfront\n\nA searing critique of union corruption, On the Waterfront is a masterful creation of Elia Kazan. This gritty story interweaves the struggle between personal conscience and societal unity, saturating it with profound socio-political commentary. Despite its mid-twentieth-century backdrop, its vivid illustration of societal maladies remains arresting and relevant due to the evergreen character of its central themes.\n\nMarlon Brando's amazing portrayal of Terry Malloy, the disenchanted former boxer, secured him an Oscar. On the Waterfront has metamorphosed into a cult phenomenon. The film's impact on cinematography and its depiction of individual moral combat against institutionalized corruption affirm its agelessness.\n\n11 Sunset Boulevard\n\nDelving deep into the Hollywood apparatus, Sunset Boulevard is Billy Wilder's creation. The narrative weaves the tales of a forgotten silent movie actress yearning for her lost stardom and an aspiring scriptwriter pursuing triumph.\n\nSunset Boulevard's discourse on fame's transient nature, Hollywood's cut-throat landscape, and the tragedy of growing old continues to be riveting and germane. The film's grim perspective on Hollywood and the human predicament feels surprisingly modern, confirming its place as an everlasting masterpiece.\n\nRelated: 10 Best Movies That Explore the Dark Side of Fame\n\n10 Metropolis\n\nFritz Lang's Metropolis is a pioneering beacon in the cinematic world, with its visionary narrative and groundbreaking visuals. This futuristic urban dystopia features breathtaking architectural scenery, novel special effects, and enthralling characters, marking a considerable turning point in the science fiction genre's development.\n\nThe long-standing impact of Metropolis is immeasurable. The movie went on to inspire and serve as a base for many of the themes and ideas witnessed in modern dystopian sci-fi masterpieces. Themes of class struggle and dehumanization in the movie reverberate in contemporary society. The sharp class divisions and worker exploitation echo modern discussions about income disparity and labor rights, underscoring the film's enduring relevance.\n\n9 12 Angry Men\n\nAn impressive display of character analysis and mounting tension, Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men epitomizes courtroom drama. The movie dissects the human psyche as twelve jurors deliberate on a murder case, spotlighting the dynamics of uncertainty, conviction, and persuasion in the face of rising conflict.\n\nIn the current socio-political landscape, 12 Angry Men maintains remarkable relevance. Its scrutiny of prejudice within decision-making and group interactions profoundly resonates in a period marked by divisive dialogue and heightened demand for justice and equality, thereby solidifying its position as an eternal classic.\n\n8 Seven Samurai\n\nAkira Kurosawa is still considered one of the all-time greatest and most influential film directors to this day. And more than 60 years since the release of one of Kurosawa’s most enduring cinematic masterpieces, Seven Samurai, filmmakers of today are still taking notes.\n\nThe film essentially introduced the world to the commonplace “assembling a team to defeat a common enemy” trope. Ring a bell? Ahem, Avengers; the Star Wars saga; the Fast and the Furious franchise; the list goes on. Not to mention, the film was revolutionary in its cinematography, editing, fight sequences, and more – all of which still make it worth a watch today.\n\n7 The Maltese Falcon\n\nBased on the 1930 novel of the same name by author Dashiell Hammett, the 1941 film adaptation of The Maltese Falcon is a classic in that it was one of the first to embrace the crime noir genre. That means that the film, and director John Huston’s innovative blueprint for the genre, inspired countless films in the years and decades that followed – from Chinatown (1974) to Mulholland Drive (2001) to Blade Runner (1982), and beyond.\n\nThe Maltese Falcon has had many imitators over the decades, but none come close to being as iconic and inventive. As for the film’s enduring legacy, it was added to the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nRelated: Best Film Noirs of the 40s and 50s, Ranked\n\n6 It’s a Wonderful Life\n\nFor many families, it’s tradition to watch It’s a Wonderful Life around the holidays. It airs on countless TV channels during that time of year and, in a lot of places across the country, in theaters, too.\n\nThe film follows George Bailey, a depressed and suicidal businessman played by Jimmy Stewart, as he is visited by Clarence, an angel trying to earn his wings by showing George what the world would’ve been like had he never been born, and how valuable his presence is to so many people. It's those themes of joy and merriment, coupled with the fact that its set around Christmastime, that continue to ignite the holiday spirit for viewers year after year.\n\n5 Psycho\n\nAs (arguably) Alfred Hitchcock’s best and most beloved film, Psycho (1960) is one of cinema’s greatest achievements of all time, often making it close to the top spot of “must see” films for any serious film buff. But it’s one scene in particular that almost everyone – even people who haven’t seen the film – have engrained in their brains.\n\nThe infamous “shower scene” is a touchstone of pop culture. And it’s not just due to the pure terror of the scene; Hitchcock created one of the most suspenseful scenes ever filmed with the innovative use of jump cuts, coupled with the screeching violin soundtrack that still sends shivers down the spines of viewers some 60 years later.\n\n4 The Grapes of Wrath\n\nJohn Steinbeck’s 1939 novel, The Grapes of Wrath, is considered one of the many literary masterpieces worthy of contending for the title of the Great American Novel. So, when it came time to create a film version of the story, it had to be good. And thankfully, director John Ford pulled it off in his 1940 adaptation.\n\nThe tale is quite grim – it deals with severe poverty, the dust bowl, the trials and tribulations of western migration, etc. – but the cinematography and the acting (specifically by silver screen legend, Henry Fonda) make the film an enduring classic. Set during the Great Depression, this enduring classic is still guaranteed to captivate audiences today.\n\n3 To Kill a Mockingbird\n\nHarper Lee’s beloved 1960 novel is still taught in English classes today. All these years later, middle school students are still familiar with To Kill a Mockingbird's main characters: Scout, Jem, Boo Radley, and Atticus Finch. The themes of racism, equality, and moral righteousness are still all too relatable today.\n\nThe 1962 film, directed by Robert Mulligan, holds nearly as much weight as the book does. For a lot of students, this is their favorite book they read in school. And the cherry on top is, after they finish reading and discussing the book, they get to watch the characters come to life in the film version.\n\nRelated: Here Are the Most Romantic Classical Hollywood Movies\n\n2 Casablanca\n\nEighty years since its release, lines from Michael Curtiz’s Casablanca are still embedded in everyday vernacular. Phrases like “We’ll always have Paris,” and “Here’s looking at you, kid” are commonplace; even though most people who say these lines probably don’t even know where they came from. If there’s any such sign that a film has had a cultural impact so deep, so long-lasting, then this is it.\n\nCasablanca is often included near the top slot on lists of the “best movies of all time” and for good reason. It’s got incredible acting from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman; it’s got a love story for the ages; and it’s all wrapped up in a tidy bow by expert directing, courtesy of Curtiz.\n\n1 Citizen Kane\n\nAsk anyone who knows even a sliver of silver screen history, and they’ll tell you: Citizen Kane is one of the absolute GOATs. The story, centered on the life of fictional publishing tycoon Charles Foster Kane, who is based on the very real publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst, has become so well-known that just about anyone you speak to will understand what \"Rosebud\" means.\n\nOrson Welles’ 1941 masterpiece was so innovative in terms of cinematography, so ahead of its time with cutting-edge movie-making techniques, and bolstered by a plot that still haunts viewers today. While Wells may have never reached the same heights of storytelling again, there is no doubt that Citizen Kane secured his place in the pantheon of iconic filmmakers."
