        "text": "Black and white film is one of the oldest photography tools and incredibly easy to work withâa big reason why beginning-level photography classes only teach students to shoot in black and white. Black and white film was used to capture some of the worldâs most iconic photographs and it remains extremely popular to this day. Monochrome photography forces a photographer to focus on how light, shadows, and shapes interact within a frame to create an image. Knowing how to shoot black and white film will go a long way in helping your photographic eye and ultimately can help your digital photographic work too. Plus, you donât need much to get started. A basic 35mm film camera wonât cost much on the secondary market and the film is typically cheaper than color film cameras.\n\nBest fine-grain: Fuji Neopan Acros 100 II\n\nBest for beginners: Ilford HP5+\n\nBest high-speed: lford DELTA 3200\n\nBest high contrast: JCH Street Pan ISO 400\n\nBest grainy: Kodak Tri-X 400TX\n\nTypes of black and white film\n\nBlack and white films are either categorized as tabular-grain or traditional-grain. Traditional grain films can be thought of as the original film format and include films like Kodak Tri-X and Ilford HP5+. Tabular-grain films first hit the market in the â80s and create images that provide more detail by having a finer grain.\n\nBlack and white films also vary by speed, which is very similar to setting the ISO on your digital camera. Lower-speed films with a rating of 100 typically arenât as sensitive to light and have finer grain and work best when shot on sunny days, mid-range films in the 400 speed range are good for overcast days or indoors, while high-speed films at 3200 are best for nighttime black-and-white photography or situations where you want to use their grainy look for creative purposes. As you shoot more, youâll likely discover which film stock is your favorite.\n\nThings to consider when purchasing black and white film\n\nFinding the right film stock for you has a lot to do with your personal aesthetics as a photographer. You should also consider what subject you plan to be shooting and what photography equipment you have at your disposal. The majority of consumer films are somewhere between the 100-400 range and an excellent option if you are shooting with a fully manual camera and plan to do most of your work outdoors. If you are more of a night owl and plan to be shooting at night a high-speed 1600 or 3200 film might be a better option for you. If you are using a film camera with a flash and shooting somewhere poorly lit a 400 speed film will probably do just fine to help you balance your subject and background.\n\nIn addition to grain and film speed many films have unique characteristics in how they interpret color. Some films will be very contrasty, while other film stocks will represent the world in much more subtle shades of gray. How you shoot and develop your film will also have a lot of influence on the final product.\n\nMany film photographers enjoy shooting their films at a different ISO than whatâs listed on the box in a process called pushing or pulling. If you have a roll of 400 speed film you can push it by setting your camera to a higher ISO speed. Youâll be intentionally underexposing your film and then making up for the difference in development. Pushing film works best in even lighting conditions. Pulling film is when you shoot it at a lower ISO than what it is rated for and will typically reduce the contrast of your film. If you are pushing or pulling a roll of film make sure to tell your lab so they can adjust the development times on your rolls.\n\nBest black and white film: Reviews & recommendations\n\nBest fine-grain: Fuji Neopan Acros 100 II\n\nFuji Neopan Acros 100 II offers incredibly fine grain that renders details beautifully. It has a nice amount of contrast and is very sharpâmaking it a nice versatile film for a variety of subject matter. Although it’s a 100 speed film, it can easily be pushed to 400 for even more contrasty images. It can be the best black-and-white film for landscapes if you like that poppy look.\n\nBest for beginners: Ilford HP5+\n\nA film stock long favored by first-year photography students, Ilford HP5+ is extremely easy to work with and gives beginners lots of leeway with their exposures. Itâs on the grainier side and is a great film for learning the basics of how light and shadow interact to make a picture. Itâs very close to the digital monochrome look in most cameras and photo editing software and itâs a lot cheaper than other films. The low-contrast look makes it some of the best black-and-white film for portraits.\n\nBest high-speed: lford DELTA 3200\n\nIf you love photographing nightlife this is the film for you. This 3200 speed film can be pushed really high without losing details and has a beautiful grainy aesthetic. Itâs great for shooting in low-light scenarios like concerts or bars even without the use of a flash. It can be a little expensive, but if you are going on lots of late-night adventures with your camera you will thank yourself for paying extra.\n\nBest high contrast: JCH Street Pan ISO 400\n\nThis high-contrast black-and-white film was designed with street photographers in mind. This panchromatic film stock is excellent at cutting through the haze and fog common in big cities to create images that are incredibly sharp, have very little grain, and are very moody. This film has a very thin emulsion making some of the best black-and-white films for scanning.\n\nBest grainy: Kodak Tri-X 400TX\n\nWhile some black-and-white films strive to minimize grain, others just embrace it. Kodak Tri-X 400 is one of the worldâs most recognizable film stocks and a favorite of photojournalists and documentary photographers. It has a gritty look from all the grain and if you are developing on your own at home, this is an easy one. If you are ready to embrace the film grain this is the film for you. Many famous shooters started with some basic photography gear and a couple of rolls of Tri-X.\n\nFAQs\n\nFinal thoughts about black and white film\n\nEven if you are typically a digital photographer, shooting a roll of black-and-white film can be a fun way to spark your creativity. There is something really appealing about shooting pictures and not knowing exactly what they look like and shooting in black and white will change the way you look at the world around you. Once you start shooting film we guess that you wonât want to stop."
