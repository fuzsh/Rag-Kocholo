        "text": "Hidden Gems\n\nHow often do you see a white teacher transform a class full of recalcitrant students from different races and backgrounds to a class full of great individuals? That is what happened in the movie Freedom Writers. Erin Gruwell is the white teacher and the students are class 203 of Woodrow Wilson High School. At the beginning, class 203 is just a bunch of people who hate learning and have no future. However, it all changes since the presence of Erin Gruwell.

By saying the truth, she betrays her own people but she does the right and that shows how she has changed and developed her empathy. According to Paul Wong’s article about empathy he notes that “… individuals are more likely to be empathic to others, when they have experienced many hardships and are well acquainted with sorrows and sufferings.” This is what I see in the movie, Marcus and Eva realize that they all came from the same background; that they must fight for their lives, dignity, and existence. Thus, both Marcus and Eva develop what Wong would call the “experiential empathy” which is a type of empathy that is developed when one has experienced other’s difficulties.
