The film was based on the 1943 novel Commandos by Elliott Arnold, adapted by George Sklar, with a screenplay by Melvin Levy and Lewis Meltzer. It stars Merle Oberon and Brian Aherne.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nNicole Larsen (Merle Oberon) is a member of the Norwegian resistance in a small town, about to marry the Nazi commandant (Carl Esmond). When his superiors begin to suspect her, the Allies land an assassin to kill him: her former lover, Capt. Allan Lowe (Brian Aherne).\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMerle Oberon as Nicole Larsen\n\nBrian Aherne as Capt. Allan Lowell\n\nCarl Esmond as Maj.

Kurt von Elser\n\nByron Foulger as Shopkeeper (uncredited)\n\nMiles Mander as Col. Wallace (uncredited)\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst Comes Courage had the working title of \"Attack by Night\".[1] The film was originally to have been set in France, but was changed to Norway because of the public's interest at the time in the occupation of that country.[1]\n\nWhen director Dorothy Arzner had an attack of pleurisy, she was replaced by Charles Vidor.[1] The film would turn out to be Arzner's final film.[2]\n\nSome scenes were filmed on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, with military units providing extras for the scenes of the commando attack.[1]\n\nOberon and Aherne had played the leads in Beloved Enemy in 1936, with David Niven in a large supporting role. By 1943, when this early film about commandos was produced, Niven (according to his memoir \"The Moon’s a Balloon\") was an actual commando fighting in World War II.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
