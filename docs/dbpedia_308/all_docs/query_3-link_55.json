        "text": "Summary\n\nOld black and white sci-fi movies shaped the genre as we know it today, paving the way for modern blockbusters.\n\nThe legacy of iconic black and white movies like Metropolis and Godzilla can be seen in many of sci-fi's most revered classics.\n\nSome old sci-fi movies are just as entertaining today as they were almost 100 years ago.\n\nOld black and white movies are usually seen as outdated these days, but many of them helped shape the future of sci-fi. The genre simply wouldn't be where it is today without the legacy of sci-fi movies from before color film became widespread. Some of the first movies ever ventured into sci-fi, showing that the history of film and the history of sci-fi are inextricably linked. Some black and white movies never grow old, no matter how many decades pass. Looking back at some influential sci-fi classics shows that they have more in common with today's sci-fi hits than people might realize.\n\nOld sci-fi movies aren't just notable for their historical significance. The best of the best can still be just as compelling as modern blockbusters. Visual effects have advanced so far over the years that black and white sci-fi movies often pale in comparison to 21st century movies, but films with great stories and intriguing concepts don't need the latest cutting-edge CGI technology. Filmmakers from the black and white era used creative approaches to their films which allowed them to tell fascinating high-concept stories without the need for modern technology.\n\n10 A Trip To The Moon (1902)\n\nThe first sci-fi movie helped construct the language of cinema\n\nDespite its conventional framing and blocking, A Trip to the Moon helped distinguish cinema as its own art form.\n\nGeorges Méliès' A Trip to the Moon is widely regarded as the first sci-fi movie ever. Like many silent films, it is full of light humor and techniques which seem ripped directly from stage production. Despite its conventional framing and blocking, A Trip to the Moon helped distinguish cinema as its own art form. It wasn't called sci-fi at the time because sci-fi simply didn't exist in film. It has had a lasting impact beyond the genre, and the image of the lunar capsule landing on the face of the moon is one of the most iconic in film history.\n\n9 Metropolis (1927)\n\nA German expressionist masterpiece that still influences filmmakers almost a century later\n\nThe first feature-length sci-fi movie is still one of the best, and it helped craft the filmmaking language of the sci-fi genre which is still in use today. Metropolis is packed with stunning visuals, drawing inspiration from Art Deco architecture and opera to create an image of a bustling futuristic cityscape. Metropolis was revolutionary for its social commentary, which helped sci-fi movies catch up with literature. Before Metropolis, the genre was mostly escapist fantasy. In the years after, it started inching toward more substantial forms of storytelling. Metropolis is one of the most influential German expressionist movies ever.\n\n8 Godzilla (1954)\n\nThe original kaiju movie created a cinematic icon\n\nGodzilla created the kaiju genre, and it spawned one of the most successful movie franchises of all time. The original is still one of the most compelling Godzilla movies, as it fits perfectly into its post-war Japan setting. Even though this context has long been forgotten by countless adaptations, Godzilla is more popular than ever, and the MonsterVerse is a huge box office hit. Godzilla's legacy extends beyond just kaiju movies, however. The film's depiction of man's response to overwhelming threats has inspired sci-fi movies about aliens, asteroids, and everything in between.\n\n7 Invasion Of The Body Snatchers (1956)\n\nAlien invasion movies were never the same after Invasion of the Body Snatchers\n\nAs well as its 1978 remake, the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers is one of the best alien invasion movies ever. The film follows a small-town doctor who slowly realizes that all of his neighbors are being replaced by emotionless blank copies. Like many sci-fi movies from the same era, Invasion of the Body Snatchers can be seen as an allegory about the spread of communism, but it can also apply to the more general fear of isolation and losing touch with reality. Invasion of the Body Snatchers introduced a new type of movie monster.\n\n6 The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951)\n\nThe Robert Wise movie approached aliens in a new way\n\nAlien invasion movies are a hugely popular sci-fi subgenre, and The Day the Earth Stood Still helped shape the conventions of the genre as it is today. Many other movies now depict aliens with ambiguous intentions and a fundamental barrier which stops humans fully understanding them. Just think of Arrival or Edge of Tomorrow. The Day the Earth Stood Still is also notable for how perfectly its allegory lines up with contemporary Cold War anxieties. Alien invasions should always try to reflect some broader societal fear, like how Village of the Damned preys upon man's parental insecurities.\n\n5 The Fly (1958)\n\nThe Fly blends sci-fi and horror expertly\n\nThe Fly is a brilliant articulation of the common fear that technology is advancing faster than humanity can keep up with it. It was famously remade by David Cronenberg in 1986, but the original still holds up to scrutiny. The practical effects are impressive for the era, and the story is surprisingly relevant to modern cultural anxieties. The Fly makes sure to tell a compelling human story before wading too far into sci-fi make-believe. The half-fly-half-human hybrid doesn't appear until over an hour into the film, and this makes the impact all the more shocking.\n\n4 Creature From The Black Lagoon (1954)\n\nA creature feature that is more than just cheap thrills\n\nCreature From the Black Lagoon is part of a tradition of creature features which suggest that there may be strange unknown creatures right here on Earth. The monster, known as Gill-Man, has shaped creature design in sci-fi and horror for years.The Shape of Water is one recent take on the creature's story. Guillermo del Toro's Oscar-winner puts a new spin on the tale, but the creature is instantly recognizable. To different viewers, Gill-Man's story can represent completely different themes, ranging from environmental destruction to power dynamics between genders.\n\n3 Frankenstein (1931)\n\nAn iconic adaptation of a revolutionary novel\n\nMary Shelley's Frankenstein is one of the most influential horror and sci-fi novels ever written, perfectly encapsulating the moral struggle over man's relationship with the natural order. The Boris Karloff film remains the most iconic screen version of Frankenstein, giving the monster a blend of menace and innocence. Frankenstein could be more relevant than ever in the modern world, as debates over artificial intelligence and gene editing rage on. More and more sci-fi movies have been grappling with these topics. It's hard to imagine Ex Machina, Blade Runner or Poor Things existing without Frankenstein.\n\nGuillermo del Toro's new Frankenstein adaptation is set to begin filming this year, with Jacob Elordi playing the monster.\n\n2 King Kong (1933)\n\nKong was not a typical movie monster at the time\n\nLooking back at the original King Kong movie shows how far the character has evolved over the last 90 years and 12 movies. Still, the emotional core of the story is intact from the very first movie. Kong is a gargantuan beast previously unknown to science, but his human captors see him only as a means of making money. King Kong influenced plenty of creature features, showing that destructive monsters aren't quite as interesting as those with a heart. The upcoming Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire will be Kong's thirteenth movie.\n\n1 Flash Gordon (1936)\n\nThe space opera is a noted favorite among sci-fi writers and directors\n\nThe original series of films were immensely popular, and they had an impact on sci-fi writers and filmmakers for decades. Star Wars and Star Trek both owe a lot to Flash Gordon."
