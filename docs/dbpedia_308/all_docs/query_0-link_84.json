        "text": "WRPR 107A001, WRPR 107A002 Comparative Mythologies: Close Reading Myths from Around the Globe\n\nA. De Paul\n\nIn this course, we will examine mythological literature from across the globe, with an emphasis on narratives of creation, destruction, and emergence. We will encounter well-treated myths such as those of Greek, Norse, and Judaic origin, as well as less oft-discussed myths from African, Japanese, and Native American origin, among others. We will take a comparative approach to these narratives, employing close reading to identify and examine themes such as symbolism, cultural knowledge, gender commentary, and environmentalism. Our critical lens for these examinations will derive from myth-theorists such as Joseph Campbell, Northrop Frye, and William G. Doty. These investigations will lead us to examine larger questions about the origins and functions of mythology.\n\nWRPR 111B001 Power, Place and Film\n\nN. Ladva\n\nThis course will take a thematic approach to the introduction of film by exploring the intersections of power and place and considering the impact of forces like immigration, colonialism, and racism. By considering how places—communities, cities, countries—are changed by the people in them, perceptions others have of them, and the distribution of power across them, we will study film’s unique role in both the generation and representation of power and place. In addition to critical and theoretical readings, readings will include Satrapi’s Persepolis, and Deveare Smith’s Twilight Los Angeles; films will include Hugo, Black Panther, Rabbit-Proof Fence, Argo and My Name is Khan. [Counts towards the minor in Visual Studies]\n\nWRPR 113A001, WRPR 113B001 Women and War\n\nK. Whitcomb\n\nWomen have traditionally been viewed as passive actors in the male-dominated field of war. They serve as catalysts for war, as in the case of Helen of Troy, or spoils of conquest. In this course, we will explore both the well-known traditional martial roles assigned to women in the Classical world, as well as the less-discussed, and perhaps more surprising, roles: warrior, spy, aggressor. With this ancient Mediterranean background as our basis, we will turn our attention in the final weeks of the course to reflecting on the roles of women in modern wars. In what ways have womens roles developed and shifted? In what ways have they stayed the same? What views do the (predominantly male) authors writing about women in war express? By examining primary sources from the Iliad, to the plays of Aristophanes and 21st-century media reports, we will investigate the various roles that women have held in war. Are they catalysts and victims? Certainly. But they are also warriors and deal-makers. Our discussions will be informed by the growing body of modern scholarship on ancient women in war, particularly studies on the prevalence of warrior women/queens, the necessary, but often overlooked roles of women as supportive figures to male warriors, and womens perspectives on their roles in war. [Counts towards the minor in Classical Studies.]\n\nWRPR 118A001 Portraits of Disability and Difference\n\nK. Lindgren\n\nRosemarie Garland-Thomson writes: “staring is an interrogative gesture that asks what’s going on and demands the story. The eyes hang on, working to recognize what seems illegible, order what seems unruly, know what seems strange.” In this seminar we will explore visual and literary portraits and self-portraits of bodies marked by difference, bodies that often elicit stares, as well as bodies and minds with non-visible differences. We will ask: What kinds of stories are told about these bodies? How do memoirs and self-portraits by people with disabilities draw on and challenge traditions of life writing and portraiture? How does this work enlarge cultural and aesthetic views of embodiment, disability, and difference? How do portraits of disability engage differences of gender, race, and class? This year the course will include a substantial unit on deafness, Deaf culture, and Deaf schools. Students in this course will receive preference for enrollment in American Sign Language 1, but you are not required to enroll in ASL. (Taking the sequence ASL 1 and 2 fulfills the language requirement). Through close readings of essays, memoirs, novels, paintings, and photographs, students will hone their descriptive and interpretive skills and develop their ability to craft clear and persuasive arguments.

Rogers\n\nThe landmark victory of Brown v. Board (1954) was popularly understood to symbolize the ability of all students, particularly Black students, to have access to high-quality schooling and shatter the grip of segregation in our schools and public institutions. Seventy years after Brown, public schools across the country are still deeply segregated and unequal. As R. L’Heureux Lewis-McCoy recently offered, “The segregation that was meant to be uprooted with the Brown decision not only persisted, but it has grown, and today, we stand at a critical juncture—the promise of education as opportunity that has existed for more than 100 years is on the verge of being no more.” In this writing seminar, we will explore 19th, 20th, and 21st century perspectives emerging from Black-led education organizing in the wake of the 70th Anniversary of the Brown v. Board decision to inform how we understand the purpose of education in our own lives and as a social anchor. Through three acts, we will consider: (1) Black education antecedents and experiments that took place through Reconstruction up until the dawn of Brown v. Board; (2) a multidimensional exploration of Brown v. Board I (1954) and II (1955) decisions; and (3) contemporary realities of U.S. public education for Black communities, including ongoing grassroots experiments and interventions needed to bring about an inclusive, equitable, and relevant education. Course readings will include anchor texts for each act, combined with supplemental articles, essays, and multimedia artifacts. Assignments will involve essays that build on personal experiences in education toward defining dimensions of equity and concluding with arguments for how a proposed intervention could expand equity and inclusiveness in U.S. schools.[Counts towards the concentration in African and Africana Studies.]\n\nWRPR 120A001, 120B001 Evolutionary Arguments from Eugenics to CRISPR\n\nC. Schilling\n\nFrom the eugenics movement of the early twentieth century to the present, scientists, scholars, citizens, politicians, ethicists, disability activists, and others have argued about the ethics and consequences of policies and technologies for preventing certain inherited traits and enhancing others in the human population. Ever since Darwin’s theory of natural selection, we’ve been asking how selection could rely less on chance and more on deliberate human choices to create what some have considered “better” human beings. Eugenicists assumed that better societies would follow. After looking at landmark moments in the history of state-sponsored early eugenics, we’ll ask whether recent “personal” reproductive genetic technologies—from diagnosing pre-implantation embryos to CRISPR—revive the assumptions and ethical questions raised during the early eugenic programs. We’ll ask how these technologies affect relations between parents and children, social pressures to create certain kinds of children, social and civic relations, equity and opportunity, human freedom, and our responsibility to future generations. To answer those and the questions you’ll think of, we’ll track a range of favorable and skeptical evolutionary arguments in ethics, the law, social movements, and popular culture. Sources will include print and online sources, photos, and films (including GATTACA). What’s most at stake in our inquiry is who we include in the human community. [Counts towards the minor in Health Studies]\n\nWRPR 130B001, WRPR 130B002 B-Sides + Blues Visions: Reviewing Black Popular Culture for Social Transformation\n\nC. Rogers\n\nIn a classic essay interrogating cultural organizing in the 21st Century, journalist Jeff Chang (2010) establishes:\n\n“Culture is the space in our national consciousness filled by music, books, sports, movies, theater, visual arts, and media. It is the realm of ideas, images, and stories -- the narrative in which we are immersed every day. It is where people make sense of the world, where ideas are introduced, values are inculcated, and emotions are attached to concrete change. Cultural change is often the dress rehearsal for political change. Or put in another way, political change is the final manifestation of cultural shifts that have already occurred.”\n\nHis words spoke to the critical and historical role of cultural production (especially hip-hop) for leveraging grassroots movements for progressive social change. In this writing seminar, we will investigate the relationship between cultural production arising from Black communities and its resonance within their visions/actions for social transformation. Through three acts, we will consider: (1) the multiplicity of the role of popular culture in our lives beyond its value as a commodity; (2) a survey of historical 20th Century examples upon which popular music arising from Black communities served to amplify visions of social transformation; and (3) review and speculate upon the possibilities of contemporary popular culture artifacts to inspire present-day mobilizing for progressive social change. Course readings will include anchor texts combined with supplemental articles, essays, and multimedia artifacts. Assignments will involve essays that build on formative personal experiences with popular culture toward articulating historical arguments for the social afterlife of a popular culture artifact. The final assignment concludes with seminar participants establishing a contemporary argument for the utility of a self-selected popular culture artifact to support a current mobilization for justice-oriented outcomes.

Using visual and verbal images, this course explores such diverse aspects of the West as cowboys, cartography, water rights, race and social class, technology, religion, prostitution, and landscape painting.\n\n135B001 Health and the Humanities\n\nJ. Libow\n\nOver the last few decades, “medical humanities” and “health humanities” programs have been popping up in health professional schools across the country. In these courses, students study works of art, literature, history, and philosophy in the hopes that these endeavors will help them become better healthcare providers. But what exactly are “the humanities”? How do they differ from “the arts” or “humanity” itself? And how does a humanistic education benefit healthcare providers and their patients? In this seminar, we will examine poetry, fiction, non-fiction, drama, and film that invites us to reconsider health through a humanistic lens. Throughout the semester, we will pay particular attention to the ways in which race, gender, and class shape experiences of health, illness, and healthcare. Texts include Yaa Gyasi, Transcendent Kingdom; Margaret Edson, Wit; Steven Sonderbergh, Contagion; Lulu Wang, The Farewell and other seleted short stories, films and poetry. [Counts towards the minor in Health Studies].\n\nWRPR 138B001, WRPR 138B002 Race and Gender in American Horror Film and Fiction\n\nC. McNair\n\nn this course, students will close-read narrative and filmic depictions of transcending, transgressing, and violating racial borders, thinking about what these narratives reflect and what they produce when it comes to understandings of race, gender and sexuality. Well look at the effects of both transgressive and progressive figurations of racial mixture and mixed race individuals, considering what functions these discourses play in larger schemas of American politics, ideologies and affects. This course centers the black-white mixture and its prohibition and celebration as a nexus of American and globalized notions of race and gender. Well think about how definitions of blackness and whiteness spring from representations of these boundaries transgressions, both in cases where blackness and whiteness come together through violation, and when they come together through the will to bridge or transcend the confines of race. Well hone in on the ways in which antiblackness and white supremacy are reproduced through transgressive and progressive reproduction across the borders of black and white, asking, if race has been debunked as a biological/ scientific fiction, how does it persist as a set of categories that can be mixed? Students will have the opportunity to think about discursively constituted material reality, liminality, subjectivity, blackness, whiteness, the relationship between race and gender, trauma, intimacy and desire. Texts include Gayle Jones, Corregidora (1970), Nelle Larsen, Passing (1929); Heidi Durrow, The Girl Who Fell From the Sky (2011). [Counts towards the concentrations in African and Africana Studies and Gender and Sexuality Studies]\n\nWRPR 141A001 The Ear and Electronic Sound\n\nM. O'Hare\n\nThe 20th century marks a time of rapid transformation in the world’s conception of sound, music, listening, and communication. Technologies that electronically store, transmit, and generate sonic information have caused a fundamental shift in how and why we listen. Through research, discussion, and personal reflection students will deepen their experience of listening while investigating the illuminating history of audio technologies, electronic music, and our evolving relationship to the auditory.\n\nWRPR 142A001, 002 Defining Blackness: Passing, Mixing, (Re-)Producing: Race & Intimacy in American Discourse\n\nC. McNair\n\nIn this course, students will close-read narrative and filmic depictions of transcending, transgressing, and violating racial borders, thinking about what these narratives reflect and what they produce when it comes to understandings of race, gender and sexuality. We’ll look at the effects of both transgressive and progressive figurations of “racial mixture” and mixed race individuals, considering what functions these discourses play in larger schemas of American politics, ideologies and affects. This course centers the black-white “mixture” and its prohibition and celebration as a nexus of American and globalized notions of race and gender. We’ll think about how definitions of blackness and whiteness spring from representations of these boundaries’ transgressions, both in cases where blackness and whiteness come together through violation, and when they come together through the will to bridge or transcend the confines of race.

De Paul\n\nIndigenous stories are all too often excluded from the common curriculum. This course will examine important literary themes through the cultural stories of the Lenape Native Americansthe indigenous people of eastern PA, southern NY, NJ, and northern DE. Students will experience Lenape stories through oral and written traditions, including cosmological and etiological myths, trickster tales, stories addressing settler contact and colonization, and wisdom anecdotes from Lenape elders. Through these stories, we will examine themes of myth theory, culture transmission, contact zones, adaptation & translation theory, colonization, oral vs. written tradition, and selection bias in canonical curriculum. This course is taught by Chief Adam Waterbear DePaul, Tribal Storykeeper and Director of Education of the Lenape Nation of Pennsylvania.\n\nWRPR 150A002 Approaches to Literary Analysis: Writing the Weather, Reading the Climate\n\nD. Allor\n\nHow does literature help us understand the relationship between humans and our changing ecosystems? This course will explore literary depictions of how people understand their environments through representations of the weather and the climate in several periods and genres of literature. How do writers depict the weather—as an act of a higher power, as the result of more-or-less predictable meteorological processes, as influenced by humans through anthropogenic climate change, or not as “real” weather at all but as a literary trope that echoes the feelings and moods of the characters? Is the weather something that can be predicted, controlled, and managed, or something frightening, dangerous, and wild? How do representations of the weather communicate larger concerns about human agency, the human relationship with nature, the stress and uncertainty of living in unpredictable environments, and the responsibilities of living in the Anthropocene? We will approach these questions through texts including Homer’s Odyssey, William Shakespeare’s King Lear, Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights, and Octavia Butler’s The Parable of the Sower, among others. This course will involve reading carefully, thinking critically, and writing and revising short analytic essays. In addition to reading about the effects of the weather on humans, we will also pay attention to our own embodied writing practices and how they are inflected by the environments where we write.

Millan\n\nBeginning with one of the great epics of the Western Tradition and culminating with a twenty-first-century memoir, this course explores how literary texts depict, theorize, and otherwise meditate on questions of location, identity, and community. Through a wide range of readings that include Odysseus’s treacherous homecoming, the dramatic appeal of disguise and deception in Shakespearean comedy, the industrial transformation of England’s green and pleasant lands, racial passing in 1920s Harlem, a bottled-up English butler, and an intimate family memoir, we will investigate how literary texts construct the spaces, styles, and plots essential for the making of shared meanings. By what imaginative means do writers help us think about race, class, and gender? How do texts conceal and reveal social logics of belonging and exclusion? Tracking a course through epic poetry, drama, lyric poetry, novels, and memoir, we will combine close stylistic analysis with historical and theoretical accounts. This course introduces students to a range of writing styles and forms (and collaborative work) necessary for flourishing within the English major. [Counts towards the major in English]\n\nWRPR 150A001, 150B001 Approaches to Literary Analysis: The World at Stake: Courage and Authority in Literary History\n\nJ. Kopin\n\nThis course deals with questions of authority and its antagonist, courage, across a variety of works in and out of the canon of literary history. Through plays, poetry, novels, essays, and other works, it asks how we might understand the development and maintenance of legitimate power in our political and social worlds, under what conditions authority might become illegitimate, and what role courage can play in overturning or undermining such a regime. Beginning with Euripides’ play The Bacchae and moving through Shakespeare's The Tempest, the poetry of Phyllis Wheatley, Jane Austen’s Persuasion, short works by Herman Melville, and the “ambiguous utopia” of Ursula K. LeGuin’s The Dispossessed, the course will consider a variety of spaces of authority—the state, the family, the military, the workplace—how those spheres interact or counteract one another and what resistance in those spaces looked like for various people at various times. Accordingly, it will allow us to ask questions of both authority and courage: how do people define themselves by what they are (and are not) allowed to do? Is authority necessary for a civil society? How do authority and courage define and provoke each other? How can historically contextualized acts of courage help us to understand historical processes? At what point does courage become, itself, authoritarian? [Counts towards the major in English.]\n\nWRPR 150B002 Introduction to Literary Analysis: Rewrite to Refuse: Adaptations to Counternarratives\n\nB. Bastie\n\nThis course will read across texts widely considered canonical in the Western literary tradition as well as important adaptations that reframe, resituate, and resist their dominant narratives. Rather than moving chronologically, this course will constellate works that converse and correspond with one another. For example, we might read Virgil's Aeneid in conjunction with Gwendolyn Brooks' The Anniad and Alice Notley's The Descent of Alette or William Shakespeare's The Tempest with Aimé Cesaire's A Tempest and Kamau Brathwaite's Caliban. By reading these reformulations, we will grapple with what it means to retell and recontextualize stories from alternative, often marginalized perspectives. How do the histories of colonialism, sexism, and racism permeate Western literatures? And in turn, how do counternarratives challenge and refuse this hegemony? In addition to engaging with different literary genres, students can expect to read historical, theoretical, and critical texts that will introduce analytic frameworks and key terms to help develop skills to closely read and incisively write about literature. [Counts towards the major in English.]\n\nWRPR 151A001, 151B001 Through the Looking Glass: Ancient Sexuality and Modern Queer Politics\n\nR. Warwick\n\nIn this course, we will examine the influence of Greco-Roman antiquity on the way that we talk about sex and sexuality today, with a particular view to how queer people have used the Classics to define their own identities. In reviewing the building blocks of queer theory and queer historiography alongside the primary source texts from the ancient world that inspired them, we will ask a series of questions: What is at stake when we see ourselves in the past? What does it mean to identify an ancient person as queer? In forming these histories, which elements are emphasized, and which are left out? [Counts towards the minor in Classical Culture and the concentration in Gender & Sexuality Studies]\n\nWRPR 155B001 Origin Stories: In the Wake of War\n\nT. Tensuan\n\nTIn this class, we will focus on works that depict the reverberations of war in relation to national histories, intergenerational trauma, familial legacies, and individual purviews in order to consider how creative works represent and recontextualize conflict and transformation. What role do cultural productions play in establishing institutional and individual ideals and memories; what happens when a work subverts conventional expectations? How do forms such as the epic, the novel, or the graphic narrative frame cultural ideologies and function as sites for cultural change? What happens when differing interpretations of an event or a text come into conflict with one another; what is at stake in acts of reading, interpretation, analysis, and critical confrontation? Over the course of the semester we will be engaging the work of a wide range of authors and artists working in modalities such as graphic narratives, memoirs, reportage, and speculative fiction (and often some combination of the above). You will be experimenting with a variety of writing assignments such as autobiographical reflections, close readings, four frame comics, informal journals, microfictions, and poetry cycles. You will learn how to write detailed and compelling narratives, how to identify conventions and genres, how to use evidence in constructing logical arguments, how to write persuasive essays, and how to contextualize and cite sources. College-wide expectations for this course center on the assumption that students who have taken this course are proficient in writing critical analyses that are clearly articulated, that effectively utilize evidence, that adhere to conventions of academic citation, and that make manifest your contributions to an intellectual community (which we can imagine as your classmates, the collective body of Haverford College, audiences ranging from literary critics to public policy makers, etc.).

[Counts towards the minor in Visual Studies]\n\nWRPR 172B001 Revolutionary Prose: Manifestos, Declarations and Letters\n\nt. wiley\n\nThis course delves into the dynamic and influential form and style of manifestos, declarations, and letters, examining their role in shaping political ideologies, religious movements, and artistic revolutions throughout modern history, from the Protestant Reformation and Occupy Movement to Black Lives Matter and the Movement for Palestinian Liberation. Participants in this multidisciplinary seminar will critically analyze the interplay between politics, religion, and art within certain notable manifestos, declarations and letters, examining how these statements reflect--in style, form and aspiration--the socio-political contexts of their time, often challenging established norms and advocating for radical change. From Martin Luther's theses to the American Declaration of Independence to the Declaration of Sentiments and Marx's communist manifesto, manifestos, declarations and letters have served as powerful instruments for expressing vision, dissent, and revolution. Students will critically engage primary texts to understand their historical significance and enduring impact. Through readings, discussions, and analytical exercises, students will develop a nuanced understanding of the complex relationship between ideology, rhetoric, and action embedded in reformist and revolutionary cultures and practices. By the end of the course, students will not only gain insight into pivotal moments in modern history but also cultivate the skills necessary to critically evaluate and contextualize manifestos, declarations, and letters in contemporary discourse.\n\nWRPR 182A001 The American Family in Historical Perspective\n\nE. Lapsansky\n\n\"The American family in historical perspective\" will invite us to take a look at a variety of family structures, behaviors, values, and stresses, as times, peoples, regions, and issues interface with our notions and realities of “family.” Including [but not limited to] Native American, Mexican, African American; Protestant, Jewish, Mormon and Catholic, North, South and West, over time, we will explore not only demographics, comparative rituals of birth, marriage, illness, disability; expectations of family/community \"loyalty\" vs. \"individuation.\" While pursuing such critical concerns as immigration, migration, labor, and economy, we will also look at such topics as recreation and dietary norms, family-crisis management; \"privilege\" and lack thereof; and notions of education [e.g., who should get it, what kind, and to what end?]. [Counts towards the minor in Health Studies.]\n\nWRPR 183B001, WRPR 183B002 Computing the Self: The Art and Philosophy of Digital Culture\n\nJ. Draney\n\nWhat does it feel like to live in data? To be tagged, tracked, followed, favorited, or rated? How has the datafication of everyday life shaped your social life, altering the way you relate to yourself and others? Students in this class will ask what it means to see and be seen as a data object. To do so, you will analyze a variety of novels, stories, works of philosophy, psychology, and social science that have dramatized the questions posed above. The class will focus on several twenty-first-century novels, with occasional forays back into the early twentieth century. You will pay special attention to the ways writers and artists use aesthetic forms to think through, and intervene in, everyday life. Along the way, you will learn to write about the strangeness of your own computational encounters. As part of this course, you will be asked to start a digital diary, tracking the ways your thoughts, feelings, and desires interface with the apps, platforms, and software that you use every day. Students in this course will learn to see art, fiction, and philosophy as tools to think with, rather than as inert representations or static arguments. Texts will include Tao Lin, Taipei (2014); Tom McCarthy, Satin Island (2015); Jarett Kobek, I Hate the Internet (2016); Heike Geissler, Seasonal Associate (2018) Patricia Lockwood, No One is Talking About This (2021)."
