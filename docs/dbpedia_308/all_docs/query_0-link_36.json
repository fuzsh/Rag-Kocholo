        "text": "Award-winning director Lisa Cortés foments bold, explosive art that gives voice to the silenced and shunned. From helping launch the revolutionary artists Run DMC and the Beastie Boys to executive-producing the Academy Award®-winning film “Precious,” Cortés sparks cultural change through works of unrivaled excellence. “Little Richard: I Am Everything” (CNN Films), which she directed and produced, had its world premiere as the opening night selection in the U.S. documentary competition at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival, where it was acquired by Magnolia Films. Also premiering at Sundance was “Invisible Beauty,” the documentary about Black fashion industry pioneer Bethann Hardison, which she produced. In 2020, Cortés directed and produced “All In: The Fight For Democracy,” tracing the violent history of the voting rights struggle. Emmy®-winning HBO documentary “The Apollo” (2019), which Cortés produced, explores African American cultural and political history through the story of the legendary Apollo Theater. Cortés executive produced “Precious” (2009) which was nominated for six Academy Awards and won two. The film received the Sundance Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize for best drama. Her film productions have received over 80 international awards and nominations. Cortés launched her early career as a music executive at the iconic Def Jam label and Rush Artist Management; she was also vice president of Artist and Repertoire at Mercury Records and founded the Loose Cannon label. Cortés is a member of the producers’ branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She serves on the boards of film at Lincoln Center, Independent Television Services (ITVS), the celebrated artists’ community in Saratoga Springs Yaddo, and the Trajal Harrell Dance Company, as well as the DGA Focus on Women Committee.\n\nDiego Hurtado de Mendoza is a Los Angeles based Emmy-Award winning producer and DGA director whose thought-provoking work often explores complex contemporary subjects using a rich and vibrant cinematic visual language. Born in Madrid, Spain, to Basque and Swedish parents, his career started as an artist-in-residence at FABRICA, the Research Center on Communications of Benetton, in Treviso, Italy, where he worked with artists from all over the world and directed the documentaries \"Branding Kosovo\" - about the independence of Kosovo, and \"Welcome to Beirut\" - about the relationship between filmmaking and war in Lebanon and also worked for COLORS magazine. Since relocating to Los Angeles he has continued to work as a commercial director for brands like Ford, Honda, Wells Fargo or Netflix, and also created short documentaries like \"The Flower Man\", a portrait of an unhoused artist living in Skid Row, the neighborhood with the largest homeless population in the US. In 2016 he executive-produced and directed the documentary series \"Arriba Cuba\", for The International Olympic Committee, and later went on to write, produce and co-direct with Peter Berg the feature documentary \"The People’s Fighters\" (2018), also in Cuba, which premiered at the Havana International Film Festival and won first prize at the AIPS Awards (International Sports Press Association.) Between 2017 and 2022 he produced the global Olympic premium documentary series Five Rings Films, which included the films \"The Iron Hammer\" (China), \"Rulon\" (USA), \"The Distance\" (Japan), \"A Brilliant Curling Story\" (UK) and \"The Redeem Team\" (USA) for Netflix. \"The Redeem Team\" was executive produced by Frank Marshall, Dwayne Wade and Lebron James and nominated for a Critic’s Choice Award and two Emmys - winning the Outstanding Sports Emmy Award.\n\nWith a career spanning over 50 years and more than 80 films, Frank Marshall has helped shape American cinema, producing some of the most successful and enduring films of all time. Starting in 1967 as an assistant to Peter Bogdanovich on their first film, “Targets,” and then as location manager on “The Last Picture Show,” Marshall worked closely with Bogdanovich for years, eventually making 10 pictures together. By 1980, Marshall was working as a producer on “Raiders of the Lost Ark” with his future wife, Kathleen Kennedy, and Steven Spielberg. Shortly thereafter, the trio formed industry powerhouse Amblin Entertainment, and together produced movies such as “E.T.,” “Gremlins,” the “Back to the Future” trilogy, “Who Framed Roger Rabbit?,” “The Goonies,” “Empire of the Sun” and the “Indiana Jones” trilogy. In 1991, Marshall and Kennedy left Amblin to form their own production company, The Kennedy/Marshall Company, where, from 1991 to 2012, they produced over 25 films, including “The Sixth Sense,” “Signs,” “Seabiscuit,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “War Horse,” “Lincoln,” all five films in the “Jason Bourne” series and the feature documentary “The Armstrong Lie.” In 2012, Marshall took over as sole principal of the company when partner Kathleen Kennedy became chairman of Lucasfilm. Since then, Marshall has broadened its slate beyond feature films to include television, documentaries and Broadway musicals. Those include the “Jurassic World” franchise and Orson Welles’ final film “The Other Side of The Wind” and the Emmy-nominated documentaries “Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,” “Laurel Canyon: A Place in Time” and “McCartney, 3,2,1.” Most recently, he produced the Tony®-winning musical “A Strange Loop” and the GRAMMY®-winning documentary “Jazz Fest: A New Orleans Story.” Along with five Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, including “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” “The Color Purple,” “The Sixth Sense,” “Seabiscuit” and “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” Marshall and Kennedy received the Irving G. Thalberg Award in 2018, awarded to “creative producers, whose bodies of work reflect a consistently high quality of motion picture production.” In addition to his prolific producing career, Marshall is also an accomplished director, having helmed “Arachnophobia,” “Eight Below,” “Alive,” “Congo” and the HBO documentary “The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend A Broken Heart,” which was nominated for six Emmys. In 2019, Marshall made his stage directorial debut at the Geffen Playhouse with “Invisible Tango,” starring master magician Helder Guimarães. During the pandemic in 2020, they continued their creative collaboration by creating two virtual shows, “The Present” and “The Future.” Marshall’s interests also extend beyond film. He is a board member of the LA Promise Fund, the UCLA School of Theatre, Film and Television and The Archer School for Girls. In 2008, he was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame for his service to the Olympic movement. Currently, he is producing “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which will be released in theaters on June 30, and “Good Night, Oscar,” which will open on Broadway at the Belasco Theater in April 2023.\n\nMark Monroe is an award-winning documentary writer, director and producer, and co-founder of Diamond Docs. An Emmy winner, two-time WGA Award winner and BAFTA nominee, his film credits include writing the Academy Award winners “The Cove” and “Icarus,” as well as the GRAMMY-winning “The Beatles: Eight Days a Week.” Recent collaborations include Peabody nominee “Lucy & Desi” with Amy Poehler, “Becoming Cousteau” with Liz Garbus, “The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart” with Frank Marshall, “Pavarotti” with Ron Howard, “Before the Flood” with Leonardo DiCaprio, “The Dissident” with Bryan Fogel, “Watch the Sound” with Mark Ronson and Morgan Neville, and the animated music series “Tales From the Tour Bus” with Mike Judge.
