Black and white film is one of the oldest photography tools and incredibly easy to work withâa big reason why beginning-level photography classes only teach students to shoot in black and white. Black and white film was used to capture some of the worldâs most iconic photographs and it remains extremely popular to this day. Monochrome photography forces a photographer to focus on how light, shadows, and shapes interact within a frame to create an image. Knowing how to shoot black and white film will go a long way in helping your photographic eye and ultimately can help your digital photographic work too. Plus, you donât need much to get started. A basic 35mm film camera wonât cost much on the secondary market and the film is typically cheaper than color film cameras.

Types of black and white film

Black and white films are either categorized as tabular-grain or traditional-grain. Traditional grain films can be thought of as the original film format and include films like Kodak Tri-X and Ilford HP5+. Tabular-grain films first hit the market in the â80s and create images that provide more detail by having a finer grain.

Black and white films also vary by speed, which is very similar to setting the ISO on your digital camera. Lower-speed films with a rating of 100 typically arenât as sensitive to light and have finer grain and work best when shot on sunny days, mid-range films in the 400 speed range are good for overcast days or indoors, while high-speed films at 3200 are best for nighttime black-and-white photography or situations where you want to use their grainy look for creative purposes. As you shoot more, youâll likely discover which film stock is your favorite.

Things to consider when purchasing black and white film

Finding the right film stock for you has a lot to do with your personal aesthetics as a photographer. You should also consider what subject you plan to be shooting and what photography equipment you have at your disposal. The majority of consumer films are somewhere between the 100-400 range and an excellent option if you are shooting with a fully manual camera and plan to do most of your work outdoors. If you are more of a night owl and plan to be shooting at night a high-speed 1600 or 3200 film might be a better option for you. If you are using a film camera with a flash and shooting somewhere poorly lit a 400 speed film will probably do just fine to help you balance your subject and background.

In addition to grain and film speed many films have unique characteristics in how they interpret color. Some films will be very contrasty, while other film stocks will represent the world in much more subtle shades of gray. How you shoot and develop your film will also have a lot of influence on the final product.

Many film photographers enjoy shooting their films at a different ISO than whatâs listed on the box in a process called pushing or pulling. If you have a roll of 400 speed film you can push it by setting your camera to a higher ISO speed. Youâll be intentionally underexposing your film and then making up for the difference in development. Pushing film works best in even lighting conditions. Pulling film is when you shoot it at a lower ISO than what it is rated for and will typically reduce the contrast of your film. If you are pushing or pulling a roll of film make sure to tell your lab so they can adjust the development times on your rolls.
