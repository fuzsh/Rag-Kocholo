The Golden Horseshoe Revue is a charming short film that showcases many performances at a Wild West place in a Disney theme park. The performances bring that time period to life and there are many hilarious moments scattered throughout this special. The cast truly shined in their performances. The singing was so good and it felt like history was coming to life. From the costumes to the comedy and how the Wild Wild West helped showcase it in a series of skits it was truly enjoyable and lovely! Had never watched one like this but I was a fan of it and loved it! I loved the comedy and the songs and how it brought that time period to life. Laughs abound and just like the Wild Wild West prepare to race around barrels with wholesome fun and laughter!

Mister Piano Man, please,

Tickle those ivory keys

No one can noodle

The way that you doodle

Those ricky-ticky melodies

Mister Piano Man, you,

Do what nobody can do

Your tremblin' tremulos are gonna drive me to ruin

Your left don't know exactly what your right hand is doin'

Oh, Mister Piano Man, please,

Tickle those ivory keys

Mister Piano Man, you,

Do what nobody can do

Your tremblin' tremulos are gonna drive me to ruin

Your left don't know exactly what your right hand is doin'

Oh, Mister Piano Man, please,

Tickle those ivories,

Tickle those ivories...

Mister Piano Man, please!
