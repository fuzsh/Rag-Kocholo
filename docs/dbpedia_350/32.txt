Larry Semon is a mostly forgotten silent comic. It's a shame, as his films often have wonderful athleticism and his shorts hold up well. As for his foray into full-length pictures ("The Wizard of Oz"), the less said the better.

The story begins with Dynamite Duffy (Oliver Hardy) coming to town. This boxing champ offers anyone $50 if they can last one minute against him....and in very quick succession a bunch of pulverized guys attest to his power and nastiness. Larry wants a chance at the money, too....and ends up besting this brute thanks to horseshoes in his gloves. Angry, Duffy and his gang are determined to teach Larry a lesson...and again and again Larry manages to get the upper hand due to his brains and atheticism.

The first portion of this short seems much like any other comics' work of the day. However, as the film progresses, Semon's athletic abilities (he was quite the acrobat) and the usual Semon chase scene occurs....and the film switches from a good film to a memorable one. Well made...and well worth your time.

By the way, this sort of villain role was very typical of Oliver Hardy before he ultimately was teamed up with Stan Laurel.
