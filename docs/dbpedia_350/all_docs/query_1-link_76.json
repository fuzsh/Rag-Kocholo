        "text": "\"...Miss Mary Angle and Miss Rachel Hodge, reigning belles of the countryside, and James K. Henry, a young farmer, were the three principals of the narrative which begins with the marriage of young Henry to Miss Angle on January 11, 1844.\n\nA devoted couple - this was the approving verdict of the townsfolk. But their earthly attachment was short lived for on February 28, 1845 the winsome young wife died due to unknown causes while giving birth to a lusty son.\n\nThe husband was grief-stricken and as a sign of his sorrow, erected the grave marker, already mentioned.\n\nOn December 7, 1848, Henry took unto himself another wife - this time he chose Miss Rachel Hodge. Soon after this second marriage, some say within a week or two, there appeared on the grave marker of his first wife, the queer formation of a horse shoe. Where it came from or how it came to be in the lonely cemetery likely has a scientific explanation. no one knew but thereafterward, farmers having occasion to pass the grave yard after sunset, whipped up their mounts and, with averted heads, dashed past the spot at breakneck speed.\n\nShortly after the horseshoe print was first descried [sic], Henry was kicked to death by one of his horses - a high spirited mare, which had been the driving pet of his first wife. Henry was buried in a nearby grave yard and his second wife, who died soon after, was interred beside him.\n\nJames's death occurred on April 8, 1859, due to unknown causes, and was buried in an unknown grave yard. His second wife remarried six years later and lived until 1882.\n\nSince their deaths and burial, the tale has persisted for well over a century sparking the curiosity of many persons claim to have seen the ghostly hue and glow when darkness has settled over the lonely graveyard. At such time, they say, two female figures, separated by the horseshoe, rise up in the horseshoeâ€™s silvery brightness and gesticulate as though in dispute"
