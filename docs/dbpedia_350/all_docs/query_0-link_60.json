But more potent are the plot components. It builds a solid heart story in a manner which is enough of a switch on the backstage formula to make it different.\n\nBetty Grable and Dick Haymes are co-starred and this, of course, puts the crooner over solidly as a film juvenile. William Gaxton plays Haymes’ father, the lead at the Horseshoe, forever squabbling with Grable, the No. 1 cheesecake. Haymes gives up medicine for a stage career, and while Grable starts out under a cloud she emerges the noble influence to get him back to his MD studies, an objective in which Gaxton fails and for which he had blamed his son’s romantic vis-a-vis.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nPer cinematic custom, some of the so-called cabaret revue numbers could happen only in Madison Square Gardens, but this again is accepted Hollywood license. On the other hand, the Diamond Horseshoe decor and policy are sometimes so faithful it’s startlingly familiar, even unto a lyrical ad for the joint, such as the line, ‘Two shows every night (without a cover)’."
