The band is the 2011 International Acoustic Music Award winner in the Bluegrass/Country category.\n\nThey celebrated Oklahoma’s centennial internationally through their performances with a tour of Japan and Thailand. They also filmed a documentary of this tour as an official OK Centennial Project, and performed 32 shows at the 2000 Oklahoma State Fair Centennial Expo at the Oklahoman Stage.\n\n“Peter, Brent and I, collectively, have performed in over 30 countries and the Oklahoma stage is always our favorite place to be,” Dillingham said. “Our home state fans are the best and the most loyal, and we wouldn’t be doing what we’re doing without them.”\n\nKyle Dillingham and Horseshoe Road were recently chosen by a lucky fan to play in a venue in Oklahoma City for the Live on the Green: Up Close and Personal contest, hosted by the Oklahoma Film + Music Office, Lower Bricktown Live on the Green, presented by Oklahoma Chevy Team Dealers and Dr. Pepper, and Fanswell."
