        "text": "The Moab to Monument Valley Film Commission holds the title of the longest running film commission in the world. Harkening back to the days of John Wayne and the classic western, the Moab area has been a popular destination for feature length films, commercials, and television shows for almost 75 years. In 1949, John Ford first ventured out from the iconic Monument Valley to film along the majestic Colorado River Corridor. Seeing that the production employed almost all of Moab’s 1,500 residents, local rancher George White founded the film commission to promote movie making in the area and establish a local crew base and production services.\n\nDirector Ridley Scott reported that he had “seen more wonderful and varied scenery in a single day in Moab than any other day [he had] scouted.” Such variance has made Moab a hot spot for movies of all genres. From the ranches of the old west, to the interplanetary fields of Mars, to mile after mile of classic road-trip roads, the scenery is as endless as the possibilities.\n\nVisitors to Moab may find the area familiar as they tip-toe up to Thelma and Louise Point, set off on horseback to follow John Wayne’s hoof prints, or take in the view from Westworld’s Hub Mesa. Filmmakers will find thousands of square miles of sand deserts, snowy mountains, desolate canyons, verdant farmland, empty roads, and rushing rivers, – not to mention the iconic red rocks."
