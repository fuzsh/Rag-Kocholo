        "text": "Horseshoe crabs have existed for more than 400 million years, surviving five mass extinctions, yet today they are threatened world-wide due to overfishing and loss of spawning habitat. Their blue blood contains an ingredient essential for biomedical testing, resulting in an ever-increasing pressure on their populations with little research into how bleeding affects them long term.\n\nThrough 2D and 3D art, interpretive panels and guest speakers, this exhibition will highlight the lifecycle and ecological importance of horseshoe crabs in the web of life. We explore how human exploitation is threatening these creatures once so abundant that towns in Massachusetts paid bounties to rid beaches of them but are now missing from many of their former spawning grounds.\n\nThe exhibition features work in a variety of media including fine art, photography, printmaking, glass, ceramics, textile, sculpture, jewelry, etc., as artists explore the beauty of these ancient creatures, their ecological importance, and the threats they face.\n\nThe exhibition encourages reflection on humanity's relationship with the natural world and the consequences of exploitation. It serves as a call to action to protect these sentient creatures and preserve biodiversity for future generations."
