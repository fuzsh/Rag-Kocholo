        "text": "This documentary follows Frankie Gonzales-Wolfe during her 2019 bid to become councilwoman of District 8 in San Antonio. She and her husband, Jeff, begin the campaign bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as they select graphics for signs and reach out to their friends and supportive organizations. A local trans woman, Frankie finds massive support in the queer community and among some Democrats.\n\nStill, the conservative bent of Texas politics means many moderate Democrats dismiss her based on her gender. She faces massive pushback from Republican voters even though the position is non-partisan and she supports many policies that could be considered conservative. Some people go as far as to remove or deface her campaign signs illegally. Though it all, Jeff and the rest of her family stand behind her. A Run for More shows us many aspects of the electoral system and why queer people avoid running for political office.\n\nA Run for More is a surprisingly powerful documentary. While Frankie is the subject of the documentary, her run for office serves more as a case study in Texas’ continued persecution of trans people than a personal biography. During her campaign, she speaks to many different people from different backgrounds and learns something about her own experience as a transgender woman. She recongnizes that having a family that accepts you is a privilege many trans people in her community lack. Frankie makes several dozen other such realizations during her bid for councilwoman, making A Run for More an excellent resource for anyone studying queerness in America or Texas specifically.\n\nThe LGBTQ documentary is incredibly well-shot and organized, cramming information in-between moments of pure biography. Fans of documentary filmmaking will want to see A Run for More just for its unique fly-on-the-wall styling. Highly Recommended.\n\nWhere does this title belong on public library shelves?\n\nA Run for More belongs on political, queer, and women’s studies documentary shelves.\n\nWhat type of college instructor could use this title?\n\nAnyone instructing courses about electoral politics, gender studies, or queer studies will find substantial use in A Run for More.\n\nWhat is the retail price and/or Public Performance License fee?\n\nEducational DVD with PPR: $375, Digital Site License with PPR: $495, DVD + DSL bundle PPR: $520, K-12, Public Library w/ PPR: $125"
