        "text": "Join the Coastal Conservation League and Southern Environmental Law Center for a screening of the powerful documentary Scarlet Sky and Blue Blood – Conservation of the Red Knot and Horseshoe Crab in the Southeastern US.\n\nThis compelling and long-awaited film by director Benjamin Clock tells the tale of the special bond between two species: federally threatened shorebirds rufa red knots and prehistoric horseshoe crabs.\n\nThese two creatures are explicitly tied; red knots need to consume thousands of horseshoe crab eggs to accumulate the fat stores they need for their arduous long-distance journeys from South America to the Arctic.\n\nFollowing the film, please join us for a panel moderated by Rebecca Haynes, Executive Director of Audubon South Carolina. Panelists include:\n\nBenjamin Clock, documentarian and filmmaker\n\nRiley Egger, Land, Water, & Wildlife Program Director for the Coastal Conservation League\n\nCatherine Wannamaker, Senior Attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center\n\nTickets are $10 and include a beer, wine or n/a beverage. Concessions are also available for purchase."
