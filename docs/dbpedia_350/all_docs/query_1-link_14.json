        "text": "- [host Joe Hanson] Every year east coast beaches play host to one of the world's wildest parties.\n\nIt's all sex and gluttony on the shore.\n\nBut these spring breakers are of the 10 legged variety.\n\nMillions of prehistoric creatures converge here.\n\nWhat's behind this epic fiesta?\n\n[upbeat music] The waters of Delaware Bay look unassuming.\n\nBut as the temperatures warm in spring, something curious happens.\n\nStrange creatures emerge from the depths.\n\nThese ancient beings are horseshoe crabs.\n\nHorseshoe crabs spend most of their lives in the deep ocean but every May and June, millions of these creatures drag themselves ashore on sandy beaches up and down the Atlantic coast.\n\nSome will travel 60 miles or more just to get here.\n\nWhile aerial views of these creatures are pretty cool.\n\nWe wanna take you even closer.\n\nSo we teamed up with our friends at DEEP LOOK to show you this.\n\nThey might look like crabs.\n\nThey're actually more closely related to spiders and other arachnids, than to crabs or lobsters.\n\nNowhere is the concentration of horseshoe crabs greater than here in Delaware Bay.\n\nAs many as 30 million crabs, a population greater than the size of Shanghai, China descend on the bay.\n\nBut what are they doing here?\n\nThese beaches are the ultimate horseshoe crab hookups spot.\n\nMale crabs arrived just ahead of the females.\n\nThey form a wall that females must plow through to reach suitable nesting sites.\n\nThey jostled until one lucky male successfully grabs onto the females shell and pulls himself a board.\n\nEach female will carry upwards of 80,000 eggs.\n\nShe buries them in the sand, which her suitors fertilize.\n\n- [Dave] The females burrow into the sand.\n\nSo she is almost completely covered up when she's making those nests, and the males are on the surface of the sand and surrounding it.\n\nThey like to spawn high on the beach.\n\nThe theory is that that was a strategy to avoid aquatic predators.\n\n- [Joe] To do that the crabs need to arrive when the tides are highest, around the new and full moon in May and June.\n\nOnly a handful of the thousands of eggs a female lays will even survive a year.\n\nFewer yet will survive to sexual maturity.\n\n- [Dave] You just have to buy a lot of lottery tickets have a chance of winning.\n\n- [Joe] It's a strategy that served them well for a long, long time.\n\nThey're older than dinosaurs.\n\n- [Dave] If you saw a fossil of a horseshoe crab from hundreds of millions years ago, you would recognize it as a modern day horseshoe crab.\n\nSo it's a living fossil.\n\n- [Joe] There was a time however when their survival was in question.\n\nIn the early 1900s, horseshoe crabs were harvested by the millions and used as fertilizer.\n\nThat practice ended but today they're harvested for bait and for a different use.\n\nTheir blue blood contains an ingredient critical to testing the safety of vaccines and other drugs.\n\nTo prevent over-harvesting, a yearly survey is conducted around Delaware Bay.\n\nResearchers and citizen scientists team up to walk the beaches and count the crabs.\n\n- The horseshoe crab surveys are the way for us to learn more about the population.\n\nFour males, several females.\n\nIt will be a recorder that will be the person in charge of taking notes and collecting the data.\n\nThere will be a person rolling the quadrant, which is the metric in which randomized, which areas of the beach we collect counts.\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\n- Every time I see these crabs, I just go, this is so freaking Cool.\n\nHorseshoe crabs need big stretches of sandy beach area.\n\nIt's an environment that's slowly disappearing around here with all of the development so it is a big concern.\n\n- [Joe] For now the population in Delaware Bay appears to be healthy and growing.\n\nThat's a good thing, not only for the crabs, but for the other spring breakers.\n\nUp to a million migratory birds visit these shores on their way to Arctic nesting grounds.\n\nIt's not just coincidence the crabs and the birds are here together.\n\nFor the crabs it's mating time, but for the birds it's the product of this mating that they're here for, eggs.\n\nThese tiny green gems are horseshoe crab eggs.\n\nThey litter the beaches during mating season.\n\nThe eggs are an essential all you can eat buffet for migratory birds.\n\nSome of these birds traveled thousands of miles to get here and their survival literally depends on this food.\n\n- [Henrietta] Shore bird migration is timed such that birds arrive in the Delaware Bay during the peak of horseshoe crab spawning.\n\n- [Joe] The threatened Red Knot is one such traveler.\n\nIt flies from the Southern tip of South America all the way to the Arctic, a journey of nearly 9,000 miles.\n\n- When they arrive in the stopover locations on the Delaware Bay, they'll be very skinny and you can almost visibly see their breastbone.\n\n- [Joe] These nutritious eggs are the fuel needed to complete their migration.\n\n- [Henrietta] By the time they leave, they've blown up like a balloon that you could pop with a pin.\n\nWhen we think of migration, we think of these really incredible international events that wouldn't be happening right here in little old Delaware.\n\n[gentle music] - [Joe] But like any good party the morning after it can be a real drag.\n\n- [Man] They have the ability surprisingly to be stranded after tide has retreated, hunkered down, stay moist, wait for the next tide.\n\n- [Man 2] The sun really takes a toll.\n\nSo sometimes you think they're dead until you'd give them a little push.\n\nAnd then when they start moving, it's like, oh, good, I can save this one.\n\nIt's almost addictive.\n\nYou say, I'm just gonna flip over 10 more and then say, well, I can do another 10.\n\nI really do take great pleasure in saving a big mama, knowing that she will be able to lay eggs again.\n\nBecause when you see how the birds rely on them, you know, it's all part of the circle of life.\n\n- [Joe] To get a more close-up view of these amazing little creatures, be sure to check out the latest episode from our friends at DEEP LOOK.\n\nâ™ª"
