        "text": "In this delightful film, Paul Weeks, a master science teacher in Harlem, uses the horseshoe crab to illustrate the scientific method and the way we all learn.\n\nStudents will learn about the biology and ecology of the horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus). Teachers and concerned adults will learn how to motivate students and give them self-confidence through scientific discovery, and the effectiveness of a well-planned field trip.\n\nThe DVD version of this program is recorded on DVD-R which is not compatible with some older DVD players. See the new DVD page for more details.\n\nAwards:\n\nBest of Festival, 3rd Scientific Film Festival, Barcelona, Spain\n\nGolden Babe, Chicagoland Educational Film Festival\n\nNew Directors/New Films Festival, Museum of Modern Art\n\nBest of Category, National Educational Film Festival\n\nRed Ribbon, American Film Festival\n\nCINE Golden Eagle\n\nBest of Category, North American Assn. for Environmental Education Film Festival\n\nReviews:\n\n\"A sweet, very funny documentary...

With kids and a teacher like this around, there may be some hope for us yet.\" Vincent Canby, NY Times\n\n\"This film is an excellent introduction to the scientific method and to what you should expect to encounter on a field trip. Above all, it shows what youngsters can do if properly motivated.\" School Library Journal\n\n\"A film for teachers and teachers-to-be -- and parents, school board members, administrators, legislators who control purse strings, and any others who care about what schooling should be...Do yourself and \"your\" kids a favor and share this film with any or all of the above audience.\" Editor's Choice, Science Books & Films\n\nRelated Subjects:\n\nBiology\n\nCoasts and Oceans\n\nMarine Biology\n\nOutdoor Education\n\nScientific Method\n\nRelated Titles:\n\nThe Crabs, The Birds, The Bay: Migrating shorebirds feast on horseshoe crab eggs in Delaware Bay.\n\nThe Intertidal Zone: Ecology of the ecological zone between the tides.\n\nKeepers of the Coast: Surfers organize to save the ocean and the coastline."
