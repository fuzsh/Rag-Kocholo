        "text": "The Golden Horseshoe Revue is a charming short film that showcases many performances at a Wild West place in a Disney theme park. The performances bring that time period to life and there are many hilarious moments scattered throughout this special. The cast truly shined in their performances. The singing was so good and it felt like history was coming to life. From the costumes to the comedy and how the Wild Wild West helped showcase it in a series of skits it was truly enjoyable and lovely! Had never watched one like this but I was a fan of it and loved it! I loved the comedy and the songs and how it brought that time period to life. Laughs abound and just like the Wild Wild West prepare to race around barrels with wholesome fun and laughter!\n\nMister Piano Man, please,\n\nTickle those ivory keys\n\nNo one can noodle\n\nThe way that you doodle\n\nThose ricky-ticky melodies\n\nMister Piano Man, you,\n\nDo what nobody can do\n\nYour tremblin' tremulos are gonna drive me to ruin\n\nYour left don't know exactly what your right hand is doin'\n\nOh, Mister Piano Man, please,\n\nTickle those ivory keys\n\nMister Piano Man, you,\n\nDo what nobody can do\n\nYour tremblin' tremulos are gonna drive me to ruin\n\nYour left don't know exactly what your right hand is doin'\n\nOh, Mister Piano Man, please,\n\nTickle those ivories,\n\nTickle those ivories...\n\nMister Piano Man, please!"
