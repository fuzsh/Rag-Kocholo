        "text": "Please Join us on FaceBook\n\nProtecting Health\n\nIn 2009 ERDG launched its “Protecting Health” initiative to bring awareness to the excessive and lethal harvesting practices by the endotoxin testing industry engaged in the production of Tachypleus Amoebocyte Lysate (TAL) and the detrimental impact it is having on the Tachypleus horseshoe crab population throughout Southeast Asia. The intent of this initiative is to delineate the problems and to raise awareness of the possible implications for the global health industry and provide tools to promote communication regarding how the pharmaceutical/biomedical industry can become a driving force behind the conservation of the world’s four horseshoe crab species by eliminating unsustainable endotoxin testing products from their supply chain.\n\nPlease watch “The Harvest of the Tachypleus Horseshoe Crab Species for the Production of TAL is Unsustainable.”\n\nBackyard Stewardship™\n\nInterested in forming a horseshoe crab sanctuary in your beachfront community? Learn more about how to do that by watching our video.\n\nJust flip ’em!™ an ERDG program since 1998\n\nOur Just flip ’em!™ program is designed to bring attention to the hundreds of thousands of horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus) who die each year from stranding (stuck upside down) during their yearly spawning ritual and to encourage individuals, through a simple act of compassion, to take the time to assist and appreciate these remarkable creatures, who will not survive public indifference. Learn how you can make a difference.\n\nMake a donation to support us!\n\nWe maintain our site and other programs through donations from visitors and supporters like you. Please consider making a donation today through PayPal’s secure server. Thank you!\n\nThe Science and Conservation of Horseshoe Crabs\n\n5th International Workshop on the Science and Conservation of Horseshoe Crabs will be held in Singapore, June 19-23, 2024.\n\n4th International Workshop on the Science and Conservation of Horseshoe Crabs was held in Qinzhou City, Guangxi, China in 2019.\n\n3rd International Workshop on the Science and Conservation of Horseshoe Crabs was held in Sasebo City, Nagasaki, Japan in 2015.\n\n2th International Workshop on the Science and Conservation of Asian Horseshoe Crabs was held in Hong Kong, in 2011.\n\n1st International Symposium on the Science and Conservation of Horseshoe Crabs was held in New York, USA, in 2007.\n\nInternational Horseshoe Crab Day – June 20th\n\nIUCN SSC Horseshoe Crab Specialist Group have designated 20th June every year as International Horseshoe Crab Day to showcase the collective conservation efforts for the four horseshoe crab species. Since the first International Horseshoe Crab Day in 2020, more than 60 conservation educational activities, including symposia, webinars, public talks, film and video shows, exhibitions, workshops and eco-tours were organized across the geographical range of horseshoe crabs. Information on such activities will be posted on a webpage of the Beibu Gulf University, China."
