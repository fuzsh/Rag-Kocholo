        "text": "by Stephanie Feigin, CWF Program Coordinator\n\nThis week for Animal Week, we will be spotlighting Shorebirds in the Media! Endangered red knots, ruddy turnstones, and other magnificent birds travel from South America to the Canadian Arctic during their migration, and make an important stopover along the Delaware Bay Shore from May to June.\n\nThe 2014 Shorebird film, “A Race Against Time” celebrates the Delaware Bay Beach Restoration\n\nThe film can now be enjoyed for free on our website:\n\nClick here to enjoy this film!\n\nGreener New Jersey Productions this spring produced a 30-minute film documenting the ambitious campaign by Conserve Wildlife Foundation, American Littoral Society and other partners to restore Delaware Bayshore beaches decimated by Hurricane Sandy. This project ensures that the at-risk horseshoe crabs and globally migrating shorebirds relying on this habitat can survive.\n\nConserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey and the Endangered and Nongame Species Program (ENSP) of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection’s Division of Fish & Wildlife, and New Jersey Audubon have partnered for many years to conduct research on Delaware Bay shorebirds in order to prevent their decline.\n\nTags: 2014, bird, Delaware Bay, migratory shorebirds, New Jersey, red knot"
