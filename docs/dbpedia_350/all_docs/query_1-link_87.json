        "text": "What’s not to enjoy about Springfield this time of year? The legislature certainly seems intent on harshing our mellow, but the weather is lovely, a summer full of festivals and events lies ahead, and a lot of other good things are happening.\n\nAs reporter Dean Olsen explained last week, the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure is coming to Springfield in 2014. The 5-kilometer run/walk is scheduled for May 16 to raise money for breast cancer awareness and research. It will be the first Race for the Cure ever to occur in the evening.\n\nSusan Goodman Komen, the namesake of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, was born in Peoria. She was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 33 and died of the disease in 1980 when she was 36.\n\nThe Komen foundation expanded into the Springfield area in 2010. The local affiliate already has handed out health care-related grants in the area, with almost $80,000 in awards made this year.\n\nBreast cancer is the No. 2 cause of cancer deaths for women in the United States, behind lung cancer. About 9,100 new cases of invasive breast cancer are diagnosed in Illinois each year, and 1,650 Illinois women die from the disease annually.\n\nRace organizers hope to draw 2,500 participants and raise more than $250,000 through the Springfield race, which will begin at the Capitol Complex and proceed on a route through downtown Springfield.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dana-Thomas house is offering two special, temporary tours that invite guests to delight in some of the home’s hidden secrets.\n\nDocent Frank Marchant, 61, leads both tours – “Attention to Detail” and “Of Glass and Wood” – at the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed building. Marchant has been a docent at the house for 23 years and has visited 250 Wright-designed homes and buildings.\n\n“Growing up, my parents took me to a lot of historic homes, and that made me interested in homes of all types,” he told State Journal-Register writer Steven Spearie.\n\nGuests can learn about such surprises as the home’s 150 hidden wall sconces, Wright’s desire for decorative thin stripes on chairs, and a special sitting room and a porch not seen on regular tours. They also can learn about the extensive restoration of the home that took place in 1989 and 1990.\n\nMarchant said “there are no bad tours” at the Dana-Thomas home.\n\n“My feeling is that people will look back at the Dana-Thomas experience as the best they ever had. It’s an unexpected positive experience,” he said. “The (house) is like a good story: It keeps going on and on and on.”\n\nThere are a limited number of dates available for the special tours. Visit www.dana-thomas.org to learn more.\n\nAnd speaking of local icons, State Journal-Register columnist Dave Bakke last week told us about plans of an Arizona man to make a documentary film about Springfield’s Route 66 legend Bob Waldmire, who died in 2009.\n\nMark Silverstein, a high school teacher in Douglas, Ariz., never met Waldmire but wants to create a 90-minute film about him. Waldmire, who later in life split his time between Springfield and Arizona, was an artist and Route 66 icon whose father, Ed, started the legendary Cozy Dog Drive-In after inventing the hot dog on a stick.\n\nSilverstein said Waldmire’s life became a passion for him, and he hopes to capture that life through film. He, his wife, Maggie Schmidt, and a cinematographer were in Springfield last week working on the project.\n\n“I never got to meet Bob,” Silverstein said, “but whenever I go to his property, I get a sense of Bob. It’s like I just feel compelled to go.”"
