Students shared their research findings via a scientific talk delivered at the BML Student Research Symposium on August 1, and a final paper archived in the Cadet Hand Library at BML.\n\nStudents also developed science communication skills for engaging non-scientists. Students produced 3-minute films to highlight their research for general audiences and premiered their work at a Film Festival at Bodega Marine Lab on July 30. These films are now available to watch below.\n\nSurvival of the Smelliest: Does Smell Play a Role in Competitive Interactions Between Sea Slugs?\n\nFilmmakers: Dorado Barrios & Charlise Cambronero\n\nShifting Shores\n\nFilmmakers: Natalia Goston & Christian Long\n\nDon’t Put All of Your Crabs Under One Rock!\n\nFilmmakers: Jasper Jacobs & Makayla Peixoto\n\nHot as Shell\n\nFilmmakers: Emily Horn & Ava Hurley\n\nFrom Farm to Sea\n\nFilmmaker: Indi Mejia\n\nThe Elegant Dove Snail has a Dark Secret…\n\nFilmmakers: Nathan Cole & Kaden Stone\n\nWill Climate Change Cause a Crabtastrophe?\n\nFilmmakers: Zoe Roberson & Darien Valdez\n\nThe Sunburnt Urchins & The Search for Sunscreen\n\nFilmmakers: Jamison Nagle & Austin Wang\n\nHungry Hungry Barnacles!\n\nFilmmakers: Michell Valencia-Ortega & Kristen Wojciechowski\n\nHoney, My Sponge Tastes Funny!\n\nFilmmaker: Max Mao"
