Philip Jose Farmer Dies at 91

Science fiction great Philip Jose Farmer died yesterday morning âpeacefully in his sleep,â according to his official Web site, just weeks after his 91st birthday. From CNN :

Farmer was known for his science-fiction and fantasy novels and short stories. He was 91.

The Peoria, Indiana, nativeâs most popular work was his "Riverworld" series, written in the 1970s.

Joe Lansdale, a critic, writer and friend of Farmerâs, credited Farmer with changing the face of science fiction.

âI just canât begin to tell you how important he is to the field as well as other fields,â Lansdale said.

Critics said Farmer was the first author to address adult sexual themes in science-fiction novels.

Jonathan Strahan, an editor and critic for Locus magazine, said Farmer treated sex seriously, not in a juvenile manner or for cheap thrills.

âIt wasnât pornography and it wasnât just about the sex of it,â Strahan said. âIt was about the sexuality of people in an interesting and intelligent way.â

Graham Sleight, who wrote eloquently about Farmerâs work for his âYesterdayâs Tomorrowsâ column early in 2008, had this to say on the Locus blog:

All the weird stuff he loved to pack into his stories -- Tarzan, Richard Burton, sex, Joyce, loopy epistemology, historical trivia, flat earths -- made it a brew like nothing else.

From Farmerâs Web site:

He will be missed greatly by his wife Bette, his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, friends and countless fans around the world.

January 26, 1918 - February 25, 2009. R.I.P.
