        "text": "Philip Jose Farmer was working for a steel and wire company in Peoria, Illinois, and writing part-time in 1952 when he stirred up the science fiction world with his first published sci-fi tale, a controversial novella that appeared in the magazine Startling Stories.\n\n(The attractive alien was a parasitic form of life that mimics humans.) As Farmer later said in an interview for the online magazine The Zone, “Science fiction never had any sexual relationships in it. I felt that that was a part of life and so should be a part of SF.” Farmer, who won science fiction’s prestigious Hugo Award as most promising new talent in 1953 and whose later works included the World of Tiers, Riverworld and Dayworld series of novels, died in his sleep at home in Peoria, on February 25, said his wife, Bette. He was 91.\n\nOnce described by writer Harlan Ellison as “a storyteller extraordinaire” and “an intrepid explorer of astonishing places,” Farmer was the prolific author of more than 75 books and scores of short stories during his half-century career.\n\nThe long time Peoria resident, whose books have been translated into more than 20 languages and have been published in more than 40 countries, received two other Hugo Awards: in 1968 for best novella, Riders of the Purple Wage; and in 1972 for best novel, To Your Scattered Bodies Go.\n\n“What he did in terms of influence was to draw on all aspects of literature and put all kinds of different genres together in the same work,” Wolfe said. “Riders of the Purple Wage is a very Joycean story full of puns and word play, and the same kinds of puns and word play might show up in his adventure stories.\n\n“That part of his influence — just drawing on different genres — is very much alive today, especially with young writers. At the time he was writing, people either wrote science fiction, or they would write historical fiction or they would write fantasy. He mixed everything up, tore down all the barriers.” Farmer, who began reading science fiction at age nine, spent time in college before joining the Air Force.\n\nHe was in pre-flight school when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and, according to his website, was discharged after washing out of flight training. He then returned to Peoria and went to work for the Keystone Steel & Wire Co, where he remained for nearly 12 years.\n\nFarmer, who graduated from Bradley University in 1950 with a bachelor’s degree in English literature, continued to write fiction while working as a technical writer around the country from the mid-’50s to 1969, when he began writing science fiction full time. He moved back to Peoria a year later."
