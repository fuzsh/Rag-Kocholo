I like the mindless adventure, exotic locales, and airships, autogyros, machine pistols, etc. I started reading them in the 70s and I still pick one up once in a while.\n\nDesertDan\n\nOne Too Many\n\nMessages\n\n1,582\n\nLocation\n\nArizona\n\nI had the full series of books with the type cover art you posted. I only have a couple left (I need to remeady that).\n\nLove the Doc Savage stories.\n\nThe movie from the 70's was pretty bad.\n\nI find it interesting that Hollywood hasn't mined that particular story as of yet.\n\nMahagonny Bill\n\nPractically Family\n\nMessages\n\n563\n\nLocation\n\nSeattle\n\nI like the radium. Doc puts it everywhere; people's shoes, baby carriages, grocery parcels, anywhere on anything he wants to keep track of.\n\nThere are a few Doc Savage threads on the Lounge like this one. Feel free to post new comments in old threads when you find them, it will bring that thread to the top of the stack and start a whole new conversation.\n\nThe Wolf\n\nCall Me a Cab\n\nMessages\n\n2,153\n\nLocation\n\nSanta Rosa, Calif\n\nDefinitely some fans on this site. I've bought the paperbacks, the original pulps and now I'm buying the Nostalgia Ventures reprints that include the original art. Somehow, I still don't have all 181 of the original stories.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Wolf\n\nEdward\n\nMessages\n\n24,908\n\nLocation\n\nLondon, UK\n\nI keep meaning to pick them up. I saw a film years ago on television here in the UK - Doc Savage and the Green Death. I know nothing about it - I was about eight at the time - but I seem to remember enjoying it in the same was as the Tales of the Gold Monkey series.\n\nI read a few as a kid. It was one of those series where the wealthy and priveledged certainly did not live mundane lives.\n\nThe Wolf\n\nCall Me a Cab\n\nMessages\n\n2,153\n\nLocation\n\nSanta Rosa, Calif\n\nI'm going to a Doc Savage convention this week-end in Glendale, Arizona. I'm used to temperate weather in Santa Rosa and am not sure how to dress for Arizona.\n\nAnyone else going?\n\nSincerely,\n\nthe Wolf\n\nDesertDan\n\nOne Too Many\n\nMessages\n\n1,582\n\nLocation\n\nArizona\n\nHaven't heard of that convention, but I have been out of the scene for a long time.\n\nIt is still quite warn during the day (90's) and cool at night (mid 60's). Monsoons are over so things are pretty much dry and sunny.\n\nDefinitely give us an update when you get back.\n\nHave a safe trip and a good time.\n\nPatriarch\n\nNew in Town\n\nMessages\n\n1\n\nLocation\n\nWichita, Kansas\n\nI used to have most of the series and I'm getting them again... I've only gotten about a dozen right now. Definitely a fan.\n\nThe Wolf\n\nCall Me a Cab\n\nMessages\n\n2,153\n\nLocation\n\nSanta Rosa, Calif\n\nI got back from the convention and had a lot of fun. Anthony Tollin, who worked on Batman comics, writes about old time radio and is helping reprint the Shadow and Doc pulps, was there. He brought the hat that was used by the models on the Shadow pulp covers and talked about all sorts of things. Kez, who does the Doc fantasy covers (http://www.miscmayhemprods.com/doc/) showed how he put together some of his covers. All sorts of cool things were available.\n\nJay ran the con well and was a great guy.\n\nNext year will be the sixteenth con and 80th anniversary of Doc Savage.\n\nSincerely.\n\nThe Wolf\n\nDesertDan\n\nOne Too Many\n\nMessages\n\n1,582\n\nLocation\n\nArizona\n\nIs next years convention scheduled for Phoenix too?\n\nGlad you had a great time and a good trip.\n\nThe Wolf\n\nCall Me a Cab\n\nMessages\n\n2,153\n\nLocation\n\nSanta Rosa, Calif\n\nI believe it will be in Arizona next year as well. Check out Arizona Doc Con on Facebook to get more info and see photos of this years convention.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Wolf\n\nminkowski1552\n\nNew in Town\n\nMessages\n\n47\n\nLocation\n\nEastern Kansas\n\nWhen I was a kid, my father told about the type of stuff he read as a kid; Doc Savage, The Phantom, The Shadow and so on. I read as many as I could find. Now we have, Dirk Pitt (horrible). Those old novels were much better.\n\nrobrinay\n\nOne Too Many\n\nMessages\n\n1,489\n\nLocation\n\nSheffield UK\n\nDoc Savage -the Philip Jose Farmer angle\n\nCheck out books by Farmer on Doc Savage - a google search will tell you whether you'll find his views on the character worth reading. For what it's worth I really enjoyed them - he envisages links with Tarzan.\n\nEffingham\n\nA-List Customer\n\nMessages\n\n415\n\nLocation\n\nIndiana\n\nI love Doc Savage. Even enjoyed (through squinted eyes) the movie, more or less.\n\nI had no idea there was a convention. Hm. I've been wanting to visit Arizona anyway...\n\nThe Wolf\n\nCall Me a Cab\n\nMessages\n\n2,153\n\nLocation\n\nSanta Rosa, Calif\n\nIt's funny but all Doc fans were disappointed by the movie but we all own it.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Wolf\n\nEffingham\n\nA-List Customer\n\nMessages\n\n415\n\nLocation\n\nIndiana\n\nIt's funny but all Doc fans were disappointed by the movie but we all own it.\n\nThat's pretty much true.\n\nresortes805\n\nCall Me a Cab\n\nMessages\n\n2,019\n\nLocation\n\nSoCal\n\nDoc Savage.
