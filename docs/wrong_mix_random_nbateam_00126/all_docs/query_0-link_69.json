The butcher gave him a piece of paper with the butcher's bill head on it. The man wrote: \"Friend Fred - Can you lend me $30 until Sat. Bank closed and to-morrow a holiday.\" He then sent a boy to Fred Erxmeyer's grocery store. Grocer Erxmeyer was about to send the boy back with the money when his son arrived and questioned the \"propriety\" of sending such a sum with so small a boy.
