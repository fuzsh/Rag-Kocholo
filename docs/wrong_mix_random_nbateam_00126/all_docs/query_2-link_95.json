Farmer concludes: ¬´...no matter how exotic or fantastic, how stimulating to the imagination, how colorful the trappings, or how far the story goes, to the end of the universes or to the center of the Earth, the best stories of science-fiction are those who deal with the problems that most concern and perplex humanity, Infinity, eternity, determinism, free will, and especially immortality.¬ª.\n\nThe Worlds of Philip Jose Farmer (2): Of Dust and Soul, edited by Michael Croteau\n\nMeteor House, ISBN 978-0-983-74610-2, trade paperback, 09/2011\n\nLaura Givens\n\nMemoir\n\nFarmer's memories about the science fiction magazine If (aka.

His exploits include journeying to Mecca in disguise, at a time when Europeans were forbidden access on pain of death. This biography by Farmer opens in 1855, when Burton was thirty-four years old and on the expedition searching for the source of the Nile.\n\nPearls From Peoria\n\nSubterranean Press, ISBN 1-59606-059-X, limited and trade hardcover, 09/2006\n\nSubterranean Press, ISBN 1-59606-777-6, ebook, 01/2016\n\nA Rough Knight for the Queen\n\nMeteor House, ISBN 978-1-945427-19-0, hardcover, 09/2020, 102pp, $ 40.00\n\n[A limited hardcover of 150 signed copies.
