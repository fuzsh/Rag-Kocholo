W. MIDDLEBROOK\n\nWith much regret the CITIZEN announces the death of Mayor I. W. Middlebrook at his residence in this city at a quarter past three oclock this (Wednesday) morning, after a long illness. Though not unexpected, his death was a shock to his many friends in his city who had so long hoped for his ultimate recovery.\n\nIbzan William Middlebrook was born in Chickasaw county, Mississippi, on the 28th day of November, 1837, and was educated in the private schools of that state. When seventeen years of age he came to Texas, with the family, they settling in 1854 in Fayette county, engaging in agriculture. He moved to Lavaca county in 1959, and resided there till the opening of the war between the states.\n\nIn 1861 Mr. Middlebrook volunteered in the Confederate States army, and served as orderly sergeant of Co. D, from Lavaca county. The company was commanded by Capt. J. W. Whitfield, was afterwards a battalion, then a legion, commanded respectively by Col. Whitfield, and attached to Ross brigade. Sergeant Middlebrook was with the command in the battles of Elkhorn, Corloth, Juka, Hatchle Bridge, Miss., and in numerous skirmishes. He was promoted to Lieutenant of Co. K, before the close of the war. He was twice captured, once at Carters creek, Tenn., and once at Rodney, Miss. He was exchanged at Petersburg, Va., the first time; the second time he was imprisoned for sixteen months at Fort Delaware, and not released till the close of the war.\n\nAfter the close of the war he settled in Colorado county, and engaged in the manufacture of lumber, in which business he was quite successful, building up a comfortable home in Columbus, with all the surroundings necessary for the demands of a refined and intelligent family. On the 3d of January, 1869, he was married in the First Baptist church in this city to Mrs. Hattie Howard, who, with five children--three boys and two girls--survive him.\n\nHe was elected a representative for Colorado and Lavaca to the Fifteenth legislature and also elected to represent Colorado county in the Twenty-first legislature. He was the[sic] made chairman of the committee on Claims and Accounts, and served on the committees of Internal Improvements, Penitentiaries, Roads and Bridges, Mining and Minerals and Public Buildings and Grounds. In the Fifteen legislature he introduced the bill providing for a mechanic’s lien for work done, which was passed that session. With all his natural ability and strong personal influence he opposed the railroad commission bill and the purchase of a state farm upon which to work the convicts. He was not strictly a speaking member of the house, but relied upon quiet work in the committee rooms and in private conversation with his colleagues, with whom his genial manner and honest earnestness acquired great influence.\n\nIn April, 1898, he was elected mayor of Columbus, and, while his health permitted, devoted his best energies to the interests of the city of his residence.\n\nMr. Middlebrook was a man of firm and high character--a genuine good man in every respect. Liberal in sentiment and in praise, he entertained the emotions that gave him full fellowship in the common brotherhood of man. Without ostentation he regarded every one who tried to do right as as[sic] good as himself, and himself superior to no one who does nothing radically wrong. Regarding all men liable to error, he was free always to correct them himself, and liberal to those who regretted and righted their errors. He was a genial friend and companion, a good citizen, a devoted and indulgent husband and father, and a man who will be sadly missed, not only in his home town and county, but in many parts of the state. The bereaved family have universal sympathy in their affliction.\n\nThe funeral will take place at 10 oclock this (Thursday) morning, under the auspices of the Masonic lodge, from the family residence, at Odd Fellows Rest.\n\nOld soldiers, now before your raptured gaze\n\nThrough shining courts and aisles of endless light,\n\nThe Prince of Peace, whose never changing rays\n\nFar from the Glory Land can reach our night,\n\nHas come to greet you, leads you tenderly\n\nWhere pain and anguish had a long surcease\n\nTo light that never shone on land or sea,\n\nDiscredito in pace--go in peace.\n\nColorado Citizen, July 6, 1899, page 3\n\nMiddlebrook, James Birdsong\n\nDied, at Ramsey’s Point, Colorado county, Texas, Friday June 27, 1879, of congestion, JAMES BIRDSONG MIDDLEBROOK, JR., only son of S.
