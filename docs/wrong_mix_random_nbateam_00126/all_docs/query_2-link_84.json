        "text": "4/10\n\nThe thing about To Your Scattered Bodies Go (1972) is that it has a really intriguing concept, but is written down by a terribly mediocre writer. And when I tell you what this book is about, you might want to read it for yourself. I would encourage you to do that, but be prepared that Farmer is a very dated and pulpy writer. A bit of an Edgar Rice Burroughs figure combined with the sex and drugs of the 60s and 70s. This book was interesting enough to win him the Hugo, however. I thought it was very badly written.\n\nSo what is the book about? The main character Sir Richard Francis Burton dies on the very first page. Then he wakes up in a new world, in a new body. He has been given a hairless, young, fit body and wakes up in a grassy valley with a river running through it and mountains surround the valley on both sides of the river. Together with him are thousands, millions of other new young hairless people, all waking up, and all people who had died. In fact, every human who ever lived and died on Earth is resurrected in this endless valley. Every mile along the river, a concrete mushroom provides food, water and cigarettes. Burton meets people from the past and from the future, among which a neanderthal named Kazz, and an alien who visited Earth in the future and died there.\n\nBesides the neanderthal and the alien, Burton collects some other figures around him to explore the riverworld: a Yankee from the future who is a self-insert of the author, a little girl from ancient Gaul, and Alice Liddell (on whom Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland was based). The neanderthal makes them spears, but it doesn’t help them much because soon they are captured by Hermann Göring the Nazi, who has established a little kingdom.\n\nFarmer’s writing is frustratingly messy. It’s not always easy to follow, because he eschews a kind of basic logic in his storytelling, as if he is not able to imagine himself in the position of the reader of his story. He tends to jump from one statement to the next without a proper sense of the normal flow of time and activity. Characters suddenly exclaim things without leading up to it. They make assumptions about each other without any reason for it. Characters drop in and out of the narrative to the point where it is unclear who is present where and when. Characters are described as setting out to do things and two lines later they are suddenly back without a sense that time has passed. Conversations suddenly end. His writing simply shows no sense of properly leading a reader through a story.\n\nThis has some of the worst prose I have ever read.\n\nIt also has a truly exceptionally bad case of male gaze. I get that SF novels need to be regarded from the time in which they were written, but we’re talking about the 1970s here in which writers should have known better already, and Farmer takes it to an insidious extreme. In a world in which everybody is naked, each woman is described by how well-shaped they are and that is their only value in the story. “Loghu had a beautifully rounded posterior; her buttocks were like two eggs.” Too bad she had big lips, Burton thinks. “She was the product of her society – like all women, she was what men had made her.” And as long as the women do not look like passive dolls, Farmer immediately describes them as ugly. It’s not just a case of male gaze, but immediate judgement, immediate disgust for everything that isn’t beautiful in his eyes. Such as, she got angry and screwed up her face and looked angry and ugly, or, Alice felt shame and made herself a poncho of leaves which was shapeless, and now her bald head looked too masculine and ugly. It’s just a total disregard for life experiences and feelings and a total focus on whether they are not ugly at any time.\n\nYou could argue that this sexism is part of the story in which mankind is thrown back into a primitive state and has to relearn how to build a civilisation. And you could argue that the main character Burton who was from the 19th century was simply an asshole, and he is indeed a real asshole of a main character. But I don’t think that these are sufficiently valid excuses because this relies solely on the reader being an apologist and not on any hints that Farmer gives in his story.\n\nThe story changes shape a few times. It gets a tiny bit more interesting once the group builds a catamaran to find the end of the river. They come across endless populations of humans from every possible time and geographical origin, all mixed together. Indians, Romans, Samoans, Frisians, from all eras all next to each other. It is one of the more exciting concepts of this novel, but Farmer ultimately doesn’t do much with it. There are also some interesting theories about the Riverworld being a kind of purgatory. Then follows a long action sequence that never seems to end, after which they are captured by Göring and Burton gets lectured to by his friends about Jews. Some more exploring happens and the novel ends inconclusively.\n\nThere are whiffs of interesting, large-scale world-building in the second half of the book. And since the female characters are all discarded towards the end as irrelevant, the sexism is less immediately present because the women aren’t there for the males to react to in stupid ways, and the book almost starts to resemble a workable SF novel. But the general mess of the prose and plot is so overpowering that the novel cannot be saved. A few points for the concepts but everything else was utter drivel."
