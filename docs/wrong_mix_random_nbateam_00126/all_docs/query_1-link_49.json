        "text": "\"Like several of scholarly papers I’ve reviewed over the past two years , this one cited misses the mark because of a failure by the authors to adequately consider the underlying factors that you mention, plus it uses a different methodology for assessing the strength of a newspaper than the ones used by most scholars.\n\n\"First, simply because a newspaper is still publishing doesn’t mean it is serving its community well. Extensive research at Duke, U. Va, Stanford, Harvard, Princeton and other institutions has documented the severe decline in the quantity of local news published in surviving local newspapers over the past 15 years. That, in turn, affects everything from voter participation to corruption and high taxes paid by residents in those communities. I refer to newsrooms that are so depleted that the reporters don’t have the ability to cover those “critical information needs” (as the FCC defines them) as “ghost newspapers.” Phil Napoli documented in 2018 that roughly 1/5 of the mid-sized communities he studied over a period of a week in 2016 did not have a single locally produced story. And there is numerous research from a variety of scholars and journalists over the past two years that document the effect of the loss of newspapers and news coverage on communities – i.e. declining voter participation, etc.\n\n\"Second, what is the definition of a newspaper? Is it a standalone newspaper – or has it been merged with another newspaper and become merely a zoned edition of another paper. Both Alden [Global Capital] and Gatehouse have extensively merged smaller newspapers with one another and with a larger paper. As a result, when we do our annual survey, we often find between two, three or even more newspapers published under separate banners, but carrying identical “local” news stories – even though they may be located miles apart or in different counties.\n\n\"Third, the communities most likely to lose a newspaper (i.e. the ones that can’t find a buyer) , are those that are in economically struggling areas. The demographics of a community (household income, population growth, poverty rates) is a major factor in determining whether a newspaper owner/publisher can construct a for-profit business model. Most the closures by large PE/Hedge funds occurred in 2010-2015. Today, when they have an under-performing newspapers, they either merge it with another (still keeping the name of the newspaper alive – see item 2) or sell it to another chain.\n\n\"Fourth, how are these scholars defining “private equity”? Are they including the large private regional chains (Adams, Paxton, Ogden, Hearst), as well as the large national chains (Gatehouse, Alden, Civitas, CNHI)? The large national chains have a very different focus and management philosophy. As I have pointed out in all my reports, dating back to 2016, the family-owned chains tend to have journalistic roots and mission (balanced with shareholder return), whereas the large national chains are solely focused on shareholder return. The large private regional family-owned chains tend to have tended to have many fewer closures.\n\n\"Fifth, the trend toward weekly (3 times a week or less) print publication has been going on for a decade – and has accelerated, among independents, as well as those owned by chains, over the past two years. How a daily newspaper manages that transition for both readers and advertisers determines the long-term sustainability of the daily to weekly model for individual newspapers. Currently, there is simply not enough advertising in even large cities to support producing and distributing a print edition more than two to three times a week.\"\n\nThe Economist reports, \"The authors caution that they cannot estimate the general causal effect of private-equity buy-outs, but only the effect on the newspapers in their sample. Private-equity firms do not purchase newspapers randomly. They target failing newsrooms with potential for turnaround; papers with low circulation but high advertising rates were more likely to be bought, they found.\"\n\nWhat seems more certain is that the researchers have latched onto a very worthwhile topic and are rendering some useful facts, as described by The Economist: \"After private-equity buy-outs, papers laid off reporters and editors. Across a sample of 766 American newspapers (accounting for around 45% of total circulation), the researchers found that payrolls were about 7% lower at papers with new private-equity capital than if they had not been bought out. They also found a 16.7% relative decline in the number of articles written within five years of the buy-outs (though, admittedly, that is better than going out of business). And they identified a change in focus from local to national news: the share of articles on local politics dropped by about a tenth.\"So, private equity appears to be bad for local journalism, which is in trouble not just because newspapers are in trouble but because Americans have become less interested in local news and more interested in national news in the era of social media that make geography less meaningful, and at a time where the intensity of national politics is having deleterious effects at the local level.\n\n\"Local reporting is expensive, because it requires journalists on the ground and cannot be syndicated,\" The Economist notes. \"In a study published last year, researchers at Colorado State University, Louisiana State University and Texas A&M University concluded that when readers consume national news their views become more polarized. Poor local coverage is also associated with less competitive mayoral elections, and newsroom staff shortages are linked to lower voter turnout.\"\n\nCNN in Myanmar: naïve, nothing new, risky to locals, self-congratulatory; local and regional reports are more reliable\n\nMyanmar (Wikipedia map)\n\nBy Philip C. Winslow\n\nAt the end of March, a CNN television crew flew in to Yangon, the largest city in Myanmar, also known as Burma, where hundreds of civilians protesting an army coup have been killed, driven out of their homes and jailed.\n\nThe CNN visit, led by chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward, was approved in advance and tightly controlled by Myanmar’s junta, which on Feb. 1 overturned the November 2020 general election won by Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy. Army chiefs figured a well-regulated media event would dampen growing international criticism, and the junta reportedly hired Israeli-Canadian lobbyist Ari Ben-Menashe, to arrange it.\n\nWherever Ward’s team were allowed to go, they were accompanied by truckloads of armed soldiers and personal minders, who took notes and photographed local people reacting to the foreign journalists. Several Burmese banged pots and pans from their windows, and a few women, holding up the three-fingered salute of protest, came out and talked to Ward. (Ward said that CNN did not seek out activists, and were approached spontaneously.)\n\nAs soon as CNN left a neighborhood, security forces detained the women who had talked to Ward, hauling them off to a military interrogation center. Families spent anguished hours fearing the worst, which in Myanmar is never far away. Eleven detainees eventually were released. Their families have declined to give details, anticipating further retaliation. A military spokesman said he regretted the arrests, but security forces had thought the women would start another street protest.\n\nCNN had become the story. CNN anchors repeatedly stated that events on the ground were carefully monitored. Ward did not sugarcoat that, and described the arrest of Burmese she talked to as “a very distressing incident”. Live on air, she also reported that hundreds of civilians, including dozens of children, have been shot dead by soldiers.\n\nWith that business out of the way, CNN anchors got to what was important. John Berman and Alisyn Camerota wrapped up an Apr. 5 Q & A with this:\n\nBERMAN: Clarissa Ward, we are lucky to have you there. The world is lucky to have you there so we get a window as to what is happening. Please stay safe, you and your team. Thank you for being there.\n\nYou're going to be back live on \"THE LEAD\" at 4:00 eastern time here in the United States. Appreciate it.\n\nRemarkable, as always.\n\nCAMEROTA: Incredible -- I mean, getting that exclusive. That's the first time that we are seeing that and hearing that because she's there on the ground.\n\nBERMAN: And to have the military around her all the time.\n\nThe oleaginous self-praise for “getting that exclusive” (which more accurately would be credited to the junta and its paid lobbyist) is standard preening for CNN, but Camerota dropped a real clanger with “That's the first time that we are seeing that and hearing that because she’s there on the ground.” Camerota may have missed the weeks of graphic video and photos Myanmar journalists have been filing on their own news platforms and to international agencies.\n\nIt’s hard to gauge public reaction in Myanmar to the CNN fly-in, but some did tweet that every bit of international coverage helps call attention to the atrocities and makes Myanmar people feel less alone.\n\nSome observers, though, didn’t feel as lucky to have CNN’s star reporter in town.\n\n“It’s 2021, and we’re still parachuting celebrity white journalists into hotspots to report from these ‘far-flung’ places,” Alan Soon, a journalist and analyst in Singapore, posted on Twitter. (His comments were picked up by Vice.com and other outlets.) “CNN, if you haven’t noticed, there are plenty of great journalists in Yangon itself who have a far deeper understanding of what’s going on than someone based in London.”\n\nSoon refreshingly described foreign-correspondent-centered reporting as an “old construct.” He and others, such as multimedia journalist Namgay Zam in Bhutan, continue to plead for an end “parachute journalism.”\n\nLess turbulent situations may remain suitable for the old news model. But not stories where the presence of a foreign news crew endangers the people whose abuse they’ve come to report, and who know the story inside out. Technology has evolved too. Data and high-resolution video are transmitted any number of ways, which evolve as fast as autocrats try to squash them. Local women and men across Myanmar have been reporting the conflict for years to Reuters, The AP, The New York Times, AFP, and agencies from Europe, Japan and elsewhere in Asia. They seldom get public recognition for their work, which is fine with them: getting the story out is all that matters.\n\nControversy over CNN’s brief visit barely made the news in the U.S. But now a number of factual and ethical points need to be cleared up, mainly the details of CNN’s arrangement with the Myanmar junta and using the lobbyist Ben-Menashe in the first place. (CNN has said they were assured they would be able to move around and report freely. It’s an assurance that no one familiar with Myanmar would have bought.) Alan Soon and Sanne Breimer put the ethical questions together in a petition on Change.org.\n\nIn recent weeks, more than 700 civilians have been killed by the Myanmar security forces, and thousands more wounded. Dozens of local reporters and photographers have been beaten up and jailed.\n\nWhen bigfoot foreign news coverage is sure to endanger people under a regime as brutal as Myanmar’s, and when that coverage, like CNN’s this month, adds nothing new to the story, there’s a better way to do it. International understanding, democracy and human rights will be best served by supporting and publishing the work of local reporters, photographers and hard-pressed agencies, who operate under battlefield conditions at great risk to themselves and their families. That’s conflict journalism at its best.\n\nFor coverage of Myanmar and Southeast Asia, here are a few organizations to bookmark: Myanmar Now; Frontier Myanmar; Mizzima; The Irrawaddy; and Radio Free Asia. RFA is not a local news organization. It’s funded by an annual grant from the United States Agency for Global Media, an independent U.S. agency, the RFA web site says. Its contributors are local journalists across Asia.\n\nPhilip C. Winslow has reported for more than forty years from Europe, Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia. He worked for the Christian Science Monitor, ABC News radio, CTV News (Canadian), CBC radio, Maclean’s magazine, and the Toronto Star. He’s based in Chiang Mai, Thailand."
