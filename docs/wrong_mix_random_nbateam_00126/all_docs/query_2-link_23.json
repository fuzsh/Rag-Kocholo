        "text": "Philip Jose Farmer Dies at 91\n\nScience fiction great Philip Jose Farmer died yesterday morning âpeacefully in his sleep,â according to his official Web site, just weeks after his 91st birthday. From CNN :\n\nFarmer was known for his science-fiction and fantasy novels and short stories. He was 91.\n\nThe Peoria, Indiana, nativeâs most popular work was his \"Riverworld\" series, written in the 1970s.\n\nJoe Lansdale, a critic, writer and friend of Farmerâs, credited Farmer with changing the face of science fiction.\n\nâI just canât begin to tell you how important he is to the field as well as other fields,â Lansdale said.\n\nCritics said Farmer was the first author to address adult sexual themes in science-fiction novels.\n\nJonathan Strahan, an editor and critic for Locus magazine, said Farmer treated sex seriously, not in a juvenile manner or for cheap thrills.\n\nâIt wasnât pornography and it wasnât just about the sex of it,â Strahan said. âIt was about the sexuality of people in an interesting and intelligent way.â\n\nGraham Sleight, who wrote eloquently about Farmerâs work for his âYesterdayâs Tomorrowsâ column early in 2008, had this to say on the Locus blog:\n\nAll the weird stuff he loved to pack into his stories -- Tarzan, Richard Burton, sex, Joyce, loopy epistemology, historical trivia, flat earths -- made it a brew like nothing else.\n\nFrom Farmerâs Web site:\n\nHe will be missed greatly by his wife Bette, his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, friends and countless fans around the world.\n\nJanuary 26, 1918 - February 25, 2009. R.I.P.\n\nLabels: passages, SF/F"
