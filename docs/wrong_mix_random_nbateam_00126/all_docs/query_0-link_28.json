Armstrong of Greenwood (niece)\n\nSignature\n\nHenry was born in Prussia, 2 March 1840, having immigrated to the USA in 1847 with his parents, Daniel & Mary Catherine, who farmed in Sheboygan Co, WI. At the age of 22 yrs., Henry enlisted with Co. H, 26th Wis. Inf., 18 Aug 1862. Pvt. Welsch (aka Welsh) was 5’ 8\" tall, had blue eyes, light brown hair and a fair complexion. After surviving a gunshot wound to the right temple during the Battle of Chancellorsville 2 May 1863, he was given an honorable disability discharge 14 Oct 1863 and not considered fit for reenlistment. Emma Seidel (1843-1886) became his wife 12 Nov 1863. Their 10 children were: Daniel P. of Spokane, WA; Anna (Mrs. Halbert A.) Bright of Bright; Minnie (Mrs. Thos. J.) Selves of Colby; Henry Jr. of Colby; William F. of Spokane, WA; Louise \"Lulu\" (Mrs. Julius) Palmetier of Los Angeles, CA; Emma (Mrs. Daniel Conway, Mrs. Frank G.) Pope of Colby; Paulina \"Lena\" (Mrs. Bert S.) Barber of Minneapolis, MN; Louis of N. Chicago, IL; and Richard, who died at age 1. They purchased land in sec. 24, town of Colby (now Green Grove Twp.) during 1876, and resided there except for a short time spent in Hemlock in the mercantile business. In 1887, soon after the death of his wife, the family moved to Colby, WI. In May 1890 he was married to Mrs. Emma (Thistle) Penny, from whom he was later divorced (Mar 1899). On 7 Dec 1909, he was united in marriage to Sophia L. (Johnson) Rossman of Marshfield. Henry was a member of the I.O.O.F. and the G.A.R. The morning of 21 Feb 1912, Henry was up and about town as usual and returned home near the supper hour, but did not appear for dinner the next day at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Tom Selves. His son-in-law went to his house and found Henry lying fully dressed, dead in his bed, just 10 days short of age 72. He was buried in the Greenwood, WI City Cemetery where he was laid to rest by the side of his wife and child.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nAmerican Civil War Soldiers\n\nName: Henry Welsh RESIDENCE: Moselle, Wisconsin\n\nEnlistment Date: 18 Aug 1862 Side Served: Union State Served: Wisconsin\n\nService Record: Enlisted as a Private on 18 August 1862.\n\nEnlisted in Company H, 26th Infantry Regiment Wisconsin on 18 Aug 1862.\n\nReceived a disability discharge from Company H, 26th Infantry Regiment WI on 14 Oct 1863.\n\nU.S. Civil War Soldier Records and Profiles\n\nName: Henry Welsh Residence: Moselle, Wisconsin\n\nEnlistment Date: 18 Aug 1862 Rank at enlistment: Private\n\nState Served: Wisconsin Survived the War?: Yes Service Record:\n\nEnlisted in Company H, Wisconsin 26th Infantry Regiment on 18 Aug 1862.\n\nMustered out on 14 Oct 1863.

(1817 - 28 JUN 1883)\n\nDied, at her home in Green Grove, Clark County, Wis., on the 28th ult., Mary Katharine, wife of Daniel Welsch, in the 67th years of her age.\n\nMrs. Welsch was born in South Prussia in 1817, was married to Daniel Welsch, Dec. 12, 1837; came with her husband to Wisconsin in 1847; stopped one week in Milwaukee; from thence proceeded to Sheboygan; stopped there about two weeks, then went on a farm in the town of Moselle, same county, where they resided 32 years, or until about 4 years ago, when they came to Green Grove and settled down with their son Henry, who had preceded them here about three years. Mrs. Welsch has been more or less an invalid for the past 35 years and for the past year has been confined to her bed. Deceased was the mother of three children, one daughter and two sons, of whom, Henry is the only one left, with the aged husband, to mourn the loss of a kind mother and affectionate wife. The funeral occurred at the family residence in Green Grove Sunday, largely attended by sympathizing friends.\n\n---Source: The Abbotsford Tribune-Phonograph, Wednesday, February 20, 2008, page 2\n\n---News from 25 Feb. 1885\n\nWord was brought in Friday that sneak thieves had been at work about the premises of Henry Welsch who burned out last week. Henry had been missing articles, of more or less value for some time past, and rather suspected one Wm. Kahler, living about half a mile west, and on this Friday morning, a search warrant and warrant of arrest was placed in the hands of deputy sheriff Henry Siegrist. As a result Wm. Kahler was arraigned before Justice Wicker the next morning but before any action was taken he settled with Mr. Welsch by paying the sum of one hundred dollars and costs, amounting in all to one hundred and twenty dollars. Some exceptions might be taken to this manner of settling criminal cases, but in this instance it was the best thing that could have been done. The prisoner acknowledge that he has stolen a number of articles form Mr. Welsch, besides a number of bushels of oats, so the sum of one hundred dollars would no more than cover the loss to Mr. W. by his depredations. And, besides, Kahler has a large family, and if he had been sent to board a while, at the expense of the county, his family would have come upon the county for support. In this instance the affair costs the county nothing, and the payment of the money has a more salutary effect upon the man than a year in the county jail or State prison would have.\n\n---Died, at Hemlock, Clark Co., Wis., on Monday, Aug. 16, 1886, of summer complaint,\n\nRichard F., youngest son of Henry & Emma Welsch, aged 1 year and 24 days.\n\n---Source: Colby Phonograph (Colby, Clark County, Wis.) 05/24/1888\n\n---Welsch, Baby Girl (Birth - 23 May 1888) << right age for Ethel (1900 Census)\n\nA brand new girl put in an appearance at the home of D.

Dailey, Esq., Joseph T. Selves of Neillsville, Clark Co., and Miss Mina Welsch of Colby.\n\nMr. Selves is highly spoken of by people who have known him for years. He was for some time foreman for the late N. H. Withee. Miss Welsch is the second eldest daughter of our townsman, Henry Welsch, and is a very estimable young lady.\n\nThe marriage ceremony was performed in the presence of a number of invited guests, at 6 o’clock, immediately after the ceremony the Colby Band serenaded the couple, and then all sat down to an elegant supper prepared for the occasion.

He was born in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin, May 9, 1869, and is a son of Henry Welsh, Sr., a full biographical notice of whom will be found on another page of this volume.\n\nOur subject was reared to farm life in Sheboygan and Clark Counties, Wisconsin, and passed his youth after the manner common to most farmers sons he assisted on his father's farm, and worked in the pineries along the Black River. He has been saving of his earnings, and has shown rare judgment in their investment. He now owns 240 acres of fine land in Colby Township, eighty-five of which are under cultivation. He has made many improvements, and is fully equipped with many of the modern implements of agriculture. He is an indefatigable worker, has been very successful in all the enterprises which he has undertaken, and is one of the most promising young men of the county.\n\nMr. Welsh is a member of the Sons of the Veterans at Colby, and greatly reveres the memory of those gallant fathers who went to the rescue of the beloved flag of this country. His is unmarried.\n\n-------Source: 1819 History of Clark and Jackson County, by Franklyn, Curtiss-Wedge\n\nHENRY WELSH, SR., is an old and highly respected citizen of Clark County, Wisconsin, and the following space will be devoted to a short outline of his career. He was born in Prussia, March 2, 1840. His father, Daniel Welsh, also a native of Prussia, emigrated to the United States in 1847, and settled in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin when it was a wilderness, inhabited only by the Indians and wild animals. There the subject was reared amid the privations and hardships of frontier life. He was early accustomed to the labor incident to converting a dense forest into a fertile farm and although his life has not been an easy one, it has brought the reward of industry and perseverance. It was in 1876 that he came to Clark County and purchased a farm on section 24, Green Grove Township. He has since lived in the vicinity, excepting four years spent in the mercantile business at Hemlock, Wisconsin. He is now a resident of the village of Colby, having retired from active labors. He is a man well informed on the leading topics of the day, and has excellent business qualifications.\n\nWhen his adopted country was threatened with destruction, he responded to the call for men to come to her defense: he enlisted August 17, 1862, as a private in Company H., Twenty-sixth Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry, and served until October 14, 1863. He was then honorably discharged on account of disability caused by a gun-shot wound received in the battle of Chancellorsville, May 2, 1863. In acknowledgement of the service rendered, he is granted by the Government a pension of $17 a month.\n\nMr. Welsh was united in marriage, November 12. 1863, to Miss Emma Sidell, a native of Saxony, Germany, born July 15, 1843. This union has been blessed by the birth of nine children: Daniel P., Anna, Minnie, Henry, William, Lucy, Emma, Lena and Louis. Mrs. Welsch died September 13, 1886. Four years after, May 6, 1890, Mr. Welsh was again married, uniting with Miss Emma Penny, widow of the late O. W. Penny, and daughter of John Thistle, and a native of Newfoundland. She had two children by her first marriage Arthur and Lucy.\n\nMr. Welsh, since his residence in Colby, which dates from August, 1887, has held many township offices, and has discharged the duties devolving upon him with great fidelity. He is a member of the I. O. O. F. and the G. A. R. post of Colby.\n\n--------------------------\n\nHENRY WELSCH (aka: Welsh)\n\nFrom the index of the Colby, WI Centennial (1873 - 1973)\n\nWelsch, Henry Jr. [Sketches of Pioneers, page 21, column 2, photo of business, page 21, columns 1 & 2] He purchased the drayline from his father in 1911 and in the fall of that year, engaged in the coal business.
