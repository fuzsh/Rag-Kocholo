        "text": "GREGORY AIN (1908-1988)\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh PA, Ain was raised in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles CA. For a short time during childhood, the Ain family lived at Llano del Rio, an experimental collective farming colony in the Antelope Valley of California. He was inspired to become an architect after visiting the Rudolf Schindler House as a teenager. He attended the University of Southern California School of Architecture in 1927-1928 but dropped out after feeling limited by Beaux Arts training. Ain's primary influences were Rudolf Schindler and Richard Neutra. He lived in Neutra's then-new VDL Research House for a while and worked for Neutra from 1930 to 1935. He also worked for Harwell Hamilton Harris.\n\nAin's first wife Agnes was the roommate of Galka Scheyer, the client for Ain's first completed commission working with Neutra. His second wife Josephine Cohen later married Robert Chuey and had Neutra design them a house. Beginning in 1935, Ain cultivated a practice designing modest houses for working-class clients featuring flexible floor plans and open kitchens. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1940 to study prefab housing. During WWII, he was Chief Engineer for Charles and Ray Eames in the development of their well-known plywood chairs.\n\nAfter working for the Eames office, he formed a partnership with architects Joseph Johnson and Alfred Day and landscape architect Garrett Eckbo to design large housing tracts. He later had a partnership with James Garrott, a Black architect. They built a small office building together on Hyperion Avenue in the Silver Lake neighborhood. Ain also taught architecture at USC after WWII.\n\nAin's projects attracted the attention of Philip Johnson, the curator of architecture at the Museum of Modern Art, who engaged Ain to build a house in the Museum's garden in 1950, officially missing for 70 years until USModernist's George Smart found it. At the same time, Ain was accused of being communist and was actively investigated and spied on (by among others, the family babysitter) by the FBI starting in 1941. J. Edgar Hoover considered him the most dangerous architect in America - which caused the loss of many commissions including participation in the famous Case Study Program. At times he had to use an alias, Fred Grant.\n\nAin left California and from 1963 to 1967 served as the Dean of the Pennsylvania State University School of Architecture. He died in 1988, leaving one daughter, Emily, and a son, Christopher. Ain's archives are at the Architecture and Design Collection at the University of California Santa Barbara.\n\n\"Ain idolized Schindler,\" recalled architect John Blanton, who also worked for Richard Neutra. \"But Ain was more user-oriented; he wanted his designs to work for the clients, and therefore might compromise style. Because of this, clients loved him.\" Bio adapted from Wikipedia.\n\nSubdivisions: Modernique * Park Planned\n\n1929 - The Mrs. C. Ain Triple Dwelling, Los Angeles CA.

Commissioned in 1938. The second owners enclosed the deck behind the garage. Sold in 1960 to Roy and Delores Dundas. Sold in 2003 to architect Barry Milofsky who did a renovation lasting until 2007. Color photos by Michael Locke and Samuel Dématraz.\n\nInstead of the usual right angles, Ain Streamline Moderne with curved walls along the upper corners and garden walls. According to Milofsky, the Beckers wanted a 'party house,' with access to a roof deck. There was originally an open patio behind a privacy wall at the street level, and a narrow deck on the east side in back of the garage and at the lower level where the dining room was located. A dumbwaiter was installed to bring food from the kitchen at the lower level. A second owner enclosed the deck behind the garage. The third owners, Roy and Delores Dundas, purchased the house in 1960.\n\nDundas made significant alterations, including relocating the kitchen to the enclosed patio area on the street level, maintaining a small patio off the kitchen and adding a powder room between the front door and the garage. A second bedroom was added on the lower level, and a large deck off the living room.\n\nAfter purchasing the home in 2003, Milofsky began the task of upgrading the out-of-date elements, exposing and refinishing the original hardwood floors, upgrading 40-year old kitchen appliances, adding lighting in the living room and deck, and removing extensive mini blinds to expose the views. In 2007, he added a large open-able skylight in the kitchen to allow light into the living room and replaced the kitchen roof to reestablish the original garage roof/fascia line in front of the house. In keeping with Ain, he added a floating shelf in the kitchen and cabinets below the living room windows, assuming the original design. Original railings were re-created plus the original Ain color palette to the upper level.\n\n1939 - The Urcel Daniel House, 1856 Micheltorena Street, Los Angeles CA.

Unbuilt. House there was built in 1954.\n\n1947 - The Lena Horne Alterations, 2136 Nichols Canyon Road, Los Angeles CA. However, in the book, Stormy Weather: The Life of Lena Horne by James Gavin, there is no mention of an alteration or any relationship with Ain. Assessor has house dated 1942/1943 (usually a second date means when there was an improvement).\n\n\"Horne appealed to a Jewish friend to help her locate a house (in 1947). 'Something away where I won't offend anyone,' she added ruefully. (She is talking about the restrictions in neighborhoods based on race.) She wound up in Nichols Canyon, a mostly liberal neighborhood in the Hollywood Hills. Her new address, 2136 Nichols Canyon, lay on the winding road where Betty Garrett lived; Ava Gardner was close by.\"\n\nSo it is possible that he indeed did some interior alterations for her. This is from the book Gregory Ain: The Modern home as Social Commentary by Anthony Denzern:\n\nIn 1946, 15 members of the motion picture cartoonists union met to discuss forming a housing cooperative. It would prove to be Ain's largest project, called \"Community Homes\", and had it been realized, certainly the most significant. Homes were to be laid out on an L-shaped parcel at the northeast corner of Victory Blvd and White Oak, bounded by Van Owen and Louise Avenue, in Van Nuys. The co-op grew from 15 homes to 280. Ain worked with architects Joseph Johnson and Alfred W. Day, forming a brief partnership of Ain, Johnson and Day, with their office in Silverlake. The project hit a snag with the conservative political positioning of the FHA and its restrictive covenants (the co-op members were 15% non-white, including Lena Horne), and the co-op eventually disbanded by 1949. Later that year the land was sold. Needs verification.\n\n1948 - The Mar Vista Housing, Beethoven, Moore, Meier, and Marco Place, Venice CA. Designed with Joseph Johnson and Alfred Day. The Mar Vista Tract development was planned in 1947 for one hundred homes on a 60-acre lot by Avondale Development Company. They only built 52 homes with 7 house types. By rotating the one floor plan in different directions, Ain was able to create a sense of variation between the houses. The development was designated as a Historic Preservation Overlay Zone by the City of Los Angeles in 2003. There are 52 addresses. Color photos by Michael Locke.\n\nThe model house was 3508 Moore Street, originally owned by James and Jeanette Donnell. Sold to Steve and Susanna Shinmoto. Sold in 2012 to Dianne Vanderlip.\n\n1948 - The Eric Barrett House, 3741 Woodstock Road, Hollywood Hills CA. Unbuilt.\n\n1948 - The Avenel Cooperative Housing Project, 2839-2849 Avenel Street, Los Angeles CA. Designed with Joseph Johnson and Alfred Day. Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2005, an unusually successful cooperative FHA-funded project where ten families pooled resources. The innovative design is noteworthy for the flexible use of space and open concept with sliding walls between the master bedroom and the living room and between the smaller bedrooms as well as private patios. The project was hailed as a model for low-cost urban housing in utilizing limited space. Photos by Michael Locke.\n\n2841 1/2 Avenel: The Serril & Lilli Gerber House. First sold in 2006 to Kevin Lane. Sold in 2010 to Zachary Rae.\n\n2843 Avenel: The Carl & Dorothy Brant House.

Altered.\n\n1948 - The Albert Tarter House, 2401 St. George Street, Los Angeles CA. Sold in 1997 to Lynn Salle. Ain originally met Albert Tarter through the motion picture cartoonists' union whose members met in January 1946 to discuss forming a housing cooperative. The group, consisting of 15 members of the union, called itself \"Community Homes.\" Within weeks, 88 families had subscribed to the plan. The group drew up by-laws and purchased 100 acres of land at the corner of Victory Boulevard and White Oak Avenue. The project was to be the first fully conceived social and aesthetic solution to Los Angeles housing shortage in the post war era. Ultimately the FHA rejected the plan due to the fact that the project was to be integrated, at a time when the agency openly advocated racial segregation of minorities. Tarter, an animator, would retain Ain to build a house for him on a hillside lot in Los Feliz, adapting one of the original plans from the Community Homes project.

After the exhibition at MOMA, the house went \"missing for 71 years\" as no one could figure out what happened to it. Even a sizable New York Times article in 2017 failed to produce any clues. A model from 1950 was discovered in model maker Theodore Conrad's Jersey City home and was purchased by MOMA. Many researchers looked for it, but in 2021 USModernist's George Smart found it, remarkably intact, located in Croton-on-Hudson NY.\n\nHere's the story: the house was auctioned by MOMA in late 1950 by MOMA to I. M. and Marcella Skol (formerly Skolnikoff) family. Marcella Skol's father Hyman dissassembled the house in late 1950 and put it in storage until the middle of 1951 when he began reconstruction at 155 South Mount Airy Road, Croton-on-Hudson NY.\n\nThe Skols owned it until 1969 when the house was bought by Iris and Paul Stevens. According to their son, David, his family knew it was an \"architect-designed\" house but had no idea it was connected to Ain or MOMA. Paul Stevens did two major extensions: converting a space off the kitchen to a dining room, and extending a powder room to a 3rd bedroom, where David grew up. There was a full fruit orchard in the front yard, a holdover from the Skols. When the Stevens divorced, the Kelly family bought it in 1980. They replaced the orchard with a lawn and adjacent beautiful gardens. The Kellys are still there as of 2022. Read the 2021 New York Times Article about USModernist's discovery.
