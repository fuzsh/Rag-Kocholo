        "text": "Farmer's enthusiasm for the characters of his childhood reading – the Oz books, Sherlock Holmes, the work of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Rider Haggard and Jules Verne – led him to construct an elaborate relationship between them. In Tarzan Alive! (1972), Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life and The Other Log of Phileas Fogg (both 1973) Farmer speculated that the meteorite which landed near Wold Newton in Yorkshire in the 18th century had been radioactive, and that the mutant descendants of the residents had extraordinary powers. Not only Tarzan and Doc Savage, but such figures as Sherlock Holmes, Richard Hannay, Bulldog Drummond, Jack the Ripper, James Bond and Lord Peter Wimsey were gleefully swept into this sprawling private mythology.\n\nIn much the same spirit, when Kurt Vonnegut created the character of Kilgore Trout, a failed science fiction hack writer, Farmer immediately appropriated the name and published Venus on the Half-Shell (1975) as by him.\n\nPhilip José Farmer was born on January 26 1918 at North Haute Terre, Indiana, though the family settled at Peoria, Illinois, where Farmer lived for the latter part of his life. As a child, he was a voracious reader and was especially keen on adventure stories and Greek mythology.\n\nIn 1941 he returned to Missouri to study Ancient Greek, but he had by this point met Bette Andre, and in May that year they married secretly, and he dropped out of college.\n\nFarmer enrolled in the Army Air Corps as a cadet, and while he was training in Texas the Japanese launched the attack on Pearl Harbor. He never completed his training, and expected to be drafted; but instead he got a job with the Keystone Steel and Wire company, where he remained for more than a decade. His first short story, O'Brien and Obrenov, appeared in the magazine Adventure in 1946, which encouraged him to return to university, and in 1950 he completed his degree at Bradley.\n\nTwo years later Farmer scored his first real success with the novella The Lovers, generally reckoned to be the first treatment of sex in science fiction. It appeared in Startling Stories after being rejected by the two leading editors in the field who had deemed it \"nauseating\"; it won Farmer the Hugo award for most promising new author. The story concerned a man who falls in love with an insectoid alien.\n\nHe had success with a series of stories featuring Father John Carmody, a murderous priest who becomes entangled in a number of theological puzzles on several different planets. Religion was an abiding concern, notably in Jesus on Mars (1979), but he also continued to write graphically biological tales – one of the best, My Sister's Brother, was repeatedly rejected as \"disgusting\" until it appeared in Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1960.\n\nFarmer's first book, The Green Odyssey, an entertaining yarn about escape from an alien planet, appeared in 1957, by which time he was working as a technical writer for General Electric and living at Syracuse, New York. The following year he transferred to Motorola, which posted him to Arizona and Michigan. He continued to publish stories, however, and the climate was becoming gradually more receptive to his explicit content. Perhaps the most successful of Farmer's scatological tales was the novella Riders of the Purple Wage (1967).\n\nFarmer gained more acclaim for his World of Tiers sequence (five novels, beginning with The Maker of Universes in 1965) set in a series of parallel universes, and began to write erotic fantasies for Essex House, a publisher eager to take advantage of the looser mores of the era.\n\nA Feast Unknown (1969) began Farmer's obsession with reinventing characters such as Tarzan and Doc Savage, which he continued with the spoof biography Tarzan Alive! and continued in such tales as The Adventure of the Peerless Peer (1974) and Ironcastle. The first, which featured Sherlock Holmes and Tarzan, incurred the wrath of the Edgar Rice Burroughs estate, and Farmer rewrote it, substituting Kipling's Mowgli; but in 1999 he went on to publish, with the Burroughs estate's blessing, his first official Tarzan novel.\n\nThe preoccupation with historical and fictional characters also surfaced in Farmer's best-known sequence, the Riverworld novels, the best of which is the first, To Your Scattered Bodies Go (1971). In them, everyone who has ever lived is resurrected along the banks of an infinitely long river by a race of godlike aliens. The ensuing adventures feature such characters as Sir Richard Burton, Mark Twain and Jack London.\n\nOf his 70 or so books, also notable are the Dayworld novels (published from 1985), which imagine a population kept in suspended animation and roused only one day each week, The Unreasoning Mask (1981), The Wind Whales of Ishmael (1971), and A Barnstormer in Oz (1982), in which Dorothy's son, a pilot, visits L Frank Baum's invention.\n\nFarmer, an attractive, genial figure, won three Hugos, a Nebula Grand Master's award and a Lifetime Achievement World Fantasy award. He never bothered to get connected to the internet."
