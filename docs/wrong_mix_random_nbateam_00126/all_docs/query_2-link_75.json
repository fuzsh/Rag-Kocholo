Cloth and boards. 8vo, black cloth over burgundy boards, Mylar-protected colorful dust jacket (unclipped) depicting cartoon & outlandish characters--often turned malignant--from Alice in Wonderland , etc., 278 pages. Very Fine / Very Fine. Item #832\n\n\"More than twenty years ago, Philip Jose Farmer began the epic chronicle of the planet called Riverworld, and of the thirty-five billion men and women who woke there one morning to begin the first day of life after death. Resurrected by the power of an alien race, for reasons they can only guess at, unlikey fellow travelers like Mark Twain, Hermann GÃ¶ring, and Cyrano de Bergerac wander the banks of a ten-million-mile-long river in search of their makers and the answers to this mystery.\"--from the jacket flap.\n\nEXCEPTIONAL CONDITION and a remarkably inventive SCI-FI tale!"
