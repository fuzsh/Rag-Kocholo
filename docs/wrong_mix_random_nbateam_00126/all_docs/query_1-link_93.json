        "text": "Daniel Bryan to Mary Barbour Bryan , January 1821\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition: Gift of PWL, 2010\n\nTranscription: Richmond January 1821\n\nMy dear Mary,\n\nMy two last letters have, doubtless, found a harbor in your bosom ere now. The first was given in charge to Mr. C. Macon; the second, accompanied by a dress of Bombazette for you, was committed to the care of a Mr. Yancey. On Friday next I hope to learn by a letter from you that they have reached you. Your last favour came to hand in due time, and broke through the gloom with which the atmosphere had environed my spirits like a stream of sunshine through dark clouds. You say nothing about the health of the family. I, therefore, take it for granted that you are all blessed with good health. Knowing the liability of your estimable mother to spells of indisposition, and the exposing to which during her illness you too inconsiderately subject yourself, I experience much solicitude lest every letter I receive may bring me the unwelcome intelligence which I most sincerely deprecate, of either her or your being sick. Be prudent, my Mary, in whatever regards your health, even a few severe colds may shatter your constitution worse than the mere operation of time in half a score of years. By temperance and a circumspect avoidance of whatever may shock my constitution, I hope to look fresh and vigorous in old age, although I have but little of that appearance now, should a kind Providence be pleased to protract my days to that period. And I fondly hope I shall be blessed with a companion of congenial health and vigour in the person of my darling Mary.\n\nWhile other members of the Legislature are rapidly consuming the oil of their constitutions in every species of midnight licentiousness and profligacy, I am wrapped in the refreshing embraces of sweet Repose, dreaming of my beloved wife and our precious little pledge of love. I go to bed, and I rise early, and in this course I find a decided advantage. If I had my Mary by my side or in my arms, I would, I doubt not, spend hours in bed awake, which I now give to sleep. But when I cannot enjoy the felicities which flow from actual enjoyment, I must be contented with that which approaches nearest to itâand these I find in those moments of rapturous slumber, when I imagine you folded in my arms and tenderly pressed to my bosom, kissing me with all the ardour of glowing affection.\n\nWe have a number of genteel young men at our table, several of whom, by the bye, are from the North, and are, therefore, exempt from the fashionable vice which characterizes the gay young men of the South. I have the vanity to think that I am somewhat of a favourite among them and frequently take the liberty of expressing my opinion to them on the subject of matrimony. My constant advice to them is \"Leave the frigid zone of celibacy where wintry desolation reigns with heart-chilling gloom and transfer yourselves to the kindly and ambrosial paradise of wedlock.\" I talk to them of the sweets of congenial affection crowned by the endearments of prattling babes etc etc. They complain of the hard times and the consequent difficulty of getting along, even without what they call the \"encumbrance of a wife.\" I reply that a good help mate would aid in tugging the boat of fortune against the stream of difficulties which flows from the bitter fountains of public and private embarrassment. I tell them what my experience proves to me on the subject, and although you charge me sometimes with never complimenting you in relation to your domestic virtues, yet my dear Mary, I never fail upon those occasions to enumerate the many advantages which I have experienced from those virtues and never fail to say as much in your praise as becomes a husband to say in praise of his wife. And yet, my love, I never bestow upon you eulogium which I do not think you most cordially deserve. I have found you kind, attentive, and affectionate. You have, too, notwithstanding your professions of a disposition sometimes to pursue a different course, manifested in a most laudable degree an attention to the virtues of domestic management and a sensible and praiseworthy frugality, which bespeaks a mind possessed of a dignified rationality which is never displayed by the shallow-witted bubbles of female folly. Seeing you possess this excellence in reality, I doubt not that your good sense has, ere now, shown you the propriety of accommodating your creed to your practice. I never flatter you, my dear Mary, because flattery is founded in hypocrisy and hypocrisy is detestable. And many times I withhold open praise when my heart awards it to you because I would rather you should think me too sparing of it than appear inclined to deal lavishly in eulogy to your face. What I say now, in behalf of your excellencies, you will, therefore, not suspect for smelling in the least of adulation.\n\nWhen I speak in commendation of matrimony, I never let slip the opp'ty to intimate that the virtues of my own dear Mary are the foundation upon which I build my faith in the superior happiness of the married, over the single state. And such you may depend is the constitution of my mind that no such preference would escape from my lips nor no such intimation would flow from them, were your virtues not such as to warrant them. Having been speaking of matrimony, it will hardly look like a digression to tell you that on Thursday night last Miss Maria Barbour of Petersburg, Mr. J. S. B's sister, became a wife. Mr. Barbour, who informs me that he is much pleased with the Gentleman whom she surrendered the key of her virgin charms, was at the marriage. He is the same man from the South of whom I heard you speak as having an eye upon the fee simple of her person. [Rest missing]\n\nUnknown cousin to Caroline Bryan , 13 September 1838\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition: WHM Purchase, 2013\n\nTranscript: Charlottesville, Va. Sept 13th 1838\n\nAfter a most unpleasant, dusty and disagreeable journey I arrived at this place last night about ten o'clock, vexed with myself and as I thought with everybody else in the World. In this I was really somewhat excusable, for I had been travelling two days & nights without interruption with eleven passengers in the Stage. I determined in my own mind that if I ever lived to get home, disagreeable as it might be, and possessing not one claim to make it desirable, except that it was my home, I would sit myself down there and contentedly breathe out the balance of time that might be allotted me, taking no concern in the affairs of the world, nor suffering myself to be interested in its joys or its sorrows. In this mood of mind I arrived and was walking about the Hotel waiting for supper, when I was accosted by John & Ned Downing who had been sent by their mother to see if I was in the Stage and to ask me as late as it was, to go where she was staying as she was most anxious to see me. Without waiting for supper (for I still care nothing about eating) I went with them. Mrs. D. was apparently delighted to see me and was also Miss Downing. After being [with] them a short time she told me that she had a letter for me from Alabama. I was at a great loss to know who of my friends in Alabama could have known that I was to be in Charlottesville, for I had not written home that I intended to make a visit to the Springs. The letter however was produced, and to my great delight proved to be your most acceptable, & kind letter, of the 4th. And now my dearest Carry, although I will not say I thank you for your kindness, for that would be a waste of words and be very far from expressing the feelings which its reception produced, but this much I will say, that I now look forward with much brighter and happier anticipation to my return to the District since I have the promise that I am to be welcomed back by the sweet smiles of the \"pouting lips,\" the bright flash of the bonny eyes and the wild and enchanting merriment of my beautiful cousin. Really the reception of your letter has made as sober and staid a gentleman as I am, quite poetical. But now I think of it these poetical expressions are but quotations, you understand where they came from. But I am in a rhyming mood almost for the first time in my life, and you shall have the benefit of it, upon one condition however, and that is that the verses be not shown to your good Father. I know the commandment \"Honour thy Father,\" and would not advise its violation in the least little, but there is nothing in that which requires a child to show to the Parent all the nonsensical effusions which she may have been the innocent cause of inspiring. But in my first attempt I should not like to be criticized and especially by one for whose taste and judgment in such matters I have a very high regard, and therefore I make the injunction. I have before told you, my cousin, that I was a fortune teller, but I never told you that I was a poetical one. Well, I am going to tell your fortune, and I am going to tell it in verse, yes in Rhyming but all Rhymes are not poetry, so says Dr. Blair, and his authority is not to be doubted. Whether you will dignify it with the name of Poetry after you have read it, I trust you will one day tell me. But I keep you waiting, well as novelists sometimes say, \"any think so important, should not be commenced at the close of a chapter.\" Neither shall my verses at the bottom of this sheet.\n\nTo Miss Mary Caroline Bryan Lady you are young and gay And may not harken to my lay But in thy Horoscope I read What's sure to happen, then take heed. For I will a tale unfold That shall charm both young & old Then listen and I'll tell to thee They fortune and thy Destiny. Lovely one! A magic power Presided o'er thy natal hour To guard thee safe from every ill, And it hovers round thee still. Fairies present, at thy birth Called thee fairest child of Earth And around their magic ring Still they dance and still they sing And this the burthen of their song Ever bright & ever young Beautiful as Houris are Be Mary, fairest of the fair!! From a Wizard of the Dell In his dark and lonely cell Where Cauldrons boil and charms are burnt I thy destiny have learnt. Listen then I say again Nor think it frivolous & vain Listen! And I'll tell to thee How brilliant is that Destiny.\n\nMary! In thy days of youth Hear me for I speak the truth None shall be so prized as thee In thy love and constancy And thy beauty and thy grace And thy cheerful smiling face Shall for thee affection gain From all, whom you desire to win. And the course of true Love too, Shall most smoothly run for you And the choice of thy young breast Shall be obtained & thou be blest Health and beauty long shall last When thy days of youth are past And thy lord shall love & bless Thy virtue and thy loveliness Wealth shall too around thee pour Choicest treasures from her store And no wish of thine shall bide Long until tis gratified And when thy days of life are o'er And you on Earth are seen no more A welcome entrance shall be given To Mary in the Court of Heaven\n\nCousin, my lay is word and your futures told, do you like it? You say you make heavy drafts on the future. It surely does not require a great stretch of the imagination to believe all that the wizard told me and that I have told you. I could not if I would believe that any thing but the most brilliant destiny was awaiting you, Carry. But do you believe it? If you do 'tis sure to happen. I wrote you from the Red Sulphur. I wish I had [hole in page] back, 'twas a silly letter, & I have been sorry ever since I sent it. [hole]presume no one has seen it but yourself & you know how to [hole] away, for one who is either \"in bad health, or in bad spirits or age [hole] some absent fair one.\" I was in most intolerable spirits and almost dying of ennui when I wrote that letter. But really I should like to know what there is in Charlottesville to sooth the distressed or comfort the broken hearted. I had like to have forgotten that Miss Gibbons is here. She is really beautiful, much the handsomest person that I have seen in the mountains. I admire her beauty but only saw her for a short time last night when I was so much engaged talking to Mrs. Downing that I had not an opportunity of deciding whether I should like her or not. Mrs. Downing speaks of going with me to Washington and starting tomorrow night. If she should not I shall start at that time & go by the way of Warrenton, so that I shall see you by Thursday night at farthest & probably on Sunday. If you should not see me on Sunday won't you write to me to direct to Warrenton, and tell me how you like my poetry? Do cousin. I can't write any more without marring my verses; that you know would be a pity. But I cannot conclude without asking you to remember me most kindly to all the members of the [hole] family & at the same time to believe me most sincerely yours [hole]\n\nBenjamin Johnson Barbour to Caroline Bryan , 13 April 1840\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition: Gift of PWL, 2010\n\nTranscript: University of Virginia April 13, 1840\n\nDear Cousin,\n\nAlthough I have not received a letter from you since writing my last, yet in the hope that one is now on the way, I snatch a few moments from my laborious studies to scrawl a few lines to youâand here let me add that after your long delay, you will I hope never hereafter accuse me of being a bad correspondent. You postscript, containing as you say the main part of your letter, has been attended to, but I am at a loss of know how to convey to you the present. I have determined to retain it until I shall have the pleasure (great pleasure let me add) of seeing you again. Well! How did you like the \"Wager.\" Please give me your candid opinion of it and above all tell me if you were offended by my using your name as the heroine. That the slightest offence could be taken never entered my head until I received a letter from Cousin Philippa Barbour to whom I had sent a copy of the Collegian, in which she remarked that the story would have been much better had I chosen some name other than yours.\n\nWell now to be a little egotistical, let me give you a short account of my condition, hopes, fears, and expectations. I am dragging out a weary existence here in the midst of musty text books and uninteresting lectures and even my small portion of respite is broken in upon for when in sleep and in happy dreams I revel in the happy anticipations of the Future, or once more enjoy in memory the joys of the Past, I am awakened to the cold reality of a College life by the everlasting ding-dong of the bell which summons me once more to the dull routine of the day before. In fine my only pleasure is in the luxury of a segar, and while surrounded by a cloud of my own making, I endeavor to forget the things that are around, and look forward to that which is to come. I am a candidate for three or four Diplomas this session and have made pretty good progress towards obtaining them, but Cousin, I am tired of this monotonous life. I want to be abroad in the world. I believe that there is more true and useful knowledge to be gained by one month's intercourse with the world than by poring for a century over the dusty records of the past. And yet they will prate to me about the beauties of Science, the mysteries of Mathematics, the flowers of literature, and the sweetness of the Greek and Roman spring. Pshaw! There is not half the sweetness in it that there is in giving full play to our feelings and affections in the society of those that we love. I hope after this session to be freed from this thralldom and to spend my time pleasantly and if the world be filled as the cold hearted would make us believe, with so many cares and vexations, let me at least prove it to my own satisfaction. âBut enough of this.\n\nWe are to have an Episcopal Convention here next month, and every head except mine is turned with the expectations of merriment and amusement. All the beauty and talent of Virginia are to be collected here into a focus and astonish the natives with the brilliancy of its rays. Conquests are to be made and in short it is to be made the epoch in the history of many a belle and beauâbut I never hear a word about the great end for which they are ostensibly to assembleâthe worship of Godâthat seems to have been entirely forgotten in their schemes and plans of petty ambition.\n\nI was down in Orange a few weeks ago and Father and Mother desired to be kindly remembered when I next wrote to you. All and more especially one would be glad to see you again within the confines of Virginia and I hope that you will not turn a deaf ear to the wishes of those who desire your speedy return to your friends in the East. Shall I not have the pleasure of seeing you next summer? I have a request to make of you which I hope you will not refuse. You perhaps may have forgotten that when I parted from you two years ago, you gave me a lock of your hair. Well, I preserved it carefully and before I was able to apply it as I intended, the paper which contained it dropt from my pocket. Now I know that you can spare one tress, a small curlâWill you not enclose one to me in your next letter?\n\nWhen you write again pray tell me what you are doing, for I am entirely in the dark as to what you are about. Forgive this miserable scrawl. Write soon. And believe me as ever, your affectionate Cousin\n\nB. I. Barbour You must also excuse the horrid shape of this letter, for I find I have written so much on the outside that to conceal it defies all symmetry. B. I. B.\n\n[written at the top by Caroline is the following] Oh! Ma I forget always to give my love to Mary Nickolls and Mrs. Childs. Do you think of visiting the mountains this summer? This letter will stand in place of my weekly one. Carry\n\nAndrew Wylie, Sr. to Andrew Wylie, Jr. , 22-25 November 1842\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition: Gift of PWL, 2010\n\nTranscript: Nov. 22-25, 1842\n\nDr. Son:\n\nYour letter of the 12th inst. filled me with indescribable pain, grief and fear. Pain & grief that you have been so left to yourself as to have acted in the matter as you did, and still more that you still look upon it with the views & feelings disclosed in your letter. I feel it my duty to point out wherein you did wrong that you may yet lay it to heart & repent before it is too late. For, be assured, a holy God is offended & your sin will find you out. You erred 1st in \"facing\" Butler & repeating your question \"audibly & emphatically.\" When he came and sat beside you it was his part, not yours, to begin the conversation & when you did begin it by asking the question which politeness indeed required him to answer, you owed it to yourself to treat him afterwards simply with neglect. By asking him directly or indirectly for an explanation you shewed that you valued his esteem and considered him a gentleman, which his silence and behavior on the occasion shewed he was not. Much more was it wrong, therefore, for you to go back to ask for an explanation, as it carried with it the idea that on consideration you were disposed to grieve the loss of a worthy man's esteem. What, then, should you have done. Why just nothing. I would not have even moved from my position nor taken notice of him in any way after he refused to answer my question. Had he been a friend up to that point or on any other account entitled to high respect from you in particular the case had been different. As it was you let yourself down, from that place of self respect which you should have maintained, by acting as you did. Neither his esteem nor his favor any way was necessary to you. Why then should you show any concern on the subject?\n\nThe next thing in which you erred was in answering the question \"Will you fight?\" as you did. You might have here imitated Butler's silence, & thus treated him and his representative Murray as he had treated youâfor in matters of etiquette the law which forbids retaliation will not apply. Had you said anything, it should have been, of course, the truth according to your real & professed principles, which would have been in substance the same with the statement in your letter to me, viz \"The whole practice is barbarous & wicked.\" This was your belief. Why not avow it then. No man can incur contempt justly who in all cases acts up to his principles. Men of [science?] respect him even when they differ from him. You were not in principle a duelist. Why then not have the courage to say so to a duelist? Was it for fear he might think or call you a coward? That you might have guarded against by letting him know that you would in case of attack defend yourself & show whatever courage and discretion you had in that way. I say and discretion for it is no part of courage to seek an encounter with a skunk. What you say in excuse on this point gives me more pain than your conduct itself as it shews your principles to be not firmly fixed. What if the moral & religious part of the community be \"hollow\" and \"hypocritical\" in their professed abhorrence of dueling (which by the way I do not think they are) are you prepared to act on the principle of doing whatever the voice of fashion will dictate? If so, your profession of Christianity, to say nothing of moral honesty is \"hollow in the extreme.\" To be consistent, then, you must either renounce your profession of Christianity for sake of retaining the smiles of a hollow hearted community of nominal Christians & hypocritical pretending to morality, or, you must, like Lot in Sodom, consent for convenience sake to live in such a communityâa thing which under a sense of duty a righteous man may sometimes consent to doâor, leave the community. The latter, with my deliberate conventions of duty & interest, I should do in your case, i.e., on the supposition that the voice of the religious part of the community is at bottom in favor of dueling. Yes, & I would abandon the profession of the law tooâanythingâeverythingâlife, reputation all earthly goodârather than do what in my conscience & before God, I believed to be wrong, morally wrong.\n\nThirdly: though this is comparatively a small matter, when Butler delivered the \"verbal challenge\" even on the principles of dueling, you ought to have known you were not bound to notice it in any way & you should have indignantly spurned Murray from your presence for offering you such an insult in your office. By the way, this piece of conduct in Murray is enough to convince any man that he is either a simpleton or a villain, or, what I suppose from what the history of his agency in the affair shews, is more likely a tertium quid made of equal portions of both the other elements.\n\nOn looking over your letter again I perceive what had escaped me, that you seem to found your opinion of the hollowness & hypocrisy of the religious community as it respects dueling on your own experience for you say \"My own experience satisfied me\" etc.. If by this you mean that the community in & about Pittsburg, the religious part of it especially did not countenance you because you refused to accept a challenge on a former occasion (the particulars of which if I ever knew them are now forgotten) you must surely be mistaken: for from what I understand from various quarters you stand well with the community in which you live both as it respects your profession as a lawyer and as to your character generally. The good people of Pittsburg, on the contrary, will lower themselves much in my estimation if they do not demand of you in the regular way of church discipline a candid & open acknowledgment of what you have done amiss in this thing as the indispensible condition of your enjoying their countenance in future or even continuing to be recognized any longer as a member in good standing in any particular religious society or the religious community at large. You say the whole town is on your side. As against Murray or Butler it may be so, & for the credit of the town as well as your own I am happy to believe it is so; but as it respects your conduct in itself considered & especially considered in reference to its bearings as an example set by a professed believer in Christianity & the son of a clergyman I should be sorry to think that it meets the approbation of the town or any part of the town except the \"boys.\" These may \"tip their hats\" to you more than before but if that raises any other sentiment in your mind in moments of sober reflection, than mortification, shame, & sorrow, then I shall be grieved & mortified to think that the pains taken in forming your character to a high sense of propriety & moral purity have beenâalas!âin vain.\n\nI proceed to notice a portion of your letter which has filled me with thoughts and fears for your \"fate\" which I would be guilty of the greatest unfaithfulness to God and to you if I did not lay before you in the plainest manner. You say \"as to my own fate, somehow or other I had no fears. I felt as much assured as if the deed was done that my opposer would never return living from the field & not a hair of my head would be injured.\" And there are other expressions in your letter amounting to something like gratitude to God for sustaining you in the course you took. A shuddering & horror came over me when I read these things. You had \"somehow or another\" this confidenceâlet me put the thing in plain Englishâyou had preternatural impressions made on your mind that you would be enabled to doâa deed which in your own conscience you know was wrong, a violation of the law of God & at variance, nay directly opposed to the whole spirit of that religion which you had professed & to whose Author you hold yourself indebted for all your hopes of happiness hereafter, i.e., you expected God would keep you safe while committingâmurder!!!\n\nOn the subject of impressions generally I suppose you may now have no distinct remembrance of what I may have said either in my public or private instructions. I must, therefore, give you my views here somewhat in detail. The Sacred Scriptures, you know, everywhere hold out the idea that help from God may be expected and should be sought for in the devout exercises of the mind going to him in the way of his appointment and in obedience to his most holy will as made known to us in his word:--also that the Evil One, who is said to work in the hearts of the children of disobedience, is permitted to tempt men to sin, & that in doing so he often transforms himself into an angel of light. In what manner this is done, or how far this malignant spirit may be suffered to go we cannot tell. I have always been cautious in speaking dogmatically on such subjects. The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked, and its own promptings, without any foreign aid, are sufficient to account for the most of the sins which men commit. Yet there are cases in which man has been known to act so very strangely and so far out of his ordinary character that there seems to be a necessity of resorting to the agency of Satan in order to account for it: and I solemnly declare to you that on first reading your letter when I came to the part, quoted above, in which you express your confidence of success or victory or whatever you might call it in the expected encounter the thought forcibly struck me that this illusion was the work of him whom our Savior characterizes as a murderer from the beginning; and the more I have thought of it since, the more have I been confirmed in this opinion. I say, then, it was an illusion of the devil. For it promised you impunity in the ways of disobedience to the commands of God. And suppose it had so turned out as the illusion promisedâand you had killed Butlerâwhat now had been your thoughts & feelings? The illusion had vanished & you would have looked upon the scene in another light! The tempter then had revealed himself in another formâa demon driving you into melancholy & despair. Or, perhaps, it might have lasted longer; and once committed to a practice by a covenant sealed in blood, which at first conscience did not justify, you would have been interested in justifying it, & being surrounded with professed duelists into whose company & councils you would have been thrown (vide 1 Psalm i.v.) this you would have found it to be no very difficult matter. And then your return to God and virtue had been hopeless. Or next to hopeless. But if the illusion had been broken--& this is what most likely would have happenedâby your opposer's ball piercing your own breastâthenâthenâI cannot pursue the thought. But this I say would have in all probability been the result your illusion to the contrary notwithstanding. For these soidisant men of honor take every advantage, & the history of the practice shews that in by far the greatest numbers of cases the most innocent of the parties has been the victim. So it was in the case of Hamilton & Burn and in that of Decatur and Barron & in that Lucas (poor fellow! He was my classmate) and Benton, Lilly & Gravesâand every other I can think of. And as to casual rencontres it is almost always the case that the more desperate villain kills; for he is prepared, knows his purpose and selects his time of attack; whereas he who is most under the government of conscience is apt to be hesitating. Such was the case with Bliss. His antagonist whom he had never injured, was determined to take his life & he did so and without a miracle he could not have failed (acting on his plan deliberately formed) to do so.\n\nI have suffered these thoughts. You will I trust lay them seriously to heart. The men of the world whether in or out of the Church are bad advisers. That course of life which their policy dictates is utterly & in principle different from that of a Christian. I have sometimes said that were I not a Christian I would be in favor of dueling. This perhaps was too strongly expressed. But if this life is the whole of man's existence & this it is, on any other scheme but that of Christianity there are states of society wherein dueling is perhaps a less evil than those it prevents. Yet even on this supposition your duel would have been wrong. For what would have been gained by it? The coxcombs of the army & navy would have been taught by it to be more polite to gentlemen of the bar or gentlemen of the bar would have learned a caution not to speak to coxcombs of the navy or army till they knew they could obtain respectful attention from said coxcombs. A worthy end, & great good truly!\n\nBut consider the matter on the true ground of your profession as a Christian. Read Christ sermon on the mount and mark & inwardly digest its [one word] especially what you will find at the close as to the different fates of the hearer and doer of his \"sayings\"; & then ask yourself seriously whether you have not good reason to fear the former & not the latter belongs to you. The occasion demands it; & your destiny may, & I think does, depend on it. God & man will expect of you some decisive step on the occasion either to repent of the course you have taken or justify it. Whichever you do the public will know & you will see the necessity of learning the use of the pistol, Bowie knife, rifle, and all other sorts of weapons and also and especially to rid yourself of all those scruples of conscience & religious fears of offending God & incur the tremendous doom of the impenitent transgressor which must embarrass one greatly in the use of these weapons. Seriously, I say, on such an alternative that would be your course. And yet with your education you might find it more difficult than you imagine to turn yourself into a Banton or Jackson or even a Butler or Murray. This is the way of the transgressor; & you see it is hard; to say nothing now of the end. Let me exhort you thenâand I may not have another opportunity, nothing is more uncertain than lifeâand, perhaps it is my infirmity, but my mind at this moment is oppressed with dismal fears & forebodingsâlet me exhort you to be decided in your character. I fear you have allowed the spirit of the world the gaieties of fashionable life and the phantoms of ambition & I know not what, to beguile you into the vain imaginationsâtoo common alas, among professors of religion, that a life of faith and piety an honest following of Christ in the way of his self denying precepts is not necessary. Sometimes I reproach myself for not more assiduously inculcating these thoughts in your early education & sometimes for exposing you to the temptations which beset your path. The leading motive which led me into this exile was to find a place more secluded from the temptations of the world where I might bring up my family in the fear of Godâaway from the vanities of fashionable life--& in the pious hope of happiness hereafter. Ah! How sadly have I been disappointed! Two are not! Doubts hung over their end! Of the rest there is none to comfort me by what I most desire to see in my children, proofs of piety & devotion to God. My God! Wherein have I erred & been delinquent, that they blessing has been withheld from those who are most dear to me. \"My tears have unto me been meat. Both in the night & day,\" & now they flow while I write. But why need I write these things. I am loath to do it. But the thought that I may be penning my last words to you compels meâYou are not yet \"out of the unpleasant piece of business.\" No: no. Much must yet be done to repair the past. And these fellows will have their revenge. I know what such characters are capable of & unless God in his providence & mercy should divert them by finding them other employment, they will dog your path as long as they live. What you should doâfurther than the general principles above suggested may dictateâI know not. I can only pray that that great & gracious God whom you have offended may yet give you grace to turn to him & have you in his holy keeping.\n\nI read your letter to the family. Sighs followed & the younger ones were happy in not knowing what it meant further than that there was a letter from their brother.\n\nYour afft. father\n\nA. Wylie The Institution prospers. But the events of life have taken away in a great measure my relish for every earthly thing. All is vanity. P.S. There is a maxim, respire finem, which is good: I would connect with it another of my own making, to apply when an ill piece of business is over, respire principium; and after revolving in my mind to guess how it was possible for you so far to forget yourself as to make such a beginning as to notice Butler in any way after he received your question in silence I can form no more reasonable conjecture than that you were under some species of excitement from some cause which affected you as intoxication does the drunkard, depriving you of reason for a time.\n\nI've no time to look over my letter to correct it.\n\nAndrew Wylie, Jr. to Caroline Bryan Wylie , 21 August 1844\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition: WHM Purchase, 2013\n\nTranscript: Pittsburg August 21, 1844\n\nDear Carry,\n\nWhen I wrote to you last I found that you had been disappointed of your visit to the North. I am glad, now, to know that it was but a postponement, for a few days. It would have afforded me great pleasure to be one of your party. I would have made new acquaintances, especially I would have been pleased to see Mr. Lathrop and your cousin. , some novel sights, and scenes, met with strange incidents; and last though not least have been your own fellow t4raveller.\n\nThere might have been some [dayen?] that this last enjoyment had displaced all the rest for I am fully aware that you are wont to write with no divided xxxx, and that I have no disposition to dispute the exercise of your prerogative. I have not forgotten my experience at the backgammon board. How disgracefully you beat me! It was not altogether, however, attributable either to your extraordinary skill, or my ignorance of the game. There was another cause for it, which would come into operation again whenever we played or travelled in company. Sure I am that if we journeyed the world over together, to me it would be but one delightful monotony, but one object to me, to hear, to love, and to admire. O dearest Carry, that I had but the \"wings of the morning,\" that I might revisit you with each returning sun, and replenish from your presence that cup of abounding, intoxicating joy, which you alone can give me. I can see but one cloud on my future, and will you not dispel it with the smiles of your glorious face? Will you not spread across its bosom that bow which shall be to me the symbol of promise and of hope?\n\nYesterday I supped at the Thornburger's in the country. There was no company except myself. They are now, both will with the exception of a little lameness in one of Mr. T's feet, arising from a sprain. They made a thousand inquiries for you, and in the most friendly spirit. Mrs. T. said how pleased she should be if you should ever become her neighbor. I replied she could not be more so than I should and asked her if she thought we could hope for it? I declared that I knew of no foundation for such an expectation, and that unless she knew more on the subject than I did, her wish was not likely to be gratified. But she seemed altogether incredulous. God of beneficence suffer not this good woman's hopes to meet with disappointment!\n\nMr. & Mrs. Biddle have returned looking quite well for them. The match is generally thought to have been a losing concern on both sides. He is 25 or 30 years her senior, with an impaired constitution, strange habits, and an arrogant and wayward temper. She for anything I know to the contrary, may be very amicable and accomplished, but Biddle is a man of discernment and very fastidious tastes in some respects, and for that reason, as well as for his ill temper, I should think he could not long remain blind to her faults, if she have any, or fail to imagine them if she has not. As to his faults, they are too glaring and intolerable to be [cincialed] or borne with by any woman. I ought not perhaps to express myself so freely on these matters, as I cannot be supposed to know what may be the benign influence exercised by matrimony over the hearts and characters of its subjects.\n\nWm. Dallas & wife have not yet returned from a visit to his parents in Huntingdon County. From all I can learn he behaved very rowly in the whole business. He courted her in the first place in a cowardly style, then had not the courage to ask her father's consent, or let him know of the engagement. But taking for granted that he would be refused and without the slightest cause for it, prevailed upon her to go with him on Saturday afternoon to the house of a poor parson in Allegheny where they were stealthily married. After that, too, the marriage was kept secret, at his request, for two weeks, when at last it had to be first broached by her.\n\nWhat do you ladies think of such a man? In ancient Greece the distaff would have been put into his hands, and he would have been forced to pass the remainder of his days spinning wool with old maids and women.\n\nYou seem not to have been aware that the magazine which I sent to Sally contained a frontispiece very like herself. The resemblance may be a fancy of mine, but until I am convinced to the contrary by another view of Miss Sally herself, I shall believe it to be good and striking.\n\nThe only objection I would have to the taking of your own portrait by that young artist in Alexandria is that he can not do you justice. Let him try though. Artists improve by the study of the beautiful.\n\nYou have now two letters of mine to answer. \"Wherever you roam, wherever you rest, write to me at your earliest leisure.\n\nWhat time do you expect to return to Alexandria? And when do you expect to leave it again for Buffalo, with Mrs. Lathrop? They say here that really Miss Danny is going to marry Mr. Hon. I don't think so, for I believe she is too much attracted to the Scotchman of whom you have heard me speak. I find that I wrote so hastily and make so many mistakes that I am compelled to occupy some of my space in each to correct the errors of its predecessor. In my last I employed an illustration which might look like disparagement to Miss Martin, Miss Irwin, and Mr. Robinson. I am sure it was not so intended. Those ladies certainly bear no resemblance to haystacks. Nor is Mr. Robinson by any means of kin to the unfortunate creature that is said to have perished so miserably of starvation in the sight of plenty.\n\nMost affectionately & devotedly yours etc. Andrew Wylie\n\nA.G.W. to Caroline Bryan Wylie , 16 December 1844\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition: WHM Purchase, 2013\n\nTranscript: New Orleans, December 16th 1844\n\nDear Cousin Carry\n\nI think about six weeks has elapsed since I last had the pleasure of writing you, which was en route and it really appears to me as though enough had since happened to have made it six months. The truth is after my return from the North where having enjoyed so much leisure and such interesting company that I felt little disposed after my return home to enter upon the duties of my calling, something seemed to be lacking and when I arrived here it appeared to me that I was not at home. This unusual feeling and deviation from habit naturally suggested the inquiry of what could be the cause of these strange emotions. The question is answered when I tell you that it was the absence of your interesting society. As strange as you may think of it Cousin Carry, I do like you very much. Although I know it is of no use. Yet somehow or other I cannot help it.\n\nMr. Wilson arrived about a week since. And I am very happy to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the 31st Oct together with the accompanying memento which I prize above price. And should I live an hundred years it shall be kept sacred and untarnished solely for the recollection of you.\n\nI reached home on the 6th of Nov. My friends all congratulated me upon my improved appearance and say that my trip has been of more service to me than anyone of the numerous friends who have made a tour during the past summer. I have fattened so much as to astonish myself and from 135 I now weigh 158, and find it quite inconvenient in regard to clothes, for I have had to replenish my wardrobe with a full stock of extra sizes. And into the bargain I feel much more consequential for I always looked upon a small shriveled up man with a perfect abhorrence. I am indebted to you Cousin Carry for all this. You ask me howâ¦Why in the first place you always exercised an influence upon me which nobody else did and your will was always my pleasure. So if you recollect the morning or rather evening we left Albany for Buffalo, you caught me with a quid of tobacco in my mouth and at your request I threw it out. Since which time tobacco has not been in my mouth except occasionally and that very seldom in the shape of a cigar. I was in the habit of using it to such an excess as to keep me very much reduced and to be of serious injury to my nervous system. I feel assured now that I have abandoned the disgusting habit foreverâ¦When in Louisville, I met with some of our Albany acquaintances. If you recollect the evening we spent at Mrs. Peckam's, we were introduced to some Southerners, a Mr. Lacy, Mrs. Lacy, and Miss L. They were on their way home and I assure you that I was very glad to see them, more on account of the pleasant recollections left upon my memory of Mrs. P's party than anything else. I would gladly have made one of their party going down the river, and scolded my fate that I could not do it on account of previous engagements. Though as matters have since resulted, I do not regret it, for I had made engagements to take charge of some ladies whom I did not at the time know who were on their way to Mobile via N. Orleans. A Mrs. Cattonett and her two daughters made the party. They had been spending the summer at the springs in Ky. with their father who had some few weeks previously left for homeâ¦.We were nine days on our passage to New Orleans upon a magnificent new steamer and you may rest assured that we had fun enough during the time. I found them not only agreeable traveling companions but interesting and accomplished ladies. One of them particularly, Miss Antoinette, I fell in love with. She was the life of the whole boat. Notwithstanding our passengers were made up of some of the most fashionable society of the South and among whom were several very interesting and accomplished young ladies, with all of whom I became acquainted. We had on board every evening dancing as well as vocal and instrumental music. My only regret was that you were not present to participate. I know you would have enjoyed it so much. I of course felt my consequence being the escort of the greatest belle on board. I am sure that all the other young men on board envied my portion. At least I was vain enough to think so. I have just begged a beautiful bouquet and as a friend of mine goes to Mobile tomorrow, I shall send it to Miss Antoinette. I wish I had time to carry it myself. Cousin Carry I want to see you very much, but when I shall have that pleasure again I cannot tell, without I should make a trip to the North the ensuring spring and if I do this I shall have to cheat Mr. Cox and tell him I am going to Ky. only on some business and return in time for him to go up sometime in August. I do not intend again to pass another summer wholly in N.O. so you need not be surprised to see me. I have been very much engaged in my business since my return, and I know that it will be gratifying to you to learn that we are succeeding beyond our most sanguine expectations. Our business has increased very much the present season, tho commissions do not count in the same ratio as last year owing to the extremely low prices for all descriptions of produce, especially our great Southern staple, Cotton. Mr. Coningham the old gentleman who accompanied us to the cemetery near Phila makes frequent enquiries after you. So does Mr. Joseph. Mr. Hennen returned home a few weeks since. He lives in Lafayette about 3 miles above N.O. I have not as yet seen him. The two former gentlemen beg to be remembered to you. When shall I hear from you. I hope soon. Be pleased to make my kindest regards to Cousin Mariana, your Mother and the family and believe me to be your very sincere and devoted friend\n\nA.G.W. We have been favored since my return with the most elegant weather you ever felt, corresponding with the Indian Summer in Va.\n\nAndrew Wylie, Jr. to Caroline Bryan Wylie , 5 January 1845\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition: WHM Purchase, 2013\n\nTranscript: Pittsburg, January 5th 1845\n\nDearest Carry,\n\nI have today been looking over all your pleasant letters to me, as I often do, and always with fond delight. It is then I can see your face and your heart as in a glass and discover, if not the beginning, yet the growth and progress of an attachment which I have sought with so much earnestness, prize beyond all things else, and which is sweeter to my soul \"than honey, yea than the honey comb.\" The perusal of them reminded me, also, of some of my sins of omission; one of which was my neglect to thank you for the beautiful extract you sent me from one of your sister's letters to Mr. Lathrop, in reference to the unfortunate result of the late election, and the character of Mr. Clay. I speak of this now, not that I suppose Mrs. L. herself would deem it a matter of any consequence one way or the other, but to remove my own good name from the imputation of an oversight. Mrs. Lathrop's reputation as a writer, I have often heard of; and when at Alexandria last, I discovered that, at home, it was known even amongst the children. You remember that Sally told us of their making inquiries of her whether or not it was true that young Master Lathrop could read and write when he was not more than a month old. Now what could have put that notion into their noddles, but the impression that he possessed an hereditary title to those accomplishments? Nor is their conjecture without ancient and reputable authority. Dogberry, you know, would have it so: \"A well favored man was the gift of fortune; but to read and write comes by nature.\"\n\nIn your father's last letter to me he stated that he thought Mr. Hardin had told him that Mr. Triplett held an adverse interest in some of the lands which lie in Davies County. I neglected in my last to put him right on that subject. Mr. Triplett assured me he had not.\n\nI see by the papers that Mr. Southfute is dead. Mr. Hardin did not wish me to have anything to do with him. I discovered he was very hostile to Southfute. It was for this reason that I merely employed Mr. S to make some inquiries in reference to the location, quality, value, etc. of 4 or 5 tracts of land which lay in his part of the state, and of which Mr. Hardin knew nothing, and had never heard before.\n\nAs to the lands there I have not heard a word from any of the gentlemen whom I employed, and who promised to write me immediately after their arrival home. I am confirmed in the opinion that your mother's interests there require the supervision of a master's eye. I will go provided you will share the enterprize with me. I believe it would turn out greatly to our interests, all round. It is a fine estate even yet, and nothing but negligence can lose it. That certainly wouldâPart, and the best part, has been lost already in that way. But this whole matter we can all discuss better when I visit you next. That will be early next month. I would go tonight, on wings, if I could. I am impatient for the day of my deliverance. \"Turn swiftly round ye wheels of time and bring the promised hour.\"\n\nI received, this morning a long and very affectionate letter from my father; and a few days ago another from my sister Elizabeth. I give you following a short extract from father's: \"But since the affair is to be serious I am right glad, and confidant too, in the hope that she is worthy all the esteem and affection you can bestow upon her. I shall rejoice to receive her as my \"belle fille\"âto use an expression full of meaning.âHad your letter reached me before leaving Phila still I could not have complied with the invitation it contained from Mr. Bryan, being anxious to reach home at the opening of the session. However, I desire through you, to tender my thanks for the invitation, with this apology, for not accepting it.\"\n\nSister says that Catherine, who is now not quite fifteen, in engaged to a Mr. Gwathmey of Louisville, a young gentleman of the most reputable connextion, and himself very handsome, talented, and well educated. They are only waiting till she is old enough. Brother John, who I told you would go to Phila, as I thought, to attend the Medical lectures, this winter did not go; but is passing this winter as he did the last, at Louisville where they have an excellent faculty.\n\nI have a small package for Miss Irvin which was sent to my care by Mrs. Moor of Wheeling. If I should find an earlier opportunity I shall send it, if not, take it when I go myself.\n\nThe more you can tell me of your \"dear self,\" dear Carry, the better I shall like your lettersâif better be possible. I can find no fault in them, now, though I read them always with the closest attention, and more than once. They may have their blemishes like all other compositions, but I am not critic enough to discover them.\n\nHave I neglected to tell you that Mr. McKnight, whom you saw at Bedford, is to be married to a niece of Miss Drusby, of the same name? You remember he desired it at Bedford. The story may not have been true then, but it certainly is so now. They carry their mutual devotion to a ridiculous degree of exclusivenessâattend no parties, as that might interrupt for a few minutes the pleasure of their own sweet intercourse. I do not think that you and I were ever quite so lost as that. We could, at least, have gone to a party together.\n\nJames Robinson is now nicely prepared for admission. He studies well, and is examined two or three times a week. I have let him know and asked his services as bridesman, as they call it in England.\n\nFor heaven's sake don't put my patience again to as great a trial as you did before I received your last. Sunday I went to the office my heart fluttering with expectationâand no letter from Alexandria. Monday the sameâTuesday the sameâWednesday the same. By this time I was just about down to the lowest notch. But Thursday brought me comfort. Since then I have delayed to answer yours, three days, which is the utmost allowance I will make for your next. So if you are a Christian woman, with a heart accessible to pity, you will not again inflict so much misery & [?] on a fellow creature. As there is no more space outside, I shall turn back and make my signature on the other folio, least you might not know from whom these lines were sent\n\nMy love to the family and for yourself my warmest and [?] affection\n\nAndrew Wylie, Esq.\n\nAndrew Wylie, Jr. to Caroline Bryan Wylie , 30 October 1845\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition: WHM Purchase, 2013\n\nTranscript: Pittsburg, Oct 30, 1845\n\nMy beloved Carry,\n\nI did not receive your letter of the 24th till the morning of Tuesday by which time my solicitude had grown to a fever. Sunday afternoon I had gone to make a visit at Mrs. Mowry's. After tea I insisted on coming to town and she insisted on my staying the night. I made many excuses to get away, all of which she seemed ready to answer. But the true reason (which I did not tell her) was that I was determined to be at the post office at its earliest opening in the morning to welcome the expected messenger of affection from my dearest, my darling, my charming Carry. On this hope, waking & sleeping my soul rested, and in the morning before the sun had fairly risen my footsteps were in the city, hastening with delighted expectation to receive the little carrier of your love. And then oh how sudden and sad a disappointment. What could have been the reason? Reached home ThursdayâFriday one, Saturday two, Sunday three, and now Monday. Three days, full days and a half since she arrived at home and no letter. 'O how hard is my fate.\" I am nothing better than another Selkirk, left high and dry on a miserable, inhospitable island. But cheer up my soul, a better day is dawning. Tomorrow shall not be as this dayâNor was it. How happy you made me then! Your words were so kind and affectionateâ[trand?] by a pen which knows the loving eye which follows it. Till this state of trial is ended you must write me oftenâevery dayâa lineâsyllableâyour initials on a paperâas a dust of morphias to comfort my distressful loneliness. It is nearly two months now till the holydays. I do not know that I can live that long without seeing you, though I shall try to hold out. My situation at old Mrs. Doathills is exceedingly comfortable, if so forlorn a being as I could be said to be in that state at all. I was fearful at first that she would not admit me, but as I was one of her old boarders she crowded the others a little and so made room for me. My business is coming back to me slowly, and I am now making expenses. It was injured by the report, which I believe was in the mouth of everyone, that it was our intention to settle in Kentucky, when we went away. I am determinedly resolved to leave no pains, or effort unemployed to make for myself, and you my dearest Carry, a respectable name, and comfortable support, at my profession. My health and vigor are better now than I remember them ever to have been before, head pretty clear, and spirits cheerful. Last Monday evening Mary Denny and Mr. Spring were married. They left for New Orleans the next day. The parting scene is said to have been unusually affectingâMrs. Spring \"took on\" in a fit of hystericks. And the boat after delaying for hours was about to put off without them, when they a length came in sight. The invitations to the wedding were confined, amongst the married people, to the family connexions. Young persons not in the connexion were invited. Of course I was not embraced by the rule, and was not invited. Mr. Ritchie, being one of the young persons, fell within the rule and was bidden. He says the evening was very agreeably passed and that is about the whole of the description which I have been able to procure from him or anyone else. James Robinson was absent at Cincinnati. His father says to avoid being a witness of the distressing occurrence. He says that either himself or Ross could have induced him to break his engagement with Spring at any time up to within a month past. Mr. Crogham has gone to England, and as Dr. Denny informed me, is delighted with the youthful husband of his daughter. If he (Crogham) had had the world to choose from, Schenley would have been the person of his choice. They have taken a house in London, and Crogham is to live with them.\n\nThe day after you left this Mrs. and Miss Addison not knowing that you had gone called at the Exchange to see you. Mrs. Mowry made a thousand of the kindest inquiries for you & said if she had known of our arrival she would have come in with her carriage and taken you out. I have supped at Mrs. Robinson's one evening since you left. She and the Col. Appeared both to pity my situation saying that whenever I was low-spirited, or in distress to see you, I should drop in as if in my own home.\n\nMr. Chaddock was mistaken when he informed you that it was Tom Crossam who died of mania potic. It was his brother William. I had not myself heard of it when you left this. He died in Philadelphia, in a drunken frolic, and as he was never of any use in the world, nor ever likely to be, the world as well as his family could well afford to spare him. Poor fellow! The greater the pity on his own account. He was his own worst enemy.\n\nYou may say to your father that since I last wrote to him in reference to the Ky business, I have ascertained that all hope of recovering any part of the 3000 acre tract which lies near the mouth of Panther Creek on Green River, is utterly out of the question. Thomas Barbour convened his interest in that tract in 1807 to one John L. Moor. Thus we are doomed to see, one after another, our hopes & wishes fail. I still, however, trust that something can be made. How much I cannot tell. It will be necessary to procure & have forwarded to our lawyers in Ky two or three certified copies of Richard Barbour's Will which is recorded in Orange Co. Va. I have not yet received a word of information from either James Barbour, Ben Hardin, or Jn L. Helm in reply to my letters written to them in Ky. This scratch I have written after night and of course have not followed the blue lines, & with a steel pen, which does not suit my hand. I must also trust to you for the postage, as I am not willing to delay the letter for another day on that account.\n\nPlease present my thanks to Thomas for his affectionate & thoughtful remembrance of me written on the inside of the envelope of your letter. My best & respectful regards to Mr. Withers, and warmest love to every member of the family. Your own devoted \"Andy\"\n\nAndrew Wylie, Jr. to Caroline Bryan Wylie , 07 November 1845\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition: WHM Purchase, 2013\n\nTranscript: Pittsburg, Nov 7, 1845\n\nMy beloved Carry,\n\nI had seated myself last night in my room, with every arrangement complete for writing & holding sweet intercourse in spirit with one who is to me the \"chiefest among ten thousand, and altogether lovely.\" My letter had not reached more than about its tenth line when my cherished purpose was disturbed by an irruption of friends who were in a merry mood, and vowed that they would not permit to me the enjoyment of a pleasure which was denied to them. Though compelled to make them welcome, I yet anathematized them in my heart, adopting the language of one of the Pope's Bulls & d----d them from the topmost hair which grew upon the crown of their heads, even to the nails upon their toes. The consequences of this interruption are manifold and grievous. In the first place, my plans were disconcertedâI was rudely torn from your society & forced for the evening into that of persons with whom my spirit was not, at the time, in unison. Those pleasant hours of the night so favorable to the pleasures of memory & imagination, and which I had fondly connected to thoughts of you had to be occupied with coarser joys, and the sweet task of worshipping the idol of my affections to be deferred to the less favorable and appropriate season of \"tomorrow's sun.\" Again, this note which I was anxious you should receive by Sunday, owing to the interruption, cannot, now, reach you till Monday.\n\nO my dearâdearest Carryâhow slow and dull is the flight of time! Heavens how long it isâevery dayâand seven long days in every weekâfrom morning till evening, and then from evening till morning. Six more weeks before I can behold again \"thy most kiss-worthy face\" and press thee to my heart! But this state of probation & suffering must at length reach its end when I shall see thee face to face, \"and know even as I am known.\" This year Christmas falls on Thursday. I shall endeavor to leave this on the Sunday previous which will enable me to reach Alexandria Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. My business prospects are reasonably good. I have made an arrangement with Mr. Bigham, a member of the Legislature, for the use of his Law library, which is quite extensive & well selected, as well as of his office. Could have formed a partnership with him, but did not desire it. He is altogether immersed in politics, and for that reason is not likely to have as much business to divide as I would have myself, and besides being a Whig, is on the wrong side of the fence for our interests. In addition to this I have agreed with the District Attorney of the United States to assist him in all the business of his court, in consideration of his dividing with me \"share and share alike\" all the fees and \"contingencies\" of his office. The office is not very valuable, but will be worth to me, in this way several hundred dollars per annum. Mr. Dawson of Fayette Co. is the District Atty. and owing to his absence from Pittsburg pretty much the whole business of the office will have to be transacted by me.\n\nOld Mrs. Douthitt with whom I board has taken a large and fine house on 4th Street into which she intends moving about the first of December. She keeps the very nicest and best boarding house I have ever lived at, and unless you should prefer housekeeping yourself, I will have our quarters selected in the best part of the new establishment. But this we can discuss at Alexandria.\n\nA few evenings since I called on Miss Conar & Mrs. Mason, and then met Mr. Swartzarlder. It is reported that he is paying his addresses to Miss C, and is well received. He sometimes talks to me of making a visit to Alexandria to see Sally. He professes to admire you so much that he thinks he would inevitably fall in love with your sister. It is no doubt all talk, but if it were otherwise, I would judge that his chance with Sally would not be more than one in a thousand. Does Sally adhere to her anti-matrimonial pledge? That was a rash vow, & one which, if persisted in, must make her whole life a warfare. She will discover (probably she has made the discovery) that those who love her most, will be the persons who most of all will urge her with kindest promises, arguments and solicitations, to recant the hasty pledge. Better to yield gracefully, Sally, whilst you are young and joyful, than to fight against all those temptations for years and then have to yield at last. Besides, it can hardly be considered fair, that any one should be allowed to go through the world devastating the hearts of all beholders, herself exempt from arrest. You may consider yourself safe, but you will find that at some hour when you least expect it, there will be the cry of \"behold the bridegroom cometh.\"\n\nI was much surprised to hear from you that Ben Rush is going to marry Miss Matilda Mason. I have seen Mr. R. It is said to have been a [one word] to Miss Simpson, by whom he was rejected. Certain it is that he made two visits to her from Phila. She would probably have married him but the rest of the family opposed it alleging & making her believe that he was a fortune hunter & could not love her. Mr. Knapp has just returned from New York, by the way of Buffalo & tells me he saw Mr. Lathrop & Mariana in the latter place. Mr. L, he says told him everything connected with his business affairs & prospects both at B & Cumberland, and asked his advice. Knapp advised him by all means, to go to C. Mrs. Knapp is on a visit to her friends in New York.\n\nAll your friends here that I have seen have mentioned your name in the most flattering & affectionate manner & begged to be remembered to you. My own love and more to all the family,\n\nYour own loving Andy The letter of your father to me of which you make inquiry happened to be put in the wrong box at the PO & was not received by me till several days after its arrival. As it was from your father, I took the liberty of opening and reading it. It contained no secrets.\n\nTwo copies of Richard Barbour's will are all that need be procured. One to be sent to F. G. Hord of Maysville and the other to James Stuart of Brandenburg, KY.\n\nAndrew Wylie, Jr. to Caroline Bryan Wylie , 04 December 1845\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition: WHM Purchase, 2013\n\nTranscript: Pittsburg, Dec 4th 1845\n\nMy beloved Carry,\n\nWe are, at length, moved to & settled in our new quarters. Everything about us is very comfortable, clean and neat. I am in a fine large room, handsomely furnished, newly painted and papered, on the second floor. I furnished it myself in a very complete manner. In addition to all that is usually to be found in a chamber I have provided myself with a very nice shower bath, which I use with cold water every morning. The first thing after rising is to shave, which I do now entirely with cold water, and find it altogether better than hot waterânot so injurious to the skin, and now, since the habit is formed, much more pleasant. Then I step into the bath and receive the shock of the descending torrent, the effect of which is a delightful reaction, and fine health, vigor and spirits for the day. This bath is one of Bates' patent, occupies but a space of 2 Â½ feet square, is very light and portable, and as good a shower bath as need be. No chamber ought to be without it, or some other in its place. I should now be well contented if I could but fill & feast my eyes with your presence, as my heart is filled with your love.\n\n\"O if I had you by my side\n\nHow happy I should be\" Bless your dear heart, how much useless anxiety and pain you allowed yourself to feel on account of my eyes. The one which was operated upon is now entirely well, with the exception of a little suffused blood that disfigures it a little, but which will all be absorbed by the circulation in a few days. The other was in no kind of danger. I thank and love you, however, none the less for the expressions of affection and tenderness which you sent me on the occasion and do not hesitate to avow that if I could not win or retain your love on other conditions, I should any moment be ready to sacrifice a \"right arm or a right eye.\" In my last letter, I remember, that I omitted to say a word on this subject. I had forgotten it entirely as I did the drawers and shirts, being intent on other matters. Our town has been almost filled with cases of smallpox for six or eight weeks past. It is now nearly well of them and the disease has quite disappeared. I did not speak of it before, least you might become alarmed about me, and I knew that I was safe, having been effectually vaccinated when I was young. I have lately been reading some of the interesting letters of Mary Wortley Montagu, written principally from Constantinople. It was she who discovered the practice of inoculation for the smallpox amongst the Turks and introduced it into England, making the first experiment upon her own son. The practice was assailed and denounced by the whole medical faculty of the country, which would seem strange if we did not know that all important discoveries for the benefit of mankind almost without an exception, have been met with the same spirit. This is the spirit of conservatism to which I feel myself, every day, growing more and more opposed.\n\nMajor & Mrs. Herrow whom we saw at Louisville last summer have been here, the last fortnightâMrs. H very sick. The Major inquired particularly for you, & wished to be remembered. Mrs. H I did not see. They start for New Orleans as soon as Mrs. H shall be well enough. Do you remember the old Jew, Mr. Andregg, from Phila whom we used to meet in our morning walks on the mountain at Bedford? He makes inquiry for us of every Pittsburger that visits Phila with whom he is acquainted, and after sends his compliments. He is a pleasant, kind, old bachelor, and I should be glad to have his company again for an hour. I met Major Beckham, of the Penitentiary, t'other day who said many clever things of you and told me how much they all admired you. Mrs. B has been to Virginia this autumn, and was in Alexa a few days. The Major says she would have given anything to have known of your being there. She would certainly have made you a visit. I wish she had. How your Ma would have enjoyed it. Mrs. B is a woman such as is not produced in every ageâas rare as the Phoenix and like the Phoenix, when she is gone, she is likely to be succeeded by a daughter as wonderful as herself.\n\nDay before yesterday I went down to the boat which was about to leave for Brownsville for the purpose of seeing an acquaintance on business, and was surprised to meet the whole family of the Jessups. They had only arrived from below about two hours before and were hastening home. They met me in the most cordial manner and made many kind inquiries for you. They had been some days at Maysville, and whilst there the General had been kicked in the head by a horse, which he had been driving with a carriage and was yet suffering from the effects, though there was evidently no danger. I thought instantly of the celebrated drive which you had with Mrs. Leo, the night of the storm, but did not tell it on you.\n\nWe have snow nearly a foot in depth, and the finest possible sleighing. That, however, is nothing to me, as it is a pleasure which always seemed to be too much qualified with disagreeable accompaniments. Renew the assurances of my love to the family. You cannot imagine with what extasy I am filled in the hope of meeting you so soon\n\nYour own affectionate Andy Parker has been ordered to join the frigate Cumberland by the 15th inst. The frigate is to sail for the Mediterranean. He and his family quit their old boarding house in Allegheny some time ago & have been on this side of the river since.\n\nAndrew Wylie, Jr. to Caroline Bryan Wylie , 12 December 1845\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition: WHM Purchase, 2013\n\nTranscript: Pittsburg, Dec. 12th 1845\n\nMy beloved Carry,\n\nYour letters have become as necessary to me as food or raiment, and the perusal of one of them affords me a richer repast than was ever offered to the appetite of an Epicure. They carry to my soul your messages of love, on which it dwells and feasts as the food of its life, and the only fountain of its joys. Your last was so long delayed and was so welcome when it came that it at once converted my mourning into joy. Mr. Mahow had told me at the Court House that he had seen Mr. Lathrop in one of the offices in Washington on last Friday or Saturday and was introduced to him; and that Mr. L had told him that you and he had come up to W that day together. This assured me that you were still in the land of the living, and usual perfect health.\n\nThere is one item of news which I think I have neglected to tell you, or if I have told it, have forgotten. The steamboat on which Mr. & Mrs. Spring were descending the Mississippi, was run into, one forenoon, by another steamboat and sunk. No lives were lost, but Mrs. S lost her harp, and had all her wedding finery, silk drapes, etc. etc. etc. so drenched in the muddy flood of that river as to be entirely useless as drapes. Her box of jewelry was stolen also by some of the deck hands, but afterwards recovered. Her father, on hearing of the disaster, wrote to Mr. Crogham to bring her another harp, as he returns from England in January.\n\nThe story I told you about Miss Cowan and Mr. Swartzwelder is not true, as I now think, for he has told me himself of his being engaged to a Miss Yost of Hagerstown, and that they are likely to be married sometime in the course of the winter. This Miss Y is the daughter of the gentleman who committed suicide a short time since, by shooting himself through the head with a pistol, and is said to be a very nice girl. The father of Miss Y. had become very deeply involved in debt, and Swartzwelder feeling a partiality of the daughter, lent him $5000, money of his father's estate all of which is entirely lost and the loss will fall upon S. However, if he has succeeded by this sacrifice in securing the affections the lady, and gets her to marry him, I would say the money was well lost for him. Now this story itself may turn out to have been only a blind, to conceal the real designs of the parties to the first. How it is I cannot tell, as I am no longer consulted by the young men on these subjects, in a confidential manner.\n\nI shall be exceedingly happy to accompany you and the rest of the party to the President's on the first of the New Year. The President is pleasing me well. I am more than pleased with his late message, and cannot doubt that its author is a man of prudence, courage, intelligence, and patriotism.\n\nOur Bar, here, are kept in a state of excited curiosity in reference to the appointment which is shortly to be made to fill the place of the late Judge Baldwin on the Supreme Bench of U.S. Grier wants it very much and may get itâat least I hope so. He is able, and learned, but as rude in manners as a Scandinavian. If they could put up with him in the Supreme Court, I for one should be very happy to see him removed from us; for his dictatorship over juries has become almost unbearable.\n\nOur rivers are, I believe, all frozen over and everyone is busily engaged filling his ice house. The ice is very beautiful and thick, and will be laid up in the greatest abundance. We had a day or two of thawing weather a short time ago, which altogether spoiled the sleighing, though it is now cold enough. This season the weather wizards have all been put to confusion. Everyone had predicted an open and mild winter throughoutâthe signs, they averred, were all that way. But, behold, already we have had two weeks of severe winter, and the promise of still more in the future. I hope it may continue close, as I dislike most of all to travel in cold wet weather. I shall not say anything more to you, my dear, dear Carry, about returning until I see you. But I assure you, the prospect of having to come back alone is calculated to cloud the pleasure anticipated from my visit. It is, indeed, out of my power to live away from you. I may say, like Cain, \"my punishment is greater than I can bear\"âbanishment so long from the Paradise of my love. I received, this morning, a letter from Mr. Pope in reference to business; but he thinks I cannot love you else it would be impossible to endure so long an absence. This was, no doubt, badinage on his part, but you can see from it what might be said. Of course you are at liberty to do as you shall think most for your own happiness; and I should not have renewed the subject until I [washed?] at Alexandria, only that I know how powerless I am, in your presence, to maintain any position against you. To your sweet eyes and voice I must yield everything.\n\nShould I leave this on Saturday, as I anticipate, I shall reach Alexandria on Tuesday, but you need not be disappointed if I should be detained a day longer. You ought to receive this on Monday next. If you write even as late as Wednesday, I can receive your letter on Saturday before starting. How happy I am that this is the last I am to write till I shall clasp you to my heart.\n\nMr. Pope sent his love to you, bad as he thought you. Renew to the family the assurance of my affection. Your own loving Andy\n\nAndrew Wylie, Jr. to Caroline Bryan Wylie , 17 January 1846\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition: Gift of PWL, 2010\n\nTranscript: Pittsburg January 17, 1846\n\nI had intended to postpone writing to you till tomorrow, when I should have the sweet leisure of a quiet Sunday in which to indulge my feelings and imagination. But, this evening, I thought that your refreshing and loving letter had been already too long without an answer. How hard it is that we should be so long separated. Still, am I infinitely happier even thus, than I should have been without you. It grieves me to be absent from you, yet with what delight do I dwell upon your image and cherish your love. I yesterday wrote to Mr. Pope in a different strain, but it was not serious. I told him my condition was peculiarly pitiableâthat I was a widower without the hopes of oneâI was deprived of you and yet not permitted to look out for another. I think I told you that he had written to me making inquiry about a new invention for making brick by steam, the patent right of which was owned by Mr. Merrit, a gentleman who you know. Since my return I have witnessed the machine at work and think it is destined to prove eminently [merciful?]. During the short time in which I was present it turned out 30 well made and beautiful bricks every minute. This is the only machine of the kind which has yet been erected in the U.S. but I have little doubt that ere long the invention will entirely supersede the old method and make large fortunes for those who obtain the privilege of working it in the neighborhood of our growing cities. I have written encouragingly to Mr. Pope on the subject and should be glad to see him secure the right for Louisville.\n\nWhen I wrote you last I was not informed of the gossip of our good town, and therefore gave you but little news. Since then I have learned a number of items which may interest you. In the first place, Catherine Wilkins and young Mr. Calhoun are not to be married. It has been broken off. Mrs. W has so announced to her friends, with a request that it should be given out. The cause, his intemperate habits. Between ourselves, I have my doubts whether that be the true reason. His habits are probably as good now as they were at the time the engagement was entered intoâat all events he is so far away that they have no means of ascertaining differently. He has never made her the first visit. That looks like insincerity from the first. My own conjecture is this: Catherine, though amiable, is very illiterate, and probably Mr. C is not, in that respect, much her superior. They have written to each other repeatedly, and the bad spelling, bad style, ridiculous matter, etc. have served to dispel that delightful infatuation without which all love must wither and die. In matters of this sort, it is difficult even for two sensible and educated persons so to conduct their correspondence as to lead to the happy result. The parties must always have their friends and counselors, to whom the precious billets doux are submitted. If those billets be ridiculous from any cause, above all should they be misspelled, in bad grammar, or boy-like hand, then the sharp criticism, the witty jest, and the loud laugh will check the rising flow of affection. The lover appears an ignoramus and Cupid, frightened from the nest which he had just begun to weave, spreads his wings and seeks his mother in the clouds.\n\nAnother unfortunate affair of the kind, Miss Herrow's beau, Mr. Hoge of New Orleans, it is said, has disgraced himself. The N.O.'s paper some time ago contained a full history of the matter. I have not read it, but understand the outline to have been something like this: Hoge was a friend of a Dr. Osborn thereâintimate in the family. Osborn's wife beautiful, Hoge abused the confidence of his friend and destroyed the peace of the family. Whilst the affair was under examination by her friends, Hoge left the city and came up here. It was reported in N.O. that he had fled, not to return. Under these circumstances, a kind of reconciliation took place between Osborn and his wife. Her friends, mother, sister, brother etc. were almost mad. To allay and soothe their distress, Osborn signed a paper stating that he was satisfied the charge had been made without foundation. A copy of this paper was immediately sent by someone to Hoge and received by him whilst here. Hoge forthwith returned, but kept himself concealed and sent a friend to inquire of Osborn if the affair was to be considered settled. Osborn procured a friend to wait upon Hoge with a challenge. Hoge refused to fight on the ground first that Osborn had already signed a paper saying that the charge was groundless, a copy of which he drew from his pocket; and in the second place if Osborn had signed what he did not know or believe, he had told a lie and could not be recognized as a gentleman. So this Osborn's friend replied that the paper had been signed for the sake of making peace in the family when it was supposed that Hoge had fled forever, that subsequent developments had placed the guilt of the parties beyond doubt; that it was too late for Hoge to seek to get off on the ground that his former friend was no longer a gentleman, and that if the principal was not a gentleman he was. Hoge then utterly refused to fight on any terms or with anybody, intimating that he was a Church member and ought not to be held responsible. To this it was answered that his conscience was too late in speaking, since it had remained quiescent under the crises and now only came forward as the champion of his cowardice.\n\nThus the affair appears from the controversy in the newspapers and remains at present. The universal impression here is that Hoge is as guilty and that his conduct afterwards was pusillanimous to the last degree. The Herrow family, however, think differently, and contend that time will clear his character and that his behavior throughout was that of a Christian. In the meanwhile, poor Bell is in great distress and has secluded herself entirely from the world, not even going to Church. The match it is said, has not been broken off, and will not be. How can a woman marry a disgraced man! But it is further reported that he has been acting the rascal as to herâthat it has never been his intention to marry her. Last spring she was ready to be married and it was deferred at his instance. Through the whole course of the summer she received but a single letter whilst she was writing every week. He has made her believe that he wrote every week and that his letters were miscarried! Again she was prepared to be married last fall, but he made an excuse to go to Steubenville to wait upon his sick father; and whilst there he received important news which made his immediate departure absolutely necessary.\n\nIf these things be true what do you say should be done with the man?\n\nThis is the brilliant match which everyone was talking of so lately.\n\nThis letter I have written in very great haste, and am anxious to get it in the mail tonight so you will of yourself supply any omissions and make necessary corrections. Once again love to the family and 1000 sweet kisses to Carry.\n\nA. W. Miss Berlin has written home that it will be out of her power to make you a visit till after their examinations. This information may save you the trouble and expense of a visit to Georgetown the present month. Best regards to Mr. [Withers?]\n\nAndrew Wylie, Jr. to Caroline Bryan Wylie , 15 March 1846\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition: WHM Purchase, 2013\n\nTranscript: Pittsburg, March 15, 1846\n\nI have deferred, my dear Carry, this long to answer your sweet letter of the 6th, expecting every day another from you in reply to my last. I see, however, that it is no use to wait longer in expectation, as every day's postponement will have the effect to put off still further the period when I shall hear from you again. As you say, the first year of our married life has just reached its close. It has been to me by far the happiest of my life, and is an augury of still more happy years to come. I desire no better good for myself than to be near you forever in the enjoyment of our reciprocal affection, and cannot but think that something would be wanting xxxx in Heaven, if I were not 'married & given in marriage with you'. Along with you how glad and ready I am to renew for the future \"our vows of constancy and affectionâ¦\" Those vows which I make to you, not as an obligation renewed, but as the xxxx expression of most faithful and tenderest love. You must try to realize the deep anxiety I feel for your return. I can hardly think or dream of any other subject. This Christian and comfortable virtue of \"professing ones soul in patience\" can hardly be exercised in regard to an object so much desired. How happy it makes me to forget the four weeks which still intervene and realize as present the joy of looking into your loving eyes, kissing those sweet lips, and pressing you to my bosom.\n\nI shall not be able to tell whether it will be necessary for me to visit Washington myself till the receipt of a letter, which I expect every day, from the Treasury Department. I should be glad indeed if it should turn out for my interest to make the visit. We could then return so nicely together. I have as yet heard of no person who is going on from this part of the world, with the intention of returning at the time you have fixed. If I do not go myself, you may be sure that no efforts will be spared by me to secure a suitable opportunity for you, of which you shall be duly informed.\n\nSince I wrote you last we have had some very pleasant weather. The ice has disappeared from the streets, and the scavengers have been at work, and made the town comfortably clean & passableâas much so as Pittsburg could be expected to be. Thus far the season has been much more agreeable than the lastânone of those high and cold, dry winds which prevailed so incessantly then, and which seemed to have been sent by offended Heaven to prepare our houses and property the better for the burning of the 10th Aprilâbut mild and rather tepid weather, causing the streams to flow full between their banks bringing out the birds with their music, the green grass upon the earth, and the bursting buds upon the trees. You cannot imagine how relieved and happy I was on hearing that your back was cured. It was an event worthy of the notice of congratulation from your friends. These diseases of the spine have extraordinary terrors for me. An enemy whom you can meet in front is more honorable, and less dangerous than the one who steals upon your back.\n\nI think we shall have comfortable quarters at the Exchange. I have selected two rooms, a parlor and chamber adjoining, and opening by a door into each other. They are situated on the Penn Street wing of the house and on the second floor, are large airy and fine rooms, and furnished with gas for lights. The charge for board will be $10 a week, we to have our own chamber furnished, and washing done. The new proprietor thinks that house will be ready for us at farthest by the 10th April. It is to be repainted and furnished with new carpeting and furniture throughout.\n\nI send you inclosed forty dollars, which appear to me to be quite little enough for your purpose. Indeed, I cannot understand how you have managed to get along so economically. I received a letter a few days ago from Mr. Helm in reply to one which I had written to him about three months ago. Whilst at Louisville, you know, I wrote him inclosing one of our patents, and the papers connected with the title under it, asking his attention to the business and a reply to my letter, to be directed to this place. After my return, I waited a long time & still no reply. I then wrote him on the subject a second letter, to which also, there was no answer. Then I wrote a third in polite & respectful, yet rather stinging language adverting to the former letters, his omission to reply to them or to return the papers and informing him that I had written to Mr. Stewart of Brandenburgh on the subject and sent him an order on him (Helm) for the patent and all the papers connected with it. This brought an answer in which Mr. H declared that he had received all my letters, that he had laid out my two first letters to be answered before he left home for the Legislature, and until the receipt of the third was fully impressed that he had answered them; apologized for the neglect, and offered to undertake the business and push it with vigor. I have not yet replied to him but will do so today or tomorrow. Helm understands the case better than any lawyer in that country, knows where the land is, and can do better for us if he is disposed than any one else. The tract referred to is that about the locality of which I had so much trouble and for a time was so far misled by Mr. Hardin.\n\n[Receive ?] my love to the family and accept a double portion for yourself.\n\nYour own\n\nAW\n\nElizabeth Wylie to Andrew Wylie, Jr. , 14 October 1853\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition: Gift of PWL, 2010\n\nTranscript: Bloomington Oct 14, 1853\n\nDear Brother,\n\nOrchard & some other individual, he did not say who, desire to buy us out of house & home & I write to know if you are willing to sell; the price you would ask, & the price you would take for it. We at home here are very desirous to sell as we consider we are doing without the interest of $4000, or thereabouts, as long as we reside in it; the house is much too large for us, taxes have to be paid on so large an amt. that brings in nothing, & after while, in fact right away, some repairs will have to be made. Orchard wishes us all to agree to the sale & the price; says half of the money will be paid down, & the remainder in a few months. We have not told him our price, won't until we hear from you all. We, including the Dr. and Mary, think $5000 a fair price for it, would not sell for less. Have two projects in view in case the sale can be effected: to build a cottage on the ground you will know designated the \"middle fields,\" let John take one thousand or whatever he may value his interest in the Estate & make such an investment of the remainder as you think best. Our other plan is to purchase Bead's farm, which we suppose can be got for 3000 five hundred, or perhaps $3000. It is a fine farm of 160 acres, well watered, and improved. The house excepting two rooms, is new & all the out houses new & convenient. Orchard has not said anything about the minors standing in the way, have no idea the minors will ever gainsay the bargain, so we can just set them aside. Write immediately on the recpt of this, & let us know your opinion of these matters, as Orchard wishes to know soon as possible. Living here increases Redick's work a good deal; all the hauling is up hill work, & when we take into account the present high rate of wages & his own time & labor, it amounts to a good deal. This is a lovely spot, & having been purchased & built & the residence of our dear father for so many years, in short the Homestead, we shall feel heart sick at parting with it, but there are many considerations that make it advisable to do so. We may not have an opportunity to sell again for years; property like this is not saleable often in a town of this size & situation. Redick says if you have not written to Brooks about the R.R. damages you need not unless you think it advisable to do so yourself. He is about making a contract to pay the balance of the stock due in wood, 200 cords. They offer $2.25 per cord which is much too cheap, Redick is willing to furnish it however at that price as he wants land cleared down there & they give in town but 1.50 delivered. Received a letter from John yesterday. His health grows worse & he has at last determined to go South, or to Cal. Think he will go to Cal. Poor fellow, we fear 'tis too late, too late. How long we have urged him to go, for years, but he would not bestir himself until now. He wishes someone of the family to buy out his interest in the Estate, or if that cannot be done he wishes to know if the family can among all lend him 250 dols. He is coming to see us in a week or two when we will see what can be done for him. Redick has some money at interest which he says he shall have; mother will do what she can for him. Have written him today of the contemplated sale of the house etc. He wishes to take Lizzie with him. We are very unwilling to have him go alone & hope it will be possible for him to take her. Perhaps by making enquiry, you might obtain him a cheaper passage than the common rates. Not one of the family I know would object to John taking more than the sum he estimates his share of the Estate. Infer from the drift of his conversation & he values it at one thousand. Should he take Lizzie, he will need fifteen hundred at least, besides the 400 he has saved & has now on hand. Should the house be sold, all, I know, will agree to let the poor sick brother draw that much. The Cars have been arriving for several days. They have waked up the country. 'Tis an era in the state of our affairs; would appreciate them more highly than I do but Mother & I are constantly uneasy lest the horses may take fright, run away & hurt or do worse for Redick. Thinking of his hauling that wood right along side of the track takes away my appetite now & I think will take away my breath almost when he commences it. Some of the horses about do not mind it, whilst others take on at a terrible rate. Ours are not wild, but they might scare if very near the Iron Horse they have seen distant hundred yards or so, snorting along, but did not regard it with any other manifestation than eying him with a very curious look. Perhaps they may look upon it in a sensible light as one of the improvements of the age & so I hope they will. Dr. Ryors is still here. Morrison (one of the trustees) made a statement in the town paper he did not like & no wonder for 'twas insulting, so he resigned the Chair of mathematics on the spot. Some efforts are being made to get cousin Theophilus back. There are about one hundred students in attendance this Session, a good many more than last. Daily is straining every nerve to build it up & so he will bring numbers. Methodism & Democracy are rife in this part of the country. Anything they set their shoulders to is bound to go ahead. Think the West ought to be given up to them entirely. All join me in much love to Carry & yourself. I am your affect. Sister\n\nLiz Mary & family are well P.S. The enclosed 5 dols. Jenny sends to make out the $50 you invested for her. In the sale of the house the 23 or 27 acres belonging are included. No one remembers exactly the no. of acres.\n\nElizabeth Wylie McCalla to Caroline Bryan Wylie , 9 May 1859\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition: Gift of PWL, 2010\n\nTranscript: Bloomington May 9th 1859\n\nDear Andrew & Carry,\n\nOf course I can say nothing to lessen your grief for dear little Andrew's loss, nor will I attempt it; but desire to express our sympathy & to say we also feel bereaved in his death. We were all proud of him & referred to him as a model for children to imitate; can truly say we never saw, or knew his equal in good qualities, talent, etc. Everyone here, who saw him spoke with admiration of the child. It often brings tears to our eyes when we think of the severity of the stroke you are called upon to endure. We are so glad you brought him to see us. The dear pleasant child left naught but sweet memories of himself; as oft as we think of him with pleasure we dwell on his remembrance. Poor Irene who has felt so severely the loss of her two interesting children, when speaking of Andrew's loss in her last letter, says nothing tends to lift the thoughts, desires, & affections, & efforts Heavenward so much as the loss of children, dear lovely children. We have all been called upon to endure so many afflictions the last few years & Mother's loss so recently that we indeed in an especial manner ought to lay these things to heart. This life, & the things of it, are so fleeting, uncertain, & unsatisfying, that I for one, can truly say I seem to hold them by a thread, a breath. We feel poor mother's loss so much. She was so much younger in appearance that she really was & so active & vigorous that we had never thought of her death but as far distant. Alas! How swift & unlooked for, the blow that took her from us. She had many trials, cares, & anxieties to pass through. Oh we trust she is at rest now. In the Spring she was wont to spend so much time in the yard & garden, took such an interest in everything going on, was always about & busy, that we seem to miss her more now than in the dreary winter weeks that followed her death. Samuel Martin & Redick are busy farming & gardening. The spring, until the last 10 days, has been so wet & disagreeable that there was no time for plowing. Redick is now planting corn. Peaches are mostly killed, but apples are safe thus far. We shall have enough of the former for eating. Samuel's health is better than it was. Redick I am grieved to say, still has that effection of the throat that has troubled him so much the last 7 or 10 years. Do wish you would use your influence, Andrew, (& we think you have more perhaps with him than anyone else) to induce him to apply to some skilful physician, ere it be too late. When he coughs it goes to my heart like a death knell. Margaret is kept quite busy with her children. Mary & Sue go to school. They are wild as birds & about as unmanageable. Margaret is in better health than she had been in China. She looked & felt miserably weak when she arrived last July tho she said she had been vastly recruited by the voyage. Samuel has not yet determined where he will settle; intends prospecting some farther, thinks of visiting Ill with a view to looking out a home. He will make a good farmer should he have health & strength to work. He is a good manager, tho not as economical as he might be. Irene writes she is coming out to spend part of the Summer with us & wishes to know when you will be here, Andrew, as she would like to meet you here. Carry, we would be so happy to receive a visit from you too, & to see the dear baby. Cannot you come? We see or know nothing to prevent. This is the last Summer we shall probably spend together at the old Homestead (sad it is to think so) & we would so like to have you all come. Cousin Theophilus talks of buying the House, but thinks it too high. Dunning says he will give $5000 for the house & the 20 acres of ground & no more. We think it too little, that figure. Property here has raised very much the last five years & is still on the rise. Jane intends going on in the Fall to live with Anderson. He wishes her to go very much. Poor Jenny seems more desolate now than any of us. Mr. McCalla intends starting this afternoon for Chicago to look after that unfortunate debt due him. The Firm made an assignment some time since. The Creditors offer him a piece of land, ten (10) acres, seven miles from the City for the debt ($3,300). It is not worth the half. He is most reluctant to take it but thinks it better than nothing. He has not capital to go into business for himself & is still clerking for Howe. These reverses are dreadful, but he bears them with "
