        "text": "Mary Eleanor Lincoln (cont)\n\nMARY ELEANOR (ELENDER)11 CONNOR (ELLENDER10 LINCOLN, HANANIAH9, THOMAS8, MORDECAI7, MORDECAI6, SAMUEL5, EDWARD F.4, RICHARD G.3, ROBERT H.2, ROBERT1) was born November 28, 1837 in Tell City, Perry Co., IN, and died October 29, 1907 in Tell City, Perry Co., IN. She married PHILIP HARTWELL SMITH February 27, 1859 in Tell City, Perry Co., IN, son of FRANCIS SMITH and NANCY HARTWELL. He was born October 21, 1827 in Burke Hollow, Caledonia, VT, and died Bet. March 01 – October 29, 1906 in Tell City, Perry Co., IN.\n\nNotes for MARY ELEANOR (ELENDER) CONNOR:\n\nPhillip Hartwell Smith married Mary Eleanor Connor in 1859. Their\n\ndescendents are related to Abraham Lincoln as half cousins as follows:\n\nMary Eleanor Connor (Ancestors)\n\nJesse D. Connor x Ellender Lincoln\n\nHananiah Lincoln x Sarah Jane Jeffries\n\nThomas Lincoln x Elizabeth Davis\n\nMordecai Lincoln (b.1686) x Mary Robeson\n\nMary Robeson was Mordecai Lincoln’s second or third wife (married July,\n\n1729). His first or second wife was Hannah Salter (married 9-9-1714). There\n\nis some argument that Mordecai may have married before Hannah Salter.\n\nMordecai Lincoln (b. 1686) x Hannah Salter (Descendants)\n\nJohn Lincoln x Rebecca Flowers\n\nAbraham Lincoln (b.1739) x Bathsheba Herring\n\nThomas Lincoln x Nancy Hanks\n\nAbraham Lincoln (b. 1809)-the President\n\nMordecai (1686) was Abe’s greatgreatgrandfather, and he was Mary Eleanor\n\nConnor’s greatgreatgrandfather. Hope this helps………………Jim\n\nEd Smith writes:\n\n“In an old family Bible that I uncovered in Indianapolis it states that Mary Connor Smith was a second cousin to Abraham Lincoln and was quite intimate with him and canvassed with him on the election trail.”\n\nMore About MARY ELEANOR (ELENDER) CONNOR:\n\nBurial: Avery Cemetery, Perry Co., IN\n\nNotes for PHILIP HARTWELL SMITH:\n\nPHILLIP Smith was born in Caledonia Co., Vt., October 21, 1827, and is the third of five children of Francis and Nancy (Hartwell) Smith, both of whom were of English extraction. In 1837 the parents moved West to Wayne Co., Ind. Philip remained at home with his parents until the age of twenty-nine, at which time he settled on land bought two years before under the Graduation Act of Congress. Since that time he has been a resident of this Co., . In February, 1859, he married Mary E. Connor and by her has seven children, Ernest, Edward C., Elexia, Gertrude, Horace G. Mary and Owen. Edward and Elexia are dead. Our subject in youth served an apprenticeship at the printer’s trade. Since coming here he has followed farming, and now owns 600 acres of land. He was formerly a Republican but is now a Democrat, and has been the nominee of the last named party in this Co., for representative to the State Legislature twice. In 1848 he was associated with Rawson Vaile, of Kokomo, in the publication of the Free Territory Sentinel at Centerville, Wayne Co., Ind., which sheet assisted in the election of George W. Julian, the first anti-slavery member of congress from Indiana.\n\n“History of Warrick, Spencer and Perry Counties, Indiana – Anderson Township” by Goodspeed Bros. & Co., – published in 1885\n\n—–Copied from Ed Smith’s Smith Family Page:\n\n“Letter from Philip Hartwell Smith to Wm. H. English\n\nNear Bristow Aug 5th ’88\n\nHon. Wm H. English\n\nYour letter came to hand in due time but found me very busily engaged in the harvest time of the farm and was laid aside for a more convenient time and then forgotten.\n\nComing across the letter today I will write, though it may be too late for your book. The sketch you have is very short and imperfect.\n\nWas born on the 21st of Oct in 1827 in Caledonia Co., in Vermont. Came to Indiana with my parents ten years later. Entered the office of the “Wayne Co., Record”, published in Old Centreville in ’43 as printer’s devil; ran away before my time was up in 46. Started and 8 by 10 weekly paper in the town of Milton. In ‘48, when the great “free soil” uprising was had, I became the boy partner of Rawson Vaile in publishing the “Free Territory Sentinel” and for pay, had the satisfaction of helping to send Geo. W. Julian to Congress. You are well acquainted with this bit of political history. I am satisfied with and somewhat proud of the ends we reached.\n\nI am a farmer and belong to no church.\n\nPolitics = Well I am a Democrat and all that that means. I am so much of Democrat that I have a Unknown opinion that the Mills bill is only a halfway measure of relief; but I only say this to discreet Democrats.\n\nI was a charter member of the Republican party and voted the ticket straight up to the candidacy of Peter Cooper. Since that election I have voted the Democratic ticket.\n\nI have never held office, other than you are informed, and shall never seek to do so. I am a farmer and only ask for fair play of others in interest for my business. To this end I shall give some of my time and energy to the success of the Democratic Ticket. Perhaps with the facts you have and these I give you, you may prepare a sketch that will suit your work. I wish you much success in the undertaking.\n\nThe Democracy of Perry held a rousing Co., convention yesterday. The crowd was simply immense. Immense in enthusiasm as well as numbers. We placed a good Co., ticket in the field and the best of feeling prevailed all along the line. So you may write us down at headquarters as united, untamed and jubilant Democrats.\n\nAccept regards,\n\nPhilip Smith”\n\nMore About PHILIP HARTWELL SMITH:\n\nBurial: Avery Cemetery, Perry Co., IN\n\nPolitics: State Rep. 53rd & 54th Gen’l Assembly\n\nChildren of MARY CONNOR and PHILIP SMITH are:\n\ni.
