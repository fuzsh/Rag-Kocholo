        "text": "Academy Awards \"Wall-E\" an Oscar for Animation, But Not Song, Sound or Screenplay\n\nUSNews.com ~ February 23, 2009\n\nWall-E, the animated film dear to the hearts of Americans and green bloggers alike, took home only one trophy out of its record-tying six nominations last night. Director Andrew Stanton accepted the Oscar for the film in the \"Best Animated Film\" category, a win that came as a surprise to no one. The film was also nominated for Original Score, Original Song, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, and Original Screenplay. Its six nominations put it in company with Beauty and the Beast, which is widely considered to be the best animated film of all time.\n\nThough the film was up against steep competition in the other categories, there was talk that Wall-E had a shot at Original Screenplay, since the film paid homage to classic Charlie Chaplin films. Because much of the film was silent, score played an important role, and composer Thomas Newman, like Kate Winslet, has been a constant nominee, but never an Oscar winner. Though Newman previously took home two Grammys for Wall-E (Best Song for a Motion Picture, and Best Arrangement), the Academy decided this was not his year.\n\nWall-E's song, \"Down to Earth,\" was written by Peter Gabriel but performed during the ceremony by John Legend. It was part of a medley of the two other nominated songs from Slumdog Millionaire, and was given a Bollywood tinge by being sandwiched in between. The song, naturally, continued the sustainable message of the film - that we should conserve, appreciate our natural resources, and clean up our messes.\n\nTarzan in Top 3 most visited musicals in The Netherlands\n\nAfter nearly 900 shows and 1.6 million visitors the successfull musical Tarzan will definitely close on may 24rd. It was announced earlier that the curtain would drop on March 31st but because of the huge demand for tickets, Joop van den Ende Theaterproducties decided to extend Tarzan's run. The musical Tarzan still brings in full houses, but on May 24th 2009 Tarzan and Jane will swing for the last time in the Fortis Circustheatre.\n\nTarzan will enter the Top 3 of most visited open end musicals in The Netherlands after The Lion King and The Phantom of the Opera.\n\nChantal Janzen returns to Tarzan the Musical as Jane\n\nAmsterdam, - It is definite. Chantal Janzen will return as Jane in the musical Tarzan. Because of its huge success, the musical, which had been schedules to close March 31st 2009, has been extended until may 24th 2009. Due to this, Chantal, who gave birth to son James on January 23rd 2009, will have enough time to rehearse from mid March. A definitive date when Chantal returns as Jane is not known yet. Currently, Bente van den Brand is playing the role of Jane.\n\nNetherlands news submitted by Ron de Laat.\n\nhttp://www.hollandmeetserb.nl\n\nJonas Brothers new estate has a Tarzan connection\n\nThaiindian News ~ February 20, 2009\n\nWashington, Feb 20 (ANI): American pop-rock band Jonas Brothers have bought a new dazzling family compound in Hollywood Hills which is right next door to Jennifer Lopezs estate , and includes the former home of movie Tarzan Johnny Weismuller, which has laid empty for over 20 years. The Jonas Brothers are reportedly planning to spend the spring renovating their newly bought estate, once they are through with their promotional duties for new flick Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience. A source says, \"It's a boy's own dream - Tarzan's broken down mansion. It'll be like a magical playground for the brothers.\" Mystery surrounds Cheeta, purportedly the world's oldest chimpanzee\n\nLA Times ~ February 14, 2009\n\nCould Cheeta the chimp, the famous performing primate who's said to have starred alongside Johnny Weissmuller in the Tarzan films and Rex Harrison in Dr. Doolittle, be an impostor? It's a story whose plot resembles a 1930s screwball comedy, but author R.D. Rosen says it's true: Cheeta the chimp, said to be the oldest nonhuman primate in the world at 76, is not who he claims to be. (Or rather, he's not who his deceased trainer, Tony Gentry, claimed he was.)

The Oscar winner has asked Sommers to computer-generated animals instead of the real thing. She insists ape actors are emotionally and physically abused during their film and TV careers, and spend the rest of their lives in zoos. Huston writes, \"Critics lauded King Kong in particular for the emotional depth that the giant ape displayed - without any real apes suffering in the process. \"Can I please hear that you similarly plan to use only creative alternatives to great apes in Tarzan?\"\n\nTravis Fimmel milks his role on \"The Beast\" for all it's worth\n\nFresnobee.com ~ January 26, 2009\n\nWhen he first arrived in Los Angles he stayed with his agent for three weeks and borrowed $1,000 to start acting class. Fimmel, 29, is still studying. \"Half of acting is you're very intimidated,\" he says, \"overcoming your fears, letting yourself be vulnerable in front of people and that sort of stuff. I'm still in the same acting class, I should be a lot better than I am.\" He was so humble about his talent that he didn't audition for anything the first two years. \"I knew I wasn't up to par, so I wouldn't audition then. I've been very lucky. My biggest problem is I love Australia so much and I spend most of my time there.\"\n\nWhen he finally summoned the courage to audition he tried out for pilot season and was cast in \"Tarzan.\" \"Don't write that,\" he says, pressing the air with his hand. \"It wasn't very good. Every year I'd come back for pilot season. I had a couple that didn't get picked up. And then I did a movie at home and a couple movies here, and went home. Came back for pilot season again and this (\"The Beast\") was my favorite script and I had a chance to act opposite an acting icon, so I was so lucky they wanted me.\" More>>>\n\nFor the latest news on the John Carter film project vist:\n\nwww.barsoom.com\n\nat\n\nwww.johncarterofmars.com/news"
