The report states that Acree assumed that Kesler and Acree's wife were having an affair, and he confronted Kesler while he was in Glendale on business matters. Acree revealed a revolver and acting in self-defense, Kesler states he stopped the assailant with his own weapon. Shortly thereafter, Kesler surrendered himself to Constable Joe Shepherd of Glendale. Kesler was then held on a $2500 bond and charged with murdering Acree. A photo of David Acree was included in the header of this page.\n\nAldrich [Aldridge], Zachariah:\n\nAldrich, Sarah (Cole):\n\nThe early years of this Aldrich family have not yet been located and little has been furnished for our purposes here.

Edwin was his son.\n\n​\n\nAlward, Edward R.:\n\nAlward, Ella (Merk):\n\nEdward R. Alward was born in November of 1860 in the state of Kansas. He was third son of Epherim Alward and Mary W. (last name not known). Epherim Alward was a Minister of the Gospel from New Brunswick, Canada. Mother Mary W. was from Kentucky. Edward and his brother William both became druggists and plied their trades in Montana Territory. Edwardwas in Glendale, then later in the mining districts of Northern Idaho at Burke, Idaho. William was in Virginia City and later in Bozeman. Edward Alwards earliest footprint in the upstart smelter town of Glendale seems to have been as reported in the local Atlantis newspaper, where it noted in there December 28, 1879 issue, \"new drug store, J.W. Morris' with Ed Alward dispensing druggist.\" Not long afterward he was on his own and as noted in the April 12, 1884 Dillon Tribune, \"Dr. Alward has declared spring and he has uncorked his soda fountain in vindication thereof.\" He has been noted as having participated in local theatrical group offerings, played with local band group, and served as Glendale school clerk. On June 3, 1885, in Twin Bridges, Edward was married to Ella Merk, daughter of prominent Madison County pioneer merchant and mining mogul, F. R. Merk. They had two children, Mamie in May 1886 and Edward E. in April 1888. It seems that Edward began having some difficulties with his business as noted in the October 1886 issue of the Dillon Tribune, that \"a rumor comes from Glendale to the effect that E. R. Alward, druggist, has assigned to N. Armstrong & Company, and that Dr. Schmalhausen is in charge of the store for assignees.\" Then a note appeared in the same paper on November 12, 1886 to wit: \"understand that Thomas E. Jones and Dr. James L. Jones have purchased the Alward drug store and that the new firms name will be Jones & Jones.\" In February of 1887 a notice was posted in the Tribune announcing the pending sheriff's sale of a house and 4 lots, owned by E.R. Alward, in lieu of delinquent taxes of $12.95. In 1900 Edward had moved on to the Idaho mining district and opened a store at Burke, Idaho.\n\n1870 Jun 21 - Census - at Washington twp., Doniphan Co., Kansas is Epherim Alward, age 39, Minister of the Gospel, values of 1400/470; from New Brunswick; wife Mary W. is 34 of Kentucky; children listed are:\n\nWilliam M. 13, of Missouri; Harry L. is 11, Ed R. is 8 and Charles S. at 6, all with Kansas nativity; Mary E. is 3 of Missouri and Hattie A. is 1 of Kansas.\n\n1879 Dec 28 - Atlantis newspaper at Glendale, M.T. reports of \"J.

It is published here under that name to be found in the index of biographies.]\n\n​\n\nArbour, Alfred J. (Fred):\n\nArbour, Ida (Terry): Joseph\n\nAlfred J. Arbour was born on February 12, 1863, the third son of Joseph and Hildegard (Labelle) Arbour in Quebec, Canada. Because he was called Fred instead of Alfred, some people assumed that his real name was Frederick. Fred was but a small child when the family immigrated to the US in 1865. One research account has the family in the 9th Ward, Chicago, Illinois at the time of the 1870 census. Sometime after that the family moved on west and was in the Bryant mining district in the late 1870's. A newspaper account noted that \"Joseph Arbour has a two story building which is occupied by R. R. Miller and used as a boarding house.\" (Butte Miner)\n\nOn May 8, 1887 in Melrose, Montana, Fred married Ida Terry, daughter of David and Elizabeth (Miller) Terry who had come to the Territory from Utah, also in the mid to late 1870's. Fred and Ida had three children:\n\nVivian Grace, born on Feb 12, 1884 in Glendale\n\nBlanche, born on June 6, 1888 in Glendale\n\nJoseph, born on March 1, 1890, Glendale\n\n1865 - Immigrated to the USA. Joseph Arbour stated this to be the date he emigrated from Canada to the US on the 1900 US Federal Census. Alfred would have been a mere lad at the time.\n\n1887 Jun 1 - Article from a Dillon Tribune column notes, \"On last Sunday afternoon Fred Arbour, while up on Lion mountain, invited his wife and Mrs. Papa to take a ride down the tramway with him. Everything went well until they struck the steep pitch, just above Greenwood, when the speed of the car became so great that Fred must have got scared and turned the brake the wrong way, and the car jumped the track and threw Fred and Mrs. Papa against the timbers of the snow shed. The latter was rendered unconscious and remained so for two hours, but is now much better. Dr. James L. Jones was called in to attend her case and reports her on the mend. Fred Arbour received a deep cut in his forehead and has not yet (Wednesday) fully recovered his consciousness. Dr. Raymond Mitchell is attending upon him and reports some improvement. Mrs. Arbour only received a slight scratch on the face. All these parties can \"thank their stars\" that they got off as lucky as they did. The wonder is that one of them was left to tell the story.\"\n\n1887 - Jan 17\\April 12 - a Glendale general merchants account ledger book has revealed purchases made on account, during this time period.

Fred and Ida eventually divorced over her extracurricular relationship with George Seymore, whom Ida later married. During the proceedings, George Seymore (spelling in\n\ncourt records) bit off Fred's middle finger on his left hand. Fred was awarded damages of $2000 plus the $8.70 cost of his suit.

Armstrong. The son of Noah Armstrong, the founder, of the Hecla Mining Company, Charles was born to Noah and Hannah (Howd) Armstrong in February, 1858 at or near South Bend, in Blue Earth County, Minnesota. By the age of 19, Charles was living in Glendale, Montana Territory with his family. In 1877, he was in business as partner with Z. E. Thomas dealing in general merchandise for the rapidly developing Bryant Mining district. Almost immediately a branch store was opened up on the mountain at Trapper City. The name of Thomas & Armstrong soon grew into a fine two story brick structure on the north side of Main street in the main block of Glendale.\n\nA double joyous Christmas Day was celebrated by the Armstrong's of Glendale in 1878...Charles joined in wedlock with Bertha Elizabeth Mannheim (daughter of John and Veronica Mannheim, also of Glendale, who had emigrated from Prussia and involved in the brewery business.) The ceremony was in the Methodist Church at Glendale and witnessed by Samuel Barbour and Byron Cook.\n\nThe young family was blessed with three children, Harry C. in December of 1879, Nellie G. in October 1880 and Ethel L. December of 1882. However, terrible tragedy struck the family in the spring of 1883, when they were forced to endure the ultimate hardships, like so many parents of the times, when an epidemic plagued the tiny community. Their three beautiful little\n\nchildren, Harry, Nellie and Ethel were stricken with the dreaded fever and died within days of one another. The grieving parents had to bury and eventually leave behind these three little loved ones in the cemetery on the hill just outside of Glendale.\n\nWhile still at Glendale, in November of 1884, Carl E. was born and later in June 1885, Leland M. was born. The only daughter that survived to adulthood, Cora E. was born April of 1889. Records show she was born in Seattle, Washington, creating a time line approximating when this family moved to that area. They would remain there the rest of their lives.\n\n1860 Jun 16 - Census - listed at South Bend, Blue Earth County, Minnesota is Noah Armstrong, farmer with valuation of 2000/200; from Canada; wife Hannah is 38 and from NY; children: Emma is 4 and Charles is 2, both born here in MN.\n\n1870 Jun 3 - Census - listed at Lanesburg, LeSueur County, Minnesota, with the Peck family, who earlier were listed as hotel operators, is Hannah Armstrong, age 43, from NY; Emma is 13 and Charles is 12, both attending school and are from MN.\n\n1877 Jul 24 - The Butte Miner mentions that Charles Armstrong and Z.E.

He moved to Blue Earth County, Minnesota and in August of 1859 was deeded 122.95 acres of fertile farmland. He married Hannah Howd and they had two children while there, Emma in May of 1856 and Charles W. in February of 1858. Another daughter, Ida died in 1864 at the age of four years. Records show that Noah arrived in Madison County, Montana Territory in late 1862 or early 1863. He returned to Minnesota and moved his family to Montana Territory. Mining speculation was Noah Armstrong’s primary vocation and he teamed up for a time with Charles L. Dahler, under the company name of Dahler & Armstrong and began acquiring mining claims in the Trapper Creek lodes. At the time, they were shipping their silver ores as far as Wales for refinement, and still at a profit. Dahler and Armstrong dissolved their partnership and Armstrong interested a group of investors in Indiana to back his action. He had ownership then of Utopia, Monoa, Symington and the Vitalis Lodes. Later Noah claimed the Cleve, the Avon, the Atlantis and the Alta Lodes. Not long after in his fold were the Saxon and the Hecla. Hecla would become his trademark property and the name of the newly formed Company formed to produce the capital to advance his vision of mining and smelting their ores at much greater profit. In 1875, the first smelter at Glendale was built.\n\nIn 1877 Noah incorporated at Indianapolis, Indiana under that state's corporate law. Noah remained a major shareholder, of equal number with Elias C. Atkins, an industrialist that was at the time a partner of Henry Knippenberg in the Atkins Saw Works. He continued to manage this company until 1879.\n\nIn 1881 Knippenberg was installed as the general manager of the company. In 1883 tragedy struck the Armstrong’s when the epidemic claimed the lives of three of Noah’s little grandchildren; Harry, Nellie and Carl. Then in June of 1885, Noah’s beloved Hannah was taken from him and was laid to rest in the Glendale Cemetery near her three grandchildren. Noah began looking in other directions to further his ambitions, becoming involved in the Spokane, Washington and Northern Idaho vicinities with the Spokane & Couer D’ Alene Railroad and a transfer company in Seattle, and of course his passion which was on par with the others of raising thoroughbred horses. A wonderful biography is available in book form titled “Spirit Horse of the Rockies” by Susan R. Nardinger that tells the story of Noah Armstong’s successes with his thoroughbred race horses, and the triumph of “Spokane” winning the 1889 Kentucky Derby. Following the success at the Derby, Noah took up residency in Seattle and remained there, until his death on April 21, 1907.\n\n​\n\nAtkins, Elias Cornelius:\n\nAtkins, Sarah J. (Wells):\n\nAtkins, Mary (Dolbeare):\n\nAtkins, Sarah Frances (Parker):\n\nAs one of the major players in the creation and perpetuation of the Bryant Mining District and the impact on the surrounding vicinity that grew to become Glendale, Lions City and the like was a stalwart figure of a man who came originally from Connecticut. Born June 28, 1833 at Bristol, Hartford County, CT, the youngest child, and third son of Rollin and Harriet (Bishop) Atkins. Elias grew up in the Connecticut area but by the time he was in his mid twenties, had moved to Indianapolis, Indiana. He was an ingenious young fellow with obvious learned skills as a machinist and shortly was establishing himself as a maker of various components used in the mechanical trades of the times. He almost immediately found his mark in the creation of circular saw blades. The small upstart manufacturing venture would grow to become one of the largest manufacturers of saw blades in America and achieved a world wide market. The corporation grew and continued for many years beyond the passing of its founder, Elias C. Atkins. Eventually the corporation, still under the direction of Elias C. Atkins descendants, sold to the Borg-Warner Corp. still in business today. Elias Cornelius Atkins was first married to Sarah J. Wells, who also was from Connecticut, in about 1855. They had a daughter Harriet J. in about 1856. Sarah died a the very young age of 29. In about 1864 Elias married Mary Dolbeare, also of Connecticut, but of who we have become familiar very little. It is presumed she died very soon after the birth of their son William D. Atkins. Then on August 17, 1865 Elias was married to Sarah Frances Parker, who was originally from Newton Centre, Massachusetts. Together they had seven children, the oldest was named Mary Dolbeare Atkins, which supports the theory that Elias' second wife died young and this child was to be her namesake. The remaining children of Elias and Sarah Atkins were, Henry C.; Sarah Frances; Emma Louisa; Carra Isabel; William Avery and Elias C. Atkins. Most of his children and there spouses were to become part of the Atkins Saw Works Empire.\n\nElias C. Atkins almost certainly met Noah Armstrong in Indianapolis, Indiana although what and through which connections who met whom is not totally clear, it is common knowledge that a partnership between the two developed by the mid 1870's when both were speculators in the mine fields of Western Montana Territory. Their association spawned the embryo for a group of mining enthusiasts and or investors, who would become the Hecla Consolidated Mining Company. It was in Indianapolis in 1877 that the articles of incorporation were filed for the state of Indiana, with Noah Armstrong and Elias Atkins as the two principal stockholders, holding equal numbers of shares. Others that were accepted into the fold were John Thomas, Dr. Horace Allen, William P. Johnson, Aquilla Jones, William Rockwood; Charles B. Parkman and from Jersey, Matthew Baird one of the most successful and wealthiest manufacturers in the east. In another section on this web site you will find more detailed history of the HCMC and its founders.\n\nIn 1878/1879 and into the 1880's, Elias Atkins was living at Glendale and was the General agent for the Hecla Consolidated Mining company. Whether his personal interests for investing in the mining industry were waning or skepticism of some of his investor partners were becoming questionable, is not certain. But what is certain Atkins made it quite clear that his intent when arriving at the helm of the operations in Montana Territory, was to enhance the marketability of the entire operation and to get it sold. Much could and should be written about the rise and fall of the first administrative efforts of the HCMC, as this compiler believes there is much, much more to the story. The common attitude that prevailed over the next couple of decades, was that of some magical success was generated at the hand of the Henry Knippenberg, the new General Manager sent to the mines in April of 1881 to save the company. (Much more about the history of the HCMC and Henry Knippenberg in other sections of this site.)\n\nFollowing the management changes that occurred in early 1881, Elias C. Atkins returned permanently to his home in Indianapolis and resumed the diligent management of his manufacturing enterprises. He continued as a stockholder in the HCMC and shared in the many rewards that followed. His manufacturing company continued in the family until 1952 when it was acquired by the Borg-Warner Company.\n\nElias C. Atkins died on April 15, 1901, just a couple months short of his 68th birthday. He was interred in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana. Mrs. Sarah F. Parker Atkins, died October 1, 1920 and is interred beside her husband at Crown Hill Cemetery.\n\n​\n\nAvery, Henry H.:\n\nHenry H. Avery was from New York and located in Glendale about 1877, early on in its developing years. He was a blacksmith, a trade that likely routed him to that area in the beginning. For a time he worked his trade for the HCMC. Later, about 1880 he acquired the Burnett House, one of the earliest hotels in Glendale, did some refurbishing to his liking and reopened it as the Avery Block of Glendale. Also, it contained some office space on the second floor which for several years was the focus of considerable law and order of the town while he served as Justice of the Peace. An advertisement in the Butte Miner newspaper, lists the Avery House as, “…having rooms that are refitted, and newly furnished throughout. A fine bar is connected\", and Mr. D.H. Simmons is listed as presiding over the culinary department and J.H. Bulger is the clerk. In 1882 Henry Avery married Emma in 1882, but the marriage ended in divorce on October 14, 1884. Then on April 27, 1885 he was wed to Catherine M. Christianson, former wife of John T. Longley. Catherine and Longley had six children at the time they divorced. [see Longley biography] The marriage of Catherine and Henry Avery was conducted at the ME Church in Glendale, Pastor H. J. Norris officiating. The Avery House appeared in every sense, to have been a successful enterprise but met with disaster during the early morning hours of March 16, 1886. The alarm was sounded and to the many who would arise to its call at about 3 o’clock in the morning, were to witness the Avery House being completely destroyed. It is believed that the fire started in an annex building that was used for wood storage. The loss was total. Reportedly, it was insured for $7000, while the loss was estimated at $10,000. It was tagged as the largest conflagration that had yet occurred in Glendale. History would show in the future, it was not the last. Avery soon thereafter sold his lots to the HCMC, indirectly, and moved on through the mining districts of North Idaho, and ended up in Spokane, Washington Territory. In 1887 he was noted “jobbing and retailing wines, cigars and smokers’ sundries on Riverside Avenue, Spokane Falls, W.T.\n\n​\n\nBanning, Abraham Sampson\n\nBanning, Vilas (Son).:\n\nBIRTH 25 DECEMBER 1848 • Iowa\n\nDEATH 25 JUL 1933 • Dillon, Montana\n\n​\n\nBirth of son Vilas S Banning(1894–1973)\n\n2 Oct 1894 • Hecla, Beaverhead Co., Mt\n\n​\n\nResidence\n\n1894: Likely in the employ of the Hecla Consolidated Mining Co at Hecla, Montana.

By July 1877 he is noted as the superintendent of mines for the Hecla Consolidated Mining Company on Trapper Creek. Sometime shortly hereafter, he was wed, however records of that occasion have proven evasive. The US Census for Hecla, Montana Territory, shows he is married, an engineer with the mining company and from Connecticut. Sam became father of a daughter Helen in 1882, who was born in Illinois. He remained a faithful stalwart for the HCMC for more than twenty years and should in all likelihood receive much more credit for the tremendous successes of the mines that produced the mega millions for the stockholders of the HCMC. He remained on into the early 1900’s with the company, then by January of 1920 he is residing with his daughter and son-in-law at Jerome, Arizona.\n\nBaril, Antoine:\n\nBaril, Odile (Chartier):\n\nAntoine Baril was an honored and successful ranch man in Madison County. He played well his part in connection with the industrial development and progress of our great state. He came from Canadian French lineage and was born December 31, 1836, in the Province of Quebec, Canada, where the original ancestor (Jean) emigrated from France about 1670. Antoine was fourth of eight children. He attended school in his native province and aided in the work of the home on the homestead farm. He resided in Canada until 1850, then came to the US, locating in Minnesota and later taking up a claim in that state. He developed and improved his farm for four years.\n\nIn 1863 he married Odile Chartier, daughter of Charles Chartier, a Chippewa Indian, and Appoline De Bussat dit St. Germain. In 1864 they started for Montana, leaving Little Falls, Minnesota on the 8th of March. They were members of the Rockwell party which made the trip across the plains with a train of fifty wagons by way of the Bozeman Cut Off and they arrived in Virginia City on August 15, 1864.\n\nAntoine gave his attention to mining for two years, then in 1866 took up a homestead on land near the present town of Laurin, Montana. He began farming but ravages of grasshoppers caused him to abandon that location and he then went down Ruby Valley and purchased a farm which he cultivated for three years. He moved his family to Oregon, but the climate proved injurious to his health, so they returned to Montana and in 1883 purchased a ranch of 247 acres of fertile land, located three miles southwest of Sheridan in the Duncan District. He raised excellent crops and kept a small herd of high grade cattle and thoroughbred buggy horses.\n\nIn politics he gave his allegiance to the Democratic party and his religion was that of the Catholic church in which he was born and reared.\n\nAntoine and Odile raised five children: Caroline, born February 11, 1868; Francis Xavier Joseph (Frank), October 16, 1869; Remi J. 1872; Charles Amos, 1874; Mary Alice (May), March 22,1880.\n\nAntoine and Odile are buried at the cemetery in Laurin, Montana. Antoine died in 1919 and Odile in 1890.\n\n​\n\nBaril, Caroline:\n\nCaroline is the first born child of Antoine and Odile (Chartier) Baril, who settled in the Ruby Valley of Madison County in 1863. She was born near Sheridan, M.T. on February 11, 1868. In 1890 she married Edward DeCelles and together they had eight children. She passed on at the home of a daughter Mrs. Kelly in Dillon, Montana on November 18, 1953.\n\n​\n\nBateman, James C.:\n\nJames Bateman was born about 1845 in Minnesota. He was at Glendale, M.T. by the late 1870’s where he was engaged as a teamster hauling high grade from the Trapper Creek mines to the smelter at Glendale. On December 18, 1878 he and Adelia Deno, who was first married to George Forrest, then divorced, were married at Glendale. His new wife had two children at the time, another would come to this union in July 1882 when Elmer joined them. George Bateman served as constable of the county for several years. Sometime later on the Batemans took up farming below Glendale and were still at it when George passed away on August 10, 1905. On April 1, 1926, Adelia Bateman passed away in Boulder, Montana at the home of her daughter, Lila M. Pfaff. Both James and Adelia Bateman are interred in the Melrose Cemetery.\n\n1877 Mar 28 - an indenture is recorded in Territorial Land Record Books, to wit: James C. Bateman to Joseph C.

In personal interviews with Paul, he welcomed the interest of others with common interests to share his story.]\n\nMelrose has been called home for the Boetticher’s for almost the whole century. Otto Bootlicker (nicknamed “OB”) was a nephew of Henry Knippenberg who was the general manager of the Hecla Mining and Banking business as well as the smelter operation.\n\nThe brick building was known as the company store also housed the bank. Otto as a young man of 14 years, came from Indianapolis, Indiana and went to work in the store and banking business in Glendale and then Melrose. He was the proud owner of the first bicycle, a high wheeler.\n\nOtto married Ella Bateman in 1898 and the first child Frances, was born in Glendale. The rest of the ten children, Julia, Carl, Otto Jr., Paul, Gladys, Keith, Mabel, Eleanor and William were born in Melrose with Dr. Moeller as the only doctor in the area and Mrs. Andy Thompson as the midwife. (Mrs. Thompson is the mother of Bertha Streb.)\n\nThe company built two homes in Melrose, one was on the site where the Lively’s place of business now occupies and the other was just east of there, across the Connor drain ditch. This was the home of the Boetticher’s while all the children grew up. The Ed Harvey’s occupied the other home for a number of years.\n\nThe Bateman family came from Minnesota and worked for the Company in Glendale and owned the farm east of Glendale later known as the Swofford place. After the Company ceased operations the Bateman’s went to Alberta, Canada where they homesteaded and the generations that followed are still large farmers in southern Alberta around High River.\n\nWhen Glendale and Hecla curtailed their operations the bank at Melrose also ceased to exist. Otto B. along with E. H. Sappington formed a partnership and continued to operate the general store dealing in hardware, dry goods, and groceries. This continued until Mr. Sappington died when OB took over the operation of the business.\n\nTom Williams was the bookkeeper for a number of years, he being the brother of Mrs. Sappington. Williams family moved to Oregon and went into feed business with the Horace Hand family and later returned to Melrose and purchased the farm where Lars Kalsta now owns the farm.\n\nAfter most of the Boettichers had grown up and moved away they moved in the home where Togo and his family lived which was the old Robert Bateman cabin. Togo had built onto it and the old “Iron Jail” that set out back of the lot was made into a cellar and I think is still there. This home is the present home of Jim Donegan.\n\nThe great depression years forced OB to give up the company store but he continued in a small way to operate a store until a few years before he passed away in 1952. He served the community as their postmaster for several years after Emma Wells died.\n\nEmma Wells had the post office located just east of the railroad section house and next to the old Catholic Church which was then a log building that was moved just west of the Ried and Dutch grocery store. She was the postmistress for as long as we could remember before she died. We can’t remember if there ever was another postmaster in Melrose. I think Mrs. Pond had the post office or a short time before OB was appointed. Mr. Pond (Elmer) had the saloon now occupied by the DeLeons.\n\nThe Boetticher family consisted of ten children, five boys and five girls. Five had blue eyes and five had brown eyes! All the children went through the elementary school and several attended the two year high school. The high school was one room, with one teacher teaching all subjects.\n\nJulia Boetticher attended a beauty school and moved to Deer Lodge where she married Joe Henault, later moving to Marysville, Washington where their family still resides.\n\nCarl was operating a hard tired truck hauling slag and ore from Glendale when he was stricken with appendicitis and died at the age of twenty one.\n\nOtto Jr. (better known as “ToGo”) made his home in Melrose and married Isabel Connor. Their two children Lillian and Carl made up their family. Lillian Winslow and their eight girls of Whitehall now live in Missoula. Carl and his family live in Arizona. He is with the Forest Service.\n\nTogo was a mine foreman at Maiden Rock for a number of years and was an ardent fisherman. He loved the old Big Hole and was among the first river floaters.\n\nPaul learned the telegraph shortly after completing high school in Butte. He operated an ice cream parlor in the company store building where the bank was located for two summers while attending high school. His telegraph instructor was W. Q. Kearns, a long time railroad agent and farther of Jack Kearns. Paul is now retired and lives in Dillon where he works part time for the D I hardware. Their family consisted of two boys and one girl. Gladys attended the State Normal College then married a Navy man and now lives in Monterey, Calif. She has one girl and one boy.\n\nKeith - nicknamed Cooney because of his southern drawl when a boy that stuck. Married a Jackson girl and operated a business in Jackson. He served in the navy during WWII. He passed away a number of years ago.\n\nMabel - while attending school in Dillon married Frank Little. They have a fine family and now live in their retirement at Big Fork.\n\nEleanor married Burl Stephens of Dillon and are owners of the Stephens Greenhouse. Frank and Burl Stephens still float the Big Hole river and still know it’s the best stream in the State!\n\nWilliam D. - always been called Bill, after graduation from law school in Missoula and a year teaching at Dutton, Montana and service as assistant county attorney in Kalispell, then became connected with the National Labor Relations Board. (NLRB) He lived in Chicago several years before going to Washington DC and has his home in Rockville, Maryland where he is retired. His wife is a lawyer with the Labor department. They have two girls and a boy.\n\nOtto Boetticher was active in community affairs serving a number of terms as school trustee. He served as postmaster for several years and was the notary public for the community for a number of years. During the depression years there was no such thing as “welfare” so the storekeeper carried everyone on the books. The result was the curtailment of the grocery business. The Lee Wilhelm family was one of them and in later years came to Dad and said he wanted to make things right. He paid Dad every dime he owed - something that is rare in any business, especially when the business no longer exists.\n\nElla Bateman Boetticher was always busy in the community. She served in any capacity she was asked, whether ladies aide, Rebeccah’s, school clerk, Sunday School teacher, organist, superintendant. Because of her dedication in the Presbyterian church she was made an Elder which is rare in that church for a woman. She passed away at age 96 in Dillon, Montana in 1979.\n\nAfter the smelter shut down the Knippenberg family moved back to Indianapolis. Henry Knippenberger’s sister, Elizabeth K. Boetticher who came to Melrose with her son Otto made her home with the Boettichers. A two room addition was built to accommodate her by her brother Henry. She lived to be ninety three.\n\nThe Ed and Charley Harvey’s who married two Boetticher sisters were also early settlers in Glendale, Hecla and Melrose. Ed Harvey operated the store in Wise River and had his store washed down the river at the time of the big flood when the dam broke on the Wise Rive. He later built the store where it now stands and is the father of Louise Jones whose son now operates the farm. Louise is the only survivor of that family.\n\nThe Charles Harvey family moved to Butte and son Wallace, of Great Falls is the only survivor of the family.\n\nThis synopsis was written from memory by me, Paul Boetticher, who has a soft spot in his heart for Melrose and the people who live there or have lived there.\n\nEspecially remembering the many families such as Hoffman, Ried, Young, Verbance, Connor, Pat and Jack Smith, Kambich, Grose Swofford, Molleurs, Vance, Little, Slater, Olson, Norris, Wombacher, Gordon, Streb, Sappington, Pond, Sam Arbour, Geo Conway, Dodson, Buyan, Eighhorn, McMurrin, McIvors, Grant, Jones, Kearns, LaMarche, Wilhelm, Moore, DeLeons, Donegan, Hager, Hand, Lively, Pendergast, Rieber, Tate, and many more I don’t recall. Melrose was one big happy family wit many community functions to help bring families together.\n\nI feel I have been blessed for having been born and reared in Melrose and I have been doubly blessed for the parents I was privileged having while in Melrose and the wonderful help-mate, my wife has been for the past forty\n\none years. My wife Verla was a Malad, Idaho girl whose parents came to Dillon and purchased the Schuler Ranch next to the Meine ranch on the Anderson lane. I dry farmed with my father in law on the east bench being the first to try it after the dry farming disaster in the early 1920’s when the dry years broke just about everyone who tried it. In the ten years we farmed it before the east bench irrigation project came in to being we never had a crop failure.\n\nI am proud that I am a Melrose native and am sorry I can’t be with you for your 100 year celebration. My wife and I having made reservations several months ago to go to Europe to visit our son Rick and his family who are stationed there in the service. We will be thinking of you!\n\n​\n\nBoetticher, Otto:\n\nBoetticher,Ella: (Bateman) OttoEllaGladysKeith Paul, Carl & Otto Jr.\n\nFran & Julia\n\nOttomer Julius Boetticher was born February 6, 1872 in Indianapolis, Indiana, a nephew of Henry Knippenberg, and came to Glendale in 1888 with his mother Mrs. Elizabeth (Knippenberg) Boetticher. He worked for Uncle Henry in the banking and mercantile business. Otto married Ella Myrtle Bateman, daughter of Henry Bateman who owned a ranch near Glendale, and worked for the HCMC until the silver market crash, and then moved to Alberta, Canada. The Otto and Ella Boetticher family moved down to Melrose, where there family grew to ten children. There, they operated a grocery store.

His parents emigrated to America in 1848 and settled in Connecticut. In 1859 they removed to New Britian, that State where the father died in William's eighteenth year, and where the mother still lives, she having reached the advanced age of eighty.\n\nWilliam Bowe spent several years of his early life at Cromwell, on the Connecticut river. When he was only fourteen he was employed to run an engine in a manufacturing establishment, and after the family moved to New Britain he worked on a farm for some time. In 1863 he went to Denver, Colorado, spent the winter there, and in the spring came to Montana, arriving at Virginia City, July 8, 1864, with a capital of $100. The history of his life for the next few years was that of a miner going from camp to camp, sometimes owning an interest in a mine himself and at other times working by the day until he had visited nearly all the mining districts in this section of the Northwest, and on the whole his mining career was an unsuccessful one. He then turned his attention to freighting, which he continued until the fall of 1873, when he came to his present location at Melrose. In the spring of 1875, he bought out two squatters, giving one of them $100 and the other $150. At that time there were only two other settlers in the valley, John Stone and Jefferson McCauley. When the land was surveyed Mr. Bowe pre-empted 160 acres of land, to which he subsequently added eighty acres of desert land. In the fall of 1875 he built a small log house which served for a home until he could get a better one. Finally he purchased a house at Rocker, took it to pieces and moved it to his place, and this house now forms a part of the hotel building. He has kept hotel here since 1876, it being the stage station until the railroad was built. With the coming of the railroad he platted the town of Melrose and at once sold off a number of lots. Much of the town, however, he still owns. In 1880 he made further additions to his hotel, which has since enabled him to entertain comfortable all who stop here.\n\nOn December 25, 1876, Mr. Bowe married Mrs. Lucina Fleser, widow of Adam Fleser and daughter of Elihu Phillips. She was born in Strongsville, Ohio, February 16, 1837. By her first husband she had the following children: George E., Melrose; Charles A., Melrose; Calista I., wife of James Mackboy, Phillipsburg; and Rose A., wife of Sherman W. Vance. Mr. Vance and his family reside with Mr. Bowe. Mrs. Bowe crossed the plains with her first husband in 1864, and on that journey met with many thrilling experiences and narrow escapes, a detailed account of which would fill a volume of no small proportion and would be more thrilling than many a romance. The company withy which they traveled was composed of twenty men, four women and five children, all well armed. At the South Platte river they were delayed on account of storms and high water. One man was drowned and one man and a child were killed by lightning. Further on in the journey they had trouble with the Indians, and it was with difficulty that they escaped with their lives. Mrs. Bowe is the daughter of a physician and by her knowledge of curative powers made herself very useful in taking care of the sick and wounded on this journey, as she also has during her long residence in Montana. After their arrival in Virginia City, Mr. Fleser engaged in mining, and later moved to German Gulch, where he kept a station. On account of his dissipated habits she left him and obtained a divorce, after which, as above stated, she became the wife of Mr. Bowe. During their long residence at Melrose, Mr and Mrs Bowe have made a wide acquaintance throughout the State, being noted far and near for their genial hospitality.\"\n\n​\n\nBrown, Henry W.: Photographer:\n\nHenry William Brown was born on July 17, 1851 in Canada. His parents originally were from Ireland. Brown left home in 1865, a lad of fourteen. By the age of eighteen, he had moved to Montana. From there he joined the Cariboo Gold rush in the Bonanza Claims in Northern British Columbia, Canada, and the Yukon during the 1870’s. While in the Yukon, Brown met and married his wife Anna. From there Brown returned to Montana settling in the Glendale, Montana Territory region and took up the photography business. He became very proficient in doing portraits as well as city, mining and landscape pictures. Some early copies of his work show he traveled to Bannack and did some photography there as well. After leaving Glendale, Brown was at Helena for a spell and then homesteaded on the West coast near Drayton Harbor and Blaine, Washington. Henry and Anna were blessed with four sons: Byron, Ferdinand, Randolph and Lincoln. Then in 1903 the Browns settled in Custer, Whatcom County, Washington, where Henry continued with his photo profession while maintaining a dairy farm, several mills and logging operations. It is said at one time Brown had 11 shake mills at Custer. Henry Brown died on April 19, 1935 and is buried in Enterprise Cemetery, near Ferndale, Washington.\n\nBrowne, Joseph A.: Joseph Agnes Joseph Agnes\n\nJoseph A. Browne, a respected Montana pioneer of 1862, and now prominent citizen of Beaverhead County, is a native of Washington County, Pennsylvania, born August 1, 1831. His grandfather, Michael Browne, was born, reared and married on the Emerald Isle; immigrated to America before the Revolution and settled in Washington County, Pennsylvania where he engaged in farming and where he raised his family of eleven children. He and his good wife each lived to the advanced age of ninety-two years. They were devout Catholics.\n\nJoseph’s father Michael Browne, was born in Washington County, Pennsylvania in 1793. He married Elizabeth Doherty, a native of the state of Maryland and a decendant of Irish ancestry. He remained at the old homestead, later came into possession of other lands there and until late in life continued to reside in Washington county. In 1879, Michael Browne joined his son in Montana to spend his remaining years, and it was there that he passed away after an active and useful life. His good wife and died in Pennsylvania in 1851. Both were faithfull members of the Catholic Church.\n\nJoseph A. Browne was the third born in his family. He was reared on the farm and received his early education in the public schools. When he was eighteen he was sent to St. Francis College in Cambria county, Pennsylvania, and after leaving college his first work was that of bookkeeper at Wheeling, West Virginia. Then returned to his father’s home for a short visit, and on the 14th of March, 1859, started for Pike’s Peak, to which place he journeyed with ox teams and in company with fifty others. After arriving in Colorado, he prospected, until his means were exhausted, where he worked in the placer mines at two dollars per day.\n\nIn the fall of 1859 he went to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he spent the winter, returning in the spring to Colorado. There, he failed to secure a good claim and that same summer went back to New Mexico, where he also met with failure in his prospecting. Yet, again he returned to Colorado. He mined for wages and prospected in Colorado until in 1862, when hearing of the discovery at the Salmon River, he and his partners, W D Bender and Edward Brown, came hither. At Bannack they secured a claim which they worked until the following spring, taking out about eight thousand dollars. In one single day they took our a hundred and twenty five dollars. Some of the specimens they secured there at that time, they had on exhibit at the World’s Fair in Chicago. As the diggings were some distance from the water, they sacked the dirt, put the sacks on an ox hide and drug it down the steep bank to the wash. Mr. Browne got the credit for starting the first “Bull Hide” express! Many other miners adopted his plan and soon all the dirt was sent down the hill the same way.\n\nFrom Bannack, Mr. Browne went to Argenta, and in June of 1864, located the first silver claim at that place. In the winter of 64-65 he sold a half interest in his claim to Governor S T Hauser for two thousand dollars in currency, but took one thousand in gold dust. At Ophir gulch, in Deer Lodge County, he found a valuable claim, where he and his partner mined during the spring and summer, realizing about ten thousand dollars. This\n\nplace they called Nugget Gulch, on account of the many large pieces of gold they found there, one piece being valued at ninety dollars. After supposing that it was exhausted he sold out for five hundred dollars. He then returned to his old home in Pennsylvania, going by way of California and from San Francisco making the journey by water. After an absence of six months he returned to Montana, via St. Louis and the Missouri River, continued prospecting until 1870. After Mr. Browne sold his silver mines to Sam Hauser, Sam went east and formed the first Eastern syndicate for the purpose of smelting and refining ore.\n\nIn 1870, Joseph Browne purchased the Big Hole toll road and bridge, which he as since operated. He has also acquired a large ranch of over three thousand acres, and has become one of the successful and prominent stock raisers of his section. His cattle are a high grade of Durhams and he breeds both Morgan and Clyde horses. Besides this he still continues his interests in mining, being the owner of the Faithful silver mine located in the Vipond district near Ponson bay. This is considered a very valuable mine.\n\nJoseph Browne was married to Miss Agnes M. Murray, a native of Pittsburg, daughter of Bartholomew and Ellen Murray of Pennsylvania, on April 9, 1872. They had an interesting family of four children; Mary E.; Joseph A.; Fanny T. and Francis V., and their commodious and attractive home is located in a romantic spot near the river bridge. It is here, that Mr. Browne is “monarch of all he surveys.” He has always affiliated with the Democratic Party and has frequently been honored by his party with positions of prominence and trust. In 1869 and 1872 he was elected and served as a representative to the Territorial Assembly, and has also served in the extra session. In 1881 he was elected a member of the Montana Council. While a member of that body he served on a number of important committees and rendered valued service by aiding in procuring the passage of the bill which removed the county seat form Bannack to Dillon, the later place being in the center of the county and a railroad town. In 1884 he was elected a member of the territorial Convention and was one of a committee of three to carry its proceeding to Washington, the other two gentlemen being J. K. Toole and W. A. Clark. When S. T. Hauser became the governor of the Territory, he chose Mr. Browne for one of his staff. Governor Leslie also honored him with a similar appointment, with the commission of Inspector General of the National Guards of Montana. Governor’s White and Toole also honored him by appointing him to the same position.\n\nDuring the earlier history of the Territory, Joseph Browne was a member of the Vigilant Committee. Notwithstanding the varied experiences through which he has passed in the early settlement and development of the Territory, Mr. Browne is still a well preserved man and it is hoped by his hosts of finds that he may live long to enjoy the prosperity which his intelligent and persistent efforts have made.\n\n[NOTE: Bio on page 123 of the Bvhd.

(1988)]\n\nIn 1907, Anton and Anna Buyan and their five children; Mary, Ann, Angela, Amelia (Molly) and Joe moved to Glen just south of Melrose, Montana where they purchased a ranch. In the years following, two more sons; Frank and Bill, and another daughter; Katherine (Kate) were born into the family. They continued to live at Glen until 1930 when the three boys and their parents moved into Melrose, buying a ranch from Charles Niblack.\n\nIn the meantime all five girls married and moved away. Ann married Rudy Fink and moved to Anaconda; Mary married John Norton of Helena and moved to Anaconda also; Amelia (Molly) married Frank Kambich and stayed at Glen; Angela married Lawrence Gerrety of Melrose and moved to Silver Bow; Kate married Pete Stefanac of Butte and moved there. Presently, all the girls are widowed with Ann and Mary still in Anaconda, Angela and Kate are in Butte, and Molly along with here twin sons, Frank and Tom are still on their ranch at Glen.\n\nAnna passed away in June of 1939. Anton and he boys continued to run the ranch. Frank served as Deputy Sheriff in Melrose for several years and was instrumental in bringing the REA (Rural Electrification Association) into the community. In 1941 Frank enlisted in the Armed Forces. He was taken prisoner by the Japanese and marched in the Bataan Death March. He died on July 1, 1942 while being held captive in a prison camp. During his active duty he earned the Purple Heart distinction of Honor.\n\nBill also joined the Armed Forces and was stationed primarily in Japan. Upon his return he worked around the state on several ranches. Later he bought his own ranch at Cliff Lake and soon later married Leona George of Waterloo. Their ranch was located just 3 miles from the Quake Lake area so they saw some real excitement the night the mountain fell! To this union two sons, Bill Jr. and Guy were born to help carry on the Buyan family name. They later settled at a ranch close to Sheridan, Montana, where Lena and the boys still reside. Bill, Sr. passed away on May 27, 1877.\n\nJoe married Helen MacMillan of Harrison, Montana on May 2, 1942. She had come to the Melrose community in the fall of 1940 to work at the Sail Inn café, owned by her aunt and Uncle John and Mae McIvor. They had two children, Robert and Lynn. The family continued to operate the ranch a half mile north of Melrose on the Big Hole River until January of 1966. The ranch is now owned by the George Franke family. Grampa Tony lived with them at the ranch until his death on September 10, 1961, at the ripe old age of ninety seven years. The family often still laughs while reminiscing the years while Grampa was still with us. Being a native of Austria, he learned to speak the English language (however broken), but never mastered reading or writing of English. Coming to America as a young boy, his lifetime proved to be a wealth of startling innovations; cars, diesel trains, jet planes, the radio, television, electricity, and the telephone, just to name a few. Whenever anyone called long distance he couldn’t understand “how that telephone line reach that far?” It took quite some convincing that the light in the refrigerator actually did go out when the door was shut. He was just sure that the light was on all the time and that it was running up the electricity bill! Many of his hours were spent in his favorite spot beside the old coal and wood stove. So when the new electric stove was installed, it was a real shock to him not to have his nice warm spot.\n\nWhile living in Melrose, Joe and Helen were very active in community activities. Joe served on the school board and the Vipond Stock Association, and was instrumental in organizing an active Volunteer Fire Department in May of 1955 serving as fire chief for eleven years. He recalls the Railroad Company selling the old depot to the firemen for the grand total of one dollar with the stipulation that the building be moved off railroad property. The building was moved and renovated and still serves as the fire hall in its present location. The only drawback of this transaction was that the men of the community no longer being able to “shoot the bull” around the pot belly stove at the old depot.\n\nHelen was active in both the women’s and Mothers Clubs. Together Joe and Helen were charter members of the Melrose Grange organization. Lynn was very active in the Melrose 4-H club.\n\nIn September of 1964 Bob enlisted in the US Marine Corps and served in Viet Nam. By the time he returned in 1967, the family had moved to Dillon. He is the father of two girls, Candi and Tami. He is now in Dillon as are Joe and Helen.\n\nLynn graduated from MSU at Bozeman in 1971 and went on to Peoria, Illinois to do her year’s internship in medical technology. For the past eight years she has lived in Great Falls, working at Columbus Hospital as a microbiologist.\n\nThe Buyans still enjoy visiting friends in Melrose even though many of the “old timers” no longer reside there. May this celebration be the perfect time for reminiscing old times, rekindling of old friendships and the start of many more to come.\n\nCanovan, John:\n\nCanovan, Ellen (first wife of John):\n\nCanovan, Mary A.(Wintemantel, second wife of John):\n\nJohn Canovan, with name spelled variously as Conavan or Canavan, was born in the Dubuque, Iowa area about 1841, to Martin Canovan and mother is unknown to us at this time.
