        "text": "Good morning, troops. It's Thursday, Jan. 26.\n\nIt's also the 99th anniversary of the birth of renowned science-fiction author Philip Jose Farmer, yet another Peorian who made an impression well beyond city boundaries. And well beyond the boundaries of science fiction, in some ways.\n\nFarmer, who died in 2009 at 91, wrote more than 75 books and numerous short stories. He won three Hugo Awards, science fiction's highest honor.\n\nOne of those awards came for the Bradley University graduate's first notable work, \"The Lovers.\" Published in 1952, the novella might have been the first to depict a sexual relationship between a human and an extraterrestrial.\n\nFarmer went on to write the acclaimed \"Riverworld\" series. In its obituary about Farmer, The New York Times described the series thus:\n\n\"Mr. Farmer imagined a river millions of miles long on a distant planet where virtually everyone who has died on Earth is physically reborn, strong and vital, and given a second chance to make something of life.\"\n\nThe first Riverworld book, \"To Your Scattered Bodies Go,\" published in 1971, won Farmer a Hugo. Another came in 1967 for the novella \"Riders of the Purple Wage,\" a satire on the cradle-to-grave welfare state.\n\nOther noteworthy Farmer works included \"Nothing Burns in Hell,\" \"Naked Came The Farmer\" and \"Venus on the Half-Shell.\" That last piece was published in 1975 under the pen name \"Kilgore Trout,\" a character that appeared in several Kurt Vonnegut novels.\n\nFarmer obtained permission from Vonnegut to write the book. But legend has it Vonnegut was not happy when some reviewers concluded he had written it, and that it was a worthy addition to his collection.\n\nUnlike others of national and international note who were from Peoria, Farmer lived here most of his life. Much of it was spent with his late wife, Bette, in their house on Briarwood Lane, just west of Donovan Park, near Northmoor and Sheridan roads.\n\nMuch of that time he spent unnoticed among the locals, except for occasional letters to the Journal Star editorial page. In those, Farmer often showed his wit and creativity.\n\n\"Bill Clinton and Hillary remind me of Dagwood and Blondie,\" a 1995 letter stated. \"I no longer have to wait until 10 p.m. to watch 'Beavis and Butthead' because Dole and Gingrich are often together on prime time.\"\n\nFarmer also defended his hometown against pot-shots from know-nothing outsiders: \"Some of the finest people I know (and some of the rottenest and most ignorant) live in Peoria. And some of the wildest, most flamboyant and intelligent live in this area.\"\n\nAll of it seemed typical for someone former Journal Star critic Jerry Klein called one of the most humble people he knew.\n\n\"He wasn't exactly celebrated in Peoria, like the prophet being without honor in his own country,\" Klein told the newspaper not long after Farmer's death.\n\nPerhaps all the acclaim Farmer received elsewhere more than made up for the normality of life in his hometown.\n\n\"I am obscure in Peoria,\" he told The Associated Press in 1988. \"I guess they don't read much around here.\"\n\nBut we do listen to the radio on the way into work, and this was among what we heard. Wonder what Farmer would have made of Thomas Dolby."
