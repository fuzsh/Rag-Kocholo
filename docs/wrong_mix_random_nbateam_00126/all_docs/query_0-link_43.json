Several trees have Florence born 20th May 1866 at John's Creek, Dubguque County, Iowa. She then married firstly Marion Ault on 11th October 1894 in Barnesville, Belmont County, Ohio.

Florence died at North Wheeling Hospital, Wheeling, West Virginia on 23rd April 1949 and was buried on 26th April 1949 at Crestview Cemetery, Warren Township, Belmont County, Ohio.\n\nBe aware that there were two Marion Aults born in Ohio in 1852.

We were only a block from our house when we stopped at a market and persuaded the grocers wife to drive us home so we wouldnt meet any kidnappers. One day my first grade teacher, Miss Otwell, was very alarmed to notice the left side of my face was paralyzed.
