Last Friday, Erin Costelo released her new album Down Below, the Status Quo. The album was already out in Costelo’s native Canada, earning heaps of acclaim and a handful of award nominations, including wins for Producer of the Year and Solo Recording of the Year from Music Nova Scotia.

Down Below, the Status Quo follows Costelo’s 2013 album We Can Get Over. Costelo produced Down Below herself, with Thomas Stajcer engineering the tracks at Joel Plaskett’s New Scotland Yard Studio.

Costelo will hit the road on a co-headlining tour with Shannon McNally in Lexington, KY on March 21.

Down Below, the Status Quo is available now via Compass Records. Stream the album in its entirety below.
