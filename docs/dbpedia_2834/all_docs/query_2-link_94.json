        "text": "Post by snakelady on\n\nThe song is of its time, but I like it. Out of all of Quo's 80s albums I actually think AC is the best.\n\nSometimes when I'm in the mood I don't skip a single track.\n\nPost by I Ain't Complaining on\n\n@inna said:\n\nUp there with Address Book for you @inna ?\n\nNo, not at all, and no doubt about it, smokie .\n\nThere aren't (m)any Quo songs that could really exceed Address Book, IMO.\n\nI actually think Ain't Complaining is the best song on the album of the same name...\n\nbut as I don't care much for the album, this probably isn't much of a compliment, really, is it?\n\nAnd the way they look and move in that video...Charvel guitars or not... *cringe, groan, cringe, groan*.\n\nDuring the promotion of the In the Army, Ain't Complaining and Perfect Remedy albums, they were so poppy, so 80s; as un 'rock like' as they would get. I watched a few of the Army promotional playbacks the other day, and they're just as bad. That was obviously the way they decided to go after they reformed until Perfect Remedy was a flop and then RTYD started a change back to a slightly more rock style of music and clothes.\n\nPost by I Ain't Complaining on\n\nOf the poppy albums, Ain't Complaining is my favourite.\n\nI like the title track and the video with Griff Rhys Jones, it just doesn't look like Quo in the video above when they mime along to it. They had evolved sooo far from Paper Plane 16 years before!\n\nPost by Rick Roper on\n\nThe saying goes \"You can't polish a turd\"\n\nI thought the album was a turd back in 1988, and nothing's changed since then. Cringeworthy from start to finish.\n\nThe moves on stage look like a thinly-veiled attempt to be cool, in the days when a new image was being projected (unsuccessfully).\n\nThis album, and the one after it were, in my humble opinion, the worst in Status Quo's career, at the time*.\n\n* Although they get a run for their money from \"In Search of...\" and \"The Party Ain't Over Yet\" which were almost equally diabolical.\n\nRick Roper.\n\nRick Roper.\n\nPost by mortified on\n\nBeen a long time since I saw that clip. Probably about 29½ years\n\nI really liked the title track when it was released as the single, especially the 12\" version. I think it was the first Quo CD single I ever bought as well. But the album which came along not long after was disappointing, although there was even worse to come. I know that Francis detests the album. I heard him say it in an interview a few years ago.\n\nAs for the video with Griff Rhys-Jones, I'm afraid I have to disagree with my learned colleague I Ain't Complaining. I think it's the worst they've ever made! By some distance.\n\nRick looks cool though.\n\nPost by johns on\n\nAlways liked Ain't Complainin' album and single. Much better than the Army album and full of cracking songs. Think they missed the boat though when they released Who Gets the Love as a single when the obvious one to release was I Know You're Leaving.\n\nPost by viking55 on\n\nTotally agree about ‘ I know your leaving’ it’s so obviously would have been stronger as a single. It’s got the Boy Band sound of the time !\n\nI sometimes wonder if it lost out due to Songwriting credits. Gentleman’s agreement for Pip Williams getting the nod. Never heard of the Songwriter for IKYL ??\n\nPost by mortified on\n\nI think I Know You're Leaving was released as a single in Holland. Mind you, I've never seen a copy so that might be incorrect. Just have a feeling I read it by someone somewhere in summertime.\n\nAnyone heard the Simple Minds acoustic album?\n\nPost by snakelady on\n\nGot to say I love Who Gets The Love and don't consider IKYL anything special - not bad either though, but not single material. Seems I'm in a minority with that.\n\nIt were the two Bridges songs that were the singles here if I remember correctly. I wasn't too keen on either. Favourites are probably Cream Of The Crop and Magic beside WGTL. Think with a different production/arrangement (?) both could be turned into driving rock songs.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nGot to say I love Who Gets The Love and don't consider IKYL anything special - not bad either though, but not single material. Seems I'm in a minority with that.\n\nNo yer not cos I think exactly the same as you stated above\n\nPost by I Ain't Complaining on\n\nBeen a long time since I saw that clip.

It may be 80s, it may be a bit childish, but I like the humour in it. I think they evolved into a slightly more serious rock/pop band again a decade after that, but 30 years ago, that was who they had become.\n\nPost by mortified on\n\nBeen a long time since I saw that clip.

It's supposed to be funny but the humour seems to have passed me by\n\nMind you, compared to Bula Quo it's Blazing Saddles\n\nPost by The Lord Flasheart on\n\n@inna said:\n\nNow that makes two of you.\n\nI agree too, so at least three!\n\nDoes anyone know where I Know You're Leaving comes from....how they came to record the song?\n\nIt was written by a dutch duo en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluitsma_%26_Van_Tijn\n\nI think that maybe Quo went looking for another writing duo after the success of In The Army Now."
