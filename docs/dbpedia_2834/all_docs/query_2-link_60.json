Or listening to Status Quo. But what is that bizarre cover trying to tell us? And why is the edge of it burnt?? One thing that's noticeable when comparing to the previous album: Quo went back to 10 tracks to avoid any possibility of the LP over-running again.\n\nAt this point, various forces started to pull into different directions. Francis started working with Bernie Frost, though the Rossi/Young partnership wasn’t completely over yet. The new songs mostly weren’t in the Quo mould anymore; given that the Rossi/Young songs had often formed the bulk of Quo albums this was a problem. What do you do when the principal songwriter (and singer!) starts to drift off into a different direction?\n\nRick, in turns, formed a writing relationship with Andy Bown, who even brought in a solo song – not bad for a keyboard player that’s not even an official band member yet! Pip was still taking the management’s intention to get Quo a foothold in the US market seriously and thought adding female voices and horns plus running the whole LP through a device called “Aphex Aural Exciter” might do the trick. His co-write “Accident Prone” with its contemporary disco feel also might have been aimed at new fan bases.\n\nSomebody on a Quo forum suggested “If You Can’t Stand the Heat” might be Quo’s ‘sexy’ album, which makes sense when you think about it – right from the title to songs like “Gonna Teach You to Love Me” (obvious), “Someone Show Me Home” (about a prostitute, think “Roxanne”), “Long Legged Linda” (obvious again), “Oh! What a Night”, “Accident Prone” (about a woman who likes to run men over, metaphorically speaking) and “Like a Good Girl”, plus the backing vocalists (“Long-Legged! Liiindaa… Long Legged! Liiinndaa!”) and Francis’ overheated lead guitar.\n\nAgain and Again: An anthem to start things off. The sound is very “produced”, but also a lot fuller and heavier than anything from RAOTW. I’ve always liked “Again and Again”: Rick’s powerful voice, the half-time drum groove doubling up for the chorus, a funky clavinet adding to the rhythm guitar and Francis’ Chuck Berry solo with its sudden chord changes. People complain about its repetition but I think that its self-irony saves the song. It’s not called “Again and Again” for no reason, after all…\n\nI'm Giving Up My Worryin’: The Shape Of Quo To Come. And it’s a very sudden development, no doubt thanks to Francis forming a new writing partnership with Bernie Frost. The tune was supposedly influenced by The Eagles. Francis now admits that the song might not have been suited to Quo. I admit that I don’t care for it.\n\nGonna Teach You To Love Me: Oh, how very Alan Lancaster. Those lyrics! The tune is based around a blues progression and doesn’t really “take off” despite a nice solo. John Coghlan played some electronic drums here.\n\nSomeone Show Me Home: I think this is a good song (better than Francis’ first one on the LP), but also not really a good fit for Status Quo. It’s a ¾ waltz type ballad with organ and layers of vocal harmonies. At the time, Genesis started splitting their work between solo projects and group collaborations. Maybe this should have been the way for Quo as well? Interestingly enough, Francis later re-recorded the track for his 1st solo album.\n\nLong Legged Linda: This is one of the more controversial Quo songs, with some people loving it and some absolutely hating it. Given that Andy wrote it all alone (not with Rick as the original LP suggested) it’s no surprise that it’s full of keyboards. This, along with the horns and backing vocals, makes it feel very “crowded” and overproduced. But I like it, sort of. After all, it’s only the second song that really rocks, and we’re already five songs in!\n\nOh! What a Night: Probably the most Quo-typical song up till now with its relentless shuffle, but the female backing singers add a different flavour. The intro sounds like a precursor to “Whatever You Want” with its Drop-D-Tuning. IMO, this is one of the few real highlights on the LP.\n\nAccident Prone: I guess I would also call this a highlight, though I can see why its single release didn't set the world on fire. Like the previous Williams/Hutchins contribution it has some interesting chord changes and a good catchy chorus, but the disco-ish hi-hat groove is very unusual for Quo at the time. What really makes this a standout track for me is Francis’ absolutely furious guitar tone. Unbelievable!\n\nStones: Here we really enter the problem zone, because the writers in Quo were starting to fret about each getting enough songs on the record. And in this case, Alan wrestled a song through that nobody else liked – Rick, Francis, John Coghlan. He did re-write it (originally a shuffle or a hard rock thing) but even then it’s not a high point of Quo’s career. That three-chord sequence is just too simple for Quo!! The chorus is sort of dumb and catchy though.\n\nLet Me Fly: Similar problem, Rossi calls it “Don’t Waste My Time MK 7” and the chorus is kinda blah-blah-blah. At least we have the “Case Of The Missing Intro”, the horns and some nice guitar things to keep this shuffle interesting. Is this Quo by numbers?\n\nLike a Good Girl: The only Rossi-Young song closes the album and it’s quite good: Fast-paced and bouncy. But it doesn’t quite stack up when compared to the album closers of years before. (According to Francis, the lyric was inspired by a Burton Cummings song which he didn't recall the title of… “…but it was ****ing naughty, believe me”!)\n\nI can see why many fans were shocked when the album was released – I'm not particularly crazy about it either. But it flows quite well and even the weaker tracks are still relatively listenable. The attempts at breaking the US market do shine through and somewhat compromise the typical Quo sound.\n\nAt first glance, 12 bonus tracks isn't too shabby for a bonus disc, particularly since the 2005 remaster only had one bonus track. But if you look closely, you'll see that both discs would have fitted onto one CD! Given that the album could have been remixed to strip away some of the overproduction and the Aphex Aural Exciter, or that live tracks from the tour could have been presented here, that's pretty disappointing. Even more so since the remaster is more compressed than most of the others done by Andy Pearce. What’s also annoying is that the booklet doesn’t properly reproduce the LP cover, which would have been easy to do simply by flipping the front and back covers 90° and printing the gatefold on pages 2 and 3.\n\nThe sequence of disc 2 is somewhat messed up. Program your CD player to 1/2/3/5/4/7/6/9/8/11/10/12 for a better flow. First we get the single edit of \"Accident Prone\", then a bunch of demos from somewhere between 1978 and 1979...\n\nOne by One: A Parfitt/Young song that wouldn't be finished until 2007, when it appeared as a bonus track on \"In Search of the Fourth Chord\". The early demo has some singing that shows the lyrics were already mostly in place, but the instrumental band demo is vastly different from the final version - it's dramatic like Pink Floyd!\n\nNo Time Left to Cry / Another Game in Town: Apparently a Rossi/Young song, but it's quite close to \"Lies\" at one point. The writing demo doesn't contain any lyrics, just guitar and wordless singing. The band demo sounds pretty finished though (which would be typical of Francis' demos from this point on), it even has harmony vocals! Still, the band never recorded a \"proper\" studio version of it.\n\nKeep Me Guessing: A Parfitt/Rossi/Young song that eventually ended up on one of the \"In the Army Now\" era b-sides. The early version has a somewhat uncomfortable vocal arrangement; the band demo is in a different key and rocks quite hard (nothing against the '85 version, but this simply has more balls) but has no vocals. If you can sing like Rick (which I can), it's karaoke time! There's some fine slide guitar in the outro.\n\nLate Last Night: A Parfitt/Rossi/Young song that showed up again on Rick's (still) unreleased solo album; that version was then released on the \"In the Army Now\" 12\". Like \"Keep Me Guessing\", the early demo is basically a drum computer, guitar and two voices. While it's a relatively poppy song, the instrumental band demo has a charm of its own and gives the Chuck Berry-esque rhythm guitar lots of room.\n\nInvitation: This Rossi/Young song known from \"In the Army Now\" is the gem of the bonus disc for me. I'm not a big country music fan but I find both versions very charming in a \"Western hero half asleep at the bar in the saloon\" way. The later studio version sounds much too polished and shiny to me. Which is ironic considering that the arrangement is almost 100% identical, even the little guitar riffs here and there. Francis sure is a perfectionist.\n\nAgain and Again: Not so much a demo, but an excerpt from Rick's first attempt at singing the song (with a rough backing track) and stumbling over the lyrics. Including a typical Quo lyric change (\"clock\" becomes \"cock\" - see the bootleg index for more examples) and Rick calling Pip \"Pippo the Hippo\".

Pip was still there, but this time the band co-produced the album (and according to Pip they could have produced it just as well on their own). While the songs and arrangements were in the vein of the pre-RAOTW albums, there was still a lot of time spent on perfecting the sound, resulting in maybe the best sound the original line-up ever achieved. The efforts to break the US market weren’t put to rest, but this shouldn’t affect the album itself, since this time the band went to the USA to remix the album specifically for the demands of US radio. The re-ordered and re-titled “Now Hear This” (for those who still remembered “Pictures of Matchstick Men”?) didn't do much for the band either, though.\n\nIt’s been suggested that “Whatever You Want” (originally intended to be called “As It Happens” or “As It Was”, depending on the source) is a sort of concept album – what’s clear is that the band was starting to write about their problems, being worn out by constant touring, family/relationship issues, dealing with the critics, tax exile and the inner band conflicts.\n\nThere’s lots of self-references on the album, which is unusual for Quo up to that point (but would become a fixed part of future albums) – “Breaking Away” includes the line “Four rockers rollin’”, “Come Rock With Me” asks the question “Were you listening when I said I was giving up my worryin’” and “Who Asked You” says “There never was a better way”. The lyrical content also means that we have rock music about rock music, something that I find formulaic and boring when AC/DC do it but that sort of works when Quo do it. Then again, songs like “Rockin’ All Over the World” and “Again and Again” probably started that trend.\n\nThe cover seems to reflect the craziness of stardom and the whole media hype thing. After all, it’s just a penguin on the red carpet! Those penguins became a symbol for the era (single covers, music videos) and can also be found on DVD bootlegs or the YouTube channel “PenguinRockBarMusic”.\n\nThere was no tour for the album. At least there are demos, outtakes and the US remixes to fill the bonus disc, but… (see below)\n\nWhatever You Want: Quo’s business card if you like. Of the biggest, most well-known hits this is probably the most representative of Quo’s brand of rock: Intriguing intro leading into guitar riff leading into shuffle rhythm, featuring a catchy chorus but more than three chords (especially during the guitar solo) and a repetitive outro. Francis later said he knew the song would be a massive hit the first time he heard it and “why didn't I write it?” – well Rick and Andy wrote it!\n\nRemix: Not only is it no longer the opener, but it’s also gone through some changes. The slow intro is gone and another part of the song (second verse) is missing. Otherwise the guitars and bass have been somewhat toned down, whereas the vocals are more prominent with reverb effects and the keyboards seem to be higher in the mix. During the guitar solo, there are some additional lead bits and a piano I’ve never noticed on the original mix.\n\nShady Lady: A slice of very classic Quo, á la On the Level/Blue for You but with those high backing vocals that would become even more prominent on the next two albums. Thanks to the lyrics, we now know that Francis doesn’t like leg hair on women!\n\nRemix: See below.\n\nWho Asked You: One of the highlights, this rocking track was written by Alan (who seemingly recovered from his writing crisis) but sung by Francis. Alan now complains it should have been a single but wasn’t because he wrote it. I think that’s nonsense, probably more to do with the album already having two singles lifted from it.\n\nRemix: I don't think this song lost much by remixing. The voice stands out a bit more, but it still rocks!\n\nYour Smiling Face: Rick has more vocals and writing credits on this record than on the previous one. The song is basically about infidelity, but from the angle of realizing you’ve made a mistake. This was a pattern that came up every now and then in his personal life, from what I understand.\n\nRemix: See below.\n\nLiving on an Island: As a 2nd single this was a perfect choice because it showed a different side to Quo. It remains one of the most beautiful rock ballads from the 70s, a bittersweet song about isolation (literally, due to the tax exile status of the band) starting with just two acoustic guitars, tinkling electric piano and Rick singing as softly and sweetly as possible (a complete contrast to the previous track). The bridge and key change show what an amazing voice he had back then. After that, the song starts to build towards the more rocking ending, which was completed by Francis playing a repeating phrase on a guitar synth. Wonderful!\n\nRemix: Not bad, it’s an interesting alternative version although a bit shorter than the LP cut. While it sounds a bit overproduced at the beginning, I think I actually prefer the coda over the regular version – the organ comes through better, and the ending rocks!\n\nCome Rock With Me/Rockin’ On: Can’t really describe both songs separately, since they share not only the key but also lyrical motifs. “Come Rock With Me” is a somewhat stiff rock song with somewhat negative lyrics than then changes into a shuffle and becomes the happier “Rockin’ On”. The two main points are being worn out from the treadmill and proving one’s point: “They never thought we could be rockin’ on”. At the same time, there’s also still an element of fun in performing live. Francis said “You’re up, then you’re down. Things are never smooth.”\n\nRemix: Organ still buried deep in the mix, almost inaudible!\n\nRunaway: “It seemed like the logical way… at the time”. I know some people hate this song because it’s so poppy, but it’s hard for me to hate something that rocks with such vehemence and is so goddamn catchy! That metallic sound at the end is strange, is that another guitar synth?\n\nRemix: No big difference to my ears except that the US version has a longer fadeout.\n\nHigh Flyer: Unusual, a Lancaster/Young collaboration. While it’s not bad, it’s my least favourite song on the record. If I had to change something about the album, I'd swap this for “Bad Company”. The lyrics speak a lot about constantly touring and being at the mercy of the management.\n\nRemix: Similarly, this song is longer on the US remix – and it has an actual ending, unlike the regular mix, which just fades out!\n\nBreaking Away: The back-to-the-roots recipe also involved an epic closing track consisting of several different parts. “Breaking Away” has a sort of ABAC structure, starting with a vaguely funky guitar pattern that then moves into a fast rock part, then goes back to the beginning and ends in a haunting slow shuffle. The main part sung by Francis includes the remarkable chorus “But I'm changing my tune, aaaaah, and I'm breaking away”, whereas Rick’s part is almost a satire on the rock band lifestyle. There is also a reference to Bob Young (the poet in the wings) and his imminent departure from the Quo camp.\n\nRemix: Apart from a bit more reverb and Rick's vocal distorting I don't hear a lot of differences\n\nHard Ride: That riff is vaguely reminiscent of “Mystery Song”... it's an OK Lancaster song, actually one of their better b-sides IMO\n\nBad Company: Here’s a rarity! An actual (fully produced) outtake, not just a demo! This song was composed by Pip Williams on an 18-string guitar (!), but you might have guessed that from the unusual chords and harmonies. Actually, it’s a really great song that should have been released somewhere.\n\nShady Lady (Demo): Basically the finished song but with sketchy sound quality.\n\nRearrange (Demo): Here’s an unused song that was never properly recorded. It’s a typical mixture of country, blues ballad chord changes and a dose of melancholia.\n\nNow Hear This: The US remix sounds like it’s taken from vinyl, and there are even two tracks missing.\n\nLiving on an Island (Demo): The structure is there, the lyrics are not quite finished yet; it's also slower and sung in a lower key.\n\nLiving on an Island (Backing Track): Basically the finished version without vocals, electric guitar and synths. Apart from being significantly longer than all other versions, it offers the opportunity to hear the band's instrumental backdrop far more clearly. Andy especially shines with his beautiful electric piano and organ parts. Very nice."
