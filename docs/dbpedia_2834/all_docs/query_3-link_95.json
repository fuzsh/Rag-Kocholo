        "text": "Description\n\nThis article is from the Status Quo FAQ, by Mike Dimmick dimmicmj@aston.ac.uk with numerous contributions by others.\n\n2.b. Band history (Status Quo)\n\nThe band was formed originally in 1962 by Francis Rossi and\n\nAlan Lancaster, at their school in south-east London. They\n\nsoon joined up with a drummer, John Coghlan (please tell me\n\nI've spelt that right!). They rapidly went through a number\n\nof name changes, being first the Scorpions, then the Spectres.\n\nAs the Spectres, they were booked to do a holiday season in\n\n1965 at Butlins holiday camp in Minehead, Somerset, where they\n\nmet Rick Parfitt who was working with a cabaret act there. In\n\nlate '66, the Spectres were signed to the Piccadilly label,\n\nshortly before it was taken over by PYE.\n\nAfter several flopped single releases (available on the\n\ncompilation, B Sides and Rarities, and now on 'The Singles\n\nCollection 1966-73,' on the Castle Communications label, C/N\n\nCCS CD 821) they changed their name to Traffic, and then,\n\nafter Steve Winwood's Traffic had a hit single, to Traffic\n\nJam. They released another single, which was banned, and\n\ndecided that they needed another voice in the band. They\n\ninvited Rick Parfitt to join.\n\nShortly afterwards, in 1968 they changed their name to The\n\nStatus Quo and released a song that hit the UK charts at\n\nnumber seven: 'Pictures of Matchstick Men' (which was recently\n\ncovered by Ozzy Ozbourne for the film 'Private Parts'). Their\n\ndebut LP, 'Picturesque Matchstickable Messages from The Status\n\nQuo' was released later that year, and provided another hit,\n\n'Ice in the Sun,' as well as a number of other singles that\n\nflopped.\n\nTheir second LP, 'Spare Parts' was released the following\n\nyear, under the name of 'Status Quo', but it and the single\n\nfrom it, 'Are You Growing Tired Of My Love,' failed to go\n\nanywhere. The band decided on a change of direction and\n\nimage. Out went the Carnaby Street frilly shirts, and in came\n\nthe long hair, jeans, and heavy music, along with their heads\n\ndown style.\n\nIn 1970, now down to a four-man line up, after the original\n\nkeyboard player, Roy Lynes, had left, they released their\n\nthird album, 'Ma Kelly's Greasy Spoon,' and the single 'Down\n\nThe Dustpipe.' Dismissed on Radio 1 by Tony Blackburn, it\n\nnevertheless got to number 12. However, attitudes were\n\nbeginning to change, and John Peel played 'In My Chair' later\n\nthat year, which also hit. '71's single, 'Tune To The Music'\n\nflopped, however, and later in '71, they released what was to\n\nbe their final album on Pye, 'Dog of Two Head.'\n\nIn early '72, Quo left Pye and signed to Phonogram's rock\n\nsubsidiary, Vertigo. They took the daring step of producing\n\ntheir next album, 'Piledriver,' themselves, and it turned out\n\nas rough and ready as the title suggested. The single from\n\nthat album, 'Paper Plane,' hit number 8 in the UK chart. That\n\nsingle began a chain of hits that was almost unbroken until\n\n1985.\n\nIn January 1975, 'Down Down' became Quo's first UK number one.\n\nDepending on which chart you look at, it is still their only\n\none to date. If I remember correctly, Anniversary Waltz was\n\nnumber one in the Independent chart, but only got to number\n\ntwo in the BBC chart which most people consider 'official'.\n\nAndrew Bown, a former member of the Herd, joined the band in\n\nOctober 1976. The band remained in the same line-up until\n\n1981, when John Coghlan left after an argument in a recording\n\nstudio in Montreux, Switzerland. Quo were recording the album\n\nthat was to become '1+9+8+2,' the title implying both the year\n\nit was released and that it was the band's 20th anniversary.\n\nHe was replaced by Pete Kircher, who had been the drummer with\n\nthe Original Mirrors.\n\nLater in 1982, Quo were asked to kick off the Prince's Trust\n\nlaunch gig at the NEC in Birmingham. The recording of the\n\nconcert was later released as the album, 'Live at the NEC'.\n\nDue to disagreements within the band, they decided in 1984\n\nthat their next tour would be their last one, and titled it,\n\n'End of the Road.' Although they said that they would\n\ncontinue to record, it became the end of the road for Quo in\n\ntheir then current form.\n\nIn 1985, both Francis and Rick recorded solo albums. Rick's,\n\ntitled 'Recorded Delivery' ended up costing him money he\n\ndidn't have, and was never released. Francis' ('Flying\n\nDebris') had two singles released from it, which made it into\n\nthe charts and then suddenly dropped out again. A large\n\nnumber of the songs from both solo albums were subsequently\n\nreleased as B-sides to Quo singles.\n\nThe band were invited by Bob Geldof to open the Live Aid\n\nconcert on 13 July 1985, with the song that became the event's\n\nanthem, 'Rocking All Over The World.' The song, written by\n\nJohn Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival, was a hit for\n\nthem in 1977. The nucleus of the band was together for that\n\nday, but soon after, Alan Lancaster sued Rick and Francis for\n\nthe use of the Status Quo name without him.\n\nUltimately, Alan lost the case, and Phonogram decided it was\n\nabout time for Quo to fulfil their contract obligation to\n\nproduce a further three albums. Rick suggested John 'Rhino'\n\nEdwards and Jeff Rich, who had worked with him on his solo\n\nalbum, and together they recorded the album 'In The Army Now,'\n\nreleased in 1986.\n\nThey released a compilation of most of their top ten hits\n\n(Mystery Song, which reached number seven in 1976, is notably\n\nmissing), 'Rocking All Over The Years,' to celebrate their\n\ntwenty-fifth anniversary. Yes, I know, they can't add up -\n\nafter the departure of Alan Lancaster and John Coghlan, the\n\nband appear to have decided to date the foundation from 1965,\n\nwhen Rick and Francis met. They also held a birthday bash at\n\nButlins in Minehead, where Rick and Francis had met twenty-\n\nfive years before. A medley, the 'Anniversary Waltz' was\n\nspecially recorded for the album, and reached number two in\n\nthe charts.\n\nIn 1991, they received two music industry awards; the Brit\n\nAward for an Outstanding Contribution to the Music Industry,\n\nand a World Music Award at a ceremony in Monte Carlo. At the\n\nBrit Awards, they caused a storm by accepting their award in\n\ntuxedoes, then going up on stage and tearing off their suits\n\nto reveal their denim stage gear underneath!\n\nQuo made it into the Guinness Book of Records later that year\n\nwith the 'Rock 'Til You Drop' event. They played four venues\n\nin under twelve hours, at Sheffield, Glasgow, Birmingham NEC\n\nand Wembley Arena. The proceeds from the shows were given to\n\nNordoff-Robbins Music Therapy, the Brit School for Performing\n\nArts, and local children's charities. The following year, Quo\n\nheadlined Radio One's twenty-fifth birthday celebrations,\n\n'Party In The Park' at Sutton Park in Birmingham. The\n\nrecording of this concert was released as the album 'Live\n\nAlive Quo'.\n\nTheir self-written biography, 'Just For The Record' was\n\npublished by Bantam Press in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Quo celebrated their thirtieth anniversary with a\n\ncomplete album of cover versions, titled 'Don't Stop.' It\n\nincluded collaborations with the Beach Boys (Fun, Fun, Fun),\n\nBrian May from Queen (Raining In My Heart) and Maddy Prior\n\nfrom Steeleye Span (All Around My Hat). However, Radio One\n\nrefused to play Fun Fun Fun, as with their previous eight\n\nsingles. This led eventually to Quo challenging Radio One in\n\nthe High Court. Since Radio 1 is a station with a government\n\ngrant, and paid for by the taxpayer and licence fees, Quo\n\nreasoned, it should play the singles that the public had put\n\nin the chart. Unfortunately, they lost this action, and their\n\nchances of being played decreased.\n\nIn 1997, Rick went into hospital suffering from chest pains\n\nand had to have a quadruple heart bypass operation. However,\n\nhe recovered fine and played an excellent gig at Norwich\n\nFootball Ground on 2 August. Later on, the record company\n\nreleased a new compilation album, on two CDs/cassettes,\n\ncontaining almost all the top twenty hits, and some songs that\n\ndidn't hit at all (such as All Around My Hat), under the title\n\n'Whatever You Want - The Very Best Of Status Quo'. This release\n\ncaused much controversy on the mailing list, but the consensus\n\nnow seems to be that the album is worth it (since it contains\n\nsongs such as 'Down The Dustpipe,' 'In My Chair,' 'Again and\n\nAgain,' and others that are less well-known).\n\nIn 1998, the band were touring again, in Europe, Japan, and\n\nAustralia, and recording songs for a new album slated for\n\nrelease in early '99. As mentioned earlier, Castle\n\nCommunications (who hold the copyright to the masters from the\n\nPYE years) have now re-mastered much of the early material,\n\nincluding rare tracks from about the right period on each of\n\nthe first four albums, and a new compilation of all the tracks\n\nfrom the singles (both sides) and some out-takes and alternate\n\nversions. Quo Anthology, anyone?\n\nIn March 1999, Quo released their eagerly awaited new album,\n\nnow titled 'Under The Influence'. Impressions of this new\n\nalbum are good, with everyone seeming to like at least nine\n\nout of the twelve songs. The first single 'The Way It Goes'\n\ndid not do well in the UK, only reaching no. 39. The second\n\nsingle, 'Little White Lies,' will be released on 1 June 1999\n\nin the UK.\n\nQuo provided some new tracks and some old ones for a TV series\n\nin Germany titled 'Benzin im Blut.' Some of the old favourites\n\nhave been remixed, to a mixed reception, for this series and\n\nthe accompanying soundtrack album.\n\n&nbsp\n\nContinue to:\n\nprev: 2.a.
