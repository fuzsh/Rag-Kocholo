        "text": "The iconic Status Quo are delighted to announce the release of the first volume of the new ‘Official Archive Series’ brought to you by earMUSIC. ‘Vol. 1 – Live In Amsterdam’ will be released on 11 August 2023, on strictly limited and numbered CD and vinyl editions, as well as on digital formats. As with each forthcoming release in this series, this official and fully endorsed recording features a carefully curated selection of iconic Status Quo performances, including classic hits spanning their extensive catalogue, deep cuts and fan favourites. Each track is a testament to the band’s enduring popularity and musical prowess. The next volume will be released in November and was recorded in London, so keep your eyes open for the following releases!\n\nThe ‘Official Archive Series’ will offer exceptional sound quality and great packaging throughout, featuring photography by Christie Goodwin. The Series has been freshly mixed and mastered by Eike Freese and Laurin Halberstadt at Chameleon Studios Hamburg.\n\n‘Vol. 1 – Live In Amsterdam’ was recorded in the Dutch capital on 19 October 2010 on the band’s ‘Pictures Exposed World Tour’. The setlist at the Heineken Hall was representative of the rest of the ‘Pictures Exposed World Tour’ with the line-up of Francis Rossi, Rick Parfitt, Andrew Bown, John ‘Rhino’ Edwards and Matt Letley delivering an avalanche of Quo classics, as befitted a tour celebrating ‘40 Years of Hits’.\n\nA first musical foretaste of the release of ‘Official Archive Series Vol. 1 – Live In Amsterdam’ is already available with the single ‘Beginning Of The End’, first released on the album ‘In Search Of The Fourth Chord’ in 2007.\n\nThe first release sets the bar high for what is due to follow, but each album in the Status Quo ‘Official Archive Series’ captures the raw energy and infectious enthusiasm of a Status Quo live performance; no matter where in the world. With their trademark sound, powerful guitar riffs, and irresistible hooks, the band delivers an unadulterated rock ’n’ roll experience, and this collectible series is a great way to celebrate one of the greatest live acts ever.\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\nCD\n\nDisc 1:\n\nIntro (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nCaroline (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nSomething ‘Bout You Baby I Like (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nRain (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nDon’t Drive My Car (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nMean Girl (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nSofter Ride (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nBeginning Of The End (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nHold You Back (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nThe Proposing Medley (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nThe Oriental (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nCreepin’ Up On You (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nDisc 2:\n\nLiving On An Island (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nIn The Army Now (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nDrum Solo (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nRoll Over Lay Down (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nDown Down (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nWhatever You Want (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nRockin’ All Over The World (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nJunior’s Wailing (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nRock ‘N’ Roll Music / Bye Bye Johnny (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nLP\n\nSIDE A\n\nIntro (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nCaroline (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nSomething ‘Bout You Baby I Like (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nRain (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nSIDE B\n\nDon’t Drive My Car (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nMean Girl (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nSofter Ride (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nBeginning Of The End (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nSIDE C\n\nHold You Back (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nThe Proposing Medley (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nThe Oriental (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nSIDE D\n\nCreepin’ Up On You (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nLiving On An Island (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nIn The Army Now (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nDrum Solo (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nSIDE E\n\nRoll Over Lay Down (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nDown Down (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nWhatever You Want (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nSIDE F\n\nRockin’ All Over The World (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nJunior’s Wailing (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)\n\nRock ‘N’ Roll Music / Bye Bye Johnny (Live In Amsterdam, New 2023 Mix)"
