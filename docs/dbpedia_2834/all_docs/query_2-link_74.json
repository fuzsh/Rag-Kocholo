        "text": "From Piledriver to If you cant stand the heat.\n\nStatus Quo's boogie years were big years. With one exception.\n\nMy subjective opinion from worst to best album in brief\n\nRockin' all over the world 1977\n\n- The exception. Of course, the title track is a stunner. The rest of the record, however, is a deep disappointment. Nothing left of the deep impact of the predecessor that was released 1 year before. Insignificant titles that don't broadcast anything for 45 minutes. For me the low point of these years.\n\nIf you can't stand the Heat 1978\n\nMuch better than Rockin... and some great songs. Again and again is reminiscent of the best boogie recordings.\n\nBut otherwise also a lot of idling.\n\nNot a bad record, but really not a top product from the band either.\n\nQuo 1974\n\nA record that starts off really well with Backwater/Just Take me.\n\nBut after that you get bogged down in unclear arrangements, trying to sound particularly hard. Apart from Lonely Man, the music then comes out rather uninspired, atypical, whereby the 8-minute closing title stands out particularly negatively.\n\nHello! 1973\n\nAnother great start with a roll-over layout down, then later Caroline, who was noodled to death today. In between, plain home cooking. 4500 Times with almost 10 minutes is the end of the disc.\n\nWhile the first half of the song is great in its rich boogie rock, the instrumental section that follows after the final verses is way too long and lost in meaninglessness.\n\nPiledriver 1972\n\nTHE start of the boogie era.\n\nSome absolutely gripping songs like the opener and the absolutely terrific Big Fat Mama. In between there are some calm, slow songs, which are too calm and slow for me.\n\nThe 8 minutes of the RoadhouseBlues are too long. I like the original better then.\n\nNow for the top 3\n\nOn the Level 1976\n\n10 mostly shorter titles without failure. A perfect melody that gets almost everything out of the band's boogie rock.\n\nMy favorites are Little Lady/ Most of the Times, of course the evergreen Down Down and the gripping Bye Bye Johnny.\n\nStatus quo at the top!!\n\nBlue for you 1976\n\nThe perfect studio record.\n\nAlready with Is there a better way Status Quo's ability to set top-class titles to music with 3 chords is expressed. The first side is a milestone.\n\nThe second side may fall off a bit in the first 3 songs, but it gets everything out again with the 7-minute version of the mystery song.\n\nA great LP. Your best studio record forever.\n\nThe Winner: Live 1976\n\nA cross section of the boogie years. Loud, aggressive, gripping, the DoAlbum is an actual best of. Simply the best they've ever done.\n\nAlso 17 minutes of 4500Times sounds a lot better than on the studio album.\n\nThe only thing I don't like that much is the final 14-minute Roadhouse Blues.\n\nFar too much idling in the middle of the title.\n\nBut otherwise: The real number 1.\n\nWhat is your order?\n\nON THE LEVEL:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ruN6cgDkPzA\n\nLIVE 1976:\n\nStatus Quo LIVE 1977 – смотреть видео онлайн в Моем Мире | NO MERCY\n\nDon’t know about the US.\n\nI bought a Quo logo shirt when I saw them in ‘13.\n\nWhen I wore it in public my g/f said people would think I was being ironic.\n\nOh nice - a Quo thread. To quote a lesser track from a much lesser later album of theirs, don't mind if I do:\n\nI'm going to include all the Frantic Four albums. Not including the excellent live album, as it's a best-of really.\n\n1. On the Level - Just perfect. This is how I want my rock and roll to sound.\n\n2. Hello - I like the live 4500x more than the original, but this is an all-time classic. Roll Over and Caroline are overplayed, but for a reason.\n\n3. Quo - Another winner, and it rocks hard. A tad too much Lancaster for me. Could use a touch more Rossi. Swap out Don't Think It Matters for Lonely Night. Slow Train is magnificent - the best of the long studio tracks by a mile!\n\n4. Blue For You - A nice variety of songs, good production. A little more on the lighter side than before. Swap out the title track for You Lost the Love. Mystery Song is great, but the album version has unnecessary padding.\n\n5. Whatever You Want - Best of the Pip Williams productions. The guitars sound wonderful! A lot of great stuff here, even the so-so songs sound thick and meaty. Parfitt's songs are better than ever before, or after.\n\n6. Never Too Late - The last hurrah of the fearsome four. A little poppy at times and the cute falsetto backup vox are not helping, but still enough old school R'n'R to recommend. I like this better than its predecessor Supposin' from the same sessions. Riverside is great!\n\n7. If You Can't Stand the Heat - More polished, but I like the production. Some good songs, some less so, but nothing I have to skip. The guitars sound great. I don't mind the horns and girls singing backup at all. Not a top-tier, but a fun pop-rock album.\n\n8. Piledriver - I should squeeze this in here, as the highs are very high (Paper Plane, Don't Waste My Time). But I tend to skip a lot of the ballad/blues tracks. Big Fat Mama was stronger in later live versions, as was Roadhouse Blues. Still, a big step up from what came before.\n\n9. Just Supposin' - A few good, though fairly poppy tunes. Proposin' is fun. Quite a few lesser tracks, I find. A big drop after Whatever You Want.\n\n10. Rockin' All Over The World - Lousy production, slick but tinny. Too many songs with too much keys. A few good ones though; I like what Lancaster was doing here actually. Coghlan sounds diminished. This must have disappointed a lot of fans at the time.\n\n11. Ma Kelly's Greasy Spoon - Boogie Quo in its embryonic stage. Pretty charming though amateurish low-fi boogie rock. A few fun enough songs that don't overstay their welcome. Everyone's vocals and playing would improve a lot in the coming years.\n\n12. Dog of Two Head - The band sounds more confident than on Ma Kelly, but too much long-winded boogie/bluesy jamming they don't have the chops for yet. A couple of songs would have worked on later albums, if done with a proper Frantic Four treatment. I do like Gerdundula!\n\nOf course, just about all of the above is much better than just about everything thereafter, but that's another thread..."
