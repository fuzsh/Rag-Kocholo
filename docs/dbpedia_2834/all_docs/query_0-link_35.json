If you listen to all of the tracks on that album, some are clearly not Quo doing them. You folks might be able to tell if its Spud's Quo or somebody else, but they are clearly being sold as belonging to JC's Quo on Amazon. And from experience I can tell you they will yank something down at the first hint of copyright infringement.\n\nPost by peterprog on\n\nThis is a truly bizarre compilation. Across the album, there are 18 Quo original recordings, including Perfect Remedy along with many others, and 18 tracks recorded by JC in Italy in 2001 with the lads from the then incarnation of State of Quo.\n\nI don't know the full back story, but briefly, JC along with Paul Carr, Mike Grady and Graham Peters from SoQ, ended up recording at least twenty tracks in these Italian sessions. The record company released these twenty tracks - in Italy - across two CDs in 2001. There were twelve tracks on each CD, with four tracks appearing on both CDs.\n\nwww.discogs.com/release/6732198-John-Coghlan-The-Best-Of-Status-Quo-Performed-By-The-Original-Member-John-Coghlan-\n\nwww.discogs.com/release/13349438-John-Coghlan-John-Coghlan-Performs-The-Best-Songs-Of-Status-Quo\n\nAs I recall from SoQ band member comments on the old official MB at the time, they were not altogether happy with at least some of the final versions, but I must say that the recordings have held up pretty well over the years.\n\nFast forward fifteen years or so and all but two of these twenty tracks are then bundled with a bunch of Quo originals and released on all the streaming platforms. There are around half a dozen different streaming 'albums' available, all released around 2014 or 2015. There are very slight variations between the track listings on each of the albums and very slight variations in the title, though all are based around a theme of 'John Coghlan performs Status Quo Greatest Hits'.\n\nAnd just a final nod to the incompetence / disinterest of whoever assembled these albums. The two tracks from the twenty recordings released from the Italian sessions in 2001 that are not included on these more recent streaming albums are Down Down and RAOTW. However, Quo's original recordings of both these tracks are included.\n\nPretty special work this.\n\nPost by mortified on\n\nFascinating stuff, peterprog 👍 That must have taken a bit of digging!\n\nI've got a State of Quo CD from way back called The Best of Status Quo. Can't remember when I bought it. Presumably it contains tracks from these Italian sessions but it isn't either of those you've provided a link for. This is the cover artwork:\n\nI also have a recording of Something 'Bout You Baby I Like which was given away with some newspaper Sunday supplement back in the 2000's which a mate gave me at work. It's listed as Quo but clearly isn't. Sounds like Mikey singing to me. I'd never seen it anywhere else but I notice it's on that second link you provided.\n\nAll very obscure stuff."
