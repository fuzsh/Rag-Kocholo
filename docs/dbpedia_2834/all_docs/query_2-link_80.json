        "text": "Brand new studio album is released in May but you can get a FREE DOWNLOAD now\n\nQuid Pro Quo will be released on 2CD exclusively through Tesco on 30 May 2011. The album boasts 14 brand new tracks plus the 2010 version of 'In The Army Now' and is packaged with a second disc entitled Official Bootleg – Greatest Hits Live.\n\nThe 'Official Bootleg' was recorded in Amsterdam and Melbourne last year and offers 10 classics, including 'Down Down', 'Whatever You Want' and 'Caroline'. This is the first new Quo studio album for four years since In Search of the Fourth Chord.\n\nFrancis Rossi and Rick Parfitt commented, \"In many ways this release is another example of Quo teaming up with a great British institution. Following our innovative pairings with Coronation Street and the Armed Forces, it seems only natural to now team up with the institution that is Britain's biggest high street retailer. We are really proud of the new songs and wanted to make sure that the album got to as many people as possible, working with Tesco achieves that aim.\"\n\nAnd the band are currently giving away the song 'ROCK 'N' ROLL 'N' YOU' on their official website right now.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FREE DOWNLOAD\n\nA limited run of 1000 deluxe box sets will be available worldwide, 500 exclusively from statusquo.co.uk. The sets will comprise a vinyl album in a gatefold sleeve, the 2CD version featuring special artwork and 2 extra live tracks, a Quo poster, individually numbered 'Quo Quid' banknote, a T-shirt and a set of badges unavailable elsewhere. The sets will retail at £50.\n\nHere's the tracklist:\n\nQuid Pro Quo:\n\n1. Two Way Traffic (Rossi/Edwards)\n\n2. Rock 'n' Roll 'n' You (Rossi/Bown)\n\n3. Dust To Gold (Rossi/Bown/Edwards)\n\n4. Let's Rock (Parfitt/Morris)\n\n5. Can't See for Looking (Parfitt/Bown/Edwards)\n\n6. Better Than That (Rossi/Young)\n\n7. Movin' On (Rossi/Young)\n\n8. Leave A Little Light On (Parfitt/Morris)\n\n9.
