        "text": "Status Quo released “Backbone” – their 33rd studio album back on September 6. Backbone was Status Quo’s new LP was their 33rd 33rpm!\n\nThe eleven track album was recorded at Francis’ studio in the late months of 2018 and into this year. The sessions were initially just to keep the juices flowing, improvise and have fun. As the hours rolled on, songs stacked up, everyone began to believe that special was happening. And so it proved.\n\n“Backbone” is Status Quo’s first studio album with new songs in 8 years."
