The album was an instant success, charting at No.8 and selling over a quarter of a million copies in the UK alone. In July 2009 the Pictures live tour landed at Montreux in Switzerland as part of the world famous festival. The band, led as always by the twin Telecasters of Francis Rossi & Rick Parfitt, delivered a blistering set of hits and classic tracks from across their career including no less than 18 UK Top 20 hits. Huge screens behind the stage illustrated high points from Quos career and the usually reserved Swiss crowd were rockin all over the Auditorium.",
