        "text": "earMUSIC [Release date 11.08.23]\n\nFor SQ’s new live album it all began with the ‘Beginning Of The End’.\n\nThat single, released in 2007, sparked an idea that has only now seen the bright light of day.\n\nIt was a foretaste of this 2CD Official Archive Series Volume 1 – Live In Amsterdam, released 11 August.\n\nThe gig, recorded on The Netherlands leg of the band’s 2010 “Pictures Exposed World Tour” has been remixed and remastered by the label’s Go To Guy, Eike Freese (sometime guitarist with Kai Hansen’s bands). Freese’s reputation goes far and wide, recording and producing artists as Alice Cooper, Deep Purple, Helloween and Lynyrd Skynyrd at his Chamelon Studios in Hamburg.\n\nThe reissue / remaster story belongs to Quo more than any other UK rock band, essentially the story of post-2010 Quo. Recognition that there was and still is a growing appetite among a more affluent demographic for seeing the band live. And that has switched the focus away from your old fashioned album/single toward your actual rock concert.\n\nAnd the only way to remind you of how great the gig was… buy the Live album.\n\nThis one is worth shelling out for whether you were there or not. 21 tracks across 2 CDs, and every one deserves to be here, and while each may not be a killer cut, this collection is chocka with truly outstanding compositions.\n\nSo while we luxuriate in electric and electrifying live renditions of ‘Something ‘Bout You Baby’ and ‘Roll Over Lay Down’, not forgetting a jaw-dropping version of ‘Mean Girl’, we also get the opportunity to devote more of our attention to the perfect pop-boogie of ‘Caroline’ and of course to the late Rick Parfitt’s major songwriting contributions to the Quo cannon, ‘Living On An Island’ and ‘Rain’.\n\nNo question, Quo clearly found its groove that night in The Netherlands, confirmation – if any were needed – that this band gains in stature in the live arena, delivering often underrated rock’n’roll. ****\n\nReview by Brian McGowan\n\nFeatured Artist: JOSH TAERK\n\nSince early 2020 Josh has been entertaining us with exclusive monthly live sessions, streamed via Facebook.\n\nIn 2023 he signed a recording deal with Sony in Canada and released a new single on 15 September.\n\nLatest session: Sunday 26 May\n\nNext session: Sunday 29 September\n\nCheck out videos here: https://www.facebook.com/getreadytorockradio\n\nDavid Randall presents a weekly show on Get Ready to ROCK!
