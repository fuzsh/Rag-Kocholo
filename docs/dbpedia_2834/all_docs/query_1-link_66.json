        "text": "Bob’s first Quo gig\n\nMy first gig as roadie to Status Quo was at the Top Rank Ballroom in Bristol on June 4th 1968. It was just me and their equipment in a van with Francis and Rick riding shotgun. The other three came along in their flash Pontiac Parisienne car driven by tour manager John Fanning. The small van was packed solid with gear with not an inch to spare.\n\nI was told it had to come out and go back in exactly the same way otherwise it wouldn’t all fit in, so I decided the best thing to do was write a list to make sure. I wrote this on the back of an old envelope and on the other side I drew a stage plan of where everything was to be set up every night. Not exactly a Rolling Stones set up but it was early days and I didn’t want to mess up and lose my new £15 a week job. Thankfully a year later I became the tour manager with a £5 raise and got to travel with the band.\n\nThe Bob Young Archive: the On The Level album sleeve\n\nQuo’s eighth studio album ‘On The Level’ was released in Feb 1975 and added to their many albums which made the top spot in the charts. For the album gatefold sleeve it was decided to pull out a whole bunch of (mostly) my photos. The band then selected the ones we thought might work if we cut them up, stuck them on a board the size of a double vinyl album sleeve and photographed it. I think what we were smoking steered us towards our final selection and this is the end result. Very rough, very basic and very silly. I eventually framed that original board and it now hangs proudly in my son Jamies’ office.\n\nThe Bob Young Archive: the Triple Gold Record Award\n\nStatus Quo has sold well over 100 million records worldwide resulting in countless international awards throughout the years. The gold and platinum albums and singles awards came in all shapes and sizes and I thought were often quite beautiful. In 1976 the Australian record company asked if they could fly over there for five days of publicity to collect ten gold album awards (two triples, a double and two singles) for sales of a couple of the albums. How could we refuse a few days in one of our favourite countries? Of course we managed to extend this trip to two weeks of fun and games and this is one of those ten we each received. With the changes in how music is now sold, these actual awards are becoming quite rare. 250,000 plays on Spotify etc do not mean quite the same to writers and artists these days as 250,000 CD and vinyl sales….\n\nThe Bob Young Archive: limited edition prints\n\nIn the mid/late seventies I was invited to join the then quite new and small UK fund raising committee of the Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy Charity. I stayed on this for many years into the late eighties as I watched this wonderful organisation grow. We all came up with various fund raising projects in those meetings and the first I had was to produce and sell original limited edition prints signed by major music industry names. The first one was based on my poem ‘But For The Kids’ with six original sketches drawn and donated by Cat Stevens, Roger Glover, Tommy Steele, Mike Oldfield, Roger Dean and Keith Michell. 100 of these numbered and framed prints were produced and each signed all by all six.\n\nBefore technology gave us a big helping hand, we would stick ideas down on a heavy old cassette player which each of us had and carried around everywhere on tour. I’ve kept all of those cassettes and still find some crazy ideas we would start and never get to finish. With ‘Down Down’ I remember Francis and I writing the first ideas in our hotel room in the Travel Lodge Motel in LA and eventually finishing the song back home in London. Rick and I wrote ‘Living On An Island’ in our hotel room on the island of Jersey in the Channel Islands. This was on one of my visits as he spent a part of each year there. The lyrics are about our time together on the island and there’s still certain magic about some of those first writing ideas and rough demos.\n\nThe Bob Young Archive: the tour manager’s briefcase\n\nThe is my tour managers’ briefcase from the early/mid-seventies. My travelling office, decades before everything important on tour could go on a laptop and iPhone. How everyone back then moved around the world, gig to gig and without mobile phones is still a bit of a mystery but one shared by many I imagine! After a great gig and a very late night, various band members headed off into the night with new, temporary friends! With an early flight the next morning it was every tour managers nightmare. But somehow it all worked – it had to! We knew no different.\n\nThe Bob Young Archive: Quo and the Chelsea Bridge coffee hut\n\nFor over several decades and until quite recently, there had been a popular coffee hut on London’s Chelsea Bridge. It was open 24 hours, 365 days a year and frequented by all kinds of people imaginable. It was also well known to the many famous and not so famous musicians and road crews traveling home after long, tiring overnight drives from their gigs in most places in the UK north of the River Thames. Status Quo was just one of those ‘not so famous’ bands in the late sixties and early seventies that regularly stopped there for a welcome coffee and a burger. It was run back then by a grumpy, but lovely old chap called Dave who we got to know well and who we deliberately called either Ron or Tony as we competed to see who could be the first to make him smile. He didn’t sell alcohol or cigarettes so our orders always began with ‘Twenty Number 6 ciggies and a beer please Ron’. His reply was always the same, ‘Fuck off and where have you been tonight boys?’\n\nBy 1972 Quo were becoming reasonably successful in the UK and by 73’ had begun touring more overseas in America, Europe and Australia but we never forgot Dave and that famous and now iconic, red coffee hut on the Bridge. We’d send him the occasional postcard on our travels and recently, out of the blue, one of those cards managed to find its way back to me after fifty years via Dave’s niece. I remember writing and posting this one from Atlanta in the middle of one of Quo’s very early USA tours."
