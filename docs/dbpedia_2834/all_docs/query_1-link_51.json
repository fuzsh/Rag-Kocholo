The record company then asked why we didn’t use them on an album. I am sure some people will take offence that we messed with their favourite Quo song but we have not touched the original versions – they are still there!\n\nWhich versions will you play on the tour?\n\nWe will play them in the in the same style as originally recorded; we have a great band and a very enthusiastic bass player. We call him Rhino because he bashes into everything. When on the tour bus walking from front to back he literally bashes into everything. He plays bass very enthusiastically and is a fantastic player.\n\nWhat motivates you to keep playing and touring?\n\nProbably ego! I wanted to be loved and liked plus the fact that there is such a buzz from playing in front of a live audience. I suppose, in some ways, it is sad that a man aged seventy three still needs to go out there and be validated; but the fans do make us feel wanted and after ninety minutes on stage I just want to do it all over again.\n\nShakin’ Stevens is going to be the support act, do you think the Quo fans will appreciate him?\n\nWhatever your opinion is of Shakin’ Stevens you have to admit he is a damn fine act – he is just so good at what he does. I just hope everyone else is as pleased as we are and will come along early and see him.\n\nDo you have any favourite venues to play in the north?\n\nYes. We went back to Stockton Globe in March this year and it was marvellous, the vibes from the audience and the band was incredible. We were the last rock band to play there before it closed down as a music venue – we must have done something wrong but to go back and see the theatre come back to life was a joy.\n\nI am excited too about the re-opening of the old Bradford Odeon. I would love to play there when it opens. I am very enthusiastic about playing those old venues particularly with that capacity, it will mean that the larger acts will come back to Bradford, the city needs something of that size.\n\nStatus Quo play Leeds Arena on Monday 28th November 2022\n\nhttps://www.aegpresents.co.uk/events/detail/status-quo-5"
