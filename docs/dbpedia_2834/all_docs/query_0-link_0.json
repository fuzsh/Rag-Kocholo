        "text": "1983 studio album by Status Quo\n\nBack to BackStudio album by Released25 November 1983Recorded1983StudioAIR (Salem, Montserrat)GenreHard rock, boogie rockLength32:55LabelVertigoProducerStatus QuoStatus Quo chronologySingles from Back to Back\n\nReleased: 2 September 1983\n\nReleased: 28 October 1983\n\nReleased: 2 December 1983\n\nReleased: 11 May 1984\n\nBack to Back is the sixteenth studio album by English rock band Status Quo and released in November 1983. For the first time in the group's history, it featured four singles, \"Ol' Rag Blues\" (highest position No. 9), \"A Mess of Blues\", originally a hit for Elvis Presley (No. 15), \"Marguerita Time\" (No. 3), and \"Going Down Town Tonight\" (which reached No. 20 in a different, re-recorded version to the album version.) The album entered the UK chart at its highest position of No. 9.\n\nIt was the last recorded before the group temporarily disbanded in 1985 and therefore the last to feature original bass guitarist Alan Lancaster and drummer Pete Kircher. Lancaster co-wrote the first single, \"Ol' Rag Blues\", with Keith Lamb, lead singer of British bands The Kase, Sleepy Talk and Mr. Toad, and founder and lead singer of Australia's successful glam rock band Hush. Lancaster was angered when the production company declined to release the version featuring his lead vocal (which has since been made available as a bonus track on the 2006 remastered reissue), in preference to that featuring the voice of Francis Rossi. He also made no secret of his dislike of \"Marguerita Time\", which he thought was too pop-orientated for the group. When they appeared on BBC's Top of the Pops to mime to the single, his place was taken by Jim Lea of Slade, who were also on the programme that week. The Top of the Pops performance was also notable for Rick Parfitt falling into Pete Kircher's drum set near the end of the song while the song kept playing. On the DVD Hello Quo, Parfitt claims that he had planned this action, although many people thought he was drunk. On the same DVD, Alan Lancaster also said that he wasn't so concerned with \"Marguerita Time\" as he was with \"Going Down Town Tonight\", which – according to him – was not a Status Quo recording and featured no Status Quo musicians apart from Francis Rossi.\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2006 remaster has a snippet of Bernie Frost singing \"I've Got Tears In My Ears From Lying On My Back In Bed Crying Over You\" by Homer and Jethro at the beginning of \"No Contract\" and a slightly longer fade, extending the runtime by almost twenty seconds.[1]\n\n2006 reissue bonus tracks\n\n[edit]\n\nSeptember 2018 Deluxe Edition (CD2) bonus material\n\n[edit]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Chris \"Props\" Ranson - Instrument Technician.\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1983–1984) Peak\n\nposition Australian Albums (Kent Music Report)[2] 97 Dutch Albums (Album Top 100)[3] 26 German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)[4] 60 Swedish Albums (Sverigetopplistan)[5] 38 Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade)[6] 20 UK Albums (OCC)[7] 9\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Certification Certified units/sales United Kingdom (BPI)[8] Gold 100,000^\n\n^ Shipments figures based on certification alone."
