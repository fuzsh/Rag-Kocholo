        "text": "The duo, comprised of Madeline Follin and Brian Oblivion, return with their first new music in two years - during which time they have seen support from the likes of The Telegraph, CLASH, DORK, The Line of Best Fit and more.\n\nTo the Ghosts was meticulously crafted; the earliest ideas dated back to the pandemic when they wrote music on weekdays from 10am-5pm with no deadlines or distractions.\n\nThe album was written and recorded in Brian's apartment; in 2022 they traveled to Los Angeles to collaborate with longtime producer and trusted creative confidant Shane Stoneback, because \"nobody can read our minds like he can,\" jests Madeline.\n\nTo the Ghosts was co-produced by Cults & Shane Stoneback, mixed by John Congleton, and mastered by Heba Kadry NYC.\n\nThe duo are just as at home on stage at Coachella as they are supporting The Pixies and Vampire Weekend.\n\nAll the while, their music has surged through popular television series and films.\n\nThe staple Always Forever reached RIAA platinum status, and the track Gilded Lily endured as a phenomenon. It took TikTok by storm with 200K-plus \"creates\" in 2022 and notched a gold certification.\n\nThey've co-written with everyone from G-Eazy to Freddie Gibbs, appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and graced the bills of major festivals such as Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, and more."
