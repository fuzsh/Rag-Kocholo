        "text": "Status Quo was an English hard-rock/boogie band from London that initially cut three beat singles as The Spectres circa 1966/67, followed by a fourth as The Traffic Jam in 1967. After settling on the name Status Quo, the band released four albums on Pye between 1968 and 1971, followed by 16 further studio albums on Vertigo during the subsequent 20-year period.\n\nThe band’s first album, Picturesque Matchstickable Messages From The Status Quo, yielded several hits in the pop-psych vein, including Quo’s only Billboard Top 40 entry “Pictures of Matchstick Men.” Starting with the 1972 release Piledriver, the band scored a string of U.K. hits and ultimately became one of rock’s biggest all-time acts outside the U.S.\n\nMembers: Francis Rossi (guitar, vocals), Rick Parfitt (guitar, vocals, 1967-2016), Alan Lancaster (bass, guitar, 1967-85), John Coghlan (drums, 1967-82), Roy Lynes (keyboards, 1967-70), Pete Kircher (drums, 1982-85), Andy Bown (keyboards, piano, guitar, 1982-present), Jeff Rich (drums, 1986-2000), John “Rhino” Edwards (bass, guitar, 1986-present)\n\nFormation\n\nStatus Quo evolved from a musical partnership established in 1962 by 13-year-olds Francis Rossi (guitar/vocals) and Alan Lancaster (bass), then students at Sedgehill Comprehensive School in Catford. They rehearsed as The Paladins and The Scorpions with schoolmates Jess Jaworski (keyboards) and Alan Key (drums). The following year, Keys cleared way for drummer John Coghlan (b. 1946) and the band renamed itself The Spectres.\n\nThe Spectres\n\nAfter getting a residency at the Samuel Jones Sports Club, The Spectres were taken under the managerial wing of gasfitter Pat Barlow, who secured them gigs on the London club circuit. In 1965, Jaworski quit and the band hired keyboardist Roy Lyne (b. 1943). Around this time, Rossi befriended guitarist/singer Rick Parfitt (1948–2016) of local cabaret act The Highlights.\n\nIn July 1966, The Specters were signed to Picadilly Records, which issued their first two singles that year: “I (Who Have Nothing)” b/w “Neighbour-Neighbour” (both covers) and the Lancaster originals “Hurdy Gurdy Man” (not the Donovan song) b/w “Laticia.” The third and final Specters single was the 1967 Blues Magoos cover “(We Ain’t Got) Nothin’ Yet” b/w the group original “I Want It.”\n\nThe Traffic Jam\n\nWhen psychedelia took hold, they renamed themselves Traffic but soon learned the name had been claimed for Steve Winwood‘s new band. They expanded the name to The Traffic Jam and issued a fourth single, “Almost But Not Quite There” b/w “Wait Just a Minute.” Immediately after its release, Parfitt joined as rhythm guitarist and co-vocalist. In August 1967, the now-five-piece band renamed itself The Status Quo.\n\nPicturesque Matchstickable Messages From The Status Quo\n\nStatus Quo released their debut album, Picturesque Matchstickable Messages From The Status Quo, on September 27, 1968, on Pye.\n\nSpare Parts\n\nStatus Quo released their second album, Spare Parts, on September 26, 1969, on Pye.\n\nMa Kelly’s Greasy Spoon\n\nStatus Quo released their third album, Ma Kelly’s Greasy Spoon, on August 28, 1970, on Pye.\n\nDog of Two Head\n\nStatus Quo released their fourth album, Dog of Two Head, on November 5, 1971, on Pye.\n\nPiledriver\n\nStatus Quo released their fifth album, Piledriver, on December 15, 1972, on Vertigo.\n\nHello!\n\nStatus Quo released their sixth album, Hello!, on September 28, 1973, on Vertigo.\n\nQuo\n\nStatus Quo released their seventh album, Quo, on May 3, 1974, on Vertigo.\n\nOn the Level\n\nStatus Quo released their eighth album, On the Level, on February 21, 1975, on Vertigo.\n\nBlue for You\n\nStatus Quo released their ninth album, Blue for You, on March 12, 1976, on Vertigo.\n\nLive!\n\nOn March 4 1977, Status Quo released the double-album Live!, culled from their October 27–29, 1976, shows at Glasgow’s Apollo Theatre.\n\nRockin’ All Over the World\n\nStatus Quo released their tenth album, Rockin’ All Over the World, on November 11, 1977, on Vertigo.\n\nIf You Can’t Stand the Heat\n\nStatus Quo released their eleventh studio album, If You Can’t Stand the Heat, on October 27, 1978, on Vertigo.\n\nWhatever You Want\n\nStatus Quo released their twelfth studio album, Whatever You Want, on October 12, 1979, on Vertigo.\n\nJust Supposin’\n\nStatus Quo released their thirteenth album, Just Supposin’, on October 17, 1980, on Vertigo.\n\nNever Too Late\n\nStatus Quo released their fourteenth album, Never Too Late, on March 13, 1981, on Vertigo.\n\n1+9+8+2\n\nStatus Quo released their fifteenth album, 1+9+8+2, on April 16, 1982, on Vertigo.\n\nBack to Back\n\nStatus Quo released their sixteenth album, Back to Back, on November 25, 1983, on Vertigo.\n\nIn the Army Now\n\nStatus Quo released their seventeenth album, In the Army Now, on August 29, 1986, on Vertigo.\n\nAin’t Complaining\n\nStatus Quo released their eighteenth album, , on June 6, 1988, on Vertigo.\n\nDiscography:\n\nPicturesque Matchstickable Messages From The Status Quo (1968)\n\nSpare Parts (1969)\n\nMa Kelly’s Greasy Spoon (1970)\n\nDog of Two Head (1971)\n\nPiledriver (1972)\n\nHello!
