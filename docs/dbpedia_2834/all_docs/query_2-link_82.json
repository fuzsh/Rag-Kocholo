        "text": "Christmas Eve last year saw the sad news break that one of rock’s greatest guitarist had died.\n\nRick died aged 68 of a “severe infection” having stepped down as the band’s guitarist in September 2016 following a heart attack in the summer.\n\nHe may be gone, but now his debut solo album is being released posthumously.\n\nTitled Over And Out, the record which was virtually completed before he died will be released on March 23 through earMUSIC.\n\nThe album has 10 brand new song, including the title track that was played at Rick’s funeral.\n\nThe record is said to be “a true labour of love and showcases the softer side of Rick as a writer, artist and performer away from the Quo maelstrom as well as the purest rock and roll sound of earlier Status Quo records.”\n\nOriginally Rick was set to complete his guitar and vocal parts in a recording session set for February 2017.\n\nNevertheless Rick’s close friends such as Queen’s Brian May and Muse Chris Wolstenholme stepped in with his son Rick Parfitt Jr to finish to job. They were joined by Status Quo bassists John “Rhino” Edwards and Alan Lancaster.\n\nEarlier this year Status Quo’s Francis Rossi admitted he hadn’t cried over Rick’s death.\n\nRossi said: “It's not what we did or how we were. We used to joke about how he would go or how I would go and we would giggle – to us, it was funny.”\n\nRick Parfitt’s solo album Over And Out will be released on March 23, 2018."
