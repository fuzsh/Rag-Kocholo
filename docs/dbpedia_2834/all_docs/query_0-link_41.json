        "text": "June 18, 2023\n\nAn entertaining, well-written and mostly accessible guide to the Frantic Four’s studio output from Ma Kelly to Back to Back. The stand-alone singles such as Wild Side and Wanderer are also reviewed. The book is meticulously compiled with much interesting detail included, for example that Roger Glover played bass on Wild Side, I recall hearing this was because Glover was dissatisfied with Lancaster’s playing.\n\nEach album is dissected with a general introduction, James provides valuable context to cover what was happing with the band at the time and the location of the recording sessions. The production side is also surveyed, and now I know that On The Level sounds so much ‘brighter’ than Hello and Quo because of the lack of reverb in the recording.\n\nJames takes head-on the ‘three chord’ trope and analyses each track for the number of chords (how he did it is to me a mystery), and in the final section he analyses the accumulated data picking out the tracks with the least and most chords, together with an average and frequency data. Fascinating and valuable analysis for the hard-core fan, especially one who wants to trump their mates’ three-chord jibes.\n\nThe Frantic Four reunion is covered and illustrations from those two glorious years are included. The 1977 Live album is covered, but unfortunately not in as much detail as the studio albums.\n\nJames is clearly a Frantic Four fan especially of the Piledriver-Blue for You run of albums. He is scathing towards Rocking and many of their later albums. Those from In the Army Now, are listed with a brief commentary but it is clear James has little time for them. Their inclusion and the details provided are valuable but perhaps he would have been best advised to merely include their details, eschewing his harsh comments.\n\nMany of us enjoy the post 1986 output and do treasure the band as Status Quo not as James jibes, the ‘Francis Rossi Group’. Afterall Rhino and Andy have been full members for 37 years far longer than Lancaster and Coghlan were! To still have the band touring and making music, even with just one original member, is something to treasure.\n\nJames knows his music and deconstructs the tracks covered, although some of the musical jargon he uses is lost on the unfamiliar fan. Perhaps a glossary could have been included to save continual references to Google.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable book which sits within my Quo library and which I would recommend to any Quo fan wanting to know more about the glory years of the Frantic Four.\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\nAn essential read from start to finish if you enjoy the music of the Quo. Also a good reference book worth going back to time and time again as you go back to the classic 1970's albums. Richard James covers all the Frantic Four albums, the staggeringly creative output of 11 studio albums from 1970 to 1981, all but two of which hit the top 5 of the UK album charts during an era when chart positions actually meant something. With John Coghlan departing, I do not fully agree that the Frantic Four's work includes the albums 1982 and Back to Back but James covers those in detail nonetheless by which point, his criticism has become barbed and not without justification, as the band fell apart. Of course, there is a degree of subjectivity in any song review but if a review is written well, it enlightens and informs you even if you do not ultimately agree. (I sometimes thought that too much analysis of the parts of a song misses the glorious joie de vivre of the whole song eg Rockers Rollin') For the most part, James does his critiques very well. I particularly enjoyed his prefaces to each album covering the circumstances of recording, the artwork and other interesting minutiae from the time. There is also a tongue-firmly-in-cheek detailed analysis of the numbers of chords in the songs to re-but the lazy reviewers' trope that the band operated on three chords per song. For the record, the average is more than double the assumed figure if, indeed, such statistical nonsense was ever a factor of any relevance to the way that music engages the heart and mind."
