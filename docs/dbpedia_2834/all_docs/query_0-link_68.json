Watch the band’s performance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!\n\nFor more information and to purchase tickets, visit chicanobatman.com\n\nFresh off the electrifying release of their fifth studio album, Notebook Fantasy (ATO Records), and still reeling from their largest hometown show to date at The Kia Forum on June 26th, the acclaimed psych-soul band Chicano Batman continues to round out an expansive world tour, adding a collection of tour dates along the California Coast this Fall. The tour will include a very special 2-night celebration in Pomona, CA at the Fox Theater.\n\nKnown for their vibrant live performances, the Los Angeles-based band promise to bring a high-energy celebration of the band’s latest musical achievements, drawing on the bold and boundary-pushing sounds of Notebook Fantasy.\n\nChicano Batman is known for their unique blend of soulful psychedelia, rock, and Latin influences. The band, comprised of Bardo Martinez (vocals/lyricist), Carlos Arévalo (guitar), and Eduardo Arenas (bass), has captivated audiences with their innovative sound and vibrant performances. Their latest album, Notebook Fantasy, continues to showcase their exceptional musicianship and creativity.\n\nAhead of the US West Coast tour, Chicano Batman will take their show overseas for a series of performances in the United Kingdom and Europe in August, followed by multiple shows across Mexico, marking their first extensive tour in these regions.\n\nChicano Batman’s tour comes on the heels of the critically acclaimed Notebook Fantasy, a project that showcases the band’s artistic evolution and their commitment to pushing musical boundaries. Produced by John Congleton (St. Vincent, Erykah Badu) and partly recorded at the historic Sunset Sound, Notebook Fantasy embraces a sonic approach that bassist Eduardo Arenas refers to as “painting in primary colors.”\n\nNotebook Fantasy takes its title from a phenomenon likely familiar to anyone who feels outside the status quo: the act of spending your formative years dreaming up other worlds and realities in the pages of a notebook, exploring those possibilities with a bold and wide-eyed freedom. Watch the band perform “Fly” on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Throughout the album, Chicano Batman channels moments of lightning-in-a-bottle inspiration into songs that push into fantastically strange terrain yet remain rooted in raw emotion.\n\n“We wanted to peel back all the fuzziness and compression, and create something big and punchy and clear that would still hold up if you stripped it down to just a vocal and one instrument,” says guitarist Carlos Arévalo.\n\nFor more information and to purchase tickets for Chicano Batman’s upcoming performances, please visit chicanobatman.com.\n\nEuropean and Mexican Tour Dates:\n\nThursday, August 29th – Tolhuistuin – Amsterdam, NL\n\nFriday, August 30th – Into the Great Wide Open Festival – Amsterdam, NL\n\nSaturday, August 31st – Manchester Psych Fest – Manchester, UK\n\nTuesday, September 3rd – Lafayette – London, UK\n\nThursday, September 26th – C3 Stage – Guadalajara, MX\n\nFriday, September 27th – Foro Indie Rocks! – Queretaro, MX\n\nSaturday, September 28th – Auditorio BB – Mexico City, MX\n\nChicano Batman – U.S. Tour Dates"
