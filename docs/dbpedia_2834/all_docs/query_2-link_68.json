        "text": "There are many compilations covering the productions by Status Quo in the 70s and 80s, the period when the big classics by the band were recorded. In the last 20 years, Status Quo continued to release chart albums and pushed themselves to play in front of bigger and bigger audiences. To do this era justice, “Quo’ing In – The Best of the Noughties” will be released on 16 September 2022 on various formats: 2CD Jewelcase, Digital, as well as a Limited Edition 3CD Deluxe Digipak featuring a bonus live concert.\n\nLike for all bands with a career spanning five decades, the new songs always had to “fight” against the power of the old hits. This compilation shows how many great songs Status Quo has recorded in each of their recent albums. And for all those who can’t help the thought of a Status Quo collection without the hits… the Ltd. 3CD Digipak features a previously unreleased and newly mixed live recording, with the band on top form in 2008. To be noticed is the presence of hits like “Caroline”, “Rocking All Over the World” and “Paper Plane”, as brand-new 2022 studio recordings by the current line-up of the band. Songs like the rare “It’s Christmas Time” appear on a Status Quo album for the very first time. It’s the inclusion of these rarities that truly make “Quo’ing In – The Best of the Noughties” a must-have for all the most loyal fans, as well as a product of great interest for all the long-time Status Quo followers who want to enjoy the best of the last two decades by one of the greatest British rock bands of all time."
