        "text": "Post by MrWaistcoat on\n\nWhen Kerrang magazine (1986) asked Rick about the new outside song writer, \"It's no big deal\" was the reply\n\nQuo of course regularly raided his songs, and had hits with 5 of them. Rick took one for his solo album. There's one on backbone.\n\nKind of did become a big deal, didn't it?\n\nThere's three of his songs on TPAOY. Three songs on one album is a lot... (Unfortunately for me I don't like any of them. I think I do like most of the others. I cannot listen to All That Counts Is Love without wanting to smash something ðŸ˜Š)\n\nHis impact on the band hasn't been discussed much\n\nThere's enough of his songs covered by Quo to fill an album. Catchy but not nearly as good as classic Quo singles.. Maybe \"12 Bronze Bars\" would work as a title\n\nHis biography is quite interesting. en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_David_(musician). I'd thought Francis had written I didn't mean it!\n\nHow do you rate the songs? Love the one on Rick's album,thats probably my favourite of the lot. Used to rate Red Sky but have gone off it.\n\nIf you've not seen his website, take a look. There's probably songs there that Quo haven't recorded yet!\n\njohndavidmusic.co.uk/\n\nPost by Dark on\n\nI think Rollinâ€™ Home is a decent typical Quo rocker, and obviously lyrically it made sense for their return in 1986. Red Sky I like, a little bit different for the band as well.\n\nIâ€™d forgotten that, I Didnâ€™t Mean It, was written by him, but Iâ€™ve pretty much stayed away from that album since its release. Was pretty disappointed with the tune when it was released as a single, though not as disappointed as I was a couple of weeks later when I got my hands on the album.\n\nHis songs for TPAOY I find pretty much unlistenable, but then I donâ€™t find much on that album worth playing.\n\nConversely, the track, Better Take Care, is the stand out track on the Backbone album for me.\n\nReally though his contribution to the band is a bit of a footnote in their history, six songs none of which are classics or particularly well known out with real dedicated followers of the band. I dare say though that he has made quite a decent living out his contributions to the band, so that might bother him so much.\n\nPost by paradiseflats on\n\nHe has a long term partnership with Dave Edmunds.\n\nHis writing has been used by a number of big acts.\n\nHe began his musical career playing drums in his father's dance band Avalon. By 1968 he was playing bass guitar and sang backing vocals in Edmunds' first major group, Love Sculpture, best remembered for their 1968 top ten hit single \"Sabre Dance\". At that time he used the name John Williams.\n\nAfter Love Sculpture split in 1970 he concentrated on studio and session work, songwriting and engineering, as well as collaborating with Edmunds on his number one single \"I Hear You Knocking\", playing bass, piano, and percussion. In 1975, David played bass guitar and did some backing vocals on Andy Fairweather Low's album, La Booga Rooga.[2] In 1978 his group Airwaves recorded an album and single New Day. The single, performed a cappella, never reached the charts, but was heavily played on radio at the time. A choral version was later recorded by the King's Singers. The song has been covered by some 150 artists around the world. The song \"So Hard Living Without You\" got significant airplay in America.\n\nThroughout the years he had maintained his involvement with Edmunds, and after Edmunds' group Rockpile disbanded in 1980, David returned to working with him, writing and co-writing several songs on Edmunds' solo albums, including Information (1983), Riff Raff (1984), and Closer to the Flame (1990), as well as contributing backing vocals, bass and other instruments, and playing live on all the tours during the 1980s.\n\nIn 1983 he signed another solo recording deal and released a solo single, \"On The Mountain\", which was a minor hit in Germany.\n\nAt the same time he established a reputation as a songwriter for other artists. His first Top 10 success being \"She Means Nothing to Me\", a UK No. 9 hit for Phil Everly and Cliff Richard in 1983, on which he played lead guitar.[3] Further success came with \"I Won't Run Away\", recorded by Alvin Stardust and a No. 7 hit in 1984, followed by \"Rollin' Home\", \"Red Sky\", \"I Didn't Mean It\", \"The Party Ain't Over Yet\", and \"All That Counts Is Love\", all hit singles for Status Quo.\n\nHe also built his own recording studio, Berry Hill, in the Forest of Dean, mainly to record his own song demos.\n\nIn 1991, he produced the Shakin' Stevens Christmas album on which he had written or co-written a number of songs. He continues to work with Stevens and others at the Berry Hill Studio.\n\nFor those interested as above he released 3 albums of songs artists used over the years including Status Quo and Rick.\n\nI will post my opinion later.\n\nPost by mortified on\n\nHaving listened to many of John David's originals, I have found that Quo haven't always done them justice and that his versions are quite often better.\n\nI'm not sure how he became involved with the band. Being a session musician and songwriter I dare say he just ran into them along the way, although Dave Edmunds did produce both Rollin' Home and Red Sky so maybe there's a connection there somewhere. He doesn't seem to have been on board prior to that.\n\nI know it's generally despised by many but I personally adore All That Counts Is Love and me and Mrs Mortified even used it for walking out to after the ceremony when we got married. So there\n\nA large proportion of his songs that Quo have covered have been singles. Again, I have no idea why that might be. Maybe John David still has the negatives\n\nPost by I Ain't Complaining on\n\nHe writes catchy pop songs which are radio friendly. Quo 'quo them up' and bit, and they are often the songs on the album which have been more suited to being released. A few haven't made it as singles, like Kick Me When I'm Down for example.\n\nI have recently listened to his albums (just before Backbone was released) and I generally prefer Quo's versions of his songs. Imo Quo's version of Better Take Care is brilliant, I much prefer it over the original.\n\nAlthough they bring out the more poppy side of Quo, I do like all the John David songs that they've used. I too like All That Counts is Love mortified! Great choice for your wedding!"
