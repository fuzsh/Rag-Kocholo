        "text": "0:35\n\nHello, thanks so much for your company. I hope you’re ready for some good old-fashioned rock. Because my guest today has been part of one of Britain’s longest running bands, a group that managed to notch up more chart hits than any rock band in the UK. Any idea who I’m referring to? Absolutely, it was status quo. And I’m very pleased to introduce you to the band’s original drummer John Coughlin, who today plays with his own band called John Copland’s quote, we did a little gig recently and it was great it what it is it’s playing some of that close stuff in my head and turn it into like a slightly different jazz feel. But it’s worked out very well. You’ve certainly come a long way, haven’t you? You’ve played every genre of music and your time. Yeah, I think I have well we go to what we call the Old Boys lunch twice a year in London and it’s all musicians from our past and I’ve played with lots of them and they still bang them as partners in crime there was also all sorts of different things and applied innovating and Eric Bell and all loads of different musicians and just so it was it was great.\n\n2:12\n\nYou still as passionate about music as you were when you first set out? Yeah, I think so. I someone said that because on my website, there’s a little thing. So you know, John Coltrane is retiring. I actually hate that word. And I said, Don’t be silly. I’m not doing that. But I just still like playing and I think every musician will tell you that I think once you start playing, you enjoy it. If someone says to me, would you rather record or upload to a live audience? I’ve mentioned this many times. I’d rather do a live gig and be in a studio for days on end, you know, but having said that, as you know we’ve made obviously involved with 14 albums So Bob young Jama recently I didn’t realize I recorded some any. Now I want to talk to you about all of those albums. Explain to us how Matchstick Men came about because it was really a breakthrough hit wasn’t it? There was Francis Rossi wrote that a home and he said because the family were all there it was written in his toilet at home.\n\n3:06 Men often say that’s where they do their best thinking yeah well I suppose is the only place to get a patient quiet you know literally go to a music room with a big lock on it\n\n4:24\n\nWhen you say that you’d prefer to be playing a live gig rather than in the recording studio? Why is that? What’s the rush that you get from playing in front of people are it’s just lovely that you know they all come to see you all comes through the bank rather, at the end they’ll share in the shouting and screaming for more. It’s a lovely feeling. It’s great. It’s like you’ve entertain those people for an hour and a half or two hours depending along the playbook. And it’s just so nice to say well that was nice to see you after the show and like you know shake and wonderful autograph or some and it is so nice and dark. Like being in studio. I remember when you did the call\n\n5:00\n\nalbums, you know, like, I’d go to the hotel or whatever I’m trying to go to bed I have this song in my head, it’s been going around for hours. The same song. I mean, at times there’s recording it 20 doing 20 takes in finding out, we listen back to all the time, actually chose a second one. We didn’t need to buy all those others, some people prefer some guys prefer to be in the studio and be on the road. But I’d rather play live concert. I remember co recording in Holland many, many years ago. And we had this massive bang. Like I’m like a massive explosion. What the hell was that we stopped playing calls and the lights went out. And what happened I remember this, we walked outside, all the office, people that were in the studio, they’ll run outside. And what happened had been a thunderstorm. Their lightning hit a tree. And I could still pitch this tree in the outside the front doors, and the tree was black all down the middle is split in the middle of electricity went through the tree and under the ground. So we’re lucky we’ve got all the pieces, but I never forgotten that we wonder what it was it was repaired. We carried on, you know as you do. You’ll pretty young at the time were two wouldn’t take anything too seriously when we were younger. It’s only when you get a bit older that you realize the consequences that could have been talking about when you were younger. John, is it true that he left school at 15 to start an apprenticeship as a mechanic, but you attended drumming lessons under a guy called Lloyd Ryan who actually taught Phil Collins the drums at the at the time too. Is that right? Well, what happened was, my dad got me this job. And I spent I don’t know how many months there and I realized doing this job, but helping the mechanics out you get dirty filthy hands and greasy and covered in oil and many moons after that. I left and did something else and then 1968 6768 pitches and maximum man was recording released. And we ended up having to go up to Manchester and do some of the Pops. How did you get to play in the band anyway in the first place? When I was scored as a guy my Glasgow Steven Ainsworth’s and he said, John, you like aeroplane salsa? Yeah, especially military planes. He said, Well, don’t show the rest of the class. I’m in the Air Cadets Air Training Corps. And so we cycled up. They took me up there next weekend on our cycles. I met the commanding officer. I got measured up for a uniform. My dad was proud. My granddad is proud of how you know lovely. You’re gonna join the Air Force. And anyway, so we put a little groups together in the squadron is the three of us was two guys kept coming in same communities. And anyway, so they started about two or three times and they said, What are you doing anything with this? I said, No, not really. We’re just in the cadet. Would you come and join our band, which I did the following weekend and my dad sent me down there and bring me drums. I don’t know how he did it because I don’t have a car unless I borrowed one I got a taxi or something like this one says Roxton and Lancaster by the way. And they sell John’s arrived with his dad and they must have a few bob because they’ve turned up in a taxi\n\n8:09\n\nThat band was called Scorpions, wasn’t it? Well, I think it was called the scorpions as it was called something else. And then we settled on a name called the Spectres and we did release the Spectres name of a song called I have nothing but it was a Shirley Bassey single and we did a rock version of it. And I still think it’s been played somewhere on some record by somebody.\n\n9:07\n\nthen the magical Pete Barlow come up with this slime tool Status Quo, which is all I suppose our day we don’t know. But previous to that, before we started, Scott we did we won a competition to go to play in Butlins for six weeks, this summer holiday camp. In those days you’ve been allowed to sell on the campus as an entertainer yet to get a b&b, which really wasn’t nice, you know. So you got on immediately with the other guys. Yeah, it was Francis Rossi and a guy called Jessie Boskie. Who’s he was English but his parents are Polish I believe. Then, Jess. I think I had another one just left and we got Ryan lines to play keyboards. He was on Matchstick Men say with a band for five years. Then it just I remember travelling on a train somewhere years ago. And Roy said I’ve just had enough of this. And so the pull up to the rail thing where you put your bag and he gone. He walks off the train was always going to get a coffee or somebody you know in the in the restaurant car and it was hilarious. And the trains pulling out the station. Then we saw him walking down the platform waving goodbye. He got off he left. We played a gig that night without Yeah, when someone said, oh god that sounds so much better without gables. And it’s funny. Where did the name status quo come from? I think it was my manager at the time I don’t know where really found the name but he said it’s mean says you are something we stopped doing name them. There was ice in the sun in our chair changed the whole thing. That was great. We grew hair long. But well, jeans and T shirts previous to that it was all like frilly shirts and jackets and you know certainly coloured trousers and trying to be popstars.\n\n12:01\n\nwe got rid of the daddy mentioned, Bob Young said play colleges universities changed the whole music set. And we just played the blues and some rock and roll it works out well. It worked out better than you could have ever imagined really didn’t. Yeah, it was great. You know, we felt much more at home doing that. And I remember there was one place we played with some college or university somewhere years ago. And this character came up to us backstage and said you know my name is whatever it was I introduced the band and we’d all said in the meeting that we wanted to just be one of those bands that just walks on and plays without being announced you know call you know if they sign love and dogs and this character insisted on and now it’s in the band so we thought God Okay, let him do it. Anyway, so remember this guy was full of you can smell cannabis is college university. And it was you know if you just put your nose on stage you can go yeah, this character walks on stage and he gets a round of applause from these students and everything else and they will cheer Hello guys and I think he says something like Welcome to tonight’s show. I know you’ve been might’ve this band for years I’ve managed to get them ladies and gentlemen will you give a big welcome to their here if we got a we were forgot the band’s name yeah and he was so insistent on announcing stages story he was obviously one good out of it was smelling the dome and he he just thought he was great. We went down very well.\n\n14:41\n\nme my career and me all the traumas that I’ve admired. Like Brian Bennett in the shadows. Brian’s great. I was with Brian the other day. The old boys lunch in London. Bobby Elliot from the holidays.\n\n14:52\n\nThis Hello Simon Phillips met ginger. My favourite part of the lot was Buddy Rich. I was very lucky to just spent two hours with Buddy Rich many years ago because I was playing premier drums. Anyway, we went overseas concert and I think it was some of that call was in Manchester he was in I think summit like Preston Guild Hall. With his sell out concert, we were our concert, is to be walked into the concert hall. And his role is with Johnny Cash. And\n\n15:22\n\nwe spent two hours talking about drums and touring the world. And we got like a house on fire because I was told he can be really useful, you know, they could be quite awkward. And there was a girl there interviewing him and me. And she said, Nobody, you’re the best drummer in the world. What do you think of this long-haired bloke? I was down here playing in a rock band. And I remember this to this day. He was very kind and he said, Well, man, there’s no need for that. He’s doing his job. I’m doing my yes. He said, John ever play play my drums on No. And I sit on his kit now taps away, you know, trying to do something that I could get away with. And he said that sounds great, John. Yeah, you know, he sort of better go and have a drink. Anyway, I knew that stage buddy never allowed any be found to drink alcohol? Yeah, no, not no alcohol at all. So be drunk. I’ve got a fixture. here somewhere, give us toasting each other with a cup of coffee, you know?\n\n16:22\n\nReasonably got on I think was because I didn’t ask him. Could you show me how to do a sec. And I just think we just spoke about things happening in the world. It was lovely. I was never forgotten that it was great. I’m chatting with John Cobden for the status quo. John, can you describe what it was like? In the 60s? It was really the heyday of music, particularly in Britain wasn’t it was when everybody was coming up. And the scene was just happening. I was great. I mean, I remember so slowly, we supported Jody Lewis, the kings with loads of tours. We did a Gene Pitney around the early days of Avon calling up Don Partridge, or various other people. I remember one thing we did, which was I’d like to see it again. It was a tour of Australia, flying from Heathrow, London to Sydney. I think it was with Status Quo Slade, Lindisfarne, and a band called Caravan. On the same tour. It was hilarious. And when we did the internal flying in Australia announcer airlines, we found out that someone had put three or four detectives on the plane. And they always sat at the back. And I was I think they were expecting us to play havoc on the plane. It was funny because every time we got on a plane that’s sitting there, which is why even Hi guys, how are you know? I remember the last day getting off the plane and thank you guys. Thanks for Scotland is around Australia find anybody No, but they were so pissed off that I didn’t know.\n\n17:49\n\nWe were watching. We knew who they were. It was great. And those were the days weren’t they? I must say I remember that tour. It was huge. Back in a sec with more.\n\n18:01\n\nThis is a breath of fresh air with Sandy Kaye. It’s a beautiful day.\n\n18:07\n\nGreat to have you here. We’re talking all things status quo. And if you happen to be listening in the US and don’t recognize their sound, it’s because the band was largely ignored in Northern America after they abandoned psychedelia for their heavy Boogie bluesy rock in the early 70s.\n\n19:02\n\nDid life change for you? Yeah, I think it does. I think people want to just come and see status, got signing lots of autographs and things that grew the hair long got denim jeans and T shirts and heads down Boogie and all that, you know, that’s what it was about. And that changed everything. I did it for about 20 years, America was still ignoring status quo at that time with that. Yeah, I think what we should have done, if I’d had my way I think we would have would have uprooted from England and gone and lived in the States for a year and toured America and pushed ourselves because I think Fleetwood Mac did that. And I think some other bands, you know, I think See, I remember you could play in Texas, and you play in Indiana, or whatever you call it. And then California in one state, they’ve heard of you another state they’ve even how to another site. They remember you from the record that was an radio and it’s really difficult. It’s such a big place and I think you need to spend lots of time there. We were spoiled.\n\n20:00\n\nSo, because we were big in Europe and big in the UK, yeah, like a promotion I think probably in America. That’s what it was really? Did that frustrate you? I think it did. But like I said, we don’t quite get to go back home to England because we we knew we were big in England, United Kingdom, Scandinavia, and some other countries you know, it just we were so pleased to be back. But I must admit America in those days and seven says, I must admit we did so there a lot and you know what I never saw and all the time we spent that. Never saw a gun. Never saw any trouble. Now think I think twice about culture America now. I can’t work out what’s gone wrong there. Ice in the sand that was written by a former British pop star Marty Wilde became your second top.\n\n20:47\n\nMoney while was huge at the time, wasn’t he? Yeah, Marty. Yeah, I think he’s still around now. I think he’s, he’s tomorrow, I believe. And he wrote it for us. And that was great. You know, it was just nice to have people writing good songs for us and coach the band Bob young Rick path and Lancaster Francis wrote some good stuff. And as Bob did, and you know, it’s just nice to read, read go some of their songs and some of the stuff we all got a chip in like it blows on beside.\n\n21:59\n\nThe image change had enhanced the appeal of status quo, even though you were almost like a completely different bandwidth. Yeah, I think we progressed along as we went along. I think really, the early Matchstick Men days we enjoyed playing to audiences, of course, but I think we still felt a bit with that image out of place. We didn’t feel in our hearts. It was right somehow. And so we moved on thank God to Bob young for changing everything because as you know, it works. Yeah, it sure did. In 1972 of the Redding and Grandwest and festivals, you really became hot property. You got a record deal and your first single for that new label was one called paper plane. And that just rocketed into the top 10 in 73 Yeah, you were just in demand everywhere. How could you maintain such a hectic schedule at the time and have any sort of relationships at home? I mean, your feet wouldn’t have touched the ground over no I know there’s a story goes our first wives and I think we’ve all right first ones who doesn’t these days and they didn’t want us to go away oh no, you can’t go away. It was just sort of I was just got married you married a musician, a working musician cause we’re gonna go and sort of notice that\n\nwe play lots of festival running festivals. Great Lincolnshire festivals. We played loads of festivals you were huge deal wherever you went. And once you seem to find the formula that worked you kept rolling it out you kind of recycled that same simple booking on each of the albums and singles that came didn’t you?\n\n23:33\n\nYeah, I think it was we realized that it was all working properly.\n\n24:54\n\nWe all like to drink you know and some of the guys smoked but somehow when you get back to your accommodation ..hotel whatever it is, it takes three, three hours to calm down. Before you can actually crash out you know, it always goes to one of the bounce rooms, grab a drink some wine or some or some beer, then say yeah, good night and see in the morning and then meet for breakfast and then carry on again. That’s how it was John Copeland, you doing this Boogie all through the 70s you killing them wherever you’re playing, each album that you released went into the top five. And of course, you had that huge number one single down down in 1974. Can you shed some light on that one? Well, I think it was a magnificent bust for the bank seeing that we actually made a single go to number one. There was somebody played that the audience would imagine. Massive cheers for it. And they sing all the words and it’s awesome. And I just think I’ve had fans say to me, Oh, John, you know, you’ve made 14 albums, and which is your favourite album? What would you say was your best single your best album? And I said, Look, we’ve made 14 And I always thought at the time your last album was the thought was is your best because you play at home. I don’t really plan he says it’s closer to home now at all really? And I don’t think I would really did when I was touring because you’re used to playing on stage. You know why don’t listen to at home. But you know, downtown was one of our favorites mystery song was another one that I liked and Rick, Rick sung that and too much so I remember what was your best album your best single either way say the best thing to do is offer stagers qualified Now Charlie Bucha is the best.\n\n27:23\n\nArtists often tell me that during that hectic period, when you’re really on top that it goes by in such a blur that your feet don’t touch the ground, you’ve got no memory of it. People say to me, Oh, I missed the 80s. Or I missed the 70s. Because we were so busy all the time. I can really understand that because you were just on the go constantly. You don’t actually take time out to smell the roses at all? No, I think it is. There was a saying in those days. If we weren’t recording, we were touring. And if a word touring, we were recording, you know, then we would have a little bit of time at home. But I don’t think it was enough. And I think we should have had longer. But having said that, it’s easy to jump off the bandwagon and spend too much time at home then what you don’t want to do at the time is lose your fans. You want to keep your fans because they’ve been good to you. And I mean now, I played recently down in Butlins in Minehead where we all started, and fans are coming up to me at the end St. John, it’s lovely sick and either folks who don’t like to do a signing session for hour and a half. And I said to my wife, Julie, I said, Look, this is what I did. I left in 81 It’s like I’m still with the band, you know, fans I’ve been, I’ve always wanted a photo with you. Did you sign this green sign the t shirt. When you get those fans and they stick with you through that period, they never leave you. That certainly proved to be the case with status quo because the League of fans just kept growing as each bogey kept rolling out. And I guess you really did the right thing. All those albums all those singles just kept perpetuating the name of status quo. So it was always on the top of the charts. You got to sunlight rollover lay down in 75 It was very similar to down down in 74 It was very similar to wild side of life in 76 they all intertwined and melded into each other really didn’t that was it rollover down was so much shorter. Remember earlier, that’s when we all co wrote all of us. Yeah, that was good. It was a song that the audience loved that. And I think you know, I didn’t as you know, I didn’t really write songs, but the lads thing. And I think you know, one song was probably Dare I say possibly Nick from the other song, you know, bits of ideas and things but having said that, they’re all good songs that turned out well, audience love. So we did the right thing really.\n\n30:42\n\nSomehow music started going through a whole lot of different changes in itself in the late 70s, didn’t it? After the release in 1980 of the song just supposing you got up and left the band in an extraordinary fashion. What happened? Had you simply had enough? Well, I think it was a combination of us probably not getting on, I think we were possibly worn out a bit. And the guys are doing quite a bit of Bob Hope. And I was just having a glass of wine now and again. And there was something terribly wrong with my my headset. And I think we were all tired. And I just basically, I got to the point where I just needed a massive break. I needed to get away from it for a while. And I just think I’ve had an affair. And I think I got back home to Ireland where I was living at the time. I mean surely took I took a year off to recuperate and I think we went on holidays and I got back home then I realized I needed to play drums again.\n\n31:47\n\nSo it’s in your blood? Yeah, John what were the circumstances around you’re leaving from what I’ve been told that appeared to be a really sudden decision? You just got up from the drums and called it quits. Can you tell us in your words how it came about? Well I think it was the band we’re going to involve and lots of things I shouldn’t have done and I wasn’t happy about it. I think we’re all exhausted I think we were tired what we should have done is that time off obviously didn’t see I wasn’t very happy and I don’t know it’s it’s difficult to explain just had enough instead of then next day based on all we’ve got to the Beaumont is use a drum machine and I burst out laughing So you tell me a drum machine can do is shuffle it can’t do a shuffle like me and then they insist they’ll know we were doing this in our Lancaster was so now we’re gonna be right in the morning which is normal you know it’s normal for me to be okay. If we don’t x y and Zed the night before and shouting whatever having a route by we see they got Pekerja to fly out and then fly but then I think unalike is the one we want you to get me back to do more is that massive concert Live Aid I wanted me to do that I never got the phone calls so I saw well you know then the only turn up was on 13 and 14 Much later on you know we all got back together again. But while you were sitting in that studio at the time and you were totally fed up the story is that you were tapping around and then you got up and kicked the whole drum kit apart walked out of the studio and that was that is that how I think\n\n33:34\n\nI just think what we should have done is all stopped recording at the time gone and this is one of the rooms of shadows sat down and talked about it but that never happened. No one could be bothered so you know you get to the point well let’s talk about it\n\n35:06\n\nJohn Coghlin was known to fans as bad or the med took. He was a sullen, mustachioed and mysterious figure behind the drum kit, and according to reports was sometimes prone to volatile outbursts of temper. Mostly however, he kept to himself, as he’s already alluded to as status quo as popularity saw during the 70s and into the next decade, so did their drug intake. The members became the cocaine gang. And if you weren’t doing it, you were excluded. That’s really what happened to John. With the madness escalating around him, he remained an outcast. On that fateful day in 1981, he just snapped kicked his drums across the room and then boarded a flight from Switzerland, where the group had been working to his home on the Isle of Man. Don’t go anywhere. John Coghlan is just getting warmed up.\n\n36:01\n\nThis is a breath of fresh air with Sandy Kaye, it’s a beautiful day.\n\n36:08\n\nWelcome back. Status Quo drummer John Coghlan has been sharing his story about the band’s beginnings, its rise to fame and that crazy rock and roll lifestyle complete with drugs and alcohol that cost him his place in the group, when he left quote quickly picked up the pieces by hiring Pete Kershaw. Their 1982 album, one plus nine plus eight plus two was the first feature paid on drums. I guess they wrote this song in John’s honour.\n\n37:15\n\nWith all of this going on, John Coghlin managed to keep himself busy touring and recording with multiple projects and bands. Some four years later, bass player Alan Lancaster also quit status quo, leaving Francis Rossi and guitarist vocalist Derek Parfit to carry on the name. By the mid 90s status quo had scored 50 British hit singles which was more than any other band in rock’n’roll history of the time. I’ve got to tell you what happens when you leave a band it’s no like that. You soon know who your who your friends are.\n\n37:51\n\nYou want to make a phone call to someone and they still make an escape because you’re not in the band anymore. So you think okay, fine. I can do without those people. And I did I think we’re partners in crime I made an album. Yeah, single was called We Are The Boys Who Make all the Noise.\n\n38:58\n\nif you look at the video that is still about, you’ll see both bourbon in pseudo miming to the drums I did, because I did a session because obviously why someone I don’t I can’t remember what happened now. But I couldn’t make the video shoot. It made a nice change. So after you’d been rockin all over the world, you settled back took a bit of time out the bugs still had you and you started playing with a whole load of other people until you then started your own bad. Yeah, I think I got a call from a friend of mine. Lancashire is an agent and he said why don’t you put the bands together that plays with your close stuff is because you’re entitled to go out on the road with another band playing all the hits you had in which I did you know and then the John Coghlan disco. I did that for quite a long time. And it was good, but I think having to play drums with those other musicians did help me in a big way, you know, playing different music so and it was a nice little test that for me and I was really happy with that.\n\n40:00\n\nSo despite the tensions that had been around between you and Rick and Francis and Alan Lancaster, you managed to reunite for a special one off session in 2012. How did they talk you into coming back to do that? What is that? I think it was Alan G. Parker, who’s a friend of ours. And he got this idea about getting the four of us together to play together and Shepperton Studios in England. And it was basically a studio for making movies, because soundproofing on the walls and ceilings and even the floor, right. And the drum sander was what I call very dry. It was horrible. And I’ve my lovely lovely drumkit, which I’ve still got from the pictures and match them men days, necessarily the same on that Ringo had the same color and everything. Anyway, you know, I’m playing now. Then we spent I think, was it to two weeks, I think we rehearse on topic. No, did we just get together once? That’s what I think we did them. There was talk of at all, but I said yeah, I’m up for it. And Alan wasn’t. And very can, Francis, me spent two weeks rehearsing for the British tour. I think it was and that was the first tour you’ve done together in some 32 years. Yeah, it was it was quite strange, it felt quite different. The four original members of status quo came to be widely known as the frantic for it was back to rockin all over the world.\n\n42:26\n\nI was totally sober at the time, no drinking, which is fine, you know, whatever. But then as I said, we should always do a tour of Europe. And I should I think personally we should have come to Australia and did it. So it was but also what was initially a lot of you didn’t know this. But when we finished the last stumbling gig, it was it was filmed, you know, get the DVD out where they filmed the concert. And that was good fun. And Rick Parfitt said to Francis now, I’d like to carry on doing this as an intern. What CO does now? And I said yeah, I’m up for it. And Alan was, anyway, fancy the monitor. He said, No, I want to do is what we’re doing. You know, later. And Henrik, he said, I’m not you know, I don’t really want to do that. And France has come up with the idea. Why don’t you call it the status quo? PLC? PLC? Yeah, perfect language from Kotlin. Which would have actually gotten a musician’s play fake Francis place. Goes without that could have been okay. But he was doing solo stuff. And was he. Now I think Cole was probably still together, we really wanted another tour, perhaps. But, of course, then direct passed away. Rick died, you know, and that was, that was a shame. But what everyone’s been saying, is that thank God for 13 and 14 tours, because if we just said, Oh, well, maybe one day we’ll do it then cause there’s no signs always then too late. But thank God we did 13 and 14 for the fans. I mean, I was told you’ll love this story. We was told an Australian family flew to London to catch her three shows their Miss was right. They clocked all three shows. So think of the fare, the tickets, the cost of staying in a hotel. Yeah. Then they flew back to Australia.\n\n44:22\n\nThen, I presume, went back to work. What they did, then flew back again, for the last gig in Dublin. Now think of that. That’s diehard fans. Yeah. And also someone told me that a lot of the men they saw in the audience on those shows were actually crying because it’s circling back to their days. You know, when whatever when I got married on baby, they had a passing whatever, took them back to the younger days when those singles were just released. You know, now it was really so it was lovely. It was great. It was very emotional. It was good fun. We all enjoyed it.\n\n46:09\n\nWould have ever thought that we’d be talking about status quo? 50 something years later? My No, it’s amazing. And also, I’m also going to be doing something with a local radio called Whitney radio, and I think they’re changing names, but I’ve all done one show with them. And I’m doing a thing John Coltrane, rock COVID And what it is, I decided that I wanted my own program of playing music, that I like Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, ACDC loads of different types of music, I wrote a big list of songs are here, and I think are gonna have fun.
