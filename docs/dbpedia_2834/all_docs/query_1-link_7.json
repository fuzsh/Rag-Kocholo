An album completely produced by Dave Edmunds would have been a very different beast, he may have been able to make something of even the popiest numbers on ITAN.\n\nThis thread really ties in with the previous one on production styles, the clash between Pip, Paxman and Rossi and their varied results. As people said the essential thing for any producer is to get the \"vibe\" of who they're producing. Dave Edmunds I think did this really well. Francis seemed to seesaw between what he wanted Quo to sound like \"Thirsty Work\" and what he thought the fans wanted Quo to sound like \"RTYD\", an album I thought he did a sterling job with, his best production till \"Backbone\".\n\nPaxman has singularly failed to understand Quo's sound and fanbase. The work he did with Judie Tzuke I think is really good, some great albums but he just doesn't seem to be able transition to a heavier rock sound. For me the work he did with Uriah Heep and Asia was utterly dismal too and in no way fitted the legacy of either band. The albums he's produced for Quo for me are all their weakest output.\n\nPip Williams is a really talented guy but he's also an inveterate meddler. He has to impose \"his sound\" on any project he's involved with. I remember playing keyboards on a friend's album back in 86 with Pip producing. It was crystal clear, fantastic quality work but listening to the final mix there was also a certain sterility, a lack of individuality and of course the ever present Pip guitar sound and his own twiddly little solos that make his production style so instantly recognizable.\n\nBut as for Quo's 86 comeback it could have been such a different story. Dave Edmunds producing the whole album, instead of going with Rhino and Jeff Rich, sticking with Pete Kircher and persuading first choice of replacement bass player Jim Lea of Slade to take the job. We could really have had a rock force to be reckoned with, especially with Jim's superlative writing and producing skills. Instead of which we got Pip's syrupy pop and Bernie Frost's squeaking.\n\nPost by twentytwenty on\n\n@bluehighway said:\n\nI suppose Pip was looked on as a safe pair of hands to try and make something out of the trainwreck that was Quo then, lawsuits, alcohol, coke, poor writing, Francis seeing the future in a radically different light now he wasn't fettered by Alan.

They even managed to make the great Invatation lifeless, just listen to that old demo on one of the deluxes, just as simple, but much more lively\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\n@bluehighway said:\n\nFrancis seemed to seesaw between what he wanted Quo to sound like \"Thirsty Work\" and what he thought the fans wanted Quo to sound like \"RTYD\"\n\nWhat makes you say this? What I know if that Francis made Thirsty Work that way because he thought that's what the fans wanted. Not what he wanted.\n\nWhat Francis says in public should always be taken with a pinch of salt. He knows exactly what sound the old fans like and he pretty much gave them that on RTYD. He would be under no illusions, no matter what he said, that \"Thirsty Work\" would be complete anathema to most hardcore fans. Feigning surprise when it didn't do well is Francis all over.\n\nAs for Rhino, yes he's a competent bassist and a decent songwriter. Is he in the same ballpark in terms of all round ability and skill as Jim Lea? Most definitely not.\n\nThe question of whether Dave Edmunds would have produced a rockier album than Pip could be argued ad nauseam. He would certainly have produced a more organic, less sterile album.\n\nPost by twentytwenty on\n\n@bluehighway said:\n\nWhat makes you say this?

There is definitely no signs that there even was a second producer on those tracks.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\n@bluehighway said:\n\nWhat Francis says in public should always be taken with a pinch of salt.

We obviously differ on how we view Dave Edmunds' work, it doesn't mean either of us is right or wrong."
