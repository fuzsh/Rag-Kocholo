        "text": "Ear Music/Edel [Release date : 12.07.24]\n\nIf ever a band knew how to mine a rich back catalogue it’s Status Quo. We’ve said that before and no doubt we’ll say it again, and again.\n\nThis third “Archive” release, Live at Westonbirt Arboretum, was recorded 16 years ago this month. The gig was part of the ‘Forest Live’ programme, initiated by The Forestry Commission (once a UK wide organisation), and you can’t get much more rock’n’roll than that.\n\nThe recording has been remixed and remastered by studio tech wizard, Eike Freese (sometime guitarist with Kai Hansen’s band) at his Hamburg studios. The result is a notable punch and clarity to all 21 tracks of Quo’s live sound here.\n\nLike Archive Volumes 1 and 2, Volume 3 displays the the band’s unchanging MO . . . just a bunch of denim clad boogie warriors, rehearsed to perfection, sparking off each other, talking to and playing to the crowd like they’ve known them all their lives (and in some cases, they have).\n\nThere’s some variation, but the set list from one volume to another hasn’t changed much. Quo know how to work a crowd.\n\nThe 10 minute ‘Proposin Medley’ is the set’s centrepiece, and if your head’s not nodding and your feet’re not tapping by the time that ten minutes is up, then check yourself for a pulse.\n\nWe’re again treated to solid gold crowdpleasers, ‘Paper Plane’ and ‘Roll Over Lay Down’. ‘Whatever You Want’ and ‘Rockin All Over The World’ aren’t far behind.\n\nWe also get the opportunity to devote more of our attention to the perfect pop-boogie of ‘Caroline’ and of course to the late Rick Parfitt’s major songwriting contributions to the Quo cannon, ‘Living On An Island’ and ‘Rain’.\n\nAnd we shouldn’t forget their UK No.1 hits, ‘Down Down’ and ‘In The Army Now’. They’re all here.\n\nRoll on Volume 4. ***1/2\n\nReview by Brian McGowan\n\nFeatured Artist: JOSH TAERK\n\nSince early 2020 Josh has been entertaining us with exclusive monthly live sessions, streamed via Facebook.\n\nIn 2023 he signed a recording deal with Sony in Canada and released a new single on 15 September.\n\nLatest session: Sunday 26 May\n\nNext session: Sunday 29 September\n\nCheck out videos here: https://www.facebook.com/getreadytorockradio\n\nDavid Randall presents a weekly show on Get Ready to ROCK!
