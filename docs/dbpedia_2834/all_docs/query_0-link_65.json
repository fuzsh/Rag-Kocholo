        "text": "I was born in 1969 and from a young age, the only thing I was interested in was art, specifically drawing, and anything other than what was on offer on the school curriculum in the 70’s and 80's.\n\nLooking back, I’ve had an overriding interest in all levels of counter culture and expression, my whole life. Also, in retrospect, it was clear that the majority of my peers would grow up to become bankers and insurance brokers, like mini-me’s of their parents. Which, growing up in Surrey, holds no conspiracy within its own natural equation. However, ask most people whose interests in their early teens are more likely to be black metal rather than cricket — the sense of subcultural outlier-dom only fuels further your sense of individualism, but still your own need to find your tribe. A place to belong.\n\nAt 14 years old, my father took me to my first gig. It was UFO at Hammersmith Odeon. A venue now immortalised in my life as a place of historic interest and worship. Now I had discovered the power of music. Not pop music but rock music. An assault on all the senses; in the concourse and bar the smell of patchouli oil, old Holborn, warm beer and denim and leather, off set against the fresh ink of newly printed tour merchandise. Then into the arena all senses are secondary to the colossal wall of sound coming from the stage. Looking back behind me as the lights are turned on the audience; the sparkle of patch thread and the skin of palms held aloft, momentarily spring out of the murk. This culture was injected into my DNA that night, never to leave my blood stream.\n\nThe original hook for me (being so young) was simply any record with a fantastical cover. The first album I bought was AC/DC’s ‘If you want blood’. The image of Angus Young spearing himself through the guts with the neck of his Gibson SG, held too many questions for a young man — plus! As soon as the needle hit the vinyl I was supercharged, with what felt like both freedom and some sort of new cathartic energy.\n\nI’m now 55, living in a time of post self help and awakening — I would define it as: “like anger without consequence”. A 1980’s form of solitary living room or bedroom based therapy.\n\nMaybe there’s no argument\n\nThere’s always going to be the status quo and counter-culture will also always exist in varying degrees, as a yin to the yang of the more common norm. Status Quo the band however, they have re tarmacked the end of the road at least twenty times since 1984, and are now a sterling example of how all outlets of youthful expression will, at some point, become exchanged for nostalgia. But at some point in the early 60’s they too would have been different or novel enough to suggest a micro-movement of their own. Even if it was just a wash of matching faded denim and waistcoats catching the eye, in front of what in essence was really just blues, but getting faster and louder over the course of the first five albums.\n\nTo conclude then?\n\nThere’s always going the be distinct varying degrees of counter culture and rebellion and expression, end of essay. But that would be boring, if not just very short. I’m interested to know if every generation, once they hit their mid-life, thinks that (their version) of rock & roll is dead? Or is the current younger generations version, too undefined in comparison — to even be properly aware of now?\n\nRock & roll-\n\nis by definition a musical sensation, originating in the 40’s and 50’s, closely associated with the social (then phenomena) of young people expressing themselves, perhaps more than they may have done previously. In turn, now, anything with a 4/4 beat or 118/120 beats per minute (bpm) or over, is still associated with having its roots in rock & roll, which within twenty years of its inception, became just ‘rock music’. And all the varying fashion influences and subcultures associated with music, have always had a firm link to the phrase.\n\nSo there we have it\n\nLet’s define what it is now in 2024, and we can wrap this up and get back to Spotify.\n\nNot so simple. Even if, just for the arrogant middle aged pride of the whole thing: We are now in a significant time of plagiarism and regurgitation existing over creating something genuinely feeling like a novel new movement in subculture?\n\nArt has always been a re-packaging of simple and well road tested ideas, and part of the reality of discovering something you love in the arts which sets you on fire, is in fact your youth (if not) your ignorance, to what had previously inspired the band or painter or performance, you are currently digging.\n\nAs an example: if you were listening to Greta Van Fleet six years ago and you were then approximately 16 years old. You might not discover Led Zeppelin until you’re 23! — that’s just the law of the repackaging of Rock & Roll. Each generation has their version. In turn, around the same time, the headscarf may have made a momentary comeback for men with long locks, but for a generation not necessarily inspired by the hippies, but by a Michigan four piece in 2018. However, most decades bring a new movement and with that a reinvented music scene, the traditional trinity of elements being: (1) a new sound (2) a new uniform (3) a new drug. That’s fairly historical. It’s the subcultural meal deal.\n\nSo, there is always some evolutionary thread running through. Even if the visual lineage isn’t there, we might still have been lucky to have a new movement to define an era by. If not one that’s evolutionary, it will be one that’s reactionary to what held the stage before it. For example: in the mid to late 80’s and early 90’s — Acid house / Rave/ Mad-chester/ baggy scene; these pretty much defined a large part of a generation and followed the more self expressionist subcultures of the 80’s such as New wave / New Romantic / Hair metal / Heavy metal. But this new sea of oversized washed out denim, bob haircuts and chemical induced love, with an obligatory bottle of water in hand, bore no natural progressive resemblance to it’s older cousin ‘Indy’ and its step sibling breakfast ‘Goth’, ‘Rock’ and ‘Pop’. It had a more uniformed communistic set of ideals, which enforced more of a blanket of youth in general. Perhaps less separation in tribes. Was this sowing the seeds for a more unified youth culture in the future?\n\nSide note\n\nI am concentrating for the sake of this essay, on British culture. Although in America, the musical tastes do donate very similar fashion led subcultures, with just slight differences, especially around the hardcore and straightedge movement. But in essence, you can still find fairly true common denominators, either side of the pond.\n\nSo do we now have a defining subcultural movement for the late noughties?\n\nOr are we closer to the end of civilisation in some weird predictive way? Humans are still re-inventing themselves by finding fresh new iterations of past loved ideals of expression — what’s this obsession with identity? especially ‘a whole new look and sound’ — what’s the problem Ed?\n\nWell -\n\nI’m intrigued that what we have now is a time where an over mutation of fashions and cultural leanings signpost a stronger current within the majority, towards a lesser tribal society.\n\n(1) suddenly more apparently influenced by the maths of evolution. As we’ve already touched on, subcultures are informed by reaction to the previous generation and the addition of new ingredients to the pot. So it’s only natural that as equations become larger, the figure of the solution is longer. And as a consequence, it is appearing less remarkably individual.\n\n(2) Subcultures and movements and also ‘trends’ have always been influenced positively as well as negatively by politics, and the strength in signals found in the growth of technology.\n\nIt’s no real secret that Instagram is a dopamine loaded inventory of all of your interests in one place. But a lesser discussed notion being the Huxley-esque theory that we are now drowning in choices in what to consume and where to belong.\n\nOne big tribe\n\nSounds a bit like one new world order doesn’t it? — it could be. Maybe the desire to be different has now been gradually repackaged into the individual having no particular one sense of identity at all?\n\n‘SEX’ — once upon a time, in a shop on Kings Road owned by Westwood and McLaren\n\nI know there is right now, all the same levels of pressures on young people to belong: this is the type of hoody your peers are into, these are the shoes which are trending right now, and this is the music your peers are listening to, maybe you like this too, or maybe you’ll take on just a small element of this subculture? a button badge, a pair of DM’s, download only one track. But more interestingly ‘an attitude’ not even reflecting a scene, but just a nod. That’s actually always been the way, so what are we even debating. But with my hands in the air, I still don’t see, similar to past decades, any sub-culturally diverse, visual and aural movements. However, is that more likely to be prejudice of age for all I understand?\n\nDo the kids of today see the difference between the mohawk spiked punks having their photos taken on Kings road in 1979 with the Top shop homage version, or the more real hardcore kids of between then and now. So, what is the outstanding attitude or visual dynamic of now?\n\nMusically, things are arguably as strong as they’ve ever been, in fact there’s some brilliant new music out there, right across the board. But is there a new movement? It’s like the arts are now one big sweet shop stocked to the gills with the classics and alternatives and the boiling pots of influences alike. There’s your Beatles-butterscotch and your Haring-Haribo alongside your Fred again-fudge and your Margate scene-Midget Gems, with a side order of denim and the tried and tested.\n\nFashion wise -the now middle aged man version of the kid who only chose to wear the button badge and the DM’s is the bearded straight guy, who upon closer inspection has coloured nail varnish, finishing off his predominantly normal rugged attire. But not just in allegiance with a trend or movement. No, I suspect more in support of changing times. This being the more important socio-political side of expression and the legacy of non-conformity. How there is in fact, more power in a wider distilled consumption of a movement than there is, in a smaller but more evangelical group, who of course need to come first. But the power is in the wider spread of acceptance.\n\nWe’re now selecting from one large digital platform of pick and mix, and somewhere during our unwitting transition to more choice, we have adopted a tone more of one tribe, rather than tribes. But this time bigger than rave and Mad-chester. It’s global. Because of the internet, influence just moves faster, and that’s a vital difference between now and the 80’s when my story began.\n\nSure there will always be interesting subcultural movements, but they are only globally smaller when reported on, because they are an alchemy of choice and influence. Ironically, if there was a distinctly new movement, it would go global very quickly now, but it would need to touch a global zeitgeist to appear predominant in most the average persons view. And global politics make more of a tone of grey over the more vibrant colours — which localised cultural recipes make, basically because of country zoned politics. What has in fact happened is: accessibility has dulled definition. Commercially informed Rock & Roll is dead, because the signals are many. The palette is muddied. Everyone has individuality rather than a tribe as expression and rebellion; which now (in historic retrospect and scale) will appear, domestically small.\n\nSo what’s wrong with this new individualised type of non-tribal expression? surely it’s democracy? Well yes, by some data driven academic definition, perhaps. But as far as rock & roll is concerned, it feels like the forefathers of broken ground have been compressed deep, into the foundations of what is now the tower of ‘babel-meh’.\n\nWhat’s changed\n\nThere’s a sexual energy behind most expression of the self, via fashion, music, and the arts. Except now we have the larger more societal issues surrounding biological identity at the forefront of cultural discourse, like something we have finally arrived at, which isn’t theatre.\n\nFor many hundreds of thousands of people, the lava of this pain has worked it’s way up through the solid strata of conservative prejudice and societal structure, until only recently, finally breaking the surface of the mainstream plaza. Identity still has the common thread, just much more serious than a jacket you can put away in the back of the wardrobe once the trend has passed. But still something that’s always been present in society. The 1920’s tried hard to give a stage to the normalising of gender fluidity, and challenging the accepted norms of gender stereotypes, especially in the more liberated European city’s like Berlin and Paris, but this was lost from the public eye, once the lens of the times pulled away from the clubs, and the explosion of post war celebration, and began focusing once again on industry and commerce.\n\nNow with just my finger barely in the air, I’d say this generation will be known for sexual revolution. By definition but only in the term alone, not too dissimilar to the 1960’s. Our now youth movements, obviously not informed by the previous generation at all, in fact more like the alternative revolts we’ve seen between decades before. Like a ticking clock, probably the largest expression of this generation, will be the gender conversation. The defining youth realisation and movement of the times we are living in. I suspect that sexual identity will undoubtedly define youth culture of this generation.\n\nWhen Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood opened their shop on the Kings road, it was 1974. A shy teenager would have had to pluck some courage up to go in there. The fashion of British Punk was deliberatly intimidating. Although interestingly, the legacy of a movement is actually cultivated in securing the young fan base early, which is more of a commercial and cynical reaction to true movements. And Malcolm McLaren was no stranger to having a commercial ulterior thought stream. But as far as the SEX shop was concerned, this place was the base of a revolution, also paying the rent. There’s a difference, and that difference does in fact define Rock & Roll in its purest form.\n\nSome of the committed serving staff in the shop had a strong androgynous feel to their appearance — part of the more photographed high end of the punk culture. Malcolm McLaren knew how to provoke the status quo, he was a master at it. However cynical the keen minded business observer would like to view his orchestration of a scene, which invariably always feathered his own nest; he still opened a huge resource in rock & roll iconography for hundreds of future artists to draw from. And besides, there will always be business behind trend.\n\nMusic, uniform, and drugs aside\n\nRock & Roll is also very associated with attitude, with ‘an attitude’. What if now, it’s exactly NOT these three things defining the modern version of Rock &Roll?\n\nMaybe in the modern sea of the high numbered equation, working it’s algorithm as hard as the end times illuminati demand of it — the individual with a genuinely unswayable fuck you, is the modern embodiment of Rock & Roll? — Just not necessarily having a social media presence, and listening to something so left of centre, they are always lapping the trend before it happens. And in trying to answer the question of this essay, we have observed, the overriding zeitgeist of the times is choice; the individual who consciously has less to choose from, will have a clearer and quickened view of their own wants and needs — surely they are the true spirit of opposition to the times we are living in. But here’s the thing, in order to rebel against the digital sea of grey and all your needless prayers being answered, under the pressure of your preciously manicured fingers, is a person who is no longer Rock & Roll by being tribal. They are simply fitting into the mixed media of a lesser tribal society. The guy who sits next to you on your morning commute, he’s wearing a suit, he’s got tidy hair, but he may be formulating very different perspectives on the world around him than you might imagine. After all, this isn’t the 1950’s anymore. One thing there’s little need to rebel against now is: a patriarchally operating society. Misogyny and a clear division between the sexes and roles is out. And we’ve moved on much further than the boomers realise. However, the last bastion of a traditionally operating society could well be ‘going to work’, and I bet that guy in the suit sat next to you on the train, his Rock & Roll might be: getting to a place where he can dial his hours in remotely, and do more of what he wants. And that might not be the new conventional version of Rock & Roll we later look back on, but the zeitgeist of attitude which rebelled against the assumption of the status quo — in turn, defining the new Rock & Roll. Or at least a large percentage of it.\n\nSo, if that’s the new Rock & Roll (thank you very much)\n\nLet’s take a sneak peak at the next generation’s version of Rock & Roll. Which, if my prediction is right, might well expose the current model as a trap. Especially if Jonathan Taplin’s train of thought in his novel ‘The End of Reality’ has anything to do with it; a world where Thiel, Musk, Zuckerberg and Andreessen, are pulling the majority of the ‘large global influence strings’ albeit Bond villain intention or not, it doesn’t matter, it’s commerce they’re involved in. And if commerce is going to kill your dreams, Rock & Roll has always been there to point that out. That is one defining element of Rock & Roll which has not yet changed and is here to stay.\n\nSo, turn the new definition of Rock & Roll on its head and will there be a world at some point in the future where, true rebellion lies in keeping a family together? Doing simple things, sitting down to eat as a family, bringing the elderly back to live with you…going off grid. A more simple life (and strangely) one with older family values, but through a completely re-polarised lens of realising we don’t want to be locked into a controlled world of the individual, the selfish new age. I believe the next phase of rebellion will look like regression to those who will agree to the implanted chip in their head. Some people may really have to hide in the woods in order to reclaim old values.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of this type of rebellion already. You only need a common or garden instagram account to see how sellable ‘living off grid’ already is; obviously those who have truly escaped, don’t post, you’re only looking at the product endorsed version. But those who are posting are perhaps unwittingly prophesizing something to those who, in the near future, will be forced to do, in order not to become marked by the beast. The ultimate Rock & Roll: ‘not to become a walking bank account’. A denial of financial systems, also a strong code in the DNA of Rock & Roll.\n\nPlenty to think about —\n\nand if like many others reading, your Rock & Roll is putting your favourite record on, and turning up the volume, then screaming “fuck you!!” until the neighbours call the police, that’s cool. Or maybe, like me, your Rock & Roll lies in the awakening of your mind; in which case, reach for your headphones and quietly consider your next move. But don’t tell everyone, the woods aren’t that big."
