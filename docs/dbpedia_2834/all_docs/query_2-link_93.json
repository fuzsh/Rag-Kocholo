        "text": "Status Quo is delighted to announce the release of the second volume of the new ‘Official Archive Series’ brought to you by earMUSIC. ‘Vol. 2 – Live In London’ will be released on December 1st, 2023, once again as strictly limited and numbered 2CD and 3LP vinyl editions, as well as digital download and streaming. As with each forthcoming release in this series, this official and fully endorsed recording features a carefully curated selection of iconic Status Quo performances, including classic hits spanning their extensive catalog, deep cuts, and fan favourites. ‘Vol. 2 – Live In London’ holds up the standards set with ‘Vol. 1 – Live In Amsterdam’, and is a definite gem in any record collection.\n\nThe ‘Official Archive Series’ offers exceptional sound quality and great packaging throughout, featuring photography by Christie Goodwin. The Series has been newly mixed and mastered by Eike Freese and Laurin Halberstadt at Chameleon Studios Hamburg.\n\n‘Vol. 2 – Live In London’ was a hometown show recorded on 19 December 2012 on the band’s ‘Quo Festive’ tour, getting people into the pre-Christmas mood. The setlist at the O2 Arena saw Francis Rossi, Rick Parfitt, Andrew Bown, John ‘Rhino’ Edwards and Matt Letley [in his last UK show as Quo drummer] deliver an avalanche of classics, and even features a Christmas Medley, including ‘Walking In A Winter Wonderland’, ‘Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree’ and Quo’s own ‘It’s Christmas Time’.\n\nFrom today, Status Quo is providing a first musical preview with the digital release of the powerful live performance of ‘Rockin’ All Over The World’.\n\n‘Vol. 2 – Live In London’ is a further release of the Status Quo ‘Official Archive Series’ presenting the raw energy and infectious enthusiasm of a Status Quo live performance; no matter where in the world. With their trademark sound, powerful guitar riffs, and irresistible hooks, the band delivers an unadulterated rock ’n’ roll experience, and this collectible series is a great way to celebrate one of the greatest live acts of all time.\n\nStatus Quo – Official Archive Series Vol. 2 – Live In London\n\nAlbum release: 1 December 2023\n\nFormats:\n\nLtd. 2CD Digipak\n\nLtd. 3LP (Black Vinyl/180g/Gatefold)\n\nDigital\n\nTrack listing:\n\nCD 1\n\n1.
