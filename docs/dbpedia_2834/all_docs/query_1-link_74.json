        "text": "I've posted two albums of BBC studio sessions by the British boogie rock band Status Quo. Most of that was before they went into full on boogie mode in the early 1970s. I'm not a big fan of their boogie rock stuff, as I think a lot of it is samey. However, they did perform some shows over the years that were broadcast by the BBC, and a commenter recently asked if I could post more.\n\nSo here's one, probably the last one I'll post by them. By 1988, the band had lots of hits, yet they still had most of their key long-time members. So it's a good time for a concert from them.\n\nIn 2010, the band released a box set called \"Live at the BBC.\" This comes from that. As a result, the sound quality is excellent. There's no talking between songs, but maybe they simply aren't talkative types. Some of the band's biggest hits are here, such as \"Whatever You Want\" or \"In the Army Now,\" but others are missing. They also did some album tracks, as well as covers by John Fogerty (\"Rockin' All Over the World,\" which was another big hit by them) and Chuck Berry \"Bye Bye Johnny.\"\n\nThis album is 54 minutes long.\n\n01 Whatever You Want (Status Quo)\n\n02 Little Lady (Status Quo)\n\n03 Roll Over Lay Down (Status Quo)\n\n04 Cream of the Crop (Status Quo)\n\n05 Who Gets the Love (Status Quo)\n\n06 Hold You Back (Status Quo)\n\n07 Don't Drive My Car (Status Quo)\n\n08 Dirty Water (Status Quo)\n\n09 In the Army Now (Status Quo)\n\n10 Rockin' All Over the World (Status Quo)\n\n11 Don't Waste My Time (Status Quo)\n\n12 Bye Bye Johnny (Status Quo)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/16700494/STATSQO1988_BBSessonsVol3InConcrtWemblyArna__7-7-1988_atse.zip.html"
