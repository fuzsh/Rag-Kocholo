        "text": "He can't see the band carrying on\n\nFollowing a fabled six-decade career, Francis Rossi says he believes Status Quo will call it a day once they play their final tour date of 2024.\n\nThe legendary rock band are currently playing festivals and headline shows across Europe, and their last show of the year takes place at Taunton Vivary Park on Friday 23rd August.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Mirror, Status Quo co-founder and solo constant member Francis Rossi said he can’t envision the band carrying on after the summer.\n\n“I don’t think we will go again,” the 75-year-old rock icon admitted. “And as far as the rest of the band are concerned it’s the last tour too. I just can’t see us doing it one more time.”\n\nRossi went on to explain that after Status Quo came back in 1985, a year after their final End of an Era Tour, he didn’t want to call the 2024 trek a farewell jaunt.\n\n“I didn’t want to put this current tour out, saying it’s the last one ever,” Rossi told The Mirror. “I did it once and was then coerced into coming back, but that’s another whole other f---ing story.\n\n“We did really split and then one of the managers came to me with a lie at the time that Rick (Parfitt) was in trouble with money again, which was often the case with Rick, so I said, ‘okay, we’ll do one more album - In the Army.\n\n“Who knows they might offer a huge amount of money to do the Quo again but I don’t think so. I am hesitant to call it the last ever but I just can’t see it continuing to be honest.”\n\nExplaining why Quo are calling it quits, Rossi said it’s too much of a strain on his body: “It’s f---ing hurting this time, physically.\n\n“We were at rehearsals before this tour and it occurred to me that we started 50 f---ing years ago. Thinking about it brought it home my age.\n\n“As much as you can say it’s just a number and you can’t really feel it, you definitely can and you are lying if you don’t. I’ve had prostate problems for a while, and macular degeneration...all old people things.”\n\nRossi went on: “Back in the day, I didn’t want to carry on with the band...even with Rick alive. I didn’t want to be there. And then when Rick died it got even worse. People were really offensive to Andrew and John because they wanted the original line-up.\n\n“I can’t give the old, hardcore fans what they want, which is the original line-up.”\n\nDespite Status Quo being over, Francis Rossi will embark on an extensive 34-date UK tour in 2025.\n\nThe solo trek will see him perform stripped back versions of Status Quo classics and shared stories from his distinguished career in music.\n\n38 iconic photos of Live Aid, including Status Quo:\n\nListen to Absolute Radio across the UK on your digital radio, the free Rayo app, by hitting that play button on the bottom of your screen or by asking your smart speaker to \"play Absolute Radio\"."
