        "text": "Drones are aircraft—which makes you a pilot. When you fly your drone, you’re sharing the skies with other drones and aircraft. Before you fly, understand the rules you must follow and review our safety tips.\n\nOn this page\n\nLegal requirements when flying drones\n\nFly your drone safely\n\nPenalties\n\nUseful terms to know\n\nLegal requirements when flying drones\n\nDrone pilots must follow the rules in the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs). Part IX – Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems contains most of the rules that apply to drones up to 25 kilograms. You should read these regulations in full before you fly your drone for the first time.\n\nDrone pilots must carry a valid drone pilot certificate and only fly drones that are marked and registered. If you are flying a drone that is less than 250 grams, you do not need to register the drone or get a drone pilot certificate.\n\nDrone pilots must always carry a valid drone pilot certificate while operating their drone. A valid drone pilot certificate is a printed or electronic document issued by Transport Canada. No other form of certification will be accepted.\n\nRespect all other laws\n\nYou must respect all other laws when flying your drone. We encourage you to read the following documents before you fly for the first time:\n\nRelevant sections of the Criminal Code, including Offences against Air or Maritime Safety, Breaking and Entering, and Mischief\n\nyour province’s trespass act\n\nlaws related to voyeurism and privacy\n\nYou must respect the privacy rights of others when you fly.\n\nWe investigate reports of unsafe flying.

Here are the rules you need to follow.\n\nWho can fly\n\nYou need a drone pilot licence to fly drones that weigh 250 grams (g) up to and including 25 kilograms (kg).\n\nYou need to be 14 years old to get a basic licence and 16 years old to get an advanced licence. Children younger than 14 must be supervised by someone with a licence. This includes clubs, camps and other youth groups.\n\nBefore you fly\n\nUnderstand your legal requirements when flying drones\n\nUnderstand the difference between basic and advanced operations (find your category of drone operation)\n\nGet the necessary knowledge requirements\n\nGet a drone pilot certificate\n\nChoose the right drone if you want to perform advanced operations\n\nRegister your drone\n\nFollow your drone manufacturer’s instructions\n\nSurvey the area where you will fly\n\nTake note of any obstacles, such as buildings and power lines\n\nAdvanced operations only - to operate in controlled airspace (Classes C, D or E) you need to ask NAV CANADA for an RPAS Flight Authorization\n\nWhile flying\n\nTo keep yourself and others safe, fly your drone:\n\nwhere you can always see it\n\nYou can fly at night if you have lights on your drone\n\nbelow 122 metres (400 feet) in the air\n\naway from bystanders, at a minimum horizontal distance of 30 metres for basic operations\n\naway from emergency operations and advertised events\n\nAvoid forest fires, outdoor concerts and parades\n\naway from airports and heliports\n\n5.6 kilometres (3 nautical miles) from airports\n\n1.9 kilometres (1 nautical mile) from heliports\n\noutside controlled airspace (for basic operations only)\n\nfar away from other aircraft\n\nDon’t fly anywhere near airplanes, helicopters and other drones\n\nPenalties\n\nYou could face serious penalties, including fines and/or jail time, if you break the rules.\n\nFines for individuals\n\nup to $1,000 for flying without a drone pilot certificate\n\nup to $1,000 for flying unregistered or unmarked drones\n\nup to $1,000 for flying where you are not allowed\n\nup to $3,000 for putting aircraft and people at risk\n\nFines for corporations\n\nup to $5,000 for flying without a drone pilot certificate\n\nup to $5,000 for flying unregistered or unmarked drones\n\nup to $5,000 for flying where you are not allowed\n\nup to $15,000 for putting aircraft and people at risk\n\nIf you break more than one rule, you could receive multiple penalties.\n\nUseful terms to know\n\nDrone and Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS)\n\nWe use the term “drone” on these pages to refer to any type of Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS). There are several different terms for this technology. In Part IX of the Canadian Aviation Regulations, we use the term Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems to align with our international partners.\n\nVisual-line-of-sight (VLOS)\n\nVisual-line-of-sight means always keeping your device in sight without visual aid (for example, binoculars or video feed). This means not flying into clouds or fog, or behind trees, buildings or other (even partial) obstructions.\n\nBystander\n\nBystander refers to anyone that is not directly associated with the operation. Among others, this excludes the pilot and crew.\n\nRelated links"
