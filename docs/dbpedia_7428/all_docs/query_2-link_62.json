        "text": "If you’ve been around since at least 2017, chances are you’ve heard “Despacito,” the smash bilingual single with Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee that topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 16 straight weeks, and whose sexy music video remains the most watched ever by a musical artist on YouTube. (The hit also later spawned a remix with Justin Bieber.)\n\nWhile it feels like yesterday, it’s been five years — five! — since “Despacito” first topped the Hot 100 on May 27, 2017, and then remained there to tie Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men’s 16-week record at No. 1. Since then, you’ve no doubt sung along to “Despacito,” whether at a club, during a workout, or just whenever the catchy song pops up.\n\nWhatever the reason behind your singing along to the hit, you should probably know that, although irresistible, the words to Fonsi’s popular tune aren’t that innocent. Billboard has translated the lyrics to English, and here’s what they really mean.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\n“Despacito” feat. Daddy Yankee\n\nYes, you know that I’ve been looking at you for a long time\n\nI must dance with you today (DY)\n\n[Daddy Yankee]\n\nI saw that the look in your eyes was calling me\n\nShow me the path that I will take (Oh)\n\n[Luis Fonsi]\n\nYou, you’re the magnet and I’m the metal\n\nI am getting closer and making a plan\n\nSimply thinking about it makes my heart race (Oh yeah)\n\n[Daddy Yankee]\n\nNow, I’m already liking it more than usual\n\nAll of my senses are asking for more\n\nWe cannot do this in a rush\n\n[Luis Fonsi]\n\nSlowly\n\nI want to breathe in your neck slowly\n\nLet me murmur things in your ear\n\nSo that you remember if you’re not with me\n\nSlowly\n\nI want to undress you in kisses slowly\n\nFirmly in the walls of your labyrinth\n\nAnd of your body, I want to create a manuscript\n\nUp, up\n\nUp, up, up\n\nI want to see your hair dance\n\nI want to be your rhythm\n\nWant you to show my mouth\n\nYour favorite places (Favorite, favorite baby)\n\nLet me trespass your danger zones\n\nUntil I make you scream\n\nAnd you forget your last name\n\n[Daddy Yankee]\n\nIf I ask for a kiss come give it to me\n\nI know that you’re thinking about it\n\nI’ve been trying to do it for awhile\n\nMami, this is giving and giving it to you\n\nYou know that with me your heart goes bom bom\n\nYou know that from me that babe is looking for a bom bom\n\nCome try my mouth and see if you like its taste\n\nI want to see how much love fits in you\n\nI’m not in a rush I want to experience this trip\n\nLet’s start slowly, then savagely\n\nStep by step, soft then softly\n\nWe come up against each other, little by little\n\nWhen you kiss me in that state of distress\n\nI see that you are malice and delicacy\n\nStep by step, soft then softly\n\nWe come up against each other, little by little\n\nAnd it’s just that your beauty is a puzzle\n\nBut to finish it here I have the missing piece\n\n[Luis Fonsi]\n\nSlowly\n\nI want to breathe in your neck slowly\n\nLet me murmur things in your ear\n\nSo that you remember if you’re not with me\n\nSlowly\n\nI want to undress you in kisses slowly\n\nFirmly in the walls of your labyrinth\n\nAnd of your body, I want to create a manuscript\n\nUp, up, up, up\n\nI want to see your hair dance\n\nI want to be your rhythm\n\nWant you to show my mouth\n\nYour favorite places (Favorite, favorite baby)\n\nLet me trespass your danger zones\n\nUntil I make you scream\n\nAnd you forget your last name\n\nSlowly\n\nWe’re gonna do it on a beach in Puerto Rico\n\nUntil the waves scream Oh Lord\n\nSo that my seal stays with you\n\n[Daddy Yankee]\n\nStep by step, soft then softly\n\nWe come up against each other, little by little\n\n[Luis Fonsi]\n\nI want you to show my mouth\n\nYour favorite places (Favorite, favorite baby)\n\n[Daddy Yankee]\n\nStep by step, soft then softly\n\nWe come up against each other, little by little"
