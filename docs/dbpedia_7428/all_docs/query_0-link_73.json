        "text": "West of Rome Public Art\n\nwww.trespassparade.org\n\nOn Sunday, October 2, 2011 the streets of downtown Los Angeles will erupt in a parade of local artists and residents, complete with music, dancing and performance. The parade is the culmination of Trespass, a collaborative project between Arto Lindsay, Rirkrit Tiravanija, and West of Rome Public Art (WoR). They have commissioned 40 Los Angeles based artists, including John Baldessari, Barbara Kruger, Nancy Rubins and Sterling Ruby, to produce a statement—their call to action, pleasure and reciprocity. The statements have been printed on T-shirts in English and in Spanish, and will be worn as part of the parade and sold via the West of Rome website. The parade will take place at 11:00 am and will convene at 1933 South Broadway, Los Angeles, CA 90007. This project has been created to coincide with Pacific Standard Time, a collaboration of more than 60 cultural institutions across Southern California coming together for the first time to celebrate the birth of the L.A. art scene, which begins October 2011.\n\nOn Monday, October 3, 2011 Trespass will reach its climax with a blow out benefit party for WoR at Union Station in downtown Los Angeles. Fantastic and transgressive Los Angeles iconic underground figure, Miss Vaginal Davis will shape our journey into the night. The rhythms of Trespass will permeate into the evening as musician Arto Lindsay will perform a unique piece composed for the occasion. Artist Rirkrit Tiravanija will engage the audience in a continuation of the collective experience of social awareness stemming from the parade.\n\nWoR will integrate underground and cutting edge moments of street life and cultural history in Los Angeles into the party, and deliver it to a sophisticated international art audience. For a unique experience in the City of Angels, please visit our website: www.trespassparade.org.\n\nArto Lindsay’s musical career has often involved collaboration with artists. These have ranged from working with Jean Michel Basquiat on his artist break for MTV to a performance at The Kitchen with Vito Acconci called “Women’s Business” to a parade during Carnaval in El Salvador with Matthew Barney entitled “de lama lāmina.” Recent projects include collaborations with Dominique Gonzalez Foerster and Philippe Parreno. In April 2008 Lindsay presented “I Am a Man”, a parade in Frankfurt featuring dancer Richard Siegal, artist /musician Nico Vascellari, percussionist Marivaldo Paim, and students of the Staedelschule. In 2009 Lindsay presented Multinatural (Blackout) a parade at the Venice Biennale. He also presented parades in New York and Berlin. In 2010 he collaborated on a parade in Paris for Nuitblanche with Rirkrit Tiravanija.\n\nThai artist Rirkrit Tiravanija is widely recognized as one of the most influential artists of his generation. His work defies media-based description, as his practice combines traditional object making, public and private performances, teaching, and other forms of public service and social action. Winner of the 2010 Absolut Art Award and the 2005 Hugo Boss Prize awarded by the Guggenheim Museum. Tiravanija was also awarded the Benesse by the Naoshima Contemporary Art Museum in Japan and the Smithsonian American Art Museum’s Lucelia Artist Award.\n\nWoR is the leading organization in Los Angeles dedicated to the realization of artists’ projects, exhibitions, and public interventions outside of the frame of galleries and museums. Founded in 2005, WoR has produced many notable exhibitions including Women in The City featuring Barbara Kruger, Louise Lawler, Cindy Sherman and Jenny Holzer, Mike Kelley and Michael Smith’s A Voyage of Growth and Discovery, and Marnie Weber’s Eternity Forever."
