        "text": "TRESPASSES, by Louise Kennedy\n\nRecently, The New York Times published a photograph of children in Ukraine playing on a playground, surrounded by bombed-out buildings. I happened to see it the same week I was reading “Trespasses,” the brilliant, beautiful, heartbreaking debut novel by Louise Kennedy. I think the two will be forever linked in my mind.\n\n“Trespasses” revolves around 24-year-old Cushla Lavery, a Catholic schoolteacher living just outside Belfast in the early years of the Troubles, in a small town that is heavily occupied by British soldiers. It is 1975. Two and a half years after her father’s death, Cushla’s family is still grieving as they find their new shape. Her brother has taken over the family bar, where he tries to maintain the peace (and stay in business) by keeping out of politics. Her mother has slipped into alcoholism and bouts of despair. Cushla still lives with her, and tries to manage the situation as best she can. She herself is lonely, isolated, “in a sort of heartsick stasis.”\n\nStories set in such times and places are often described as playing out against a backdrop of violence. But Kennedy deftly reveals how violence in a conflict zone can more accurately be described as intertwined with and inseparable from daily life. Cushla looks out the window first thing in the morning and sees her neighbor, a prison officer, checking under his car for explosives: “His wife was watching from the doorstep in a turquoise nightgown, holding their dog.” A wedding reception has to be relocated at the last minute when the hotel where it was meant to take place gets firebombed. Cushla goes to a party with a kind, gentle co-worker; on the way there, a group of British soldiers humiliates him and drags him from the car.\n\nEarly on in the book, Cushla meets an older, married Protestant barrister named Michael Agnew. There is instant chemistry between them. Their ensuing connection injects Cushla’s life with verve and excitement, with that all-consuming fizz of a new love affair. It takes her away from her worries for a time, and brings about a less dire set of concerns, such as what to wear should they run into each other and when he will next contact her. The details of their relationship are perfectly rendered: The longing Cushla feels for Michael, the way she exists at his beck and call. How she hates this part of herself but can’t resist. Cushla’s self-awareness makes her wonderful company. When she passes a billboard full of warnings separated by ellipses (“ IF YOU’RE SUSPICIOUS DIAL 999 … DON’T LET CHILDREN PLAY WITH TOY GUNS”) Cushla thinks, “the final ellipsis leaving endless possibilities.” She imagines what these might be if directed specifically at her: “DON’T FALL FOR A MARRIED PROD TWICE YOUR AGE … DON’T AGREE TO SEE HIM EVERY SINGLE TIME IT SUITS HIM …”"
