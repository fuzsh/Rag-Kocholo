        "text": "1st August 2022\n\nWriting about the Wagatha Christie case reminded me of this thought I once had.\n\nDefamation is an odd tort, and to my mind it is a lot like trespass to land, which is another odd tort.\n\nOdd, as in distinctive.\n\nWhen a person goes on the land of another, and the land owner wants to sue, the land owner has to prove they own the land and that there is/was an intrusion.\n\nIt is then for the defendant to prove that they had a right to enter the land, such as a licence.\n\nSimilarly when a person defames the reputation of another, and the defamed person wants to sue, the defamed person has to prove that they have a reputation in the jurisdiction and that the defaming statement related to them.\n\nIt is then for the defendant to prove that what they say is true or a fair opinion or some other defence.\n\nTrespasser/defamer; land/reputation; and the onus being on the defendant to justify the intrusion/statement.\n\nIt is almost as if the law conceives of a reputation almost as a property right, and the presumption is against any rightful intrusion/defamation.\n\nThe cry of “get orf my land” transforms into “get orf my reputation”.\n\n*\n\nOne criticism often made of libel law is that it is on the defendant to prove a defence.\n\nThe claimant does have to prove certain things: that they have a reputation in the jurisdiction; that there was defamatory statement published to the third party; and that the defamatory statement caused (or is likely to cause) serious harm.\n\nSo it is not true that a libel claimant does not have to prove anything.\n\nBut once these things are shown, it swings to the defendant to prove their defence, and not for the claimant to disprove it.\n\nThat this is a practical problem for defendants is obvious.\n\nBut the question is whether it could be done any other way?\n\nJust as it would not be for the landowner to prove an intruder has not got a licence, should it be for the defamed person to disprove a defamatory statement of fact?\n\nSurely the person defaming another should have their factual basis in place before defaming another?\n\nUntil and unless this problem of the reverse burden of proof is addressed, then many attempts at libel reform will not succeed\n\nThis is because many of the problems of libel in practice flow from this key shift in who has to prove what.\n\nComments Policy\n\nThis blog enjoys a high standard of comments, many of which are better and more interesting than the posts.\n\nComments are welcome, but they are pre-moderated and comments will not be published if irksome."
