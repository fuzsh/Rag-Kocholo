It takes that emotional connection to the fantasy world and brings it into a physical space, which is why no one should pass up the opportunity to visit their favorite movie or TV destination if they can. From spending a night in Ralphie's room from A Christmas Story to visiting the museum that is Bruce Wayne's mansion from The Dark Knight Rises, you'll want to visit more than one of these iconic buildings from movies and TV shows."
