        "text": "Like their filthy-rich characters in the chock-full-of-cheese thriller, “Trespass,” Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman appear ominously comfortable and complacent, completely unaware of the 800-pound cliche that is Karl Gajdusek’s script.\n\nThen, wham! They’re swarmed by four journeymen actors attired in ski masks and sheriff’s uniforms. The two Nics rush to push the panic button, but no help arrives. Not even director Joel Schumacher, who, true to his track record, hasn’t a clue about orchestrating the most inept home invasion since last month’s “Straw Dogs.” And once Nic and Nic realize they’ve been hung out to dry, they evolve into Hollywood’s version of the 2011 Boston Red Sox. They quit. And as the strikeouts and errors mount, your anger grows faster than Josh Beckett’s waistline after a clubhouse feast of greasy chicken and cut-rate beer.\n\nThrow the bums out, you say. And you’re not talking about the home invaders. Them you root for, as you secretly hope they follow through with their threats to excise one of Cage’s kidneys, sans anesthesia. No such luck. Turns out that the criminals are bigger imbeciles than the filmmakers - and that’s saying something. All they need do is smoke the two Nics and their spoiled, self-centered teenaged daughter (Liana Liberato), grab the loot and be done with it. But then there would be nothing for these nincompoops to do for the remaining 60 minutes except nonsensically turn on each other, which is exactly what they do.\n\nIt’s brutal, too. Not the ensuing celebration of gratuitous violence that includes smashed hands, lethal injections and hot babes having their empty heads smashed up against a blood-splattered windshield. No, I’m talking about the acting. It’s so painful to watch that you’d rather trade places with one of the bad guys and be nail-gunned to the floor of a burning building than endure another idiotic minute.\n\nAh, the nail gun! Always good for a laugh in thrillers of this dubious ilk that mistake gore for fun. Not that you don’t laugh. In fact, I snickered until I cried. Unfortunately, it was unintentional. Yes, the more sincere – and intense – Nic and Nic become, the bigger the guffaws. They’re supposed to be on each other’s side, I think, but the unabashed way they attempt to out-shout one another, I had to wonder. Just like I wondered how two Oscar winners could possibly have thought that appearing in “Trespass” would be a good for their fleeting careers.\n\nPerhaps they needed the money; just like Cage’s Kyle Miller. He’s a diamond dealer in the rough, cashed out and trying to sell his wife and kid on the idea that they’re still rolling in dough. Wow! That sure makes me feel better knowing that the top 1 percent can fall as fast as the lower 99 percent, only we don’t have $150,000 Porsches and lakeside mansions to fall back on. Or 24-hour security protection to make sure burglars and home invaders don’t get inside our walled-off estate. Oops! Let’s just say rent-a-cops emerge looking as hapless as the movie, especially when we learn one of them is in on the job.\n\nThat would be Jonah (former “O.C.” bad boy Cam Gigandet), who looks fabulous in a scruffy beard, but bad pining like a lost puppy for Kidman’s sexually frustrated Sarah. He’s joined in the bloody-bad fun by his hunky older brother (Ben Mendelsohn) and their two brain-addled accomplices (Dash Mihok and “My Boys” alum, Jordana Spiro). It turns out that they need $180,000 just as bad as Kyle. What irony! Yet everyone comes up empty handed, including us, as the loot, the house and many a career goes up in an acrid plume of smoke."
