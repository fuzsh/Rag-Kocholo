        "text": "Blu-ray Sales: The Checkered Flag goes to Cars Too\n\nNovember 16th, 2011\n\nNot only did Cars 2 lead the way on the DVD sales chart, it led the way on the Blu-ray sales chart as well. It dominated new releases and holdovers alike, selling 1.76 million units and generating $44.57 million in opening week sales. Its opening Blu-ray ratio was 47%, which is very good for a kids movie and an unexpected boon for the format. More...\n\nDVD Sales: Victory Lap for Cars 2\n\nNovember 16th, 2011\n\nWhile there were only four new releases to reach the top 30 on this week's DVD Sales Chart, three of them took the top three spots. Cars 2 earned first place with ease, selling 1.98 million units and generating $31.24 million in opening week sales. More...\n\nDVD and Blu-ray Releases for November 1st, 2011\n\nNovember 1st, 2011\n\nThe selection of home market releases is rather soft this week. Sure, Cars 2 was a major hit at the box office, but it is the only major hit on this week's list. The best selling TV on DVD release is Californication, which is a cable show, while the top ten selling titles according to Amazon.com include limited releases, catalogue titles and direct-to-DVD releases. There are more second-tier Christmas releases than any other type of release. There are far fewer titles that are worth picking up than last week, and the the Pick of the Week contenders are even more limited. Transformers: Beast Wars comes out on a Complete Series Collection and that could be Pick of the Week material, but I'm still waiting for the screener. More...\n\nPer Theater Chart Shows Some Skin\n\nOctober 18th, 2011\n\nThere was only one film to top $10,000 on the per theater chart this weekend. The Skin I Live In had a big name director, big name star, excellent reviews, and a lot of buzz thanks to a controversial plot. This added up to an opening of $233,000 in six theaters for an average of $37,187. This suggests it will perform very well on the art house circuit, but this is a film that will never play to wide audiences.
