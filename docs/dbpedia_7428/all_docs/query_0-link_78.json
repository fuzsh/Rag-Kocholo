        "text": "Ours is a wild and a beautiful island. But the vast majority of it is unknown to us because we are banned from setting foot on it. We are excluded from hundreds of thousands of acres of open space simply because exclusionary laws fail to recognise the importance of nature to the public.\n\nBut the law of England should not be excluding us from nature. It should be encouraging us towards it. Lockdown demonstrated the vital importance of such access for everyone’s physical and mental health. With depression, anxiety, and obesity all on the rise, science is telling us that we need a deeper connection to nature. Meanwhile, nature is telling us it needs us too. With our ecosystems at crisis point, we need everyone to become nature's advocate. But without that fundamental connection to our environment, we cannot know what we're losing, nor what's at risk. Without us, nature has no voice.\n\n​\n\nYet in England we only have a right of access to 8% of the land, and uncontested rights to 3% of our rivers. These rights have only been extended to walkers and climbers. And they only apply to landscapes which are often remote (applying only to \"mountain, moor, heath and down\") and inaccessible to those who cannot afford a car,, rather than helping connect most people to where they actually live – and are best placed to help protect. Over 150 constituencies in England have no real right to roam at all. Most others have only tiny percentages.\n\nEverywhere else the public are made to feel unwelcome in their own landscape, running gauntlets of barbed wire and angry signs, portrayed for centuries as a threat to the countryside, rather than a part of it.\n\nBut our desire to access nature should not be subject to such arbitrary whims and unjustified aggression. In recent years, science has built an irrefutable bank of evidence proving what our hearts have always known: we urgently need access to nature, its beauty, its space, its flora and its fauna, for our health, our creativity and our peace of mind. In a world of steel, glass and concrete, of stress, ecological detachment and screen-based lifestyles, the countryside is a natural health service that can heal us.\n\nNature should be accessible for all. Following the successful models demonstrated in Scotland, Scandinavia and other parts of Europe, our right to access nature responsibly should be the assumption not the exception. ‘Access’ should also extend beyond simply a right to walk in some places. Provided we treat the land with respect, why shouldn’t we also be allowed to camp, cycle, kayak, swim and climb amid the beauty of the natural world?\n\n​\n\nWhat is the Right to Roam?\n\nThe \"Right to Roam\" is a colloquial way of describing an ancient custom that gives anyone the freedom to wander in open countryside, whether the land is privately or publicly owned. In countries such as Norway, Sweden, Estonia and Scotland it has long existed as a common right, a defining concept of nationhood, and has only recently been codified into law. Central to all versions of it across Europe is that: 1) there are sensible, listed exceptions and modifications to this right; and 2) this right only comes with responsibilities to both the ecology and community of an area.\n\nThe Right to Roam is really just a definition of private property that is different to England. There are still major landowners in Norway, Counts in Sweden, Lords in Scotland who own many hundreds of thousands of acres. Their ownership of the land, however - while it might allow them to take rent, mine and make money from the land - does not include the right to exclude every other member of the public. In these countries, the Right to Roam is considered so important to the health and mental well-being of a nation, that it supercedes the right to exclude. Instead, every person has a right to explore these vast open spaces. They too are given the right to belong.\n\nThis right, however, is contingent on adhering to a strict set of responsibilities. These are simple, basic codes of how to behave in the countryside in such a way that you neither interrupt the function of a working, agricultural landscape, or damage the ecology of where you roam. None of these codes differ in logic from the Countryside Code of England, but they cover a larger scope, because they encompass more activities, and larger areas of land. When children grow up in these countries, experiencing nature and learning the code in practical terms, these codes become second nature, part of a wider understanding of how humans should interact with the natural world.\n\nThe combination of rights and responsibilities creates a relationship with the natural world that is entirely different from that of England. Nature is no longer presented like a museum piece, to be observed from afar behind a line of barbed wire. Instead it becomes something to be immersed in, a multi-sensory tangible experience whose smells, sounds, sightings can have profound effects upon the minds of their beholders. There is a long term effect too. Nature is no longer relegated to occasional visits, but instead becomes part of people’s daily routine, woven into our lives. The Right to Roam ensures that the government actively encourages people to go outside and supports ways for everyone to facilitate it. The Right to Roam curates a common, national consensus of an inherent connection with nature.\n\nThe majority of the English countryside is out of bounds for most of its population. 92% of the countryside has no right to roam and 97% of rivers have no uncontested rights of navigation: meaning some bankside owners feel entitled to shout at people just for going for a paddle, or a swim.\n\nIn all but one tenth of the English landscape, to wander off the footpath, to swim in a river, to explore and educate ourselves about our countryside, can leave us branded a trespasser and expelled from the land. This is neither fair nor reasonable, and in a time where the need to reconnect with nature is more urgent than ever, it is not sustainable. The law must be changed.\n\nOur Environment\n\n​\n\nNature is in crisis. Our wildlife has being decimated, the countryside has been emptied of the birds and bees and wildflowers that it once brimmed with. Our rivers are being clogged with plastic and poisoned with pesticide and sewage. Since the seventies, the linnet population has declined by 53%, but how many people even know what a linnet is, or could recognise one in the trees?\n\nWe have forgotten what we have lost: how can we be expected to care about the environment when for so long we have been disconnected from it? As scientist Robert Michael Pyle wrote: “People who care conserve; people who don’t know don’t care. What is the extinction of the condor to a child who has never known the wren?” We need a personal connection with nature, forged from early years and maintained as part of our daily lives, in order to care; we need to reconnect with our land.\n\nAnd where we do have access, we also see care: powerful campaigning from groups such as Friends of Wye (one of the 3% of rivers with statutory rights of navigation and widespread bankside access) powerfully demonstrate how long-standing rights of access can be converted into deeper cultures of connection and care.\n\nOn a wider scale, our climate is in crisis. We need to radically cut our carbon emissions; we need to stop flying so much. But with 92% of our landscape off limits, campsites are full in the holidays and the honeypot sites of National Parks and nature reserves are teeming with people at the weekends. Yet there is so much more space in England, hidden behind the stone walls of near-empty manorial estates, or the barbed wire fences of private woodlands. We need the silence, solitude and open space of the landscape as much as we need its fresh air. We need to reconnect with our land.\n\nOur Health\n\nOur need to experience nature is not just about recreation: more than ever it is essential to our psychological wellbeing. With our sedentary and largely urbanised lifestyles, obesity and respiratory disorders are on the rise, and heart disease and back problems plague many. We have an urgent need for exercise and for the space to do it in.\n\nOn top of this, our mental health is in crisis - as a nation we are getting steadily more depressed, and ‘nature deficit disorder’ has been cited as the cause for many developmental issues in children, such as ADHD and eating disorders. From the phytonicides released by trees in a forest, which can boost our immune systems and decrease the symptoms of stress, to the recent studies showing the correlation between kindness and sensations of the sublime, science is finally beginning to prove what we have known all along: in mind, body and soul, nature can heal us.\n\n​\n\nOur Society\n\nThe recent coronavirus lockdown has brought the issue of access to open space to the foreground of public consciousness. Those with gardens were privileged over those without, those with access to green space (whether living in the country, or near a public park in the city) were able to access nature and open air, whilst those without were literally confined within the walls of their homes. During lockdown, crowded parks and honeypot sites received a lot of attention. Yet they also demonstrated the obvious: we are being crammed into a tiny percentage of available green space; which we experience as visitors rather than protectors, with no deeper culture to defend against disregard.\n\nJust as coronavirus split England along the same old fault-lines of class and race, so access to land is deeply biased against large sections of our society. Two hundred years ago, the working class were still intrinsically connected to the countryside. Even as late as the 1930s, rambling and cycling were seen primarily as working class hobbies, accompanied by a strong understanding that nature was needed as a salve to counteract the hard, cramped lifestyles of urban dwelling. Only very recently has the countryside become the preserve of mostly privileged classes. From National Trust memberships, to outdoor recreation shops, the leisure industry dominates our access to the countryside. Now even the experience of nature has become something you can purchase, a commodity for those that can afford it.\n\nSimilarly, for Black and People of Colour (BPOC) communities, who are disproportionately affected by lack of access to nature, there are many more barriers to nature than simply the walls of private estates. The English landscape is filled with manorial estates built from the profits of enslaving and trading African people, of West Indian Sugar plantations and East Indian colonialism. The legacy of these brutal systems survives in the landscape, as strong as it is unacknowledged, contributing to a deep sense that many BPOC people feel that they remain unwelcome in the countryside.\n\n​\n\nOur Land\n\n​\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, the Attlee government looked into granting a full Right to Roam in England, similar to that of Scotland today. Alongside the welfare state, state pensions and the National Health Service, full access to the countryside was proposed as a corollary to the NHS, to offer the English a way to prevent illness before the need for the cure. Of all the proposals for this post-war new order, the Right to Roam was deemed a step too far by the landowners in the House of Lords, and rejected in favour of the National Parks plan.\n\nIn today’s post-lockdown society, now, more than ever, the time is right to renew that initial vision and open up more of the English countryside to the public. We need to alleviate the pressure on the National Health Service by opening up the Natural Health Service, by giving people access to the natural healing properties of the countryside, the health benefits that come with the visceral experience of nature, with access to open space."
