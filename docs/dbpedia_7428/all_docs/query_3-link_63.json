        "text": "In “Son of Friedman,” your story in this week’s issue, George Friedman, a fading movie producer, has dinner with a friend, William Delaney, a still thriving actor. Then they head off to a screening of a film made by Friedman’s son, who’s the actor’s godson. George and William used to be equals—now George is a supplicant. What made this scenario fictionally appealing?\n\nThere’s that great Renata Adler line about how, since taking a job in New York, she’s gone out with “four sons of famous fathers, two businessmen with unfinished novels,” etc. The offspring of famous people are a New York staple. For many obvious and topical reasons, it’s not fashionable or logical to pity them. Still, I’ve often found their plight poignant. Suffering isn’t relative—people can only experience their own lives, their own suffering, no matter how frivolous it is in comparison. I think most children grow up and, by necessity, dismantle the myths of their parents. For children of famous parents, maybe that’s harder to do, since the myth is operating on a much larger scale, a myth kept alive by thousands of people and entire media machines. In a way, fame, or a certain kind of success, literalizes the child’s experience of a parent as this unknowable but powerful entity, larger than life. It seems to cripple the children, upsets the natural order of separating from them and making their own way, especially when they choose to pursue similar careers. Though maybe it makes sense why their parent’s career path would seem like the only one available, if your whole childhood was constructed around the requirements and logistics of this all-consuming world.\n\nThere’s some element that feels like a self-destructive compulsion, like the offspring of John Lennon and Bob Dylan choosing to be musicians. No matter how good or talented you are, it’s setting yourself up for a particular kind of suffering, forcing this Oedipal narrative to play out. Maybe this conflict is specific to the creative field, where, unlike other careers that get passed down, like finance or business, success is so tied to an individual’s subjectivity, a subjectivity that gets almost deified. Creativity isn’t dependent on a knowledge base. It’s more closely linked to personhood and an interior world, mysteries that can’t really be taught or inherited. I think, for George, Benji deciding to enter his realm feels like a trespass for that reason.\n\nI like the power imbalances in this story, characters who are at different points along the spectrum of conventional success. It was important to me that George need something from William: need exposes the truth of a relationship, cuts through the niceties. I like, too, the idea that, by dint of his need and diminished status, George might be pitiable to William, in the way Benji is pitiable to George. Being in Benji’s presence, sitting through Benji’s awful film, provides this echo chamber for George’s shame—George has to feel both his anxiety and awareness of his own supplication, as well as this secondhand anxiety and shame tied to his offspring, a suffocating awareness of how people like William might be experiencing the night. It’s fun to try to track those layers in fiction.\n\nThe film is very bad, and George is essentially embarrassed by his son, Benji. Besides the quality of the film, what makes Benji so embarrassing?\n\nI thought a little bit about “large adult sons” as I was writing this—the psychotic confidence it takes for someone like Benji to corral together enough money to make this vanity project, to ask people to spend time being interviewed, to rent out a theatre to show off this hybrid documentary/music video. It’s confidence that makes no sense, confidence summoned out of thin air. I think, for someone like George, who feels he built up his career because he worked hard, cultivated these relationships, had this “magic brain,” Benji’s brand of confidence, existing wholly apart from reality, is an affront.\n\nFor a certain type of person, success only looks one way. George, who’s spent his life in pursuit of a particular type of reward, can only see the world through that lens: everyone either winners or losers. His son, who has no real direction, who has made this silly, pointless movie, can’t register as anything but embarrassing. Benji won’t ever warrant any external rewards, will never succeed according to George’s scale. Though, in many ways, Benji could be seen as a “success”; he’s happy, sociable, confident, has a devoted girlfriend. These are things George does not have, maybe never really had—there’s the sense that he sort of bowed out of being a father and a husband in favor of his career.\n\nGeorge’s shame, too, is made larger by the fact that he knows it’s not “right” to feel embarrassed by your own children. But obviously people’s identity and self-worth get tied up in all kinds of external things, especially in a society structured like ours, a society attached to image instead of substance. I think of the parents in the college-bribery case, who would rather commit crimes than allow their children to be mediocre. There must be weird deep currents of shame that would lead you to that point, a conflation of the child’s success with your own.\n\nThe story is filled with grimly hilarious details of the underside of the movie business—William Delaney’s method of discouraging photographs, the slightly sad theatre that rents out screens to one-off films. Can you describe your interactions with the movie industry?\n\nAs a temporary resident of Los Angeles, the movie industry is something I think about more often than I used to, partly because that’s one reason why I’m here, and partly because of the insane number of movie and TV billboards that hover over everything, reminding you that this is essentially a company town.\n\nWriting fiction, you work in solitude, a solitude that allows for absolute control, only requiring other people when a project is mostly finished. There’s less difficulty in making sure the tone is consistent—after all, everything is flowing from one consciousness. With movies, you’re trying to corral this insane number of elements in order to create a cohesive tone and atmosphere—but it’s also much more collaborative and less lonely than writing fiction. I like it for that reason, and just for the pure strange fun of it.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite literary depictions of the movie industry? How about nonfiction?\n\nI’ve always loved the artifice involved with making movies, especially the line at which the set ends and the real world takes over. Larry Sultan’s photos of porn sets in the Valley—and even his photos of suburban neighborhoods ending in abrupt wilderness—are most evocative to me of that movie atmosphere, toggling back and forth between the false and the real. There’s something so compelling about holding both things in your mind, how the dichotomy amplifies the fakeness of “real” life and the reality of this “fake” world."
