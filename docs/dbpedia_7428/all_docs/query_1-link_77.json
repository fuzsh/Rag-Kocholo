        "text": "Adam Smith’s directorial debut Trespass Against Us is picking up steam ahead of a scheduled summer production start, with Lionsgate picking up UK rights. Michael Fassbender, Brendan Gleeson, Lyndsey Marshal and Rory Kinnear star in the pic scripted by Alistair Siddons. It is set across three generations of the rowdy Cutler family, who live as outlaws in the English countryside — hunting hares, ram-raiding stately homes and taunting the police. As the letter of the law finally catches up with Chad (Fassbender), he is torn between the archaic principles of his father (Gleeson) and what he believes is best for his children. Smith was tapped for the gig in November ahead of AFM . His credits include episodes of Doctor Who, Little Dorrit and Skins in the UK and the feature documentary The Chemical Brothers: Don’t Think — that duo will write and perform the original score for the movie, for which Protagonist Pictures is handling global presales at Cannes.\n\nSiddons also produces with Gail Egan and Andrea Calderwood of Potboiler Productions (A Most Wanted Man, Half Of A Yellow Sun). The film will be executive produced by Film4’s Tessa Ross, always a good spotter of new talent, who recently announced she was exiting the film division of the UK broadcaster to head up the National Theatre (she is staying at Film4 until September). Lionsgate‘s Zygi Kamasa, Frederick W. Green and Joshua Astrachan of Animal Kingdom and Nigel Williams also are exec producing. It was developed and is being co-financed by Film4 with backing from the BFI and Lipsync."
