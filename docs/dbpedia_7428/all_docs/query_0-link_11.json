        "text": "Rocco Anelli (Film 2019) on his time at AUR.\n\nWhen Rocco graduated with a degree in Film from The American University of Rome in 2019, he was already well on the way to success in the film industry. By the end of his first year of studies, he had written the first draft for I Gemelli, (“The Twins”) a film that he would go on to present at the 2020 Festival of European Cinema.\n\n\"AUR has been a big part of my life and has influenced my work a great deal. It's only a small community but it's so intense. There are people from all over the world with different cultures and different backgrounds so it's impossible to be part of AUR and be a close-minded person - and if you're looking for inspiration or motivation, there's always someone there to provide it!\"\n\nFeride Eron (Film '20) is working as a Video Editor for a company created by women, for women.\n\n\"As the Video Editor, I’m in charge of the FemGems Club YouTube Channel. FemGems started as a podcast right before the pandemic hit. As the Covid-19 reality changed our lives, the monthly events they were organizing turned into online events. To share these events with each member and anyone considering joining the club, they decided to create a YouTube channel. That’s when I stepped in. Together with Dora, the founder of FemGems Club, we built a structure for the way we edit these online event recordings and we built up the YouTube channel.\n\nLooking back now, the most valuable experiences I had in AUR were definitely the one-credit trips I went on with my friends. It was something I didn’t really think of doing until my last two pre-covid semesters. And now I really cherish the memories I have from those trips"
