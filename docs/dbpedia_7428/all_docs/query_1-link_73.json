        "text": "In 1995, Nicole Kidman made “Batman Forever” for director Joel Schumacher. It wasn’t great.\n\nIn 1999, Nicolas Cage made \"8mm\" for director Joel Schumacher. It wasn't great, either.\n\nKidman went on to better things, and Cage went on to weirder ones. But given their first experience with a Schumacher film, why did either decide to sign up for a second?\n\nHard to say unless – heavens, no! – it had something to do with a large paycheck. But here they are, anyway, in “Trespass,” running around and making a lot of sound and fury.\n\nAt least the picture is shot beautifully – if Joel Schumacher rarely makes great motion pictures, at least he always makes pretty pictures.\n\nAnd so Kidman is like a Technicholor test shot, all ravishing red hair and shocking blue eyes. Cage looks – well, at least better than he’s looked recently, when he seemed to have a `70s carpet remnant glued to his head.\n\nBut “Trespass” isn’t just a bad movie. It’s a nasty one.\n\nCage is a diamond dealer and Kidman is his bored wife, and their comfortable lives are upended one evening when their home is invaded by a gang of creepy thugs in ski masks.\n\nIt’s the old sadistic melodrama. Soon Cage is being beaten, Kidman is having a gun pulled on her and their teen daughter is being threatened with the usual sleazy scenarios.\n\nTime for the Mom and Dad to fight back, and the thugs to lose it and turn on each other, right?\n\nWell, yes, of course, as we’ve seen in so many films. But the problem is, we’ve seen it in so many other films, it’s unclear why we need to see it here, all over again.\n\nA slumming David Fincher once breathed a little life into this set up with “Panic Room.” But “Trespass” just feels like a slightly slicker version of “Last House on the Left,” with heavy-breathing goons and lots of pain and punctured bodies.\n\nSchumacher makes it all look good – he can’t help himself – but somehow that just makes it nastier. A shaky, badly framed shot of someone getting his fingers broken can look queasily real. A well-lit, well-composed one only looks like professional, pornographic sadism.\n\nDespite the salaries promised to the two Nics, and the obviously nice production budget, the future does not look good for “Trespass”; although it’s getting a theatrical engagement, it’s already available on cable. “Rent it with your remote control” says the press release.\n\nBetter yet, hit the Exit button.\n\nRatings note: The film contains violence, drug use, strong language and nudity."
