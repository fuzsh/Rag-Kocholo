        "text": "Queen Marika the Eternal is the reigning divine sovereign of the Lands Between, and a vessel for the Elden Ring. Her offspring possess demigod status and are bearers of the Great Runes.\n\nOverview[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nMarika was a Numen and an Empyrean who hailed from the Shaman Village, a region whose people were ritualistically maimed and stuffed into jars by the Hornsent due to the proclivity for Shaman flesh to meld harmoniously with the flesh of others.[1][2] Those stuffed into the jars were believed to be reborn as saints.[3]\n\nAs an Empyrean, Marika was at some point guided by the Two Fingers to become a God,[4] and gifted a Shadowbound Beast, her half-brother Maliketh. She would later ascend to godhood at the Gate of Divinity atop the tower of Enir-Ilim,[5] becoming the vessel of the Elden Ring.[6] This affair from which gold arose and shadow was born would result in the birth of the Erdtree and Scadutree,[7] and go on to be considered a betrayal by the Hornsent.[8]\n\nBefore or after this event, Marika came into conflict with another Empyrean known as the Gloam-Eyed Queen. After emerging victorious, and desiring a world free of Destined Death, she removed the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring,[9] using Maliketh as a vessel to lock it away,[10] thus establishing the Golden Order.[11][12]\n\nPrior to or upon becoming a God, Marika took the warrior Hourah Loux as consort. After taking the beast Serosh upon his back to cease his ceaseless lust for battle, he became Godfrey, the first Elden Lord.\n\nEventually, Marika returned to the Shaman Village and found it abandoned. After cutting off a braid of her hair and leaving it as an offering to the Grandmother, she bathed her home in the healing light of gold and would never return.[13]\n\nAge of the Erdtree[]\n\nIn the early days, everything was in opposition to the Erdtree.[14] With Godfreyâ€™s aid,[15] Marika waged war against the Fire Giants atop the frigid northern mountains, whose Flame of Ruin was capable of burning the Erdtree.[16] Ultimately victorious, the Fell God of the Fire Giants was believed to have been slain by Marika.[17] Upon learning that the Flame of Ruin would never die, however, she cursed the last of the giants to tend to it for eternity.[18]\n\nMarika and Godfrey would rule together and have at least three children: Godwyn the Golden and the twins Morgott and Mohg. The twins were both born as accursed Omen and were hidden in the depths below the capital. Even so, Godfrey and his Golden Lineage would be counted as the first of the demigods.[19]\n\n(Liurnian Wars goes here)\n\nWith her rule secure, Marika announced her intention to search the depths of the Golden Order, declaring the early days of blind belief a thing long past.[20] When Godfrey's last foe fell it was said the hue of his eyes had faded.[21] Marika banished him and his kinfolk from the Lands Between, robbing them of their grace,[22] thus creating the first Tarnished, all in the hope that they would grow stronger by waging war in lands outside her rule, dying, and then eventually being revived with their guidance of grace returned.[23]\n\nMarika sent her son Messmer away on a crusade into the lands of the Hornsent. Despite her precautions, her fear of the Abyssal Serpent sealed within him led her to trap him within the Realm of Shadow, where he would wage war to exterminate the Hornsent and devastate their lands. No matter how many of her enemies burned in his flame, however, Mesmer received no sign from Marika to end his crusade, and so resentfully cursed his mother for abandoning him. To hide away these actions and the true nature of her godhood, Marika hid the Realm of Shadow behind a magical veil to obscure it from public knowledge.\n\nAfter Godfrey's banishment from the Lands Between, Marika took Radagon as second husband and King Consort, elevating him to become the second Elden Lord.[24] Radagon already had three children with Queen Rennala of the Carian Royal Family, and after his union with Marika, she would raise her new step-children, Radahn, Rykard and Ranni, to demigod status.[25]\n\nMarika and Radagon would go on to have two more children of their own, the twins Malenia and Miquella,[26] who like Marika herself and Radagon's daughter Ranni, were Empyreans,[27] and were thus potential successors to Marika. However, Radagon and Marika were in truth the same. Radagon was described as Marika's male \"other self\".[28] Thus the twins were the children of a single god, and they were both born afflicted: Malenia with rotting sickness and Miquella with eternal childhood.[29]\n\nNight of Black Knives[]\n\nOn the Night of Black Knives, a fragment of the Rune of Death was stolen from Maliketh.[30] For a long time it was not known who was behind the plot,[31] but it is finally revealed it was in fact Ranni who stole the fragment of the rune to forge godslaying black knives through a fearsome rite.[32]\n\nThe Black Knife Assassins, Numen women purported to have close ties to Marika herself,[33] used these knives to slay Godwyn the Golden, the first recorded death of a demigod in all history.[34] Queen Marika is said to have been driven to the brink by this event,[35] and some time later she shattered the Elden Ring using her hammer.[36] She had already instructed her demigod children to fight for the positions of Elden Lord and that of godhood.[37]\n\nThe Shattering[]\n\nFragments of the ring splintered into Great Runes and spread across the Lands Between, starting a conflict between her demigod children. War after war was fought, but there was no victor.[38] For her part, Marika would be imprisoned inside the Erdtree,[39] possibly by the Elden Beast or the Greater Will itself.[40]\n\nTrue to her promise to Godfrey and his warriors, grace was restored to the banished Tarnished.[41] They would rise from their graves, and journey to the Lands Between to once again brandish the Elden Ring. The Tarnished formed the Roundtable Hold, where they worked to realize the goal given to them by Marika. They would be served by a Misbegotten blacksmith named Hewg, whom Marika herself had charged with smithing a \"god-slaying weapon\" before his imprisonment in the Hold.[42]\n\nEndings[]\n\nEventually, a Tarnished champion manages to fight their way into the Erdtree, where the shattered Marika lay imprisoned. Marika is suddenly released from her bonds, with Radagon asserting control of their shared body and confronting the Tarnished. After defeating Radagon and the Elden Beast itself, the Tarnished may choose what to do with the fractured body of Marika. Marika's head is restored to her frame if the Elden Ring is mended, either by itself or with a Mending Rune. If Ranni is summoned, she picks up Marika's head gently, peacefully dissipating along with the rest of her body. If the Tarnished is the Lord of Frenzied Flame, Marika's head breaks apart and crumbles into ash.\n\nBy choosing to go down the Elden Lord path, whether the regular one or using any of the three Mending Runes to fix the Elden Ring within Marika, the Tarnished champion ushers in a new age. They become the third Elden Lord and effectively Marika's new consort in every one of them,[43] except in the Age of Stars (where they become consort to Ranni) and in the Lord of Frenzied Flame (where they make the whole world burn). However, Queen Marika remains shattered and unresponsive, with only the Elden Ring itself shining brightly within her body.\n\nEchoes of Marika[]\n\nIn certain sites of Grace, Melina can offer to share Marika's own words with the The Tarnished. These are compiled here.\n\nNotes[]\n\nMarika's Rune can be seen in Marika's Scarseal, Marika's Soreseal, and Messmer's implanted right eye. It resembles the crowning arc of the Elden Ring and her body crucified inside the Erdtree.\n\nWhen Marika's body changes into Radagon, her dress becomes his skirt.\n\nIt is heavily implied that the Elden Beast was the being who imprisoned Marika inside the Erdtree based on one of its attacks where it attempts to grab the player and lift them in the air to crucify them and then pierce them with a barrage of golden spears, similar to how Marika is seen crucified and pierced in the cutscene before the final boss battle.\n\nIt is probable, but never explicitly confirmed in-game, that Melina is also a child of Marika. Her internal name in the game files is \"MaricaOfDaughter\", she refers to her \"mother inside the Erdtree\", and most of the information about the Queen is gleaned from dialogue where Melina repeats Marika's own words at specific sites of grace.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nMarika is reminiscent of the alchemical concept of the White Queen. The White Queen is often depicted as one half of the Rebis (the other half being the Red King, referenced with Radagon), a single being possessing both male and female qualities, also sometimes referred to as the divine hermaphrodite. It is said that the Rebis hailed from one being that is separated into a male and female half until it is unified once again to form a transcendental being empowered by a dragon (corresponding to the Elden Beast).\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]"
