        "text": "films Inspiring change\n\nOver the decades’ many films have been made on environmental health issues from pesticides to flame retardants to climate change to wireless radiation. This is just a shortlist of awesome films that will inspire you on environmental health issues. EHT often sponsors environmental film festivals in our hometown of Jackson Wyoming, followed by an expert Q and A.\n\nWe will add more over time. So check back soon.\n\nInterested in a list of great films on cell phones, wireless and cell towers? Check out our section on Films on EMFs.\n\nAs a nonprofit organization, all proceeds from affiliate links are used to help fund the lifesaving work EHT does to protect and promote healthier indoor and outdoor environments everywhere.\n\nSTINK!\n\nSTINK! is a must-watch for all. It is amusing but goes straight to the point. It opens with a pair of kids pajamas- and a single father trying to find out what that smell could possibly be. But instead of getting a straight answer, director Jon Whelan stumbles on an even bigger issue in America, which is that some products on our store shelves are not safe — by design.\n\nWatch Stink.\n\nRachel Carson, The American Experience\n\nWhen Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring was published in 1962, the book became a phenomenon. A passionate and eloquent warning about the long-term dangers of pesticides, the book unleashed an extraordinary national debate and was greeted by vigorous attacks from the chemical industry. But it would also inspire President John F. Kennedy to launch the first-ever investigation into the public health effects of pesticides — an investigation that would eventually result in new laws governing the regulation of these deadly agents.\n\nRachel Carson is an intimate portrait of the woman whose groundbreaking books revolutionized our relationship to the natural world. Drawn from Carson’s own writings, letters, and recent scholarship, this film illuminates both the public and private life of the woman who launched the modern environmental movement and revolutionized how we understand our relationship with the natural world.\n\nWatch Rachael Carson on PBS\n\nToxic Beauty\n\nToxic Beauty is a documentary feature film with exclusive access to scientists, lawyers, advocates, regulators, politicians, a dynamic whistleblower, survivors, and women who have lost their lives. It follows the class action lawsuit against J&J and the plaintiffs, personal stories of women fighting for justice in a race against time with this deadly disease. Woven throughout the film is a human experiment. We document, as Boston University medical student, Mymy Nguyen, measures her chemical body burden from over 27 products. Scientists monitor her shocking results. In the end, the film meets the companies and people who offer solutions and optimism for safer, toxicant free cosmetics.\n\nWatch Toxic Beauty online!\n\nDark Waters\n\nAn incredible and true story of environmental attorney Robert Bilott uncovering the truth about Teflon, Dupont, and PFOA toxins over the years. He uncovers a dark secret that connects a growing number of unexplained deaths to one of the world’s largest corporations. While trying to expose the truth, he soon finds himself risking his future, his family, and his own life.\n\nWatch Dark Waters\n\nWatch News Coverage of the movie.\n\nBilott published a memoir Exposure: Poisoned Water, Corporate Greed, and One Lawyer’s Twenty-Year Battle Against DuPont\n\nTake Action after the film by going to the Dark Waters Take Action Website\n\nToxic Hot Seat\n\nToxic Hot Seat follows a courageous group of firefighters, mothers, journalists and scientists, politicians and activists as they fight to expose a shadowy campaign that persuaded legislators that toxic flame retardants were critically needed. In fact, there is no evidence that chemical flame retardants avoided a single fire death and growing evidence of their toxic legacy in our homes and bodies. The campaign to require the widespread use of these unnecessary toxic chemicals has taken nearly 40 years to unravel.\n\nWatch Toxic Hot Seat\n\nToxic Trespass\n\nFilmmaker Barri Cohen launches an investigation into the effects of the chemical soup around us starting with her 10-year-old daughter, whose blood carries carcinogens like benzene and the long-banned DDT. Then Cohen heads out to Windsor and Sarnia, Canadian toxic hotspots with startling clusters of deadly diseases. The filmmaker interviews activists working for positive change, along with doctors and scientists who see evidence of links between environmental pollution and health problems.\n\nToxic Trespass is available in two versions: an 80-minute Director’s Cut, and a 53-minute Television Hour, accompanied by a 67-page Resource Guide.\n\nA Healthy Baby Girl\n\nIn 1963, filmmaker Judith Helfand’s mother was prescribed the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES), meant to prevent miscarriage and ensure a healthy baby. But technology is rarely a benign midwife. In 1990, at age twenty-five, Helfand was diagnosed with DES-related cervical cancer. She went home to her family to heal from a radical hysterectomy. There she picked up her camera. Her video diary, A Healthy Baby Girl, was shot over five years and goes beyond loss to document mother-daughter love, family renewal, survival, political awakening, and community activism.\n\nWatch A Healthy Baby Girl\n\nRiverBlue\n\nDid you know it takes 2,700 liters of water – enough water for one person to consume in two and a half years – to make one cotton shirt? This documentary covers how the fashion industry is killing one of the most important sources of water and marine life – our rivers. The film follows conservationist Mark Angelo as he travels the globe to dive deep into one of the world’s most polluting industries, fashion.\n\nWatch RiverBlue\n\nThe True Cost\n\nThe True Cost focuses on fast fashion. It discusses several aspects of the garment industry from production—mainly exploring the life of low-wage workers in developing countries—to its after-effects such as river and soil pollution, pesticide contamination, disease, and death. Using an approach that looks at environmental, social, and psychological aspects, it also examines consumerism and mass media, ultimately linking them to global capitalism. The documentary is a collage of several interviews with environmentalists, garment workers, factory owners, and people organizing fair trade companies or promoting sustainable clothing production.\n\nWatch the True Cost\n\nThank You for Calling\n\n(2016) by Klaus Scheidsteger & Die Schneiderei This investigative film features top scientists and investigates how the cell phone industry has developed at incredible speed and is one of the most powerful industries in the world. “On the basis of facts, insiders and renowned protagonists the film reconstructs a major strategy of the mobile industry, making it a David versus Goliath type battle.”\n\nWatch Here after registering.\n\nAlso please be aware of a second film by Klaus Scheidsteger coming soon: THE COMPLEX IMPACT OF MOBILE PHONE RADIATION ON OUR HEALTH\n\nThis movie is available at www.faktencheck-mobilfunkstrahlung.de with 3 different versions (german/english/ french).\n\nOur Water, Land & Air\n\nThis mini-documentary from the WQED archives tells the stories of environmental neglect that led to positive change in our water, our land, and our air. Stories include the Donora Smog pollution tragedy of 1948, the environmental comeback story of Nine Mile Run, and a visit to the landmark home of Rachel Carson, a woman from Springdale, Pennsylvania who took on corporate America when few others would.\n\nWatch Mini Docs\n\nBlue Vinyl\n\nBlue Vinyl is a documentary film follows one woman’s quest for an environmentally sound cladding for her parents’ house in Merrick, Long Island, New York. It also investigates the many negative health effects of polyvinyl chloride in its production, use, and disposal, focusing on the communities of Lake Charles and Mossville, Louisiana, and Venice, Italy. It was aired on HBO as part of the series America Undercover.\n\nWatch Blue Vinyl\n\nIf this link does not work then go to Bull Frog Films\n\nYou can buy the film here.\n\nOverload: America’s Toxic Love Story\n\nby Soozie Eastman\n\nFilmmaker Soozie Eastman has just learned that hundreds of synthetic toxins are now found in every baby born in America, and neither the chemical companies who manufacture and market them nor a confusing patchwork of U.S. government agencies seem able or willing to protect citizens and consumers from the more than 84,000 chemicals currently in use in the foods and products we purchase daily.\n\nWatch Overload: America’s Toxic Love Story\n\nDeath by Design\n\nby Sue Williams\n\nIn an investigation that spans the globe, award-winning filmmaker Sue Williams investigates the underbelly of the international electronics industry and reveals how even the tiniest devices have deadly environmental and health costs. DEATH BY DESIGN tells the stories of young Chinese workers laboring in unsafe conditions, American families living with the tragic consequences of the industry’s toxic practices, activists leading the charge to hold brands accountable, and passionate entrepreneurs who are developing more sustainable products and practices to safeguard our planet and our future.\n\nWatch Death by Design"
