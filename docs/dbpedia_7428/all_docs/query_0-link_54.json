        "text": "The idea that a man who trespassed in Buckingham Palace and woke the Queen in her bed did not commit a criminal offense has left many people puzzled or skeptical. But British legal scholars say there is a clear basis in history and in the modern statutes for the decision against prosecuting Michael Fagan.\n\nTrespass as such - just entering someone else's property - was not historically a criminal offense, in this country or the United States. It was a tort, a civil wrong for which the property-owner could sue and get damages.\n\nIn fact, trespass was in many respects the basis of the whole law of torts. From the concept that an invasion of property gave the owner a legal right to monetary compensation, the judges of England over the centuries developed the complexities of property rights and civil remedies.\n\nThe criminal law was developed by judges, case by case, without legislation by Parliament. Scholars say trespass was not a crime at common law, as the body of judicial precedents was called.\n\nThe familiar sign ''Trespassers Will Be Prosecuted'' was therefore never really accurate in the old days. If it meant something beyond a general warning, it meant that the owner would sue trespassers for damages. Trespass Laws Narrowly Defined\n\nIn this century statutes have taken over just about the whole of the criminal law, in Britain and the United States, defining offenses more systematically. Some statutes have made trespass a crime - but under narrow circumstances.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
