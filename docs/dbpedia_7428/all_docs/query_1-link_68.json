        "text": "In the addled mind of the home-invasion thriller “Trespass” are a few half-baked notions about class warfare in America. Kyle Miller (Nicolas Cage), a loudmouthed wheeler-dealer whose glamorous house is taken over by thieves disguised as policemen, is a shady, fast-talking diamond trader up to his bulging eyeballs in debt. So much for privilege.\n\nThe invaders are a band of ragtag blue-collar types who refuse to believe Kyle when he insists he isn’t rolling in it. The other Millers include Kyle’s gorgeous, neglected wife, Sarah (Nicole Kidman), and their spoiled teenage daughter, Avery (Liana Liberato, a dead ringer for the vacuous Ashley Holmes from “The Real Housewives of New Jersey”).\n\nAt first “Trespass,” directed by Joel Schumacher from a screenplay by Karl Gajdusek, appears to have borrowed its story from “Kidnapped,” a recent, far superior Spanish horror film about an affluent family’s home-invasion nightmare in their fancy new house outside Madrid. But as “Trespass” develops, its greedy, calculating paterfamilias responds to the intruders’ murder threats by trying to bluff his way out of trouble using the same kind of deal-making fast-talk he is heard spouting to a client in the movie’s opening scene.\n\nBefore long you have the queasy feeling that Kyle is all too willing to sacrifice the lives of his wife and daughter (not to mention his own) to keep the thieves from grabbing whatever is stored in the wall safe whose combination he refuses to divulge. As Kyle, Mr. Cage gives one of his more demented performances. Not far into the movie you wish that he would just shut up or that the thieves would stuff a gag in his mouth and get on with their work. Of course, if they did there would be no movie.\n\nAnd so “Trespass” becomes a belabored, often laughable melee of sound, fury and unnecessarily frenzied cinematography in which everyone yells, screams and threatens while any sense of dread quickly drains away. The whole thing often plays like an unintentional farce. In the funniest laugh-out-loud moment, a bloodied Kyle shouts to his wife, “Your filthy lust invited them in.”\n\nThe back story: flashbacks reveal that Sarah may have eyes for the youngest thief, Jonah (Cam Gigandet), whom she recognizes beneath his mask. This baby-faced madman, who has exchanged his antipsychotic medication for Tic Tacs, once recently worked on the Miller property and is seen hauling his buff body out of their swimming pool while Sarah ogles him. Did they or didn’t they? Jonah, pathetically besotted with Sarah, implies that they did. And Kyle believes him.\n\nIn the movie’s tedious back-and-forth shouting matches, the guests reveal their struggles with addiction, mental illness, family strife and acute financial pressures. One has brought along a paralytic drug and a scalpel to extract a kidney for his ailing mother. The trendy word to describe all the characters is broken. Other not-so-fashionable words are unbelievable, dislikable, dull and stupid.\n\nSo why? Why would stars of the magnitude of Mr. Cage and Ms. Kidman sign on to a project whose screenplay is so inept that the movie, even if profitable, will stand as a career-impeding setback? Can’t they read? The same questions might be asked of the stars (Daniel Craig, Naomi Watts and Rachel Weisz) and even the director (Jim Sheridan) of the recent flop thriller “Dream House.”\n\nAs for class warfare, everyone loses.\n\n“Trespass” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence, gore and strong language."
