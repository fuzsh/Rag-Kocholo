        "text": "Directed by: Alberto Cavalcanti\n\nCat Out of the Bag Alert! This review contains some spoilers for this film!\n\nSynopsis: Aspiring writer Christopher Drew (Stephen Murray) explores the seedier side of life and gets in over his head when he witnesses a murder.\n\nPurr Blur: In one scene Frankie Ketchen (Rosalyn Boulter) and Christopher Drew are walking to her flat. A black cat crosses the road ahead of them.\n\nKitty Cameo: In a later scene, ex-con Herbert Edward Logan (Richard Todd) breaks into the apartment of an artist (George Hayes) who is passed out drunk. A white cat is standing nearby.\n\nLogan knocks over a plate of food which awakens the artist. The man stumbles toward Logan but then sees the white cat eating the food near the broken plate. The artists coos, “Kitty kitty kitty!” and meows before tottering back to his bed and collapsing.\n\nFinal Mewsings: Cats who live with drunken artists don’t mind burglars.\n\nMany thanks to Ted Davis for letting us know about the cats in this film!\n\nRelevant Links:"
