He's just back from a business trip and their teen daughter Avery is sneaking out to a party, when four thugs in security uniforms and ski masks stage a home invasion. They want what's in the safe: cash and diamonds. As Kyle stalls them, trying to negotiate for Sarah's freedom, the fault lines in Kyle and Sarah's marriage and the pasts of the four robbers come into play. Is there room here for heroism?",

        "text": "Nicolas Cage #53\n\nThis may be the ultimate attempt of making as hardcore a B-film as humanly possible. Schumacher directs an ensemble of folks who yell and scream so much it’s easy to get caught up in, but once out of the trance sends you crashing back into reality. Trespass is clearly inspired by the grimy films of late-night in the cleanest way possible, as we do not see anything overly sexual or bizarrely violent. Cage gets slapped around a bit here and is using a really subtle accent, but he’s very good as the patriarch of the family in distress. Alongside Cage is Nicole Kidman, who I always thought was overrated but has won me over with her performance in…\n\nOne of the worst things you could ever see. Trespass is removed from public conscience, nevertheless it should forever leave Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman secretly ashamed, and was a career-ending blight for director Joel Schumacher. It aspires to be a home invasion thriller that sets the bar above what’s been done before, but it’s bupkis –– the twists aren’t wallops, instead they are thuds to common sense. Worse, it manages to be one of the most unpleasant thrillers you could ever see. I don’t want to see the beautiful auburn-haired Kidman in a cocktail dress being slapped and whacked, hair-pulled and elbowed, and thrown to the ground. Perversely, I don’t want to see her get up, either. Stay down…\n\nWho takes their junkie girlfriend on a trip to burgle a house, anyway? That's just asking for trouble.\n\nSo I watched this for long enough to confirm that, yes, Nicolas Cage and Ben Mendelssohn have a big angry face-off, and yes, it's pretty fun. It's quite near the start, too, because in defiance of all confined-location-thriller logic this starts off volcanically shouty and riddled with whip-pans, and then stays on that level until you get bored of it. Cage does at least get a camp classic of a line later on - he has to use the phrase \"filthy lusts\" in a sentence, which is hard to imagine sounding natural coming from anyone, let alone Nicolas Cage - and that's…\n\nAn overwrought but trashily inviting thriller, Joel Schumacher's \"Trespass\" rides a terrifically hammy performance by Nicolas Cage to surprising near effectiveness. A preposterous home-invasion potboiler, the much-maligned film is more entertaining than its critics would make it out to be and not completely undeserving of some minor affection for its positive qualities.\n\nCage plays a down-on-his-luck diamond broker who becomes the target of a heist. Violating his family home, a group of fishnet-wearing ruffians attack the broker and his wife in order to steal diamonds, cash, and the broker's dignity. The ruffians, of course, may be in over their collective heads.\n\nThe story is a typical dramatic thriller where the family and the gang are found to be more connected…\n\nSee, your first mistake was making Nic Cage play a guy named 'Kyle'. No adults are named Kyle, that name is reserved for teenagers. Except Kyle MacLachlan, that man is an exception and can do no wrong.\n\nHollywood is a very 'what have you done for me lately?' kind of town, and Joel Schumacher has not done a lot for anyone lately (but to be fair, this was also a slow period for Cage and he managed to reinvent himself as a B-movie king, so who knows what could happen). Trespass is one of the most predictable and dull takes on a home invasion thriller that you can imagine, which is impressive since the runtime barely hits 90 minutes and…\n\nOpen it so we can all die, 'cause I don't give a fuck anymore!\n\n-Sarah Miller\n\nFriends know that I'm a big fan of Nicole Kidman. I understand her critics and I might even agree on most of what she's even criticized for, but regardless my fondness for the Aussie actress is stronger then ever. And really that's how it should be. If you have a favorite actor or actress don't let popular opinion interfere with that... unless you're a fan of Katherine Heigl, then you can just go fuck yourself.\n\nWith that said, God Almighty this is a train wreck. It's films like this that make me wonder if Joel Schumacher suffers from multiple personalities. It's almost impossible to…\n\nI don't know, I sort of liked the look of this. It has a nice cinematic look for a film that could possibly work as a one-set stage play. And Schumacher does an admirable job ratcheting up tension with some style and edginess despite having very little to work with.\n\nCage and Kidman are drifting apart. He's a workaholic and pays no attention to his family. Their teenage daughter is at that awkward age where all she wants to do is party. And Cage is a big-name in the diamond industry. Thieves break into their home to steal whatever riches lie in the house safe. That's about as sophisticated as the background depth gets. Regrettably, the script tries to make…"
