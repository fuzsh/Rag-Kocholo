The whole idea of a home invasion movie has been done and overdone, Another reason for me not to bother!\n\nBrian permalink\n\nI haven’t subjected myself to the celluloid feces that is a Schaumacher movie since 8mm. You’ve just confirmed what I’ve already know for well over a decade. He is incapable of making a movie that doesn’t make you want to gouge your own eyes out. Thanks for taking one for the team!"
