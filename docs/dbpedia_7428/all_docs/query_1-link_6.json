        "text": "In 1935 the very mysterious German-American novelist B. Traven wrote a book about the greed of gold prospectors called The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Thirteen years later John Huston adapted the book for the screen and cast Humphrey Bogart as the psychotic and Tim Holt as the moral man whose desire for earthly richness leads him to near hell. Huston loved Traven’s bitter, anti-capitalist parable, poured into it some of his own World War Two inspired pessimism and the result became one of the most influential adventure films ever made. Its effect was to be seen in several Sam Peckinpah pictures, like The Wild Bunch and it was spoofed in Blazing Saddles.\n\n44 years after Huston’s film and nearly 60 years after Traven’s book, long time collaborators Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis, who had done the empty-headed Back To The Future trilogy together, took the basic story of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre for a script about two Arkansas firemen who find a buried treasure map. They called the script “Looters” but the name was changed to Trespass because the film was released just months after the L.A. riots of 1992.\n\nTrespass was directed by Walter Hill and if you know his best or most popular work, films such as The Driver or The Warriors (which we showed last year on Moviedrome) or 48 Hrs, you will have an idea about the world we are about to enter, a world unloved by many mainstream film critics. Firstly, there are no women. Secondly, the action is tightly limited in space and time. Hill is influenced by classical drama and Aristotle’s idea of time and space. His actors almost look down the lens and declaim as a Greek chorus would.\n\nA third Walter Hill preoccupation is mixed race stories. There are black and white characters here and in Hickey & Boggs, 48 Hrs and The Warriors. We learn little about the past lives of the men. Hill once said “I very purposefully give my characters no back story”. Then there is the tension and violence which here builds to a climax in the last fifteen minutes.\n\nOn top of these there are new scenes. The film is obsessed by money. At one point William Sadler, who plays the Bogart part, explains his desire for gold:\n\n“I got mortgage payments on a house I just got kicked out of, plus my own rent money that just got jacked up on me, plus fucking taxes that get higher every fucking year just so guys like him can keep eating without doing any work. Now if that loot is here buddy I want it, and I’m not going to share it with some old bum.”"
