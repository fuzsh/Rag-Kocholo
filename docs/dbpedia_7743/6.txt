"Reading writing by K.J. Stevens is like deja vu; like dreaming. You'll find yourself thinking about a particular story of his, and momentarily wonder if it really happened to you in another life and you're only now remembering. And when you remember that it's a story, crafted by a most accomplished story-teller, you'll gasp at how much a part of the very fiber of your being it has become." ~ writer, Courtney McCrimmon
