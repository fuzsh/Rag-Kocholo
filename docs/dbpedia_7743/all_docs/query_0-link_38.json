Using a weekly hands-on application of knowledge acquired in the lecture portion of the course, students identify a clinical need and prototype their own clinical decision support solution. Solutions are then presented in a “shark tank” format to iteratively refine them to yield a final product that is capable of real-world implementation. Prerequisite: BIS 560 or CB&B 740. E. Melnick\n\nBIS 633a, Population and Public Health Informatics This is not a programming course or a mathematics course. The course provides an in-depth survey of the data standards, data analysis tools, databases, and information management systems and applications used in clinical population research, disease surveillance, emergency response information systems, and the like. It examines informatics techniques used on population-level data to improve health and the application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, policy, and decision support. This scientific area focuses on the capture, management, and use of electronic public health data. While these backgrounds are prominent in the field, the purpose of this course is to provide the history and context of the field. B. Coleman\n\nBIS 634a, Computational Methods for Informatics This course introduces the key computational methods and concepts necessary for taking an informatics project from start to finish: using APIs to query online resources, reading and writing common biomedical data formats, choosing appropriate data structures for storing and manipulating data, implementing computationally efficient and parallelizable algorithms for analyzing data, and developing appropriate visualizations for communicating health information. The FAIR data-sharing guidelines are discussed. Current issues in big health data are discussed, including successful applications as well as privacy and bias concerns. This course has a significant programming component, and familiarity with programming is assumed. Prerequisite: CPSC 223 or equivalent, or permission of the instructor. R. McDougal\n\nBIS 638a, Clinical Database Management Systems and Ontologies This course introduces database and ontology in the clinical/public health domain.

In terms of database technologies, the course describes two main approaches—SQL database and non-SQL (NoSQL) database —and shows how these technologies can be used to build electronic health records, data repositories, and data warehouses. In terms of ontologies, it discusses how ontologies are used in connecting and integrating data with machine-readable knowledge. The course reviews the major theories, methods, and tools for the design and development of databases and ontologies. It also includes clinical/public health use cases demonstrating how databases and ontologies are used to support clinical/public health research. Prerequisite: CPSC 223 or permission of the instructors. The general expectation to obtain instructor permission is that students have basic command of the Python programming language sufficient to pass CPSC 223 or the equivalent. K.H. Cheung, G. Hauser\n\nBIS 640b, User-Centered Design of Digital Health Tools This course combines needs assessment methods, user-centered design principles, and an agile approach to designing digital health tools for consumers. The class environment is designed to model that of a health tech start-up. Students are expected to apply what they learn from the lectures and readings to identify a pain point (i.e., a problem or need faced by a prospective user) and solicit input from intended users to design a prototype of the digital health tool. Solutions are presented in class to receive feedback on the design and to iteratively refine a prototype in order to create a minimum viable product. Prerequisite: BIS 560/CB&B 740, SBS 574, or permission of the instructor. T. McCall\n\nBIS 685a and BIS 686b, Capstone in Health Informatics Building on BIS 560/CB&B 740 and BIS 550/CB&B 750, this course provides the opportunity for master’s-level integration of basic informatics theory and practice through the use of modules focusing on the workflow of major health informatics projects. Students have two major projects throughout the course, including a team project where additional reflection on coordination of responsibilities and teamwork is essential. Each student is also able to work on a term-long individual module or choose to individually continue to advance the previous team project. The final projects are meant to show how the student integrates informatics theory, skills, and stakeholder’s needs into a final product or project that may be developed into a deliverable for general public use.

Students are expected to participate actively in a weekly discussion of a clinical case that illustrates principles of human physiology and pathophysiology at the whole-body, system, organ, cellular, or molecular level. Prerequisites: C&MP 550 and permission of the instructor. Credit for full year only. E. Boulpaep\n\nC&MP 610a and C&MP 611b/PTB 610a, Medical Research Scholars Program: Mentored Clinical Experience The purpose of the Mentored Clinical Experience (MCE), an MRSP-specific course, is to permit students to gain a deep understanding of and appreciation for the interface between basic biomedical research and its application to clinical practice. The MCE is intended to integrate basic and translational research with direct exposure to clinical medicine and patients afflicted with the diseases or conditions under discussion. The course provides a foundation and a critically important forum for class discussion because each module stimulates students to explore a disease process in depth over four ninety-minute sessions led by expert clinician-scientists. The structure incorporates four perspectives to introduce the students to a particular disease or condition and then encourages them to probe areas that are not understood or fully resolved so they can appreciate the value and challenge inherent in using basic science to enhance clinical medicine. Students are provided biomedical resource material for background to the sessions as well as articles or other publicly available information that offers insight to the perspective from the non-scientific world. During this course students meet with patients who have experienced the disease and/or visit and explore facilities associated with diagnosis and treatment of the disease process. Students are expected to prepare for sessions, to participate actively, and to be scrupulously respectful of patients and patient facilities. Prior to one of the sessions students receive guidance as to what they will observe and how to approach the experience; and at the end of the session, the students discuss their thoughts and impressions. All students receive HIPAA training and appropriate training in infection control and decorum relating to patient contact prior to the course. Y. Konnikova, R. Pierce\n\nC&MP 629a and C&MP 630b/PATH 679a and PATH 680b/PHAR 501a and PHAR 502b/PTB 629a, Seminar in Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, and Physiology Readings and discussion on a diverse range of current topics in molecular medicine, pharmacology, and physiology. The class emphasizes analysis of primary research literature and development of presentation and writing skills. Contemporary articles are assigned on a related topic every week, and a student leads discussions with input from faculty who are experts in the topic area. The overall goal is to cover a specific topic of medical relevance (e.g., cancer, neurodegeneration) from the perspective of three primary disciplines (i.e., physiology: normal function; pathology: abnormal function; and pharmacology: intervention). Required of and open only to Ph.D. and M.D.-Ph.D. students in the Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, and Physiology track.

Clinical settings will include the Yale-New Haven Hospital adult and pediatric wards, intensive care units, emergency rooms and urgent care services as well as the Smilow Bone Marrow Transplant Day Hospital. Students will be exposed to dermatologic disease requiring inpatient admission, systemic disease with cutaneous manifestations, and skin complications among hospitalized patients. Students will learn how dermatologists approach these patients, including: initial evaluation, workup, and differential diagnosis building; role of biopsy and histologic evaluation; and treatment plan design. Under resident supervision, the student will evaluate a new consult patient each day and follow this patient for the hospital course. The student is expected to read intensively on relevant disease processes and will formally present this patient to the attending on rounds. Additionally, the student should research disease and management-related questions that arise on the service and informally present a summary of findings to the attending and resident. One day a week (Wednesday), students will participate in departmental Grand Rounds and educational conferences. Two evenings a week, students will participate in resident rounds of the inpatient service. During the rotation, the student will identify a patient with a chronic dermatologic condition and conduct an in-depth interview to learn about how the disease and its treatment has affected the patient’s life and, conversely, how life considerations have affected disease management. Additionally, at the end of the rotation, the student will present a formal case presentation and literature review at Grand Rounds. This course is intended as introduction to inpatient dermatology for the student considering postgraduate training in dermatology.\n\nDermatology Outpatient Elective Students will be expected to acquire the skills needed by a primary care physician or surgeon to evaluate dermatological problems independently. Orientation location will be at the West Haven VA Medical Center. Outpatient experiences will include the West Haven VA Medical Center, the Adult and Pediatric Yale Primary Care Clinics, and possibly the Yale University Health Services. These clinics will expose the student to a variety of primary and referral dermatology services that treat inflammatory and neoplastic skin diseases. To gain an overview of the specialty, students will also have exposure to dermatologic surgery and dermatopathology. One day a week (Wednesday), students will participate in departmental Grand Rounds and educational conferences. Reading and review of assigned materials will be required in preparation for a series of case discussions led by faculty. A formal presentation on a topic of the student’s choice will be required in the final week. The goal of the course is to ground students in the fundamentals of dermatologic physical examination, diagnosis and treatment.\n\nEmergency Medicine\n\n464 Congress Avenue, Suite 260, 203.785.2353\n\nhttps://medicine.yale.edu/emergencymed\n\nProfessors M.

Loza\n\nClerkship\n\nSurgical Approach to the Patient Clerkship This twelve-week integrated clerkship block is composed of Surgery and Emergency Medicine rotations. As disciplines with a heavy emphasis on procedures and management of acute disease, Surgery and Emergency Medicine share didactic sessions and simulation-based training over the course of the rotation. An appreciation of the basic and clinical sciences, critical thinking, and problem-solving in a fast-paced varied environment is experienced by learners. Given the complexity of patients with acute and critical illness, a high degree of professionalism and emotional intelligence is an essential skill during these rotations.\n\nElectives\n\nEmergency Medicine Medical Simulation Elective During this two-week elective at the Yale Center for Medical Simulation (YCMS), students gain an immersive experience participating in medical simulation for medical education within the Yale School of Medicine. Students participate as learners in high-fidelity medical simulation cases and procedural sessions on topics related to the students’ desired specialty/topic of interest. Students also participate in medical simulation as educators and facilitators by participating as actors in medical simulation cases for medical students and residents rotating through YCMS. Students have the opportunity to participate in all educational activities within YCMS including simulation cases, debriefing sessions, procedural sessions, and in-situ simulations (simulations that take place in the clinical environment). Students also create and program a medical simulation case on their topic of interest under the mentorship of YCMS faculty, using evidence-based medicine resources. Students are given one-on-one instruction on how to program their case. Students can also participate in simulation-based journal clubs, a simulation debriefing course, and simulation-based medical student precede sessions.\n\nEmergency Medicine Point-of-Care Ultrasound Elective A two- or four-week experience that introduces the student to the use of ultrasound at the bedside. Attention is paid to image acquisition, machine optimization, and image interpretation. Students may perform cardiac, pulmonary, general abdominal, pelvic, soft-tissue, trauma, and hypotension evaluation ultrasounds. In addition, there are opportunities for the student to participate in supervised ultrasound-guided procedures (central and peripheral vascular access, abscess drainage, paracentesis, regional analgesia). The bulk of time is spent performing ultrasounds in the emergency department, with one half-day a week spent reviewing recorded examinations, their influence in clinical management, and scanning techniques. Educational materials are provided. While the focus of this rotation is the sonographic evaluation of the emergency patient, students considering almost any specialty may benefit as clinician-performed ultrasound continues to expand. Students are assigned daily scanning shifts that do not carry any clinical responsibility but offer exposure to the clinical environment. It is not the same as the combined Emergency Medicine/Ultrasound Subinternship, in which the student is primarily assigned clinical shifts to demonstrate knowledge, proficiency, and workflow, and also receives exposure to ultrasound through a few scan shifts and image review sessions.\n\nSubinternships\n\nCombined Emergency Medicine/Ultrasound Subinternship At Yale New Haven Hospital, combined emergency medicine/ultrasound subinterns complete a four-week rotation comprising ten clinical shifts, six scanning shifts dedicated to bedside ultrasound, and didactic activities. On clinical shifts, subinterns are expected to function as interns, evaluating patients primarily, managing multiple patients simultaneously, and presenting directly to the senior resident and attending physician. Students see a broad case mix in the emergency department and are expected to generate coherent, problem-focused, differential diagnoses. They are involved in all aspects of patient care including updating patients and families, calling consultants, and performing procedures. They rotate with a variety of attendings and are exposed to faculty from all sections of the emergency department, but they spend a majority of their shifts with ultrasound-trained faculty to maximize their ability to incorporate bedside ultrasound into clinical evaluation. Scanning shifts are dedicated to the skills of performing and interpreting bedside ultrasounds and are typically supervised by a senior resident or ultrasound fellow. Attention is paid to image acquisition, machine optimization, and image interpretation. Diagnostic pelvic, vascular, cardiac, pulmonary, biliary, trauma, and soft-tissue sonography are introduced. In addition, there are opportunities for the student to participate in supervised ultrasound-guided procedures (central and peripheral vascular access, abscess drainage, paracentesis). Didactic activities include resident educational conference and ultrasound image review. This is an advanced elective. Applicants must have completed or plan to complete an Emergency Medicine rotation prior to starting this elective.\n\nEmergency Medicine Subinternship At Yale New Haven Hospital, emergency medicine subinterns complete a four-week rotation comprised of clinical shifts and didactic activities. Students complete sixteen shifts of eight hours’ duration. Students are expected to function as interns, evaluating patients primarily, managing multiple patients simultaneously, and presenting directly to the senior resident and attending physician. Students see a broad case mix in the emergency department and are expected to generate coherent, problem-focused, differential diagnoses. They are involved in all aspects of patient care including updating patients and families, calling consultants, and performing procedures. They rotate with a variety of attendings and are exposed to faculty from the sections of education, ultrasound, critical care, global health, administration, and EMS. Didactic activities include resident educational conference, ultrasound image review, and simulation.

Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. S. Reilly, B. Lesch\n\nGENE 777b/MCDB 677b, Mechanisms of Development An advanced graduate seminar on animal development focusing on conserved mechanisms that govern germline development, embryogenesis, and somatic differentiation in molecular detail. The course runs in parallel to the Spring session of the Department of Genetics Seminar Series and is divided into two components: six Yale faculty-led lectures on core concepts in development and six combined journal club/student-led discussions with outside developmental biology speakers on their cutting-edge research. Over the course of the term, small student groups are responsible for presenting one journal club-formatted discussion on two papers selected from the outside speaker’s lab, as well as emceeing a dedicated question and answer session between the class and the speaker. This course provides a rare opportunity for students to actively engage with world leaders on their work in developmental genetics, epigenetics, and cell biology, as well as learn essential skills in experimental thinking and scientific communication. The course grade is based on forty percent take-home problems, forty percent class participation and twenty percent student-led journal club/distinguished speaker question and answer session. There are no official prerequisites. However, some familiarity with concepts and techniques of modern biology is necessary to get the most out of the course. K. Sumigray, Z.

Wang\n\nClerkship\n\nMedical Approach to the Patient Clerkship This twelve-week integrated block is composed of Internal Medicine and Neurology rotations. The course is structured to give clerkship students in-depth experience with the diagnosis and management of adult medical issues. Because of the significant clinical overlap between internal medicine and neurology, these two disciplines are combined to form the MAP experience. Students will rotate through eight weeks of internal medicine and four weeks of neurology during their MAP experience. In addition to rotation-specific didactics, students will attend the “Top Ten” series of didactics throughout their MAP block, covering common chief complaints that encompass diagnoses specific to internal medicine and neurology.\n\nElectives\n\nAllergy and Immunology Elective Students attend the Allergy & Immunology Clinic for adults at the Yale Allergy & Immunology Center in North Haven and the Allergy & Immunology Pediatric Clinic at Long Wharf. It is recommended that they attend the weekly Allergy and Clinical Immunology Seminar, followed by case discussions and Journal Club. They may also join in consultations with the Allergy & Immunology service at Yale New Haven Hospital. Prerequisite: Immunobiology course.\n\nAmbulatory Elective WEC This one-year weekly outpatient elective in the Yale Adult Primary Care Clinic provides experience in the longitudinal care of adult patients. Students are directly responsible for care of medical problems and preventive care as well as coordination of specialty care for their own patient panel. There are weekly pre-clinic conferences, which include Journal Club and primary care case-centered topics presented by students or specialty attending physicians. It is open to a limited number of senior medical students who have completed at least half of their clerkships (M.D.-Ph.D.) or most of their primary care clerkships (M.D.) Students are responsible for three patient visits/session. There are weekly pre-clinic conferences which include Journal Club and primary care case-centered topics presented by students.\n\nAnalytical Clinical Cardiology Elective This rotation emphasizes a rigorous history and physical exam to develop a differential diagnosis to guide the care of patients in the hospital and clinic. Supplementary reading on topics arising from the management of the patients is an important component of the experience. Interested students should discuss their goals prior to the rotation.\n\nCardiology Elective The student will participate in the daily activities of the inpatient cardiology consult service, including rounds and new consultations under the supervision of a fellow and attending. Students will be participating in clinical case conferences and gain exposure to procedures such as cardiac catheterization, stress testing, echocardiography, nuclear imaging, and electrocardiography. The training experience will emphasize the physiologic basis for clinical manifestations and therapy of cardiovascular diseases. A collection of pertinent review articles will be provided.\n\nCardiovascular Imaging Clinical Elective Working directly with the attending faculty, cardiology fellows, physician assistant, nurses, and imaging technologists within the imaging laboratories, students are involved with interviewing and examining patients referred for cardiac stress testing and learn about the appropriate use of multimodality cardiovascular imaging. They participate in the performance of both exercise and pharmacological stress imaging studies, as well as other targeted molecular imaging, and gain direct training and supervision in the performance and interpretation of these studies. In addition to the clinical training and exposure, students learn related cardiovascular physiology and gain exposure to other advanced imaging technology for the evaluation of cardiac and skeletal muscle perfusion and function in patients with suspected cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease.\n\nCritical Care Elective Senior students participate in critical care medicine activities in the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The emphasis is on evaluation and acute management of respiratory failure, shock, and sepsis, and on the use of invasive monitoring. The physiological basis of disease and the rationale for therapeutic interventions are also emphasized.\n\nEndocrinology Elective The student participates as an active member of the endocrine training program, making daily rounds with the endocrine fellows, residents, and attending physicians. The student works primarily on the inpatient consult service at Yale New Haven Hospital and has the opportunity to attend selected endocrine clinics. The student also participates in the regularly scheduled metabolism-endocrine conferences.\n\nGastroenterology Elective The student is an integral part of the inpatient GI consult service, working primarily in an inpatient setting. This is an opportunity to see a wide variety of gastrointestinal problems and patients, with discussion and review. Open to fourth-year students only.\n\nGeriatric Medicine Elective An introduction to the continuum of care for older adults. Students gain an understanding of the various geriatric syndromes that affect functions in the aging population and learn to identify basic geriatric syndromes such as memory loss, delirium, depression, falls, and polypharmacy. In addition, they are exposed to care planning, palliative care, and end-of-life care issues in a variety of settings, including hospital, subacute long-term care and outpatient sites, and system-wide consultation services. Prerequisite: Internal Medicine clerkships.\n\nHematology Elective This elective provides intensive exposure to clinical hematology by direct participation in the activities of a regular clinical hematology service. Students work up new patients and consults in rotation with the fellows and residents, and attend outpatient clinics. Students participate in daily hematology ward rounds and bone marrow readings, and in weekly inpatient and outpatient clinical reviews and clinical research conferences.\n\nHepatology Elective The student is an integral part of the inpatient liver service, working primarily in an inpatient setting. This is an opportunity to see a wide variety of liver problems and patients, with discussion and review. Open to fourth-year students only.\n\nHospital Medicine Firm (HMF) Elective This elective was started during the 2022–2023 academic year on the YNHH East Pavilion (EP) 5-5 Unit before transitioning to (and remaining on) the East Pavilion 9-7 Unit since. The EP 9-7 Unit is a busy general internal medicine service with high acuity and patient turnover. The unit includes thirty-four patient beds which are staffed equally by both the HMF and the Whitman (formerly Generalist) Firm. A capstone and unique service for senior residents, the HMF is staffed by two hospitalist attendings and (usually) two third-year residents in Internal Medicine. Given the high volume of clinical work, there are no formal rounds and no students otherwise scheduled on this service. However, through the Yale School of Medicine Performance Improvement Program (directed by Dr. Wijesekera), students can be provided the opportunity to rotate on the HMF to build their clinical skills prior to residency. Prior to the rotation, the students work closely with the director of performance improvement (also elective director) to create an individualized educational plan, which includes targeted resources to build their medical knowledge and clinical skills. During the rotation, elective students follow and provide clinical care for two to four patients at a time including, but not limited to, pre-rounding, writing notes, oral presentations, calling consultants, responding to acute events, updating families, and writing handoffs. The elective director, supervising attendings, and senior residents will meet regularly with the student to assess and provide feedback on their communication (with patients and health care team members), clinical skills (history, physical examination, clinical reasoning), and presentations (oral and written). The students will participate in all education for the residents (e.g., noon conferences, skills labs, ad hoc teaching activities).\n\nInfectious Disease Elective This elective offers a robust learning experience in general infectious diseases, including the diagnostic evaluation and management of common community-acquired and nosocomial infections in a diverse patient population, as well as infections in the immunocompromised patient. There are opportunities for learning in subspecialty areas such as medical microbiology, transplant ID, HIV/AIDS, hospital infection control, antimicrobial stewardship, and sexually transmitted diseases. Students function as active members of the consultation and training program in infectious diseases at Yale New Haven Hospital and are expected to attend and participate in daily attending rounds, microbiology rounds four times a week, weekly clinical case conferences, and monthly journal clubs. Evaluations are based primarily on performance in clinical case presentations on the consult service.\n\nMedical Intensive Care Elective This elective provides an opportunity to participate in the acute management of common medical emergencies. Students are on call in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) at Yale New Haven Hospital every fourth day with an intern and resident pair, assisting them in the admission of patients. Students follow patients in the MICU, assist in their care with the intern and resident, and are expected to present during rounds. Although students are exposed to a variety of ICU-based procedures, there are limited “hands-on” opportunities. Prerequisite: Internal Medicine Clerkship.\n\nNephrology Elective This elective in clinical nephrology offers the student an opportunity for in-depth learning regarding problems in fluid and electrolyte disturbances, acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, and hypertension. Emphasis is placed on problem recognition, pathophysiologic diagnosis, evidence-based clinical judgment, and management based on pathophysiologic principles. The primary activity involves the inpatient consultation service in which the student works up and follows several patients per week and participates in daily rounds with the attending physicians, postdoctoral fellows, and residents on service. An introduction to hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, renal transplantation, and renal biopsy histology is also provided.\n\nOccupational and Environmental Medicine Elective This rotation is designed to provide senior medical students (and PA and nursing students) with an introduction to the principles and practice of occupational and environmental medicine, including exposure, assessment, and evaluation of disease causality. Students learn how to evaluate workplace and environmental exposures and assess the contribution of such exposures to patients’ diseases. In addition, students participate in ongoing didactic and research conferences and workplace surveillance programs, and they visit workplaces and other environmental sites that are being evaluated for their role in disease causation. Students are exposed to the varied opportunities for careers in this discipline.\n\nOncology Outpatient or Inpatient Elective This is an advanced elective offered to students who have completed the third-year Internal Medicine Clerkship. It is designed to expose students to all aspects of clinical medical oncology by direct participation in the daily disease-specific outpatient oncology clinics at Yale Cancer Center. Working closely with the medical oncology fellows and attending physicians, students have the opportunity to work up patients with new cancer diagnoses and participate in the ongoing care of patients with diverse cancer diagnoses. Students participate as active members of the medical oncology training program, attending the regularly scheduled daily clinical conferences as well as weekly disease-specific multidisciplinary tumor boards and medical oncology fellow education conferences. Although the emphasis of the elective is on outpatient oncology in disease-specific units, students can also opt to work with the inpatient oncology team at Yale New Haven Hospital. Rotations at the VA Cancer Center can be arranged as well.\n\nPalliative/Hospice Medicine Elective (Branford, Connecticut) This fifty-two-bed inpatient program at the nation’s first hospice provides intensive palliative care for patients with terminal illness. The medical, psychological, and spiritual needs of these patients and their families are met through the coordinated efforts of an interdisciplinary team (IDT) of physicians, nurses, social workers, pharmacists, clergy, art therapists, and volunteers. Students work one-one-one with an attending physician caring for patients approaching the end of life and their families. They participate fully in admissions, morning rounds, family conferences, and IDT conferences. This elective offers students an opportunity to acquire advanced knowledge and skills in the management of symptoms (pain, anxiety, insomnia, etc.), which will benefit them in their future care of all patients, both those approaching the end of life as well as those who are acutely or chronically ill. It is the only elective in which symptom management receives a major focus. The goal of this elective is to learn to provide optimal symptom management and, as members of the IDT, to learn to care for patients approaching the end of life and to give support to their families. A four-week rotation, which allows for optional time spent with allied services and/or home care, is recommended, although a two-week rotation is available.\n\nPalliative Medicine Consultation Service Elective During this two-week rotation at the YNHH (York Street Campus) the medical student focuses on promoting quality of life and preventing suffering in patients with serious illness and their families and clinician providers across a broad scope of diseases by providing an extra layer of support. The experience encompasses intensive, hands-on inpatient clinical care of patients on the YNHH Adult Palliative Medicine Consultation Servic"
