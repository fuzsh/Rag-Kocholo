Flannery O'Connor Childhood Home in Savannah\n\nVisitors to O’Connor’s Childhood Home, one of the few museum houses in the country that is restored to the Depression-era, receive a guided tour that reveals the quiet domestic life of the young Mary Flannery and her family. Flannery called this “home” from when she was born in 1925 until when her family moved to Milledgeville. The Flannery O’Connor Childhood Home also offers a variety of free events throughout the year, including free Sunday lecture series in both the spring and the fall, and the Annual Ursrey Memorial Lecture, which has brought Michael Cunningham, Roxanne Gay, and Jaimy Gordon to Savannah.\n\nOpen Thursday - Sunday 10 a.m. - 5 p.m. Address: 207 East Charlton Street, Savannah, GA 31401\n\n2. Cline-O'Connor-Florencourt House in Milledgeville\n\nIf you're exploring Milledgeville on the Historic Walking Tour, you'll pass by this gorgeous house. Used as the residence for Georgia's Governor in 1838 and 1839 during the construction of the present Georgia's Old Governor's Mansion, the house is the family home of the late Flannery O'Connor. Flannery lived here briefly after her family's move to Milledgeville as a teenager. It remains in the family today and is a private residence.\n\nAddress: 311 W.

During the 13 years she lived at Andalusia, she completed the bulk of her literary work, as the farm’s environment influenced the setting of many of her writings. Walk the grounds, marvel at the peacocks, and be inspired by the surroundings that inspired Flannery herself.\n\nOpen Tuesday - Saturday, 10 a.m. - 4 p.m., and Sunday, 2 - 4 p.m. Tours begin on the hour, and the last tour begins at 4 p.m. Address: 2628 N.

Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Milledgeville\n\nFor more than 150 years, the ancestors of internationally acclaimed author Flannery O’Connor, a devout Catholic herself, have been instrumental in the development and growth of the Catholic Church in Milledgeville. The first Catholic resident of Milledgeville was Hugh Donnelly Treanor, Flannery O’Conner’s great-grandfather. Stop by to admire the church’s beautiful and unique Gothic Revival-style architecture and reminisce on a community that was a large influence on O’Connor’s life.\n\nAddress: 110 N Jefferson St NE, Milledgeville, GA 31061\n\n6. Special Collections Library in Milledgeville\n\nSpecial Collections is a section of Georgia College’s Ina Dillard Russell Library dedicated to the curation of documents documenting Milledgeville's past. Staff of the Ina Dillard Russell Library established the Flannery O'Connor Collection shortly after the first publication of O'Connor's short story \"The Geranium\" in 1946. The early collection consisted of newspaper clippings, magazines containing the first publications of stories, the published works, and some early items from O'Connor's student days at Peabody High School and Georgia State College for Women.\n\nWhile best remembered for her fiction, O'Connor was also an accomplished cartoonist; numerous examples of her artwork appear in the college newspaper, literary magazine and yearbook. Many of these publications are placed on display for visitors to admire throughout the year.\n\nResearch visits can be scheduled online. | 221 N. Clarke St., Milledgeville, GA 31061\n\n7.
