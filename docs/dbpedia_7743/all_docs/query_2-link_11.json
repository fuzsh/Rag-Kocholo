        "text": "I am intrigued by how we understand and express our evolving selves, and how this development is reflected in the things we make and do. I paint with cold wax and oils to produce abstract layered pictures that are meditations on experience. Through my work I explore the negotiation of self with the non-self, the internal with the external.\n\nWorking in cold wax, my process is one of building up and excavating layers and elements until an image reveals itself. I draw on my background in ceramics, portraiture, and printing to create multi-dimensional works with a unique history.\n\nI have shown my work in the US and abroad in both solo and group exhibitions, and in regional and national juried shows. My paintings have been published and are held in numerous private collections around the world.\n\nI have lived in the UK, Italy, and on both coasts of the US but have finally settled with my family in a forest in upstate New York, where I am inspired daily by the beauty of the area in all seasons."
