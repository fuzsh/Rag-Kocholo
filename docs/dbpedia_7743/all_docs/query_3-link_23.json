These titles have transformed cultures and have proven indispensable to those seeking to encounter God, as revealed in Jesus Christ through His Church.\n\nThe books are each elegantly bound and include a ribbon bookmark and a foreword and charcoal sketch of the book's author by Bishop Barron!\n\nYou will not only enrich your life with these works, you'll be proud to display these gorgeous editions in your home or office.\n\n\"As becomes unmistakably clear as you read through this collection, Flannery O’Connor was not only a masterful teller of tales; she was also one of the most perceptive literary theorists of the twentieth century. She once famously defined herself as a “hillbilly Thomist,” and the aesthetics of St. Thomas Aquinas do indeed inform the way she thought about her own work. \"\n\n- Bishop Barron"
