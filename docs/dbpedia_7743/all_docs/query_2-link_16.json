        "text": "Can insurance give you a competitive advantage during the Great Resignation? Yes, it can! Join our webinar to learn what makes employee benefits irresistible and how to monetize a happier, healthier work environment. ● Create packages that appeal to diverse candidates. ● Communicate benefits using video or mobile. ● Reduce turnover with proactive safety training. ● Minimize lawsuits with fast, friendly claims management. Insurance is your second highest expense after payroll. Register here https://bddy.me/3yXayGx to make the most of every dollar you spend.\n\nJob seekers and existing employees are highly influenced by career sites. Reviews that shine a light on poor benefits packages, hazardous work environments, or contentious claims management sends candidates and employees running in the opposite direction. On the flip side, having reviews that praise your benefits package or commitment to a healthy workforce is the incentive job seekers need to choose you. Read our blog to learn how EPIC creates cost-effective insurance strategies that help you attract and retain top talent by improving your online reviews. Contact us if you want to get started today! https://bddy.me/3AoVYdh\n\nIs your company contributing to the millions of new open job postings each month? Have you considered how a strategic insurance program could help? For example, innovative employee benefits and risk management programs could retain more of your staff and save you time and money in the process. Learn more or contact us today: https://bddy.me/3Nej1KG #riskmanagement #employeebenefits\n\nThe price of gasoline and groceries get all the headlines, but hospital pricing has become even more pertinent during the current time of soaring inflation. The cost of health care, too, is eroding the earning power of U.S. workers."
