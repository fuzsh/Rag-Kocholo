Then it was on to the University of Iowa, home to the famous Writers’ Workshop, where she rubbed elbows with some of America’s leading writers.\n\nMoving to New York, she began work on her first novel, but was diagnosed with lupus, the same incurable blood disease that killed her father. She moved back to Andalusia, the family farm in Milledgeville, but continued to write. She published her first novel, Wise Blood, in 1952 followed by a short story collection, A Good Man is Hard to Find."
