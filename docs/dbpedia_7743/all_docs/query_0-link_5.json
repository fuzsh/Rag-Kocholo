        "text": "\"Reading writing by K.J. Stevens is like deja vu; like dreaming. You'll find yourself thinking about a particular story of his, and momentarily wonder if it really happened to you in another life and you're only now remembering. And when you remember that it's a story, crafted by a most accomplished story-teller, you'll gasp at how much a part of the very fiber of your being it has become.\" ~ writer, Courtney McCrimmon\n\nK.J. Stevens (born June 4, 1973) is an American novelist and short story writer. He has written six books. In 2007, his first novel, Pilgrim's Bay was released. In 2016, Black, a novella, was published.\n\nStevens' writing style is described as minimalist. Ernest Hemingway, J.D. Salinger, Amanda Davis, Raymond Carver, David Shaw and Flannery O'Connor have been attributed as his influences.\n\nStevens was born in Alpena, Michigan. He attended Central Michigan University and studied creative writing at Hamline University in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Currently, he and his wife (artist, Brooke Stevens) live in Alpena, Michigan. They have two children."
