        "text": "Early Life\n\nMary Flannery O’Connor was born in Savannah, Georgia on March 25th, 1925 to Edward Francis O’Connor and Regina Cline O'Connor. She described herself as a “pigeon-toed child with a receding chin and a you-leave-me-alone-or-I’ll-bite-you complex.” The O'Connors moved from Savannah to Atlanta in 1938 just before Flannery's 13th birthday and then to Milledgeville the following year. Her father was diagnosed with lupus and passed away on February 1, 1941 when Flannery was 15-years-old.\n\n​\n\nEducation\n\nWhile in Savannah, Flannery attended St. Vincent's Academy and Sacred Heart School. Upon moving to Milledgeville, she attended and graduated from Peabody High School. She then entered Georgia State College for Women in an accelerated three-year program, graduating in June 1945 with a Social Science degree. In 1946, she was accepted to the University of Iowa on a Journalism scholarship with the intention of being a professional cartoonist. However, just one semester in, she transferred into the the now prestigious Iowa Writer’s Workshop. While there, she wrote her first short stories and started work on her first novel, Wise Blood. Following the University of Iowa, she spent some time writing at Yaddo.\n\n​\n\nAdulthood\n\nIn 1951, Flannery was diagnosed with disseminated lupus so returned to Georgia, settling at Andalusia, her mother's family farm in Milledgeville. Although expected to live only five more years, she managed thirteen. At Andalusia, she raised and nurtured some 100 peafowl. She describes her love of unique birds in an essay entitled “The King of Birds.” Despite her sheltered life, her writing reveals an uncanny grasp of the nuances of human behavior. She was a devout Catholic. She attended mass every day, collected and studied books on Catholic theology and at times gave lectures on faith and literature--traveling quite far despite her frail health. She also maintained a wide correspondence, including with such famous writers as Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop. She never married and stated that she was fulfilled by her relationship with God and her relationship with writing.\n\n​\n\nEnd of Life\n\nWhile battling lupus, Flannery completed more than two dozen short stories and her second novel. On August 3rd, 1964, complications from the same disease that had taken her father's life at the age of 45, took hers at the age of 39. She is buried in Milledgeville, Georgia at Memory Hill Cemetery with her parents.\n\n​\n\nAcclaim"
