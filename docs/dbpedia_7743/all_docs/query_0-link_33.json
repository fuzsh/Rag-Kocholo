Luhar, Anthony C. Jones, and Jonathan M. Wilkinson\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1363,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1363, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNitrate aerosol is often omitted in global chemistry-climate models due to the chemical complexity of its formation process. Using a global model, we demonstrate that including nitrate aerosol significantly impacts tropospheric composition fields, such as ozone, and radiation. Additionally, lightning-generated oxides of nitrogen influence both nitrate aerosol mass concentrations and aerosol size distribution, which has important implications for radiative fluxes and indirect aerosol effects.\n\nRadiative impact of improved global parameterisations of oceanic dry deposition of ozone and lightning-generated NOx\n\nAshok K. Luhar, Ian E. Galbally, and Matthew T. Woodhouse\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 13013–13033, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13013-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13013-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecent improvements to global parameterisations of oceanic ozone dry deposition and lightning-generated oxides of nitrogen (LNOx) have consequent impacts on earth's radiative fluxes. Uncertainty in radiative fluxes arising from uncertainty in LNOx is of significant magnitude in comparison with the present-day IPCC AR6 anthropogenic effective radiative forcing (ERF) due to ozone. Hence, uncertainty in LNOx needs to be explicitly addressed in relation to the GWP and ERF of anthropogenic methane.\n\nAssessing and improving cloud-height-based parameterisations of global lightning flash rate, and their impact on lightning-produced NOx and tropospheric composition in a chemistryâclimate model\n\nAshok K. Luhar, Ian E. Galbally, Matthew T. Woodhouse, and Nathan Luke Abraham\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 7053–7082, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7053-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7053-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLightning-generated nitrogen oxides (LNOx) greatly influence tropospheric photochemistry. The most common parameterisation of lightning flash rate used to calculate LNOx in global composition models underestimates measurements over the ocean by a factor of 20â25. We formulate and validate an alternative parameterisation to remedy this problem. The new scheme causes an increase in the ozone burden by 8.5 % and the hydroxyl radical by 13 %, and these have implications for climate and air quality.\n\nQuantifying methane emissions from Queensland's coal seam gas producing Surat Basin using inventory data and a regional Bayesian inversion\n\nAshok K. Luhar, David M. Etheridge, ZoÃ« M. Loh, Julie Noonan, Darren Spencer, Lisa Smith, and Cindy Ong\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 15487–15511, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15487-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15487-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWith the sharp rise in coal seam gas (CSG) production in Queenslandâs Surat Basin, there is much interest in quantifying methane emissions from this area and from unconventional gas production in general. We develop and apply a regional Bayesian inverse model that uses hourly methane concentration data from two sites and modelled backward dispersion to quantify emissions. The model requires a narrow prior and suggests that the emissions from the CSG areas are 33% larger than bottom-up estimates.\n\nA revised global ozone dry deposition estimate based on a new two-layer parameterisation for airâsea exchange and the multi-year MACC composition reanalysis\n\nAshok K. Luhar, Matthew T. Woodhouse, and Ian E. Galbally\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 4329–4348, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-4329-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-4329-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDry deposition at the Earthâs surface is an important sink of atmospheric ozone. A new parameterisation for ozone dry deposition to the ocean that accounts for relevant chemical and physical processes is developed and tested. It results in an ocean deposition loss that is only about a third of the current model estimates and corresponds to an increase of 5 % in the tropospheric ozone burden. This is important for tropospheric ozone budget, associated radiative forcing, and ozone mixing ratios.\n\nQuantifying the impact of global nitrate aerosol on tropospheric composition fields and its production from lightning NOx\n\nAshok K.

Alexander, Marcus J. Thatcher, Son C. H. Truong, Rachael N. Isphording, and John L. McGregor\n\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2024-84,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2024-84, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for GMD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe apply a comprehensive approach to select a subset of CMIP6 that is suitable for dynamical downscaling over Southeast Asia by considering model performance, model independence, data availability, and future climate change spread. The standardised benchmarking framework is applied to identify a subset of models through two stages of assessment: statistical-based and process-based metrics. We finalize a sub-set of two independent models for dynamical downscaling over Southeast Asia.\n\nContinental-scale bias-corrected climate and hydrological projections for Australia\n\nJustin Peter, Elisabeth Vogel, Wendy Sharples, Ulrike Bende-Michl, Louise Wilson, Pandora Hope, Andrew Dowdy, Greg Kociuba, Sri Srikanthan, Vi Co Duong, Jake Roussis, Vjekoslav Matic, Zaved Khan, Alison Oke, Margot Turner, Stuart Baron-Hay, Fiona Johnson, Raj Mehrotra, Ashish Sharma, Marcus Thatcher, Ali Azarvinand, Steven Thomas, Ghyslaine Boschat, Chantal Donnelly, and Robert Argent\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 2755–2781, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2755-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2755-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe detail the production of datasets and communication to end users of high-resolution projections of rainfall, runoff, and soil moisture for the entire Australian continent. This is important as previous projections for Australia were for small regions and used differing techniques for their projections, making comparisons difficult across Australia's varied climate zones. The data will be beneficial for research purposes and to aid adaptation to climate change.\n\nA machine learning approach for evaluating Southern Ocean cloud radiative biases in a global atmosphere model\n\nSonya L. Fiddes, Marc D. Mallet, Alain Protat, Matthew T. Woodhouse, Simon P. Alexander, and Kalli Furtado\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 2641–2662, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2641-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2641-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study we present an evaluation that considers complex, non-linear systems in a holistic manner. This study uses XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, to predict the simulated Southern Ocean shortwave radiation bias in the ACCESS model using cloud property biases as predictors. We then used a novel feature importance analysis to quantify the role that each cloud bias plays in predicting the radiative bias, laying the foundation for advanced Earth system model evaluation and development.\n\nDevelopment, intercomparison, and evaluation of an improved mechanism for the oxidation of dimethyl sulfide in the UKCA model\n\nBen A. Cala, Scott Archer-Nicholls, James Weber, N. Luke Abraham, Paul T. Griffiths, Lorrie Jacob, Y. Matthew Shin, Laura E. Revell, Matthew Woodhouse, and Alexander T. Archibald\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 14735–14760, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-14735-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-14735-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDimethyl sulfide (DMS) is an important trace gas emitted from the ocean recognised as setting the sulfate aerosol background, but its oxidation is complex. As a result representation in chemistry-climate models is greatly simplified. We develop and compare a new mechanism to existing mechanisms via a series of global and box model experiments. Our studies show our updated DMS scheme is a significant improvement but significant variance exists between mechanisms.\n\nSouthern Ocean cloud and shortwave radiation biases in a nudged climate model simulation: does the model ever get it right?\n\nSonya L. Fiddes, Alain Protat, Marc D. Mallet, Simon P. Alexander, and Matthew T. Woodhouse\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 14603–14630, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14603-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14603-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate models have difficulty simulating Southern Ocean clouds, impacting how much sunlight reaches the surface. We use machine learning to group different cloud types observed from satellites and simulated in a climate model. We find the model does a poor job of simulating the same cloud type as what the satellite shows and, even when it does, the cloud properties and amount of reflected sunlight are incorrect. We have a lot of work to do to model clouds correctly over the Southern Ocean.\n\nRadiative impact of improved global parameterisations of oceanic dry deposition of ozone and lightning-generated NOx\n\nAshok K. Luhar, Ian E. Galbally, and Matthew T. Woodhouse\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 13013–13033, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13013-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13013-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecent improvements to global parameterisations of oceanic ozone dry deposition and lightning-generated oxides of nitrogen (LNOx) have consequent impacts on earth's radiative fluxes. Uncertainty in radiative fluxes arising from uncertainty in LNOx is of significant magnitude in comparison with the present-day IPCC AR6 anthropogenic effective radiative forcing (ERF) due to ozone. Hence, uncertainty in LNOx needs to be explicitly addressed in relation to the GWP and ERF of anthropogenic methane.\n\nThe contribution of coral-reef-derived dimethyl sulfide to aerosol burden over the Great Barrier Reef: a modelling study\n\nSonya L.

Keywood, Todd P. Lane, Branka Miljevic, Yuko Omori, Alain Protat, Zoran Ristovski, Paul Selleck, Hilton B. Swan, Hiroshi Tanimoto, Jason P. Ward, and Alastair G. Williams\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 2419–2445, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2419-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2419-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoral reefs have been found to produce the climatically relevant chemical compound dimethyl sulfide (DMS). It has been suggested that corals can modify their environment via the production of DMS. We use an atmospheric chemistry model to test this theory at a regional scale for the first time. We find that it is unlikely that coral-reef-derived DMS has an influence over local climate, in part due to the proximity to terrestrial and anthropogenic aerosol sources.\n\nAssessing and improving cloud-height-based parameterisations of global lightning flash rate, and their impact on lightning-produced NOx and tropospheric composition in a chemistryâclimate model\n\nAshok K. Luhar, Ian E. Galbally, Matthew T. Woodhouse, and Nathan Luke Abraham\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 7053–7082, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7053-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7053-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLightning-generated nitrogen oxides (LNOx) greatly influence tropospheric photochemistry. The most common parameterisation of lightning flash rate used to calculate LNOx in global composition models underestimates measurements over the ocean by a factor of 20â25. We formulate and validate an alternative parameterisation to remedy this problem. The new scheme causes an increase in the ozone burden by 8.5 % and the hydroxyl radical by 13 %, and these have implications for climate and air quality.\n\nCoral-reef-derived dimethyl sulfide and the climatic impact of the loss of coral reefs\n\nSonya L. Fiddes, Matthew T. Woodhouse, Todd P. Lane, and Robyn Schofield\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 5883–5903, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-5883-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-5883-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoral reefs are known to produce the aerosol precursor dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Currently, this source of coral DMS is unaccounted for in climate modelling, and the impact of coral reef extinction on aerosol and climate is unknown. In this study, we address this problem using a coupled chemistry–climate model for the first time. We find that coral reefs make a minimal contribution to the aerosol population and are unlikely to play a role in climate modulation.\n\nTropospheric ozone in CMIP6 simulations\n\nPaul T. Griffiths, Lee T. Murray, Guang Zeng, Youngsub Matthew Shin, N. Luke Abraham, Alexander T. Archibald, Makoto Deushi, Louisa K. Emmons, Ian E. Galbally, Birgit Hassler, Larry W. Horowitz, James Keeble, Jane Liu, Omid Moeini, Vaishali Naik, Fiona M. O'Connor, Naga Oshima, David Tarasick, Simone Tilmes, Steven T. Turnock, Oliver Wild, Paul J. Young, and Prodromos Zanis\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We show that the current generation of models agrees well with observations, being particularly successful in capturing trends in surface ozone and its vertical distribution in the troposphere. We analyse the factors that control ozone and show that they evolve over the period of the CMIP6 experiments.\n\nDescription and evaluation of aerosol in UKESM1 and HadGEM3-GC3.1 CMIP6 historical simulations\n\nJane P.

Here, we comprehensively document and evaluate the aerosol schemes as implemented in the physical and Earth system models, HadGEM3-GC3.1 and UKESM1. This study provides a useful characterisation of the aerosol climatology in both models, facilitating the understanding of the numerous aerosolâclimate interaction studies that will be conducted for CMIP6 and beyond.\n\nQuantifying methane emissions from Queensland's coal seam gas producing Surat Basin using inventory data and a regional Bayesian inversion\n\nAshok K. Luhar, David M. Etheridge, ZoÃ« M. Loh, Julie Noonan, Darren Spencer, Lisa Smith, and Cindy Ong\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 15487–15511, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15487-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15487-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWith the sharp rise in coal seam gas (CSG) production in Queenslandâs Surat Basin, there is much interest in quantifying methane emissions from this area and from unconventional gas production in general. We develop and apply a regional Bayesian inverse model that uses hourly methane concentration data from two sites and modelled backward dispersion to quantify emissions. The model requires a narrow prior and suggests that the emissions from the CSG areas are 33% larger than bottom-up estimates.\n\nDimethylsulfideÂ (DMS), marine biogenic aerosols and the ecophysiology of coral reefs\n\nRebecca L. Jackson, Albert J. Gabric, Roger Cropp, and Matthew T. Woodhouse\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2181–2204, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2181-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2181-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoral reefs are a strong source of atmospheric sulfur through stress-induced emissions of dimethylsulfide (DMS). This biogenic sulfur can influence aerosol and cloud properties and, consequently, the radiative balance over the ocean. DMS emissions may therefore help to mitigate coral physiological stress via increased low-level cloud cover and reduced sea surface temperature. The importance of DMS in coral physiology and climate is reviewed and the implications for coral bleaching are discussed.\n\nComprehensive aerosol and gas data set from the Sydney Particle Study\n\nMelita Keywood, Paul Selleck, Fabienne Reisen, David Cohen, Scott Chambers, Min Cheng, Martin Cope, Suzanne Crumeyrolle, Erin Dunne, Kathryn Emmerson, Rosemary Fedele, Ian Galbally, Rob Gillett, Alan Griffiths, Elise-Andree Guerette, James Harnwell, Ruhi Humphries, Sarah Lawson, Branka Miljevic, Suzie Molloy, Jennifer Powell, Jack Simmons, Zoran Ristovski, and Jason Ward\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 11, 1883–1903, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-1883-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-1883-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Sydney Particle Study increased scientific knowledge of the processes leading to particle formation and transformations in Sydney through two comprehensive observation programs which are described in detail here. The data set and its analysis underpin comprehensive chemical transport modelling tools that can be used to assist in the development of a long-term control strategy for particles in Sydney and thus reduce the impact of particles on human health.\n\nCloud, precipitation and radiation responses to large perturbations in global dimethyl sulfide\n\nSonya L. Fiddes, Matthew T. Woodhouse, Zebedee Nicholls, Todd P. Lane, and Robyn Schofield\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 10177–10198, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-10177-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-10177-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe role of natural aerosol in the climate system is uncertain. A key contributor to marine aerosol is dimethyl sulfide (DMS), released by phytoplankton in the oceans. We study the effect of DMS on clouds and rain using a climate model with a detailed aerosol scheme. We show that DMS acts to reduce rainfall in cloud deck regions, leading to longer lived clouds and a large impact on solar energy reaching the surface. Further study of these areas will improve future climate projections.\n\nIsoprene and monoterpene emissions in south-east Australia: comparison of a multi-layer canopy model with MEGAN and with atmospheric observations\n\nKathryn M. Emmerson, Martin E. Cope, Ian E. Galbally, Sunhee Lee, and Peter F. Nelson\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 7539–7556, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-7539-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-7539-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compare the CSIRO in-house biogenic emissions model (ABCGEM) with the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN), for eucalypt-rich south-east Australia. Differences in emissions are not only due to the emission factors, but also how these emission factors are processed. ABCGEM assumes monoterpenes are not light dependent, whilst MEGAN does. Comparison with observations suggests that Australian monoterpenes may not be as light dependent as other vegetation globally.\n\nA revised global ozone dry deposition estimate based on a new two-layer parameterisation for airâsea exchange and the multi-year MACC composition reanalysis\n\nAshok K. Luhar, Matthew T. Woodhouse, and Ian E. Galbally\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 4329–4348, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-4329-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-4329-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDry deposition at the Earthâs surface is an important sink of atmospheric ozone. A new parameterisation for ozone dry deposition to the ocean that accounts for relevant chemical and physical processes is developed and tested. It results in an ocean deposition loss that is only about a third of the current model estimates and corresponds to an increase of 5 % in the tropospheric ozone burden. This is important for tropospheric ozone budget, associated radiative forcing, and ozone mixing ratios.\n\nComparison of VOC measurements made by PTR-MS, adsorbent tubesâGC-FID-MS and DNPH derivatizationâHPLC during the Sydney Particle Study, 2012: aÂ contribution to the assessment of uncertainty in routine atmospheric VOC measurements\n\nErin Dunne, Ian E. Galbally, Min Cheng, Paul Selleck, Suzie B. Molloy, and Sarah J. Lawson\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 141–159, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-141-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-141-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA comparison of measurements of 7 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in urban air by 3 different methods is presented. An uncertainty was calculated for each method and VOCs measured to provide some idea of the reliability of the data. Even when this uncertainty was accounted for, the measurements from the different methods did not agree for 4 of the 7 VOCs. Thus, there is unaccounted uncertainty in VOC measurements which must be considered when utilizing the data and assessing their reliability.\n\nEvaluation of climate model aerosol seasonal and spatial variability over Africa using AERONET\n\nHannah M.

Models used to predict impacts of future climate change have not been well tested for aerosols over Africa. In this study we evaluate aerosols in the CCAM climate model against observations across Africa and surrounding regions. We find the model generally captures observed variability but overestimates dust in northern Africa, which has implications for its representation of climate feedbacks.\n\nBiomass burning at Cape Grim: exploring photochemistry using multi-scale modelling\n\nSarah J. Lawson, Martin Cope, Sunhee Lee, Ian E. Galbally, Zoran Ristovski, and Melita D. Keywood\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 11707–11726, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-11707-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-11707-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA high-resolution chemical transport model was used to reproduce observed smoke plumes. The model output was highly sensitive to fire emission factors and meteorology, particularly for secondary pollutant ozone. Aged urban air (age = 2 days) was the major source of ozone observed, with minor contributions from the fire. This work highlights the importance of assessing model sensitivity and the use of modelling to determine the contribution from different sources to atmospheric composition.\n\nThe MUMBA campaign: measurements of urban, marine and biogenic air\n\nClare Paton-Walsh, Ãlise-AndrÃ©e GuÃ©rette, Dagmar Kubistin, Ruhi Humphries, Stephen R.

This campaign involved collaboration between several institutes and was undertaken to provide a case study for atmospheric models in a poorly sampled region of the globe.\n\nEfficiently modelling urban heat storage: an interface conduction scheme in an urban land surface model (aTEB v2.0)\n\nMathew J. Lipson, Melissa A. Hart, and Marcus Thatcher\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 10, 991–1007, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-991-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-991-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCity-scale models describing the surface energy balance have difficulties representing heat storage in urban materials. This paper proposes an alternative method to discretise heat conduction through urban materials. We compare the new method with an approach commonly used in urban models and find the new method better matches exact solutions to heat transfer for a wide variety of urban material compositions. We also find the new method improves the bulk energy flux response of an urban model.\n\nCurrent estimates of biogenic emissions from eucalypts uncertain for southeast Australia\n\nKathryn M. Emmerson, Ian E. Galbally, Alex B. Guenther, Clare Paton-Walsh, Elise-Andree Guerette, Martin E. Cope, Melita D. Keywood, Sarah J. Lawson, Suzie B. Molloy, Erin Dunne, Marcus Thatcher, Thomas Karl, and Simin D. Maleknia\n\nAtmos. Chem.

This region is known for its eucalypt species, which dominate the summertime global inventory. The Australian part of the inventory has been produced using measurements made on eucalypt saplings. The model could not match the measurements, and the inventory needs to be improved by taking measurements of a wider range of Australian plant types and ages.\n\nGridded global surface ozone metrics for atmospheric chemistry model evaluation\n\nE.

We find large contributions to annual mean ambient PM2.5 in residential sources regions resulting in significant but uncertain global premature mortality when key uncertainties in emission flux are considered. We show that residential emissions exert an uncertain global radiative effect and suggest more work is needed to characterise residential emissions climate importance.\n\nBiomass burning emissions of trace gases and particles in marine air at Cape Grim, Tasmania\n\nS.

We provide a unique set of trace gas and particle emission factors for temperate Australian coastal heathland fires, and attribute a major short-lived enhancement in emission ratios to a minor rainfall event. The ability of BB particles to act as cloud condensation nuclei, and the contribution of BB emissions to observed particle growth and ozone enhancements are discussed.\n\nBoundary layer new particle formation over East Antarctic sea ice â possible Hg-driven nucleation?\n\nR.

Thomas, A. D. Robinson, N. R. P. Harris, R. Johnson, and S. R. Wilson\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 15, 13339–13364, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-13339-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-13339-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn atmospheric new particle formation event that was observed in the pristine East Antarctic pack ice during a springtime voyage in 2012 is characterised in terms of formation and growth rates. Known nucleation mechanisms (e.g. those involving sulfate, iodine and organics) were unable to explain observations; however, correlations with total gaseous mercury were found, leading to the suggestion of a possible mercury-driven nucleation mechanism not previously described.\n\nModelled and observed changes in aerosols and surface solar radiation over Europe between 1960 and 2009\n\nS. T. Turnock, D. V. Spracklen, K. S. Carslaw, G. W. Mann, M. T. Woodhouse, P. M. Forster, J. Haywood, C. E. Johnson, M. Dalvi, N. Bellouin, and A. Sanchez-Lorenzo\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 15, 9477–9500, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-9477-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-9477-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluate HadGEM3-UKCA over Europe for the period 1960-2009 against observations of aerosol mass and number, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface solar radiation (SSR). The model underestimates aerosol mass and number but is less biased if compared to AOD and SSR. Observed trends in aerosols are well simulated by the model and necessary for reproducing the observed increase in SSR since 1990. European all-sky top of atmosphere aerosol radiative forcing increased by > 3 Wm-2 from 1970 to 2009.\n\nA spectral nudging method for the ACCESS1.3 atmospheric model\n\nP. Uhe and M. Thatcher\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 8, 1645–1658, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-1645-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-1645-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe describe a spectral nudging technique to constrain the large spatial structures of an atmospheric general circulation model (ACCESS1.3) towards an observational product (ERA-Interim). This has a number of applications for model development and scientific studies. This paper shows potential benefits of using the spectral nudging over the traditional Newtonian relaxation method.\n\nSeasonal in situ observations of glyoxal and methylglyoxal over the temperate oceans of the Southern Hemisphere\n\nS. J. Lawson, P. W. Selleck, I. E. Galbally, M. D. Keywood, M. J. Harvey, C. Lerot, D. Helmig, and Z. Ristovski\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 15, 223–240, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-223-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-223-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlyoxal and methylglyoxal are short-lived organic trace gases and important precursors of secondary organic aerosol. Measurements over oceans are sparse. We present the first in situ glyoxal and methylglyoxal observations over remote temperate oceans, alongside observations of precursor gases. Precursor gases cannot explain observed mixing ratios, highlighting an unknown source. We show a large discrepancy between calculated vertical column densities of glyoxal and those retrieved by satellite.\n\nSensitivity of cloud condensation nuclei to regional changes in dimethyl-sulphide emissions\n\nM. T. Woodhouse, G. W. Mann, K. S. Carslaw, and O. Boucher\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Emmons, Elizabeth W. Lundgren, Laura Hyesung Yang, Xu Feng, Ruijun Dang, Shixian Zhai, Yunxiao Tang, Makoto M. Kelp, Nadia K. Colombi, Sebastian D. Eastham, Thibaud M. Fritz, and Daniel J. Jacob\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 8607–8624, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8607-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8607-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTropospheric ozone is a major air pollutant, a greenhouse gas, and a major indicator of model skill. Global atmospheric chemistry models show large differences in simulations of tropospheric ozone, but isolating sources of differences is complicated by different model environments. By implementing the GEOS-Chem model side by side to CAM-chem within a common Earth system model, we identify and evaluate specific differences between the two models and their impacts on key chemical species.\n\nDevelopment of a detailed gaseous oxidation scheme of naphthalene for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation and speciation\n\nVictor Lannuque and Karine Sartelet\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 8589–8606, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8589-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8589-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLarge uncertainties remain in understanding secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation and speciation from naphthalene oxidation. This study details the development of the first near-explicit chemical scheme for naphthalene oxidation by OH, which includes kinetic and mechanistic data, and is able to reproduce most of the experimentally identified products in both gas and particle phases.\n\nLarge contributions of soil emissions to the atmospheric nitrogen budget and their impacts on air quality and temperature rise in North China\n\nTong Sha, Siyu Yang, Qingcai Chen, Liangqing Li, Xiaoyan Ma, Yan-Lin Zhang, Zhaozhong Feng, K. Folkert Boersma, and Jun Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Contributions of soil Nr emissions to O3 and secondary pollutants are revealed, exceeding effects of soil NOx or HONO emission. Soil Nr emissions play an important role in mitigating O3 pollution and addressing climate change.\n\nWhy did ozone concentrations remain high during Shanghai's static management? A statistical and radical-chemistry perspective\n\nJian Zhu, Shanshan Wang, Chuanqi Gu, Zhiwen Jiang, Sanbao Zhang, Ruibin Xue, Yuhao Yan, and Bin Zhou\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 8383–8395, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8383-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8383-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn 2022, Shanghai implemented city-wide static management measures during the high-ozone season in April and May, providing a chance to study ozone pollution control. Despite significant emissions reductions, ozone levels increased by 23 %. Statistically, the number of days with higher ozone diurnal variation types increased during the lockdown period. The uneven decline in VOC and NO2 emissions led to heightened photochemical processes, resulting in the observed ozone level rise.\n\nRevising VOC emissions speciation improves the simulation of global background ethane and propane\n\nMatthew J. Rowlinson, Mat J. Evans, Lucy J. Carpenter, Katie A. Read, Shalini Punjabi, Adedayo Adedeji, Luke Fakes, Ally Lewis, Ben Richmond, Neil Passant, Tim Murrells, Barron Henderson, Kelvin H. Bates, and Detlev Helmig\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 8317–8342, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8317-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8317-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEthane and propane are volatile organic compounds emitted from human activities which help to form ozone, a pollutant and greenhouse gas, and also affect the chemistry of the lower atmosphere. Atmospheric models tend to do a poor job of reproducing the abundance of these compounds in the atmosphere. By using regional estimates of their emissions, rather than globally consistent estimates, we can significantly improve the simulation of ethane in the model and make some improvement for propane.\n\nChanges in South American surface ozone trends: exploring the influences of precursors and extreme events\n\nRodrigo J. Seguel, Lucas Castillo, Charlie Opazo, NÃ©stor Y. Rojas, Thiago Nogueira, MarÃ­a Cazorla, Mario Gavidia-CalderÃ³n, Laura Gallardo, RenÃ© Garreaud, TomÃ¡s Carrasco-Escaff, and Yasin Elshorbany\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 8225–8242, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8225-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8225-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTrends of surface ozone were examined across South America. Our findings indicate that ozone trends in major South American cities either increase or remain steady, with no signs of decline. The upward trends can be attributed to chemical regimes that efficiently convert nitric oxide into nitrogen dioxide. Additionally, our results suggest a climate penalty for ozone driven by meteorological conditions that favor wildfire propagation in Chile and extensive heat waves in southern Brazil.\n\nEvaluating NOx stack plume emissions using a high-resolution atmospheric chemistry model and satellite-derived NO2 columns\n\nMaarten Krol, Bart van Stratum, Isidora Anglou, and Klaas Folkert Boersma\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 8243–8262, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8243-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8243-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents detailed plume simulations of nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide that are emitted from four large industrial facilities world-wide. Results from the high-resolution simulations that include atmospheric chemistry are compared to nitrogen dioxide observations from satellites. We find good performance of the model and show that common assumptions that are used in simplified models need revision. This work is important for the monitoring of emissions using satellite data.\n\nNOx emissions in France in 2019â2021 as estimated by the high-spatial-resolution assimilation of TROPOMI NO2 observations\n\nRobin Plauchu, Audrey Fortems-Cheiney, GrÃ©goire Broquet, Isabelle Pison, Antoine Berchet, Elise Potier, GaÃ«lle Dufour, Adriana Coman, Dilek Savas, Guillaume Siour, and Henk Eskes\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Results show a 3 % decrease in average emissions compared to the 2016 CAMS-REG/INS, lower than the 14 % decrease from CITEPA. The study highlights challenges in capturing emission anomalies due to limited data coverage and error levels but shows promise for local inventory improvements.\n\nAggravated surface O3 pollution primarily driven by meteorological variations in China during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period\n\nZhendong Lu, Jun Wang, Yi Wang, Daven K. Henze, Xi Chen, Tong Sha, and Kang Sun\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 7793–7813, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-7793-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-7793-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn contrast with past work showing that the reduction of emissions was the dominant factor for the nationwide increase of surface O3 during the lockdown in China, this study finds that the variation in meteorology (temperature and other parameters) plays a more important role. This result is obtained through sensitivity simulations using a chemical transport model constrained by satellite (TROPOMI) data and calibrated with surface observations.\n\nIdentifying decadal trends in deweathered concentrations of criteria air pollutants in Canadian urban atmospheres with machine learning approaches\n\nXiaohong Yao and Leiming Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 7773–7791, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-7773-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-7773-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates long-term trends of criteria air pollutants, including NO2, CO, SO2, O3 and PM2.5, and NO2+O3 measured in 10 Canadian cities during the last 2 to 3 decades. We also investigate associated driving forces in terms of emission reductions, perturbations from varying weather conditions and large-scale wildfires, as well as changes in O3 sources and sinks.\n\nEvaluation of modelled versus observed non-methane volatile organic compounds at European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme sites in Europe\n\nYao Ge, Sverre Solberg, Mathew R. Heal, Stefan Reimann, Willem van Caspel, Bryan Hellack, ThÃ©rÃ¨se Salameh, and David Simpson\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 7699–7729, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-7699-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-7699-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs) constitute many species, acting as precursors to ozone and aerosol. Given the uncertainties in VOC emissions, lack of evaluation studies, and recent changes in emissions, this work adapts the EMEP MSC-W to evaluate emission inventories in Europe. We focus on the varying agreement between modelled and measured VOCs across different species and underscore potential inaccuracies in total and sector-specific emission estimates.\n\nConstraining non-methane VOC emissions with TROPOMI HCHO observations: impact on summertime ozone simulation in August 2022 in China\n\nShuzhuang Feng, Fei Jiang, Tianlu Qian, Nan Wang, Mengwei Jia, Songci Zheng, Jiansong Chen, Fang Ying, and Weimin Ju\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We found that the inversion significantly improved formaldehyde simulations and reduced NMVOC emission uncertainties. The optimized NMVOC emissions effectively corrected the overestimation of O3 levels, mainly by decreasing the rate of the RO2 + NO reaction and increasing the rate of the NO2 + OH reaction.\n\nRevealing the significant acceleration of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions in eastern Asia through long-term atmospheric observations\n\nHaklim Choi, Alison L. Redington, Hyeri Park, Jooil Kim, Rona L. Thompson, Jens MÃ¼hle, Peter K. Salameh, Christina M. Harth, Ray F. Weiss, Alistair J. Manning, and Sunyoung Park\n\nAtmos. Chem.

This increase contradicts reported data, underscoring the need for accurate monitoring and reporting. Our findings are crucial for understanding and managing global HFCs emissions, highlighting the importance of efforts to reduce HFCs.\n\nInterpreting Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) geostationary satellite observations of the diurnal variation in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over East Asia\n\nLaura Hyesung Yang, Daniel J.

Yantosca, Heesung Chong, Junsung Park, Hanlim Lee, Won-Jin Lee, Soontae Kim, Eunhye Kim, Katherine R. Travis, James H. Crawford, and Hong Liao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 7027–7039, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-7027-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-7027-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) provides hourly measurements of NO2. We use the chemical transport model to find how emissions, chemistry, and transport drive the changes in NO2 observed by GEMS at different times of the day. In winter, the chemistry plays a minor role, and high daytime emissions dominate the diurnal variation in NO2, balanced by transport. In summer, emissions, chemistry, and transport play an important role in shaping the diurnal variation in NO2.\n\nAn intercomparison of satellite, airborne, and ground-level observations with WRFâCAMx simulations of NO2 columns over Houston, Texas, during the September 2021 TRACER-AQ campaign\n\nM. Omar Nawaz, Jeremiah Johnson, Greg Yarwood, Benjamin de Foy, Laura Judd, and Daniel L. Goldberg\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 6719–6741, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6719-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6719-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNO2 is a gas with implications for air pollution. A campaign conducted in Houston provided an opportunity to compare NO2 from different instruments and a model. Aircraft and satellite observations agreed well with measurements on the ground; however, the latter estimated lower values. We find that model-simulated NO2 was lower than observations, especially downtown, suggesting that NO2 sources associated with the urban core of Houston, such as vehicle emissions, may be underestimated.\n\nInterannual variability of summertime formaldehyde (HCHO) vertical column density and its main drivers at northern high latitudes\n\nTianlang Zhao, Jingqiu Mao, Zolal Ayazpour, Gonzalo GonzÃ¡lez Abad, Caroline R. Nowlan, and Yiqi Zheng\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We investigate the role of methane oxidation and biogenic and wildfire emissions in HCHO interannual variability over northern high latitudes in summer, emphasizing wildfires as a key driver of HCHO interannual variability in Alaska, Siberia and northern Canada using satellite HCHO and SIF retrievals and then GEOS-Chem model. We show SIF is a tool to understand biogenic HCHO variability in this region.\n\nThe impact of multi-decadal changes in VOC speciation on urban ozone chemistry: a case study in Birmingham, United Kingdom\n\nJianghao Li, Alastair C. Lewis, Jim R. Hopkins, Stephen J. Andrews, Tim Murrells, Neil Passant, Ben Richmond, Siqi Hou, William J. Bloss, Roy M. Harrison, and Zongbo Shi\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 6219–6231, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6219-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6219-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA summertime ozone event at an urban site in Birmingham is sensitive to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) – particularly those of oxygenated VOCs. The roles of anthropogenic VOC sources in urban ozone chemistry are examined by integrating the 1990–2019 national atmospheric emission inventory into model scenarios. Road transport remains the most powerful means of further reducing ozone in this case study, but the benefits may be offset if solvent emissions of VOCs continue to increase.\n\nTechnical note: Challenges in detecting free tropospheric ozone trends in a sparsely sampled environment\n\nKai-Lan Chang, Owen R. Cooper, Audrey Gaudel, Irina Petropavlovskikh, Peter Effertz, Gary Morris, and Brian C. McDonald\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 6197–6218, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6197-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6197-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA great majority of observational trend studies of free tropospheric ozone use sparsely sampled ozonesonde and aircraft measurements as reference data sets. A ubiquitous assumption is that trends are accurate and reliable so long as long-term records are available. We show that sampling bias due to sparse samples can persistently reduce the trend accuracy, and we highlight the importance of maintaining adequate frequency and continuity of observations.\n\nCombined assimilation of NOAA surface and MIPAS satellite observations to constrain the global budget of carbonyl sulfide\n\nJin Ma, Linda M. J. Kooijmans, Norbert Glatthor, Stephen A. Montzka, Marc von Hobe, Thomas RÃ¶ckmann, and Maarten C. Krol\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 6047–6070, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6047-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6047-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe global budget of atmospheric COS can be optimised by inverse modelling using TM5-4DVAR, with the co-constraints of NOAA surface observations and MIPAS satellite data. We found reduced COS biosphere uptake from inversions and improved land and ocean separation using MIPAS satellite data assimilation. Further improvements are expected from better quantification of COS ocean and biosphere fluxes.\n\nThe impact of gaseous degradation on the gasâparticle partitioning of methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\n\nFu-Jie Zhu, Zi-Feng Zhang, Li-Yan Liu, Pu-Fei Yang, Peng-Tuan Hu, Geng-Bo Ren, Meng Qin, and Wan-Li Ma\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 6095–6103, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6095-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6095-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGas–particle (G–P) partitioning is an important atmospheric behavior for semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). Diurnal variation in G–P partitioning of methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Me-PAHs) demonstrates the possible influence of gaseous degradation; the enhancement of gaseous degradation (1.10–5.58 times) on G–P partitioning is verified by a steady-state G–P partitioning model. The effect of gaseous degradation on G–P partitioning of (especially light) SVOCs is important.\n\nTechnical note: An assessment of the performance of statistical bias correction techniques for global chemistryâclimate model surface ozone fields\n\nChristoph Staehle, Harald E. Rieder, Arlene M. Fiore, and Jordan L. Schnell\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 5953–5969, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5953-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5953-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChemistry–climate models show biases compared to surface ozone observations and thus require bias correction for impact studies and the assessment of air quality changes. We compare the performance of commonly used correction techniques for model outputs available via CMIP6. While all methods can reduce model biases, better results are obtained from more complex approaches. Thus, our study suggests broader use of these techniques in studies seeking to inform air quality management and policy.\n\nA better representation of volatile organic compound chemistry in WRF-Chem and its impact on ozone over Los Angeles\n\nQindan Zhu, Rebecca H. Schwantes, Matthew Coggon, Colin Harkins, Jordan Schnell, Jian He, Havala O. T. Pye, Meng Li, Barry Baker, Zachary Moon, Ravan Ahmadov, Eva Y. Pfannerstill, Bryan Place, Paul Wooldridge, Benjamin C.

Veres, Jeff Peischl, Steven S. Brown, Allen H. Goldstein, Ronald C. Cohen, and Brian C. McDonald\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 5265–5286, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5265-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5265-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) fuel the production of air pollutants like ozone and particulate matter. The representation of VOC chemistry remains challenging due to its complexity in speciation and reactions. Here, we develop a chemical mechanism, RACM2B-VCP, that better represents VOC chemistry in urban areas such as Los Angeles. We also discuss the contribution of VOCs emitted from volatile chemical products and other anthropogenic sources to total VOC reactivity and O3.\n\nHigh-resolution US methane emissions inferred from an inversion of 2019 TROPOMI satellite data: contributions from individual states, urban areas, and landfills\n\nHannah Nesser, Daniel J. Jacob, Joannes D. Maasakkers, Alba Lorente, Zichong Chen, Xiao Lu, Lu Shen, Zhen Qu, Melissa P. Sulprizio, Margaux Winter, Shuang Ma, A. Anthony Bloom, John R. Worden, Robert N. Stavins, and Cynthia A. Randles\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 5069–5091, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5069-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5069-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantify 2019 methane emissions in the contiguous US (CONUS) at a ≈ 25 km × 25 km resolution using satellite methane observations. We find a 13 % upward correction to the 2023 US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (GHGI) for 2019, with large corrections to individual states, urban areas, and landfills. This may present a challenge for US climate policies and goals, many of which target significant reductions in methane emissions.\n\nSummertime tropospheric ozone source apportionment study in the Madrid region (Spain)\n\nDavid de la Paz, Rafael Borge, Juan Manuel de AndrÃ©s, Luis Tovar, Golam Sarwar, and Sergey L. Napelenok\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 4949–4972, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4949-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4949-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis source apportionment modeling study shows that around 70 % of ground-level O3 in Madrid (Spain) is transported from other regions. Nonetheless, emissions from local sources, mainly road traffic, play a significant role, especially under atmospheric stagnation. Local measures during those conditions may be able to reduce O3 peaks by up to 30 % and, thus, lessen impacts from high-O3 episodes in the Madrid metropolitan area.\n\nCO anthropogenic emissions in Europe from 2011 to 2021: insights from Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite data\n\nAudrey Fortems-Cheiney, Gregoire Broquet, Elise Potier, Robin Plauchu, Antoine Berchet, Isabelle Pison, Hugo Denier van der Gon, and Stijn Dellaert\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 4635–4649, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4635-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4635-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have estimated the carbon monixide (CO) European emissions from satellite observations of the MOPITT instrument at the relatively high resolution of 0.5° for a period of over 10 years from 2011 to 2021. The analysis of the inversion results reveals the challenges associated with the inversion of CO emissions at the regional scale over Europe.\n\nConstraining long-term NOx emissions over the United States and Europe using nitrate wet deposition monitoring networks\n\nAmy Christiansen, Loretta J. Mickley, and Lu Hu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 4569–4589, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4569-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4569-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work, we provide an additional constraint on emissions and trends of nitrogen oxides using nitrate wet deposition (NWD) fluxes over the United States and Europe from 1980–2020. We find that NWD measurements constrain total NOx emissions well. We also find evidence of NOx emission overestimates in both domains, but especially over Europe, where NOx emissions are overestimated by a factor of 2. Reducing NOx emissions over Europe improves model representation of ozone at the surface.\n\nAnalysis of an intense O3 pollution episode on the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula using photochemical modeling: characterization of transport pathways and accumulation processes\n\nEduardo Torre-Pascual, Gotzon Gangoiti, Ana RodrÃ­guez-GarcÃ­a, Estibaliz SÃ¡ez de CÃ¡mara, Joana Ferreira, Carla Gama, MarÃ­a Carmen GÃ³mez, IÃ±aki Zuazo, Jose Antonio GarcÃ­a, and Maite de Blas\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 4305–4329, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4305-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4305-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present an analysis of an intense air pollution episode of tropospheric ozone (O3) along the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, incorporating both measured and simulated parameters. Our study extends beyond surface-level factors to include altitude-related parameters. These episodes stem from upper-atmosphere O3 accumulation in preceding days, transported to surface layers, causing rapid O3 concentration increase.\n\nAtmospheric oxygen as a tracer for fossil fuel carbon dioxide: a sensitivity study in the UK\n\nHannah Chawner, Eric Saboya, Karina E. Adcock, Tim Arnold, Yuri Artioli, Caroline Dylag, Grant L. Forster, Anita Ganesan, Heather Graven, Gennadi Lessin, Peter Levy, Ingrid T. Luijkx, Alistair Manning, Penelope A. Pickers, Chris Rennick, Christian RÃ¶denbeck, and Matthew Rigby\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 4231–4252, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4231-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4231-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe quantity of atmospheric potential oxygen (APO), derived from coincident measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2), has been proposed as a tracer for fossil fuel CO2 emissions. In this model sensitivity study, we examine the use of APO for this purpose in the UK and compare our model to observations. We find that our model simulations are most sensitive to uncertainties relating to ocean fluxes and boundary conditions.\n\nImpact of improved representation of VOC emissions and production of NOx reservoirs on modeled urban ozone production\n\nKatherine R. Travis, Benjamin A. Nault, James H. Crawford, Kelvin H. Bates, Donald R. Blake, Ronald C. Cohen, Alan Fried, Samuel R. Hall, L. Greg Huey, Young Ro Lee, Simone Meinardi, Kyung-Eun Min, Isobel J. Simpson, and Kirk Ullman\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-951,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-951, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHuman activities result in the emission of many volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere that contribute to ozone air pollution. Detailed measurements were taken of VOCs during a field study in South Korea. When compared to models using current VOC emissions, large discrepancies pointed to underestimated emissions from chemical products, liquified petroleum gas, and long-range transport. We improved emissions and chemistry of these VOCs to better describe urban ozone pollution.\n\nMIXv2: a long-term mosaic emission inventory for Asia (2010â2017)\n\nMeng Li, Junichi Kurokawa, Qiang Zhang, Jung-Hun Woo, Tazuko Morikawa, Satoru Chatani, Zifeng Lu, Yu Song, Guannan Geng, Hanwen Hu, Jinseok Kim, Owen R. Cooper, and Brian C. McDonald\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 3925–3952, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3925-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3925-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work, we developed MIXv2, a mosaic Asian emission inventory for 2010–2017. With high spatial (0.1°) and monthly temporal resolution, MIXv2 integrates anthropogenic and open biomass burning emissions across seven sectors following a mosaic methodology. It provides CO2 emissions data alongside nine key pollutants and three chemical mechanisms. Our publicly accessible gridded monthly emissions data can facilitate long-term atmospheric and climate model analyses.\n\nOrganosulfate produced from consumption of SO3 speeds up sulfuric acidâdimethylamine atmospheric nucleation\n\nXiaomeng Zhang, Yongjian Lian, Shendong Tan, and Shi Yin\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 3593–3612, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3593-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3593-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric new particle formation (NPF) has a significant influence on the global climate, local air quality and human health. Using a combination of quantum chemical calculations and kinetics modeling, we find that thhe gas-phase organosulfate produced from consumption of SO3 can significantly enhance SA–DMA nucleation in the polluted boundary layer, resulting in non-negligible contributions to NPF. Our findings provide important insights into organic sulfur in atmospheric aerosol formation.\n\nContribution of expanded marine sulfur chemistry to the seasonal variability of dimethyl sulfide oxidation products and size-resolved sulfate aerosol\n\nLinia Tashmim, William C. Porter, Qianjie Chen, Becky Alexander, Charles H. Fite, Christopher D. Holmes, Jeffrey R. Pierce, Betty Croft, and Sakiko Ishino\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 3379–3403, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3379-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3379-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDimethyl sulfide (DMS) is mostly emitted from ocean surfaces and represents the largest natural source of sulfur for the atmosphere. Once in the atmosphere, DMS forms stable oxidation products such as SO2 and H2SO4, which can subsequently contribute to airborne particle formation and growth. In this study, we update the DMS oxidation mechanism in the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem and describe resulting changes in particle growth as well as the overall global sulfur budget.\n\nSpatial disparities of ozone pollution in the Sichuan Basin spurred by extreme, hot weather\n\nNan Wang, Yunsong Du, Dongyang Chen, Haiyan Meng, Xi Chen, Li Zhou, Guangming Shi, Yu Zhan, Miao Feng, Wei Li, Mulan Chen, Zhenliang Li, and Fumo Yang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 3029–3042, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3029-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3029-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the scorching August 2022 heatwave, China's Sichuan Basin saw a stark contrast in ozone (O3) levels between Chengdu and Chongqing. The regional disparities were studied considering meteorology, precursors, photochemistry, and transportation. The study highlighted the importance of tailored pollution control measures and underlined the necessity for region-specific strategies to combat O3 pollution on a regional scale.\n\nGlobal impacts of aviation on air quality evaluated at high resolution\n\nSebastian D. Eastham, Guillaume P. ChossiÃ¨re, Raymond L. Speth, Daniel J. Jacob, and Steven R. H. Barrett\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 2687–2703, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2687-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2687-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEmissions from aircraft are known to cause air quality impacts worldwide, but the scale and mechanisms of this impact are not well understood. This work uses high-resolution computational modeling of the atmosphere to show that air pollution changes from aviation are mostly the result of emissions during cruise (high-altitude) operations, that these impacts are related to how much non-aviation pollution is present, and that prior regional assessments have underestimated these impacts.\n\nEnhancing Long-Term Trend Simulation of Global Tropospheric OH and Its Drivers from 2005–2019: A Synergistic Integration of Model Simulations and Satellite Observations\n\nAmir H. Souri, Bryan N. Duncan, Sarah A. Strode, Daniel C. Anderson, Michael E. Manyin, Junhua Liu, Luke D. Oman, Zhen Zhang, and Brad Weir\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-410,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-410, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe explore a new method to make use of the wealth of information obtained from satellite observations of Aura OMI NO2, HCHO, along with MERRA2 reanalysis in NASA’s GEOS model equipped with an efficient tropospheric OH (TOH) estimator to enhance the representation of TOH spatial distribution and its long-term trends. This new framework helps us pinpoint regional inaccuracies in TOH and differentiate between established prior knowledge and newly acquired information from satellites on TOH trends.\n\nBias correction of OMI HCHO columns based on FTIR and aircraft measurements and impact on top-down emission estimates\n\nJean-FranÃ§ois MÃ¼ller, Trissevgeni Stavrakou, Glenn-Michael Oomen, Beata Opacka, Isabelle De Smedt, Alex Guenther, Corinne Vigouroux, Bavo Langerock, Carlos Augusto Bauer Aquino, Michel Grutter, James Hannigan, Frank Hase, Rigel Kivi, Erik Lutsch, Emmanuel Mahieu, Maria Makarova, Jean-Marc Metzger, Isamu Morino, Isao Murata, Tomoo Nagahama, Justus Notholt, Ivan Ortega, Mathias Palm, Amelie RÃ¶hling, Wolfgang Stremme, Kimberly Strong, Ralf Sussmann, Yao TÃ©, and Alan Fried\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 2207–2237, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2207-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2207-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFormaldehyde observations from satellites can be used to constrain the emissions of volatile organic compounds, but those observations have biases. Using an atmospheric model, aircraft and ground-based remote sensing data, we quantify these biases, propose a correction to the data, and assess the consequence of this correction for the evaluation of emissions.\n\nInvestigation of the renewed methane growth post-2007 with high-resolution 3-D variational inverse modeling and isotopic constraints\n\nJoÃ«l Thanwerdas, Marielle Saunois, Antoine Berchet, Isabelle Pison, and Philippe Bousquet\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 2129–2167, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2129-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2129-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the causes of the renewed growth of atmospheric methane (CH4) after 2007 using inverse modeling. We use the additional information provided by observations of CH4 isotopic compositions to better differentiate between the emission categories. Accounting for the large uncertainties in source signatures, our results suggest that the post-2007 increase in atmospheric CH4 was caused by similar increases in emissions from (1) fossil fuels and (2) agriculture and waste.\n\nRevisiting day-of-week ozone patterns in an era of evolving US air quality\n\nHeather Simon, Christian Hogrefe, Andrew Whitehill, Kristen M. Foley, Jennifer Liljegren, Norm Possiel, Benjamin Wells, Barron H. Henderson, Lukas C. Valin, Gail Tonnesen, K. Wyat Appel, and Shannon Koplitz\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1855–1871, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1855-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1855-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe assess observed and modeled ozone weekend–weekday differences in the USA from 2002–2019. A subset of urban areas that were NOx-saturated at the beginning of the period transitioned to NOx-limited conditions. Multiple rural areas of California were NOx-limited for the entire period but become less influenced by local day-of-week emission patterns in more recent years. The model produces more NOx-saturated conditions than the observations but captures trends in weekend–weekday ozone patterns.\n\nAir quality and radiative impacts of downward-propagating sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs)\n\nRyan S. Williams, Michaela I. Hegglin, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Hella Garny, and Keith P. Shine\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1389–1413, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1389-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1389-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDuring winter, a brief but abrupt reversal of the mean stratospheric westerly flow (~30 km high) around the Arctic occurs ~6 times a decade. Using a chemistry–climate model, about half of these events are shown to induce large anomalies in Arctic ozone (>25 %) and water vapour (>±25 %) around ~8–12 km altitude for up to 2–3 months, important for weather forecasting. We also calculate a doubling to trebling of the risk in breaches of mid-latitude surface air quality (ozone) standards (~60 ppbv).\n\nEstimation of the atmospheric hydroxyl radical oxidative capacity using multiple hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)\n\nRona L. Thompson, Stephen A. Montzka, Martin K. Vollmer, Jgor Arduini, Molly Crotwell, Paul B. Krummel, Chris Lunder, Jens MÃ¼hle, Simon O'Doherty, Ronald G. Prinn, Stefan Reimann, Isaac Vimont, Hsiang Wang, Ray F. Weiss, and Dickon Young\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1415–1427, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1415-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1415-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe hydroxyl radical determines the atmospheric lifetimes of numerous species including methane. Since OH is very short-lived, it is not possible to directly measure its concentration on scales relevant for understanding its effect on other species. Here, OH is inferred by looking at changes in hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). We find that OH levels have been fairly stable over our study period (2004 to 2021), suggesting that OH is not the main driver of the recent increase in atmospheric methane.\n\nInvestigating the differences in calculating global mean surface CO2 abundance: the impact of analysis methodologies and site selection\n\nZhendong Wu, Alex Vermeulen, Yousuke Sawa, Ute Karstens, Wouter Peters, Remco de Kok, Xin Lan, Yasuyuki Nagai, Akinori Ogi, and Oksana Tarasova\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1249–1264, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1249-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1249-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study focuses on exploring the differences in calculating global surface CO2 and its growth rate, considering the impact of analysis methodologies and site selection. Our study reveals that the current global CO2 network has a good capacity to represent global surface CO2 and its growth rate, as well as trends in atmospheric CO2 mass changes. However, small differences exist in different analyses due to the impact of methodology and site selection.\n\nThe effect of different Climate and Air Quality policies in China on in situ Ozone production in Beijing\n\nBeth S. Nelson, Zhenze Liu, Freya A. Squires, Marvin Shaw, James R. Hopkins, Jacqueline F. Hamilton, Andrew R. Rickard, Alastair C. Lewis, Zongbo Shi, and James D. Lee\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2910,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2910, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe impact of combined air quality and carbon neutrality policies on O3 formation in Beijing were investigated. Emissions inventory data was used to estimate future pollutant mixing ratios, relative to ground-level observations. O3 production was found to be most sensitive to changes in alkenes but large reductions in less reactive compounds led to larger reductions in future O3 production. This study highlights the importance of understanding the emission trajectories of organic pollutants.\n\nMeteorological characteristics of extreme ozone pollution events in China and their future predictions\n\nYang Yang, Yang Zhou, Hailong Wang, Mengyun Li, Huimin Li, Pinya Wang, Xu Yue, Ke Li, Jia Zhu, and Hong Liao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1177–1191, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1177-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1177-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study reveals that extreme ozone pollution over the North China Plain and Yangtze River Delta is due to the chemical production related to hot and dry conditions, and the regional transport explains the ozone pollution over the Sichuan Basin and Pearl River Delta. The frequency of meteorological conditions of the extreme ozone pollution increases from the past to the future. The sustainable scenario is the optimal path to retaining clean air in China in the future.\n\nEvaluating modelled tropospheric columns of CH4, CO, and O3 in the Arctic using ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements\n\nVictoria A.

Atmospheric models provide simulations that can inform policy. This study examines simulations of CH4, CO, and O3 by 11 models. Model performance is assessed by comparing results matched in space and time to measurements from five high-latitude ground-based infrared spectrometers. This work finds that models generally underpredict the concentrations of these gases in the Arctic troposphere.\n\nThe high-resolution Global Aviation emissions Inventory based on ADS-B (GAIA) for 2019â2021\n\nRoger Teoh, Zebediah Engberg, Marc Shapiro, Lynnette Dray, and Marc E. J. Stettler\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We describe an up-to-date 4D emissions inventory of global aviation from 2019 to 2021 based on actual flown trajectories. In 2019, 40.2 million flights collectively travelled 61 billion kilometres using 283 Tg of fuel. Long-haul flights were responsible for 43 % of CO2. The emissions inventory is made available for use in future studies to evaluate the negative externalities arising from global aviation.\n\nZonal variability of methane trends derived from satellite data\n\nJonas Hachmeister, Oliver Schneising, Michael Buchwitz, John P. Burrows, Justus Notholt, and Matthias Buschmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 577–595, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-577-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-577-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantified changes in atmospheric methane concentrations using satellite data and a dynamic linear model approach. We calculated global annual methane increases for the years 2019–2022, which are in good agreement with other sources. For zonal methane growth rates, we identified strong inter-hemispheric differences in 2019 and 2022. For 2022, we could attribute decreases in the global growth rate to the Northern Hemisphere, possibly related to a reduction in anthropogenic emissions.\n\nWeekly derived top-down volatile-organic-compound fluxes over Europe from TROPOMI HCHO data from 2018 to 2021\n\nGlenn-Michael Oomen, Jean-FranÃ§ois MÃ¼ller, Trissevgeni Stavrakou, Isabelle De Smedt, Thomas Blumenstock, Rigel Kivi, Maria Makarova, Mathias Palm, Amelie RÃ¶hling, Yao TÃ©, Corinne Vigouroux, Martina M. Friedrich, Udo FrieÃ, FranÃ§ois Hendrick, Alexis Merlaud, Ankie Piters, Andreas Richter, Michel Van Roozendael, and Thomas Wagner\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 449–474, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-449-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-449-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNatural emissions from vegetation have a profound impact on air quality for their role in the formation of harmful tropospheric ozone and organic aerosols, yet these emissions are highly uncertain. In this study, we quantify emissions of organic gases over Europe using high-quality satellite measurements of formaldehyde. These satellite observations suggest that emissions from vegetation are much higher than predicted by models, especially in southern Europe.\n\nCurrent status of model predictions of volatile organic compounds and impacts on surface ozone predictions during summer in China\n\nYongliang She, Jingyi Li, Xiaopu Lyu, Hai Guo, Momei Qin, Xiaodong Xie, Kangjia Gong, Fei Ye, Jianjiong Mao, Lin Huang, and Jianlin Hu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 219–233, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-219-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-219-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we use multi-site volatile organic compound (VOC) measurements to evaluate the CMAQ-model-predicted VOCs and assess the impacts of VOC bias on O3 simulation. Our results demonstrate that current modeling setups and emission inventories are likely to underpredict VOC concentrations, and this underprediction of VOCs contributes to lower O3 predictions in China.\n\nUtility of Geostationary Lightning Mapper-derived lightning NO emission estimates in air quality modeling studies\n\nPeiyang Cheng, Arastoo Pour-Biazar, Yuling Wu, Shi Kuang, Richard T. McNider, and William J. Koshak\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 41–63, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-41-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-41-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLightning-induced nitrogen monoxide (LNO) emission can be estimated from geostationary satellite observations. The present study uses the LNO emission estimates derived from geostationary satellite observations in an air quality modeling system to investigate the impact of LNO on air quality. Results indicate that significant ozone increase could be due to long-distance chemical transport, lightning activity in the upwind direction, and the mixing of high LNO (or ozone) plumes.\n\nThe suitability of atmospheric oxygen measurements to constrain western European fossil-fuel CO2 emissions and their trends\n\nChristian RÃ¶denbeck, Karina E. Adcock, Markus Eritt, Maksym Gachkivskyi, Christoph Gerbig, Samuel Hammer, Armin Jordan, Ralph F. Keeling, Ingeborg Levin, Fabian Maier, Andrew C. Manning, Heiko Moossen, Saqr Munassar, Penelope A. Pickers, Michael Rothe, Yasunori Tohjima, and SÃ¶nke Zaehle\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 15767–15782, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15767-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15767-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe carbon dioxide content of the Earth atmosphere is increasing due to human emissions from burning of fossil fuels, causing global climate change. The strength of the fossil-fuel emissions is estimated by inventories based on energy data, but independent validation of these inventories has been recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Here we investigate the potential to validate inventories based on measurements of small changes in the atmospheric oxygen content.\n\nCited articles"
