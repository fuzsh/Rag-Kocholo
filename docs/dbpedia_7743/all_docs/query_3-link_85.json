She wrote novels but was best known for her short story collections. She died of lupus in 1964 after fighting it for more than 10 years.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nBorn on March 25, 1925, in Savannah, Georgia, O'Connor is considered one of the greatest short story writers of the 20th century. She faced some hardships growing up, losing her father as a teenager; he died of systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nEarly on, O'Connor demonstrated her literary talents for school publications. Studying at what is now the University of Iowa for a master's degree, O'Connor's first story, \"The Geranium,\" was published in 1946. She had also begun what was to be first novel, Wise Blood, published in 1952.\n\nCommercial Success\n\nAfter graduating in 1947, O'Connor pursued her writing, spending time at several months at Yaddo, a Saratoga Springs, New York artists' retreat. Her work was informed by her experiences growing up as a Catholic in the South. Religion was a recurring theme in her work, and the main characters of her first and second novels were preachers of sorts.\n\nO'Connor was best-known, however, for her short stories, which appeared in several collections, including A Good Man Is Hard To Find and Other Stories (1955) and Everything That Rises Must Converge (1965).\n\nDeath and Legacy\n\nAfter battling lupus, an autoimmune disease, for more than a decade, O'Connor died on August 3, 1964, in Milledgeville, Georgia. For her work, she received many honors, including an O. Henry Award in 1957 and the National Book Award in 1972.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Flannery O'Connor\n\nBirth Year: 1925\n\nBirth date: March 25, 1925\n\nBirth State: Georgia\n\nBirth City: Savannah\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: Flannery O'Connor is considered one of the best short story authors of the 20th century.
