        "text": "CUTTING TEETH is a book of one hundred percent pure dynamite. It blows me away that K.J. Stevens is only 38 years old, and is writing at this level. This is a fine collection of short stories and journal entries that breathe beauty.\n\nThese stories are of the soil. Now, granted, sometimes that soil is rich and dark, but you need not worry, for you will be hooked. This is just a fine collection by a writer that just totally took me off guard. According to his biography, Stevens is the author of five previous books, and I'll go on record as saying this: I am going to personally going to hunt down every one of those titles, because this author left me hungry for more.\n\nTrust me, you will not go wrong investing in the work of K. J. Stevens. This is some unique, cutting-edge writing. I just love the book. So, in closing, what are you waiting for, kids? Get outta your chair, go down to your local bookstore. If they don't have a copy of CUTTING TEETH, have them order it. Make those book dealers do their jobs.\n\n~ Poet, B.L. Kennedy\n\nB.L.
