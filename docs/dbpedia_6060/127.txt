Things heat up between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni in the first trailer for “It Ends With Us,” which is soundtracked by Taylor Swift’s “My Tears Ricochet.”

The romance film is based on the best-selling novel written by Colleen Hoover. Lively stars as Lily, a small-town girl who moves to Boston to start her own business. There, she meets Ryle, a neurosurgeon finishing his residency played by Baldoni. The two instantly hit it off but are looking for different things.

“Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his ‘no dating’ rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place,” the book’s description explains. “As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.”

The film was originally slated for a Feb. 9 release. However, production shut down in June 2023 because of the WGA strike. After the strikes ended, filming resumed in January of this year. Now, Sony plans to debut the film on Aug. 9.

“Lily resonated with an enormous amount of people, as the success of the book made clear,” Lively, who also served as executive producer, told People. “Stepping into a character who’s had such a meaningful impact is an honor to take on. I loved Lily. And I hope that love is felt by those who care about her like I do, and also those who are getting to know her for the first time in this film.”

“It Ends With Us” is directed and executive produced by Baldoni through his company Wayfarer Studios.
