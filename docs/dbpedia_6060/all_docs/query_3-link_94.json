identifying how a work’s craft and structure reinforce its themes; recognizing how a work connects to others, and evaluating a work’s quality.\n\nPresent elements of dramatic structure (e.g. Aristotle’s Principles for Tragedy, the “Three Unities,” exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement)\n\nTeach, as relevant to the studied plays, dramatic sub-genres (e.g. Senecan Tragedy, Revenge Tragedy, Farce, and Romantic Comedy)\n\nInform students about elements of play staging (e.g. setting, props, costuming, blocking, pacing, and special effects).\n\nExplore through close reading, writing and discussion and/ or creative projects the major characteristics of Shakespearean language focusing on rhyme scheme, structure and meter.\n\nProvide critical approaches as relevant to the studied plays (e.g. psychological (Freudian, Jungian, etc.), economic (Marxist), gender (feminist and queer studies), and historical (New Historicism).\n\nExplore common themes in Shakespeare’s works which may include (e.g. fate, honor, betrayal, revenge, identity/ mistaken identity, madness, gender, and family)\n\nExplore major motifs in Shakespeare’s early works (e.g. celestial imagery, animals and nature, tyrants, clothes and disguise, sight and blindness, hell, demons and monsters, blood, sleep/visions, substitutions)\n\nOutcome 2: Critically think about Shakespeare and his contributions to Western literature and culture.\n\nFamiliarize students with William Shakespeare in terms of his biography and education.\n\nProvide an overview of Shakespeare’s greatest works and their contributions to Western literature.\n\nAcquaint students with the origins of Shakespearean drama in Greek theater, and the major figures who likely shaped his work.\n\nIdentify how Shakespeare contributed to the English language vocabulary.\n\nExplore the legacy of dramatic forms of tragedy, history, comedy and romance (e.g. Senecan Tragedy, Revenge Tragedy, Farce, and Romantic Comedy) and how genre shapes a play’s development.\n\nDiscuss how Shakespeare fundamentally changed English drama with innovated language and avant-garde approaches to plot and characterization.\n\nIntegrated characterization with plot\n\nMixed tragedy and comedy\n\nCreated new romantic tragedy genre\n\nUsed soliloquies to create complex characters\n\nOutcome 3: Draw on relevant biographical, social, cultural, historical, and political information to interpret Shakespeare’s purpose, perspective, and use of rhetorical, literary and dramatic techniques.\n\nIdentify key biographical, historical, social, and intellectual issues of the Renaissance, Reformation, and Tudor-Elizabethan England in relation to the plays.\n\nAnalyze the plays by comparing dramatic elements with selected intellectual, historical and/or biographical issues.\n\nFor later plays, apply comparative analysis to show development of dramatic methods.\n\nExplore relevant critical approaches to interpreting Shakespeare texts including, psychological, economic, gender and historical.\n\nOutcome 4: Engage in close reading, thoughtful discussion and self-reflection about the complex questions Shakespeare’s works present regarding the human experience.\n\nAssign regular prompts for discussion and/ or writing that explore Shakespeare’s themes regarding the human condition which could include:\n\nDifferent manifestations of love\n\nNature of time and human mortality\n\nImplications of Revenge\n\nIdeas of Family honor\n\nCauses and effects of jealousy\n\nInfluences of War\n\nImplications of Ambition\n\nKingship\n\nThe role of fate and freewill\n\nThe role of justice and law\n\nWealth and corruption\n\nReligion and faith\n\nForgiveness and mercy\n\nThe nature of love and marriage\n\nIdeas of gender\n\nThe role of women\n\nImplications of sexuality and unbridled emotion\n\nThe role of class and social status\n\nThe relationship between parents and children\n\nAppearances versus reality\n\nInterrelation responsibility, loyalty and power\n\nThe nature of suffering\n\nProvide opportunities for students to contemplate Shakespeare’s relevance to today and to their own experience. Consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is the nature of innocence and what are the implications of being too trusting?\n\nWhat is the role of honor in the human experience?\n\nTo what extent can humility and discretion save life?\n\nWhy do humans seek revenge and is it ever justified?\n\nWhat are the relative positions of men and women in the marriage relationship?\n\nWhat is the nature of love and is it always for sale?\n\nTo what extent can we successfully escape predetermined roles and expectations, including gender roles?\n\nWhy is it so difficult to make relationships work?\n\nWhy is there a need for a balance between the rational and irrational, between rules and magic, in the interests of love, harmony and creativity?\n\nWhy are people and events often not as they seem?\n\nWhy does creativity rely on the unconscious, the magical, and the mysterious?\n\nWhat are the many forms love takes?\n\nWhy is young love often impetuous?\n\nIs hate irrational? Can it destroy love?\n\nWhy do young people struggle to make their own choices? How do parents' vested interests contribute to the struggle?\n\nDoes fate exist?\n\nHow do chance and choice mix to determine outcomes?\n\nWhat are the implications of pride and vanity?\n\nWhat are implications of passivity?\n\nDoes divine right exist?\n\nHow does Shakespeare indicate that time may be conquered in his works?\n\nDiscuss the theme of immortality as presented in his works.\n\nWhat role does nature play in Shakespeare’s works?\n\nHow do gossip, conversation and overhearing function?\n\nExplore what Shakespeare’s works say about relationships between men and women.\n\nWhat is the nature of honor?\n\nConsider the concept of deception and its many manifestations.\n\nWhat makes a villain?\n\nConsider the validity and usefulness of revenge.\n\nWhat are motivations for jealousy?\n\nConsider how age, social position and race affect relationships.\n\nWhat makes relationship healthy and unhealthy?\n\nWhat happens when ambition oversteps moral boundaries?\n\nWhen does appropriate use of power become tyranny?\n\nTo what extent do we control our own destinies?\n\nHow are people and events often not what they seem?\n\nWhat happens to the natural world when morality is disregarded?\n\nHow are light and darkness connected to good and evil?\n\nHow do children both represent the future and highlight evil?\n\nHow does sleep represent a facture of moral order?\n\nHow do visions represent guilty conscience?\n\nCan there be wealth without corruption?

Can you have one without the other?\n\nOutcome 5: Demonstrate critical thinking about contemporary Western culture adaptations (filmic and/or theatrical) of a selection of Shakespeare’s works.\n\nDefine the nature of adaptation as it relates to film and theater and consider the problem of adaptation.\n\nEmphasize careful viewing of the films and theater, applying an understanding of filmic elements to accomplish interpretative goals.\n\nFamiliarize students with elements of film and theater including mise-en-scène, staging, cinematography, sound, and editing.\n\nUpon viewing the assigned films and/or theater, observe and evaluate how Shakespeare has been remade across time and across continents. Discussions may include the following questions:\n\nDo elements of film (mise-en-scène, cinematography, sounds, etc.) enhance or detract from an audiences’ understanding of the “original” work?\n\nEvaluate a director’s decision to remake characters. How do these alterations contribute to or detract from understanding?\n\nAssess a director’s decisions to invent character backstories. Is this an effective technique?\n\nEvaluate a director’s decision to retain the Shakespearean language, character and plot, abandon it completely, or create some sort of hybrid where some “original” elements are kept and others are modernized.

How effective is it?\n\nOutcome 6: Compose critical close reading analyses of literary texts using MLA format, citing and explaining textual evidence in support of a thesis.\n\nEmphasize close reading as the means to composing thoughtful, critical analyses.\n\nPractice in-depth formal literary criticism, applying relevant critical opinions to one’s own analysis and interpretation of Shakespearean plays (both text and visual). Illustrate these in writing assignments using appropriate selected examples from the plays and from the scholars.\n\nFor later plays, practice comparative analysis of applicable literary approaches and “schools” of literary analysis including theories of “the other,” feminist theory, gender studies, diversity issues, New Historicism, and psychological and economical approaches.\n\nDevelop an understanding of interrelating themes and motifs Shakespeare’s works through discussion, regular writing prompts, close reading essays, and/or creative projects.\n\nInstruct students about how to use thematic instances to arrive at general conclusions regarding how the theme works in the analyzed texts.\n\nTeach students how to read carefully, looking for the selected theme or motif and possibly researching ways in which other critics have examined the theme.\n\nShow students how to organize their responses around the works, making each point deal with a distinct work. Emphasize connections and transitions.\n\nIntroduce students to the OWL Purdue Online Writing Lab as a resource to help them with all aspects of essay writing including thesis and content generation, citation, organization, and proper formatting: https://owl.english.purdue.edu\n\nThrough lecture, teach students “tracking” methods to help them achieve a rich understanding of the text including highlighting, marginal notes, free writing, etc.\n\nReview with students the “pitfalls” to literary analysis including plot summary, black and white thinking, and everything is “subjective.”\n\nSuggested Texts and Materials\n\nTexts should include a sampling of Shakespearean works:\n\n1589: Comedy of Errors\n\n1590: Henry VI, Part III; Henry VI, Part II\n\n1591: Henry VI, Part 1\n\n1592: Richard III\n\n1593: Titus Andronicus; Taming of the Shrew\n\n1594: Two Gentlemen of Verona; Romeo and Juliet; Loves Labours’s Lost\n\n1595: Midsummer Night’s Dream; Richard II\n\n1596: King John; Merchant of Venice\n\n1597: Henry IV, Part II; Henry IV, Part I\n\n1598: Much Ado about Nothing; Henry V\n\n1599: Julius Caesar; As You Like It; Twelfth Night\n\n1600: Hamlet; Merry Wives of Windsor\n\n1601: Troilus and Cressida\n\n1602: All’s Well That Ends Well\n\n1604: Othello; Measure for Measure\n\n1605: Macbeth; King Lear\n\n1606: Antony and Cleopatra\n\n1607: Timon of Athens; Coriolanus\n\n1608: Pericles\n\n1609: Cymbeline\n\n1610: Winter’s Tale\n\n1611: Tempest\n\n1612: Henry VIII\n\nFilm Resources:\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew (BBC Shakespeare RE-told, 2005);\n\nAdrian Noble, A Midsummer Night’s Dream (2000);\n\nBaz Luhrmann, Romeo and Juliet (1996);\n\nRupert Goold, Richard II (BBC Hollow Crown, 2012).\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing\n\n(Recommended) David Nicholls, Much Ado About Nothing (BBC Shakespeare RE-told, 2005); AVAILABLE AT CGCC LIBRARY\n\nKenneth Branagh, Much Ado About Nothing (1993); AVAILABLE ONLINE or AT CGCC LIBRARY\n\nRobert Delamere Much Ado About Nothing (2011): AVAILABLE ON YOU TUBE\n\nMuch ado about nothing [videorecording] (2000) BBC TV: AVAILABLE AT CGCC LIBRARY\n\nSeveral film and stage versions are available on You Tube\n\nMeasure for Measure\n\n(Recommended) Desmond Davis, 1979 Measure for Measure AVAILABLE ON AMAZON OR ITUNES\n\nMeasure for Measure videorecording (2000) BBC TV: AVAILABLE AT CGCC LIBRARY\n\nSeveral film and stage versions are available on You Tube\n\nOthello\n\n(Recommended) Tim Blake Nelson, O (2001); AVAILABLE ONLINE\n\n(Recommended) Orson Welles, Othello (1951): AVAILABLE ONLINE\n\nOthello (2002) BBC TV; AVAILABLE AT CGCC LIBRARY\n\nStuart BurgeOthello (1965) AVAILABLE TO RESERVE AT CGCC LIBRARY\n\nSeveral film and stage versions are available on You Tube\n\nMacbeth\n\n(Recommended) Macbeth (BBC Shakespeare RE-told, 2005); AVAILABLE AT CGCC LIBRARY\n\nMacbeth PBS Great Performances (2010): AVAILABLE FOR RESERVE FROM CGCC LIBRARY\n\nMacbeth BBC TV (2002): AVAILABLE AT CGCC LIBRARY\n\nMacbeth A & E Home Video (2004): AVAILABLE AT CGCC LIBRARY\n\nMacbeth Anchor Bay Entertainment (2016) AVAILABLE AT CGCC LIBRARY\n\nSeveral film and stage versions are available on You Tube\n\nOther Texts:\n\nThe following plays are found in Adaptations of Shakespeare: An Anthology edited by Daniel Fischlin,(ISBN-13: 978-0415198943 and ISBN-10: 0415198941) which can be bought at the CGCC bookstore, on Amazon, or an online version can be purchased or rented by creating an account on Vitalsource (most economic option).\n\nDesdemona: A Play About a Handkerchief by Paula Vogel\n\nMeasure for Measure by Charles Marowitz\n\nUmabatha by Welcome Msomi\n\nOther Resources:\n\nThe University of Oxford Approaching Shakespeare Podcast by Professor Emma Smith\n\nOWL Purdue Writing Resource: https://owl.english.purdue.edu/\n\nOER resources – Open Educational Resources available from CGCC library:"
