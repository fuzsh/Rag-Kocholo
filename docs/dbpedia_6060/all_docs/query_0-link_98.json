        "text": "First-look photos released for 'Killers of the Flower Moon' and 'Stillwater'\n\nFilm fans are getting first-looks today at two major made-in-Oklahoma motion pictures.\n\nThe Osage News has the first look at Martin Scorsese's adaptation of \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" which is currently filming in Osage County. The photo depicts Native American actress Lily Gladstone (Blackfeet and Nez Perce) as Mollie Burkhart and Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who is also one of the film's producers, as her duplicitous husband, Ernest Burkhart.\n\nWith a screenplay by Oscar winner Eric Roth (\"Forrest Gump\"), the Apple Studios film is an adaptation of David Grann's 2017 New York Times best-seller and National Book Award finalist “Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI.\" The film will chronicle the murders of Osage Nation citizens in 1920s Oklahoma, after the oil boom made them rich. The brutal killings became known as the \"Reign of Terror\" and the center of a major investigation by the then-fledgling FBI.\n\nThe first-look photo features Gladstone garbed much like historic photos of Mollie Burkhart, complete with the Pendleton blanket around her shoulders, her choker and jewelry and her hair loosely pulled back.\n\nThe Osage News' Shannon Shaw Duty notes that the scene takes place in the Osage community of Grayhorse in 1919 and is set early in the couple's relationship, with Mollie inviting Ernest for a meal that includes the traditional Osage dish grape dumplings served on beloved red Spode dishes.\n\nThe details are an encouraging sign that Scorsese and his team are making good on their promises to handle the real-life story with care and attention to detail. Currently under production, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" is tentatively due out in 2022.\n\nEntertainment Weekly offers today a set of first-look photos at another Oklahoma-made movie: \"Stillwater,\" Academy Award-winning writer-director Tom McCarthy's new thriller. It stars Oscar winner Matt Damon as Bill Baker, an oil rig worker, or roughneck, from Stillwater, who travels to Marseille, France, to help exonerate his daughter, who has been arrested for a murder she says she didn't commit.\n\n\"Stillwater\" was filmed on location in Oklahoma and Marseille, which producer Jonathan King said in 2019 was \"dream of any filmmaker or producer when you're making a movie that's about real people in a real place is to make the movie there.\"\n\nMcCarthy tells EW the crime in question occurs when Bill's daughter, Allison (Oscar nominee Abigail Breslin), takes a year off from school at Oklahoma State University to study abroad in Marseille. While there, she meets a woman with whom she has a relationship, and the crime that occurs involves that woman.\n\n\"Matt and I started going (to Oklahoma) early on to get a taste of the place and the people and spending time with roughnecks, in particular,\" McCarthy tells EW. \"They really opened up their lives to us, and their worlds and their families. They were incredibly instrumental in helping us shape the story.\"\n\nFocus Features will release the Participant and DreamWorks Pictures project domestically in theaters on July 30.\n\n'Twister' celebrating 25th anniversary, with special screening planned\n\nTwenty-five years ago today, the blockbuster \"Twister\" debuted in theaters.\n\nAlthough a few scenes were lensed in Iowa, the stormy action vehicle was largely filmed in several small towns across Oklahoma, from Fairfax and Ponca City to Maysville and Pauls Valley. Wakita, where a large swath of filming took place, is now home to the Twister Museum, which is planning a 25th anniversary party on May 15.\n\nThe 1996 film stars Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton, Cary Elwes, Jami Gertz and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. It follows teams of rival storm chasers as tornadoes erupt across the Sooner State. The blockbuster wowed with its groundbreaking special effects, and it was nominated for Academy Awards for best visual effects and best sound.\n\nOklahoma City's Rodeo Cinema will offer a special 25th anniversary screening of \"Twister\" at 7 p.m. May 22. For tickets and information, go to https://www.rodeocinema.org.\n\nTower Theatre announces first shows without COVID-19 capacity limits\n\nThe Tower Theatre announced today plans for its first full-capacity shows since the March 2020 COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nWhen it hasn't been shut down due to the pandemic, the popular Uptown 23rd venue has been operating at limited capacity to allow for safe social distancing.\n\nAmericana star Shakey Graves' Aug. 12 return booking and comedian Kyle Kinane's Oct. 13 stand-up appearance at the Tower Theatre both are planned as full capacity shows. Tickets to both go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday at https://towertheatreokc.com.\n\nManaging partner Stephen Tyler said the hope is for all Tower Theatre shows starting in August to be full capacity, unless specifically stated for an event.\n\n\"We are on the road to full capacity shows again. We will play each show and date case by case and just know the configurations may be different so check the event descriptions! Get your vax on and come gather safely with us in August,\" Tyler wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"We have to accept that some tours may dictate restrictions,\" he added in a message to The Oklahoman. \"Kind of an unknown.\"\n\nStill, it's nice to see the Tower moving in a direction that is more like normal.\n\nFood Network star Alton Brown bringing live show back to OKC\n\nFood Network star Alton Brown will bring a new culinary variety show to Oklahoma City Nov. 7 for a stop at the Civic Center Music Hall.\n\nAudiences can expect more comedy, more music, more highly unusual cooking demos and \"more potentially dangerous sciencey stuff.\"\n\nTickets go on sale soon for the OKC stop on the \"Alton Brown Live: Beyond the Eats\" tour at https://www.okcbroadway.com/altonbrownlive.\n\nKara Luther-Chapman joins Guthrie's Pollard Theatre as executive director\n\nGUTHRIE – The board of directors of The Pollard Theatre Company has announced the appointment of Kara Luther-Chapman as executive director.\n\nLuther-Chapman is obtaining her MBA from Colorado State University with an emphasis in not-for-profit administration.

The exhibition features 10 prints and one painting from Scholder’s revolutionary “Indian” series, illustrating Scholder’s radical imagery of modern-day Indigenous life.\n\nThe exhibition will be on view on the museum's second floor through Nov. 7.\n\n“Through his paintings and prints, Scholder challenged the popular stereotypical depictions of Native Americans within the world of fine art,” said exhibition curator Catherine Shotick in a statement. “The stereotypical depictions, which often cast Indigenous subjects as uncivilized, tragic or a mere curiosity, helped justify the genocide, forced relocations and continued disenfranchisement of Indigenous peoples.”\n\nScholder was born in Minnesota in 1937, and by 1964 was teaching painting and art history at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico. An enrolled member of the Luiseño tribe, Scholder influenced a generation of Native American students during his time in New Mexico.\n\nAfter relocating to Santa Fe, Scholder said he saw one too many over-romanticized and generalized depictions of indigenous people “looking at the sunset” and decided someone should “paint the Indian from a different context.”\n\nIn 1970, he was invited to collaborate with the Tamarind Institute, where he created his first print portfolio, “Indians Forever.” He continued to work in lithography throughout his career, creating a distinct body of work through experimentations in line and color. He died in Scottsdale, Arizona in 2005.\n\nThe museum is currently operating with timed ticketing and is open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday 10 a.m. and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday.
