        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Isabela Ferrer and Alex Neustaedter have joined the cast of Wayfarer Studios and Sony Pictures’ film adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s bestselling novel It Ends With Us. They will play Young Lily and Young Atlas, respectively.\n\nThe film stars Blake Lively as Lily, Justin Baldoni as Ryle and Brandon Sklenar as Atlas, with Baldoni directing. Jenny Slate and Hasan Minhaj are also starring.\n\nSony Pictures is releasing the film theatrically on June 21, 2024, with Alex Saks producing for Saks Picture Company along with Jamey Heath on behalf of Wayfarer.\n\nExecutive producers are Steve Sarowitz, Andrew Calof and Baldoni on behalf of Wayfarer Studios, which is also co-financing, along with Lively, Hoover and Andrea Ajemian. Christy Hall has penned the current screenplay and is also producing.\n\nThe film follows Lily Bloom, who though coming from a complicated past has always known the life she wants. While living in Boston, she meets neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid and believes she may very well have found her soulmate. Soon, however, questions arise about their relationship, and to complicate matters her high school love interest, Atlas Corrigan, comes back into the picture, putting her relationship with Ryle in jeopardy.\n\nAfter becoming a “BookTok” cultural phenomenon with more than 3.8 billion views on her TikTok hashtag, Hoover is currently the bestselling novelist in the U.S. with more than 20 million books sold; she wrote five of the top 10 bestselling print books of any genre in 2022.\n\nPublished in 43 foreign languages, It Ends With Us was the top-selling print book of 2022 and has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for more than 90 weeks. In 2019, Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios optioned rights for the big screen and have been working with the author who is consulting on the film.\n\nNeustaedter has been a star on a consistent rise since he first came to the scene as a lead in Meg Ryan’s film Ithaca. His credits also include American Rust alongside Jeff Daniels and Maura Tierney, USA Network’s drama Colony with Josh Holloway, A-X-L opposite Becky G, American Woman alongside Sienna Miller; Walking Out alongside Bill Pullman and The Tribes of Palos Verdes starring Jennifer Garner. Most recently, he was seen in Netflix’s Things Heard and Seen alongside Amanda Seyfried and James Norton.\n\nFerrer is a recent graduate of Carnegie Mellon University, and the film marks her first for a major studio.\n\nNeustaedter is repped by WME, Luber Roklin Entertainment and Myman Greenspan Fox Rosenberg Mobasser Younger & Light LLP. Ferrer is represented by Paradigm, Brookside Artist Management and Jackie Eckhouse of Sloss Law."
