        "text": "Actor Ryan Reynolds appeared as Deadpool in Deadpool & Wolverine, which returned the MCU to its typical commercial success. The film also saw Reynolds’ wife, Blake Lively, play an alternate-reality version of Deadpool. However, the husband-wife duo have once again collaborated in the upcoming romantic drama film It Ends With Us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring a recent interview, Lively promoted the upcoming film, revealing how Reynolds helped write one of its steamiest scenes. As a result, fans who are still riding high on the multiverse shenanigans of Deadpool & Wolverine took to social media and joked about Reynolds’ involvement in the film. Here is what Lively and fans had to say about Reynolds’ role in It Ends With Us.\n\nBlake Lively Reveals Ryan Reynolds’ Contribution to It Ends With Us\n\nActress Blake Lively most recently appeared as Lady Deadpool in Deadpool & Wolverine, starring her husband Ryan Reynolds in the lead role. Lively will next be seen in It Ends With Us, an adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s best-selling novel of the same name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Lively revealed how her husband was also involved in the upcoming romantic-drama film. The actress revealed that Reynolds helped write the steamy rooftop scene between her and Justin Baldoni’s characters.\n\nHe works on everything I do. I work on everything he does. So his wins, his celebrations are mine and mine are his.\n\nLively made the above statement highlighting the importance of collaboration with her partner, which fans will get to witness once again in It Ends With Us.\n\nThe scene Lively mentioned is an iconic one from the source material as it sets up the dynamic between her character, Lily Bloom, and her love interest Ryle Kincaid. As a result, it is easy to understand why Lively would have sought Reynolds’ input on the pivotal scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans React to Ryan Reynolds’ Involvement in It Ends With Us\n\nFans quickly took note of Lively’s comments about Reynolds’ involvement in It End With Us. The film marks the third collaboration between the husband and wife in 2024, having previously worked together on IF and Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nHere is what fans of the power couple had to say about their upcoming collaboration on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nAs the tweets suggest, fans praised the couple for frequently collaborating and being a part of each other’s projects. However, some fans also referenced Reynolds’ fourth-wall-breaking humor as Deadpool, joking that he would face consequences for messing with the multiverse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, a fan also noted how the ill-fated Green Lantern movie features a rooftop scene between Lively and Reynolds. The couple first met during the filming of the superhero movie, making it almost poetic that Lively sought Reynolds’ help for the rooftop scene in the upcoming romantic-drama movie."
