        "text": "2016 romance novel by Colleen Hoover\n\nFor the film, see It Ends with Us (film).\n\nIt Ends with Us is a romance novel by Colleen Hoover, published by Atria Books on August 2, 2016. Based on the relationship between her mother and father, Hoover described it as \"the hardest book I've ever written.\" It explores themes of domestic violence and emotional abuse.\n\nAs of 2019, the novel had sold over one million copies worldwide and been translated into over twenty languages. In 2021, the novel experienced a resurgence in popularity through TikTok and topped sales lists for 2022 and 2023. Hoover wrote a sequel entitled It Starts with Us, which was published in October 2022.\n\nA film adaptation was released in August 2024, with a screenplay by Christy Hall. It was directed by Justin Baldoni, with Blake Lively, Baldoni, and Brandon Sklenar in leading roles.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\n23-year-old college graduate Lily Bloom moves to Boston with hopes of opening her own floral shop. She grew up in a broken family - her late father, Andrew, would physically abuse her mother, Jenny, leading Lily to resent him, as well as resenting her mother for staying with him. She has recently given a eulogy at Andrew’s funeral in her hometown of Plethora, Maine, during which she announced she would list five things she loved the most about him, then stood in silence for several seconds before walking off.\n\nReading through her old childhood diaries, Lily remembers her first love, Atlas Corrigan, who left to join the military but promised to return to her. She later meets Ryle Kincaid, a charming, ambitious 30-year-old neurosurgeon. They are mutually attracted, but do not pursue a relationship as Lily is seeking commitment while Ryle is only interested in a string of casual affairs. However, once Lily successfully starts her business, they continue to meet and eventually begin a relationship.\n\nOne night, Lily laughs when Ryle accidentally drops a casserole, and he angrily slaps her before frantically apologizing. Lily is reminded of her childhood; while horrified, she decides they are different from her parents and accepts his apologies, but warns him that she will leave if he hurts her again.\n\nWhile dining at a restaurant where Atlas works, Lily reconnects with him, making Ryle instantly jealous despite her insistence that Atlas is only a friend. Noticing Lily’s bruised eye and Ryle’s bandaged hand, Atlas suspects Ryle may be abusing her and secretly gives her his phone number.\n\nOne night, Lily and Ryle impulsively get married in Vegas, and have a stable marriage until he finds Atlas' number and pushes her down the stairs. He then confesses that he accidentally shot and killed his brother Emerson as a child, resulting in unresolved trauma that manifests in bouts of uncontrollable rage. Lily forgives him, but he later finds and reads her childhood diaries; believing she is having an affair with Atlas, he attempts to rape her, knocking her unconscious when she tries to defend herself.\n\nLily wakes up, escapes the house, and calls Atlas. He takes her to the hospital, where she discovers she is pregnant with Ryle's child, which she opts to keep a secret from him. She stays with Atlas for a few days while Ryle leaves for a fellowship in England, and eventually moves back home while Ryle is still out of the country. Atlas admits he still has feelings for Lily, but has suppressed them because of her marriage to Ryle. Finally understanding what her mother went through, Lily confides in her about the abuse. Jenny implores Lily to leave Ryle and not make the same mistakes she did.\n\nWhen Ryle returns, Lily forms a tentative truce with him and allows him to help her through the final few months of her pregnancy, but remains emotionally distant from him. Lily later gives birth to a daughter, whom she names after Ryle's late brother. After giving birth, Lily realizes she does not want her daughter to grow up witnessing Ryle's aggressive outbursts, and tells him she wants a divorce. He tearfully begs her to reconsider, but finally understands her perspective and agrees to separate after she asks him how he would react if their daughter told him she was being abused by her partner. Lily hopes she has finally ended the cycle of abuse in her family, telling her daughter, \"It ends with us.\"\n\nIn the epilogue, Lily, who is co-parenting with Ryle, finds Atlas and tells him that she is ready to restart her relationship with him.\n\nBackground and publication\n\n[edit]\n\nIt Ends with Us was published by Atria Books on August 2, 2016.[1] Based on the relationship between her mother and father,[2] Hoover described it as \"the hardest book I've ever written.\"[3]\n\nColoring book\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2023, Hoover announced the planned release of a coloring book based on It Ends With Us.
