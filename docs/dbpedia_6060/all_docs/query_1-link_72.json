        "text": "The King (2019, Netflix)\n\nBy: Kaitlyn Cruz, Elise Coby, Davis Speas\n\nThe King (2019), directed by David Michod, is a historical drama following the life of King Henry V of England during the 15th century. The character Hal, portrayed by Timothee Chalamet, began his journey as a drunk, rejecting his role as a royal while dismissing his father completely. He is then faced with the looming responsibility of taking the throne following the death of his father, the king, and his younger brother who was originally meant to take the role. As Chalamet’s character takes the throne as King Henry V, he is faced with many challenges such as the ineluctable war with France, duplicity expressed by his own men, and great losses. As this historical drama is supposedly based off the life of this one king, it appears that it leans closer to a retelling of William Shakespeare’s plays rather than actual history. The retelling is mostly based off the plays Henry IV, part I and part II, and Henry V. While these plays are historical and roughly based off the actual events and encounters of the time, the retelling is not entirely accurate, and neither is The King. With Michod’s retelling, the audience is presented with an abundance of both historical accuracies and inaccuracies, as well as fine Hollywood entertainment.\n\nThe King Poster (2019)[1]\n\nAccuracies\n\nAs one could ask about any historical film, how accurate is the movie based on real events? The King itself is an adaptation of Shakespeare’s set of historical plays known as The Henriad, which portrayed the real British monarchs of the 15th century.[2] While a few changes had to be made to the movie to consolidate a rather immense and tumultuous period of time into two and a half hours, most of the characters and plot in the film did in fact take place or were real. Quite noticeably, King Henry’s (Timothée Chalamet’s) haircut which appeared as a short-cropped bowl cut with shaved sides was, in fact, a popular haircut amongst men who were paying homage to monks and priests.[3] King Henry was also one of the first English kings to appear with this specific style.\n\nPerhaps one of the most notable scenes in The King was the battle of Agincourt. As portrayed in the film, the English army arrived in France and pursued a successful attack on a town known as “Harfleur.” Following the scene, soldiers end up dying of a disease which caused King Henry V’s army to become weak and outnumbered by the French army. Surprisingly, the English did win the battle as a direct result of King Henry’s organized leadership as opposed to the scattered leadership from the French side.[4] As stated by TIME magazine, The U.K.’s National Archives show that, as portrayed in The King, the muddied battlegrounds from inclement weather the day before the battle led to the vulnerability of the French soldiers as they would fall in the mud, thus making them susceptible to English attack.[5]\n\nA notable character in The King known as “Falstaff,” played by Joel Edgerton, is also an accuracy taken from Shakespeare’s plays.[6] He was mostly known as a character used for comedic relief. However, in the film, Falstaff is portrayed as a companion with an emotional relationship with King Henry as an advisor. Edgerton’s character displayed great knowledge and sacrifice which ultimately led the English to victory as portrayed in his emotional death scene in which Falstaff sacrifices himself. Another accurately portrayed character in the film can be observed through France’s Lady Catherine played by Lily-Rose Depp. In England with Henry V, Lady Catherine pretends that she doesn’t speak English when he commands her to speak it in place of French, but then speaks it fluently. This scene alludes to the fact that in the 1400’s, Henry V was the first English king to write and read English well enough to incorporate it into the customs of the court.[7]\n\nThe portrayal of religion is also a parallel accuracy. Chalamet’s character, Hal, can be seen praying with rosary beads. Correspondingly, he can be seen disapproving the idea of the English fighting France and wanting to go to Jerusalem. Parallel to the movie, on Henry V’s deathbed, he stated an intention to take the Hundred Years’ War to Jerusalem.[8]\n\nAnother interesting parallel to history and film is the way Hal/ Henry V handled the execution of prisoners. His ultimate decision was to execute all of his prisoners. As a result, Falstaff insists that Hal shouldn’t kill the French prisoners because “he isn’t that kind of man” and he steps back. Later, once Falstaff dies, Henry orders his men to kill the prisoners anyway. In reality, after the actual Battle of Agincourt, Henry V allowed high-ranking prisoners to live.[9] Perhaps one of the most notable and well-played accuracies portrayed in the movie was the plot in which viewers were led to believe that Hal never anticipated becoming king nor acted like one. His character maintained the reputation of an out and about partier that did not have the trust of his father. The film even portrays his new wife mocking him and questioning his claim to England and France. Parallel to reality, Henry V was also known for his social outings as well as his questionable and aggressive military ambitions.[10]\n\n[11]\n\nHenry V\n\nInaccuracies\n\nWith the production of The King, the story line was able to explore many historical accuracies. However, with elements such as creative liberties and dramatic additions, the story line also faltered from its natural telling. A major aspect of Timothee Chalamet’s portrayal of Henry V was his pacifist manner and reluctance to bring war upon the French. This, however, is entirely not true. According to most accounts of King Henry V, he was very adamant in regards to the attack against the French, which can be observed through the analysis of his reign as it is written, “He was a shrewd military tactician and a skilled soldier, but was widely known for his linguistic brevity. He allegedly had only two answers to questions concerning military strategy: ‘It shall be done,’ or ‘It is impossible.’”[12] It is more likely that when creating the image of Henry V in The King, Michod took inspiration from Henry V’s successor, Henry VI. Henry VI was more known as a pacifist and a Godly man.[13] It can be seen to what extent of his image became portrayed as holy when it is written “… the first fifty years after his death saw Henry VI revered as a royal saint in popular esteem who rivalled St Thomas Becket in the fame of his cures…” [14] Henry V was even on the verge of claiming the French throne before his demise in 1422 during his third campaign to France, further proving the militaristic nature of Henry V, as well as, the prominent influence of war during his reign.[15]\n\nAlthough Henry V was extremely militaristic and ready to fight for England on any account, he was still very much a religious man and even brought such influence into his dealings with war. This can be observed as a soldier recounts the day of one of the most influential battles of Henry V’s reign, the Battle of Agincourt, as he writes\n\nTo him the king said, ‘You are talking foolishly, because by the God of heaven, on whose grace I have depended, and in whom I have the firm hope of victory, I would not want to have even one more man than I have, even if I could. For these are the people of God I have here, and it is an honour for me to have them at this time. Or do you not believe,’ he said, ‘that his omnipotence, with these His humble few, can overcome the pride of the French that opposes him, who boast of their great number and strength?’, as if he were saying, He can if He wants to.[16]\n\nIn saying this, Henry V was able to bring the influence of God and his holy beliefs onto the battlefield in support of his war in order to act as a morale builder and provide protection for his men. He was expressing his divine right.\n\nA much less dramatic inaccuracy of The King would be the character John Falstaff. As mentioned in the section above, Falstaff’s character did exist but in rather different ways than that which is presented in The King. The character in Shakespeare appeared as a form of comedic relief; the character in The King appeared as an honorable father figure guiding Henry V in his endeavors; the character in true telling was considered a coward of the Hundred Year War, unworthy of being described in history.\n\nAnother inaccuracy portrayed in The King would be the relationship between Henry V and Catherine of Valois. In the film, it is made apparent the two were brought together in matrimony shortly after the victory at the Battle of Agincourt. They meet and are instantly shown as guiding one another in their newfound relationship, which acted as a form of a treaty and an act of “peace” between the two nations. Although this is how their relationship is portrayed in the film, it is not accurate to their timeline nor their actual relationship. The Battle of Agincourt occurred in October 1415.[17] According to records, it was not until 1419 that the couple was even introduced to one another, much less engaged to be married.[18] It was not until the following year that they were married.[19] After a year, their first son was born while Henry V was away during his third expedition to France,[20] obviously not being an active member of the relationship, unlike how it was portrayed in the film. Henry V then died in the following year, still away from home as well as his wife and child.[21] It is apparent that the real relationship and the relationship portrayed were of different caliber and substance. The director most likely chose this time jump and embellishment regarding their relationship in order to create a more fluid timeline as well as aid to the drama at hand. By reducing the time endured and quickly strengthening a relationship before it is given a foundation, it allows the story to be told in a creative and detailed manner. The rushed relationship between the two characters allowed for a major plot line of deceit and betrayal to be revealed before the film’s end, further establishing a theme of selected trust and betrayal within one’s direct circle. In making this creative decision, the director may create an inaccurate timeline, but also, is able to create a memorable piece of art. As many of these details are molded, thrown out, and embellished to create a dramatic narrative, the true history of it all is still found deep within.\n\n[22]\n\nTimothee Chalamet as Henry V beside Henry V\n\nHollywood:\n\nFor an everyday person with an average background knowledge of history or is not necessarily interested in historical study The King was a pretty good movie in our opinion. The movie is not very predictable either which makes it a good “on the edge of your seat” kind of movie.\n\nFor more on the making of the movie, check out the following interviews with cast and crew:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHKJoXGsOxE[23]\n\nUpon deep examination in regard to both Historical Accuracies and Hollywood Entertainment, the film The King must be given the following ratings:\n\n3/5 Stars for Historical Accuracies\n\n4/5 Stars for Hollywood Entertainment\n\nBibliography:\n\nAnonymous, Henry V, Painting (England, King, 16th century)\n\nCurry, Anne. 2000.
