        "text": "It Ends With Us might have inherited some unescapable aspects of its source material, but some smart changes and a luminous Blake Lively make up for part of it.\n\nAs an adaptation of Colleen Hoover's bestselling and much-discussed novel, there's no doubt this is one of the most anticipated movies of the year. That honour, though, comes with high expectations and close scrutiny, and not only from fans.\n\nAs a movie handling as sensitive a topic as domestic violence while being packaged as a soppy romance, it was always meant to ignite a conversation. And that's a good thing.\n\nIt Ends With Us is a pretty satisfying adaptation that will please fans, although it is far from flawless.\n\nThe movie follows Lily Bloom (Lively) as she makes her dreams come true by opening her own flower shop in Boston.\n\nAround that time, Lily also meets by chance a handsome neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid (Justin Baldoni, who also directs the film), but they part ways after a steamy encounter on a deserted rooftop due to their opposite views on relationships â€” he just wants a one-night stand, but she's the kind of woman you \"take home to meet your mama\".\n\nWhen the pair reconnect after realising Ryle's sister Alyssa (Jenny Slate) has been working as Lily's only employee for a while, their paths become inevitably intertwined. However, as feelings grow and they eventually get married, another side of Ryle surfaces.\n\nRelated: The best and most anticipated movies of 2024\n\nDespite how she always vowed never to follow in her mother's footsteps and never tolerate abuse from a partner, Lily sees herself trapped in a pattern until things become too terrifying to ignore.\n\nAt the same time, Lily is reunited with her first love, Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar), who owns a successful restaurant in Boston. He becomes an important emotional support through the toughest moment of her life.\n\nThe first and most important challenge this adaptation faced was to successfully (and tastefully) marry the story's mainstream melodrama vibes and the profoundly delicate topic at its core.\n\nAfter all, It Ends With Us is not a romantic fairytale, but a story about domestic abuse.\n\nMistaking one for the other can be dangerous, but also enlightening â€” to see a cute love story turn into a nightmare in a matter of seconds is like throwing a necessary bucket of ice water on those trying to romanticise Ryle's evident red flags.\n\nUnique to the adaptation, Baldoni plays with those same expectations from Lily's perspective. She claims at the beginning she can be an \"unreliable narrator\", and the movie takes advantage of that fact by exploring how love (and gaslighting) can bring a victim to forget and forgive, even to blame themselves.\n\nAny criticism of Lily's choices faces ignoring Hoover's best contribution to her readers (and now viewers), namely an understanding that throwing judgement at victims of abuse is wrong and ignorant. This message feels a bit lost in the movie (probably due to trimming down Lily's mother's own experience and her parallels with her daughter), but it still comes through.\n\nA more warranted criticism can (and should) be expressed about Ryle, a character whose controversial redemption arc is thankfully less present in the movie than in the book.\n\nAs protagonist and producer, Blake Lively is at the heart of this adaptation, successfully pulling off insanely extravagant outfits and overall offering a notable performance as Lily.\n\nWhile still enjoying the massive box-office run of Deadpool & Wolverine (where she played Lady Deadpool) alongside husband Ryan Reynolds, Lively is hoping for a second big hitter through emotional catharsis, flower metaphors and melancholic pop tunes from Taylor Swift's 'My Tears Ricochet' to Birdy's 'Skinny Love'.\n\nAlongside her, Baldoni plays the lethally attractive and dangerously tormented man to perfection, while Sklenar does what he can despite Atlas' background being mostly removed from the movie.\n\nAlas, not all changes made for this adaptation make sense (why do we never see Lily's apartment? What happened to her friends?) while others mark a positive new direction (the age difference, most notably), but they all end up working just fine for the screen.\n\nWith this one, it's all about managing expectations, especially for those who haven't read the book.\n\nThis is not an in-depth study of domestic violence (although bringing the conversation into the mainstream, in whatever form, holds value), but more like an emotionally cathartic melodrama in the vein of recently successful romance BookTok sensations and Nicholas Sparks' legacy.\n\nSome viewers might wish It Ends With Us was more than it is, but ultimately the movie can't escape what was on the page. For better or worse.\n\nIt Ends With Us is released in cinemas on August 9."
