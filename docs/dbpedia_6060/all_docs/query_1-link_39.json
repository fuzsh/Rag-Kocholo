        "text": "Lily Collins has packed a lot of life in her 30 years on this earth. She's excelled at modeling, singing, writing, and, of course, acting. The daughter of rock royalty Phil Collins, the British-American actress landed her first screen role at age 2, in the BBC series Growing Pains, and then went on to study broadcast journalism at the University of Southern California, write for Seventeen magazine, Teen Vogue, and The Los Angeles Times, and then foster a successful film career that's seen her in films such as Mirror Mirror and The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.\n\nThese days, Collins is just as busy, either staying alive — in Netflix's Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile, about serial killer, Ted Bundy — or dying, as the tragically lost Fantine in the PBS miniseries Les Misérables, also starring David Oyelowo. Further, this summer Collins will head to Europe to film the Paramount network dramedy series Emily In Paris, from Sex and the City producer Darren Star, which she will co-produce as well.\n\nI love getting to learn more things about myself with the characters that I play\n\nWhen she's not on screen, Collins still maintains her passion for writing, having published a memoir of essays, Unfiltered: No Shame, No Regrets, Just Me, about the myriad of things young women struggle with — boys, body image, family — in the modern age.\n\n\"One of my favorite subjects in school was English and literature,\" says Collins, \"I also love journalism. For me, writing is just a way I get to explore that while still acting. I never wanted to fully close the door on journalism, even though I'm more following the path of acting now. I really enjoy it.\"\n\nShondaland.com caught up with Collins to talk about the joy of writing, how she juggles her many talents, and those false teeth in Les Mis.\n\nSUSAN HORNIK: In addition to your many projects, you're also starring in Tokien [premiering May 10], the film about J.R.R. Tolkien, the author of The Lord of the Rings. It certainly seems like you have a lot on your plate!\n\nLILY COLLINS: Yes, it's been a little bit of a crazy time right now! I filmed three things back-to-back last year and now they are all seemingly coming out back-to-back!\n\nSH: What was it like to work with Zac Efron, who plays Ted Bundy in Extremely Wicked?\n\nLC: It was wonderful! I think this is a really exciting role for Zach, people get to see a side of him that he hasn't shown in other roles and I couldn’t be prouder to have witnessed him do that. I think we had a lot of fun as well. We were shooting up in Kentucky, the whole cast and crew bonded together, in freezing temperatures. It was a real team effort, that film.\n\nSH: You've also been starring in the PBS adaptation of Les Misérables, which has its finale on May 19th. How are you feeling now that she series is coming to a close?\n\nLC: Les Misérables was really great because it was a six-part miniseries, so it felt like a mini movie each time we filmed. Even though we didn't have a huge budget, the production value was just incredible. I liked that you got to really live and breathe the character for longer than what a movie would allow.\n\nSH: Your path as a creative could have taken you virtually anywhere you wanted to go. What drew you into the world of acting?\n\nLC: My love of acting just came from when I was younger. My mom and dad would read books to me before bed, as a lot of parents do, and I would just kind of disappear in this dream world in my head of what the movie would look like. And my dream became to take people with me on that journey and become those people.\n\nNow, I love getting to learn more things about myself with the characters that I play, whether that's a fairy tale princess, a literary heroine, someone that feels closer to home to me, or someone that's completely foreign.\n\nSH: How do you choose the characters you portray?\n\nLC: I choose characters that I think are going to teach me a lot about myself and that will challenge me. Les Misérables, for example, was definitely a challenge. It's kind of the most raw I've ever had to be in the moment, especially when Fantine's demise starts. Physically and emotionally, it was the most grueling work that I've ever done. So that was fearful in and of itself. But I thrive off of fear, and I think that fear teaches me something.\n\nI thrive off of fear. I think that fear teaches me something.\n\nSH: In a role like Fantine, how do you shut that off and return to yourself when filming is over?\n\nLC: Luckily, I've not yet had the problem of taking things home with me. I like the idea of entering into that work space, becoming that character and that person, and then leaving that behind at the end of the day. It helps me compartmentalize more.\n\nThat being said, I also just use my surroundings to help better the development of the character. So when we started Les Mis, it was in the dead of winter. There's a scene where I’m being dragged through the streets, and it was minus 13; it was snowing and in the dead of night.\n\nI have no hair, there was no warmth, there's nothing. So I couldn't necessarily not take some of that home, because it was just freezing where we were, and it was quite a depressing part of the story. But I do everything I can just to go back to me, whether that’s literally FaceTiming friends or something like that. I crave that separation. I think it helps me stay more sane.\n\nLily Collins as Fantine in PBS’ Les Misérables\n\nSH: Was Les Mis the first time you've ever died on film?\n\nLC: It is and I did it day two! It was weird. It was also weird to watch. I didn't know originally that was going to happen. I'm actually glad though, because we got to start off at the end of her life, making that the worst it could be. And then I knew the polarity to which I wanted to take the happier times. So I wanted that contrast to be really stark.\n\nI studied up on this: She dies of consumption and choking on blood — she's shivering, hot and cold, having hot flushes, seizure-ing a little bit, she can't speak very well, labored breathing, etc. And I had to talk at the same time, and she's weak. These are all these symptoms I looked up and thought, \"Oh my god, I’ll just do them all then!\"\n\nI was with [co-star] Dominic [West] and he's like, \"Oh where did the twitching come from — I like that!\"\n\nSH: Did you take photos of yourself looking the way you did while filming the series?\n\nLC: Yeah, I sent them in real time to my mom and she replied, \"No mother wants to see these images! Why are you sending these to me?!\" And I’m like, \"It’s because I'm fine!\"\n\nThese make-up and hair teams were beyond amazing. I actually really loved going down that road with the hair and makeup, because I felt extremely unrecognizable to myself. I loved that as an actor, when you feel like you can perform past what you thought you were capable of. Because I really didn't see myself, which was great. Scary, but great.\n\nSH: How did they do your teeth?\n\nLC: Oh, the teeth! We did it two different ways. We first started out with a retainer of sorts that had two green front teeth. This to me was more distracting than anything. It was supposed to be green‑screened out, but that's a very expensive process, so they ended up just blacking them out.\n\nAnd then in all of the scenes on the street when I'm begging for my life, I said, \"I don't want to blacken my teeth, because what if we're in the middle of a great take and they don't look as black or something?\"\n\nSo we blacked out those and then in post (production) they fuzzed them a little bit. But I had to keep thinking, \"If you don't have your two front teeth, you're going to have a lisp. And you have a lisp with an accent. And if you have a lisp with an accent choking on blood and not being able to breath...\" But it was like, \"Be calm. Don't think about all those things.\" At least it was a retainer, so it couldn't fall out or something. That was fun. No teeth, no hair!\n\nSH: Why do you think audiences still love this story?\n\nLC: I feel that it's something that no matter what generation you are, there's something about it that you can connect to. With my character, Fantine, no, I am not a mother yet. And, no, there are certain situations that she has gone through that I can’t relate to. But for young women out there, I think most of us know what ghosting is, you know, having a guy just disappear on you. That's not a modern phenomenon.\n\nSo there were certain things about Fantine that I thought were very modern, but, also, there were things that were deeply nostalgic for me of a time gone by that was romanticized — it just felt so real. Even when I watched the first two episodes, I thought there was something about it that was very raw in comparison to any other adaptation.\n\nSH: Let's talk about your writing.\n\nLC: I went to USC. I'm on an extended leave of absence, so I have not graduated yet. But I was there for broadcast journalism and then I changed to communications. I would love to go back, but it would definitely be more for something maybe like English literature or art history.\n\nWriting about it was just a very therapeutic way for me to be introspective about my journey.\n\nSH: You're also a published author, what was the experience like writing your book?\n\nLC: Extremely therapeutic. I learned so much about myself in that process. I think it allowed me to come to terms with a lot and to dig deeper into many things that help me now with character work. So I think it really allowed me to let go of a lot as Lily, but also gain a lot of knowledge for every character that I play from there on out. It was really, really cool.\n\nSH: What do you hope people will take away from reading your own experiences of addiction and eating disorders?\n\nLC: Well, I think everyone has their own journey and their own process. Writing about it was just a very therapeutic way for me to be introspective about my journey, and to know how it didn't only affect just me, but my peripheral friends and family. So I better understood the domino effect.\n\nSH: What did your parents think of it?\n\nLC: Both of my parents were really proud of me for writing it, for being brave to go do that.\n\nSH: What advice would you give young women who are dealing with similar challenges?\n\nLC: I feel like I'm not one to give advice. It's hard, because I'm someone that just knows my experience. People have come up to me and asked, but I've said I'm really not one to give advice.\n\nSH: Your book ends on a positive note, which was inspiring to readers.\n\nLC: Thank you. You've always got to show the light."
