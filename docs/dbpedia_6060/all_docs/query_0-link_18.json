        "text": "Ryan Reynolds will have some serious competition at the box office this weekend. Thanks to his wifey-poo, Blake Lively. Her new film “It Ends with Us” is about to open up. Deco caught up with Blake and the cast to talk about the emotional roller coaster the audience is sure to experience while watching this film.\n\nJenny Slate (as Allysa): “Hey, Lily want to do the honors?”\n\nBlake Lively (as Lily Bloom): “No, you go ahead, I just want to take it in from here.”\n\nThere is a lot to take in from the new romantic drama “It Ends with Us”\n\nJustin Baldoni (as Ryle Kincaid): “The first official customer?”\n\nBlake Lively (as Lily Bloom): “Well, you have to buy something to be considered a customer. Right now you’re just loitering.”\n\nBlake Lively stars in the film as Lily Bloom. A flower shop owner– who is quickly swept off her feet by a charming neurosurgeon,\n\nJustin Baldoni (as Ryle Kincaid): “I want to see you again.”\n\nBlake Lively (as Lily Bloom): “Now you see me.”\n\nJustin Baldoni (as Ryle Kincaid): “You know what I mean”\n\nBut the romance doesn’t last too long.\n\nBlake Lively (as Lily Bloom): “But 15 seconds. That’s all it takes?”\n\nThe quiet truth about domestic violence takes center stage in the film and it’s a story Blake says she wanted to get right.\n\nBlake Lively: “It’s hard to tackle this subject in a commercial way because if you infuse too much levity or joy, its undermining the trauma and the pain. But if it’s only trauma and pain, it feels like that’s the only facet of the experience.”\n\nThe drama is based on Colleens Hoover’s book by the same name and Blake told us that was enough for her to sign on.\n\nBlake Lively: “This book resonated with so many people and not only the story that Colleen told but how she told it.”\n\nAlso, mama’s has mouths to feed.\n\nBlake Lively: “I have four kids. If I’m going to work, I want to do work that people actually see.”\n\nFor actress Isabela Ferrer, who plays young Lily, this role was more personal.\n\nIsabela Ferrer: “I feel like something that resonated with me a lot, is when you’re dealing with something in the home and then have to go out outside and carry that with you, but to keep it private, it’s such a huge burden to carry and I feel like Lily does it in such a strong way.”\n\nAnother strong character? Lily’s first love interest is Young Atlas. Played by Alex Neustadt.\n\nAlex Neustadt: “I really connected with Atlas and his willingness to fight for what he believes in and his self-reliance you know. He really had his back against the wall and had no other place to turn and luckily for him, he meets Lily”\n\nDespite the hardship of the movie. The cast wants movie-goers to leave feeling seen.\n\nBlake Lively: “You want to make people feel good you know. Even if it’s about a lot of pain and trauma.”\n\nBlake Lively (as Lily Bloom): “If one day you had a daughter, what you say to her?”\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved.
