When you join Kappa Delta, you join a network of friendship, leadership, confidence and action.\n\nEstablished at F&M\n\nMay 3, 2008\n\nChapter Nickname\n\nKD, “Kaydee”\n\nChapter Type\n\nSorority\n\nCouncil\n\nNational Panhellenic Association\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nConfidence Coalition:\n\nPrevent Child Abuse America\n\nVia kappadelta.org: Founded by KD sister Donna J Stone, Prevent Child Abuse America has been a national philanthropy, supported by thousands of KD sisters, for over 41 years.

A dedication to philanthropy guides our members to spend time in the service of those who need it most. Our international organization’s commitment to Ronald McDonald House Charities has led to the donation of over $15,000,000 over the course of our partnership. More than 350 Ronald McDonald Houses in 64 countries help keep families with seriously ill or injured children together when they need it most by offering them a comfortable, temporary residence in proximity to a medical facility.\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the fall of 1989, the foundation of Sigma Lambda Gamma National Sorority, Inc. began when a group of collegiate women recognized the need to form an organization that provided empowerment to women of all cultural backgrounds at the University of Iowa. The humble beginning of Sigma Lambda Gamma was built at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa. Under the guidance of University of Iowa staff, Esther Materón-Arum, and Mary Peterson, the vision came to fruition on April 9th, 1990, when the University of Iowa Panhellenic Council officially recognized the organization as a sorority.\n\nThrough the continued commitment and leadership of the founding mothers, Gloria Cuevas, Julieta Maria Miller-Calderon, Maria Ester Pineda, Danell Marie Riojas-Carbajal, and Guadalupe (Lupita) Temiquel–McMillian, the operation of Sigma Lambda Gamma National Sorority, Inc. began to thrive nationally.\n\nSigma Lambda Gamma flourished on over 130 college campuses nationwide and continues to provide an avenue for educational excellence to individuals of diverse backgrounds. Our members recognize the need for togetherness and support one another in their varying cultures, identities, and backgrounds. On campus, we aim to provide a safe place for our collegiate members to learn, grow, and accomplish their dreams. Our organization continues to support our alumni after college through Alumni Associations, task forces, and volunteer opportunities.\n\nSigma Lambda Gamma National Sorority, Inc. is a sisterhood of empowered members who have chosen this affiliation as a means to achieve personal development in their lives and make a difference in our global community. Through our network of thousands of sorority members, our organization continues to be a pioneer in the fraternal world through the development of innovative programming initiatives and being an advocate for social change.\n\nToday, Sigma Lambda Gamma National Sorority, Inc. has evolved into a multicultural sorority that continues to honor that we were originally founded to create a safe space for Latina women on a predominately white campus in the midwest.\n\nMany of our customs and traditions continue to come from our Latina roots. Since its founding, our scope and appeal as a vibrantly diverse sorority committed to empowering all of our members have become a central element of the organization.\n\nMembership into Sigma Lambda Gamma National Sorority, Inc. is open to all individuals who identify as women or as non-binary, maintain exceptional morals & ethics, with a demonstrated commitment to academic excellence, and who are pursuing or have completed courses leading to a degree at an accredited college or university.\n\nEstablished at F&M\n\nMarch 30, 2019, achieved chapter status April 7, 2021\n\nChapter Nickname\n\nSLG\n\nChapter Type\n\nSorority\n\nCouncil\n\nF&M All Greek Council\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nThe Sigma Lambda Gamma Education Foundation and Breast Cancer Awareness\n\nThe Sigma Lambda Gamma Education Foundation serves as the philanthropic entity for Sigma Lambda Gamma.

These organizations were the Chi Phi Society, founded at the College of New Jersey (Princeton); the Chi Phi Fraternity, established at the University of North Carolina; and the Secret Order of Chi Phi, founded at Hobart College. In the fall of 1854, Mayer organized a second chapter of the Chi Phi Society at Franklin and Marshall College. Joseph Henry Dubbs, later a distinguished professor of history at his alma mater, was the first initiate of the Zeta chapter. Hence the name “Dubbsheim” is above the Chi Phi house on the campus today.\n\nEstablished at F&M\n\nEst.

Max Gruver died due to alcohol hazing in his fraternity on Sept. 14, 2017. Chi Phi at F&M will host this event on March 23rd and all proceeds will go to the cause.\n\nDunleavy-Callahan 5k\n\nThis 5k run goes to support cancer research.
