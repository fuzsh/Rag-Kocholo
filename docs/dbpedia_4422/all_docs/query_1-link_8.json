The eleven chapters are comprised of young women who share common goals and ideals and are united by a special friendship. Each member contributes a unique quality to their chapter and the Greek community. Greek organizations are like many families, providing support to one another through life's ups and downs. Through a variety of activities, Greek members have the opportunity to meet and interact with members in other Greek and student organizations. These bonds of sisterhood and are what make college life more meaningful and enjoyable. Throughout their college careers and for the rest of their lives, the bonds, trust, and loyalty can only grow richer and more meaningful."
