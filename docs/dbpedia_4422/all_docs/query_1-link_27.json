        "text": "Home » Res Gestae » Beta Pi at the University of Arkansas\n\nBy lkoelle on January 4, 2012. No Comments\n\nThe Beta Pi Chapter of Eta Sigma Phi had\n\na successful and fun year. The first activity\n\nwas a Cena Deorum on October 30, 2010.\n\nMembers dressed as gods, goddesses, or any\n\nother mythological character and gathered\n\nfor food and group readings of plays. At this\n\nevent and throughout the year, the chapter\n\nsold Clytemnestra T-shirts as a fundraiser.\n\nAfter this event, Eta Sigma Phi sponsored\n\na joint talk by the faculty of Classical\n\nStudies at the University of Arkansas.\n\nDrs. Alexandra Pappas, Dave Fredrick,\n\nand Daniel Levine each spoke about their\n\nrespective current research projects. The\n\nevent had a great turnout and was followed\n\nby pizza at Tim’s.\n\nOn December 11, Eta Sigma Phi had a\n\nSaturnalia, where we inducted new members.\n\nAt the Saturnalia, we had translation\n\ngames, gifts, and a potluck.\n\nOver spring break, Dr. Levine took a\n\nfew students to the national convention in\n\nAustin, Texas. Shortly after, Eta Sigma Phi\n\nhosted a speaker, Joe Goodkin. Mr. Goodkin\n\nsang a version of Homer’s Odyssey that\n\nhe set to music. He accompanied himself\n\non the guitar and sang for thirty minutes.\n\nThe event took place in the University of\n\nArkansas’ Greek Theatre. Following the\n\nevent, Eta Sigma Phi hosted a banquet in\n\nCarnall Hall. The entire event was open to\n\nthe public and yielded a great turnout. It\n\nwas a year of fun and classical learning for\n\nthe Beta Pi chapter!"
