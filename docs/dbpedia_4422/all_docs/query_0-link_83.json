        "text": "The Phi Beta Kappa Society is the oldest and most widely recognized national academic honor society in the United States. Founded in 1776 at the College of William and Mary in Virginia, the Society's aim is to encourage academic excellence in the broad range of the liberal arts. Membership is restricted to students who complete most of their course work in the liberal studies curriculum; typically those are students who pursue BA or BS degrees in the College of Arts and Sciences. Fairfield's chapter, Zeta of Connecticut, was established in 1994. Each spring it inducts new members from among the most academically talented students. Election to this chapter is based on academic standing (top 10 percent of the class), evidence of broad intellectual curiosity, independent work and thought, and other intellectual accomplishments; it is limited to seniors and a highly select group of juniors.\n\nStudents are chosen on the basis of their broad cultural interests, scholarly achievement, and good character. All have demonstrated outstanding work in the liberal arts.\n\nPhi Beta Kappa aims to promote learning, morality, and collegiality. For over two hundred years Phi Beta Kappa has encouraged scholarship and a life-long commitment to the liberal arts. Among the members of Phi Beta Kappa have been seventeen United States presidents, dozens of Senators, and men and women in a broad range of professional fields. When the Zeta Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was chartered at Fairfield University, Fairfield joined an elect company of 262 colleges and universities. Nationwide, only one percent of college seniors are invited to join Phi Beta Kappa annually.\n\nExecutive officers of Phi Beta Kappa, Zeta of Connecticut chapter: (Below left to right) Julie Mughal, MA (president), Betsy A.

The Fairfield chapter was reactivated in 1981 and includes outstanding undergraduate and graduate students who are encouraged to promote service to the University and provide greater understanding of the Jesuit ideals of education within the University community.\n\nUndergraduate students must have a scholastic rank in the top 15 percent of their class, must have demonstrated a proven concern for others through involvement in extracurricular activities and service to the University, and must have manifested a true concern and commitment to the values and goals of Jesuit education. All sophomores and juniors with a high enough grade point average are invited to apply. Only five percent of a class can join and final decisions on membership are made by present undergraduate members of ASN.\n\nGraduate students must have a scholastic rank in the top 15 percent of their college, school, program, or department and must have distinguished themselves in displaying qualities of loyalty, service, and commitment to Jesuit educational ideals. Graduate student applicants must have completed one-half of the credit requirements for their degree at the time of their application.\n\nSelection of new members takes place during February and the induction of new members is held in October.\n\nRev. John Mulreany, S.J.\n\nSuperior\n\nFairfield Jesuit Community\n\nThe main function of Alpha Epsilon Delta is to recognize publicly outstanding scholastic achievement among pre-health students. Each campus chapter has the responsibility of making a significant contribution to the extracurricular educational experience of the members and all other pre-health students on campus, as well as engaging in service to the community. Candidates for membership should have demonstrated some sense of responsibility and willingness to serve the pre-health science needs of all such students, and contribute to worthwhile student activities; they should possess those qualities which the members are looking for in their personal health care providers and which committees on admission are seeking in the candidates that they accept for health professions programs. Fairfield University's chapter of Alpha Epsilon Delta, Alpha of Connecticut, was established at Fairfield in 1962. It inducts about 15 members each year.\n\nAlpha Mu Gamma, the National Foreign Language Honorary Society, was founded in 1931 with the purposes of recognizing students' achievement in the field of foreign language study; stimulating a desire for linguistic achievement; encouraging a continuing interest in the study of foreign languages, literature and civilizations; and fostering sympathetic understanding of other peoples and international friendship. Alpha Mu Gamma is the official sponsor of National Foreign Language Week. More than 350 charters have been granted to chapters in the United States and Puerto Rico. Chapters are found both in state and private universities and in public and private colleges.\n\nThe Eta Pi Chapter at Fairfield University was established by Fr. Victor Leeber in 1970 and currently it is the largest and most active group in the society, nationwide. Our chapter has hosted two successful national conventions (2001 and 2009) and student members have also attended conventions and given presentations at other universities. Since 2008 several Fairfield University AMG members have been among the recipients of the three major national scholarships that Alpha Mu Gamma awards annually.\n\nFor further information, please visit the Fairfield University Chapter of Alpha Mu Gamma website.\n\nFairfield University hosts a chapter of Omicron Delta Epsilon, the international honor society for economists. Its purpose is to recognize outstanding achievement in the study of economics. Working with the Economics Club, ODE also supports on-campus activities that engage the community in conversations about important economic topics and trends, both in the academy and in the national and global marketplace. ODE membership is open to any student who is an economics major or minor, who has completed 12 credits in economics with a B average, and who has a B average overall. Students in ODE receive a certificate of membership, lifetime membership in the organization, and a one-year subscription to society's publication, The American Economist. Fairfield's economics department also awards honor cords at graduation to each member. See the organization's website at http://www.omicrondeltaepsilon.org.\n\nSigma Theta Tau International, the Honor Society of Nursing, was founded in 1922 by six nursing students at Indiana University. The founders chose the name from the initials of the Greek words Storga, Tharos, and Tima, to mean love, courage, and honor. The purpose of the Society is to recognize superior achievement, to develop leadership skills, to foster high standards, to encourage creative work, and to strengthen commitment to the ideals of the nursing profession. The Society is a partnership of more than 200,000 members residing in 70 countries, and it has 356 chapters in more than 400 colleges and universities. The Mu Chi Chapter of the Society was established at Fairfield University in 1989. Membership is conferred upon junior, senior, and graduate level students who demonstrate superior scholastic achievement, academic integrity, leadership potential, and marked accomplishment in nursing. The Chapter has grown to nearly 400 members.\n\nMembers of Mu Chi are committed to fostering nursing leadership, research and creativity. Standards for membership include demonstrated excellence in scholarship and/or exceptional achievement in nursing. Several Mu Chi members are active on both regional and international committees of Sigma Theta Tau International. Remarkable in its short history, the Mu Chi Chapter has received the prestigious \"Chapter Key Award\" four times. This award is presented to active chapters who exhibit overall excellence in achieving the goals and mission of Sigma Theta Tau International."
