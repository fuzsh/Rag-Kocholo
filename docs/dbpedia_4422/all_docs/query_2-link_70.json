        "text": "Our Chapter\n\nLetter From the president\n\nHi,\n\nMy name is Abigail Way, and I am the President of Delta Sigma Pi. I would like to officially welcome you to the website for the Epsilon Chapter of Delta Sigma Pi, America’s Foremost Business Fraternity! The Epsilon chapter, which operates at the University of Iowa, is a chapter that is celebrating its 103rd active year, an achievement that makes us the longest active chapter in the nation. Our chapter’s excellence is rooted in and demonstrated by our three pillars: service, professionalism, and brotherhood.\n\nDelta Sigma Pi is an organization founded on the belief that each student, regardless of race, gender, or ethnicity, should be afforded the opportunity to develop professional relationships in their college careers that will set them up for post-graduation. With over 100 exceptional individuals at Iowa and a 280,000+ alumni network, Delta Sigma Pi is truly a great way to foster success through hands-on training, internships, and applicable leadership experience that directly correlates to full-time job offers.\n\nBeyond professionalism and leadership experience, Delta Sigma Pi Epsilon’s greatest asset is its members. Warren Buffett once said, “Surround yourself with people that push you to do and be better. No drama or negativity. Just higher goals and higher motivation.” This chapter’s success cannot be attributed to one single member, but rather each member we have initiated over 100 years. The members of Delta Sigma Pi Epsilon are passionate, smart, and hardworking and I am proud to grow professionally and personally alongside them.\n\nThe opportunities in our organization are limitless. The leadership positions available allow members to get involved immediately – I have held five different officer positions for five semesters now and there are still dozens of other positions that I could pursue. Our alumni base stretches all around the world – brothers are always willing to help by mentoring and linking us to opportunities at companies in a wide range of industries. Every semester, we host a private career fair, attend a professional trip to a city in the Midwest, host multiple professional workshops and panels, bring in multiple speakers from diverse backgrounds, and plan several other activities that help our members grow professionally.\n\nIf you have any interest in our organization or have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at the contact information below – I am only an e-mail away and am happy to get on the phone or meet in person.\n\nCheers,\n\nAbigail Way"
