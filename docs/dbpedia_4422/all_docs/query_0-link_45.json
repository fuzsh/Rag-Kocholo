Lyon established the Alpha Eta Iota chapter in 2011.\n\nMembers must have at least junior status, a “B” average in at least 10 credits of political science courses, and an overall GPA rank in the top third of their class.\n\nPresident: Vacant\n\nNational Website\n\nAdvisor\n\nBradley R. Gitz\n\nWilliam Jefferson Clinton Professor of International Politics"
