        "text": "Biology\n\nAdvisors: Roger Greenwell & Nirvana Filoramo\n\nBeta Beta Beta (TriBeta) is a society for students, particularly undergraduates, dedicated to improving the understanding and appreciation of biological study and extending boundaries of human knowledge through scientific research. Since its founding in 1922, more than 200,000 persons have been accepted into lifetime membership, and more than 670 chapters have been established throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.\n\nBusiness Administration\n\nMembership in Sigma Beta Delta is the highest national recognition a business student can receive at a college or university with a Sigma Beta Delta chapter. To be eligible for membership, a business student must rank in the upper 20 percent of the junior, senior or master’s class and be invited to membership by the faculty officers.\n\nChemistry\n\nAdvisor: Anne Falke\n\nGamma Sigma Epsilon is a national chemistry honor society founded in 1919 at Davidson College. The original fraternity was created to promote academic excellence and undergraduate research scholarship in chemistry. In 1931 the fraternity went co-ed and became an honor society. Today there are over seventy active Gamma Sigma Epsilon chapters throughout the United States. The Society is governed by a National Executive Council of elected officers and meets in biennial conventions for the purpose of governance, fellowship, and scientific exchange.\n\nComputer Science\n\nAdvisor: Karl Wurst\n\nThe computing and information disciplines are relatively young. Yet despite their comparative youth, the computing and information disciplines have had an unparalleled effect on almost every aspect of contemporary life. Indeed it is difficult to predict the ultimate place of the computer in our world. It is the express purpose of Upsilon Pi Epsilon to promote the computing and information disciplines and to encourage their contribution to the enhancement of knowledge.\n\nCriminal Justice\n\nAdvisor: Stephen Morreale\n\nIn September, 1941, Dr. Vivian Anderson Leonard was asked by the president of Washington State University if he would accept the directorship of a Police Science Academic Program at Washington State. Dr. Leonard accepted the offer and became responsible for developing a four year curriculum which would lead to a Bachelor’s Degree in Police Administration.\n\nEconomics\n\nAdvisor: William O’Brien\n\nOmicron Delta Epsilon is one of the world’s largest academic honor societies. The objectives of Omicron Delta Epsilon are recognition of scholastic attainment and the honoring of outstanding achievements in economics; the establishment of closer ties between students and faculty in economics within colleges and universities, and among colleges and universities; the publication of its official journal, The American Economist, and sponsoring of panels at professional meetings as well as the Irving Fisher and Frank W. Taussig competitions.\n\nEducation\n\nAdvisor: Pam Hollander\n\nKappa Delta Pi, an international honor society in education founded by Dr. William Bagley in 1911 at the University of Illinois, was established to foster excellence in education and promote fellowship among those dedicated to teaching. The founders chose the name from the Greek words to represent knowledge, duty, and power. Pioneering from its beginning by including women as well as men, Kappa Delta Pi grew from a local chapter to the international organization it is today, comprising 600 chapters and more than 40,000 members.\n\nNursing\n\nAdvisor: Dr. Melissa Duprey & Prof. Bill Chadbourne\n\nSTTI membership is by invitation to baccalaureate and graduate nursing students who demonstrate excellence in scholarship and to nurse leaders exhibiting exceptional achievements in nursing. Here are some additional facts about the membership:\n\nSTTI has more than 135,000 active\n\nmembers.\n\nMembers reside in more than 85\n\ncountries.\n\n39% of active members hold master’s and/or doctoral degrees; 51% are in staff positions; 19% are administrators or supervisors; 18% are faculty/academics; and 12% are in advanced practice.\n\nThere are roughly 500 chapters at approximately 675 institutions of higher education throughout Armenia, Australia, Botswana, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, England, Ghana, Hong Kong, Japan, Kenya, Malawi, Mexico, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Swaziland, Sweden, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.\n\nSTTI communicates regularly with more than 100 nurse leaders who have expressed interest in establishing chapters globally, including those in Chile, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, Finland, India, Ireland, Israel, Germany, Jamaica, Jordan, Lebanon, New Zealand, and Spain.\n\nThe mission of the Honor Society of Nursing, Sigma Theta Tau International, is advancing world health and celebrating nursing excellence in scholarship, leadership, and service.\n\nSigma Theta Tau International’s vision is to be the global organization of choice for nursing.\n\nWorld Languages\n\nAdvisor: Judy Jeon-Chapman\n\nAlpha Mu Gamma has as its primary purpose the honoring of students for outstanding achievement during their first year of foreign language study in college. However, students may be admitted at any stage in their college careers. Upon initiation a member receives a parchment certificate of membership and may wear the scroll-shaped gold key or pin."
