        "text": "Fraternities and sororities at UAFS offer many opportunities for students to be involved in a growing community that includes three sororities, four fraternities, two governing councils, two all-Greek honor societies, and a programming board. Students in fraternities and sororities develop the foundation for a life built on leadership, academics, social engagement, and service. Our fraternities and sororities conduct separate formal recruitment processes during the beginning of the fall semester in an effort to recruit new members.\n\nFraternities\n\nKappa Alpha Order\n\nKappa Sigma\n\nPi Kappa Phi\n\nSigma Nu\n\nSororities\n\nAlpha Omicron Pi\n\nDelta Gamma\n\nGamma Phi Beta\n\nInterfraternity Council\n\nThe governing council for men’s fraternities on campus consists of an executive board and delegates from each represented fraternity at UAFS.
