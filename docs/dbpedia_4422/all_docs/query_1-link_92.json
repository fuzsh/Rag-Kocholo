        "text": "FAYETTEVILLE -- The headquarters of the Kappa Sigma fraternity has suspended its University of Arkansas at Fayetteville chapter -- the largest fraternity at UA -- pending an investigation into unspecified allegations.\n\n\"The Kappa Sigma Fraternity has received information alleging behavior occurring at our Xi Chapter at the University of Arkansas that is inconsistent with our Code of Conduct,\" the organization said in a statement released Wednesday.\n\nSuspension of the chapter's activities is \"a precaution\" pending an investigation, the statement said. Per the group's policies, no further information will be released regarding an ongoing investigation, the statement said.\n\nOn Wednesday, UA spokesman Scott Flanagin said the university had yet to receive any formal notification from the group's headquarters about the suspension. The university would review any outside investigation, Flanagin said. UA could then conduct its own investigation, he said, though the university may also choose to uphold the findings from the outside group.\n\nThe fraternity at UA has about 281 members, according to Parice Bowser, UA's Greek Life director. It was established at UA in 1890. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and architect Fay Jones, for whom the UA architecture school is named, are among the notable names associated with the UA chapter of the fraternity.\n\nRusty Jackson, the fraternity's chapter president, said the group \"has no comment until we meet with the national fraternity, and then they will send out a report,\" adding, \"we don't know what's going on.\"\n\nFlanagin said he was not aware of any current problems with the chapter, such as probation or university sanctions.\n\nThe university in January 2014 concluded that the group violated university conduct rules regarding alcohol possession and providing alcohol to minors. UA also found that the group failed to register an event in accordance with university rules. Among other sanctions, the group was placed on probation and ordered to perform community service.\n\nIn November 2013, UA found the group responsible for hosting an unauthorized function.\n\nAnother UA fraternity, Sigma Chi, was suspended by the group's headquarters Jan. 30 in response to hazing allegations. Flanagin said representatives from that group's headquarters will visit Fayetteville next week for their investigation.\n\nMetro on 03/03/2016"
