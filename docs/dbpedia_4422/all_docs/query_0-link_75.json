Sigma Alpha Mu’s Mission is to foster the development of collegiate men and our alumni by instilling strong fraternal values, offering social and service opportunities, encouraging academic excellence and teaching leadership skills. We will continue to attract members of all beliefs who appreciate our great heritage as a fraternity of Jewish men.\n\nWe are re-establishing chapters at:\n\nRutgers (Sigma Delta)\n\nBinghamton Interest Group (Gamma Sigma)\n\nUniversity of Iowa (Gamma Omicron)\n\nUniversity of California-Berkeley (Sigma Sigma)\n\nUniversity of Washington (Sigma Nu)\n\nUniversity of Miami (Mu Epsilon)\n\nNew chapters have recently started at Purdue, Clemson, and others.\n\nKnow a student enrolled at one of these campuses? We’d love to connect with them about the Founding Father experience."
