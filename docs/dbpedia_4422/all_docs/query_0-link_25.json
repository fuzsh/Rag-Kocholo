        "text": "Alpha Arkansas of Sigma Phi Epsilon at the University of Arkansas\n\nRedefining the Fraternity Experience\n\nFor over two decades, the Arkansas Alpha chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon has lacked a dedicated space for gatherings, meetings, meals, and socializing. Despite this challenge, the chapter has thrived with over 200 members. Sigma Phi Epsilon has consistently ranked among the top three UA fraternities for GPA/scholarship, service, philanthropy, and sports. Located just south of campus, the Alpha Chapter's future home sits on the iconic North Arkansas Avenue.\n\nThe two-story design of the new Sigma Phi Epsilon house is a symbol of progress and growth. The new home will provide a comprehensive space that addresses the diverse needs of its 192-man chapter. The new state-of-the-art facilities include meeting space for the entire chapter, catering and resident kitchens, and rooms for 14 brothers.\n\nThis project required a facade that would complement the neighboring homes that make up this historical street. Through extensive research, our team decided to use a fireproof cement fiber board that looks like traditional lap siding. This resulted in a design that offers modern solutions to important safety measures and maintains the heritage of the neighborhood.\n\nAdditionally, the new house provides a venue for alumni to reunite. Future generations will be influenced by their leadership to carry on the enduring legacy of the chapter. Set to open in 2024, the new home will not only meet urgent needs of the chapter but will enable the brotherhood to continue growing and flourishing."
