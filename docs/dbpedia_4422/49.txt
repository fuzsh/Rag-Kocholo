The Beta Pi Chapter of Eta Sigma Phi had

a successful and fun year. The first activity

was a Cena Deorum on October 30, 2010.

Members dressed as gods, goddesses, or any

other mythological character and gathered

for food and group readings of plays. At this

event and throughout the year, the chapter

sold Clytemnestra T-shirts as a fundraiser.

After this event, Eta Sigma Phi sponsored

a joint talk by the faculty of Classical

Studies at the University of Arkansas.

Drs. Alexandra Pappas, Dave Fredrick,

and Daniel Levine each spoke about their

respective current research projects. The

event had a great turnout and was followed

by pizza at Tim’s.

On December 11, Eta Sigma Phi had a

Saturnalia, where we inducted new members.

At the Saturnalia, we had translation

games, gifts, and a potluck.

Over spring break, Dr. Levine took a

few students to the national convention in

Austin, Texas. Shortly after, Eta Sigma Phi

hosted a speaker, Joe Goodkin. Mr. Goodkin

sang a version of Homer’s Odyssey that

he set to music. He accompanied himself

on the guitar and sang for thirty minutes.

The event took place in the University of

Arkansas’ Greek Theatre. Following the

event, Eta Sigma Phi hosted a banquet in

Carnall Hall. The entire event was open to

the public and yielded a great turnout. It

was a year of fun and classical learning for

the Beta Pi chapter!
