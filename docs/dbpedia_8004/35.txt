Debenhams Retail Ireland, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the British department store, has applied to the High Court in Dublin seeking the appointment of an interim examiner.

The company has been operating with financial losses for years and in the last financial year it reported losses of €6.7 million due to ‘disproportionately’ high operating costs.

Under Irish law, the examinership process provides a company with the protection of the court to assist its survival. To obtain the appointment of an examiner, who will prepare a scheme of arrangement with creditors, the company has to persuade the court that there is a reasonable prospect of turnaround.
