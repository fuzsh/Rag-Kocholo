        "text": "DEBENHAMS is set to close all of its stores, putting 12,000 jobs at risk.\n\nThe department store chain will start a liquidation process after JD Sports confirmed it had pulled out of a possible rescue deal.\n\nWho owns Debenhams?\n\nIn April 2019, Debenhams first went into administration, wiping out equity investors - including Mike Ashley's Sports Direct.\n\nIt is now owned by lenders consortium Celine UK NewCo 1 Ltd.\n\nWhy is the department store chain going into liquidation?\n\nThe business is set to be liquidated after JDSports pulled out of bids to save the 242-year-old department store chain which has been in administration since April 2019.\n\nJD Sports was the last remaining bidder for Debenhams.\n\nDebenhams said its administrators have \"regretfully\" decided to start winding down operations while continuing to seek offers \"for all or parts of the business\".\n\nIt is understood that the collapse of rescue talks were partly linked to the administration of Arcadia Group.\n\nArcadia is the biggest operator of concessions in Debenhams stores and went into administration on November 30, 2020.\n\nIn a brief statement to the London Stock Exchange, Debenhams said: \"JD Sports Fashion, the leading retailer of sports, fashion and outdoor brands, confirms that discussions with the administrators of Debenhams regarding a potential acquisition of the UK business have now been terminated.\"\n\nCoronavirus restrictions and the closure of non-essential shops have put immense pressure on retailers and the high street in 2020.\n\nGeoff Rowley, of FRP Advisory, joint administrator to Debenhams, said: \"All reasonable steps were taken to complete a transaction that would secure the future of Debenhams.\n\n\"However, the economic landscape is extremely challenging and, coupled with the uncertainty facing the UK retail industry, a viable deal could not be reached.\n\n\"The decision to move forward with a closure programme has been carefully assessed and, while we remain hopeful that alternative proposals for the business may yet be received, we deeply regret that circumstances force us to commence this course of action.\n\n\"We are very grateful for the efforts of the management team and staff who have worked so hard throughout the most difficult of circumstances to keep the business trading.\"\n\nWhen was the company founded?\n\nDebenhams' history goes back to 1778 when William Clark established a drapers store at 44 Wigmore Street in London's West End selling expensive fabrics, bonnets, gloves and parasols.\n\nIn 1813 William Debenham invested in the firm which then became Clark & Debenham.\n\nThe first store outside London was opened in Cheltenham in 1818.\n\nBy 1950, Debenhams was the largest department store group in the UK, owning 84 companies and 110 stores.\n\nWho is CEO Stefaan Vansteenkiste?\n\nStefaan Vansteenkiste is a former restructuring specialist from Alvarez & Marsal.\n\nHe first joined Debenhams in April 2019 as chief restructuring officer.\n\nVansteenkiste was then appointed chief executive in August on an interim basis.\n\nIn 2020 he announced he stepped down from his position but would continue to work for the department store chain as a consultant.\n\nWill there be a sale in January?\n\nIt is not known yet whether there will be a sale in January.\n\nThe company said it will continue to trade through its 124 UK stores and online to clear its current and contracted stocks.\n\n\"On conclusion of this process, if no alternative offers have been received, the UK operations will close,\" the company said in a statement."
