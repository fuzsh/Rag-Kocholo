        "text": "Frasers Group has acquired the former Debenhams store on Henry Street in Dublin city centre. The retail group plans to turn the 200,000ft² site into its flagship Sports Direct store. The company already operates a Sports Direct store on North Earl Street, parallel to the Henry Street location on the other side of O'Connell Street.\n\nFrasers Group has been gradually expanding its operations in Ireland, opening the first Flannels at Blanchardstown earlier this month, and it will also have a presence at the Cleary's Quarter when it opens on O'Connell Street next year.\n\nGer Wright, managing director of sports for Frasers Group, commented: \"Dublin is a strategic market for the group, and this site will allow us to grow our presence in Ireland as we continue to expand and deliver our elevation strategy. Not only does this acquisition bolster our commitment to the Irish market, but it further demonstrates our dedication to re-inventing retail and injecting new life into high streets across the UK and Europe. We are the leading destination for sportswear and are committed to bringing the very best brands, environment, and experience to key retail locations.\""
