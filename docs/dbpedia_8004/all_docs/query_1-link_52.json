        "text": "Founded in London 1778, after years of struggles the impact of COVID-19 finally sealed it's fate after 242 years. Bought by Boohoo group, the brand lives on but now only trades online. Physical presence of Debenhams ended in May 2021 leaving behind large empty units on High Streets, Retail Parks and in Shopping Centres.\n\nDebenhams Locations\n\nDebenhams were located on High Streets and Shopping Centres in City, Town & Urban Centres, Retail Parks and standalone Shopping Centres.\n\nThe final closures affected 114 towns.\n\nLondon, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield were the hardest hit cities losing 2 or more Debenhams from their retail offer and leaving big empty units behind left to fill. Of these 56% are still vacant. The larger the town the higher the vacancy rates.\n\nWe reviewed 126 Debenhams units which closed across 2020 and 2021\n\nResearch shows there are lots of plans in place for many of these still empty spaces, with some already in use. Strategies include retailer relocations, new stores, redevelopment into flats and change to leisure use for these units which became vacant from May 2021. However vacant is still the dominant position.\n\nSummary of uses\n\nThere is some commercial risk and only certain occupiers are interested in units of this size with multiple floors. Mixed-use redevelopment of upper floors to residential and workspace conversions can be desirable leaving smaller square footage to lease on the groud floor to retail & leisure in order to maintain frontage in the retail places.\n\nAverage monthly footfall is higher in the Retail Places of the vacant units (46,000) vs those which are due to or already being occupied (37,500). This makes sense when relating back to the bigger towns and stronger retail places which can demand higher rents, if willing to take the plunge the footfall could be exploited.\n\nSummary by Retailers\n\nSome brands have taken the opportunity to open in new locations or relocate from existing, primarily to benefit from the larger unit.\n\nMarks & Spencer lead the way having either occupied or with plans to open in 8 of the former Debenhams units. In May 2022 they opened on Retail Parks in Stevenage and Llandudno followed by Chesterfield in the November. Leeds White Rose relocation welcomed shoppers in May 2023, with Liverpool One opening later this month (15th August 2023). Birmingham Bullring, Manchester Trafford Centre and Lakeside Shopping Centre relocations set to be ready later in 2023.\n\nDunelm took advantage and relocated from the Rugby Central Shopping Centre they previously operated in to the empty unit on Elliotts Field Retail Park. Workington will welcome TK Maxx this month (August 2023), local shoppers would have previously had to travel 32 miles to Carlisle to bag their fashion and home bargains.\n\nFull details of which retailers have taken which units below.\n\nSummary by Region\n\nThis map shows the number of Debenhams units which were left empty and the percent of those which are still vacant, as of July 2023*. Vacant could mean there are plans submitted to utilise these but for now the retail landscape is faced with a blank frontage.\n\nList of the 126 stores which closed in 2020 and 2021 which we analysed\n\nFrom mini hospitals to flats, the empty units are being utilised for an array of activities. While some maintain a retail occupancy, many are still vacant or are in the pipeline for redevelopment.

From what we can see from the legacy estate of Debenhams it leaves us to wonder what will the face of the high street and the draw of shopping centres look like in the next few years. This feels like a blog in it's own right.\n\nIf you are interested to find out more about the Retail Place, Footfall or Town boundary data we used in the analysis please get in contact at info@geolytix.com or through LinkedIn.\n\nLouise Cross, Product Owner at GEOLYTIX\n\nMain Image: Sheffield Debenhams unit sits empty on The Moor.
