        "text": "Debenhams PLC on April 9 rejected an improved £200 million rescue bid from Sports Direct International PLC and asked for its shares to be suspended, paving the way for the U.K. department store operator's lenders to take control of the business and seek a form of bankruptcy protection.\n\nDebenhams on April 8 rejected Sports Direct's proposal to underwrite a £150 million rights issue, which was conditional on £148 million of debt being written off and Mike Ashley, Sports Direct's CEO, being appointed CEO of Debenhams. On April 9, Sports Direct offered to raise the rights issue to £200 million and reduce the debt write-off to £82 million, a bid that was also rejected.\n\nIn a statement, Debenhams said its \"lenders have confirmed to the company that the proposal, on the terms set out, was not sufficient to justify an extension to the 8 April deadline\" for its refinancing.\n\nThe department store chain said it is now in talks with its lenders to draw down the second tranche of the refinanced facilities agreed on March 29, which would most likely take the form of a debt-for-equity swap and result in no value for shareholders. It has also requested that its shares be suspended from trading.\n\nAs the refinancing was conditional upon Debenhams' subsidiaries being placed under the ownership of a lender-approved entity, it now appears likely to pursue a company voluntary arrangement, a form of U.K. bankruptcy protection.\n\nSports Direct, which is Debenhams' largest shareholder and has repeatedly criticized the company's management team, has made a number of proposals to the struggling retailer, all of which were conditional upon Ashley being named CEO. All of the offers have been rejected, though the company said April 8 that it still has until April 22 to decide whether it will proceed with its possible 5 pence per share takeover bid."
