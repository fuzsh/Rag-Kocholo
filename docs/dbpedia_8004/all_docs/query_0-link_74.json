        "text": "Never again.\n\nI never realised I was ordering from the Debenhams UK site when visiting 'Debenhams Ireland'. I ordered weeks before the Christmas cut off date and the majority of the order still has yet to arrive, meaning I was missing Christmas gifts for family. One of the fragile items that did arrive was completely smashed. Customer service has been no help in any way. I would never place an order with them again.\n\nDate of experience : December 30, 2020\n\nI have given one star as I cannot…\n\nI have given one star as I cannot proceed to comment without selecting ar least one star. I wanted to select zero stars. I am here to protest. Debenhams continue to trade online despite not paying their staff their redundancy payments owed to them from the Covid-19 emergency. Until they do, I will not buy anything from Debenhams or their related companies. And will communicate their failure to pay to as many people as I can.\n\nDebenhams. Act with integrity. Pay up.\n\nDate of experience : July 18, 2020\n\nWouldn’t even give one star\n\nWouldn’t even give one star. Company is a disgrace. Still selling products to people that are “going missing”, half empty or damaged. They aren’t responding to any of my emails or my friend and family who have also had issues. My order was before covid and before they closed down stores. DO NOT ORDER WITH DEBENHAMS. If Debenhams can’t handle customer service don’t take people’s Monday. Absolutely delighted they went into liquidation in Ireland, hopefully they will in England soon. Terrible company.\n\nDate of experience : June 20, 2020\n\nVery efficient service\n\nOrdered a dress off their website on Thursday and had it by Monday. Delivery service is nightline and they came within the time they specified in the emails. Very promped service. I suppose all the negative reviews here are due to the treatment of staff due to closure of stores, which I am sorry about, but honestly it doesn't reflect the quality of service in my opinion, which has been very good.\n\nDate of experience : August 10, 2020\n\nDebenhams online scam\n\nI was scammed when I bought from Debenhams online had no idea I was signing up to Complete savings when I purchased, it is not clear on the website that when I purchased from Debenhams that I would be agreeing to allow Complete Savings take €15 per month from my account. I didn't want to do this and didn't l know I had done this. Debenhams are complicit in taking money from their genuine customers. I suspected I am one of very many who have been duped by Debenhams and Complete Savings in Ireland and the UK. This is a very shabby way to make money. I've had to cancel my debit card and I'm not sure if I can get my money back, take care buying online from Debenhams\n\nDate of experience : February 18, 2020\n\nmade two orders - none received\n\nmade two orders - one got lost and the other never progressed past taking my money - chap on phone kept apologising and I know its not his fault but it means I am out of pocket for nearly two weeks and nothing to show for it except bank charges for the four transactions no present to give family member and no outfit to wear to the occasion\n\nand absolutely no mention of some kind of compensation for the inconvenience\n\nDate of experience : December 04, 2019"
