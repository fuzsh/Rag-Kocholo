        "text": "Since being founded in 2006, Boohoo has grown to be one of the largest online fashion companies in the UK.\n\nThe Manchester-headquartered group has been steadily growing its stable of brands since acquiring PrettyLittleThing in 2017.\n\nIt's now home to major household names such as Debenhams, which it bought for £55m when the department store chain collapsed into administration.\n\nREAD MORE: Click here to sign up to the BusinessLive North West newsletter\n\nBoohoo, being a listed company, files its accounts with the London Stock Exchange every quarter. However, it does not include a breakdown of each of its brand's performance in those figures.\n\nThose businesses remain private and their results have only just been filed with Companies House.\n\nBoohoo reported its group results for the financial year to February 28, 2022, in May. It also posted its results for the following six months in September.\n\nUsing the newly-published accounts for Boohoo's roster of brands, BusinessLive has outlined how each of them has fared over their latest financial year.\n\nDebenhams\n\nDebenhams was bought by Boohoo in a £55m deal in January 2021 when the department store chain collapsed into administration.\n\nAll the stores were closed and the brand now exists online only.\n\nIn the period from January 14, 2021, to February 28, 2022, Debenhams posted a revenue of £56.9m and a pre-tax loss of £11.7m.\n\nA statement signed off by the board, which was also included in all of the other financial documents for the other group brands, said: \"The global market for online fashion is forecast to continue to grow, which provides a favourable backdrop for the company with much opportunity for further growth.\n\n\"Customers throughout the world are seeking a wide choice of quality fashion forward products at value prices, generally lower than those available on the high street, with the convenience of home delivery.\n\n\"The company's target market has a high propensity to spend on fashion and the market has proven to be quite resilient to external macroeconomic factors.\n\n\"The pandemic has impacted our business and is most significantly seen in the unpredictability of customer demand, the rate of customer returns, the increase in shipping times and the cost of shipping on both inbound and outbound products.\n\n\"Some of these factors, such as the rate of customer returns, have already reverted from the low rates during the pandemic to rates seen before the pandemic, while other factors such as the shipping cost increases are taking longer to move towards pre-pandemic levels.\"\n\nDebenhams added: \"We remain extremely confident in the company's future growth prospects, and as short-term demand uncertainty and material cost headwinds as a result of the pandemic unwind, the company's belief that it continues to be capable of executing its strategy aimed at leading the fashion e-commerce market remains unchanged.\"\n\nPrettyLittleThing\n\nA fall in sales outside the UK and USA slowed PrettyLittleThing's growth during its latest financial year as return rates rose.\n\nThe brand posted a revenue of £712.2m for the 12 months to February 28, 2022, up from the £710.1m it achieved in the prior year.\n\nHowever, the company's pre-tax profits fell from £98.7m to £75.1m over the same period.\n\nPrettyLittleThing said its pre-tax profits were impacted by £11.6m of costs related to the automation of its Sheffield warehouse, a £125m project.\n\nThe company was established in 2012 by brothers Umar and Adam Kamani. It was bought by Boohoo, which had been co-founded by their father Mahmud Kamani, in January 2017.\n\nNasty Gal\n\nUS-focused Nasty Gal was bought by Boohoo in 2017 for $20m after it filed for bankruptcy. It was founded by Sophia Amoruso in LA in 2006.\n\nFor the 12 months to February 28, 2022, the brand's revenue decreased from £140.2m to £11.4m and it slipped from a pre-tax profit of £5.8m to a loss of £16.8m.\n\nNasty Gal said it has established a \"strong following\" in the UK but that \"continued extended delivery times to the key US market, driven by reduced airfreight capacity, have subdued demand\".\n\nIts USA revenue fell from £71m to £62.8m while its UK sales went from £42.7m to £31.2m.\n\nRevenue in the rest of Europe also dropped from £15.5m to £9.4m and from £10.9m to £6.8m in the rest of the world.\n\nKaren Millen\n\nKaren Millen was founded in 1981 and has been owned by Boohoo since 2019 when it, and its sister company Coast, were bought out of administration for £18m.\n\nThe brand became online only and its standalone stores were closed.\n\nFor the year to February 28, 2022, Karen Millen's revenue increased from £9.6m to £67.5m and its pre-tax profits jumped from £6.1m to £12.1m.\n\nIts UK sales rose from £27.7m to £45.3m and from £2.4m to £8.8m in the USA.\n\nThey also increases from £6.9m to £8.6m in the rest of Europe and from £2.4m to £4.6m in the rest of the world.\n\nKaren Millen said that \"exceptional growth\" in the USA is \"adding to an already highly successful relaunch of this iconic brand\".\n\nCoast\n\nFounded in 1996, Coast was bought out of administration alongside Karen Millen in 2018.
