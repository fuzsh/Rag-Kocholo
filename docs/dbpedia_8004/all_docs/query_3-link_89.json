        "text": "This morning (13 November), Ikea-owner Ingka Group announced its acquisition of the Brighton-based Churchill Square Shopping Centre.\n\nThe deal, estimated to be worth £145m, will see the former Debenhams unit inside the shopping centre reopened as an Ikea City Store.\n\nThe two-storey space has stood unoccupied since 15 May 2021 following Debenhams's £55m sale to Boohoo Group in January 2021.\n\nUnder the new ownership, Debenhams has been repositioning itself as a digital department store.\n\nIkea UK and Ireland country retail manager and chief sustainability officer, Peter Jelkeby said: “We will step up our omnichannel investments, both in Brighton and the rest of the country, with a simple goal: to become more customer centric.”"
