        "text": "LIMERICK’s branch of Debenhams looks likely to remain open after the way was paved for its parent company’s exit from examinership.\n\nThere were fears for dozens of jobs in May after an interim examiner was appointed to Debenhams Retail (Ireland), a wholly owned subsidiary of Debenhams.\n\nBut now Debenhams Retail Ireland has agreed a rent deal with the US fund Marathon Asset Management\n\nIt applied to the courts for a rejection of the current leases in place at four of its stores, including Limerick’s store in the heart of O’Connell Street.\n\nThis store is owned by Marathon.\n\nUnder examinership legislation, a company can seek to have onerous leases set aside if it fails to agree new terms with the landlord.\n\nThe courts cannot, however, set aside, any guarantees, given over the leases by its parent company, in this case, Debenhams plc.\n\nWith Marathon agreeing terms with Debenhams last week, it is now widely expected that the examiner Kieran Wallace, will put in place a scheme of arrangements with the company creditors safeguarding the chain’s future.\n\nDebenhams, which has 11 stores around the country, is one of the city’s major retailers, occupying a prime spot at the junction of Sarsfield Street and the main thoroughfare."
