        "text": "The ASTI notes that former-Debenhams workers have accepted proposals to end their industrial dispute in a ballot conducted by Mandate trade union.\n\nThe ASTI commends the courage and perseverance demonstrated by these Mandate members over the past year, often in the face of unacceptable and intolerable conditions. Their struggle - in the context of a pandemic - involving pickets, protests, marches, occupations, blockades and sit-down protests is an example of extraordinary trade union activism in pursuit of their just rights and entitlements.\n\nIt is now essential that the Government prioritises the necessary legislative changes to ensure no workers will face the circumstances experienced by the former-Debenhams workers in the future.\n\nEnds"
