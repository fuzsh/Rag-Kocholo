        "text": "Debenhams/Roches Stores\n\nDebenhams Ireland has its origins in Roches Stores, a business founded in Cork in 1901 by William Roche, as a small furniture shop, the chain grew to eleven stores throughout Ireland. Merchant's Quay Shopping Centre in Cork was opened in 1989, and the store became an anchor. At their peak, eight of the locations also had co-located grocery stores. Roches Stores began to exit the grocery trade in 1999, leasing its stores to SuperValu, although some of these stores closed after mere months.\n\nIn October 2007, Roches Stores ceased operating. On 8 August 2006, it was announced that Debenhams would buy the leaseholds of nine of the 11 Roches Stores for €29 million. Under the deal, the stores, including those in St. Patrick's Street in Cork and Henry Street in Dublin would be rebranded as Debenhams stores, with this one keeping it's anchor status at Merchants Quay. The Roche family retained the ownership of the stores, and Debenhams became the new tenants. Marks & Spencer had agreed to acquire the company's Wilton outlet in Cork; however that deal later fell through due to a dispute over rent with the owners of the centre. In April 2020, with the parent company going into administration, it was announced that Debenhams Ireland stores - which were already temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic - would be permanently closed.\n\nCame across this Debby whilst on a regular Ireland lead check before our trip there earlier this year. The humungous glass skylight and old photographs showed promise inside, where although it seemed to have been modernised, there appeared to be some Art Deco features retained and some vintage mall scenes, which is right up my street. On our visit, it went pretty sweetly. Despite triggering an alarm and the premises being adjoined to a very busy Merchants Quay Shopping Centre, no one turned up and we were free to wander through the building for a couple hours. However, it was clear that later on, someone had showed up eventually, as the door we had left ajar for a return visit was closed.\n\nAtrium was lovely and symmetrical.\n\nIntact displays.\n\nMain entrance.\n\nRestaurant.\n\nThat was pretty much it. We didn't check every inch, because of the anticipation of a security personnel, so left briskly. Video here if you want to view same place in mp4 <3\n\nThanks for reading ​"
