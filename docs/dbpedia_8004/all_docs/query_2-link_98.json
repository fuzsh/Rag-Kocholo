A four-storey extension will also be added.\n\nThe main works are expected to start in the coming weeks, with completion slated for early 2025.\n\nPlans for the £68.5m redevelopment were approved by Manchester City Council in January 2021.\n\nThe building has been vacant since Debenhams went into administration in December 2020. It had housed the department store chain since 1973.\n\nIt had been originally constructed as a warehouse for textiles manufacturer Rylands and Sons in 1932 and became a department store in the 1950s.\n\nConstruction company Russell WBHO is acting as a construction partner for the project while property companies OBI and Barker Proudlove are letting agents for the building.\n\nREAD MORE:"
