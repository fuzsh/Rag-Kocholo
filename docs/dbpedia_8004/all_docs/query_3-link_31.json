        "text": "Earlier today it was announced that Boohoo Group has bought Debenhams' brand and website for £55m, in a deal that does not include its 124 stores, financial services or stock. All 12,000 Debenhams staff will be made redundant.\n\nThe Debenhams website will relaunch on Boohoo Group's platform in early spring. To allow for a winding-down of Debenhams' operations, its website will continue to operate for an agreed period before the relaunch.\n\nBoohoo Group said it intends to rebuild and relaunch the Debenhams website to grow into new categories, and create “the UK's largest marketplace” across fashion, beauty, sport and homeware, where it will add new brands over time. The etailer said Debenhams’ own fashion brands, including Maine, Mantaray and Principles, will be absorbed into the group’s existing brand portfolio, and sold via the core Debenhams site and its own pureplay websites.\n\nBoohoo now has an opportunity to do things in the beauty world, which it perhaps wasn’t able to do before\n\nAndrew Jennings, global retail adviser\n\nThe group said it will continue to operate the Debenhams wholesale business for beauty, but will also look to add new beauty brands via the marketplace model. Debenhams has 6 million beauty shoppers and 1.4 million “Beauty Club” members.\n\n“The acquisition of the Debenhams brand is an important development for the group, as we seek to capture incremental growth opportunities arising from the accelerating shift to online retail,” said John Lyttle, Boohoo Group CEO.\n\n“The acquisition represents an exciting strategic opportunity to transform our target addressable market through the creation of an online marketplace that leverages Debenhams’ high brand awareness and traffic through the development of beauty and fashion partnerships connecting brands with consumers.”\n\nBeauty of the deal\n\nSeveral industry onlookers welcomed the deal.\n\n“It’s a great move for Boohoo Group – number one, being that Debenhams has 30%-35% of its business in beauty,\" global retail adviser Andrew Jennings told Drapers.\n\n\"Boohoo now has an opportunity to do things in the beauty world, which it perhaps wasn’t able to do before. Second, Debenhams is a household name. It is well known among younger and older customers, and there are some big opportunities for both brands to really move forward in a very positive direction. Boohoo also wants to get into homeware, which Debenhams is also good at.”\n\nBoohoo will have done this for the data and the 300 million or so visits a year to the Debenhams website\n\nDebenhams supplier\n\nJohn Stevenson, analyst at Peel Hunt, agreed that Boohoo now has a chance to capture a large slice of the beauty market: “The financial and strategic opportunities are significant. Beauty is the fastest-growing and least-penetrated online market, with Debenhams enjoying the number one market position in makeup in the UK, number two in skincare and number two in prestige beauty (of course, these figures include physical retail). Boohoo already deals with a number of the leading brands [including Garnier and Maybelline], but will clearly look to on-board and secure relationships going forward, leveraging the strength of Debenhams existing market position.”\n\nOne Debenhams supplier told Drapers that the department store's customer database was a key factor behind Boohoo's interest: “The news about Boohoo came from nowhere, but [Boohoo] is after the beauty pound, so it makes sense. Boohoo will have done this for the data and the 300 million or so visits a year to the Debenhams website. To get that many people to visit your site via PPC [pay-per-click] and marketing would cost you the earth.”\n\nThe Debenhams website generated net revenues of around £400m in its most recent financial year to 31 August. Boohoo said Debenhams gets around 300 million UK website visits annually, making it a top 10 retail website in the UK by traffic.\n\nAnother Debenhams supplier said: “I think it’s the best thing to have happened to Debenhams. I’m not surprised that someone has bought the online business – it has always been the jewel in the crown for Debenhams. It’s not just the intellectual property, it’s the database. This acquisition will provide access to its customers and the ability to directly market to those people, which is presumably what Boohoo wants and needs to do to continue in its shift towards becoming a marketplace.”\n\nSeveral suppliers said the acquisition has left question marks around future business ties.\n\n“Boohoo is a successful online fashion retailer built on sourcing that responds to fashion very quickly at volume prices, can those qualities be successfully applied to a department store website selling a multitude of products?” a third Debenhams supplier asked. “What will the impact on Debenhams' margins be for suppliers who no longer have the business generated by the vast number of stores and cannot substantiate the volume discounts? There are a lot of questions.”\n\nOne third-party brand stocked in Debenhams said: “Boohoo can do a good job, and will help create more branded product offerings around the Debenhams business, so maybe brands and suppliers can regain some business back here.\n\n“The sad news is that the store closures will mean so many redundancies, and that’s hard to hear at the start of another already uncertain year. The high street is losing yet another big anchor company. Debenhams has been such a huge part of UK and Irish retail that we grew up with, worked with and held high.”\n\nSeveral industry sources agreed the closure of Debenhams’ 124 stores is another devastating blow for the high street.\n\n“Today marks a very sad day for the fashion industry,\" a fourth Debenhams supplier said. \"It is desperately sad for the high street and those Debenhams employees – we’re talking thousands of jobs. It is good that someone has bought part of Debenhams and the name, and the fact it can trade, but it is very bad news for staff in the stores. Unfortunately, it looks like Arcadia is heading in the same way. Which obviously means huge retail job losses, and a large number of empty units throughout the next year.\"\n\nJennings agreed: “It’s catastrophic that the business went under. It's a result of poor management over too many years, and the business not staying relevant and having the wrong product in its stores. It became a private-label business, and its brands became out of date. Boohoo will never take half the brands they had as they’re not relevant. There will be gaping holes in the towns and cities across the UK.\"\n\nMark Burlton, managing director of independent retail real estate business Cross Border Retail, called for the government to intervene to prevent long-term damage to the high street: “A huge rump of them will take years and years to repurpose, and there’s only so many trampoline parks and food halls that can go into this sort of space before that becomes oversupplied.\n\n“We need some government support to change the lease law so that retailers have a chance to survive under the existing formula of having stores, and the only way they can do that is if they’re affordable. Landlords and tenants have been working hard for an agreement that works, and we now need legislation to back that up.”\n\nNeil Hockin, director and head of the shopping centre leasing team at Lunson-Mitchenall, agreed: “Towns that have Debenhams as anchors could take some time to resolve [the empty space] and the solutions will be different for each store. It’ll be enormously localised. Debenhams are big stores, therefore the solution is quite complicated.”\n\nBoohoo Group's surprising acquisition of Debenhams is a lifeline that could help turn the fortunes of the 208-year-old department store chain around. In turn, Debenhams' beauty and homeware legacy has the potential to assist etailer Boohoo in its mission to diversify and grow its customer base and revenue. However, the closure of 124 Debenhams stores is another hit to the UK fashion retail industry, which is already on its knees. Redundancies are mounting, and as other struggling businesses, including Arcadia Group, seek last minute rescue deals, the holes on the high street are only set to increase."
