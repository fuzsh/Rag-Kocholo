Debenhams Retail Plc (“DR”), the high street retailer, offers goods and services to customers through a number of retail stores in the UK and via the Internet.\n\n2. DR appeals against a liability ruling contained in a letter from the Commissioners to DR dated 3 January 2001 and subsequently confirmed on review by a letter of 16 February 2001, stating that VAT remains due from DR on the full amount paid by customers of DR by means of a credit or debit card. The circumstances in which the decision has been taken are set out in more detail below.\n\n3. As a result of the decision, on 28 February 2001, the Commissioners have issued an assessment for £644,382 plus interest and DR appeals against this.\n\nA brief summary of the issues\n\n4. Until 1 October 2000 DR, a 100% subsidiary of Debenhams Plc, used to sell goods whose price tag showed, for example, £100 (“the ticket price”). Where the customer used a credit card, a debit card or a store card to pay, DR then paid the credit or debit card handling company, or the company behind the store card arrangements, an amount of, say, £1.00 for its exempt card-handling supply. The result was a supply by DR of the goods for £100; and because the amount paid by DR to the card-handling company (the £1.00) was in return for an exempt supply, no VAT relief was obtained for that expenditure.\n\n5. From 1 October 2000 onwards an arrangement was put in place. The arrangement was designed to change the terms on which “the Debenhams Group accepts credit cards in order to produce a position whereby less VAT is paid than was paid previously and for no other reason”. Those words are taken from a letter dated 17 March 2003 written by Ernst & Young (E&Y), the architects of the scheme who have represented Debenhams in the hearing before this Tribunal. The changed arrangements were designed to make the card-paying customer enter into two purported contracts at the point of sale. One was with DR for the sale of the goods (ticket price £100) for £97.50. The other was with another company called Debenhams Card Handling Services Ltd (“DCHS”). DCHS is a wholly owned subsidiary of DR, but is not a member of the same VAT group as DR. Under the latter purported contract 2.5% of the total ticket price was said to be payable to DCHS for exempt card-handling services. The arrangement, if successful, results in DR making a supply of the goods for a consideration of £97.50, i.e. 97.5% of the ticket price.\n\n6. DR contends that the arrangements produce exactly that effect. It is therefore chargeable to VAT on the £97.50; the balance of £2.50 goes to DCHS as an exempt card-handling fee. The Commissioners challenge that on four grounds:\n\n(i) The customer agrees to buy and DR agrees to sell the goods for the ticket price. There has been no contract for a supply of card-handling services between customer and DCHS that alters or affects the single contract between DR and the customer for the sale of the goods at the full ticket price. (We refer to this as “the contractual issue”. It is dealt with in paragraphs 94 – 141.)\n\n(ii) Even if there were a contract between DCHS and the customer, the commercial reality is that DCHS provides no card-handling services to the customer and the customer provides no consideration (in VAT terms) for such services. The reality determines the VAT consequences which are that DR should account for output tax on the full ticket price. (We refer to this as “the commercial reality issue”. This is dealt with in paragraphs 142 – 155.)\n\n(iii) Even if there were a contract between DCHS and the customer under which DCHS provided card-handling services, that supply forms part of a single supply by DR to the customer. It is subject to VAT at the same rate applicable for either of two reasons. First, it is said, the 2.5% payment to DCHS is included as a “charge” within the taxable amount for the goods or services supplied by DR by reason of Article 11A(2)(a) of the Sixth Directive. Secondly, it is argued that any service supplied by DCHS is ancillary or incidental to the main supply by DR and falls to be treated in the same way for VAT purposes. (We refer to this as “the single supply” issue. See paragraphs 156 and 157.)"
