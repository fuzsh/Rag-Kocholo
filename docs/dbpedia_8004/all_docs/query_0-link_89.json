        "text": "The playboy son of Boohoo's billionaire boss hailed his father's £55million takeover of Debenhams by revealing the family used to shop there every Saturday 'looking for cheap TVs'.\n\nBoohoo owner Mahmud Kamani today bought the Debenhams brand with plans to make it an online-only operation - putting up to 12,000 jobs at risk as he hopes to create the Amazon of fast-fashion.\n\nAll of the retailer's 124 stores will close for good, spelling the end of the brand on the high street after 242 years.\n\nMr Kamani's son Umar, himself the founder of fashion brand PrettyLittleThing, made a nod to the family's humble beginnings in Manchester by tweeting about the deal: 'Mad that we used to go into Debenhams every Saturday looking for cheap TV’s with my dad.'\n\nAged just 32, Umar's wealth has allowed him to buy a mansion, a fleet of cars, including two Rolls-Royce Phantoms, a £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador, a £92,000 customised G-Class Mercedes and a high-end Range Rover.\n\nAnd he has also been linked with some of the world's most beautiful women and friends with Hollywood.\n\nDebenhams has been sold for £55million but was valued at £1.7billion when it was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2006 and made a record £160million profit in 2013. Today its shares are worthless after recent annual losses approached £500million.\n\nIts purchase spells another step into the mainstream for fast-fashion giant Boohoo, owned by Mahmud Kamani, which had its reputation badly damaged following revelations that its suppliers used sweatshops in Leicester to produce cheap clothing during lockdown.\n\nDespite the scandal, revenues jumped 40 per cent to £660.8million and profits surged to £68.1million during the pandemic, Boohoo Group, which also owns the PrettyLittleThing website run by Mr Kamani's playboy son Umar, announced earlier this month.\n\nMr Kamani said today: 'Our acquisition of the Debenhams brand is strategically significant as it represents a huge step which accelerates our ambition to be a leader, not just in fashion eCommerce, but in new categories including beauty, sport and homeware.'\n\nThere is also a new battle of the British billionaires as three of the country's richest businessmen also went into battle for the remainder of Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail empire after it collapsed last year.\n\nMr Kamani, worth £1billion, is fighting with online rival ASOS, run by Scotland's richest man Anders Holch Povlsen, worth £6.1billion, for the purchase of the Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge brands in what would be one of the biggest shake-ups of the British retail landscape in decades. The Blackburn-born billionaire brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa, who made their £3.56billion from petrol stations and recently bought the supermarket chain Asda, have also been locked in secret talks to buy Topshop.\n\nBut this morning Mr Povlsen's ASOS said in a statement to shareholders: 'ASOS plc notes recent media speculation and confirms that it is in exclusive discussions with the Administrators of Arcadia over the acquisition of the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT'. But a spokesman said a deal is not inevitable.\n\nSome experts have suggested the £55million price tag for Debenhams is too high - and questioned whether the department store's concessions including Clinique and Lancome will want to be associated with Boohoo after the sweatshop scandal.\n\nLockdown has seen the Boohoo brands make tens of millions more in profit and they hope the Debenhams stable will take them to the next level. Mahmud Kamani wants to be the Amazon for fast-fashion, beauty and homeware.\n\nBut it is a world away from the humble beginnings for the Kamani family, who have been hailed as one of the UK's great 'rags to riches' tales. Mahmud started out selling handbags on a Manchester market stall after arriving from India via Kenya.\n\nPLT was founded by Mr Kamani's sons Adam and Umar in 2012 following the enormous success of their father's business and reported a turnover of £374million in 2018.\n\nBy 2022, the company is forecast to be worth around £2.1billion. The Boohoo Group bought a 34 per cent stake in PLT for £269.8 million in May.\n\nTatler named PLT co-founder Umar its eighth most eligible bachelor for 2019, alongside the Duke of Roxburghe and former One Direction star Harry Styles.\n\nHis lifestyle is decidedly jet-set, with his contacts book brimming with A-list stars such as Jennifer Lopez, rapper P Diddy and actor Denzel Washington.\n\nSuch is his self-belief that when he wanted to launch PLT in the US three years ago, he offered a six-figure sum to reality TV star Kylie Jenner, half-sister of Kim Kardashian, to appear in one of his £15 orange dresses.\n\nClive Black, retail analyst at Shore Capital, said the Debenhams deal - and the battle with Asos and the Issa brothers for the Arcadia brands - represented 'a volcano erupting' on British high streets. He said: 'We are seeing a massive reshaping of Britain's high streets all at once. The future of the high street is now up for grabs'. On Debenhams' concessions he added: 'It remains to be seen how they will mind being associated with a business connected to those kinds of labour processes'.\n\nIn a big hint that Boohoo intends to take on the might of Amazon, the business said it would create the UK's largest marketplace across fashion, beauty, sport and homeware - expanding the range of products sold via Debenhams marketplace by maintaining current third party relationships and expanding further.\n\nBoohoo has previously bought a number of well-known high street brands out of administration, turning them into online-only operations, including Oasis, Coast and Karen Millen.\n\nGreg Lawless, retail analyst at Shore Capital, said: 'The big question in beauty is whether the big beauty brands - Clinique and Chanel - will remain with Boohoo longer term.\n\n'The Debenhams number one position in premium beauty was predicated on counter sales, which will not form part of this acquisition.'\n\nIt came as a judge in the Insolvency and Companies court made an order winding up Debenhams.\n\nJudge Daniel Schaeffer made the order at a hearing on Monday after describing the company as a 'rudderless ship' and said the official receiver should assess the position.\n\nA spokeswoman for Debenhams stressed that the judge's decision to wind up the company would not affect the Boohoo deal.\n\nThe spokeswoman said the judge's winding up order and the Boohoo deal were 'separate' pieces of news.\n\nShe said the winding up order related to the 'old plc' and was not linked to the acquisition by Boohoo.\n\nThe purchase of the Debenhams brand by Boohoo ends more than two centuries on the British high street.\n\nThe brand started a liquidation process last month after failing to secure a last-minute rescue sale with JD Sports, putting 12,000 jobs at risk.\n\nEarlier this month, Boohoo said group revenues jumped 40 per cent to £660.8 million on the back of strong Christmas and Black Friday sales.\n\nAsos has had a good year after customers flocked to the trendy website via their mobile phones, leading to sales rising by 24pc to £1.36bn in the four months to December 31. In the UK, sales were up 36pc to £554.1m.\n\nThe company expects more of the same in 2021 and has ramped up profit expectations for the year ahead.\n\nMany in the City had expected Asos to take a hit during lockdown and over the festive season as Christmas is traditionally when young women buy cocktail dresses and strappy heels.\n\nInstead, the company nimbly changed its stock to focus on pyjamas and T-shirts, which have been in hot demand as customers are forced to stay at home.\n\nIn 2019 profits at Asos plunged by nearly 70% amid IT chaos at its overseas warehouses - but lockdown appears to have turned around their fortunes.\n\nToday's deal will see Debenhams products sold by Boohoo later this year, allowing enough time for liquidators to continue closing the retailer's sites once they are allowed to reopen after Covid-19 lockdown restrictions are lifted.\n\nBut with stores closing across the 242-year-old brand, it is unlikely many of the remaining 12,000 jobs are likely to be saved.\n\nAndy Brian, partner and head of retail at law firm Gordons: 'Boohoo's reported acquisition of the Debenhams brand and the news that ASOS appears to be a leading contender for Topshop bears out what I said last year – that brand acquisition by online retailers was always going to be the most likely outcome for many of the struggling high street fashion retailers.\n\n'For too long the likes of Arcadia and Debenhams have been waiting for their customer to come to them, while other players such as Asos, Boohoo and Missguided have followed the customer where they want to go. The trend towards online shopping started years ago but it has accelerated in the last 12 months due to the pandemic.\n\n'Ultimately, the cost of significant investment in updating back end systems and processes to drive efficiency and profitability was always going to be a barrier to keeping stores running. It's sad news for store workers, and for those shoppers who (in normal times) prefer that option, but the harsh reality is that both businesses simply haven't been able to attract as many of the latter as they needed.'\n\nSimon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm, Menzies LLP, said: 'Debenhams has been left with no place to turn and nothing worth selling except intangible assets.\n\n'The shift to ecommerce was happening well before the pandemic, but has accelerated significantly over the past year. It now seems unlikely that the High Street as we knew it will re-open any time soon, or ever. With plans in place for Debenhams to re-emerge in 2022, as an online-only retail brand, there can be no doubt where future trading opportunities lie.'\n\nDebenhams had already announced significant job losses and the permanent closure of six stores, including its flagship outlet on London's Oxford Street.\n\nBoohoo said the deal represents a 'fantastic opportunity' to target new customers and launch into the beauty, sports and homewares market for the first time.\n\nThe company highlighted how Debenhams has six million beauty shoppers and 1.4 million Beauty Club members.\n\nIt said: 'The group intends to rebuild and relaunch the Debenhams platform, helping further the group's stated ambition to lead the fashion eCommerce market, and grow into new categories including beauty, sport and homeware.'\n\nDebenhams' own fashion brands will also be absorbed into Boohoo's current portfolio and sold via the Debenhams website.\n\nBoohoo chief executive John Lyttle said: 'The acquisition of the Debenhams brand is an important development for the group, as we seek to capture incremental growth opportunities arising from the accelerating shift to online retail.'\n\nDebenhams' administrator, FRP Advisory, has been continuing to talk with third parties over the potential sales of all or parts of the historic retail business.\n\nBoohoo is also understood to be in the running to purchase Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge after they too were placed in administration in a brutal year for Britain's high streets.\n\nThe fast-fashion retailer - founded by Mahmud Kamani - was thrust into the spotlight this year following accusations its suppliers used sweatshop-style conditions in Leicester to produce cheap clothing during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWorkers in a Leicester factory packing clothes destined for Boohoo were being paid far below the minimum wage.\n\nUndercover reporters also found the factory operating during the city's localised lockdown without social distancing measures in place.\n\nThe scandal caused the firm's shares to plunge by £1.3 billion and prompted a wave of condemnation from politicians and members of the public.\n\nBut the company appears to have bounced back as wide-spread lockdown rules saw non-essential shops shut and shoppers rush to buy online.\n\nExperts have predicted that ASOS will win the race for Topshop.\n\nChloe Collins, Senior Apparel Analyst at GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company, said: 'ASOS would by far be the most complementary new owner for Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge. The brands are already popular sellers through its third-party platform, proving that there is strong customer overlap, and ASOS' impressive global reach would help the Arcadia brands target new shoppers. Though ASOS would not take on any stores, and it is unclear whether it would keep the brands' websites or simply use exclusivity to boost its own platform, the retailer's digital prowess will aid the brands in gaining top of mind appeal, as they have so far fell behind online competition.\n\n'The fact that ASOS is willing to buy three of Arcadia's brands should also give it an edge, as other interest has centred around the Topshop brand only'.\n\nDebenhams became one of the largest high street casualties at the end of last year after rescue talks with JD Sport fell through.\n\nThe chain had been in administration since April, but when any hopes of a rescue were dashed, it drew a line under 242 years of trading.\n\nIt followed a bruising year for the high street which saw Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group also collapse.\n\nArcadia, which owns Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Burton, tipped into administration, putting 13,000 jobs at risk.\n\nArcadia's concessions, including Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, were worth £75million-a-year in sales to Debenhams.\n\nThe collapse set off a domino effect, with JD Sports pulling out of talks to buy Debenhams.\n\nExperts called the collapse of the two giants at the end of last year one of the most 'devastating' weeks in the history of British retail.\n\nUp to 25,000 workers were put at risk of redundancy in the space of 12 hours.\n\nThe number of job losses was so large it equated to losing the entire labour force of the UK fishing industry overnight.\n\nIt came in addition to thousands of other job losses as a result of the pandemic, which has pushed businesses across all sectors to breaking point.\n\nPeacocks and Jaeger, which are owned by the Edinburgh Woolen Mill Group, fell into administration last month, putting 21,000 jobs at risk.\n\nLaura Ashley went bust in March while fashion giants Oasis and Warehouse fell into administration in April.\n\nIt comes amid concerns that Paperchase is on the brink of administration after Covid-19 restrictions placed 'unbearable strain' on the card and gift retailer's Christmas sales.\n\nThe stationery chain, which usually makes 40 per cent of its annual sales over November and December, was particularly hit by lockdown measures over the festive period.\n\nApproximately 1,500 jobs and 173 stores are on the line for the retailer, who appointed accountancy firm PwC to handle the administration process.\n\nIt was announced at the start of December that all Debenhams stores were to close for good after last-ditch attempts to save the retailer failed.\n\nGeoff Rowley, joint administrator for Debenhams and partner of FRP Advisory, said: \"We are pleased to have secured the future for this great brand, and to have created the opportunity for a new Debenhams-branded business to emerge in a different shape beyond the pandemic.\n\n\"I expect that the agreement with Boohoo may provide some job opportunities but we regret that this outcome does not safeguard the jobs of Debenhams' employees beyond the winding-down period.\"\n\nIt was today revealed that Asos has emerged as the frontrunner to buy Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge after they were placed in administration.\n\nThe online fashion retailer is keen to acquire the brands from the administrators of Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group - which also owns Dorothy Perkins and Burton.\n\nAsos is competing against rivals including Boohoo Group, U.S. retailer Authentic Brands Group, which is working with JD Sports Fashion Plc, and Chinese fashion group Shein, Sky News reported.\n\nHowever the company only wants to acquire the brands and not the stores - therefore casting speculation that a deal could put jobs at risk.\n\nThe company is currently in the lead to buy the Topshop brand for more than £250million, according to Sky.\n\nThe billionaire brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa, who recently bought the supermarket chain Asda, have also been locked in secret talks to buy Topshop.\n\nOn Thursday, Retailer Next Plc said it had pulled out of the bidding for Topshop and Topman after it was unable to meet the price expectations of the collapsed fashion chains.\n\nAdministrators at Deloitte, who were drafted in to find bidders for the businesses following a slump in sales, are expected to sell the brands by next month.\n\nLast year the Arcadia Group, which runs 444 stores in the UK and 22 overseas, was hammered by store closures amid the pandemic.\n\nThe administrators said they would 'asses all options available' but would continue to honour all online orders and operate all of its current sales channels.\n\nRetail bloodbath: How the pandemic changed Britain's High Street\n\nThe High Street has been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic as people were told to stay inside for several national lockdowns.\n\nHigh Street stalwarts such as Debenhams, WH Smith and Clarks did not escape the bloodbath.\n\nIn August 228-year-old business WH Smith said a dramatic fall in sales could force them to axe around 11 per cent of its workforce.\n\nIt was a grim announcement for an already hammered high street after hundreds of jobs were also cut at high street fashion chain M&Co.\n\nThe chain also announced the closure of 47 stores, taking the number of workers facing redundancy as a result of the Covid crisis above 100,000.\n\nWithin one week over the summer 651 roles were lost at Byron, 1,700 put at risk at DW Sports, 878 lost at Hays Travel and 1,100 put at risk at Pizza Express.\n\nJohn Lewis cut a further 1,500 jobs, adding to the 1,300 axed when it permanently shut eight stores in July.\n\nThe retail giant was widely seen as a benchmark for High Street performance in the UK.\n\nLloyds Bank also announced their decision to make 1,070 more staff redundant on top of the 865 earlier in the pandemic.\n\nWithin the same 24 hours Marks & Spencer also reported its first loss in its 94 years as a listed company. The company had already cut 8,000 staff since March.\n\nAnd Sainsbury’s also confirmed it would cut around 3,500 jobs across its Argos stores and supermarket meat, fish and deli counters, while Clarks shoes put the jobs of all 4,000 of its store staff on notice as part of its fight for survival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnline fashion giant Asos has confirmed it is in exclusive talks with administrators for Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail empire.\n\nThe company said the ongoing discussions are about snapping up Arcadia's brands including Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT, sold via Burtons.\n\nAsos said in a short statement to the London Stock Exchange: 'The board believes this would represent a compelling opportunity to acquire strong brands that resonate well with its customer base.\n\n'However, at this stage, there can be no certainty of a transaction and Asos will keep shareholders updated as appropriate. Any acquisition would be funded from cash reserves.'\n\nAsos does not have a high street presence, so any deal is unlikely to include saving the Arcadia stores, which could close for good, leaving the brands trading online only.\n\nLucy Powell MP, Labour's Shadow Minister for Business and Consumers, said: 'Seeing stores vanish from high streets across Britain will be a real blow to communities across our country, and it will be absolutely devastating for the 25,000 people who face losing their job.\n\n'The pandemic has accelerated changes to the way we shop, yet the government continues to disadvantage bricks and mortar businesses against online companies.\n\n'The support on offer for struggling businesses has been a series of sticking plasters. Unless the Government puts in place a long-term plan to help high street businesses survive this crisis and recover on the other side, we will see more well-loved high street names vanishing, and many more jobs lost.'\n\nRetail trade union Usdaw said it would seek an urgent meeting with Arcadia's administrators in an attempt to save jobs and ensure staff were treated fairly as Sir Philip's retail empire went bust.\n\nBusiness secretary Alok Sharma also said he would keep a 'very close eye' on the administrators' report on director conduct, and pledged the Government would support the affected workers.\n\nIn a statement, Arcadia chief executive Ian Grabiner said at the time: 'In the face of the most difficult trading conditions we have ever experienced, the obstacles we encountered were far too severe.'\n\nHe added: 'This is an incredibly sad day for all of our colleagues as well as our suppliers and our many other stakeholders.\n\n'Our stores will remain open or reopen when permitted under the Government Covid-19 restrictions, our online platforms will be fully operational and supplies to all of our partners will continue.'\n\nMeanwhile Matt Smith, joint administrator at Deloitte, said: 'We will now work with the existing management team and broader stakeholders to assess all options available for the future of the group's businesses.\n\n'It is our intention to continue to trade all of the brands and we look forward to welcoming customers back into stores when many of them are allowed to reopen.\n\n'We will be rapidly seeking expressions of interest and expect to identify one or more buyers to ensure the future success of the businesses.'\n\nEarlier this month, Asos announced it would invest £90million in a new centre after annual profits quadrupled last year.\n\nThe retailer plans to open the centre in Lichfield, Staffordshire, within 12 months and will employ 2,000 people at the site over the next three years.\n\nThe 437,000 square feet, AEW and Allianz Real Estate joint venture warehouse at Fradley Park will open within 12 months and will be fully operational by 2023, Asos said in a statement.\n\nFollowing its supply chain scandal last year, Mr Kamani, founder and group executive chairman of Boohoo, commissioned a report which was carried out by Alison Levitt QC.\n\nThe report found the firm had not intentionally profited from poor working conditions and low pay, and had committed no criminal offences - but it did identify 'many failings' and concluded Boohoo had not taken sufficient responsibility for those involved in producing its clothes.\n\nBoohoo said 64 companies have been removed from its UK supplier list as a result.\n\nMr Kamani appointed Sir Brian Leveson, who chaired the public inquiry into the culture and practices of the press, to oversee Boohoo's so-called 'Agenda for Change' with the accountants KPMG tasked with independently tracking its progress.\n\nIt has since published its first independent report by Sir Brian, which says Boohoo is making 'excellent progress' to put in pace Ms Levitt's recommendations.\n\nThe rise and fall of Debenhams: From modest female outfitters to star-studded fashion launches with Kim Kardashian and Gemma Atkinson... how 242-year-old retail chain met its demise in 2020\n\nDebenhams has been a mainstay on UK high streets for 242 years, but is now set to shut its doors for good.\n\nIn 1778 William Clark opened a drapers store on 44 Wigmore Street in central London, selling expensive fabrics, bonnets, gloves and parasols.\n\nThe business had a modest start in life, with Mr Clark continuing to run the single store until meeting a potential investor.\n\nWilliam Debenham formed a partnership with the store owner in 1813, pumping funds into the business which then became Clark & Debenham.\n\nFive years later it opened its first store outside the capital, in Cheltenham, and started to dramatically expand.\n\nWhen Clement Freebody invested in the firm in 1851 it was renamed Debenham & Freebody, and continued to grow by snapping up smaller rivals and expanding its wholesale operations.\n\nAcquisitions continued into the next century and in 1905 Debenhams Ltd was formed.\n\nAfter the First World War ended, the retailer merged with Marshall & Snellgrove, and in 1920 purchased Knightsbridge retailer Harvey Nichols.\n\nSeven years later the Debenham family exited the business as it was listed on the London Stock exchange.\n\nBy 1950, Debenhams was the largest department store group in the UK, owning 84 companies and 110 stores.\n\nIn 1985 Debenhams merged to become part of Burton Group, which soon rebranded as Arcadia, before splitting away 13 years later after a period of rapid store expansion and the launch of its first international franchise sites.\n\nFollowing demerger from the Burton Group, Debenhams was listed on the London Stock Exchange until 2003, when it was acquired by Baroness Retail.\n\nBaroness, backed by private equity firms CVC Capital Partners and Texas Pacific Group, started to strip the company's assets, including a £450 million sale and leaseback of 26 properties and internal cost-cutting.\n\nThree years later, Baroness almost tripled its value as it was floated on the stock market, but the retail group was now weighed down by a portfolio hamstrung with expensive rental agreements.\n\nNevertheless, Debenhams continued to grow, acquiring nine stores from Roches in the Republic of Ireland in 2007 and Magasin du Nord, the leading department store chain in Denmark, two years after.\n\nThe company also had a partnerships with Michelle Mone's Ultimo bra company in the 2000s, which led to a series of photoshoots with glamour models inside its stores.\n\nIn 2014, after a decline in company profits, retail tycoon Mike Ashley bought 4.6 per cent of the company's shares.\n\nHe steadily increased his ownership of the department store business, expanding it to 29.7 per cent by 2018.\n\nHowever, the business had now felt the full effect of difficult high street conditions and sky-high rents, resulting in a £491 million pre-tax loss in 2018.\n\nBy April of 2019, the retail giant entered administration and delisted from the stock market.\n\nIt undertook a major restructuring, designed to restore it to its former glory, but now appears likely to disappear for good after Christmas, after entering liquidation.\n\nNow, Debenhams is to start a liquidation process after JD Sports confirmed it had pulled out of a possible rescue deal, putting 12,000 workers at risk.\n\nThe 242-year-old department store chain said its administrators have 'regretfully' decided to start winding down operations while continuing to seek offers 'for all or parts of the business'.\n\nIt is understood that the collapse of rescue talks were partly linked to the administration of Arcadia Group, which is the biggest operator of concessions in Debenhams stores.\n\nDebenhams said it will continue to trade through its 124 UK stores and online to clear its current and contracted stocks.\n\n'On conclusion of this process, if no alternative offers have been received, the UK operations will close,' the company said in statement.\n\nDebenhams has already axed 6,500 jobs across its operation due to heavy cost-cutting after it entered administration for the second time in 12 months.\n\nArcadia tumbled into insolvency on Monday evening, casting a shadow over its own 13,000 workers and 444 stores."
