        "text": "If this early reaction is any indication, “Horizon: An American Saga” will be a hit.\n\nKevin Costner appeared moved to tears as he received a seven-minute standing ovation for his upcoming Western epic at the Cannes Film Festival on May 19, according to Variety. Clad in a tuxedo, the Oscar winner had tears in his eyes amid the applause, with some in the crowd chanting his name.\n\nCostner, who wrote, directed, produced and stars in the movie, then spoke to the audience, promising he would release \"three more\" films in the \"Horizon\" series, after the first two come out this summer.\n\n“I’m sorry you had to clap that long for me to understand that I should speak,” Costner joked, according to Variety.\n\n“Such good people. Such a good moment, not just for me, but for the actors that came with me, for people who believed in me who continued to work. It’s a funny business, and I’m so glad I found it. There’s no place like here. I’ll never forget this — either will my children.”\n\nThe latest trailer for “Horizon: An American Saga” came out May 17, exclusively on TODAY.\n\nThe trailer begins with a man saying how dangerous the West can be before he and Costner draw guns and shoot. Costner then mulls over heading for an area known as Horizon.\n\n“A place where I might be able to see myself,” he says.\n\nThe trailer then shows the perils of settling, along with plenty of action and what looks to be a dose of romance.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Costner's upcoming Western film.\n\nWhat is 'Horizon: An American Saga' about?\n\nThe film is set during the Civil War and follows Costner's character Hayes Ellison as he ventures over to a new land called Horizon — and all that he encounters along the way.\n\n“‘Horizon: An American Saga’ explores the lure of the Old West and how it was won — and lost — through the blood, sweat and tears of many,” reads a press release about the movie.\n\n“Spanning the four years of the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865, Costner’s ambitious cinematic adventure will take audiences on an emotional journey across a country at war with itself, experienced through the lens of families, friends and foes all attempting to discover what it truly means to be the United States of America.”\n\nWho stars in ‘Horizon: An American Saga’?\n\nIn addition to Costner, Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Giovanni Ribisi, Abbey Lee, Will Patton, Jena Malone, Michael Rooker, Danny Huston, Luke Wilson and Jeff Fahey also star in the movie, which Costner co-wrote and directed.\n\nThe movie marks Costner's first time helming a film since the Western “Open Range” in 2003.\n\nWhen is 'Horizon: An American Saga' being released?\n\n“Horizon: An American Saga” will be released in two parts, with the first coming out June 28, and the second one hitting theaters Aug. 16.\n\nWhere do things stand with Kevin Costner and 'Yellowstone'?\n\n“Horizon” comes as Costner’s future on the Paramount Network drama \"Yellowstone\" has been thrown into doubt.\n\nIn February 2023, reports stated that Costner had scheduling conflicts when filming \"Yellowstone\" and that he only gave a week of availability to film the second part of Season Five.\n\nThe Oscar winner, who has played John Dutton since the show premiered in 2018, shared in May 2024 that he has always focused on the hit series.\n\n“But if you know me well enough, I made ‘Yellowstone’ the first priority, and to insinuate anything else would be wrong,” he told Deadline earlier this week.\n\nCostner said he had a contract for a fifth, sixth and seventh season of “Yellowstone,” and after negotiating for two to three months, the contract became one for season 5A and 5B. He also explained that he was putting the \"Yellowstone\" schedule first and squeezing in his film when he could, but it became complicated when timing continually shifted.\n\n“I left my movie to be on time for them for 5B. I left exactly when they wanted, and it made it hard on me. It turns out they didn’t have the scripts for 5B,” he said.\n\nNBC News had previously reached out to Paramount Network for comment but didn't hear back."
