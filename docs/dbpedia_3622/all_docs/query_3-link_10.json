No other products may be used on either the face, head or body.\n\nThe Commission shall determine whether the head or facial hair presents any hazard to the safety of the unarmed combatant or his opponent or will interfere with the supervision and conduct of the contest or exhibition. If the head or facial hair of an unarmed combatant presents such a hazard or will interfere with the supervision and conduct of the contest or exhibition, the unarmed combatant may not compete in the contest or exhibition unless the circumstances creating the hazard or potential interference are corrected to the satisfaction of the Commission.\n\nAn unarmed combatant may not wear any makeup, face or body-paint, jewelry or other piercing accessories while competing in the contest or exhibition.\n\nContestants must have short fingernails and must not wear metallic or other objects which might injure their opponent.\n\nKarate Combat weight divisions\n\nKARATE COMBAT events feature single-match contests between well-matched, skilled karate fighters in the same weight division.\n\nDIVISION WEIGHT ALLOWABLE WEIGHT SPREAD\n\nWomen's Strawweight (115 LB / 52.2KG) Determined by the presiding commission\n\nWomen's Flyweight (125 LB / 56.7 KG) Determined by the presiding commission\n\nWomen's Bantamweight (135 LB / 61.2 KG) Determined by the presiding commission\n\nWomen's Lightweight (150 LB / 68 KG) Determined by the presiding commission\n\nMen’s Bantamweight (135 LB / 61 KG) Determined by the presiding commission\n\nMen’s Lightweight (150 LB / 68 KG) Determined by the presiding commission\n\nMen’s Welterweight (165 LB / 75 KG) Determined by the presiding commission\n\nMen’s Middleweight (185 LB / 84 KG) Determined by the presiding commission\n\nMen’s Heavyweight (205 LB / 93 KG) Determined by the presiding commission\n\nMen’s Super-Heavyweight (over 205 LB / over 93 KG) Determined by the presiding commission\n\nKarate Combat bouts may also be contracted at a Catchweight with the permission of the presiding commission.\n\nGeneral Bout Description\n\nEach non-title Karate Combat contest shall be 3 rounds. Each round shall be 3 minutes in duration, with a rest period of 1 minute between each round. Title/Championship fights are 5 rounds.\n\nPreceding the bell to begin each bout the referee will instruct each fighter to perform a traditional karate bow to their opponent with the following commands: Yoi (ready), Otega-ni Rei (bow to each other).\n\nDuring the fighting action when one fighter becomes grounded* the ground and pound will be allowed to continue as long as the strikes are effective. If a grounded fighter is able to wrap up, kick the opponent off or get back up, the ref will pause the fight and stand the fighters up. So as long as punches continue to land, the fighter will be allowed to ground and pound.\n\n*The definition of a grounded fighter is determined by the regulatory jurisdiction if it differs in any way from the definition provided below: A fighter is considered grounded when any part of the body other than the soles of their feet are touching the fighting area floor\n\nNote that the Pit Wall is NOT considered the ground. In reference to the pit wall, a fighter shall only be considered grounded if he is directly facing the wall and has both hands on it. In this scenario the referee will indicate the start of the countdown.\n\nWhen a fighter is attacking his downed opponent, he may do so only with hand strikes and he must maintain an upright and controlled position while attacking. When one of the fighters considered grounded ridge-hand strikes are not allowed. The “top” fighter may place a single knee on his downed opponent body or besides his downed, but once a second knee goes (and stays) down, or both fighters are considered grounded, the referee will stop the action, stand the fighters and immediately restart the action from that same position in the pit.\n\nDuring the rest period between rounds, the fighters licensed second and cutman will enter the pit to address the fighters’ needs under the supervision of a commission inspector.\n\nWhenever a fighter is injured by a foul that causes time to be stopped or is finished by KO or TKO, the uninjured opponent shall assume the traditional kneeling position (seiza) on the opposite side of the pit until the opponent has recovered or the referee indicates that the uninjured fighter should rise.\n\nA fighter may submit to his opponent by either tapping their hand continuously on any area of the pit, placing one knee on the ground and one hand above their head or by verbally submitting to the referee. A fighter’s chief second may concede the match by a method determined by the presiding commission.\n\nStopping Contest\n\nThe referee and/or the ringside physician (as determined by the presiding commission) are the only individuals authorized to stop a contest.\n\nThe fighter’s Chief Second may concede the match by a method determined by the presiding commission.\n\nThe fighter is permitted to concede the match to their opponent at any time during the bout by the following methods:\n\nTapping their hand continuously on any area of the PIT\n\nPlacing one knee on the ground and one hand above the head iii) Verbally submitting to the referee\n\nJudging/Scoring\n\nAll bouts will be evaluated and scored by 3 judges who shall evaluate the contest from different locations around the PIT fighting area. The referee may not be one of the 3 judges.\n\nJudges shall evaluate the round score on effective striking, effective takedowns, control of the PIT fighting area, and effective aggressiveness.\n\nEffective striking is evaluated by determining the total number of impactful legal strikes landed by a contestant\n\nEffective takedowns are evaluated by considering the number of successful executions of a legal takedown followed by efforts to finish the fight.\n\nFighting area control is judged by determining who is dictating the pace, location and position of the bout.\n\nEffective aggressiveness means moving forward and landing a legal strike.\n\nA 10-point must system will be used during the bout based on effective fighting according to the criteria listed above. Karate Combat prioritizes productive aggressiveness so the fighter who gets results based on attacking should be favored over a fighter who counters if the results of the fighting action are similar.\n\nLegal Techniques\n\nLEGAL TECHNIQUES while standing:\n\nAll punching and hand striking techniques executed with the closed fist directed to the front and sides of the head, and the torso above the beltline. Ridge-hand strikes are also legal.\n\nAll kicking techniques delivered to the frontline and side of the head, and torso above the beltline.

To issue an official warning the referee will separate the fighters and speak directly to the athlete that is being warned.\n\nTo issue an official warning the referee should separate the fighters and speak directly to the athlete that he/she is warning.\n\nIf a point or points are to be deducted the referee should stop time and send the non-offending fighter to the opposite side of the pit.

If the sudden victory round is scored a draw then the official result will be a draw.\n\nLicensed Seconds\n\nThe presiding commission will determine the number of seconds that will be licensed.The chief second and cutman may/will enter the pit during the rest period between each round to address the needs of the fighter.\n\nOverruling, Unwritten Rules and Commission Jurisdiction\n\nThe above rules for Karate Combat will always be subordinate, and consequently may be revoked or modified depending on the applicable laws and/or ethical standards of the country and/or state where the event is organized, occurring under the supervision of an Athletic Commission, Sanctioning Organization or other approved Regulatory Body. The authority to resolve any circumstances not specifically addressed in this document will be the domain of the presiding commission in consultation with the sanction organization and Karate Combat rules director.\n\nThe Dangers of Cutting Weight and Dehydrating\n\n(based on the Association of Ringside Physicians)\n\nUnhealthy and dangerous weight loss practices continue to be a serious problem in combat sports. It has been shown that excessive weight loss, rapid weight loss, and repeated cycling of weight gain/loss causes decreased performance, hormonal imbalance, decreased nutrition and increased injury risk. Other life-threatening problems associated with improper weight loss and dehydration include:\n\nDecreased Muscle Strength and Endurance: Decreased blood flow to muscles makes them work less well.\n\nDecreased Heart and Cardiovascular Function: The heart works harder and less efficiently.\n\nReduced Energy Utilization, Nutrient Exchange and Acidosis: With decreased blood flow to tissues, nutrients don’t get delivered, and the body’s waste products do not get removed as well. A buildup of acid occurs which changes cells’ functions in the body.\n\nHeat Illness: This takes on four forms: heat cramps, heat syncope (loss of consciousness), heat exhaustion, and heat stroke (which may be fatal). Dehydration results in decreased blood flow to the skin and muscles. This is followed by decreased ability to regulate body temperature. The ability to sweat becomes impaired and core body temperature can rise. This increases the threat of all of these to poorly hydrated athletes doing strenuous workouts.\n\nDecreased Kidney Function: Dehydration leads to decreased kidney blood flow and decreased kidney function. This contributes to the problems listed in the points here, in addition to decreased urine output, concentrated urine, and leakage of protein into the urine. (It is not known if these changes can result in permanent kidney damage.)\n\nElectrolyte Problems: Decreased kidney function results in imbalances of electrolytes such as unhealthy increases in potassium and sodium.\n\nMood Swings and Mental Changes: All of the above contribute to increased mood swings, poor concentration and focus, disorientation and other mental changes.\n\nDo not:\n\nDon’t use dehydration as a mainstay of making weight. In addition to the above, it puts you at risk of improper rehydration techniques — when, in reality, proper rehydration takes several hours to days. (Many cases of intravenous fluids being used for rehydration after weigh-ins have been reported – this is a doping violation with several organizations.)\n\nDo:\n\nBy maintaining your weight year-round near an appropriate competition weight and not competing in a weight class outside your appropriate weight class you will help avoid large swings in weight\n\nMaintain a good state of hydration by drinking fluid throughout the day and staying hydrated during workouts.\n\nFollow nutritional programs that meet your needs for adequate amounts of calories from a balanced diet high in healthy carbohydrates, the minimum requirement of fat, and appropriate amounts of protein."
