Customer shall, in its use of the Services, at all times process Personal Data, and provide instructions for the processing of Personal Data, in compliance with Data Protection Laws. Customer shall ensure that the processing of Personal Data in accordance with Customer’s instructions will not cause Company to be in breach of the Data Protection Laws. Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of (i) the Personal Data provided to Company by or on behalf of Customer, (ii) the means by which Customer acquired any such Personal Data, and (iii) the instructions it provides to Company regarding the processing of such Personal Data. Customer shall not provide or make available to Company any Personal Data in violation of the Agreement or otherwise inappropriate for the nature of the Services, and shall indemnify Company from all claims and losses in connection therewith.\n\n2.2 Company shall not process Personal Data (i) for purposes other than those set forth in the Agreement and/or Exhibit A, (ii) in a manner inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in this Addendum or any other documented instructions provided by Customer, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by Supervisory Authority to which the Company is subject; in such a case, the Company shall inform the Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest, or (iii) in violation of Data Protection Laws. Customer hereby instructs Company to process Personal Data in accordance with the foregoing and as part of any processing initiated by Customer in its use of the Services.\n\n2.3 The subject matter, nature, purpose, and duration of this processing, as well as the types of Personal Data collected and categories of Data Subjects, are described in Exhibit A to this Addendum.\n\n2.4 Following completion of the Services, at Customer’s choice, Company shall return or delete Customer’s Personal Data, unless further storage of such Personal Data is required or authorized by applicable law. If return or destruction is impracticable or prohibited by law, rule or regulation, Company shall take measures to block such Personal Data from any further processing (except to the extent necessary for its continued hosting or processing required by law, rule or regulation) and shall continue to appropriately protect the Personal Data remaining in its possession, custody, or control. If Customer and Company have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 6 (Transfers of Personal Data), the parties agree that the certification of deletion of Personal Data that is described in Clause 12(1) of the UK SCCs and Clause 8.1(d) and Clause 8.5 of the EU SCCs (as applicable) shall be provided by Company to Customer only upon Customer’s request.\n\n2.5 CCPA. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the processing of personal information or personal data that is subject to the CCPA shall be carried out in accordance with the terms set forth in Exhibit E.\n\n3. Confidentiality\n\n3.1 Company shall ensure that any person it authorizes to process Personal Data has agreed to protect Personal Data in accordance with Company’s confidentiality obligations in the Agreement. Customer agrees that Company may disclose Personal Data to its advisers, auditors or other third parties as reasonably required in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Addendum, the Agreement, or the provision of Services to Customer.\n\n4. Authorized Sub-Processors\n\n4.1 Customer acknowledges and agrees that Company may (1) engage its affiliates and the Authorized Sub- Processors to access and process Personal Data in connection with the Services and (2) from time to time engage additional third parties for the purpose of providing the Services, including without limitation the processing of Personal Data. By way of this Addendum, Customer provides general written authorization to Company to engage sub-processors as necessary to perform the Services.\n\n4.2 A list of Company’s current Authorized Sub-Processors (the “List”) is available at https://karat.com/authorized-subcontractors. Such List may be updated by Company from time to time. Customer shall subscribe to notifications of any additions to the List via https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Z5wh8WFOR8g6OyFMiZsTBArzXU80ceHi1bTD1oQxMJg. At least ten (10) days before enabling any third party other than existing Authorized Sub-Processors to access or participate in the processing of Personal Data, Company will add such third party to the List and notify Customer via email. Customer may object to such an engagement by informing Company within ten (10) days of receipt of the aforementioned notice by Customer, provided such objection is in writing and based on reasonable grounds relating to data protection. Customer acknowledges that certain sub-processors are essential to providing the Services and that objecting to the use of a sub-processor may prevent Company from offering the Services to Customer.\n\n4.3 If Customer reasonably objects to an engagement in accordance with Section 4.2, and Company cannot provide a commercially reasonable alternative within a reasonable period of time, Customer may discontinue the use of the affected Service by providing written notice to Company. Discontinuation shall not relieve Customer of any fees owed to Company under the Agreement.\n\n4.4 If Customer does not object to the engagement of a third party in accordance with Section 4.2 within ten (10) days of notice by Company, that third party will be deemed an Authorized Sub-Processor for the purposes of this Addendum.\n\n4.5 Company will enter into a written agreement with the Authorized Sub-Processor imposing on the Authorized Sub-Processor data protection obligations comparable to those imposed on Company under this Addendum with respect to the protection of Personal Data. In case an Authorized Sub-Processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations under such written agreement with Company, Company will remain liable to Customer for the performance of the Authorized Sub-Processor’s obligations under such agreement.\n\n4.6 If Customer and Company have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 6 (Transfers of Personal Data), (i) the above authorizations will constitute Customer’s prior written consent to the subcontracting by Company of the processing of Personal Data if such consent is required under the Standard Contractual Clauses, and (ii) the parties agree that the copies of the agreements with Authorized Sub-Processors that must be provided by Company to Customer pursuant to Clause 5(j) of the UK SCCs or Clause 9(c) of the EU SCCs may have commercial information, or information unrelated to the Standard Contractual Clauses or their equivalent, removed by the Company beforehand, and that such copies will be provided by the Company only upon request by Customer.\n\n5. Security of Personal Data.\n\n5.1 Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Company shall maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing Personal Data. Exhibit C sets forth additional information about Company’s technical and organizational security measures.\n\n6. Transfers of Personal Data\n\n6.1 The parties agree that Company may transfer Personal Data processed under this Addendum outside the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland as necessary to provide the Services. Customer acknowledges that Company’s primary processing operations take place in the United States, and that the transfer of Customer’s Personal Data to the United States is necessary for the provision of the Services to Customer. If Company transfers Personal Data protected under this Addendum to a jurisdiction for which the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision, Company will ensure that appropriate safeguards have been implemented for the transfer of Personal Data in accordance with Data Protection Laws.\n\n6.2 Ex-EEA Transfers. The parties agree that ex-EEA Transfers are made pursuant to the EU SCCs, which are deemed entered into (and incorporated into this Addendum by this reference) and completed as follows:\n\n6.2.1 Module Two (Controller to Processor) of the EU SCCs apply when Customer is a controller and Company is processing Personal Data for Customer as a processor pursuant to Section 2 of this Addendum.\n\n6.2.2 Module Three (Processor to Processor) of the EU SCCs apply when Customer is a processor and Company is processing Personal Data on behalf of Customer as a sub-processor.\n\n6.3 For each module, where applicable the following applies:\n\n6.3.1 In Clause 9, Option 2 (general written authorization) applies, and the minimum time period for prior notice of sub-processor changes shall be as set forth in Section 4.2 of this Addendum;\n\n6.3.2 In Clause 11, the optional language does not apply;\n\n6.3.3 All square brackets in Clause 13 are hereby removed;\n\n6.3.4 In Clause 17 (Option 1), the EU SCCs will be governed by Irish law;\n\n6.3.5 In Clause 18(b), disputes will be resolved before the courts of Ireland;\n\n6.3.6 Exhibit B to this Addendum contains the information required in Annex I and III of the EU SCCs;\n\n6.3.7 Exhibit C to this Addendum contains the information required in Annex II of the EU SCCs; and\n\n6.3.8 By entering into this Addendum, the parties are deemed to have signed the EU SCCs incorporated herein, including their Annexes.\n\n6.4 Ex-UK Transfers. The parties agree that ex-UK Transfers are made pursuant to the UK SCCs, which are deemed entered into and incorporated into this Addendum by reference, and amended and completed in accordance with the UK Addendum, which is incorporated herein as Exhibit E of this Addendum.\n\n6.5 Transfers from Switzerland. The parties agree that transfers from Switzerland are made pursuant to the EU SCCs with the following modifications:\n\n6.5.1 The terms “General Data Protection Regulation” or “Regulation (EU) 2016/679” as utilized in the EU SCCs shall be interpreted to include the Federal Act on Data Protection of 19 June 1992 (the “FADP,” and as revised as of 25 September 2020, the “Revised FADP”) with respect to data transfers subject to the FADP.\n\n6.5.2 The terms of the EU SCCs shall be interpreted to protect the data of legal entities until the effective date of the Revised FADP.\n\n6.5.3 Clause 13 of the EU SCCs is modified to provide that the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (“FDPIC”) of Switzerland shall have authority over data transfers governed by the FADP and the appropriate EU supervisory authority shall have authority over data transfers governed by the GDPR. Subject to the foregoing, all other requirements of Clause 13 shall be observed.\n\n6.5.4 The term “EU Member State” as utilized in the EU SCCs shall not be interpreted in such a way as to exclude Data Subjects in Switzerland from exercising their rights in their place of habitual residence in accordance with Clause 18(c) of the EU SCCs.\n\n6.6 Supplementary Measures. In respect of any ex-EEA Transfer or ex-UK Transfer, the following supplementary measures shall apply:\n\n6.6.1 As of the date of this Addendum, the Data Importer has not received any formal legal requests from any government intelligence or security service/agencies in the country to which the Personal Data is being exported, for access to (or for copies of) Customer’s Personal Data (“Government Agency Requests”) ;\n\n6.6.2 If, after the date of this Addendum, the Data Importer receives any Government Agency Requests, Company shall attempt to redirect the law enforcement or government agency to request that data directly from Customer. As part of this effort, Company may provide Customer’s basic contact information to the government agency. If compelled to disclose Customer’s Personal Data to a law enforcement or government agency, Company shall give Customer reasonable notice of the demand and cooperate to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy unless Company is legally prohibited from doing so. Company shall not voluntarily disclose Personal Data to any law enforcement or government agency. Data Exporter and Data Importer shall (as soon as reasonably practicable) discuss and determine whether all or any transfers of Personal Data pursuant to this Addendum should be suspended in the light of the such Government Agency Requests; and\n\n6.6.3 The Data Exporter and Data Importer will meet regularly to consider whether:\n\n(i) the protection afforded by the laws of the country of the Data Importer to data subjects whose Personal Data is being transferred is sufficient to provide broadly equivalent protection to that afforded in the EEA or the UK, whichever the case may be;\n\n(ii) additional measures are reasonably necessary to enable the transfer to be compliant with the Data Protection Laws; and\n\n(iii) it is still appropriate for Personal Data to be transferred to the relevant Data Importer, taking into account all relevant information available to the parties, together with guidance provided by the supervisory authorities.\n\n6.6.4 If Data Protection Laws require the Data Exporter to execute the Standard Contractual Clauses applicable to a particular transfer of Personal Data to a Data Importer as a separate agreement, the Data Importer shall, on request of the Data Exporter, promptly execute such Standard Contractual Clauses incorporating such amendments as may reasonably be required by the Data Exporter to reflect the applicable appendices and annexes, the details of the transfer and the requirements of the relevant Data Protection Laws.\n\n6.6.5 If either (i) any of the means of legitimizing transfers of Personal Data outside of the EEA or UK set forth in this Addendum cease to be valid or (ii) any supervisory authority requires transfers of Personal Data pursuant to those means to be suspended, then Data Importer may by notice to the Data Exporter, with effect from the date set out in such notice, amend or put in place alternative arrangements in respect of such transfers, as required by Data Protection Laws.\n\n7. Rights of Data Subjects\n\n7.1 Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, notify Customer upon receipt of a request by a Data Subject to exercise the following rights with respect to Personal Data: access, rectification, erasure, data portability, restriction or cessation of processing, withdrawal of consent to processing, and/or objections to being subject to processing that constitutes automated decision-making (such requests individually and collectively “Data Subject Request(s)”). If Company receives a Data Subject Request in relation to Customer’s data, Company will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to Customer and Customer will be responsible for responding to such request, including, where necessary, by using the functionality of the Services. Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that Data Subject Requests for erasure, restriction or cessation of processing, or withdrawal of consent to processing of any Personal Data are communicated to Company, and, if applicable, for ensuring that a record of consent to processing is maintained with respect to each Data Subject.\n\n7.2 Company shall, at the request of the Customer, and taking into account the nature of the processing applicable to any Data Subject Request, apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to assist Customer in complying with Customer’s obligation to respond to such Data Subject Request and/or in demonstrating such compliance, where possible, provided that (i) Customer is itself unable to respond without Company’s assistance and (ii) Company is able to do so in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Customer shall be responsible to the extent legally permitted for any costs and expenses arising from any such assistance by Company.\n\n8. Actions and Access Requests; Audits\n\n8.1 Company shall, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Company, provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance where necessary for Customer to comply with its obligations under the GDPR to conduct a data protection impact assessment and/or to demonstrate such compliance, provided that Customer does not otherwise have access to the relevant information. Customer shall be responsible to the extent legally permitted for any costs and expenses arising from any such assistance by Company\n\n8.2 Company shall, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Company, provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance with respect to Customer’s cooperation and/or prior consultation with any Supervisory Authority, where necessary and where required by the GDPR. Customer shall be responsible to the extent legally permitted for any costs and expenses arising from any such assistance by Company.\n\n8.3 Company shall maintain records sufficient to demonstrate its compliance with its obligations under this Addendum, and retain such records for a period of three (3) years after the termination of the Agreement. Customer shall, with reasonable notice to Company, have the right to review, audit and copy such records at Company’s offices during regular business hours.\n\n8.4 Upon Customer’s written request at reasonable intervals, and subject to reasonable confidentiality controls, Company shall, either (i) make available for Customer’s review copies of certifications or reports demonstrating Company’s compliance with prevailing data security standards applicable to the processing of Customer’s Personal Data, or (ii) if the provision of reports or certifications pursuant to (i) is not reasonably sufficient under Data Protection Laws, allow Customer’s independent third party representative to conduct an audit or inspection of Company’s data security infrastructure and procedures that is sufficient to demonstrate Company’s compliance with its obligations under Data Protection Laws, provided that (a) Customer provides reasonable prior written notice of any such request for an audit and such inspection shall not be unreasonably disruptive to Company’s business; (b) such audit shall only be performed during business hours and occur no more than once per calendar year; and (c) such audit shall be restricted to data relevant to Customer. Customer shall be responsible for the costs of any such audits or inspections, including without limitation a reimbursement to Company for any time expended for on-site audits. If Customer and Company have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 6 (Transfers of Personal Data), the parties agree that the audits described in Clause 5(f) and Clause 12(2) of the UK SCCs and Clause 8.9 of the EU SCCs shall be carried out in accordance with this Section 8.4.\n\n8.5 Company shall immediately notify Customer if an instruction, in the Company’s opinion, infringes the Data Protection Laws or Supervisory Authority.\n\n8.6 In the event of a Personal Data Breach, Company shall, without undue delay, inform Customer of the Personal Data Breach and take such steps as Company in its sole discretion deems necessary and reasonable to remediate such violation (to the extent that remediation is within Company’s reasonable control).\n\n8.7 In the event of a Personal Data Breach, Company shall, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Company, provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance necessary for Customer to comply with its obligations under the GDPR with respect to notifying (i) the relevant Supervisory Authority and (ii) Data Subjects affected by such Personal Data Breach without undue delay.\n\n8.8 The obligations described in Sections 8.6 and 8.7 shall not apply in the event that a Personal Data Breach results from the actions or omissions of Customer. Company’s obligation to report or respond to a Personal Data Breach under Sections 8.6 and 8.7 will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Company of any fault or liability with respect to the Personal Data Breach.\n\n9. Conflict.\n\n9.1 In the event of any conflict or inconsistency among the following documents, the order of precedence will be: (1) the applicable terms in the Standard Contractual Clauses; (2) the terms of this Addendum; and (3) the Agreement.

Entering into this UK Addendum will have the same effect as signing the Approved EU SCCs and any part of the Approved EU SCCs.\n\nInterpretation of this UK Addendum\n\n3. Where this UK Addendum uses terms that are defined in the Approved EU SCCs those terms shall have the same meaning as in the Approved EU SCCs.

If the provisions included in the UK Addendum amend the Approved EU SCCs in any way which is not permitted under the Approved EU SCCs or the Approved UK Addendum, such amendment(s) will not be incorporated in the UK Addendum and the equivalent provision of the Approved EU SCCs will take their place.\n\n6.
