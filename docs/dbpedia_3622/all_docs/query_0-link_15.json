        "text": "SUSTAINABILITY PURPOSE\n\nVerlas was created by a tight-knit female duo of diamond experts who bring out the perfection in one another. After dedicating several years to the diamond jewellery industry, founders Nidhi Dangayach and Nityani Riziya joined forces to create a seamless digital experience for designer-quality classics. Verlas offers quality diamond jewellery you can feel good about. They only use ethically-sourced, top-tier diamonds from world-class mines, set in the finest 95% platinum and 14- and 18- karat gold. All precious stones that become a part of Verlas jewellery are hand-picked and every piece of Verlas jewellery is handcrafted by a female-dominated team of Master Artisans who love the craft behind creating perfected jewellery just as much as Nidhi and Nityani. Every single stage of the manufacturing process undergoes thorough inspection to ensure absolute perfection and sustainability in the final product. Their manufacturing processes are audited by Bureau Veritas, and they take care in implementing the highest standards of international labour laws in their Verlas Studios that are all certified by the Responsible Jewellery Council. Working cohesively with their partners and suppliers allows them to ensure that they have a high visibility of the entire process and have a common set of goals towards society and a more sustainable world. Verlas aims at achieving a high level of end-product quality with minimum wastage of resources."
