        "text": "Worldwide, the culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) population is increasing and is predicted to reach 405 million by 2050. The delivery of emergency care for the CALD population can be complex due to cultural, social, and language factors. The extent to which these factors influence care delivery to patients is unclear. Using a systematic approach, this review aims to map the existing evidence regarding emergency healthcare delivery for patients from CALD backgrounds and uses a social ecological framework to provide a broader perspective on cultural, social, and contextual influence on emergency care delivery.

While operating in the neighborhood we illuminate the brilliance of tradition bearers that share our stories. This year I look forward to making more impact with the work that we do individually and collectively. On my agenda are Cultural Arts Competency and Community Wellbeing. The work will demonstrate how “Culture” can change the footprints in for instance healthcare by fostering novel approaches that address social determinants. Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing effective and inclusive care to diverse patient populations. It encompasses a combination of awareness, knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors that result in the best possible outcomes for both patients and providers By implementing culturally sensitive healthcare practices, organizations can improve patient access, address social determinants of health, and eliminate disparities in care This includes strategies such as diversity management, leadership commitment, cross-cultural communication skills, and integrating cultural arts into care as a social prescription. Research has shown that culturally thoughtful healthcare can lead to cost savings, increased access to appropriate care, and improved patient outcomes While there is no widely accepted and definitive conceptual cultural competency framework, existing reviews have examined various types of interventions to improve cultural competency, such as training programs for health practitioners. Overall, cultural competence is a critical component of healthcare that is increasingly recognized and prioritized in the medical field. #artsandculture #artsandhealth #culturalintelligence #socialgood #culturematters\n\nHealth initiatives in rural areas need to be geographically tailored, culturally anchored, and locally driven, say authors of a new study published in Journal of Primary Health Care, the Open Access journal of the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners. Rural residents in Aotearoa New Zealand are known to have worse health outcomes than their urban counterparts, and were identified as an at-risk population during the pandemic. Despite this, disparities have been found between rural and urban vaccination rates. The study aimed to gain insight into factors contributing to this disparity by exploring the experiences of those \"on the ground\" during the pandemic response. #JPrimaryHealthCare #OpenAccess #RuralHealthCare https://lnkd.in/gMKb57ve"
