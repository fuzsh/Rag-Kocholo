        "text": "Synopsis\n\nWhen it comes to gold, how pure is pure? And how does anybody know? The question of testing the purity of gold has been a live one for thousands of years, with increasingly precise methods being devised. But despite these techniques, most of the time the gold industry still runs on trust and reputation.\n\nGold is one of the most popular and precious metals that people use for jewellery, investments, and other purposes. On auspicious occasions like Dhanteras and Akshya Tritiya, customers buy gold or silver ornaments or jewellery. However, it is important to know the purity of the gold before buying or selling it to ensure that you are getting the right value for your money. You should know how pure is pure? And how does anybody know?\n\nThe question of testing the purity of gold has been a live one for thousands of years, with increasingly precise methods being devised. But despite these techniques, most of the time the gold industry still runs on trust and reputation.\n\nA eureka moment\n\nThe ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes is said to have struck upon one way to test the purity of gold while getting into the bath.\n\nThe story goes that the king of Syracuse had asked the mathematician to determine whether a golden crown was made of the pure metal, or whether impurities had been mixed in by a dishonest goldsmith.\n\nAfter thinking on the problem, Archimedes took a bath, and noticed that the level of the water rose when he stepped in. He leapt out immediately and ran into the street, crying “eureka!” (or “I've found it!”).\n\nHe had realised that submerging the crown in water would let him determine its volume, and hence its density. Because gold is denser than most other metals, this can be used to measure the crown's purity.\n\nThere are debates about the historical accuracy of the tale, and the exact mechanism of the test he would have used, but the gist is in keeping with the principles Archimedes laid out in his treatise On Floating Bodies.\n\nFire and fluorescence\n\nDespite the ingenuity of Archimedes' method, it is not in use today. Some of the most common methods used in the modern gold industry are the fire assay, X-ray fluorescence, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (or ICP-MS).\n\nThe fire assay is the traditional method used in the hallmarking industry (to certify gold in jewellery as 9 carat or 18 carat, for example), and also often used in gold mines to test the quality of ore.\n\nThis is a destructive method, so it wouldn't have worked for Archimedes. You take a small amount of metal from the item you're testing, mix it up with various chemicals, and melt it down in a furnace or crucible.\n\nThe process is designed to remove everything except gold. So if you weigh the sample you put in and the gold you get out, you can figure out how pure the sample was.\n\nHowever, the fire assay only tests for the amount of gold – it won't tell you what else is in the sample.\n\nX-ray fluorescence\n\nAnother common test (this one is non-destructive) involves X-ray fluorescence. You fire X-rays at the item you want to test, which excites the atoms in your sample and makes them spit out X-rays of different wavelengths. Analysing these wavelengths can tell you what's in the sample. The machine will give you a readout telling you the amount of gold, silver, copper and so on.\n\nThe gold standard\n\nTo get real precision, there are several different, more elaborate tests you could try. The “gold standard” would be what's called inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).\n\nThis process effectively vaporises a sample and then weighs the different atoms in it. It can tell you the composition of a sample with an accuracy of parts per billion.\n\nIt's an expensive, bespoke process, though. You wouldn't use it for jewellery. It's mainly used by scientists, or mining companies that want to determine the exact composition of a sample.\n\nYou would typically only use this kind of testing if you had a great need for exactness, or a reason to be suspicious of a sample.\n\nUse a gold testing kit:\n\nGold testing kits are available in the market and can help you determine the purity of gold. These kits usually come with a testing solution and a testing stone. You need to scratch the gold on the stone and apply the testing solution on it. The solution will react differently based on the purity of the gold, and the kit will come with a chart indicating the purity level based on the color of the reaction.\n\nCheck Hallmark\n\nLook for a hallmark. A piece of gold will usually be stamped with a mark indicating its type. A stamp of “GF” or “HGP” indicates that the piece is gold-plated, not pure gold. In contrast, a pure gold piece of jewelry may show a “24K” or other marking indicating fineness. Hallmarks are usually located inside the band of rings or near the clasp on necklaces.\n\nAcid test\n\nGold is a noble metal which is resistant to change by corrosion, oxidation, or acid. You can rub the gold-colored item on jeweller's black stone, which will leave an easily visible mark. The mark is tested by applying nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, which dissolves the mark of any item that is not gold.\n\nPerform a density test:\n\nGold has a unique density, and performing a density test can help you determine the purity of the gold. You need to weigh the gold and then measure its volume by immersing it in a container filled with water. The density of the gold can be calculated by dividing the weight by the volume. The purity of the gold can be determined by comparing its density with the density of pure gold.\n\nThe importance of trust\n\nIn practice, these tests are not typically used by people buying gold. The gold industry largely runs on trust.\n\nIf a reputable seller tells you they're giving you gold that is 99.99% pure, you generally believe them. You don't test every coin or every bar.\n\n(Inputs from PTI)\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n10 stocks that can defy the yen upheaval, as Sensex comes out of Dow shadow\n\nThree reasons why Mumbai, NCR beat Bengaluru in the IPO treasure hunt\n\nWhy Akasa’s losses are mounting when IndiGo is posting record profits\n\nIs the great Indian snacking boom slowing down finally?\n\n3 key things Nirmala Sitharaman can do to restore Buddha’s legacy, draw global tourists\n\nAnalysing Hindenburg’s three key allegations against Sebi’s Madhabi Buch\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
