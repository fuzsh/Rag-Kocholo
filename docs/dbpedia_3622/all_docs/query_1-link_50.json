        "text": "After an included breakfast, meet your VBT representative and the rest of the group in the lobby of our Taormina hotel at 8:30 a.m. The VBT representative will be easily recognizable and holding a sign.\n\nFrom Taormina, you’ll travel to Scicli by private motor coach (transportation time is approximately three hours with a short stop on the way). In Scicli, follow our local guide and embark on a 40-minute walking tour. The city is listed among UNESCO’s World Heritage sites for its baroque palaces and churches. You will have time for lunch with plenty of options in this wonderful little city.\n\nEarly this afternoon, settle into your luxurious hotel, a 19th century palace built by a knight, and an amazing setting to discover the history of local Sicilian nobility. After a safety talk and bike-fitting, follow your trip leaders on a warm-up ride outside the town in the beautiful Noto Valley. Later, gather with the group for a welcome cocktail under the frescoed vaults of our hotel, followed by a true Sicilian dinner at a local restaurant.\n\nToday's Ride Choices\n\nAfternoon: Warm-up — 16 km (10 miles)\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nThe warm-up ride explores Altopiano Ibleo, a peaceful, rural region outside Scicli. Leaving your hotel, you cycle out of town, passing farms and groves of olive and carob trees set along old stone walls. In the distance, you will see the coastline and the sea. On the way back, you will have a wonderful panoramic view of this baroque town.\n\nCumulative Distance Range: 16 km (10 miles)\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast, Dinner\n\nAfter breakfast, cycle the rolling countryside in the Province of Ragusa toward the sea, surrounded by miles of stone walls, cattle grazing in the shade of stately carob and olive trees, and vegetable greenhouses that supply markets both local and all over Europe.\n\nYou will reach Sampieri via a bike path along the sea. Sampieri is a summer resort town and its beaches are ideal for swimming. Your morning ride ends at a peaceful pine forest for a picnic lunch on the beach. Take some time to stroll around or swim while lunch is getting prepared. Reward yourself with a delicious gelato. From here, you can continue riding or shuttle to your hotel and relax. The city has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site for the extraordinary beauty and the importance of its late-baroque architecture, built after a devastating earthquake in 1693.\n\nThis evening, stroll Scicli and enjoy the magnificent architecture lit up at night, the perfect backdrop for dinner on your own.\n\nToday's Ride Choices\n\nMorning: Scicli to Sampieri — 27 km (17 miles)\n\nAfternoon: Sampieri to Scicli — 17 km (10 miles)\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nThe morning ride heads through the quiet countryside and a patchwork landscape accentuated by lovely stone walls. The roads are paved with little car traffic and you will pedal gradually downhill. Along the way, you will see large greenhouses, one of the city’s main sources of income, as Sicily provides 10% of Europe’s fruits and vegetables. The ride follows a scenic, flat bike path through a park by the sea with a sandy beach for swimming. In the afternoon, it’s easy coastal riding through the seaside village of Sampieri, followed by a long, yet manageable, uphill ride back to your hotel in Scicli, leaving the afternoon free for you to discover this baroque city. You can opt for the support vehicle to skip the hill.\n\nCumulative Distance Range: 17 — 44 km (10 — 27 miles)\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast, Lunch\n\nToday pedal in the peaceful and rolling countryside of Modica and Val di Noto, past rural areas and through little hamlets to San Giacomo, the lunch stop. At lunch time, you are welcomed by the owner (mama Nella) who oversees the many activities of her 20-acre farm while making breads, focaccia, jams, sherbets, and much more for her guests. Complement your lunch with typical Sicilian dish Pasta alla Norma, garden to table vegetables, local cheese and olives, followed by a mouthwatering tasting of Modica chocolate.\n\nYour afternoon ride follows a mostly downhill route toward the sea and your hotel. Relax at Villa Favorita, built in 1753 following the Renaissance design on what once was the feud of the marquis of Avola. Enjoy the swimming pool and terrace with views of the blue sea on one side, and the orange roofs of Baroque Noto at sunset, on the other.\n\nTonight meet the owner Corrada, a descendant of the marquis of Castelluccio and tour the beautiful common rooms and orange garden with giant cactus, before enjoying dinner at the villa restaurant.\n\nToday's Ride Choices\n\nMorning: Modica to farm — 26 km (16 miles)\n\nAfternoon: Farm to Villa Favorita — 39 km (24 miles)\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nThe morning ride starts from Modica and is one of the most scenic routes offered on this tour. It unfolds in the rolling countryside of Modica and Val di Noto, past rural areas to your lunch stop. The afternoon ride from the lunch stop to Villa Favorita is a mostly downhill route. If you like to shorten it, VBT offers a van shuttle to your hotel.\n\nCumulative Distance Range: 26 — 65 km (16 — 39 miles)\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner\n\nAfter a hearty breakfast, pedal along quiet, mostly easy country roads, toward the sea. On the way, you’ll want to stop to admire the fourth-century Roman Villa del Tellaro mosaics.\n\nYour destination is the recently restored, ancient fishing village of Marzamemi, nestled on a small promontory south of Syracuse. In good weather, you can take a break at the San Lorenzo beach for a refreshing swim. Marzamemi was developed in the 17th century around a tuna fishery, which is now the second-largest in Sicily and a national monument. The family known as the Princes of Villadorata still visit their 17th-century palace, a beautiful summer residence. Marzamemi is a good place to find a relaxing café or local fish restaurant for lunch on your own.\n\nThis afternoon continue riding toward the most southern tip of Sicily, the beaches of Porto Palo. From here enjoy beautiful views of the islands of Isola di Capo Passero and Isola delle Correnti (Isle of Currents). It is said to be one of the most scenic places to ride in Italy.\n\nSpend the rest of the day relaxing before shuttling to Noto for a stroll to admire the local architecture in this famous baroque city.\n\nDinner is on your own in Noto.\n\nToday's Ride Choices\n\nMorning: Villa Favorita to Marzamemi — 30 km (19 miles)\n\nAfternoon: Marzamemi to Porto Palo — 8 km (5 miles)\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nToday’s loop is on remote country roads, away from traffic, to Marzamemi and the coast. Marzamemi is completely free from car traffic and pleasant to stroll on foot. The afternoon route follows the coastline and is gently rolling, with great sea views. From Porto Palo to the hotel you are shuttled by a private coach.\n\nToday may offer an additional independent ride for experienced cyclists. Ask your trip leader for details.\n\nCumulative Distance Range: 8 — 38 km (5 — 24 miles)\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast\n\nEnjoy a short shuttle up a plateau called the Belvedere di Noto, from where you will pedal a panoramic route ending at your lunch stop, the Feudo Bauly. Acquired at the end of the 18th century for the noble family of the baron Judica, this property belonged to the same family for generations. Today, the Feudo Bauly is a country estate covering 150 acres including several buildings and a large wild holm oak wood forest. In the forest there are houses carved in the rocks that were inhabited in ancient times. The entire property is quite evocative. Here, you will follow a local truffle hunter and his dog Siri, in search of the precious black mushrooms. At lunch, enjoy the result of your ‘work’ with ‘risotto al tartufo’ and more specialties prepared by the chef with fresh garden produce.\n\nIn the afternoon, another scenic route leads to your final destination: an ancient fortified masseria, or farm estate, surrounded by acres of carob and olive trees. This fine country inn, Borgo del Carato, is your home for the next two nights. You will be seduced by the quietude, the sweeping views, the elegant spa, and the panoramic pool set in a manicured garden of fragrant flowers. Horseback riding is also available. Tonight, you will meet the owner and discover why the carat, or carob seed, is the unit of weight for diamonds and the name of the Borgo. Tonight’s dinner will be prepared with fresh vegetables and herbs from the garden.\n\nToday's Ride Choices\n\nMorning: Belvedere di Noto to Feudo Bauly — 21 km (13 miles)\n\nAfternoon: Bauly to Borgo del Carato — 20 km (12 miles)\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nA 15 minute shuttle takes you to the starting point at Belvedere di Noto, far from the city traffic of Noto. From there, ride rolling scenic and country roads with little car traffic to your lunch stop, the Bauly country resort. Afterwards, the ride continues along a scenic plateau on a road with almost no car traffic.\n\nToday may offer an additional independent ride for experienced cyclists. Ask your trip leader for details.\n\nCumulative Distance Range: 20 — 41 km (12 — 25 miles)\n\nIncluded Meals: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner\n\nYour ride crosses a scenic region that was inhabited in prehistoric times, and where archeologists have found cave tombs carved in the steep limestone cliffs. As you bike the quiet roads and a long canyon, you will admire the countryside dotted with farms and typical masserias with the sea—as far as Syracuse—in the distance. Today’s highlight is walking the Sant’Alfano bridge, and just before Canicattini Bagni, take the opportunity to become familiar with its mysterious statues.\n\nA local specialty of this area is honey. You will stop to meet Rosa and visit her organic farm, where she will introduce you to her bees and a myriad of honey products.
