        "text": "There are 42 competition venues for this year’s Olympics, and the majority of them are located in the city of Tokyo, though additional events will be held elsewhere in Japan. The Tokyo venues are mostly situated within one of two adjacent clusters — the Heritage Zone and the Tokyo Bay Zone — and the Olympic Village is located at the intersection of those clusters.\n\nThe map below shows the location of the two main zones. Note the outlines — together they are meant to form the shape of an infinity sign.\n\nMost of the competition venues will be located within these two rings.\n\nTokyo 2020\n\nHeritage Zone\n\nLocated in the heart of the city, the Heritage Zone uses many repurposed venues from the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. This cluster has 10 venues total. Olympic Stadium will host the Opening and Closing Cermonies, track and field, and soccer. Nippon Budokan (judo, karate) and the Kokugikan Arena (boxing) have attained cultural significance in Japan as meccas of martial arts and sumo wrestling.\n\nTokyo Bay Zone\n\nThere’s an underlying theme of “tradition meets innovation” with the Tokyo Olympics. So if the Heritage Zone represents traditional Tokyo, then the Tokyo Bay Zone would be its innovative counterpart. This area, which includes several artificial islands, is in the process of undergoing modern, urban development. Among the 16 venues in this cluster are the Ariake Gymnastics Center and the Tokyo Aquatics Center.\n\nElsewhere in Japan\n\nThere are 16 additional competition venues that fall outside of the two main clusters. Most notably, Sapporo (over 500 miles north of Tokyo) will host race walking and marathons after those events were moved out of Tokyo due to concerns about the heat. Sapporo also has one of the seven soccer stadiums spread across the country.\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics will use a combination of existing locations, temporary structures, and newly-constructed permanent venues. Below are a few of the most notable sites for these Olympic Games.\n\nThe rebuilt Olympic Stadium is set to be the centerpiece of the Tokyo Games.\n\nGetty Images\n\nOriginally built as the centerpiece of the 1964 Games, the stadium (formerly known as National Stadium) was torn down in 2015 and rebuilt to accommodate a larger capacity for these Olympics. It was designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma and features multi-layered eaves built using wood from each of Japan's 47 prefectures. The official capacity is 68,000 but can expand to over 80,000 with the addition of temporary seating on top of the track for certain events.\n\nThis will be one of the prominent sights of the Tokyo Olympics given that it will host the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, most track and field events, and the gold medal match in women’s soccer.\n\nThe Fukushima Azuma Baseball Stadium is located 42 miles northwest from the power plant that was the site of a nuclear disaster 10 years ago.\n\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nA total of seven games across the baseball and softball competitions will be played at this stadium in Fukushima, which is important for two reasons. First of all, the softball opener between Japan and Australia on July 21 will be the very first event of these Olympics (two days before the Opening Ceremony). But also, that game will hold symbolic importance for Japan because it represents a major step in the recovery of a region that was devastated by an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in 2011.\n\nWant more information about any of the Tokyo Olympic venues?
