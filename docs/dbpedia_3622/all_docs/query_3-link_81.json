        "text": "A few years ago, Wang Junjin was a traveling salesman, a Chinese Willy Loman whose second home was a ponderous, creaking sardine can of a train carrying him 38 hours each way to the factories in Hunan Province that bought his badges and insignias.\n\nMr. Wang found a better way. He and his brother started an airline.\n\nToday Mr. Wang, a short, boy-faced tycoon who looks much younger than his 23 years, has far more need for his cellular telephone than for a razor. His Sky Dragon Charter Airline Company offers seven regularly scheduled flights a week and reported revenue last year of $2 million -- some of which went into his $420 double-breasted suit and his $600 24-karat gold bracelet.\n\n\"If the Government lets us do it,\" Mr. Wang said, \"we'll do it.\" Profound Consequences\n\nHis boldness captures the entrepreneurial spirit in China today, and the entire Chinese economy seems to be taking off with as much energy as Mr. Wang's chartered Boeing 737's and other aircraft. Perhaps the takeoff will still be aborted, but there is a growing view that the incomes of China's nearly 1.2 billion people could soar for decades with almost incalculable consequences here and abroad.\n\nChina's economic revolution of the last 14 years is already in many ways more profound than Mao's revolution of 1949, for Chinese history is littered with peasant rebellions and new dynasties. But never before in recorded history have so many people -- or perhaps even such a large proportion of humanity -- risen from poverty so rapidly.\n\nBased on comparisons of purchasing power, China may now have the second largest economy in the world, ranking behind only the United States. Such statistics, while open to conflicting interpretation, suggest that China could overtake the United States as the biggest economy in another decade or so. Will China Surpass U.S.?\n\n\"It may well be that when the history of the late 20th century is written 100 years from now, the most significant event will be the revolutionary changes in China, which will soon be Communist only in a rhetorical sense,\" Lawrence H. Summers, the former World Bank chief economist, wrote last year.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
