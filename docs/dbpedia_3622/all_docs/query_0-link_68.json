        "meta_description": "Background Elevated rates of tuberculosis in healthcare workers demonstrate the high rate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb ) transmission in health facilities in high-burden settings. In the context of a project taking a whole systems approach to tuberculosis infection prevention and control (IPC), we aimed to evaluate the potential impact of conventional and novel IPC measures on Mtb transmission to patients and other clinic attendees.\n\nMethods An individual-based model of patient movements through clinics, ventilation in waiting areas, and Mtb transmission was developed, and parameterised using empirical data from eight clinics in two provinces in South Africa. Seven interventions—codeveloped with health professionals and policy-makers—were simulated: (1) queue management systems with outdoor waiting areas, (2) ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems, (3) appointment systems, (4) opening windows and doors, (5) surgical mask wearing by clinic attendees, (6) simple clinic retrofits and (7) increased coverage of long antiretroviral therapy prescriptions and community medicine collection points through the Central Chronic Medicine Dispensing and Distribution (CCMDD) service.\n\nResults In the model, (1) outdoor waiting areas reduced the transmission to clinic attendees by 83% (IQR 76%–88%), (2) UVGI by 77% (IQR 64%–85%), (3) appointment systems by 62% (IQR 45%–75%), (4) opening windows and doors by 55% (IQR 25%–72%), (5) masks by 47% (IQR 42%–50%), (6) clinic retrofits by 45% (IQR 16%–64%) and (7) increasing the coverage of CCMDD by 22% (IQR 12%–32%).\n\nConclusions The majority of the interventions achieved median reductions in the rate of transmission to clinic attendees of at least 45%, meaning that a range of highly effective intervention options are available, that can be tailored to the local context. Measures that are not traditionally considered to be IPC interventions, such as appointment systems, may be as effective as more traditional IPC measures, such as mask wearing.\n\nData are available in a public, open access repository.

        "text": "Discussion\n\nIn this paper, we estimated the potential effects of seven interventions on the rate of Mtb transmission to patients and other clinic attendees in PHC clinics in two provinces in South Africa. A queue management system with outdoor waiting areas and installing UVGI systems were identified as the most effective interventions, reducing the rate of transmission by an estimated 83% and 77%, respectively. The majority of interventions resulted in substantial reductions in the transmission rate however, demonstrating that a range of highly effective IPC measures exist. This includes appointment systems, which are not traditionally considered as IPC measures. This highlights the benefits of broadening our views of IPC and expanding our view of the population to be protected beyond healthcare workers, to also include patients and other clinic attendees.\n\nMany of the interventions could be implemented in different ways in practice, increasing or decreasing their effects. For example, installing a more extensive package of retrofits, or taking measures to achieve a higher level of mask wearing. Combining interventions will also increase impact, although returns will diminish with multiple interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have led to changes in the way that PHC clinics operate, some of which may last beyond the end of the epidemic. For example, the acceptability to clinic attendees of mask wearing may increase, increasing the coverage that can be achieved. When interpreting the results, consideration should therefore be given to any differences in the way that we implemented the intervention in the model, and the way that they would be implemented in a specific context. Nevertheless, our results provide a useful baseline estimate of the impacts and relative impacts of the different interventions.\n\nThe choice of IPC intervention(s) to implement at the clinic level, or to recommend at a district or provincial level, will necessarily also be guided by other factors. The costs of implementing and maintaining the different interventions will be a key factor, and is being explored in further work as part of the Umoya omuhle project. Guided by a whole systems approach, we have comprehensively costed the interventions proposed by also considering how to overcome potential system and practical barriers to implementation. The ease and practicality of implementation is also an important consideration, and will vary by clinic. For instance, is there sufficient space to install an outdoor waiting area? And is the climate suitable for interventions that increase natural ventilation rates? The systems dynamics modelling work conducted to identify the interventions simulated here also aimed to identify the mechanisms necessary to achieve the interventions. For instance, for ensuring an effective queue management programme, mechanisms such as community and health service staff consultation and creation of covered outdoor waiting areas were discussed.9\n\nSome of the interventions have additional benefits to patients. Improving the coverage of CCMDD may be beneficial to patients stable on ART, reducing the amount of time they spend queuing at clinics and the financial cost to patients. An appointment system should also reduce the time spent at clinics for the majority of patients. The effect of the interventions on risk of transmission to healthcare workers and other clinic staff should also be considered. All the interventions described here will reduce risk to all staff situated in waiting areas, such as security guards and clerks in some clinics. Many of the interventions will also reduce risk to staff in consultation rooms, provided that the interventions are also implemented in those spaces. Interventions that reduce risk by reducing overcrowding in waiting areas (appointment systems, CCMDD scale-up and outdoor waiting areas) will have little effect on risk for staff based in consultation rooms however.\n\nFinally, we estimate the effect of the interventions on an airborne infection, M. tuberculosis. The relative effects of the different interventions on other infections that spread primarily through airborne transmission, such as measles and chickenpox, are likely to be similar, although the concentration of these infections in children rather than adults may alter the effects slightly. The effects will differ, however, for infections where droplet or fomite transmission may play a larger role, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. Fully exploring the impact on these infections is beyond the scope of this paper, however, as a rough guide, interventions that act through reducing patient concentrations (CCMDD and appointments systems) or reducing the release of pathogens (masks) will have a greater effect on these infections than interventions that act through improving ventilation (opening windows and doors, clinic retrofits, outdoor waiting areas) or air disinfection (UVGI).\n\nThere are a number of limitations to this work. First, empirical data on the flow of clinic attendees through clinics were only available for 1 day per clinic, meaning that we cannot disentangle variation between the simulated clinics in the intervention effects that arises from day-to-day variation within the clinic from that which arises from variation between clinics. For this reason, the results are presented by province only in the main results figure, rather than by clinic. Additional empirical data (both on patient movements and ventilation rates in waiting areas), and simulated clinic days, would also increase the confidence that our results incorporate the full range of variation between clinics and clinic days. Similarly, data from additional clinics would increase the generalisability of our results.\n\nSecond, there were large amounts of missing data in the clinic attendee movement datasets. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation, and the effects of the uncertainties in patient times and waiting locations were reflected in the size of the uncertainty bounds around the results. Multiple imputation relies on the assumption that the data are missing at random however, which may not be true for our data sets. We also assume that all clinic attendees visited both files and vitals in turn, and that all attendees waited in a single location per stage, which may not have been the case for all attendees. For these reasons, our results for each clinic day should be considered to be indicative of the interventions’ effects in the clinic, rather than a definitive estimate of the effects of the interventions on each specific clinic day. We may also have missed a number of attendees entirely if they left before the start of data collection, or arrived after the end. The effects of this are likely to have been minimal however, as attendees leaving before the start of data collection could only have spent a small amount of time at the clinic, and attendee numbers were relatively small and fell rapidly after the end of data collection.11\n\nDue to the large amounts of missing data in the clinic attendee movement data sets, we were also unable to simulate in any detail the process of queuing for consultations with nurses and doctors, and for the pharmacy. Instead, we simulated a single queue for consultations, using data on clinic leaving times. This is unlikely to have had a substantial effect on the estimates for the majority of interventions, but may mean that we underestimated or overestimated the effects of the appointment systems and CCMDD coverage scale-up interventions. The large amounts of missing data also prevented us from considering the pathways of people who were accompanying patients or attending on the behalf of someone else separately from the pathways of patients, and all clinic attendees are treated as ‘patients’ in the model. This is unlikely to have had a large effect on the results, as the people accompanying patients are likely to have spent the majority of the time in the same waiting areas as the patients they were accompanying.\n\nOur results will also have been influenced by assumptions made in the parameterisation of the interventions. For instance, we assume that surgical masks offer no direct protection against infection to the wearer of masks, with the reduction in risk coming from mask wearing by infectious people only.22 If surgical masks also provide some direct protection against infection, then we may have underestimated the effects of the mask wearing intervention."
