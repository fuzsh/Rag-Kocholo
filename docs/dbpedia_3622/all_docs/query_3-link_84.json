        "text": "The recognition process\n\nRecognition is a process shared by all five sports councils (Sport England, Sportscotland, Sport Wales, Sport Northern Ireland and UK Sport), which determines which national governing bodies (NGBs) are responsible for governing the sporting activities the sports councils are willing to support and work with.\n\nIt acknowledges the status of NGBs as private organisations that govern particular sports through the common consent of the sport itself.\n\nApplications for recognition can only be made by NGBs. If you’re a club, association or individual and would like to see your sport recognised, you must contact your sport’s NGB and raise the matter of recognition with them. They may already have applied or are in the process of doing so.\n\nRecognition applications for a sport and the NGB for that sport are dealt with together as part of a single application. Recognition is subject to application which must be approved by all the home country sports councils with the following exceptions:\n\nWhere an NGB operates in a single home country, recognition of the body requires the approval of that country’s sports council only\n\nUK Sport also needs to approve applications where an Olympic or Paralympic sport or NGB is being considered.\n\nWhat's a sport?\n\nThe sports councils don’t decide what is and what isn’t a sport. There’re many different opinions as to what constitutes a sporting activity and the sports councils don’t have their own definition of sport.\n\nRead more\n\nHowever, we operate the recognition process to establish which sports we may consider working with. When deciding whether to recognise a sport, the sports councils look to see if it meets the Council of Europe’s European Sports Charter 1993 definition of sport, and whether it’s well established and organised within our jurisdiction.\n\nRead less\n\nWhat's a national governing body?\n\nIt’s not the role of the sports councils to establish or appoint an NGB as they’re typically independent, self-appointed organisations that govern their sports through the common consent of their sport.\n\nRead more\n\nThe aim of the recognition process is to identify a single lead NGB structure which governs a sport at UK, GB or home country level. Our recognition criteria focus on establishing if a NGB has achieved a position of pre-eminence within its sport and if it has a reasonable level of organisation and governance.\n\nSports council recognition of an NGB is not a guarantee of funding and neither does it mean we've approved or accredited the quality of its programmes.\n\nRecognition doesn’t bestow any official powers on an NGB to govern its sport.\n\nRead less\n\nGuidance for applicants\n\nIf you’re a national governing body and are considering making a recognition application, you should:\n\nRead more\n\nRead the Recognition Policy as this contains essential information which will help you when making your recognition application.\n\nEmail us to request a recognition pre-application form and a reference copy of the recognition full application form. When contacting us, include some brief details about your sport and organisation. Our email address is only intended for recognition-related queries. If you’re looking for funding, you can visit our Our Funds section for details of our funding programmes and our funding application forms.\n\nPlease also bear in mind that:\n\nYour recognition pre-application will be considered by the UK Recognition Panel and we’ll aim to contact you with the outcome within 12 weeks from the date we receive it.\n\nIf you’re successful at the pre-application stage, you’ll progress to the full application stage. Before submitting your full application, you’ll be required to meet with a representative from the UK Recognition Panel to discuss your application and, following the meeting, you’ll be provided with the full application form to complete and return.\n\nRead less\n\nSports and governing bodies that we recognise\n\nA list of recognised sports and links to the websites of the national governing bodies recognised by Sport England can be found below.\n\nA list of all the national governing bodies recognised by all the UK Sports Councils, can be found here.\n\nFor funding purposes, sports

bodies Yoga\n\nBritish Wheel of Yoga\n\nOur funding for national governing bodies (NGBs) has different objectives depending on the NGB involved. For example, while most are funded to support people who are regularly active, some are also funded to help inactive people into sport and physical activity, while others are funded to support those who are fairly active (meaning they don’t do quite enough activity to meet the Chief Medical Officer’s guidelines).\n\nAcross the 49 NGBs we funded during our 2017-2021 strategy period, there were 88 diversity targets split between women and girls, lower socio-economic groups, disability, older people, people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, and people who identify as LGBT+.\n\nA key element of these investments is to ensure sustainability for our partners, both by being more efficient with the existing resources available and being able to find funding from a variety of sources.\n\nAll the funding awarded since April 2017 followed detailed discussions with each governing body about what contribution they could make to our strategy.\n\nReceipt of funding was also conditional on the organisation meeting the requirements in our Code for Sports Governance.\n\nIn 2020, due to the disruption caused by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, we extended funding for existing partners through the 2021/22 financial year.\n\nOur success stories\n\nBack to Netball\n\nWe've invested more than £55 million of National Lottery money in netball-specific projects over the last decade. This has included contributing to the elite Vitality Roses, as well as supporting the Back to Netball campaign, which has seen more than 110,000 people get back into the sport.\n\nBack to Netball sessions are running across England and give women of all ages a gentle re-introduction to the sport. Run by passionate and enthusiastic coaches, sessions cover the basics of the game.\n\nO2 Touch Rugby\n\nFor those who like rugby but not the full contact version, the RFU, through our investment, has created more opportunities to play informal, social and non-contact touch rugby, including more chances to play rugby sevens around the country.\n\nO2 Touch is a fun and friendly environment for both men and women of all abilities to get involved in touch rugby.\n\nThe Whyte Review\n\nTogether with UK Sport, we co-commissioned a fully independent review into allegations of abuse in gymnastics.\n\nThe Review was led by Anne Whyte QC, and it heard from individual gymnasts, parents, carers or guardians of gymnasts, gymnastics coaches, British Gymnastics staff or former staff and any other organisations and individuals who wanted to provide information.\n\nThe Review was published on 16 June 2022 and is available to read on the Whyte Review website.\n\nPlease note: The Review concerns some sensitive and upsetting information. For some, including those who have personal experience of harm or abuse, this may be distressing.\n\nThe Whyte Review"
