        "text": "At first, converting any unit of measurement always looks cumbersome and a complex task to perform. But once the user gets familiar with the right kind of formula and understands the relationship between the unit of measurement, everything gets easy-peasy.\n\nKnowing and understanding the same procedure helps to solve the equation better. Therefore, it is important that a user understands the relationship between a carat and gram, followed by the necessary conversion steps.\n\nThis blog will help you understand it all, starting from the meaning to their relationship, formula, conversion process and examples. Therefore, keep reading to understand all these and a lot more.\n\nWhat are Carats?\n\nA carat is a measurement unit that is used to measure weight. It is normally used for measuring gemstones. A carat is normally seen as ⅕ of grams or as 200 milligrams. A stone is measured till they reach their nearest 100th of 1 carat. A point is also defined as 1/100th of the carat. Thus, you can easily name 0.10 carat stone as ten points or 1/10th of the single carat. A smaller stone, on the other hand, is normally defined as 0.10 ct or 0.05 ct. A carat is basically used to define the fineness of gold.\n\nThe abbreviation used for carats is ‘ct’.\n\nWhat are Grams?\n\nA gram is seen as the International System of Units. A gram is a unit of mass which is defined as the basis for a kilogram and a gram is seen as 1/1000 of a kilogram. But as soon as 2019 ended, a kilogram was no longer defined as the International System of Unit and rather is now established on the Planck’s constants, i.e, ‘h’.\n\nRelationship between Carats and Grams\n\nGrams and Carats are two different units of measurement that are used for different purposes, but that does not mean that they don’t share any relationship with each other. While calculating the same, the users may find it difficult to solve. However, it is a simple calculation to perform.\n\nThe relationship between Carats and Grams is showcased in the following way:\n\n1 carat = ⅕ grams\n\n1 gram = 5 carats\n\nHow to Convert Carats to Grams?\n\nAny form of conversion and calculation may look complex and intimidating when a user is not aware of their relationship. Therefore, it is always recommended to learn about their relationship as part of your first step and then continue with the process of conversion.\n\nBut as we have already mentioned the relationship between the two units of measurement, the conversion process of carats to grams will not seem as difficult as it would have been at the beginning. So, to convert carats to grams, you are required to simply divide the value by 5 and the final result will be in grams.\n\nThere are chances that you still find it a little painstaking.
