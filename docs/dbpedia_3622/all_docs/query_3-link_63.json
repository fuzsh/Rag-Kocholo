        "text": "Executive summary\n\nAround 1.4 million pupils in English schools have an identified special educational need (SEN).[footnote 1] These range from the most severe to comparatively minor. Identified numbers have increased for the fourth consecutive year, from 14.4% of all pupils in 2016 to 15.5% in 2020.[footnote 2] Many of these pupils are in mainstream primary and secondary schools.[footnote 3] Research suggests that there are varying interpretations and practices across professionals, schools and local authorities in both SEN identification and provision.[footnote 4]\n\nAlthough recent reports by Ofsted and others[footnote 5] have highlighted some strengths in the special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND) system, there are also significant weaknesses. These include:\n\ngaps in external provision and training\n\nlack of coordination between services\n\nlack of accountability\n\nweak co-production\n\nThis study was developed to explore how the needs of children and young people are met in mainstream schools and how approaches vary between providers.\n\nWe carried out this qualitative case study before the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic with 21 pupils in 7 mainstream schools. These schools are in 2 different local authorities. We asked the schools to select the children who participated, mainly so that those who took part felt confident and comfortable doing so. Consequently, this study was small scale and the children are unlikely to be representative of the population of pupils with SEND in mainstream schools. The results are therefore not generalisable, in particular, the extent of the presence or absence of particular experiences found in our sample.\n\nSchools often took a pupil-centred approach when identifying needs and planning provision, but staff did not always know the pupils well enough to do this.\n\nSchools worked towards building secure understandings of pupils and their needs. This appeared to support timely and accurate identification of SEND. Having positive relationships and high expectations for pupils with SEND appeared to be important features of practice. Schools also focused on pupils’ strengths to build confidence and independence. Ensuring that pupils had positive relationships with staff and felt included with peers was also a feature of some schools’ approach. Gaps in understanding of pupils’ needs and starting points resulted in a negative impact on their experiences, learning and development. In our sample, this particularly seemed to be the case for children without education, health and care (EHC) plans and those who were less well known to their special educational needs coordinators (SENCos).\n\nPupils with SEND regularly spent time out of class working with teaching assistants (TAs), but there were some concerns about social exclusion and over-reliance on a single adult.\n\nAlmost all pupils who took part in the research, including those on SEND support, had TAs allocated to them. Sometimes, this was to support them in the classroom, but very often they were taken out for intervention activities. This meant that many pupils were spending some curriculum time with TAs rather than teachers. This raises concerns about pupils with SEND having full access to the high-quality teaching that they need in order to have a chance of success.\n\nTime out of class for intervention activity meant that some pupils were not able to participate in some learning opportunities and some pupils were missing entire chunks of the curriculum. Not only does this imply that regular learning loss will occur in some areas for these pupils, but also that the curriculum that they are offered does not have the same ambition as for their peers.\n\nThe significant amounts of curriculum time that pupils with SEND are spending with TAs also raises the issue of support staff training, specifically in the subject and curriculum knowledge required to teach pupils who have struggled to learn the intended curriculum at the same rate as their peers. To deliver intervention activities successfully, TAs need good subject knowledge. Training for robust subject-specific curriculum knowledge is therefore an important element of ensuring that the TA role works effectively for children and young people with SEND.\n\nIn a small number of cases, pupils had become over-reliant on their TAs, potentially impacting on them being able to develop independence. Some parents and carers also raised some concerns around social exclusion due to the amount of time spent out of class in small-group or individual interventions. However, regardless of this, most parents and carers were generally very positive about the reassurance and facilitation of learning provided by TAs.\n\nOccasionally, schools were teaching a curriculum to pupils that was not properly sequenced or well matched to their needs.\n\nSome parents and school staff thought that in a few cases, pupils were being taught curriculum content that they could not easily access. Due to missed prior learning or unmet needs, these pupils did not have some of the required foundational knowledge and skills. In addition, they were not always given the chance to master basics before moving forwards. When this occurs, pupils are likely to continue to experience difficulties, gaps in their understanding will widen and they will then not have the best chance to succeed in the future. This highlights the importance of practitioners, including TAs, class teachers and SENCos, having strong subject knowledge so they can understand how best to develop and teach the curriculum to support pupils with SEND. It also shows that curriculum content needs to be prioritised effectively so that pupils with SEND can master what they most need to know before moving on.\n\nCollaboration between practitioners and families supported schools in meeting pupils’ needs more effectively.\n\nSome schools developed positive and trusting relationships with parents and carers, treating them as partners in co-production.[footnote 6] Parents shared information about their children with schools, who then used this to more accurately identify their needs. Some schools used a range of formal and informal communication channels to encourage families to share information. Parents and carers in these schools felt well-supported by individual members of staff, such as the SENCo or a class teacher, and were more likely to be confident about the school’s broader approach to inclusion.\n\nMechanisms for co-production with parents and carers were often in place but implementation was not always meaningful. This is likely to impact how far schools can tailor provision to children’s needs.\n\nWhile some parents and carers spoke about participating in decision-making for their child’s special educational provision, others felt that they were not given sufficient information about their child’s learning and development. Some were not given opportunities to input into support plans by, for example, expressing opinions on targets or provision plans. In some cases, pupils did not have written support plans at all. This meant that the graduated approach was not in place and, crucially, that parents and carers were not given the opportunity to co-produce support plans. A few parents and carers did not consistently take up opportunities for engagement. These factors affect how meaningful joint decision-making can be.\n\nSchool SENCos were essential for mediating provision but experienced a range of challenges in carrying out their role.\n\nSENCos fulfilled a crucial intermediary role between external agencies, schools and families. Strong and trusting relationships between SENCos, parents and carers facilitated this. However, some SENCos felt that they did not have enough time to carry out their responsibilities and access continuing professional development.\n\nSome SENCos were doing this alongside a full-time class teacher role. This indicates that for some schools, the role of the SENCo was not strongly prioritised. Some SENCos also reported frustration with delays and bureaucracy with both referrals and EHC plan assessments. These constrained how effectively they could perform their role.\n\nSchools employed a range of tailored strategies to meet pupils’ needs, sometimes supported by multi-agency services.\n\nSchools made adjustments to support pupils socially and emotionally helped to enable the pupils to participate in the curriculum. Staff reported adapting their teaching and providing tailored or specialised resources to enable pupils to access the curriculum. Subject-specific interventions were a strong feature. Access to quiet spaces and strong communication at transition points were also important. When required, specialised support from multi-agency services[footnote 7] complemented what was offered by schools. This input from multi-agency services was valued by families and staff. However, some pupils were not receiving help that adequately met their learning and development needs even when multi-agency services were involved.\n\nLocal authorities had strong ambitions for multi-agency collaboration, but this did not always translate into improved practice and positive experiences for schools and families.\n\nLeaders from both local authorities had strategies to promote partnership working and collaboration between education, health and care services. However, this did not always happen in practice and many school and family experiences highlighted challenges such as long waiting times and high levels of bureaucracy with the EHC plan process. Pupils with SEND lose too much time in appropriately planned education when there are long delays in accurately identifying needs.\n\nSome pupils received support from external services, but not always to the extent they need.\n\nSome families and schools felt that some pupils did not have access to the full range of practitioners needed, and some did not always have timely access. In some cases, this led to pupils’ targets and support plans being outdated and their needs unmet. Occasionally, families felt the need to commission or pay for services themselves to remedy the lack of timely provision from external services. This highlights the importance of a full range of multi-agency expertise being present and available for planning and providing in order to meet pupil needs.\n\nThis research raises questions about what ‘success’ looks like in terms of supporting children with SEND in mainstream schools.\n\nThis report has provided insight into the experiences of individual pupils, how their needs were identified and the support that was or was not put in place to allow them to learn and participate in school life. Some of the pupils in our sample appeared to be thriving at school. They were accessing the full curriculum alongside their peers, were making progress and were fully included in the wider life of their schools. Others were accessing a more limited curriculum or were excluded from particular events and activities.\n\nAs some pupils with SEND may need longer to master particular areas of the curriculum, schools and parents have difficult decisions to make about how to enable learning while also working to ensure that the pupils are included in school life. This highlights broader issues for debate about what ‘success’ looks like in supporting pupils with SEND in mainstream schools. The variation in support experienced by pupils in this study, even when they had a similar identified need, suggests that the SEND system relies on particular individuals performing important roles well and working together effectively.\n\nThis means that 2 pupils with similar needs, attending different schools, can have very different experiences. Absolute uniformity is unlikely when individual schools have autonomy to make provision for their pupils. However, despite individuals working hard and with care, significant variability in provision is not an indicator of a system working effectively for children with SEND.\n\nContext for research\n\nAround 1.4 million pupils in English schools have an identified special educational need.[footnote 8] The SEND code of practice[footnote 9] states that ‘a child or young person has SEN if they have a learning difficulty or disability which calls for special educational provision to be made’. For pupils of compulsory school age, this means that they will have significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of their peers or have a disability that prevents or hinders them from making use of the facilities generally provided for their peers in mainstream settings.[footnote 10] Four broad areas of need are identified in the SEND code of practice:\n\ncommunication and interaction\n\ncognition and learning\n\nsocial, emotional and mental health difficulties\n\nsensory and/or physical needs[footnote 11]\n\nMany children and young people who have SEND may have a disability under the Equality Act 2010. This states that a person has a disability if they have ‘a physical or mental impairment that has a “substantial” and “long-term” negative effect’ on their ability to carry out normal daily activities.[footnote 12] For these pupils, ‘reasonable adjustments’[footnote 13] must be made to ensure that they are not at a substantial disadvantage.\n\nDespite these official definitions, research highlights the varying interpretations and practices across professionals, schools and local authorities for identifying SEND.[footnote 14]\n\nThe code of practice also sets out a ‘graduated approach’ to removing barriers and supporting pupils’ learning with special provision. This is designed to be a responsive, spiral system of regular and personalised assessment, targeted action and review. The code of practice also requires each local authority to publish its own ‘local offer’, describing the support and provision available for children and young people with an identified SEN. This means that how provision is planned and achieved is dependent on the approach of the local authority and therefore what it means to have pupils’ needs met in mainstream environments varies.\n\nDuring the assessment and identification process, many children and young people are given labels that describe and encapsulate their characteristics and behaviour. Research highlights the fact that diagnoses and labels link the SEND system’s resources to individual pupils,[footnote 15] enabling access to improved opportunities through individualised programmes of support designed to meet needs. In addition, the shared terminology of a label offers a helpful way for practitioners to communicate what a child’s strengths and needs might be.\n\nHowever, the research also suggests that a label of SEN can be a burden for children, diminishing self-esteem. In addition, labels may be used inaccurately, and blanket application may mask individual differences between children, preventing them from being understood in the way that is unique to them. Labels can also potentially undermine the ambition to provide high-quality educational provision and reduce expectations for potential progress. Labelling encompasses a wide-ranging and complex debate but, ultimately, the identification of need and any assigned label should make a positive difference for individual pupils.[footnote 16]\n\nThe number of children and young people identified as having SEN has increased for the fourth consecutive year, from 14.4% of all pupils in January 2016 to 15.5% in January 2020.[footnote 17] The Department for Education’s statistics for SEN show that many of these pupils (almost 82%) are placed in mainstream primary and secondary schools.[footnote 18] Most of the identified pupils are classed as requiring ‘SEN support’, typically provided by schools. However, those with more significant or complex needs should have a multi-agency statutory assessment and hold an EHC plan.\n\nAn EHC plan is a legal document that details the support a pupil or young person requires and stipulates what the local authority must provide to help them succeed. EHC plans were introduced through the Children and Families Act 2014,[footnote 19] which built on recommendations from the Lamb Inquiry.[footnote 20] The Act preceded a number of reforms[footnote 21] to ensure that pupils’ needs could be identified in a timely fashion and to allow pupils, young people and their families to be more involved in the discussion and decision-making about the help and support they need.[footnote 22]\n\nThe number of pupils with an EHC plan (or statement of special educational needs[footnote 23] before 2014) has steadily increased each year for a decade,[footnote 24] rising to 3.3% of the pupil population currently.[footnote 25] Data from the school census published in January 2020 details the number of pupils with SEND in different school types. This shows that almost half of pupils with EHC plans are educated in mainstream primary and secondary schools.[footnote 26] In addition, 68% of all new EHC plans finalised for the first time in 2019 were for children and young people in mainstream schools.[footnote 27]\n\nIt is clear that teaching pupils who have an identified SEND is likely to be a feature of most mainstream teachers’ daily practice. Understanding how to effectively meet the needs of these pupils is therefore a vital element of high-quality education. This is particularly important given that pupils with SEND have poorer outcomes than other pupils,[footnote 28] which can lead to some restrictions in subject choice at secondary school stage.[footnote 29]\n\nA decade on from the publication of the Lamb Inquiry’s findings, the 2019 House of Commons Education Select Committee report found that many of the concerns it had raised still remained.[footnote 30] The report stated that:\n\nthere was a lack of accountability, particularly for the bodies responsible for delivering health and social care support to families\n\nthere were serious gaps in external provision and training[footnote 31]\n\nparents, children and young people were often not meaningfully involved in decision-making and reviews\n\nThe report highlighted a range of important issues that influence the way in-school support, therapies and other multi-agency services for children and young people with SEND are provided.\n\nSEND provision is a major concern for Ofsted. We inspect it:\n\nthrough area SEND inspections, which look at the provision that children and young people with and without EHC plans receive from education, health and social care providers\n\nas part of inspections carried out under the education inspection framework (EIF), where investigations into the curriculum and behaviour management policies and practices include an examination of how well the needs of pupils with SEND are identified, assessed and met\n\nthrough our framework for inspecting local authority children’s services (ILACS)\n\nIn addition to the findings detailed by the House of Commons Education Select Committee (2019), both the National Audit Office[footnote 32] and Ofsted have also underlined areas of strength and weakness of the SEND system in England and variations in provision across the country. Ofsted’s recent annual report highlighted the fact that in the most successful local areas, parents and carers had been given meaningful involvement in planning and decision-making, for example through parent-carer forums. However, the report also pointed to a lack of coordination between education and health services that resulted in delays in assessing and meeting children and young people’s needs.[footnote 33] These findings built on a previous report that highlighted the fact that identification of complex SEND was generally successful in the early years. It also highlighted that strong leadership and joint working was evidenced in some local areas but that there were concerns about a poor focus on outcomes for pupils with SEND and difficulties for families accessing services, and that effective practices for co-production with parents and pupils had not been established in some local authorities.[footnote 34]\n\nGiven the many challenges that these findings present, understanding the features of effective current models of SEND practice is important as Ofsted and Care Quality Commission (CQC) local area inspections continue. In addition, Ofsted has recently reported concerns about fractures in some elements of the SEND system. We have found that some leaders do not have deep enough insight into the experience of children and young people with SEND to commission services effectively.[footnote 35]\n\nIn response to all of these challenges, we developed the following research questions for this study:\n\nHow are the needs of children and young people met in mainstream schools?\n\nTo what extent does the approach schools take to identifying, assessing and meeting these needs vary between providers?\n\nSince we started this piece of research, the Department for Education has announced a cross-government review into SEND provision to understand how to ensure that the 2014 reforms are fully delivered.\n\nMethodology\n\nBased on the questions above, our aim was to understand the experiences of children and young people with SEND in mainstream schools. New understandings developed through this research will inform what we do on inspection and the framework for area SEND inspections.\n\nA qualitative, case study research design was used. We explored, in depth, the experiences of 21 pupils from 7 different mainstream primary and secondary schools (see appendix 1 and appendix 2 for a more detailed explanation of the methodology).\n\nInterviews were carried out with the pupils,[footnote 36] their parents or carers and their teachers and support staff. We also interviewed the school headteachers and SENCos. To develop rich understandings of the local context of the areas visited and the strategic oversight for SEND, we also held group interviews with representatives from the 2 local authorities and clinical commissioning groups (CCGs).\n\nTable 1 below details the identified SEND of the pupils who took part in the study and the level of support they receive. The language used to describe each pupil’s SEND has been taken from the parents, carers and school staff who participated in the research. All names are pseudonyms.\n\nTable 1: Characteristics of the case study pupils\n\nSee appendix 3 for pen portraits of the case study pupils.\n\nSchool and local authority Pupil SEND (as described by research participants) Support level School 1, primary, local authority 1 Ethan Autism EHC plan School 1, primary, local authority 1 Ava Listening and attention, dietary School SEND support School 1, primary, local authority 1 Jackson Lung disease School SEND support School 2, primary, local authority 1 Matthew Behavioural, social, emotional and mental health EHC plan School 2, primary, local authority 1 Ian Behavioural and sensory processing School SEND support School 2, primary, local authority 1 Amelia Cancer School SEND support School 3, primary, local authority 1 Jordan Cerebral palsy EHC plan School 3, primary, local authority 1 Ryan Sensory processing School SEND support School 3, primary, local authority 1 Nathan Social, emotional and mental health School SEND support School 4, primary, local authority 2 Matteo Autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dietary EHC plan School 4, primary, local authority 2 Jakob Behavioural School SEND support School 4, primary, local authority 2 Aaron Speech and language School SEND support School 5, primary, local authority 2 Thomas Autism EHC plan School 5, primary, local authority 2 Connor Sensory processing, dietary School SEND support School 5, primary, local authority 2 Harper Academic progress School SEND support School 6, secondary, local authority 2 Robert Academic progress in mathematics, writing, reading and comprehension EHC plan School 6, secondary, local authority 2 Maria Hearing, reading comprehension, cognition School SEND support School 6, secondary, local authority 2 Faizan Hearing School SEND support School 7, secondary, local authority 2 Isaac Genetic syndrome which affects behaviour, cognition and development EHC plan School 7, secondary, local authority 2 Cameron Speech and language, dyspraxia, hypermobility, information processing EHC plan application denied; exceptional funding allocated School 7, secondary, local authority 2 Madison Social, emotional and mental health, information processing School SEND support\n\nLimitations\n\nThe findings of this report are about a small number of pupils with SEND. As such, they are not generalisable to the wider population of those with SEND.\n\nThe aim of this research was to build on our understanding of pupils’ experiences. Although the sample is small, we can still develop hypotheses about the factors that may influence the experiences of pupils with SEND who are educated within mainstream schools.\n\nThe pupils were selected by their schools. We asked schools to select pupils who would not find it difficult to discuss their lives with unfamiliar adults as well as being dissimilar to one another in terms of characteristics like gender, age and their types of need. Making this methodological decision may have limited the breadth of the sample. It should also be noted that the data collected from the pupils was less rich than that gathered from adult participants (see appendix 1 and appendix 2 for a more detailed explanation of the methodology).\n\nThere was limited evidence of social care input for the 2 pupils who were in care at the time of the study. However, it should be noted that this relates to a very small number of respondents and that social care professionals working with these children and young people were not included in this research.\n\nIt is important to recognise that this research was carried out early in the spring term of 2019/20, with fieldwork completed before the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in schools being closed to most pupils.\n\nReport structure\n\nThis report presents findings from our research. Each section explores a different facet of the experiences of pupils with SEND and the provision offered by their mainstream schools. Broadly, these cover pupils’ school-led support, home–school relationships and multi-agency involvement. The conclusion considers the findings in relation to the research questions and any implications for future inspection practice.\n\nPupil-centred school support\n\nIntroduction\n\nSchools described using strategies that are part of a pupil-centred approach to education in which the staff intended to understand the strengths and needs of the pupil and make tailored adaptations to the whole curriculum. This helped several schools to include pupils, enabling them to participate in the varied aspects of mainstream school life alongside their peers. Previous research has found that this kind of inclusion helps achieve a positive school experience for all pupils.[footnote 37]\n\nSchools differed in the ways in which they worked to ensure that pupils could be included in classroom learning and social activities. This section addresses the first research question by examining how schools facilitated learning, with a focus on the extent to which pupils are included. We explore the pupils’ day-to-day experiences of school provision, focusing on 3 main aspects of professional practice:\n\nunderstanding the pupil\n\nhaving high expectations for pupils with SEND\n\nproviding tailored support\n\nIn addition, we explore some challenges for inclusive practice that help to address the second research question.\n\nUnderstanding the pupil\n\nIn accordance with previous research that suggests that school staff should develop their understanding of each pupil with SEND to promote inclusion, all the schools that took part in this research described building strong relationships with pupils. They did this in order to understand the pupils’ unique strengths and needs, help tailor support and provide interventions. This understanding was often bolstered by SEND-focused training and opportunities for continuing professional development for staff.\n\nFor example, the importance of developing a deep understanding of Isaac’s behavioural needs was referred to by his teacher and TA. They said that this had enabled them to defuse outbursts with reasoned, calm discussion.\n\nWhen talking about what made her feel included, Madison said that she had a positive relationship with staff and was able to rely on them:\n\n…if I need help, I just tell them [the teachers] that I need help and then they help me.\n\nMadison , school 7, secondary, local authority 2\n\nParents said strong and positive staff–pupil relationships were an important element of an inclusive approach. For example, Faizan’s parent said:\n\nI know he’s able to speak to the teachers himself about any issues he faces… they’ve been really good with him.\n\nFaizan’s parent, school 6, secondary, local authority 2\n\nCameron’s parent also highlighted the valuable relationship that had developed between Cameron and the school. When staff explained their approach to working with Cameron, they described focusing on his academic learning to help him become confident and relaxed but also on building relationships. The SENCo commented on this:\n\n…he [Cameron] knows that he’s supported by all. I mean […] the things that he jokes about and he’s telling the teaching assistants on a daily basis, he obviously does have a really good relationship with them.\n\nSENCo, school 7, secondary, local authority 2\n\nStaff appeared to have built a strong connection with Cameron. They knew and understood his needs and strengths, partly through daily informal coaching sessions. They proudly described a breakthrough lesson where Cameron read his own poem aloud and allowed himself to be recorded. They felt that the focus on relationships had paid off:\n\n…it’s lovely to see him having got to this development stage isn’t it now, it’s great to have him come in and have a chat in the morning.\n\nCameron’s form tutor, school 7 secondary, local authority 2\n\nA few parents and carers also told us that empathy was important. For example, with regards to his mental health, Nathan’s parents said:\n\n…he didn’t need somebody to say you’ll be OK, you’ll be OK. They knew his fear was real and they took the time to make him feel reassured, so he could carry on with their tasks in school.\n\nNathan’s parent, school 3, primary, local authority 1\n\nWhen schools focused on building positive relationships to understand a pupil’s strengths and what they could achieve, there appeared to be a positive impact on pupil progress. For example, Matthew’s foster parents recalled how his previous primary school had reported disruptive and sometimes combative behaviour and that Matthew found it difficult to concentrate on learning. At times, he was sent to a separate room or sent home, eventually being excluded. Matthew’s headteacher recalled receiving reports from his previous school about his behaviour and was told, ‘you won’t be able to do anything with him’.\n\nOn Matthew’s arrival at the school, staff focused on being positive, helping Matthew feel safe and building trusting relationships with others. The school allocated a learning mentor and provided play therapy to help Matthew regulate his emotions, as well as one-to-one intervention to help him catch up on missed learning. This had helped Matthew to adjust to his new school. His headteacher reported, ‘He smiles now. He didn’t smile when he arrived.’ His foster parents also noted the positive change.\n\nResearch has highlighted the importance of social inclusion for pupils with SEND.[footnote 38] Some schools’ understanding of individual pupil needs allowed them to promote social inclusion. For example, Matthew’s teacher recognised that he had needed his own personalised reward system before he could progress to the system used by the rest of his class. This meant he was then treated the same as his peers and included more fully in his classroom. The TA remarked, ‘he was quite happy to do that as well. It was [the] right package choice… to go ahead with that’.\n\nSimilarly, Ian’s teacher and SENCo provided structured activities to help him develop positive relationships with his peers. For example, the learning mentor recognised Ian’s interests and helped him bond with other pupils over a shared hobby.\n\nIn another example, Amelia’s teacher and TA provided discrete help that did not mark her out as being different from her peers:\n\n…there’s someone in the background should she require that support, and I think they’ve done that amazingly… but that’s not noticeable and that’s what I wanted really because I don’t want her to be singled out or stand out.\n\nAmelia’s parent, school 2, primary, local authority 1\n\nSchool staff also mentioned that Amelia took part in play-based activities and challenges in groups, so she did not ‘feel like the only one that needs help’. In this way, Amelia could feel included with her peers while still receiving the support that she needed. In all these instances, staff used their understanding of the pupils to ensure that provision was as inclusive as possible.\n\nGaps in understanding\n\nOne of the barriers to including pupils holistically in school life was gaps in understanding of pupils’ strengths and needs. For example, Harper’s teacher spoke of trying to tailor tasks in order to encourage and maintain greater interest in curriculum goals and maintain progress with reading. However, they were also unsure of whether or not he had passed the phonics screening check and, when asked to describe his SEND, they identified it as his ‘ability in class’, indicating some uncertainty around his needs. Similarly, Connor’s teacher could not recall his specific needs.\n\nAva’s parent suggested that she could not keep friends for very long and Ava herself mentioned that her peers ‘play without me’ and that sometimes, if they annoyed her, she ‘[beat] them up’. In contrast, Ava’s teacher and class TA felt she got on well with her peers. They had therefore not implemented any strategies to help her to form friendships. In this case, not developing a deep understanding of the pupil potentially had an impact on Ava’s experiences of social inclusion.\n\nSimilarly, staff at Aaron’s school, although aware he had difficulties with verbal communication,[footnote 39] were unclear on the extent of his needs, saying he could communicate with family and peers. However, Aaron’s mother mentioned that sometimes he found communicating at home difficult and instead used actions to convey his meaning to her. It appeared that this signing system was not used in school. In Aaron’s case, the school’s understanding of his needs was apparently limited.\n\nSometimes, staff faced challenges in developing their understanding of pupils with SEND and this influenced the accurate and timely identification of needs. These challenges related to staff knowledge and pupils adopting coping strategies that masked the difficulties they were experiencing.\n\nStaff knowledge\n\nSeveral primary schools reported that they had only identified needs once the pupil had reached upper key stage 1 or the start of key stage 2, rather than when the needs initially emerged. The SENCo for school 1 talked about this being a long-standing trend, with pupils’ needs not identified until later in their primary school education. This SENCo had consequently carried out specific work with early years foundation stage (EYFS) staff to promote early identification.\n\nThere may be a range of reasons why identification is not timely. Some needs can be complex, making it challenging for schools to understand and identify. For example, although Maria’s parent and the school had worked together and identified a general area of need, staff did not have a clear or consistent understanding of her needs. Maria’s TA and form tutor felt her main barriers to learning were comprehension, writing and cognition. The SENCo defined her need as a working memory difficulty. In contrast, the headteacher felt her needs were attention-based. In this case, multi-professional involvement would likely have facilitated accurate identification, but it is also important to consider the importance of school professionals sharing their insights with each other to build a strong common understanding.\n\nPupils who were receiving SEND support but did not have an EHC plan were less likely to have their needs identified accurately. This may be because pupils with an EHC plan have a multi-professional assessment of need, while those without EHC plans typically have their needs identified and assessed at school-level.\n\nFor some pupils, this meant that staff did not always seem certain of the nature of their SEND, possibly due to a lack of specialist SEND knowledge. For example, Jackson’s class teacher and SENCo talked about the challenges in identifying his needs, describing how he ‘was always one of those pupils who was on the borderline. He made progress, but it was never enough progress’. It was only when the SENCo started teaching Jackson directly in Year 2 that his level of need was fully recognised. In the case of Aaron, when describing his needs and what was in place to help him learn and develop, the class teacher reported feeling that it was ‘out of our skills set to be able to teach him’.\n\nThese examples suggest a need for continuing professional development for SEND and greater access to staff or practitioners with specialist SEND expertise.\n\nPupils’ coping strategies\n\nWe also saw examples of pupils adopting coping strategies that could potentially mask needs, making clear and timely identification harder.\n\nFor example, Faizan had developed strategies to cope with his hearing problem. In describing his difficulties and needs, Faizan’s parent did mention that he had received some speech therapy in another country during pre-school due to ‘delayed speech’, but said he was ‘was fine after that’. Subsequent teachers did not pick anything up until Faizan reached Year 6, when his teacher identified potential hearing difficulties because he appeared to struggle when there was a lot of noise in the classroom. Faizan’s parents then took him to a doctor, who felt the issue was not with his hearing but related to blocked nasal cavities. Following treatment for this, his parent said they still felt there was ‘something more as well’. His hearing needs were finally identified by an audiologist, but Faizan did not receive speech and language therapy until secondary school. Faizan’s mother mentioned that were some delays with referrals during the transition period from secondary to primary and the SENCo reported that speech and language therapy began in Year 8.\n\nThe parent reported that the speech and language therapist had noticed that Faizan could lip-read. It is therefore possible that Faizan’s need was not identified earlier because of this self-taught strategy. Additionally, his positive behaviour and attitude to learning likely made his need less apparent:\n\nFaizan, he was late identification with his hearing difficulties and I don’t know if he became more apparent because – very late actually – it was Year 8… Faizan is just one of those dedicated students who applies himself, and I shouldn’t say this but you could sit back and do nothing for Faizan and he would still succeed because that is his attitude to learning.\n\nSENCo, school 6, secondary, local authority 2\n\nBecause Faizan developed strategies to cope well with school life and learning, there were missed opportunities to identify his needs. These were perhaps in part due to a lack of efficient information-sharing between education, health and care professionals but also perhaps because of potential weaknesses with staff knowledge, leading to hearing difficulties not being noticed until the end of primary school. One impact of late identification and assessment was that Faizan was doing additional vocabulary work with a sensory support worker[footnote 40] in preparation for his GCSEs.\n\nAfter identifying ‘quite mild needs’ with Ian, the school provided play therapy in Year 1. According to staff, Ian made good progress so the school agreed with Ian’s parents that play therapy would stop in Year 2. As he progressed towards Year 4, at times, Ian began to have frustrated outbursts. Ian’s parent referred to writing as a potential ‘trigger’. Working closely with parents, school staff developed a range of strategies to support Ian with writing tasks across the curriculum but also in regulating his emotions, forming stronger peer relationships and building self-esteem. They reported that he was now making progress. Ian’s parent referred to the identification process:\n\n…they missed… they believe they picked up on Ian in Year 1 and they said that they thought Ian had some additional needs. But they said he, within sort of a few months he adjusted a lot better. Within 6 months they thought it was fine. They said he fell off the radar because, [SENCo]s sort of theory is that maybe his home life was managed and controlled quite well, he has good support around him and it didn’t get picked up until Year 4 again.\n\nIan’s parent, school 2, primary, local authority 1\n\nIt is possible that initial improvements in Ian’s behaviour occurred because he developed strategies through play therapy and at home to regulate emotions. This may have meant that staff missed signs of continuing need for support and his learning needs manifested differently as he progressed through the school.\n\nHaving high expectations for pupils with SEND\n\nIn addition to developing full understanding of the pupil, having high expectations for pupils with SEND was an important aspect of inclusive practice for members of school staff. For example, some school staff described how they focused on a pupil’s strengths to build confidence, while also setting expectations and specific targets for pupils to work towards. Some parents and staff also spoke more generally about the importance of having strong aspirations for pupils with SEND:\n\n…we tried to identify strengths… so that we could really build on his strengths. So he didn’t see himself as a pupil with difficulties… What I expected him to do was very clear. One of his targets is be ready, which means get your resources out. Listen. And complete tasks. Does he always do that? No. Is that the intention and are we improving on it? Yes.\n\nNathan’s teacher, school 3, primary, local authority 1\n\nJust because he’s got a need and he’s been diagnosed with ASD[footnote 41]… It doesn’t hold us back.\n\nEthan’s teacher, school 1, primary, local authority 1\n\nIn some schools, aspirations for pupils with SEND included focusing on their strengths to build on expectations for behaviour and learning. For example, Jakob’s teachers aimed to add 3 positives in his home–school book every day to emphasise his progress rather than only mention his behaviour. Alongside this, they spent time modelling their expectations through repetition. His teacher felt that, as a result, Jakob was now ‘aware of expectations which is a big step forward’. Some parents and carers liked the fact that their children’s schools focused on strengths and positives in this way. They felt that this encouraged their child to achieve more stretching academic targets:\n\n…he’s just a good kid and he really tries, and he wants to achieve and I think that’s why they’ve been brilliant because they’ve just seen that in him and they’ve pushed to help him.\n\nCameron’s parent, school 7, secondary, local authority 2\n\nIn a few instances, pupils appeared to be reticent about the aspirations their schools had for them. For example, although Ethan’s parents were satisfied with the school’s planning and inclusion (staff even assigned a role in the school play to the parent in order to make Ethan feel comfortable), his teachers found it difficult to include him. His parent reported that he liked to ‘take himself away’ and that ‘it’s Ethan himself that doesn’t want to be included’. His TA also echoed this: ‘he’s actually included by the teacher, by everything, but it’s what he will let himself be included in’. In this instance, the aspiration for Ethan to be a full participant in school life was constrained but remained part of a strong vision for what staff wanted him to achieve in the future.\n\nDeveloping pupil independence\n\nSome schools also described aspirations to develop the independence of their pupils with SEND. Many schools worked towards this through the flexible use of TAs, as part of a broader strategy to promote inclusion and build the confidence and skills of pupils with SEND. Ian’s teacher and TA talked about how he took part in all class learning but received additional one-to-one help with writing, particularly spelling, which could cause him intense frustration and sometimes led to angry and disruptive outbursts. They talked about giving him praise and constant reassurance to build confidence, and they had also provided him with a mood board to help him express how he was feeling. This helped staff to know when to prompt him to use agreed strategies to self-regulate his emotions.\n\nOther pupils, such as Madison, also received targeted subject TA help with work tasks, which she really valued. She explained that the TA helped her to understand a concept or find other ways of solving a problem in mathematics: ‘…she helps find me another way of […] doing something if I don’t get it.’ When describing working with Madison, the TA referred to providing a model for approaching problem solving tasks and encouraging her to work with peers:\n\nI will move away, and I just keep going back to her… she knows where I am […] and she’ll put her hand up.\n\nMadison’s TA, school 7, local authority 2\n\nIn this way, the TA could provide Madison with reassurance but was also aiming to encourage greater independence. However, this example raises the issue of support staff subject knowledge and curriculum training. Robust knowledge of the curriculum is necessary for all school practitioners around a child – TAs, teachers and the SENCo – in order for them to understand and work within the teacher’s plan for progression when supporting pupils’ knowledge development.\n\nCameron’s support from the TA was adapted over time to reflect his needs. For example, initially, the TA working with Cameron used thumb signals to enable him to communicate his feelings about his work as Cameron was uncomfortable with speaking. However, over time, Cameron started to ‘come out of himself’ and began to speak with school staff. The focus then moved to learning strategies: for example, how to manage his feelings when he was not successful with tasks and how to be resilient, move forward with problems and improve. Cameron’s parent mentioned that his learning and confidence had improved and that he had ‘turned around’ since starting at the school, ‘because she’s [the TA] now there, she can help him along the way’.\n\nMatthew’s TA provision also shifted over time to support growing independence. Staff reported that when he first joined the school, ‘he was struggling to do any academic work at all’. The TA recalled having to work individually with him outside of the classroom, break content down into small chunks and provide learning breaks. This was adapted over time as Matthew became more confident and able to engage with the curriculum. This meant that intervention could be provided in a more inclusive way. His headteacher reported that the progress he made had led to him being ‘reintegrated’ back into his class.\n\nFor a few pupils, there were signs that they were becoming over-reliant on TA support, an issue explored in greater depth in a later section of this report. Ryan’s class teacher described how he would ‘just sit and wait for an adult to come and do things for him’. The teacher reported that for writing tasks, Ryan sometimes used a whiteboard to create sentences that an adult would check before he recorded them in his book. However, Ryan did not always need to use this strategy. The teacher described how they had started to take a more hands-off yet encouraging approach to curriculum activities with him:\n\nThe approach we’ve had… is that we’re here if you need us but we’re not first and foremost going to jump in and do it for you.\n\nRyan’s teacher, school 3, primary, local authority 1\n\nInstead, staff talked about monitoring his progress to decide where and when more specific help was appropriate. Staff felt Ryan had responded well to this approach and appeared more independent and confident:\n\n…[he has] realised now, that he can write. I think he probably had a block on himself and obviously his emotional issues have impacted on his learning. And so I think now he realises that things are attainable. He can do them.\n\nRyan’s teacher, school 3, primary, local authority 1\n\nIn the examples above, staff shared aspirations and expectations for pupils’ independence[footnote 42] and worked to support this as part of their approach. However, for other pupils, although staff had an intent to help pupils become more independent, their implementation of this ambition was unclear. For example, staff at Harper’s school agreed that he needed more help to improve his independence but did not know how this would be achieved. Both Maria’s TA and staff at Jackson’s school were concerned that the pupils were losing confidence but did not describe specific or individualised strategies to help prevent this.\n\nProviding tailored support\n\nSchools provided tailored support to help pupils access the curriculum and wider school life, including for transition. These elements are explored in the following section, alongside some attendant challenges for inclusive practice.\n\nAccessing the curriculum\n\nAs part of their approach to including pupils with SEND, schools enabled the pupils to access the curriculum in a range of ways – through adapted lesson activities, additional resources and in-class TA support. In particular, schools seemed to consider interventions to be a useful tool for supporting access to the intended curriculum and they were frequently used for pupils with SEND. Many of the pupils received intervention sessions in core areas such as phonics, mathematics and reading. Some of the secondary-aged pupils received additional mathematics or English sessions from external subject specialists.\n\nAdaptation and resourcing for inclusion\n\nStaff reported using a range of adaptations to teach the planned curriculum for pupils with SEND: for example, writing frames, chunking material, questioning and adaptation of resources:\n\nEthan’s teacher helped him engage with the planned curriculum content by using his interests as a context for learning, for example trains or fictional characters\n\nJackson’s teachers created a personalised dictionary for him to refer to and help him recall vocabulary and spelling during writing tasks\n\nfor Isaac, who was working on entry level qualifications in a range of subjects, the school supported him to access this complementary curriculum alongside his classmates who were working towards GCSEs\n\nMost of the pupils and their families were happy with these approaches.\n\nWhen describing elements of their provision, many pupils often referred to the resources provided.[footnote 43] Teachers reported using physical and visual materials for their pupils with SEND. For example, Ian had a personalised work chart, while Isaac’s teachers adapted the size and resolution of all of his resources on account of his sensory needs. To manage Ethan’s anxiety at classroom transition points, teachers used timers for activities, visual timetables and ‘now and next’ charts. Because Harper struggled to apply sounds to his writing and form letters correctly, he was provided with a sound map. Other pupils were provided with sensory breaks, ear defenders or other adjustments, such as Faizan sitting near the front of the class to accommodate his hearing needs. These examples illustrate a range of basic legally protected reasonable adjustments[footnote 44] made by staff as part of their standard practice.\n\nCurriculum support from Tas\n\nThe deployment of a TA is a useful, frequently used strategy to support children with SEND.[footnote 45] TAs are a flexible resource who can be deployed in a range of ways – to support pupils within class, through the delivery of small group or individual intervention activity, or through direct support to the teacher.[footnote 46] The benefits of TA deployment for pupils’ confidence and motivation have been highlighted,[footnote 47] as have significant concerns about reliance on TAs. A landmark study found a negative relationship between the amount of TA support received and the progress made by pupils in mainstream schools.[footnote 48] These results were explained by the way TAs were deployed and prepared, factors that are outside their control. A follow-up study exploring the teaching and support of pupils with SEN highlighted the high degree of separation and TA support they experienced.[footnote 49] It also found that, compared with their peers, pupils with SEN received less appropriate and lower quality pedagogical provision. In addition, TAs often had more responsibility than teachers for pupils with SEN and insufficient opportunities to prepare with the teacher. A recent report has also pointed out that TAs are often put in positions that demand much more than a supplementary role and that this can lead to lower quality learning.[footnote 50] Based on this evidence, it is clear that the appropriate deployment of TAs requires careful consideration in order that resources are used effectively.\n\nAll but one of the pupils received interventions or task-based input from a TA in some or all areas of the curriculum. Some pupils were allocated a one-to-one TA. Planned out-of-class intervention for core areas such as mathematics, reading and phonics was almost always provided by TAs. TAs were also deployed less directly to pupils, using differentiated class-based group work. This meant that some pupils received class-based TA input, alongside some one-to-one intervention. For example, Jackson received one-to-one intervention in mathematics and also intervention group work for spelling. Isaac was the only pupil in this group to have a one-to-one TA at all times of the school day, including during breaktimes.\n\nIt is clear that many pupils within our sample were spending large amounts of time with TAs, and therefore away from the attention of qualified teachers. This raises 2 significant issues. Interventions are only useful if intended curriculum goals are clear. Therefore, strong collaboration between teachers and TAs is vital to ensure clarity of learning intention for pupils. In addition, it is vital that TAs who supervise the learning of children and young people with SEND have the requisite subject and curriculum knowledge to support these pupils who need the best teaching[footnote 51] or the close supervision of someone who does. One headteacher highlighted related concerns over the deployment of TAs and underlined the central importance of teachers retaining clear oversight of and responsibility for the learning of pupils with SEND in their classroom:\n\nI also want our teaching staff to be a bit more proactive with the children and instead of the TA being in the room so that’s kind of the TA’s responsibility. Staff know that it’s quality first teaching, and they are responsible for those children. They recognise that, but the actual action isn’t necessarily always there… I want the teacher to be able to pass on that subject knowledge. Because they are the person that’s in charge of that subject knowledge.\n\nHeadteacher, school 6, secondary, local authority 2\n\nAs part of their roles, most TAs had received SEND training through INSET days. A smaller number had also been given the opportunity to complete training or courses for specific needs, such as autism or speech and language. However, TAs have not had initial teacher training or the ongoing professional development opportunities that include understanding the components for teaching a curriculum, subject-specific knowledge and how to ensure that learning is remembered so that interventions in areas such as mathematics, speech and phonics is effective. Training for special needs is an important element of ensuring effective TA support but subject-specific training to facilitate pupils’ learning of curriculum content should also be crucial for support staff.\n\nWider support from TAs\n\nWithin the participating schools, in addition to curriculum interventions and classwork input, TAs were frequently allocated to pupils for a range of other activities. For example, Matteo received some time to work through a physical and sensory exercise circuit that had been devised by an occupational therapist. Jordan’s TA carried out physiotherapy exercises with him during physical education (PE) and provided practical help with his wheelchair. Amelia received allocated TA hours for work on concentration, some aspects of personal care and developing gross motor skills in PE. Jakob’s TA modelled turn-taking and participating in activities using timers. This had led to Jakob beginning to take part in small group phonics work and carpet sessions.\n\nSome pupils had different TAs working with them at different times. For example, Matteo had 2 TAs allocated for his morning activities, while a range of adults were deployed in a relay-style approach to stay with Jakob throughout the day. His teacher reported that Jakob had difficulties regulating his attention and his emotions with adults and peers and that his significant needs required a very intensive approach. The school had found that support from a small team of TAs was beneficial, with everyone being less overwhelmed.\n\nParents and carers referred to the strong relationships between pupils and TAs as being beneficial for their pupils. Madison’s parent spoke very highly of the consistent encouragement provided by TAs who were ‘always there to help her’. In fact, Madison’s teacher described her TA support as an important ‘prop’. Thomas’s parent referred to the EHC plan and its role being ‘to keep his one to one and I can’t imagine how we would be if we didn’t have someone’. When parents and carers referred to TAs, they often showed appreciation for the social emotional support they provided. Their responses did not focus on the effectiveness or quality of education.\n\nEnvironmental support\n\nStaff and pupils referred to environmental strategies that could be used inclusively. The pupils who were asked knew about quiet spaces provided by the school. Isaac talked about the room in his school helping him to feel relaxed. Ian’s teacher encouraged the use of the book corner tent as ‘his quiet space where he can just calm down’. Ryan and Ava were also able to independently access a quiet space when they needed it. Ryan appreciated the fact that the school has provided ‘lots of places where there’s not many people – so you can calm down really easily’. Some of the pupils reported not needing these kinds of spaces.\n\nTransition points\n\nSome school staff spoke about the need to provide smooth transitions for pupils with SEND at certain points in their education. This was particularly important for key stage 2 pupils whose move to secondary school was upcoming. School staff talked about the processes they used to try and make sure that pupils and their families were ready for this, using practices such as parent visits to begin the transition process earlier in the school year:\n\nI tend to have a phone conversation with any of our pupils who were moving up who might have specific needs, as in Jordan’s needs, physical needs. I would be speaking to the SENCo anyway and saying what would your normal practice [be] and what we’ve done historically is they’ve come in and had a meeting with parents to allay any worries anyway, before we’ve even started.\n\nSENCo, school 3, primary, local authority 1\n\nAlthough most parents and carers felt involved in their child’s transition, many were still anxious. This was the case even where they felt informed and had a good relationship with their child’s school. Their anxiety was even greater when they felt uninformed:\n\nSo, what I’m really scared about at the moment, is that he’s in Year 4 now and I’m thinking about Year 6, I’m thinking about high school. And I’m going to have to start thinking where is he, what’s going to be appropriate for him? I’ve got no support in that.\n\nMatteo’s parent, school 4, primary, local authority 2\n\nIt should be noted that some school staff were also anxious about primary–secondary transition:\n\n…making it clear I am concerned about Matthew going to high school obviously because although he is doing so well in our school, high schools are just a completely different environment and a completely different set of rules aren’t they?\n\nSENCo, school 2, primary, local authority 1\n\nInterestingly, the pupils did not appear to share the same concerns about moving to new environments. However, the experiences of participants do highlight the importance of collaborative working between parents and schools.\n\nCollaboration between schools was also important. The 2 secondary schools in our sample discussed using information from primary schools to inform pupil transition, including speaking with primary staff and parents or carers. In both secondary schools, this information was brought together using pupil passports:\n\n…as soon as we know which students will be coming to join us we start collecting information… I do then go out and visit their SENCos or the class teacher and we go through student by student, sometimes parents… and we get a lot of our information.\n\nSENCo, school 6, secondary, local authority 2\n\n…we get given the passports and get told which students are coming into Year 7 for the taster day when they are in Year 6.\n\nMadison’s TA, school 7, secondary, local authority 2\n\nThe 2 secondary schools also talked about working with parents and carers to identify future post-16 pathways. This included going to college or working towards alternative qualifications. Parents and carers with pupils attending secondaries suggested that this approach had led to a positive working relationship with the schools.\n\nSometimes, a pupil’s needs were not communicated effectively between education phases due to a lack of collaborative working. This mainly concerned the primary to secondary transition, but also early years to primary:\n\nWhen I went to the nursery, it was evident that Jakob had issues, but the nursery didn’t tell me how severe the issues were so when he came we weren’t ready for him. […] a big thing, one of my bugbears, especially in reception is pupils coming from nursery and we don’t know what we’re getting until they come, despite me going to visit.\n\nSENCo, school 4, primary, local authority 2\n\nThis lack of information-sharing led to some parents and receiving schools having to complete extra work to fill gaps or repeat processes. For example, Cameron’s parent said that although Cameron had been assessed by a doctor as having dyspraxia and hypermobility after one of his primary teachers raised concerns, his primary school had not told his secondary school. The parent reported that when they had contacted the primary school about this, staff had said they did not have any information. This led to the parent returning to the doctor to get the relevant reports again so they could be given to the secondary school. Cameron’s parent felt that the secondary school not having this information had set him back when he started secondary school. Lack of information-sharing at transition therefore sometimes led to some pupils missing out on provision or experiencing unnecessary delays.\n\nChallenges with support\n\nTensions with the use of Tas\n\nThis section has already explored some of the ways in which TAs provided support for pupils with SEND. The curriculum and subject knowledge of support staff has emerged as a crucial concern because, very often, the pupils who need access to the best teaching spend large amounts of curriculum time with TAs – staff who have not had the same training as teachers. This obviously raises questions about how effective intervention support can be.\n\nThe evidence shows that some of the pupils spent significant periods of time working with TAs outside of the classroom. For example, Connor missed assemblies, Harper missed afternoon lessons and Robert missed Spanish, religious education and sometimes other lessons to attend reading and writing support sessions as well as additional mathematics sessions. Maria and Madison were also both taken out of class for subject interventions. Ava’s parent and teachers reported that she needed help with core subjects, especially reading, and also needed support to remain focused. Ava spent every morning out of class in small group interventions for English and mathematics, returning to the main classroom in the afternoons. Additionally, she sometimes went to the year below for her mathematics lessons.\n\nMissing chunks of lesson time without the opportunities to access the same full curriculum as their peers has implications for pupils with SEND. As previously highlighted, they are not only not getting the high-quality teaching they need from teachers, but are also likely to miss some key content with which to build their knowledge, skills and understanding. In addition, they will have less time to repeat and remember knowledge. This suggests that they may be being offered a curriculum that does not have the same ambition as that taught to peers.\n\nIn addition to concerns over learning loss, this is an issue for social inclusion. Existing research suggests that segregating pupils through TA-led intervention work can create challenges to including them.[footnote 52] Some parents and carers in this study expressed concerns about this. For example, Jackson’s parent felt that although the TA interventions Jackson received outside of class were beneficial, they were also concerned about possible social exclusion from his peers:\n\nI’ve always asked does he go into class now and then? And does he sit with his friends? Because I don’t want it where they take him out and then he’s not included with his friends.\n\nJackson’s parent, school 3, local authority 1\n\nIn addition to the potential for weak inclusion from intervention sessions, for a few pupils, TA provision had created an over-reliance on a single adult, with some negative consequences for pupils’ experiences. For example, Thomas could remember how upset he had been when his TA left in Reception year, though he was currently in key stage 2. Similarly, Matteo’s parent recognised that he had become over-reliant on his one-to-one TA, who had worked with him since Reception. On advice from the educational psychologist, the school subsequently allocated 2 TAs at different times of day. Despite the change, Matteo’s parent reported that he became worried if he did not have an adult with him. Matteo also voiced anxiety about this:\n\nThe only thing I would change is to get another person for [TA2] because she is always leaving me for 5 seconds and for that 5 seconds, I basically need her because then I don’t cope on my own. I feel kind of alone. Then when she comes back, I’m coping again.\n\nMatteo, school 4, primary, local authority 2\n\nThis dependence on adults can constrain pupils’ independence and confidence and reduce the likelihood of full and meaningful inclusion.\n\nAlongside this, some school staff expressed concerns that there was not enough funding to hire all the TAs they felt they needed to support pupils with SEND.[footnote 53] For example, one of the schools had recently cut the number of support staff due to budget constraints. Other schools described similar worries around restructuring:\n\n…we’re currently about […] to restructure stuff which is going to be really difficult because that will have a knock-on effect with the additional adults that we use and utilise… the people that are working with pupils day in day out, they will have less access to them.\n\nHeadteacher of school 2, primary, local authority 1\n\nSome TAs described balancing the provision for pupils with SEND with other roles. For example, Robert received help from a TA in core subject lessons, but this was not as consistently available for other subjects, where staff were shared between more pupils. Robert’s TA reported, ‘We are pulled every which way.’ This suggests that, at times, the TAs allocated to Robert were not able to fully focus their attention on his learning across the wider curriculum to the extent they should have.[footnote 54] The evidence suggests that, while schools view TAs as an important part of their provision for pupils with SEND, there are associated challenges with this model.\n\nSupport not meeting needs\n\nThere were some examples of concerns about provision and the extent to which it met or was perceived to meet pupils’ needs. For example, some participants raised concerns over curriculum coverage. Aaron had one-to-one intervention for reading and phonics. His TA used sound flashcards and word-wheels to practise phonemes. However, she reflected that he could quickly become frustrated or disengaged: ‘I can’t push him too much as I’ve got to just keep moving on’. This suggests this intervention or the method of delivery was not working for Aaron, highlighting potential tension between the additional provision, curriculum coverage and progress.\n\nAnother example was Robert, who was reportedly struggling in reading. He was significantly behind age-related expectations. His carer said that he also struggled with handwriting and spelling. His carer felt that there was too much for him to cover across the curriculum and wanted him to have more intervention and tailoring of learning to tackle the gaps in his knowledge:\n\nI know it’s singling them out but sometimes you have to go backwards before you can go forwards and he knows himself that his handwriting is really bad, and his spelling.\n\nRobert’s foster parent, school 6, secondary, local authority 2\n\nThe examples of Robert and Aaron suggest that the curriculum or teaching provided was not fully matched to their needs and could potentially be causing cognitive overload.\n\nOther parents, carers and pupils commented that they felt current provision did not sufficiently meet needs. For example, Connor received weekly intervention for spelling, but his parent reported that this had little impact. They expressed serious concerns about his lack of progress in English and mathematics. They said they would like ‘someone else just to help him a bit more’. In contrast, his teacher felt that his needs were being met:\n\nI think his educational needs are being met and I think his emotional needs are being met within the classroom with the level of support that we give him… I think that… we’re covering most of the bases with him.\n\nConnor’s teacher, school 5, primary, local authority 2\n\nConnor himself was unsure of the help he received. He felt unsupported in mathematics, despite his teacher reporting additional help with concrete resources and detailed explanations. This example also suggests that when teachers do not prioritise the curriculum content that pupils with SEND most need to master, this can prevent their ability to deliver support effectively.\n\nMatteo’s parent felt that their school did not always adopt an approach that was tailored to his needs. They had made suggestions to the school for reasonable adjustments to help manage his needs. However, although school staff referred to a range of strategies that were in place to support Matteo and said these were enabling some progress, the parent felt the school had not taken all suggestions on board and were not always flexible in adapting to meet Matteo’s needs:\n\nWe are trying to help you, help him and you’re not allowing [it]… I understand there have to be rules, but if you’ve got a kid with a different need and it’s a genuine strategy that works, you should be flexing those rules.\n\nMatteo’s parent, school 4, primary, local authority 2\n\nIn these examples, it seems that support was not planned appropriately to meet needs. There were also concerns from some parents and carers that the schools had not made reasonable adjustments. These examples highlight the importance of strong collaboration between parents, pupils and schools to co-produce provision. Without this, there will be barriers to inclusion of pupils with SEND and also a potential risk of them continuing to experience difficulties.\n\nSummary\n\nThis section has discussed the principal ways in which schools worked to meet the needs of pupils and meaningfully include them in the classroom and wider school life. This involved developing deep understandings of the strengths and needs of each pupil, making clear and well-thought-through adjustments to the curriculum and having high expectations for the outcomes they can achieve, academically and across their wider school life. Schools also aimed to ensure that pupils felt included with their peers while receiving interventions or other forms of support. Where staff did not understand pupils well, those pupils’ needs were identified less readily. The curriculum was therefore not planned appropriately and help could therefore not support pupils’ learning as effectively. Sometimes, staff faced challenges developing their own understanding of pupils with SEND. Factors such as staff knowledge and pupils’ coping mechanisms affected accurate and timely identification of needs.\n\nAlongside intervention programmes for pupils with SEND, schools used TAs, tailored resources and adapted teaching. In addition, schools considered environmental factors and the challenges of transition points. In some cases, intervention programmes and other work with TAs saw pupils taken out of their classroom, sometimes for significant amounts of time. Inevitably, this meant that pupils were not being given full access to the learning opportunities offered by teachers to their peers. Some pupils were missing out on whole chunks of the curriculum due to time out of class. A few others received teaching that parents, carers and staff felt did not meet their needs. This highlights the risk of significant learning loss, which will compound over time and mean that pupils with SEND may not be well enough prepared for the next steps in their education.\n\nThe regular use of intervention sessions also raises the important issue of curriculum and subject training for TAs to allow their role to be effective for pupils’ learning. TA deployment was also noted by some parents, carers and school staff to hinder pupils’ independence and social inclusion.\n\nThe importance of home–school relationships\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe quality of relationships between home and school has an impact on the way schools plan and provide support for pupils with SEND. This relationship is critical for ensuring that schools accurately identify and meet the needs of children and young people.[footnote 55] A significant component of this relationship is the extent to which schools work to develop co-production with families, a way of working that brings together pupils, parents or carers and education, health and care services when making decisions about how best to support a pupil.\n\nThis section presents evidence with a focus on the second research question. It looks at how the home–school relationships can influence the timeliness and accuracy of identifying needs, and explores features of more and less effective co-production with families.\n\nIdentifying need\n\nResearch suggests that early identification of SEND is crucial. Timely, effective provision can help to narrow the educational gaps between pupils with SEND and those without.[footnote 56] It can also help pupils with SEND to adjust to school positively.[footnote 57]\n\nMost pupils had their SEND identified soon after starting formal education. Identification of needs most frequently occurred in Reception, key stage 1 or lower key stage 2 in primary school. We saw in the main 2 different approaches of how schools and families worked together to identify the needs of pupils with SEND:\n\nseparately, with parents and carers and the school working independently initially\n\ntogether, where the 2 parties collaborated with each other\n\nThis section explores how identifying need can be a collaborative process. It will also examine how this impacts on the timeliness and accuracy of the identification. In addition, it will highlight that even when there is good collaboration and positive home–school relationships, there are some additional factors that may influence the effectiveness of identification.\n\nCollaboration for identification of need\n\nThe SEND code of practice[footnote 58] highlights the importance of practitioners listening to parents and carers in order to understand their concerns and to help with their analysis of pupils’ needs. Some schools talked about identification as a collaborative process between school staff and parents and carers:\n\n…it would be around class teachers and teaching assistants, all members of staff really, being aware of how pupils are behaving, is anything out of the ordinary, are parents pointing out anything that they’ve seen at home… if that’s then becoming a pattern.\n\nSENCo, school 5, primary, local authority 2\n\nWe heard of examples of home–school collaboration that enabled the identification of need and provision being put in place swiftly. For example, Ryan’s parent referred to sharing perspectives with the school to enable them to develop a good understanding his needs: ‘we worked out together what some of his triggers are’.\n\nAt the time of the research, Ava’s parent had an active role in the ongoing identification process alongside school staff. Ava’s parent described speaking to the SENCo after their daughter joined the school towards the end of Year 1:\n\n…it was noted at parents evening she wasn’t keeping up with the other pupils. So I said to SENCo she can’t keep still, she’s just a bouncing, bouncing ball all the time… you’re seeing the same things as me she said, we need a meeting… and then things have started being put in place.\n\nAva’s parent, school 1, primary, local authority 1\n\nThe school had carried out a speech assessment and a receptive language assessment to follow up on concerns. They also made sure they built on the parent’s knowledge and experiences to inform the preparation of documents for the referral to a multi-agency panel.\n\nAnother example of collaborative identification leading to a rapid, positive impact can be seen in the experiences of Nathan’s parent. Nathan suddenly developed social, emotional and mental health difficulties after an illness, which resulted in him developing an intense fear of sickness. His parent immediately spoke to the school, which put some provision in place for Nathan’s severe anxiety. His parent described working with the school to see what they could do together. The school subsequently introduced books about anxiety and a ‘brave book’ for him to record small achievements throughout the day, which his parents felt had been very effective. Nathan was also referred to an educational psychologist and subsequently to the child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS). The parent felt the CAMHS sessions had helped Nathan to better manage his phobia, ‘I think he’s got the skills now to cope with it [and] uses strategies that we use, and the school and CAMHS have put into place’.\n\nIn this case, the collaboration and sharing of ideas between Nathan’s parent and his school led to specialist practitioner involvement that had a significant positive impact on Nathan’s social and emotional mental health.\n\nMissed opportunities for collaboration\n\nWe also found some evidence of weak information-sharing between home and school affecting the identification of need. For example, Harper’s school did not consult his parent during the identification process. In fact, his parent was unaware that the school had placed him on their SEND register (see ‘Insufficient information-sharing’). As previously discussed, at the time of interview, Aaron’s needs had not been accurately identified. Aaron was said by school staff to have difficulty expressing himself verbally but could still communicate well with his friends. However, although he understood the questions and could communicate with the interviewer using nods and other signs, he struggled to speak when participating in the research. Aaron’s parent said they could not always understand what he was trying to say, and that Aaron sometimes used signs to communicate at home. School staff appeared to be unaware of Aaron trying to use signs. School staff also did not appear to know that Aaron had experienced multiple problems with his larynx and ears when young and that he had had several operations as a result.\n\nIn addition, problems with partnership working and collaboration were apparent. At the time of the study, Aaron was receiving speech and language therapy in school but staff felt that it was not meeting his needs. His teacher also reported that ‘even speech and language have said they are at a loss as to where to go next with him’. Despite the SENCo reportedly expressing these views to the local authority education support service, mentioning that his needs were possibly in ‘medical realms’, at the time of research no changes to Aaron’s provision had been planned. This suggests that information may not have been shared effectively between practitioners.\n\nA combination of factors meant that Aaron was not receiving sufficient provision to enable him to communicate effectively. Weaker collaboration between home and school meant that his parent did not have a firm understanding of his school experiences and staff did not have a good enough understanding of his needs. Evidence of weak information-sharing and collaboration between education, health and care professionals suggests that they missed opportunities to accurately identify, assess and provide for Aaron’s needs (see ‘Multi-agency collaboration’). In addition, despite health service involvement, it seems that there was a lack of further action for developing the support package, including referral to additional expert practitioners. The impact of this on Aaron’s learning and development highlights the importance of a full range of services being involved.\n\nCo-production\n\nCo-production is a way of working in which children and young people, families and those that provide services work together. The aim is that professionals listen to, understand and learn from the views of children and families, and, in the fullest possible way, involve them in decisions about the plans for support that will enable the child to achieve their goals. This approach is widely seen as allowing more effective provision to be made for children and young people with SEND.[footnote 59] Co-production is advocated in the SEND code of practice.[footnote 60] Its principles are embedded within the Children and Families Act.[footnote 61] Research indicates that there are a range of factors related to the meaningful involvement of families in decision-making. These focus on schools listening to and learning from families, in order to build collaborative understandings of individual children’s strengths and needs.[footnote 62] Forming positive relationships with families, nurturing trust, communicating clearly and sharing information have all been found to be vital elements of practice for co-production.[footnote 63]\n\nThis section explores how and the extent to which schools have collaborated with parents and carers to develop provision for children and young people with SEND.[footnote 64] This often meant that a careful balance had to be struck between the things that were important to the pupil and family – their hopes and ambitions for the future – and what professionals knew was important for the pupil to learn and do in order to achieve these ambitions.\n\nWe saw different examples of co-production. Some parents and carers felt that they were encouraged to work with schools on the things that might benefit their son or daughter. This included making suggestions about provision:\n\nIt was a case of working closely with the school to just try and help him and do different things.\n\nRyan’s parent, school 3, primary, local authority 1\n\nJordan’s school encouraged his parents to share beneficial exercises they could do in school for his cerebral palsy. Ian’s parents suggested a class move after an escalation in his behaviour. The school acted on this suggestion and both Ian’s parents and school staff felt that this had a rapid, positive effect on his behaviour.\n\nConnor’s parent reported emerging behaviours of crying and feeling sick in the morning before coming to school. After discussion with the teacher, they felt this was due to the school’s move from ability grouping to mixed groups: ‘I think that actually just threw him off and he then realised then that he just couldn’t do it’. After consultation with parents, the teacher and TA then began meeting Connor at the door, so ‘if he has been a little bit anxious about coming in, he knows he’s going to see us’. Connor also showed anxiety with eating different foods during lunchtime. School staff noticed this and spoke to Connor’s parent, who reported that Connor had similar difficulties at home. After this discussion, a member of staff began sitting with Connor during lunches to encourage him to try different foods. This strategy was successful, and his teacher reported, ‘he now eats school dinners and eats something different every single day’.\n\nFor co-production to be effective, pupils, parents and carers should be involved as fully as possible in decision-making about new provision and adaptations to existing support plans and packages. The examples above demonstrate the beneficial effect of co-production on meeting needs and enabling progress.\n\nThe role of communication in co-production\n\nGood levels of communication between families and schools play an important role within the process of co-production. To support this, some schools set up regular, sometimes daily, methods of communication with parents to share any changes or concerns. Schools also used formal and informal communication channels to encourage parents and carers to contribute to decision-making about their child. Parents and carers were largely positive about the level of communication with schools. Formal channels included, for example:\n\ntransition meetings\n\nEHC plan reviews\n\nparent evenings\n\nInformal channels could include:\n\nregular end-of-day catch ups with class teachers and TAs\n\nhome–school communication books\n\nfamilies calling schools to discuss concerns\n\nInformal communication channels provided opportunities for parents or carers to discuss concerns that may not immediately relate to their child’s support plan as well as highlighting emerging needs. This allowed the school to prepare accordingly and put appropriate provision in place. Ethan’s parent described speaking daily with the school to discuss his ‘meltdowns’. They communicated with the school and discussed strategies to prevent these from reoccurring.\n\nSome schools offered ‘drop ins’ where parents could discuss things that formal meetings may not cover:\n\nI do speak to the school a lot. If I’ve got a problem, [staff member] – I email her or leave a message and she’ll ring me back or if I’ve a problem or if I want to know something. So they are good like that.\n\nRobert’s foster parent, school 6, secondary, local authority 2\n\nThey’ve always consulted me and asked me to come in and speak to them. And we’ve always […] come in and had a chat.\n\nCameron’s parent, school 7, secondary, local authority 2\n\nSome parents or carers used home–school communication books to maintain regular contact. These were used to share concerns, information and observations between home and school. This could, at times, result in the co-production of new provision. For example, Harper was refusing to read at home and his parent used his home–school communication book to express their concerns about this. The school created a reward system for Harper using a bookmark, which led to an increase in his reading at home. Written communication channels were also helpful for the family of one pupil who had some difficulties with memory:\n\nMum wanted a note of what he’s done each day so she could talk about it when he gets home because obviously it’s not always clear and he sometimes forgets so the communication between us and mum is like a daily thing as well, isn’t it?\n\nThomas’s TA, school 5, primary, local authority 2\n\nAlmost all schools spoke about the importance of maintaining communication with parents and carers. Some staff described how it helped them deliver appropriate provision, update the provision when required or keep parents involved and informed throughout the EHC plan process. Regular communication was considered to be essential for maintaining a ‘holistic view’ of a pupil and their needs:\n\nThe times we’d meet parents are if there was a cause for concern, [we] would ring, we would ask to meet parents and sit down and discuss that holistic view… because there may be some issues that we don’t know about that are impacting on whatever the difficulty is in school and they may be able to give us an insight into something. But then look at planning together how we might move forward, whether it’s from a learning point of view, SEMH [social, emotional and mental health], or whatever the difficulty might be.\n\nSENCo, school 6, secondary, local authority 2\n\nSchools that provided multiple means of communication created more opportunities for parents and carers to share information or concerns. The school was then better able to respond to these flexibly than might have been possible through more formal channels. By maintaining open and frequent communication, schools were able to build trust and strong relationships with families and develop the culture of collaboration needed for effective co-production.\n\nThe role of the SENCo in co-production\n\nIn common with previous research, we found that in some schools, the SENCo played an important mediating and sense-making role for school leaders and their colleagues but also for parents and carers.[footnote 65] Most parents and carers valued their relationship with the SENCo, who was often the first port of call when they wanted to discuss their child’s needs. One SENCo described how these discussions were valued and carefully considered:\n\nIf parents get in touch, I’ll talk to them about what it is that they perceive. And I’ll speak to all the teachers… we always want to obviously take the parents’ concerns on board and do whatever we can to support the pupil and the parents.\n\nSENCo, school 7, secondary, local authority 2\n\nAt times, the SENCo also played a mediating role in helping parents and carers engage with external practitioners. For example, Ethan’s parent discussed how their SENCo had been looking into ‘finding us something to help with Ethan after school’. Another SENCo described helping families with visits to the doctor (general practitioner (GP)) regarding pupils’ needs:\n\n…what I always do is I ask parents if they would like me to write a letter to back up what they’re going to the GP for… if I give that letter they do tend to refer, so it’s just to help them.\n\nSENCo, school 4, primary, local authority 2\n\nWhen parents and carers described a positive relationship with their school SENCo, they appeared to be more satisfied with their child’s provision. They also appeared to be more certain that their views would be taken into consideration by other school staff.\n\nI think [the SENCo] does have a plan of action with her… I could ask, I’ve never asked for one but I’ve put my whole trust in [the SENCo]… I rely on [the SENCo] to inform me.\n\nAva’s parent, school 1, primary, local authority 1\n\nI know that if I had something that I wanted to feedback then obviously I can speak to [the SENCo] or any member of the team to put my views across.\n\nAmelia’s parent, school 2, primary, local authority 1\n\nThe trust that many parents and carers had in their child’s schools may therefore have been influenced by their relationship with the SENCo, who appears to play an important role in the building of relationships between parents, carers and schools. Developing these relationships seems to be integral to ensuring that parents and carers are listened to and able to participate in the planning and review of provision. Ultimately, this should encourage greater levels of co-production and a sense of partnership between home and school. This relationship-building role of the SENCo is therefore one essential element of delivering provision for pupils with SEND. This has implications for school leaders, who should ensure that they allocate sufficient time for it, enabling the SENCo to work effectively.\n\nChallenges for co-production\n\nWhile almost all school staff acknowledged the importance of co-production with parents and carers, this practice was not evident in the experiences of all families. The extent to which schools appeared to fully implement a process of co-production and view parents and carers as partners varied. Some of the factors negatively impacting co-production were:\n\nparents and carers having insufficient information about their child’s needs and provision\n\nlimited opportunities for input into support plans and reviews from parents and carers\n\nlack of parent and carer engagement\n\nHowever, even in schools where the process of co-production appeared to be weaker, staff still seemed to be aware of its importance:\n\nI think certainly tightening up the process really around the processes within school, so support plans making that more of a set thing and just trying to involve parents as much as possible. That will make the most difference really, in terms of pupils within school.\n\nSENCo, school 5, primary, local authority 1\n\nInsufficient information-sharing\n\nSome parents and carers experienced inconsistent levels of communication about their child’s needs and provision. In one significant example of a school failing to keep parents and carers informed, Harper’s parent was unaware that the school considered their child to have SEND until they were asked, by the school, if they would take part in this research:\n\nIt was a bit of a shock. It was like being told that everything’s fine, nothing’s wrong, he’s just a little bit behind, to, your pupil’s now been put on a register and we want you to speak to these people.\n\nHarper’s parent, school 5, primary, local authority 2\n\nHarper’s parent was not aware of the extent of his needs at school and how much they were affecting his learning. His parent described how they had previously asked the school about Harper’s progress because they ‘had an idea that there was something’ but were told that it was ‘nothing to worry about’. The lack of open information-sharing between the school and the parent likely contributed to the fact that Harper’s needs had not been accurately identified at the time of the study and effective provision did not appear to have been put in place. Harper’s parent was not given enough opportunity to share their concerns and the school did not draw on his parent’s knowledge to inform their understanding of Harper’s needs. This approach is inconsistent with the principles of co-production, with the parent not being valued or involved. The SENCo acknowledged that this aspect of the school process was something that could be improved.\n\nActually, I probably could do with being a bit more, bit clearer around where, what the communication would look like at different stages, so stuff is not a surprise.\n\nSENCo, school 5, primary, local authority 2\n\nSome parents and carers who felt involved suggested that this was driven by their own proactive approach to information-sharing rather than collaboration between home and school. For example, although Ryan’s parent spoke of ‘working closely’ with the school, they also felt that they were left to find out any useful information themselves and then share this with the school, rather than working together with staff to reach a shared understanding of needs and any provision that might benefit him:\n\nI feel like a lot of it was left to me and you do it because it’s your child and you want the absolute best for them. And talking to school… I tried to be really proactive in terms of, if I learned something I’d come and share it with school.\n\nRyan’s parent, school 3, primary, local authority 1\n\nAnother example of a parent feeling like they needed to take the initiative with gathering information and organising provision was Thomas’s parent, who said they had to ‘concentrate on fighting for him to get help’ before he started primary school.\n\nIn a few instances, parents or carers contacted external services themselves. For example, Connor’s parents discussed contacting CAMHS when he was having problems with his diet and how they felt they were the ones pressing ‘to get an answer to his eating’. These illustrations perhaps suggest that in some cases, parents and carers felt the need to fill perceived gaps in services in order to gain access to the health support their pupil needed.\n\nLimited opportunities for meaningful co-production\n\nThe degree to which parents and carers were given opportunities to provide input into decision-making was inconsistent. These differences partly depended on whether the pupil had an EHC plan or not, with most parents and carers of pupils with EHC plans tending to be more involved in dialogue and decision-making. In a few cases, no written school-level support plan existed, limiting the scope of any co-production. In some schools, staff shared plans and targets but did not give parents and carers the opportunity to provide input beyond approving the plan:\n\nWe share the targets with the parents so it does come from the school but parents can have their view as well, so if they feel well, actually, I don’t feel this is right, I’ll say well, actually, this is the evidence that we’ve got.\n\nSENCo, school 1, primary, local authority 1\n\nA few parents spoke about positive communication with the school, but said that this did not lead to action. Matteo’s parent was given the opportunity to contribute in EHC plan meetings to share their insights but felt that the school did not always listen and act on that information:\n\nWhether it’ll be heard or captured is a different matter. Because we have discussed some of these things in previous meetings. And then it’s ‘oh right, we don’t need to change the plan – we’ll do that in the IEPs [individual education plans]. But then it doesn’t happen.\n\nMatteo’s parent, school 4, primary, local authority 2\n\nAlongside this, some parents and carers had less understanding of the processes in place for reviewing and updating support plans. For example, Thomas’s parent felt confused and thought that the review was in place to just confirm the allocation of the TA, rather than to discuss his provision in more depth:\n\nSo, to be honest I’m still a bit confused about… I know what there is in place to help him and when we do the review it takes […] 2 hours, when we do his review. It’s to keep his one on one…\n\nThomas’s parent, school 5, primary, local authority 2\n\nIn Ethan’s case, the parent had a very good relationship with the school and fully appreciated the work they were doing. This led to strong feelings of trust but the parent’s involvement was limited to agreeing to the plans that school staff had created. This left the responsibili"
