        "text": "Diamonds are a girl’s best friend… but does this apply to every diamond, or is there a diamond that is better than the best? Today, we’re discussing diamond carat and what carat diamond is the best. Read on to discover the best-carat diamond for you and what else you should consider when shopping for a diamond for your engagement ring or any piece of fine jewelry.\n\nWhether considering a natural, lab grown diamond, or diamond simulant, the carat is an important component of a diamond’s quality that contributes to its overall value. But what is a carat, why does it matter, and what carat diamond is best?\n\nWhat Is A Carat\n\nCarat is the measure of a diamond’s weight, not size. A single carat is 200 milligrams. This means a 1-carat diamond is 200 milligrams, a 2-carat diamond is 400 milligrams, a 3-carat diamond is 600 milligrams, and so on. However, a carat can be divided into 100 sub-points so gemologists can rate a diamond extremely accurately. This is why you see diamond carats given with decimals. For example, a 1.73-carat diamond will be closer in size and weight to a 2-carat diamond than a 1-carat diamond.\n\nCarat is also an important indicator of diamond quality. It is one of the 4 Cs, which are the four distinct characteristics that a diamond is evaluated on.\n\nCarat Weight & Prices\n\nSo how much is a 2 carat diamond and how much is a 3 carat diamond? Diamonds are extremely valuable, and the higher the carat, the more valuable they are. The value of a diamond increases with carat weight because the supply of larger diamonds is far less than the supply of smaller diamonds. The sparkling, perfectly shaped diamonds used in fine jewelry and diamond rings are cut from raw, unpolished diamond stones. These diamond stones are created beneath the earth’s surface over the course of hundreds, if not thousands of years. Larger carat diamonds come from larger raw diamonds, which are much rarer.\n\nIt’s easy to assume that a diamond would go up in price proportionally based on carat weight i.e. if a one-carat diamond is $2000, a 2-carat diamond would be $4000, a 3-carat diamond would be $8000, and so on. However, this isn’t the case. As carat weight increases, so does rarity, which causes the price to increase exponentially.\n\nSo while a 1-carat diamond may cost anywhere between $2,000 and $20,000, a 2-carat diamond can cost anywhere between $8,000 and $50,000, and a 3-carat diamond can cost anywhere between $30,000 and $150,000. So diamond price depends primarily on diamond size or diamond weight — as well as the cut quality and diamond clarity of your stone. That being said, it can also depend on whether you purchase a natural diamond from an old-fashioned jewelry store or a lab grown diamond from an alternative diamond shop.\n\nMaximizing Carat Value on a Budget\n\nDiamonds will always be valuable, and thus, will always be expensive. However, there are ways that you can find a diamond with an incredible carat size within your budget. By following these tips you can maximize what you plan to spend on your diamond ring or diamond jewelry.\n\nSelect a Loose Diamond\n\nPurchasing a loose diamond from an online retailer can help you save thousands on the price of a diamond. Plus, when you purchase the stone all on its own, you have the unique opportunity to create a completely custom ring. If you do this, you can avoid storefront markups that price similar stones and settings well above your budget.\n\nConsider a Diamond Simulant\n\nDiamond simulants are a fraction of the cost of naturally mined diamonds, yet provide the same beauty and sparkle. Take the\n\nNexus Diamond™ alternative, for example. This diamond simulant mirrors the look and wear of a diamond, with two exceptions – it is absolutely perfect in every way, and it costs significantly less.\n\nDiamond simulants undergo a thorough, independent evaluation by a skilled grader specifically trained in the diamond quality scale (the 4Cs) just like natural diamonds do, so you can evaluate them based on carat, clarity, color, and cut just as you would a natural diamond. Every Nexus Diamond™ alternative is created to meet the highest quality standards, which means it is internally flawless and colorless and has an ideal cut. For any naturally mined diamond of the same caliber, no matter the carat size, the cost would be at the very top of the price range.\n\nRound Down\n\nWhile people are attracted to round numbers, a 2.88 carat diamond is practically equivalent to a 3-carat diamond but may cost a bit less without the number 3 in front of it. This is especially important to note for couples looking for a diamond for an engagement ring. You may be able to save a bit of money by opting for a carat weight that is slightly less than a whole number, or by choosing a ring setting or diamond shape that makes the diamond appear larger than it really is.\n\nDiamond Shape’s Influence on Carat Size\n\nDiamond carats come in all different diamond shapes and sizes. For example, you can find a 1, 2, or 3-carat diamond in a round shape or any of the fancy shapes, which include oval, cushion, princess, pear, emerald, marquise, asscher, radiant, and heart-shaped diamonds. To compare diamonds of different shapes, diamond carat size chart.\n\nEvery diamond is uniquely beautiful and can be used beautifully regardless of its size. Half carat diamonds can make beautiful diamond earrings, while even smaller diamonds can be strung together to make a beautiful diamond band. Larger diamonds look beautiful all on their own in a pendant necklace or in an engagement ring with a solitaire setting.\n\nHigh Carat Sizes\n\nAll of a diamond’s attributes are important to consider, especially with diamonds of high carat sizes. Perhaps even more important than carat size is the cut of the diamond. If the diamond isn’t cut well, it doesn’t matter how big it is, it won’t appear brilliant and beautiful. Color and clarity also play an important role in the quality of a diamond, though. The larger the carat size, the more visible any hint of color or any flaw within the diamond is. Color and clarity are less obvious on diamonds of smaller carat sizes.\n\nHighest Carat Diamond\n\nThe Cullinan Diamond is the highest carat diamond that exists. This diamond was discovered in South Africa in 1905 and given the name the “Star of Africa”. The raw diamond weighed 3106 carats. It was later cut into 9 large stones and nearly 100 smaller stones, the largest of which is called the “Star of Africa I” and is 530 carats. The majority of the diamonds cut from the Cullinan Diamond, this one included, are kept in the Tower of London as part of the Crown Jewels.\n\nIdeal Carat Size for an Engagement Ring\n\nThe best carat size for an engagement ring depends on your unique budget and style. Carat affects the cost of a diamond more than any other attribute so those with their sights set on a big diamond will need a big budget."
