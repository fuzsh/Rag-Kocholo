        "text": "A Vibrant Future: Pilot Projects for Climate-Smart Fruit and Vegetable Production, Marketing, and Valuation of Ecosystem Services\n\nThis project will incentivize growers of specialty crops to adopt climate-smart production using practices like tillage management, alley cropping, water management and soil amendments, in order to establish consumer-driven climate-smart markets for fruits and vegetables grown using climate-smart practices. The project aims to develop tools for marketing climate-smart commodities that will be suitable for specialty crop growers and could be adoptable by the larger ag industry. This would include a consumer-focused “climate-smart seal” to be affixed to fruits and vegetables and/or traceable and tradeable “climate-smart benefits bundles (CSBB)” that growers can use in financial transactions. Models to assess carbon sequestration, GHG emissions, and ecosystem services using the Tier 1 (field experiments and AI models), Tier 2 (proximal sensing and remote sensing informed AI models), and Tier 3 (DayCent/COMET) approaches are planned to be compared using error and uncertainty metrics. The project also plans to statistically analyze the data and conduct quantification of ecosystem services for each specialty crop using the multi-scale Artificial Intelligence for Environment & Sustainability (ARIES) platform. The project aims to develop tools for marketing climate-smart commodities that will be suitable for specialty crop growers, and could be adoptable by the larger ag industry, two (not mutually exclusive) opportunities for growers to capitalize on the consumer demand in order to realize benefits of investing into CSAF practices: (1) consumer marketing toolkit which will be made available to growers participating in the program and industry-wide and/or (2) traceable “climate-smart benefits bundles (CSBB)” which enable buyers (e.g., processors and retailers) and consumers to reliably understand the breadth of climate-smart practices used and transparently determine the levels of different benefits delivered, and then use this knowledge to differentiate between the produce grown with traditional practices and produce grown with varying levels of climate-smart practices. Small and minority farmers will be recruited with assistance from Alcorn State University’s Small Farm Integrated Pest Management and the 1890-IPM Consortium network.\n\nLead Partner: International Fresh Produce Association\n\nOther Major Partners: University of Florida, Frehner-Jens Consulting, Alcorn State University, Measure to Improve, LLC, Bayer, Bland Farms, Bolthouse Farms, Calavo, Campbell Soup Company, Del-Monte, Driscoll's, Limoneira, Monterey Pacific, Noble Produce Holdings, Sun Pacific\n\nPrimary States Expected: AL, CA, FL, GA, LA, MS, WA\n\nMajor Commodities: Berries, Fruits, Grapes, Vegetables\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $15,000,000\n\nADM and Partners' Climate-Smart Solutions\n\nThis project will utilize incentive payments to thousands of producers across 15 states to adopt and implement climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices, like cover crops, reduced tillage and nutrient management, and develop markets. Part of the project will include engagement of ADM's 5,000 underserved producers to promote CSA opportunities, resulting in significant greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions and removals. Project plans to provide cost-share on a per acre basis to reduce costs for early adopting end users. ADM plans to transition climate-smart products to be sold a premium per bushel, allowing climate-smart practices to be funded with the supply chain. Soil carbon sequestration is planned to be forecasted using COMET-Planner, and biogeochemical modeling is planned to be used to quantify sequestration values from farmer data and soil sampling in conjunction with remote sensing. Field to Market's Fieldprint Calculator will also be used to quantify the benefits of practice adoption. This project plans to use a representative subset of acres to gather, analyze, and report certain metrics for the project. ADM plans to create a market that differentiates climate-smart commodities by establishing cost sharing opportunities for these end users to receive the benefits of a lower carbon supply chain. Climate-smart products are planned to be created over the duration of the project. ADM plans to market climate-smart products at a premium per bushel, allowing climate-smart practices to be funded within the supply chain. The project plans to direct funding for incentive payments to underserved producers. ADM also plans to conduct targeted communication about this climate-smart opportunity to black, minority, veteran, young and small producers to grow the percent allocation of direct payments to these producers.\n\nLeading Partner: Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nOther Major Partners: Costco, DKY, EarthOptics, Farmers Business Network, Field to Market, Flint River Soil and Water Conservation District, Food Works Group, Iowa State University, Purdue University, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Keurig-Dr. Pepper, Mid- America Biofuels (ADM Joint Venture), National Black Growers Council, Practical Farmers of Iowa, American Farmland Trust, Kansas Association of Conservation Districts, Ducks Unlimited\n\nPrimary States Expected: AL, AR, CO, FL, GA, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, MO, MI, MN, MS, ND, NE, OH, OK, SD, TN, TX, WI\n\nMajor Commodities: Corn, Peanuts, Soybeans, Wheat\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $90,000,000\n\nAgriCapture Climate-Friendly Rice\n\nThis project will benefit climate-smart farmers in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Louisiana, Texas, and California while expanding climate-smart rice markets and guaranteeing a supply of climate-smart rice to customers. All farms will be certified under the ACFRS. This project plans direct incentive payment to producers for climate-smart practice implementation and identity preserved storage and potential crop premiums for producers who develop their own processing capabilities and markets. Planned practices include alternate wetting and drying, furrow irrigated rice, reduced burning of rice stubble, early incorporation of rice stubble into the soil, and various techniques for improving nitrogen fertilizer efficiency. The project plans to follow AgriCapture's Climate-Friendly ™ Rice Standard, which uses IPCC equations and DNDC modeling for GHG benefits; representative soil sampling; in-field data collection activities including drone footage, ground level photos and videos, etc.; and use of remote sensing technologies to monitor changes in practices. The project plans to leverage existing marketing and sales employees to develop the buyer market for climate smart rice. The project plans to assist 30 percent underserved or small producers.\n\nLead Partner: AgriCapture, Inc.\n\nOther Major Partners: University of Missouri, Cedar Woods Consulting, Dainty Foods, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Blue Apron, McKaskle Family Farm, Arkansas River Rice Mill, Anheuser-Busch\n\nPrimary States Expected: AR, CA, LA, MS, MO, TX\n\nMajor Commodities: Rice\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $7,500,000\n\nAlliance to Catalyze Transition Incentives through Open Networks for Climate-Smart Agriculture\n\nThis project will develop the systemic tools and approaches necessary to catalyze change by operating in three areas simultaneously: equipping and training Technical Service Providers for CSA implementation, creating transition finance incentives for producers, and developing a robust and self-sustaining marketplace for climate-smart commodities. A market expansion strategy is planned to leverage the partnership networks to expand purchaser commitments, develop transition financing models and a CSA connector and marketplace exchange to match buyers, funders and producers and implement community engagement and consumer marketing. ACTION plans to deploy at least 25 percent of Producer Incentive Program funds to Black and other underserved producers and include information sessions available at no cost and a website with detailed FAQ, info, and dedicated phone and email assistance in English and Spanish as well as materials and services available in the following languages: Chinese, Hmong, Vietnamese, and Punjabi. Expected carbon gains are planned to be initially estimated using COMET-Planner, which will then be verified by monitoring carbon stocks for each project using the Range-C or Crop-C Monitoring Frameworks. In addition, 5% of projects are intended to be monitored intensively using these frameworks to produce strong levels of inference, 75% are planned to be monitored more moderately, and 20% are planned to be monitored at low intensities. Management data in the Ag Data Wallet integrates directly with GHG models and farm calculators such as COMET-Farm or Cool Farm Tool, allowing producers to complete certification recordkeeping GHG benefit through the same process, and these modeled datasets can be supplemented with soil test results, satellite data and imagery, and other site specific data points to provide one platform for managing all of the information needed to model, monitor, report, and verify a farms impact on climate change and carbon sequestration. The Market Expansion strategy is planned to leverage the immense breadth of the network across ACTION to 1) expanded purchaser commitments, 2) Innovative Transition Financing models, 3) CSA Connector and Marketplace Exchange for matching buyers, funders and producers, and 4) community engagement and consumer marketing. ACTION will partner with place-based ag technical assistance organizations and farmer networks to deploy at least 40% of farm project funds to support historically underserved (HU) farmers. Recognizing the historic inequities of accessible farm project cost-share funds, market entry support, and soil analyses for these farmers, ACTION will provide double the amount of billable hours for technical assistance providers and HU farmers to engage in this work as compared to non-HU. Three Regional Markets Program Managers will have a target of enrolling HU farmers for at least 52 of their 95 farm projects.\n\nLead Partner: The Wolfe's Neck Farm Foundation, Inc.\n\nOther Major Partners: CARCD, CO Dept of Ag.

The goal is to expand climate-smart agriculture markets throughout Missouri and serve as a teaching model for other states. To better engage small scale producers, including underserved farmers, the project plans to offer 100 farmers incentive funds to create climate-smart fieldscape demonstrations including cover crops and regenerative grazing. The project plans for farmers that sign up for incentive payments to provide data through the signup app on relevant farm management, including tillage, cover crops, rotation, nutrient management, and other practices for COMET-Planner assessment of each site. New high-throughput Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) gas analyzer technologies and soil carbon stock measures are planned to be leveraged to prove vital for a comprehensive understanding the impact of climate-smart practices. Out of the 25 partners on this project, 9 are private companies that plan to help with marketing, as will the three commodity organizations and the Missouri Department of Agriculture. Specific markets planned to be engaged include biofuels, beef, specialty crop markets, and ESMC. To better engage small farmers, including underserved farmers, the project plans to offer 100 farmers the opportunity to create a demonstration climate-smart fieldscape on their farm with a dedicated pool of incentive funds for small and underserved farmers participating in climate-smart fieldscape demonstrations and by reserving at least 30% of the remaining incentive funds for small and underserved farmers.\n\nLead Partner: The Curators of the University of Missouri\n\nOther Major Partners: Lincoln University, MO Soybeans Assoc./Merchandising Council, MO Corn Growers Assoc./Merchandising Council, MO Cattlemen’s Association, MO Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts, The Nature Conservancy, Columbia Center for Urban Agriculture, EarthDance, STAR Program, ESMC, MO Department of Agriculture, MO Department of Natural Resources, MO Department of Conservation, MO Agribusiness Association, MFA Inc., MO Fertilizer Control Board, Kansas City Food Hub, FarmRaise, MARC-IV Consulting, Nestle-Purina, Show-Me Energy, Mid-America Biofuels, MO Prime Beef Packers, MO Farm Bureau, NC State University\n\nPrimary States Expected: MO\n\nMajor Commodities: Agroforestry, Beef, Corn, Cotton, Dairy, Livestock, Oats, Pulses, Sorghum, Soybeans, Specialty Crops, Wheat\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $25,000,000\n\nBuilding a Climate-Smart Domestic Rubber Industry and a Solution for Growers to a Water Crisis\n\nThis project will expand natural rubber production in the Southwest with lowered greenhouse gas emissions, creating jobs in the region and for tribal stakeholders, and building a climate-smart rubber bioeconomy based on climate-smart and sustainable practices. This project plans to pay a per acre per year incentive, and fund planting, harvesting and delivery of the crop to the processing facility. The work proposed almost exclusively works with underserved and small producers, including the Tohono O’odham Nation and the Colorado River Tribes. The project aims to include marketing the rubber to Bridgestone, which is providing more than $35M in cost share to the project. The strategy would incorporate an integrated, robust, and comprehensive approach to data measurement and analysis, which includes soil carbon and plant measurements, ground level GHG measurements, flux tower measurements, soil carbon modeling, and holistic life cycle and techno-economic modeling.

This project plans to pay a per acre per year incentive regardless of yield and fund planting, harvesting and delivery of the crop to the processing facility. The work proposed almost exclusively works with underserved and small producers, including the Tohono O’odham Nation and the Colorado River Tribes.\n\nLead Partner: University of Arizona\n\nOther Major Partners: Bridgestone Americas, Inc., Colorado State University, OpenET, Tohono O'odham Nation, Colorado River Indian Tribes (Mohave, Chemeuvi, Hopi and Navajo peoples)\n\nPrimary States Expected: AZ, Tribal\n\nMajor Commodities: Natural Rubber\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $35,000,000\n\nBuilding a Regenerative Ranching Economy in the West\n\nThis project will expand climate-smart markets for beef and implement climate-smart grazing practices in beef production for 120 operations across 13 states, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing market returns for participants. The project will use IPCC Tier 1 approach to estimating methane. Also, will use N2O and methane from soil and manure, soil carbon density and look at remote sensing methods while grazing forages and crop residues. The project plans to track cattle through the supply chain. A few partners will be engaged to provide climate-smart corn, wheat and other grain residue for finishing the cattle. The project will pay premium prices which will result in additional revenue to producers based on the climate-smart practices implemented to grow the beef cattle. 75% of participants are projected to be small to mid-sized family operations including 35 small producers and 700,000 acres managed by Tribal producers.\n\nLead Partner: Sustainable Northwest\n\nOther Major Partners: Country Natural Beef, Beef Northwest, Northway Ranch Services, Quantis International, Stockpot Collective, Washington State University, Colorado State University, RaboResearch & Food Agribusiness-North America, Texas A&M\n\nPrimary States Expected: AZ, CA, CO, HI, ID, MT, NM, NV, OR, TX, UT, WA, WY, Tribal\n\nMajor Commodities: Beef\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $10,000,000\n\nBuilding Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities in South Carolina\n\nThis project will utilize a coalition of 27 entities to execute a pilot project that provides incentives to farmers to implement climate-smart (CS) production practices. The project will examine and verify the benefits resulting from implementing CS practices and will support development of markets for the resulting CS commodities. The project plans to provide direct payments to producers to implement climate-smart practices like cover crops, residue and tillage management, reduced tillage, mulching, nutrient management, prescribed grazing, prescribed fire, tree stand improvement, and early successional habitat development and management. The plan to develop and expand involves advanced economic analysis techniques to estimate economic and environmental benefits and to assess potential long-term viability, as well as creation of a labeling and certification process for climate-smart commodities. GHG benefits are planned to be estimated using COMET-Planner and COMET-Farm with direct field measurements of GHG emissions on a sample of the enrolled farms, forests, and beef cattle operations, as well as third party verification of GHG benefit estimations. The plan to develop and expand markets focuses on studying relevant aspects of consumer markets, participating and non-participating producers, the food industry, and the timber and lumber industry. The plan involves advanced economic analysis techniques to estimate economic and environmental benefits and to assess potential long-term viability, as well as creation of a labeling and certification process for climate-smart commodities. The project plans for at least 50% of the participating farmers and landowners to be underserved and small. Additionally, there will be an annual recruitment of minority forest owners to form cluster sales.\n\nLead Partner: Clemson University\n\nOther Major Partners: SC State University, American Peanut Council, CU Wood Utilization Institute, Forest Assoc. of SC, Help for Landowners, Mixon Seeds, Plametto Agribusiness Council, Petrichor Global, SC Cattleman's Assoc., SC Peanut Board, SC Southern SARE, SC Timber Producers Assoc., SC Forage and Grazing Lands Coalition, SC Farmers Markets, SC Specialty Crop Assoc., The Long Leaf Alliance, Tidewater Lumber and Moulding, US Endowment for Forests and Communities, WP Rawl, Center for Heirs Property Preservation, SC Black Farmer's Assoc, SC New & Beginning Farmers Program, Farmer Veteran Coalition of SC, Women in Agriculture, Women Owning Woodlands\n\nPrimary States Expected: SC\n\nMajor Commodities: Beef, Forest Products, Leafy Greens, Peanuts\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $70,000,000\n\nBuilding Soil, Building Equity: Accelerating a Regenerative Farming Movement in Appalachia and the Southeast\n\nThis project seeks to build climate-smart markets and sequester carbon over thousands of acres of Appalachian and rural southeastern land through strategic recruitment from networks of producers. The project will use education, outreach, technical assistance, and incentivizing producers to adopt climate-smart agriculture. COMET-Planner will be used to determine estimates of activity impact on GHG, COMET-Farm will be used to build out a historical and plot specific report. Soil carbon testing, through Kansas State University will allow producers to monitor increases in soil carbon sequestration over time in their climate-smart implementation plots, and Working Trees, a venture out of Stanford University using smartphone cameras and LiDAR, satellite remote sensing, and machine learning to empower producers to monitor the carbon impact of agroforestry efforts. The project will work with specific farmer alliances like SURREF (Sustainable Rural Regenerative Enterprises for Families), a collection of 30+ black farmers on regenerative agriculture-based south Appalachians to deliver Building Soil Building Equity (BSBE) solutions and opportunities to the participating farmers. The project plans to allocate funding for technical assistance, implementation and monitoring for underserved producers. Of those enrolled, the project team plans to commit to 75% representation of underserved communities.\n\nLead Partner: Accelerating Appalachia, Inc.\n\nOther Major Partners: National Center for Appropriate Technologies, Kentucky State University, Working Trees from Stanford University’s TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy, Carbon Harvest, GRC Advising, Latin Talent Accelerator\n\nPrimary States Expected: GA, KY, NC, OH, SC, TN, VA, WV\n\nMajor Commodities: Agroforestry, Beef, Cotton, Fruit, Pork, Row Crops, Specialty Crops, Vegetables, Wool\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $20,000,000\n\nBuilding the Climate-Smart Wood Economy\n\nThis project brings together Tribal, small family forest, and nonprofit wood producers with data scientists and the design and construction industry to manage and restore tens of thousands of acres in Oregon. The project will quantify the positive impacts of climate-smart management on carbon sequestration, wildfire intensity, and cultural values, and will also build resources for project teams to navigate climate-smart markets for wood procurement through pre-design, design, and construction phases and support sale. Carbon impacts of climate-smart timber purchasing is planned to be estimated by comparing the difference in carbon intensity for participating landowners against regional benchmarks of the carbon intensity of commodity timber production from industrial forestlands. Forest biomass and carbon stocks are planned to be measured using satellite imagery. A simple user-friendly web application is also planned to be scoped and developed to deliver carbon impact metrics per unit of roundwood which can then be converted into carbon impacts for specific end-products. The project work plans to recognize and make accessible the entirety of the Pacific Northwest climate-smart timber supply chain, track and trace the flow of fiber from source forests, through mills and processing, and into ten construction projects. To allow the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) community to differentiate between wood products based on forest carbon and associated ecosystem impacts, the project plans to build a simple, user-friendly web application that covers the contiguous U.S. This tool is planned to be designed with input from the intended end users, the AEC community, to ensure meeting their needs and providing them with an easy-to-use solution. In addition, contract payments to sawmills are planned to drive participation to grow transparency and data about log supply, as well as offer price premiums for sales of climate-smart wood to an interested buyer. Landowner sales incentives are planned to offer a premium to landowners for selling their wood to a participating sawmill. Producer payments are planned to focus on tribal partners, supporting culturally informed forest restoration work that partners would like to pursue on ancestral lands. Ecotrust also plans to engage in technical assistance and co-production of forest impact assessment deep dives involving Measurement, Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MMRV) activities with several tribes. These deep dives will characterize embodied carbon and other quantifiable impacts associated with tribal forest management. The intent of these deep dives is to increase tribal capacity and readiness to engage in marketing of tribal timber as a climate-smart commodity.\n\nLead Partner: Sustainable Northwest\n\nOther Major Partners: EcoTrust, Northwest Natural Resources Group, Trout Mountain Forestry, Vibrant Planet Data Commons, Washington Conservation Action, Virbrant Planet Public Benefit Corporation, Pierce Conservation District\n\nPrimary States Expected: CA, OR, WA, Tribal\n\nMajor Commodities: Forest Products\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $25,000,000\n\nCalifornia Dairy Research Foundation Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities Project\n\nThis project will build climate-smart dairy markets and provide financial incentives for dairy producers to adopt climate-smart manure management practices to reduce methane emissions, leveraging matching funding from non-federal sources. Financial incentives are planned on a per-cow basis to producers to implement vermifiltration, evaporative liquid waste processing systems, subsurface drip fertigation using liquid manure, weeping walls, aerated static compost piles, and others. On average producers will likely receive incentives that account for 30 to 50 percent of their total costs of Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry practice adoption, while also receiving a premium for the climate-smart milk. This project plans to utilize partnerships designed to market climate-smart milk for a higher premium and conduct a consumer market messaging analysis to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of approaches to best promote climate-smart milk in multiple market channels. The project plans to have producers quantify estimated on-farm methane emissions reductions through a web-based calculator, and have universities provide in-field verification measurements of greenhouse gas (GHG) and nitrogen excess reductions. Verification of practice implementation is planned to be through producer documentation and post-project site visit. The project plans for at least 10 percent of producer incentives to go to small and underserved producers and to provide partial advance payments to those producers. CDFA-funded technical service providers would work one-on-one with producers to help them evaluate practices and prepare an application to be considered for producer incentives, which will be particularly impactful to small and underserved producers, who may not have the resources or support to fully execute this task.\n\nLead Partner: California Dairy Research Foundation\n\nOther Major Partners: California Department of Food and Agriculture, California Association of Resource Conservation Districts, California Milk Advisory Board, Dairy Cares, California Dairy Campaign, California Dairy Quality Assurance Program, Milk Producers Council, National Milk Producers Federation, Sustainable Conservation, Western United Dairies, California Farm Bureau Federation, University of California, Davis, University of California, Riverside, University of California Cooperative Extension, Truterra, California Dairies, Inc., Challenge Dairy Products, Nestlé\n\nPrimary States Expected: CA\n\nMajor Commodities: Dairy\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $85,000,000\n\nClimate Beneficial Fiber: Building New, Accessible, and Equitable Market Opportunities for Climate-Smart Cotton and Wool\n\nThis project will expand the existing Climate Beneficial™ fiber program: a system for sequestering carbon, regenerating soil health and resilience, improving social equity, and bolstering America's ability to produce climate-smart fiber. A newly created, open-source, Carbon Farm Planning and Verification Platform will streamline climate-smart agriculture planning and verification for producers, verifiers, and supply chain stakeholders. The project plans to have a trained Planner monitor implementation, ensuring that practices are implemented in accordance with practice standard criteria linked to the COMET tools. A Portal database architecture is planned to allow for anticipated and realized GHG benefits to be queried by project, region, commodity, or dollar expended, allowing these data to be aggregated and analyzed at various scales. Within each fiber commodity and region, the project plans to help producers negotiate a price premium that provides enhanced commodity value for Climate Beneficial fiber while building stronger and more resilient direct market relationships. Our approach is informed by market pricing thresholds and production costs that include the price of Carbon Farm Planning and implementation. This project aims to meet the equity goals of the Justice40 Initiative, directing at least 40% of project benefits to small, beginning, socially disadvantaged, veteran, limited resource, and women farmers, as well as producers growing specialty crops.\n\nLead Partner: National Center for Appropriate Technology, Inc.\n\nOther Major Partners: Carbon Cycle Institute, Colorado State University Dept of Soil and Crop Sciences, Fibershed, Seed 2 Shirt, New York Textile Lab\n\nPrimary States Expected: CA, GA, IN, MT, NC, NY, SD, TN, WY\n\nMajor Commodities: Agroforestry, Cotton, Sheep, Wool\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $30,000,000\n\nClimate SMART (Scaling Mechanisms for Agriculture’s Regenerative Transformation)\n\nThis project, which will reach across 43 states, aims to catalyze a self-sustaining, market-based network to broaden farmer access, scale adoption of climate-smart practices, and sustainably produce grain and dairy commodities with verified and quantified climate benefits. Truterra plans to work with food and ag companies to acquire project grown climate-smart commodities. Truterra’s quantification methodology would include a modeled-plus-measured approach to quantify GHG removals, using a field-level calibrated version of the DayCent model for both the baseline (producer’s actual prior practices) and the current state with new practice. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines would be used to determine emissions from all sources that cannot be effectively modeled using DAYCENT and WEPP (used to determine energy demand of field passes based on crop operations); model runs would be supported by soil sampling stratified by soil (physiochemical class, soil textural class, and soil drainage class), management (Generalized Tillage Intensity Rating (gTIR) for each of the past six years, grouped into low- or medium-tillage), and climate (temperature and effective precipitation). Truterra plans to work with Food and Ag companies to 1) better understand the commodity production practices in their supply chain, 2) identify geographies where working with producers on CSC will have the most impact, 3) deploy resources through the Network to create a “supply” of practice change, and 4) procure the resulting GHG or other ecosystem service assets. This system would enable food companies to acquire CSCs, rewards producers for producing them, and offers Network members an incentive payment for helping make it happen. The project plans to equip 11 underserved producer organizations with access to the Truterra sustainability tool, services and programs, and provide targeted support on approximately hundreds of thousands of acres as well as train Black Climate-Smart Agronomists through internships/fellowships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) throughout the Southeast. The project also plans to provide priority access to all project technical and financial assistance opportunities and train and incentivize 10 or more underserved producers to host Farmer Peer Networks.\n\nLead Partner: Truterra, LLC\n\nOther Major Partners: Ag Gateway, Biofiltro, Continuum Ag, ESRI, Equilibrium Capital, Farmobile, FarmRaise, John Deere, La Crosse Seed, Macquarie, Microsoft, Northern Star Seed, Sound Ag, Strand Gard Stewardship, WinField United, American Farmland Trust, Black Family Land Trust, Farm Credit Council, Federation of Southern Cooperatives, Minorities in Agriculture, Natural Resources and Related Sciences, Soil Health Institute, Butcher Box, Campbell Soup, Green Plains, Hershey, Land O’Lakes Dairy Foods, Nestle Purina, Perdue, Primient, Tate & Lyle, Cloud Ag, Colorado State University, SustainCERT & 50 ag retail cooperatives, Venture37 Services, United States Biochar Initiative, OpenTEAM, Allied Soil Health Services, Western NY Crop Management Association, Agricultural Consulting Services\n\nPrimary States Expected: AL, AZ, AR, CA, CO, DE, FL, GA, ID, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NJ, NY, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WA, WV, WI, WY\n\nMajor Commodities: Corn, Cotton, Dairy, Soybeans, Wheat\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $90,000,000\n\nClimate-Smart Agriculture that is Profitable, Regenerative, Actionable, and Trustworthy (CARAT)\n\nThis project will enable partners to expand climate-smart markets and work with dairy producers in PA to implement climate-smart agriculture. An overarching goal is establishing successful and profitable partnerships between diverse producers, including underserved producers, and consumers, leading to a reduction of greenhouse gases, suppressing methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and storage of carbon. The proposal plans to market climate-smart milk by utilizing the CARAT advisory board to connect with companies interested in purchasing greenhouse gas credits or climate-smart milk. The project plans to utilize COMET-Planner, COMET-Farm, and CARAT-CALCULATOR. The goal is that funds devoted to small producers and underserved populations exceed 50% of funds allocated to technical assistance and incentives. It is estimated that about one third of participating farms would be small with representation proportional to the community of Plain-Sect., women owned farms and new and Beginning farmers. The project also plans to engage the large Latino workforces employed on dairy farms.\n\nLead Partner: Pennsylvania State University\n\nOther Major Partners: Center for Dairy Excellence, Proagrica, Professional Dairy Managers of Pennsylvania, Red Barn Consulting\n\nPrimary States Expected: PA\n\nMajor Commodities: Agroforestry, Dairy\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $25,000,000\n\nClimate-Smart Camelina\n\nThis large-scale pilot project aims to measure and validate the climate-smart advantages of camelina sativa (L.) in both rotational and winter cover crop production systems and build associate climate-smart biofuels markets. The project will accelerate farmer adoption of camelina as a non-food crop grown on idle acres to produce more plant-based feedstock for renewable biofuels and chemicals with low carbon intensity and no land-use change while increasing carbon capture in the soil.

The project plans to implement a wide variety of on-the-ground climate-smart practices including reduced tillage, strip-tillage, forest farming, and cover crops. The project aims to increase resilience for smallholders Puerto Rican coffee farmers, their families, and their communities by increasing the diversification of crops grown in Multi-story Perennial Cropping systems. Given that Puerto Ricans rely on imports for more than 85% their food supply, farmers’ ability to expand into citrus, plantains, bananas, cacao, and other crops for local and for home consumption would have significant economic and food security benefits. Due to limitation of USDA’s COMET Planner in PR, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or other U.S. Territories, the project plans to use the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) Carbon Calculator (http://afolucarbon.org). Developed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Winrock International, the AFOLU Carbon Calculator (ACC) uses Intergovernmental Panel on Climate CO2 Change (IPCC)-based accounting methods to assess and quantify sequestration potential of a range of AFOLU practices, including agroforestry, cropland management, and grazing land management. Third-party verifier SustainCERT plans to verify the greenhouse gas benefits generated by the project and its associated processes. NCBA CLUSA plans to work with several commodity buyers to market CSCs produced through this pilot project (large market chains, National Restaurant Association, hospitality sector, and McDonalds). The PRFA has a “100% Puerto Rico” seal it uses for locally produced products and has agreed to extend the seal for 100% PR Climate-Smart Coffee for differentiation. The project also plans to engage Rainforest Alliance, a leading third-party certifier for certification of CSAF coffee for export to external markets. Beyond the quantifiable benefits to farmers’ bottom lines, the diversification of crops grown in Multi-story Perennial Cropping systems would increase resilience for smallholders Puerto Rican coffee farmers, their families, and their communities. Given that Puerto Ricans rely on imports for more than 85% their food supply, farmers’ ability to expand into citrus, plantains, bananas, cacao, and other crops for local and for home consumption would have significant economic and food security benefits. PROCAFÉ estimates that this project would enroll thousands of coffee farmers in PR (where the vast majority of producers are underserved).\n\nLead Partner: Cooperative League of the United States of America\n\nOther Major Partners: Productores de Café de Puerto Rico, University of Puerto Rico, National Co+op Grocers, Fondo de Inversión y Desarrollo Cooperativo, La Liga de Cooperativas de Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico Farmers Association, SustainCERT\n\nPrimary States Expected: PR\n\nMajor Commodities: Coffee, Citrus, Plantains, Bananas, Cacao, Lumber\n\nApproximate Funding Ceiling: $15,000,000\n\nNew England Climate-Smart Forest Partnership Project\n\nThis project will implement forest management practices with large commercial producers and smaller woodlot and Tribal owners to store more carbon in the forest, quantify the resulting carbon gains, and build markets for climate-smart forest products to store carbon in wood products and substitute wood products for fossil fuel-based materials. The project aims to include Climate-smart forestry practices like reduced impact logging, timber stand improvement thinning, maintaining legacy trees and brown ash as a component of New England’s forests, as well as maintain cultural integrity and economy of First Nations. This project plans to utilize the monitoring and verification program created by AFF and TNC for the Family Forest Carbon Program (FFCP) that provides a sophisticated methodology for determining carbon stocking and can differentiate between areas treated with practices and the surrounding landscape. The program plans to advance markets for climate-smart forest products with a focus on high-value wood in the mass timber sector. The project plans to engage affordable housing agencies across the region in utilizing mass timber construction. The project aims to include a combination of small landowners and tribal representatives. Practice implementation incentives should increase the demand for climate-smart forest products, over time, improve the economics of climate-smart forest management and wood production.\n\nLead Partner: New England Forestry Foundation\n\nOther Major Partners: Seven Islands, Weyerhauser, Wagner Woodlands, Baskahegan Land Company, Robbins Lumber, Passamaquoddy Forestry Department, University of Maine, The Nature Conservancy, Woodlands Partnership of Northwest Massachusetts, Massachusetts Tree Farm Program, Hull Forestlands, L.P., Heyes Family Forests, LLC, Trust to Conserve Northeast Forestlands, American Forest Foundation, Spa"
