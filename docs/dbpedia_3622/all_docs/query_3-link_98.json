With greater computing power and state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning algorithms, AI is approaching a new era where large multimodal models dominate the AI landscape. Reports suggest the multimodal AI market will grow by 35% annually to USD 4.5 billion by 2028 as the demand for analyzing extensive unstructured data increases. These models can comprehend multiple data modalities simultaneously and generate more accurate predictions than their traditional counterparts. In this article, we will discuss what multimodal models are, how they work, the top models in 2024, current challenges, and future trends. What are Multimodal Models? Multimodal models are AI deep-learning models that simultaneously process different modalities, such as text, video, audio, and image, to generate outputs. Multimodal frameworks contain mechanisms to integrate multimodal data collected from multiple sources for more context-specific and comprehensive understanding. In contrast, unimodal models use traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms to process a single data modality simultaneously. For instance, You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a popular object detection model that only understands visual data. Unimodal vs. Multimodal Framework While unimodal models are less complex than multimodal algorithms, multimodal systems offer greater accuracy and enhanced user experience. Due to these benefits, multimodal frameworks are helpful in multiple industrial domains. For instance, manufacturers use autonomous mobile robots that process data from multiple sensors to localize objects. Moreover, healthcare professionals use multimodal models to diagnose diseases using medical images and patient history reports. How Multimodal Models Work? Although multimodal models have varied architectures, most frameworks have a few standard components. A typical architecture includes an encoder, a fusion mechanism, and a decoder. Architecture Encoders Encoders transform raw multimodal data into machine-readable feature vectors or embeddings that models use as input to understand the data’s content. Embeddings Multimodal models often have three types of encoders for each data type - image, text, and audio. Image Encoders: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a popular choice for an image encoder. CNNs can convert image pixels into feature vectors to help the model understand critical image properties. Text Encoders: Text encoders transform text descriptions into embeddings that models can use for further processing. They often use transformer models like those in Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) frameworks. Audio Encoders: Audio encoders convert raw audio files into usable feature vectors that capture critical audio patterns, including rhythm, tone, and context. Wav2Vec2 is a popular choice for learning audio representations. Fusion Mechanism Strategies Once the encoders transform multiple modalities into embeddings, the next step is to combine them so the model can understand the broader context reflected in all data types. Developers can use various fusion strategies according to the use case. The list below mentions key fusion strategies. Early Fusion: Combines all modalities before passing them to the model for processing. Intermediate Fusion: Projects each modality onto a latent space and fuses the latent representations for further processing. Late Fusion: Processes all modalities in their raw form and fuses the output for each. Hybrid Fusion: Combines early, intermediate, and late fusion strategies at different model processing phases. Fusion Mechanism Methods While the list above mentions the high-level fusion strategies, developers can use multiple methods within each strategy to fuse the relevant modalities. Attention-based Methods Attention-based methods use the transformer architecture to convert embeddings from multiple modalities into a query-key-value structure. The technique emerged from a seminal paper - Attention is All You Need - published in 2017. Researchers initially employed the method for improving language models, as attention networks allowed these models to have longer context windows. However, developers now use attention-based methods in other domains, including computer vision (CV) and generative AI. Attention networks allow models to understand relationships between embeddings for context-aware processing. Cross-modal attention frameworks fuse different modalities in a multimodal context according to the inter-relationships between each data type. For instance, an attention filter will allow the model to understand which parts of a text prompt relate to an image’s visual embeddings, leading to a more efficient fusion output. Concatenation Concatenation is a straightforward fusion technique that merges multiple embeddings into a single feature representation. For instance, the method will concatenate a textual embedding with a visual feature vector to generate a consolidated multimodal feature. The method helps in intermediate fusion strategies by combining the latent representations for each modality. Dot-Product The dot-product method involves element-wise multiplication of feature vectors from different modalities. It helps capture the interactions and correlations between modalities, assisting models to understand the commonalities among different data types. However, it only helps in cases where the feature vectors do not suffer from high dimensionality. Taking dot-products of high-dimensional vectors may require extensive computational power and result in features that only capture common patterns between modalities, disregarding critical nuances. Decoders The last component is a decoder network that processes the feature vectors from different modalities to produce the required output. Decoders can contain cross-modal attention networks to focus on different parts of input data and produce relevant outputs. For instance, translation models often use cross-attention techniques to understand the meanings of sentences in different languages simultaneously. Recurrent neural network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) frameworks are popular choices for constructing decoders to perform tasks involving sequential, visual, or generative processes. Learn how multimodal models work in our detailed guide on multimodal learning Multimodal Models - Use Cases With recent advancements in multimodal models, AI systems can perform complex tasks involving the simultaneous integration and interpretation of multiple modalities. The capabilities allow users to implement AI in large-scale environments with extensive and diverse data sources requiring robust processing pipelines. The list below mentions a few of these tasks that multimodal models perform efficiently. Visual Question-Answering (VQA): VQA involves a model answering user queries regarding visual content. For instance, a healthcare professional may ask a multimodal model regarding the content of an X-ray scan. By combining visual and textual prompts, multimodal models provide relevant and accurate responses to help users perform VQA. Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image Search: Multimodal models help users build powerful search engines that can type natural language queries to search for particular images. They can also build systems that retrieve relevant documents in response to image-based queries. For instance, a user may give an image as input to prompt the system to search for relevant blogs and articles containing the image. Generative AI: Generative AI models help users with text and image generation tasks that require multimodal capabilities. For instance, multimodal models can help users with image captioning, where they ask the model to generate relevant labels for a particular image. They can also use these models for natural language processing (NLP) use cases that involve generating textual descriptions based on video, image, or audio data. Image Segmentation: Image segmentation involves dividing an image into regions to distinguish between different elements within an image. Segmentation Multimodal models can help users perform segmentation more quickly by segmenting areas automatically based on textual prompts. For instance, users can ask the model to segment and label items in the image’s background. Top Multimodal Models Multimodal models are an active research area where experts build state-of-the-art frameworks to address complex issues using AI. The following sections will briefly discuss the latest models to help you understand how multimodal AI is evolving to solve real-world problems in multiple domains. CLIP Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) is a multimodal vision-language model by OpenAI that performs image classification tasks. It pairs descriptions from textual datasets with corresponding images to generate relevant image labels. CLIP Key Features Contrastive Framework: CLIP uses the contrastive loss function to optimize its learning objective. The approach minimizes a distance function by associating relevant text descriptions with related images to help the model understand which text best describes an image’s content. Text and Image Encoders: The architecture uses a transformer-based text encoder and a Vision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder. Zero-shot Capability: Once CLIP learns to associate text with images, it can quickly generalize to new data and generate relevant captions for new unseen images without task-specific fine-tuning. Use Case Due to CLIP’s versatility, CLIP can help users perform multiple tasks, such as image annotation for creating training data, image retrieval for AI-based search systems, and generation of textual descriptions based on image prompts.

Robotic Process Automation: Key Differences\n\nRobotic Process Automation (RPA) and Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) are software technologies that automate business processes to reduce human efforts and deliver maximum productivity to organizations. RPA automates repetitive and manual processes such as opening email attachments, extracting data, filling out forms, etc. These tasks do not require complex decision-making per se. On the other hand, IPA uses intelligent decision-making algorithms related to machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and other such areas to automate complex workflows requiring human intelligence. According to a recent market report by Grand View Research, RPA's revenue share of the total cognitive process automation market size (~USD 4.87 billion) was 63% in 2022. Meanwhile, the IPA market is expected to grow 29.6% from 2023 to 2030. In this article, we will learn about RPA and IPA, their key differences, and their applicability in the industry. Understanding RPA The main aim of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is to use software robots to automate frequently performed, time-consuming human actions. RPA is best suited for tedious tasks that require minimal decision-making, such as data entry, invoice processing, report generation, and customer data updates. These tasks typically follow a rule-based approach and require little cognitive ability. Benefits of RPA Increased Efficiency: RPA completes processes faster and more accurately, saving time and costs. Cost Savings: By reducing labor costs, RPA allows employees to focus on higher-value activities that require more cognition. Improved Accuracy: RPA eliminates the risk of human errors associated with manual data entry and repetitive tasks. Enhanced Scalability: RPA can easily scale to meet business needs and handle the increased workload. 24/7 Operations: Since RPA bots can work continuously, processes can be operated around the clock for fast turnaround times. Limitations of RPA Limited Cognitive Capabilities: RPA can only perform tasks that adhere to strict rules and instructions—it cannot handle complex decision-making. Dependency on Structured Data: RPAs are not well suited to handle unstructured data such as free-form text, audio, or images. Integration Challenges: Integrating RPA with some legacy systems or applications can be challenging due to compatibility issues or data security concerns, as these systems may lack proper APIs or have strict access controls. Maintenance and Monitoring: RPA bots require periodic monitoring and updates, so organizations must allocate resources for troubleshooting and maintenance.

IPA Vs. RPA: Key Differences As businesses explore automation solutions to improve efficiency and reduce costs, it's crucial to understand the differences between IPA and RPA. While both technologies aim to automate tasks, their capabilities, scope, and integration requirements differ. Let's dive into the key differences between IPA and RPA. Different Components of IPA Technology Differences RPA relies on rule-based automation, following predefined instructions to complete tasks. In contrast, IPA integrates AI technologies, enabling cognitive automation and advanced analytics. This allows IPA systems to learn, adapt, and make decisions based on data patterns and insights. Scope of Tasks RPA is well-suited for repetitive, rule-based tasks that require minimal decision-making, such as data entry, file transfers, and simple calculations. On the other hand, IPA can handle complex cognitive tasks that require problem-solving and decision-making capabilities, such as fraud detection, customer sentiment analysis, and intelligent document processing. Data Environment In a standardized format, RPA works best with structured data, such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. However, IPA can handle structured and unstructured data, including audio calls, videos, and IoT data. This enables IPA to extract insights from a wider range of data sources and automate more diverse processes. Recommended Read: Structured Vs. Unstructured Data: What is the Difference? Adaptability RPA systems are rule-bound and static, meaning they don't easily adapt to changing environments or requirements without manual intervention. In contrast, IPA systems are learnable and continuously improve through ML algorithms. This adaptability allows IPA to optimize processes and respond to evolving business needs. For example, an IPA system in customer service can learn from past interactions to provide more personalized and efficient support over time. Scalability IPA offers greater scalability for handling complex tasks and large data volumes than RPA. As businesses grow and their automation needs expand, IPA's ability to learn and adapt makes it better suited to scale alongside the organization. RPA may face limitations in certain applications due to its reliance on predefined rules and lack of cognitive capabilities. Integration with Existing Systems RPA systems can often be implemented more independently and integrated with legacy systems without significant modifications. However, IPA systems require seamless integration with AI technologies and diverse data sources to unlock their full potential. This integration process may be more complex and time-consuming as it involves ensuring compatibility and data flow between various components of the IPA solution and existing enterprise systems. Considerations for Choosing Between IPA and RPA When deciding between Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Intelligent Process Automation (IPA), organizations must carefully evaluate several key factors to ensure their automation initiatives align with their strategic goals and objectives. Businesses can make informed decisions and select the most appropriate automation solution for their needs by considering the following aspects. Nature of Tasks: If the tasks to be automated are primarily repetitive and rule-based, RPA may be sufficient. However, IPA may be more appropriate if the tasks involve deriving insights and analysis. Scope of Automation: If automation is required for specific tasks within a department or function, RPA is a better choice. IPA should be chosen if the goal is to automate and streamline complex cognitive tasks across multiple departments or functions. Integration with AI Technologies: IPA may be viable if the organization has the expertise and infrastructure to integrate AI technologies into automation initiatives. Otherwise, RPA may be a more practical choice. Data Availability: If the tasks involve structured, well-defined data sets, RPA may be sufficient. However, IPA may be necessary to analyze unstructured data, dynamic processes, or real-time insights. Regulatory and Compliance Considerations: Consider regulatory requirements and compliance standards that may impact automation initiatives. Ensure that chosen automation solutions adhere to data protection regulations, ethical guidelines, and industry standards, especially in sensitive healthcare, finance, and legal domains. Cost and ROI: Evaluate the costs of implementing and maintaining automation initiatives, including software licensing fees, infrastructure, and personnel expenses. Consider the potential ROI regarding efficiency gains, cost savings, productivity improvements, and strategic value. For example, a financial institution looking to automate its customer onboarding process may choose IPA over RPA due to the need to analyze unstructured data from various sources, ensure compliance with stringent regulations, and the potential for significant ROI through improved customer experience and reduced processing times. Need for Intelligent Automation Strategy An Intelligent Automation (IA) strategy plays a crucial role in the growth and success of any organization.

The massive size of these models leads to high latency and computational costs during inference. This makes it difficult to deploy them in real-world scenarios with strict performance requirements. Knowledge distillation offers a promising solution to this challenge by enabling knowledge transfer from large, cumbersome models to smaller, more efficient ones. It involves a set of techniques that transfer the knowledge embedded within a large, complex CV model (the \"teacher\") into a smaller, more computationally efficient model (the \"student\"). This allows for faster, more cost-effective deployment without significantly sacrificing performance. In this article, we will discuss: The concepts, types, methods, and algorithms used in knowledge distillation How can this technique streamline and scale model deployment workflows, enabling large AI models in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments? Practical considerations and trade-offs when applying knowledge distillation in real-world settings. Let’s get into it. Knowledge Distillation - An Overview Knowledge distillation (KD) is a technique that reduces the size and inference time of deep learning models while maintaining their performance. It involves transferring knowledge from a large, complex model to a smaller, simpler neural network. The larger model, called the teacher model, can consist of multiple layers with many parameters. In comparison, the smaller model, the student model, contains only a few layers with a modest number of parameters. Hinton’s Approach to Knowledge Distillation In their seminal paper \"Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network\" (2015), Geoffrey Hinton and his co-authors proposed using soft labels to train a student model. Instead of hard labels (one-hot vectors), soft labels provide a probability distribution for classification scores. For instance, a complex image classification network may classify a dog's image as a dog with a 90% probability, a cat with a 9% probability, and a car with a 1% probability. Hard Label vs. Soft Label Hard Label Vs. Soft Label: What's the Difference A soft label will associate these probabilities with each label for a corresponding image instead of the one-hot vector used in hard labels. Hinton’s approach involved using a teacher model to predict soft labels for a large dataset. It then uses a smaller transfer set with these labels to train a student model on cross-entropy loss. The method helps improve generalization performance by ensuring less variance between gradients for different training samples. Model Compression vs. Model Distillation Rich Caruana and his colleagues at Cornell University proposed a method they call \"model compression,\" which is a general case of knowledge distillation. While Caruana's technique also uses labels predicted by a teacher model to train a student model, the objective is to match the logits (pre-softmax activations) between the student and teacher models. Logit matching becomes necessary because the soft labels may have negligible probabilities for some classes. Hinton overcomes this issue by modifying the temperature parameter in the softmax function to generate more suitable probabilities for model distillation. Need for Knowledge Distillation While large deep-learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance for offline experiments, they can be challenging to deploy in production environments. These environments often have resource constraints and real-time requirements, necessitating efficient and fast models. Production systems must process extensive data streams and instantly generate results to provide a good user experience. Knowledge distillation addresses these challenges by enabling: Model Compression Compressed models with fewer layers are essential for quick deployment in production. The compression method must be efficient to ensure no information loss. Faster Inference Smaller models with low latency and high throughput are crucial for processing real-time data quickly and generating accurate predictions. Knowledge distillation allows you to achieve both objectives by transferring relevant knowledge from large, deep neural networks to a small student network. Components of Knowledge Distillation While multiple knowledge distillation frameworks exist, they all involve three essential components: knowledge, a distillation algorithm, and a teacher-student architecture. Knowledge In the context of knowledge distillation, knowledge refers to the learned function that maps input to output vectors. For example, an image classification model learns a function that maps input images to output class probabilities. Distilling knowledge implies approximating the complex function learned by the teacher model through a simpler mapping in the student model. Distillation Algorithm The distillation algorithm transfers knowledge from the teacher network to the student model. Common distillation algorithms include soft target distillation, where the student learns to mimic the teacher's soft output probab"
