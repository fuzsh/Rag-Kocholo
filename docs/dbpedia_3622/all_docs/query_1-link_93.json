        "text": "1. DES’S INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT AND REASERCH PGDM-II (2014-2016) Marketing Strategy Case Study – Tata GoldPlus SubmittedTo: SubmittedBy: Prof. GiribalaDewasthale Tushar Bhadalkar\n\n2. Executive Summary Question01: What Strategies should GoldPlus adopt to compete in market? Answer01: Competitors Analysis – Major Players - Gitanja li, Adora, Ciemme (Tier-3&4, Guj, Central & Northeast) limited edition rural designs), Kisna (18 Carat Maharashtra & Gujarat – 1000 retailers, designs every 4 months.) South Indian Competitors – Joy Allukas, Jose Allukas, Kalyan Jewelers, Kumaran Jewelers, Bhima Jewellers, and Malabar Gold in Tamil Nadu and Khazana and Md. Khan Jewellers in Andhra Pradesh. They offered new designs and lower prices with assured buybacks & incentives schemes. Tata GoldPlus should adopt below strategy to compete with them - 1. Design Differentiation & Studded Jewellery 2. Positioning of Brand not as Premium only – Store design as per local taste, lower pricing products, ads to local newspaper and local events. 3. Market Focus – TN, AP, Kerala, Karnataka – 800 tonnes consumed. 4. Target Small Fragmented Players (30800Cr), Big family/regional players (14,200Cr) 5. Easy Gold Loans – To lure women in age group 18 to 55 years to purchase the gold when they require. Question02: How can GoldPlus compete with inundated unorganised jewellery mom- pop stores? Answer02: The mom-pop stores sold on transaction driven by long term relationships their bonding was very strong, so even if they gave poor shopping experience, lack of transparency, inconsistent pricing, traditional designs, low caratage, they dominated the market share. Target Small Fragmented Players (30,800Cr). Brandedjewellery is sold as their own product without using the label by small shop owners. Unsure Quality - Buying of 22 carat but while selling its 18 carat. (Decision based on discount and gifts.) The shop owners subcontract work to others difficult to stock and quality control.\n\n3. Tata had to take a lot of effort starting from establishing trust, transparency and quality.  Transparency (Karatmeter) in business by customer visit to factory who are early adopters and innovators.  Retail experience by store layout that were designed as local needs.  HallMark Scheme – Assured Purity by strict quality measures to stop fraud base metal have gold polishing and adulteration using alloy.  Design – New designs and Styles that according to customer taste and preferences. “Mystery Audit” helped to fill these gaps for offering better products Question03: Would it be advisable to launch the brand in the Delhi NCR market, given the profile of the rural and semi urban customers in this region? What problems are they likely to face while implementing this expansion strategy? Answer03: Customer Market Segmentation – 1. Market is unorganised, unprofessional, unscrupulous and fragmented. 2. Jewellery – 80% domestic demand (40% Urban & 60% small cities, semi- urban and rural. Small town buyers who stick to local store due to strong bonding.) 3. Investor Demand – 15% 4. Industrial Use – 5% The North Market is completely different than South India’s buying behaviour. Consumers in South are emotional and are driven by family values. For example, they do not buy diamonds because of the firm belief of Dosha  North Buying Behaviour - 37 percent bought gold more than twice a year; about 28 percent bought gold because of peer pressure while 50 percent bought for investment purpose.  North Indian customers whose gold purchase is driven by peer pressure and demonstration effect.  In North it was used as status symbol during the occasions like wedding. Tata understood the difference in the buying behaviour and the problems while implementation likely to face were lack of trust on branded stores, preference to gems and precious stones over gold which changes the category of product. Right location of Franchisees in small cities and rural areas. The plans for expansion are necessary to achieve economies of Scale\n\n4. Question04: What innovative strategies can GoldPlus adopt to increase its market share in the Indian market? Answer04: Tata GoldPlus was already educating villagers, promoting through right mix of product, price and events. Pilot Strategy –  Region Specific: The brand targeted the Southern Indian Cities where maximum consumption of Gold with reasonable pricing.  Shopping Experience - Retail strategy was developed on the location, ambience, and experience at the store, with the idea of making the environment conducive for a perfect gold shopping experience.  Layout - Display windows and panels, outlook of store.  Sponsoring - Sponsored various local events and took initiatives to make a place in the hearts of the people.  Opportunity – No middlemen direct hiring karigars.  Pricing & Products - Variety to choose from ready-to-wear jewellery and value-for-money products. GoldPlus decided to create a promo which would grab the attention of the target customer; it created a 24.5 kg gold bangle that gave it an entry into the Limca Book of Records and took the bangle on a roadshow in 17 towns. Competitions were organized around the same theme like a ‘guess the weight of the bangle’ contest. The company also offered a photo opportunity to visitors, with options to mail their photographs to five of their acquaintances. Gold Paper Slip - Innovative promotions include new store openings being preceded by distribution of gold paper slips to potential customers in a 3-5 km asking visit to customers. Gold Bill - Similar promotions are conducted inside hotels by offering a free sweet dish and a paper coin along with the bill or gold paper with flowers while leaving a temple. Events - Small and big events that team GoldPlus conducts throughout the year. These events are aimed at bringing out the talent of locals. Golden Chariot – 1,500 villages in three months was covered by GoldPlus custom- built bus called the thanga ratham (gold chariot) which goes from village to village in Tamil Nadu with an on-board video educational campaign.\n\n5. Trust & Factory Visit - GoldPlus invites more than 40 customers to visit their Hosur factory and has an interacttive session with them. Caratmeter - Customers are then encouraged to come and check the purity of the gold they already own using this. Avail of services like cleaning and polishing their jewellery free of cost.

Tieup Apparel Store – For wedding shoppers at the ethnic apparel stores will get special offers for GoldPlus jewellery. Customisation – Giving customer options to make customization in jewellery and delivery in less time. Question 05: As Brand Manager of GoldPlus, what strategies would you have recommended for strengthening Tata Gold Plus brand? Answer 05: As Brand Manager strengthening can be done by Sustainable Competitive Advantage, by matching resources and capability with Key Success Factors of Tata. 1. Tata advantage of brand name hence they can also Tap Womens Schools/Colleges to conduct contest, vocational courses and give them information about purity and quality of gold to talk with their parents (in future these parents are buying gold for daughter’s marriage). 2. Focus - There are more occasions like Women’s Day, Valentine Day, Anniversary, Birthday’s, Karva Chaut, Mother’s Day which can be promoted by shopping invitation cards or other activities. 3. Focus - Mass Media as reach of print is low and due to low literacy rate. So occasionally using Radio channel which is most used in rural areas. 4. Low Price Artifical Diamonds & Light Weight Jewellery - Nano coated diamonds of less cost can be promoted. Now trending is light weight jewellery for daily use which can be made more attractive to suit rural needs by GoldPlus."
