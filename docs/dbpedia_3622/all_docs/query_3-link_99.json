        "text": "Biden slams Trump and his allies for calling the hush money verdict ‘rigged’\n\nIn his first remarks since a New York jury found Donald Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, President Joe Biden took a thinly veiled swipe at the former president’s attacks on the justice system.\n\n“It’s reckless, it’s dangerous, it’s irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don’t like the verdict,” Biden said, speaking to reporters at the White House.\n\nThe president’s comments came hours after Trump blamed him for his legal woes in remarks to the press and supporters, saying: “This is all done by Biden and his people. This is done by Washington. No one has ever seen anything like this.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nFinal day of Trump trial whiplashes from sleepy courtroom to historic verdict\n\nFor most of Thursday, there were few signs of life from the jury in Donald Trump’s hush money trial.\n\nThat all changed shortly after 4 p.m., when the panel of 12 New Yorkers delivered a note to the judge saying they had reached a verdict in the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president.\n\nFollow live updates here.\n\nThe jury foreperson read the verdict aloud just feet from Trump, who has spent more than six weeks in court listening to testimony from 22 witnesses. Moments earlier, Trump and his legal team were in good spirits, with defense attorney Todd Blanche laughing and Trump smiling.\n\nIt took the jury less than two days to find Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, guilty on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nHere’s what happened on Day 23 — the final day — of Trump’s hush money trial.\n\n‘Access Hollywood’ vs. now: How the GOP learned to stand behind Trump\n\nAlmost eight years ago, key figures in the Republican Party distanced themselves from Donald Trump after the “Access Hollywood” video revealed him making lewd and aggressive comments about women.\n\nThen-House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., disinvited Trump from a campaign event. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, asked him to step down as the GOP nominee. And then-Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, withdrew his endorsement.\n\n“I’m out. I can no longer in good conscience endorse this person for president. It is some of the most abhorrent and offensive comments that you can possibly imagine,” Chaffetz said in October 2016.\n\nThen Trump won the presidency just a month later.\n\nSince then — after two impeachments, a 2020 presidential defeat and multiple indictments — today’s Republican Party has learned to stand 100% behind Trump when it is faced with bad news about its former president and current presumptive presidential nominee.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nPennsylvania voter said she was 'relieved' by Trump verdict\n\nand\n\nHeather Dana, an Erie County voter, said she was \"relieved\" and \"happy\" after the jury's verdict in the Trump hush money case, but she added she was not expecting the jury to deliver a verdict by Thursday.\n\n\"I was kind of surprised that they all unanimously were able to come to that verdict,\" Dana said. \"I kind of thought there would be — it would take a long time, it would be hard to get everyone to decide.”\n\n\"It’s kind of time to answer to some of the things he has done,\" she said. \"He is not beyond the law’s reach\" and \"he’s just like everyone else.”\n\nTrump campaign and RNC say they raised $34.8 million online on day of verdict\n\nTeam Trump has long seen fundraising boosts pegged to Trump's legal woes and, according to a new press release from the campaign, Thursday was a massive day for Trump's election campaign.\n\nThe campaign announced it raised $34.8 million yesterday through the GOP fundraising platform WinRed. Anna Kelly, a Republican National Committee spokesperson, clarified in an email to NBC News that the total was raised into a joint fundraising committee that includes both Trump's campaign and the RNC. It's unclear how much money will go into each entity, and the national party can accept much bigger checks than the Trump campaign can. But this way of combining a nominee and the national party's fundraising haul is common in the campaign finance world.\n\nWhile every indication from the Trump campaign and the RNC is that this was a massive haul, NBC News cannot independently confirm that, both because of lags in campaign finance reporting and the byzantine way the presidential campaigns (on both sides of the aisle) raise funds.\n\nBiden campaign reacts to Trump remarks: 'This man cannot be president of the United States'\n\nIn response to Trump's remarks slamming the verdict, President Joe Biden's campaign spokesperson, Michael Tyler, said in a statement that Trump \"cannot be president of the United States.\"\n\n“America just witnessed a confused, desperate, and defeated Donald Trump ramble about his own personal grievances and lie about the American justice system, leaving anyone watching with one obvious conclusion: This man cannot be president of the United States,\" he said.\n\n\"Unhinged by his 2020 election loss and spiraling from his criminal convictions, Trump is consumed by his own thirst for revenge and retribution. He thinks this election is about him. But it’s not. It’s about the American people: lowering their costs, protecting their freedoms, defending their democracy,\" Tyler continued. He also said Trump \"is sowing chaos, attacking the rule of law, and fighting for the only thing in the world he gives a damn about: Donald Trump.”\n\nHouse 'weaponization' panel calls on DA Bragg to testify\n\nand\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee’s weaponization of government subcommittee is demanding that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and prosecutor Matthew Colangelo testify before the committee on June 13, the panel said in a post on X.\n\nThe chair of the committee, Trump ally Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, is overseeing an investigation into Bragg and Colangelo, but this is the first substantive move by House Republicans since Trump's conviction yesterday.\n\nA committee aide told NBC News that this is a request, not a subpoena. Prosecutors would be all but certain to not testify in the middle of an ongoing case, which the case will be if Trump appeals it, as expected.\n\n‘These are bad people’: Trump unloads after his historic guilty verdict\n\nLess than 24 hours after being found guilty on 34 felony counts, Donald Trump stood in front of a backdrop of American flags and was ready to get weeks of frustration off his chest.\n\nThe pugilistic former president spent 40 minutes unloading rambling comments peppered with mistruths and distortions to defend himself during a news conference at Trump Tower in Manhattan.\n\nThe event was the beginning of a new reality: Trump is now the first former president to be convicted of a crime.\n\n“This is all done by Biden and his people,” Trump said opening the news conference, continuing without evidence to directly blame President Joe Biden for his legal woes. “This is done by Washington. No one has ever seen anything like this.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nFormer White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said many Americans believe former President Trump’s conviction in his criminal hush money trial was the result of a biased judge and jury in New York.\n\nTrump says Nov. 5 is 'the most important day in the history of our country'\n\nTrump finished his remarks saying that Election Day, Nov. 5, is \"the most important day in the history of our country.\"\n\nHe then walked off without taking questions from the media.\n\nTrump calls the two impeachments against him hoaxes, disparages lawmakers who investigated Jan. 6\n\nTrump brought up the two impeachments against him — the first in 2019 and the second not long after the Jan. 6 insurrection in 2021. He called both impeachments by the House hoaxes.\n\nHe then called the House select committee that investigated the attack on the Capitol in the last Congress a \"committee of thugs.\"\n\n\"They call it select committee. I call it the unselect committee of thugs,\" he said.\n\nTrump refuted the testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, saying he didn't attack the Secret Service agent who didn't want to drive him to the Capitol after the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on the day of the insurrection.\n\n\"I supposedly went to the driver and I grabbed him around the neck,\" he said. \"And he rebuffed me, and then I went to the other guy, who I think is a black belt in karate, and he's slightly younger than me.\"\n\nTrump said a friend told him not to dispute that because it \"makes you look like the toughest cookie we've ever seen.\"\n\n\"You should have let that go on. But the fact is, it never happened. It was all made up,\" he said.\n\nTrump: 'It's not hush money'\n\nTrump repeated his claim about the nondisclosure agreement that Michael Cohen paid porn actor Stormy Daniels for, saying the related payments were legal because they were for standard NDAs.\n\n\"It’s a big deal, the nondisclosure agreement, totally honorable, totally good, totally accepted,\" Trump said. \"Every company has nondisclosure agreements.\"\n\n\"It's a disgrace,\" the former president continued, going on to emphasize that because the payments were made for NDAs, they should not be considered \"hush money.\"\n\n\"So it's not hush money. It's a nondisclosure agreement. Totally legal. Totally common,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump says he's going to appeal the verdict 'on many different things' and calls judge a 'tyrant'\n\nTrump said that \"the people of our country know it's a hoax. ... They get it, you know, they're really smart.\"\n\n\"We're going to be appealing this scam. We're going to be appealing it on many different things,\" he said.\n\nThe judge \"wouldn't allow us to have witnesses, you wouldn't allow us to talk, you wouldn't allow us to do anything,\" Trump added. \"The judge was a tyrant.\"\n\nTrump says he's going to jail for '187 years' — he could actually face a fine, probation or up to four years in prison\n\nand\n\nAs Trump railed against the verdict, calling the trial \"ridiculous,\" he claimed that he is \"going to jail for 187 years.\"\n\nAs a first-time, nonviolent offender, it is unlikely that Trump will face a long sentence — and perhaps could not even have to go jail at all.\n\nTrump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records, a class E felony that is punishable by a fine, probation or up to four years in prison per count. It’s expected that any sentence would be imposed concurrently, instead of consecutively.\n\nTrump complains about his lawyers as they watch to speech\n\nand\n\nTrump jumped back to one of his repeated defenses that he didn't know what the case was even about, adding that he was \"very upset\" with his own lawyers for not being clear about the charges being brought against him.\n\n\"Even my own lawyers, I get very upset with them because they don't say what it is,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's lawyer Todd Blanche was smiling in the crowd as Trump said this and complained that the charges didn't make sense.\n\nTrump rips judge, verdict and trial, says witnesses were 'literally crucified'\n\nTrump questioned the DA's indictment charging him with 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\n\"I paid a lawyer, totally legal. I paid a lawyer, a legal expense,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not Sheetrock construction, or any other thing. It's a legal expense. Think of that. This is what the falsification of business records were. And I said, what else are you going to call it?\"\n\nTrump said he would have testified during the trial and wanted to testify, but he said: \"The theory is you never testify because as soon as you testify ... they'll get you on something that you said slightly wrong, and then they sue you for perjury, but I didn't care about that. I wanted to.\"\n\nTrump continued: \"This is a scam. There's a rigged trial. It shouldn't have been in that venue. We shouldn't have had that judge.\"\n\n\"As far as the trial itself, it was very unfair. We weren't allowed to use our election expert under any circumstances,\" said Trump, who said that witnesses were \"crucified\" by Judge Merchan.\n\n\"You saw what happened to some of the witnesses that were on our side,\" he said. \"They were literally crucified by this man who looks like an angel but he’s really a devil. He looks so nice and soft. People always say he seems like such a nice man. No, unless you saw him in action. And you saw that with a certain witness that went through hell.\"\n\nSpeaker Johnson suggests justices 'deeply concerned' about Trump prosecution\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said today about Trump's conviction that he believes Supreme Court justices, some of whom he knows personally, are \"deeply concerned\" and he urged the court to step in when the case is appealed.\n\nIn an interview on \"Fox and Friends,\" Johnson, R-La., said the conviction was \"totally unprecedented\" and \"dangerous to our system\" because it diminishes people's faith in the criminal process and the courts.\n\n\"People have to believe that justice is fair, that there’s equal justice under law. They don’t see that right now,\" he said. \"And I think that the justices on the court, I know many of them personally, I think they’re deeply concerned about that, as we are. So I think they’ll set this straight but it’s going to take a while.\"\n\nIt is unclear if he was speaking generally about justices being concerned about the administration of justice or about Trump's case specifically, or whether he had spoken to any of them about it.\n\nTrump's initial appeal will be in the New York state court system. The U.S. Supreme Court takes up a tiny proportion of cases and will only intervene in state cases if there is a constitutional or federal law issue.\n\nTrump begins remarks saying 'these are bad people'\n\nTrump started his off-the-cuff remarks saying, \"These are bad people. These are in many cases, I believe, sick people.\"\n\nHe said \"millions of people are flowing in from all parts of the world, not just South America, from Africa, from Asia from the Middle East, and they're coming in from jails and prisons, and they are coming in from mental institutions and insane asylums. They're coming in from all over the world into our country.\"\n\n\"We have a president and a group of fascists that don't want to do anything about it because they could right now, today, he could stop it,\" he continued. \"But he's not. They're destroying our country. Our country is in very bad shape. And they're very much against me, saying these things.\"\n\nProtesters are outside Trump Tower\n\nProtesters are demonstrating outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan ahead of Trump's press conference there. They're holding signs that say, for example, \"lock him up\" and \"guilty\" in all caps.\n\nHow Trump and his allies are spinning his historic guilty verdict\n\nand\n\nTrump and his allies immediately tried to flip the script after a New York jury found him guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records yesterday.\n\nMost of their pushback on the airwaves and social media echoed the points they were making as the trial was ongoing: They felt that Judge Juan Merchan was conflicted, the jury was made up of liberals and the case amounted to election interference to boost Biden.\n\nAs the dust from the historic criminal verdict began to settle, Trump and his backers sought to flood the zone to insist that the system was rigged against him the whole time.\n\n“We didn’t do a thing wrong,” Trump said outside the courthouse yesterday after the unanimous guilty verdict. “I’m a very innocent man.”\n\nHere’s how Trump and his allies went on the offensive.\n\nCan Trump vote in November now that he’s been convicted of felony charges?\n\nTrump is joining the millions of Americans whose voting rights depend on their criminal records after a New York jury convicted him of felony charges in a hush money case.\n\nBut experts say Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is unlikely to be disenfranchised by the felony convictions in the New York case, noting that it would come down to whether he goes to prison as part of his sentence.\n\nForty-eight states prohibit some or all Americans with felony convictions on their records from voting, according to the Sentencing Project, and an estimated 4.4 million Americans — about 2% of the voting-age population — could not vote in the 2022 elections because of those laws. The group estimates that more than 1 million of them live in Florida, where Trump established his official residency in 2019.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nSenate, House Republican campaign committees say they each had their best fundraising day of the cycle\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee, the official campaign arms of Senate Republicans and House Republicans, respectively, said they each had their best fundraising day of the cycle yesterday.\n\nFollowing the verdict, Jason Thielman, the NRSC's executive director, said in a post on X, \"Outrage over the sham verdict against Trump has spurred average Americans into action! The NRSC just had its largest online daily fundraising haul of the cycle.\"\n\nAnd Jack Pandol, communications director for the NRCC, posted on X that his committee also \"shattered\" a previous record for the best fundraising day of the cycle. Punchbowl first reported the NRCC news.\n\nBiden campaign staff asked not to share personal opinions about Trump verdict on social media, sources say\n\nAn email went out to Biden campaign staff yesterday asking them not to post personal opinions or their own takes about the verdict on social media, instead suggesting they amplify the official campaign and White House statements, two sources familiar told NBC News.\n\nIn a statement yesterday after the verdict, Biden-Harris 2024 Communications Director Michael Tyler said: “In New York today, we saw that no one is above the law. Donald Trump has always mistakenly believed he would never face consequences for breaking the law for his own personal gain. But today’s verdict does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality. There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box.\"\n\nGroup identifies online threats against Trump jurors, judge\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nA group that monitors right-wing social media, Advance Democracy, says it has identified online calls to dox jurors, Judge Merchan and others.\n\nOn the far-right website 8kun, an anonymous user posted the purported personal contact information and addresses for journalists, the presiding judge and some purported jurors. Advance Democracy said it has not determined whether the posted information is accurate.\n\nAdvance Democracy said it also identified “a high volume of social media posts containing violent rhetoric targeting Justice Merchan and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. The group said it has not identified, however, any posts that could be perceived as concrete plans to engage in violence.\"\n\nThe group also said it detected general calls to organize in reaction to the verdict, but not specific details or plans for in-person activity. Some of the calls to organize include violent rhetoric (for example, calls “to go to Washington and hang everyone”).\n\nIn the lead-up to Trump's guilty verdict, false reports that spread on right-wing media about the jury instructions led to threats against Judge Merchan.\n\nGOP Senate candidate Kari Lake says husband was subpoenaed as verdict was handed down\n\nArizona GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake reacted to Trump’s conviction on Newsmax last night and announced that her husband was subpoenaed while the verdict was coming down.\n\n“As this was all coming down, a process server showed up at my door and served a subpoena on my husband. They’re, they’re lawfaring me to death,” she said.\n\nLake faces her own legal trouble after she was accused of defaming a Republican election official in Maricopa County, Stephen Richer, after her loss in the 2022 race for governor.\n\n“They’re going to have to kill me to stop me,” she said, painting herself as the victim of judicial warfare.\n\nLake said she wasn’t surprised by the verdict, using one of her favorite campaign lines: “We’re living on planet crazy right now.” She also urged Trump supporters to empty their pockets to help him win the November election.\n\nTrump downplays paper trail and reiterates NDAs are standard practice\n\nIn a lengthy post on Truth Social, Trump downplayed the evidence presented at the hush money trial, saying he was “not involved” in writing “legal expense” on the business records and expressing incredulity that such a thing would be considered a crime.\n\n“My bookkeeper called a “Legal Expense,” on the “tiny” description line of the Ledger, a “Legal Expense,” openly paid to my lawyer, at that time a fully accredited one. I was not involved in that designation, but what else would you have called it? It was, in fact, a LEGAL EXPENSE. That is the so-called “CRIME,” Trump wrote.\n\nReferring to Michael Cohen's efforts to secure the non-disclosure agreement with porn actor Stormy Daniels, Trump added, “My lawyer, at the time, did virtually everything on the NDA (NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT), and I assumed that what he did was correct.”\n\nTrump reiterated that he did “nothing wrong” and said NDAs are “standard, commonly used, and LEGAL.”\n\n“IF THIS CAN HAPPEN TO ME, IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE!” he wrote.\n\nTrump attorney Todd Blanche not surprised by verdict, vows to win on appeal\n\nTodd Blanche, Trump’s lead attorney in the hush money case, said this morning that he's not surprised about yesterday's historic verdict, but is confident the former president's conviction will be overturned on appeal.\n\nAppearing on NBC’s \"TODAY\" show, a little over 12 hours since his client was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records, Blanche said: \"This was a verdict we were expecting. We’re going to appeal and we’re going to win on appeal,\" he said.\n\nBlanche repeated the Trump team’s long-held belief that it was impossible to get a fair trial in Manhattan, where Trump has low approval ratings.\n\nAsked whether he was surprised that not one juror questioned the unanimous verdicts, Blanche complained that the outcome may have been different if the defense team was able to submit certain evidence, such as the tax records of witnesses.\n\nAs for whether Trump could face up to four years of jail time, one of the options available at his July 11 sentencing, Blanche said he hoped it wouldn’t come to that.\n\n\"Putting aside the fact he was president of the United States, he’s a grandfather, a husband, a father. He should not, he should not go to prison,\" he said.\n\n\"TODAY\" co-anchor Savannah Guthrie asked whether Blanche might intervene and ask his client to stop personally attacking Judge Merchan, who will decide his fate.\n\n\"It’s not just President Trump who has complained about the judge, so have I,\" he said, before adding \"it’s not my job to tell him how to communicate to the American people.\"\n\nBlanche said that in the aftermath of the verdicts, Trump remained calm and he was \"shocked at how he reacted in a very positive way.\"\n\nNBC News’ Shaq Brewster spoke with voters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, who explained why they would still vote for Trump despite the New York conviction.\n\nTrump campaign newsletter attacks trial's credibility\n\nA Trump campaign newsletter, the Palm Beach Playbook, urged supporters to get involved in the campaign after the verdict.\n\nThe campaign also reiterated criticisms of the trial, calling it a \"sham\" and arguing that the verdict \"is the result of the Left shredding the Constitution in their savage pursuit of raw political power.\"\n\nTrump lawyer says appeal is coming 'soon'\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche said in an interview on CNN last night that \"as soon as we can appeal, we will.\"\n\nBlanche said in multiple news interviews yesterday that he believed Trump did not get a fair trial, pointing to the trial's venue, timing and judge.\n\nTrump expected to hold news conference today\n\nTrump said yesterday that there would be a news conference at 11 a.m. today in the Trump Tower atrium.\n\nHe will deliver remarks, the campaign said.\n\nTrump spoke outside the courtroom following his guilty verdict, but he has yet to answer questions from reporters.\n\nHow Biden and his campaign use the verdict ahead of the election\n\nThe Biden campaign reacted to the verdict yesterday by saying Trump finally got his comeuppance.\n\nTrump \"has always mistakenly believed he would never face consequences for breaking the law for his own personal gain,\" campaign spokesman Michael Tyler said in a statement. \"But today’s verdict does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality. There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president.\"\n\nThe campaign also sent a fundraising text and email to supporters about the verdict.\n\nBiden hasn't spoken publicly about the verdict, though he solicited campaign donations after the trial on X, writing, \"There’s only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: At the ballot box.\"\n\nYesterday was the anniversary of his son Beau Biden's death, and he spent part of the day commemorating the somber moment by going to church and visiting the cemetery where his son is buried.\n\nIt's unclear to what extent both Biden and his campaign will highlight Trump’s conviction going forward."
