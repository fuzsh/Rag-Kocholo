        "text": "The Activity Coding List is used in the Harmonised European Time Use Surveys (HETUS) to quantify how much time people spend on various activities, including paid work, household chores and family care, personal care, voluntary work, social life, travel and leisure. It is based on international practices and previous classifications of daily activities used in Europe. The initial coding system and index were tested and revised on the basis of time use pilot surveys in 18 countries. The final system was completed in 2000 and revised in 2008 and in 2018. The European activity coding list allows several groupings of activities depending on the purpose of the analysis.\n\nEurostat website: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/time-use-surveys/overview\n\nAdministrative territorial unit (ATU) authority table is a controlled vocabulary that lists concepts associated with various administrative territorial units of current and past EU Member States.\n\nAn administrative territorial unit is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Due to the large volume of lowest level administrative units (local authority, municipality) in certain countries, these units have not yet been fully implemented. ATU is structured by countries and contains labels in the official language(s) of the concerned country and in English.\n\nThe classification of each territorial unit can be found in the related Administrative territorial unit type authority table.\n\nATU is updated based on the stakeholders' needs.\n\nContributions to it are accepted following a review made by EU Vocabularies team of the Publications Office of the EU.\n\nATU is maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union and disseminated on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nThe Administrative territorial unit type authority table (AT) is a controlled vocabulary which provides the various types of administrative territorial units within the Member States of the European Union. It is linked to the Administrative territorial unit table that provides the list of the subdivisions per country.\n\nThe categorization of these types is based on national official information and the Committee of the Regions of the European Union has provided the translations in all official languages of the European Union. The ISO 3166-2 standard has also been used. Where there are differences in the territorial unit types and the ISO code, the legal basis of the country concerned has taken precedence.\n\nAn administrative unit is defined for the purpose of administration with a certain degree of autonomy and is country-specific. The administrative unit refers to public administration for which the administrative law is applicable.\n\nThe administrative territorial unit types must not be confused with the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS). The NUTS is delineated according to the population living in the territorial unit and is used in an economical/statistical environment. The administrative territorial unit types must not be confused with the jurisdiction territories designed for the competence area of Courts. In certain countries, the subdivisions may be the same for the administrative, economical, statistical and jurisdiction units.\n\nThis AT is maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nIn the context of the Interinstitutional Metadata and Formats Committee (IMFC) the Institutions have decided to use XML as structured, machine-readable format for implementation and the Akoma Ntoso XML schema for the mark-up of the content of the legislative documents that are managed and exchanged by the Institutions in the scope of the legislative process.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis publication represents the current working version of the AKN4EU.\n\nIt is published for information purposes. It marks work in progress and has not been fully implemented yet.\n\nNeither the Publications Office nor any person acting on behalf of the Publications Office is responsible for the use that might be made of this publication.\n\nIf you have any comments, questions or further need for information, please contact: OP-CUSTOMER-SUPPORT@publications europa.eu.\n\nThe Publications Office has selected BITS (Book Interchange Tag Suite) as an XML mark-up model suitable for the production of general publications.\n\nBITS provides a common XML format in which publishers and archives can exchange book content, including book parts such as chapters. It provides a set of XML DTD and schema that define elements and attributes to describe textual and graphical contents.\n\nIn order to facilitate the reusability, BITS makes a tag set adequate for supporting interchange, archiving, format-conversion and publishing. More details can be found here\n\nThe Publications Office is preparing the use of the following version of BITS schema customised to meet the requirements of general publications.\n\nThe Case report authority table (AT) is a controlled vocabulary providing the different names of the case law reports of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Case report AT is used in an IMMC extension for which only one institution is the source (Court of Justice). It indicates the authority code and start-use date of each concept. The Case report AT is updated in coordination with the Court of Justice and maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nThe Case status authority table (AT) is a controlled vocabulary providing the different statuses used for a case at the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Case status AT is used in an IMMC extension for which only one institution is the source (Court of Justice). It gives the authority code and start-use date of each concept. Case status value indicates the status of the case i.e. case pending (including on-going cases, stayed cases and cases in the process of being discontinued or withdrawn); case closed.\n\nThe Case status AT is updated in coordination with the Court of Justice and maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nA statistical classification has a structure which is composed of one or several classification levels. A classification level is often characterised by a generic name for the classification items that it regroups. For instance, the NACE uses the terms \"sections\", \"divisions\", \"groups\" and \"classes\"; the Combined Nomenclature (CN) has sections, chapters, headings, HS subheadings and CN subheadings; the NUTS includes 4 levels: Level 0 (Country), level 1 (NUTS 1), level 2 (NUTS 2) and level 3 (NUTS 3). The bottom level is always the most detailed level i.e., has the most precise information (detailed values) for the variable classifying the statistical unit.\n\nClassification levels is maintained by Eurostat and published by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nThe Classification of Business Functions (CBF 1.0) is intended for use in the production of business statistics, building on experiences from several recent surveys in Europe, Canada, the United States, and India. The primary use of business function statistics is to examine the details of international sourcing. However, it could also be applied to domestic sourcing. The CBF is applicable for both developed and developing countries to measure the impact of both domestic and international sourcing in their national economies.\n\nCBF is created and maintained by Eurostat and published by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nThe Combined Nomenclature 2017 (CN 2017) is the goods classification used within the European Union for the purposes of foreign trade statistics. It is also used by Directorate General \"Taxation and Customs Union\" of the European Commission for customs duty purposes. The classification is based on the world standard Harmonized System (HS 2017) which it sub-divides where necessary for purposes of external trade, agricultural regulation and customs duties.\n\nLegal basis http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2017/1925/oj: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1925 of 12 October 2017 amending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff, OJ L 282, 31.10.2017, p. 1–958\n\nExplanatory notes https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.C_.2015.076.01.0001.01.ENG to the Combined Nomenclature of the European Union, OJ C 76, 4.3.2015, p. 1 -388\n\nEurostat website: International trade in goods methodology: classifications (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/international-trade-in-goods/methodology/classifications)\n\nThe Combined Nomenclature 2018 (CN 2018) is the goods classification used within the European Union for the purposes of foreign trade statistics.

Its documentation can be obtained by dereferencing the ontology URI http://publications.europa.eu/ontology/cdm.\n\nThis model is continually refined in collaboration with the business units to guarantee its quality with regards to the institutions’ needs for the structure of their metadata.\n\nThe Corporate body authority table is a controlled vocabulary which provides the varying names of EU corporate bodies for a given time span. Some other – international and national – corporate bodies are also included as far as they are used in the various systems in the Publications Office. The traceability of the chronological modifications is ensured when possible. Corporate body is under governance of the Interinstitutional Metadata and Formats Committee (IMFC). It is maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union and disseminated on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\n‘Countries and territories’ is a controlled vocabulary that lists concepts associated with names of countries and territories. It is a corporate reference data asset covered by the Corporate Reference Data Management policy of the European Commission.\n\nThe corporate list provides codes and names of geospatial and geopolitical entities in all official EU languages and is the result of a combination of multiple relevant standards, created to serve the requirements and use cases of the EU institutions services. Its main scope is to support documentary metadata activities.\n\nThe codes of the concepts included are correlated with the ISO 3166 international standard. The authority code relies where possible on the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code. Additional user-assigned alpha-3 codes have been used to cover entities that are not included in the ISO 3166-1 standard.\n\nThe corporate list contains mappings with the ISO 3166-1 two-letter codes, the Interinstitutional Style Guide codes and with other internal and external identifiers including ISO 3166-1 numeric, ISO 3166-3, UNSD M49, UNSD Geoscheme, IBAN, TIR, IANA domain.\n\nFor the names of countries and territories, the corporate list synchronises with the Interinstitutional Style Guide (ISG, Section 7.1 and Annexes A5 and A6) and with the IATE terminology database.\n\nMembership and classification properties provide possibilities to group concepts, e.g., UN, EU, EEA, EFTA, Schengen area, Euro area, NATO, OECD, UCPM, ENP-EAST, ENP-SOUTH, EU candidate countries and potential candidates.\n\nThe corporate list ‘Countries and territories’ is maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union and disseminated on the EU Vocabularies website. Regular updates are foreseen based on its stakeholders’ needs.\n\nDownloads in human-readable formats (.csv, .html) are also available.\n\nThe Currency authority table is a controlled vocabulary that lists concepts associated with currencies and currency subunits.\n\nThe concepts included are correlated with the ISO 4217 international standard.\n\nThe Currency authority table is updated based on the stakeholders’ needs.\n\nContributions to it are accepted following a review made by EU Vocabularies team of the Publications Office of the EU.\n\nThe Currency authority table is maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union and disseminated on the EU Vocabularies website.

The directory of EU legal acts is structured into 20 chapters with divisions into further sub-sections as necessary. The Directory of EU legal acts AT is part of the Core Metadata used in the exchange between the institutions involved in the legal decision making process and the Publications Office of the European Union. It indicates the authority code and start-use date of each concept and gives labels in all official EU languages. The Directory of EU legal acts AT is under governance of the Interinstitutional Metadata Maintenance Committee (IMMC) and maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nDirectory of legal acts is accessible at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/browse/directories/legislation.html\n\nThe Dissemination status authority table provides values for describing the status of dissemination for content, e.g. serials, monographic series, mobile applications, podcasts, datasets. It has been developed specifically for the Cataloguing Team which manages (metadata of the) general publications.\n\nThe Dissemination status authority table is updated based on the stakeholders' needs.\n\nContributions to it are accepted following a review made by the EU Vocabularies team of the Publications Office of the EU.\n\nThe Dissemination status authority table is maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union and disseminated on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nThe Distribution status authority table is a controlled vocabulary used to define the status of distributions of datasets described using the DCAT-AP data model. It has been developed to allow using the ADMS terms prescribed by DCAT-AP, as a controlled vocabulary.\n\nThis authority table is maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nThe Distribution status authority table is updated based on the stakeholders' needs.\n\nContributions to it are accepted following a review made by EU Vocabularies team of the Publications Office of the EU.\n\nThe Distribution status authority table is maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nThe Document identifier format authority file describes the standardised syntax of the identifiers of documents produced by the institutions of the European Union in particular. This authority file was created to be used by metadata in the AKN4EU mark-up language. It provides for each identifier marked a mapping with a standardised syntax with a decomposition into the subcomponents and for each subcomponent a meaning depending on the type of identifier. Each institution can have its own naming convention and is allowed to map it according to its own naming convention inside the text.\n\nThe Document identifier format authority file is maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union on EU Vocabularies website.\n\nDating from 1978 when catalogues of the Central Library of the Commission of the European Communities (now the European Union) were computerised, ECLAS is a thesaurus created by the Central Library of the Commission of the European Communities for indexing the publications and documents acquired by the Central Library of the Commission. ECLAS was based on the Macrothesaurus of OECD and complemented by the ILO thesaurus. After creation of EUROVOC in 1984, convergence started in order to bring ECLAS in line with EUROVOC, but it was never complete. ECLAS contains nineteen areas of interest in a hierarchical tree structure consisting of four levels. ECLAS is fully available in English and in French.\n\nThe OP COMM ECLAS is maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nERA vocabulary is an ontology defined by the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) to describe the concepts and relationships related to the European railway infrastructure and the vehicles authorized to operate over it. The infrastructure portion contains the Implementation layer that represents the railway network as a number of operational points (OPs) connected with sections of line (SoLs), describing the following structural subsystems of the Union rail system: the infrastructure subsystem, the energy subsystem, the trackside control-command and signalling subsystem. It also contains the Topological layer where the network topological concepts are defined. The Railway Vehicle types portion contains the route compatibility check-related technical characteristics of vehicle types.\n\nThe author of ERA vocabulary is ERA and it is published by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nThe EU programme authority table (AT) is a controlled vocabulary providing the list of programmes created and coordinated by the European Union and financially supported by the European Union or, in a few cases, by the contributions from the Member States. It has been developed specifically for the EU Budget as open linked data project. It indicates the authority code and start-use date of each concept and gives labels in all official EU languages. The EU programme AT is maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union and disseminated on the EU Vocabularies website. It is a corporate reference data asset covered by the Corporate Reference Data Management policy of the European Commission.\n\nEuropean business statistics (EBS) cover the structure, economic activities and performance of businesses, their research and development as well as innovation activities, their information and communication technologies (ICT) usage and e-commerce, and global value chains. They also comprise statistics on the production of manufactured goods and services and the international trade in goods and services as well as essential statistical infrastructure such as national statistical business registers and the EuroGroups register. EBS provide users and key policymakers with much needed information for decision-making or for analytical purposes. European business statistics (EBS) manuals seeks to serve statistical experts and users alike as a comprehensive reference to the world of EBS by providing an overview of business statistics while highlighting the features introduced by the new regulatory framework. Furthermore, the manual describes the various statistical tools and activities supporting EBS production such as statistical units and profiling, classifications, data processing or statistical disclosure control.\n\nECOICOP (European Classification of Individual Consumption according to Purpose) is based on COICOP (Classification of Individual Consumption according to Purpose), a reference classification published by the United Nations Statistics Division, which is used in National accounts, Household Budget surveys (HBS), Price Statistics (HICP) and Purchasing Power Parities (PPP). Parts of this classification are also used in Food safety statistics or environment statistics.\n\nECOICOP is consistent with the UN version at four digits, harmonized and developed by Eurostat at 5-digit levels. The objectives are to lay down a framework of homogeneous categories of goods and services, which are considered as a function or purpose of expenditure by households with the object of classifying transactions in relation to individual consumption, social transfers and households' real consumption.\n\nLegal basis: Regulation (EU) 2016/792 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on harmonised indices of consumer prices and the house price index, and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, OJ L 135, 24.5.2016, p. 11 -38.\n\nECOICOP is maintained by Eurostat and published by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nThe European List of Wastes (LoW) is the waste classification in the EU for administrative purposes, i.e. for permitting and supervision in the field of waste generation and management. The LoW defines 842 waste types which are structured into 20 chapters and 111 sub-chapters, mainly according to the source of the waste (i.e. the economic sector or process of origin).

From 2025 onwards, European statistics will start being produced based on NACE Rev. 2.1.\n\nLegal basis: Commision Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/137 of 10 December 2022 amending Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the statistical classification of economic activities NACE Revision 2, OJ L 19, 20.12.2023, p. 5 -42.\n\nNACE Rev. 2.1 is maintained by Eurostat and published by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nCPA 2.1 is the European version of the CPC 2.1 (Central Product Classifications of the United Nations) and with a structure based on NACE 2 according to the criterion of economic origin (and thus the definition of the economic activities).\n\nLegal basis: Commission Regulation (EU) No 1209/2014 of 29 October 2014 amending Regulation (EC) No 451/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a new statistical classification of products by activity (CPA) and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 3696/93 Text with EEA relevance, OJ L 336, 22.11.2014, p. 1 -149.\n\nCPA 2.1 is maintained by Eurostat and published by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nCPA is the European version of the CPC (Central Product Classifications of the United Nations) and with a structure based on NACE 2 according to the criterion of economic origin (and thus the definition of the economic activities).\n\nLegal basis: Regulation (EC) No 451/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 establishing a new statistical classification of products by activity (CPA) and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 3696/93 (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 145, 4.6.2008, p. 65 -226.\n\nCPA 2008 is maintained by Eurostat and published by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nThe Subdivision authority table is a controlled vocabulary providing the subdivisions of acts used for legal citations. It also lists the parts of the corrigenda. Subdivision is part of the Core Metadata used in the exchange between the institutions involved in the legal decision making process and the Publications Office of the European Union. It is used by Akoma Ntoso for EU, FORMEX, ELI and EUR-Lex for identifying divisions in a text. It provides an authority code and labels in all official EU languages. Subdivision is under governance of the Interinstitutional Metadata and Formats Committee (IMFC), maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union and disseminated on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nThe Subdivision content authority table (AT) is a controlled vocabulary listing concepts that indicate specific content of text divisions. It was created by the Publications Office (OP) for the development of AKN4EU specifications, which concern documents exchanged between the EU Institutions involved in the legal decision making process and sent to OP for publication.

It is under governance of the Interinstitutional Metadata and Formats Committee (IMFC), maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union and disseminated on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nThe subject matter classification exists in parallel with two other classifications: the Directory of European Union Legislation and EuroVoc. Differently from these, the subject matter classification is strictly aligned with the evolution of the European Union policies cited in the different treaties of the European Union that can be consulted at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/collection/eu-law/treaties.html?locale=en\n\nThe European Waste Classification is a mainly substance-oriented classification of waste for statistical purposes, which distinguishes hazardous and non-hazardous waste. It is aggregated into 51 mainly substance orientated waste categories that provides criteria for the assessment and classification of hazardous waste and defines different types of waste by a six-digit code for the waste and the respective two-digit and four-digit chapter headings. The two digit chapter headings are partly oriented towards the origin of the waste. The EWC stat is orientated purely to material disaggregation into parts of this material.\n\nLegal basis: Commission Regulation (EU) No 849/2010 of 27 September 2010 amending Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste statistics (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 253, 28.9.2010, p. 2 -41.\n\nEWC-Stat Rev. 4 is maintained by Eurostat and published by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nList of supplementary units (SU) or volume physical units is a code list used respectively in CN and PRODCOM List.\n\nFor certain goods, a supplementary quantity is provided in addition to the net mass. This quantity is expressed in a unit, which provides useful information. Supplementary units are units other than kilograms such as, for example, litres, numbers of pieces, carats, terajoules or square metres. Supplementary unit varies according to the goods.\n\nSupplementary units is maintained by Eurostat and published by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.\n\nThe 17 interlinked Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their related 169 targets, which are at the heart of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, provide a new policy framework worldwide towards ending all forms of poverty, fighting inequalities and tackling climate (https://sdgs.un.org/goals). The SDGs, set in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly and intended to be achieved by the year 2030, are part of a UN Resolution called the \"2030 Agenda\". The EU has committed to implement the Sustainable Development Goals both in its internal and external policies.\n\nThe UN developed a system of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) for Sustainable Development Goals, Targets, Indicators and related statistical series to support the development of a United Nations system-wide ecosystem of machine-readable data and documents based on Linked Open Data (LOD) principles. The taxonomy is available to IT developers and the public at large under http://metadata.un.org/sdg/?lang=en.\n\nThe Time-period authority table is a controlled vocabulary which lists the periods of time in the 24 official languages of the EU. It enumerates the names of the seasons, months, weekdays and the main units of time when the issues are published.
