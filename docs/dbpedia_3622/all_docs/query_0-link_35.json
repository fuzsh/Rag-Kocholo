        "text": "The automobile brand recently launched a month-long outdoor activity across rural areas in five states.\n\nAutomobile brand Mahindra recently conducted a 45-day outdoor activity across more than 80 towns in five states of the country. The campaign executed by Brandscope aimed to re-establish the presence of brand Bolero Pick Up Flat Bed using more than 180 touch points, which mostly included billboards. The total spends were Rs 70-75 lakh.\n\nThis was the first time that Mahindra Bolero Pick Up Flat Bed ventured into an OOH campaign.\n\nThe activation was carried out in MP, Maharashtra, Northeast India and Gujarat. Arterial roads, key junctions and large format billboards were chosen for the campaign.\n\nSpeaking about the idea behind the campaign, Fabian Cowan, vice-president, Brandscope, says, \"The objective was to take the message of arrival of new Pick Up in all key cities and rural pockets (with an adequate mix of cities and rural pockets). While the product was always available in the market the challenge was to re-establish the brand presence in these markets in an impactful manner.\"\n\nThe outdoor agency will soon start with the next phase of the campaign."
