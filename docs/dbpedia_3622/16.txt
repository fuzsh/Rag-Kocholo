Urban Rural V1 is a new dwelling typology with a sustainable transformation strategy that will become a model for Istanbulâs urban landscape. It proposes a hybrid life-style where one can be within a city yet still enjoy elements of rural life. The design reinforces community cultivation through robust interaction points for diverse use.

Urban Rural aims to reduce a building's waste footprint and aims to increase vegetation that is diminishing in dense cities like Istanbul. It is a modular design with mechanical components that collapse for ease and efficiency in transportation, reducing the carbon footprint of sourcing for construction.
