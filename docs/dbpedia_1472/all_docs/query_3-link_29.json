        "text": "The upcoming Mortal Kombat film has cast its Sonya Blade and Kano as Jessica McNamee (The Meg) and Josh Lawson (House of Lies) are set on the take the roles respectively.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, McNamee is in final negotiations to play Sonya Blade, while Lawson’s deal is done to play Kano. Additionally, Lewis Tan (Wu Assassins, Deadpool 2) is also currently in final discussions to play an undisclosed lead character in the upcoming reboot.\n\nMcNamee, Lawson, and Tan are adding to an already established cast which includes Ludi Lin as Liu Kang (Power Rangers), Joe Taslim as Sub Zero (The Raid), Mehcad Brooks as Jax (Supergirl), Tadanobu Asano as Raiden (Thor: Ragnarok), and Sisi Stringer as Mileena. However, there is currently no plot details regarding this upcoming Mortal Kombat reboot.\n\nFor anyone is unaware or haven’t played the video games, the plot centres around a roster of fighters from a variety of realms who are battling for supremacy. In the world of Mortal Kombat, Sonya is a general of Earthrealm Special Forces, while Kano, a member of the Black Dragon clan, has a long-lasting feud with Sonya.\n\nWhat do you think to these castings? Are you glad Sonya Blade and Kano will be included in the upcoming Mortal Kombat film? Let us know in the comments below or tweet us @flickeringmyth…\n\nMortal Kombat is slated to arrive in theatres on 5th March 2021."
