        "text": "As Long as Kano Blows a Kiss in This One…\n\nIt seems like 2021’s Mortal Kombat is really picking up steam. Every couple of weeks, more news comes out to please fans of the series. After the casting of Sub-Zero came announcements that Mileena, Jax, Raiden, and Liu Kang had also been cast. Now it appears that the upcoming Mortal Kombat movie has found its Sonya Blade, Kano, Shang Tsung, and Scorpion. All of these characters were announced on August 27th. Maybe two weeks from now we will see more news to continue the trend.\n\nSonya Blade will be played by Australian actress Jessica McNamee. McNamee starred in 2018s The Meg. Josh Lawson will be playing Kano. Lawson had a role in Anchorman 2 as well as the TV series Superstore from 2015-2018. Shang Tsung will be played by Chin Han who starred in The Dark Knight, Ghost in the Shell, Skyscraper, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Scorpion will be played by Hiroyuki Sanada. Hiroyuki Sanada was killed by Hawkeye in Avengers: Endgame and killed by Wolverine in The Wolverine. He also starred alongside Keanu Reeves in 47 Ronin.\n\nWith the exception of Scorpion, all the characters that have been cast were already rumored to be in the movie from a leak. Though he was not mentioned, fans have been hoping for Scorpion to join the roster, as well as Johnny Cage, who has not been confirmed or cast. The first Mortal Kombat movie in 1995 also included all of the characters confirmed for this movie except Mileena. Mortal Kombat is expected to hit theaters on March 5th, 2021.\n\nWho has been your favourite casting choice so far? Let us know in the comments below."
