        "text": "It's good that the Twins have a deep farm system, because they are graduating top prospects at an unsustainable rate. Due to injuries and ineffectiveness, the Twins have needed to call up multiple players on an earlier timeline than desired. Who's left to rely upon, should the injury bug bite again?\n\nImage courtesy of © Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe 2024 season has not played out as expected. Headed into the season, players like Edouard Julien, Alex Kirilloff, and Kyle Farmer were all expected to play key roles, but all three have been injured, ineffective, or both. This has led to the team's first layer of depth being called up to the big-league club, and José Miranda, Trevor Larnach, Brooks Lee, and Austin Martin have all been key components to the Twins’ success. Let’s take a position-by-position at the remaining depth options.\n\nAs the Twins have a bit of a 40-man crunch, let’s start with the players who are currently not on the active roster, or on the IL.\n\nCatchers\n\nJair Camargo\n\nInfielders\n\nEdouard Julien\n\nYunior Severino\n\nOutfielders\n\nEmmanuel Rodríguez (on the minor-league IL, with no ETA on a return)\n\nThis group is going to be the majority of the injury-replacement talent pool this season. The Twins are famous for not wanting to lose assets unnecessarily, so if they don’t have to make 40-man moves, they likely won’t.\n\nThere are also several players currently on the injured list who could return at some point this season. These guys could also be the next man up in some cases.\n\nOn the MLB Injured List\n\nKyle Farmer - 10-day IL\n\nCarlos Correa - 10-day IL\n\nAlex Kirilloff - 60-day IL\n\nThis list is a mixed bag. Carlos Correa is likely not more than a couple of weeks from returning, assuming he doesn’t experience a setback as he attempts to rehab from plantar fasciitis. Kyle Farmer could return when there’s a need, although there hasn’t been a status update since Jul. 12. Alex Kirilloff has no ETA.\n\nWith all that in mind, for the purposes of this activity, I will assume that Correa and Farmer will return in August, and Kirilloff will not.\n\nNow that we have established the 40-man and injured list options for activation, let’s look at the current depth chart at the major-league level, and weigh the possibilities for next man up at each position.\n\nCatcher\n\nCurrent: Christian Vázquez, Ryan Jeffers\n\nNext up: Jair Camargo\n\nCamargo is likely to hit like Vázquez, with the defense of Jeffers. His scouting report suggests career backup as his realistic upside. Ricardo Olivar and Alex Isola both have more potential, but are not on the 40-man and are also in the lower minors. With that in mind, Camargo is likely the backup we would see this season, should one of the starting tandem be injured. The team has to hope their extremely equitable timeshare continues to keep both backstops healthier than most catchers.\n\nFirst Base\n\nCurrent: Carlos Santana, José Miranda\n\nNext up: Yunior Severino, Edouard Julien\n\nJulien has looked overmatched with the Twins this season, and to a lesser extent, even with the Saints. Because of this, the Twins might be inclined to give Severino a cup of coffee. He's had an interesting journey to the big leagues. Originally signed by the Braves in the 2016-2017 international signing period, that team then lost him as a penalty for skirting international signing bonus rules. The Twins signed him, and he has slowly worked his way up.\n\nOnce upon a time, he was a speedy shortstop, but he's now a slugging, defensively-limited infielder. He strikes out a ton, but he would likely hold down first base as a slightly above-replacement player.\n\nSecond Base\n\nCurrent: Willi Castro\n\nNext up: Brooks Lee, Edouard Julien, Kylw Farmer\n\nOnce Correa is ready to return, Castro will be able to return to his super-utility status. Lee would be the natural backup, with Julien set to return if needed. This is an easy position to cover with the Twins' depth and positional flexibility.\n\nShortstop\n\nCurrent: Brooks Lee\n\nNext up: Carlos Correa when ready to return, then Diego A. Castillo\n\nThis one is cheating a little bit. With Correa progressing to sprints and (hopefully) ready to return by mid-month, we’ll say he’s the backup at shortstop. That will likely push Lee back to the Saints until he’s needed again, and can receive everyday playing time. For additional middle infield depth, the Twins would likely look back to Diego A Castillo due to recent familiarity. The Twins traded for Castillo from the Orioles in April, and he has spent the majority of the season with the Saints. Castillo was fine in limited action with the Twins earlier this season, hitting to a 183 OPS+ (in six at-bats). Overall, the journeyman has played in just over a half-season collectively with the Pirates, Diamondbacks, and Twins and has been worth -0.5 fWAR across his big league career. He’s been better in the minors, but would likely be another replacement-level player for the Twins.\n\nThird Base\n\nCurrent: Royce Lewis, José Miranda\n\nNext up: Brooks Lee, then maybe Diego A. Castillo?\n\nGiven Lewis’s lengthy injury history and impact when healthy, the Twins’ third base depth is of particular importance. Lee has the defensive profile to be well above average at the hot corner, but he does not bring the same hitting prowess as Lewis. Miranda can play some third, albeit not well. Castro can play there in a pinch, assuming he isn’t needed elsewhere. If the Twins have to tap into depth, the likely candidate would be Castillo.\n\nOutfield\n\nWere the Twins to need an additional outfielder (beyond those who can play in the grass as a secondary position), they would likely need to remove one of Brent Headrick, Ronny Henriquez, or Josh Winder from the 40-man roster. In that event, the move could be to call up DaShawn Keirsey, Jr. The Twins' 4th-round pick in 2018, Keirsey is a fourth outfielder type. As a 27-year-old at St Paul, he’s hit to the tune of an .816 OPS with a bit of pop. Speed is part of his game, as he’s stolen 24 bags in 31 tries. He strikes out more than 25% of the time at Triple-A, though, and his big-league numbers would likely look similar to Austin Martin with a little more power. The Twins would probably like to avoid adding Keirsey to the 40-man, as it would cost them two players - whoever they had to DFA in favor of Keirsey, and then Keirsey himself in the offseason, at the latest.\n\nLeft Field\n\nCurrent: Matt Wallner, Trevor Larnach, Austin Martin, Willi Castro\n\nNext up: Trevor Larnach, then DaShawn Kiersey\n\nCenter Field\n\nCurrent: Byron Buxton, Austin Martin, Willi Castro\n\nNext up: Willi Castro, Austin Martin, then DaShawn Kiersey\n\nRight Field\n\nCurrent: Max Kepler, Austin Martin, Willi Castro\n\nNext up: Matt Wallner, then DaShawn Kiersey\n\nDH\n\nCurrent: José Miranda, and anyone with a platoon advantage that benefits from a partial day off from fielding\n\nNext up: The Twins would likely continue to mix and match and not promote a player to DH, unless Severino went on a tear of epic proportions.\n\nUtility infielder\n\nCurrent: Willi Castro\n\nNext up: Kyle Farmer when he's ready to return, then Luke Keaschall\n\nFarmer is fine as a righty in the lineup situationally. He’s a clubhouse leader, progenitor of the home run sausage, and a thoroughly mediocre hitter and fielder. The Twins will play him as they pay him, unless the situation becomes truly dire. In that case, they could look at Luke Keaschall, another prospect with some serious helium. Keaschall is a consensus top-100 prospect, able to play multiple infield positions, and he’s more than holding his own at Wichita, posting an OPS greater than .800 as a middle infielder. It appears his future is bright, and if his clock starts sooner than expected, it may work out. But, the preference would be to discuss a callup a year from now if things break right for the team.\n\nUtility Outfielder\n\nCurrent: Manuel Margot, Austin Martin\n\nNext up: DaShawn Keirsey, Jr.\n\nOverall, the Twins have graduated several top prospects this season. That has impacted the number of good hitters in the upper minors upon whom to call as injury replacements. Because of this, it's more important than ever that they stay healthy down the stretch, as there just aren't guys beating down the door to the majors. Luckily, the value they place on roster flexibility ensures that it's relatively unlikely the team should need additional call-ups among hitters this season.\n\nWhat do you think? Would these be the next guys up in the event of more injuries? How would you feel about these options, should the unforeseen occur? Are there other minor-league options you would feel better about?
