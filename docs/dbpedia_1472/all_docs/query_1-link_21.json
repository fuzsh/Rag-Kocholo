I was sad to learn that Trevor Goddard, who held a recurring role as Mic Brumby for several years, was found dead today in his apartment. A drug overdose seems to be the cause, althought there is some suspicion of suicide. I'll post more when the info becomes available.\n\nCJ~\n\nPosting Freak\n\nPosts: 1,849\n\nThreads: 79\n\nJoined: Feb 2003\n\nThis is so sad. I really enjoyed his character\n\nHere is what is on Yahoo news, it's not much info yet:\n\nGoddard's girlfriend discovered his body lying on a bed at about noon on Sunday, Los Angeles County coroner's office spokesman Craig Harvey said.\n\nA preliminary investigation indicated his death was a possible suicide by an overdose of as-yet unknown \"illicit, illegal\" drugs, Harvey said.\n\nNotes were discovered at Goddard's home, but investigators did not characterize them as suicide notes, he said. \"There was nothing in the notes indicating that he meant to take his life,\" Harvey said. The notes were addressed to a friend.\n\nInvestigators think Goddard died sometime after 9 p.m. on Saturday after having a telephone conversation with a friend from his home, Harvey said. An autopsy is set for Tuesday.\n\nA former professional boxer, Goddard was \"discovered\" while competing at a light-heavyweight bout and asked to appear in a series of beer commercials, according to his Web site.\n\nHe built a career on portraying villains in many of Hollywood's top action movies, including tough-guy Kano in New Line Cinema's \"Mortal Kombat.\"\n\nHe was best known to U.S. audiences from his recurring small screen role as Mic Brumby on the military drama \"Jag\" from 1998 to 2001. Goddard had just completed work on \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl\" with Johnny Depp (news) and Orlando Bloom (news).\n\nI wonder if other dogs think poodles are members of a weird religious cult. -Rita Rudner"
