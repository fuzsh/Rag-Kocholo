        "text": "Adaptations of video games into other media are stigmatized a lot (primarily because of bad live action movie adaptations), but quite a few times games have borrowed or taken inspiration from them. Feel free to share any others that you know of.\n\nIn the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time manga by Akira Himekawa, one of the chapters was a bonus story not based on anything from the game where Link encounters a race of bird people, the Watarara, and helps their lost prince, Rouru.\n\nThe Watarara from this manga would go on to directly inspire the Rito during The Wind Waker's development. The story about them in the manga even involved them gaining their wings at their coming of age ceremony.\n\nEiji Aonuma said:\n\n\"For the episode \"The Wind Waker\", when we chose to situate the action in the middle of the ocean, we immediately felt the need to create a race that can move through the air. During long trips offshore, we needed faster characters capable of transmitting information to Link. It was at that moment that I remembered Watatara clan, you had invented for the adaptation of \"Ocarina of Time.\" In short, I digress a bit about the initials but we are inspired by your work to give birth to Rito Race, creatures that are half-man half-bird that can move very quickly with their wings.\"\n\nThat wasn't even the first time a bird person was in a Zelda comic\n\nOf course, that same comic also gave us a glimpse at two other future Zeldas\n\nNintendo Power's Super Mario Adventures comic is also where the idea that Bowser was in love with Peach came from, which bled into Paper Mario and Super Mario Odyssey.\n\nHoly shit, what? That is amazing!\n\nIt's the Nintendo Power comic adaptation of Link to the Past by Shotaro Ishinomori (guy who created Super Sentai and Kamen Rider). It's actually quite good.\n\nAdaptations of video games into other media are stigmatized a lot (primarily because of bad live action movie adaptations), but quite a few times games have borrowed or taken inspiration from them.

The story about them in the manga even involved them gaining their wings at their coming of age ceremony.\n\nI love this topic and I had no clue about the specific example in the OP, so double thanks for sharing. :)\n\nThere's a TVTropes page dedicated to examples of this:\n\nVideo Games / Canon Immigrant - TV Tropes\n\nThe new mini-game added in Fairune Collection, Fairune Blast, brings in two main characters and some bosses from Kamiko, as well as recasting the game's main character Hope Girl as the missing third protagonist of Kamiko. Street Fighter: Karin …\n\nEveryone feel free to post the most interesting ones in this thread. :)\n\nNintendo Power's Super Mario Adventures comic is also where the idea that Bowser was in love with Peach came from, which bled into Paper Mario and Super Mario Odyssey.\n\nActually that was way back in the anime movie from 1986, which is also the first thing that had Bowser's modern appearance.\n\nSuper Mario Bros.: Peach-hime Kyūshutsu Dai Sakusen!\n\nSuper Mario Bros.: Peach-hime Kyūshutsu Dai Sakusen! is an animated Super Mario film that was only released in Japan. It is a rough interpretation of the events of the original Super Mario Bros. with several alterations. Directed by Masami Hata,...\n\nThat wasn't even the first time a bird person was in a Zelda comic\n\nOf course, that same comic also gave us a glimpse at two other future Zeldas\n\nHe's Cyborg 002, so I think the bird thing was just the logical way his flight powers/nose might manifest in the dark world setting.\n\nAnyway, there was a lot of Pac-Man stuff (like Pac-Land and Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures) that took cues from the Hannah-Barera cartoon.\n\nHere's a weird example: the Checker Knights course from Kirby Air Ride reuses a song originally from the Kirby anime. Most if not all of the music was replaced in the English dub, as was common with adaptations from 4kids, so it's something most of us wouldn't have realized at the time. The song reappeared in Super Smash Bros. Brawl but was dropped afterwards, perhaps some kind of weird licensing issue?\n\nHere's a weird example: the Checker Knights course from Kirby Air Ride reuses a song originally from the Kirby anime.

The song reappeared in Super Smash Bros. Brawl but was dropped afterwards, perhaps some kind of weird licensing issue?\n\nIn a related note, I find it weird that the show was the first thing to use the modern western-release Kirby logo/font (preceding Nightmare In Dreamland by two months) and they still use it to this day, though the show has been left as a historical curiosity.\n\nI wonder if Nintendo/Hal planned out some simultaneous cross-media logo, or if a 4Kids-designed logo somehow lucked itself into being the main series one.\n\nAnyway, Escargoon also appears in Mass Attack, as well as some Hal anniversary illustrations, so who knows, he could theoretically make another appearance.\n\nSilent Hill: Homecoming was borderline Silent Hill: The Movie: The Game\n\nDevil May Cry 5 took a bunch from some of its adaptions:\n\n- Patty, Morrison and Dante's love for strawberry sundae originated in the anime.\n\n- Machiavelli, the demon gunsmith who created the Artemis and Pandora Devil Arms, was first mentioned in the audio dramas.\n\n- The Devil May Cry sign on Nero's van is something Dante gave Nero in DMC4's novelization.\n\n- Nell Goldstein, Nico's grandmother and the gunsmith that created Ebony & Ivory, appears in the DMC1 prequel novel. The idea that Dante used Tony Redgrave as an alias earlier in his career, is also from here.\n\n- Dynamic combat tracks, a training mode, enemy introduction name legends, a stylized style meter with the style meter being visualized as the combat style rank letter itself filling up, V's Devil Trigger turning his black hair whie, and characters swearing (yes, really) were all references to or features introduced in DmC. Also two enemies in DMC5, Baphomet and Fury, are very similar in game design to two enemy types from DmC, the Witch and the Dreamrunners/Drekavac. This is more direct, since DmC was a reboot and not an adaption in a different medium. But since it was made by a different developer and took place in a separate continuity, I decided bring it up.\n\nFurthermore, the anime, novels, manga and audio drama, with the exception of the second novel, are canon according to Itsuno and Matt Walker. Even despite the fact that the first novel contradicts events in both DMC1 and 3.\n\nIn the original Tomb Raider timeline, Lara Croft was virtually disowned by her parents as she sought to be a mercenary/adventure archaeologist. Her backstory was she was trapped in a survival situation, which left her an adrenaline junkie obsessed with the past. At least her mother lived on to the time Tomb Raider: Chronicles came out, as she has a cameo leaving her daughter's funeral, while a group of people Lara actually had rapport with come together to tell tales of her adventures.\n\nThe Angelina Jolene movies change this, with her following in the footsteps of her mighty father, who had been killed by the illuminati. When the Legend reboot hit, they adapted this backstory to a degree--Lara's father was an adventure archaeologist, her mother disappeared in front of Lara's eyes due to magic shenanigans, Lord Croft ruined his reputation seeking mysticism and died under mysterious circumstances, and... he was entirely right. The backstory to the Survivor timeline's even a little closer to the movies, with him being offed by the Illuminati-esque Trinity (rather than burning to death via Atlantean demon goddess).\n\nIn the original Tomb Raider timeline, Lara Croft was virtually disowned by her parents as she sought to be a mercenary/adventure archaeologist.

When the Legend reboot hit, they adapted this backstory to a degree--Lara's father was an adventure archaeologist, her mother disappeared in front of Lara's eyes due to magic shenanigans, Lord Croft ruined his reputation seeking mysticism and died under mysterious circumstances, and... he was entirely right. The backstory to the Survivor timeline's even a little closer to the movies, with him being offed by the Illuminati-esque Trinity (rather than burning to death via Atlantean demon goddess).\n\nYeah, sadly this. Even the Top Cow comics had her being a loner.\n\nCrystal Dynamics took the wrong lessons from the movies, where she moves past an insane obsession, and turned the Croft line into a pivotal plot point in every game.\n\nCore Design retconning a mentor, Von Croy, into Lara's backstory was already too shabby."
