        "text": "“\n\nOne thing we Black Dragon know, there's no fun in a fair fight.\n\n„\n\n—Kano to past Sonya in Mortal Kombat 11\n\nKano (Japanese: 加納)[2] is a character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. The leader of the Black Dragon clan, he is a ruthless scoundrel and archnemesis to Sonya Blade and the Special Forces.\n\nKano made his debut as one of the few original characters in the first Mortal Kombat arcade game. He is the first Black Dragon clan member featured in the series and has been a recurring antagonist to the franchise since his debut. He serves as a major antagonist towards Sonya Blade and her family.\n\nAbout Kano\n\nAs a mercenary and leader of the international crime cartel known as the Black Dragon, Kano rises beyond mere brutality and aggression by also being sly and cunning. Originally from Australia, Kano is highly opportunistic and incredibly selfish, willing to betray his own realm and even his own allies for money or personal gain. As a result, he quickly became part of Shao Kahn's inner circle, and eventually the general of Outworld's armies (in the original timeline). One of his more notable features is his facetious and twisted sense of humor, almost always making light of dire circumstances. His vulgarity is an additional outlier among other characters, most evident by his penchant for callously spitting, drinking and urinating wherever he pleases. His assortment of dirty fighting tactics also compliments his unpleasant personality. He combines features of a cowardly minion, a lone survivor, a crazed madman, and a ruthless commander. He is despised by the majority of other characters in the series for his selfish, untrustworthy nature, complete lack of morals, and overall crudeness. However, he seems to enjoy the fact that he is hated, even viewing it as a source of pride. He is the archenemy of Sonya Blade, who is obsessed with finding and bringing Kano to justice.\n\nA portion of Kano's face is covered with a metal plate, the result of a disfiguring injury he sustained at the hands of Jax prior to the events of the series, with the plated eye being a glowing red orb capable of emitting laser beams.\n\nSince Deadly Alliance, he speaks with an Australian accent and makes regular use of Aussie idioms and slang.\n\nAppearance\n\nIn his debut, Kano is depicted as a white male with a black buzzcut, sporting a white Gi accessorized with a brown bandolier strapped around his chest & shoulders and knives holstered on his ankles. He also has a cybernetic Eye Shield prosthetic over his right eye, which has become part of his signature look.\n\nAs with most returning characters in MK3, Kano's look underwent a dramatic overhaul. Instead of a white karate Gi, Kano now wears a sleeveless red and black tunic, a pair of shiny black tights with red seams, and black sneakers. He is also completely bald in this appearance. However, a bandolier is still strapped around his body, and he continues to wear an eye shield over his right eye. His knives, strapped to his shins, are now laser-edged.\n\nAcross Deadly Alliance, Deception, and Armageddon, his primary look once again underwent a dramatic change. He now sported slicked back hair and has a new variation of his Eye Shield, covering slightly more of the right side of his face. He wears a black vest, arm bands, gloves and a necklace made up of a lock of Sonya Blade's hair that he ripped off of her. He wears khaki colored pants with knee pads and knives holster to his boot.\n\nIn the reboot, Kano once again sports his MK3 attire, albeit more loose-fitting. It also comes with slightly more advanced cybernetics. He sports a head full of hair and a full beard. Having tattoos of Dragons on both arms and chest. His Eye Shield and Cybernetic Heart are once again updated and his gauntlets seem to have some sort of enhancements as well.\n\nHis alternate outfit has another variation of his Eye Shield & Cybernetic Heart. He wears an open tan vest, black leather gloves and gray pants with leg guards and knives strapped to his shins, as well as a tooth necklace around his neck.\n\nIn Mortal Kombat X, Kano's overall appearance changes. Looking older, with a low messy haircut, a scruffy beard. His Eye Shield is upgraded and take up a huge portion of the right side of his face and is connected to wire which appear to enter into his body from the back. He is shirtless, sporting a muscular but not as toned of a body and can see multiple scars across his body. He has two dragon tattoos that are on both arms and chest. His bandolier is slightly different, it straps around both shoulders and across his stomach. They all connect to his Cybernetic Heart which serves as a power supply for his Cybernetics and can power up his moves. He wears camouflaged cargo pants with combat boots. Depending on the variation chosen, his knives are either placed on his back or at his hips. Gauntlets on both forearms as well as armbands. Kano also has a couple of grenades or some type of explosive charges connected to his belt. Two versions of Kano appear in Mortal Kombat 11, being his present and past self, both sporting different attires and overall appearances.\n\nPresent Day Kano: He sports a little more hair on his head with the right side shaved to accommodate for his Eye Shields. His facial hair consists of a chevron mustache with long sideburns that do not connect with the mustache, he also has some scruff on his lower lip that resembles a soul patch. The bionic eye is much sleeker now, with an angular design and no external attachments. His bandolier holds his Cybernetic Heart with 3 straps around his chest. His body is muscular and lean, slightly scarred with bushy chest hair and has a single dragon tattoo on his left arm and another dragon on his right forearm. He has fingerless gloves on both hands and a grey bracer on his left forearm. He is sporting olive green cargo pants with leg guards and his signature knives strapped to his shins and leather boots with blades hidden in them.\n\nPast Kano: He is bald and has no facial hair and wears a new version of his MK3 attire, consisting of a red and black gi with a black undershirt, a smaller eye shield that only covers an area around the eye socket and a bandolier holding his cybernetic heart going around his torso, metal bracers on his forearms, a large utility belt with several pouches, black leather pants with leg guards and knives strapped to his shins and leather boots with blades hidden in them.\n\nCharacter Development\n\nIn an early sketch of Kano by John Tobias, he had an eye patch instead of a metal face plate with a bionic eye, and 2 katanas. Another design of Kano had a large helmet with two red eyes. This concept was also dropped later on to be replaced by a metal plate over his right eye. In Kano's Deception Bio Card, Ed Boon mentions how Kano's bionic eye in the first MK (involving digitized actors) was created by cutting out a piece of a plastic mask and painting it a silver color, then gluing it to Richard Divizio's head.\n\nIn an episode of Icons/Gamemakers, hosted by G4, Ed Boon stated that the eye implant was directly based on ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' in which the T-800's right side of his face begins to peel off from damage, revealing his mechanical visage.[3]\n\nIn an interview with Ed Boon, he states that Kano's cybernetic heart is based on Marvel's Iron Man's arc reactor.\n\nKano was initially written as being born in Japan and adopted by an American.[4][5] Later, his nationality was retconned to Australian after Trevor Goddard's film performance was positively received.\n\nGame Information\n\nKano was left out of the Sega Game Gear and Sega Master System version of MK due to memory constraints.\n\nIn Deadly Alliance, Kano had a move with his Butterfly Knives called \"ear to ear\". This was based on a line in the first Mortal Kombat movie, where Kano mockingly claimed that he used his knife to slit the throat of Sonya's partner, from \"ear to ear\". He also had a fast tag combo in MK 2011 as well as a combo in MKX that share the same name.\n\nCombat Characteristics\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nKano isn't the most disciplined fighter but has proven himself to be a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, having received extensive training in Street Fighting, Military Combat and has trained under the Martial Arts of Xing Yi, Aikido, but tends to resort to more of a Street Brawler style of fighting. He is not above utilizing underhanded tactics to get the upper hand in a fight. Kano is an opportunistic fighter and tends to engage in fights when it best suits him, but if challenged directly he will not shy away from the challenge. What he lacks in discipline (finesse & footwork), he makes up for it by being extremely adept in combat and has proven to be a challenge for even the more skilled fighters. What differentiates Kano from his opponents, however, is his dependence on Weapons/Technology rather than Special Powers. He is highly proficient at using knives in combat and often carries multiple bladed weapons on him at once. He has a signature pair of knives he uses in combat, whether they are thrown at the opponent or uses them in hand-to-hand combat. In addition to his fighting skills, Kano has been outfitted with cybernetic enhancements throughout his body, most notably his Cybernetic Eye which can emit a laser beam. His other enhancements help boost his power in combat.\n\nAlthough Kano depends mostly on Weapons/Technology rather than special moves, he does have a Special Ability to tuck himself into a \"Cannonball\" and propel himself toward his opponents knocking them down. This has been a signature move of his since the first game. Also, several of his finishers involve him ripping vital organs (or sometimes entire skeletons) out of the opponent's body. Along with the elder Sub-Zero's Spine Rip Fatality, Kano's Heart Rip helped Mortal Kombat garner significant controversy over its violence factor.\n\nAs of Mortal Kombat X, Kano's cybernetics have been upgraded and extended through his entire body. This includes a cybernetic \"heart\" similar to Hsu Hao, which serves as a booster to his cybernetic enhancements. He now uses thermal grenades as part of his already deadly arsenal.\n\nSignature Moves\n\nCannon Ball: Kano curls into a ball and flies at his opponent. In MK 2011 and MK1, this is known simply as Ball. In MKX, this is known as Kano Ball and also hits the opponent twice if they're too close. In MK11, this is called Black Dragon Ball. (MK, MK3, UMK3, MKT, MK:DA, MK:SM, MK:A, MKvsDCU, MK 2011, MKX, MK11, MK1)\n\nIn MK 2011, the enhanced version is called Kano Ball. Kano will spin in the air momentarily before launching at the opponent, hitting them several times. This can be charged (delayed) and is unblockable if held for the full charge.\n\nIn MKX, the enhanced version is called Black Dragon Ball and, like the MK 2011 version, can be delayed, but unlike the MK 2011 version, it can be blocked. The enhanced version also deals increased damage. This attack can also be canceled before it knocks the opponent down, briefly stunning them and allowing for combo extensions.\n\nIn MK11, amplifying the attack has Kano slash the opponent with his knives after striking the opponent, knocking them down and dealing increased damage. Kano can amplify the attack regardless if the opponent blocked the initial hit.\n\nDown Ball: Kano performs a Ball from the air to the ground, hitting the opponent if in his way. In MKX, this is known as Air Ball and will also make Kano connect with a low kick as soon as he lands, tripping his opponent. If Kano does not make contact with his opponent, he will only trip his opponent once he lands. In MK11, this is called (Air) Black Dragon Ball and after Kano strikes the opponent, he crouches in a position ready to attack. (MK 2011, MKX, MK11)\n\nIn MK 2011, the enhanced version is Downward Ball and allows Kano to do his Air Throw before the opponent hits the ground.\n\nIn MKX, this move can be enhanced as soon as Kano lands, which will make him pounce at the opponent's torso to force them against the ground instead of the low kick. If Kano does not make contact with the opponent, he will just pounce the opponent. Enhancing the attack makes it unblockable. Kano can not enhance the attack if the initial hit is blocked.\n\nIn MK11, amplifying the attack has Kano perform a front flip, kicking and slashing his opponent with his retractable boot blades, knocking them down and dealing increased damage. Kano can amplify the attack regardless if the opponent blocked the initial hit. Additionally, Kano can amplify the attack if the initial hit misses and delay the moment of amplifying it.\n\nUpwards Cannon Ball: Kano aims his Cannon Ball upwards to an aerial opponent. This moves is known simply as Up Ball in MK 2011 and MKX, and in MKX it hits twice if the opponent close to Kano. In MK11, this is called Up Black Dragon Ball and can only be used if the Equip Ability Vege-Mighty is active (See Below). Additionally, in MK11, instead of immediately flying upward, Kano will initially fly forward before moving upwards in a diagonal direction. (UMK3, MKT, MKvsDCU, MK 2011, MKX, MK11)\n\nBoth in MK 2011 and MKX, the enhanced version is called Uprise Ball. In MK 2011 Kano will do an animation like Up Ball except he will roll downwards after getting to a certain height. In MKX, it has armor and increased damage.\n\nIn MK11, amplifying the attack has Kano slash the opponent with his knives after striking the opponent, knocking them down and dealing increased damage. Until his other Black Dragon Ball attacks, Kano can not amplify this version if the attack misses but can still amplify it if the opponent blocks the initial hit.\n\nPsycho Cannon Ball: This version sees Kano flying all over the screen in random directions. (MKT)\n\nKnife Throw: Kano throws a pair of knives at his opponent. In MK 2011 and MKX he only throws one knife, and in MKX, this attack is called Blade Throw. In MK11, the attack is called Blade Toss and lodges into the opponent's chest. (MK, MK3, UMK3, MKT, MKvsDCU, MK 2011, MKX, MK11, MK1)\n\nIn MK 2011, the enhanced version is called Knife Toss. Kano throws two knives at once.\n\nIn MKX, the enhanced version is called Blade Toss and has Kano throw two knives in a row for increased damage. The second knife thrown has an increased hitbox and can hit ducking opponents. Kano is much more safe when this version of the attack is blocked by the opponent. The enhanced version of Knife Toss is called Multi Blades, which has Kano throw three knives at different heights that knock the enemy into the air a short distance, opening them for a short juggle.\n\nIn MK11, amplifying the attack has Kano crouch and send a second blade at the opponent. The second blade has and increased hitbox and can hit ducking opponents.\n\nBlade Swipe: Kano slashes his opponents with his knife in an upward swing. In MKX, this is known as Blade Slice. (MK3, UMK3, MKT, MKX - Cutthroat Variation)\n\nThe enhanced version is called Bloody Slice and has Kano stab the opponent's abdomen before pulling the blade up to throw them in the air for a juggle.\n\nBlade Spin: Kano spins both of his knives around his body, knocking the opponent up into the air if it connects. Only usable by MK Kano. (MKT)\n\nAir Throw: While in the air, Kano uses his legs to push the opponent to the ground. In MK 2011, he chokes his enemy in mid-air to slam them against the ground and roll away after it. (MK3, UMK3, MKT, MK 2011)\n\nChokehold: Kano would grab his opponent and lift them in the air by the throat and proceed to stab them in the chest. In MK 2011 and MKX, this is known as Choke. In MK 2011, Kano simply grabs and throttles the opponent violently, making them kneel helplessly and laughing hysterically as he does so. In MKX he does the same animation, but ends it by knocking the opponent away with a knee to their face. In MK11, this is Kano's Throw (Forward). (MK3, UMK3, MKT, MK 2011, MKX - Commando Variation)\n\nIn MK 2011, the enhanced version is called Kano Choke. Kano grounds the opponent and constantly smashes their head on the ground whilst laughing. He then quickly rolls over them to the other side.\n\nIn MKX, the enhanced version is called Strangle and has armor. Instead of bashing his knee into opponent's face at the end, Kano will stab them in the chest with his knife three times, lifting them up with the knife to deliver a punch to their face that knocks them away.\n\nKnife Toss: Kano throws a smaller, spinning knife at his opponent. This replaces Blade Throw in the Cybernetic Variation. (MKX - Cybernetic Variation)\n\nThe enhanced version is called Multi Blades, which has Kano throw three knives at different heights that knock the enemy away. When used in the corner of an arena, this can be used to continue combos in some instances; otherwise, the opponent is knocked away by the blades. The juggle effect is present outside the corner of an arena, however this window is very small. Kano is also much more safe when this version of the attack is blocked by the opponent.\n\nEye Laser: Kano shoots a laser from his eye at the opponent. In MKX, this is known as Eye Burst and will stun the opponent if the attack lands. In MK11, this is called Optic Blast and works as a projectile again. This ability replaces Blade Toss when equipped. In MK1, he moves his partner out of the way and puts his hand on their head to make them duck while he's performing the move. (MK:DA, MK:A, MKvsDCU, MKX - Cybernetic Variation, MK11 - Equip Ability, MK1)\n\nThe enhanced version is called Eye Blast, which has increased damage and again, stuns the opponent, leaving them open for another attack.\n\nIn MK11, if this attack is performed on an opponent as a Kounter or Punish, the attack turns into a Krushing Blow, with the laser beam piercing the opponent and going through them, causing blood to splatter and dealing over double the original damage.\n\nUpward Laser: Kano shoots his laser upwards to hit a foe in the air. The attack is unblockable once it hits airborne opponents. (MKX - Cybernetic Variation)\n\nThis move can be enhanced if it hits the enemy, which will make Kano quickly fire a second laser that sends the enemy flying into the air, allowing for a juggle.\n\nInner Rage: Kano concentrates for a short amount of time before covering his hands in red energy. Using this move increases the amount of damage dealt. In MKX, this is known as Power Up, and has Kano pound his cybernetic heart to activate it. It also increases his damage for a period, but this time at the cost of making Kano himself lose health over time until the buff wears off. Once Kano takes damage from an unblocked attack, he will lose the damage buff. (MK:A, MKX - Cutthroat Variation)\n\nThe enhanced version is called Charge Up which activates much faster.\n\nFist of Power: Kano rapidly lunges forward and strikes the opponent with an energy covered fist. (MK:A)\n\nParry: Kano will counter any physical attack. (MKvsDCU)\n\nHigh Kounter: Kano will counter any high physical attack by knocking the opponent down with a vicious clothesline. In MK11, this attack is called Rack Off, and has Kano perform an \"Up Your's\" gesture with his arms and has him grab the opponent by the arm, stabs them with one of his knives then shoves them to the ground. (MKX - Commando Variation, MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nThe enhanced version is called Survivor's Kounter and deals increased damage.\n\nIn MK11, amplifying the attack has Kano blast the opponent in the face with his Bionic Eye after driving the knife into their arm, dealing increased damage and knocking the opponent away about half way across the arena.\n\nEquipping the Time to Kill Jinsei Augment modifies Rack Off, allowing it to be delayed for up to four seconds. During this time, Kano recovers 2% of his health while delaying Rack Off. (MK11 - Jinsei Augment Bonus)\n\nLow Kounter: Kano will counter any low attack by pulling the enemy down to the ground, stabbing their chest with one of his elbow blades and then rolling away. (MKX - Commando Variation)\n\nThe enhanced version, Dirty Kounter, does more damage.\n\nRib Strike: Kano grabs the opponent to strike their rib cage with his knee twice before knocking them away with a knee to their face. (MKX - Commando Variation)\n\nThe enhanced version, Rib Breaker, does more damage and has armor on startup. When enhanced, the attack will connect on standing opponents during a combo.\n\nPower Slam: Kano grabs his opponent and does a German Suplex, leaping up and lawn darting them into the ground. (MKX - Commando Variation)\n\nThe enhanced version is called Power Bomb, has armor on startup and deals increased damage. When enhanced, the attack will connect on standing opponents during a combo.\n\nVege-Mighty: Kano pounds on his cybernetic heart, overcharging it with energy. This gives Kano armor and slightly increased damage on his Black Dragon Ball, as well as unlocking his Up Kano Ball. The buff wears off after a Black Dragon Ball or Up Kano Ball or after a short while. Kano can perform a Black Dragon Ball immediately after performing this ability in a combo when timed correctly. Connecting or being struck by a Krushing Blow or Fatal Blow ends this effect prematurely. (MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nEquipping the Tucker Bag Jinsei Augment modifies Vege-Mighty, granting Kano the ability to improve up to four additional Black Dragon Balls. Connecting or being struck by a Krushing Blow or Fatal Blow ends this effect prematurely. (MK11 - Jinsei Augment Bonus)\n\nBio-Magnetic Pull: Kano pulls his opponent towards him using his Cybernetic Heart. This ability conflicts with Bio-Magnetic Trap when equipped, disabling the option to select Bio-Magnetic Trap. (MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nAmplifying the attack has Kano blasts the opponent with his eye laser, which re-stands and stuns the opponent, allowing for combo extensions.\n\nThis attack can also be cancelled into after Kano does another special move beforehand, which spends a bar of offensive meter as well as allowing for longer combos.\n\nBio-Magnetic Trap: Kano throws his Cybernetic Heart as a trap onto the floor at varied distances to prevent the opponent from jumping. This ability conflicts with Bio-Magnetic Pull when equipped, disabling the option to select Bio-Magnetic Pull. (MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nThe enhanced version allows for Kano to throw his knife at the opponent and if they are near the trap, the knife pulls them towards the trap, dealing damage over time.\n\nLumbar Check: Kano grabs his opponent, hoists them above him as he lands on his back and breaks the opponent's spine on his knees. This attack is capable of striking an opponent during a Getup Roll, similar to a standard Throw. (MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nAn amplified version does additional damage, as Kano drives the blades hidden in his boots into his opponent's back.\n\nIf the attack is used as a Kounter or Punish to a Getup Roll, the attack turns into a Krushing Blow when amplified, with the boot blades plunge deep into the opponent's back, dealing increased damage and causing massive damage-over-time.\n\nSnake Bite: Kano leaps towards his opponent with his knifes out, slashing and knocking them in the air briefly before stabbing them and knocking them back down to the ground. This ability requires two ability slots when equipped. (MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nAmplifying the attack has Kano pick the opponent up with his knives embedded in their chest and bounce them off the ground, dealing increased damage and allowing for a brief juggle.\n\nMolotov Cocktail: Kano throws a bottle of flammable liquid at the ground setting an area on fire. If the opponent is in that area, they receive damage-over-time. The attack can be used at different ranges, called Close/Far Molotov Cocktail, respectively. (MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nCan combine Molotov Cocktail with Bio-Magnetic Trap.\n\nChemical Burn: Kano steps backwards and sprays the opponent with deadly chemicals at a short range, which deals damage-over-time. This attack is considered a projectile. If the opponent if hit with Molotov Cocktail, they receive unblockable damage and will be briefly stunned, allowing Kano to use additional attacks. Connecting or being struck by a Krushing Blow or Fatal Blow ends this effect prematurely. (MK11 - Equip Ability)\n\nAmplifying the attack has Kano throw a lighter at the opponent and set them on fire. This does not produce the same effects like with Molotov Cocktail. If the lighter doesn't connect with the opponent, it creates a small burning patch where it lands.\n\nEquipping the Sick Killer Jinsei Augment modifies Chemical Burn, doubling the range of the attack and doubling the attack's damage-over-time effect. (MK11 - Jinsei Augment Bonus)\n\nX-Rays/Fatal Blow\n\nX-Ray - Just the Tip: Kano plunges a knife into his opponent's right thigh, going through and snapping the femur. Before the opponent can react, Kano proceeds to stab them in the left thigh, resulting in another broken femur. Then he delivers a devastating kick to the front of the skull, causing heavy fracture damage. This attack is unblockable. (MK 2011)\n\nX-Ray - Lacerater: Kano slashes his opponent with an elbow spike, turning them around. After that, he stabs his knife into the abdomen of his opponent, and diagonally slices the opponent's ribcage in half, exposing the organs. He then grabs the opponent behind the neck, and thrusts them upwards, breaking their spine. (MKX)\n\nFatal Blow - Not Here to F#ck Spiders: Kano headbutts the foe alongside a burst with his Cybernetic Eye. He then grabs one of his knives to stab the opponent in the stomach three times, he then steps on its handle and on the opponent's face, causing them to fall over with his foot smashing their head as they hit the ground. Kano then kicks the opponent in their ribs, then stomps on his knife still buried in their stomach pressing it in further, and lastly reveals a hidden blade in his boot, which he drives into the opponent's throat, dragging his opponent's body to his front. (MK11)\n\nKameo Fatal Blow: Kano walks to the opponent and stabs their shoulders with his knives, causing them to kneel before using his bionic eye to blast their head. He then hits them with his knees to stand them up, following th player's fatal blow afterwards. (MK1)\n\nOther Moves\n\nFree-Fall Super Move: Kano hits his opponent with a charged Kanoball, knocking them to the ground. (MKvsDCU)\n\nThrow: Kano slashes his opponent in the stomach twice with a knife, then either headbutts them to the ground (Forward Throw), or stabs them in the gut and throws them over his shoulder (Backwards Throw). (MK 2011)\n\nThrow: Kano grabs his opponent and headbutts them twice and on the third strike, he launches the opponent into the air, knocking them away. (MKX)\n\nDelinquent: Kano stabs the opponent with his elbow blade then kicks them in the chest. Kano can perform follow-up attacks with this combo depending on the variation selected, with the exception of the Cutthroat Variation. (MKX)\n\nMiss Me?: Kano grabs his opponent and slams them in the opposite direction. (MKX - Commando Variation)\n\nThe combo-ender can be enhanced, which bounces the opponent after slamming them for extended combos.\n\nEar To Ear: Kano grabs the opponent and blasts them with his Laser Eye. This will re-stand the opponent. (MKX - Cybernetic Variation)\n\nStomach Ache: Kano straps a bomb to the opponents stomach, blowing them back. (MKX - Cybernetic Variation)\n\nThe combo-ender can be enhanced, which has the opponent fall to the ground before exploding into the air for extended combos.\n\nKombat Boots: Kano kicks the opponent this slices them with his elbow blade.

He seems to have very bad table manners, as shown when Sonya, Liu Kang and Johnny Cage are spying on him, Goro, and Shang Tsung later in the film. Apparently, as he states to Goro, his dad taught him how to fight honorably. Despite their allegiance, Shang Tsung and Goro have little respect for him. Goro looks down upon him as part of his broader hatred of Earthrealm humans, while Shang Tsung chides Kano's lack of dignity or manners. Kano also appears to harbor an obsessive infatuation for Sonya regardless of her hatred for him. The film expanded upon Kano's rivalry with Sonya from the games; she now had a personal interest in seeking vengeance against Kano for killing her partner. Shang Tsung hires Kano to lure Sonya into the Mortal Kombat tournament and promises to grant Kano the reward he desires for his efforts after he faces off against Sonya in the tournament, demanding that Sonya is not to be harmed but merely humiliated, claiming that he has plans for her. During their match, Kano gleefully taunts Sonya about how he murdered her partner with his wicked-looking Raptor knife, putting a \"big smile\" on him \"ear to ear\" (he also states in this same confrontation that he is not above killing his mother, as Sonya asks him if she used his raptor knife to stab her in the back, although he states that he did not). After beating Sonya harshly, Kano is caught off guard by a leg lock from Sonya, and is soon trapped between her thighs and at her mercy. Shang Tsung betrays Kano and goads Sonya into finishing him off. Despite pleading for his life, Sonya proceeds to break Kano's neck.\n\nGoddard portrayed Kano with a Cockney English accent, which was misinterpreted as Australian, leading to the character being retconned as originating from Australia. In Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe and Mortal Kombat (2011), Kano is modeled after Goddard's look in the film and speaks with an Australian accent.\n\nDefenders of the Realm\n\nKano appears in two episodes of the animated cartoon Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm. He is the main antagonist in Episode 6 (Familiar Red) and also reappears in Episode 11 (Amends). The cartoon explains Kano's past rivalry with Sonya, showing him in a flashback scene having killed Wexler, Sonya's partner, in a carefully rigged bomb (which almost killed Sonya as well). The flashback continues with a recreation of a scene in the first movie, where Kano loses to Sonya in the Mortal Kombat tournament. In Amends, they also touched Kano's relationship with Kabal, showing their past history as clan members in the Black Dragon clan.\n\nMortal Kombat: Legacy\n\nLate British actor and martial artist Darren Shahlavi portrayed Kano in Mortal Kombat: Legacy.\n\nIn the series, he is the leader of the Black Dragon organization and has been hired by the Lin Kuei to aid them in their Cyber Initiative plans. Like in the games, he has an antagonistic relationship with Jax and Sonya, having killed Sonya's partner in the past.\n\nThe last episode of the series chronologically takes place before the first, Kano is among the scientists and doctors and the Lin Kuei Grandmaster as they observe Cyrax and Sektor's tests before they undergo the procedure to become cyborgs. Kano is amused and entertained by Cyrax's enraged reaction at discovering he and Sektor had defeated two Lin Kuei who had already undergone the procedure. Kano next sees the battle between the cyborgs Cyrax and Sektor against Hydro, with Kano declaring, \"I'll put my money on the red one\", as he casually plays with his knife.\n\nIn the first episode of the online series, Kano is overseeing the production of robotic parts and weaponry in the warehouse he and the Black Dragons are using as a base. Kano heads down into the warehouse, ordering his men to work faster to meet their deadline. Kano stops one of the Black Dragons who is carrying a crate full of parts and picks up an eye piece. Though the Black Dragon member tries to explain what it is and its function, Kano only mockingly sneers in his face that he already knew what it was and orders him to work faster.\n\nThough not seen, Kano soon after captures Sonya Blade after finding her in the warehouse and intercepts a message she tried to send to Jax Briggs revealing her location. He and the Black Dragons hold Sonya hostage for two days, torturing her.\n\nKano then heads down to where they're keeping Sonya and delights in mocking and taunting her physical reaction to seeing her. Though when Sonya spits on him after he grabs her by the neck, he quickly headbutts her and pulls out his knife, threatening to cut her heart out like he did to her former partner. Kano then reveals he knows Jax and Stryker are coming, but he's set up a trap, having already moved the robotic parts and has his men in place to kill them.\n\nWhen one of his men informs him that Jax and Stryker's team have arrived, he bids farewell to Sonya and heads backup stairs. Kano then springs his trap, ordering the Black Dragons to \"Kill them all\" and a massive gunfight erupts. Though the Black Dragons and Kano are able to kill several of the cops, Jax and Stryker work together to take out several of Kano's men. Kano himself soon runs out of ammo and races off, with Jax in close pursuit.\n\nChoosing to stand his ground, Kano draws his knife and fights with Jax hand-to-hand, and though they are almost evenly matched, Kano loses his knife and resorts to grabbing a nearby high-tech weapon. As Kano and Jax struggle over the weapon, it fires and the two run away as the explosive goes off, sending them both flying.\n\nIn the second episode, Kano recovers, but when he sees Jax is still conscious, he runs off, with Briggs once more in hot pursuit. The two face off again in a deeper part of the warehouse, with Jax demanding to know where Sonya is. Kano briefly gets the upperhand in the fight after resorting to smashing Jax's head with a nearby glass bottle, and mocks Jax, saying, \"I'm going to enjoy this as much as I enjoyed torturing your sweet Sonya!\"\n\nThis proves to be Kano's undoing however, as Jax furiously beats Kano down, with the mercenary never landing a single blow. Beaten and nearly unconscious, Kano is defeated when Jax strikes him so hard across the face, he knocks out his right eye and partially collapses his skull.\n\nKano escapes justice though, and in the ensuing confusion, his men save him, dragging him out of the warehouse. He is then brought to an unknown location, where a surgery team repairs the damage done to his face and replaces the damaged portion of his skull with a cybernetic plate. As the very same eye weapon he was studying earlier is placed in his socket, Kano awakens as his new eye glows red.\n\nWreck-It Ralph\n\nKano (voiced by Brian Kesinger) appears in the 52nd Disney film, Wreck-It Ralph, as a member of the \"BAD ANON\" support group along with the other video game villains. In the movie, he performs a bloodless version of his trademark fatality on Cyril from House of the Dead, and berates Ralph for attempting to challenge the program by abandoning Fix-It Felix, Jr.. Kano's look in this movie is a combination of his designs from the game series’ first and third installments (red and black outfit with short hair on the scalp and the face). The film's credits call him \"Cyborg\" most likely as a way of avoiding a direct reference to a video game franchise that targets an older demographic compared to the Wreck-It Ralph film.\n\nMortal Kombat Legends: Snow Blind\n\nKano serves as the central antagonist of the movie Snow Blind. Featuring a future flung and far more ruthless version of the character and christening himself \"King Kano\", he and his Black Dragon clan have embarked on a mission of conquest to to rule over all of Earthrealm, raiding defenseless villages and callously murdering everyone who doesn't submit. With Kabal, Kobra, Kira and Tremor as his enforcers with an elderly Shang Tsung as emissary, Kano has pillaged and killed uncontested until the arrival of a young Kenshi, armed with his spirit sword Sento. During the climax of the movie, it is revealed that the events of the movie are a continuation of Kano's MK11 ending, having later killed Kronika at some point and used her skull and crown to run the Sands of Time. His ambitions are thwarted in a final confrontation with Kuai Liang when he is knocked into the gears of Kronika's Keep, crushing his body.\n\nSnow Blind's incarnation of Kano is decidedly much different than any previous version of the character, having converted most of his body into cybernetics, including a large retractable blade and a chest laser similar to Hsu Hao and is strong enough to fight Kenshi, Hanzo and Kuai Liang all at once and even being able to kill a rejvunated Shang Tsung. He is also able to survive having his head knocked off as it is attached to a very sturdy wire.\n\nComics\n\nComics Published by Malibu:\n\nKano appears in the Malibu Comics series with a personality and a history based on his portrayal in the 1990s games. He was also one of the two protagonists (the other being Raiden) of a 3-issue miniseries titled Rayden & Kano. During the Blood & Thunder series it is shown the origin of Sonya's vendetta against him, when he kills Lieutenant Lance, Sonya's partner, during a tournament battle by means of a heart rip. His motivations to loot the island are replaced by his discovery of the Tao Te Zan and the powers it grants. During the series' epilogue in the Tournament Edition issue, he's finally captured by Sonya and Jax and sent into custody.\n\nHe would later escape (as shown in the Breakout mini-story that came with the U.S. Special Forces issue 1°) and during the Battlewave series he would be disposed by his superiors in the Black Dragon due to his failure, only to be rescued by Raiden. Raiden would attempt to use Kano to eliminate Shao Kahn by means of a mystical sword that drew power from an individual of evil turned to the side of good, but Kano betrays Raiden and joins Shao Kahn, remaining in his forces the following issues.\n\nQuotes\n\nMortal Kombat (film)\n\n\"Good boy.

Strangely, instead of having his victory pose from the original game, MK Kano's victory pose was changed to a modified version of his Mortal Kombat 3 victory pose.\n\nThe knife that Kano uses in the Mortal Kombat film is a Gil Hibben Raptor.\n\nIn each game Kano is absent, he either makes a cameo imprisoned, a substitute fighter from the Black Dragon borrows his techniques, or both during Deception when Kira was introduced.\n\nRichard Divizio once stated that Kano's favorite food is White Castle hamburgers. However, this likely just means that they are Richard Divizio's favorite food as well. [6]\n\nAlthough Kano's cybernetics began to grow more elaborate beginning in Mortal Kombat X, the only part of Kano's body that has been actually physically modified with mechanical implants is his Cybernetic Eye. The Cybernetic Heart strapped across his chest is only worn, rather than being physically integrated into his chest as had been the case for Hsu Hao.\n\nHe appears as an enemy in Batman Arkham City Lockdown, another game developed by NetherRealm Studios, specifically during the Gotham Steel Mill challenge.\n\nThe Brazilian cartoon makers enterprise Mundo Canibal homage Kano by using his Heart Rip Fatality in the video Briga de Galo. After the Fatality, the announcer also says \"Fatality\" as a mention to the Mortal Kombat games.\n\nKano's official theme is titled, \"Use Your Might\".\n\nA modified version of Kano is featured in the Disney film Wreck-It Ralph, making him the only character from an M Rated video game franchise featured in the film. Kano even performs his iconic Heart Rip Fatality on a Zombie character in the meeting with the villains, however due to the PG rating, there is no blood or gore. He is credited as \"Cyborg\" in the film's credits.\n\nMortal Kombat\n\nKano makes his playable debut in this game.\n\nKano also debuts as the first Black Dragon clan member in the series starting in this game.\n\nMortal Kombat II\n\nKano was rumored to be in MKII through Shang Tsung's morphs, but this was proven false.\n\nKano does however appear in the stage Shao Kahn's Arena, still in his appearance from the first game, shackled in chains as a spectator. Though this stage later reappears in Mortal Kombat Trilogy, Kano, as well as Sonya, are no longer featured, though their empty prisons remain.\n\nMortal Kombat: Special Forces\n\nIn the original plans for Mortal Kombat Special Forces, the circumstances surrounding Kano's cybernetic eye would be revealed. This ultimately did not make it into the final product, with Kano having his cybernetic eye from the beginning of the game.\n\nMortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance\n\nIn the Krypt, the koffin CO contains a comedic ad for \"Kan-Os\", a breakfast cereal with a cartoonish image of Kano on the box.\n\nIn Deadly Alliance, if Kenshi's Telekinetic Contortion Fatality is performed on Kano, only his real eye pops out.\n\nIn Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance and Mortal Kombat Armageddon, Kano's alternate costume resembles his MK outfit, while if both players choose Kano as their character, his second color will resemble his MK3 outfit.\n\nIn Deadly Alliance, Kano hung Sonya Blade's hair around his neck as a symbol of their rivalry, which he tore from her head during their battle atop the skyscraper in MK3.\n\nMortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks\n\nKano appears as a hidden boss in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, and all the Black Dragon Mercenaries resemble Kano in this game.\n\nMortal Kombat vs. DC Universe\n\nIn the game, Kano’s DC counterpart is The Joker.\n\nIn Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, Kano's ending shows him turning into the Mortal Kombat equivalent of the Joker as the kombat rage drives him insane.\n\nMortal Kombat (2011)\n\nKano, along with Jax, has an X-Ray that deals 41% damage, the most damaging of all of the playable characters.\n\nTheir X-Ray Moves are two of three that cannot be blocked, along with Sheeva's X-Ray move.\n\nIn the cinematic trailer from MK 2011, Scorpion kills Sub-Zero with Kano's Eat Your Heart Out Fatality.\n\nKano is the only character whose victory pose is retained in the Challenge Tower, whereas everyone else's is changed.\n\nThough he is seen using the attack in several cutscenes of MK 2011's Story Mode, Kano's Eye Laser cannot be used as a special move in said game.\n\nHowever, the Eye Laser special does return in Mortal Kombat X.\n\nMortal Kombat X\n\nThe color of Kano's cybernetics change color depending on what variation you choose. Originally, his Cutthroat variation was going to be green, but was changed to blue later in development. His Commando and Cybernetic variations remained yellow and red, respectively.\n\nThe green coloring, however, can be seen if the player selects Kano's variationless version.\n\nKano's entrance animation alters slightly depending on his variation. If his Cybernetic variation is selected, when he catches his knife he sheathes it on his waist, while his other two variations (and no-variation) have him sheathe it on his back.\n\nKano will uses his later knives regardless of the variation when he performs his fatalities.\n\nIn one of the one of his interactions with Takeda, Kano says \"That's Not A Knife\" which is a reference to Crocodile Dundee.\n\nIf Sub-Zero performs his Bed Of Ice Fatality from the right side, the shards of ice will not go through Kano's Bionic Eye. It will penetrate through his regular eye only if performed on the left.\n\nAdditionally, any Fatality or Brutality involving Kano's eyes popping out will result in only one eye, his left eye, to pop out of its socket.\n\nInteractions with Tremor show Tremor wants to leave the Black Dragon. This is likely due to Kano abandoning Tremor in the comics once Tremor was shot and captured by the Special Forces.\n\nKano and Torr are the only characters with more than one exclusive Brutalities for a Variation that are not Secret Brutalities.\n\nMortal Kombat Mobile\n\nHis Black Dragon Card was originally a Gold card called Cutthroat that could be bought in the Store at a cost of 77000 coins.\n\nThis card was also the only card in the game without a Passive, as it merely said that the card cost less in the Store.\n\nHe is one of the few characters with a Gold Card that was upgraded to a Diamond Card, this being his Cutthroat card being upgraded to his Diamond Black Dragon Card.\n\nKano is one of the few characters with more than one exclusive Equipment Card.\n\nKano is one of twelve character cards that can kill the opponent with a Brutality, the others being Sub-Zero, Jade, Kabal, Scorpion, Liu Kang, Raiden, Noob Saibot, Sonya Blade, Skarlet, Shang Tsung, and Reptile.\n\nShao Kahn can also kill his opponent, however it is not considered a Brutality.\n\nInjustice 2\n\nKano was mentioned in Injustice 2 by Raiden, who is featured as a playable guest character, revealing that Kano recruited Bane into the Black Dragon.\n\nMortal Kombat 11\n\nKano, Johnny Cage and Jax are the only characters to have team-up cutscenes between their past and present selves in MK11 Story Mode.\n\nKano is the only character in the Story Mode whose present self dies as a result of his past self dying.\n\nKano can be also count as one of the first characters to be dressed up as DC characters, the first character who properly wore DC character inspired costume is Cassie. In ironic reverse, Kano wore a superhero costume that models DC’s Cyborg, while Cassie wore a super-villain costume inspired from Harley Quinn.\n\nKano's Move Lumbar Check which sees him drives both knees into the back of his opponent is most likely a reference to WWE wrestler Cedric Alexander, who does the same move as a finisher. Additionally, one of his Cybernetic Hearts is called Ruby's Riot Shield which may also be a reference to female WWE wrestler Ruby Riott.\n\nIn the Kustomization, Kano has one of his customizable Bionic Eyes named \"Jack's Epic Eye\". This is a reference to Irish YouTuber Jacksepticeye.\n\nKano is a primary target of RoboCop, revealed through many interactions with characters and RoboCop that Kano committed many crimes in RoboCop's universe.\n\nErrors\n\nKano's face plate has technical issues in MK 2011. The plate is invisible when he's attacked with X-Ray Moves, and it is incorrectly shown on the left side of his head for his Versus image as Player 2.\n\nIn MKX, in his default outfit when Kano crouches, his grenades clip through his right thigh and will pierce through while crouched.\n\nWhen viewing Kano's Revolution outfit in the Kollection, one can see that his Laser Eye goes over the hat, bring to question as to how the eye was placed over the hat if Kano had the eye first.\n\nThe hanging fabric of Kano's default outfit will clip through his Butterfly knives in his Cybernetic variation.\n\nThe handle for his knives for his Cybernetic variation will always clip into his thighs when crouching.\n\nThe arm wraps that hold his elbow blades always clip into his biceps.\n\nDue to needing his large knives for his fatalities, when Kano performs a fatality in his Cybernetic variations, the knives will appear out of thin air.\n\nIf Kano is struck right as he connects an Air Ball, the opponent will hover briefly above the ground before landing and standing back up. The same thing will happen with Jason Voorhees's Temple Slam.\n\nIn MK11, if one were to equip any of Kano's younger appearances without him having a shirt on, one can see in the character customization that his cybernetic heart is floating in the air and is not connected to his chest whatsoever.\n\nEquipping an appearance with a smaller shirt will result in half of the heart to not be attached to Kano's equipment.\n\nReferences"
