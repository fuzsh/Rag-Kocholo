        "text": "It was only a matter of time before someone made an attempt at adapting one of the most influential fighting games of all time. As stated above, its been a while since an attempt has been made. The last live action foray into the MK universe was a webseries created by director Kevin Tancharoen, which came at the story in a very different way from the way the story and lore are presented in the game. But, it had its high points, one of those being the return of Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa as Shang Tsung. Even though it was short lived. Regardless, it was a very mixed bag as far as an adaptation goes.\n\nBefore that, we have to go all the way back to the 90s for the original Paul W.S. Anderson Mortal Kombat film from 1995, and its “so bad its hilarious” sequel Mortal Kombat: Annihilation from 1997. (I saw both of these films on their theatrical release. I remember walking out of the first one being impressed that they did as well as they did, all things considered. While the second became legendary for just how laughably bad it was. I saw it for a friend’s birthday, and our entire group as well as the people in the theater were laughing hysterically throughout the movie.)\n\nNow, it is 2021 and a new vision of Mortal Kombat has been unleashed upon the public. Will it be as remembered and loved as the original? I very much doubt it. This version of MK was monumentally disappointing. While it had its moments of greatness, those moments are eclipsed by the bad decisions that overshadow them. There are so many times during the running time of the film where I just shook my head and asked aloud – Why? What were you guys thinking!?!\n\nThe most glaring issue with the film is its main character – Cole. A Mortal Kombat character who no one has ever heard of, least of all fans of the games, because he isn’t an MK character. Nor has he ever been one. The filmmakers decided they needed a character that new viewers could relate to, a character that could “discover” the world and lore of MK as the story progresses to introduce concepts fans have understood since its inception. This is a role that typically would have been filled by Johnny Cage, or Liu Kang (Liu knew all this information, but didn’t believe it was real until Raiden shows up and proves it to him.) In fact, Cage and Kang were those characters in many ways in the original 1995 film (Sonya also served that purpose in the original). So, the need to create a brand new character for this reason just seemed…. unnecessary. They took this decision so far, that they decided Johnny Cage wasn’t even necessary to include in the movie at all, and decided to save him for the sequel that there is no guarentee will materialize. What were they thinking??\n\nCole is about as interesting as a block of hard oak. He has little to no personality, is so generic that he stands out – in a bad way throughout the film, like a rock breaking the flow in a stream, he is painfully present throughout. The other established Mortal Kombat characters are far more interesting. Each of them are unique in many ways, and fans identify with many of them for different reasons. We have become attached to them over the years through playing the video games. There is nothing interesting about Cole. He is a generic MMA fighter (and a bad one at that, the guy loses to some other generic MMA fighter at the outset and it makes one wonder, if he can’t defeat “Random MMA fighter guy”, how is he ever going to stand toe to toe with a force of nature like Goro? Trust me, more on that travesty later.)\n\nI cannot tell you how much is wrong with the inclusion of an insert character like Cole in a beloved franchise like Mortal Kombat. It makes many instantly think, “Here they go again. Why does Hollywood think this is ever a good idea?” Lets face the truth here – it NEVER is. Forcing out an established character like Johnny Cage for your bad “create-a-character” automatically leaves a mark on your film’s ability to win over fans of the games. And I am definitely not the only one to believe this. I have not seen one review online as of yet that doesn’t point out Cole as one of the biggest missteps the Mortal Kombat (2021) filmmakers made with this adaptation. And its not just due to him being generic and boring. The filmmakers alter the lore of MK to make him fit as the “chosen one’, a position that has ALWAYS belonged to Liu Kang.\n\nIn this regard, Cole’s inclusion is not only a smack in the face to Johnny Cage fans, but a raw deal for the Liu Kang fans out there as well. Way to kick off the new movie you were obviously hoping for a sequel to… Alienate fans. Has Hollywood learned nothing from the past five or six years trying this short-sighted approach with other franchises? Because it always fails, and only ever angers the people who would pay to see your movie. The reasoning behind this choice is even more ridiculous. They claimed they didn’t want Johnny Cage in the main character position due to not wanting a “white male” as the hero. (I am so sick of Hollywood’s woke pandering. All it ever does is ruin movies, and causes fans to leave for greener pastures.) If they were so concerned with the skin color of the hero – they could have made the hero Liu Kang, but apparently that never crossed their superficial race obsessed minds.\n\nI’m going to complain about Cole a lot in this review. If you somehow liked this pointless character, your probably not going to like this review. As his inclusion is one of the worst choices these filmmakers could have made. I’ve probably already intimated that point; but it must be stated again, and hammered home.\n\nThe opening of the film in my opinion is one of the best sequences in the entire movie. It establishes the murder of Hanzo Hasashi and his family by Sub-Zero (originally revealed to be Quan-Chi pretending to be Sub-Zero in the video games; this deception was crafted in order to decieve Hasashi into accepting Quan-Chi’s deal to become Scorpion, and quest for vengeance. Quan-Chi used Scorpion as a tool for his own purposes with this falsehood.) In the movie they portray it to actually be Bi-Han who murders Hasashi and his family (The original, evil Sub-Zero. Bi-Han’s brother, Kuai Liang later joins the MK roster as the “good guy” Sub-Zero. While Bi-Han returns from death as Noob Saibot)\n\nI really enjoyed Hiroyuki Sanada as Hanzo Hasashi/Scorpion. I’ve been a fan of his since his fantastic performance in The Last Samurai (2003) and I felt he brought a brooding gravitas to the role, even though he was not utilized as much as I would have liked. The alteration of Scorpion becoming a central focus of the story very much changed the character’s story arc, and it is almost unrecognizable from the Scorpion many of us grew up loving. So, while I didn’t like the direction they went with his character, I nevertheless enjoyed Sanada’s performance as the legendary Shirai Ryu specter hell bent on revenge.\n\nAlso, Joe Taslim is menacing and cold hearted as Bi-Han/Evil Sub-Zero; his phisicality in real life worked very well in his portrayal of the ice wielding Lin Kuei ninja. Word has it that during the filming of his fight scenes, the crew had to have him slow his moves down, as he was too fast for the cameras. (Taking into consideration how good today’s cameras actually are; Joe Taslim must be an insanely fast martial artist.)\n\nThe film begins to have cascading problems that continue from here on. And while there are diamonds in the rough… there is a lot of rough. The moment Cole is introduced everything just spirals down, and the “what were they thinking!?!” moments begin to appear en masse.\n\nAs I have pointed out, Cole Young is a terribly boring, generic character whose inclusion is nonsensical and apparently political (White leads = Bad, in Hollywood these days apparently.) Its not just that Cole is a lame character, acted with all the personality of a rusty butter knife by actor Lewis Tan. At least in the original ’95 film the custom character invented solely for the movie; Art Lean, was a side character with no real effect on the story. So, his inclusion was fine. Art Lean didn’t become the chosen one. He was just there to illustrate what an overwhelming obstacle Goro was.\n\nThe filmmakers of the ’95 film utilized Art Lean for a very specific purpose; and he served that purpose well. Cole on the other hand is shoe-horned in as the hero of the story. Not only that, but they completely alter the MK mythology to conform around his existence. He is now the “chosen one” due to his being the decendent of Hanzo Hasashi (Scorpion). The problem with this, is that Scorpion and his bloodline were never the main focus of the Elder Gods’ “Prophecy”. Well, it is now! For… reasons.\n\nThis is not the only major story element that has gone through unnecessary alteration. In the original MK storyline, as well as the previous iterations of the films; Shang Tsung sent, or delivered himself – invitations for the 10th and final Mortal Kombat tournament to the greatest fighters in the world. Those who have proven themselves through sheer skill and dicipline to be the best of the best. This is in keeping with the rules of the ancient tournament created and enforced by the Elder Gods themselves. There was no way around it, and while Shang Tsung made sly attempts to subvert some of the ancient rules, he was nevertheless hamstrung by the most important of those rules. (For instance, trying to attack Earthrealm fighters before the tournament begins, or in between matches. This is all tossed out the door in this new film.)\n\nIn the 2021 Mortal Kombat film, your skill as a fighter no longer matters. You are either born with a “Dragon Mark” based on your lineage, or one is transferred to you by way of killing a person that already has one. These “Dragon Marks” are also the source of each character’s mystical powers – such as Liu Kang’s command of fire, Kung Lao’s control over his bladed hat, or Sonya’s energy rings… and Kano’s eye laser…? What? As well as Jax’s metal arms… Wait…. Double what!?!\n\nLets just pretend that Kano’s eye laser and Jax’s metal arms weren’t originally made possible through Earthrealm technology. (Kano’s eye having been installed by the Black Dragon mercenaries, and Jax’s powerful metal arms being military hardware from the US military.) Look, as stupid as it was to watch bad ass cybernetic arms grow around the skeletal metal ones the monks surgically fitted to Jax in the film… Monks are experts in cybernetics apparently, go figure… Despite this, It was a pretty fun scene when Kano unlocked his own power. (Arkana I believe it is called in the movie. Everyone must unlock their Arkana before the tournament begins, according to Liu Kang and Kung Lao; who become mentors to Cole, Sonya, Jax, and Kano. As they attempt to prepare the fighters for the 10th and final Tournament.) Each fighter’s Arkana is unlocked in a way that is personal to them. Kano’s is unlocked through Liu Kang and Kung Lao berating him for being a failure, they tell him how useless he is to them and the cause they find themselves forced to fight for. This sets Kano off, his rage at being treated like some kind of worthless loser sends him over the edge and is enough for his power to manifest itself. His first explosive eye laser blast nearly taking Kung Lao out of the game, although he saves himself by using his bladed hat as a shield to deflect the deadly blast.\n\nThe concept of the “Arkana” is a concept that is far removed from the original Mortal Kombat lore. In the video games; characters have powers for various reasons. Some of them have powers because they are gods; i.e. Raiden, and Shinnok. Some have them because they are members of a mystical ninja clan; i.e. Sub-Zero, and Smoke. Scorpion was skilled ninja, but didn’t have any powers until his death, where he was then thrust into the Netherrealm, where he gained his power over hellfire. As mentioned above; Jax and Kano’s abilities originated from Earthrealm technology – Kano’s being a cybernetic eye implant, and Jax’s powerful cybernetic arms being hardware built and installed by the US military. No one in the video games, or even the older films had to “find their inner power.” This concept utterly alters something that worked just fine the way it was. I feel, that this was a decision made to make explaining these powers far simpler for them to just use a concept that would explain them all in one fell swoop. Which, I have to say, just feels lazy. Some of the abilities, and how they got them were intrinsic parts of what made some of these characters who they are. Someone like Jax is a great example of that.\n\nThe problem with this change, is that it is takes nuance away from many of these characters when it comes to how they either recieved, or earned their abilities. Now, all you need is a “Dragon Mark” and a mentor to yell at you or beat you up to access them. Personally, I hated this change. I hated the “Dragon Marks”, and I hated the fact that fighters were now chosen by “fate” rather than their skills as fighters. (We already established that our new hero, Cole Young, can’t seem to beat a random MMA fighter, who should be beneath him if he were going to be chosen for the Mortal Kombat tournament.) In fact, it is even implied by the guy that is talking to Cole about his impending MMA fight at the beginning of the film, that Cole is known for being a bad fighter. (“I can always rely on Cole Young, the human punching bag.” “Fighting requires attacking and defending, not just throwing punches.”) It is made pretty clear, that Cole Young isn’t exactly Anderson Silva in the ring. But, he is the “chosen one” so it appears fate can turn even a crappy cage fighter into the future savior of Earthrealm. According to this movie anyhow.\n\nThe issue with the “Arkana” when it comes to our intrepid new main character, is that it is essentially made very clear that the guy is pretty useless without having activated his inner power. As each character’s power is unlocked by something personal to them, or keeping in line with their personality. Cole’s power is unlocked by, can you guess? His family being in danger! Oh, what a surprise! You establish the family in the beginning, have Cole whine about missing his family, then in the end they are the key to his “Arkana”. From the get-go once the film introduces this “Arkana” mechanic into the world, it becomes exceedingly obvious that Cole’s family will be the trigger.\n\nHow does Hollywood show just how powerful and amazing their new character is? Why, have him kill Goro, one of the toughest bad guys in the Mortal Kombat story, you know, that four armed Shokan Prince who was champion of NINE Mortal Kombat tournaments, and went undefeated for literally hundreds of years. Want to guess what Hollywood’s new Mortal Kombat hero’s power is? LITERAL PLOT ARMOR!!\n\nI could not stop laughing as I watched nobody Cole Young sprout ACTUAL fucking plot armor while trying to stop Goro from killing his family. It was mind-meltingly stupid. It ends the way you are probably thinking; COLE WINS!! Not even the mighty Goro can stand against that!\n\n(Watching Goro smash up someones barn, and car in modern day made me think of all those shitty 80s sequels where characters go to modern day Earth for no reason other than it being cheaper to film around Los Angeles rather than building actual sets. (I’m looking at you Beastmaster 2.) Imagine a movie where Goro gets stranded on present day Earth in a quest to find a t-shirt that fit him. Watching Goro smashing up the family vehicle made me realize just how absolutely absurd the direction they took for this film was. The character of Cole Young is a thorn in this movie’s side. He is the crack in the linolium that everyone sees the moment they enter the room. I cannot express how big of a mistake the inclusion of this horrendous character was in this film. As well as the decision to make him the central focus of it.)\n\nOne of the main excuses, other than “White leads = Bad” is the filmmakers wanted to be able to appeal to audiences that may not have been interested in Mortal Kombat before. This is a destructive mistake Hollywood still hasn’t learned, after all these years – not to do. They wanted someone who has never seen MK before to walk in and be able to understand what is going on as the movie lays it all out for them. The problem with this approach for this film, is that there are so many things that they just don’t explain at all for a new viewer, so much so it negates their reasoning for doing it in the first place.\n\nFor example; They never explain why Sub-Zero wants Hanzo Hasashi dead and his bloodline cut short. The names Lin Kuei and Shirai Ryu are mentioned, but not in the context of why Sub-Zero hates the Shirai Ryu and Hasashi so much. It is never mentioned. (Also, minor nitpick; why is Sub-Zero randomly speaking English during the opening sequence of the film, it was very out of place. Enough so that I spent far too much time thinking about its inclusion.)\n\nThey also never explain why Hasashi’s bloodline is so important as it pertains to the Elder Gods’ “Prophecy”. Why his bloodline? Just because he is Scorpion? But no one knew he was Scorpion until he reveals himself later in the film. This is a far more important aspect than one might think as the entire reason for bringing Cole in rather than Johnny Cage hinges on this detail. So, why Scorpion’s bloodline? Other than Raiden saving the life of Hasashi’s daughter, there is no reason given for that bloodline’s monumental importance.\n\nThis version of Mortal Kombat also gets rid of the “don’t attack fighters before the tournament” rule, a rule which caused Christopher Lambert’s Raiden to chastise Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa’s Shang Tsung in the ’95 film after he set Scorpion and Sub-Zero on the Earthrealm fighters on the trip to the soul stealing Sorcerer’s Island where the tournament was to take place. That rule is out the window, as a chunk of this movie involves characters trying to escape the Terminator-like relentless assassination attempts on them by Sub-Zero. Then later, Raiden is forced to erect a shield around his temple in order to keep Shang Tsung and his warriors from murdering his fighters before the tournament even begins. Things have definitely changed.\n\nSpeaking of the central theme of Mortal Kombat; the infamous tournament itself. After watching the film, one might ask the obvious question – What tournament? Because there isn’t one. This is a Mortal Kombat film without a Mortal Kombat tournament. It serves as a “prequel” of sorts, depicting the events leading up to the tournament. By the end of the film, characters, good and bad have died and the tournament hasn’t even started yet.\n\nI’ll be completely honest, this film is a mess. Especially if you are a longtime fan of the franchise. While I am not going to get too deep into spoiler territory other than I already have, I think you get the idea, this isn’t the Mortal Kombat most have grown up loving. Its a film that feels like there was studio influence involved in some of the decisions that made their way on screen. (Again on the Cole Young front, it has been confirmed that his inclusion was a studio decision. The director in interviews has tried to justify this inclusion, but it makes no logical sense, and is obviously a choice made based on politics rather than it being in service to the story. Stop shoving your politics into movies, Hollywood – it isn’t doing you any favors and is a driving force as to why companies like Disney and many others are losing money and fans.)\n\nCASTING\n\nKANO – In the 1995 Mortal Kombat film, Trevor Goddard was one of the actors that stole the show with his portrayal of Black Dragon leader/ex-leader Kano. His absolutely stellar performance was so good that the creators of the actual games retconned the video game version of the mercenary to be more like him, not to mention – Kano became Australian. Because he wasn’t originally. I can happily say that our new Kano doesn’t disappoint. In fact, Josh Lawson completely steals the show and is the stand out performance in the entire film. He has the best lines, the best delivery, and he utterly embodies everyone’s favorite cybernetic eyed sleaze ball. Josh Lawson was BORN to play Kano. I don’t think it is possible to cast the character better. Sadly, Trevor Goddard is no longer with us, as I would love to here his opinion on the actor who took over the role so many years later.\n\nSONYA BLADE – Originally played by Brigitte WIlson (Now Sampras, after having married professional Tennis player, Pete Sampras.) Wilson was a rising star at the time, playing Veronica Vaughn in Adam Sandler’s popular “Billy Madison” comedy, which garnered her quite a following, and made her a fan favorite as a result. But she also exuded a toughness about her that Sonya Blade sorely needed in a live action adaptation of the character. Sonya Blade is definitely beautiful, but she is also one of the most deadly women in the world. Wilson made that somewhat believable in her character, while she also brought a certain vulnerability to the role. It was a careful balance that Wilson seemed to pull off.\n\nJessica McNamee, while not as well known as Wilson was when she was included in the MK cast. McNamee regardless does a good job of portraying the tougher, no nonsense side of Sonya. However, I feel as though she, unlike Wilson’s Sonya, does not find the same balance between tough and vulnerable. There was really only one instance where we see Sonya vulnerable at all, and this is in combat with Mileena. There is little to no personal doubt in her own abilities that she had to overcome, as Wilson’s Sonya had to do. Which made Wilson’s Sonya a bit more believable and easier to identify with. McNamee looks the part, and acts it for the most part. But the writing doesn’t give her much opportunity to do anything else with the character.\n\nSHANG TSUNG – Arguably one of the best villians in the MK universe. Shang Tsung is an ancient Sorcerer who keeps himself young and powerful by stealing the souls of his enemies. He also has the power to magically change himself into literally anyone, he also commands myriad nasty magic powers that are seen throughout the video games; which includes a mastery of fire. This is a role that the filmmakers HAD to get right, and considering the previous actor who portrayed the character in the original film became an iconic representation of the character – literally to the point where they had him reprise the role in the webseries, and the newest video game in the franchise, Mortal Kombat 11. Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa turned Shang Tsung into one of the most memorable movie villians of the 1990s. His performance is still lauded as one of the best things about the original 1995 film. As such, the newest actor to play the character had some big shoes to fill. And while I really love Chin Han’s roles in past films over the years, I was honestly let down by his portrayal of the nearly immortal soul stealing sorcerer.\n\nShang Tsung (Chin Han) stealing the soul of a character in the movie. They did a great job with the effect, its just that his performance was just a little too… controlled and reserved. Han just didn’t bring the kind of gravitas or menacing presence that I expected Shang Tsung to have.\n\nChin Han plays Shang Tsung very differently from Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa. Where Tagawa stole your attention and held it as his unique, confident voice enunciated his lines with such relish, dripping with malevolence; Chin Han is straight forward and reserved, and instead of stealing my attention through sheer gravitas like Tagawa, I found my eyes straying from him to examine the characters standing behind him. Where Tagawa was charming with a simmering evil beneath; Han was matter of fact, and just… there. It wasn’t a bad performance, it was just…. a performance. There wasn’t anything that jumped out at me, nothing that made him memorable, or menacing. I don’t know if this was a choice by Han himself or the Director. But the performance just didn’t really do anything for me. And considering the character we are talking about, here. That isn’t a positive.\n\nLIU KANG AND KUNG LAO – While Kung Lao didn’t get a lot of love in the original films. I really liked Max Huang’s portrayal of the character in this film. I thought that the writers got his character’s personality pretty close to the way he was in the games. Lao lives in the shadow of his more infamous descendent who is his namesake. He is striving to live up to his anscestor’s legacy, and while he is confident, he also doubts his abilities. That doubt doesn’t really materialize in the film, but other than that, Huang’s performance is really spot on. If the character got more screen time, we might have seen him fully fleshed out. Its too bad the writers turned him into a glorified trainer for the other characters.\n\nAs for Liu Kang; I am not as positive with Ludi Lin’s performance as I was with Max Huang as Kung Lao. Lin’s performance seems very… pius, for lack of a better word. We know from the story that while Liu was a follower of the White Lotus Society of Shaolin Monks, he struggled with his beliefs and purpose within. Not to mention, that he was originally, the ACTUAL “chosen one” in the prophecy. Liu nevertheless was reluctant at first to take up this responsibility. Now that job falls to stiff as a board, Cole – Liu Kang seems to have lost something intrinsically important to his character. Due to this change, Liu doesn”t really seem as important anymore, and Lin’s performance reflects that. There is no reluctance because there is no need for it. He has been relegated to mentor status for the other fighters, rather than being the focus of the story. Maybe if Ludi Lin was given something more in the script, but sadly, he just acts and feels like an assistant to Raiden.\n\nSCORPION – Probably one of the most famous and beloved Mortal Kombat characters. Scorpion is a character that has multiple sides to his personality. An actor that has real range and depth to their performance is necessary to pull it off. And, while Sanada’s Scorpion is not as intense as the one many are used to from the games. He is regardless a fantastic choice for the role, and personally, I think really sells it. The main problem that I have is the changes the filmmakers made to the Scorpion character’s backstory, and the details surrounding it (such as the inclusion of Cole Young to that legacy.) I just wish Sanada was playing Scorpion in a better movie. Because he is awesome as the specter searching for vengeance, as well as the noble, honorable leader of the Shirai Ryu, Hanzo Hasashi.\n\nSUB-ZERO – As most MK fans know. There are two Sub-Zeros in the franchise. Both brothers. One is evil and eventually becomes the specter Noob Saibot after his death. While the other brother becomes grandmaster of the Lin Kuei and is an important ally in defense Earthrealm. The only Sub-Zero in this film is the evil brother, as it should be early on in the MK story. As the other brother doesn’t show up until later on. Joe Taslim was fantastic in the role. He exuded cruelty, and was believable as a powerful, neigh unbeatable adversary. As Sub-Zero should be. Joe Taslim is a martial artist in real life, so his skills really show in the film. As mentioned earlier, he was apparently so fast with his punches and kicks that the filmmakers had to have him physically slow his movements down to capture them properly on film. All in all, he did his job as the character well.\n\nJACKSON BRIGGS – Jax has been played by a few different actors over the years. In the original MK film he was played by actor Gregory McKinny. However, McKinny really only played him in one brief scene in the film, he really only had a couple of lines. So we really didn’t get a good idea of how he would have played the character had we had more time with him. In the sequel, MK Annihilation; Lynn Williams played the role. To Williams credit, he wasn’t bad as Jax, he was just in a REALLY bad movie. If that film had a better script and director, I think he had it in him to play a better Jax. Then we got the webseries where Michael Jai White played Jax alongside Jerri Ryan’s Sonya. I’ve always liked Michael Jai White, and thought he played the role okay. However, he didn’t get a ton of time on screen.\n\nAs for Mehcad Brooks performance of Jax; I thought he was the best thus far. He was believable in the role, and has the physical size for the role as well (some previous actors did not have the physical side locked down as much as Brooks does.) I would be happy to see him continue playing the character going forward. He nailed it – Great casting choice!\n\nLORD RAIDEN – While I adore Tadanobu Asano in other films. (His performance as Kakihara in the 2001 Japanese cult film, “Ichi the Killer”) Asano looks bored in this film. I have seen this actor absolutely steal the screen in past films, and he is just not bringing that performance that I know he is capable of here. Which is monumentally disappointing, because when I heard he was casted to play Raiden, I was excited! Like I said, I am a fan of his work. I KNOW he is capable of amazing performances on screen. It just isn’t this performance. Again I ask – was this Asano’s choice? Or the choice of the Director? After the memorable performance of Christopher Lambert in the original, one that is a standout in the 1995 outing. Then there was the abysmal performance of James Remar who was basically just playing himself in a Raiden costume. Asano’s Raiden is neither of those – Memorable, or abysmal; its just there. And I am so disappointed by that. Because I know Asano can definitely do better.\n\nOTHER CHARACTERS –\n\nREIKO – I had no idea this was supposed to be Reiko until they mentioned him by name, and my jaw dropped open. What the hell is that? That is not even close to being Reiko. He doesn’t act like Reiko, he doesn’t move like Reiko, he doesn’t look like Reiko. So why the hell did they even bother to put this character in the film if they refused to even attempt at doing him properly? Reiko was a strategic genius, and masterful warrior. What we get is a giant who can barely wield the mallet he carries around with what could be considered skill. He just seems like a brute rather than an influential general of Shao Kahn’s armies. I don’t even remember him even speaking in the film. He pretty much just roared at people… until Jax gets a hold of him that is.\n\nMILEENA – I have no clue why they decided to race swap an asian character into a black character… But apparently thats whay Hollywood does nowadays – Racial quotas! Boy, do people just love it when you choose an actor not based on how well they fit the role, but to fit the identity politics that have utterly taken over the minds of the people making movies today. While I am sure Sisi Stringer is a fine actress in her own right. She was not right for Mileena. Thats not her fault, its the filmmakers’ fault. And to be honest, she didn’t even look like a decent cosplay version of Mileena (Because I have seen far better, and so have you.) Despite her not being right for the role, her look wasn’t right either -and yes, I mean those pathetic excuses for CGI teeth they put on her. Just a bad call all around.\n\nKABAL – The Flash of the MK universe. A member of the Black Dragon Syndicate like Kano. The two of them are old allies who find themselves on opposite sides in the new film. Personally, I thought the actor for Kabal did fine, although he played the character with a more ‘non-chalant’ attitude than Kabal had in the games. Considering he is under the mask the whole movie and isn’t in too many scenes that don’t involve combat. He was alright in my book. Realistically, there wasn’t a lot required of his character the way they portray him. He is just muscle for Shang Tsung, and in that regard, he serves his purpose.\n\nREPTILE – What is it with these filmmakers and their CGI creatures? It always takes me out of the movies, because they look like cartoon characters. And the Mortal Kombat 2021 version of Reptile is no different. This version of Reptile looks like a reject from one of the Michael Bay Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies. He is on screen for a short fight and… you know what… who cares. The filmmakers didn’t so why should I? The best part of this whole scene is Kano gets to pull off one of his famous fatalities, then delivers one of the best timed fan service lines in the film. “KANO WINS!” I want Ninja Reptile. Not Jurassic World Reptile.\n\nMortal Kombat 2021 is a flawed adaptation. While there is a lot to love, there is also a lot to hate tossed in as well. The highlights are some of the performances (Kano being the stand-out) and the fan service and easter eggs. There is even an obscure easter egg for fans of the original Mortal Kombat game, which gives a nod to the exploit where you can just spam the sweep attack to win nearly any fight. Things like that are much appreciated, and brought a smile to my face as a fan. The fight scenes are really well coreographed, and well shot, genuinely. The film is gory as Mortal Kombat should be (where the originals failed miserably. (Shame on Hollywood for even thinking about making PG-13 Mortal Kombat films.)\n\nThere are some great fatalities, although I wish there was more practical effects in regards to the blood and gore, the CGI is painfully obvious and always pulls me out of a film. (A movie should NEVER utilize CGI blood. It is lazy and looks like shit. Plain and simple. STOP DOING IT.) The CGI use in modern films is always a problem for me. Unless you absolutely cannot get a shot without CGI, you should only ever use it to enhance what is already there; such as practical effects.\n\nThe story changes and the inclusion of the new Cole Young character and his mcguffin family as well as making the MK lore conform to his existence is the serious problem with this film. Johnny Cage could have easily served far better in Cole’s place, regardless of the ridiculous excuses and mental gymnastics that the filmmakers are trying to sell to fans. This has the makings of a truly good Mortal Kombat adaptation, they just fell short when it came to its execution.\n\nIts an entertaining albiet frustrating watch. However, unlike the 1995 film which has a following, and is remembered fondly by many fans, even though it was a flawed film itself, nostalgia is a powerful thing. We will have to wait and see if Mortal Kombat 2021 can stand the test of time. Personally, I am not sure it will."
