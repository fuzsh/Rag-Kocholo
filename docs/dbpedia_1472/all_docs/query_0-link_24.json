        "text": "The actor Trevor Goddard, who once had a recurring role on the ''JAG'' television series and who plays a pirate in the upcoming movie ''Pirates of the Caribbean,'' has died in an apparent suicide, investigators said on Monday. He was 37.\n\nMr. Goddard's body was found in his North Hollywood home on Sunday by a woman who also lived there, a police spokeswoman said.\n\nThe death was classified as suicide with prescription drugs, the Los Angeles County coroner's office announced.\n\nLt. Fred Corral of the coronor's office said that Mr. Goddard was involved in divorce proceedings and that his estranged wife, Ruthann, was in San Francisco during the weekend. The family includes two young sons.\n\nMr. Goddard, who was born in Perth, Australia, was a professional boxer, which led to an acting role in a beer commercial. From there he had a small role in the 1994 action film ''Men of War'' and played the martial-arts fighter Kano in 1995's ''Mortal Kombat,'' based on the popular video game. In 1998 Mr. Goddard began a recurring role on ''JAG,'' a series about Navy and Marine Corps lawyers, as Lt. Cmdr. Michael ''Mic'' Brumby of the Royal Australian Navy, a role he played until 2001. Other film credits include 1998's ''Deep Rising,'' an uncredited role in 2000's car-theft thriller ''Gone in 60 Seconds'' and the role of Grapple in Disney's upcoming ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.''"
