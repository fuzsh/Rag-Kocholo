        "text": "While Goddard's official biography listed his place of birth as Perth, Australia, and the year as either 1966 or 1965, his parents, Eric and Clara Goddard, of Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, in July of 2003 came forward to state that Trevor was in fact born in Sussex, England, his date of birth was in 1962, and that Trevor's claims to being a reformed criminal from Australia were in a fact a fabrication. He was able to fool many into believing his London accent was an Australian one, and edged out many authentic Australian actors for roles.\n\nHis portrayal of the 'Kano' character in the Mortal Kombat movie directly influenced the evolution of the character in later Mortal Kombat video games. For example, in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, Mortal Kombat: Deception and most recently in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, the character of Kano had a characteristically Australian accent and personality, as exemplified in the Mortal Kombat 1995 film."
