        "text": "The Mortal Kombat reboot has just debuted and has brought a new adaptation of the fan-favorite character Sonya Blades. In her latest iteration, Sonya is portrayed by Australian actress Jessica McNamee. The movie featured the iconic rivalry between Sonya and Kano, which ultimately led to a fight to the death between the two. While talking with THR, the actress revealed that the ultimate clash between Sonya and Kano almost didn’t happen.\n\n“I love working with Josh [Lawson], and that fight was also a late addition,” McNamee said. “As the filming progressed and we started to see this relationship come to light between Kano and Sonya, they were like, ‘Alright, I think we really need to end with some epic battle between the two.’ Initially, I think it had been a much more swift ending for Kano. So they added that fight late in the piece, and we learned that choreography maybe a week before we actually had to shoot it. They actually added an extra week of shooting so we could knock that one out.”\n\nRELATED: Simon McQuoid Talks Mortal Kombat Sequel, Notable Absences\n\nThe actress then tackled the character’s future in the hypothetical sequels, which might fish from the video game mythology for the former U.S. Special Forces soldier.\n\n“Broad strokes, I know that she ends up having a relationship with Johnny Cage,” she added. “She also has a daughter, Cassie Cage, as well. There are so many ways they can go because there’s so much backstory to all of these characters, but I would love to see that explored. I would love to see Johnny Cage enter the mix and go up against Kano. They’re such big personalities and they’re both such narcissists in their own way. So I would love to see them go head-to-head, as Sonya would be stuck in the middle of it all. So that would be cool. I also know she has a lot of history in terms of her father and her brother because they both died. So it’d be interesting to explore that. And her and Jax have a huge backstory, too, so there’s a lot of room to play there.”\n\nMortal Kombat is available in theaters and HBO Max.\n\nHave you watched Mortal Kombat?
