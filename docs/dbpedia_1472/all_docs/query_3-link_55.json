        "text": "Top Boy's Kane 'Kano' Robinson has secured his first lead movie role.\n\nThe musician and actor, who plays Sully on the hit Netflix series, will star as Izi in the streaming platform's new film The Kitchen.\n\nCreated, co-written and co-produced by Black Panther star Daniel Kaluuya, the futuristic dystopian drama promises to examine social class and the structures that confine us.\n\nIt's set in London in the year 2044, where the gap between the rich and the poor has been stretched to its limits.\n\nRelated: Top Boy's Ashley Walters reveals co-star Kano rewrites his scenes\n\nWith social housing eradicated, the working class are forced into temporary accommodation on the outskirts of the city.\n\nThe Kitchen is London's last village of residents who refuse to move out. The story centres around Izi, who lives in The Kitchen and is desperate to get out with 12-year-old Benji, who after the death of his mother is searching for his family.\n\nThe story follows how the unlikely duo battle to stay alive in a system that is working against them.\n\nThe film is written by Kaluuya (Get Out) and Joe Murtagh (Calm with Horses, Gangs of London) from an idea that Kaluuya, Daniel Emmerson (Calm with Horses) and Kibwe Tavares had.\n\nRelated: Top Boy's Saffron Hocking teases Lauryn and Sully showdown in season 5\n\nThe Kitchen is led by first-time feature film director Tavares, after his extensive work in shorts, theatre and architecture. He was also an executive producer on the acclaimed BBC sci-fi drama Noughts & Crosses.\n\nThe movie will also introduce young actor Jedaiah Bannerman, who will co-lead the movie alongside Robinson in the role of Benji.\n\nKaluuya explained that he thought of the idea after a conversation he had in a barbershop in 2011.\n\n\"In 2011, I was in my barbershop and there was a guy boasting about smash and grabs – kids doing million-pound heists in a minute, getting paid £200 to do it,\" he said. \"I saw the potential to unlock a unique story door to the inequality, fatherhood, class, joy, resilience, courage, defiance and care of London.\"\n\nAlmost a decade later, Kaluuya and his team have brought his vision to life and he said: \"[We] are immersing ourselves in a dystopian London that interrogates what 'care' means, at home and as a society and the dangers in our future if we stay indifferent to everything around us.\"\n\nThe Kitchen will be filmed across London and Paris and be released on Netflix in 2023."
