I think it's tough to say with the way they're going about MK11. Some characters are strongly reminiscent of their old selves, and some are vastly different. For Kano, I'll trust the direction they choose, but I'm hoping forms of his Cybernetic and Commando are brought back as two variations in some way. Those two may have been a bit hindered in MKX due to the system, but I'd imagine they would shine bright in MK11's system. Either way, I am at least expecting a bit that he'll be a strong footsie type character somehow someway.\n\nOr just give us the glorious Cybernetic knives, D4, and B1 so we can call it a day. What does everyone think?\n\nAlso,\n\nBUFF Kano\n\nI actually would like pretty much the same as you. I mostly played Cybernetic and Commando even though Cutthroat was definitely the most \"MKX-esque\" variation. The former two are just so much fun.\n\nThey would also, probably, be very strong in this game though, so they'll probably be toned down, but I expect a version of the key moves to make it, so that those variations can at least live in spirit.\n\nFor example, even though Cybernetic damage is part of the fun , we're probably not getting that, but I'd be PRETTY HAPPY if we had everything else, zoning, great whiff punishing, anti-airs, plus frames?\n\nAnd also good grappler Kano for the \"anti-zoner\" matchups, and maybe, this time around I'll even like rushdown Kano (Although, hopefully I get to do that part with J.Cage).\n\nWhat are we expecting for Kano this time around?\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd think Kano will play a lot like how Baraka plays from the demo build with a lot of +frame normals and strings like Baraka's + on block D4.\n\nNow that MK11 is actually focusing on footsies, it seems like an obvious bet that Kano will be a footsies/zoning character again. But I just hope they don't go too far with it.\n\nI don't like the sound of Kano with an amazingly safe mid projectile again.\n\nI don't want MK11 to be a projectile-fest 100% of the time.\n\nIMO it should be a really fast recovering safe HIGH projectile that complements his footsies and ranged pokes with a short ranged command grab or something to make him viable up close.\n\nBut mostly, I hope his focus will be his pokes and ranged strings.\n\nI don't want him to be a character that gets 100% of his damage from his thrown knives like Kitana and her fans. Instead I think it'd be way more cool if he used his high knives and upball to control the pace of the match kind of like MK9 Kano (who I mained a million years ago).\n\n...\n\nSo I was thinking, wouldn't it be absolutely badass if Kano's super spammable super safe high knives were on a resource that he had to reload every so often kind of like Ibuki from Street Fighter 5? That way he could have this amazingly crazy projectile that you have to slowly work your way in on, but he can't slow down the match to a crawl so it wouldn't be boring to play against or spectate.\n\nThat'd be cool af.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd think Kano will play a lot like how Baraka plays from the demo build with a lot of +frame normals and strings like Baraka's + on block D4.\n\nNow that MK11 is actually focusing on footsies, it seems like an obvious bet that Kano will be a footsies/zoning character again.

I'd be down for it. Especially this part-\n\nIMO it should be a really fast recovering safe HIGH projectile that complements his footsies and ranged pokes with a short ranged command grab or something to make him viable up close.\n\nThat sounds like something right up a few of our ally. As much as I'll take my mid knives I'd take this as well. As long as Kano plays like Kano I think we'll all be ecstatic.\n\nIf they go the 3 variation route instead of the \"build your character\" route for tourney play, I hope they do something like V1-Godly footsies and poke heavy (variation specific normal or special to enhance footsie toolset), V2- Zone heavy with solid pokes, V3- Footsie and poke heavy with command grabs. I guess most similar to something like Baraka is currently, but a bit different to fit Kano. It's funny because Kano is probably one of the main characters I expect them to fit perfectly into his players style so I have zero worries one way or the other.\n\nThe only thing I'd outright say I don't want is all variations to turn into Sonya-esque play. I can't play that style so I'd be heartbroken, but the likely chances of that are slim to none.\n\nI actually would like pretty much the same as you.

We couldn't be any more on the same page!\n\nI love his current design. He looks like such a slimy dirtbag! He also looks quicker, wilier, like the kind of maniac who would tuck himself into a ball and slam his ass into your face.\n\nI want lasers and balls (and you can quote me out of context on that!). I don't really care about knives. But if I can light my opponent up with eye lasers and launch myself all over the screen as a ball of doom, I'm all in.\n\nThey touched on it a bit with Cybernetic, but that would be awesome if they expanded on laser moves in MK11. Specials, strings, KB, whatever or however. It would add so much flair and visuals to his attacks. Something reminiscent of Zod's laser, a couple of more strings involving it. So much potential there."
