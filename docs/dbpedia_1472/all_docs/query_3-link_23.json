        "text": "David Kano (Technical Section)\n\nAge 32, born 1967. He is usually addressed by his surname. He took part in an experimental programme on Earth to link the memory and calculating ability of a computer to the thinking ability of the human brain. A complex of fibre sensors was implanted in the cortex of his brain: the other 3 subjects ended up as cabbages, but Kano was the success story (Guardian Of Piri).\n\nKano is the computer expert (replacing Ouma in Breakaway). He addresses the computer as \"she\", and is defensive of others criticising computer errors: Black Sun, Guardian Of Piri, The Last Sunset, The Testament Of Arkadia. An Eagle pilot in The Full Circle. He takes Paul Morrow's seat in The Last Sunset and he assumes command in Mission Of The Darians.\n\nIn the early episodes, he is normally stood by the computer wall in Main Mission. In Missing Link he gained his own desk, on a rotating pedestal. It is the only desk, apart from Koenig's, with a screen (never seen in action).\n\nKano's other interests include chess, which he has programmed computer to play: he plays Mathias in Black Sun and Koenig in Dragon's Domain. He reveals a temper in Missing Link.\n\nKano featured in 23 episodes of Year 1 (not Breakaway).\n\nIn the Powys novels, Kano appears in Operation Deiverance as Ouma's night shift relief. He is beaten and drugged so mutineers can reprogramme commlocks. Ouma is killed and Kano takes his job. Kano is the one who destroys Main Mission after they have moved the computer core to Command Center. Some months before they encounter Psychon, Kano links up to the computer again repeatedly; he dies at the start of Children of the Gods. His consciousness has entered the computer, but is unable to communicate, until the events of Born to Adversity. At the end of the episode he interfaces with Psyche to save the Alphans, and restores Main Mission for them.\n\n\"Commander. Alpha cannot survive without computer.\" (Black Sun)\n\n\"You clumsy fool! Is it so difficult to carry a tray of coffee?\" (Missing Link),\n\n\"I swore I'd never go through this again\" (Guardian Of Piri),\n\n\"Computer never tells stories.\" (The Last Sunset)\n\n\"I hate back-seat drivers.\" (The Full Circle)\n\n\"Destruction of Alpha..imminent\" (The Infernal Machine),\n\n\"Computer's not a crystal ball, Commander. She can only predict on specific data.\" (The Testament Of Arkadia)\n\n\"Don't worry, it can only get worse.\" (The Testament Of Arkadia)\n\nClifton Jones profile\n\nDialogue\n\nCharacter profile (Technical Notebook in Cybermuseum)"
