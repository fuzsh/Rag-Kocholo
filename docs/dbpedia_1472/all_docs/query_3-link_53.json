        "text": "Sully took a shot at becoming Top Boy in the latest season of the Netflix crime drama after a short spell of attempting to turn his back on the world of drugs and crime. However, by the end of the series, he found himself fully emerging in his former drug empire with his partner-in-crime Dushane (played by Ashley Walters). So much so, at the slightest thought of Dushane setting up Jamie as their \"retirement plan,\" Sully took matters into his own hands and shot Jamie dead.\n\nAudiences still cannot get over the show's ending and want to know more about the man behind Sully. Newsweek has everything you need to know.\n\nWho Plays Sully on Top Boy?\n\nDrug boss Gerard John \"Sully\" Sullivan in Top Boy is played by Kane Robinson.\n\nRobinson is not only an actor but a hugely successful rapper and songwriter, known as Kano.\n\nKano was born in East Ham, London to Jamaican parents. As a teenager he was a talented soccer player, having trials for English Premier League teams Chelsea, West Ham United and Norwich City but ultimately opted to pursue music.\n\nIn the early 2000s he shot to prominence on the grime scene, alongside acts such as Wiley and Dizzee Rascal. He released his debut single \"Ps and Qs\" in 2004 and released his first album Home Sweet Home in 2005.\n\nHis second album, London Town, was released in 2007 and featured vocals from Craig David, Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn, Kate Nash and Vybz Kartel.\n\nIn 2008 he released his third studio album 140 Grime Street, dropping his fourth album Method to the Maadness in August 2010.\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus Kano released his fifth studio album Made in the Manor in 2016. It is his most successful to date, reaching number eight in the UK Charts and securing a spot on the highly coveted Mercury Prize nominee shortlist in 2016.\n\nMade in the Manor also won Best Album at the 2016 MOBO Awards.\n\nIn 2019 he released his sixth album Hoodies All Summer, which was also nominated for a Mercury music award.\n\nAs for Kano's acting, he is best known for portraying Sully, a role he originated in 2011 in the first season of the show (now known as Top Boy: Summerhouse on Netflix).\n\nHe reprised the role in 2013 for the show's final season and did not pursue any other acting projects until Top Boy was revived in 2017. For the Netflix series, he reunited with his original Top Boy co-star, Ashley Walters, who plays Sully's best friend and sometimes enemy, Dushane.\n\nIn 2007, Kano starred in the short film Point Blank as Akil. After the first season of Top Boy, he appeared in the 2012 thriller Tower Block as Mark, in a movie about a group of residents living in an apartment block who are targeted by a sniper after witnessing the murder of a teenager.\n\nIn Tower Block, Kano starred alongside Sheridan Smith, Jack O'Connell, Ralph Brown and Russell Tovey.\n\nAway from the world of entertainment, Kano has his own brand of Jamaican rum called Duppy White.\n\nKano is not the only actor with a music background to appear in Top Boy. Ashley Walters is also a rapper and songwriter, known as Asher D, Simbi Ajikawo, who stars as Shelley, is best known as rapper and singer Little Simz and rapper NoLay reprised her role as Mandy, Dris' girlfriend, for the latest series.\n\nTop Boy is streaming on Netflix now."
