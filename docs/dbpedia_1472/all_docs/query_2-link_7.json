        "text": "Just days after the mysterious death of Trevor Goddard in his Hollywood home, conflicting stories have emerged about the Australian actor's lifestyle.\n\nHis Hollywood agent and lawyer both described Goddard as a supremely fit and happy 37-year-old, a talented actor and loving father of two young boys.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Coroner's Office, however, is investigating what could be a seedier side to Goddard, including reports he had ''a long history'' of abusing prescription drugs and cocaine.\n\n''Going into this investigation we believe there may be both illegal and prescription medications involved so we are going to screen for those specific drugs to see what drugs are in his system, if any,'' LA Coroner's Office spokesman Craig Harvey said.\n\nAn autopsy performed on Goddard in LA failed to determine a cause of death, although the coroner's office said initial investigations pointed to ''a possible suicide by drug overdose and the drugs may be a combination of illegal and legal drugs''.\n\nBut Goddard's LA-based lawyer Jennifer Rocco disputed the actor and former professional boxer committed suicide.\n\n''This was a fighter, he wasn't a quitter,'' Rocco said.\n\nResults of toxicology tests taken at the autopsy should be known in four to six weeks.\n\n''The cause of death is currently deferred,'' Harvey said.\n\n''That means the doctor has held off placing a final cause of death until additional tests that have been ordered are back.''\n\nGoddard's girlfriend found the actor's body in his North Hollywood home on Sunday.\n\nGoddard, born in Perth, was best known for his role in the hit TV show JAG and has scored roles in numerous big Hollywood films, including Disney's upcoming action adventure Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\n\nHarvey said prescription drugs that were prescribed for Goddard and ''prescription drugs that were not prescribed for him'' were found in the home.\n\nAccording to a preliminary coroner's report based on the police investigation and interviews with people who knew Goddard, he and his girlfriend had an off-and-on relationship because of the actor's drug use.\n\n''That is apparently the reason that she had put distance between her and him because of his drug use and she took the position he wasn't interested in helping himself, she couldn't help him so she needed to get distance between her and him,'' Harvey said.\n\nThe coroner's report also said other Goddard acquaintances attempted to persuade him to receive professional help.\n\n''There are numerous instances where people have indicated they tried to get him into re-hab programs but he would not go into those programs,'' Harvey said.\n\nThe coroner's report also said Goddard was involved in a bitter divorce and child custody battle with his actress wife, Ruth-Anne Goddard.\n\n''That appears to be a factor in all of this,'' Harvey said.\n\n''He apparently was in the process of divorcing his wife. From what I read here in the report he was obviously concerned about the outcome, that it was going on.''\n\nRocco and Goddard's Hollywood agent, Erin Connor, painted a different picture of Goddard, both denying any knowledge of the actor using illegal drugs.\n\n''Absolutely never, I knew nothing about it ever,'' Connor said.\n\n''No-one in this office did and neither did the people who he worked with.''\n\nThe agent signed the Australian up soon after he walked into her Hollywood office four years ago.\n\nAt the time Goddard was with another Hollywood agent and was working on JAG, but Connor said she was tantalised by his personality and acting resume.\n\n''It was his humour, his insight, his intelligence, his talent,'' Connor said.\n\n''He had a terrific talent resume, we were impressed by everything.\n\n''At the time he was on JAG and then we re-negotiated his JAG contract with him.''\n\nRocco, who represented Goddard in his divorce and custody proceedings which began late last year and were due to be finalised next week, said the actor was on pain killers for a number of old and new injuries and he also suffered from an irregular heartbeat.\n\nShe does not believe Goddard committed suicide but does not rule out the pain killers and irregular heartbeat possibly being a cause of his death.\n\n''I know he was on prescription drugs because he broke both his hands because he was a prize fighter,'' Rocco said.\n\n''He also had just recently broken his ankle in the Pirates movie and he re-broke it so the non-prescription drugs might have just been from the doctor on set.\n\n''I think he tore tendons, his Achilles, and he had a herniated disc in his back and I knew he was on prescription for the pain on that.\n\n''And he had something for his nerves because he hated to fly and he also had an irregular heartbeat.\n\n''That's why I can only see this as an accidental death. It was a pure accident.''\n\n- AAP"
