        "text": "As I love to say it, Mortal Kombat (2011) or MK9 will probably be one of those games where it all came together. There are really some obvious references to the movie such as the boat found in the Courtyard, Shang Tsung uses the phrase \"YOUR SOUL IS MINE!\" from the movie, Liu Kang meeting Kitana at the first tournament, and not to mention Kano himself. Kano had the late Trevor Goddard's look in MK vs. DC though the references were made clearer in MK9. Not MKX or MK11 but MK9 gave a portrayal that felt like Goddard never died at all. Goddard's performance as Kano was so good it caused Kano's background to be changed from Japanese to Australian.\n\nWhat fans may not notice is that Kano's knives vary from game to game. In MK9, we see that Kano himself has nearly the same set of knives he had from the MOVIE back in 1995. Yup, it's really a very welcome nod. One of his tag combos is called Ear to Ear - a reference to the movie line where Kano described the brutal way he killed Sonya's partner, thankfully, off-screen. Also, the storyline has changed that from a thug who just wanted to steal Shang Tsung's gold to becoming an ally even before the invasion. The MK movie also had both Kano and Shang Tsung working together since the first tournament. Not to mention the Sonya chapter also has Shang Tsung bring Kano to fight Sonya. Though I wish Kano said, \"I've studied all your moves!\" during Sonya's chapter."
