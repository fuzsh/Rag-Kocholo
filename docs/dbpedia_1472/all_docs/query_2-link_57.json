It made for a fitting memorial. It's sad how many shows have to pay tribute to their cast members...seems like more than normal this past year.\n\nYes, he did overdose. They think it may have been a suicide (he was 37).\n\nHe was Mic Brumy on JAG and is also the Australian bushman in the Hoover Floormate commercials (which I have seen running again) and is also in Pirates of the Caribbean (released after his death).\n\nI missed a lot of the show itself -- basically caught the end where Mac tells Harm it'll never work.\n\nAmazing they had footage of all of them singing \"Waltzing Matilda\" and Goddard walking away.\n\nThat scene was from a couple of seasons ago when he was done with his duty with the US and he was heading back to Australia. I also thought it was very fitting.\n\nMac said it would never work, but she had that \"look\" in her eye.\n\nIt was a fitting tribute. I'm going to miss him. I know he's in POC - I've seen it 5 times, and have yet to spy him. Does anyone know which character he played?\n\nOriginally posted by Mickey Nut 50\n\nIt was a fitting tribute. I'm going to miss him. I know he's in POC - I've seen it 5 times, and have yet to spy him. Does anyone know which character he played?\n\nI haven't seen the movie but a web search says the character he played is called \"Grapple\". I think he's one of the undead pirates.\n\nI also came across info that says his death was ruled as not a suicide but caused by a combination of heroin, cocaine and the prescription drugs Valium and Vicodin in Goddard's body. I guess he also posed as Australian when he was really born and raised in England."
