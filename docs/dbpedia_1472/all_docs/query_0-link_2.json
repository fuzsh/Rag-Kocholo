        "text": "Trevor Goddard (October 14, 1962 - June 7, 2003) was a former professional boxer turned actor. His best known roles are Kano in the first Mortal Kombat movie and Lieutenant Commander Mic Brumby on JAG. His final appearance on-screen was Grapple in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\n\nHis performance as Kano in Mortal Kombat became the source of the character's evolution in the games from expediate American to Australian. Goddard, who was English, actually used a Cockney accent for the character, but the Australian origin stuck due to his accent being misinterpreted.[1]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
