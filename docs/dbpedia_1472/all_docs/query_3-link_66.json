        "text": "Mortal Kombat movie producer Todd Garner has been discussing Australian bad boy Kano who is played by Josh Lawson, an actor not really known for playing ass kicking thugs. You may recognise Lawson from comedy series Superstore in which he plays the egotistical pharmacist Tate Staskiewicz who, to my knowledge, does not rip anyone’s spine out or fry them with his laser eyes.\n\nThe good news is that, according to Garner, we should not worry about Lawson’s ass kicking credentials and Kano is quite literally, the dogs.\n\n“He’s killing it. He’s just dogs off chains,” Garner told comicbook.com. “We’re like, ‘Go ahead, say whatever you want.’ And he says the craziest stuff in this movie. He’s just out of his mind and he’s the perfect guy for it, because he just doesn’t care. I mean that character is known for that. It was like throwing everything away. It’s just so great to have him, and Jess [McNamee] is doing amazing, you know they haven’t done this kind of stuff before. And so it’s the theory of Rising Tide Raises All Ships. When you see these guys doing it, you’ll probably see if she comes on set, literally Jess with dumbbells, going like this. You know, everybody’s off camera and everybody’s like, ‘Oh shit, okay. I’ve got to go stretch.'”\n\nJust in case the phrase puzzles you, in sailing circles when the wind is very strong it is sometimes said to be blowing “dogs off chains”. This means that it is strong enough to pull a dog from its tether chain, so I guess Garner is trying to say Kano is like explosive storm and is unpredictable. Maybe.\n\nThe first trailer for the rebooted Mortal Kombat film was recently released and it is packed full plenty of gore, special moves, and a surprising large cast of characters.\n\nThe story follows a new character, MMA fighter Cole Young, who is completely oblivious to the world of Mortal Kombat but soon learns of his heritage when Sub Zero hunts him down. He teams up with Jax and Sonya and soon finds himself in the punchy kicky world of the game, meeting Raiden, Kano, Liu Kang and other familiar characters. Greg Russo recently tweeted about the movie and said “All I can say is the bar for opening scenes has been set…”\n\nThe cast includes Cole Young (Lewis Tan), Liu Kang (Ludi Lin), Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim), Raiden (Tadanobu Asano), Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee), Jax (Mehcad Brooks), Kano (Josh Lawson), Shang Tsung (Chin Han), Scorpion (Hiroyuki Sanada), Kung Lao (Max Huang), Mileena (Sisi Stringer), Nitara (Elissa Cadwell), and Kabal (Daniel Nelson).\n\nThe new Mortal Kombat movie is out this April 15th, in cinemas if they are open in your part of the world and also a day one release on HBO Max in the United States."
