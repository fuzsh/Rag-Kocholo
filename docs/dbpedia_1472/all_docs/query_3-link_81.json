Please god no!\"\n\nEdit: Third thought: \"Gears of War 4 this year. JD Fenix as Xbox One exclusive?\"\n\nScorpions, Mileena and Kitanas voice actors were all perfect too but seems as though they're changing alot of the voice actors :( McConnohie was perfect for Kano and I do hope he still is.\n\nLiam was awesome as Spartacus. But I don’t see how his voice would be a fit for Kano. For anyone who watched Spartacus, you know what I mean. Just because he has an Aussie accent, doesn’t mean he’s a fit for Kano. Liam has more of a hero-type voice.\n\nAgentK\n\nLiam was awesome as Spartacus. But I don’t see how his voice would be a fit for Kano. For anyone who watched Spartacus, you know what I mean. Just because he has an Aussie accent, doesn’t mean he’s a fit for Kano. Liam has more of a hero-type voice.\n\nThis is why it put me off. You're right, he has a soft heroic voice. Don't get me wrong, he was great as JD and is all-round a great talent, but I just can't picture him as a gruff bad guy.\n\nAgentK\n\nLiam was awesome as Spartacus.

Liam has more of a hero-type voice.\n\nThat accent in Spartacus was an English accent he put on. I've heard him do a rough Aussie accent, I've also met him in person at a comic con here in Australia. I just think it's strange that out of the blue, an Australian Actor was at the LA reveal, don't you? Which means he recieved an invite. Bit suspect. Especially since it seems like all the voice actors are being replaced.\n\nBut yes, he could very well be Kano's son!"
