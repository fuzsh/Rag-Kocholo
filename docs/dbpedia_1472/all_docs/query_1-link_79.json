        "text": "You ever heard the phrase, “so bad it’s good.”? That’s what we’ve got here with ‘Mortal Kombat’. From the off, don’t go into this expecting it to be a ‘Citizen Kane’ (1941) or a ‘Schindler’s List’ (1993) because quite frankly, it’s not. That being said, sometimes a film comes along and strikes such a perfect balance that it finds itself in the marvellously incredible category of: So bad, it’s good! There’re few examples of cinema that’re ultimately pretty awful, yet still somehow have a unique charm.\n\nBefore watching, make sure that you’ve got a healthy heart because ‘Mortal Kombat’ is cheesy enough to block anyone’s arteries! Based on a (fantastically great) videogame series known for it’s in-ya-face violence and over-the-top characters, this film was never going to be famed for its subtlety. With videogame movies, there’s a certain amount of fan-service that needs to be included. One-liners, character looks and action that an audience expect to see. Though it’s great to have these in there, as a stand-alone film, the dialogue and characterisation suffers as a result.\n\nCharacters get very brief backstories. These are filled out well in the games but if someone was to watch this film without playing the games, they’d only have the on-screen action to rely on in getting to know the characters and their developments. All you really need to know is that Kung-Fu saves the world against monsters and bad guys. (That’s a great film pitch in and of itself but I digress.) With a large cast, the sparce information leads to some SUPER exposition-heavy dialogue and relationships between characters feeling extremely forced.\n\nIt’s fair to say that this film didn’t win any awards for its acting. Liu Kang (Robin Shou), Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) and Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) are decent enough in giving a portrayal that’s in line with their videogame depictions. Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) is the stand-out bad guy. Over-acting to a tee, this sometimes-comical performance of the sorcerer of souls is well-fitting with the film’s ‘over-the-top’ tone. The audience want nothing less than over-the-top, just like the game. On the other hand, The Aussie (but sounds Cockney-British for some reason) Kano (Trevor Goddard) is just irritating, and Raiden (Christopher Lambert) isn’t anything like his videogame self…and for some reason sounds like he needs a lozenge like really bad.\n\nSome aspects of this film can’t help but be a little poorer than other films released in the same year. This is primarily down to budget. With only $18 Million (compared to CGI icons like ‘Jumanji’ (1995), made with around $65 Million) the CGI for ‘Mortal Kombat’ was always going to look like it was created on a PlayStation 2, with costumes looking like they were about $20 off Amazon. This kinda lead to the characters looking like budget versions of themselves. (Like Goro (Kevin Michael Richardson) looks more or less like his videogame counterpart only a little more anaemic.) It’s not enough, however, to distract the audience from the story, and at the end of the day it’s really your call on whether they did a good job on this considering what they were given. I’m 50/50.\n\nThat being said, this film’s makers knew what its audience wanted! If you’re not a ‘Mortal Kombat’ fan, this whole film will seem bat-shit crazy to you, but the fans wanted to see just two things:\n\nSick fighting\n\nCool magic\n\nAnd they definitely got that. There’s some great fight choreography, especially when the pace amps up toward the end of the film.\n\nAnd by the way, you can’t talk about ‘Mortal Kombat’ without talking about the AWESOME theme song. (If you’ve not heard it, GO LISTEN TO IT … after you finish reading this, of course.) It’s one of my favourite bits of movie music and they’re not shy about using it. Being played quite a few times throughout the film, but like a good pair of jeans, it gets better with each use. Along with the fight choreo, the music is a high point of the film. And whilst we’re appreciating the great parts of this film, there’s some really good set design that looks like it was taken straight out of the game.\n\nA reason why many videogame movies fail is because, to the audience, they don’t feel like the games they’re adapted from. ‘Mortal Kombat’ avoids this by structuring the film like a game. With mini boss battles scattered throughout and the protagonists receiving power-upgrades (in a way), not only do the characters feel like they do in the games (for the most part) but the way the film is built enhances this even further. This is why ‘Mortal Kombat’ has reached ‘cult status’ with its fans. It would’ve been nice to see the poster boys, Scorpion (Chris Casamassa) and Sub-Zero (François Petit), have a bit of a stronger showing as fan favourites but then this film would’ve been too perfect for the fans… and they gotta save something for the sequel!\n\nAs a film-fan, this one leaves a lot to be desired but that’s because it wasn’t made for film-fans. Created for videogame fans, and more specifically ‘Mortal Kombat’ fans, it delivers on everything such an audience would want to see. They’re not fussed about watching an acting master class, or some visionary directing. They want to see some dope Kung-Fu done by supernatural ninjas to the sickest theme song whilst Shang Tsung says “Finish Him!” amongst other classic catchphrases. It also has one of the cheesiest-action-1990’s- cliff-hanger endings ever. Very rarely is a film so aware of its audience, and that’s how they can go about making a film that’s so bad turn into something that’s actually a great watch.\n\nVerdict:\n\n49 Fatalities out of 100 (Finish him!)\n\n… 89/100 to me though!\n\nFollow me on twitter using the button below:"
