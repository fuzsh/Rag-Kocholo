The pic screams, your soul is mine lol!\n\nJax / Terry Crews...i like Michael Jai White but Crews would look badass as Jax!\n\nSonya Blade / Alison Larter...i would say Uma Thurman, ScarJo or Charlize Theron but lets be real here\n\nKano / Liev Shreiber...seeing as how he portrays being an asshole effectively in movies and looking like kano i'd say he's the right fit.\n\nRaiden / Jeff Bridges...Never gonna happen but hey lemme dream a bit.\n\nKitana / Roselyn Sanchez... I feel she looks a bit like her\n\nDidn't add the ninjas or cyber ninjas cause let's be honest any asshole can put on a costume and cover his face up.\n\nLiev can play bearded Kano, if he needs to, as well!\n\nHonestly, I felt Christopher Lambert did a very good job as Raiden, let's be honest...only Raiden and Johnny Cage were liked in this film. Now, I'd vote for Linden Ashby as JC as well, but I doubt the guy looks as youthful now. Raiden wouldn't matter with some years.\n\nRyan Reynolds probably would be a good fit for JC, however. Terry Crews is probably the most ripped black actor on the planet, so, naturally...he complements Jax rather well!\n\nJeff Bridges would be great though, I'd just want him to play The Dude, but dressed like Raiden."
