        "text": "Australian actor Trevor Goddard, who played Lieutenant Commander Mic Brumby on the long-running CBS series JAG, was found dead at his North Hollywood home of a suspected drug overdose, authorities said.\n\nGoddard's girlfriend discovered his body on a bed at about noon on Sunday, Los Angeles County coroner's office spokesman Craig Harvey said.\n\nMr Harvey says a preliminary investigation indicated his death was a possible suicide by an overdose of as yet unknown \"illicit, illegal\" drugs.\n\nNotes were discovered at Goddard's home, but investigators did not characterise them as suicide notes.\n\n\"There was nothing in the notes indicating that he meant to take his life,\" Mr Harvey said.\n\nThe notes were addressed to a friend.\n\nInvestigators think Goddard died sometime after 9:00pm local time on Saturday after having a telephone conversation with a friend from his home.\n\nAn autopsy is set for Tuesday.\n\nA former professional boxer, Goddard was \"discovered\" while competing at a light-heavyweight bout and asked to appear in a series of beer commercials, according to his Web site.\n\nHe built a career on portraying villains in many of Hollywood's top action movies, including tough-guy Kano in New Line Cinema's Mortal Kombat.\n\nHe was best known to US audiences from his recurring small screen role as Mic Brumby on the military drama Jag from 1998 to 2001.\n\nGoddard had just completed work on Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom."
