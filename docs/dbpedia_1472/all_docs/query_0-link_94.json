        "text": "Trevor Goddard was an English actor who is best remembered for appearing in films like 'Men of War', 'Mortal Kombat' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'. He also had a recurring role on the television series 'JAG'. He spent his early youth in England where he played the drums and occasionally provided vocals for Bromley punk bands. He later participated in light heavyweight boxing before relocating to the United States to become an actor. He gained popularity for portraying the antagonistic roles of Keefer in the action film 'Men of War' and Kano in the martial arts film 'Mortal Kombat'. He then faked an Australian identity to become eligible for the role of Lt. Commander Mic Brumby on the legal drama series 'JAG' (1998-2001). His last film was 'Pirates of the Caribbean', which released after his accidental death from drug overdose in June 2003."
