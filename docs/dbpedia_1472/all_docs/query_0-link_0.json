        "text": "English actor (1962–2003)\n\nFor the South African cricketer, see Trevor Goddard (cricketer).\n\nTrevor Joseph Goddard (14 October 1962 – 7 June 2003) was an English actor. He was best known for playing Kano in the martial arts film Mortal Kombat, a live action adaptation of the popular video game series. Lieutenant Commander Mic Brumby in the television series JAG and main villain Keefer in the action film Men of War (with Dolph Lundgren and JAG co-star Catherine Bell).[1]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nGoddard was born in Croydon, London, England, in 1962. Between 1974 and 1979, he attended Ravensbourne School, Hayes Lane, Bromley, London. A punk in 1977, he helped form a band at school called The Belsen Horrors (the name of which came from a Sex Pistols track). First a drummer, then the lead singer, he and his band lasted until 1978. Later, sometime between 1979 and 1980, he was the drummer in another Bromley punk band called The Vamp. This group was led by Wayne Cregan, who was one of the first members of X-Ray Spex. Bromley was closely linked with the early punk movement – first through the Bromley Contingent (the first fans of the Sex Pistols), and three famous punk singers who came from this town: Poly Styrene (X-Ray Spex), Siouxsie Sioux (of Siouxsie and the Banshees) and Billy Idol – who like Trevor, attended Ravensbourne School for Boys.\n\nFor much of his career, he claimed to be of Australian descent[2] and often played Australian characters.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nHe appeared in cameo roles in many television shows prior to 1995. That same year, Goddard played Kano in the film adaptation of Mortal Kombat. His performance as Kano became the source of the character's evolution in the video games. However his accent in the film was mistakenly interpreted as Australian, which led to Kano being portrayed as an Australian in future installments.\n\nHe would go on to act in other films such as Gone in Sixty Seconds, Men of War (with Dolph Lundgren and future JAG co-star Catherine Bell) and Hollywood Vampyr. He played a short-tempered mercenary in the 1998 film Deep Rising with Treat Williams and Famke Janssen. Goddard played in the television drama series JAG as Lieutenant Commander Mic Brumby and was featured in TV commercials for the Hoover FloorMate.\n\nHe made his last on-screen appearance in the 2003 film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 8 June 2003, Goddard was found dead in his home in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. He was 40 years old. Initial reports indicated that Goddard was in the process of getting a divorce and that suicide was suspected.[2][3] An autopsy later showed that Goddard died from an accidental drug overdose of heroin, cocaine, temazepam and vicodin.[4]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1992 Inside Out The Other Criminal Segment: \"The Leda\"\n\nDirect-to-video release 1994 Men of War Keefer 1995 Mortal Kombat Kano Illegal in Blue Mickey Fuller Direct-to-video release The Break Nails 1996 Fast Money Regy Prey of the Jaguar Damian Bandera Direct-to-video release 1997 Dead Tides Scott First Encounter 1998 Deep Rising T.
