        "text": "Mortal Kombat (1995)\n\n“Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.”\n\nOne of my favorite films of all time and as it so happens to be, the best video game movie so far produced. DO YOU DISAGREE!?!? COME AT ME, BRO! This came out a year after the Street Fighter movie in which the 90’s tried desperately to cash in on the rising popularity of video games with films. And 90% of those films were trash and this one is also kind of trash, but this film right here is like a dumpster fire. Majestic and glorious to behold.\n\nIf you’ve ever played any of the games you know the set-up: Earth has to defend its realm every generation from an opposing realm full of monstrous folks in a martial arts tournament. That’s the film in short, but it leaves out so much. There’s a ninja with ice powers! There’s an undead ninja who drags his opponents to hell. There’s another ninja (if you can’t tell, this film has a lot of them) who is an invisible reptile monster.\n\nAnd while those are all cool characters, this film is saved by three actors:\n\nThe first of them is Linden Ashby as Johnny Cage, a pretty-boy Hollywood kung-fu star who is interested in getting famous, getting laid and spouting off quip after quip. And his character gets the worst of it in the film! Other characters have to fight okay opponents but Johnny Cage has by-far the most difficult opponents back to back. It’s bullshit and he overcomes them because he’s fucking awesome.\n\nThe second is Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Shang Tsung (as shown below) who is acting at 110% this whole film. Everything Tagawa does in this film is believable. When he devours a soul, that’s Tagawa doing that. No special effects. He’s doing it through SHEER ACTING TALENT. His portrayal is also amazing for the fact that he is putting emphasis on EVERY SINGLE WORD he delivers. He’s great.\n\nBut the best part of this film, a part so great that the Mortal Kombat series adopted it for the rest of their games, is naturally Trevor Goddard as Kano. Prior to this movie Kano was just this weird asshole with a cyborg eye. Goddard literally elevated Kano into an actual character by turning him into a drunken Australian (I know, redundant). He’s so over-the-top and he draws all of your attention every time he’s on screen, be it talking with Tagawa or Goro the four armed muppet.\n\nThis is a classic drunk movie. If you’re by yourself on a Friday night and can’t think of something to watch, boom just watch this. It’s always good. Get some drinks on the table, pop this movie in and prepare your body.\n\nIn other words…\n\nThe Rules\n\n#1. Take a drink for every reference to the video games series.\n\n#2. Take a drink for every quip.\n\n#3. Take a shot every time Shang Tsung pronounces a “Fatality”, “Flawless Victory” and/or devours a soul.\n\nThe Drinks\n\n#1. The Sub-Zero: For ol’ frost ninja here any standard margarita will do but the main thing is you want it to be COLD.\n\n#2. The Scorpion: We need a drink so hot, so vicious that you’re toilet is going to be screaming GET OVER HERE. In a shaker muddle 2 slices of grapefruit and 2 dashes of green Tabasco sauce afterward add 3 oz of Gekkeikan Haiku Sake, .5 oz lemon juice, .75 oz Agave nectar and ice. Garnish with a grapefruit slice & fresh mint sprig.\n\n#3. The Reptile: With 1 oz spice rum, 1 oz silver tequila, 5 oz of Mountain Dew (or any knock-off brand) and a couple splashes of lime juice you’ll have a cocktail that is so acidic I wouldn’t dare touch it (but only because of my acid-reflux disease).\n\n#4. The Goro: This is a simple drink for our reigning champ of Mortal Kombat, the prince of Outworld! You’re going to take four cans of beer, place four different straws in each of them, tape the ends of them together and drink from all four of them at the same time. It will end you but what else do you expect, he’s the champ…\n\n#5. The Raiden: If you could find it, I’d say this cocktail would absolutely contain Steven Seagul’s Lighting Bolt energy drink but it has been discontinued because God hates us! So.. We’ll have to settle for:\n\n#6. The Shang Tsung: With a bevy of souls at his command, the sorcerer’s drink is a series of “mini-cocktails.” Take a shot glass, fill it half-way up with a mixer and the other half with liquor. A standard arrangement would be a mini-gin & tonic, a mini-rum & coke, a mini-screwdriver & a mini-Jägerbomb. These are his captured souls he’ll send your way, defeat them if you are so worthy.\n\nThe Food\n\nI think for this film we ought to just mimic the feasts presented to our Earth realm champions on Shang Tsung’s island, which appears to be meat and lots of it. So lets say we’ll have an assortment of finger foods for our appetizer (tiny tomatoes, grapes, sliced up vegetables, nuts), with our entree being a huge turkey leg. In addition we’ll have loafs of bread and dipping sauces. The point is, you ain’t using a fork for this. And for dessert? Ice-cream, as to remember the noble warrior that was Sub-Zero.\n\nThe Dark Crystal (1982)\n\n“Another world, another time, in the age of wonder. A thousand years ago, this land was green and good – until the Crystal cracked. For a single piece was lost; a shard of the Crystal. Then strife began, and two new races appeared: the cruel Skeksis, the gentle Mystics. Here in the castle of the Crystal, the Skeksis took control. Now the Skeksis gather in the sacred chamber, where the Crystal hangs above a shaft of air and fire. The Skeksis with their hard and twisted bodies, their harsh and twisted wills. For a thousand years they have ruled, yet now there are only ten. A dying race, ruled by a dying emperor, imprisoned within themselves in a dying land. Today, once more, they gather at the Crystal as the first sun climbs to its peak. For this is the way of the Skeksis. As they ravaged the land, so too they learned to draw new life from the sun. Today, once more, they will replenish themselves, cheat death again, through the power of their source, their treasure, their fate – the Dark Crystal. But today, the ceremony of the sun gives no comfort. Today, an emperor lies dying. Today, a new emperor must seize the throne.”\n\nMan, this film is weird. Not quirky & cute weird. This film is really, fucking weird… Probably why its a cult classic because no other film is going to present such a…. Such an original story. Vomited straight from the mind & soul of Jim Henson, this is a fairy tale movie that hearkens back to the Grimm stories which means it is horrifying in parts.And because my best friend, for countless years, couldn’t even finish this out of fear I settled him down & we delved into a brave new world full of scary muppets.\n\nPrepare yourself, you will see things you can not un-see.\n\nThe Rules\n\n#1. Take a drink anytime, “Gelfing,” “Skeksis,” “Crystal,” or “Please” is said.\n\n#2. Waterfall your drink anytime a creature is having its life essence drained away.\n\n#3. Slowly waterfall your drink anytime there is a shot of the Mystics walking towards the Castle of the Dark Crystal.\n\nThe Drinks\n\n#1. The Dark Crystal: Starting us off will be a powerful concoction, used to drain the very life essence out of people and sour the whole world. The cocktail will be 1 oz of 100 proof citrus rum, 1 oz of 100 proof grape Jolly Rancher vodka & 5 oz of grape soda with a lone grape rock candy dropped in it.\n\n#2. Essence of Podling: Harsh and with a swing from the hammer of nature, this is a cocktail for the forest Podlings. 3 oz of fresh pink grapefruit juice, 1 & 1/2 oz of London dry gin, and 1/4 oz of St. Germain all combined in a shaker, pour out and top off with some Indian Pale Ale and a grapefruit twist.\n\n#3. Essence of Gelfing: An exotic cocktail for an exotic speices like the Gelflings. 6 oz vodka, 4 oz lychee juice, a splash of vermouth and 2 lychees for garnish.\n\n#4. The Fizzgig: This will be like a hairy navel but with some extra teeth to it (Do you get it? DO YOU GET IT!?!?). 3/4 oz of 100 proof vodka, 3/4 oz of peach schnapps and 5 oz of orange juice.\n\nThe Food\n\nFor this film we’re going to get a bit rustic and down to Earth. Our appetizer will be a salad with every weird looking and often forgotten vegetable in it. Radishes, turnips, ect… Just… Odd… We’ll follow that up with your standard stew and some barbecued turkey on the grill. We want that turkey dark and crispy, like our good friends the Skesis. Finally for dessert, some purple rock candy to chomp on."
