        "text": "Wait…is this actually going to happen? After all these years are we actually going to see Mortal Kombat return to the big screen? That has been the hope. While fans have gotten the web series, the big screen has eluded the franchise ever since the god-awful Mortal Kombat: Annihilation hit theaters back in 1997, when I was too young to know just how stupid it really was (though, in my defense, it didn’t take me long to realize this).\n\nBut, that was then, this is now, and now there are some pretty passionate people trying to get this movie made. Last month, writer Greg Russo showed off a completed script, and with Simon Mcquoid on board to direct, it looks like this could happen. The next stage of it all is casting. Who do you get to play these iconic and violent characters?\n\nRELATED – Mortal Kombat 11: Prologue Video Shows Raiden’s Confrontation With Shinnok\n\nThe folks over at That Hashtag Show are reporting that Australian actor Joel Edgerton is the top choice to play the cyborg merc, which is a pretty solid fit. In addition to being an actor, Edgerton has done a solid job in the directing arena with films like The Gift, so he’d be a great boon for the production. The outlet also had a bunch of character descriptions for the flick.\n\n“COLE TURNER – A washed up boxer that still puts up a good fight. He loves his daughter Emily and will do anything to protect her. He is recruited to fight in Mortal Kombat and turns out to have a mysterious upbringing.\n\nEMILY – Cole’s 12-year-old daughter who is already a skilled boxing trainer. She proves to be tougher than she looks.\n\nKANO – The large, rugged Australian ex-special forces turned merc-for-hire wanted by Interpol for arms dealing and drug running. He’s killed a lot of people yet still has a goofy attitude.\n\nLORD RAIDEN – The Thunder God leader of the humankind’s contestants in Mortal Kombat. He oversees their training for the tournament.\n\nSONYA BLADE – The tough blonde dressed in military gear and ready to become a stronger champion.\n\nJACKSON “JAX” BRIDGES – With “Arms like cannons” he recruits Cole to the Mortal Kombat tournament.\n\nLIU KANG – A Shaolin warrior from the White Lotus society that has the ability to throw fireballs.\n\nKUNG LAO – A stoic warrior monk who throws his hat like a deadly frisbee.\n\nSUB-ZER0 – The ice ninja with deadly eyes hidden behind a gruesome mask.\n\nMILEENA – The female Outworld assassin dressed in leather armor and wielding deadly sais.\n\nSHANG TSUNG – The ageless Outworld general that oversees the tournament and it’s fighters.”\n\nSome fans may notice the serious lack of characters like Scorpion and Kabal, and while they aren’t on the list, the outlet states that there is a “good chance” they will pop up anyway, but I’m not sure where that speculation comes from.\n\nSo what do you think? Is Edgerton a good fit? Personally, if he were to jump onto this, I think the credibility of this project would take a significant step up, but let us know your own thoughts down below!\n\nDon’t forget to share this post on your Facebook and Twitter using the buttons at the top!
