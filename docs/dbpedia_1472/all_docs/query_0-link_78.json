        "text": "Trevor Goddard, who had a recurring role on TV series “JAG” and plays a pirate in the upcoming movie “Pirates of the Caribbean,” was found dead in his North Hollywood, Calif., home on Sunday June 8. An autopsy was planned; an overdose of illegal drugs was suspected, but authorities were backing off from an earlier summation of suicide. He was 37.\n\nPerth, Australia, native was a professional boxer whose physical skills led to an acting role in a beer commercial. From there he landed a role in the 1994 action film “Men of War” and played martial-arts fighter Kano in 1995’s “Mortal Kombat.”\n\nIn 1998, he began a recurring role on military TV series “JAG” as Lt. Cmdr. Michael “Mic” Brumby, whom he played until 2001.\n\nOther film credits include 1998’s “Deep Rising,” 2000’s “Gone in 60 Seconds” and Grapple in Disney’s upcoming “Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.”He is survived by two sons and his wife, Ruthann, who police said was estranged from him and in the process of being divorced from Goddard."
