Bang Pa-in is popular among Thai couples because this was the site of the first Western-style marriage in Thailand.

On August 26, 1918, Prince Prajadhipok Sakdidej (King Rama VII) and Princess Rambhai Barni Swastiwat (Queen Rambai Barni) registered their marriage at the Vorapat Piman Throne Hall, Bang Pa-in Palace.

This was the first time ever that a Thai couple said “I do” and exchanged rings – diamond rings in this case. Diamond rings were also given to the guests as party favours.

The Bang Pa-in District Registration Office will offer marriage services on Sunday from 8am and will even present lucky couples with a memorable gift.
