        "text": "Tomorrow, Queen Sirikit of Thailand will celebrate her 90th Birthday! The glamorous Princess who became the popular Thai Queen Consort for almost 70 years and is now the much respected Queen Mother, Queen Sirikit possesses an incredible jewellery collection, and so for the past few days leading up to her Birthday, we have been featuring some of the most prominent pieces from Queen Sirikit’s Collection, ending with the spectacular Thai Diamond Fringe Tiara!\n\nThai Diamond Fringe Tiara | Diamond Tiara | Thai Tiara | Diamond Bandeau Tiara | Sapphire Suite | Thai Emerald Necklace | Diamond Earrings | Fabergé Diamond Bird Brooches | Diamond Bracelets | Thai Royal Tiaras\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe versatile Diamond Fringe Tiara, which can be worn on in a open ‘halo’ or a coronet form, as well as a necklace, is one one of the oldest pieces in the Thai Royal collection, thought to date from Queen Saovabha Phongsri, whose husband, King Chulalongkorn acquired many jewels during his travels in Europe. The Tiara was first pictured on Queen Rambhai Barni in the 1920s, notably worn for the Coronation of King Prajadhipok of Thailand in 1926.\n\nQueen Sirikit began to wear the Diamond Fringe as a necklace in the 1960s, beginning with the King and Queen’s landmark Tour of Europe in 1960, paired with her Thai Tiara and Diamond Bandeau Tiara, and later with her Diamond Necklace Tiara. The Fringe was also worn as a necklace by Princess Bejaratana in the 1960s.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Queen Sirikit began wearing the Diamond Fringe as a Tiara, beginning with the Iranian State Visit to Thailand in 1968, and then later for the British State Visit to Thailand in 1972, as well as for a couple of Banquets and Portraits through the 1970s. The most recent appearence of the Diamond Fringe Tiara came for a Banquet during the Swedish State Visit to Thailand in 2003. Lets hope this Royal Heirloom makes a reappearance soon!\n\nThai Diamond Fringe Tiara | Diamond Tiara | Thai Tiara | Diamond Bandeau Tiara | Sapphire Suite | Thai Emerald Necklace | Diamond Earrings | Fabergé Diamond Bird Brooches | Diamond Bracelets | Thai Royal Tiaras\n\nShare this:"
