        "text": "Event background\n\nAmidst the ongoing crisis in Myanmar, triggered by the military coup in 2021, millions have been forced to flee their homes, seeking safety within the country and across its borders. In commemoration of World Refugee Day, Asia Justice and Rights (AJAR) in partnership with the Asia Research Center for Migration of Chulalongkorn University (ARCM), the Rohingya Association in Southeast Asia, Spirit in Education Movement (SEM) and SEA Junction aim to raise awareness and understanding of this ongoing humanitarian crisis.\n\nOn Thursday, 20 June, at 9 a.m. at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok a full day event will be held consisting of panel discussions, exhibitions, and film screenings. Through these activities, participants will share insights into the complex issues surrounding forced migration in Myanmar and the region.\n\nThe contribution of SEA Junction includes a photo exhibition of Tamwe, a Burmese photojournalist and documentary photographer, who recently won the World Press Photo for his photos of armed struggle in Myanmar. The exhibition photos take a more symbolic approach presenting portraits of people with tattoos referring to people’s resistance to the coup in Myanmar. These moving photos were first exposed at BACC as part of the exhibition “Trails of Absence and Symbols of Presence: Loss and Protest in the Myanmar Spring Revolution” featuring also artworks by artist Sai on 2-21 April 2024.\n\nMore details will be provided soon. For more information, please email: info@seajunction.org or phone/wa: +66970024140\n\nOrganizers:\n\nAsia Justice and Rights (AJAR)\n\nAJAR is a non-profit organization, based in Jakarta, Indonesia, whose aim is to contribute to the strengthening of human rights and the alleviation of entrenched impunity in the Asia-Pacific region. Its work focuses on countries involved in transition from a context of mass human rights violations to democracy, where it strives to build cultures based on accountability, justice and a willingness to learn from the root causes of mass human rights violations to help prevent the recurrence of state-sanctioned human rights violations. For more information, see www.asia-ajar.org.\n\nAsia Research Center for Migration of Chulalongkorn University (ARCM)\n\nARCM, based in the Institute of Asian Studies in Chulalongkorn University, is an internationally recognised center of excellence in social science research.

Since then, we have significantly expanded our thematic areas and now include projects on all forms of international migration in Southeast Asia, with a particular emphasis on Thailand as a sending, receiving and transit country.

SEM provides education in Thailand and the wider Southeast Asia region that is based on ecology, right livelihood, engaged spirituality and local wisdom.
