Serving iconic London landmarks including Big Ben, Tower Bridge and Tower of London, the new vehicles support the growing desire for greener tourism options, with 79% of travellers globally saying they want to use environmentally friendly modes of transport while on holiday. The agreement sees Zenobē financing the e-buses, in the company’s first retrofit project, as well as providing a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to enable Big Bus to be more proactive and agile with their energy costs. Big Bus’ existing 10-year-old open-top Ankai diesel buses are making the switch from diesel to electric, after being repowered with a 328 kWh LG Chem Battery and powertrain, by Equipmake Limited. Zenobē has also installed 10 temporary Direct Current (DC) chargers at Big Buses’ Wimbledon depot.

The center of the conversation was the future of electric vehicles (EVs) in Indonesia. They delved into the essential role that the private sector plays in shaping the EV ecosystem and contributing to the country's sustainable transportation vision. One of the highlights of the FGD was the presentation of the ICCT's research, \"The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis for EV in Ride-hailing Fleet in Indonesia.\" This insightful analysis sheds light on the economic viability of EVs within ride-hailing fleets, a crucial aspect of promoting environmentally friendly transportation options. We are proud to endorse and support the government's initiative to transform the transportation sector. By actively engaging in discussions, we are committed to providing reliable and sustainable mobility alternatives for the communities were we are present. #Peopledriven #inDrive #SustainableMobility #EVFuture\n\n🚗🔌 **Driving into the Future: Celebrating Electric Vehicle Trends and Indonesian Innovators!** 🔌🚗 🌍 Embracing Sustainability, Igniting Progress 🌱⚡ Rev up your excitement as we dive into the world of electric vehicles, where innovation meets eco-consciousness! 🚀 From the heart of Indonesia, we proudly showcase the electric vehicle trend that's transforming the way we move. 🚗⚡ 🔋 **Charge into the Future:** The Electric Vehicle Trend 🔋 Electric vehicles are more than just a trend – they're the driving force behind a cleaner, greener future. 🌿🔌 With zero emissions and cutting-edge technology, EVs are paving the way for a sustainable tomorrow.

The design looks so chic. #HyundaiIoniq5 #ElectricVehicles #EcoFriendly #SustainableTravel Electric vehicles (EVs) do offer a significant reduction in air pollution compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. #CleanEnergy #AirQuality However, they introduce challenges in battery disposal and resource scarcity. #BatteryRecycling #ResourceManagement Used EV batteries need to be recycled or repurposed to prevent environmental harm, #SustainableSolutions and the mining of materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel for batteries has raised concerns about sustainability and ethical sourcing. #EthicalMining These issues highlight the need for advancements in battery technology, improved recycling infrastructure, and the development of more sustainable mining practices to address the environmental footprint of EVs. #Innovation #GreenTech The Indonesian government is championing the shift to electric vehicles with a robust subsidy program to ramp up EV sales and fast-track their uptake. This strategic move is designed to bolster the electric motorcycles and cars market, facilitating a switch from traditional combustion engines. It's part of an overarching plan to tap into Indonesia's abundant nickel resources for EV battery production. Despite facing hurdles such as EV affordability and the need for more charging stations, this push signals a strong commitment to a greener, more #SustainableTransport future. #ElectricVehicles #GreenEnergy #EcoFriendly #IndonesiaEVInitiative\n\n🌿🚲 Seoul makes history: First South Korean city to earn carbon credits from public bike sharing program🌿🚲 Seoul has become the first local government in the country to receive carbon credits for its public bike sharing program, marking a major milestone in the city’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions and promote eco-friendly transportation🌍🚴 “It is meaningful that Seoul has become the first local government to secure carbon credits through a public bike share initiative,” said Yoon Jong-jang, head of Seoul’s Urban Transportation Department With thousands of bikes available at convenient stations across the city, Seoul’s public bike sharing system, Ttareungyi, has revolutionized the way residents and visitors get around.
