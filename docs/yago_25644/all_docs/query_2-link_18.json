Queen Rambhai Barni, consort of King Rama VII granted her royal appliance to exhibit in the museum, and in service for public in 1980. Later, King Prajadhipok's Institute was tasked with the museum management and was granted the permission from the Department of Public Works and Town & Country Planning to use its former 3-storey office building as King Prajadhipok Museum\n\nThe museum is classified into 6 exhibition and service zones as:\n\nFirst Level Exhibition Room – This presents Her Majesty the Queen Rambhai Barni's biography, royal duties and characters, notably Her Majesty's childhood days, marriage and trips in Thailand and abroad.

The story about the museum can also be found in this room.\n\nThird Level Exhibition Room – The room features the royal decorations, clothes, hats and shoes.
