        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThe world population has increased steadily from the past to the present days. Presently, the United Nations reports that the expected amounts of older people have risen from 962 million worldwide in 2017 to 2.1 billion in 2050 and 3,100 million by 2100 [1]. Thailand is considered one of the world’s rapidly aging societies with a total population of 66.5 million, of which 12.1 million are older people or approximately 18.2% of the total population [2]. In 2018, the proportion of the elderly population reached a hundred [3]. Thailand will become a “full-fledged aged society” when the proportion of older people reaches 20%, and the country is expected to enter a “super-aged” society in 2031 with the proportion of the population aged 60 years and over reading 28% of the total population [2].\n\nAs medical technology has been developed to be more efficient. As a result, the average age of the population is longer. In Thailand, the average life expectancy at birth is increasing [4]. The report from Population Projection of Thailand, 2005–2025 by the Institute for Population and Social Research, Mahidol University, the life expectancy of Thai people has increased and people live longer, men have an average age expectancy of 69.1 years in 2010, which increased to 71.1 years in 2020; and women have an average age expectancy of 75.7, increased to 77 years respectively [5]. The increasing number of older people indicates the likely future trend of morbidity in the population. Older people will have to deal with greater risks of illness and chronic diseases which require long-term care; for instance, diabetes, amnesia, paralysis, bone and dental diseases, cancer, etc. These chronic conditions require ongoing treatment [6].\n\nDiscomfort feelings from illnesses in older adults may affect the health of the elderly themselves and their caregivers, including the long life span and increasing age of life with increased complicated illness [8]. Increasing longevity means more people will be dying in very old age, but little is known about the preferences of older people regarding their care at the end of life [9,10]. Knowledge and understanding of older persons’ perspectives about death, dying and the last period of life are prerequisites for the health care provider to enable good palliative care.\n\nIn accordance, the concept of a good death is gaining attention among people from both domestic and overseas. It can be seen from the National Strategic Plan about the end-of-life enhancement of well-being, in the years 2014–2016; which defined the meaning of good dying as “to die well means dying with enough appropriate and relieving symptoms from physical and mental sufferings; taken care of spirituality corresponding to one’s beliefs, religion, and culture, including being able to complete one’s unfinished intention or mission, being able to express one’s desire for the final care for the peaceful death and human dignity [11].” Meanwhile, the changes in the Thai social context there has been a change from the past relatives have intimacy, sickness has relatives to take care of, children take care of parents when death occurs often in the home, and children learn to prepare for the sick. But in the current state, deaths often occur in hospitals. The role of caregiver for relatives is shifted to focus on care in a nursing home, which deprives relatives or caregivers of the opportunity to care for elderly patients who are in the later stages of life. Some elderly people may want to receive palliative care at home to provide being in a familiar place and environment, being well cared for, and being warmed by family members.\n\nFrom the literature review on a good death, it was found that most studies reflect the variety of perspectives from health care teams [[12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]], patients [15,19], caregivers [20], and relatives [17,20]. The knowledge gained from these studies confirms and reflects a good death through experiences from many perspectives of those involved. Although, a good death has been a central concept of palliative and end-of-life care since the beginning. The original model was to keep patients free from unpleasant symptoms without discomfort in areas of psychological, emotional, social, and spiritual [21]. The meaning of a good death and its composition of it has, however, been changing [21,22]. It is a subject that is difficult to quantify scientifically but is influenced by philosophical ideas, which are believed to be culture-based issues. This has been affirmed by the evidence that decision-making about good death and end-of-life issue was different among racially and ethnically diverse groups and being aware of dying and accepting that the death will occur [23,24].\n\nAccording to the previous studies, the perceived good death was mostly obtained from a group of health personnel [[12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]], terminally ill cancer patients, and their caregivers [17,20]. It was found that there was no study among the group of older adults whose roles and responsibilities are to provide care and have direct experience in caring for older people who are living in the final stage of life or dying, and to differences in culture, Western culture has values concerning the process of dying, dignity, and autonomy [25]. The characteristics of dying with dignity and privilege of Westerners emphasize the self-determination of death ways, and having the power to control one’s own life, including not being dependent on others, or not being a burden on others, even in the final moments of life. Whereas in Eastern cultures there is acceptance of death. It is considered that life does not end at death but begins a journey to a new world [25]. Therefore, the researcher viewed their experiences and perceptions toward the phenomenon of mortality as valuable to gain insights because the information was obtained directly from experienced older adult caregivers for preparation for a good death.\n\nThe gap that causes the lack of knowledge even partially may affect the healthcare team professionals to miss an opportunity to understand the various aspects of giving a comprehensive view of mortality and care among the older adults. Therefore, to understand the real needs and perceptions towards the meaning of the good mortality of the older adults in the community that will lead to the provision of services among the healthcare team professionals must be taken into account. The knowledge gained from this study can be used as a guideline for providing comprehensive knowledge-based services entirely to the needs of the older adults with diverse health conditions, lifestyles, and treatment or being in the terminally ill conditions as in the context of Thai society.\n\nConsequently, the researcher was interested in understanding how “good death” is perceived by older adults in the community living in a semi-urban district of a province in the central region of Thailand, and the importance and necessity of doing this research clearly on the issue will benefit the development a care system that provides the needs for the older adults who are in the final stage of life.\n\n2. Methods\n\n2.1. Study design\n\nThis study was qualitative research that seek knowledge and perceptions on a good death according to the experience of the elderly who had firsthand experience in caring for terminally ill patients. The perceptions of individuals towards the study issue are subjective and complex. The researcher obtained data using a semi-structured interview as a guideline in the in-depth interviews along with field observations and field recordings. Data were obtained from interviews and analyzed using qualitative content analysis.\n\n2.2. Setting\n\nThe researcher obtained the data at Bang Nang Li Sub-District, Amphawa District, Samut Songkhram Province. The physical location of an area is approximately 5.58 square kilometers or 3,488 Rai, a lowland area with rivers and canals scattered throughout the area, consisting of 5 villages, 802 households, 987 families, a total population of 3,828 people, 1,868 males, and 1,960 females. Most of the people are Buddhists, and the main occupation of recruited key informants is agriculture, such as planting coconuts, grapefruit, bananas, lychees, etc., followed by employment in industrial plants such as coconut mills, palm sugar mills, etc. This selected district showed the diversity of the populations in terms of educational and occupational levels and backgrounds. In addition, the surrounding of the study area is a semi-rural sub-district, semi-urban. This should represent the reflection towards the way of life and the perceptions of a good death in the community.\n\n2.3. Participants\n\nThe data were collected between October 2019 to January 2020. The researcher approached key informants through gatekeepers who are village health volunteers (VHV) who meet the inclusion criteria by employing a purposive sampling method. There was a total of 14 key informants. The researcher set the inclusion criteria for selecting the informants as follows: 1) older person aged 60 years and over; 2) having direct experience in caring for terminally ill patients; 3) able to communicate in the Thai language; 4) living in Bang Nangli Sub-district, Amphawa District Samut Sakhram Province; and 5) willing to participate in providing information.\n\n2.4. Data collection\n\nThe researcher collected data from all the key informants. The duration of the interviews lasted about 45–60 min for each key informant. Interviews were scripted and tape-recorded using an audio recorder after obtaining consent. Text data were analyzed using field note analysis and content analysis. The transcripts were read, and responses were categorized by themes. The researcher analyzed along with the data collection and reviewed all the data with the informants afterward for triangulation purposes. To determine the trustworthiness of the study, Lincoln and Guba’s criteria including credibility, dependability, transferability, and conformability were considered [26].\n\nThe researcher learned the concepts, theories, and practice regarding qualitative research skills including research methodology, data collection tools, research analysis, ethics, and related topics. The researcher developed a semi-structured interview guideline to use in the process of data collection to obtain relevant information using observations and in-depth interview techniques.\n\nRegarding the process of data collection, the researcher started asking general questions with the purpose to build relationships and assess key informants’ attitudes with common questions including “How are you today?“or “Are there any interesting activities today? etc.” The researcher started asking questions related to their experiences and perspectives of a good death by using in-depth interview guidelines and semi-structured interview questions with initial questions covering the perceptions and experiences of care for terminally ill patients. For instance, “How do you feel about being a primary caregiver for terminally ill patients, could you please describe?” “What are your perceptions towards a good death?” and “Could you tell me about your experience in taking care of terminally ill patients?” In case the key informants were not able to clearly explain their feelings or situations, the researcher would ask additional questions using “probing questions”. Types of questions included “Could you please explain more about the issues you told me? And is it possible to provide further detailed information?” This technique could help create meaning about a good death described by the key informants. During each interview, the interviewer first introduced the background and aim of the study and ensured the principles of confidentiality and voluntary participation were clear to the participant. Data collection was stopped when data saturation was achieved.\n\n2.5. Ethical considerations\n\nThis study was approved by the Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University Ethics Committee Human Research, Thailand. The approval number was COA.1-047/2018. The researcher informed key informants regarding the objective and detailed information before performing the study, the informed consent forms were obtained from the older adults. Key informants gave informed consent before taking part in the study. The researcher was concerned about their privacy and respected their decision to participate in the study. Key informants were able to withdraw from the study anytime without having any impact on their decisions. The rights of the informants were protected. The results of this study and the moral principles were also considered as follows: 1) respect for a person and 2) beneficence or non-maleficence and justice.\n\n2.6. Data analysis\n\nThe researcher analyzed the qualitative data using the content analysis method which applied the process of step-by-step analysis [27]. The procedures started by listening to the recorded conversations, transliterating conversations into letters word for word, and reading carefully the transcripts of the dialogue to gain insight and understanding of the main points. The researcher took the key points and created a list and code of information individually; then general information was analyzed and categorized. Codes samples of the transcripts identified the similarities and differences. The researcher started looking for the relationships of each category until creating a conclusion by considering relationships from different categories and writing them as the main subject matter to answer the study [27].\n\n2.7. Trustworthiness\n\nRegarding the credibility of research trustworthiness [28], the study covered the accuracy and reliability of the data operated by a team of experienced researchers in the field of qualitative research. The researchers checked the quality of the obtained information. After the research was completed, an analysis and a review were concluded. The research team provided an opportunity for the group of informants to participate in the research during the review of the data and the analysis of the findings. The collaborative review was conducted between the researchers and key informants using the triangulation technique to confirm the validity of the data (dependability). In addition, the researcher was aware of the verification of the data (conformability) [29]; so that the informants would review the data after the data collection was completed.\n\nThe researchers’ process uses a triangulation technique [28]. The researchers used multiple methods of data collection such as observations, in-depth interviews, field recordings, etc., and the researcher confirmed the correctness of the data with member checking by bringing the data obtained from the interview to check the data with the informant to verify the correctness with all informants [29]. If any doubtful issues are found, the researcher will ask additional questions for the same understanding. The interpreted data will be consulted with a peer debriefing to obtain the correct guidelines and information in conducting research, and in the presentation of the research results, the words of the informants will be used to confirm the truth and clarity in all aspects of the analysis and reporting of the research results.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nOlder adults have perceptions of a good death as a painless and non-agonizing death. When it is near departure time, there is no distress and it takes a short time before dying. Based on the results of the study, the older people provided the meaning of a good death in terms of receiving care without suffering from illnesses or any discomfort. The suffering from ailments, chronic diseases, and/or incurable diseases among older people at the end of their life is a reflection of the torture in terms of both physical and mental. Those symptoms disturb their lives and cause various discomforts, including suffering, worries and the thought of not needing to be a burden to their offspring. They also suffer from the very painful condition of diseases. At this stage, the dying patients often think that if their lives may be prolonged through medical technology, for example, they would be a burden to their families [19], causing the patients to become depressed and cannot leave peacefully. Besides, the patients, caregivers, their families, and nurses who are taking care of them wish that the dying patient could die peacefully, without prolonging their lives [13]. It is also the desire of dying persons in many cultures to peacefully pass away [30], which is as well as the goal of the end-stage among patient care [20]. Therefore, the results of this study reinforce the perceptions among older adults towards good death that in case of illness before death patients should not require unnecessary treatment or prolonged death. Dying persons should be in the state without suffering and not being treated as an object, or as the condition that not being able to help themselves.\n\nThe natural death of older adults can be explained by the beliefs of Thai people who are influenced by Buddhism. It is believed that a good death is a natural death, a peaceful death, a lifelong death, or old age. But if it’s a bad death or a fatal death, it’s an untimely death that may be caused by murder, suicide, or death from an accident. By these deaths before death, there will be suffering, especially the suffering of bodily pain [31]. From the study, the older adults have perceptions of a good death as death by life expectancy since the body has been naturally deteriorated. This can be explained that due to the aging of the older adults, preparation for death idea is becoming more pronounced; older adults think of death more often. Elderly people who perceive the condition of actual health will be aware of planning to prepare for death. Preparing for death occurs with patients who are aware of their dying process and how long they will live [32].The findings are consistent with several other studies [32,33] which could explain how well-prepared for death is understood by the patient and caregiver.\n\nPeople who are dependent and have faith in religions will believe that religions can influence anxiety, concerns, and attitudes about death and near death [34]. Moreover, the patients who have a bond with God and believe in the next life will feel satisfied with dying with honor, resulting in acceptance of the coming death. They have hope and peace and are more likely to be well prepared to die. The strictly religious person is a statistically significant predictor of their own pre-mortality needs [35]. Therefore, in this research, it is believed that older adults with religious beliefs about death are likely to be more prepared to face death and near-death conditions than ones who have less religious beliefs concerning death.\n\nIn addition, in terms of managing family and property before death, older people have to communicate directly to those around them to let them know the final will. When communication is clear, the family and relatives will know what and how to fulfill the wishes of the departing person. Because when entering the last stage of life, older adults will encounter pain or disturbances from near-death conditions [36]. Therefore, for the elderly to die, they elderly may think of not only themselves but also those around them, especially loved ones, and do not want themselves to be a burden to those who are still alive. Which concerns or having unsettled things will prevent the patient from leaving peacefully. Moreover, if the older patients die among their loved ones and at their beloved place, do not let them die alone at home and/or at the hospital [19]. This mortality caused the patient’s peaceful departure with the feeling of warmth and companionship [37]. Due to the importance of being the care of the family for people, this shows the interaction between family members. From the research evidence [38], it was found that the family is a source to support the members in terms of emotions, love, encouragement, value giving, information possession, and money. So, the family is an important context for a dying person. When changes occur in a family, whether positively or negatively, there will be impacts on family members. This concept reflects that families have important responsibilities, roles, and mechanisms in caring for family members both in normal conditions, during health deviations, and at the end stage of their lives [38].\n\nThe perspectives of patients about the need to always be with their families at all times by the end of their lives, especially before dying, even when they are already unconscious could help them to die peacefully; especially when someone they love only sits beside them make them feel warm and not alone [19]. It also corresponds to having enough time with the family, expressing feelings to family members, and believing that the family will take care of their body afterward. The death in which the family is ready and supportive of their death is one of the attributes of good mortality of a dying person [39]. Consistent with studies of terminally ill patients in America and Europe [40], the characteristics of a good death were control of pain and other symptoms, clear decision-making, feeling of not being alone accepted as a person prepare to die, and helping others. It can be seen that the perception of death is good in both Thai contexts, and Western contexts have both things in common, namely no physical suffering, and the different part is being in the midst of a family. In which the Thai context and Asian countries place a greater emphasis on family than in Western societies that emphasize recognition as a person with self-determination [40].\n\nA good death is related to the perceptions, beliefs, religion, culture, and experience of Thai society; in which the patients in the final stage of life desire to die at home in a familiar atmosphere, among family members, relatives, and loved ones [41,42]. In Thai culture, taking care of the parents is the duty of the offspring to express their gratitude to elders [43]. As it can be seen from the findings, informants who provided qualitative information are a child, a daughter-in-law, and/or a partner who acts as a caregiver for terminally ill older adult patients. The context of Thailand especially in rural societies often shows that people have a close relationship with each other, pay respect to older adults, and take good care of older people when they are sick. Although the study area is a large provincial area with the natural context of a semi-urban community, people still have close relationships with older adults.\n\nIn addition, Thai culture, Buddhism religion, social community, and family have contributed to making people view a good death as a part of nature. Generally, when someone in the community is sick, neighbors, relatives, and family members often come to visit and have a small talk with the sick. The offspring and related family members often take turns to provide care for the sick [44]. Therefore, most of the deaths occurred at home in the surrounding of familiar people and the atmosphere would help the dying person to leave peacefully. Moreover, understanding the life circle (Birth, Aging, Sickness, and Death) enables the dying person to cope with death and support the family members to let go of the dying person easier. The community also helps support the family of the death through performing religious rituals that are consistent with the beliefs and traditions of Thai people.\n\nThe people’ perceptions toward a good death reflect the social and cultural aspects of the local community that view a good death as a meaningful and valuable moment of life; as well as reflect the social relationship among family members, neighbors, relatives, and health personnel through the care, the home visit, and religious rituals within the community. If health providers, nurses or everyone involved in caring for terminally ill patients lack knowledge in care in the dimension of cultural and social value, it will cause disrespect to patients’ dignity, and not allow the patients to enter a peaceful death. Therefore, gaining a better understanding of a good death in-depth in terms of social and culture is very important in nursing practice to participate in palliative care for older adult patient."
