        "text": "Rambhai Barni Golf Course is located within Rambhai Barni Rajabhat University, about 7 kilometres from Chanthaburi city. The course is built on 200 acres of lush natural mountain greenery. The main campus was formerly Suan Ban Kaew Palace, the personal residence of Her Majesty Queen Rambhai Barni, the Queen of King Prajadhipok or King Rama VII. Rambhai Barni Golf Course is one of the best 9 hole courses in Thailand with very good greens.\n\nThe Queenâ€™s old golf course has been developed into one of the best in the east. The natural forest on campus has been conserved for wildlife and plant genetic conservation studies so there are plenty of trees around. Moreover, orchards on campus offer peace and tranquility."
