        "text": "BANGKOK, Thailand -- The late Queen Rambhai Barni - granddaughter of the king of Siam portrayed in the musical, 'The King and I' -- was cremated Tuesday in a spectacular $1 million royal funeral ceremony complete with booming cannons and chanting monks.\n\nQueen Rambhai was the granddaughter of King Mongkut, Rama IV, who died in 1868 and whose life was portrayed in the famed Broadway musical and a later movie, both starring actor Yul Brynner. She was also Thailand's last link to the days of absolute monarchy.\n\nWith hundreds of thousands of Thai citizens looking on, the queen's remains were brought 2 miles to the cremation grounds on an ancient 40-ton funeral carriage slowly pulled by 400 men.\n\nCannons boomed every minute along the procession route. While the route itself was short, many in the crowd who had waited hours for the event fainted in the sweltering 97-degree heat.\n\nQueen Rambhai died of a heart attack May 22, 1984, at the age of 79. The cremation was delayed for nearly a year to prepare for the ceremony.\n\nThe tradition-rich rites began shortly after dawn and ended at sunset with the lighting of a sacred fire as bugles, drums and conches sounded and an honor guard played Last Post.\n\nScores of Buddhist monks chanted and read ancient scriptures as King and Queen Sirikit presided over the religious ceremony and the royal pyre was lit.\n\nThe funeral procession lasted five hours and included five battalions of soldiers in scarlet tunics, hundreds of government officials in white dress uniforms and royal pages clad in ancient costumes.\n\nThe gilded 59-foot-high funeral carriage, the 'Royal Great Victory Chariot,' is regarded as one of Thailand's most beautiful works of art and normally is housed in the National Museum.\n\nRenovation of the funeral carriage, construction of 95-foot high wooden crematorium and other preparations for the royal ceremony -- the first one ince 1954 -- cost $1 million.\n\nQueen Rambhai was the wife of King Rama VII, who died in self-imposed exile in England in 1941. She was the aunt of King Bhumibol, also known as King Rama IX, and a granddaughter of King Mongkut, Rama IV.\n\nThe late queen's husband was on the throne in 1932 when a coup changed the nation, then known as Siam, from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional democracy.\n\nThe king accepted the takeover to avoid bloodshed, but two years later left the country for self-imposed exile in England, where he abdicated the throne in 1935.\n\nQueen Rambhai remained in England until 1949, when she returned to Thailand with her husband's ashes. She was known for her many charitable works, her good humor and her love for the game of golf."
