        "text": "Queen Sirikit’s Diamond Fringe Tiara\n\nQueen Sirikit’s Diamond Fringe Tiara (Photo: Wikimedia Commons)\n\nAs Thailand continues to mourn the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, images of the monarch and his consort are prevelant throuhgout the country and other parts of the world. Many of these portraits feature an important jewel from the Thai royal vaults: the family’s diamond fringe.\n\nI love when royals are inventive with their jewels, and Queen Sirikit’s use of her gorgeous diamond fringe tiara definitely fits that bill. The tiara is designed in a traditional Russian style; most royal families have at least one of these tiaras, which are meant to resemble the kokoshnik headdresses worn by women in Russia. Over the years, the queen has worn the fringe both in that kokoshnik-esque halo form, stretching around her head, and bunched tightly atop her head like a crown, a traditional Thai way of wearing a diadem.\n\nPhoto: Wikimedia Commons\n\nAlthough, like many other Asian royal families, the Thai royals only began wearing Western-style tiaras relatively recently, the family today has an extensive and impressive collection of jewels. This particular tiara is reportedly one of the most important pieces in the vaults, having apparently been owned by Queen Saovabha Bongsri, who became the first female regent of the country in 1897. Indeed, many of the portraits of Queen Sirikit depict her wearing this tiara, underscoring its significance.\n\nQueen Rambhai Barni wears the tiara\n\nSirikit isn’t the only Thai royal lady who has worn the tiara. Queen Saovabha Bongsri’s daughter-in-law, Queen Rambhai Barni, wore the tiara in the 1920s. Above, you can see her wearing it à la Josephine — across the forehead in the trendy bandeau style of the time. Princess Bejaratana, the only daughter of King Vajiravudh, also wore the tiara.\n\nPhoto: STF/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLike many diamond fringes, the tiara can also be worn as a necklace. Above, Sirikit wears it in necklace form with a traditional Thai tiara at the opera in Paris in 1960.\n\nSirikit wore the diamond fringe at gala events throughout her late husband’s reign. Unfortunately, Sirikit’s health has declined in recent years; she suffered a stroke in 2012, and she rarely makes public appearances. But images of her wearing the tiara are prevalent in the country, and it has become a familiar symbol of her royal position.\n\nNote: This is an updated version of an earlier post, with new text and images.\n\nRoyal Jewel Rewind: King of Thailand’s Diamond Jubilee, Part 2\n\nThe Sultan of Brunei, the King of Thailand, and the King of Sweden at the reception (Photo: Pool/Getty Images)\n\nYesterday, we marveled at the jewels worn during the first evening reception celebrating the Diamond Jubilee of the late King of Thailand in 2006. Today, here’s a look at the second reception, held at the Royal Palace, tiaras and all!\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nQueen Sirikit of Thailand glittered in diamonds from the top of her head to the tips of her fingers at the reception. The tiara is convertible and can also be worn as a necklace. She wears the sash and star of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri. King Bhumibol Adulyadej also wears the sash, star, and collar of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri, along with numerous other decorations.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nHere’s a look at the back of Queen Sirikit’s tiara, visible as she and her husband greet King Abdullah II of Jordan. Because Abdullah does not have a Thai order, he wears the sash of his highest Jordanian order, the Order of al-Hussein bin Ali.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nPrincess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, who is the equivalent of a princess royal in Thailand, does not wear tiaras, but she managed to sparkle quite effectively anyway. She wears the collar and sash of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri. Over the top of the yellow order sash, she has layered an ornamental chain — I think this is the “chaing” that forms a part of traditional Thai costume. (Please correct me if I’m wrong about that.) Also: that “brooch” on her shoulder is the star of the Order of the Nine Gems.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe Sultan of Brunei attended the reception, wearing the Order of the Rajamitrabhorn. His wife, Queen Saleha, wore major, major diamonds, including a tall tiara. Like many royal consorts (and other royals who weren’t heads of state at the time), she also wore the Order of Chula Chom Klao.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nQueen Saleha’s tiara is also visible in the photo above; she’s speaking with the woman who was Queen of Malaysia in 2006: Tuanku Fauziah, wife of Sirajuddin of Perlis. She’s wearing major diamonds, plus Malaysia’s Order of the Crown of the Realm. In the foreground is Queen Nothando, one of the wives of King Mswati III of Swaziland. She’s wearing the Royal Household Order of Swaziland.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nKing Mswati wore the Military Order of Swaziland. On his right, King Letsie III of Lesotho wears the Order of Moshoeshoe.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe Duke of York wore the sash of the Order of the Garter. He’s also wearing the stars of the Order of the Garter and the Royal Victorian Order, plus the badge of the RVO around his neck. Also, interestingly, if you look at the right-hand side of his row of medals, you’ll find the small ribbon and badge of one of his only foreign orders: the Norwegian Order of St. Olav.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nAlso wearing the Order of St. Olav: Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway. Mette-Marit wore the tiara and earrings from the family’s amethyst parure; on her left hand, she’s also wearing a ring with a large blue stone.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Brabant (now King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of the Belgians) also lack a Thai order, so they wore the Order of Leopold. Mathilde sparkled in her laurel wreath tiara, plus diamonds at her ears and on her wrist. Behind them, Prince Henrik of Denmark wears the Order of Chula Chom Klao.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe Prince of Orange (now King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands) also wore the Order of Chula Chom Klao. Princess (now Queen) Maxima wore the family’s enormous diamond bandeau with one of the Dutch East Indies Bracelets. She wore her highest Dutch order, the Order of the Netherlands Lion.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nGrand Duke Henri of Luxembourg wore his highest Luxembourgish order, the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau.\n\nAdd caption\n\nHereditary Prince Alois of Liechtenstein wore the sash and star of the Order of Merit of the Principality of Liechtenstein. He’s walking here with Sayyid Shihab bin Tariq Taimur Al Said, nephew of the Sultan of Oman, and Crown Prince (now King) Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck of Bhutan.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nKing Norodom Sihamoni of Cambodia wore the Royal Order of Cambodia.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nEmperor Akihito of Japan wore the sash, collar, and star of the Order of the Rajamitrabhorn, plus the star of the Order of the Chrysanthemum. Empress Michiko wore the sash and collar of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri with the Japanese Honeysuckle Tiara (the same tiara she wore for the previous reception).\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nPrince Albert II of Monaco attended, but camera angles don’t clearly show which (if any) decorations he wore.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nSheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, then the Emir of Qatar, attended with his wife, Sheikha Mozah. She wore a glittering diamond ring on her right hand.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nQueen Silvia of Sweden wore the tiara, earrings, and necklace from the Napoleonic Amethyst Parure for the reception, along with the sash and star of the Order of Chula Chom Klao, the star of the Order of the Seraphim, and her husband’s family order. King Carl XVI Gustaf wore the sash, star, and collar of the Order of the Rajamitrabhorn, plus the star of the Order of the Seraphim and the necklet and badge of the Order of the Sword.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Getty Images\n\nQueen Sofia of Spain nearly stole the entire show, wearing La Buena and the diamond earrings from the joyas de pasar collection. She’s also wearing the sash and collar of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri."
