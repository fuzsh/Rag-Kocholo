        "text": "Thus far, Murata has endeavored to build relationships of mutual trust with local residents while gaining their understanding of our business and initiatives. This is an intangible but important asset, and we are thankful that we have been able to continue doing business.\n\nMurata produces a wide range of electronic components used all over the world, under the slogan, \"Innovator in Electronics.\" At each of our business locations, we are engaged in activities with the goal to resolve local issues for the following 5 priority areas by applying available resources such as our manufacturing philosophy and technical capabilities we have developed over our many years of business, employee capabilities, as well as cooperations with local communities. When hiring employees, we strive to consider the impact of our business sites on local communities both domestically and overseas while actively hiring local people to vitalize local communities and create employment as well as to secure human resources and maintain steady operations at each of our business locations.\n\nThrough coexistence and co‐prosperity with local communities, Murata generates a continuous cycle of social value and economic value through innovation, and contributes to achieving a rich society.\n\nLink: Respect for Human Rights\n\nMurata's Basic Policy of Contribution Activities for Society and Community\n\nThe message to all company employees shared by our company founder in 1959, put up at one of our plants (former Ozowara Plant, now Fukui Murata Manufacturing)\n\nMurata hopes to continue to be \"a company whose presence in local communities is a source of pride and joy to those communities as well as a company that our employees are proud and happy to work for.\" Through dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders, including local residents, we will actively engage in ongoing social and community contribution activities to achieve our common goals of realizing a sustainable society and developing local communities.\n\nMurata is deeply concerned with social issues, and we will use our unique strengths in activities that contribute to society.\n\nWe will fulfill our roles and responsibilities in accordance with the needs and characteristics of each region based on our activities in the region where we operate.\n\nEmphasizing the participation of employees, we encourage and support each employee to actively engage in contact with society and the local community.\n\n* This policy is subject to periodic supervision by the Board of Directors.\n\nSupport for the development of the next generation\n\nMurata produces a wide range of electronic components used all over the world, under the slogan, \"Innovator in Electronics.\" We apply our manufacturing philosophy and the scientific technologies we have developed over our many years of business, in supporting the development of the next generation through engaging in STEAM education efforts such as science lectures and electronics workshops.\n\nExample: School visits based on local needs\n\nIn order to communicate the kinds of work performed by the engineers who support our manufacturing and the interesting aspects of such work as a manufacturing company, we host science lectures and visiting classes for elementary and middle school students at domestic and overseas business sites. We continue to conduct school visits according to local needs, such as the \"Control the Teacher Robot!!\" school visit that allows students to experience programming, electronics workshops, environmental courses to raise interest in environmental preservation, and career education.\n\nExample: \"Mulabo!\" interactive science facility for children\n\nOn December 16, 2020, the \"Mulabo!\" interactive science facility for children opened in the Minato MIRAI Innovation Center. Established to contribute to STEAM education and cultural development, it features four entertaining zones built around the concept of \"places where fledgling engineers are born\" and is designed to appeal to people of all ages and can be enjoyed through repeated visits. Entry is free of charge. See here for more details.\n\nLocal community support\n\nMurata hopes to continue to follow our founder's wishes and operate as \"a company whose presence in local communities is a source of pride and joy to those communities as well as a company that our employees are proud and happy to work for.\" We continue to engage in activities to help build trust relationships with local communities and to help develop a sustainable society.\n\nExample: Employees gathering goods to donate to institutions and individuals in need\n\nOur domestic and overseas business sites perform various types of charity work, including donations to senior care facilities and Foster Home, and food and toy drives. Food and toy drives are charity events where employees gather food and toys to distribute to institutions and individuals in need.\n\nExample: Supporting local multiculturalism\n\nWe support local multiculturalism by donating equipment and dispatching interpreters to elementary and middle schools with many Brazilian children of Japanese ancestry through Izumo Murata Manufacturing and Fukui Murata Manufacturing.\n\nCultural support (sports, arts, and traditional culture industries)\n\nArt and culture make life interesting, by moving people and bringing joy. Sports culture helps to keep people healthy in both mind and body. Traditional industries are valued and handed down from generation to generation, and can form a foundation for local communities. Murata works to help vitalize local communities through providing cultural support, under the understanding that culture is an important factor contributing to social development.\n\nExample: Vitalizing local communities through sports\n\nWe sponsor professional sports teams both domestically and overseas, and volunteer at local sports tournaments, with the goal of vitalizing local communities through sports.\n\nExample: Support for Tensai* Art KYOTO\n\nMurata recognizes and supports the initiatives of Tensai Art KYOTO (Specified Nonprofit Corporation Art Promotion Research Institute for Persons with Disabilities) that supports artistic activities performed by persons with disabilities. An original art piece was created for us on May 2023. Additionally, as a form of continuous support, we have rented the original work, and exhibited it in our headquarters lobby. (Go here for details on Tensai Art KYOTO)\n\n* Tensai means God-given Talent in Japan.\n\nAcademic support\n\nSince its founding, Murata has developed technology with the support of many academic researchers in various areas. In addition to contributing to the improvement and development of academics by providing support through the Murata Science and Education Foundation, we support students studying at universities in various countries and regions.\n\nExample: Academic research support for students and researchers\n\nThe Murata Science Foundation was established in 1985 to contribute to the development of science and technology. We offer grants for research projects that improve or advance science and technology, or that help resolve issues in the humanities and social sciences fields. Renamed to Murata Science and Education Foundation in 2023 and started providing grants for schools and faculty in order to promote STEAM education and production education from fiscal 2024. See here for data regarding amount of grants and number of cases. Our domestic and overseas business sites also support research projects at universities and offer scholarships to students.\n\nExample: Providing students with \"opportunities to learn\"\n\nMurata makes use of company facilities, etc. to provide students with \"opportunities to learn.\" Students studying to become nutritionists have had fewer opportunities for practical training at external facilities in recent years, due to COVID-19. In response to this situation, Sendai Murata Manufacturing and Kanazawa Murata Manufacturing offered their employee cafeterias to be used by students to practice preparing healthy meals."
