        "text": "[Nikkei Stock Average and TOPIX (Table)]\n\nNikkei average; 38411.68; -114.27.\n\nTOPIX; 2755.28; +0.83.\n\nSummary of the start of the afternoon session\n\nIn the afternoon session, the Nikkei average started with a slightly smaller decline from the morning session, starting at 38411.68 yen, down 114.27 yen from the previous day's close of 38369.54 yen. During the lunchtime, the Nikkei 225 futures were in a strong trend within the range of 38340 yen to 38480 yen. The dollar-yen was trading at the same level as around 9 a.m., at 152.70-80 yen. In Asia, after the Shanghai Composite Index started slowly, it turned upward and rose about 1.4%. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong rose significantly by about 1.8% in the positive territory.\n\nIn the afternoon session of the Tokyo market, buying was slightly ahead of the morning session. At the beginning of the afternoon session, the results of the Bank of Japan's monetary policy decision meeting have not yet been announced. The fact that the downside of the Dow Jones futures, which was cheaper in the morning, is strong, and the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index is rising, is likely to be supporting the stock prices of the Tokyo market. However, some investors seem to be holding back from actively buying and want to see the results of the Bank of Japan's monetary policy decision meeting, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's press conference, the release of the Federal Open Market Committee's results at an early morning Japan time tomorrow, and the press conference by Federal Reserve Chairman Powell.\n\nIn sectors, air transportation, transportation equipment, and services are among the top decliners, while banks, marine transportation, and securities commodities futures are among the top gainers."
