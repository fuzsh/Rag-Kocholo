        "text": "Xendee, developer of software for operation of distributed energy systems and EV charging infrastructure, has announced that multiple completed calibration projects related to its new OPERATE adaptive model predictive controller software have achieved operational cost savings of up to 79.4% over existing hardware and rule-based microgrid controllers.\n\nThe projects included an installation at the University of California San Diego involving batteries and another in the Midwest involving generators, PV and batteries.\n\nOPERATE employs the same background methodologies as Xendee’s DESIGN product. It makes use of machine learning and artificial intelligence-enabled forecasting to adaptively control and monitor distributed energy resources or microgrids based on such dynamic factors as weather and loads.\n\n“With more players entering the microgrid market, the need for efficiency and accuracy in every stage of the project development process is increasingly important,” said Michael Stadler, co-founder, CTO and CMO of Xendee. “And an integrated approach to the different project stages is also crucial to achieve the optimal cost savings.”"
