I should explain that this is a mixed wired/wireless LAN. There is no security on the wireless part, but as our house is way out in the country with no other regularly inhabited house within 300m, I've always taken a relaxed view of the likelihood of somebody using my wireless connection. Normally there are 2-3 Windows PCs + 2 Linux servers on the wired LAN, plus 1-2 laptops and an iPhone, plus a Netgear router/modem, plus a simple (non-smart) switch. All of these show as expected in the nmap scan.\n\nAny ideas as to what this alien device could be?\n\n00-13-E0 (hex) Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.\n\n0013E0 (base 16) Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.\n\n2288, Oshinohara,\n\nYasu-shi Shiga 520-2393\n\nJAPAN\n\nFrom here:\n\nhttp://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/index.shtml\n\nAND SECURE YOUR WIRELESS!!!\n\nThere is no security on the wireless part, but as our house is way out in the country with no other regularly inhabited house within 300m, I've always taken a relaxed view of the likelihood of somebody using my wireless connection.\n\nHam radio geeks have achieved 2.4ghz and 5ghz WiFi connections over hundreds of miles with dish antennas and FCC-legal power output. A buddy of mine has a modest 12dbi gain antenna and he's picking up open WAPs from all over his town."
