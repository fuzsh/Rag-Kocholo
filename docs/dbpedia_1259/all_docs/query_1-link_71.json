        "text": "Electronic components distributors Rutronik, headquartered in Germany, and Su’scon, headquartered in Taiwan, have signed a worldwide distribution agreement that will offer Rutronik customers a broader selection of globally available capacitors.\n\nSu’scon specializes in R&D and manufacturing of aluminum electrolytic capacitors, polymer solid capacitors and hybrid polymer capacitors. Su’scon’s in-house developed electrolytic capacitors focus on ultra-low and high temperature and long life and extremely low erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).\n\nThe company’s UR Series of radial-type aluminum electrolytic capacitors is designed for automotive applications. It is suitable for thermal management systems, compliant with the AEC-Q200 standard and rated for a maximum operating temperature of 135° C. The SVB series of SMD-type conductive polymer hybrid capacitors has a maximum rated operating temperature of 125° C and is suited for such applications as onboard chargers, battery management systems and motor microcontrollers.\n\n“We have a great product, and Rutronik has a strong global sales and marketing team and a long history in the automotive and industrial sectors,” said Edward Hsueh, Vice President of Sales & Marketing at Su’scon."
