I can ping it, and Spiceworks states the manufacturer is Murata Manufacturing. Device type is unknown, I have a MAC address and a serial number. Nothing else. No remote desktop. Any suggestion on what I can do to track this asset down?\n\nWe do use a fair amount of lab equipment that is connected to the network with static IP, but we haven’t had new equipment in quite a while. SW says it was last updated on Nov 13, so 4 days ago at the time I’m writing this.\n\nthanks!\n\nMaruta manufactures wireless cards for IOT devices. Your best bet is to trace it back to a switch port, by mating up the MAC address with what switch it is on. From there you can trace it back through the panel or unplug it and see who complains.\n\nWell, According to SoftPerfect Network Scanner, it’s an Android device. I’m gonna guess it’s someone’s cell phone. Sorry for the interruption, let’s carry on.\n\nthanks for the response tho, that’s a good idea for future reference, and I’ve made note of it."
