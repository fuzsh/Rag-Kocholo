        "text": "EEE Components, PASSIVES\n\nMurata Extends Chip Common Mode Choke Coil Lineup with CAN FD Compatibility\n\nPosted by doEEEt Media Group\n\nOn May 24, 2023\n\n0\n\nMurata has expanded the lineup of CAN FD-compatible chip common mode choke coils to include new 51µH products with existing 100µH products. This product is effective in reducing noise from CAN or CAN-FD signal lines in in-vehicle networks and satisfies DCMR Class 3 requirements for common mode choke coils used in CAN FD networks as specified in IEC62228-3*5\n\nEEE Components, PASSIVES\n\nIndustry First: Murata Squeezes 10uF into 0201 MLCC Capacitor\n\nPosted by doEEEt Media Group\n\nOn May 24, 2023\n\n0\n\nThe GRM series benefits from key Murata innovations, including the company’s proprietary thin layer forming technology, plus a fully optimized high-precision lamination process. The 4.0VDC-rated GRM035R60G106M products have a -55°C to 85°C temperature range and are already in production. Also, the GRM035C80E106M with a rated voltage of 2.5VDC at -55°C to 105°C goes into mass production this September, and the GRM035R60J106M with a rated voltage of 6.3VDC at -55°C to 85°C in 2024.\n\nEEE Components, PASSIVES\n\nChip Ferrite Beads with Highest Ever Current Capabilities\n\nPosted by doEEEt Media Group\n\nOn December 13, 2022\n\n0\n\nThese are the world’s first chip-type noise suppression components to have 20A current rating. They will be used to provide noise suppression in circuits with large current flows, such as the battery charging systems and powertrains of electric vehicles (EVs), as well as in industrial equipment.\n\nRF & MW\n\nWhat is RFID? (radio frequency identification)\n\nPosted by doEEEt Media Group\n\nOn August 9, 2022\n\n0\n\nRFID (radio frequency identification) is automatic recognition technology that uses wireless communication. Generally, a system or a part that uses an IC tag to identify or control various items via wireless communication is called RFID. Here, a description is given mainly of the features of RFID and the principle of wireless communication to provide basic knowledge concerning RFID.\n\nACTIVES, EEE Components\n\nRelease 1812 Broadband Inductors\n\nPosted by doEEEt Media Group\n\nOn October 1, 2021\n\n0\n\nMurata Manufacturing Co., Ltd. has commercialized the broadband inductor for Bias-T circuits for use with vehicle-mounted PoC*1 LQW43FT_0H Series. This product makes use of Murata’s original ceramic materials and coil structures to provide performance at an inductance of 22 μH and a rated current of 700 mA at 1812 inch size.\n\nEEE Components, PASSIVES\n\nMurata Introduces Ultra-Compact and Highly Responsive PTC Thermistor\n\nPosted by doEEEt Media Group\n\nOn August 12, 2021\n\n0\n\nThe new thermistors directly benefit from Murata’s proprietary ceramic technology, with innovations realized about the raw material composition and sintering procedure. The result is that a significant downsizing can be achieved without any compromise in performance. Furthermore, the thermistors have strong operational stability and do not generate any noise which would otherwise affect neighboring components.\n\nEEE Components, PASSIVES\n\nMurata Releases AEC-Q200\n\nPosted by doEEEt Media Group\n\nOn August 12, 2021\n\n0\n\nThe LQW21FT_0H series is compliant with AEC-Q200 and delivers a combination of both broadband impedance and high-current performance. Thanks to state-of-the-art ceramic material and coil structure technologies, Murata can supply these components in a space-saving size format that other manufacturers cannot match. They are housed in compact 0805-inch case size, with 2mm × 1.2mm × 1.6mm dimensions.\n\nIssue 42 of EUROPEAN PREFERRED PARTS LIST (EPPL)\n\nPosted by Emilio Cano García\n\nOn August 10, 2021\n\n0\n\nThe changes in issue 42 of EUROPEAN PREFERRED PARTS LISTS (EPPL) are included in the DCR 1438 and detailed in this post\n\nACTIVES, EEE Components\n\nLatest Circuit Protection Devices Overview\n\nPosted by doEEEt Media Group\n\nOn July 17, 2021\n\n0\n\nCircuit protection devices are the safeguard electronic circuits that protect from overvoltage, overcurrent, overtemperature, and ESD. The article provides an overview of the most common circuit protection devices and the latest released products in this field.\n\nEEE Components, PASSIVES\n\nMurata Begins Mass Production of the World’s Smallest and World’s Highest Capacitance Three-terminal Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors\n\nPosted by doEEEt Media Group\n\nOn May 26, 2021\n\n0\n\nMurata Manufacturing Co., Ltd. has started mass production of two new multilayer ceramic capacitors for automotive applications—the NFM15HC105D0G3, which is the world’s smallest*1 0402 inch size(1.0×0.5mm) three-terminal low-ESL multilayer ceramic capacitor, and the NFM18HC106D0G3, which is the three-terminal low-ESL multilayer ceramic capacitor with the world’s highest capacitance of 10µF in 0603-inch size(1.6×0.8mm)."
