It is therefore necessary to avoid an increase in the weight of the alignment/feed apparatus.\n\nthe chip case should be thin and relatively small.\n\nthe present invention provides an apparatus for automatically replenishing chips, comprising an alignment/feed mechanism wherein a container space within which a plurality of chips are contained, and an outlet port from which the chips are fed one by one in an aligned manner, characterized by a sensor for detecting whether the number of chips within the container space is reduced below a reference level, a chip tank located above the alignment/feed mechanism and designed to contain more chips than the container space, a replenishment line through which the chips are fed from the chip tank to the container space, and on-off means disposed in the replenishment line for opening the replenishment line in response to the sensor and closing the replenishment line when a predetermined number of additional chips are fed to the container space.\n\nthe chip tank preferably contains a sufficient number of chips, for example more than 1,000,000 chips, so that it is not necessary to replenish the chips for about one month.\n\nthe container space has an inlet port at its rear end to receive chips to be replenished.\n\nthe replenishment line includes a pipe which is capable of vertical expansion and contraction and allows the chips to pass therethrough. It is also preferable to provide means for horizontally moving at least either the chip tank or the alignment/feed mechanism so as to bring one of them into vertical alignment with the other, and means for vertically moving the lower end of the pipe so as to insert the lower end of the pipe into the inlet port.\n\nthe replenishment line includes a flexible tube through which the chips can pass.\n\nthe alignment/feed mechanism intends to align chips within the container space and discharge the chips one by one from the outlet port.\n\nthe sensor is operable to detect whether the number of the chips within the container space is reduced below a reference level. If below this level, the on-off means is opened to allow the chips within the chip tank to be fed through the replenishment line into the container space due to its tare weight. The on-off means is closed when the chips are fed above a predetermined level. As this occurs, the chips are no longer fed into the container space so as to prevent the container space from being overfilled with additional chips.\n\nthe chip mounting machine needs not be stopped if chips can be fed during operation of the chip mounting machine. This would improve operating efficiency.\n\nthe replenishment of chips may be carried out while a printed circuit board is being loaded onto the chip mounting machine (for four to six seconds).\n\nthe present invention enables replenishment of chips for a short period of time since the replenishment line is used to replenish the container space with chips. No replacement of chip cases takes place.\n\nFIG. 1 is an overall view of an automatic replenishing machine according to one embodiment of the present invention\n\nFIG. 2 is a sectional view taken on the line A--A in FIG. 1;\n\nFIG. 3 is a perspective view of a bulk feeder\n\nFIG. 4 is a sectional view of a bulk cassette and a chip case\n\nFIG. 5 is a partial view of the bulk cassette and the chip case as seen in the direction of the arrow B in FIG. 4;\n\nFIG. 6 is a perspective view of a closure member\n\nFIG. 7 is a flow chart showing operation of the automatic replenishing apparatus of the present invention.\n\nFIG. 8 is an overall view of an automatic replenishing apparatus according to a second embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFIG. 9 is a right side view of the automatic replenishing apparatus shown in FIG. 8.\n\nFIGS. 1 and 2 illustrates a first embodiment showing the manner in which the present invention may be applied to a chip mounting machine.\n\nthe reference numeral 1 denotes a one-by-one type chip mounting machine.\n\n2 is a bulk feeder serving as an alignment/feed apparatus.\n\n3 is a reel shaft table horizontally movable relative to the chip mounting machine 1.\n\na plurality of bulk feeders 2 are placed on the upper surface of the reel shaft table (e.g., an X-Y table) 3 and arranged in parallel in the thickness direction of the reel shaft table 3.\n\nFIG. 1 four bulk feeders 2 are mounted to the chip mounting machine 1.\n\nthe number of the bulk feeders 2 may vary depending on the types of chips used.\n\neach of bulk feeder 2 includes various known components to which have been added a chip case 12, a chip presence sensor 45, and a sensor sensitivity adjuster 46, each of which will be described later.\n\nthe bulk feeder 2 includes a body 10, a bulk cassette 11 detachably mounted to the body 10, and a chip case 12 detachably connected to the bulk cassette 11.\n\nthe body 10 is associated with a triangular base 13 for supporting the bulk cassette 11 obliquely at an angle of approximately 45Â°, a vertically movable feed lever 14, a return spring 15 for urging the feed lever 14 in an upward direction, a mechanical valve 16 for selectively feeding air under pressure, an index pin push lever 17, an index table 18, an index wheel 19, and a rack-and-pinion mechanism 20.\n\nthe rack-and-pinion mechanism 20 is operated to rotate the index wheel 19 by a fixed angle (for example, approximately 90Â°).\n\nthe index wheel 19 has a plurality of recesses arranged in a circumferentially 90Â° spaced relationship and adapted to receive chips one at a time. After a chip is discharged from the outlet port of the bulk cassette 11, it is received in one of the recesses of the index wheel 19. The chip is then rotated by a predetermined angle and stopped at a predetermined position on the index table 18.\n\nthe index pin push lever 17 is also lowered when the feed lever 14 is pressed down.\n\nthe index pin push lever 17 is associated with a suitable mechanism, not shown, so as to allow a pin (not shown) to push the chip upwardly from the index table 18 during downward movement of the index pin push lever 17. The chip is then gripped by the chip mounting machine 1 and removed from the bulk feeder 2.\n\na clamp pawl 21 and a clamp lever 22 are attached to the rear end of the body 10.\n\nthe body 10 is secured to the reel shaft table 3 by the clamp pawl 21 which in turn, is operated by the clamp lever 22.\n\nthe bulk cassette 11 has an inlet port 30 at its rear end.\n\nthe chip case 12 is detachably mounted to the inlet port 30.\n\nthe bulk cassette 11 has a pair of grooves 32.\n\nthe chip case 12 has a corresponding pair of projections 40 which are slidably fit within the grooves 32 so as to securely mount the chip case 12 to the bulk cassette 11.\n\nthe inlet port 30 of the bulk cassette 11 corresponds to and communicates with an opening 41 of the chip case 12.\n\na number of chips are transferred from the chip case 12 to the bulk cassette 11.\n\nthe chips are first introduced into a large chamber 33, then enter a small chamber 34, and are finally moved into an alignment passage 35.\n\nTwo compressed air openings 36 are defined adjacent to the inlet end of the alignment passage 35. Compressed air is injected from these openings 36 when the mechanical valve 16 is opened.\n\nthe chips within the small chamber 34 are then urged into the alignment passage 35 one by one. Those chips which have previously been introduced into the alignment passage 35 are then pushed in a forward direction (rightwardly as viewed in FIG. 4).\n\nAn outlet port 37 is defined in the bulk cassette 11 adjacent to the front end of the alignment passage 35. The chips are discharged from the outlet port 37 one by one.\n\nthe internal structure of the bulk cassette 11 is similar to that disclosed in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. Hei 3-187298 and will not be described herein.\n\nthe chip case 12 is preferably transparent and made of resin.\n\nthe chip case 12 has openings 41, 42 at its front and rear ends, respectively.\n\nthe front opening 41 is closable by a slidable elongated plate 43.\n\nthe elongated plate 43 is in the form of a flexible thin plate and has a manually operable knob 44 at its rear end. With the chip case 12 mounted to the bulk cassette 11, the elongated plate 43 is slid in such a direction as to open the opening 41 so as to feed chips from the chip case 12 into the bulk cassette 11.\n\na chip presence sensor 45 (see FIG. 3) is attached to the chip case 12 adjacent to its opening 41. This sensor 45 is designed to detect whether the number of chips within the chip case 12 is below a predetermined level.\n\nthe sensor 45 is preferably of the reflection type, but may be of the transmission type or any other types (for example, contact sensor or mechanical switch).\n\na sensor sensitivity adjuster 46 is preferably mounted to the rear end of the bulk feeder body 10. The sensor 45 is connected to a controller 60 through the sensor sensitivity adjuster 46.\n\na closure plate 47 which can be moved inwardly, is mounted to the opening 47 at the rear end of the chip case 12. As shown in FIG. 6, the closure plate 47 is rotatable about a horizontal pin 48 and is urged under the action of a coil spring 49 so as to normally close the opening 42. The lower end of a replenishment piping 56 is inserted through the opening 42. At this time, the replenishment piping 56 pushes the closure plate 47 so as to open the opening 42. This enables a smooth supply of chips from the piping 56 to the chip case 12.\n\na top plate 50 is mounted above the reel shaft table 3.\n\na plurality of hanger posts 51 depend from the top plate 50.\n\na plurality of shelves 52 are secured to the hanger posts 51.\n\na single shaft drive mechanism 54 is mounted on one of the shelves 52 so as to drive or move a support table 53 in a horizontal direction. This drive mechanism 54 is operated under the control of the controller 60.\n\na plurality of chip tanks 55 are supported, in an inverted fashion, by the support table 53.\n\nthe chip tanks 55 contain different types of chips, for example on the order of 1,000,000 each. Four tanks 55 are shown in FIG. 1, but any number of tanks may be used.\n\nthe replenishment piping 56 is releasably connected to the open bottom of each of the chip tanks 55.\n\nAn on-off valve 57 is disposed between the piping 56 and the chip tank 55 and is operated under the control of the controller 60.\n\nthe replenishing piping 56 is composed of two pipes 56a, 56b which are slidable relative to each other.\n\nthe lower pipe 56a is vertically moved by an air cylinder 58.\n\nthe air cylinder 58 is mounted to a vertical wall 59 (see FIG. 2) which in turn, is fixed to the lower surface of the support table 53.\n\nthe air cylinder 58 is also operated under the control of the controller 60.\n\nthe air cylinder 58 is actuated, the pipe 56a is moved downwards.\n\nthe lower end of the pipe 56a is then inserted into the chip case 12.\n\nthe lower end of the pipe 56a is sharply pointed. This facilitates insertion of the pipe 56a into the chip case 12.\n\nthe piping 56 preferably has a circular cross section, but may have a rectangular cross section.\n\nthe piping 56 may take any other shapes as long as chips can smoothly be moved through the piping.\n\nthe controller 60 is operatively associated with the chip mounting machine 1 and controls the drive mechanism 54, the on-off valve 57 and the air cylinder 58.\n\nthe drive mechanism 54, the on-off valve 57, and the air cylinder 58 cooperate to automatically replenish the chip case with chips.\n\nthe controller 60 is also connected to a central processing unit (CPU) 4 so that the controller 60 and the chip mounting machine 1 are operatively associated with one another.\n\nthe CPU 4 not only controls the chip mounting machine 1, but also drives the reel shaft table 3 in synchronism with movement of the chip mounting machine 1.\n\nthe CPU 4 also sends instructional signals so as to actuate the feed lever 14 and the index pin push lever 17.\n\nthe chip mounting machine 1 When a printed circuit board is introduced or loaded onto the chip mounting machine 1, the chip mounting machine 1 is operable to mount chips, which are fed from the bulk feeder 2, to the printed circuit board one by one. When all of the chips have been mounted to the printed circuit board, the printed circuit board is transferred to the next station. Another printed circuit board is then loaded onto the chip mounting machine 1. During loading of a new printed circuit board, the chip mounting machine must be temporarily stopped for about four to six seconds.\n\nthe chip presence sensor 45 detects whether the number of the chips within the chip case 12 is below a predetermined level (step S1). The chip presence sensor 45 sends a corresponding signal to the controller 60. The controller 60 will then take all the necessary steps to replenish chips to be mounted to the next printed circuit board. Specifically, confirmation is made on the identification number of the empty chip case 12 (step S2). The support table 53 is then moved to locate a chip tank 55 with the same identification number as the empty chip case 12 above the bulk feeder 2 at a replenishment position (step S3).\n\nstep S4 While loading of the next printed circuit board takes place (step S4), the CPU 4 is operable to move the reel shaft table 3 to the replenishment position (step S5) so as to locate the bulk feeder 2 with the empty chip case 12 directly below the chip tank 55 with the same identification number as the empty chip case 12.\n\nthe leftmost bulk feeder 2 is vertically aligned with the leftmost chip tank 55.\n\nthe controller 60 lowers the air cylinder 58 (step S6).\n\nthe lower end of the replenishment pipe 56a is inserted into the opening 42 of the chip case 12.\n\nthe controller 60 opens the on-off valve 57 (step S7).\n\nchips drop from the chip tank 55 under the force of gravity pass through the piping 56, and then enter the chip case 12.\n\nthe controller 60 closes the on-off valve 57 (step S8).\n\nthe on-off valve 57 is kept opened until the chip case 12 is substantially filled with, but before it overflows with, the chips.\n\nthe controller 60 raises the air cylinder 58 (step S9) and the pipe 56a is removed from the chip case 12.\n\nthe CPU 4 returns the reel shaft table 3 to its home position (step S10).\n\nthe printed circuit board While replenishment of the chips is being carried out, the printed circuit board is simultaneously loaded onto the chip mounting machine. Loading of the printed circuit board is completed substantially at the same time as replenishment of the chips is completed. After the printed circuit board has been loaded, the chip mounting machine 1 is operable to again initiate mounting of the chips in a usual manner.\n\nthe support table 53 is moved in a horizontal direction so as to bring the chip tank 55 into vertical alignment with an empty bulk feeder 2.\n\nthe invention is not limited to the illustrated arrangement.\n\nthe reel shaft table 3 may be moveable and the support table 53 with the chip tanks 55 may be fixed or both elements can be moveable.\n\nFIGS. 8 and 9 show an automatic replenishing apparatus acceding to a second embodiment of the present invention.\n\na shelf 70 is suspended from the top wall 50 so as to support a plurality of chip tanks 55.\n\nthe chip tanks 55 are thus supported in a fixed position.\n\na flexible tube 71 is releasably connected to the open bottom or lower end of each of the chip tanks 55.\n\nthe on-off valve 57 is disposed between the tube 71 and the chip tank 55 and is operable under the control of the controller 60.\n\nthe tubes 71 are positioned so as not to interfere with the bulk feeder 2 during operation of the bulk feeder 2.\n\na horizontal shelf 72 is fixed below the shelf 70.\n\na X-Y robot 73 is mounted to the shelf 72.\n\nthe robot 73 is movable in a X-Y (horizontal) direction along the shelf 72 under the control of the controller 60.\n\nthe robot 73 includes a chuck hand 74 for gripping the lower end of the tube 71, and a cylinder 75 for vertically moving the chuck hand 74.\n\nthe chuck hand 74 is first caused to grip the lower end of the tube 71 which is suspended in a fixed position. Thereafter, the cylinder 75 is operable to raise the tube 71.\n\nthe robot 73 is moved in a horizontal direction so as to bring the tube 71 into vertical alignment with the desired bulk feeder 2.\n\nthe cylinder 75 is again operable so as to insert the lower end of the tube 71 into the opening 42 of the chip case 12.\n\nthe controller 60 opens the on-off valve 57 as in the first embodiment. A fixed amount of chips is then fed from the chip tank 55 through the tube 71 into the chip case 12. The on-off valve 57 is thereafter closed. The cylinder 75 is again operable to raise the tube 71. Thereafter, the chuck hand 74 is opened to release the tube 71. This causes the tube 71 to be returned to its home or suspended position under the influence of its own resiliency.\n\nthe chip tank 55 is supported in a fixed position. If the bulk feeder 2 is moved away from the chip tank 55, it is necessary to bend the flexible tube 71 to a substantial extent. Also, it is necessary to provide a long tube 71 such that chips can be replenished even if the bulk feeder 2 and the chip tank 55 are separated to a maximum extent. To this end, the reel shaft table 3 is driven to move the bulk feeder 2 with an empty chip case 12 to a position near the chip tank 55. This eliminates the need to substantially bend the tube 71 and allows for the use of a short tube.\n\nreplenishment of chips is carried out while a printed circuit board is being loaded.\n\nthe chip tank 55 or the tube 71 may be moved in synchronism with the bulk feeder 2 during mounting of the chips so as to replenish an empty chip case 12 with the chips. In such a case, there is no need to stop the chip mounting machine during replenishing operation. This results in a substantial improvement in operating efficiency.\n\nthe present invention is also applicable to a chip mounting machine wherein one of two bulk feeders is in a stand-by position while the other bulk feeder is involved in the mounting of chips.\n\nthe automatic replenishing apparatus is operable to replenish the bulk feeder in the stand-by position with chips. This eliminates the need to operate the automatic replenishing apparatus at high speeds since a sufficient time is made available.\n\nchips are fed to the bulk cassette through the chip case.\n\nchips may be fed directly to the bulk cassette in the event that the bulk case has such a volume as to contain a sufficient number of chips. This alternative arrangement eliminates the need for a chip case.\n\nthe present invention is applicable not only to a chip mounting machine, but also other machines (for example, automatic taping machine) as far as they are provided with an alignment/feed apparatus.\n\nthe senor detects whether the number of chips within the container space has fallen below a predetermined level. If so, a predetermined amount of chips is fed from the chip tank through the replenishment line to the container space. This automates the chip replenishment operation. In contrast to the prior art, there is no need to mount or remove chip cases since additional chips are fed through the replenishment line.\n\nthe present invention enables operation of the chip mounting machine substantially in a continuous manner. No stoppage of the machine takes place.
