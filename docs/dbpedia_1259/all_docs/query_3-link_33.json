        "text": "I am MURATA. I am HOME.\n\nThe Philippine Manufacturing Co. of Murata, Inc. (PMM) manufactures a Multi-layer Ceramic Capacitor (MLCC) in support of its parent company Murata Manufacturing Corporation (MMC) with headquarters in Japan. PMM is located at FPIP in Tanauan, Batangas, and is turning just 11 years old this October 2023.\n\nSTRATEGIC AND VALUABLE SITE\n\nMurata is the global leader in many of its product categories including MLCC. Thus, PMM stands as one of the most strategic sites of MMC with nearly 5% of its total workforce housed in PMM.\n\nYOUNG AND GETTING BETTER\n\nDespite being one of the youngest if not the youngest manufacturing sites of Murata, we have achieved significant strides in our first decade and have received ISO certifications and recognitions in various categories from PEZA and the RBA (Responsible Business Alliance).\n\nAnd we continue to exert serious and strategic efforts towards becoming better – towards making our stakeholders feel “at home.”\n\nWe do not claim to be a GREAT company. But we KNOW we are VERY GOOD.\n\nWe have so much to learn and so much to improve.\n\nWhat makes us very good is not that we do ONE THING great. It is that we do multiple things consistently and integratively.\n\nMURATA’S SHAZE (COMPANY PHILOSOPHY) AND PMM’S GRAND DESIGN\n\nMurata’s Shaze says,\n\nWe contribute to the\n\nadvancement of society\n\nby\n\nEnhancing technologies and skills\n\nApplying scientific approach\n\nCreating innovative products and solutions\n\nBeing trustworthy and,\n\ntogether with all our stakeholders,\n\nthankful for the increase in prosperity.\n\nPMM’s Grand Design is anchored on our Shaze and boasts of a delicate balance of satisfying Employees, Customers, and Society. And so, throughout the years we have engaged in activities and programs that are designed to satisfy these 3 major stakeholders.\n\nSOCIAL SATISFACTION\n\nOur text Shaze emphasizes that the reason why we exist is to contribute to the advancement of society.\n\nWe exist to elevate the way society lives.\n\nThis is evident in our commitment to supporting the United Nations SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) through our ESG activities.\n\nTherefore, we are committed not just “to not harm” society and the environment through our RE100 project or the 100% use of renewable energy.\n\nWe lead and support initiatives to restore our environment through tree-planting and river clean-up activities among others.\n\nWe provide scholarships, Medical Missions, Street lighting projects, school facility support, and many others.\n\nCUSTOMER SATISFACTION\n\nOur customers trust us. This is evident by the fact that we are No.1 in terms of MLCC market share.\n\nPMM’s operations, processes, and systems are designed, reviewed, and updated to keep things that way.\n\nOur Shaze (company philosophy) is WHO WE ARE. We simply cannot act against our nature.\n\nWe ensure customer satisfaction by enhancing technologies and skills, applying a scientific approach, and enhancing technologies and skills.\n\nThe kind of customer satisfaction (CS) we provide produces another kind of CS – Customer Success.\n\nMurata is at the forefront of innovation in the business we are in.\n\nWe are INNOVATOR IN ELECTRONICS.\n\nEMPLOYEE SATISFACTION. Employee Engagement. Employee Experience.\n\nUniversity Partnerships\n\nTo ensure a rich and continuous supply of human capital for our critical positions, we have university partnerships from Northern Luzon all the way down to Mindanao.\n\nThese university partnerships include Plant Visits, Scholarships, Job fairs, and donations, among others.\n\nPeople Development and Management\n\nWe offer an extensive line-up of development opportunities from instructor-led training, book readings, and online programs. PMM provides its employees with overseas opportunities such as expatriation, overseas training, or business meetings.\n\nWe are serious about developing our leaders and we have a line-up of programs that are delivered throughout the year. And we don’t just develop our local employees.\n\nOur human capital management systems are founded on competencies. We evaluate, promote, reward and develop our employees based on our established competencies.\n\nOpen Communication\n\nWe value respect and integrity.\n\nExchanges of opinions and ideas happen everywhere. In fact, Murata’s philosophy on D&I (Diversity & Inclusion) extends to applying D&D on opinions.\n\nOne great way for opinions to be heard is through the Sit Back, Relax Tayo sessions between five (5) select employees and a member of the Top Management. Each month, several sessions are done at our Murata Garden over some delightful snacks.\n\nWork-life Balance and Social Events\n\nSocial events are natural occurrences throughout the year averaging 3 major events and 5 minor events each year to create opportunities for our employees to create stronger bonds beyond working hours.\n\nOur annual Year-end Party (which we fondly call YEP ) is arguably the most awaited event for everyone.\n\nOur Birthday with the President happens 36 times throughout the year!\n\nThe GEM (Grand Employees of Murata) celebrates excellent contributions as well as service loyalty.\n\nMany other events such as Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, and Diversity & Inclusion celebrations make our employees feel connected and at home."
