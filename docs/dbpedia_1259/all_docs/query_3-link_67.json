        "text": "Boosting the Evolution of Cars in Line with Connected, Autonomous, Shared, and Electric (CASE) with the Power of Electronic Components\n\nProposal 1: Toward the Realization of More Attractive EVs with Greater Convenience\n\nResin Molding SMD Type MLCCs for Noise Suppression, Supporting High-Value-Added EVs: EVA Series [New Product]\n\nA movement is underway to increase the battery voltage from the approximately 400 V it has been conventionally to 800 V or more in the development of the latest EVs. The aim is to lengthen the traveling range and to shorten the charging time. The EVA series is resin-mold SMD-type multilayer ceramic capacitors for noise suppression in EVs. The series makes it possible to secure the creepage distance required under a high-voltage load that conforms to safety standards while being small and low profile (12.7 × 6.0 × 3.7 mm). These products can be utilized as noise suppression components that ensure high safety by applying them to EV on-board chargers (OBCs) equipped with high-voltage batteries in the 800 V class, motor drive inverters, and other products. Replacing the film capacitors and large single-layer capacitors used up to now has realized the downsizing of circuit substrates. This can contribute to expanding the vehicle interior space, improving the degree of freedom in the layout of electrical components and increasing the battery capacity. Moreover, mounting with reflow is also possible. Therefore, it also boosts a reduction in assembly costs.\n\nSupporting the Higher Performance and Safety of Batteries for Electric Vehicles with High-precision Temperature Detection: SMD NTC Thermistors\n\nHigh Temperature Film Capacitors for Automotive for X in 1 Integrated Power Electronics\n\nFunctional integration is underway on the components of electric systems of inverters, motors, gears, on-board chargers (OBCs), DC-DC converters and other power electronics equipment as seen with E-Axle in anticipation of the spread of EVs. In the midst of this trend, high-capacity film capacitors used in circuits that handle high-voltage and high-current power are now required to be high-heat resistant and low-profile products that can handle the increase in power density. Murata has developed a high temperature film capacitor for automotive that meets these new demands by utilizing our knowledge of higher quality and downsizing that we have built up through the development of ceramic capacitors. Conventional film capacitors offered heat resistance of 85°C to 105°C. That was not sufficient for power electronics equipment with high power density. Murata has adopted film materials we have independently developed for the film capacitors we have developed. As a result, we have realized high heat resistance of 125°C to 135°C. This will contribute to the downsizing and lower weight of automotive power electronics equipment, which is becoming increasing integrated.\n\nProposal 2: Toward the Automation of Even Safer and More Comfortable Cars\n\nReform of Electrical/Electronic (E/E) Architecture and Electronic Component Groups That Meet the Demands of Autonomous Driving / ADAS\n\nRealization of Even Safer Automatic Braking with Wide Range and High-precision Distance Detection: Ultrasonic Sensors [Under Development]\n\nThere is a need for ultrasonic sensors that can detect the distance between a vehicle and surrounding cars and objects over a wider range at high precision to realize safe automatic braking systems and automatic parking systems. Murata is currently developing ultrasonic sensors with further improved performance over both short and long distances. We have reduced the resonance frequency tolerance by 50% compared to what it was before, which has stabilized the distance detection performance in a range of up to a maximum of 550 cm. We have also reduced the capacitance tolerance by 50% compared to previously, which has shortened the minimum detection range that was 30 cm in conventional products to 15 cm or less to improve short-distance performance. Furthermore, we have realized compatibility with coding ICs through lowering the Q and standardizing the Q tolerance. We have also improved the temperature characteristics. Murata is also developing a millimeter wave radar solution in the 79 GHz band suitable for detecting the situation around vehicles such as to assist with parking.\n\nSupporting Safe Driving by Constantly Watching over the Health Condition of Vehicle Occupants with Sensors: Vehicle Occupant Monitoring Sensors [Reference Exhibit]\n\nAccurately Identifying Vehicle Location Even in Places Where GPS Radio Waves Do Not Reach: SCHA600 Inertial Force Sensor\n\nProposal 3: Toward the Realization of Connected Cars That Can Be Reliably Connected in Various Settings\n\nCommunication Module for V2X Compliant with Two Major Standards: Type 1YL and Type 2AN\n\nTo realize autonomous driving, it is necessary to have a mechanism that collects information that cannot be detected with sensors equipped to a vehicle alone from surrounding cars and traffic infrastructure such as traffic lights. It is essential to equip vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication functions to realize that. Type 1YL and Type 2AN are communication modules for V2X developed for the first time by Murata that are compatible with both the DSRC method (compliant with IEEE801.11) and the cellular V2X method (3GPP Release 14/15 and PCS compliant). We have equipped the modules with a chipset compliant with the AEC-Q100 made by Autotalks Ltd., which is a world leader in the V2X chipset market. We have produced modules with high quality, robustness, and performance level by utilizing Murata's high-frequency RF design technologies and unique high-density mounting technologies. The standard method that must be supported differs by country and region with V2X. However, it is possible to easily support the requirements of the destination country with Type 1YL and Type 2AN.\n\nTires with Built-in RFID Boosting Digital Transformation (DX) in the Transportation Industry\n\nReducing the downtime of trucks when inspecting and repairing tires and similar challenges are urgent issues in the transportation industry, which is suffering from a shortage of workers. Murata has developed a type of RFID built into tires jointly with Michelin SCA. This is a technology that will boost the promotion of digital transformation (DX) in the transportation industry. Utilizing this type of RFID built into tires we have developed will make it possible to improve the efficiency of tire management work such as with inventory and logistics management, records of the remaining tread on an individual tire basis, and records of the retread (restoration) history. It is a small (1.8 mm in height and up to 40 mm in width) tag using UHF band RAIN RFID (865 to 920 MHz). It is also durable enough to withstand impacts during tire processing and traveling. In addition, it is possible to realize good communication characteristics even after being built into tires by applying Murata's unique antenna design.\n\nProposal 4: Murata's Technologies and Products Supporting the Further Evolution of Cars\n\nRealizing Safe Driving by Visualizing Driver Fatigue in the Freight and Transport Industries: MF100 Fatigue Stress Meter\n\nEmbedding Sensors and Communication Functions into Streetlights to Watch over Residents and Society: Smart Pole Compatible Technology\n\nSimulation Software for Designers: Femtet\n\nFemtet is user-friendly analysis simulation software that meets the diverse analysis needs of developers and designers by combining eight analysis functions in one package. Finite element analysis of electromagnetic waves, magnetic fields, electric fields, stress, heat conduction, fluid, piezoelectricity, and sound waves, as well as coupled analysis of those elements, can be easily performed, like using a calculator. A database management function for materials, boundary conditions, body attributes, and models is equipped as standard. The data created by each user can be shared and used by an entire development team. This is software produced in Japan that Murata has made unique improvements to over about 40 years.\n\nIn addition to technologies and knowledge accumulated within the automobile industry up to now, innovation based on new ideas cultivated in other industries is becoming necessary to accomplish the revolution being undertaken by the automobile industry. Murata has accumulated materials technologies, process technologies, product design technologies, production technologies, and software technologies, analysis and evaluation technologies which support them, and other such technologies by developing, producing, and selling ceramics-based electronic components. We will utilize these technology foundations to make creative products and solutions that will boost the evolution of automobiles. This will contribute to the further development of the automobile industry and the realization of a smart and comfortable mobility society.\n\nThe content of this article is based on information available at the time of our participation at the exhibition.
