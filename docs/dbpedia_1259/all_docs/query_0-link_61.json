        "text": "Not to be confused with Pensonic Group.\n\nPanasonic Corporation (パナソニック株式会社, Panasonikku Kabushiki-gaisha), formerly known as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. (松下電器産業株式会社, Matsushita Denki Sangyō Kabushiki-gaisha), is a Japanese multinational electronics corporation headquartered in Kadoma, Osaka, Japan.[2]\n\nThe company was founded in 1918 as a producer of lightbulb sockets and has grown to become one of the largest Japanese electronics producers alongside Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba, Pioneer and Canon Inc. In addition to electronics, it offers non-electronic products and services such as home renovation services[citation needed]. Panasonic was the world's fourth-largest television manufacturer by 2012 market share.[3]\n\nPanasonic has a primary listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX indices. It has a secondary listing on the Nagoya Stock Exchange.\n\nName[]\n\nFrom 1935 to October 1, 2008, the company name was \"Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.\"[4][5] On January 10, 2008, the company announced that it would change its name to \"Panasonic Corporation\", in effect on October 1, 2008, to conform with its global brand name \"Panasonic\".[6] The name change was approved at a shareholders' meeting on June 26, 2008 after consultation with the Matsushita family.[7]\n\nHistory[]\n\n20th century[]\n\nPanasonic was founded in 1918 by Kōnosuke Matsushita as a vendor of duplex lamp sockets.[8] In the 1920s Matsushita began regularly launching products. In 1927, he produced a line of bicycle lamps that were the first to be marketed with the National brand name.[9] During World War II the company operated factories in Japan and other parts of Asia which produced electrical components and appliances such as light fixtures, motors, electric irons, wireless equipment and its first vacuum tubes.[10]\n\nAfter the war, Panasonic regrouped as a Keiretsu and began to supply the post-war boom in Japan with radios and appliances, as well as bicycles. Matsushita's brother-in-law, Toshio Iue, founded Sanyo as a subcontractor for components after World War II. Sanyo grew to become a competitor to Panasonic, but was later acquired by Panasonic in December 2009.[11]\n\nIn 1961, Matsushita traveled to the United States and met American dealers. The company began producing television sets for the U.S. market under the Panasonic brand name, and expanded the use of the brand to Europe in 1979.[12]\n\nThe company used the National brand outside North America from the 1950s to the 1970s (the trademark could not be used in the United States because it was already in use).[13] The inability to use the National brand name led to the creation of the Panasonic brand in the United States.[13] Over the next several decades Panasonic released additional products, including black and white TV's (1952), electrical blenders, fridges (1953), rice cookers (1959), color TV's and microwave ovens (1966).[13]\n\nThe company debuted a hi-fidelity audio speaker in Japan in 1965 with the brand Technics. This line of high quality stereo components became worldwide favorites, the most famous products being its turntables, such as the SL-1200 record player, known for its high performance, precision and durability. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Panasonic continued to produce high-quality specialized electronics for niche markets such as shortwave radios, and developed its successful line of stereo receivers, CD players and other components.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1973, Matsushita established \"Anam National\", joint venture with Anam Group in South Korea.\n\nIn 1983, Matsushita launched the Panasonic Senior Partner, the first fully IBM PC compatible Japanese-made computer.[14] In November 1990, Matsushita agreed to acquire the American media company MCA Inc. for US$6.59 billion.[15][16] Matsushita subsequently sold 80% of MCA to Seagram Company for US$7 billion in April 1995.[17][18]\n\nIn 1998, Matsushita sold Anam National to Anam Electronics.\n\n2000 to present[]\n\nOn May 2, 2002, Panasonic Canada marked its 35th anniversary in that country by giving $5 million to help build a \"music city\" on Toronto's waterfront.[19]\n\nOn January 19, 2006, Panasonic announced that it would stop producing analog televisions (then 30% of its total TV business) from the next month, in order to concentrate on digital televisions.[20]\n\nIn 2008, all models of electric shavers from the Panasonic factory were called Panasonic shavers, and they dropped Matsushita and National from their name, regardless of worldwide or Japanese markets.\n\nOn November 3, 2008, Panasonic and Sanyo announced that they were holding merger talks, which eventually resulted in the acquisition of Sanyo by Panasonic.[21][22] The merger was completed in December 2009, and resulted in a corporation with revenues of over ¥11.2 trillion (around $110 billion).[23]\n\nWith the announcement that Pioneer would exit the production of its Kuro plasma HDTV displays, Panasonic purchased many of the patents and incorporated these technologies into its own plasma displays.\n\nIn April 2011, it was announced that Panasonic would cut its work force by 40,000 by the end of fiscal 2012 in a bid to streamline overlapping operations.

The $5 billion plant would employ 6,500 people, and reduce Tesla's battery costs by 30 percent. The company said it was looking at potential sites in Nevada, Arizona, Texas, New Mexico and California.[35]\n\nIn October 2014, Panasonic announced its initial investment in Tesla Motors’ battery factory would amount to \"tens of billions\" of yen, according to the firm's CEO.[36]\n\nIn November 2014, Panasonic announced its partnership with Photon Interactive to create customized and personalized digital signs in stores.[37]\n\nIn January 2015, Panasonic announced it has stopped making TVs in China and plans to liquidate its joint venture in Shandong.[38]\n\nIn March 2015, Panasonic announced plans to buy Houston-based satellite communication service provider ITC Global.[39]\n\nIn April 2015, Panasonic announced its new range of products and relaunched its brand in South Africa.

Joseph M. Taylor, Chairman and CEO of Panasonic Corp. of America, laid out the plans for the partnership in four key areas: smart housing and small offices, energy and utilities, transportation and city services and smart buildings.[44]\n\nDue to increased competition from China, Panasonic's LiIon auto market share decreased from 47% in 2014 to 34% in 2015.[45] In June 2016, Tesla Motors, Inc. announced that Panasonic Corporation would be the exclusive supplier of batteries for its mass market vehicle Model 3. Batteries for the higher-end Model S sedan and Model X SUV will also be supplied by Panasonic.[46] In early 2016 Panasonic president Kazuhiro Tsuga confirmed a planned total investment of about $1.6 billion by the company to construct the Gigafactory to full capacity.[47] However, after the number of Model 3 reservations became known in April,[48] Panasonic moved production plans forward and announced a bond sale for $3.86 billion, most of it to be invested in Gigafactory.[49]\n\nIn 2016, it debuted its transparent TV.[50]\n\nIn August 2018, the company announced, in order to avoid potential tax issues Panasonic will move its European headquarters from the UK to Amsterdam in October as Brexit approaches.[51][52]\n\nOn 25 September 2018, Panasonic became one of the founding members of the L-Mount Alliance, and announced two full-frame mirrorless cameras and a range of L-Mount lenses to be launched in 2019.[53] The 47-megapixel Panasonic Lumix S1R and the 24-megapixel Panasonic Lumix S1 will be the first full-frame mirrorless cameras produced by Panasonic and will offer the Lumix Pro support service for professional photographers.
