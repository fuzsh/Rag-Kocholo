Maintains 2.09% Dividend Yield\n\nAt the most recent price, the company’s dividend yield is 2.09%.\n\nAdditionally, the company’s dividend payout ratio is 0.52. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company’s income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company’s income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.\n\nThe company’s 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.35% , demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time.\n\nWhat is the Fund Sentiment?\n\nThere are 324 funds or institutions reporting positions in Murata Manufacturing Co..
