        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- The shares of Apple Inc.’s suppliers slumped after Berkshire Hathaway Inc. nearly halved its stake in the iPhone maker. The decline came amid a broad market selloff Monday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAfrica’s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure\n\nNYC Subway Riders See ‘Exceptionally High’ Air Pollution\n\nHow a Tiny Midwestern Town Became a Mecca for Modern Architecture\n\nNew York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants\n\nNew York City’s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing\n\nTaipei-listed iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. and chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. slid about 10% each. Among component makers Murata Manufacturing Co. tumbled 15% in Tokyo, while LG Innotek Co. tanked as much as 13% in Seoul and Luxshare Precision Industry Co. fell 7.7% in Shenzhen.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway sold $75.5 billion worth of Apple stock on a net basis in the second quarter, sending Warren Buffett’s cash pile to a record $276.9 billion. The billionaire unloaded shares as US stock gauges climbed toward the peaks reached in mid-July, before the recent wave of profit-taking on the artificial intelligence rally.\n\n“It should be hard for anyone to argue that this is not a market negative,” Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, wrote in a report, referring to Berkshire’s sale of Apple shares.\n\nShares of Apple climbed 23% in three months to June and touched a record high on July 16, as hopes grew for the company’s AI offerings. However, Apple’s new AI features won’t be ready in time for the initial launch of its upcoming iPhone and iPad software overhauls, Bloomberg News reported last week.\n\nBuffett’s firm revealed in May that it had reduced some of its position in Apple during the first quarter of the year. Even after the latest sales, Apple remains Berkshire’s largest single position.\n\n“It was expected that Berkshire would continue dialing back its position in Apple, although the magnitude of the drop will likely surprise some people,” Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge wrote in a note.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Happens When Ozempic Takes Over Your Town\n\nNate Silver Wants to Teach You How to Be a Better Gambler\n\nMade-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown\n\nFive Questions for Trump Adviser Scott Bessent\n\nMark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
