Actress Moji Afolayan today surprised her fans with the birthday photos she posted on her instagram page.

Moji, who lives in Ibadan with her Oyo-born comic actor, Razaq Olayiwola‎, Ojopagogo, is an elder sister to Kunle and Gabriel Afolayan who have become the darling of many Nollywood fans.

The photo has generated many comments. While some fans supported the make-up, some wants her to revert to her ‘natural beauty’.

Reacting to the post, Moji’s husband, Ojopagogo, was said to have said: ‎”My wife is not just not a pretty woman but a natural and simple person. I married her for her simplicity and natural beauty, but you know the trend sets in anytime and you have to borrow it sometimes. Makeup or no makeup, my wife is forever adorable.”
