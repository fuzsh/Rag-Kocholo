Following the comments of fans on her instagram page on her birthday regarging the photos she posted some Fans supported her natural beauty no makeup style, while some said the glam thing is beautiful.\n\nTHE ACTRESS WITHOUT MAKEUP\n\nJust like the popular internet slang that says ” is it your face,or is she your wife” we contacted Her husband Razaq Olayiwola Ojopagogo who we think has the final say on the actress. He has this to say.\n\nMy wife is not just not a pretty woman, but a natural and simple person. I married her for her simplicity and natural beauty, but you know the trend sets in anytime and you have to borrow it sometime. Makeup or no makeup, my wife is forever adorable"
