Probably remembering what he shared in the past with late Moji, Kunle posted the above photo captioning it;\n\n‘Some years back with the beautifully talented @bimboakintola and the adorable late #mojiolaiya . Make the best of now as no one knows what the next Sec holds. #throwbackthursday #throwback’.\n\nMay her soul continue to rest in peace. Amen!"
