        "text": "During this session, Asake revealed that he didn’t initially know Wizkid would be featured on the song ‘MMS’. Asake explained that P.Priime, the producer of the song, played it for Wizkid. Wizkid liked the song so much that he decided to record a verse for it.\n\nThis collaboration between Asake and Wizkid has been very successful.\n\nThe song set a new record for the highest number of streams on its first day on Spotify Nigeria. Not only that, but Asake’s entire album also broke the record for the most streams on its opening day.\n\nDuring the live session, a fan asked why Davido wasn’t featured on the new album. Asake responded by saying that he actually has some unreleased songs with Davido. He mentioned that these songs will be released at a later date.\n\nThe singer also talked about his upcoming ‘Lungu Boy’ tour. This tour will include performances at some famous venues. One of these is the O2 Arena in London, where Asake has performed before in 2023.\n\nAnother is the iconic Madison Square Garden in New York. By performing at Madison Square Garden, Asake will become only the fourth Nigerian artist to headline a show at this prestigious venue.\n\nGet more music updates here.\n\nHe said,\n\n“When it happened, I felt like I was at a crossroads with God and I had two choices. It was either the middle finger to God and saying, ‘You know what? I’m done. This is not what you promised, this isn’t what you said. I’m leaving, I’m not doing this anymore. Where has this gotten us? And the other option was to stay there and just cry.”\n\nHe said,\n\n“It was one of my biggest fears at the time and you know scenes in movies where you see soldiers in war-battered and broken; his shield is somewhere and he’s pretty much lifeless. I felt battered and broken at that time and I remember God saying, ‘Get up, soldier. Don’t you realise that you’re fearless now? The worst has happened so what can the devil use to threaten or scare you anymore?”\n\nWatch the full interview below.\n\nGet more updates here."
