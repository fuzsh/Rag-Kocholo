        "text": "In a realm where few venture into professional careers during their teenage years, Eyiyemi Afolayan is a remarkable exception.\n\nBorn into the esteemed Afolayan family on September 11th, 2005, Eyiyemi made her acting debut at a tender age, captivating audiences with her performance in the 2022 film “Anikulapo.”\n\nNow, at 18, she prepares to dazzle once more in the highly anticipated sequel, “Anikulapo: Rise of the Spectre.”\n\nEyiyemi, the eldest child of acclaimed filmmaker and actor Kunle Afolayan, inherits a legacy steeped in cinematic brilliance, being the granddaughter of the iconic Adeyemi Afolayan, fondly known as Adelove.\n\nWith acting seemingly woven into her genes, Eyiyemi follows in the footsteps of her uncles Gabriel and Aremu Afolayan, yet her talent shines uniquely, evident in her awe-inspiring performance in the original “Anikulapo.”\n\nJoining a stellar cast including Kunle Remi, Bimbo Ademoye, Taiwo Hassan, Moji Afolayan, and the familiar faces from the first film, Eyiyemi is set to deliver an even more impressive portrayal in the sequel.\n\nNew additions to the ensemble, such as Gabriel Afolayan, Layi Wasabi, Niyi Johnson, Titi Kuti, and Damilola Ogunsi, promise to enrich the cinematic experience.\n\nScheduled for release on March 1st on the popular streaming platform Netflix, “Anikulapo: Rise of the Spectre” has already ignited fervent anticipation among viewers.\n\nWith the unveiling of the trailer, excitement peaks as audiences catch glimpses of Eyiyemi reprising her role as Princess Omowunmi. Her character’s evolution or continuity from the previous installment tantalises fans, adding to the eagerness surrounding the sequel’s release.\n\nALSO READ: Beyond Ankara: Six comfortable Nigerian fabrics you should include in your wardrobe\n\nReflecting on her role as Princess Omowunmi in “Anikulapo” (2022), Eyiyemi remarked, “Omowunmi is very foolish because Saro never proposed love to her, but she already started having ideas in her head. She is beautiful, no doubt, but also gullible.”"
