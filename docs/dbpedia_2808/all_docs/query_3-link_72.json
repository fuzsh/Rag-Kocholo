        "text": "Important Information\n\nCanada has aligned the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) with the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS).\n\nThis document discusses the WHMIS supplier requirements as regulated by the federal legislation – the Hazardous Products Act and the Hazardous Products Regulations (HPR). This document reflects the Hazardous Products Regulations requirements as of December 15, 2022. The changes introduced in December 2022 are in force. Suppliers are granted a 3-year transition period (to December 15, 2025) to bring product classifications, safety data sheets and labels into compliance with the amendments.\n\nFor most workplaces, the most notable impact will be seen in the changes to the flammable gases class, and the new class of chemicals under pressure.\n\nHealth Canada is the government body responsible for the overall WHMIS supplier-related laws. Note that WHMIS is also regulated in the workplace by the provinces, territories and federal (for federally regulated workplaces) governments under their occupational health and safety legislation. While these jurisdictions based their WHMIS regulations on a common model, small variations between jurisdictions may exist.\n\nSuppliers and employers must use and follow the WHMIS requirements for labels and safety data sheets (SDSs) for hazardous products sold, distributed, or imported into Canada.\n\nPlease refer to the following OSH Answers documents for more information about WHMIS:\n\nWHMIS – General\n\nWHMIS – Pictograms\n\nWHMIS – Labels\n\nWHMIS – Hazard Classes and Categories\n\nWHMIS – Education and Training\n\nWHMIS – WHMIS Program\n\nWHMIS – Glossary\n\nWHMIS – Confidential Business Information (CBI)\n\nWHMIS – Variances\n\nWHMIS – Laboratories\n\nWhat is an SDS?\n\nBack to top\n\nSafety Data Sheets (SDSs) are summary documents that provide information about the hazards of a product and advice about safety precautions. SDSs are usually written by the manufacturer or supplier of the product, and must be provided by the suppliers of the hazardous products at the time of sale. In some circumstances, an employer may be required to prepare an SDS (e.g., when the product is produced and used exclusively in that workplace).\n\nSDSs provide more detailed hazard information about the product than the label. They are an important information resource for workplaces and workers about the product(s) used. Use this information to identify the hazards of the products you use, and follow the recommended safe handling and emergency measures to protect workers from those hazards.\n\nSDSs tell users what the hazards of the product are, how to use the product safely, what to expect if the recommendations are not followed, how to recognize symptoms of exposure, and what to do if emergencies occur.\n\nDo I need an SDS?\n\nBack to top\n\nIf a product covered by the Hazardous Products Act meets the criteria to be classified in a hazard class or category as listed in the Hazardous Products Regulation, it is considered to be a \"hazardous product\". The official definition of a “hazardous product” is\n\nhazardous product means any product, mixture, material or substance that is classified in accordance with the regulations made under subsection 15(1) in a category or subcategory of a hazard class listed in Schedule 2; (produit dangereux)\n\nIn other words, every product classified as a \"hazardous product\" under WHMIS that is intended for use, handling or storage in a workplace in Canada must have an SDS.\n\nThe information elements provided on a safety data sheet must be in both official languages of Canada (English and French). The SDS may be provided as one bilingual SDS, or as two SDSs (one each in English and French). In situations where two separate SDSs are used, both the English and French parts must be provided to the purchaser at the same time. Providing an SDS in only English or French would not be considered to be in compliance.\n\nWhat information is on the SDS?\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Hazardous Products Regulations (HPR) specifies the sections and content for the SDS. Schedule 1 within the HPR outlines the section number and heading that must be presented in the specified order, as follows:\n\nSDS Section and HeadingSpecific Information Elements1Identification\n\nProduct identifier (e.g., Product name)\n\nOther means of identification (e.g., product family, synonyms, etc.)\n\nRecommended use\n\nRestrictions on use\n\nCanadian supplier identifier+\n\nName, full address and phone number(s)\n\nEmergency telephone number and any restrictions on the use of that number, if applicable++\n\n2Hazard identification\n\nHazard classification (class, category or subcategory) of substance or mixture or a description of the identified hazard for Physical or Health Hazards Not Otherwise Classified\n\nLabel elements:\n\nSymbol (image) or the name of the symbol (e.g., flame, skull and crossbones)\n\nSignal word\n\nHazard statement(s)\n\nPrecautionary statement(s)\n\nOther hazards which do not result in classification (e.g., molten metal hazard)\n\nNOTE: Information elements are specified for: combustible dusts, simple asphyxiants, physical hazards not otherwise classified, chemicals under pressure, biohazardous infections materials, and health hazards not otherwise classified.\n\n3Composition/Information on ingredients\n\nWhen a hazardous product is a material or substance:\n\nChemical name\n\nCommon name and synonyms\n\nChemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry number and any unique identifiers\n\nChemical name of impurities, stabilizing solvents and/or additives*\n\nFor each material or substance in a mixture that is classified in a health hazard class**:\n\nChemical name\n\nCommon name and synonyms\n\nCAS registry number and any unique identifiers\n\nConcentration\n\nNOTE: Confidential business information rules can apply\n\n4First-aid measures\n\nFirst-aid measures by route of exposure:\n\nInhalation\n\nSkin contact\n\nEye contact\n\nIngestion\n\nMost important symptoms and effects (acute or delayed)\n\nImmediate medical attention and special treatment, if necessary\n\n5Fire-fighting measures\n\nSuitable extinguishing media\n\nUnsuitable extinguishing media\n\nSpecific hazards arising from the hazardous product (e.g., hazardous combustion products)\n\nSpecial protective equipment and precautions for fire-fighters\n\n6Accidental release measures\n\nPersonal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures\n\nMethods and materials for containment and cleaning up\n\n7Handling and storage\n\nPrecautions for safe handling\n\nConditions for safe storage (including incompatible materials)\n\n8Exposure controls/\n\nPersonal protection\n\nControl parameters, including occupational exposure guidelines or biological exposure limits and the source of those values\n\nAppropriate engineering controls\n\nIndividual protection measures (e.g., personal protective equipment)\n\n9Physical and chemical properties\n\nPhysical state\n\nColour\n\nOdour\n\nMelting point and Freezing point\n\nBoiling point, or initial boiling point and boiling range\n\nFlammability\n\nLower flammable or explosive limit\n\nUpper flammable or explosive limit\n\nFlash point\n\nAuto-ignition temperature\n\nDecomposition temperature\n\npH\n\nKinematic viscosity\n\nSolubility\n\nPartition coefficient - n-octanol/water\n\nVapour pressure\n\nDensity and relative density\n\nRelative vapour density\n\nParticle characteristics\n\n10Stability and reactivity\n\nReactivity\n\nChemical stability\n\nPossibility of hazardous reactions\n\nConditions to avoid (e.g., static discharge, shock, or vibration)\n\nIncompatible materials\n\nHazardous decomposition products\n\n11Toxicological information\n\nA concise but complete description of the various toxic health effects and the data used to identify those effects, including:\n\nInformation on the likely routes of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, skin and eye contact)\n\nSymptoms related to the physical, chemical and toxicological characteristics\n\nDelayed and immediate effects, and chronic effects from short-term and long-term exposure\n\nNumerical measures of toxicity, including acute toxicity estimates (ATEs)\n\n12Ecological information***\n\nEcotoxicity\n\nPersistence and degradability\n\nBioaccumulative potential\n\nMobility in soil\n\nOther adverse effects\n\n13Disposal considerations***Information on safe handling for disposal and methods of disposal, including any contaminated packaging14Transport information***\n\nUN number\n\nUN proper shipping name\n\nTransport hazard class(es)\n\nPacking group\n\nEnvironmental hazards\n\nSpecial precautions\n\n15Regulatory information***Safety, health and environmental regulations specific to the product16Other informationDate of the latest revision of the SDS\n\n+The supplier that must be identified on an SDS is the initial supplier identifier (i.e., the name, address and telephone number of either the Canadian manufacturer or the Canadian importer). There are two exceptions to this requirement. 1) In a situation where a hazardous product is being sold by a Canadian distributor, the distributor may replace the name, address and telephone number of the initial supplier with their own contact information. 2) In a situation where an importer imports a hazardous product for use in their own workplace in Canada (i.e., the importer is not selling the hazardous product), the importer may retain the name, address and telephone number of the foreign supplier on the SDS instead of replacing it with their own contact information.\n\n++The emergency telephone number is a telephone number that will allow the caller to get information about the hazardous product. This number does not have to be a Canadian telephone number. Any restrictions on the use of that number must be stated (e.g., days and hours of operation). If the language spoken at the telephone number is neither English nor French, this should be indicated on the SDS as part of the restrictions on the use of the number.\n\n*These impurities and stabilizing products are those that are classified in a health hazard class and contribute to the classification of the material or substance.\n\n**Each ingredient in the mixture must be listed when it is classified in a health hazard class and is present above the concentration limit that is designated for the hazard class in which it is classified or is present in the mixture at a concentration that results in the mixture being classified in any health hazard class. Each ingredient present in mixtures at concentrations above the relevant cut-off levels set for its category or subcategory must be disclosed, regardless of whether the hazardous ingredient contributes to the classification of the mixture as a hazardous product.\n\n***Sections 12 to 15 require the headings to be present, but under Canadian regulations, the supplier has the option to not provide information in these sections.\n\nHow may a supplier provide the SDS to their customers?\n\nBack to top\n\nA supplier will provide the SDS, in English and French, to the purchaser of the hazardous product either in hard copy (e.g., by mail, hand delivered, etc.) or by electronic means. Acceptable electronic delivery methods include an e-mail from the supplier to the purchaser with the SDS attached, or a USB on which the SDS is saved and given to the purchaser. If the English and French portions of the SDS are two separate parts, both the English and French parts must be attached in the same email, or saved on the same USB stick.\n\nNote: It is not acceptable to provide an SDS by only providing the purchaser of the hazardous product with a website address or hyperlink from which the purchaser may download the SDS for the hazardous product that they purchased.\n\nWhen is the SDS updated?\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Hazardous Products Act and regulations require that SDSs be accurate at the time of sale. An SDS will be required to be updated when the supplier becomes aware of any \"significant new data\". The definition of \"significant new data\" is:\n\n\"New data regarding the hazard presented by a hazardous product that change its classification in a category or subcategory of a hazard class, or result in its classification in another hazard class, or change the ways to protect against the hazard presented by the hazardous product.\" (Source: Hazardous Products Regulations, Section 5.12 (1))\n\nThis definition means that an SDS must be updated when there is new information that changes how the hazardous product is classified, or when there are changes to the way you will handle or store or protect yourself from the hazards of the product.\n\nSDSs must to be updated within 90 days of the supplier being aware of the new information. If you purchase a product within this 90-day time period, the supplier must provide an SDS plus a document that provides the changes to the SDS that are required as a result of the significant new data, and the date on which the data became available..\n\nNote: The requirement for suppliers to update a safety data sheet every three years, as was the case under WHMIS 1988 is no longer required by the Hazardous Products Act and regulations. Currently, the SDS must be accurate at the time of every sale or importation of the hazardous product. Suppliers have an ongoing responsibility to make sure SDSs and labels are accurate and compliant.\n\nNote: The requirement for the employer to update or obtain updated SDSs in the workplace is regulated by your jurisdiction.\n\nThe SDS must be updated within 90 days when significant new information becomes available in Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec\n\nThe employer must actively seek an updated SDS every three years in Federal workplace WHMIS legislation (e.g., Canadian Occupational Health and Safety Regulations), British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon. The employer should ask the supplier for written confirmation if the SDS content has not changed or if an updated SDS is not available. If the employer is aware of significant new information data, the employer must add this data to the existing SDS.\n\nNOTE: In Nova Scotia, WHMIS 1988 requirements apply.\n\nCheck with your jurisdiction for more information.\n\nHow will I know if an SDS has been updated?\n\nBack to top\n\nEvery SDS must provide a date of last revision in Section 16 – Other Information. You will know if an SDS has been updated by checking this date, and comparing it to the one on any previous SDS you have.\n\nNote that there is no requirement for the supplier to provide an updated SDS to past purchasers of a hazardous product. However, it continues to be good practice to provide this information to purchasers who may still be using the product.\n\nAs an employer, do I have responsibilities for SDSs?\n\nBack to top\n\nYes. Employers will be required to make sure that all hazardous products (as defined by the Hazardous Products Regulations have an up-to-date SDS when it enters the workplace. The SDSs must be readily available to the workers who are exposed to the hazardous product, and to the health and safety committee or representative.\n\nEmployers may computerize the SDS information as long as:\n\nall employees have access to and are trained on how to use the computer or device,\n\nthe computers/devices are kept in working order, and\n\nthe employer makes a hard copy of the SDS available to the employee or health and safety committee/representative upon request.\n\nAs mentioned, in some circumstances, an employer may be required to prepare an SDS (e.g., when the product is produced and used in the workplace).\n\nIf the employer is aware of significant new information, the employer must add this information to the existing SDS.\n\nWhy is my SDS so hard to understand?\n\nBack to top\n\nSDSs have many different audiences including occupational hygienists and safety professionals, employers, supervisors, nurses, doctors, emergency responders, and workers. To ensure that SDS users can quickly find the information that they need, information directed toward these various users will be listed in specific sections. Having a set format will make it easier to find the information you need on every SDS. Your health and safety committee or representative, health and safety specialist, occupational health nurse or family doctor, supervisor, employer, or supplier should be able to help you understand the SDS.\n\nIs all the information I need on the SDS?\n\nBack to top\n\nNot necessarily. A lot of health hazard information, for example, is written in general terms. In addition, SDSs are often written for many different uses or applications of the product, and the handling and safety precautions may not be specific to your workplace. Your health and safety committee or representative, health and safety specialist, occupational health nurse or family doctor, supervisor, employer, or supplier should be able to help you find more information if needed.\n\nWhat does \"not available\" or \"not applicable\" mean when I see these on the SDS?\n\nBack to top\n\nWith the exception of Sections 12-15, the supplier is required to provide information on each specific information element required on the SDS. In some cases, it may be appropriate for the supplier to state “not available” or “not applicable” instead of providing the specific information.\n\n\"Not available\" means that the information could not be located or does not exist. For example, if the supplier cannot locate any studies that describe the odour, which is reported in Section 9 of the SDS, the supplier would report \"not available\".\n\n\"Not applicable\" means that the information element is not relevant. For example, if the product is odourless, then the odour would be reported as \"Not applicable\".\n\nNote that the supplier should not use the abbreviation \"n.a.\" or \"NA\" without defining it, as it could mean \"not applicable\" or \"not available\" or something entirely different.\n\nAs a worker, when would I use an SDS?\n\nBack to top\n\nAlways be familiar with the hazards of a product before you start using it. You should look at an SDS, match the name of the product on the container to the one on the SDS, know the hazards, understand safe handling and storage instructions, as well as understand what to do in an emergency.\n\nYou can think of the SDS as having four main purposes. It provides information on:\n\nIdentification: for the product and supplier.\n\nHazards: physical (fire and reactivity) and health.\n\nPrevention: steps you can take to work safely, reduce or prevent exposure, or in an emergency.\n\nResponse: appropriate responses in various situations (e.g., first-aid, fire, accidental release).\n\nFor most people who work with hazardous products, you should always:\n\nread the name of the chemical (Section 1),\n\nknow the hazards (Section 2),\n\nunderstand safe handling and storage instructions (Section 7), and\n\nunderstand what to do in an emergency (Sections 4, 5 and 6).\n\nA few things to know:\n\nMake sure that the product is being used in the way the manufacturer intended; otherwise the advice provided on the SDS and label may not apply, or the protective measures listed may not be adequate. Section 1 of the SDS should describe the typical use of the product and may indicate restrictions. Ask your supervisor or a health and safety professional for advice if the way you use the product does not match the SDS.\n\nSection 2 will summarize the hazards related to the product, precautions to take, and what to do in an emergency. Understand that the SDS covers information about the potential hazards, but may not be specific about the required safe work procedures needed for your workplace (e.g., the SDS may not specify what type of respirator must be used, just that a respirator is needed). More information can be found by asking your supervisor. These decisions may require the help of a safety professional or someone with chemical safety knowledge."
