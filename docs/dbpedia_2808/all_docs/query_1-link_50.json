        "text": "Netflix has premiered the official trailer for Kunle Afolayan’s Yoruba language series, “Anikulapo: Rise of the Specter,” a spinoff from the successful film “Anikulapo.” The four-part series is scheduled to begin streaming on March 1, 2024.\n\nThe recently released video, unveiled on Tuesday, Jan. 30, 2024, offers a sneak peek into the unfolding narrative of the epic series. “Anikulapo: Rise of the Specter” seamlessly picks up from where the movie left off, following the life journey of Saro and his wife.\n\nAkala, the enigmatic bird responsible for resurrecting Saro (Kunle Remi) in the initial installment, returns to the storyline, though its motives appear less amicable than anticipated. The series promises to delve into profound themes such as betrayal, revenge, and the relentless pursuit of ultimate power.\n\nUnder the direction of Kunle Afolayan, the stellar cast includes Adebayo Salami, Layi Wasabi, Moji Afolayan, Aisha Lawal, Ronke Oshodi, Jide Kosoko, Adeniyi Johnson, and Funky Mallam.\n\n“Anikulapo: Rise of the Specter” is a collaborative effort between KAP Motion Pictures and Golden Effects Pictures, boasting a substantial team of over 600 cast and crew members. Principal photography concluded in July 2023.\n\nThe original release of “Anikulapo” in 2022 achieved global acclaim, securing the number one spot on Netflix with an impressive 8,730,000 views in under two weeks. The film also stood out at the 2023 Africa Magic Viewers’ Choice Awards (AMVCA), clinching multiple accolades, including Best Movie in Africa, Best Writer, and Best Soundtrack."
