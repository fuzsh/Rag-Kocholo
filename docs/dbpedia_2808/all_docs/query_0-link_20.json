Set for release on 30 September 2022 it loosely follows the story of a young man’s quest for greener pastures in the ancient Oyo kingdom.\n\nKunle Remi plays the role of Saro as lead in the film chuck full of romance, intrigue and drama, which also stars Sola Sobowale, Bimbo Ademoye, Taiwo Hassan, Moji Afolayan, Ronke Ojo, Hakeem Kae Kazeem, Aisha Lawal, Adebowale Adedayo, Faithia Balogun and a host of others.\n\nSet in the 17th-century pre-colonial era of the old Oyo Empire, it is based on the story of a sojourner who finds his way to Oyo in search of greener pastures, where he finds favour and things begin to change for good. But he finds love in a forbidden place, while longing for the abominable, and eventually gets caught in the web of lust.\n\nAnikulapo is produced and directed by Kunle Afolayan as one of his slate projects with Netflix, after Swallow and A Naija Christmas collaboration with the streamer in the past year.\n\nShare this:"
