You want to use that information, but who do you cite?\n\nIf you are just paraphrasing the information, and you don't need to mention the original author, you can just cite the work you have in front of you without worrying about the original author.\n\nHowever, if you actually want to cite the original author (because you are drawing attention to the fact that they said it, or because it's a direct quote), then you would use a secondary citation.\n\nIn text, you say:\n\nSmith (as cited in Brown, 2009) noted that \"...\" (p. 6).\n\nOr\n\nIt was noted that \"...\" (Smith, as cited in Brown, 2009, p. 6).\n\nIn the reference list you only mention Brown's work (because you only reference what you actually read).\n\nRemember, you don't have to use a secondary citation for every piece of information your author got from another source - you only need to use a secondary citation if you are using Smith's exact words, or referring to her work or theories, but you have only read Brown's work (where he cited her)."
