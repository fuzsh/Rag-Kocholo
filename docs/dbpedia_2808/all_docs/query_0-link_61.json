It’s actually in Itesiwaju federal constituency, where Hon Shina Peller currently represents at the National Assembly.\n\n“I am not one who waits for the government, I do my thing and the government can come in and discuss after seeing what we have done. What we have done is very massive and we look at completing it before or by 2022,” Afolayan said.\n\nThe filmmaker also revealed that he’s working on another movie, which he plans to film in the Oyo village. He said the shooting will begin in January 2022.\n\nAfolayan’s last film, ‘The Citation,’ scooped three nominations and won one award at the 2021 Africa Movie Academy Awards."
