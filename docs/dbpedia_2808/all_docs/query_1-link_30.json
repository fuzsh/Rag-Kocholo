        "text": "Shyam Benegal<!-- -->, 89, the filmmaker who’s the director behind several <!-- -->National Award-winning<!-- --> feature films, numerous documentaries and short films, released his twenty-third feature, <!-- -->Mujib: The Making of a Nation<!-- --> in 2023. Talking to us about how he is still passionate about making films, Benegal says, “As long as I have strength in my limbs and my mind is working, I would like to make movies. I have a lot of subjects, but you see when you make a film, you are making it with somebody else’s (producer) money. So, naturally, if people still trust me at my age to make a film, I would love to do it.” Zubeidaa In his repertoire that spans 60 years, Benegal’s work has been conferred with several National Awards and the veteran filmmaker was also honoured with titles like <!-- -->Padma Shri<!-- --> and <!-- -->Padma Bhushan<!-- -->. Ask him if he’s satisfied with all the accolades he won in his career, and he says, “All these acclaims have only thrilled me. But the fact is that there are different times in your career. Ultimately, as you grow older you want to make films that satisfy you. It might not necessarily satisfy everyone else, but when it does satisfy everyone including you, then you feel blessed.” Mujib The filmmaker, known for films like Ankur, Manthan, Zubeidaa, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero among others, feels that some of his socially relevant films, couldn’t garner the kind of attention that he expected them to. He explains, “I haven’t made any films that I did not enjoy making. Those films may have collapsed and disappeared, but that didn’t make any difference to me. When I was filming them, I just loved the whole experience. I feel that most of the films I made didn’t work, but then that is how it is.” For Benegal, films have always been beyond a source of entertainment. “I cannot separate the individual stories from the sociological circumstances. If I take it out, then I would not be true to the subject. A film is not a mere poster. It is not just unidirectional, but a part of the whole historical circumstance and as a story has connections to the past, the future and the present. It’s only then that it comes to life,” he explains. !(function(f, b, e, v, n, t, s) { function loadFBEvents(isFBCampaignActive) { if (!isFBCampaignActive) { return; } (function(f, b, e, v, n, t, s) { if (f.fbq) return; n = f.fbq = function() { n.callMethod ? n.callMethod(...arguments) : n.queue.push(arguments); }; if (!f._fbq) f._fbq = n; n.push = n; n.loaded = !0; n.version = '2.0'; n.queue = []; t = b.createElement(e); t.async = !0; t.defer = !0; t.src = v; s = b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(t, s); })(f, b, e, 'https://lnkd.in/d-eUnHGy', n, t, s);\n\nReflecting back on my conversations with Ranbir Kapoor. “Mansi, I made my acting debut much later, but my career in films began as an assistant director on the 1996 film Prem Granth. In 1999, I worked as an AD to my father for his directorial debut on ‘Aa Ab Laut Chalen’, this experience drove me to pursue my formal training in acting & filmmaking in New York. Growing up I’ve been shielded from the business of cinema. Success or failure both don’t affect me extremely. Critical acclaim is fine, but unless it's watched by people & makes profit for all, it does not make sense. We don’t make movies for ourselves. We are trying to impress an entire nation of moviegoers which means we need a good wholesome, entertaining film, that's the bottomline. If a film does not run, it has not run because the audience has not connected to it & you have to take the blame for it. You can’t live in denial or a fool's paradise & pinpoint what was wrong. You have to think in retrospect, take the blame & move on & make another film & hope it does well. I am extremely grateful that I have been born in this family. Yes, I have got it easier than possibly millions who come to this industry, but I too have my struggles which may not be of the same magnitude but that does not take away my struggles. When I was in the US, I started getting a lot of film offers from really good directors & then I saw Devdas. I decided Mr Bhansali was a director I really wanted to work with. Without asking my parents, I made a resume of my work & dropped it in at his house. He asked why I wanted to assist him and not act? I convinced him that I wanted to be an AD before I essayed a role. There is no school like that of a film set, it's hands-on, seeing the legends perform, costumes, music. From the protected life I had led so far, the year working with SLB, really hardened me. I am really grateful to him for giving me so much as a film student, as an assistant & as a person. Using public transport, spending from my pocket money to go to work (may sound pseudo intellectual to say so) really showed me a different side of life & I realised the value of a lot of things. Whatever I know about films or acting, I always attribute it to Mr Bhansali. Being an AD was tough, from 5am to 4am with an hour of sleep, first to arrive, last to leave. Once, he was really pissed off with us, he made us (me k another AD) kneel down for 2-3 hours. My first steps into the world of acting happened in 2007 with Saawariya. I’ve learnt so much all these years & I’m still learning. There are so many lessons & funny moments as I look back. I still laugh when I remember I experimented with 24 wigs for the song \"Nadan Parinde\" in 2011, . My greatest motivation is my grandfather, Mr Raj Kapoor. Because of my family's contribution to cinema, blessings, being at the right place at the right time, luck, so many factors have played a role. I hope I have this all my life. It will instigate & drive me always!” #MyStory\n\nImage Source : INSTAGRAM This superstar has done more than 400 films till now!

Bollywood\n\nHow does a 19-year-old kid become the youngest film director in Hollywood history? Ignorance. Let me explain. In early 2023, a young filmmaker named Wesley Wang spends 2 years creating a short film. Eager to share his work, he sends his creation to countless film festivals. One by one, they all reject him. So he posts the 12-minute video onto YouTube as a last resort. It instantly goes viral. He then receives an email from big-time Hollywood producer — Darren Aronofsky. \"watched your film, can you drop out of Harvard?\" Wesley does not drop out of Harvard. Instead, he and Aronofsky take his viral YouTube video and pitches it to major film studios. Sony TriStar sees the potential and says yes. And just like that, Wesley becomes the youngest director in Hollywood history. But here’s the thing: Wesley Wang is not an overnight success story. He started making films at the age of 11. In fact, before this headline-making moment, Wesley fundraised for and directed 13 legitimate short films, each with full production crews. This is why I say ignorance — because Wesley kept creating, even though directing films in Hollywood wasn’t an arena high school students competed it. But Wesley shattered that boundary and embraced an unconventional path, driven by a bold, almost ignorant confidence. It's this confident ignorance common among those who dare to push boundaries, take risks, and remain resilient in the face of challenges. In the end, ignorance can sometimes be the greatest form of courage.\n\nLaapataa Ladies: A Charming Comedy with a Social Message Directed by Kiran Rao and produced by Aamir Khan, Laapataa Ladies is a heartwarming comedy film that tackles social issues in a lighthearted and entertaining way.
