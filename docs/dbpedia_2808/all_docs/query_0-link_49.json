        "text": "Eyiyemi, the daughter of Kunle Afolayan, has opened up about her intention to be a better filmmaker than her father and grandfather.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEyiyemi is also the granddaughter of Adeyemi ‘Ade Love’ Afolayan, the iconic filmmaker and dramatist.\n\nThe fast-rising actress, who played the role of Princess Omowunmi in the award-winning movie ‘Anikulapo’, spoke about her ambition in a recent interview with Channels TV.\n\nAsked if she feels overwhelmed by the film legacy that runs in her family, the 18-year-old said she is confident she can do better than her dad and granddad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress said while growing up, she observed the changes between how her dad and grandfather made their films.\n\nEyiyemi added that she intends to take advantage of “the advanced technology in a few years to come” to make better movies.\n\n“Not particularly because I look up to my dad a lot. Since I was a child he has always shown us the way. I have watched my grandpa’s movies. And I can see that there is definitely a development from the way my father used to make his movies to how my dad used to make his movies,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“And I know that in a few years to come I am going to be a very big filmmaker myself and I am going to do better by God’s grace. By then technology will be advanced.”\n\nAdeyemi, the late filmmaker, starred in several movies including ‘Taxi Driver’, ‘Ija Ominira’, and ‘Kadara’.\n\nHis children include Kunle, Aremu, Moji, and Gabriel Afolayan, all of whom are theatre practitioners.\n\nKunle, on the other hand, came to prominence when he starred in ‘Saworoide’ in 1999 as Aresejabata.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then he has produced award-winning movies like ‘Figurine’, ‘Phone Swap’, ‘October 1’, and ‘Citation’ under Kunle Afolayan Production (KAP).\n\nCopyright 2024 TheCable.
