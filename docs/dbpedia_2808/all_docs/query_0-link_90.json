        "text": "Nollywood actor and filmmaker, Kunle Afolayan is no doubt a proud father as he has taken pride in his daughter, Eyitemi.\n\nTaking to his Instagram page, he took pride in his first daughter, whom he called Princess Omowunmi from her script name in his new movie, Anikulapo Series The Rise of Spectre. He noted how though she is still a work in progress, however, he is proud of her achievements so far.\n\n“My daughter Eyitemi aka Princess Omowunmi is a work in progress but I am proud of her achievements so far”.\n\nTaking to his comment section, Eyitemi appreciated her father of her upbringing. She wrote, “Thank you for the upbringing Baba mi”.\n\nSee some reactions below,\n\nToyosi Adesanya wrote, “Thank you for the fatherly role\n\nActress Lydia Forson wrote, “Wow! I still remember meeting her as a little girl, she’s grown up so beautifully\n\nJumoke Odetola wrote, “Star\n\nAisha Lawal wrote, “Yemyem my baby\n\nOne Beeholar wrote, “Lion no dey born goat\n\nOne Ronkky Bebe wrote, “My darling Eyi yem. Greater heights darling\n\nOne Debukkie wrote, “She looks so much like Aunty Moji Afolayan. The hair, the brows, the resemblance is too much”.\n\nLast month, Kunle caused drama on the internet with his ‘inappropriate’ dance moves with his daughter, Eyiyemi, at the premiere of his long-awaited series, Anikulapo; The Rise of the Spectre.\n\nVideos from the after party of the premiere captured when Kunle Afolayan was dancing with his first daughter, who is one of the major cast in the Anikulapo series.\n\nThe dance step which is a common one among lovers grabbed the eye of netizens who lectured him for doing such with his blood. See the video here.\n\nReacting to it, Kunle Afolayan shared a video of him listening to Phyno’s song, ‘Do I’, indirectly meaning that he doesn’t care about the backlash.\n\nHe declared that he was a King and the child of the most High, so his critics can only try. In all, love surpasses everything.\n\nHis daughter, Eyiyemi Afolayan who was unbothered, re-echoed his words.\n\nKemi Filani reported last year that Kunle Afolayan had explained why he cast his daughter, Eyiyemi Afolayan, for the role of Princess Omowunmi in his release, Anikulapo.\n\nKunle Afolayan, who posted a short video clip of his daughter and himself on his verified Instagram handle, said the role required somebody beautiful and his daughter is definitely beautiful. He added that the youngster is also a good singer as well as a natural at acting.\n\nEyiyemi is Kunle Afolayan’s first child and she made her debut appearance as an actor on the set of Anikulapo."
