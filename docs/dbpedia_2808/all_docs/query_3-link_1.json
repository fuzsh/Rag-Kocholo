        "text": "According to most data privacy laws, personal information is any information that can be used to identify a person.\n\nIt can range from basic information, like a person’s name or phone number, to intricate details, including biometric data and location tags.\n\nBut the topic of personal information is complex, and there are a lot of things businesses need to know about it to protect themselves and their users.\n\nIn this guide, explore the definition of personal information with examples, how various data privacy laws govern it, and what your business can do to protect it.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat Is Personal Information — Or Personal Data?\n\nTypes and Examples of Personal Information\n\nHow Personal Information Is Defined by Data Privacy Laws\n\nHow Businesses Can Protect Personal Information\n\nHow To Encourage Users To Protect Their Personal Information\n\nPersonal Information FAQ\n\nSummary\n\nWhat Is Personal Information — Or Personal Data?\n\nPersonal information (or personal data) is defined as any information relating to a specific person, such as their name, address, IP address, etc.\n\nBusinesses need to be aware that each data privacy law has its own definition of personal information.\n\nAs a business, you may access or store personal information or personal data across social media, web applications, servers, and more.\n\nYou must handle personal information properly according to applicable laws.\n\nWhat About Personally Identifiable Information?\n\nPersonally identifiable information, or PII, was another term for personal information primarily used in the U.S., but it’s being phased out.\n\nTypes and Examples of Personal Information\n\nIt’s important to consider all types of personal information — a long list, but you can divide it into a few separate groups.\n\nSome information, like basic details, is easy to categorize.\n\nHowever, as the list progresses into new types of information, it often gets more challenging to tell if it’s personal or not.\n\nBasic Details\n\nBasic personal details include:\n\nName\n\nAddress\n\nPhone number\n\nMailing address\n\nZIP code\n\nEmail address\n\nEven without considering the digital space, most businesses want or need to collect a consumer’s basic personal details.\n\nThe above examples may or may not be personal information — it depends on how it’s collected and paired with other data.\n\nTo determine whether the information is personal, ask yourself: Can this information identify a specific person?\n\nFor example, a list of middle names alone means nothing, but those same names paired with first and last names are an example of personal information.\n\nID Numbers\n\nMany identification (ID) numbers mark people as individuals, from Social Security numbers to customer IDs.\n\nRemember, anything that identifies an individual is considered personal information.\n\nSome of the ID numbers protected by data privacy laws include:\n\nAccount numbers\n\nPassport number\n\nDriver’s license number\n\nInsurance policy number\n\nBuyer’s club number\n\nSocial Security numbers\n\nComputer and Technical Numbers\n\nIn the digital world, many numbers can identify and mark individuals, including information businesses collect and use to learn more about their consumers.\n\nSome details consumers give to companies also fit under this category, like when they create a user account.\n\nThese numbers include:\n\nIP address\n\nMAC address\n\nUsername\n\nPassword\n\nBrowsing history\n\nApple ID\n\nCookie IDs\n\nSensitive Information\n\nSensitive information is a designation sometimes used for data that requires special protection under data privacy laws.\n\nIt often includes:\n\nHealth\n\nRace\n\nPolitical views\n\nReligion\n\nSex life\n\nSexual orientation\n\nBiometrics\n\nGenetics\n\nTrade union affiliation\n\nThe legal requirements for collecting and processing sensitive information vary under different laws, so be aware of which ones apply to your business.\n\nSubjective Data\n\nMost of the information we covered is objective data, which refers to factual, provable details about a person.\n\nSubjective data, on the other hand, refers to someone’s opinions, thoughts, or beliefs and can fall under the protection of data privacy laws, usually as sensitive personal information.\n\nExamples of subjective data can include:\n\nNotes taken during a meeting\n\nComplaint logs\n\nPolitical, philosophical, and religious beliefs\n\nPersonal opinions or feelings\n\nOther Types of Personal Information\n\nThese lists are not fully inclusive of all types of identifiable information, as data privacy laws leave room in their definitions to account for new or developing data types.\n\nSome other possible personal information includes:\n\nLocation-based information\n\nVoice commands\n\nInfo from connected devices\n\nHealth information\n\nEducation\n\nCriminal or court history\n\nEmployment records\n\nCredit reports\n\nWhat Is Not Personal Information?\n\nUnder most data privacy laws, publicly available data is not considered personal information — the GDPR is an exception, which doesn’t differentiate between public and personal data.\n\nPublicly available data includes anything reasonably believed to have been made available to the public from government records or widely distributed media, often including social media.\n\nData must also be tied or linkable to a person to be considered personal information.\n\nFor example, a phone number alone is not personal information, but the minute context is added, like the person’s name, it becomes personal information.\n\nAs another example, an email address needs to be personal to be considered personal information. If you contact Termly at the basic email — [email protected] — that is not personal info. However, if you email someone individually at the company, it is.\n\nHow Personal Information Is Defined by Data Privacy Laws\n\nThere are many examples of personal information listed above, but you must know what specific laws govern your business and how they define personal information.\n\nThe table below gives a brief overview of some legal definitions of the term, and later, we’ll explain them in more detail.\n\nLaw or Regulation Region Definition of Personal Information Australian Privacy Principles (Privacy Act 1988) Australia Any information that can (or reasonably could) identify a living individual. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) California Any information, within reason, that is linked with a distinguishable person or household. California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) California Added sensitive information to CCPA’s personal information. California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) California Specific list of data types (see below). Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) Virginia Information linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person. Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) Colorado Any information, within reason, that is linked with a distinguishable person. Does not include de-identified data. Connecticut Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring Act (CTDPA) Connecticut any information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable individual. Does not include de-identified or publicly available information. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) European Union Information that can lead to the identification of a person — i.e., credit card number, email address, name, etc. Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) Canada Information about an identifiable individual.\n\nUS Federal Definition of Personal Information\n\nThe United States does not yet have a federal privacy law that covers the entire country — and a possible national US privacy bill is currently inactive in Congress.\n\nBut several states have enacted or passed state-level privacy laws.\n\nOtherwise, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has the power to protect American consumers but doesn’t have a single definition of personal information they use.\n\nThat said, the following US federal laws do protect certain areas of personal information:\n\nChildren’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA): Personal information collected from or about minors\n\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA): Personal health information\n\nGramm Leach Bliley Act (GLBA): Personal banking information\n\nFair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA): Personal credit information\n\nGDPR Definition of Personal Information\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the world’s first major privacy law and protects EU residents’ data, providing a legal model for other countries to follow.\n\nIt has a strict definition of personal data, including information that can identify someone, some pseudonymized information, and some cookie identifiers.\n\nYou can read the full definition according to the GDPR here:\n\nAny information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.\n\nThe GDPR also adds “special categories” for sensitive information, which are subject to stricter requirements if you want to collect and process it.\n\nSpecial categories of sensitive data include:\n\nRace and ethnic origin\n\nReligious or philosophical beliefs\n\nPolitical opinions\n\nTrade union memberships\n\nBiometric data used to identify an individual\n\nGenetic data\n\nHealth data\n\nData related to sexual preferences, sex life, and/or sexual orientation\n\nCCPA Definition of Personal Information\n\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) applies to anyone who services residents of California and meets certain thresholds.\n\nIt defines personal information as:\n\nInformation that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.\n\nThe CCPA’s definition of personal information expands protections to individuals and households.\n\nHowever, some details aren’t personal under this law when made publicly available, such as:\n\nInformation from government records\n\nProfessional licenses\n\nReal estate and property records\n\nCPRA Definition of Personal Information\n\nThe California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) amended the CCPA and added a category of sensitive information that requires greater protection.\n\nThe CPRA defines sensitive information as:\n\nSocial security number, driver’s license/ID card, passport number\n\nGeolocation\n\nRace/ethnicity, religion, philosophies, union membership\n\nFinancial account numbers, access codes, passwords, and more\n\nContents of message\n\nGenetic data\n\nCalOPPA Definition of Personal Information\n\nThe California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) was an early California law protecting private data and is where the outdated term PII was originally used.\n\nCalOPPA listed the following specific data as personal information:\n\nFirst and last name\n\nAddress\n\nEmail address\n\nAny other information that permits a specific individual to be contacted physically or online\n\nBirthdate\n\nHeight, weight, hair color\n\nPhone number\n\nSocial security number\n\nAny other identifying contact details\n\nCookies, or any other information a website collects about its users when it is used in a way that can identify a person\n\nToday, the CCPA with the CPRA amendments supersede CalOPPA’s definition, but the law provides a good core list of things courts will most likely consider personal information.\n\nHowever, they’re likely to include other types of data as personal as well.\n\nVirginia CDPA Definition of Personal Information\n\nThe Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) definition of personal data is:\n\nAny information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person.\n\nThere is a category of sensitive information protected by this law.\n\nAdditionally, personal data does not include “de-identified data or publicly available information,” but the law does not provide any examples.\n\nColorado CPA Definition of Personal Information\n\nUnder Colorado’s Consumer Privacy Act, personal data means:\n\n(a) information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable individual, and (b) does not include de-identified data or publicly available information.”\n\nIt also describes a category of sensitive data but excludes public data and information kept for employment records.\n\nCTDPA Definition of Personal Information\n\nConnecticut’s data privacy law, the CTDPA, defines personal information as any information linked or linkable to an identifiable individual.\n\nIt describes a category of sensitive personal information subject to stricter requirements, but the definition excludes publicly available and de-identified data.\n\nHow Other US State Laws Define Personal Information\n\nSeveral other U.S. states have passed data privacy laws that will enter into force over the next few years.\n\nIn the table below, you can see how those state laws define personal information.\n\nU.S. State Data Privacy Law Definition of Personal Information Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act (DPDPA) Any information that’s linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable individual, excluding de-identified data and publicly available information. Florida Data Privacy Bill of Rights (FDBR) Any information, including sensitive data, which is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable individual, including pseudonymous data when the data is used by a controller or processor in conjunction with additional information that reasonably links the data to an identified or identifiable individual. The term does not include de-identified data or publicly available information. Indiana Consumer Data Protection Act (Indiana CDPA) Information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable individual, excluding de-identified data, aggregate data, and publicly available information. Iowa Consumer Data Protection Act (Iowa CDPA) Any information linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person, excluding de-identified and aggregate data and publicly available information. Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MCDPA) Any information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable individual, excluding de-identified data and publicly available information. Oregon Data Privacy Act (ODPA) Data, derived data or a unique identifier that is linked to or is reasonably linkable to a consumer or to a device that identifies, is linked to or is reasonably linkable to one or more consumers. Tennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA) Information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person; and does not include information that is publicly available information or de-identified or aggregated consumer information. Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA) Any information, including sensitive data, that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable individual, including pseudonymous data when the data is used by a controller or processor in conjunction with additional information that reasonably links the data to an identified or identifiable individual.

Cookies count as personal data and sometimes collect more information than you really need for functionality.\n\nLimit the Data You Keep\n\nData privacy laws require you to only keep data necessary for specific purposes and for as long as it takes to achieve that purpose, so limit how much you store.\n\nBy maintaining smaller amounts of data, there are fewer chances of a privacy breach occurring, which is an additional benefit.\n\nBeef up Your Security\n\nOne large risk to your customers is a data breach exposing the information you keep, which can include private and sensitive information like income level and credit card numbers.\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from a breach is to make sure you are using state-of-the-art security and following modern security practices.\n\nAccess Control\n\nAccess control limits who on your team can access the data you collect, which helps minimize unauthorized data breaches caused by personal or user error.\n\nThe fewer employees who have access to or use the data you collect, the fewer weak points you have.\n\nFair Information Practices\n\nBusinesses seeking instruction and direction about how to best protect the privacy of their customers should consider implementing the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs).\n\nThese eight principles create goals for data usage and privacy:\n\nEncrypted or Pseudonymous Data\n\nTo help protect user personal data, consider encrypting the data so others cannot read it and changing the information so it can no longer identify a particular person.\n\nExamples of data like this include:\n\nInformation with personal identifiers replaced with dummy variables\n\nInformation sent through encryption processes\n\nInformation changed to be unidentifiable\n\nHow To Encourage Users To Protect Their Personal Information\n\nHere are some tips for how you can encourage your users to protect their own personal information and develop good habits.\n\nEncourage Strong Passwords\n\nA strong, complex password is less likely to be breached.\n\nIf you use passwords on your site, require users to use a combination of letters, numbers, and special symbols.\n\nOffer Two-Factor Identification\n\nIt’s a good idea to encourage your customers to use two-factor identification.\n\nTwo-factor identification backs up passwords with permission from email, text, or an online program, acting like a second lock on personal data and limiting access.\n\nLet Them Choose Not To Share Info\n\nUnder many data privacy laws, like the CCPA and GDPR, users have the right to object to certain types of data collection, so it’s important to give them this option.\n\nCreate a Cookies Preference Center\n\nSome cookies are necessary to keep websites running smoothly, but others are completely unnecessary and often collect personal information.\n\nSo, create a cookie preference center and allow your users to block, accept, and customize the cookies your site uses.\n\nEncourage Them to Read Your Policies\n\nEncourage users to read your terms and conditions, privacy policy, cookie policy, and any other legal policy you have.\n\nYou can do this by placing links to them in prominent areas and asking them to take an action to express agreement (like selecting an unmarked checkbox).\n\nPersonal Information FAQ\n\nHere are some of the most commonly asked questions about personal information.\n\nSummary\n\nBusinesses keep personal information because it allows them to better sell to their clients and serve their needs.\n\nWhen a business uses this data, they must tell their customers how they use it and follow all applicable data privacy laws.\n\nSome personal information you might collect includes things people consider private, like health data, credit card numbers, full names, and passwords.\n\nEnsure you’re transparent about how your business uses personal information and are in compliance with the appropriate data privacy laws."
