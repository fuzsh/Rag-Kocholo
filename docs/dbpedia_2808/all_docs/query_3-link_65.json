        "text": "Download the print version from Trove\n\nThis guide replaces two pieces of guidance released in 2014 — Privacy business resource 4: De-identification of data and information and Information policy agency resource 1: De-identification of data and information.\n\nKey points\n\nDe-identification is a privacy-enhancing tool. When done well, it can help your entity meet its obligations under the Privacy Act and build trust in your data governance practices.\n\nInformation that has undergone an appropriate and robust de-identification process is not personal information, and is therefore not subject to the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). Whether information is personal or de-identified will depend on the context. Information will be de-identified where the risk of an individual being re-identified in the data is very low in the relevant release context (or data access environment).[1] Put another way, information will be de-identified where there is no reasonable likelihood of re-identification occurring.\n\nDe-identification involves two steps. The first is the removal of direct identifiers. The second is taking one or both of the following additional steps:\n\nthe removal or alteration of other information that could potentially be used to re-identify an individual, and/or\n\nthe use of controls and safeguards in the data access environment to prevent re-identification.\n\nThis guide provides high-level guidance only. The OAIC recommends that entities also refer to the De-Identification Decision-Making Framework, produced jointly by the OAIC and CSIRO-Data61, which provides a comprehensive framework for approaching de-identification in accordance with the Privacy Act.\n\nThe OAIC recommends that entities seek specialist expertise for more complex de-identification matters - for example when de-identifying rich or detailed datasets, where data may be shared publicly or with a wide audience, or where de-identification is carried out in the context of a multi-entity data sharing arrangement.[2]\n\nOverview\n\nMany entities[3] collect and retain information or data that includes personal information.[4] In doing so they must comply with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). The APPs regulate how entities collect, use, disclose and store personal information. In particular, APP 6 places limits on the use and disclosure (sharing or releasing) of personal information. However, where information has been appropriately de-identified, it is no longer personal information and can therefore be used or shared in ways that may not otherwise be permitted under the Privacy Act.\n\nThis resource provides general advice about de-identification, to assist APP entities to protect privacy when using or sharing information containing personal information. Guidance is provided on when de-identification may be appropriate, how to choose appropriate de-identification techniques, and how to assess the risk of re-identification. It is consistent with the approach taken in the De-Identification Decision-Making Framework.\n\nThe fundamental premise underpinning this guidance is that re-identification risk must be assessed contextually. To de-identify effectively, entities must consider not only the data itself, but also the environment the data will be released into. Both factors must be considered in order to effectively determine which techniques and controls are necessary to de-identify the data, while ensuring it remains appropriate for its intended use.\n\nImportantly, entities should be aware that it is not always possible to draw a bright line between personal and de‐identified information. De-identification is a risk management exercise, not an exact science. However, in all cases, for data to be considered ‘de-identified’, the risk of re-identification in the data access environment must be very low (no reasonable likelihood of re-identification).\n\nTo achieve this, data custodians need to balance data utility and the level of data modification required to achieve de-identification, while considering the most appropriate data access environment to facilitate this. For example, sharing data completely publicly or openly may necessitate significant alterations to the data itself, but lower data utility considerably. By contrast, a data access environment which enables a controlled release of data in a secure setting may provide greater protection, but it also places restrictions on who can access the data and how.\n\nA note on terminology\n\nSometimes de-identification is used to refer to the removal of ‘direct identifiers’, such as name and address. In this guide, de-identification is used in a broader sense consistently with the meaning defined in the Privacy Act. It is therefore important to be aware that the removal of name, address or other direct identifiers alone may not result in de-identification for the purposes of the Privacy Act.\n\nA number of different terms are used in Australia to describe processes similar to de-identification, for example ‘anonymisation’ and ‘confidentialisation’. In particular, ‘confidentialisation’ is used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).[5] Given the sometimes differing uses of terminology, it is important to check in any given scenario that the terminology being used is understood consistently by all parties.\n\nWhy de-identify?\n\nThis section briefly outlines the situations in which an entity may want or need to de-identify personal information, including under APP 11. There are a range of scenarios in which this might be necessary or desirable:\n\nwhen required by the APPs\n\nwhen an entity wants to share data or information, but this would not be permitted under the APPs\n\nfor other risk-management purposes, or\n\nto build trust and meet community expectations around the handling of data.\n\nIt is important to remember that de-identification cannot eliminate all of the possible risks associated with a particular use of data. However, the OAIC encourages all entities to take a holistic approach to ensuring that their data use is reasonable and appropriate, compliant with the Privacy Act and considers ethical and social responsibilities.\n\nWhen required by the APPs\n\nThe APPs require the de-identification of personal information in specified circumstances. For example, if an APP entity no longer needs personal information for any purpose for which it was collected, or any purpose for which it may be used or disclosed, the entity must take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify the information (APP 11.2).\n\nOther APPs that refer to de-identification are APP 4.3 (unsolicited personal information) and APP 6.4 (disclosure of personal information). See also APP 13.1 on correction of personal information. Further information about the APPs is available in the OAIC’s Australian Privacy Principle Guidelines.\n\nNote: The obligation to destroy or de-identify information that is no longer needed does not apply if the personal information is contained in a Commonwealth record.[6]\n\nTo enable the sharing or release of information\n\nDe-identification may allow an entity to share or release information in a way that would not otherwise be permitted under the APPs. For example:\n\nan agency holds sensitive information, which can only be used for a particular, specified purpose. However, another part of the agency wants to access that data and use it for an unrelated research or policy purpose. De-identification would allow that data to be shared for this secondary purpose\n\na medical research team creates a dataset about participants in a study. The dataset includes participant address information that could be used to identify or contact them. If the researchers want to share information from that dataset with researchers in another entity, the dataset should undergo a de-identification process prior to sharing.[7]\n\na government agency wants to make data available for use by researchers and others outside that agency, to:\n\nenable better public participation in government processes\n\ninform policy and program development and design, or\n\ndrive innovation and economic growth by creating new opportunities for commercial enterprise.\n\nThe agency could achieve this by providing a de-identified version of the dataset via a secure access mechanism. This is discussed further below.\n\nThe process of de-identifying personal information can be considered a ‘normal business practice’ for the purposes of an entity’s obligations under the Privacy Act,[8] and in particular APPs 3 and 6.[9]\n\nNote: Australian Government agencies that undertake a de-identification process should be aware that they may need to retain an original, unaltered copy of the record, to comply with record-keeping obligations under other legislation.[10]\n\nOther risk management purposes\n\nThere may be other circumstances in which de-identification is desirable to manage risk. For example:\n\nWhere particular sections of an entity do not require access to all the information, but could make use of a de-identified version. For example, a real estate agency holds the personal information of clients, and wants to provide access to the database to agents in the firm so they can prepare a media release about recent property sales prices. The team requires access to information from the database, but not necessarily to information about the identity of individual clients. Consequently, the team could use a de-identified version of the database.\n\nWhere de-identification would help protect information or data that an entity wants to keep confidential, such as sensitive business information.\n\nWhere the entity wants to lessen the risk that personal information will be compromised when information is exposed to unauthorised access, use or distribution (or a data breach) — for example, where:\n\nan intruder gains unauthorised access to information\n\nan employee internally accesses information without authorisation, or\n\ndata or an information storage device is lost or stolen.[11]\n\nNote: The Privacy Act also requires de-identification of certain types of information in some circumstances (namely tax file number information, credit information, and health information). Other legislative schemes may also require de-identification in some circumstances. For example, under the Consumer Data Right (CDR) system, accredited data recipients have specific de-identification obligations. These requirements are addressed briefly at the end of this guidance.\n\nBuild trust and meet community expectations\n\nDe-identification can also be valuable for promoting trust and meeting community expectations around data handling practices. Even if there is no specific legal requirement to do so, using appropriate de-identification techniques may alleviate public concerns about the handling of personal information. For example, the public may be concerned about potential privacy harms such as security risks, but also social or ethical harms such as discrimination, profiling or denial of a benefit or service.[12]\n\nWhen is information ‘de-identified’ for the purposes of the Privacy Act?\n\nPersonal information is information which is ‘about an identifiable individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable’.[13] ‘De-identified’ information is therefore information which has undergone a process of de-identification, and no longer falls within this definition.\n\nWhen considering the meaning of de-identification, it may be useful to review the elements of the definition of personal information. For more information on this, see What is Personal Information?\n\nWhen is a data subject ‘reasonably identifiable’?\n\nThis is the key question that determines whether information is subject to the Privacy Act. There is no exact formula for assessing when information will be reasonably identifiable, and it can sometimes be difficult to draw a bright line between de-identified information and personal information. Whether information is about a ‘reasonably’ identifiable individual requires a contextual consideration of the particular circumstances of the case, including:\n\nthe nature and amount of information\n\nwho will hold and have access to the information\n\nthe other information that is available to the person or people who will have access to the information, and\n\nthe practicability of using that information to identify an individual.\n\nImportantly, as part of considering the nature and amount of information, entities should consider what motivations there may be to attempt re-identification.\n\nThe inclusion of the term ‘reasonably’ in this phrase means that where it is possible to identify an individual, the next consideration is whether, objectively speaking, it is reasonable to expect that the subject of the information can or will be identified (having regard to the above factors). Even though it may be technically possible to identify an individual from information, if doing so is so impractical that there is almost no likelihood of it occurring, the information will not generally be regarded as personal information. There must be a reasonable likelihood that re-identification could occur for an individual to be reasonably identifiable.\n\nTherefore, an individual will be reasonably identifiable (or, a de‐identification process will not have been successful) where:\n\nit is technically possible for re‐identification to occur (whether from the information itself, or in combination with other information that may be available in the data access environment), and\n\nthere is a reasonable likelihood of re‐identification occurring.\n\nThe Privacy Act does not require de‐identification to remove the risk of re-identification entirely. Rather, those sharing or releasing data must mitigate the risk until it is very low. That is, until there is no reasonable likelihood of re‐identification occurring. As part of this, the entity should consider all relevant risks that may impact on the likelihood of re-identification, including the risk of attribute disclosure,[14] and the risk of spontaneous recognition.[15] Entities should also consider the gravity of any harm that could arise from re-identification.[16]\n\nWhat does a de-identification process involve?\n\nDe-identification is a process which involves the removal or alteration of personal identifiers, followed by the application of any additional techniques or controls required to remove, obscure, aggregate, alter and/or protect data in some way so that it is no longer about an identifiable (or reasonably identifiable) individual.[17]\n\nIn line with this, a de-identification process generally includes two steps. The first is the removal of direct identifiers, such as an individual’s name, address or other directly identifying information. The second is taking one or both of the following additional steps:\n\nremoving or altering other information that may allow an individual to be identified (for example, because of a rare characteristic of the individual or a combination of unique or remarkable characteristics that enable identification), and/or\n\nputting controls and safeguards in place in the data access environment, which will appropriately manage the risk of re-identification.\n\nBalancing data utility with the level of data modification required (and the choice of data access environment)\n\nIn determining the de-identification techniques that should be used to allow access to data, entities should consider all relevant contextual factors, including:\n\nthe kind of information or data that is to be de-identified\n\nwho will have access to the information, and what purpose this is expected to achieve\n\nwhether the information contains unique or uncommon characteristics (quasi-identifiers) that could enable re-identification\n\nwhether the information or data will be targeted for re-identification because of who or what it relates to\n\nwhether there is other information or data available that could be matched up or used to re-identify the de-identified data, and\n\nwhat harm may result if the information or data is re-identified.\n\nChoosing appropriate techniques and an appropriate data access environment requires custodians to balance data utility and the level of data modification required to achieve de-identification, while considering the most appropriate data access environment which can facilitate this. There is sometimes an unavoidable trade-off here. Sharing data with a wider audience, (or indeed, completely openly), may require significant alterations to the data itself, which may significantly lower data utility.\n\nIn some cases the application of data modification techniques may reduce the data’s utility. Nevertheless, this may be necessary in the choice of data access environment to minimise the risk of disclosing personal or confidential information. However, entities should note that the use of controls and safeguards in the data access environment, such as restrictions on who can access the information and specific physical/IT measures, , may allow the utility of data to be better preserved, compared with the use of data modification techniques.\n\nImportantly, entities should be aware that if information is made publically available, control is effectively lost over that dataset. In future, new and more detailed data may become available that could be matched with this data leading to potential re-identification. Further technological advances will also be made, which could in turn increase the likelihood that information could be re-identified. Therefore, the future risk of re-identification must also be assessed as part of deciding on an appropriate mechanism for the sharing or releasing of data.\n\nFor these reasons, open data environments are generally only appropriate for information that is either not derived from personal information, or information that has been through an extremely robust de-identification process (inevitably focussed on data treatment) that ensures - with a very high degree of confidence - that no individuals are reasonably identifiable.[18]\n\nFor further information on identification risk factors and methods for assessing identification risks, see the CSIRO Data61/OAIC resource The De-Identification Decision-Making Framework.\n\nChoice of de-identification techniques\n\nThere is no one ‘right’ way to de-identify data. De-identification techniques should be carefully chosen, based on a risk assessment, to ensure that personal information is protected and that the information will still be useful for its intended purpose after the de-identification process.\n\nAs outlined above, removing or modifying personal identifiers such as a person’s name and address is an essential component of de-identification. Other de-identification techniques that may be considered include further modifying the data itself, and/or applying appropriate controls and safeguards in the data access environment (note that there can be some overlap between the two).\n\nThe following examples are provided merely by way of illustration to demonstrate the two broad categories of techniques that may be used. Which specific techniques should be used, and in what combination, is a question that depends on the context of the data share or release, and may require advice from an expert (especially where data will be shared with a wide audience or publicly).\n\nThis guide is not intended to provide specialist advice on technical matters or de-identification standards, such as ‘k-anonymity’ or ‘differential privacy’. The following techniques are given as illustrative examples only. For more information, see the De-Identification Decision-Making Framework.\n\nData modification or data reduction techniques\n\nExamples of such techniques include:\n\nSampling — providing access to only a fraction of the total existing records or data, thereby creating uncertainty that any particular person is even included in the dataset.\n\nChoice of variables — removing quasi-identifiers (for example, significant dates, profession, income) that are unique to an individual, or which in combination with other information are reasonably likely to identify an individual.\n\nRounding — combining information or data that is likely to enable identification of an individual into categories. For example, age may be combined and expressed in ranges (25-35 years) rather than single years (27, 28). Extreme values above an upper limit or below a lower limit may be placed in an open-ended range such as an age value of ‘less than 15 years’ or ‘more than 80 years’.\n\nPerturbation — altering information that is likely to enable the identification of an individual in a small way, such that the aggregate information or data is not significantly affected — a ‘tolerable error’ — but the original values cannot be known with certainty.\n\nSwapping — swapping information that is likely to enable the identification of an individual for one person with the information for another person with similar characteristics to hide the uniqueness of some information. For example, a person from a particular town in Australia may speak a language that is unique in that town. Information about that individual’s spoken language could be swapped with the spoken language information for another individual with otherwise similar characteristics (based on age, gender, income or other characteristics as appropriate) in an area where the language is more commonly spoken.\n\nManufacturing synthetic data — creating new values generated from original data so that the overall totals, values and patterns are preserved, but do not relate to any particular individual.[19] For example, a synthetic dataset could be used to test a program that detects fraud. The synthetic data could be built to enable a test environment that replicates patterns from an authentic dataset of normal use and fraud but does not allow individuals from the original data to be identified. This allows systems to be tested with data in a realistic way, but poses less risk of re-identification.\n\nEncryption or ‘hashing’ of identifiers — techniques that will obscure the original identifier, rather than remove it altogether, usually for the purposes of linking different datasets together (but without sharing the information in an identified form).\n\nApplying controls and safeguards in the data access environment\n\nThese controls go to the ‘who’, ‘what’, ‘where’ and ‘how’ questions regarding access to data. These controls can be more effective at reducing the risk of re-identification than modifying the data itself, and better preserve the utility or richness of the data.\n\nExamples of controls and safeguards which can help to manage and minimise the risk of re-identification include:\n\nLimiting access to information, for example, allowing other organisations or researchers to view the data rather than providing a copy\n\nAllowing access via a secure mechanism or controlled environment, such as a data lab\n\nEnabling an analysis of data rather than providing access to it, for example, running an analysis of the data and providing the result rather than the raw data\n\nRequiring the data or information receiver to sign a contract limiting the use and distribution of the information or data, and enforcing the terms of that contract. For example, the contract could include an assurance that the receiver will not attempt to re-identify the information (and will destroy any information re-identified unintentionally, and notify the data owner, etc)\n\nFurther detailed advice and examples of different de-identification techniques are discussed in the De-Identification Decision-Making Framework.[20]\n\nConfirming that de-identification techniques are appropriate\n\nBefore sharing or releasing de-identified information, you should confirm whether the de-identification techniques chosen are appropriate to manage the risk of re-identification.\n\nEntities may need to engage an expert to undertake a statistical or scientific assessment of the information to ensure the risk of re-identification is very low in the data access environment. There are a number of ways to assess disclosure risk, including Data Analytical Risk Assessment and Penetration testing.\n\nRegardless of the method chosen to assess disclosure risk, whether the risk of re-identification has been reduced to an acceptably low level is a highly contextual question. Relevant factors to consider when determining whether information has been de-identified effectively could include the difficulty, cost, practicality and likelihood of re-identification. The De-Identification Decision-Making Framework sets out a framework for assessing and managing the risk of re-identification with reference to a specific data environment.\n\nAs a minimum, an entity must apply the ‘motivated intruder’ test - this test considers whether a reasonably competent, motivated person with no specialist skills (who would have access to the data) would be able to identify the data or information (the specific motivation of the intruder is not relevant). It assumes that the motivated intruder would have access to resources such as the internet and all public documents, and would make reasonable enquiries to gain more information.[21]\n\nDepending on the context, in addition it may be appropriate to consider re-identification ‘in the round’. That is, assessing whether any entity or member of the public (including experts and people with specific knowledge or a high level of skills) could identify any individual from the data or information being disclosed, either on its own or in combination with other available information or data.[22] Conducting this sort of assessment will require specialist expertise, and if an entity does not have this capability in-house, external assistance should be sought.\n\nAs publically released data can be accessed by anyone in the world (including experts and people with specific knowledge or a high level of skill), entities must consider the risk of re-identification ‘in the round’ when considering whether data has been de-identified effectively for public release.\n\nConsiderations after data sharing or release has occurred\n\nDe-identified information may still carry some risk of re-identification, particularly where it could be matched with other information which becomes available in future.[23] The risk of re-identification may therefore shift as technologies develop and a greater amount of information is published or obtained by an entity.\n\nAs a result, entities should regularly re-assess the risk of re-identification and, if necessary, take further steps to minimise the risk. This may include:\n\nassessing whether a higher level of de-identification is required for information, and\n\nassessing whether the release of further de-identified information (or technological changes) could potentially facilitate re-identification of already-published information.\n\nAs changes could occur in future (regarding technology or data availability), this is one of the main reasons why open data environments are generally only appropriate for information that is either not derived from personal information, or data that has been through an extremely robust de-identification process.\n\nRemember: a ‘de-identified’ status may be context-dependent\n\nIt is important to remember that de-identification is not a fixed or end-state. The same information may be personal information in one situation, but de-identified information in another. To use a very simple example to illustrate this point, a person’s licence number (in and of itself, and in the absence of any other information) may not be personal information when in the hands of a random member of the public, for example a school teacher. However, the same number is likely to be personal information if held by an employee of the relevant motor vehicle registry, or any other person who has access to a relevant database and can look up the number and see other identifying details associated with the licence number.\n\nThe same is true for data which has undergone a de-identification process. Imagine an entity has undertaken a de-identification process, but they still retain a copy of the original dataset. This may enable them to re-identify the data subjects in the de-identified dataset if they wished to do so. So, the dataset may be personal information when handled by that custodian, but may be de-identified when handled by a different entity, since the data access environment is different.\n\nFurther, information may be de-identified for some parts of an entity, but remain personal information for others. Imagine that an entity decides to undertake a de-identification process on a dataset, to enable in-house research to be conducted on that data (in ways that may not otherwise be permitted if the data was subject to the Privacy Act). As for the above scenario, the custodian undertaking the de-identification will likely retain a copy of the original dataset which would enable them to re-identify the data subjects in the de-identified dataset if they wished to do so. If the custodian wants to ensure that this particular use of the dataset is de-identified and therefore outside the scope of the Privacy Act, additional techniques or controls would need to be put in place (see discussion above).\n\nDo privacy obligations still apply to de-identified data?\n\nThe above discussion demonstrates that de-identified information can still carry certain privacy risks, if it is still possible for re-identification to occur. For example, such information may still carry privacy risks where the de-identification techniques used involved the use of controls applied in the data access environment (which, if removed, could increase the likelihood of re-identification). This can sometimes be difficult to conceptualise, so an example is helpful.\n\nImagine that an entity has de-identified information for internal use, in part through the application of controls and safeguards in the data access environment. However, if that information is then subject to a data breach, for example through inadvertent publication on the entity’s website, in this open access data environment the information could become personal information again (for example, because it could be matched with other data sources). The APPs would then apply to this information, and this event could therefore amount to a breach of APP 11 (depending on the entity’s security practices). By way of another example, if the entity disclosed the information to another entity without properly de-identifying it for that data access environment, this could amount to a breach of APP 6 (and/or APP 8, if the disclosure was to an overseas entity).\n\nHow should an entity manage such a risk, while still using de-identified data in the ways that it is legally permitted to use it? The OAIC recommends that entities take a risk-management approach when handling de-identified data which acknowledges that while the APPs may not apply to data that is de-identified in one specific context, the same data could become personal information in a different context.\n\nSome APPs therefore continue to be relevant to the handling of de-identified information, specifically, APPs 6, 8 and 11, as these are the APPs which may apply if the data was to be transferred to another environment. These APPs therefore remain relevant to the handling of de-identified information - not as a matter of law (at that time), but as a matter of risk management (because if the information was to be transferred to another environment, re-identification may become possible and the APPs may therefore apply again).\n\nEntities should therefore handle de-identified data in a way that would prevent any breaches of the APPs occurring. While this requires some extra thought and planning, it should not prevent the entity from using de-identified information to achieve its organisational goals.\n\nAPP 6 — Use and disclosure\n\nAPP 6 states that personal information can be used or disclosed (shared/released)only for the same purpose for which it was obtained, unless an exception applies.\n\nAPP 6 will not generally be relevant in relation to uses of de-identified information, provided that the de-identified status of the data doesn’t change in the context where the use takes place. This will usually be the case where the information is confined within the context of the original entity. After all, the whole point of the de-identification process may have been to enable different uses of the data in-house.\n\nHowever, APP 6 will remain relevant in relation to the sharing or release of information, if the status of the information would change to being personal information in the hands of another entity.[24]\n\nAPP 8 — Overseas transfers\n\nAPP 8 prevents the sharing or release of personal information with an entity outside Australia unless certain steps have first been taken.\n\nAPP 8 may remain relevant to de-identified data, because it applies to situations where data is shared or released to an overseas entity (if the de-identified status of the information may change when released out of the entity’s control).\n\nAPP 11 — Security\n\nAPP 11 states that entities must take reasonable steps to protect personal information from ‘misuse, interference and loss’, and ‘unauthorised access, modification or disclosure’. APP 11 is probably the most important APP to keep in mind when handling de-identified data, and the data breach example given above illustrates this point. As for all valuable data, de-identified data should, as a matter of risk management, be protected and stored securely to prevent unauthorised access. This is particularly so in light of the obligations which now apply to entities as a result of the commencement of the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2016 (Cth).[25]\n\nEntities need robust de-identification governance processes in place\n\nThe above information has highlighted that de-identification can be complex, with a range of factors to consider at each point in the process. To ensure effective de-identification practices, entities should be mindful of their general responsibilities under APP 1.2.[26]\n\nAPP 1.2 states that entities must take reasonable steps to implement practices, procedure and systems that will ensure compliance with the APPs. Having a strong data governance framework in place will help to ensure that de-identification is carried out effectively and in particular, will help to ensure that no breaches of APP 6 or APP 11 will occur when undertaking de-identification (or through the subsequent use of data that has undergone such a process).\n\nGood data governance procedures should apply at all stages of the process. Procedures should be in place for both before and after de-identification has occurred, as well as during. Even after a de-identified data set has been shared or released, as outlined above the entity’s responsibilities in relation to that data may continue in some circumstances.\n\nRobust de-identification governance practices may include activities such as:\n\nongoing and regular re-identification risk assessments (to check that methods used are still effective and appropriate at managing the risks involved)\n\nauditing data recipients to ensure that they are complying with the conditions of any data sharing agreements\n\nconsidering new information that becomes available, and whether any such information increases re-identification risk in a particular data access environment\n\nbuilding and ensuring ongoing transparency around the entity’s de-identification practices\n\nensuring that your entity knows who is accountable for de-identification internally\n\nputting in place a plan to deal with any re-identification attacks or events (this could be part of your entity’s broader data breach response plan)\n\nensuring that in-house staff who undertake de-identification have adequate and up-to-date training, and/or ensuring appropriate external expertise is sought where appropriate.\n\nDe-identification in specific contexts\n\nTax file numbers\n\nEntities should also be aware of the obligation imposed by the Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015 issued under s 17 of the Privacy Act. The Guidelines require an entity to take reasonable steps to securely destroy or permanently de-identify tax file number information that is no longer required by law to be retained, or is no longer necessary for a purpose under taxation law, personal assistance law or superannuation law.[27]\n\nCredit Related Research Rule\n\nDe-identification obligations for credit reporting bodies and credit providers also apply in relation to credit-related personal information.[28] Credit reporting bodies must also comply with s 20M of the Privacy Act, which prevents the use and disclosure of de-identified credit reporting information except when that use and disclosure is for the purpose of conducting research in accordance with the Privacy (Credit Related Research) Rule 2014.\n\nHealth information for research for public health or safety purposes\n\nEntities cannot collect health information about individuals for one of the research or public health or safety purposes permitted under s 16B(2) of the Privacy Act if de-identified information would serve the same purpose (s 16B(2)(b)). If de-identified information would not serve the same purpose (and if other conditions imposed in s 16B(2) have been met) the entity can only collect the information in accordance with guidelines approved by the Information Commissioner under s 95A about use of health information for research or public health or safety purposes.\n\nConsumer Data Right\n\nUnder the CDR system, accredited data recipients have obligations to de-identify CDR data in certain situations. For example, accredited data recipients must delete or de-identify any data they no longer need. The CDR Rules also set out specific requirements that must be followed when de-identifying CDR data, such as considering the possibility of re-identification.[29]\n\nQuick de-identification checklist\n\nNote: Whether information is personal or de-identified will depend on the context. Information will be de-identified where the risk of an individual being re-identified in the data is very low in the relevant release context (or data access environment).[29] Put another way, information will be de-identified where there is no reasonable likelihood of re-identification occurring.\n\nFurther resources\n\nThe OAIC and Data61 joint resource on de-identification, The De-Identification Decision-Making Framework is available for download from the CSIRO Data61 website."
