Sometimes if you have nothing better to say, just shut that trap!\n\nSupporting or seeming to support anything close to genocide is dumb.\n\nGladly though, Afolayan who is in the business of making movies and in most need of a buying audience is said to have apologised and pulled down his infamous tweet.\n\nGuess next time he would know when to apply the verbal zip and leave the ring for professional and career politicians to do the boxing. Dining and wining with them in government house doesn't really make you a 5-Star nincompoop like most of them."
