        "text": "Forgive your enemies, but never forget their names. - John F. Kennedy Every note played 🎸and every lyric sung shapes a band’s identity. Its name holds a similar power. Reading or hearing a band's name often evokes a strong memory. Sometimes I can picture a concert and be transported back to that moment. Or, I remember singing into my hairbrush/microphone🎙without a care in the world. When a band changes their name, the transformation elicits an emotional response. Sometimes it marks a pivotal step in their sonic narrative. Other times, external factors force the shift. Unplanned, a name change can wreak havoc on a band’s image, cause confusion, and cost money 🪙. Or it can just be annoying 😠. And that was how things went for The Raconteurs. The band was getting ready to release their debut album, Broken Boy Soldiers. The Australian release was delayed because another band, a Queensland jazz ensemble, used the same moniker. The Raconteurs first asked permission from the jazz group to use the name in exchange for some cash. The Queensland band turned them down, and countered by requesting a lot more money. Apparently they just wanted to see what would happen. That move ended negotiations. According to one of the Queensland band members, the Raconteurs told them to \"lick it.\" 😝 The band then decided to call themselves The Saboteurs in Australia. The name was one of the original ideas the band was kicking around for the group. The moral of the story? Look 👀 before you launch. Whether you're an awesome band or a developing a rockstar product, the lesson is the same. Checking first can save you time and money in the long run. The Raconteurs weren't the only ones to face legal challenges related to their name. Check out a few more 👇.

My wife and I kept our yearly rendezvous with Lake Street Dive, the band behind many of our kitchen dance-offs. Yet, it was the opening act—a spellbinding artist who mentioned her name once and quite briefly at the beginning of her set—that underscored the importance of personal branding. She was quirky, authentic, and her voice? A soulful aria with echoes of Amy Winehouse. She pulled us into her story, her life, even her challenges with autism. I was all in. I wanted to know more, to follow her journey. But how could I? She had breezed over the most crucial detail—her name. So here’s the real talk: YOUR name is not just a tag; it’s the encore to your life’s concert. Your story, your passion, and your uniqueness—these are the tracks of your album. But your name? That’s the title, the cover, and the spine. Make sure it’s not left out, and make sure you speak it often! Because in this world of endless noise, your name is your most memorable lyric.

Let's travel back down #MusicalMemoryLane to 1994 for this week's #SaturdaySounds... \"Only Wanna Be With You\" is probably the most recognisable and enduring song from the album \"Cracked Rear View\", the debut from Hootie & the Blowfish, which has sold over 22 million copies (I bought one of 'em – you're welcome, Hootie!). ❤️ While the lead singer, Darius Rucker, has gone on to lead a very successful career in Country music, he'll always be known and loved for this and other \"Hootie\" songs. Some trivia: people thought that \"Hootie\" was Darius' nickname, and the rest of the band were \"the Blowfish\". Actually, the band took their name from two of Darius Rucker and Mark Bryan's (guitarist) college friends. The \"Hootie\" part of the band's name came from a friend with \"large, owl-like eyes\", and the \"Blowfish\" part from another friend with \"puffy cheeks.\" I only report the facts, people! 🤷♂️😉 Have a lovely day, and please feel free to submit your requests in the comments! 👇 --- 🔔 Follow, connect and ring my bell for regular tips to help you grow your personal brand (with some music along the way). 🤜💥😴 Banish Boring™️... stop the snoring... 💡 and Reinvent Your Content™️. 👉 Start with a free video call via the link in my profile. --- #ContentStrategy #PersonalBranding #BanishBoring\n\n4 old blokes playing songs that have endured for decades 🎸 That's my summary of the Blur documentary I watched last night. Did it make me want to be in a band again? Probably not. But it was a masterclass in career longevity and evolution. Here are my key takeaways: Age and Mortality: The band members are older now and more conscious of their mortality. They appreciated their journey and the bonds they've formed a lot more. We shouldn't have to wait to get old to feel like this though. Managing Stress: Alex, the bassist, was turning up to rehearsals with a hangover. It was his way of managing his stress. And it's definitely not a good way to go. Very rock n' roll in your 20s but a lot harder in your 30s, 40s, and 50s. The Work Behind the Scenes: Touring, writing, planning, marketing, interviewing, and rehearsing. There's a lot of work that goes on to be in a band. And you might not even be successful! So you better make sure you love the work you're doing. Preparation Pays Off: Blur's relentless rehearsals led to an amazing Wembley performance. My wife went to it and says it's the best gig she's ever been to. The band didn't experience many nerves before playing the arena because they were 100% prepared. Engaging New Audiences: I wasn't a Blur fan. Yeah, I liked them. But I couldn't name an album. But the documentary gave me a \"way in\". And that's the same for all of us creating content online. We should be offering people a \"way in\" to our story and our products. Creating Lasting Impact: They've got a 35-year legacy. Their oldest songs and albums are stilled listened to by fans. We should try and create something that can last that long too. Short posts for 𝕏 and 30 second clips for YouTube aren't going to be seen by anyone in a week, and especially not in 35 years. Smoking: Smoking looked so fucking cool in this documentary. It was like the smoking band never happened. -- I wasn't a fan of Blur before. But now I am. And all it it took was 2 hours of watching them laugh, cry, and go on a gruelling tour 😂\n\nNew Post: Framed answer today – here’s the solution for December 29 - https://lnkd.in/gGvrbwgS - The last couple of years have seen a huge rise in browser-based puzzle games, tasking players with working out a certain kind of answer using limited guesses.

A class mate arrives. He is beaming and holding up the “Blackout” album by the rap-duo Method Man & Redman. We roll our eyes and turn our backs on him. Now, he had made things worse. We love the album. But a day prior, he hadn't even known of its existence. My friends and I had been raving about it. So he buys it - to fit in. In our eyes, he is using something precious to us - for his gain. That feels like abuse. So we shun him. It's one thing to be an outsider. But it's worse, if you're an imposter. As anyone who is part of the in-crowd knows: You can’t fake it. People smell it. You need to get the subtleties right. That’s where the whole “authenticity” push has its strong roots: There are countless niches and in-crowds. You don’t have to fake it. Just accept where you belong to and add value there. PS: Please don't do a \"cool rap\" because that's what the \"hip kids\" like. You'll be cooler if you just stick to your banjo or your accordion. PPS: A brand story song respects you and your target audience... and I have the right team, that gets the subtleties right. DM me to find out more.\n\nbashy. actor. musician. storyteller. starting out sharing his story with music, he made a name with his “kidulthood to adulthood” theme track. he later released his debut album 15 years ago “catch me if you can” in june 2009 .. and his influence has been seen and heard ever since. not least by gracing our screen, in top boy. so 15 years later, we have welcomed his new album.. titled “being poor is expensive.” there is truth in every word. where we hear from his lived experience. and truly understand, what it was like for him to grow as a young black man in kensal rise. it screams of the authenticity, and sincerity.. of THE culture. and it has given my friends, both sides of the river, something special it is everything that has been missing from British rap. and more. i would really encourage you to take a listen below. but, what can we learn from bashy’s journey to kensal rise, and beyond? 1) take time to genuinely understand a culture, and a community before inserting your brand into it.. brand’s have so much potential to do some good, and we have to step beyond simply having ‘good chat’ to actually ‘doing good’ 2) show that you understand what’s happening on the ground - and the places, the spaces and the faces that you would find there. not every area in London (or other cultural centres) is the same, yet how are we still using LDNR as a reference point in ad land, 6 years later? 3) it’s never too late to speak your truth, and it’s a slippery slope for brands when they go quiet.. yet bashy remained active in his community and beyond. he continued to have a story to tell with his music, and he confidently brought a evolved sound to us. if bashy could do it 15 years later, why can’t you and your brand? even though “being poor is expensive”, the story is a thing of beauty. my apple music would agree. do you? drop in those thoughts below. #culturalstrategy #brandstrategy"
