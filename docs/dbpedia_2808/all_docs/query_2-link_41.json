        "text": "Kunle Afolayan (born 30 September, 1975) is a Nigerian actor, producer and director. He is widely credited for elevating the quality of Nollywood movies through larger budgets, shooting on 35mm, releasing in cinemas, and improving cliché Nollywood storylines. After starting his film career as an actor in the 1999 political drama Saworoide, Afolayan made his directorial debut in 2006 with Irapada, a Nigerian supernatural thriller, which won the Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Film in an African Language. His subsequent directing credits include The Figurine, Phone Swap, October 1, and Citation.\n\nOctober 1 was the winner of 16 major African movie awards in 2015 and the second highest grossing Nigerian film at the time of its release, a feat Afolayan was to repeat two years later with The CEO. In 2021, the director signed a three-picture deal with Netflix. Swallow, the screen adaption of Sefi Atta's book of the same name was the first to be released in October 2021, followed by Aníkúlápó, an epic Nigerian fantasy released in September 2022. Afolayan has described the work as a \"Game of Thrones recreated in Nigeria but with a better representation of our culture”. Eleven days after its release, it was the #1 most-watched non-English Netflix original film.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nAfolayan is of Igbomina-Yoruba descent, from Kwara State. He is the son of the theatre and film director Ade Love. He majored in economics and started out working in a bank while doing some casual acting, before deciding to move into full-time filmmaking and taking a course at the New York Film Academy. Since 2005 he has been active in the Nigerian film industry. He has made several films including: The Figurine: Araromire which was in the Yoruba and English languages and Phone Swap which featured Wale Ojo, Joke Silva, Nse Ikpe Etim and Chika Okpala. The Figurine won five major awards in the African Film Academy and was successful in Nigerian movie theaters.\n\nAfolayan appeared at the Subversive Film Festival in 2011 where he represented the Nigerian film industry with his colleague Zeb Ejiro. In May 2013, Phone Swap premiered in France at the first edition of NollywoodWeek Paris and won the Public Choice Award.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAfolayan married Tolu in 2007, and they have four children. Their marriage ended in 2019. He identifies as a Freethinker.\n\nGolden Effects Pictures\n\nAfolayan is the CEO of Golden Effects Pictures, a Nigerian film and production company incorporated in 2005. The company's feature films include Irapada, The Figurine, Phone Swap, 1 October, Roti, Omugwo, The Tribunal, The CEO and Mokalik.\n\nNetflix deal\n\nKunle Afolayan struck a deal with Netflix in 2021 to make three feature films. The first included a screen adaptation of Sefi Atta's book Swallow. He and the writer penned the script, which reportedly has a major twist from the original story. ..... The second was the 2022 film Anikulapo, the most nominated film at the 2023 Africa Magic Viewers' Choice Awards, with 16 nods. The third, Ijogbon, is a coming-of-age adventure film that tells the story of four teenagers from a remote village in the south-west area of Nigeria.\n\nFilmography\n\nYear Film Role Notes Ref Actor Director Producer Writer 1999 Saworoide Yes 2002 Agogo Eewo Yes 2005 Ti Ala Ba Ku Yes 2006 Irapada Yes Yes Yes Yes Èjiwòrò Yes 2007 Onitemi Yes 2009 The Figurine Yes Yes Farayola Yes 2012 Phone Swap Yes Yes Yes 2014 Dazzling Mirage Yes 1 October Yes Yes Yes 2016 The CEO Yes Yes 2017 The Bridge Yes Yes Omugwo Yes Yes 2018 Crazy People Yes 2019 Mokalik Yes Yes Diamonds in the Sky Yes 2020 Citation Yes 2021 Ayinla Yes Swallow Yes Yes Yes Yes A Naija Christmas Yes 2022 Anikulapo Yes Yes Yes 2023 Ijogbon yes\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nYear Award Category Film Result Ref 2019 Best of Nollywood Awards Director of the Year Diamond in the Sky Nominated 2021 Net Honours Most Searched Actor Nominated 2023 Africa Magic Viewers' Choice Awards Best Indigenous Language – Yoruba Anikulapo Won Best Movie West Africa Nominated Best Overall Movie Won Best Director Nominated\n\nSee also\n\nIn Spanish: Kunle Afolayan para niños"
