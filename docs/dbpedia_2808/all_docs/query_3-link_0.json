This resource should be read together with the Australian Privacy Principle (APP) guidelines.[1]\n\nThe concept of ‘personal information’ is broad, and in most cases, whether or not information is personal information will be a straightforward question. However, in some cases it may not be as clear, and the answer will depend on the context and circumstances.\n\nWhere there is uncertainty, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) encourages entities to err on the side of caution by treating the information as personal information, and handle it in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).\n\nThis guidance aims to take you through the factors that you may wish to consider when determining whether information is personal information. The examples are provided for illustrative purposes only.\n\nHow does the Privacy Act define ‘personal information’?\n\nThe Privacy Act defines ‘personal information’ as:\n\nThe definition is technologically neutral to ensure sufficient flexibility to encompass changes in information-handling practices over time. It is also consistent with international standards and precedents.[2]\n\nTypes of personal information\n\nThe term ‘personal information’ encompasses a broad range of information.\n\nA number of different types of information are explicitly recognised as constituting personal information under the Privacy Act. For example, the following are all types of personal information:\n\n‘sensitive information’ (includes information or opinion about an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or criminal record, provided the information or opinion otherwise meets the definition of personal information)[3]\n\n‘health information’ (which is also ‘sensitive information’)[4]\n\n‘credit information’[5]\n\n‘employee record’ information (subject to exemptions [6]), and\n\n‘tax file number information’.[7]\n\nAlthough not explicitly recognised as personal information under the Privacy Act, information may be explicitly recognised as personal information under other legislation. For example, under the Telecommunications (Interceptions and Access) Act 1979 (Cth), certain telecommunications data (sometimes referred to as ‘metadata’[8]) is taken to be personal information for the purposes of the Privacy Act.\n\nHowever, information does not have to be explicitly recognised as personal information to constitute personal information under the Privacy Act. The types of information that are personal information are unlimited and can vary widely.\n\nFurther, the definition of personal information is not limited to information about an individual’s private or family life, but extends to any information or opinion that is about the individual, from which they are reasonably identifiable. This can include information about an individual’s business or work activities.\n\nPersonal information can range from sensitive and confidential information to information that is publicly available. The definition also makes clear that information will be personal information even if it is incorrect.[9]\n\nCommon examples of personal information\n\n1 Information about a person’s private or family life.\n\nA person’s name, signature, home address, email address, telephone number, date of birth, medical records, bank account details and employment details will generally constitute personal information.[10]\n\n2 Information about a person’s working habits and practices.\n\nA person’s employment details, such as work address and contact details, salary, job title and work practices.\n\nCertain business information — for example, information about a loan taken out by a sole trader to purchase tools for their business, or information about utility usage — may be personal information about the sole trader.[11]\n\n3 Commentary or opinion about a person.\n\nIn certain circumstances, a referee’s comments about a job applicant’s career, performance, attitudes and aptitude is ‘personal information’ as it is information about that person.[12] The referee’s comments may also be personal information about the referee given that they provide information about the referee’s views on a particular subject. Likewise, a trustee’s opinion about a bankrupt’s affairs and conduct can be personal information about both the bankrupt and the trustee.\n\nAn opinion about an individual’s attributes that is based on other information about them, such as an opinion formed about an individual’s gender and ethnicity, based on information such as their name or their appearance. This will be personal information about the individual even if it is not correct.\n\nInformation or opinion inferred about an individual from their activities, such as their tastes and preferences from online purchases they have made using a credit card, or from their web browsing history.\n\nHow can you determine whether information is ‘personal information’?\n\nFor information to be personal information, it must be:\n\nabout an identified individual; or\n\nabout an individual who is reasonably identifiable.\n\nIt is important to remember that decisions about whether information is personal information should be made on a case-by-case basis, with reference to the circumstances and specific context of the situation.\n\nSome information may not be personal information when considered on its own. However, when combined with other information held by (or accessible to) an entity, it may become ‘personal information’. Information holdings can therefore be dynamic, and the character of information can change over time.\n\n1. When is information ‘about’ an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable?\n\nInformation is ‘about’ an individual where there is a connection between the information and the individual.[13] This is ultimately a question of fact, and will depend on the context and the circumstances of each particular case.\n\nFor example, information will be ‘about’ someone where the person is a subject matter of the information or opinion. It is important to remember that information can have multiple subject matters - so in many cases this will not be difficult to establish.[14]\n\nInformation will also be ‘about’ someone where it reveals or conveys something about them — even where the person may not, at first, appear to be a subject matter of the information.\n\nInformation can have different degrees of connection with an individual and still be personal information. However, at some point, the connection between the information and a person will be too remote for the information to be personal information.[15]\n\n2. When does information identify or reasonably identify an individual?\n\nWhen will information be about an ‘identified’ individual?\n\nGenerally speaking, an individual is ‘identified’ when, within a group of persons, he or she is ‘distinguished’ from all other members of a group. For the purposes of the Privacy Act, this will be achieved through establishing a link between information and a particular person.\n\nThis may not necessarily involve identifying the individual by name. Even if a name is not present other information, such as a photograph or a detailed description, may also identify an individual. The key factor to consider is whether the information can be linked back to the specific person that it relates to.\n\nWhen is an individual ‘reasonably identifiable’?\n\nThis answer to this question will depend on the relevant context the information is being handled in. Certain information may be unique to a particular individual, and therefore may (in and of itself) establish a link to the particular person. However, for an individual to be ‘identifiable’, they do not necessarily need to be identified from the specific information being handled. An individual can be ‘identifiable’ where the information is able to be linked with other information that could ultimately identify the individual.\n\nThe inclusion of the term ‘reasonably’ in the definition of personal information means that where it is possible to identify an individual from available information, the next consideration is whether the process of identification is reasonable to achieve. This is determined by asking whether, objectively speaking, it is reasonable to expect that the subject of the information could be identified. Even though it may be technically possible to identify an individual from information, if doing so is so impractical that there is almost no likelihood of it occurring, the information would not generally be regarded as ‘personal information’.\n\nDetermining whether a person is ‘reasonably’ identifiable will require a contextual consideration of the particular circumstances, including:\n\nthe nature and amount of information\n\nwho will hold and have access to the information, and\n\nthe other information that is available, and the practicability of using that information to identify an individual.\n\na) The nature and amount of information\n\nThe more information about an individual that an entity holds or to which it has access, the more likely it is that the person will be reasonably identifiable from that information. Likewise, some information that is specific to an individual will more readily identify that individual than other types of information that are of a more general nature.\n\nb) Who will hold and have access to the information\n\nWhether or not an individual is reasonably identifiable from information will also be influenced by who holds and has access to information. Information that enables an individual to be identified in one context may not identify the individual in a different context. In particular, the likelihood of identification will usually be higher where the subject is known to the person who has access to the information.\n\nGenerally speaking, where information is publicly released, entities should be aware that the information could be accessed by anyone in the world. This may make it difficult to anticipate who might access the information, what other types of information they may have access to for referencing purposes, and what motivations they may have to identify an individual. This is why it is crucial that information which may be personal information is handled carefully and securely.\n\nc) The other information that is available (or known) to the recipient, and the practicability of using that information to identify an individual\n\nSome information is unique to a particular person, and may in and of itself identify that person. However, for a person to be reasonably identifiable, it is not necessary that they are reasonably identifiable solely from the information in question. Whether a person is ‘reasonably identifiable’ will be influenced by whether the entity that holds the information can identify the individual by referencing it with other available information (and in some cases, whether the entity/person who holds the information already knows certain information about the person). This includes use of other information held by (or available to) that entity, and any publically available information.\n\nWhere it is technically possible to identify an individual by referencing it against other available information, entities should also consider the likelihood that this would occur. The time (and in some cases, the cost) that would be involved in identifying the person, and the resources and operational capacity of the entity that holds the information, all contribute to the likelihood that identification would occur. For example, an individual is more likely to be reasonably identifiable from information held by an entity when the entity’s staff have access to, or can easily obtain, other information about the individual. By contrast, where the process of identifying the individual is so impractical that there is almost no likelihood of it occurring, the available information would not generally be regarded as ‘reasonably’ identifying the individual.\n\nAs part of assessing the likelihood of identification, entities should also consider whether an entity (or a particular person) may be especially motivated to attempt to identify someone. For example, there may be individuals who are highly motivated to identify persons living in a particular domestic violence refuge.\n\nThe feasibility of a particular method of identifying an individual can change with new developments in technology and security, or changes to the public availability of certain records. If an entity has decided that the information it holds does not allow the identification of individuals, that decision should be reviewed regularly in light of any such developments.\n\nReal-life case studies\n\nCan information have more than one subject matter?\n\nYes. Information that is about something other than an individual — a car, for example, or a piece of land — can still be about an individual as well. The key question to consider is whether the individual is a subject of the information, and/or the information reveals or conveys something about that person.\n\nExample one: Information that the body corporate fees for Xavier’s property have not been paid for a year is about the property, but it also reveals a fact about Xavier — that he has not paid his body corporate fees owed to the strata manager. This would therefore still be personal information about Xavier, even though the information may appear to be primarily about the property. Further, there is a clear connection between Xavier and the property, given that he is the property owner.\n\nExample two: Information collected by an insurance company about a car being parked at a certain address overnight on a regular basis is about the car. However, particularly when combined with other information, this fact about the car may also reveal that Zoe, the car’s owner, knows someone at that address and spends time there regularly. This means that the information about the car may also be personal information about Zoe.\n\nCan personal information be about more than one person?\n\nPersonal information of one individual can also be the personal information of another person or persons. This is known as ‘joint personal information.’\n\nExample one: Information provided for a joint loan application contains personal information about both parties to the loan application.\n\nExample two: A file note made by a doctor about his or her opinion about a patient’s prognosis contains personal information about the patient, but the opinion may also be the personal information of the doctor giving it.\n\nDoes personal information have to be in a particular format?\n\nPersonal information can be in any format – it is not limited to information that is contained in records.[18] The definition expressly states that information is personal information ‘whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not’.\n\nPersonal information can include information that is:\n\nshared verbally\n\ncaptured digitally\n\nrecorded\n\ncaptured on signs\n\nFor example, some personal information does not contain any words at all, such as images (especially photos) and sounds (voice or tape recordings) — or can be latent in a material item (for example, DNA in human tissue).\n\nWhat is not personal information?\n\nInformation that cannot identify an individual\n\nInformation that is not about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, will not be personal information.\n\nInformation that is not ‘about’ an individual\n\nInformation that is not ‘about’ an individual — because the connection with the person is too tenuous or remote - is not ‘personal information’.\n\nBusiness information\n\nGenerally, information that is only about a business is not considered to be ‘personal information’. This is because the Privacy Act defines an ‘individual’ as a ‘natural person’, and the ordinary meaning of a ‘natural person’ does not include a body politic or corporate entity (including a company).\n\nHowever, an individual’s personal information may be so interconnected to information about his or her business or company that information about that business or company can constitute personal information about the individual. For instance, where the business is owned and managed by a sole trader, the distinction between business information and personal information might sometimes overlap.\n\nIn practice, where information provided in a business or professional capacity is also personal information, the APPs will apply.\n\nInformation about deceased persons\n\nIn most cases, information about deceased persons is not considered to be ‘personal information’. Personal information is information about an individual, which means a natural person and does not include a deceased person. However, if information about a deceased person includes information or an opinion about a living individual, it will be ‘personal information’ about that ‘living individual’.\n\nDe-identified information\n\nDe-identified information is not ‘personal information’, as it is no longer about an identifiable individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable (see the definition of ‘de-identified’ in s 6(1) of the Privacy Act).\n\nDe-identification is a process which involves the removal or alteration of information that identifies a person or is reasonably likely to identify them, as well as the application of any additional protections required to prevent identification. This will generally require a number of steps, including:\n\nthe removal or alteration of personal identifiers (such as name, address, date or birth, and other identifying information), and\n\nthe application of any additional techniques required to obscure, aggregate, alter and/or protect the data in some way so that it no longer allows any individuals to be reasonably identified\n\nThe OAIC encourages entities to seek specialist advice when de-identifying information, to ensure that the most appropriate techniques are used. [19] In addition to techniques applied to the data itself, restrictions on the data environment (for example, imposing restrictions on how and where the data may be accessed and requiring that data users sign non-disclosure agreements) may also be necessary to help ensure that no individuals are identifiable or reasonably identifiable.\n\nIt can be difficult to determine whether information has been successfully de-identified. To be considered ‘de-identified’ for the purposes of the Privacy Act, the information must have a very low risk of re-identification, having regard to all the circumstances (and in particular, the context in which the information will be handled, including who will have access to the data, and what other information they might have access to). Any information which is re-identified from an apparently de-identified dataset will be personal information, and must therefore be handled in accordance with the Privacy Act.\n\nWhether information is de-identified is heavily context dependent. Information might be considered to be personal information in one context, but not in another. For instance, if de-identified information is disclosed to an entity which is legally obliged to take steps to ensure that it is not re-identified (and it does take such steps), then in the hands of that entity, the information might not be personal information. By contrast, if the same information was to be publically released, there would likely be a much higher likelihood of re-identification because anyone in the world could access that information.\n\nChecklist for determining whether information is personal information\n\nInformation will be personal information where it is about an identified or reasonably identifiable individual. Information may not, by itself, be personal information. However, in combination with other information, it may be.\n\nTo assist in determining whether information is personal information, consider the following questions:\n\nIs the information ‘about’ an individual – that is, is there a connection between the information and the person? This is a question of fact, and depends on the context and circumstances.\n\nSome information is clearly about an individual – for example, name, date of birth, occupation details, medical records.\n\nOtherwise — does the information reveal a fact or opinion about the person, in a way that is not too tenuous or remote?\n\nIs the relevant individual identified, or reasonably identifiable? Entities should consider all relevant contextual factors, including:\n\nthe nature and amount of information\n\nwho will have access to the information\n\nother information that is available.\n\nRemember — when in doubt, err on the side of caution and treat the information as personal information.\n\nMore information\n\nThe following resources may also assist APP entities to understand and comply with the requirements in the Privacy Act:\n\nAustralian Privacy Principles, which provides the text of the 13 APPs.\n\nAustralian Privacy Principles guidelines for more information about interpreting and applying the APPs.\n\nDe-identification of Data and Information\n\nThe examples provided in this resource are for illustrative purposes only. APP entities will need to consider how the Privacy Act applies to their particular situation."
