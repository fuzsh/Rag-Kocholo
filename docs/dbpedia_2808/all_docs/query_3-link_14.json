        "text": "As a student, you will be gathering information from a variety of types of sources for your research projects including books, newspaper articles, magazine articles, specialized databases, and websites. As you examine each source, it is important to evaluate each source to determine the quality of the information provided within it. Common evaluation criteria include: purpose and intended audience, authority and credibility, accuracy and reliability, currency and timeliness, and objectivity or bias. Each of these criteria will be explained in more detail below.\n\nPurpose and intended audience\n\nWhat is the purpose of the source? For example:\n\nTo provide information (e.g., newspaper articles)\n\nTo persuade or advocate (e.g., editorials or opinion pieces)\n\nTo entertain (e.g., a viral video)\n\nTo sell a product or service (e.g., advertising or marketing materials on a company website)\n\nWho is the intended audience? For example:\n\nScholars and academic researchers with specialized knowledge\n\nThe general public (without specialized knowledge)\n\nStudents in high school, college or university (e.g., textbooks for students learning a new subject).\n\nAuthority and credibility\n\nWho is the author?\n\nIs it a person?\n\nIs it an organization such as a government agency, nonprofit organization, or a corporation?\n\nWhat are the qualifications of the author?\n\nWhat is the author's occupation, experience, or educational background?\n\nDoes the author have any subject matter expertise?\n\nIs the author affiliated with an organization such as a university, government agency, nonprofit organization, or a corporation?\n\nWho is the publisher?\n\nFor books, is it a university press or a commercial publisher? These types of publishers use editors in order to ensure a quality publication.\n\nFor journals or magazines, can you tell if it is popular or scholarly in nature? See: Peer-reviewed, popular magazine, or journal?\n\nFor websites, is it an organizational website, or a personal blog?\n\nAccuracy and reliability\n\nIs the information well researched?\n\nAre there references (e.g., citations, footnotes, or a bibliography) to sources that will provide evidence for the claims made?\n\nIf the source includes facts or statistical data, can this information be verified in another source?\n\nIf the data was gathered using original research (such as polling or surveys), what was the method of data collection? Has the author disclosed the validity or reliability of the data?\n\nCurrency and timeliness\n\nWhen was the information published?\n\nFor books and articles - you should be able to easily verify the publication date.\n\nFor websites, try to determine the date the web page was created or updated\n\nIs current information required? If not, then accurate, yet historical, information may still be acceptable.\n\nObjectivity or bias\n\nDoes the source contain opinions or facts?\n\nIs the information presented in the source objective (unbiased) or subjective (biased)?\n\nDoes the information promote a political, religious, or social agenda?\n\nIs advertising content (usually found in business magazines or newspapers) clearly labelled?\n\nIn Summary\n\nDoes the source provide you with high-quality information? Is the information useful in answering your questions and meeting your information need?\n\nAdapted from Burkhardt, J.M & MacDonald, M.C. (2010). Teaching information Literacy: 50 standards-based exercises for college students.Chicago: American Library Association.\n\nRelevance - How is this information relevant to your assignment?\n\nAuthority - Who is the author? What makes this person or organization an authoritative source?\n\nDate - When was this information published and is the publication date important to you?\n\nAccuracy - Where are they getting their information from? Does it have citations and references? Are they using reputable sources or explaining how they gathered their data?\n\nReason for writing - Why did the author publish this information?\n\nAdapted from Mandalios, J. (2013). RADAR: An approach for helping students evaluate Internet sources. Journal of Information Science, 39(4), 470-478."
