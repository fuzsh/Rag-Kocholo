        "text": "For some Nollywood stars, acting was not a profession by choice rather a family dynasty that needed to be continued. In this Weekend magazine feature, Daily Trust Saturday highlights the most popular acting families of Nollywood.\n\nThe Kosokos\n\nPrince Jide Kosoko is a Nollywood pioneer who not only bridges the generational divide, but also all of Nollywood’s genres. He is in high demand as an actor in both the Yoruba and English film industries as well as in soap operas. At the beginning, he has played an actor in the MNET Africa Magic show, Tinsel. Sola Kosoko and Bidemi Kosoko are two of his twelve (12) children who are actors. Prior to her passing, Henrietta Kosoko, who was married to Jide Kosoko, was actively involved in Nollywood.\n\nThe Afolayans\n\nNollywood stars turned pastors\n\nMakinde in the eye of Oyo governorship storm\n\nUnquestionably one of the most popular actors of his era, Ade Afolayan left amusing memories in the sands of time. His career has spanned more than two fascinating decades; he has played a variety of roles and produced a number of his own plays. With this accomplishment, his kids continued the heritage that their late father had started. Despite his father’s legacy, Kunle Afolayan resisted feeling intimidated by attaining Nollywood’s A-list position as a producer and director. As a result, the Afolayans were proudly inscribed in the history of Nollywood thanks to Kunle’s accomplishments as well as those of his brothers Gabriel and Aremu Afolayan and sister Moji Afolayan.\n\nThe Amatas\n\nThe Amata family has achieved success in acting, directing, and film production, generating a collective net worth that spans the film and television industries. The eldest Amata took a little time off in the early 2000s after having a successful career with his brother Fred from the 1980s through the 1990s till his son Jeta Amata reached the right age to succeed. Despite the prominence of his brothers, Ruke Amata was another family member who managed to fit in and enjoy stardom in the background. Jeta reinvented the clan’s filmmaking prowess and achievements, expanding its appeal to the globe at large with tales rooted in the African culture from which he originates.\n\nThe Edochies\n\nSince the patriarch Pete Edochie entered the Nigerian film industry about three decades ago, the Edochies have grown to be one of the most well-known families in the country. As one of the most experienced and skilled actors in the business, Pete continued to be one of the dominant forces and well-known faces from the heyday of Nollywood. His sons Linc and Yul Edochie have been handed the reins of Pete’s legacy. Although Yul continues to enjoy the most popularity, Pete is pleased to have successfully transferred the torch while still acting.\n\nThe Adebayos\n\nWith a career spanning more than five decades and appearances in more than three hundred productions, Adebayo Salami is without a doubt one of the greatest movie stars of all time. He has been active since the 1970s and has been a part of a number of film and theatre companies until settling into the Ojo Ladipo movement and receiving his big break years later. Oga Bello’s sons, led by Femi, Tope, Sodiq, and Rilwan Adebayo, are still active in the film industry and continue to make movies both in front of and behind the camera. While Sodiq and Rilwan are more well-known for their work behind the scenes, Femi and Tope are more well-known for their roles as actors.\n\nThe Njamahs\n\nBeginning out as teens in the movie industry in the 1990s, the Njamahs each found their way to the top despite the fact that they were all aware they were participating in the world of thespians. The eldest member of the family, John, became famous first after landing a part in the renowned soap opera created by the late Amaka Igwe. Even though it was insignificant, it helped his career, and once home videos were available, John and Empress’ success had no bounds. The youngest and third member of the family, Aquilla used the success of his clan to establish himself as the director of some of the most intriguing thrillers produced in Nollywood from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s. Empress, who starred in a succession of big movies in the 1990s and 2000s while also heralding many controversies on magazine covers, has been claimed to be the most successful of the Njamahs. But, without John, who protects the clan as the patriarch that he appears to have become, the Njamahs would obviously be nothing."
