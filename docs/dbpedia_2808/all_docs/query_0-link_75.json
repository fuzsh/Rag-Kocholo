        "text": "Nigerian film production company Guguru Studios has joined forces with three other African studios. They will create a new musical drama film titled “A Dream To Die For.” This exciting collaboration was made possible with a grant of €80,000 (approximately ₦135 million) awarded by the European Union.\n\nThis is with additional support from the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP), the International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF), Creation Africa Ghana (an initiative of the French embassy in Ghana), and others.\n\nThe four co-producing studios include Driving Park Limited and AdomiBridge Studios from Ghana, Togo Films from Togo, and Guguru Studios from Nigeria.\n\nThis pan-African partnership shows a step forward for the film industry on the continent, as Juliet Yaa Asantewa Asante, the executive secretary of Ghana’s National Film Authority highlighted. Ms. Asantewa Asante emphasizes the importance of co-productions between African filmmakers. It fosters growth and collaboration within the industry.\n\n“A Dream To Die For,” will tackle the complex issue of illegal small-scale gold mining in Ghana.\n\nThis act is known locally as “galamsey” which translates to “gather them and sell.” David Masterwille wrote the film.\n\nThe story follows a group of young musicians who become entangled in the dangerous world of galamsey. This collaboration between studios from diverse African nations brings a wealth of experience and perspectives. Also, it offers the potential for a powerful and nuanced exploration of this critical social and environmental issue.\n\nThis isn’t the first example of successful African film collaboration. Play Network Studios from Nigeria and Mondjila Studios from Namibia previously teamed up to produce the thriller “The Skeleton Coast.” This demonstrated the growing trend and potential of such partnerships within the African film scene.\n\nThe Guguru Studios-led project with “A Dream To Die For” promises to be another exciting addition to this movement. Furthermore, it brings together creative minds from across the continent to tell a story that resonates on a global scale.\n\nThe financial backing from the European Union and other organizations paves the way for this ambitious project. It demonstrates a recognition of the burgeoning talent and potential of African filmmakers.\n\nWith a strong creative team, a relevant social theme, and the support of international collaboration, “A Dream To Die For” is poised to impact the African and international film landscape significantly.\n\n1. South Africa (1997)\n\nThe dismantling of apartheid in South Africa marked a new era for the nation. To reflect this spirit of unity and reconciliation, South Africa adopted a unique national anthem in 1997.\n\nThis new anthem cleverly combined elements from two existing anthems: “Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika,” a hymn with roots in the anti-apartheid movement, and “Die Stem van Suid-Afrika,” the anthem previously used by the white minority government.\n\nBy blending these contrasting melodies, the new anthem became a powerful symbol of healing and the forging of a new national identity that embraced all South Africans.\n\n2. Rwanda (2001)\n\nThe 1994 Rwandan genocide left deep scars on the nation. In the aftermath of this horrific tragedy, the country’s previous anthem was deemed too divisive, as it was associated with the pre-genocide regime.\n\nIn 2001, a new anthem, “Rwanda Nziza,” was introduced. This anthem specifically emphasises themes of national unity, reconciliation, and hope for a brighter future. The lyrics speak of Rwandans working together to rebuild their nation and ensure such a tragedy never happens again.\n\n“Rwanda Nziza” serves as a constant reminder of the healing process and the country’s commitment to a more peaceful future.\n\n3. Zimbabwe (1994)\n\nMany African countries gained independence in the mid-20th century and adopted pan-Africanist anthems that celebrated the continent’s shared struggle for liberation. Zimbabwe was no exception, with “Ishe Komborera Africa” serving as their national anthem for a period.\n\nHowever, in 1994, the country felt the need to establish a more distinct national identity. They replaced “Ishe Komborera Africa” with “Simudzai Mureza wedu WeZimbabwe,” an anthem that specifically celebrates Zimbabwe’s unique cultural heritage and its journey as an independent nation.\n\n4. Democratic Republic of Congo (1960 & 1997)\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has a complex history reflected in its changes to the national anthem. Upon gaining independence from Belgium in 1960, the DRC adopted “Arise Congolese” as its anthem.\n\nHowever, in 1971, the country’s leader, Mobutu Sese Seko, renamed the nation Zaire and introduced a new anthem, “La Zaïroise.” This anthem served as a symbol of Mobutu’s regime. After Mobutu’s overthrow in 1997, the country reverted to its original name and national anthem, “Arise Congolese.”\n\nThis shift back to the original anthem symbolised a rejection of Mobutu’s dictatorship and a return to a sense of national identity rooted in the country’s independence.\n\n5. Ghana (1957 & 1960)\n\nGhana’s path to independence mirrored its changing anthems. During British colonial rule, Ghana used the anthem “God Bless Our Homeland.” This anthem reflected the nation’s colonial status and its yearning for self-determination.\n\nIn 1957, Ghana finally achieved independence, and a new anthem, “Lift High the Flag of Ghana,” was composed by a Ghanaian musician. This new anthem celebrates Ghana’s freedom and national pride.\n\n6. Namibia (1990)\n\nFor many years, Namibia was under South African rule. During this period, Namibia was forced to use South Africa’s national anthem, “Die Stem van Suid-Afrika.”\n\nHowever, Namibia gained independence in 1990 and cast off the vestiges of colonial rule. To mark this momentous occasion, Namibia adopted a new anthem, “Namibia, Land of the Brave.”\n\nThis anthem celebrates the nation’s hard-won freedom and the bravery of those who fought for independence. The lyrics speak of Namibia’s vast landscapes, its rich cultural heritage, and its unwavering spirit.\n\n7. Libya (1969 & 2011)\n\nIn 1969, Muammar Gaddafi rose to power in Libya. Gaddafi aimed to unite Arab nations across Africa and Asia, and in this pursuit, he replaced Libya’s existing anthem, “Libya, Libya, Libya,” with the pan-Arab anthem “Allahu Akbar” (God is Great).\n\nHowever, Gaddafi’s regime was overthrown in a 2011 civil war, and the country descended into a period of instability."
