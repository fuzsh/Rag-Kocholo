        "text": "A written process is used where:\n\nReading and signing forms is not problematic.\n\nThe research is complex or has multiple stages.\n\nFirst access to the research participants is by providing written information.\n\nThough opinions differ about the legal force of signed consent forms, they provide extra proof that the terms of consent have been understood. This can be especially important when seeking consent for copyright over data, or for future uses of data. Also, future funders or regulators may want written proof of the terms of original consent.\n\nFor literate participants who are not put off by written information, a written process is often a straightforward way of communicating the 'research contract'.\n\nBetween the provision of information and obtaining consent, the participant should be given a reasonable amount of time to consider whether to consent and to ask questions, though the time given depends on the project design, the context of the research and the participants.\n\nThe written consent templates below can be adapted to suit your study.\n\nAn oral consent process is where researcher and participant have a conversation to give information and obtain consent. There is no paper form to sign. It is normally used:\n\nwhere literacy is a problem\n\nwhere there are cultural or political concerns with signing contract-like documents\n\nwhere either the researcher and/or the participant could be put at risk by existence of a paper record\n\nwhere time for consent is limited, eg a chance interaction between researcher and participant (although you should not use an oral process merely to correct poor planning of research)\n\nfor research conducted via remote video conferencing software\n\nIt may also be more appropriate when interviewing elite participants as part of the research.\n\nFor all other research, how you arrange the oral process depends on how you will encounter your participants (for example email, phone, an on-the-street-meeting by chance). Between the information-giving and consent stage the participant should be given a reasonable amount of time to consider whether to consent, though this depends on the project design, the type of participants and the context of the research.\n\nWhen obtaining oral consent, please ensure you are recording the consent process either using a recording device (for example audio recorder if you are conducting an interview that needs to be recorded) or, if participants do not agree to audio recording or if using or keeping audio records is unsafe, by using a researcher record of oral consent template or completing a written consent form on their behalf.\n\nThe oral consent templates below can be adapted to suit your study, but careful consideration is required to ensure that these are appropriate for the research and the participants."
