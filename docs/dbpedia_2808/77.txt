The 42-year-old actor, who also deals in car sales, lamented that he has sold cars to people in Nigeria and abroad but none of his family members have patronized him.

“This message is for my extended and relational family, whoever you are, whatever you people are called – the ones that call themselves siblings of my father and mother, Ogun will k**l you all,” he said.

“I know the number of cars that I have sold to people both abroad and in Nigeria, who bought cars for their siblings.

“Why can’t I find a single person in my family to buy me a car in this life till I became older? What kind of useless head do I have?

“I don’t have any useful family members. Ogun will k**l all the elder and younger siblings that have money but refuse to spend it.”
