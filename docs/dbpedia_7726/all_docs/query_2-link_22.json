        "text": "Cast • Birthdays • Episodes • Studios • Events • Guides • Pyramid • Songs • Galleries • Aid Wiki\n\nNia Sioux Frazier (born June 20, 2001) is the middle child of Evan and Holly Hatcher-Frazier and is the sister of Evan, Jr. and William Frazier.\n\nOn Dance Moms, Nia was often placed on the bottom of the pyramid. Her mother, Holly, often got into arguments with Abby for not giving Nia enough attention and believed that the choreography Nia is given wasn't at a \"competitive standard,\" as well as accusing Abby of deliberately typecasting Nia in different ethnic roles (primarily seen in the first two seasons).\n\nNia and her mom were original members of the ALDC junior elite competition team when it was created. Both of them remained permanent members all the way up until the Season 7 episode Ashlee's Big Decision Part 1, when they officially left the Abby Lee Dance Company with the other elite dancers (minus Brynn) and formed The Irreplaceables.\n\nAs the longest-tenured dancer to ever feature on Dance Moms, Nia was best known on the show for her signature death drops, her stage presence, her determination to win, displaying vast improvements in her technique year after year, portraying an endless variety of different characters onstage, and her strengths in doing partner work, particularly with Mackenzie. She was also known off the stage for her bright smile, her bubbly personality, her friendship with all the girls, her quiet determination, her resilience, and her eagerness to learn new things.\n\nOther Information\n\nHer zodiac sign is a Gemini.\n\nNia has been dancing since the age of three.\n\nNia is the only main cast dancer to have featured in the first seven seasons of the show. As a result, she has appeared on more episodes than any other dancer on the show.\n\nHer favorite styles of dance are acro, contemporary, and musical theatre.[5][6]\n\nBesides dancing, Nia also plays the piano, drums and writes songs.\n\nNia had earned a purple belt in karate before giving up the sport to focus on dance.[7]\n\nDuring earlier seasons, Nia stated that she was always looking out for Mackenzie, ensuring that she didn't break away from the group.[8]\n\nHer favorite solos on the show have been \"Goodbye Maya\" and \"Bye Felicia.\"[9] With her favorite group dances being \"Amber Alert,\" \"Where Have All The Children Gone,\" and \"Free at Last.\"[10]\n\nDue to RND, Nia was an inpatient at Children’s Institute of Pittsburgh in 2009. In 2014 she returned to perform for other patients, along with Kendall, Mackenzie and Maddie. Holly is a board member with the Institute.\n\nNia's favorite dance moves are the death drop and side aerials.\n\nShe learned how to do the death drop (her signature move) from the drag queen Shangela, best known for competing on RuPaul's Drag Race Seasons 2 and 3 as well as RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars Season 3\n\nWhen Nia was younger, she was learning Mandarin Chinese. She has stated that she would like to return to studying the language again.[11]\n\nShe won her very first crown in 2014 at Sheer Talent Nationals in Las Vegas, where she won Miss Pre-Teen Sheer Talent with her solo \"Goodbye Maya\".\n\nOn Nia's YouTube channel, she has released dance videos along with the other content on her channel. The first one \"Gone But Not Forgotten\" was released on August 30, 2016. The other one \"Shark\" was released on September 13, 2016.\n\nIn the fall of 2020, Nia will be attending college at the University of California, Los Angeles. This makes her the 4th original Dance Moms dancer to go to college.\n\nAfter Season 7B of \"Dance Moms\" ended Nia left ALDC and switched to Dance Mechanics. Nia attended Dance Mechanics until she graduated from high school.\n\nNia is the first African American member to be featured on the ALDC Junior Elite Competition team. The second being Nicaya Wiley, the third being Camryn Bridges, the fourth being Kamryn Smith, and the fifth being Paris Moore.\n\nOther Credits\n\nTo see Nia Frazier's other credits, visit the Nia Frazier/Credits subpage.\n\nPyramid\n\nTo see Nia Frazier's placements on the pyramid, visit the Nia Frazier/Pyramid subpage.\n\nGallery\n\nTo view the gallery for Nia Frazier, click here.\n\nDances\n\nTo see tables for Nia Frazier's dances and results, visit the Nia Frazier/Dances subpage.\n\nFacebook page\n\nTwitter page\n\nInstagram account\n\nTikTok Account\n\nYouTube channel\n\niTunes page\n\n[[File:|link=http://staree.com/niafrazier]] [1]\n\nIMDb page\n\nGoogle Images for Nia Frazier (or with last name replaced by \"dance moms\")\n\nSearch YouTube for Nia Frazier (or with last name replaced by \"dance moms\")\n\nSearch Tumblr for Nia Frazier\n\nReferences\n\nCast • Birthdays • Episodes • Studios • Events • Guides • Pyramid • Songs • Galleries • Aid Wiki"
