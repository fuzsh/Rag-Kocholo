        "text": "Theater counts: Otto overtakes Way of Water to become this weekâ€™s widest release\n\nJanuary 19th, 2023\n\nAfter spending five weeks as the widest release, Avatar: The Way of Water finally drops into the second spot, going from 4,045 locations last week, to 3,790 this week. In its place, the widest release this week will be A Man Called Otto. After expanding into 3,802 theaters last week, the film retains that count this week. The Tom Hanks comedy-drama has earned just over $25 million since debuting in just four cinemas on December 30.

March doesn't look as strong, as no film is on track to hit $200 million, but there are five films that have a chance at $100 million. Granted, not all of them will get there; in fact, there's a chance only one of them will get there. Divergent is the film I think has the best shot at the century club, but it could be joined by Mr. Peabody and Sherman, for instance, which is earning surprisingly strong reviews. Noah is a big-budget Bible epic and the studio has to be hoping for at least $100 million, but the buzz is quite negative and there have been reports of troubles behind-the-scenes. Last March was led by Oz The Great and Powerful, which pulled in more than $200 million domestically. I don't think any film opening this March will match that figure. In addition, The Croods and G.I. Joe: Retaliation also hit the $100 million milestone, while Olympus Has Fallen came very close. Granted, there were also some big bombs last March, like The Host, but even so, I think 2014 will lose ground in the year-over-year comparison.
