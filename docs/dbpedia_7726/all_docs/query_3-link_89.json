        "text": "Nia Long To Play Katherine Jackson In ‘Michael’ Biopic\n\nNia Long will portray Katherine Jackson, the late Michael Jackson’s mother, in the upcoming biographical drama Michael.\n\n“Katherine Jackson is an incredible pillar of strength and grace for the entire Jackson family,” Long said about the role, per Variety. “As a mother, she was selfless and endured forces beyond her control yet still managed to help build a legacy beyond measure.”\n\n“I’ve been a fan for a long time because her characters stay with you,” director Antoine Fuqua, said in a statement to the publication of Long. “I’m excited to now work alongside her as she pours all of that into Katherine Jackson: a woman who was the glue, the rock, and the heart of the Jackson family during its best and its most turbulent times.”\n\n“Beyond Nia’s incredible talent, I was deeply moved by her connection to the material and her commitment to honoring Katherine and the love she had for her son,” producer Graham King said in a statement.\n\nLong is known for her roles in Boyz ‘n The Hood, Love Jones, The Best Man, and more.\n\nColman Domingo To Play Jackson Patriarch Joe Jackson\n\nThis role announcement follows the news that Colman Domingo will star as Michael’s father, the late Joe Jackson.\n\n“It’s exciting to do it with Jaafar,” Domingo told Variety in an upcoming episode of the Awards Circuit Podcast referring to Michael Jackson’s nephew. “Jermaine Jackson’s son is playing Michael, and he is breathtaking, and I think Graham King, the producer, has assembled an incredible cast.”\n\n“I’m excited to be a part of a film that explores both the complicated soul of the legendary Michael Jackson as well as his impact on music and culture as a global icon,” he added in a previous statement. “Not only am I fortunate to have a rich, complex and flawed character to portray in Joe Jackson, but I also have a front row seat for Jaafar’s incredible transformation.”\n\nDomingo scored his first Oscars nomination this week for his role as civil rights leader Bayard Rustin in George C. Wolfe’s Rustin.\n\nMichael is set to have its theatrical release on April 18, 2025.\n\nNia Long: 8 Best Acting Roles, Ranked\n\nAutumn Hawkins is the National Hip-Hop and R&B writer for Beasley Media, currently residing in New Jersey.
