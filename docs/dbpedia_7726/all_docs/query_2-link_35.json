        "text": "NBA coach Ime Udoka is back in the headlines for his personal life after Actress Nia Long is claiming that the Rockets head coach hasn't been supporting the couple's 11-year-old son, Kez.\n\nNia Long's allegations\n\nThe 52-year-old celebrity filed a court petition in Los Angeles last week according to outlet TMZ.\n\nIn the paperwork she is asking the court to give her primary legal and physical custody of her son, while also claiming that Udoka has failed to pay child support.\n\nAdditionally, the documents show that Long is not asking for Udoka to be cut off from their life and is willing to give him visits that are \"consistent with the child's best interest.\"\n\nThe Celtics scandal\n\nLong and Udoka met in 2010 when the coach was playing for the Sacramento Kings. While they were reportedly engaged, the couple never made it to the altar during their 12-year relationship.\n\nIn 2022 the couple broke up after news that Udoka had a relationship with a female staffer of the Boston Celtics.\n\nThe team suspended Udoka for a year for violating team policies after taking the team to the NBA Finals in his only season as a coach with the Celtics. He was eventually fired in February of this year.\n\nUdoka was just hired as the Houston Rockets new coach in April.\n\nWhen he was presented with his new team, Udoka spoke about his suspension saying he has grown from the adversity he faced saying:\n\n\"Having that time off and really a full understanding of how many people you impact by a poor decision, that's where you start with the ownership and accountability. I preach that for the players and so I have to take responsibility for my part. I took leadership and sensitivity training and (did) some counseling with my son to help him improve the situation that I put him in....You can grow from adversity and think I've done that this year.\""
