        "text": "Nina Simone’s distinctive voice, powerful blend of classical, blues, and gospel music, and passionate civil rights activism ensured that her decades-long legacy endures.\n\nDespite her fame, until a few years ago little was known about Simone’s childhood home in Tryon, North Carolina. In 2017, the humble, three-room clapboard house where she spent her childhood and began learning to play the piano was in severe disrepair and put up for sale.\n\nWith the threat of its impending demolition, four African American artists sprang into action. Conceptual artist Adam Pendleton, sculptor and painter Rashid Johnson, collagist and filmmaker Ellen Gallagher, and abstract artist Julie Mehretu founded Daydream Therapy, LLC and collectively bought the home for $95,000.\n\nWith leadership and guidance from the four artists, the National Trust for Historic Preservation's African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund—along with the Tryon community, Nina Simone Project, World Monuments Fund, and North Carolina African American Heritage Commission—are preserving Simone’s Tryon home.\n\nTo thank those who supported the fund, Simone performed her debut recital at the Tryon Library in 1943 at age 11. However, living in a Jim Crow-segregated South, Simone’s parents were forced to give up their seats for white audience members when they arrived. Simone refused to play until her parents were returned to their rightful place in the front row.\n\nFollowing her high school graduation, Simone moved to New York City in 1950 to attend a summer program at Juilliard and apply for a scholarship at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. However, Curtis rejected her application—allegedly due to her race."
