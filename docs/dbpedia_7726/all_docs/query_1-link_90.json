        "text": "Nia, who has delivered iconic performances throughout her career, is set to play Katherine Jackson, the mother of the late American singer.\n\nThe biopic will portray a “brilliant yet complicated man” who became known as one of the greatest performers of all time.\n\nWhile talking about her role, Long said, “Katherine Jackson is an incredible pillar of strength and grace for the entire Jackson family,”\n\nShe added, “As a mother, she was selfless and endured forces beyond her control yet still managed to help build a legacy beyond measure.”\n\nNia, a mother herself, was able to naturally put maternal love into her character in the movie.\n\n“Beyond Nia’s incredible talent, I was deeply moved by her connection to the material and her commitment to honoring Katherine and the love she had for her son,” said Graha King, the producer of the biopic.\n\nMoreover, there’s no doubt Nia would justify the role of Jackson’s mother. Long is a strong and loving mother and a woman raised with high values by her mother.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nTalita married early and raised her daughter singlehandedly.\n\nTalita is a graduate degree holder.\n\nTalita can sing, paint write songs.\n\nNia Long, Raised By A Single Mother\n\nNia’s mother, Talita Long, was born to Trinidad immigrants Clyde Gillman and Pearl Gittens as one of their two daughters in 1948.\n\nPearl worked three jobs like all West Indians in America, and Clyde was a cutter for fashion designer Geoffrey Beene and a sailor.\n\nTalita tries to speak less about her marriage at 21, which did not last long. However, she is thankful that she has a beautiful daughter.\n\nRaising her daughter as a single mother, Talita, in a way, taught her daughter to defend herself.\n\nIn a clip from TV One’s Uncensored, Nia said that her mother promised her plain M&Ms if she stood up against her bullies.\n\nNia, who was bullied by her childhood friends, was caught in a fight over her bike with her frenemy.\n\n“We got into a fight, it was my first fight,” the actress said. “And, I whooped her ass.”\n\nAnd as Talita promised, she gave M&Ms to her daughter.\n\nNia’s Mother Holds A Graduate Degree In Fine Arts\n\nTalita attended a Catholic elementary school in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. Despite being a mother at an early age, she continued her education.\n\nAfter Nia’s birth, she attended Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in Manhattan and earned a BA in Fine Arts.\n\nLater, she enrolled at Howard University in Washington DC and the University of Iowa, obtaining an MFA and MA.\n\nTalita Is A Multifaceted Artist\n\nTalita Long is a painter, recording artist, and songwriter. During college, she worked at the CBS Evening News and was one of the first African American graphic artists at CBS.\n\nNia’s mother also illustrated a children’s book by her mother and sister about a little boy who lost everything in a storm in Barbados.\n\nAdditionally, Talita is a talented musician and performs soulful numbers in jazz clubs with her band Synergy.\n\nNot to mention, her work with producer Malvin Dino Vice earned nominations in three categories for the 2015 Grammys.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs Nia Long Married?\n\nThe American actress Nia Long is not married. However, she was engaged twice, first with Massai Z. Dorsey and later with Ime Udoka.\n\nHow Many Kids Does Nia Long Have?\n\nNia has two kids, both sons from her previous relationships.
