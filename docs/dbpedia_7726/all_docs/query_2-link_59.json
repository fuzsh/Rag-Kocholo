        "text": "Nia Long attends the Los Angeles Premiere of Netflix’s “You People” on January 17, 2023 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe Best Man actress Nia Long is causing quite a stir online thanks to a post that many believe was meant to call out ex-fiancé and former Boston Celtics head coach Ime Udoka’s alleged mistress.\n\nAs previously reported by The Root, the couple split after 13 years together after it was revealed that Udoka had an alleged affair with a coworker. In the aftermath of their uncoupling, Udoka was suspended from the team for the 2022-2023 season for the accusations. Long also called out the NBA organization for the way it handled the news. However, the woman in the alleged affair had never been named—until now.\n\nRead more\n\nScientists Spot Black Dust and Debris on Canister Containing Asteroid Sample\n\nScalpers Are Ruining A Pokémon Art Exhibit\n\n‘Dead End:’ Workers At Non-Union Auto Plant Trump Visited Say The Place Sucks\n\nEpic Games Cutting 870 Jobs, 16 Percent Of Its Workforce\n\nEvil Genius Sues Netflix Over Canceled Rebel Moon TTRPG\n\n“I think the most heartbreaking thing about all of this was seeing my son’s face when the Boston Celtics organization decided to make a very private situation public,” she said at the time the news of the affair came out. “It was devastating, and it still is. He still has moments where it’s not easy for him. If you’re in the business of protecting women—I’m sorry, no one from the Celtics organization has even called to see if I’m OK, to see if my children are OK. It’s very disappointing.”\n\nBack in April, Udoka—who now works as the head coach for the Houston Rockets—expressed “much more remorse” over what transpired, saying in a statement, per People: “I released a statement months ago when everything happened and apologized to a lot of people for the tough position I put them in. I stand by that. I feel much more remorse even now towards that.”\n\n“I spent this last offseason working on myself in a lot of different ways, improving in areas, and it gave me a chance to sit back, reflect and grow. And I think that’ll make me a better coach and overall a better leader. The matter has been resolved,” he concluded.\n\nLong has since filed for legal and physical custody of their 11-year-old son.\n\nMore from The Root\n\nWild New Rumors About the Future of James Bond\n\nDan Harmon Dishes on Justin Roiland and Rick and Morty's New Voices\n\nAs Reports Swirl That Cher Hired Men to Abduct Her Son, She's Out Here Enjoying Fashion Week\n\nPink kicks man out of concert for circumcision message\n\nBritish Airways Pilot Fired For Snorting A Line Of Cocaine Off Of A Topless Woman The Night Before Flight\n\nSign up for The Root's Newsletter.
