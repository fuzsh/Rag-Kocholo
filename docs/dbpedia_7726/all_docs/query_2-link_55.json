Above all, I am a mother and will continue to focus on my children.”\n\nLong and Udoka have been engaged since 2015 and they have a 10-year-old son named Kez Sunday Udoka. The veteran actress also shares her 21-year-old son Massai Dorsey II with actor Massai Dorsey.\n\n“The Boston Celtics announced today that the team has suspended Head Coach Ime Udoka for the 2022-23 season for violations of team policies. A decision about his future with the Celtics beyond this season will be made at a later date. The suspension takes affect immediately,” the team said in a statement posted to its Twitter account.\n\nIn a statement to ESPN, Udoka expressed his apologies while accepting the team’s decision. “I want to apologize to our players, fans, the entire Celtics organization, and my family for letting them down,” he said. “I am sorry for putting the team in this difficult situation, and I accept the team’s decision. Out of respect for everyone involved, I will have no further comment.”\n\nUdoka was a professional basketball player for 12 years before he retired in 2012. He spent seven years as an assistant coach to Gregg Popovich with the San Antonio Spurs, then went to the Philadelphia 76ers for a season before landing with the Brooklyn Nets in 2020. He joined the Celtics last summer.\n\nHave you subscribed to theGrio’s new podcast “Dear Culture”? Download our newest episodes now! TheGrio is now on Apple TV, Amazon Fire, and Roku.
