        "text": "Hometown: Tallahassee, FL\n\nDegree(s): Florida State University, B.S. (Human Development and Family Sciences)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: As a local I've always had a love for Tallahassee for many reasons. There are many parks to explore including Tom brown park and Piney Z, which has a great walking trail my mom and I love to go on! Tallahassee also offers lots of variety.

Considering how small of a city this is relative to population size. We have some phenomenal food, whether these are sit-down restaurants, food trucks, or a small hole-in-the-wall place. This city and its surrounding areas have it all.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: How accessible our campus is, you can walk from one corner of campus to the other in under 30 minutes. It's incredible how this university can have so many things in such a compact area!\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Enjoy the time that you have on campus, these will be some of the best experiences you have. Make sure to cherish them and live in the moment.

From sports to student organizations to campus traditions, there is spirit in everything we do. Every day is a great day when you're at FSU!\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Don't be afraid to try something new! Florida State has so many options to help you broaden your horizons, take advantage of attending a campus rich with opportunities! You never know when you'll discover a new passion or hobby.\n\nHometown: Little Rock, AR\n\nDegree(s): Florida State University, B.A. (English); M.S. (Retail Entrepreneurship)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: Tallahassee has a never-ending list of great local restaurants. I also love some of the unique festivals that we host each year, as well as our great parks. I'm a regular at Cascades!\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: Besides the fact that FSU gave me an amazing college experience, it is also just so naturally beautiful. From the red brick to the Spanish moss, it's nice to just find a quiet spot on campus and soak it all in every once in a while!\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Document your college journey!

(Psychology)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: I love how unique the city of Tallahassee is, blending historic landmarks, modern architecture, and lush green spaces. With the capitol, extensive parks and trails, and vibrant art scenes, every street in Tallahassee promises a distinct experience.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: FSU felt like home from the moment I stepped onto campus. Our emphasis on traditions and community makes our school one of a kind. The school spirit within the community extends beyond sports and into our research, student organizations, and academics. For me, few things were more special than waking up on campus for the first home football game. Experiencing the War Chant echoing through campus and witnessing locals, students, faculty, and alumni alike show their support for FSU is something I wish everyone could experience.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Take advantage of everything our campus has to offer and fully immerse yourself into the experience. Outside of student organizations, there are always events happening on/around campus that provide students with an opportunity to meet new people, engage in fun activities, and even learn new skills. Take every opportunity to explore yourself and allow yourself to step outside of your comfort zone. These years provide a once in a lifetime opportunity, enjoy them!\n\nHometown: Perry, FL\n\nDegree(s): Florida State University, B.S.

Coming from south Florida we do not get to experience season changes, so it was something very beautiful to witness.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: I really enjoy that FSU does really nurture students to develop the core values of strength, skill, and character. FSU really pushes students to be successful in every aspect from career growth to even personal growth. FSU wants students to be successful in every way.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Step out of your comfort zone. When you step out of your comfort zone you will see things differently. You will not be afraid to go after what you want and not miss out on a potential opportunity.\n\nHometown: Gray. TN\n\nDegree(s): University of Pennsylvania, B.A. (Psychology)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: I love the feel of Tallahassee, it feels like a small town but has so much to do. I also am from the smoky mountains, so I love being in a wooded area but only a short drive to a beach.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: The School Spirit from students, alumni, and the surrounding community. I grew up to be a sports fan and there is nothing like being at a school where everyone feels school spirit and goes to all the sports games. I also love that at FSU, it's not just a football school, here, all of the sports are widely attended and cheered for.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Don't hesitate to take a chance that might seem small like joining a club or taking an internship that is out of your comfort zone. I found my two passions- higher education and sports photography- by taking opportunities that didn't align with what I ended up going to school for. Both of those opportunities changed the direction of my life. So even if its just a small organization or job that you only spend a few hours a week or something that is larger, take a leap with something new at FSU. You may just find a new passion.\n\nHometown: Tampa, FL\n\nDegree(s): Florida State University, B.S (Psychology)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: Tallahassee instantly felt like home away from home for me.

FSU also has a beautiful campus and strong school spirit.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Be open to new things and experience a little bit of it all. Get to know a wide range of people, whether it be faculty, staff, and students.\n\nHometown: Tallahassee, FL\n\nDegree(s): Florida State University, B.S. (Psychology)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: There is something magical about the canopy roads—when oak trees dangle Spanish moss over gently bending and shaded roads that occasionally cut into the red clay earth—in and around Tallahassee.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: Market Wednesdays in and around the Student Union and Legacy Walk are great opportunities to see what is happening on and off campus. You can engage with student organizations and shop at local business vendors. As a student—and notorious window shopper—I would go to Market Wednesdays just to see what was new.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: There is more than one way to succeed. While an initial plan may not find success, looking into the resources available through FSU and making alternate plans will help you to create success in ways you may not have previously expected.\n\nHometown: Riverview, FL\n\nDegree(s): Florida State University, B.A. (International Affairs and French); M.S. / Ed.S.

This is an excellent way to meet people while gaining confidence in yourself and your academics by engaging in a student organization, society, service or sport.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Try to create healthy habits early. It is easy to overwhelm yourself with a packed schedule or to overindulge in the amount of free time you have with friends. Find your balance and allow FSU to support you with a variety of resources when needed.\n\nHometown: Tampa, FL\n\nDegree(s): Florida State University, B.S. (Social Science Education); M.S. (Curriculum and Instruction)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: I love the way the Tallahassee community comes together in support of all things Florida State. There are many alumni who live in the area (and a large number who travel back each year) who are not afraid to show off their FSU Seminole Pride. Whether it be attending football games in Doak Campbell Stadium, cheering on performers in the FSU Flying High Circus, or lining the streets for the annual FSU Homecoming Parade, our community is always more than willing to show their love for FSU.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: I appreciate FSU's dedication to experiential learning, because getting an education is not limited to the classroom. These opportunities can take the form of internships, service learning, creative research, or even international study. FSU has built these types of experiences into its curriculum to allow for real world, hands-on experience that will successfully prepare students for life after college.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Take the time to learn more about all the resources we have on campus to help you succeed in and out of the classroom. From your professor's office hours, to the ACE Learning Studio, to the Career Center, FSU is an institution that strives to show you great you can be. Do not let any opportunity pass you by and take advantage of all FSU has built for you.\n\nHometown: Miami, FL\n\nDegree(s): Florida State University, B.S. (Psychology)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: All the green space! Coming from a big city, I loved being able to study or sip coffee under the massive oak trees.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: How warm and welcoming campus is. From the first day I stepped onto FSU's campus, I felt at home. Whether it was just a simple wave as I crossed paths with another student, new friends inviting me into a study group in the library, or how helpful and courteous faculty and staff were, I knew I had found somewhere special!\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Live on campus if you can! It will help you meet people, get connected across campus, and help ease the transition into college.\n\nHometown: Tallahassee, FL\n\nDegree(s): Florida State University, B.S. (Sociology)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: The beautiful outdoors of Tallahassee and our surrounding areas: our rivers, lakes, and nearby coast. The funky/cool locally owned restaurants. The friendliness of the citizens!\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: You can feel the pride that people at Florida State feel for our university. You feel this spirit once you become part of the Seminole family.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Go to class! Get involved in at least one club or activity. Make new friends from different backgrounds! Utilize the valuable services available to you, especially Transfer Student Services.\n\nHometown: Tallahassee, FL\n\nDegree(s): Florida State University, B.A. (English)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: The strong sense of community.

There are also several beautiful parks in and around Tallahassee that are fun to visit.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: The beauty of the campus and the many great events that are available to students and the Tallahassee community.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Take advantage of the opportunities that the University provides to help you be successful, and do not hesitate to ask questions.\n\nHometown: Jacksonville, FL\n\nDegree(s): Florida State University, B.S. (Art Education)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: Tallahassee is a small town at heart. I love the slower pace of things and the fact that I can access everything in the city with a 25-minute drive or less. At the same time, it doesn't feel as small to students. FSU's campus is located within a 5-mile radius of FAMU, TCC and our state Capitol Building. This diverse, densely populated area of town comes alive during the school year, giving Tallahassee the best of both worlds.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: I love how the university still feels like a small school, despite the tremendous growth we've experienced over the last thirty years. Students are still our focus here and first-year students have direct access to faculty and staff through a variety of programs as soon as they set foot on campus. The community is warm and friendly, which is one of the reasons I've always felt at home here.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Step outside your comfort zone. Keep in mind that this is a new experience for all first-year students, so you're not alone if you feel a bit apprehensive. Accept an invitation to the social events in your residence hall, attend an involvement fair, or just hang out on Landis Green for an afternoon. The connections you make in your first semester may last a lifetime, so don't be afraid to try something new.\n\nHometown: Alfred, NY\n\nDegree(s): Alfred University, BFA (Graphic Design & Printmaking); M. ED. (Higher Education Administration)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: Tallahassee is truly a college town, which reminds me of a larger version of home. The beautiful weather here allows me to be outside all year.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: Our campus community is welcoming, eager to help each other, and full of school spirit. It has that small school feel even though we are a large public institution.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Attending college is a time to discover yourself. Getting involved inside and outside of the classroom will help you realize things you like and even things you don't like. Your college experiences will help shape you and allow you to transition into your future career. My work study job in Admissions lead me down a career path I wasn't expecting, and that experience helped me find my passion in Higher Education.\n\nHometown: Tallahassee, FL\n\nDegree(s): Florida State University, B.S. (Hospitality Management)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: All the outdoor activities in Tallahassee and the surrounding area. There are plenty of connected greenways and trails to explore in Tallahassee. If you're looking for some variety, you can drive down to the coast for a beach getaway or some fun on the water.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: FSU has a beautiful campus which also feels very close-knit. The FSU Reservation, also known as the Rez, is just a few miles down the road and offers great team building and outdoor activities.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: There are many wonderful museums and venues just outside of campus.
