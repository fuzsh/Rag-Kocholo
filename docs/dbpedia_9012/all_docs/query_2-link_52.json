        "meta_description": "<p>Twice named Female Vocalist of the Year by the International Bluegrass Music Association, <strong>Laurie Lewis</strong> has gathered fans and honors for her powerful, emotive voice and her versatile, dynamic songwriting. For nearly four decades, Laurie has surrounded herself with stellar performers; her new ensemble, <strong>Laurie Lewis and Men of Note</strong>, is a super-group of acoustic talent. Featuring the unflappable, percussive groove of renowned bassist Mark Schatz, the deep jazz sensibilities of accordionist Sam Reider and the swinging drive of Brandon Godman on fiddle, Laurie Lewis and Men of Note combine individual artistry with Lewis&#39; original songs to bring a rich, eclectic musical mix to life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Her voice is a rare combination of grit and grace, strength and delicacy.

She is a sought-after recording producer and an equally skilled teacher and mentor. She is also an inspiration and a ground-breaker – across genres, across geography and across gender barriers. Laurie has shown us how a woman can blend into any part of the classic bluegrass singing trio, and she showed us how a great voice could move fluidly between bluegrass and other types of music.  She showed us how a female fiddler could emulate the strength and grit of the early bluegrass musicians. She has shown how a Californian can appeal to traditional bluegrass audiences, as well as winning acclaim in the worlds of Americana and folk music.

In her early 20s, she discovered the Bay Area bluegrass scene. In the early 1970s she played with local bluegrass band, The Phantoms of the Opry, then co-founded the Good Ol&#39; Persons, an all-female bluegrass band, with Kathy Kallick.

This set him off on a journey that has taken him from back porches and dive bars to concert halls and major festivals all around the world, as a bandleader and soloist. Mark’s performances and musical creations have been featured on NPR, PBS and the BBC, his work bringing together various streams of American music, from jazz and folk tunes to popular song and contemporary composition.</p>",
