        "text": "Blue Highway Lonesome State of Mind Down the Road BlueHighwayBand.com Thirty years is an eternity for most any working relationship. That Blue Highway, one of bluegrass music’s most renowned and awarded bands, has maintained an unprecedented level of quality across their now thirteen studio albums is remarkable. [The promo material identifies this as their fifteenth… Continue reading Blue Highway- Lonesome State of Mind review\n\nRate this:\n\nTo help me keep myself organized, I find it effective to review my annual favourites on a quarterly basis. This helps me when it comes to ‘year-end’ favourite lists, but also aids me in recalling albums that I enjoyed and which have possibly moved on from as the ‘new’ overwhelms the desk. While I went… Continue reading Fervor Coulee’s Favourite Roots Albums of 2024, April to June\n\nRate this:\n\nVarious Artists- Silver Bullet Bluegrass Lonesome Day Records Albums of bluegrass artists covering familiar rock catalogues is not a new concept. Some have been successful artistically (The Moody Bluegrass sets come to mind, as does The Hillbenders rendering of The Who’s Tommy), but it is a challenging target to hit. Lonesome Day Records owner Randall… Continue reading Silver Bullet Bluegrass review\n\nRate this:\n\nLaurie Lewis Trees Spruce and Maple Music LaurieLewis.com Laurie Lewis is a legend.

RoeFamilySingers.com Not being near the Roe Family Singers’ hometown hub of Minneapolis, my introduction to this group happened rather recently with the receipt of their new Bonfire Recording release, Sisters and Brothers. I was a bit apprehensive as ‘family’ groups tend to be problisome for… Continue reading The Roe Family Singers- Sisters and Brothers review\n\nRate this:\n\nBenny Martin and His Electric Turkeys- Turkey in the Grass CMH Records One of bluegrass and country music’s signature artists, Benny Martin left this earth more than twenty years ago. But the legacy he left behind is incredible. He played with Bill Monroe, Don Reno, Roy Acuff, Lester Flatt & Earl Scruggs, Johnny & Jack,… Continue reading Benny Martin- Turkey In the Grass digital reissue\n\nRate this:\n\nEach December I take some time to consider my favourite roots albums of the year, and I am pleased to continue the tradition. Usual disclaimers—I can only consider albums I either received for review, purchased, or acquired via industry-provided download; these are MY favourite albums of the year, not the ‘best’ (well, I think they… Continue reading Fervor Coulee’s Favourite Bluegrass Albums of 2023\n\nRate this:\n\nThe Osborne Brothers Bluegrass Concerto CMH Records By the time Grand Ole Opry members and future Bluegrass Hall of Famers The Osborne Brothers were recording for CMH Records, “Rocky Top” was a dozen years in the past. CMH allowed the brothers to continue recording after parting ways with Decca and MCA, re-recording some material for… Continue reading The Osborne Brothers- Bluegrass Concerto review\n\nRate this:\n\nMiles Zurawell Far Afield MilesZurawell.com Both Ardrossan, Alberta and Victoria, BC claim Miles Zurawell, a resonator and banjo player who is a member of Happy Trails, Prospector and who has just released his debut album, Far Afield.
