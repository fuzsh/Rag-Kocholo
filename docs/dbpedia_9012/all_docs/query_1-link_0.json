        "text": "Laurie Lewis – Trees\n\nI don’t believe I’ve ever heard a depressing bluegrass song because I don’t think the genre lends itself to that feeling. This new Laurie Lewis album features 12 sparkling songs rooted in bluegrass but tunes like “Enough” are poignant ballads that could be interpreted by any great singer in any musical discipline. That’s how good the songwriting is on this pristine set by multi-Grammy nominee Ms. Lewis.\n\nRecorded in Oakland & Berkeley, CA with some work in Nashville, TN the music is purposely watered in an organic atmosphere. Laurie Lewis plays guitar/lead vocals on all tracks & fiddle on “Quaking Aspen” & she’s joined by some faithful musicians on Trees (Drops May 31/Spruce & Maple Music/44:00).\n\nNo matter what she sings or plays — her traditional bluegrass soul is always present in each melody whether by another writer or her hand. The youthful yet experienced vocalizing is always tailored with grace, is tantalizing & beautiful. With “Why Did You Have To Break My Heart So Early In the Day,” Laurie tips a hat to the late singer-songwriter John Prine. I have to laugh. I can hear John sing something like this, it’s exactly his personality Laurie has captured.\n\nA song like “Quaking Aspen,” reminds me of the structure & vocalizing once conveyed by the marvelous McGarrigle Sisters. They weren’t necessarily a bluegrass duo (they were from Canada) but had that current running through their voices.\n\nSome tunes will be for selective tastes since Laurie won’t compromise the vintage tone if needed to keep the song faithful & humorous like the excellent (“Hound Dog Blues”). But for the most part, the veteran (5 decades) singer-songwriter keeps her showcase anchored in her bluegrass with cohesive folky tunes, some acapella, & old-time melodic flavors that border country with Appalachia accessibility.\n\nEverything is performed diligently & with care with immaculate vocal shaping. Nothing’s overwrought & the tunes (like the cover of Bill Morrissey’s “Long Gone”) fire up dance steps & good times. Lewis knitted some fine tunes for this musical tapestry.\n\nHer vocals are upbeat & filled with an enthusiastic tone & in one word: delightful.\n\nHighlights – “Just a Little Ways Down the Road,” “Enough,” “Why Did You Have To Break My Heart So Early In the Day,” “Quaking Aspen,” “Long Gone,” “Hound Dog Blues” & “Rock the Pain Away.”\n\nMusicians – Tom Rozum (harmony vocals), Brandon Godman (fiddle/harmony vocals), Patrick Sauber (banjo/harmony vocals), Hasee Ciaccio (string bass/harmony vocals), Andrew Marlin (mandolin), George Guthrie (banjo/harmony vocals/lead guitar on “Why Did You Have To Break My Heart So Early In the Day,”) & Sam Reider (accordion).\n\n8pp stitched lyric insert included.
