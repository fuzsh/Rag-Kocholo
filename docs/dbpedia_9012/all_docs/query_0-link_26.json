        "text": "American stand-up comedian (1947–2024)\n\nFor other people named Richard Lewis, see Richard Lewis (disambiguation).\n\nRichard Philip Lewis (June 29, 1947 – February 27, 2024) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, and writer. Lewis came to prominence in the 1980s and became known for his dark, neurotic, and self-deprecating humor. As an actor, he was known for starring in the ABC sitcom Anything but Love from 1989 to 1992, and for playing the role of Prince John in the 1993 film Robin Hood: Men in Tights. Lewis also had a recurring role as a semi-fictionalized version of himself in the HBO comedy series Curb Your Enthusiasm from 2000 to 2024.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nLewis was born on June 29, 1947,[1] in Brooklyn. He was raised in Englewood, New Jersey.[2][3] He was born into a Jewish family, but was not especially religious.[4] His father, Bill (d. 1971), was co-owner of Ambassador Caterers in nearby Teaneck, New Jersey,[5] and his mother, Blanche, was an actress in community theatre.[3][6][7] Lewis was the youngest of three siblings – his sister was older by 9 years, and his brother by 6.[3][8][9] His father's catering business kept him very busy, and his siblings had both left home by the 1960s, leaving Lewis at home alone with his mother, with whom there was friction.[8] Lewis told The Washington Post in 2014 that he suspected that his birth had been a mistake.[8]\n\nLewis was known for being the class clown and causing trouble in school.[4] He graduated from Dwight Morrow High School in 1965 and attended Ohio State University where he attained a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in Marketing four years later in 1969.[3][10] He was the recipient of the Fisher College of Business Alumni Achievement Award in November 2023.[11][12]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nLewis first tried stand-up at an open mic in Greenwich Village in 1971.[6] He began writing and regularly performing stand-up comedy in 1972, while working as a copywriter for an advertising agency by day.[13] He was discovered by comedian David Brenner while performing in Greenwich Village. Brenner helped Lewis's career by introducing him to the comedy clubs in Los Angeles and getting Lewis his first appearance on The Tonight Show.[13] By the mid-1970s, Lewis had appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson[14] and publications, such as the New York Daily News and New York magazine, were naming him one of the \"new breed\" or \"class\" of comedians; this list containing names such as Robert Klein, Lily Tomlin, Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Andy Kaufman, Richard Belzer, and Elayne Boosler.[15][16] His influences were Richard Pryor, Buster Keaton, Woody Allen, and Lenny Bruce.[17]\n\nLewis was known for dark comedy, self-deprecation, and for frank discussions regarding his many neuroses, as well as his struggles with alcoholism and drug addiction.[18] He was noted for wearing all-black attire and for pacing and gesticulating wildly during his stand-up act.[18][19][20][21] In his early days, he was also known for bringing taped-together sheets from a legal pad to his performances; he would lay them across the floor in front of him to remind him of joke premises and topics he wished to cover during his performance.[18]\n\nLewis made his screen acting debut in Diary of a Young Comic, a 90-minute film that aired on NBC in 1979 in the timeslot normally reserved for episodes of Saturday Night Live.[22] A satirical look at the Hollywood scene, Lewis stars in the film as Billy Gondola (born Gondolstein), a young Jewish comedian who leaves New York City to find fame in Los Angeles.[22][23] The film's script was co-written by Lewis and Bennett Tramer, and was adapted from a story written by Gary Weis, who also served as the film's director.[22][23] The film features Bill Macy as Billy's father, Michael Lerner as his agent, and Stacy Keach as a landlord.[23] Performers George Jessel, Dom DeLuise, Nina van Pallandt, and Gary Mule Deer make appearances in the film as themselves.[23]\n\nLewis gained much wider exposure in the 1980s and 1990s with numerous appearances on talk shows such as The Tonight Show,[14] both Late Night and the Late Show with David Letterman,[13][19] and The Howard Stern Show.[20] He also produced the comedy special I'm in Pain, which aired on Showtime in 1985,[24] followed by the specials I'm Exhausted, I'm Doomed, and Richard Lewis: The Magical Misery Tour, all of which aired on HBO in 1988, 1990, and 1997 respectively.[20][25] From 1989 to 1992, he co-starred with Jamie Lee Curtis on the sitcom Anything but Love.[19] He also starred on the short-lived sitcoms Daddy Dearest with Don Rickles in 1993, and Hiller and Diller with Kevin Nealon in 1998.[19] He played Prince John in the 1993 film Robin Hood: Men in Tights,[26] and starred as a struggling alcoholic and drug addict in the 1995 drama film Drunks. The latter film featured performances from Faye Dunaway, George Martin, Parker Posey, Howard Rollins, Spalding Gray, and Dianne Wiest, and was based on Gary Lennon's play Blackout.[27] Lewis also appeared in the 1995 drama film Leaving Las Vegas, and the 1997 romantic comedy Hugo Pool.[20][28]\n\nInto the 2000s, Lewis had recurring roles as a B movie producer on the sitcom Rude Awakening,[29] and as Rabbi Richard Glass on the family drama series 7th Heaven.[20] He also had a recurring role on the sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm as a semi-autobiographical version of himself.[26] Lewis first met the show's star and creator, Larry David, at summer camp in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York, when they were 12 years old; Lewis claimed that, at the time, they hated each other.[20] The two comedians also happened to be born three days apart in the same hospital.[3] The pair met again over a decade later while performing stand-up in New York and became friends.[20]\n\nRecognition\n\n[edit]\n\nGQ magazine included Lewis on their list of \"The 20th Century's Most Influential Humorists\",[30] and Lewis was ranked No. 45 on Comedy Central's list of \"100 Greatest Standups of All Time\" released in 2004.[31][32]\n\nIn 2006, The Yale Book of Quotations included an entry for the expression \"the ______ from hell\" (as in \"the night from hell\", \"the date from hell\". etc.,) that was attributed to Lewis.[33] Lewis also petitioned the editors of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations to include the idiom, which was also worked into the plot of Curb Your Enthusiasm during the episode \"The Nanny from Hell\".[34] His lawyer sent some video tapes to Bartlett's general editor Justin Kaplan showing Lewis using the phrase.[34] Bartlett's declined, stating that the expression had predated Lewis's first taped broadcast.[34] In response, Lewis told Entertainment Weekly that he traces popular usage of the line back to his early days on David Letterman's show.[34]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMarriage\n\n[edit]\n\nLewis met Joyce Lapinsky in 1998 at a Ringo Starr album release party, while Lapinsky was working in music publishing.[18][35] The pair became engaged in 2004 and married the following year.[35]\n\nSubstance abuse issues\n\n[edit]\n\nLewis was open about his recovery from alcohol and drug abuse, having been a user of both cocaine and crystal meth.[20] His addictions worsened into the 1990s, prompting Lewis to stop performing stand-up from 1991 to 1994.[19] In a 1995 interview with the Santa Maria Times, Lewis discussed how John Candy's death the year prior had caused him to reflect upon his own life and career.[36] The two starred together in Candy's last film, the Western-themed comedy film Wagons East.[36] In later interviews, Lewis stated that he got sober in 1994 after winding up in a hospital emergency room due to a cocaine overdose.[7][19]\n\nLewis published his memoir in 2000, titled The Other Great Depression.[37] The book was reissued in 2008 with an added afterword where Lewis reflected further on his continued struggles with addiction.[7] In 2015, he released the book Reflections from Hell: Richard Lewis' Guide on How Not to Live; it contains his commentary and observations in the form of one-liners and other comedic premises, interspersed with images created by artist Carl Nicholas Titolo.[37]\n\nHealth problems and death\n\n[edit]\n\nDiscussions of Lewis's battles with anxiety and depression, and his multiple therapy sessions, were a fixture of his comedy.[19] He also stated in interviews that he suffered from an eating disorder due to body dysmorphia.[20][19] Lewis struggled with health problems resulting in multiple surgeries. In 2016, he shattered his right hand after falling from his roof; in 2019, he had back surgery related to acute back pain; and in early 2020, he shattered his shoulder, resulting in another surgery.[9][35] In the latter year, it was revealed that Lewis had battled multiple health problems and was in great pain during the shooting of Curb Your Enthusiasm.[35] He announced that he would be appearing in one episode only of Season 11.[26] Lewis returned in Season 12, the series' final season.[38]\n\nIn April 2023, Lewis announced he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease two years earlier. He said he would no longer perform stand-up comedy and was instead \"focused on writing and acting\".[2]\n\nLewis died of a heart attack at his home in Los Angeles on February 27, 2024, at the age of 76.[39][40][41] Friends and colleagues, including Curb Your Enthusiasm co-star Cheryl Hines and Curb Your Enthusiasm creator Larry David, made statements regarding Lewis' death and paid homage to Lewis.[42][43] He is buried at the Temple of Aaron Cemetery in Roseville, Minnesota.[44]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm work by Richard Lewis Year Title Role 1988 The Wrong Guys[45] Richard 1989 That's Adequate[46] Pimples Lapedes 1992 Once Upon a Crime[46] Julian Peters 1993 Robin Hood: Men in Tights[46] Prince John 1994 Wagons East[46] Phil Taylor 1995 Drunks[20] Jim Leaving Las Vegas[20] Peter 1996 The Elevator[46] Phil Milowski 1997 Hugo Pool[46] Chick Chicalini The Maze[46] Markov 1999 Game Day[45] Steve Adler 2005 Sledge: The Untold Story[47] Himself 2012 Vamps[45] Danny 2014 She's Funny That Way[45] Al Finkelstein 2017 Sandy Wexler[48] Testimonial 2018 The Great Buster: A Celebration[49] Himself\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nTelevision work by Richard Lewis Year Title Role Notes 1974–1992 The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson Himself – Guest 22 episodes[50] 1979 Diary of a Young Comic Billy Goldstein Television movie[46] 1980 House Calls Dr. Leon Prometheus Episode: \"The Phantom of Kensington\"[46] 1982–1993 Late Night with David Letterman Himself – Guest 48 episodes[20] 1985 Temporary Insanity Performer Television movie 1986 Riptide Andrew Fitzsimmons Carlton III Episode: \"The Wedding Bell Blues\" 1987 Harry Richard Breskin 7 episodes[46] CBS Summer Playhouse Joey Episode: \"King of the Building\"[51] 1988 Tattingers Longo Episode : \"Death and Taxis\" 1989–1992 Anything but Love Marty Gold 56 episodes[46] 1992 The Danger of Love Edward Sanders Television movie[46] 1993 Daddy Dearest Steven Mitchell 13 episodes[41] TriBeCa Joseph Episode: \"Stepping Back\" The Larry Sanders Show Himself Episode: \"Life Behind Larry\"[46] 1993–2008 Late Show with David Letterman Himself – Guest 9 episodes[50] 1994 Tales from the Crypt Vern Episode: \"Whirlpool\"[46] 1995–2008 Late Night with Conan O'Brien Himself – Guest 12 episodes[50] 1995 A.J.'s Time Travelers Edgar Allan Poe Episode: \"Edgar Allan Poe\" 1996 A Weekend in the Country Bobby Stein Television movie[46] Nichols and May: Take Two Himself Documentary Special, PBS[46] 1996–2015 The Daily Show Himself 16 episodes [46] 1997 Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child Old Beggar (voice) Episode: \"The Golden Goose\"[46] Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist Richard (voice) Episode: \"Undercover\" 1997–1998 Hiller and Diller Neil Diller 13 episodes[46] 1998 Rude Awakening Harve Schwartz 6 episodes[46] 1999 Hercules Neurosis (voice) Episode: \"Hercules and the Tiff on Olympus\"[52] V.I.P.
