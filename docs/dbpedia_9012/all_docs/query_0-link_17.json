        "text": "Laurie Lewis Announced as Recipient of an\n\nInternational Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA)\n\nDistinguished Achievement Award\n\nWith a 50 Year Career, Bluegrass/ Folk Icon Laurie Lewis’ 24th Album\n\nTREES was released May 31, 2024 on Her Own Spruce and Maple Music\n\n“California bluegrass keystone Laurie Lewis was just announced as one recipient of this year’s IBMA Distinguished Achievement Awards. For decades she has been a center of gravity around which the California and West Coast bluegrass scenes orbit, like a perseverant mother tree from which so many young shoots and saplings have sprung. Her brand new album, TREES, draws upon her wellspring of through-hiking and naturalist knowledge to encounter, process, and challenge so many modern day realities – health issues, the ever-quickening climate crisis, personal and professional life hurdles, and much more. The result is touching, emotional, encouraging, and inspiring, wrapped in traditional bluegrass trappings that feel more in service to the songs than to legalistic genre criteria. Lewis is one of the best to ever make bluegrass and TREES is one of the best releases in her lauded and superlative catalog. We recently published our exclusive interview, which you won’t want to miss.”\n\n—The Bluegrass Situation, Justin Hiltner\n\nListed as a “Best Bluegrass Album of 2024 (So Far)”\n\nStream/Buy TREES→https://laurielewis.hearnow.com/trees\n\nBERKELEY, Calif. — With five decades of music-making to her credit, multi-GRAMMY nominee Laurie Lewis has emerged as both a successor and contemporary of the many greats in bluegrass, old-time, and folk music. Unafraid to venture beyond established boundaries, she has carved out her place as a uniquely singular vocalist, songwriter, instrumentalist, and frontwoman in genres revered for their adherence to tradition, authenticity, and the canon of the forebearers.\n\nThe International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) has announced that Lewis will receive a 2024 Distinguished Achievement Award at the IBMA Bluegrass Music Awards taking place Thursday, September 26, at the Martin Marietta Center for the Performing Arts in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nA two-time IBMA Female Vocalist of the Year, she also won the coveted Song of the Year award for her rendition of the now-standard ‘Who Will Watch the Home Place?’ She has sung and recorded with Linda Ronstadt (“Pretty Bird”), and set poems by Wendell Berry to music—at his request (“Burley Coulter’s Song for Kate Helen Branch”). She’s influenced and inspired folks like guitarist phenom Molly Tuttle—one example of an entire generation of pickers and singers who call her a mentor. Ultimately, Lewis occupies a unique, superlative niche in American roots music that is all her own.\n\nLewis released her 24th album, TREES, on May 31 on her own label, Spruce and Maple Music. With it, she presents a profound and multifaceted perspective with life, nature, loss, and grief. While deeply ruminative, this set includes danceable music that drips with community and never feels burdened by its subject matter or apparent solitude. These songs—seven originals and a handful of covers—aren’t too concerned with genre, especially given that bluegrass and old-time tend to spout from Lewis like a bubbling mountain spring, in so many distinct manifestations.\n\nHer band has chameleonic quality, varying a bit across the entire sequence. It includes Lewis on guitar and lead vocals throughout (along with fiddle on one track), Hasee Ciaccio on bass, Brandon Godman on fiddle, Patrick Sauber on banjo, and George Guthrie on guitar and banjo. Special guests on the album include Andrew Marlin on mandolin, Sam Reider on accordion, and Nina Gerber on guitar.\n\nLaurie Lewis Tour Dates:\n\n7/19-21 – Darrington Bluegrass Festival – Darrington, WA\n\n8/14 – Valhalla – Tahoe, CA\n\n8/16 – Rancho Nicasio – Nicasio, CA\n\n8/17 – The Sound Union – Palo Alto, C\n\n8/29 – San Miguel Mission – Santa Fe, NM\n\n8/31 – Four Corners Folk Festival – Pagosa Springs, CO\n\n9/1 – The Old Church – Corrales, NM\n\n9/17-20 – Bluegrass on Whitewater – Rogue River, OR\n\n9/22 – FreshGrass Festival – North Adams, MA\n\n9/25-26 – IBMA Conference – Raleigh, NC\n\n9/27 – IBMA WOB Festival – Raleigh NC\n\n10/5 – Hardly Strictly Bluegrass – San Francisco, CA\n\n11/2 – McCloud River Mountain Music – McCloud, CA\n\n11/8 – The Old Steeple – Ferndale, CA\n\n11/9 – Soper Reese Theatre – Lakeville, CA\n\n11/30 – Freight & Salvage – Berkeley, CA\n\nKind Words About Laurie Lewis’ TREES:\n\n“‘Trees’ awakens memories of Ralph Stanley and ‘O Death,’ but it’s the writing that captures the world from the perspective of natural history that makes the song so compelling.”\n\n—Saving Country Music, Listed as one of “The Best Country Songs of 2024 So Far”\n\n“TREES is a long-play collection of songs that tenderly, earnestly, and sometimes joyfully explore what it means to exist on a vulnerable planet through times of loss and love… Lewis dives into the deep end of sorrow and change with tenderness, authenticity, and Americana storytelling prowess.”\n\n—Dana Yewbank, The Bluegrass Situation\n\n“Her melodies are unceasingly melodic, carefully crafted, and imbued with the sort of emotion that’s revealing and resolute in equal abundance. In other words, they’re relatable to anyone who’s experienced life’s triumphs and tragedies, and had a determination to persevere.”\n\n—Lee Zimmerman, Bluegrass Today\n\n“She can turn a love song into a weeper, such as in her tribute to John Prine, ‘Why’d You Have to Break My Heart?’ or cry along with her bow, as in ‘The Banks Are Covered in Blue’.”\n\n—Steve Horowitz, PopMatters\n\n“Sometimes, an album comes along that is such a mix of genres and influences, it’s hard to find exactly how to describe it…TREES is just such a work that blends influences of bluegrass, country, old time and folk, but with a contemporary voice. Maybe it’s just easier to say this project is perfect listening for a spring Sunday afternoon.”\n\n—Michael K. Brantley, Bluegrass Unlimited\n\n“The songs of TREES exhibit a perfect marriage of lyrics and instrumentation, particularly evident on ‘Quaking Aspens,’ with double fiddles mimicking the movement of the trees and echoing the verses in a kind of call and response… Rather than an escape into nature, TREES is a collection of songs artfully arranged to accompany an introspective journey.”\n\n—Nancy Posey, No Depression\n\n“This new Laurie Lewis album features 12 sparkling songs rooted in bluegrass but tunes like ‘Enough’ are poignant ballads that could be interpreted by any great singer in any musical discipline. That’s how good the songwriting is on this pristine set by multi-Grammy nominee Ms. Lewis.”\n\n—John Apice, Americana Highways\n\n“‘Trees’ reminds us just how deeply planted we are in the natural world, and it encourages us to celebrate the moments of joy and to be aware of the enduring beauty that surrounds us in nature and that will be here long after we’re gone.”\n\n—Henry Carrigan, Folk Alley\n\n“As singer, songwriter, fiddler and bandleader, [Laurie Lewis] has been a beacon of integrity and forward progress.”\n\n—Craig Havighurst, WMOT\n\n“Laurie Lewis is an icon in the worlds of bluegrass, old time, and folk… Through the natural disasters, storms, pandemic, and now health issues affecting her life partner, Lewis endures, like the trees she sings about. Her human side is in plain sight in these songs, as if to reassure us that we too can find hope in the small things, natural and human, and that change is to be embraced, not shunned. We’d best follow her lead.”\n\n—Jim Hynes, Making a Scene\n\n“The queen of bluegrass maintains her hot run of albums, her place in bluegrass history is of course secure… her vocals on this album are breathtaking. Lewis has always had a unique talent for songwriting and the superb production on this album enhances the songs.”\n\n—Paul Riley, Country Music People\n\n“Longtime folk and bluegrass artist Laurie Lewis has never sounded better than on this consistently fine acoustic outing, which features six original compositions, a co-write with fiddler Brandon Godman, and beautifully arranged covers of songs from the likes of Tom T. Hall, Bill Morrisey, John Hartford, and Kate MacLeod.”\n\n—Jeff Burger, Blogcritics, Americana Highways\n\n“There are so many memorable songs in the Laurie Lewis collection but ‘Trees’ and ‘Rock the Pain Away’ are amongst the best. The sprouting of a sequoia seed after the tragedy of a fire gives us hope for our future and we can look forward to more compelling music from Laurie Lewis to guide our journey.”\n\n—Brenda Hough, California Bluegrass Association\n\n“‘Just a Little Ways Down the Road’ sounds like a bluegrass standard, with Godman’s fiddle and guest banjo player Patrick Sauber trading solos against a mid-tempo acoustic groove, while Lewis sings about the joys of walking through the forests and mountains.” —J. Poet, East Bay Express\n\nwww.laurielewis.com\n\nwww.facebook.com/laurielewismusic\n\nwww.instagram.com/laurielewismusic\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nLaurie Lewis Releases Title Track of Forthcoming Album – TREES\n\n“Trees” Out Today → https://laurielewis.hearnow.com/trees-2\n\nClick to Watch the Music Video Premiere of “Trees” at Folk Alley\n\nBERKELEY, Calif. — With five decades of music-making to her credit, multi-GRAMMY nominee Laurie Lewis has emerged as both a successor and contemporary of the many greats in bluegrass, old-time, and folk music. Unafraid to venture beyond established boundaries, she has carved out her place as a uniquely singular vocalist, songwriter, instrumentalist, and frontwoman in genres revered for their adherence to tradition, authenticity, and the canon of the forebearers. She’s won IBMA Awards, sung and recorded with Linda Ronstadt, set poems by Wendell Berry to music—at his request. She’s influenced and inspired folks like guitarist phenom Molly Tuttle—one example of an entire generation of pickers and singers who call her a mentor. Ultimately, Lewis occupies a unique, superlative niche in American roots music that is all her own.\n\nLewis’ 24th album, TREES, presents a profound and multifaceted perspective with life, loss, and grief. While deeply ruminative, this set includes danceable music that drips with community and never feels burdened by its subject matter or apparent solitude. These songs—seven originals and a handful of covers—aren’t too concerned with genre, especially given that bluegrass and old-time tend to spout from Lewis like a bubbling mountain spring, in so many distinct manifestations. Self-produced, TREES will be released on Lewis’ own Spruce and Maple Music label on May 31.\n\nLewis has chosen today, Arbor Day, to release the title track from her upcoming album. The a cappella quartet, “Trees” is an imagined message from our fellow inhabitants of this planet, whose sense of time is measured in decades rather than seconds. Lewis says, “The stubbornness and indomitable striving of these providers of the oxygen we breathe give me hope for the future of life on Earth.”\n\nWould you try to turn this whole world into dust?\n\nDon’t you know you cannot wrest the land from us?\n\nFor we are patient, we are old\n\nAnd though we fall, our roots will grow\n\nFolk Alley calls TREES a “stunning new album” and premiered the “Trees” music video. Henry Carrigan writes, “‘Trees’ reminds us just how deeply planted we are in the natural world, and it encourages us to celebrate the moments of joy and to be aware of the enduring beauty that surrounds us in nature and that will be here long after we’re gone.”\n\nAs on many of her past recordings, Lewis finds her music-making rooted in the natural world. As an avid walker, she is both an urban explorer and a wilderness wanderer—plus a self-taught naturalist and conservation activist. Her skillset in songwriting and recording is frequently outward-looking, text-painting to evoke the landscapes she adores and to interpret their voices to us. On TREES, Lewis looks inward instead, while utilizing all of the literary and naturalist skills at her disposal to observe and process seasonal, organic, inevitable life changes.\n\nTREES expresses the emotional turmoil in Lewis’ life at the time of its making. On the upside, there is the unbridled joy of a walk in the mountains, where she spent many a happy day while unable to play music communally during the COVID pandemic. The flip side of that period—and its long wake—includes a six-month period of grappling with the loss of her singing voice, and most notably, the landmark of creating a recording without her musical and life partner, Tom Rozum. The pair met and began making music together in 1986 and for every album since 1989’s Love Chooses You they’ve been credited alongside each other, often in duet. In recent years, Rozum developed Parkinson’s Disease and the illness’s progression has left him unable to play mandolin or guitar, or to tour with Lewis, record, and perform—as they have done, full time, for decades.\n\nGranted, picking up the album will immediately reveal Rozum is still, in fact, credited alongside Lewis, singing harmony vocals and drawing the cover artwork for TREES. The vacuum left by Rozum as a creative partner on these recordings is most perceptible not musically, but in Lewis’ reckoning with that vacuum: naming, processing, and contemplating the losses, myriad and varied, when a lifelong musical partner is forced to step aside. With these intentions and her trademark deliberation, Lewis has framed TREES as a long-play journey, a vinyl trek, inviting each of us to put the needle to the record and join her as she traverses the Sierra Nevada or rafts the Tuolumne River, singing.\n\nHer band has chameleonic quality, varying a bit across the entire sequence. It includes Lewis on guitar and lead vocals throughout (along with fiddle on one track), Hasee Ciaccio on bass, Brandon Godman on fiddle, Patrick Sauber on banjo, and George Guthrie on guitar and banjo. Special guests on the album include Andrew Marlin on mandolin, Sam Reider on accordion, and Nina Gerber on guitar.\n\n“Long Gone” (written by Bill Morrissey) was the first single released and its video was premiered by the Bluegrass Situation and featured in Cowgirl Magazine. That song, along with album opener, “Just a Little Ways Down the Road” (an original, inspired by writings of ecological thinker and environmental advocate John Muir, featuring Marlin on mandolin), feel like classic Laurie Lewis, forward-leaning, categorical bluegrass ready for the radio.\n\nA stand-out track from TREES, among a veritable forest of stellar company, is “Enough,” which concerns California wildfires and the ever-accelerating climate crisis. The song features Guthrie‘s honeyed, low-tuned banjo and Reider‘s cinematic accordion, as well as Guthrie, Ciaccio, and Rozum harmonizing with Lewis, who sings, “I’ve had enough fire, I’ve had enough rain; Lord, I’m so tired of all this pain.”\n\n“Why’d You Have to Break My Heart” is reminiscent of lyrics by Lewis’ friend, mentor, and collaborator Alice Gerrard—timeless, storied, and burnished. Written on the occasion of John Prine’s death, it grapples with grief as a facet of the everyday, instead of an outlier or aberration, utilizing a question Prine asked her, directly—years prior to his loss. More minimal musically—with Lewis on guitar and lead vocals accompanied by Guthrie on lead guitar—the song speaks volumes.\n\n“The Banks are Covered in Blue” is a collaboration with Godman, and Lewis says “Brandon wrote this lovely waltz, and posted it on a social media platform as part of the ‘Quarantune Challenge,’ wherein he had to produce a tune every day for a month during the quarantine. I took a listen, wrote the lyrics, and posted them in the comments. And our first co-write was done!” Premiered by Bluegrass Today, the song is available now exclusively at Bandcamp.\n\nThe nostalgic and uplifting original tune, “Texas Wind,” recalls an incredible rainstorm of the past, while reflecting on present circumstances, and was dubbed a “country love song” by J. Poet of the East Bay Express. Lewis further mixes in a handful of covers on TREES including the upbeat tunes “Quaking Aspen” (featuring Lewis on fiddle, written by Mark Simos), “Hound Dog Blues” (Tom T. Hall), “Down on the Levee” (John Hartford), and “The Day is Mine” (Kate MacLeod).\n\nThe album’s final tune, “Rock the Pain Away,” another highlight of the record, listens like a lullaby, with Lewis’ signature intimacy underscored by her tender, emotional vocal, mixed so close to listeners’ ears it feels like you’re in the booth with her. Here, Lewis’ perspective feels most like a mother tree, an old-growth survivor of wildfires, lightning, and droughts, inviting us to rest beneath her boughs and in the crook of her roots. Gerber joins the band on this gentle song on lead on guitar, while Laurie sings:\n\nLet me hold you for awhile\n\nEnfold you in my arms like a child\n\nAnd if you could let go\n\nAnd if you would let me, you know,\n\nI would try to rock the pain away\n\nTREES is not simply a metaphor or parable; it’s not merely an introspective, emotional inventory; it’s not a performative challenge to the powers and systems that be—powers and systems that leave us alone to encounter, interpret, and reckon with such grief and loss. This LP is all of these things together, at the same time, held in place by a remarkable linchpin and a gorgeous, maternal tree under which all of us can learn, grow, and flourish. Each of us on this beautiful, complicated Earth should count ourselves lucky to encounter TREES as stately and as nurturing as Laurie Lewis.\n\nFor more information and to stay up to date on new from Laurie Lewis, please visit: www.laurielewis.com, www.facebook.com/laurielewismusic, and www.instagram.com/laurielewismusic.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nRiding High From the Success of his Debut Solo Album, Enjoy The Ride\n\nLongtime Co-leader of the Popular & Pioneering Jamgrass Band Leftover Salmon\n\nVince Herman dives into his idea of what country music is all about\n\nVince Herman Band on Tour This Fall\n\nwww.vinceherman.com\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn — Vince Herman is out to have some fun. 33 years after founding Leftover Salmon, Vince released an album of his own and hit the road to play a batch of songs developed in his new Nashville home. It’s a bit of a departure from the “Salmon sound” as he digs into his idea of what country music is. There’s some bluegrass and Cajun influences and honky tonk ballads all piled atop great players taking the tunes for a ride.\n\nVince formed a hot band consisting of some of Nashville’s finest musicians, all also vocalists, to take on the road! Joining him in the Vince Herman Band for their Fall tour dates are Nathan Graham (upright bass), Dakota Holden (pedal steel), Ian Cory (banjo/fiddle), his son Silas Herman (mandolin/guitar), Alex Johnson (drums) [Sept], and Lawrence Nemenz (drums) [October/November].\n\nThe Vince Herman Band Tour kicks off with a free show in Vince’s sometime home state of Colorado, at the Mishawaka Amphitheatre on Sunday, September 10. They then hit up a few points in California before venturing back to the midwest, then a bit of the south, the east, and the southeast. Basically, they’re covering as much as they can in 3 months.\n\n“With his immersion into Nashville, Herman’s also peeling back the pages of Music City history, harkening back to the early days of country music, where the genre lines were blurred or not yet defined by record labels and marketing teams,” writes Rolling Stone’s Garret K. Woodward.\n\n“I’m gonna try to keep my solo repertoire separate from Leftover Salmon so people can expect something different than they would see at a Salmon show,” says Vince to Relix Magazine’s Mike Greenhaus. “I want them to live in different worlds, but one of the reasons I made this record is that I’m a fan of country music. And I’ve always thought of Salmon as a country band. You can look at the Grateful Dead as a country band—to me, bluegrass, cajun music, ballads and all that stuff is what makes up country music… But, though I’ve always seen Salmon as somewhat of a country band, the country and jamband worlds are absolutely miles apart—not so much musically, but culturally. And at this point, so much of this country needs to come together, with all the walls between the different sides and all the perceived little niches that we’re supposed to stay in, man. We need to come together as a country. And music can play a big role in that. So I guess you can say that I want to bring the hippies to country. I want to say, ‘We’re kind of doing the same thing here, folks. Can we talk?’”\n\nVince Herman Band on Tour:\n\nSEPTEMBER\n\n9/10 Sun – Bellevue, CO – Mishawaka Amphitheater\n\n9/14 Thu – Arcata, CA – Humbrews / Humboldt Brews\n\n9/15 Fri – Grass Valley, CA – The Center for the Arts\n\n9/16 Sat – Mill Valley, CA – Sweetwater Music Hall\n\n9/17 Sun – Felton, CA – Santa Cruz Mountain Sol Festival\n\n9/19 Tue – Salt Lake City, UT – The State Room\n\n9/20 Wed – Teton Village, WY – Mangy Moose Restaurant & Saloon\n\nOCTOBER\n\n10/8 Sun – Makanda, IL – Little Grassy Get Down\n\n10/12 Thu – Richmond, VA – Richmond Music Hall at Capital Ale House*\n\n10/13 Fri – Roanoke, VA – 5 Points Music Sanctuary*\n\n10/14 Sat – Huntington, WV – THE LOUD*\n\n10/15 Sun – Morgantown, WV – Mountain Stage Radio Show\n\n10/23 Mon – Tulsa, OK – The Shrine\n\n10/25 Wed – Wichita, KS – Wave\n\n10/26 Thu – Edwardsville, IL – Wildey Theatre\n\n10/27 Fri – Bloomington, IL – The Castle Theatre\n\n10/28 Sat – Evanston, IL – Evanston SPACE\n\n10/29 Sun – Milwaukee, WI – Shank Hall\n\n*w/ Airshow\n\nNOVEMBER^ 11/1 Wed – Carrboro, NC – Cat’s Cradle\n\n11/2 Thu – Charleston, SC – Charleston Pour House\n\n11/3 Fri – Charlotte, NC – Neighborhood Theatre\n\n11/4 Sat – Knoxville, TN – Open Chord Stage\n\n11/5 Sun – Asheville, NC – Asheville Music Hall\n\n11/7 Tue – Lexington, NC – High Rock Outfitters\n\n11/8 Wed – Atlanta, GA – Smith’s Olde Bar\n\n11/9 Thu – Tupelo, MS – Blue Canoe\n\n11/10 Fri – Memphis, TN – Hi Tone\n\n11/11 Sat – Nashville, TN – 3rd & Lindsley Nashville\n\n11/12 Sun – Louisville, KY – Whirling Tiger\n\n11/14 Tue – Newport, KY – The Southgate House Revival\n\n11/15 Wed – Pittsburgh, PA – Thunderbird Café & Music Hall\n\n11/16 Thu- Wayne, PA – 118 North\n\n11/17 Fri – Blairstown, NJ – Roy’s Hall\n\n11/18 Sat – Thomas, WV – The Purple Fiddle\n\n11/19 Sun – York, PA – Appell Center for the Performing Arts\n\n^All November dates w/ Airshow!\n\nVince Herman Other Appearances:\n\n9/22 Fri – Vince Herman + Drew Emmit – Billy Strings Renewal Fest – Buena Vista, CO\n\n10/10 Tue – Handle With Care: A Tribute to Tom Petty – Brooklyn Bowl – Nashville, TN\n\nBenefit for Backline: All Star Band led by Derek Wells w/ songs performed by Wynonna Judd, Brittney Spencer, Charles Wesly Godwin, Sierra Hull, Vince Herman & more\n\nLeftover Salmon Tour Dates: www.leftoversalmon.com/tour\n\nMORE ABOUT THE ALBUM:\n\nEnjoy The Ride, Vince Herman’s first solo record, was released in November 2022 on LoHi Records. During the height of the pandemic, Vince hit the road in his RV for five months and ended up spending half his time in Nashville where he bumped into old friends—Donnie and Chris Davisson of the Davisson Brothers Band.\n\n“I came to Nashville and ran into the Davisson brothers, old buddies from West Virginia I’ve known for a long time,” Herman says. “I connected with the writer community here in town through the Davissons and just ended up writing more in the last year and a half than I probably have the rest of my life. It’s been a really creative boon for me to be in Nashville, so much that I bought a house here, and I’ve got chickens, fruit trees and a garden in my yard. I’m in for the long haul.”\n\nThrough the Davissons, Herman met Erv Woolsey, who probably is best known as George Strait’s manager. Woolsey became his manager and publisher, and like the Davissons, helped facilitate writing sessions for him. It wasn’t long before Herman had “a big pile of songs.”\n\nThen he knew it was time. The Davissons introduced Vince to their producer, David Ferguson [Johnny Cash, John Prine], and a couple of month’s later they took to the Cowboy Arms Hotel and Recording Spa—the studio made famous by the late Cowboy Jack Clement— to record. They tracked all the songs live over 3 days with a myriad of A-list Nashville musicians assembled by Ferguson.\n\nThe studio band features guitarist Pat McLaughlin, multi-instrumentalist Darrell Scott (acoustic guitar, 12-string baritone guitar, banjo), bassist Dave Roe, drummer Pete Abbott, keyboardist Mike Rojas, guitarist and pedal steel player Russ Paul, fiddlers Jason Carter and Bronwyn Keith-Hynes, and Herman’s son Silas on mandolin. Tim O’Brien stopped by the studio during that time to add some harmony vocals.\n\nHerman says. “And boy, I’d never made a record like that before. I’ve always had a band that was together, touring, and, you know, developing the material. To go into the studio with a bunch of folks I didn’t know was a big leap of faith for me and a whole new way of making records. It’s been a real eye opener to see how it’s done here in Nashville. I’m really pleased with the results.”\n\nEnjoy the Ride features a dozen memorable songs, eleven of which came out of Herman’s writing sessions in his new hometown. In addition, to the Davisson brothers, Donnie’s son Nick Davisson, Levi Lowrey, Aaron Raitiere, Phillip Lammonds, Ronnie Bowman, Adam Hood, Rob Snyder, Benny “Burle” Galloway, Channing Wilson, William Paul McDonald, and Dave Pahanish are Herman’s co-writers on the album. He also wrote a pair of songs with Ferguson and Pat McLaughlin.\n\nThe material is an Americana travelogue that takes the listener from Prine-ish country-folk rock (“Lost Lover’s Eyes”), funky swamp rock (“Rattlesnake”) and jazzy Dixieland polka (“Any Other Way”) to straight-up bluegrass (“Enjoy The Ride”), classic Cajun country (“Coraleen”), and traditional country (“Drinking Alone”).\n\nThe one song on the record not cowritten by Herman is the country blues “Flying,” which was penned by Hood, Kyle Tuttle and Roxanne Handley. “That came out of one of the sessions where we had a bunch of guys writing and we’d break into different groups,” Herman explains. “Adam Hood was kind of the main cat behind that one, and I just love that song so much, I had to put it on the record.”\n\nAfter laying down the initial tracks at the Cowboy Arms, additional overdubbing and mixing took place at the Butcher Shack, Ferguson’s post-production facility in Goodlettsville. The overdubbing included some lead vocals by Herman and vocal harmony parts by Bowman, who is best-known as a member of the Lonesome River Band, and Mike Armistead of the Tennessee Mafia Jug Band. Rob McCoury from the Del McCoury Band and Tuttle also overdubbed banjo parts, and George Harper added a trombone part to “Any Other Way.” Additional recording for that song was done in engineer Jake Eckert’s Rhythm Shack Studio in New Orleans, where Tom Fisher and Kevin Louis added clarinet and trumpet respectively.\n\nIt may have taken Herman nearly three decades to get around to making his first solo record, but it was certainly worth the wait. “Enjoy the Ride represents what country music is to me,” he says. “Rooted in tradition but wide open and ready for a good ride.”\n\n“Enjoy the Ride” Lyrics video: www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKFoX9Oxj3o\n\n“Lost Lovers Eyes” (Song art): www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSzaI889v98\n\nwww.vinceherman.com\n\nwww.facebook.com/VinceHermanBand\n\nwww.instagram.com/vincehermanband\n\nwww.youtube.com/@vincehermanband\n\nStream/Buy Enjoy the Ride: https://vinceherman.hearnow.com/enjoy-the-ride\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nAmanda Anne Platt & The Honeycutters New Album Out June 9The album is now on pre-sale → https://clg.lnk.to/Lj4Wo\n\nASHEVILLE, NC –“We’re switching things up a little. After four albums I’ve decided to step out and start using my own name. It’s something that a lot of people have encouraged me to do over the years, and I guess that 2017 just felt right.” That name, Amanda Anne Platt & The Honeycutters, is also the title of the band’s new album, which will be released by Organic Records June 9, 2017. “We’re keeping The Honeycutters too because we don’t want to confuse people… really, we’ve always been Amanda Anne Platt & The Honeycutters. I think I’ve just gotten to a place where I feel comfortable enough to be in the spotlight.”\n\n“Amanda is so good it’s ridiculous. I don’t even know what words to use. Her singing, songwriting and presence is unmatched in Americana, Country, Pop… Simply breathtaking,” said Saul Davis: producer (Percy Sledge), manager (Gene Clark, Carla Olson, Phil Seymour).\n\nLyrically driven, the songs on Amanda Anne Platt & The Honeycutters blend the band’s old-school country roots attitude with their shared influences of rock and folk. Amanda says of the album, “I think it’s just about life and all that that entails. Including but not limited to death, strangers, birthdays, money, leaving, arriving, seasons, corruption, and love.”\n\nPerforming along with Platt, The Honeycutters are Matt Smith on pedal steel and Stratocaster, Rick Cooper on bass, Josh Milligan on drums and harmony vocals, and Evan Martin on keys and Telecaster.\n\nAmanda Anne Platt & The Honeycutters is the group’s third release on Organic Records, and fifth album. Assembling the same the same team as 2016’s On The Ropes, Balsam Range’s Tim Surrett steps in for the second time to co-produce this album along with Amanda. Its thirteen tracks were recorded, mixed, and mastered by Scott Barnett at Crossroads Studios in Arden, NC near the band’s hometown of Asheville, NC.\n\nThere is an empathetic and charming wit ingrained in Amanda’s songwriting. She has a knack for accessing a deep well of emotion and applying it to her story-telling, whether she is writing from her own experiences or immersing herself into the melody of emotions in another person’s life.\n\n“Amanda Platt writes songs on par with Lucinda, Isbell, Lauderdale, Hank Sr. In my opinion, anyway.” said, WNCW’s Music Director Martin Anderson to No Depression.\n\nIn the lead off track, “Birthday Song,” Amanda writes with a gentle optimism, “Every time it gets colder I get another year older… I start looking for lines in the bathroom mirror… but when I lay down at night I swear I must have done something right… cause I’m still so damn glad to be here… I’ve been trying to love the questions, and keep on guessing.” Written just before her 30th birthday, Platt calls the song, “a summation of everything I learned in that decade.”\n\nThere is an easygoing warmth to the album, enhanced by the its refined arrangement and production; from the upbeat “Diamond in the Rough” to the poetic and observational “Eden” to the very personal, yet universal, “Brand New Start” to “Late Summer’s Child” (an ode to her favorite season) and “Rare Thing” (a song commissioned from Platt from a fan as a love song to his wife that ended up being included on the album. “Your mama said that it would never last… but these years go by so fast… and you’re the song I’m humming to myself as I’m counting the miles… you’re such a rare thing.”) One can feel it even in songs with a more solemn concept behind them like, like “Long Ride,” which speaks of living in the moment in the face of mortality.\n\nPlatt wrote “Learning How To Love Him” after hearing an acquaintance of hers talk about learning that her husband of 40+ years was terminally ill. She says, “What really struck me was how she described the tenderness that the news brought back to their relationship.” Amanda sings, “’I woke last night and I felt so afraid, I turned on the light and shook him awake and we stared at the ceiling, listening to the sink drip… I spent my whole life learning how to love him and I never loved him more than I do today.”\n\nThe successes of On The Ropes [2016] and Me Oh My [2015] have propelled Amanda Anne Platt and The Honeycutters onto the national scene and they have been featured on NPR’s World Cafe’s Sense of Place, NPR’s Mountain Stage, Nashville’s Music City Roots, and Folk Alley and they have performed at AmericanaFest, MerleFest, and IBMA. On The Ropes debuted at #39 on iTunes Top 40 Country Chart on release day and landed on a plethora of year end lists including placing #35 on the Top 100 Albums played on Americana Radio in 2016 and landing at #1 on Western North Carolina’s WNCW Radio’s Year End Listeners Poll of Top Albums of 2016!\n\nOn The Ropes hit #11 on the EuroAmericana Chart and The UK’s Julian Piper with Acoustic Magazine says, “Amanda Platt has one of those gorgeous heartache-drenched voices that brings to mind Loretta Lynn or Sheryl Crow.”\n\nAmanda Anne Platt & The Honeycutters plan to tour extensively in US this year and will travel to Europe for the first time in the summer.

Produced and engineered by GRAMMY winner Dirk Powell, the album was recorded in Powell’s studio The Cypress House in Breaux Bridge, LA. It was mixed by Mixed by Scott Vestal at Digital Underground in Greenbrier, TN.\n\nWith an insatiable musical hunger, the members of Town Mountain (Robert Greer on vocals and guitar, Jesse Langlais on banjo and vocals, Bobby Britt on fiddle, Phil Barker on mandolin and vocals, and Nick DiSebastian on bass) made their way to the little south-central Louisiana town of Breaux Bridge, where they recorded their most cohesive, most satisfying album to date. Adam Chaffins* plays bass in the touring outfit.\n\nSouthern Crescent was recorded in a decidedly old-school way, live, with minimal fixes and overdubs, with all the musicians in the same room and no noise-reducing baffling between them. Each of Town Mountain’s members contributed songs to Southern Crescent, with Barker, Langlais and Greer the chief writers in the band.\n\nFrom the boogie-woogie piano of Jerry Lee Lewis that inspired the delightful (and danceable) “Coming Back to You,” to Greer’s cleverly penned and fast-paced “Tick on a Dog,” which offers a taste of another major bluegrass influence, Jimmy Martin, Southern Crescent is tailor-made to keep live audiences on their feet, but it’ll also keep those who think they can easily peg Town Mountain on their toes.\n\nThat variety is indeed part of what drives Southern Crescent, which opens with Britt’s delightfully dizzying fiddle work on “St. Augustine,” and showcases Greer’s hard-country vocals on “House With No Windows” and on the freewheeling composition “Ain’t Gonna Worry Me,” (penned by Barker). The group members’ palpable chemistry (and individual artistry) are displayed throughout such instantly memorable tracks as “Wildbird,” (Barker) and “I Miss the Night,” which Langlais penned (with Mark Bumgarner) after experiencing 22 hours of daylight during Alaska’s summer solstice.\n\nThe new album is being released on LoHi Records. Based in Greensboro, N.C., the label is a partnership formed by entrepreneur and marketing veteran Jim Brooks with singer/songwriter and record producer Todd Snider, record producer Tim Carbone (who also plays fiddle in newgrass band Railroad Earth) and Chad Staehly from Gold Mountain Entertainment in Nashville.\n\nGo Behind The Scenes with Town Mountain In “The Making of Southern Crescent” → https://youtu.be/VZD7avVtI4U\n\nListen to the world premier of “Comin’ Back to You” at The Bluegrass Situation → www.thebluegrasssituation.com/read/listen-town-mountain-comin-back-you\n\nWhat Folks Are Saying about Town Mountain and Southern Crescent:\n\n“Produced by Dirk Powell, Southern Crescent is hard-charging, grits-and-gravy authentic, the kind of emotions on the strings of Bill Monroe and Flatts and Scruggs pioneered more than 60 years ago. But Town Mountain is no copy band. With Songs written by each band member, and instrumental and vocal originality, Town Mountain honors the Ancients while bringing a collective and generational identity to their art.” —Raleigh News & Observer, Jack Bernhardt\n\n“Southern Crescent reflects the band’s loose, dance-able music, more reflective of their festival and club sets that a staid performing arts center straight-bluegrass set. I’m not sure if the Southern Crescent still runs from Atlanta to Boston like my relatives talked about taking to go ‘visit culture’ in the Northeast, but I’m fairly sure it still runs down to New Orleans, where a more exhilarating culture has endured — an apt analogy for this album.” –Listen to this podcast interview with Town Mountain about Southern Crescent on Country Fried Rock with Sloane Spencer → http://countryfriedrock.org/town-mountain-1606/#.Vv09AnBKhaU\n\n“On Southern Crescent, there’s little fuss and pretension, as each track has a lived-in and live feel, with the band members coalescing around the song in an almost preordained way. There is as much outlaw country and Western swing to these songs as bluegrass, despite the instrumentation. As traditional and even-keeled as Town Mountain is, no other band sounds quite the same.” —Mountain Xpress, Kyle Petersen\n\n“I have seen this band many times, and while there are a couple of bigger names out there, this Asheville group is the most exciting bluegrass band to come along in a long time” –-No Depression, Amos Perrine\n\n“Southern Crescent is a near-perfect balance of tradition and young, raw energy… They’ll hear a hundred years of southern musical culture bubbling up and finding a common point where North Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana meet as old friends. Town Mountain’s style and sonic footprint comes from a foundation of rhythm and groove that comes not from just loving the music (that’s too easy) but from living the music.” —Stream to the Premier of the song “Wildbird” at Bluegrass Today, Brian Swenk\n\n“The record features an expected dose of fast string picking, including the opening fiddle workout ‘St. Augustine,’ but as it unfolds it becomes a well-rounded effort full of front-porch song craft that touches on various shades of roots music. ‘Leroy’s Reel’ has a distinctly Cajun flavor, while ‘Comin’ Back to You’ is a rockabilly dance tune propelled by some boogie-woogie piano.” —Blue Ridge Outdoors, Jedd Ferris\n\n“By the time they arrive at ‘Whiskey With Tears,’ one is ready to recommend them to country radio not because they sound like they belong there, but because you wish radio sounded like Town Mountain.”–Fervor Coulee, Donald Teplyske\n\n“From the fiddle filled, energetic instrumental opener, ‘St. Augustine’ to the carefree ‘Ain’t Gonna Worry Me’ bluegrass sensibilities merge with roots, rock and country in melodies that will not only make you sit up and listen – they’ll have you getting up and moving as well.” —The Daily Country, Tara Joan\n\n“There are a lot of bluegrass and country bands out there but only a few really have the ability to pull off what Ricky Skaggs and Tony Rice pulled off… Town Mountain, a band out of Asheville NC, does though and they prove it song after song. A bit more country here and a bit more bluegrass there makes the music as roots as you can get.” –-Frank Gutch Jr., Bob Segarini Blog\n\nTown Mountain’s Southern Crescent Tour 2016:\n\n4/1 Fri – The Grey Eagle – Asheville, NC\n\n4/2 Sat – Newgrass Brewing Company – Shelby, NC\n\n4/5 Tue – Hampton Taphouse – Hampton, VA\n\n4/6 Wed – Gypsy Sally’s – Washington, DC\n\n4/7 Thu – Lizard Lounge – Cambridge, MA\n\n4/8 Fri – Hill Country BBQ – New York, NY\n\n4/9 Sat – The Hobo Stage – Fredon, NJ\n\n4/10 Sun – Tin Angel – Philadelphia, PA\n\n4/12 Tue – Haymarket Whiskey Bar – Louisville, KY\n\n4/13 Wed – Cosmic Charlie’s – Lexington, KY\n\n4/14 Thu – The Station Inn – Nashville, TN\n\n4/15 Fri – Barley’s – Knoxville, TN\n\n4/16 Sat – Waverly “Old 280” Boogie – Waverly, AL\n\n4/17 Sun – Zydeco – Birmingham, AL\n\n4/28 Thu – Independent Ale House – Greenville, SC\n\n4/30 Sat – UNC – Chapel Hill, NC\n\n5/13 Fri – KSUT Concert Series @ Henry Strater Theatre – Durango, CO\n\n5/14 Sat – Denver Beer Co.’s Sundrenched Music Festival – Denver, CO\n\n5/14 Sat – Ophelia’s Electric Soapbox – Denver, CO (After party with Hot Buttered Run)\n\n5/21 Sat – The Pour House – Charleston, SC (with Peter Rowan)\n\n5/22 Sun – Lincoln Theatre – Raleigh, NC (supporting Hard Working Americans)\n\n5/24 Tue – The Orange Peel – Asheville, NC (supporting Hard Working Americans)\n\n5/25 Wed – Minglewood Hall – Memphis, TN (supporting Hard Working Americans)\n\n5/27 Fri – White Squirrel Festival – Brevard, NC\n\n5/28 Sat – Rooster Walk – Martinsville, VA\n\n6/1 Wed – Music City Roots – Nashville, TN\n\n6/3 Fri – Bailey Park – Winston-Salem, NC\n\n6/5 Sun – Nelsonville Music Festival\n\n6/11 Sat – Festival of the Bluegrass – Lexington, KY\n\n6/16 Thu – Back Porch Music Series – Durham, NC\n\n6/23 Thu – Rudyfest 16 – Grayson, KY\n\n6/24 Fri – ROMP Fest – Owensboro, KY\n\n7/23 Sat – Homegrown Music Festival – Ozark, AR\n\n8/5 Sat – Pickathon – Happy Valley, OR\n\nFor more information, please visit TownMountain.net, facebook.com/TownMountain, twitter.com/TownMountain, and instagram.com/townmountainbluegrass.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThe Honeycutters, an Asheville-based American Country Roots Band,Release 4th Studio Album, On The Ropes,\n\nMay 20, 2016 on Organic RecordsA Special Vinyl Edition On The Ropes Featured as a National Release\n\nfor Record Store Weekin partnership with Select-O-Hits\n\non ‘Vinyl Tuesday’ April 12thPre-order starting April 1st at iTunesGet the vinyl at Tower Records, Select-O-Hits, and AmazonTune into NPR’s World Cafe Thursday, March 31st to hear The Honeycutters → www.worldcafe.npr.org\n\nASHEVILLE, NC — The Honeycutters have a voice you can’t ignore; a voice of persistence, of struggle and of hope, a voice that leads the new music movement erupting out of Asheville, NC. Poised to release their 4th studio album On The Ropes May 20, 2016 on Organic Records, Nashville’s Music City Roots’ Craig Havighurst says principal songwriter and frontwoman, Amanda Anne Platt “has a voice that’s complex, sweet and aching. Even more potently, she writes songs that folks are citing as up there with the best of the field, such as Mary Gauthier and Lucinda Williams.” Along with Platt, The Honeycutters are Rick Cooper (electric and upright bass), Josh Milligan (drums and vocal harmonies), Matt Smith (pedal steel and electric guitar), and Tal Taylor (mandolin). On The Ropes was produced by Amanda Anne Platt and Tim Surrett and engineered and mastered by Van Atkins at Crossroads Studios in Arden, NC.\n\n“Fitting in at country honky-tonks and hard-scrabble bars alike, the Honeycutters have built a reputation for high energy shows coupled with tight harmonies and wistfully delicate lyrics of longing, heartbreak, and the American experience,” writes Alan Cackett (UK).\n\nIn On The Ropes Platt continues to bring songs of heartache, yearning, and comebacks using phrases so relatable you wish you had thought of them yourself, ”Love ain’t ever black and white, it’s pink and gray and blue besides” (“Blue Besides”).\n\nPlatt’s writing is always personal. The title track, “On The Ropes,” is a rally song about coming back from hard knocks. “When I’m down for the count there’s a voice I can’t ignore,” like a continuous conversation with herself, pushing her along and encouraging her to make “something out of nothing.”\n\nIn a recent interview with David Dye of the World Cafe, Dye pointed out Platt’s string of songs with ‘love gone wrong’ themes. Her response, “Doesn’t everyone have stories of love gone wrong?” Part of Amanda’s significance as a songwriter lies in her ability to write everybody’s story and allow each listener to feel it’s theirs alone. She shares songs of love and loss, songs of struggles and fears; in “The Only Eyes” Amanda writes, “If there were an easier road that wasn’t so crooked, Honey, I hope you know I would have took it.” NPR’s World Cafe, produced by XPN in Philadelphia, brought the show to Asheville’s The Grey Eagle this February for a sold out evening of entertainment including The Honeycutters in their “Sense of Place” series. The airdate for The Honeycutters’ World Cafe segment is Thursday, March 31st during the first hour of the show.\n\nThe power of Amanda’s songwriting requires musicianship with the kind of edginess needed to match it, to cohesively surround the lyrics in just the right skin while still shining in their individual performances.\n\nAlternating between upright and, new to this album, electric bass, Rick Cooper accentuates the band’s delve deeper into a rock sound blending with their old-school country roots attitude. Along with drummer Josh Milligan the two create a powerful pocket and groove that locks the album together, with Milligan’s vocal harmonies complementing and enhancing Platt’s lead. The pedal steel work of Matt Smith brings unexpected rock licks on an instrument traditionally reserved for a classic country sound in tracks like “Blue Besides” and “Only Eyes”. Smith also shows his prowess on electric guitar with rock, and R&B flavored runs and solos like in “Golden Child”. Tal Taylor’s mandolin cuts through with bitey, bluesy notes and fierce tremolo that pushes the instrument beyond its obvious folk appeal.\n\nOn The Ropes has thirteen tracks of all original material with the exception of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah,” a song Amanda has been playing since before she moved to Asheville. She says, “We’ve had a number of people ask us to record our version, so here ’tis.” Special guests on the album include Amanda’s father Mark Platt on harmonica, Jeff Collins on piano, and Jason Webb on Hammond B-3 Organ. “The Handbook” features the lovely ladies of Sweet Claudette on vocals: Dulci Ellenberger, Melissa Hyman, and Amber L. Sims.\n\nA special vinyl edition of On the Ropes will be released April 12, 2016 on Vinyl Tuesday, as a featured national release for Record Store Week. This will include a double album released through Organic Records®’ national distribution partner Select-O-Hits. This vinyl album will be made available to independent record stores throughout the country in time for Record Store Day on April 16th. Vinyl Mastering by Scott Barnett at Crossroads Studios / Arden, NC and Jeff Powell at Take Out Vinyl, Memphis, TN.\n\nOn The Ropes builds on the critical success of The Honeycutters breakout album Me Oh My [Organic Records 2015], which appeared on over twenty “2015 Year End Lists” including nods from No Depression, “It’s the type of country music you’d play on the jukebox and take a spin on a red dirt floor” and Cleveland Scene, “an upbeat symphony of regret, redemption and resurgence.” The album was voted #3 on WNCW’s Top 100 Listeners Poll (Under Jason Isbell and Alabama Shakes), listed in NPR’s Folk Alley’s Top 50, and was one of KBCS’s “Most Played Albums of 2015.”\n\nIn their “50 Essential Albums for 2015” list, Saving Country Music writes, “Me Oh My is the 14-song testament that you sense could be the centerpiece of her career when it’s all said and done… This is a band, an album, and a songwriter that both the Americana and country world should pay greater attention to.” Me Oh My launched The Honeycutters onto the national stage, bringing along an army of fans with them. Don’t blink now, they’re coming back for more.\n\nIt has been said that overnight success is a result of long time dedication and hard work. Amanda writes, in “Golden Child,” her love letter to the music industry, “Now I don’t mind if it takes a little time, when it comes to waiting I’ve been practicing for years.”\n\nOn The Ropes – Track Listing\n\n1.

It’s not just the sorrow and sincerity, it’s the insight and the resonance. Songs like ‘All You Ever’ and ‘Not That Simple’ exemplify this top shelf quality to her music, while the mood of Me Oh My very much takes on the perspective of a young woman moving ever so closer to middle age, and mindful of not just the changes in herself, but in the world as it reflects back on her.”\n\n—Saving Country Music\n\nASHEVILLE, NC — The Honeycutters, an Asheville, NC-based original country roots band, released their third studio album, Me Oh My, on April 21, 2015 with Organic Records® and is thrilled to announce their 2015 summer tour.\n\nThey kick off the tour in the south and have an appearance on WDVX’s Tennessee Shines in Knoxville on July 1st airing worldwide at 7pm CT at WDVX.com, followed by a show on the 3rd at the US National Whitewater Center in Charlotte, NC with Greensky Bluegrass. They travel west for a several shows with stops in Kansas City, Colorado’s Front Range, Albuquerque, Oklahoma City, Kansas and Arkansas. After a short break, picking back up again for further shows in the southern region including a performance at the Birthplace of Country Music Museum in Bristol, TN in mid August.\n\nFueled by the powerful songwriting and vocals of founder Amanda Anne Platt, Me Oh My moves her into the spotlight as producer, band leader, and principal creative force behind the band.

Even more potently, she writes songs that folks are citing as up there with the best of the field, such as Mary Gauthier and Lucinda Williams.” —Craig Havighurst, Music City Roots\n\n“There are a lot of worthy and compelling Americana singer-songsters and bands out there right now, it’s a rich landscape. But The Honeycutters, fronted by Amanda Platt is surely a wonder to behold. The band just sounds so darn good and makes a style of country music that always makes me feel good, even when it’s so melancholy. I think Amanda has something to teach us about the economy of words, the magic of a good melody and the satisfaction of an aching and honest vocal.” —Amy Ray of The Indigo Girls “With singer/songwriter — and, now, producer — Amanda Anne Platt at the helm, the group puts their own spin on an old form. Sure, there’s a timeless quality to honest songs done up by a bunch of great players… there’s also a freshness to it.” —Folk Alley First Listen, Kelly McCartney “It’s easy to think of Mags Bennett, the character played by Margo Martindale on TV’s Justified, when listening to Amanda Anne Platt front North Carolina quartet the Honeycutters. Steadfast, independent and all woman…” –-Pop Matters, Eric Risch“Me Oh My, an extremely balanced album in terms of tempo and theme, merges Americana, roots, country and even honky tonk into a delightfully unique combination. It’s a highly recommended, refreshing and enjoyable listen from the first track to the last.” —The Daily Country, Tara Joan\n\n“Me Oh My… is a like a time machine on a shiny disc; classic, old-timey country and folk tunes with catchy melodies and lyrics that drip in poetry.” ––That Music Mag, Jane Roser\n\n“Platt’s rootsy sense of melody and strong lyrical instincts are heard throughout Me Oh My, with the inviting southern swing of ‘Jukebox’ and the ballad title track serving as particular stand-outs.” —Alex Biese, Asbury Park Press\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nAsheville-based American Country Roots Band, The Honeycutters, Set to Release 3rd Studio Album, Me Oh My, on Tue, April 21, 2015 With Organic Record Company“… just superb, with a sweet toned and melodious aura… Today’s Smoky Mountain area modern folk thing does have a certain vibe, and these guys are among its finest purveyors.” –Music City Roots’ Craig Havighurst\n\n“Their music embodies a very catchy, accessible, optimistic sort of spirit so frequently lacking in folk circles (where brooding, hyper-analytical music reigns supreme). What’s more, like Carolina Story, they’re a great band replete with tasty harmonies.” –Folk Music About.com’s Kim Ruehl\n\nAnnouncing Spring and Summer Tour Throughout the Southeast and Into the Northeast\n\nThe Honeycutters, an Asheville, NC-based original country roots band, is set to release their third studio album, Me Oh My, on April 21, 2015 with Organic Records®. Fueled by the powerful songwriting and vocals of founder Amanda Platt, Me Oh My moves her into the spotlight as producer, band leader, and principal creative force behind the band. With songs that are honest and relatable, part chagrin and part hope, Platt’s voice carries a timeless appeal. Pre-sales for the album have launched on iTunes and include four immediate tracks to download off the fourteen track release. They have announced tour dates throughout the southeast and into the northeast this spring and summer; more dates will be announced.\n\nLed by songwriter Amanda Anne Platt, The Honeycutters include Tal Taylor on mandolin, Rick Cooper on bass, Josh Milligan on drums, and Matt Smith rounds out the band on pedal steel, electric guitar, and dobro to create a sound that carries just as well across the bar room as in a church or a theater. Platt’s songs are shaped by a raw honesty that comes straight from the heart and emits a sort of melancholy happiness.\n\nMe Oh My is threaded with themes of love, loss, acceptance and regrowth. It kicks off with an engaging southern swingin’ song, “Jukebox,” that is about taking life one day at a time and not taking yourself too seriously saying “it’s only a song, so for heaven’s sake won’t you sing along?” The title cut is an inspirational anthem about the state of the modern woman, stating, “Some girls marry and some girls wait.” Me Oh My brings more of what fans love about The Honeycutters, honestly written songs sung in Platt’s authentic voice. The up-tempo, beer-raising, danceable “Ain’t It The Truth” is one that will fuel audiences at live shows while melancholy ballads like “Texas ’81” balance the album both in meter and mood. The upbeat “I’ll Be Lovin’ You” as a whole speaks to holding someone up until they are strong enough to stand on their own. Me Oh My delves deeper into the darker realms of love with “Little Bird” which gained Platt notoriety as it was chosen as a finalist at MerleFest’s prestigious Chris Austin Songwriting Contest (2011).\n\nPlatt self produced the album along with the help of engineer and assistant producer Jon Ashley. The album was recorded in Echo Mountain Recording Studio and Mixtown Studio in Asheville, NC and it was mixed and mastered just down the road at Crossroads Studios in Arden, NC.\n\n“The new album is the one I’m most proud of to date.” Platt says, “I took much more of a driver’s seat in it’s making, and the process has forced me to do a lot of growing up… I feel like I’ve really found my voice. I’m very excited about the line up of the band, and the songwriting includes some of my very favorites.”\n\nThe Honeycutters on Tour 4/2 Thu – Robert Ferst Theatre Amphitheatre – Atlanta, GA\n\n4/3 Fri – Mars Theatre – Springfield, GA\n\n4/17 Fri – Isis Music Hall – Asheville, NC\n\n4/18 Sat – Shakori Hills GrassRoots Festival – Silk Hope, NC\n\n4/22 Wed – Music City Roots – Nashville, TN\n\n4/24 Fri – MerleFest – Wilkesboro, NC\n\n5/2 Sat – Sylvia Theater – York, SC\n\n5/3 Sun – Eddie’s Attic – Decatur, GA\n\n5/8 Fri – The Willow Tree – Johnson City, TN\n\n5/9 Sat – Barley’s – Knoxville TN\n\n5/14 Thu – The Double Door Inn – Charlotte, NC\n\n5/15 Fri – Bourgie Nights – Wilmington, NC >\n\n6/4 Thu – The ArtsCenter – Carrboro, NC\n\n6/5 Fri – Sails Music Series – Hickory, NC\n\n6/17 Sun – 10th Ave Burrito Co. – Belmar, NJ\n\n6/18 – Thu – Rockwood Music Hall 2 – New York, NY *\n\n6/20 Sat – Rochester International Jazz Festival – Rochester, NY\n\n6/21 Sun – Mechanic Street House – Cleveland, OH\n\n8/21 Fri – Summer Tracks Rogers Park Amphitheater – Tryon, NC\n\n8/22 Sat- Cataloochee Ranch – Maggie Valley, NC\n\n> w/ Massive Grass\n\n* w/ The Hillbenders\n\nFor more information about The Honeycutters and further tour dates, please visit: www.thehoneycutters.com.
