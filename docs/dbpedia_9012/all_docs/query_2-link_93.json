        "text": "Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Laurie Lewis will performing Friday at The Old Steeple in Ferndale, followed by a performance by Emmy-winning cellist and composer Ben Sollee on Sunday.\n\nFor Lewis, the traditions of bluegrass and folk aren’t so much tools in her hands, but burning sources of inspiration that have driven her through 30-year career at the forefront of American roots music.\n\nSince her debut in 1986, Lewis has recorded over 20 albums, was a founding member of the Good Ol’ Persons and the Grant Street String Band and has twice been voted the International Bluegrass Music Association’s Female Vocalist of the Year. She contributed fiddle and vocal performances for True Life Blues: The Songs of Bill Monroe, which won a Grammy in 1997 for Best Bluegrass Album. More recently, her latest album with band The Right Hands, “The Hazel and Alice Sessions,” was nominated for the Best Bluegrass Recording Grammy in 2017.\n\nOver the last two decades, Sollee has distinguished himself as multi-faceted creative, blurring the lines between music, tech and experiential design. As a cellist, songwriter and storyteller he has toured the globe, sometimes by bicycle, performing his original music.\n\nAs a composer, Sollee has created music for stage, screen and virtual reality apps earning an Emmy Award for his 2018 score for “Base Ballet.” As a producer, he has curated hundreds of live events including experiences for the Speed Art Museum and Lincoln Center. Throughout it all, he has continued to advocate for people and the land by creating and curating experiences that grow a greater sense of togetherness.\n\nOther upcoming shows at The Old Steeple include experimental future-folk project Particle Kid (Micah Nelson) on Nov. 11 and Brennen Leigh & Sunny Sweeney on Dec. 9.\n\nConcerts start at 7:30 p.m. with doors opening at 6:30 p.m. Concert tickets are available at Mind’s Eye Manufactory in Ferndale, Wildberries Marketplace in Arcata, online at FerndaleMusicCompany.com or by calling 707-786-7030.\n\nThe Old Steeple is located at 246 Berding St. in Ferndale."
