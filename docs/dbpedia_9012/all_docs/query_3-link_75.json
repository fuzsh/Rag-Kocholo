Brilliant\n\nTTh 12:30 -2\n\n240 Mulford\n\nClass # 23049\n\n4 units\n\nDiscussion sections: M 10-11; W 3-4\n\nFrom the moment that scientists first split the atom in the 1930s, “going nuclear” has conjured up dystopian fears alongside utopian hopes—from mushroom clouds, reactor meltdowns, Superfund sites, and planetary annihilation, on the one hand, to cancer treatment, war deterrence, job creation, and planetary salvation through clean energy, on the other hand. Through an exploration of these and other examples of the utopian/dystopian (or, hopeful/frightful) understandings of “going nuclear” in twentieth century American history and culture, this course will introduce students to the concepts and methods of American Studies as an interdisciplinary field of study.\n\nLetters and Science 40E – Learning From Disney\n\nInstructor: K. Moran\n\nMW 4-6\n\n141 McCone\n\nClass # 31265\n\n4 units\n\nDiscussion Sections: Please see Schedule of Classes\n\nThe word “Disney” refers to a man who died in 1966, a film studio that became a global media corporation, six amusement parks/resorts, an oeuvre of audio-visual texts with hundreds of characters and millions of associated products, and a theory of space and landscape design. The word also suggests a set of ideological messages about gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and nationhood. Recently, it has also been made into a verb. According to the Oxford English Dictionary “to disnify” means “to alter in a way considered characteristic of Disney films, cartoons, or theme parks; to romanticize, sanitize, or simplify.” And scholars now use the terms “disneyfication” or “disneyization” to describe the way that the principles of Disney theming have increasingly come to dominate economic sectors and place-making in the U.S. and in the rest of the world.\n\nThis course will focus on all things “Disney” to introduce students to the study of American history, Hollywood films as cultural representations, and the American built environment. Specific topics will include 1.) Americanized fairy tales and theories of childhood, 2.) the Hollywood Studio system and forms of modern labor, 3.) post WWII urban planning, suburbanization and white flight, 4.) representations of race, gender, sexuality, and family, 5.) theming, immersion and the experience economy, and 6.) hyper-consumerism and branding.\n\nAfrican American Studies 27AC – Race, Racism, and Resistance in the United States\n\nInstructor: M. Cohen\n\nTTh 12:30-2\n\n100 Genetics and Plant Biology\n\nClass # 23483\n\n3 units\n\nDiscussion Sections: Please see Schedule of Classes\n\nThis course explores the role of race, racism and resistance in the United States from 1492 to the present. We do this by reading autobiographical works written by racial justice activists alongside works in the theory of racial formations. Together we ask: What is race? How do we define and recognize racism? How has race shaped the lives of Americans historically classified as minorities? And how have anti-racist intellectuals represented the personal and political struggles of racialized communities living in a white majority culture? To answer these questions we focus on the intersections of race, class and gender; immigration, labor and democracy; and the history of resistance to racial oppression from abolition to liberation and back.\n\nTIME COURSES\n\nAmerican Studies 101 – Dust and Chrome: America and the 1930s\n\nInstructor: A. Craghead\n\nMW 2-4\n\n141 Giannini\n\nClass #24926\n\n4 units\n\nHow did the 1930s shape us, and how does it continue to do so? This decade was defined by crisis after crisis, from the economic hardships of the Great Depression, to political protest and deep labor unrest, to vast ecological disaster and the seeming demise of democracy around the globe. Despite this—or perhaps because of this—the period was rich in technological, cultural, and social development. How did this decade of crisis help form a new kind of modernity, one that continues to reverberate in our world today?\n\nOur task is to try and answer this question. To do so, we will examine the material and representational cultures of the period, such as new technologies of the era (both imagined and realized), popular entertainments (music, novels, and Hollywood films), the arts (folk arts, handicrafts, and the “fine” arts); and examples of the work of planners, architects, and industrial designers (consumer products, buildings, even whole cities both built and unbuilt). Through these and other examples, we will develop a better understanding of the relationship between crisis and creativity, and how different people used space, place, and representations to attempt to exert power over politics, wealth, and the American imagination itself.\n\nAmerican Studies 101 – A History of the Present: The U.S. After 9/11\n\nInstructor: M. Cohen\n\nMW 2-4\n\n155 Anthro/Art Practice Building\n\nClass #25804\n\n4 units\n\nThis interdisciplinary course explores the history of the United States since 9/11/2001. Using historical and cultural studies methods to study the recent past, we will take on the political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and cultural changes that have remade America within our own lifetimes. This era has been characterized by an almost permanent state of crisis in which our democracy, our health and sanity, our jobs and relationships, and our planet all feel on the verge of collapse. The origins of this present crisis is our primary topic. Key subjects include the long war on terror, the financial crisis within global capitalism, race and the culture wars of the Obama era, America’s widening political polarization, and the impact of climate change on our bodies, landscapes, and culture. Together, we will reconsider the history of a past that we have all somehow survived and must continue to live through.\n\nAmerican Studies C111E– The Seventies\n\nInstructor: S. Saul\n\nTTh 8-9:30\n\n101 Barker\n\nClass #23439\n\n4 units\n\nCross-listed with English C136\n\nAs one writer quipped, it was the worst of times, it was the worst of times. “The Seventies” routinely come in for mockery as an era of bad taste — an era when enormous sideburns, leisure suits, extra-wide bell bottoms, pet rocks, and “diet” mackerel pudding made sense to all too many Americans. Even at the time, the 1970s were known as the decade when “it seemed like nothing happened.” Yet we can see now that the ’70s was a time of great cultural renaissance and political ferment. Cultural historian Thomas Hine calls the decade “the great funk” because it was a time when America was both out-of-sorts and bursting with new energies. The ’70s gave us the New Hollywood of Scorcese, Coppola and others; the “New Journalism” of Michael Herr, Joan Didion, and others; the music of funk, disco, punk and New Wave; the postmodern comedy of Saturday Night Live and the postmodern drama of Off-Off-Broadway; and a great range of literary fiction written by women authors from Ursula LeGuin and Margaret Atwood to Toni Morrison and Maxine Hong Kingston. Rather than simply being a transitional period between the “liberal” 1960s and “conservative” 1980s, the ’70s were in fact a period of intense political realignment, with the United States roiled by the oil crisis, the fall of Nixon and the fall of Saigon; by the advent of women’s liberation, gay liberation, and environmentalism as mass grassroots movements; and by the rise of the Sunbelt and the dawning of the conservative revolution. One might even say that the ’70s were the most interesting decade of the post-WWII era — the period when the freedom dreams of the ‘60s were most intensely fulfilled even as a resurgent conservative movement challenged their underlying vision. Lastly, the ’70s may be the 20th-c. decade closest to our own contemporary moment. We will consider how the roots of our current predicament lie in the earlier decade — with its backlash against movements for racial justice and gender equality, its gun culture, its corruption of the political process, its suspicion of the state, its transition to a postindustrial economy, its widening inequality, its fetish for self-fulfillment, and its fascination with the appeal of instant celebrity. We will, in turn, reflect on how Americans in the ’70s struggled with many of the dilemmas that we face now.\n\nAmerican Studies 110—The New Gilded Age\n\nInstructor: M. Brilliant\n\nT 2-5\n\n204 Dwinelle\n\nClass # 23463\n\n4 units\n\nThe “new Gilded Age” is a term that scholars, pundits, and activists in recent years have used to refer to the sharp increase in economic inequality in the United States, the increasing concentration of income and wealth in the hands of the nation’s top 10 percent of income earners. The roots of this watershed in recent American history are many and run deep. This course will excavate some of those roots and their corresponding explanations, examining the origins of America’s new Gilded Age by focusing on major transformations in economics, politics, and education in the 1970s and 1980s. Along the way, we will also consider some of the social experiences and cultural expressions of Americans as they lived through the origins of America’s new Gilded Age.\n\nPLACE COURSES\n\nAmerican Studies 102AC– Berkeley in the (18)60s: Uncovering the Origins of a Public University\n\nInstructor: S. Gold McBride\n\nTTh 11-12:30\n\n241 Cory\n\nClass # 23704\n\n4 units\n\nThis course fulfills the PLACE and PRE-1900 American Studies major requirements, as well as the American Cultures requirement.\n\nDuring the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, UC Berkeley was more than just California’s flagship public university. It became a potent and often powerful cultural symbol. To invoke Berkeley or Cal became shorthand for academic excellence, or transformative student activism, or radical politics, or the devastating power of nuclear war. But when the university was founded over one hundred and fifty years ago, it was, simply, the University of California: California’s first land grant university, tasked with the responsibility of educating the people of the country’s then-westernmost state. Yet from its inception, the University of California’s purpose was fraught, contested, and contingent. The founding Organic Act proclaimed that the state would build this new university on “donat[ed] land” that was granted “to the State of California under and by the provisions of an Act of Congress”—yet this land was composed of over 2,300 uncompensated Indigenous land parcels. What—and whom—was the University of California actually for?\n\nThis small, experiential-learning-focused course will combine lectures, readings, campus field trips, and extensive hands-on work with documents from university archives and library collections as we examine UC Berkeley’s first fifty years—from its founding in 1868 through the establishment of the system’s second campus, a southern branch in Los Angeles, in 1919. In this class, Berkeley students will become Berkeley scholars as we engage in a critical examination of early Berkeley as a place, and consider both the formation of the institution’s cultural meaning and how it has changed over time. By combining history, geography, material culture, and popular media, our interdisciplinary study of early Berkeley will consider what the early history of this campus can teach us about politics, public education, race, gender, class, colonialism, identity, and power in the United States.\n\nAmerican Studies C112 — American Landscape: Place, Power, and Culture\n\nInstructor: A. Craghead\n\nTTh 9:30-11\n\n141 Giannini\n\nClass #31522\n\n4 units\n\nDiscussion sections: T 1-2; Th 1-2\n\nCross-listed with Geography C160\n\nWhat is America as a landscape and a place, and how do we know it when we see it? In the present moment, marked by struggles over economic, environmental, and social division played out in space and place, such questions are imperative.\n\nThis course seeks to address such questions, to introduce ways of seeing and interpreting American histories and cultures, as revealed in everyday built surroundings—homes, highways, farms, factories, stores, recreation areas, small towns, city districts, and regions. It does so through the lens of cultural geography, an interdisciplinary practice that developed, in part, here at Berkeley during the 20th century. Our goal in this course is thus twofold: First, to develop a kind of literacy in the role of space and place in American culture, and second to develop a working knowledge of cultural geography as a practice and then to use those skills to better see the world around us.\n\nAmerican Studies C171- The American Designed Landscape Since 1850\n\nInstructor: L. Mozingo\n\nTTh 3:30-5\n\n101 Wurster\n\nClass # 20973\n\n4 units\n\nCross-listed with Landscape Architecture C171\n\nThis course surveys the history of American landscape architecture since 1850 in four realms: 1) urban open spaces–that is squares, plazas, parks, and recreation systems; 2) urban and suburban design; 3) regional and environmental planning; 4) gardens. The course will review the cultural and social contexts which have shaped and informed landscape architecture in the United States since the advent of the public parks movement, as well as, the aesthetic precepts, environmental concerns, horticultural practices, and technological innovations of American landscapes. Students will complete a midterm, final, and a research assignment.\n\nAmerican Studies 102 – Constructing a Settler Colonial History of Architecture\n\nInstructor: C. Davis\n\nF 9-12\n\n170 Wurster\n\nClass #24927\n\n4 units\n\nCross-listed with Architecture 179\n\nThis course challenges students to develop a settler colonial critique of “American Architecture” using rubrics from American Studies, Whiteness Studies, critical race theory, and architectural history. Students will develop a racial critique of canonical examples of American architecture using papers stored in the Environmental Design Archives, as well as mine local and digital archives to recover the contributions of women, sexual minorities, and people of color.\n\nPRE-1900 COURSES\n\nAmerican Studies 102AC — Berkeley in the (18)60s: Uncovering the Origins of a Public University\n\nInstructor: S.

Taylor\n\nMW 10-12\n\n166 Social Sciences Building\n\nClass # 25537\n\n4 units\n\nThis course will examine the origins of the African slave trade, and explore political, economic, demographic and cultural factors shaping African American life and culture prior to 1865.\n\nHistory 125A – African American History and Race Relations, 1450-1860\n\nInstructor: S. Jones-Rogers\n\nMW 5-7\n\n170 Social Sciences Building\n\nClass #31563\n\n4 units\n\nThe course will survey African American history from the African background to the outbreak of the Civil War. The origins and development of Afro-American society, culture and politics will be explored from the perspective of African-Americans themselves: slave and free, North and South. Throughout, the enduring dilemma of race relations functions as a central theme.\n\nHistory 7A – Introduction to the History of the United States from Settlement to Civil War\n\nInstructor: B. DeLay\n\nTTh 5-7\n\n155 Dwinelle\n\nClass # 21614\n\n4 units\n\nDiscussion Sections: Please see Schedule of Classes\n\nThis course introduces the history of North America through the era of Reconstruction. Usually U.S. history surveys follow the expanding sphere of English colonization; that is, the geographic scope of the course widens as English speakers occupy more and more of the continent. The problem with this approach is that it consigns everyone else to the margins, as if they were merely waiting for English-speakers to bring history to them. We’ll pursue a different approach. Our unit of analysis will be the continent. English colonies will emerge as part of a larger international system, one comprised of Spanish, Dutch, and French colonies, and, especially, of the scores of indigenous polities that controlled most of the continent for most of the period we’ll be studying. Major themes will include slavery, Native American history, inter-imperial rivalry, revolution, inequality, democracy, white supremacy, and the economic and political development of the early United States. Primary sources will be the main focus of weekly readings and of the two paper assignments. The midterm and final exams will assess your ability to mobilize material from lecture in the service of historical arguments.\n\nSPECIAL COURSES OF INTEREST\n\nAmerican Studies 110 – Listening to America\n\nInstructors: D. Miller and C. Palmer\n\nMW 2-4\n\n141 McCone\n\nClass #24480\n\n4 units\n\nCross-listed with Music 128\n\nThis course examines how music reflects and shapes American history and culture. Listening to a rich collection of music of all genres spanning the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, we will explore the relationship between music and ideas about place, family, freedom, and citizenship. Students will learn to analyze songs and performances in light of debates about national character, ideology, identity, gender, and the spectacular. Musical artists may include: The Beach Boys, Tracy Chapman, Sam Cooke, Aaron Copland, Julius Eastman, Marvin Gaye, Solange Knowles, Janelle Monae, Dolly Parton, Mitski, Charles Ives, and Prince Rogers Nelson.\n\nAmerican Studies C152 –Native American Literature\n\nInstructor: E. Lima\n\nTTh 12:30-2\n\nClass # 24234\n\n4 units\n\nCross-listed with Native American Studies C152\n\nAn analysis of the written and oral tradition developed by Native Americans. Emphasis will be placed on a multifaceted approach (aesthetic, linguistic, psychological, historical, and cultural) in examining American Indian literature.\n\nAmerican Studies 189- Research and Writing in American Studies\n\nInstructor: S. Gold McBride\n\nW 10-12\n\n180 Social Sciences Building\n\nClass # 24231\n\n1-3 units\n\nThis course is designed to encourage research skills, critical thinking, and effective writing. An intensive reading and research seminar, the course will assist students in the development of skills fundamental to advanced research in the humanities, social sciences, and cultural studies. In addition to examining some topics in current American studies scholarship, students will conduct semester-long research projects. The effort entails identification of research topics, cultivation of interdisciplinary methodologies, compilation of annotated bibliographies, and completion of a literature review, which may serve as the first portion of the American studies senior thesis. The course is strongly recommended for those who have been out of touch with the conventions of academic research and writing or who might wish to pursue a graduate degree in the future.\n\nHistory 100U – The History of Baseball\n\nInstructor: D. Henkin\n\nMW 5-7\n\n3 Physics Building\n\nClass #32837\n\n4 units\n\nThe spectator sport of baseball is routinely celebrated by poets, novelists, and cultural commentators as both a unique and peculiarly American pastime. But it is also a global entertainment enterprise that epitomizes many things about capitalist society, leisure culture, and mass entertainment in the modern world. This course is designed to explore baseball over time and across, for both students who love the sport and those who are mystified by its appeal. Lectures focus on the way baseball has acquired cultural meaning in the various settings where it has thrived as a spectator sport, both in the United States and in other nations, since the middle of the nineteenth century. We will pay special attention to baseball’s place in larger developments in the history of urban space, gender, media, labor, statistics, racial inequality, international relations, and U.S. empire. Requirements include regular attendance at lectures, timely completion of reading assignments, an in-class mid-term examination, a short (500–600 words) analysis of primary source documents, a longer (800–900 words) analysis of a pair of novels, and a final examination.\n\nHistory 133A- The History of American Capitalism\n\nInstructor: C. Rosenthal\n\nMWF 9-10\n\n2050 Valley Life Sciences\n\nClass #31570\n\n4 units\n\nThis course explores the history of American labor, business, and economy from the colonial period to the present day.\n\nHistory 125B – African American History and Race Relations: 1860-2016\n\nInstructor: W.

To enroll in the course, please make sure to attend the first day of class.\n\nYou’ve heard it all before: UC Berkeley is the number one public university in the world, it was the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement, the home of the Campanile (the third-tallest bell and clock tower in the world), and of course, no matter how hard you look on the Periodic Table, you won’t find “Stanfordium,” but Berkelium is in spot 97! Some of us have found ourselves chanting “Roll on you Bears” from the seats of California Memorial Stadium, changing our trajectory to avoid stepping on a seal on Memorial Glade, and rubbing the 4.0 ball right before that big midterm. Since the moment we’ve stepped on campus, we have all in some way been truly inspired by the University of California. This course will dive into the rich history, remarkable spirit, and spectacular traditions of Cal from its founding in 1868 to the present-day. We will touch on the origins of the Stanford Axe, the Free Speech Movement, and even some current events at the University. Our hope is that this course will allow you to love and appreciate Cal even more. The majority of our lectures will feature an expert on the subject at hand, including professors, alumni, and friends of the University. The course will include a paper, a midterm, and a final project. From “The Play” to the Cal Marching Band, we’ll explore it all in the Cal History, Spirit, and Traditions DeCal!\n\nTHESIS COURSES\n\nAmerican Studies 191 – Senior Thesis Seminar\n\nInstructor: A.

By focusing on the American home as a place, a theory, an experience, a fantasy, and a media construct, we will explore the social experience, political economy, aesthetics, and history of dwelling in America. As a metaphor for being and belonging, HOME is central to exploring American history, politics, literature, culture, architecture, race relations, economics, folklore, and popular culture.\n\nBuilding on concepts and methods of inquiry which define American Studies, this course emphasizes the analysis of cultural meaning, knowledge, and values through the examination of a variety of cultural productions—films, literature, ads as well as the built environment–in order to explore how individuals, groups, and institutions interact. Through close reading of diverse texts, we will practice approaches that enable us to analyze critically the ongoing creation, maintenance, and transmission of cultural meaning within American society.\n\nThis course is designed to enable you to think and do research as an interdisciplinary scholar, specifically to give you the tools to do readings of literary texts, images, buildings, common objects, films, and spaces. You will also learn the basics of conducting an interview, drawing a floorplan, and recording and analyzing human behaviors. You will practice historical research—gathering and evaluating evidence–as well as practice the skills involved in finding a thesis and arguing it persuasively. You will strengthen your research skills and cultural understanding.\n\nTIME COURSES\n\nHistory 100U – The Making of the Modern World: Britain and the USA, 1815-1964\n\nDavid Henkin/James Vernon\n\nMW 5:00-7:00 pm\n\n390 Hearst Mining Building\n\nClass #32983\n\n4 units\n\nNOTE: THIS COURSE CAN SATISFY THE TIME OR PLACE MAJOR REQUIREMENT, BUT NOT BOTH.\n\nFor those who live in the Global North, perhaps no two countries played such an important role in the making of the modern world as America and Britain. This class will explore how their interlocking histories have laid foundations for much that still shape our lives: the structures of difference and disadvantage around race, gender, sex and class; the forms of our cities, labor, politics, entertainment and sports; and the forces of migration, capitalism, imperialism and environmental degradation that still haunt our present. Along the way we will explore the deep ties and fierce antagonisms that inform the relationship between two countries. The class begins in the wake of America’s last post-colonial war against Britain and ends with the so-called British invasion of America by the Beatles, when Britain had become an outpost of the American empire.\n\nAmerican Studies 101 – The Teen Age\n\nChristine Palmer\n\nMW 10:00 am – 12:00 pm\n\n155 AAPB\n\nClass #19703\n\n4 units\n\nThis course explores both the invention of the teenager and the significance of teen culture in the United States after the Second World War. Among the topics addressed in the course will be identity, age-sets, social networks and high school hierarchy, juvenile delinquency, the concept of cool, consumerism, representation, teen idols, and the rise of ‘tweens. We will examine a variety of teen texts drawn from film, television, music, narrative and graphic fiction, and social engineering textbooks. Our task in this class is to figure out how people have represented and responded to teenagers in the United States. How has the American teenager been understood and commercialized? What has been the cultural impact of the American teenager? How do scholars explain social fascination with high school, the senior prom, adolescent angst, teen fashions, and youth culture? What metaphors have been most often attached to the teenager in the United States? How does American adolescence prescribe as well as challenge American adulthood? How has the American teenager been made exciting, appealing, dangerous, or everyday? By studying the experiences, culture, and representation of American teenagers, and the cultural forms created for them and by them, we will consider specific moments of meaning-making and the long-term development of generational discourse.\n\nPLACE COURSES\n\nAmerican Studies 102 –Los Angeles: Dreams and Nightmares\n\nKathleen Moran/ Alexander Craghead\n\nTTh 12:30-2:00 pm\n\n141 McCone\n\nClass #20399\n\n4 units\n\nFulfills Arts & Humanities or Historical Studies breadth requirement\n\nLos Angeles is a city with a split personality. To some, it is a paradise, a place of sunshine, ocean-lapped beaches, and endless possibilities for renewal. To others, it is a complicated and duplicitous urban jungle with no real reason to exist. In this course, we will examine Los Angeles as both a material place and as a mediated landscape, a place with physical dimensions as well as imagined ones. We will engage with the art, music, literature (both high and popular) and film, as well as with the tangible landscape of the metropolis, to try and understand the deeper social and cultural meanings of this, the largest city in California, and puzzle out how this is a place that everyone knows, even if they have never been there.\n\nAmerican Studies 102 –Music and Landscapes of the American West\n\nDavid Miller\n\nMW 12:00-2:00 pm\n\n56 Social Sciences\n\nClass # 17150\n\n4 units\n\nWhat does a desert sound like? How about a mountaintop? In this course we will address these questions by studying music that depicts, discusses, or is inspired by the natural landscapes of the American West, as well as how those landscapes figure into portrayals of the region and its people more broadly. Course topics include the music of Westerns, country music, attempts at populist classical music, Native American music, and environmental activism through music. Prior coursework in music or the ability to read music are not required.\n\nAmerican Studies C111E – Representing New Orleans\n\nBryan Wagner/Laurie Wilkie\n\nTTh 2:00-3:30 pm\n\nLocation: TBA\n\nClass #20222\n\n4 units\n\nCross-listed with English C136\n\nWe will consider the representation of New Orleans in four related formats: (1) expressive culture, (2) folklife, (3) heritage tourism, and (4) foodways. Our premise is that New Orleans is stranger than fiction. Weekly writing, creative collaboration, and final essay.\n\nCourse materials include varieties of art, music, literature, politics, religion, and folklore that have defined the city of New Orleans. Materials will be posted either on the course website or through linked resources made available without charge through the UC Berkeley library.\n\nHistory 100U – The Making of the Modern World: Britain and the USA, 1815-1964\n\nDavid Henkin/James Vernon\n\nMW 5-7\n\n390 Hearst Mining Building\n\nClass #32983\n\n4 units\n\nNOTE: THIS COURSE CAN SATISFY THE TIME OR PLACE MAJOR REQUIREMENT, BUT NOT BOTH.\n\nFor those who live in the Global North, perhaps no two countries played such an important role in the making of the modern world as America and Britain. This class will explore how their interlocking histories have laid foundations for much that still shape our lives: the structures of difference and disadvantage around race, gender, sex and class; the forms of our cities, labor, politics, entertainment and sports; and the forces of migration, capitalism, imperialism and environmental degradation that still haunt our present. Along the way we will explore the deep ties and fierce antagonisms that inform the relationship between two countries. The class begins in the wake of America’s last post-colonial war against Britain and ends with the so-called British invasion of America by the Beatles, when Britain had become an outpost of the American empire.\n\nHONORS SEMINAR\n\nAmerican Studies H110: Remains: The Making and Unmaking of the American Body\n\nSarah Gold McBride\n\nM 12-2\n\n65 Evans\n\nClass #31259\n\n4 units\n\nNOTE: Instructor consent is required for enrollment.\n\nWhat does it mean to have an American body, and whose bodies count as American? Since the country’s founding in the late eighteenth century, the body has been the site of both metaphorical and physical contestations over American identity. Human bodies and body parts—from skin to skulls to bellies to hair—have marked the boundaries and constitutive components of American political and cultural citizenship. Americans have both policed and regulated each other’s bodies and used their own bodies to claim or proclaim their place in the body politic; as poet Lucille Clifton wrote in 1980, “these hips / are free hips. / they don’t like to be held back. / these hips have never been enslaved, / they go where they want to go / they do what they want to do.”\n\nIn this course, we will use the body as a lens through which to examine the many ways that people in the United States have defined, imagined, and contested the contours of American identity. We will consider human bodies in both literal, physical form—and the lived experience of having a body in America—as well as artistic and symbolic representations of the body found in literature, memoir, poetry, popular media, film, photography, and scientific research. Students will read, write, and think together, drawing on both scholarly and primary texts as we explore how the idealized American body has changed over time. Our seminar will consider many different kinds of bodies: racialized bodies, gendered bodies, disabled bodies, diseased bodies, fat bodies, queer bodies, sexualized bodies, reproductive bodies, dead bodies. Students will also have the opportunity to select texts for—and lead discussions about—body stories relevant to their areas of concentration and research interest\n\nSPECIAL COURSES OF INTEREST\n\nAmerican Studies 110 – The Good Life\n\nChristine Palmer\n\nTTh 9:30-11:00 am\n\n262 Evans\n\nClass # 19388\n\n4 units\n\nFormer U.S. poet laureate Tracy K. Smith’s poem “The Good Life” presents a distinctive vision of what it means to live one’s life well. In Smith’s poem, money, nostalgia, and belonging are essential elements, as are food, movement, gratitude, community, diaspora, time, and social comparison. But there are numerous compelling visions of the good life. From Gwendolyn Brooks’s poem “The Sundays of Satin-Legs Smith” to Duke Ellington’s jazz standard “Lush Life,” to George Birge’s parodic country hit “Beer Beer, Truck Truck,” making broad claims about the best ways of living a life well is a regular feature of the American literary and cultural landscape. This course explores the good life through a diverse group of 20th century and contemporary works that make implicit and explicit claims about what individuals ought to do in order to live a satisfied or satisfying life.\n\nAmerican Studies 110AC – Deaths and Afterlives of Columbus\n\nRhiannon Noel Welch\n\nTTh 12:00-1:00 pm\n\n170 Social Sciences\n\nClass #32941\n\n3 units\n\nCross-listed with Italian 125AC\n\nDuring the summer of 2020, public confrontations over the memory of Christopher Columbus re-emerged, as they have ever since his earliest public commemorations in the US began in 1792. Like confederate monuments, during the mass uprisings of 2020, Columbus statues became sites of fierce local contestations across this country. To name just two of several: in Philadelphia, PA, some Italian American ‘defenders’ of Columbus squared off with protestors marching in solidarity with BLM and the Indigenous communities that were decimated as a direct result of what Haitian historian Michel-Rolph Trouillot has called Columbus’fateful ‘stumb[ling] on the Bahamas’ in 1492. In Richmond, VA, once capital of the Confederacy, protestors toppled a statue of Columbus into a lake in Byrd Park.\n\nWhile these events may appear to observers as yet another instance of two competing visions of American history (one ‘top-down,’ white and Eurocentric, another ‘bottom-up,’ non-white and inclusive), the figure of Columbus in the US contains a much more layered and ambivalent history, which serves as an excellent case study in how the past is a concept that is inseparable from the present.\n\nThis course thus takes up the figure of Columbus in order to explore to what degree what we consider past (as individuals, as collectivities) is by no means an inert set of ‘facts’ located ‘out there’ waiting to be ‘discovered.’ As the most recent round of monument debates attest, despite his never having set foot here, the myth of Columbus is alive and well in the US. This course considers Columbus less as an historical personage (be he genocidal villain or heroic explorer) than as a multiple and contradictory site of meaning that is deeply entangled with histories of ethnic and racial identity formation in the US (and beyond). Rather than a comprehensive history of the man and his deeds, we will take up a selection of the many powerful myths and contestations over meaning he has generated. To name just a few such myths and contestations: the idea of the ‘discovery’ of ‘New World,’ Columbus as a symbol of Italian American and/or Catholic identity, and/or Columbus as a perpetrator of indigenous genocide, or his arrival in the Caribbean as a key turning point in the development of transatlantic slavery. As historian Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor recently put it, “You don’t get to 1619 without 1492.”\n\nAfrican American Studies 113AC — Racial Capitalism\n\nMichael Mark Cohen\n\nMW 5:00-7:00 pm\n\n159 Mulford\n\nClass # 32177\n\n4 units\n\nNote: This course can be used towards almost any area of concentration for the American Studies major.\n\nThis course considers the intertwined histories of capitalism and racism in the United States. Recent years have seen a resurgent interest in the work of revolutionary thinkers—such as Karl Marx, W.E.B. DuBois, Grace Lee Boggs, Angela Davis, and Sylvia Federici— while contemporary radical scholars such as Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Tithi Bhattacharya and Vijay Prashad have come to the fore. Together they, among other thinkers, can be seen to be advancing the study of what Cedric Robinson has called “racial capitalism.”\n\nSince Marx first conceptualized the rise of industrial capitalism on the basis of England as its classic case, New World colonization and the US’s empire of cotton have increasingly come to be understood as an integral part of the story of global capital accumulation. Just as the enclosure of the European commons and and indigenous dispossession in the New World went hand in hand, so too did the transatlantic slave trade and the transPacific coolie trade in the Americas, racialized debt peonage in the US South and racially segmented migrant labor markets in the US West. American society’s multiple, diverse racial and ethnic cultures are embedded within a fully global political economy of modern capitalism.\n\nAmerican Studies 110 –Jews and Judaism in the American Political Mind\n\nLouis Schubert\n\nTTh 3:30-5:00 pm\n\n255 Dwinelle\n\nClass #33024\n\n3 units\n\nCross-listed with Jewish Studies 110\n\nDespite small size, Jews and Judaism have held a large place in the American political mind. This course examines the role of Jewish thought in American ideas since before the Founding, analyzes past and current views on Jews and Judaism across the American political spectrum, and explores continuing anti-Semitism and philo-Semitism in the US.\n\nPRE-1900 COURSES\n\nHistory 125A – African American History and Race Relations: 1450-1860\n\nWaldo Martin\n\nTTh 2:00-3:30 pm\n\n12 Haviland\n\nClass #31849\n\n4 units\n\nThe course will survey African American history from the African background to the outbreak of the Civil War. The origins and development of Afro-American society, culture and politics will be explored from the perspective of African-Americans themselves: slave and free, North and South. Throughout, the enduring dilemma of race relations functions as a central theme.\n\nEnglish 130A – American Literature Before 1800\n\nKathleen Donegan\n\nTTh 3:30-5:00 pm\n\nLocation: 101 Moffitt\n\nClass #33227\n\n4 units\n\nThis course surveys the literatures of early America, from the tracts that envisioned the impact of British colonization to the novels that measured the after-shock of the American Revolution. Throughout, we will consider colonial America as a place of encounter – a place where diversity was a given, negotiation was a necessity, and transformation was inescapable. We will read broadly in the many genres of writing produced in the colonial and early national era, keeping our eyes trained both to literary form and to the world beyond the page. Our topics will include contact and settlement, “translations” of Native American culture, religious and social formations, captivity narratives, natural history, print culture, the Atlantic slave trade, the writing of revolution, and the contested ideals of the new republic. Throughout, we will pay special attention to how writing operated to forge new models of the self that could withstand and absorb the tumult of colonial life.\n\nTHESIS COURSES\n\nAmerican Studies 191, Section 001– Senior Thesis Seminar\n\nAlexander Craghead\n\nT 4:00-6:00 pm\n\n102 Social Sciences\n\nClass# 12691\n\n4 units\n\nAmerican Studies 191, Section 002 – Senior Thesis Seminar\n\nSarah Gold McBride\n\nW 12:00-2:00 pm\n\n41 Evans\n\nClass# 12692\n\n4 units\n\nAmerican Studies H195 – Senior Honors Thesis Seminar\n\nSarah Gold McBride\n\nW 2:00-4:00 pm\n\n47 Evans\n\nClass #14143\n\n4 unitsSatis\n\nINTRODUCTORY COURSES\n\nAmerican Studies 10 – Going Nuclear!\n\nInstructors: M.

Through an exploration of these and other examples of the utopian/dystopian (or, hopeful/frightful) understandings of “going nuclear” in twentieth century American history and culture, this course will introduce students to the concepts and methods of American Studies as an interdisciplinary field of study.\n\nAmerican Studies 10 —Creativity in Times of Crisis: The 1930s, the 1970s, and the Great Recession\n\nInstructor: S.

Please see:\n\nhttps://dev-first-year.pantheon.berkeley.edu/courses/\n\nFor enrollment information, please see:\n\nhttps://dev-first-year.pantheon.berkeley.edu/faq/\n\nThis course examines three moments in American history — the Great Depression of the 1930s, the social and economic “malaise” of the 1970s, and the Great Recession of the early-21st-century — and delves into how writers, filmmakers, and musicians responded to these crises with trenchant diagnoses of their world and radical visions of how it might be transformed. In the 1930s, we will turn to such artists as Tillie Olsen, Richard Wright, Duke Ellington, and Charlie Chaplin; in the 1970s, to such artists as Ursula LeGuin, Toni Morrison, Martin Scorcese, and the musicians behind the genres of soul and punk; and in the late-2000s, to such artists as Eugene Lim, Jordan Peele, Kendrick Lamar, and Janelle Monáe. Throughout, we will be attentive to the mainstream of American political discourse and to the ideas of social movements of the time so that we can assess the relationship between art and politics.\n\nAmerican Studies 10 – Science Fiction\n\nInstructor: S.

An anxious dystopic rendering of technological change? A hopeful engagement with changes in human scientific capacities? In this course, we’ll read, view, and listen to a range of science fiction works from fiction to film to music, in order to explore how this form of cultural production can help us think through the social challenges brought about by technological change. In addition to thinking through the ways science fiction frames technological and social change, we will also think about its framing of social systems like race, class, and gender. Class will include guest speakers on core topics, and two cultural outings.\n\nAfrican American Studies 27AC: Lives of Struggle: Minorities in a Majority Culture\n\nInstructor: M. Cohen\n\nTTh 12:30-2\n\nHearst Field Annex A1\n\nClass# 23575\n\n3 units\n\nThe purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.\n\nTIME COURSES\n\nAmerican Studies 101– James Baldwin’s America, 1953-1974\n\nInstructor: C. Palmer\n\nTTh 12:30-2\n\n112 Haviland\n\nClass # 25181\n\n4 units\n\nAt the end of the autobiographical notes to his Notes of a Native Son (1955), James Baldwin writes, “I want to be an honest man and a good writer.” Remembered as a writer and activist who told the truth passionately in essays, novels, plays, and poems, Baldwin delivered piercing critiques of American liberalism and the failed promises of US-American democracy. The American Studies scholar and artist Thulani Davis remembered James Baldwin as “one of those rare figures in literature and history, a man who was truly engaged in all the issues of his time.” In this course, we will read Baldwin—against a backdrop of the social, political, and cultural moment of 1953-1974—to trace his development of thought. We will put Baldwin in conversation with his contemporaries, including Marlon Brando, Miles Davis, Lorraine Hansberry, Jackson Pollock, Nina Simone, and others, to explore the following themes: the artist as what Baldwin called “the disturber of the peace”; the reverberations of chattel slavery and American apartheid; religion and the prophetic voice; the blues as metaphor; the problem of white innocence; the meaning of home and exile; art as a tool for reconfiguring the past and the present; and the need for love, hope, and freedom in the world.\n\nAmerican Studies 101AC — Americans and their Stuff: Object Lessons from the Civil War Era\n\nInstructor: S. Gold McBride\n\nMW 12-2\n\n241 Cory\n\nClass # 23656\n\n4 units\n\nWhat can we learn about American people, communities, and cultures by studying their stuff? In this class, we will closely examine the objects that were part of everyday life in the United States in the middle of the 19th century (approximately 1846 to 1877). As tensions between the North and South worsened and the nation descended into a devastating Civil War, ordinary people living across North America continued to live daily lives saturated with objects: they exchanged coins and bank notes, sewed clothing, prepared meals, mailed letters, used tools, shot guns, and cared for dead and dying bodies. While the objects themselves may have differed, people across the country depended on and drew from meaning from their stuff— whether they were enslaved families in South Carolina, immigrant neighborhoods in San Francisco, white middle-class families in Boston, or Indigenous communities on the Great Plains. By combining the methodology and sources of material culture with examinations of history and popular media, our interdisciplinary study of American stuff will consider what objects can teach us about culture, identity, and community in the shadow of war, and the lessons we can draw for our twenty-first century world. For American Studies majors, this course fulfills the Time and Pre-1900 requirements. This course also fulfills the American Cultures requirement.\n\nAmerican Studies 110 — The New Gilded Age\n\nInstructor: M. Brilliant\n\nT 3-5\n\n35 Evans\n\nClass # 23554\n\nThe “new Gilded Age” is a term that scholars, pundits, and activists in recent years have used to refer to the sharp increase in economic inequality in the United States, the increasing concentration of income and wealth in the hands of the nation’s well-to-do, especially its richest 1 percent and above. The roots of this watershed in recent American history are many and run deep. This course will trace some of those roots, examining the origins of America’s new Gilded Age by focusing on major transformations in economics, politics, and education in the 1970s and 1980s. Along the way, we will also consider some of the social experiences and cultural expressions of Americans as they lived through the new Gilded Age.\n\nHistory 134A – The Age of the City, 1825-1933\n\nInstructor: D. Henkin\n\nMW 5-6:30\n\n277 Cory\n\nClass # 31406\n\n4 units\n\nFor most of human history, urban living has been the experience of a distinct minority. Only in the past two hundred years have the physical spaces, social relations, and lifestyles associated with large cities entered the mainstream. This course examines the long century of urban growth between 1825 and 1933, when big cities came into being in the United States. Focusing on large metropolitan centers (especially New York, San Francisco, and Chicago), we will study the way urban spaces provided sites and sources of new modes of personal interaction, popular entertainment, social conflict, cultural identity, and political expression. We will also follow the way these environments provided the settings for formative cultural encounters among men and women of different ethnicities (especially African Americans, European Americans, and Asian Americans), urban encounters that produced much of what we think of today as American culture. By exploring the origins and evolutions of race riots, elevated railroads, boxing matches, department stores, world’s fairs, strikes, ethnic enclaves, baseball stadiums, fire companies, minstrel shows, sex work, skyscrapers, sensational journalism, apartment buildings, amusement parks, gas-lit promenades, neon billboards, personal ads, nickelodeons, and numerous other artifacts, engines, and symbols of a socially promiscuous world in ethnically heterogeneous and divided cities, we can take stock of a way of life we have come to take for granted. Requirements include regular attendance at lectures, timely completion of reading assignments, two in-class mid-term examinations, one 500–600 word analysis of assigned readings, one personal reflection, and a final examination.\n\nPLACE COURSES\n\nAmerican Studies 102AC — Beaches in Mind: The Beach in American Culture\n\nInstructor: S. Gold McBride\n\n141 Giannini\n\nMW 2-4\n\nClass # 23819\n\nThis course will explore the meaning, history, and culture of the beach in the United States. From Oahu’s North Shore to the Inkwell on Martha’s Vineyard, to Florida’s “Redneck Riviera” and the Southern California beaches that starred in Beach Boys songs in the 1960s, the beach has loomed large in both the lived experience and the symbolic imagination of ordinary Americans since the nineteenth century. What is the culture of the beach, and why does it matter? By combining history, material culture, and popular media (including literature, music, and film), as well as visits to local Bay Area beaches, our interdisciplinary study of the beach will consider what American beaches can teach us about race, ethnicity, gender, indigeneity, class, sexuality, work, leisure, consumption, the environment, popular culture, and power in the United States. For American Studies majors, this course fulfills the Place requirement. This course also fulfills the American Cultures requirement.\n\nAmerican Studies C112 – The American Landscape: Place, Power, and Culture\n\nInstructor: A. Craghead\n\n141 Giannini\n\nMW 12-2\n\nClass # 26538\n\n4 units\n\nCross-listed with Geography C160\n\nWhat is America as a landscape and a place, and how do we know it when we see it? In the present moment, marked by struggles over economic, environmental, and social division played out in space and place, such questions are imperative.\n\nThis course seeks to address such questions, to introduce ways of seeing and interpreting American histories and cultures, as revealed in everyday built surroundings—homes, highways, farms, factories, stores, recreation areas, small towns, city districts, and regions. It does so through the lens of cultural geography, an interdisciplinary practice that developed, in part, here at Berkeley during the 20th century. Our goal in this course is thus twofold: First, to develop a kind of literacy in the role of space and place in American culture, and second to develop a working knowledge of cultural geography as a practice and then to use those skills to better see the world around us.\n\nAmerican Studies C171 – The American Landscape Since 1850\n\nInstructor: L.

The course will review the cultural and social contexts which have shaped and informed landscape architecture in the United States since the advent of the public parks movement, as well as, the aesthetic precepts, environmental concerns, horticultural practices, and technological innovations of American landscapes. Students will complete a midterm, final, and a research assignment.\n\nSPECIAL COURSES OF INTEREST\n\nAmerican Studies 110\n\nReadings in Cultural Theory\n\nInstructor: M. M. Cohen\n\nW 4-7\n\n245 Hearst Gym\n\nClass # 24668\n\nAs an academic discipline, American Studies takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of US culture in all its forms. From music to architecture, from literature to advertising, American Studies has broken down the distinctions between art and politics, labor and leisure, fine arts and popular culture. Throughout its history, American Studies has pushed the boundaries of academic inquiry by placing questions of race, class, gender and sexuality, power and resistance into the center of our inquiry, pressing what was once the margins of American life into the center of this dynamic and radical field. Yet, as the founder of Cultural Studies Raymond Williams reminds us, culture is one of the most complex words in the English language, encompassing a range of meanings from the anthropological to the biological to the aesthetic. Therefore, in this course we will take up the question of culture and theories of culture within American Studies by reading both classical works and new directions in cultural theory. Readings include works by Stuart Hall, Frederic Jameson, Saidiya Hartman, Judith Butler, Karl Marx, Antonio Gramsci, Edward Said, David Graeber, Michel Rolph-Truillot and more.\n\nAmerican Studies 110 — The New Gilded Age\n\nInstructor: M.

IT DOES NOT FULFILL ANY AMERICAN STUDIES MAJOR REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThis seminar is designed to help American Studies majors prepare to write their senior thesis next semester or next year. Whether you will enroll in AS H195 or AS 191, this class will provide students with the information, skills, and resources you need to write your thesis without feeling overwhelmed. Over the course of the semester, students will develop a senior thesis topic, conduct preliminary research on their topic, and craft a plan for their senior thesis. We will also work together to explore what it means to research and write in the field of American Studies, and our own identities as American Studies scholars. By the end of the semester, each student will have each developed a senior thesis prospectus composed of a meaningful interdisciplinary research question, a set of primary sources to analyze, a preliminary bibliography of secondary sources, and a rough outline of your thesis’s structure. Note: Class is variable unit.\n\nHistory of Art 185 D – The Transatlantic Gilded Age and Its Discontents\n\nInstructor: M.

The hills section includes Native American sites, a Southern Pacific Railroad tunnel, and topographically-sensitive platting designed with deeply theorized c. 1910 ideas generated by a group of activist progressive women about the relationship between settlement and topography, as well as houses designed by Berkeley’s most distinguished architects. The residential section in the flats is an historically non-white neighborhood that includes homes in which railroad porter Leon Marsh, newspaper man Thomas C. Fleming, politician William Byron Rumford, and WPA artist Sargent Johnson lived. It was also home to immigrating Scandinavian, Japanese, and Greek families (such as that of musician Johnny Otis). Students will learn about redlining and protective covenants as well as campaigns to establish native species of plants and alleés of street trees and parks.\n\nThe project of the course is two-pronged: to engage students in developing the skills to write a wide variety of different kinds of essays on the one hand, and, on the other, to work as a group toward Berkeley Landmark, CA Register, and National Register designations for both these neighborhoods. Students will practice real-world persuasive writing, acquiring life skills while contributing to our pool of knowledge and a public sense of value in the crafting and ‘reading’ of streetscapes and neighborhoods.\n\nThere are weekly research/writing assignments.\n\nPRE-1900 COURSES\n\nAmerican Studies 101AC — Americans and their Stuff: Object Lessons from the Civil War Era\n\nInstructor: S. Gold McBride\n\nMW 12-2\n\n241 Cory\n\nClass # 23656\n\nWhat can we learn about American people, communities, and cultures by studying their stuff? In this class, we will closely examine the objects that were part of everyday life in the United States in the middle of the 19th century (approximately 1846 to 1877). As tensions between the North and South worsened and the nation descended into a devastating Civil War, ordinary people living across North America continued to live daily lives saturated with objects: they exchanged coins and bank notes, sewed clothing, prepared meals, mailed letters, used tools, shot guns, and cared for dead and dying bodies. While the objects themselves may have differed, people across the country depended on and drew from meaning from their stuff— whether they were enslaved families in South Carolina, immigrant neighborhoods in San Francisco, white middle-class families in Boston, or Indigenous communities on the Great Plains. By combining the methodology and sources of material culture with examinations of history and popular media, our interdisciplinary study of American stuff will consider what objects can teach us about culture, identity, and community in the shadow of war, and the lessons we can draw for our twenty-first century world. For American Studies majors, this course fulfills the Time and Pre-1900 requirements. This course also fulfills the American Cultures requirement.\n\nHistory 7A – Introduction to the History of the United States: The United States from Settlement to Civil War\n\nInstructor: H. Hirota\n\nTTh 11-12:30\n\n155 Dwinelle\n\nClass # 21575\n\n4 units\n\nThis course surveys the central ideas and events that shaped American history from the colonial period to the end of the Civil War era. Major issues to be covered in this course include the European colonization of the Americas; encounters and interactions among Africans, Europeans, and Native Americans; the formation of English colonies in North America; the development of American slavery; the origins and consequences of the American Revolution; the geographic, demographic, and economic expansion of antebellum America; Indian removal; the debate over slavery; and the Civil War and Reconstruction. Particular attention will be paid to the international dimensions of early American history, including comparisons between America and other regions, and the roles of race, ethnicity, class, gender, and religion in shaping the course of this history. In addition to expanding your knowledge of America’s past, this course will introduce you to the practice of history. Through reading and writing assignments, you will not only learn how historians analyze and interpret the past but also exercise it yourself.\n\nHistory 125A – African American History and Race Relations: 1450-1860\n\nInstructor: TBA\n\nTTh 2-3:30\n\n102 Wheeler\n\nClass # 31394\n\n4 units\n\nThe course will survey African American history from the African background to the outbreak of the Civil War. The origins and development of Afro-American society, culture and politics will be explored from the perspective of African-Americans themselves: slave and free, North and South. Throughout, the enduring dilemma of race relations functions as a central theme.\n\nAfrican American Studies 116 — Slavery and African American Life Before 1865\n\nInstructor: U. Taylor\n\nMW 10-12\n\n170 Social Sciences\n\nClass #25948\n\n4 units\n\nThis course will examine the origins of the African slave trade, and explore political, economic, demographic and cultural factors shaping African American life and culture prior to 1865.\n\nHistory 134A – The Age of the City, 1825-1933\n\nInstructor: D. Henkin\n\nMW 5-6:30\n\n277 Cory\n\nClass # 31406\n\n4 units\n\nFor most of human history, urban living has been the experience of a distinct minority. Only in the past two hundred years have the physical spaces, social relations, and lifestyles associated with large cities entered the mainstream. This course examines the long century of urban growth between 1825 and 1933, when big cities came into being in the United States. Focusing on large metropolitan centers (especially New York, San Francisco, and Chicago), we will study the way urban spaces provided sites and sources of new modes of personal interaction, popular entertainment, social conflict, cultural identity, and political expression. We will also follow the way these environments provided the settings for formative cultural encounters among men and women of different ethnicities (especially African Americans, European Americans, and Asian Americans), urban encounters that produced much of what we think of today as American culture. By exploring the origins and evolutions of race riots, elevated railroads, boxing matches, department stores, world’s fairs, strikes, ethnic enclaves, baseball stadiums, fire companies, minstrel shows, sex work, skyscrapers, sensational journalism, apartment buildings, amusement parks, gas-lit promenades, neon billboards, personal ads, nickelodeons, and numerous other artifacts, engines, and symbols of a socially promiscuous world in ethnically heterogeneous and divided cities, we can take stock of a way of life we have come to take for granted. Requirements include regular attendance at lectures, timely completion of reading assignments, two in-class mid-term examinations, one 500–600 word analysis of assigned readings, one personal reflection, and a final examination.\n\nTHESIS COURSES\n\nAS 191 – Senior Thesis Seminar\n\nInstructor: A.

Through an exploration of these and other examples of the utopian/dystopian meanings of “going nuclear” in twentieth century American history and culture, this course will introduce students to the concepts and methods of American Studies as an interdisciplinary field of study.\n\nLetters and Science 40 F – Modernity and Its Discontents: American History and Culture at the Turn of the 20th Century (4 units) – Class # 33050\n\nInstructor: K.

This course will explore some of those challenges by attempting to understand how\n\nthey emerged and why. We will read some classic accounts of the rise of capitalism,\n\nurbanization, globalization and bureaucracy. We will also discuss a number of the most\n\nsignificant social, political, economic and cultural developments that together characterize\n\nmodernity including the rise of advertising, amusement parks, the movie industry, popular\n\nmusic, and department stores. And we will use these accounts to help us understand\n\ncontemporary concerns, including the nature of modern branding, the appeal of Disneyization,\n\nthe meaning of fashion and influencers, the role of fantasy media, the appeal of sensationalist\n\nmovies and the context of global climate change.\n\n“Time” Courses\n\nAmerican Studies 101 – A History of the Present from 9/11/2001 to 1/6/2021 (4 units) – Class # 23957\n\nInstructor: M. Cohen\n\nMW 2-4, Room 240 Mulford\n\nThis interdisciplinary history course explores the origins of our present crisis by studying the history of the United States from 9/11/2001 to 1/6/2021. Using historical and cultural studies methods to study the recent past, we will take on the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and cultural changes that have remade American life in the past two decades. This era has led us to a state of almost permanent crisis in which our democracy, our health and sanity, our jobs and relationships, and our planet all feel on the verge of collapse. Primary topics include the long war on terrorism, the ongoing crisis of global capitalism, race and the culture wars of the Obama era, America’s widening political polarization and the impact of climate change on our bodies, landscapes and culture. Throughout, we will read histories, journalism and novels, listen to popular music, watch important films and TV shows, and generally reconsider the history of a past that we have all somehow survived and must continue to live through. Readings include works by Ta-Nehisi Coates, Jia Tolentino, Ling Ma, Elizabeth Kolbert, Adam Serwer, Amia Srinivasan, and Spencer Ackerman.\n\nAmerican Studies C 111 E – American Culture in the Age of Obama (4 units) Class # 23616\n\nInstructor: S. Saul\n\nTTh 3:30-5, Room 56 Social Sciences Bldg.\n\nThis course traces, across many forms of American culture, what might be called “the Obama effect.” Writer Ta-Nehisi Coates has suggested that the election of Obama prompted a renaissance of black writing, in part by stimulating “curiosity about the community he had so consciously made his home and all the old, fitfully slumbering questions he’d awakened about American identity.” In this course, we’ll examine how a wide range of imaginative writers, in a wide spectrum of genres, took on those questions and offered counternarratives to conventional myths of American innocence, achievement, and glory. We’ll also explore works of music, film, and theater that, like Obama’s autobiography, rewrote the romance of America—whether by adding hip-hop accents to the story of the country’s founding (Hamilton), turning a story of interracial romance into a horror tale (Get Out), or creating an Afro-futurist, queer-inflected story of slave revolt (Janelle Monáe’s Metropolis saga). Along the way, we’ll consider two of the social movements that coalesced and gathered force during Obama’s presidency: Occupy and Black Lives Matter. We’ll investigate how these movements challenged the limits—political, economic, moral—of the “age of Obama” through art and political action, and looked to create new forms of radical community while protesting inequality and state violence.\n\nHistory 136 C Defiant Women: Gender, Power and Violence in American History (4 units) – Class # 31417\n\nInstructor: S E. Jones-Rogers\n\nMW 5-7, Room 100 Lewis\n\nTaking as its focus diverse groups of women who have shaped the course of North American history, this class will explore the relationship between gender, power and violence from the colonial period to the modern era. We will discuss how women have challenged conventional notions of “womanhood” through their words and their deeds, how their respective communities understood their behavior, and we will contemplate the ways in which these women simultaneously constructed narratives of power that do not conform to contemporary conceptualizations of their lives.\n\n“Place” Courses\n\nAmerican Studies 102 Photos of America: Technology, Representation, and Landscape (4 units) – Class # 20930\n\nInstructor: A. Craghead\n\nMW 12-2, Room 240 Mulford\n\nThe camera and the photograph have a unique relationship with the American landscape. No technology has more profoundly shaped the way that we see, feel, and think about North America as a place. In this course, we will look at photography as a social and cultural practice, one engaged in by inventors, scientists, artists, and most of all by the public at large. We will explore issues of science, politics, consumer culture, and entertainment, and examine how photographs may be preparing the way for our perception of the virtual. Most of all, we’ll consider who makes photos and to what purposes, and attempt to understand how those images shape what we think we know about America.\n\nAmerican Studies 102 American Monuments (units 4) – Class # 24833\n\nInstructor: A. Shanken\n\nW 2-5, Room 105 GSPP\n\n“There is nothing in the world as invisible as a monument,” writer Robert Musil once mused. Yet recent events have brought them into high relief, both as commemorative infrastructure and as sites of political struggle. This course will offer a primer on the history of monuments (and memorials) in the United States and engage with their recent history. The course will explore the formal strategies, habits of placement, commemorative value, and the social and political meaning of these often maligned, but also revered, interventions in the built environment. Students will explore issues of iconoclasm, appropriation, race, and gender; confront recent controversies; and work together to propose their own memorial or counter-memorial to an issue or event.\n\nAmerican Studies 102 AC The Great American City: Chicago in the Nineteenth Century (4 units) – Class # 33583\n\nInstructor: S. Gold MCBride\n\nTTh 12:30-2, Room 141 Giannini\n\nThis course will examine Chicago, Illinois, in its first century. When the Town of Chicago was founded in 1833, it had only 200 residents. Sixty years later, when it hosted more than 27 million visitors for the World’s Columbian Exposition, the City of Chicago had 1.1 million residents, making it the second-largest city in the country. What was it like to live in such a rapidly expanding and ever-changing place—and what did Chicago symbolize to Americans living elsewhere in the United States, a country undergoing its own enormous transformations? In this class we will examine the ordinary and extraordinary Chicago: from daily life, labor, and leisure, to the enormous and unprecedented world’s fair held in 1893. By combining history, literature, visual culture, and popular media, our interdisciplinary study of early Chicago will consider what this place can teach us about urban life, race, gender, work, leisure, popular entertainment and popular media, the built environment, and national identity in the nineteenth-century United States. This course fulfills both the Place and the Pre-1900 requirements.\n\nPre-1900 Historical Requirement\n\nAmerican Studies 102 AC The Great American City: Chicago in the Nineteenth Century (4 units) – Class # 33583\n\nInstructor: S.

De Lay\n\nTTh 3:30-5, Room Social Sciences Bldg.\n\nThe early colonial period in the Americas is one of history’s most traumatic, astonishing, and consequential eras. This lecture class compares and contrasts histories of encounter, resistance, conquest, and colonization in three regions of indigenous America: Hispaniola, the Valley of Mexico, and the St. Lawrence River Valley. Each section will begin with regional geography and indigenous and European contexts on the eve of contact. As the class progresses, lectures and discussions of primary sources will interrogate the dynamics that gave rise to the complex and profoundly unequal American societies of the early colonial period, with their stratified, diverse populations.\n\nHistory 136 C Defiant Women: Gender, Power and Violence in American History (4 units) – Class # 31417\n\nInstructor: S E. Jones-Rogers\n\nMW 5-7, Room 100 Lewis\n\nTaking as its focus diverse groups of women who have shaped the course of North American history, this class will explore the relationship between gender, power and violence from the colonial period to the modern era.

This course is meant to enable students to think, do research and write as interdisciplinary scholars: specifically, to give them the intellectual tools to analyze theoretical and literary texts, as well as films, material culture, and images.\n\nSenior Thesis Seminars\n\nAmerican Studies 191 Senior Thesis Seminar (4 units) – Class # 15451\n\nInstructor: S.

Students should discuss their eligibility with an American Studies faculty advisor.\n\nSpecial Courses of Interest\n\nAmerican Studies 110 American Media and Culture Since World War II (4 units) – Class # 23588\n\nInstructor: C. Palmer\n\nMW 10-12, Room 3108 Etcheverry\n\nThis course examines how mass media reflect and shape American history and culture. Tapping a rich collection of primary sources—including popular film, television, magazines, music, and fiction—and secondary sources—including the writings of political theorists and public intellectuals—we will explore the relationship between media and ideas about place, family, freedom, and citizenship. Students will learn to consider media forms and histories in light of theoretical debates about national character, ideology, ethnic and racial identity, gender roles, and the impact of consumerism on American life.\n\nHistory 133 A History of American Capitalism (4 units) – Class # 31414\n\nInstructor: C. Rosenthal\n\nTTh 12:30-2, Room 105 Stanley\n\nWhat is capitalism? And when did it come to characterize the American economy? This course will explore the economic history of the United States, from the colonial period to the present. We will analyze the dramatic changes that catapulted a chain of colonies from the fringe of the global economy to its center. As the semester progresses, we will seek out the sources of this dramatic transformation, exploring a variety of overlapping and sometimes conflicting explanations. Is this primarily a story about ideas and economic outlook? Is it about entrepreneurship and innovation? Or about exploitation and expropriation? What role did the government play? What role the individual? Major themes will include the rise of the factory system, slavery and emancipation, immigration and labor, the development of banking and finance, and economic inequality. In addition to building their knowledge of American history, students will gain theoretical familiarity with three subfields of history: business history, economic history, and labor history. We will explore the ways each of these fields has generated different narratives that celebrate and/or critique American capitalism. And at every turn we will consider how these different narratives alternately highlight and minimize the important roles played by business elites, enslaved people, laborers, women, and immigrants. Rarely was the “invisible hand” colorblind or gender neutral. The course will discuss both famous businessmen and largely-forgotten workmen, women, and slaves. We will examine capitalism both from above and from below, seeking to understand the causes and consequences of economic change for different groups of Americans.\n\nHistory 136 C Defiant Women: Gender, Power and Violence in American History (4 units) – Class # 31417\n\nInstructor: S E. Jones-Rogers\n\nMW 5-7, Room 100 Lewis\n\nTaking as its focus diverse groups of women who have shaped the course of North American history, this class will explore the relationship between gender, power and violence from the colonial period to the modern era. We will discuss how women have challenged conventional notions of “womanhood” through their words and their deeds, how their respective communities understood their behavior, and we will contemplate the ways in which these women simultaneously constructed narratives of power that do not conform to contemporary conceptualizations of their lives.\n\nINTRODUCTORY COURSES\n\nAmerican Studies 10, Sec. 1 – Yesterday’s Tomorrow: Imagining an American Future (4 units) – Class# 23134\n\nInstructor: C. Palmer\n\nTTh 12:30-2, Room 12 Haviland Hall\n\nIn 1816, Thomas Jefferson wrote to John Adams, “I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past,” a stance Adams not only declared “judicious” but also a prophecy that they would “soon meet and be better friends than ever.” This course considers many of the ways Americans from Jefferson and Adams to a host of writers, photographers, painters, filmmakers, activists, engineers, architects, and city planners have imagined the future. We will consider how concepts of the future influence and determine American politics, economics, architecture, race relations, social policy, and culture. The course will pay particular attention to the special relationship between the past, American memory, and imagined futures. By focusing on the future as a time, a place, a theory, a fantasy, and a media construct, this course introduces and provides a “toolkit” for the interdisciplinary study of American culture.\n\nAmerican Studies 10, Sec. 2 – American Makers: Workers, Artists, Activists, and Drop-Outs (4 units) – Class# 25683\n\nInstructor: A. Craghead\n\nMW 2-4, Room 155 Anthro/Art Practice Building\n\nWhat does it mean to make? From methods of industrial mass production, to handicrafts positioned as critiques against those methods, to “make” things within American culture is to engage in a struggle over every meaning. The everyday objects of life—food, clothing, shelter—are all made things. So, too are cultures and traditions. Even ideas are said to be “constructed,” which is another way of saying “made.” Questions of what is made, who makes, and who benefits from making have long been salient with American cultures.\n\nBy focusing on the concept of “making” as a practice, a process, and a theory of meaning, this course provides an introduction to the interdisciplinary study of America. We will look at the historical, political, economic, and cultural meanings of “making” in the U.S as expressed and experienced in literature, popular culture, material culture, and the built environment.\n\n“Time” Courses\n\nAmerican Studies 101, Sec 1 – The Ordinary and Extraordinary 1890’s 4 units) – Class# 25668\n\nInstructor: S. Gold McBride\n\nTTh 11:00-12:30, Room 102 Wurster Hall\n\nTHIS COURSE SIMULTANEOUSLY SATISFIES THE TIME AND PRE-1900 MAJOR REQUIREMENTS. This class will closely examine a single decade of American history: the 1890s. These ten years were marked by monumental and often grave events: a crippling economic depression; a lynching epidemic; war in Cuba, the Philippines, and Lakota territory; and massive strikes by steel and railroad workers. Yet in the 1890s, ordinary American men, women, and children also went to the circus, read Cosmopolitan magazine, played basketball, tried bananas, and rode in the first underground subways. In this class we will consider both extraordinary and the ordinary as we grapple with questions about race, work, science, masculinity, popular culture, identity, the body, violence, spectacle, and power. Who counted as an American — and what did it mean to be an American — in this final decade of the nineteenth century? We will explore this history through the interdisciplinary lens of American Studies, analyzing a wide range of textual, visual, and material sources produced in the 1890s, including newspaper articles, popular fiction, photographs, and souvenirs.\n\nAmerican Studies 101, Sec. 2 – James Baldwin’s America, 1953-1974 (4 units) – Class # 25669\n\nInstructor: C. Palmer\n\nMW 12-2, Room 155 Anthro/Art Practice Building\n\nAt the end of the autobiographical notes to his Notes of a Native Son (1955), James Baldwin writes, “I want to be an honest man and a good writer.” Remembered as a writer and activist who told the truth passionately in essays, novels, plays, and poems, Baldwin delivered piercing critiques of American liberalism and the failed promises of US-American democracy. The American Studies scholar and artist Thulani Davis remembered James Baldwin as “one of those rare figures in literature and history, a man who was truly engaged in all the issues of his time.” In this course, we will read Baldwin—against a backdrop of the social, political, and cultural moment of 1953-1974—to trace his development of thought. We will put Baldwin in conversation with his contemporaries, including Marlon Brando, Miles Davis, Lorraine Hansberry, Jackson Pollock, Nina Simone, and others, to explore the following themes: the artist as what Baldwin called “the disturber of the peace”; the reverberations of chattel slavery and American apartheid; religion and the prophetic voice; the blues as metaphor; the problem of white innocence; the meaning of home and exile; art as a tool for reconfiguring the past and the present; and the need for love, hope, and freedom in the world.\n\nAmerican Studies 101, Sec. 2 – The Music of 1971 – (4 units) – Class # 31100\n\nInstructor: D. Miller\n\nMW 2-4, Room 115 Anthro/Art Practice Building\n\nThe music of 1971 was uncommonly good and uncommonly inventive, and it was inextricably linked to the ups and downs of a turbulent period in American history. Marvin Gaye tackled drug abuse, environmental destruction, and the Vietnam War on What’s Going On, often considered the greatest album of all time, while Sly and the Family Stone incorporated elements of the Black Power movement into their music. Carole King and Joni Mitchell told stories about love, sexuality, and (in)dependence in the modern world on Tapestry and Blue, two pinnacles of the singer-songwriter genre. In February, Aretha Franklin recorded one of the most iconic live albums ever in San Francisco (Aretha Live at Fillmore West); in April, Dolly Parton recorded her favorite original song (“Coat of Many Colors”). Miles Davis continued his quest to expand the boundaries of what jazz could be, while experimentalists Morton Feldman and Pauline Oliveros did the same for classical music. In this course we will become intimately familiar with all of this music and more, as we consider both what the music reveals about the United States in 1971, and why it reverberates so powerfully over a half-century later. Students will have the opportunity to pursue research projects on the music of their choosing, and specialized musical knowledge is not required.\n\nAmerican Studies H110 – The New Gilded Age (4 units) – Class # 24132\n\nInstructor: M. Brilliant\n\nT 2-5, Room 102 Social Sciences Building\n\nFACULTY ADVISOR APPROVAL AND/OR INSTRUCTOR CONSENT REQUIRED\n\nThe “new Gilded Age” is a term that scholars, pundits, and activists in recent years have used to refer to the sharp increase in economic inequality in the United States, the increasing concentration of income and wealth in the hands of the nation’s well-to-do, especially its richest 1-percent and above. The roots of this watershed in recent American history are many and run deep. This course will trace some of those roots, examining the origins of America’s new Gilded Age by focusing on major transformations in economics, politics, and education in the 1970s and 1980s. Along the way, we will also consider some of the social experiences and cultural expressions of Americans as they lived through the new Gilded Age.\n\n“Place” Courses\n\nAmerican Studies 102 – The Workplace (4 units) – Class #23970\n\nInstructor: M. Cohen\n\nTTh 2-3:30, Room 241 Cory Hall\n\nThis American Studies methods class explores the American workplace from the slave ship to the gig economy. By focusing on a sequence of workplaces – the plantation, the factory, the office, the home, the street, and on-line – this class offers a history of how capitalism has constantly revolutionized the work lives of Americans while simultaneously transforming our politics, our culture, our families, and our leisure. By exploring the everyday experiences of workers through a series of political and economic geographies, we will consider the question of race, gender, class and sex on the job; the human and ecological consequences of capitalist expansion from 1492 to the present; and how Americans have refused, resisted and evaded this ever-expanding regime of imposed labor. Readings include works by Frederick Douglass, Marcus Rediker, Karl Marx, Sylvia Federici, Angela Davis, Sarah Jaffe, Sarah Roberts, and David Graeber; with films including Modern Times, The Apartment, and 9 to 5; along with a playlist of work songs and whatever is currently your favorite workplace sit-com.\n\nAmerican Studies 102AC – California, the West, and the World (4 units) – Class # 23935\n\nInstructor: M. Brilliant\n\nTTh 12:30-2, Room 2 Physics Building\n\nTHIS COURSE IS CROSS-LISTED WITH HISTORY 128AC\n\nThis course will survey the history of California and the United States West from the mid-19th century to the dawn of the 21st century. It will situate this state and regional history within the relevant currents of global history, which have profoundly shaped and been shaped by California and the United States West. We will pay particular heed to those elements of California and western U.S. history that are typically associated with the state’s and region’s distinctiveness as a shifting region on the national map, potent and protean symbol in the national (and, often, international) imagination, and catalyst of world historical developments from the Gold Rush and the global guano trade it sparked in the mid-19th century, to the rise of Hollywood in the early 20th century, to the development and deployment of atomic weapons in the mid-20th century, to the emergence of Silicon Valley technological innovation and New Gilded Age income polarization in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nAmerican Studies C112 – The American Landscape: Place, Power, and Culture (4 units) – Class # 32033\n\nInstructor: A. Craghead\n\nMW 10-12, Room 155 Anthro/Art Practice Building\n\nTHIS COURSE IS CROSS-LISTED WITH GEOGRAPHY C160\n\nWhat is America as a landscape and a place, and how do we know it when we see it? In the present moment, marked by struggles over economic, environmental, and social division played out in space and place, such questions are imperative.\n\nThis course seeks to address such questions, to introduce ways of seeing and interpreting American histories and cultures, as revealed in everyday built surroundings—homes, highways, farms, factories, stores, recreation areas, small towns, city districts, and regions. It does so through the lens of cultural geography, an interdisciplinary practice that developed, in part, here at Berkeley during the 20th century. Our goal in this course is thus twofold: First, to develop a kind of literacy in the role of space and place in American culture, and second to develop a working knowledge of cultural geography as a practice and then to use those skills to better see the world around us.\n\nAmerican Studies C171– The American-Designed Landscape Since 1850 (4 units) – Class # 20768\n\nInstructor: L. Mozingo\n\nTTh 3:30-5, Room 101 Wurster Hall\n\nTHIS COURSE IS CROSS-LISTED WITH LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE C171\n\nThis course surveys the history of American landscape architecture since 1850 in four realms: 1) urban open spaces—that is squares, plazas, parks, and recreation systems; 2) urban and suburban design; 3) regional and environmental planning; and 4) gardens. The course will review the cultural and social contexts which have shaped and informed landscape architecture in the United States since the advent of the public parks movement, as well as, the aesthetic precepts, environmental concerns, horticultural practices, and technological innovations of American landscapes. Students will complete a midterm, final, and a research assignment.\n\nHonors Seminar\n\nAmerican Studies H110 – The New Gilded Age (4 units) – Class # 24132\n\nInstructor: M. Brilliant\n\nT 2-5, Room 102 Social Sciences Building\n\nFACULTY ADVISOR APPROVAL AND/OR INSTRUCTOR CONSENT REQUIRED\n\nThe “new Gilded Age” is a term that scholars, pundits, and activists in recent years have used to refer to the sharp increase in economic inequality in the United States, the increasing concentration of income and wealth in the hands of the nation’s well-to-do, especially its richest 1-percent and above. The roots of this watershed in recent American history are many and run deep. This course will trace some of those roots, examining the origins of America’s new Gilded Age by focusing on major transformations in economics, politics, and education in the 1970s and 1980s. Along the way, we will also consider some of the social experiences and cultural expressions of Americans as they lived through the new Gilded Age.\n\nSpecial Courses of Interest\n\nUpper division courses may be used for Areas of Concentration, when appropriate.\n\nAmerican Studies C152 – Native American Literature (4 Units) – Class #24605\n\nInstructor: E. Lima\n\nTTh 12:30-2, Room 106 Moffitt Library\n\nTHIS COURSE IS CROSS-LISTED WITH NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES C152\n\nAn analysis of the written and oral tradition developed by Native Americans. Emphasis will be placed on a multifaceted approach (aesthetic, linguistic, psychological, historical, and cultural) in examining American Indian literature.\n\nAmerican Studies 189 – Research and Writing in American Studies (4 Units) – Class # 24062\n\nInstructor: S. Gold McBride\n\nF 10-12, Room 7 Evans Hall\n\nTHIS CLASS IS OPTIONAL (AND NOT REQUIRED) FOR AMERICAN STUDIES MAJORS. IT DOES NOT FULFILL ANY AMERICAN STUDIES MAJOR REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThis seminar is designed to help American Studies majors prepare to write their senior thesis next semester or next year. Whether you will enroll in AS H195 or AS 191, this class will provide students with the information, skills, and resources you need to write your thesis without feeling overwhelmed. Over the course of the semester, students will develop a senior thesis topic, conduct preliminary research on their topic, and craft a plan for their senior thesis. We will also work together to explore what it means to research and write in the field of American Studies, and our own identities as American Studies scholars. By the end of the semester, each student will have each developed a senior thesis prospectus composed of a meaningful interdisciplinary research question, a set of primary sources to analyze, a preliminary bibliography of secondary sources, and a rough outline of your thesis’s structure.\n\nPre-1900 Historical Requirement\n\nThese courses satisfy the pre-1900 US historical require"
