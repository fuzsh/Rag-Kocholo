        "text": "The Official Home Page for Laurie Beebe Lewis\n\nOriginally from Saginaw, Michigan, vocalist and song writer Laurie Beebe Lewis frequently toured with Dick Wagner, Bob Seger, Alice Cooper and Ted Nugent in the early 1970's with her band “Pitche Blende ”. Laurie moved to Chicago in 1976 which gave opportunity to work on commercial and studio demos in the recording industry. Her earliest years in Chicago include live performances with Big Band leader Les Elgart, B.B. King and a featured guest vocalist with The Spinners on their hit song “Then Came You”, all which caught the attention of the Chicago based group “The Buckinghams”. Laurie joined the band in 1983 as a key vocalist and backing keyboards. They recorded their first album since the 60’s, “A Matter of Time” in 1985 with national distribution on Columbia Records.\n\nIn 1985 The Buckinghams were featured on David Fishof’s renowned 'Happy Together Tour' with The Turtles, Gary Lewis & The Playboys, and The Grassroots, where they performed to SRO audiences in 125 cities. The tour was proclaimed one of the most successful shows that year by Billboard and Performance magazines.\n\nLaurie moved to San Diego, CA. in 1986 and joined the San Diego based group “The Monroes. She also co-arranged vocals for several years while working extensively in the recording studio with Wayne Nelson, lead vocalist of \"The Little River Band”. Laurie also recorded with Gary Puckett in 1998 on his first debut album since the 70’s “Is This Love” which sold over one million copies abroad. The album was later re-mixed and many of the songs were redistributed on several albums. Her strong presence on \"I Want to Know What Love Is\", \"Making Love Out of Nothing at All\" as well as Laurie and Gary's duet on \"Alone\" can be found wherever downloadable digital music is available.\n\nPapa John Phillips asked Laurie to join \"The New Mamas and the Papas\" in 1986 and toured with them both nationally and internationally as a replacement for his daughter Mackenzie Phillips for more than a year. The Folk Rock Quartet of John Phillips, Denny Doherty, Spanky McFarlane and Laurie Beebe Lewis toured the United Kingdom, Europe, the Pacific Rim and extensively throughout the United States and Canada. After Mackenzie Phillips return to the band in 1987, Laurie continued to fill in regularly until 1991 when she became a full time member after Mackenzie’s permanent departure from the band until Laurie left the group in May of 1993. In 1994, Spanky McFarlane reformed “Spanky and Our Gang” and featured Laurie as part of the gang along with some of the original members from the '60’s. She is also featured on YouTube with Spanky McFarlane in a tribute to musicians of Mother Blues, a club in Chicago that featured many classic folk artists during the 60's.\n\nIn 1999, Laurie accepted the position of music teacher at Horizon Elementary School in San Diego, CA. teaching, writing and producing musicals and mentoring eager students as a vocal coach until 2005 when she decided to pursue an active career after a long absence from the music scene. Her versatility allows her to expand to all genres of music from singing Jazz and Blues to Rockin' out with close friend \"Roni Lee\" with whom she also co-wrote and recorded keyboards & vocals on Roni's 2012 release \"One More Chance\" and 2016 release \"Heroes\".\n\nLaurie recorded with \"The Maestro of Rock\" guitarist and songwriter Dick Wagner on a song to benefit St Jude \"If I Had The Time\" (I Could Change The World) which features Rock Icons like Mark Farner, Trini Lopez, and many more!! Presently, Laurie performs as a solo artist both nationally and internationally as well as an inspirational speaker for many charities, rehabilitation centers and churches. She was a recent performer and vocal director on the Dick Wagner \"Remember The Child\" Memorial Concert in Detroit, Michigan in February of 2016 and March 2017.\n\nLaurie resides in Southern California and continues to produce & record music in her home studio in San Diego, CA. with her husband Chuck Lewis.
