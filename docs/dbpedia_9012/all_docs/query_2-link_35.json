        "text": "Some albums provide a snapshot of a musician at a particular instant in time, capturing the mood and feel of the moment. “And Laurie Lewis,” the latest release by the Berkeley bluegrass icon, works more like a time-lapse montage, distilling a thick web of friendships forged over a lifetime.\n\nA series of duets with some of acoustic music’s most accomplished artists, it’s an intimate portrait of her musical family tree. The album’s striking cover art conveys the depth of the relationships with an image of the intertwined roots of a California live oak and California bay laurel, It was created by Lewis’ longtime musical partner Tom Rozum (the mandolinist is featured on a haunting version of “Will the Circle Be Unbroken?” based on a recording by the Monroe Brothers).\n\n“When I set out to make this album it took me a while to realize how deep the connections run,” says Lewis, 69, who earned a Grammy nomination for 1995’s “The Oak and the Laurel,” a duo album with Rozum. “Everyone is such an old friend or they are someone I’ve known almost since they were born. And they’re all West Coast people.”\n\nIn many ways “And Laurie Lewis” embodies the vital intergenerational nature of an acoustic scene that encompasses bluegrass, old-time music, jazz and kindred traditions. On the opening track “You Are My Flower” she’s joined by 27-year-old bluegrass star Molly Tuttle, a vocalist and guitarist she’s known and championed since her early teens.\n\n“Molly was the perfect person for this traditional song I first heard on a Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album,” Lewis says. “She’s a guitar goddess and she created such a beautiful blend vocally. She can just lay her voice on mine. It sounds as if she’s been listening to me her whole life,” which is pretty much the case.\n\nThey also recorded “The Lonely One,” a beautiful ballad written by Emily Mann, a brilliant young banjo player, fiddler and vocalist who performs in the old-time duo Paper Wings. Much like with Tuttle, Lewis took Mann under her wing after meeting her as a young teen at the Big Sur Fiddle Camp.\n\nThe youth wave continues with two duets featuring fiddler and vocalist Tatiana Hargreaves, 24, who came into Lewis’ orbit at the age of 7 via Bluegrass at the Beach, a music camp on the Oregon coast. The Lewis originals explore divergent emotional terrain. Hargreaves evokes an anguished parent on “Mama Cry” while skittering exuberantly on “The Pika Song,” an affectionate ode to the frisky Sierra Nevada-dwelling rodent.\n\nTheir ties run deep. Hargreaves spent several years touring with Lewis and contributed some powerful fiddle work on her 2017 Grammy-nominated album “The Hazel and Alice Sessions.” It’s work that established Hargreaves as a creative force in bluegrass, a position she never anticipated before her stint with Laurie Lewis & the Right Hands.\n\n“I never considered myself a bluegrass fiddler,” says Hargreaves, who’s on the music faculty at the University of North Carolina in Durham. “I was old-time. But in college Laurie called and recruited me for the Right Hands and she made me a bluegrass fiddler. Now I teach bluegrass fiddle at UNC. Somehow she knew I had it in me. Laurie is such an important figure connecting these different generations, and this album is such a great example of that.”\n\nNot that the kids get all the attention on “and Laurie Lewis.” She tracked down a bevy of former bandmates for some of the album’s most memorable pieces, like a romping version of “Baby, That Would Sure Go Good” with bass master Todd Phillips and a glowing reunion with vocalist Kathy Kallick on Lewis’s “Old Friend.”\n\nNo piece better captures the breadth of Lewis’ music than Dick Oxtot’s “Ain’t Nobody Got the Blues Like Me,” a rollicking duet featuring another longtime friend, Barbara Higbie (on piano and vocals). Higbie was still a teenager in the mid-1970s when she started singing with Lewis in Oxtot’s traditional New Orleans-style Golden Age Jazz Band every weekend at The Point in Pt. Richmond, four sets a night. A banjo player, cornetist and singer, Oxtot was more than pleased to feature the talented young women.\n\n“We were so lucky to be the youngsters on that scene,” Higbie says. “Everybody but us in that band was collecting Social Security. I played piano, Laurie played bass, and we sang a lot of duets. Even way back then her voice was a commanding force. She did a lot of big Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith blues, a real departure from bluegrass singing that showcased her voice in a different way.”\n\nThe sound is timeless, but Lewis also seems dialed into the anxiety-ridden zeitgeist on the album’s only a cappella track, the lament and clarion call for solidarity “Troubled Times.” With Leah Wollenberg joining Lewis on vocals, it’s an arresting performance that seems to speak directly to our sheltered-in-place moment, though she actually wrote the song years ago. Their rough-hewn harmonies evoke the struggles and resilience that have carried Americans through previous dark passages as they sing the refrain “We’ll face these troubled times and see them through.” Amen.\n\nContact Andrew Gilbert at jazzscribe@aol.com.\n\nLISTEN\n\nNew album “And Laurie Lewis” is available at www.laurielewis.com/store"
