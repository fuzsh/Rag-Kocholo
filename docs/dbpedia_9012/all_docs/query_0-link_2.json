        "text": "For nearly four decades, Laurie Lewis has gathered fans and honors for her powerful and emotive voice and her versatile, dynamic songwriting. She is a sought-after recording producer and an equally skilled teacher and mentor. And she is an inspiration and a ground-breaker – across genres, across geography and across gender barriers.\n\nLaurie has shown us how a woman can blend into any part of the classic bluegrass singing trio, and she showed us how a great voice could move fluidly between bluegrass and other types of music. She showed us how a female fiddler could emulate the strength and grit of the early bluegrass musicians. She has shown how a Californian can appeal to traditional bluegrass audiences, as well as winning acclaim in the worlds of Americana and folk music. She has shown us how to lead bands of talented musicians – learning from them while helping them make their best music. And she has shown us how to thrive in a constantly changing musical environment – without ever sacrificing her art.\n\nNina was born and raised on the outskirts of Sebastopol, a semi-rural town in Northern California, where she grew up surrounded by fields, fruit trees and horses under wide blue skies. I have known her as a friend and collaborator for over four decades now, and I know, like me, that she is deeply rooted in the landscape, the colors, the aromas, and the sounds of her homeland. Her artistry has carried her all over the world, but she always comes home, to a place that, however hard it might be to scratch out an artist’s living, won’t quite let her go. For that, we Westerners are most grateful.\n\nA little back-story: as a teenager, in 1975, Nina saw Kate Wolf perform at a pizza parlor in her hometown and fell under the spell of Kate’s songs and emotive singing, and decided that she wanted to play guitar in Kate’s band. And by god, three years later, after pledging her soul to the box of wood and wire, she had achieved that goal. She played with Kate until Kate’s untimely death in 1986.\n\nNina claims never to listen to lyrics, yet always plays the right fill or backup line in just the right place. Maybe she listens beyond the lyric, to the intention, and responds to that. Or maybe she actually DOES hear the lyric but is too much of a tough guy to admit to it. However she does it, Nina makes magic happen as few can. Sure, she has the technical chops and knows the fingerboard, but it’s what one does with those tools that sets the artist apart from the technician. And Nina is an artist—one who has made a profession of giving wings to songwriters’ scribbles. And I’m not talking paper airplanes.\n\nNina is sought-after as a teacher, an arranger, and producer. She is known to be exacting and demanding—but no more demanding of others than she is of herself. I have no idea the number of credits Nina has on recordings, both as a backup musician and as a producer, but it wouldn’t surprise me if it were in the thousands. Her care with tone, tuning, and timing, combined with her ability to grasp the big picture in a piece of music have kept her busy. She has played with a real who’s who of folk music royalty but you never hear her flaunting her credits. She will give the same care to a first-time nervous music camp participant presenting their new-born baby song to the world that she gives when backing up luminaries such as Greg Brown, Karla Bonoff, Kate Wolf, Dave Alvin, Lucy Kaplansky, Rosalie Sorrels, Mollie O’Brien, Nanci Griffith, or any of the rest of us. With Nina, it’s all about the depth, and she’s never out of hers.\n\n– Laurie Lewis\n\nGrammy Award-winning musician Laurie Lewis is internationally renowned as a singer, songwriter, fiddler, bandleader, producer and educator. She was a founding member of the Good Ol’ Persons and the Grant Street String Band and has performed and recorded since 1986 with her musical partner, mandolinist Tom Rozum. Laurie has twice been voted “Female Vocalist of the Year” by the International Bluegrass Music Association and has won the respect and admiration of her peers.\n\nLinda Ronstadt speaks for many when she says of Laurie: “Her voice is a rare combination of grit and grace, strength and delicacy. Her stories are always true.” A pioneering woman in bluegrass, Laurie has paved the way for many young women today, always guided by her own love of traditional music and the styles of her heroes that came before. At the same time, she has steadfastly followed her personal muse and remained open to new influences.\n\nDespite “a botched run-in with the piano” at age seven, and several years of classical violin lessons starting at 12, Laurie’s musical passion was aroused not by a printed score, but by an earthier sound she found just down the street from her family’s home in Berkeley, California—at the annual Berkeley Folk Festival.\n\nInspired by the music she heard at the festival, Laurie started learning guitar and then bluegrass banjo. A friend took her to Paul’s Saloon in San Francisco, a bar that featured bluegrass music every night, and Laurie experienced a life-changing epiphany. “I saw fiddlers live,” she remembers, “and it knocked me out. I realized I could be a fiddler.”\n\nLaurie was soon on stage at Paul’s playing bass for the Phantoms of the Opry. In 1974, she helped found an all-female bluegrass band called the Good Ol’ Persons. Next was a group called Old Friends, and in 1979, the Grant Street String Band.\n\nIn 1980, Laurie opened a shop called Marin Violin and ran it full time for eight years before the pull to make a solo record became too strong to ignore. Plus, she had begun writing songs, inspired by songwriters ranging from Jean Ritchie and John Prine to Hoagy Carmichael and Chuck Berry.\n\n“If I just do this one recording,” she thought, “I’ll get my songs out the way I hear them in my head, and then I can go back to my violin shop. What happened instead was I just felt so much more alive and so much happier in the recording studio and working on my music than I did in my violin shop, that I finished my album, sold the shop, and never looked back.” It was an artistic reawakening, and from that point forward, Laurie would make her living solely from making music.\n\nThat solo debut, Restless Rambling Heart, co-produced with Tim O’Brien and released on Flying Fish Records in 1986, featured seven of Laurie’s original songs. The release of that album sparked interest in Laurie as a performing songwriter and bluegrass bandleader, paving the way for a career as a touring musician.\n\nLaurie has since recorded nearly 20 albums in a number of musical formats for such labels as Flying Fish, Rounder, Hightone, Sugar Hill, Kaleidoscope and her own label, Spruce & Maple Music. Her latest album with her band the Right Hands (Tom Rozum, Chad Manning, Patrick Sauber and Andrew Conklin), The Hazel and Alice Sessions, was nominated for the “Best Bluegrass Recording” Grammy in 2017.\n\nAlso in 1986, Laurie started performing and recording with the gifted mandolinist and singer, Tom Rozum. Their musical collaboration has now spanned more than three decades. “A huge part of my music,” Laurie says, “is knowing that I have a partner and a voice like that to sing the harmonies. And he’s really important in terms of arranging.”\n\nProducing has become an increasingly important part of Laurie’s work in music. In addition to her own recordings, she has produced 14 records and counting, starting with Scott Nygaard’s acclaimed guitar instrumental album No Hurry. In 1999, she began working with Hot Rize guitarist Charles Sawtelle and upon his death, she completed the album he had started, Music from Rancho de Ville. In 2012, Laurie jumped at the chance to produce an album for one of her musical heroes, Alice Gerrard, for Alice’s first CD of all-original material. In recent years, Laurie has produced albums by several young Bay Area musicians, including Melody Walker and Jacob Groopman, American Nomad and The T Sisters.\n\nLaurie is a committed music educator, teaching at prestigious camps, festivals and workshops in the U.S. and Canada. She has organized and run camps—Bluegrass Week at Augusta Heritage Center for 10 years and Bluegrass at the Beach in Oregon for 14—and taught at the Telluride Bluegrass Academy (CO), Puget Sound Guitar Workshop (WA), Swannanoa Gathering (NC), California Bluegrass Association Music Camp (CA) and RockyGrass Academy (CO).\n\nThe International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) in Nashville has bestowed several awards upon Laurie, including Female Vocalist of the Year (twice); Song of the Year for her recording of “Who Will Watch the Home Place”; and shared awards for Album of the Year for True Life Blues: The Songs of Bill Monroe and Recorded Event of the Year for True Life Blues and Follow Me Back to the Fold: A Tribute to Women in Bluegrass.\n\nThough her music transcends the formal limitations of style and genre, Laurie Lewis still sees herself as a bluegrass musician. “I’ve always thought that bluegrass was basically a singer-songwriter with string band,” she explains. “Think Bill Monroe, Carter Stanley, Lester Flatt, etc. I like to think that I fit that description and trajectory of the music rather well. I’m able to express myself in a way that sounds like me, and people either like it or not. I like to do what I do, and it fits comfortably in the bluegrass camp in my head. I don’t care what other people call it.”2017RightHands\n\nLaurie Lewis and the Right Hands will be at Wintergrass 2015 playing 2 sets on Saturday . Laurie’s music has twice won her the California’s Women’s Fiddling championships,a Grammy for her part in True Life Blues: The Songs of Bill Monroe 1997, nominated with Tom Rozum for a Grammy with The Oak and the Laurel, in the category of Best Traditional Folk Album of 1995, and twice named Female Vocalist of the Year by the IBMA (International Bluegrass Music Association). They always are great live with originals songs, great instrumentals and some times you even get Laurie doing some dancing.\n\nTom has been playing mandolin and singing with Laurie since 1986. Tom’s versatility and diverse musical influences come to the fore every night on stage with the band. He plays primarily mandolin with the band, but is also an accomplished fiddle, mandola, and guitar player. His background as a rock and swing musician adds a uniquely satisfying flavor to the band.\n\nChad Manning, who has wo n plaudits as the fiddler with the David Grisman Bluegrass Experience, is a much-sought-after teacher, and greatly in demand as a session player. Chad has been playing fiddle since the age of 8, and toured the Northwest extensively with his family’s band, Homeward Bound. As a teenager Chad twice won Washington State Junior Fiddle Championships. He also placed in the top five in the Junior and Adult divisions at the National Old Time Fiddler’s Contest in Weiser, Idaho.\n\nPatrick Sauber on banjo, has been playing old-time, Cajun, and bluegrass music ever since he can remember. His introduction to performing came at the knee of his father, old-time master fiddler and claw-hammer banjo player Tom Sauber, a stalwart of the traditional music scene in Southern California. Under the guidance of his father (with whom he still performs), . Patrick has recorded or performed with many artists, including Doc Watson, Herb Pedersen, Weird Al Yankovic, The Limeliters, Richard Greene, Christ Stuart & Backcountry, Dirk Powell, and many others. In 2003, Christopher Guest asked Patrick to be the banjo player in The New Main Street Singers in the folk-music satire movie, A Mighty Wind. Patrick also played on the soundtrack CD and toured with the film’s cast.\n\nAndrew is a composer, guitarist, double bassist, sound artist, and teacher. Andrew grew up near Philadelphia, in Wyndmoor, PA, and studied jazz guitar with Philadelphia shredder Ed Scott. He attended Oberlin College, emerging with a bachelor’s degree in jazz guitar. He has written pieces for orchestra, chamber ensemble, jazz band, and choir, and his music has been performed across the nation by groups ranging from the Oberlin Jazz Septet to the Germantown Friends School Choir. His bass-playing combines perfect timing with a playful sensibility that allows him to craft lines that knit the ensemble together seamlessly; his occasional solos are real gems of melodic invention and rhythmic intensity. Andrew is a much-sought-after bassist; besides gigging with The Right Hands, he performs with other Bay Area acts, including Quinn, Timosaurus, and Host Family. As if his plate weren’t full enough already, Andrew is currently pursuing a master’s degree in composition at San Francisco State University. He can be heard on Laurie’s CD, Blossoms.\n\nLaurie Lewis and the Right Hands will be at Wintergrass 2013 playing both on Thursday and Saturday. Laurie’s music has twice won her the California’s Women’s Fiddling championships,a Grammy for her part in True Life Blues: The Songs of Bill Monroe 1997, nominated with Tom Rozum for a Grammy with The Oak and the Laurel, in the category of Best Traditional Folk Album of 1995, and twice named Female Vocalist of the Year by the IBMA (International Bluegrass Music Association).
