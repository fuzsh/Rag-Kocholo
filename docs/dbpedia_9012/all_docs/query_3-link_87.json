        "text": "History of BCHC\n\nA History of the Bell County Historical Commission\n\nIn 1952, Winnie Allen, University of Texas archivist, produced a document entitled “A Tentative Plan for a State Program of Texas Life.” Allen suggested creation of a non-partisan state board to locate, preserve, and publish materials concerning Texas history. She further mentioned the need for a state-backed foundation to finance historical projects.1\n\nAllen’s suggestion found a receptive response in Austin and State Senator Carolos Carroll Ashley, Sr., noted poet-laureate 1949-51, lawyer, and rancher, introduced Senate Concurrent Resolution 44 during the 53rd regular legislative session to begin implementation of Allen’s proposal. The Texas Senate passed Ashley’s resolution on 11 May 1953 and the House of Representatives approved it on 20 May 1953. SCR 44 created a temporary committee of 18 citizens to coordinate studying and preserving historical Texas documents before they were lost to later generations. Ashley’s resolution proposed creating “a Survey Committee.” The governor appointed the 18 members of this new committee. The state provided no funding for this committee but did authorize state agencies interested in the subject matter, such as institutions of higher learning, to cooperate with the committee and to assist the survey. Further, the committee was to study legal and practical issues involved in establishing a statewide historical foundation to serve as a statewide coordinator of activities designed to preserve historic sites and matters, as Allen had suggested in her 1952 suggestion.2\n\nThe Survey Committee had to submit a report of its findings to the 54th legislature in 1955. The anticipation was that the report would inform the legislature on how the state could employ private funds to carry out the job of promoting preservation of historic Texas materials and resources for the benefit of future generations.3\n\nImmediately after Senate Concurrent Resolution 44 went into effect in September 1953, Governor Allan Shivers appointed the 18 members of what became known as the Texas Historical Survey Committee. The first president of the committee was Judge James E. Wheat of Tyler County. The group’s first meeting was on November 17, 1953. The committee divided its work into subcommittees on “archives and records; museums; parks; education; finance; and houses, sites, and landmarks.” During late 1953 and most of 1954, subcommittees worked on preservation ideas for their respective areas of responsibility to enable the survey committee to compile a report for the next legislative session that would begin in January 1955.4\n\nThe Texas Historical Survey Committee submitted its report to the 54th regular legislation session demonstrating a need “for a coordinated statewide effort in the historical heritage field.” Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 28, approved by the Texas Senate on April 11, 1955, and by the Texas House of Representatives on May 2, 1955, authorized the committee to continue its “study of the preservation and dissemination of records of Texas and Texas life during the biennium beginning September 1, 1955, and shall make a report to the 55th Legislature concerning the activities and recommendations of the Committee.” In continuing its work, the committee secured approval to accept payments and/or donations to fund its work.5\n\nThe temporary Texas Historical Survey Committee continued its work from 1955 until 1957 when the 55th Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 426 converting it to a permanent “state agency for the purpose of providing leadership and coordinating services in the field of historical preservation.” Members of the temporary survey committee continued in their positions in the new permanent agency, but they would begin serving staggered six-year terms so that one-third of them would rotate off every two years. The committee had the power to erect historical markers, check the historical accuracy of marker inscriptions, and determine the worthiness of any historical property the state decided to purchase.6\n\nAlthough the three laws passing the legislature in 1953, 1955, and 1957 did not mention creation of county historical survey committees, nonetheless, some counties did so. For instance, on April 26, 1956, the Matagorda County Commissioners Court created its own Matagorda County Historical Survey Committee composed of twelve members. This early survey committee linked itself to the Texas Historical Foundation, the Texas Historical Survey Committee’s fundraising arm. The purpose Matagorda County created its survey committee was to report its work on what it was doing “in the historic heritage realm, and to see what each needs to do.”7\n\nTwo years after Matagorda County formed its local survey committee to work with the Texas Historical Foundation, in 1958, Robert Casey, Harris County judge, and the Harris County Commissioners Court, established the Harris County Historical Survey Committee. Arthur Lefevre, Jr. was the first chairman of the group serving from 1958 through 1962. The Harris County Historical Survey Committee had some powerful individuals serving on it including Miss Ima Hogg, George R. Brown, William B. Bates, and former Governor William P. Hobby. The Harris County website reporting formation of its survey committee does not detail whether it linked to the Texas Historical Foundation or to the Texas Historic Survey Committee.8\n\nThere is slight evidence Bell County created a survey committee in 1958 although there are no records of the organization in the county’s archival system. There are no news articles in local Bell County newspapers reporting on creation of the survey committee in 1958; however, on June 11, 1968, Berneta Peeples, a local historian and reporter for the Belton Journal, spoke to the Belton Rotary Club and said, among other things, said that Judge William Alexander Messer, Sr. appointed member of the Bell County Historical Survey Committee in 1958. Peeples told Rotarians that the state’s governor had asked Edgar Eugene Griffith of Salado and Mrs. Forace Bass (Helen Leigh) Russell, owner of the Belton Journal, to recommend names of citizens to be appointed to this group and that Messer had appointed from the list. Peeples said this early survey committee lasted about 3 years. If Griffith and Russell prepared a listing of citizens appointed to the survey committee, it no longer exists; however, in early May 1958, about a month before her speech to the Belton Rotary Club, Peeples observed that Herbert Fletcher of Salado had been one of the 1958 appointees to the survey committee. At the Central Texas Pioneer Club meeting in June 1962, Fletcher, master of ceremonies of the afternoon historical program, mentioned that George W. Hill was the executive director of the Texas State Historical Survey Committee, and Fletcher said the state committee’s membership included Mrs. Richard D. Haines, Mrs. John Stell (June Alexander) Hill, William Dayton Kelley, Sr., Mrs. E. L. Hill, Mrs. Frances Geiger, Dr. Albert Compton Broders, Jr., and Mrs. Henry Clay (Mary Louise) de Grummond. All these individuals Fletcher identified as members of the state survey committee lived in Bell County. Fletcher did not name himself. Fletcher did not say these local citizens were members of a Bell County Historical Survey Committee but that they had an ill-defined relationship with the state survey committee. So, the issue remains, if Bell County had a survey committee in 1958, it only probably lasted about 3 years and was it likely did not exist after 1961. When the county did establish its survey committee in 1963, several of the individuals Fletcher identified in 1962 were on it.9\n\nAfter the legislature’s established the Texas Historical Survey Committee on a permanent agency basis in 1957 and giving it authority, among other delegations, of administering state historical markers, it required several years of work and planning on how to implement a state historical marker program. After four or five years of preparation, the Texas Historical Survey Committee established the Official Texas Historical Marker Program in 1962. This program implemented the legislative authorization for this historic preservation tool and provided the mechanism for the Texas Historical Survey Committee to review marker applications submitted to it and for the State Marker Review Board to approve all inscriptions placed on markers throughout the state. The state survey committee needed county organizations able to provide leadership to local groups and individuals desiring to erect historical markers and submitting them for approval.10\n\nIn 1963, the year after formation of the Official Historical Marker Program, the legislature passed Senate Bill No. 241 authorizing county judges to appoint county historical survey committees composed of at least seven members for a term of two years. The law authorizes counties to pay necessary expenses of these local survey committees. The purpose for these county bodies was to “carry out a survey of the county to determine the existence of historical buildings, battlefields, private collections of historical memorabilia, or other historical features within the county, and shall thereafter continue to collect data on the same subject as it may become available.” The Senate Bill declared the subject matter an emergency enabling the legislation to become effective the day both chambers approved it. The Texas Senate approved S. B. No. 241 on March 21, 1963, and the House concurred on April 30th. This law took effect on May 14, 1963.11\n\nPrior to the legislative session that began in January 1963 and enactment of Senate Bill No. 241, John Bowden Connally had won the November 1962 gubernatorial election. In between his election in November and his inauguration in mid-January 1963, both the Texas Historical Survey Committee and Governor-Elect Connally anticipated passage of what became Senate Bill No. 241. The evidence for this is that the Texas Historical Survey Committee, at least in December 1962, requested each county judge in the state to appoint a local historical survey committee. Dr. Rupert Norval Richardson, president of the Texas Historical Survey Committee, said, “The appointment of County Historical Survey Committees will enable the counties to preserve the unique history found in every county and town in the state.” Governor-elect Connally expressed his desire for county survey committees by declaring January 19, 1963, as Historical Preservation Day. The governor-elect anticipated every county judge meeting with a newly formed historical survey committee his or her commissioners court created. The hope was that this would occur in every county.12\n\nBell County Judge Thomas Raymond Thornton did as requested and met with the newly formed Bell County Historical Survey Committee on Sunday afternoon, 27 January 1963 (the group had to delay its intended organization on January 19 due to a variety of reasons). The newly organized group selected John Poindexter Landers of Temple as its chairman. Other officers and committee chairmen were Dr. Albert Compton Broders, Jr., vice-chairman; Mrs. Sterling Clack (Mary Lucile Armstrong) Robertson, secretary; William Dayton Kelley, Sr. of Belton, chairman of the Historical Markings Committee; James Kuykendall Evetts, Sr., chairman of the Legislative Committee; Mrs. Robertson, chairman of the Museum Committee; and Judge Thornton, chairman of the Archives Committee. Members of the Bell County Historical Survey Committee, besides those already identified, were Mrs. Omar Lester (Sarah Belle) Fletcher of Temple, Mrs. Henry Clay (Mary Louise) de Grummond of Salado, Mrs. Helen Mewhinney Dobbs of Holland, Aubrey Lee Thompson of Troy, Mrs. Max (Gladys Jean) Fergus and Mrs. Ben Arnold (Ernest) Norman, Sr., both of Killeen.13\n\nOnce formed, the Bell County Historical Survey Committee worked speedily on the Official State Historical Marker Program and completed the process of filing and securing approval of its first marker for the home of Mr. and Mrs. Dan Lewis Steakley, known as “Century Oaks.” The Steakley home, located on Marlanwood Road in Temple, dates to 1874, seven years before Temple’s founding. The owners had beautifully restored the historic structure originally built by Francis Lewis Wright. The Steakley medallion presentation was on Friday, November 8, 1963. Soon other presentations followed.14\n\nIn 1964, the Texas Historical Survey Committee created RAMPS, a program emphasizing the need for recording, appreciation, marking, preservation, and surveying the state’s history. The goal of RAMPS was to encourage erection of 5,000 markers in between 1964-69. Through the efforts of many citizens, the Texas Historical Survey Committee met its objective and erected its 5,000 markers in late 1969, a couple of months before the deadline. The Bell County Historical Survey Committee implemented the state RAMPS program locally.15\n\nWhen the Bell County judge encouraged citizens to serve on the local historical survey committee in 1963, the county budget did not contain any funds for the new group since the count adopts its fiscal year budget in September each year. In August 1965, while preparing the 1966 fiscal year budget, the county added a new line item providing the survey committee with $600 a year. The county had created the committee in 1963, and now it began providing financial assistance for its endeavors. The appropriation would be available to the Bell County Historical Survey Committee only to for paying the fee to receive a historical marker. At the time the county provided this funding, the Texas Historical Survey Committee matched a county’s payment in obtaining a marker. Bell County Judge William Carl Black, who had replaced Thornton following his resignation and move from the area, believed historical markers helped attract tourists to the area and that “tourism is becoming one of the best sources of revenue in the state.” County leaders saw the survey committee’s appropriation, then, as an investment to attract tourists to come and see historical sights.16\n\nDuring either the summer or fall of 1965, about the time the Commissioners Court was adding funds for its use, the Bell County Historical Survey Committee ceased to function. The main reason for the disintegration of the group was that several of its members had either died or moved from the area (Landers, the chairman, a college teacher, moved from the area, and Dr. Broders, vice-chairman, had died in 1964, to mention only the two top officers), . Bell County Judge Black, at the end of 1965, announced he wanted to rejuvenate the survey committee, and have it work with another group, the Bell County Historical Society, in preserving local history. There is no explanation of how Judge Black anticipated the survey committee and historical society would work together, but, presumably, he meant that they both had the goal of promoting and preserving the county’s history. Several residents of the county came forward expressing a desire to serve on a reorganized survey committee, so the re-organized group met on January 13, 1966, to revive the dormant group. Miss Vada Sutton of Belton wanted to serve on the committee and, presumably, Judge Black named her secretary of the in-reorganization-group. Judge Black announced he would preside at the January 13 reorganization session.17\n\nReorganizing the survey committee went well and the group elected James W. “Andy” Anderson of Temple as its new chairman. Other officers included Judge Black as vice-chairman, Sutton of Belton as secretary, and Lee Madden of Belton as treasurer. Anderson announced committee chairmen to be Madden, Archives; Mrs. David Houston (Anavi) Buchanan of Temple, Parks and Recreation; Mrs. Robertson of Salado, Museum; J. B. Marshall of Little River, Churches and Cemeteries; and Kelley of Belton, Houses and Sites. The committee was back in business with new leadership and some new members.18\n\nThe reorganized committee met quarterly and it gradually added other members. By April 1966, its membership included Miss Lena Armstrong and Miss Berneta Peeples of Belton. In addition, Mrs. Billy Joe (Wanda Lamberth) Donaldson of Temple had joined the group as had Carl Hudson Allen, Jr. and Birt Brooks both of Temple, Richmond Norrell Allison and Mary Teresa Hartrick Allison both of Little River, and Mrs. Woody C. (Ellie) Hamilton and Mrs. Frances Geiger both of Belton. There were 23 members at the April committee meeting.19\n\nAt its April 14, 1966, meeting, the group approved a recommendation to prepare applications for four historical markers. The sub-committee bringing this recommendation to the group believed it should recommend one marker in each of the four county commissioner precincts. Since the commissioners court had approved funds to purchase historical markers, the committee wished to show no favoritism to any precinct in the county. The group approved a marker for the county’s second (called the “old”) jail in Precinct One, Miriam Amanda Ferguson’s birthplace in Precinct Two; Governors James and Miriam Ferguson’s home in Precinct Three; and Comanche Gap in Precinct Four. The sub-committee assigned four of its members responsible for writing one of the four marker applications. William Franklin Harlow was to complete the application for the county jail, William August “Happy” Durham was to complete the application for Ferguson’s birthplace, Dr. John Q. Thompson was to complete the application for the Ferguson’s home in Temple, and Mrs. Ed Hunter and Mrs. Reid (Minnie Elizabeth) Henderson were to complete the application for Comanche Gap.20\n\nThe reorganized committee did not lack for ambitious projects. In June 1966, the committee considered two significant historical objectives it wanted to achieve. One was to restore the site of Fort Griffin, and the other was to establish a museum for Bell County.21\n\nThe original Fort Griffin dates to November 1836 when Texas Rangers, under the command of George B. Erath, constructed it. The fort, known variously as the Little River Fort, Smith’s Fort, and the Block House, most often goes by the name of Fort Griffin recognizing that it sat on Moses Griffin’s league of land acquired from Empresario Sterling Clack Robertson. The fort, covering about one-half an acre of land, included a block-house, seven or eight cabins, and a stockade encircled the buildings. The stockade walls were about 8 or 10 feet high. A water source lay about 100 yards outside the stockade. Griffin built his home about 40-50 yards immediately south of the fort. The fort was never continuously manned and ceased to be of military use by the spring of 1837 because area residents had vacated their property seeking safety in what is called the “Runaway Scrape.” However, after citizens returned to the area in the 1840s, they used the old fort for years for various purposes. Moses Griffin’s daughter, Frances Caroline Delafield Heard McCray Hasley, acquired the property with the fort and it subsequently passed on to other family members. This old fort, located at the intersection of Hartrick Bluff Spur and FM 436 between Belton and Little-River/Academy, is what the committee ambitiously hoped to reconstruct by acquiring 10-acres to accommodate parking spaces for visitors to the site and picnic facilities for families to enjoy.22\n\nThe survey committee’s idea for a museum included acquiring 25-acres of land with a large building on it. The museum would have adequate parking spaces and picnic areas, and highlight furniture, farm equipment, and anything representative of Bell County back to about 1850. Initial comments on the museum indicated that its location might need to be in the Salado area because “much of the early history of Bell County is centered there.”23\n\nThese two ideas were indeed ambitious undertakings; however, they must have been too ambitious. Neither of these suggestions ever came to fruition. Maybe the committee believed it was not harmful to dream, even to dream on a huge scale.\n\nAt its September 1966 meeting, the committee voted to begin 2-year terms for officers effective January 1967. The committee elected officers who would fill the longer-term positions with James W. “Andy” Anderson reelected chairman, Richmond Norrell Allison elected vice-chairman, Miss Vada Sutton reelected secretary, Lee Madden re-elected treasurer. After serving for about a year as vice-chairman, Allison resigned, and the committee elected William August “Happy” Durham to fill the vacated position.24\n\nAt its June 1967 meeting, about 18 months after its re-organization in January 1966, the historical survey committee adopted bylaws under which it would operate. In addition to the bylaws, the committee discussed a matter suggested by Bell County School Superintendent Beauford Connally Neal, chairman of the committee’s Education Committee. The suggestion was to mark Bell County “one-room schoolhouses.” The discussion included a need for Neal to investigate the cost of such markers and that individuals would be able to purchase these through his office. A donor’s name would appear on the marker. Education Committee Chairman Neal followed upon this issue and reported at the July 20, 1967, meeting that the idea of marking one-room schools in the county had met with a great response from the public since first suggested in June. The Bell County Historical Survey Committee adopted this marker program and set the price for markers at $25 each. The survey committee directed any citizen interested in obtaining one of these makers should contact Neal at his county superintendent’s office in Belton. As of mid-June 1968, after a year of making these school markers available, citizens had purchased three.25\n\nThe Bell County Historical Survey Committee continued its work in the years after 1968 as did the state organization. In early March 1973 State Representative Ross Brothers McAlister (from Lubbock County) introduced House Bill No. 1512 which proposed to change the name of the state historical preservation group’s name to the Texas Historical Commission, and local county organizations would follow suit. The belief was that changing the name of the Texas State Historical Survey Committee’s work had developed into one far broader than its original purpose and that the name change would enable the group to fulfill its functions better. The legislature passed H. B. 1512 in mid-May 1973. [ii] Before the end of May 1973, the Bell County Historical Survey Committee has voted to change its name to the Bell County Historical Commission. While the local group voted to change its name, it was years before some Bell Countians stopped referring to the organization as the Bell County Historical Survey Committee.26\n\nThe Bell County Historical Commission has continued its work continuously from its January 1966 re-organization until the present. During all these years the commission has enjoyed the services of countless volunteers and has remained faithful to its mission of preserving and promoting the county’s history.\n\nAuthor: David Yeilding, Ph.D.\n\nClick Here for a printable document of this history.\n\nENDNOTES\n\n1 Handbook of Texas Online, Alice J.

In an August 1969 Journal article written without attribution as to its author, one reads the same inaccurate allegation attributing the start of the Salado museum to the survey committee. Chapter 1 of this writing shows that the Bell County Historical Society assisted in starting the Central Texas Area Museum and the Bell County Historical Survey Committee, if it even existed in 1959 and that is questionable, had no role to play in the museum’s development.
