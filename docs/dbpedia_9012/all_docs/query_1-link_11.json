        "meta_description": "Freight &#39;98 by Laurie Lewis, released 01 January 2021\n\n1. Visualize\n2. Refugee\n3. Girlfriend Guard Your Heart\n4. Ban and Balm\n5. Fine Line\n6. Tattoo\n7. I Will Take Back My Heart\n8. Love Is a Lonely Street\n9. Angel on His Shoulder\n10. Kiss Me Before I Die\n11. Knocking on Your Door Again\n\nThere’s no beating a live album. The thrill of a flawless execution, knowing this wasn’t just one of a dozen takes. The lightning reflexes as one musician responds to a subtle improvisation from another. The raw, vulnerable, adrenaline-fueled emotion that’s so rarely achieved in the closed system of the recording studio. This collection captures all the immediacy and energy of live performance from some of the best, with a clarity of sound like you’ve got a front row seat. — Allegra Thompson \r\n\r\nMany thanks to Paul for capturing the music; to the Freight, my hometown venue, for providing a testing ground throughout my entire career; and to my incredibly talented and wonderful friends for learning my songs. Thanks, Allegra, for insightful ears (is that a thing?); and to you, The Listener.",
