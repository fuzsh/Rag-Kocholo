With family in tow, Laurie arrived on Bainbridge Island in 1991 to pursue a career in corporate Seattle as a CPA with an MBA. She inevitably recognized her affinity for the not-for-profit sector and has devoted the last 20 years to the art of financial and operational leadership for mission-driven organizations. Laurie honed her business skills during 16 years at IslandWood, then transported her knowledge base to New Zealand to provide strategic guidance to a start-up group of sustainable companies formed to benefit the local New Zealand communities.

After five years in Michigan, Maradel returned to the Pacific Northwest and became active with the effort to protect Oregon’s coastal beaches for public use. She then enrolled in the UO Law School, at a time when women were just beginning to enter the law sector in significant numbers. Maradel’s primary career was as a Professor at the University of Oregon, where she taught courses in legal issues in planning and public administration, environmental law, and leadership skills.Upon retirement, Maradel returned to the Puget Sound area and settled on Bainbridge Island, where she was appointed to the city’s Planning Commission, on which she served for 11 years.
