Moved to the mountains in Colorado and worked for vail resorts. On a whim, I moved to San Diego to pursue commercial dive school as the only female in my program of 18. Completed the trade school certified in Dive Medicine Technology. After some time between school, I returned to Colorado, Denver this time as a certified hyperbaric technologist and EMT. One year in Denver, I returned back to San Diego still in hyperbarics, working at an outpatient facility and emergency dives at UCSD. After covid, I took a break from healthcare and worked remote in mortgage. This allowed me the opportunity to travel, leavingCA, returned to MI to see family for some time and decided to live in Memphis Tenesseee and New Orleans for a few months before returning home. Continuing to take advantage of the freedom remote work offered, I moved to Phoenix Arizona. After an unexpected lay off in Feb 2022, I decided to pursue becoming a personal trainer. After working at multiple gyms, I was offered an opportunity to work Hyperbarics again at a private wellness center.\n\nLife took a few unexpected turns, and making the decision to want to be closer to family and back in Michigan after 8 years, I returned to Michigan, moved to Gran Haven and the rest is history 😊\n\nHobbies/sports/recreation:\n\n-running\n\n-kayaking\n\n-weight lifting\n\n-cooking\n\nLicenses/Affiliations/Memberships:\n\nNASM Certified Personal Trainer\n\nNBHMDT certified hyperbaric technologist\n\nNational Registered Emergency Technician (NREMT)\n\naura has previous experience as a sales manager for three furniture stores and a home accessory store that were located in Lafayette, IN.
