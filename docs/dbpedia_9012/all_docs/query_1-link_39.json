WBCM Radio Bristolâs Farm and Fun Time broadcasts live before a studio audience and recorded for television syndication on Blue Ridge PBS, East Tennessee PBS, and PBS North Carolina. It can be accessed on 100.1 FM in the Bristol area, or online at BirthplaceOfCountryMusic.org and on Radio Bristolâs free mobile app. Viewers may also tune in to watch through Radio Bristolâs Facebook page.\n\nAbout Laurie Louis\n\n“Her voice is a rare combination of grit and grace, strength and delicacy. Her stories always ring true.” ~ Linda Ronstadt\n\n“To ask how Laurie Lewisâs music is relevant in this day and age, in the broader folk, Americana, and bluegrass scenes as a whole, would be similar to asking how a brick in a homeâs foundation is relevant to its structure. Her influence, her reach and her artistic intent are quiet stalwarts on which so much has been built.” ~ Justin Hiltner, Bluegrass Situation\n\nFor nearly four decades, Laurie Lewis has gathered fans and honors for her powerful and emotive voice and her versatile, dynamic songwriting. She is a sought-after recording producer and an equally skilled teacher and mentor.\n\nAnd she is an inspiration and a ground-breaker â across genres, across geography and across gender barriers.\n\nLaurie has shown us how a woman can blend into any part of the classic bluegrass singing trio, and she showed us how a great voice could move fluidly between bluegrass and other types of music. She showed us how a female fiddler could emulate the strength and grit of the early bluegrass musicians. She has shown how a Californian can appeal to traditional bluegrass audiences, as well as winning acclaim in the worlds of Americana and folk music.\n\nShe has shown us how to lead bands of talented musicians â learning from them while helping them make their best music. And she has shown us how to thrive in a constantly changing musical environment â without ever sacrificing her art.\n\nAlthough she has played roots music since her teenage years and performed in various bands from her early 20s, it wasnât until she was 36 that Laurie decided to venture out on her own. Her solo recording, Restless Rambling Heart, introduced the national music audience to Laurieâs talents and versatility. The CD, produced by Tim OâBrien, features seven originals and showcases her stunning vocal range and control.\n\nSince that time, Laurie has twice been named Female Vocalist of the Year by the International Bluegrass Music Association, and won Song of the Year for her rendition of the now-standard âWho Will Watch the Home Place?â She has collaborated on numerous other award-winning recordings.\n\nWhile steeped in the bluegrass tradition, Laurieâs songwriting demonstrates her ability to surpass the limitations of that genre. Her works reflect her wide range of influences: from old time and country to Tin Pan Alley, jazz standards and early rock ân roll.\n\nHer songs have been recorded by Kathy Mattea, Patsy Montana and the First Ladies of Bluegrass, led by Missy Raines, among others.\n\nPoet, essayist, novelist, and environmental activist Wendell Berry has asked her to set some of his poems to music.\n\nLaurie has been nominated for GRAMMYs for her own projects and has been prominently featured on othersâ GRAMMY-winning works.\n\nAbout Shay Martin Lovette\n\nThe tale of wayfaring songwriter Shay Martin Lovette is shaped by an enduring creative pursuit, an inseparable connection with the natural world, and a deep appreciation of the nonpareil musical voices of the past. Two years after his noteworthy debut, “Swift Drifter,” Lovette brings forth his sophomore record “Scatter & Gather,” a collection of songs that signal an undeniable shift in the gravity of his writing and arranging. Written mostly from a remote, creek-side cabin, the songs reflect Lovette’s role as a versatile harmonica-wielding, wordsmith, drifting between the formulas of folk, indie, and homestyle roots music.\n\nLovetteâs songcraft has elicited high praise from American Songwriter, The Bluegrass Situation, No Depression, Under The Radar Magazine, Glide Magazine, and New Commute."
