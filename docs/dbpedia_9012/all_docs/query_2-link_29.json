        "text": "American singer-songwriter (born 1954)\n\nMusical artist\n\nLaurie Beebe Lewis (born Laurie Seaman on November 5, 1954, in Ludington, Michigan, United States) is an American singer-songwriter. At age 14 she was the female lead singer of the Saginaw, Michigan cult-underground band Pitche Blende,[1] a featured band on The Michigan Mixture Volume 1 album.[2] She is most associated with her affiliation as the keyboard player and vocalist with Chicago's reformed group The Buckinghams from 1982 to 1985; and as lead singer in the reformed group The Mamas & The Papas from 1986 to 1993 with original members John Phillips and Denny Doherty, along with Spanky McFarlane.[3][4]\n\nLewis was the only female artist on the 1985 Happy Together Tour with The Buckinghams, the Turtles, Gary Lewis & the Playboys, and the Grass Roots.[5] That same year the Buckinghams recorded their 1985 come-back album entitled A Matter Of Time[6] to which Lewis contributed lead and back-up vocals as well as co-writing the song \"Made To Love You\". Meanwhile, in 1997 she recorded with singer Gary Puckett on his album Is This Love. The album was released in Canada and Europe with tracks later released on compilation albums Timepiece and This is Love, both of which feature a power duet of Puckett and Lewis covering the Heart (band) ballad \"Alone\".[7]\n\nIn 2013 Lewis was part of the all-star musical project Dick Wagner & the Rockers for St. Jude in which she shared lead vocals with Wagner, Mark Farner (Grand Funk Railroad), Jean Beauvoir, Merrilee Rush, and Trini Lopez, in a band that included drummer Danny Seraphine (Chicago), guitarists Jennifer Batten (Michael Jackson) and Elliot Easton (The Cars), as well as bassist Lee Sklar and a huge backing choir of well known musicians. The group recorded a digital single and a music video, \"If I Had The Time (I Could Change The World)\" with proceeds earmarked to benefit St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.[8] Lewis was also featured on the 2nd Annual 2016 Dick Wagner Memorial Concert 'Remember The Child\"[9] at The Fillmore Detroit. The show honored DJ Russ Gibb, a former concert promoter and media personality from Dearborn, Michigan, and commemorated the late guitarist and singer-songwriter Dick Wagner. Wagner's music was performed by many artists including Wagner's son Robert Wagner, Jean Beauvoir, Grammy Award-winning pianist and singer from The Waterboys Paul Brown, drummer Sandy Gennaro, guitarist Micki Free, Derek St. Holmes, Joe Bass, Hal Patino, Maryann Cotton, Jimmie \"Bones\" Trombly, guitarist Kenny Olson, Peter Keys, David Winans II, Muruga Booker, Dennis Dunaway, The Frost, Johnny \"Bee\" Badanjek and other supporting musicians. Proceeds benefited Children's Miracle Network Hospitals supporting music therapy.\n\nOn March 24, 2017, Lewis performed with Suzi Quatro as one of The Pleasure Seekers, along with the latter's sister Patti Quatro, on the third annual \"Remember the Child Concert\" held in Detroit, Michigan at the MotorCity Casino Hotel in The Sound Board performance venue. She also contributed backing vocals for Mark Farner, Kip Winger and many returning artists from the previous year.[10]\n\nPartial discography\n\n[edit]\n\nThis is a partial discography on which Laurie Beebe Lewis contributes vocals or instrumentation:\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nSolo\n\n1997 - Laurie K.
