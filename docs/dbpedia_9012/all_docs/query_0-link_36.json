        "text": "IT IS WITH GREAT SADNESS WE INFORM YOU THAT Greta “Rita” SCHIAVONE PASSED AWAY Thursday DECEMBER 31st 2020.\n\nGreta (Rita) Schiavone was the backbone of the singing trio known as “The Laurie Sisters”. She played the part of manager, arraigner and publicist. Greta was born May 3rd 1930 and was the youngest of the Schiavone kids but the most outspoken.\n\nOriginally from Atlas, Pennsylvania, The Laurie Sisters would go on to record for almost every major record label, score a top 30 hit and tour the US and the world. All three sisters Phyllis, Caroline and Greta Schiavone learned music from their father Florian Schiavone, who was a bandleader and later a music teacher and principal at the Mt Carmel Highschool in Pennsylvania. His guidance would give them the discipline to harness their talents and build their career. Their father taught them to be absolute professionals and to always be well-rehearsed. That kind of discipline would earn them the title, “One Take Lauries”, because they only needed one take in the studio to record their songs. Greta often joked about how studio musicians would groan when they saw them walk into a studio. Studio musicians were paid by the hour and with many artists it could take a day’s worth of tries to get a song right which meant more money for the studio musicians. “The Stage” publication in London put it best when they describe The Laurie Sisters as “petite and doll-like, offered vocal harmony with machine-like precision.”\n\nThe Laurie Sisters eventually got their big break in 1949 when they were signed with the Ted Steel Show on WPIX Television in New York. In 1953 The Laurie Sisters signed with the Ted Lewis Review and toured the country with Lewis, spending most of their time in Reno and Las Vegas, Nevada until 1954 when they signed with Mercury Records. In 1955 they scored their first and only top 30 hit with their rendition of “Dixie Danny.” In 1957 They recorded their first album titled “Hits of The Great Girl Groups” with Sid Bass and His Orchestra. The girls loved the album because it was a return to their roots in big band and swing and remains their most popular record.\n\nIn 1959 The Laurie Sisters signed a multi-year contract with MGM Records. MGM Records shaped the sound of The Laurie Sisters into a rock ‘n roll girl group with songs like “I Surrender Dear,” “Live it Up” and “Don’t Forget (to Sign Your Name with A Kiss).” The Laurie Sisters recorded their last single in 1969, “Day is Done (In Vietnam). Greta and her sisters spent their remaining years in Easton, Pennsylvania. She was passionate about the piano and played many classical pieces. Her favorite composer was Frédéric Chopin and she loved to play his “Revolutionary Etude.” She admired many piano greats such as José Iturbi and Arthur Rubenstein. Music was her release and family was her mission. Whenever a family member was sick or in trouble Greta was always there to help. Phyllis wrote to Greta in a card once “Like Daddy said, you did everything right. It’s a good thing you were around for all of us. The best thing that ever happened.” Arrangements entrusted to Joseph J Stutz Funeral Home 42 s Market St. Mt Carmel,Pa\n\nJoseph J Stutz 3rd, supervisor. Condolences can be sent to www. Stutzfuneral home OR https://lauriesisters.wordpress.com\n\nIt is with great sadness we inform you that Phyllis “Cathy” Schiavone passed away Tuesday December 22nd 2020 around 10:30PM.\n\nPhyllis Schiavone, also known as “Cathy” Laurie, was born in Atlas, Pennsylvania on May 15th, 1927. While Phyllis was a friend to many, most will remember her as the booming voice that led the Laurie Sisters to fame in the 1950s. Phyllis began her music career early in life with her two sisters, Caroline and Greta. All three discovered their natural talent for music and love for performing from their father, Florian Schiavone, who was a bandleader and music teacher. It did not take long for the Laurie Sisters to gain attention for their flawless harmony. Phyllis and her sisters started signing on local radio as kids in the mid-1930s and then got their “big break” in 1949 when they were signed with the Ted Steel Show on WPIX Television in New York and later with the Ted Lewis Review in 1953. They would go on to work with almost every major record label and recorded numerous hits including, “I surrender Dear,” “Jump Junior Jump,” “Give Me One Kiss,” “Blue and Brokenhearted,” “I Really Don’t Want to Know,” and more. In 1955 they scored their first top 30 Hit with their rendition of “Dixie Danny.” Phyllis and her sisters spent the 1950’s and 1960’s on tour showcasing their music throughout the United States and world. They became know in the music industry as the “One Take Lauries” because they were so polished and well-rehearsed that they only needed one take to record their songs. A London newspaper put it best when they describe them as “petite and doll-like, offered vocal harmony with machine-like precision.” The Laurie Sister’s most popular album, “Hits of the Great Girl Groups” with Sid Bass and his Orchestra was released in 1957. The Laurie Sisters officially retired from Show Business in 1980 to care for their parents, Florian and Irene Schiavone in Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania. The Laurie Sisters recorded 3 albums and 24 singles in a career that spanned over 5 decades. Phyllis and her sisters spent their remaining years in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania surrounded by family and loved ones. Phyllis Schiavone passed away from Covid-19 on December 23rd, 2020 at the age of 93. A lyric that best describes the faith, love, and memory of Phyllis is embodied in their Christmas song, entitled “Two Thousand Years,” … “Let’s give thanks when we hear our children’s laughter and take the time to kiss away their fears, for they all will be blessed forever by the love we’ve known for two thousand years.”\n\nPhyllis Schiavone passed away from COVID-19 at the Mt Carmel Nursing Rehab Center, Mt Carmel, PA.\n\nThe Laurie Sisters Biography\n\nGreta (Rita) Schiavone was the backbone of the singing trio known as “The Laurie Sisters”. She played the part of manager, arraigner and publicist. Greta was born May 3rd 1930 and was the youngest of the Schiavone kids but the most outspoken. Caroline (Carole) Schiavone, born March 18th 1928, was the sex symbol of the group, Greta mentioned that on many occasions people would compare Caroline to Marilyn Monroe because she had a look of natural beauty that just came easily. Phyllis (Cathy) Schiavone, born May 15th 1926, was the booming voice that lead the Laurie Sisters into fame.\n\nOriginally from Atlas, Pennsylvania, The Laurie Sisters would go on to record for almost every major record label, score a top 30 hit and tour the US and the world. All three sisters Phyllis, Caroline and Greta Schiavone learned music from their father Florian Schiavone, who was a bandleader and later a music teacher and principal at the Mt Carmel Highschool in Pennsylvania.\n\nHis guidance would give them the discipline to harness their talents and build their career. Their father taught them to be absolute professionals and to always be well-rehearsed. That kind of discipline would earn them the title, “One Take Lauries”, because they only needed one take in the studio to record their songs. Greta often joked about how studio musicians would groan when they saw them walk into a studio. Studio musicians were paid by the hour and with many artists it could take a day’s worth of tries to get a song right which meant more money for the studio musicians. “The Stage” publication in London put it best when they describe The Laurie Sisters as “petite and doll-like, offered vocal harmony with machine-like precision.”\n\nThe Laurie sisters started singing on local radio as kids in the mid-1930s on radio station WKOK in Sunbury, Pennsylvania. They also performed at many talent shows and local events through the 1940’s. Their act at that time consisted of celebrity impressions and popular songs which Cathy and Greta would take turns playing the piano and performing comedy. Their father Florian Schiavone knew his girls had talent and began making records with Phyllis, sometimes with Just Florian playing the piano and sometimes with his full band. He also taught the girls how to play musical instruments. Greta and Phyllis both played piano while Caroline played the violin.\n\nThe girls had tremendous encouragement from friends, family and teachers. A nun who encouraged Greta’s talent sent one of their records and pictures to the Dorsey brothers who she knew. Since Greta was the youngest the trio would have to wait for Greta to graduate (1948) before starting their career. That didn’t stop them from recording demo records (at many radio stations including WISL, Shamokin, Pennsylvania (1948-1949) and WIP in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Late 1930’s to early 1940’s)) and sending out press kits to every major talent agency. They even traveled to Philadelphia on one occasion to meet The Andrews Sisters and perform for them. The Andrews Sisters loved them and gave them advice and encouragement and remained close friends throughout their entire career.\n\nThe Laurie Sisters eventually got their big break in 1949 when they were signed with the Ted Steel Show on WPIX Television in New York. After one year with Ted Steel, they signed with the Dumont Television network and performed on many of their programs like “East side, West Side”. In 1951 they recorded their first single for Derby records titled “Should You Forsake Me” with vocalist Bob Anthony which became their first ever commercial release later they would release another record for Derby titled “Angela”. The Laurie Sisters continued to perform on television New York. In 1953 The Laurie Sisters signed with the Ted Lewis Review and toured the country with Lewis, spending most of their time in Reno and Las Vegas, Nevada until 1954 when they signed with Mercury Records. In 1955 they scored their first and only top 30 hit with their rendition of “Dixie Danny.”\n\nIn 1956 they moved from Mercury Records to RCA’s Vik label. The girls wished to continue singing pop music but changed with the times recording rock ‘n roll songs like “Jump Junior Jump” and “Give Me One Kiss.” In 1956 RCA Records set about introducing Elvis Pressley to the Chile audience. They issued “Hound Dog” as what they called a safety record. Meaning, they put Elvis Pressley’s “Hound Dog” on the A side but if Elvis didn’t sell well they could at least make their money back with the B side and in this case it was The Laurie Sisters recording of “Your Hearts In Danger”. The only other artists to have that distinction is Perry Como.\n\nIn 1957 They recorded their first album titled “Hits of The Great Girl Groups” with Sid Bass and His Orchestra. Greta recalled that they invited their father, Florian to attend the recording sessions. On one of those sessions the arraigner was having difficulty working out one of the instrument parts. Florian asked if he could help and with some reluctance on behalf of the arraigner, he made a simple change which saved the arrangement. Greta wrote all of the vocal arrangements for the group and the musical arrangements were written around them. Greta recalled working with Sid Bass to write the arrangement of “Apple Blossom Time” around the song “Snow Fall” by Claude Thornhill. The girls loved the album because it was a return to their roots in big band and swing and remains their most popular record and would later be re-released in 1959 as a part of RCA’s “Living Stereo” series and again in 2000 in Japan.\n\nThey recorded one more album for RCA roughly titled “The Novelty Album” but it remains unreleased. During that recording session Greta remarked that people in other recording studios at RCA records would knock on the door to see if they could sit in and listen to them record because they loved the music and it was much more fun then what they were recording. The girls were able to pick songs for the album. Phyllis for instance was a real fan of Fats Waller so she picked “Hold Tight”. When Greta learned that the album would not be issued, she called producer Chick Crumpacker who was kind enough to make her a copy of the album so they would be able to listen to it and it still survives today.\n\nThe Laurie sisters continued to tour and make television appearances. They became friends with some of the biggest entertainers of the time like Perry Como, The Ames Brothers , Don Rickles, Connie Boswell, The Andrews Sisters, The DeCastro Sisters, The Fontain Sisters and The McGuire Sisters. They used to trade demo tapes with the McGuire Sisters. They found most other artists to be very encouraging. One such artist was Della Reese. On one show in Chicago The Laurie Sisters lost their luggage with their sheet music. They didn’t get it back in time for the show and Greta recalled that backstage while they were understandably upset Della Reese convinced them to perform their whole act acapella. She said, “Go out there and get your money!” The girls did and performed to standing ovations.\n\nThe Laurie Sisters became good friends with Perry Como and upon their first meeting with him he remarked that they were “So young”. It had taken Perry Como many years to build his career and he was amazed at how quickly The Laurie Sisters were able to build their careers. The Laurie Sisters opened for Perry Como on several occasions including shows he did in New York’s Catskill Mountain resorts.\n\nThey became good friends with Rodney Dangerfield. He once asked them “How do you get happy in this life?”. He had overheard them joking and laughing. Greta recalled being “surprised” to hear him ask that. She often thought about him and if he finally found happiness.\n\n1959 was a busy year for The Laurie Sisters, they would record a full-length country album with country music legend Shorty Long and in 1959 would record a single for Seeco Records titled “Blue and Brokenhearted.” Also, in 1959 The Laurie Sisters signed a multi-year contract with MGM Records, recording their next single titled “I Really Don’t Want to Know.” MGM Records shaped the sound of The Laurie Sisters into a rock ‘n roll girl group with songs like “I Surrender Dear,” “Live it Up” and “Don’t Forget (to Sign Your Name with A Kiss),” which was written by Perry Como’s Brother in law. This sound would follow the girls through the rest of their career.\n\nMGM Records gave them the opportunity to travel and in 1960 they embarked on a four month tour of the UK and Europe. The Laurie Sisters were excited to be able to bring along their parents Florian and Irene. Greta recalled that when presented with the opportunity, Florian at first declined saying that he as a principal would not be able to take that much time off and neglect his responsibility. While discussing this with other faculty members, they said “If you don’t go, give us the tickets and we’ll go”. Florian took their advice and accompanied his daughters on their tour. The Laurie Sisters appeared in London on stage and on radio and Television and played to many packed houses. They also played shows all over Germany. They’re tour ended early before their next stop in Italy however, when their mother Irene fell Ill and needed to fly back to the US for an operation. They would return to Europe in 1962 as a part of a USO show.\n\nIn 1963 The Laurie Sisters recorded their first Christmas single titled “Two Thousand Years” for Murbo Records and “Stand A Little Closer” for Port Records which would go on to be covered by Francis Gull in 1964 scoring her first big hit in France. In the Mid 1960’s The Laurie Sisters signed a paid endorsement deal with Dumont Furs, which manufactured high end fur coats. They traveled the country making appearances at stores and trade shows on behalf of Dumont Furs. The Laurie Sisters would continue to tour the US through the 1960’s, while also touring Europe and Japan and would not record again until 1968 when they were signed to De-Lite records. Their recording titled “The Soldier Boy” gained the attention and praise of New York Times music critic, Robert Shelton, for the B side titled “My Cup of Life.” They toured the record and made many TV and radio appearances even appearing on the Joey Reynolds show in New York in November of 1968. The Laurie Sisters recorded their last single in 1969, “Day is Done (In Vietnam).\n\nThe Laurie Sisters enjoyed their career because it allowed them to do what they did best and that was to sing and entertain. Greta recalled that it wasn’t always easy in the music business and they were always weary of people who would try to take advantage of them. They became street smart and under their innocent appearance was a sharp understanding of the music industry. Once in a restaurant, a man highly connected in organized crime was looking to kidnap Caroline. Greta informed the waiter who help them escape the restaurant without detection. It’s not surprising that the girls also owned a revolver.\n\nThe Laurie sisters recorded several songs in April 1969 but never released any of the recordings. Those songs include “Stop The Rain”, “I’ve Been There”, “Lets Call It A Day”, “Anywhere” and “The Uptown”.\n\nThe Laurie Sisters officially retired from Show Business in 1980 to care for their parents and brother, Jimmy. Their father Florian suffered a debilitating stroke in the early 1980’s. The girls made it their mission to care for their father and worked diligently with him for years eventually helping him to regain his speech and play the piano.\n\nGreta remarried in 1991 spending the next 20 years with engineer and draftsman, Robert Kichline until his passing in 2011. The 1990’s was a time of goodbyes for the girls starting with their mother Irene in 1989 and then with their brother Jimmy on May 14th 1993. Florian Schiavone passed away in 1995. Caroline later worked as a secretary for the Cari Dress Company and spent most of her free time painting which was her passion. She painted numerus portraits and scenes to be enjoyed by friends and family. Caroline Schiavone passed away from lung cancer at the age of 65 on March 15th 1994."
