        "text": "Rapidly rising on the bluegrass scene, Billboard-charting artists Liam Purcell & Cane Mill Road perform internationally and stateside winning both industry awards and the hearts of fans who turn out to see them at some of the industry’s most iconic venues.\n\nGrowing up just down the road from Doc Watson, Liam Purcell leads Cane Mill Road as they rock the traditional bluegrass standards they were raised on, yet boldly write original music with roots in the fertile grounds of bluegrass, old-time, and Americana. Their powerful arrangements and high energy sets are balanced out by a down-home stage presence, making lasting connections with the folks they meet out on the road.\n\nNamed Momentum Band of the Year by IBMA in 2019, Liam Purcell & Cane Mill Road have been recognized as one of the fastest growing bands in the industry. Their latest release “Roots” debuted at #6 on the Billboard Bluegrass Album Charts, joining their three previous albums for a total of 12 weeks in the Top 10. In 2022, bandleader Liam Purcell turned heads by sweeping the Rockygrass Instrumental Championships on Guitar, Mandolin, and Banjo, becoming the first person in history to do so.\n\nLiam is joined by band members: Jacob Smith on bass, Ella Jordan on fiddle, Colton Kerchner on banjo, and Rob McCormac on guitar.\n\nBorn in Wheeling, West Virginia in 1954, Grammy winning singer songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Tim O’Brien grew up singing in church and in school. After seeing Doc Watson on TV, he became a lifelong devotee of old time and bluegrass music. Tim started touring nationally in 1978 with Colorado bluegrass band Hot Rize. His songs “Walk the Way the Wind Blows” and “Untold Stories” were bluegrass hits for Hot Rize, and country hits for Kathy Mattea. Soon more artists like Nickel Creek, Garth Brooks, and The Dixie Chicks covered his songs. Over the years, Tim has collaborated with his sister Mollie O’Brien, songwriter Darrell Scott, and noted old-time musician Dirk Powell, as well as with Steve Earle, Mark Knopfler, Dan Auerbach and Sturgill Simpson.\n\nLiving in Nashville since 1996, O’Brien’s skills on guitar, mandolin, fiddle, and banjo make him an in-demand session player. The International Bluegrass Music Association awarded him song of the year in 2006 and named him best male vocalist in 1993 and 2006. He was inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame in 2013 and into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame in 2022.\n\nNotable O’Brien recordings include the bluegrass Dylan covers of “Red on Blonde”, the Celtic-Appalachian fusion of “The Crossing”, and the Grammy winning folk of “Fiddler’s Green”. His duet recording “Real Time” with Darrell Scott is a cult favorite, and he won a bluegrass Grammy as part of “The Earls of Leicester”. 2021’s “He Walked On” wove historical and socially conscious themes into songs about ordinary and not so ordinary people just trying to “keep it between the ditches”.\n\nO’Brien’s newest, “Cup of Sugar”, drops June 16. A feel-good summertime release with humor on top and deeper meaning just below the surface, it includes 13 new originals about a bear, a fish, lambs, horses, and some people too – a grave digger, a neighbor, and even Walter Cronkite. Backed by his loyal bandmates Mike Bub (bass), Shad Cobb (fiddle), his wife Jan Fabricius (mandolin and vocals) and Cory Walker (banjo) and other ace sidemen, “Cup of Sugar” features a special guest spot from old friend Del McCoury. “Cup of Sugar” co-writers include Ronnie Bowman, Jonathon Byrd, Shawn Camp, Jan Fabricius, and Thomm Jutz.\n\nTony Trischka will be honoring the music of Earl Scruggs, pioneer of the three-finger banjo style and one of the two most important musicians in bluegrass.\n\nTrischka recently came into possession of extremely rare recordings of jam sessions with Scruggs and John Hartford, and he’s transcribed and recorded Scruggs’s note-for-note solos from many of these. Many songs that Earl had never recorded.\n\nAn album of this music is in production with a new label formed by some of the founders of Rounder Records and includes a number of bluegrass luminaries.\n\nTogether with his ace band—Michael Daves on vocals and guitar, bassist Jared Engel, fiddler Brittany Haas, and mandolinist Maddie Witler— they will trace the story of Scruggs from his childhood to his final years. They debuted at Joe’s Pub in New York City which drew lots of interest including an appearance on the Opry, a rarity for a banjo player these days.\n\n“Earl is my North Star, a lifetime pathway. And I’m not alone,” says Trischka, a banjo innovator and educator who has influenced everyone from Béla Fleck to Steve Martin. “Through his music, this shy kid from Flint Hill, North Carolina went on to enrich countless thousands of lives. At the age of 13, when I first heard 16 notes of Scruggs style banjo playing, I put down my folk guitar and mercilessly pestered my parents to buy me a banjo. Once in my hands, that 5-string became my obsession and has been for close to 60 years.”\n\nHe adds, “The depth of his genius becomes ever more apparent when I transcribe his solos, which I’ve been doing my entire musical life and with renewed vigor. Discovering new twists and turns in his playing is pure joy and in fact the inspiration for this tribute show and the album.”\n\nBluegrass from the Forest\n\nJoin us for the 9th Annual Midwinter Celebration\n\nFriday, December 29th, 2023 6:00 PM 9:00 PM at Shelton High School Performing Arts Center 3737 North Shelton Springs Road Shelton, WA, 98584 United States (Click here to see Google map)\n\nOur 2023 band lineup features 3 bands: our host band Runaway Train Bluegrass Band, along with the Union City Council, and The Ranks Strangers. Tickets are $20 and available online or at the door. Kids 15 and under get in free! Refreshments are provided by donation.\n\nThis event is hosted by the Kristmas Town Kiwanis.\n\nFeatured Bands\n\nRunaway Train, based in the South Puget Sound area, came to be in the year 2000 and has evolved throughout the years. They’ve performed through the Northwest for festivals, concerts and private events including all of the major area bluegrass festivals. They have a traditional sound but are not afraid to push the limits. They are host band for Shelton’s Bluegrass from the Forest.\n\nGreg Linder – guitar, Kent Powell – bass, John White – mandolin, Doug Wenzen – banjo and special guest River Scheuerell on fiddle.\n\nThe Rank Strangers\n\nThe band is named after the song “Rank Stranger,” which was recorded by Ralph Stanley in the southern gospel tradition. The oldtime meaning of rank stranger meant someone who was a complete stranger. In this tradition, our Rank Strangers band members are made up from a group of eighteen people from the Puget Sound area to form a five piece band. The members play in other popular regional bands and a different mix of five plays every Wednesday at the Pig Bar in Olympia. We’re honored to have these five pickers at our Midwinter event. Barb Collins – fiddle, John Pyles – bass, Tye Menser – banjo, Leif Halverson – guitar, Larry Gilliam – mandolin\n\nUnion City Council Bluegrass Band\n\nUnion City Council Bluegrass Band\n\nBased in Union,Wa area of Hood Canal, this band was recently created out of their love of traditional bluegrass and is sure to delight all!\n\nGuy Demartino – guitar\n\nGwendolyn Taylor – fiddle\n\nDonald Strand – Dobro (resonator guitar)\n\nMartin Strand – bass\n\nGreg Linder – guitar\n\nMr. Sun comprises some of the most original musicians to apply themselves to the American String Band.\n\nLegendary fiddler Darol Anger is at home in a number of musical genres, some of which he helped to invent, and is a member of the original “nuclear” generation of pickers who extended Bluegrass, Jazz, and Classical music to find their common ground; Mr Sun is the latest iteration in that legacy. Joe K. Walsh is one of the foremost contemporary mandolinists, with 4 award-winning years in the Gibson Brothers, 3 solo recordings, and a Berklee professorship. Grant Gordy is a standout in the crowded field of Acoustic Guitar Wunderkinds. Grant’s work was quickly recognized for its kaleidoscopic excellence and startling emotion, fusing Jazz, R&B, and Bluegrass concepts to an unprecedented degree. The group recently added the masterful bassist Aidan O’Donnell, a Brooklyn, New York (by way of Scotland) jazz veteran.\n\nThe 4 musical personalities of Mr Sun are so strong that one might imagine the group could explode if not for the palpable love and humor that emanate from every note they play together. The group means to take a relaxed approach to writing its own chapter in the American Music Saga with their new Compass Records release “extrovert,” on CD & bright yellow vinyl.\n\nFor nearly four decades, Laurie Lewis has gathered fans and honors for her powerful and emotive voice and her versatile, dynamic songwriting. She is a sought-after recording producer and an equally skilled teacher and mentor. And she is an inspiration and a ground-breaker – across genres, across geography and across gender barriers.\n\nLaurie has shown us how a woman can blend into any part of the classic bluegrass singing trio, and she showed us how a great voice could move fluidly between bluegrass and other types of music. She showed us how a female fiddler could emulate the strength and grit of the early bluegrass musicians. She has shown how a Californian can appeal to traditional bluegrass audiences, as well as winning acclaim in the worlds of Americana and folk music. She has shown us how to lead bands of talented musicians – learning from them while helping them make their best music. And she has shown us how to thrive in a constantly changing musical environment – without ever sacrificing her art.\n\nNina was born and raised on the outskirts of Sebastopol, a semi-rural town in Northern California, where she grew up surrounded by fields, fruit trees and horses under wide blue skies. I have known her as a friend and collaborator for over four decades now, and I know, like me, that she is deeply rooted in the landscape, the colors, the aromas, and the sounds of her homeland. Her artistry has carried her all over the world, but she always comes home, to a place that, however hard it might be to scratch out an artist’s living, won’t quite let her go. For that, we Westerners are most grateful.\n\nA little back-story: as a teenager, in 1975, Nina saw Kate Wolf perform at a pizza parlor in her hometown and fell under the spell of Kate’s songs and emotive singing, and decided that she wanted to play guitar in Kate’s band. And by god, three years later, after pledging her soul to the box of wood and wire, she had achieved that goal. She played with Kate until Kate’s untimely death in 1986.\n\nNina claims never to listen to lyrics, yet always plays the right fill or backup line in just the right place. Maybe she listens beyond the lyric, to the intention, and responds to that. Or maybe she actually DOES hear the lyric but is too much of a tough guy to admit to it. However she does it, Nina makes magic happen as few can. Sure, she has the technical chops and knows the fingerboard, but it’s what one does with those tools that sets the artist apart from the technician. And Nina is an artist—one who has made a profession of giving wings to songwriters’ scribbles. And I’m not talking paper airplanes.\n\nNina is sought-after as a teacher, an arranger, and producer. She is known to be exacting and demanding—but no more demanding of others than she is of herself. I have no idea the number of credits Nina has on recordings, both as a backup musician and as a producer, but it wouldn’t surprise me if it were in the thousands. Her care with tone, tuning, and timing, combined with her ability to grasp the big picture in a piece of music have kept her busy. She has played with a real who’s who of folk music royalty but you never hear her flaunting her credits. She will give the same care to a first-time nervous music camp participant presenting their new-born baby song to the world that she gives when backing up luminaries such as Greg Brown, Karla Bonoff, Kate Wolf, Dave Alvin, Lucy Kaplansky, Rosalie Sorrels, Mollie O’Brien, Nanci Griffith, or any of the rest of us. With Nina, it’s all about the depth, and she’s never out of hers.\n\n– Laurie Lewis\n\nThe grand master of the mandolin returns with an exciting new quartet – John Reischman and Old Acoustic –With Trent Freeman (fiddle), Bryan McDowell (guitar) and Max Schwartz (bass) to celebrate the music of his latest solo album ‘New Time and Old Acoustic,’ nominated for both a Juno Award and Canadian Folk Music Award. From his days in the early ’80s with the original Tony Rice Unit, John has dazzled audiences across the globe with dozens of mesmerizing original compositions played with great power, taste and gorgeous tone on his rare and mighty 1924 “Lloyd Loar” Gibson mandolin. In addition to touring more than 20 years with his ongoing bluegrass band The Jaybirds, John has collected a Grammy award and three Juno nominations for his outstanding recording output, including seven Jaybird albums, four solo instrumental albums, and many other projects and sessions with John Miller, Todd Phillips and other top players.\n\nBluegrass Unlimited calls John Reischman “one of the world’s undisputed masters” of the mandolin, famed for outstanding tone and taste. Many of his dozens of original instrumentals have become popular favourites for sessions and covers, such as the jam standard Saltspring. He has three critically-acclaimed solo instrumental albums and has recorded on many other projects, including the Grammy-winning True Life Blues: The Songs of Bill Monroe. John also plays Latin-based jazz and choro music with highly regarded finger-style acoustic guitarist/composer John Miller; the duo has released three superb albums.\n\nJohn began his career in the San Francisco Bay area in the early ’80s with the eclectic Good Ol’ Persons bluegrass band. He was an original member of the legendary “new acoustic” quartet, the jazz-influenced Tony Rice Unit, renowned for highly skilled instrumentals. John moved to Vancouver in the early ’90s and in 1999 formed the Jaybirds. Of their latest album, Folk Radio UK said “On That Other Green Shore showcases an accomplished, experienced band at the peak of their powers, with musicianship of the very highest order.” Peghead Nation called it “one of the most beguiling bluegrass-rooted recordings of 2017.”\n\nIn January 2020, Mark Schatz and Bryan McDowell started working up a duo show for festivals, small venues, and a Canadian fall tour. The time they spent together touring with the Claire Lynch Band had fostered a personal and musical rapport, which has made for a fruitful collaboration. Their show offers stylistically diverse material, ranging from traditional fiddle tunes and ballads, a Bob Dylan song, and a Louis Jordan boogie-woogie number to an Eastern European folk song on bowed bass and bluesy renderings on fretless banjo. Recorded in Mark’s basement recording studio, most of the songs in this collection were recorded “live,” with very little overdubbing added. With such spontaneous performances, listeners will feel as if they’re in the room with the musicians.\n\nMark is a prominent figure in the contemporary acoustic music world who has recorded and toured with Bela Fleck, Tony Rice, Tim O’Brien, Nickel Creek, John Hartford, The Claire Lynch Band, and Sarah Jarosz. Though best known for his work on acoustic bass, Mark has released two of his own solo recordings on Rounder Records which feature his original compositions and clawhammer banjo playing. He is the Musical Director for the acclaimed dance troupe Footworks Percussive Dance Ensemble, and is currently touring with Bryan McDowell and his own solo show, Mark Schatz – The Solo Concert.\n\nWestern North Carolina native Bryan McDowell grew up in a rich musical environment where he learned everything from Doc Watson to Charlie Parker. His extraordinary facility on several instruments, his sure, sweet tenor voice, and his stylistic versatility have made him a much sought after sideman, landing him tours with the likes of Molly Tuttle, Mountain Heart, Sierra Hull, and a long stint with The Claire Lynch Band. Most recently Bryan has been focused on recording sessions, teaching, and studying for his BA.\n\nTheir CD, Grit and Polish, which went to #1 on the Folks DJ Charts in 2021, presents a striking and colorful range of traditionally oriented music, both old and new, by two of the most versatile and respected players in today’s American acoustic music scene. Schatz and McDowell bring their different generations and backgrounds together in an unparalleled synergy, humor, beauty, and ease, taking the listener on a delightful, toe tapping journey through a landscape of fiddle and banjo tunes, songs, lilting waltzes, and searing guitar solos. Stir in some clogging, hambone, and jaw harp, then sit back and enjoy an eclectic musical feast!\n\nMile Twelve is back in motion. From the first manic, dissonant downbeat of their virtuosic new record, Close Enough to Hear, you’ll discover a band that is ready to explode from a restless pandemic-induced hiatus. The first track “Romulus,” glides and rages as the narrator wrestles with the ultimate impermanence of the empire he’s forged.\n\nNext comes the magical realism of “Johnny Oklahoma,” the youth who volunteers to be fired out of a cannon for the good of his community, in one big beautiful nihilistic burst. These musicians are clearly working through some hard questions posed by the last few years. You’ll hear the same warmth and innovation that earned the band IBMA’s 2019 Album of the Year nomination and 2020 New Artist of the Year Award, and that’s gained them an international reputation as one of the most dynamic groups in contemporary acoustic music. The title track “Close Enough to Hear,” is a stripped-down dream of all that we missed so dearly in those early, terrifying months of lockdown.\n\nSomething else is close enough to hear on this new album. You’ll notice the presence of two new members: fiddler and vocalist Ella Jordan and mandolinist Korey Brodsky. Take note of the new dimension they add to the band, and their ability to lock in with founding members Evan Murphy (guitar, vocals), Catherine Bowness (banjo), and Nate Sabat (bass, vocals). These aren’t session players; this album captures the formation of a new coherent unit.\n\n“Recording this album, our third full length, wasn’t easy,” says Murphy. “The pandemic froze the music industry for two years. We had undergone personnel changes. People who followed us couldn’t be blamed for wondering what, if anything, we might be up to. This was attempting a high jump from a total stand still, no running start.”\n\nBoth of the bands’ previous full-length albums, as well as their guest star-packed EP, were recorded in Nashville. But the new challenges of traveling and dodging positive covid tests kept the band closer to home. They chose Sam Kassirer’s legendary Great North Sounds in the woods of Parsonsfield, Maine, a studio that’s played host to a murderer’s row of Americana acts and has become a fixture of the New England recording scene.\n\n“I’m more proud of this album than anything else I’ve done to date,” says bassist Nate Sabat. “Listening back, I feel an undeniable urgency in the music. A fresh sound rushing out, wanting to be heard. The songwriting, arrangements, execution and aesthetic are all bullseye, and I couldn’t be more excited to share this music with our fans.”\n\nThis is a band looking forward — simultaneously shoring up their bluegrass foundations (in the transfixing a capella opening of “If Only,” for example) while also pushing their musical boundaries and driving into new territory. You’ll detect flavors of jazz (“Red Grapes on the Vine”), acoustic pop (“Take Me As I Am”) and trance music (“Light of Angels”). Heard as a whole, Close Enough to Hear displays the vast potential of acoustic string band music in the hands of capable players.\n\n“Mile Twelve made fast gains for the first few years, like shiny young bluegrass bands do,” reflected Murphy. “We picked fast, sang high, and toured hard. Then it all crashed against the brick wall of Covid.”\n\nThis album lets you listen in close to a band that decided to continue after all of that heartache — a band that’s grown up a bit too. The vocals might be softer, the viewpoint a little weathered, but there’s no chasing of metronomes here, no tuning of vocals. Mile Twelve decided to stand back up and keep going, quietly delivering what very well may be its best album yet."
