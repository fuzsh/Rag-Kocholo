        "text": "For fiddler, guitarist, singer, and songwriter Laurie Lewis, the traditions of bluegrass and folk aren’t so much tools in her hands, but burning sources of inspiration that have driven her through a 30+ year career at the forefront of American roots music. A pioneering woman in bluegrass, Laurie has paved the way for many young women today, always guided by her own love of traditional music and the styles of her heroes that came before. Although she’s won a Grammy for her interpretation of Bill Monroe’s music, and is considered a masterful proponent of Ralph Stanley’s singing style, she has crafted the music her own way, by following her personal muse and remaining open to new influences.\n\nIn some ways, Laurie Lewis’ new album, One Evening in May, recorded one magical evening in May 2013 at the Freight and Salvage in Lewis’ hometown of Berkeley, CA, feels like a victory lap. She’s playing before a loving audience and it sounds like an utterly effortless evening of music. But the illusion of effortlessness covers up the fact that Laurie Lewis is making some of the most challenging and innovative music of her career right now.\n\nWatch a concert video:\n\nArtist’s website: http://www.laurielewis.com/\n\nRelated\n\nWe all give our spare time to run folking.com.
