        "text": "IT’S ALWAYS a party when Berkeley’s own Laurie Lewis plays a hometown show at the Freight and Salvage Coffee House. When she hits the stage tonight, however, it will be a party with a purpose.\n\nLaurie Lewis and the Right Hands are celebrating the release of their brand-new CD, “The Golden West,” at this show. The East Bay native’s album is being put out by, appropriately enough, Oakland’s own HighTone label.\n\nFans will surely get a heaping dose of songs from “The Golden West,” but they’ll also get many of the classic tunes that have made this talented veteran such a house favorite at the Freight and Salvage over the years.\n\nBut it’s not just the fine folks at the Freight and Salvage who like Lewis. The vocalist-fiddler has garnered her share of national recognition during her career, including a Grammy and two International Bluegrass Music Association Awards for Female Vocalist of the Year.\n\nShowtime is 8 p.m. Tickets are $18.50. The Freight and Salvage is at 1111 Addison St., Berkeley. Call (510) 548-1761 or visit http://www.thefreight.org.\n\n— Jim Harrington\n\nPhotos ‘all over map’\n\nWorks of the Bay Area Photographers Collective, a nonprofit organization that serves as a community for emerging photography artists, vary from platinum to digital pieces.\n\nThat is why the collective’s show, debuting Friday, is called “All Over the Map,” a title that reflects the diversity of each of the 21 artists participating in the gallery event and the subjects they’ve chosen to photograph.\n\n“This is a group show showing the breadth and variety of our work and our different perspectives and different talents,” the collective’s Adrienne Defendi said.\n\nIncluded in the show is work from Alameda resident Rebecca Chang; Oakland residents Art Levit, Bill McClaren, Charlotte Niel and Beth Kientzle; San Ramon resident Eric Larson; Concord resident Kime Smith; and Berkeley residents Kirk Thompson and Anita White.\n\nDefendi called the 30 or so photographers within the collective “artists with day jobs,” shooters who work for the love of the craft.\n\n“All Over the Map” runs Sept. 1 to 29 at the Calumet Photo Galley, 2001 Bryant St., San Francisco. A reception will be held from 2 to 4 p.m. Sept. 16.\n\nTo learn more about the Bay Area Photographers Collective, visit http://www.bapc.info.\n\n— Laura Casey\n\nCalifornia flashback\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered what California looked like before modern amenities such as freeways, subdivisions and IKEA, the work of Manuel Valencia may satisfy your interest.\n\nValencia was born on a family hacienda in Rancho San Jose in 1856 and began painting as a youth. His career led him to work as a staff artist for the San Francisco Chronicle and various magazines, although he is best remembered for his landscape paintings of early California.\n\nMore than 50 of Valencia’s paintings, selected from public and private collections, will be on display at the Hearst Art Gallery at Saint Mary’s College of California in Moraga.\n\nValencia’s work will be shown from Sept. 9 through Oct. 15 at the gallery, 1928 Saint Mary’s Road. A lecture and reception will be held from 2 to 4:30 p.m. Sept. 10.\n\nFor more information, visit http://gallery.stmarys-ca.edu.\n\n— Laura Casey\n\nMorgan season opens\n\nAs it heads into its 2006-07 season, Berkeley’s Julia Morgan Center for the Arts is saying goodbye to executive director Sabrina Klein, who is leaving her post of six years to expand her consulting business, Creative Education Consulting.\n\n“As I transition from the Julia Morgan,” Klein says, “my expectation is that the community will continue to support and enjoy the wonderful year-round line-up of shows and activities. There is always so much going on here and always will be.”\n\nThe season begins with classes. Luna Kids Dance for dancers ages 3 to 12 starts Sept. 18. Glitter and Razz, the Thursday theater class, begins soon, and Berkeley Ballet Theater’s adult classes begin Sept. 5.\n\nThe performance season opens Sept. 23 with Mahea Uchiyama Center for the International Dance presenting an evening dance.\n\nCrosspulse Rhythm Duo’s “Finding the Rhythm Around Us” is Sept 24, and the Active Arts Theatre for Young Audiences runs “Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day” runs Sept. 30 through Oct. 15.\n\nSplash Circus returns for the Thanksgiving holiday, and Berkeley Ballet Theatre’s “Nutcracker” runs Dec. 8 through 17.\n\nCircus Finelli, from the Clown Conservatory of the SF Circus Center, performs Christmas week, and Will Durst’s annual “Big Fat Year-End Kiss Off Comedy Show” returns New Year’s Eve.\n\nWord for Word presents “Strangers We Know,” two short stories by Mavis Gallant and Lorrie Moore adapted for the stage, Jan. 31 through Feb. 4, and Active Arts revs up February with Dr. Seuss’ “Go Dog, Go.”\n\nOther performance groups slated for ’07 include Berkeley Opera, the Dance Is festival, Clown Conservatory, Berkeley Ballet Theatre and Traveling Jewish Theatre.\n\nCall (510) 845-8542 or visit http://www.juliamorgan.org for a complete schedule.\n\n— Chad Jones\n\nSausalito art fest\n\nMore than 1,000 artists will transform the waterfront of Sausalito’s Marinship Park into a picturesque enclave for this year’s 54th Annual Sausalito Art Festival. Represented will be a melange of media, including painting, woodwork and 3-D mixed media.\n\nIn the arduous task of judging, a 14-member jury surveyed more than 6,000 slides in two days to determine whose work would be showcased. Some 34 artists from the United States were chosen, while an impressive 21 participants came from abroad.\n\nAmong the artists this year are jewelry maker Kent Raible, Argentenian glass artist Ruben Fassani and renowned Berkeley painter Colette, whose striking works include portrayals of coyotes. The artists are competing for more than $16,000 in prizes.\n\nDubbed the “No. 1 festival in the nation” by the ArtFair SourceBook in 2004 and 2005, the event lives up to its reputation with a varied program of events, including music.\n\nThings start off Saturday with a posh gala. Performers gracing the live entertainment stages include Dick Dale at 2:45 p.m. Saturday; the Lovemakers at 4:45 p.m. Saturday; and Jackie Greene at 12:15 p.m. Monday.\n\nHours are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday at Marinship Park in Sausalito. Tickets are $5 to $20. Children younger than 6 are free. Call (415) 331-3757 or visit http://www.sausalitoartfestival.org.\n\n— Dino-Ray Ramos"
