        "text": "In the introduction to her newest CD, Laurie Lewis observes that “This is the first recording that I have made without my partner Tom Rozum since we started playing music together in 1986.” She explains that Tom has Parkinson’s, though he is still able to sing and he provided the cover art. On these dozen songs, Laurie is joined in a variety of combinations by Brandon Godman on fiddle and vocals, Patrick Sauber on banjo and vocals, Hasee Ciaccio on bass and vocals, Andrew Marlin on mandolin, George Guthrie on banjo, cello banjo, and vocals, Sam Reider on accordion, Nina Gerber on guitar, and Tom Rozum on vocals.\n\nThe first number, written by Laurie and inspired by John Muir, is “Just a Little Ways Down the Road.” There is even a hint of the lyrics of “Cotton-Eyed Joe” in the chorus, “Where did I come from? Where will I go?” The theme is walking. “Enough” is another Laurie original about the ravages to our California environment by the climate disaster. Laurie began writing “Texas Wind” decades ago during a downpour in that state and finished it for this album. She wrote “Why’d You Have to Break My Heart?” for the late John Prine who said that to her after her performance at the Strawberry Music Festival long ago. Mark Simos and Kit Lia Ashera wrote “Quaking Aspen.” It features twin fiddles by Laurie and Brandon. The title cut, “Trees,” is a beautiful a capella quartet inspired by and expressing the point of view of trees along fields in southern Indiana. “Long Gone,” by Bill Morrissey, evokes the departure from life before the pandemic and then finally the return to it. Iris and Tom T. Hall wrote “Hound Dog Blues,” which Laurie had previously recorded for the Daughters of Bluegrass collection. Brandon wrote the melody and Laurie wrote the lyrics for “The Banks Are Covered in Blue.” The late John Hartford wrote “Down on the Levee.” “The Day Is Mine” was written by Kate MacLeod. The final cut is another Laurie original “Rock the Pain Away” and features Nina on typically amazing lead guitar.\n\nAs one would expect from Laurie, each song is carefully arranged and polished. The singing and playing are powerful. Laurie dedicated this recording to the late Chris Strachwitz."
