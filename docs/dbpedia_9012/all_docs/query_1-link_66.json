        "text": "Sheila Graziano (dance)\n\nSheila Graziano discovered her passion for dance at an early age. Rooted in ten years of tap lessons as a child, her enthusiasm grew with the discovery of Appalachian clogging and other forms of traditional dance. Smitten with the art, Sheila Graziano devotes much of her time to continually developing her skills and knowledge of traditional dance, including American, English, Irish, Scottish, and Canadian dance steps. Ms. Graziano was a founder and member of The Crosstown Cloggers and Crow's Feet, and is the artistic director of The CommonWealth Dance Collective. She teaches ongoing workshops for adults, private lessons, various dance workshops at festivals and events, and has been the dance instructor and choreographer for The Saline Fiddlers for 29 years. She is also steeped in The Marley Project; a video archive of a series of dances from the Vaudeville era, with tutorials, for future use by interested dancers, historians, etc.\n\nSheila is very committed to passing on the 'common wealth' of knowledge of the dances and dance styles that she has learned over the years, and welcomes the opportunity to work with Earful of Fiddle campers this summer!\n\nEnrique Rosario (dance)\n\nEnrique Rosario (he/him) is an internationally-recognized professional tap dancer, choreographer, performer, and instructor based in North Carolina. He is a mentee of Sarah Reich, a 2018 YoungArts winner in choreography, and an alumni of the 2019 Tap Program of Jacob’s Pillow. He has been working professionally since he was fifteen years old and has performed nationally with some of the highest esteemed tap dancers and companies working today including Sarah Reich, Dorrance Dance, and Reverb Tap Company. He has taught internationally at tap festivals and intensives including RIFF Dallas, OC Tap Festival, and Sarah Reich’s Tap Music Project. He is currently the tap director at InMotion Dance Center in Winston-Salem, NC. He has been choreographing since he was fifteen and has had his work presented and awarded since he was sixteen years old. Also a director and producer, Enrique has been producing his own works since 2021, and is currently garnering praise for his dance short film series “A Love Story” featuring dancers and choreographers representing different love stories.\n\nSophie Wellington (dance)\n\nSophie (they/she) is a Boston-based musician who draws inspiration from old-time fiddling, percussive dance, and jazz improvisation. Raised in Staunton, VA by concert pianist Lynne Mackey and old-time musician and dance caller Bill Wellington, her childhood was steeped in shared music and movement. Contra dances, choirs, music festivals and camps shaped her curiosity and inspired her to pursue music professionally. In 2021, after graduating from Berklee College of Music, she recorded and released her debut solo record Roving Jewel. This collection of fiddle tunes, dancing duets, and vocal jazz standards marks a new phase of her musical career. Improvisation is at the heart of her relationship with sound and space. By using this spontaneous element to interpret rhythm, harmony, and melody, she engages the listener – and the music itself – in a conversation.\n\nAllison de Groot (banjo)\n\nOn clawhammer banjo, Allison de Groot has become a significant voice in the North American traditional, Americana and roots music scenes. Her style is adventurous and grounded, and No Depression writes it “transports the listener to a different plane”. Starting out on banjo in her hometown of Winnipeg, MB, Allison’s grown into a career of exciting collaborations and continued musical exploration. She has performed and recorded alongside some of the most renowned traditional musicians in North American and Europe and was nominated by the Americana Music Association for 2023 ‘Instrumentalist of the Year’.\n\nCollaboration is at the centre of Allison's music. Her duo with fiddler Tatiana Hargreaves has been described by Bandcamp Daily as “one living, breathing organism”. Allison and Tatiana create a sound that is adventurous, masterful, and original. They expand on the eccentricities of old songs, while never losing sight of what makes them endure. Their latest release ‘Hurricane Clarice’ won two Canadian Folk Music Awards and was nominated for ‘Traditional Album of the Year’ at the Juno Awards.\n\nAlongside bandmates Tatiana Hargreaves, percussive dancer Nic Gareiss and legendary fiddler Bruce Molsky, Allison has performed at festivals such as Newport Folk Festival, Pickathon, Red Wing Roots, Winnipeg Folk Festival and Hardly Strictly. For a second year in a row, Allison and Tatiana are working in the Celtic Connections Transatlantic Sessions house band led by Jerry Douglas.\n\nTatiana Hargreaves (fiddle)\n\nOver the past decade, Tatiana Hargreaves has been on the forefront of an up and coming generation of old time, bluegrass and new acoustic musicians. From placing first at the Clifftop Appalachian Fiddle Contest, to her bluegrass fiddling on Laurie Lewis’ GRAMMY-nominated album The Hazel And Alice Sessions, Hargreaves shows a musical fluency that flows between old time and bluegrass worlds with ease. She has toured with musicians such as Dave Rawlings, Gillian Welch, Laurie Lewis and Jake Blount. Her current duo with banjo extraordinaire Allison de Groot has been described as a “can’t-miss pair in,” by Paste Magazine and has garnered the attention of Rolling Stone Country, the IBMA awards and the Canadian Folk Music Awards. Hargreaves has been the lecturer of bluegrass fiddle at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill since 2018.\n\nJake Blount (fiddle, banjo)\n\nJake Blount (he/they) is an award-winning old-time banjoist, fiddler, singer and scholar based in Washington, DC. Blount specializes in the music of Black and Native American communities in the southeastern United States, and in the regional style of Ithaca, New York. His teachers include Rhiannon Giddens, Bruce Molsky and Judy Hyman. He has claimed first place in both the Banjo and the Traditional Band categories at the prestigious Appalachian String Band Music Festival in Clifftop, WV. He has shared his music and research at the Smithsonian Institution, Yale University, and Berklee School of Music, as well as numerous other venues and institutions. Blount tours domestically and internationally as a solo performer, with his duo Tui, and with his band The Moose Whisperers. In the spring of 2020, Jake released “Spider Tales”, his critically acclaimed solo album and has since been featured in the Guardian, Rolling Stone, and on Al Jazeera.\n\nGrace van’t Hof (ukelele)\n\nMichigan native Grace van’t Hof (they/them) has developed and taken a unique shade of ukulele playing across the United States and overseas with such groups as Bill and the Belles, Aaron Jonah Lewis’ Ragtime Banjo Revival, and Chris Jones & the Night Drivers. Driven by inspiration from American popular music of the early 20th century, Grace thoughtfully incorporates their uke stylings into genres from bluegrass to 80’s pop rock. Most recently, Grace brought their custom steel stringed baritone ukulele to the hallowed stage of the Grand Ole Opry where their solo was featured on the Night Drivers IBMA nominated song, “Riding the Chief.” A devoted fan of early 20th century music, Grace strives to return the ukulele to its rightful place in swing, country, and popular music. In addition to being an accomplished ukulele performer and session musician, Grace also plays the 5-string banjo professionally, is a published illustrator, and is the three-time reigning International Bluegrass Music Association’s Graphic Designer of the Year. Grace makes their home in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nRollie Tussing (guitar)\n\nAward-winning finger-style guitarist Rollie Tussing (he/him), whose classes at past editions of Earful of Fiddle have been a favorite of guitar students, returns this year. Rollie draws inspiration from the old weird America, from rural Midwestern guitar styles to recorded popular tunes from the 1800s to the 1950s. He performs timeless classic and country blues, dewey-eyed tunes of the 20s, as well as forsaken songs of the nineteenth century. His own compositions are influenced by those same lonesome, haunted and abandoned melodies that we all forgot to remember. Having Rollie at camp also means we'll get to experience a 78 RPM record listening session, as vintage recordings Rollie has collected from the early 20th century come to life, each spinning a tale of musical eccentricity and cultural diversity. With a passion for the obscure and the extraordinary, Rollie conjures the mystique of bygone eras, where forgotten melodies, wild animal calls, and enigmatic instruments intertwine in compositions that defy convention.\n\nReed Stutz (mandolin, guitar)\n\nReed Stutz brings a powerful rhythmic sensibility and evocative, soulful energy to string band music. Adept as a multi-instrumentalist and singer (mandolin, guitar, banjo), he is fueled by a love for old time and early bluegrass, and his inclination to dig into their roots has fed a distinctive sound with colorful blending of tradition and personality. Close study of Bill Monroe’s mandolin style serves as one anchor to Reed's sound, from which he has delicately constructed a hard-driving, fiery edge woven with tender expressiveness.\n\nCollaborations have taken Reed to stages and festivals across the country, as a member Molsky’s Mountain Drifters (Bruce Molsky, Allison de Groot) and with musicians including Alice Gerrard, Tatiana Hargreaves, Bella White, Joe Troop, Joseph Decosimo and Laura Orshaw. His playing and singing can be heard on Bella White’s acclaimed Rounder Records album “Just Like Leaving,” Joe Troop’s “Borrowed Time,” Laura Orshaw’s “Solitary Diamond,” and a forthcoming album from Alice Gerrard.\n\nEmily Doebler (dance collaborator)\n\nEmily Doebler (she/her) works closely with musicians of all kinds to create movement that emphasizes the shared connection between dance and music. She was first introduced to traditional percussive dance forms at five years old through an arts program run by dancer Jeannine Sladick. Growing up, Emily participated as both a student and performer at many different festivals and camps that nurtured her interest in percussive dance and traditional dance and music. Additionally, Emily has been awarded three Michigan Traditional Arts Apprenticeships with Nic Gareiss. Those apprenticeship opportunities provided Emily the opportunity to focus on improvisation, the complexities and interconnectedness of music and percussive dance, and the history of traditional dance and music. Emily embraces the opportunity to be curious about the collaboration of movement and sound, and emphasizes the importance of reconsidering the conventional confines of movement and expression. Emily also holds a Master of Public Policy from Michigan State University."
