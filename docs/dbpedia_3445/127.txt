Huh huuuh (x4)

[verse1]

There's been a lot of toasting,

A lot of guys have been up to her,

But she told them she was waiting

For the one that God had sent to fulfil her kind of craving,

A special kind of loving,

One with love and understanding,

Come raining come shining;

People started to say that she wanted more than Mr. RIGHT,

All that she wanted was the man that sees the LIGHT,

They say she's a fool for being up too TIGHT,

When all that she wanted was good love, no be FIGHT;

That special kind of girl hard to come by,

This kind of girl na im I want to make wife,

You're the one,

I say no more,

Don't bother about what the people say

cos I say ...

[chorus]

Every time that I look into your eyes, I see FIRE in there (Theres Fire)

And if you look into my eyes, you see DESIRE in there (DESIRE...);

Girl, if LOVE is a CRIME, then I'm willing to be WANTED;

Girl, if LOVE is a CRIME, I'm willing to be HAUNTED;

I've gotta lot of respect for you cos your kind is SO RARE (SO RARE...),

It's kind of hard to imagine but I know YOU'RE OUT THERE (YOU'RE OUT THERE...);

Girl, if LOVE is a CRIME, then I'm willing to be WANTED;

Girl, if LOVE is a CRIME, I'm willing to be HAUNTED;

[verse2]

She said to me: "Do you wanna be the last man standing",

She said to me: "Do you wanna be the one that 'll be complimenting me";

Huuuh yeah! Girl, I wanna be your beginning and your ending,

Oooooh! I wanna be the only one that you'll be sending;

I can't believe she's still a virgin,

A lot of guys have been up to her,

But there's was no compromising;

She'd be strong,

she'd keeping herself until the day of her wedding,

Under the right ceiling,

With the right person,

That person deserving all that special kind of loving;

[chorus]

[bridge]

So keep the FIRE burning,

Keep the FIRE burning, burning, burning;

FIRE burning,

Keep the FIRE burning, burning, burning;

Keep the FIRE burning,

Keep it,

Keep the FIRE burning, burning, burning;

Girl, if LOVE is a CRIME, then I like to dey go JAIL,

Girl, if LOVE is a CRIME, I prefer to dey stay JAIL;

Girl, if LOVE is a CRIME,

Girl, if LOVE is a CRIME,

See,

Every time that I look into your eyes, I see FIRE in there,

And if you look into my eyes, you see DESIRE in there;

Keep the FIRE burning,

Keep the FIRE burning, burning, burning;

FIRE burning....
