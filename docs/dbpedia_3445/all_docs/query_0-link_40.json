        "text": "NEW BEDFORD - The former boarding house at 535 County St. on the corner of Mill Street had a bad reputation.\n\nIt \"was well known for attracting blight and crime,\" according to architect Eric Army, who was appearing before the city Zoning Board of Appeals in behalf of the building's new owner.\n\nDespite that description, the ZBA unanimously approved a special permit at its last meeting that will allow the building's continued use as a boarding house.\n\nThat is, under the building's new owner - the next-door neighboring Grace Harbor Church.\n\nZBA Chair Laura Parrish said, \"I think it's a good use of the building. It was in a sore state of affairs before they purchased it. It was pretty rough. They seem to be respectful individuals and have a positive plan to turn the building around and use it for good.\"\n\nPastor Morgan Proudfoot said the Baptist church's motivation in buying the three-story building was two-fold.\n\nFirst, \"It needed to be purchased because it was a hazard to the neighborhood. We often had issues with the residents, even during Sunday services. We had members of our church who were fearful, neighbors who were fearful. We always had to get involved.\"\n\nAnd, second, \"We are in desperate need of office space and educational space.\"\n\nSo, while the church has approval to operate a boarding house, that use will be restricted to the four-bedroom, two-bathroom third floor.\n\nThe ZBA's special permit will also allow the church to offer educational and social services on the first floor and have office space on the second.\n\nBoarding house space not meant to make money\n\nThe \"boarding house\" component on the third floor isn't meant to generate income, Proudfoot said.\n\nPrimarily it will be used by short-term mission teams that come in from around the country to serve city youth and the city through sports camps, kids clubs, and neigborhood cleanups, Proudfoot said.\n\nThey generally come in for about five days, he said.\n\nThe church also wants to use the third-floor space for short-term crisis care of less than 30 days duration.\n\nSingle moms or others in need from the neighborhood, identified by church staff, would be provided the temporary living space.\n\nThe building, which was built in 1882, was closed and vacant when the church bought it from a Boston investor in March 2022 for $382,000, according to Assessor records.\n\nAnd it will need work.\n\nBut the small congregation, with help from other affiliated congregations, renovated the abutting church site at 519 County St. after buying that building in 2019.\n\nIt had been a church, but the building was closed, condemned and a candidate for demolition.\n\nGrace Harbor Church was able to renovate and reopen in 2020 - during the pandemic.\n\n\"We spent the whole year renovating that, cleaning up that corner and now we're just trying to move onto the next. Our goal is to restore the whole neighborhood right there as best as we can for the city,\" Proudfoot said.\n\nPolice calls logged at the address prior to purchase\n\nAccording to a police report, a cocaine trafficking arrest was made at a unit in the building and almost 300 grams of cocaine seized in 2021 before the church purchased it.\n\nPolice were also called to 535 County St. on 26 disturbance calls from 2019 to 2022, according to police logs provided by the New Bedford Police Dept., as well 10 complaint calls, two threats calls, two suspicious activity calls, one burglary call, one larceny call, one crime in progress call, one assault call, one stolen motor vehicle call, one assault call, one tresspass call, and one animal control call.\n\nPolice also served two warrants, and executed one search warrant during that time period.\n\nProudfoot said, \"One of the ways we could love our neighbors well is by cleaning up that property and using it not as a means that does harm to the neighborhood with selling drugs, prostitution and violence but using it as an opportunity and a space to rebuild dignity and value into people's lives.\"\n\nLove our neighbors and love them well\n\nHe added, \"We're a Bible-believing church. We also feel like the scriptures compel us and command us to love our neighbors and to love them well.\n\n\"So we're often seen out in the neighborhood serving in different ways, whether it's kid camps or service projects or cleaning up the city. We do a lot of stuff like that.\"\n\nNow - when they finish fixing 535 County St. up - the church will have office space for its nine staffers and room to expand its life-enrichment programs, including employment and healthy living training, and English-as-second-language classes."
