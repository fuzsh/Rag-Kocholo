Her abductor appears to want only to watch her die. Will hunger, thirst, or the rats get her first? Apart from a shaky eyewitness report of the abduction, Police Commandant Camille Verhoeven has nothing to go on: no suspect, no leads, and no family or friends anxious to find a missing loved one. The diminutive and brilliant detective knows from bitter experience the urgency of finding the missing woman as quickly as possible--but first he must understand more about her. As he uncovers the details of the young woman's singular history, Camille is forced to acknowledge that the person he seeks is no ordinary victim. She is beautiful, yes, but also extremely tough and resourceful. Before long, saving Alex's life will be the least of Commandant Verhoeven's considerable challenges.

His job as a court reporter and theater critic for \"L'Écho de Paris\" and later as international correspondent for \"Le Matin\" gave him fodder for some of his literature. He was present at the 1905 Russian Revolution. The award-winning musical based on Leroux's work is world-famous, but many people are unaware that the show was inspired by a novel, originally published in a serialized form by French journalist and detective writer Gaston Leroux. The Phantom of the Opera is a timeless piece of gothic horror that invites the reader into the dark world of obsession beneath the Palais Garnier opera house and reveals the secrets of the masked man who lives there. An introduction by Bram Stoker and in-depth annotations will bring this epic love story to life for today's readers.\n\nThis Poison Will Remain by Fred Vargas; Sian Reynolds (Translator)\n\nCall Number: PQ2682.A725 Q3613 2019\n\nISBN: 9780143133667\n\nFred Vargas is the pseudonym of Frédérique Audoin-Rouzeau.

A murder in Paris brings Commissaire Adamsberg out of the Icelandic mists of his previous investigation and unexpectedly into the region of Nîmes, where three old men have died of spider bites. The recluse has a sneaky attack, but is that enough to explain the deaths of these men, all killed by the same venom? At the National Museum of Natural History, Adamsberg meets a pensioner who tells him that two of the three octogenarians have known each other since childhood, when they lived in a local orphanage called The Mercy. There, they had belonged to a small group of violent young boys known as the \"band of recluses\". Adamsberg faces two obstacles: the third man killed by the same venom was not part of the \"band of recluses\", and the amount of spider venom necessary to kill doesn't add up. Yet after the Nîmes deaths, more members of the old band succumb to recluse bites, leading the commissaire to uncover the tragedy hidden behind the walls of the orphanage. [Quand sort la recluse]"
