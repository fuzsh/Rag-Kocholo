        "text": "Will knows.\n\nHe has to know.\n\nI’ve ordered the fires extinguished in his brain. As I picked up the phone to tell Dr. Sutcliffe I’d changed my mind, I knew I was setting events into motion that could end with my death or lifelong imprisonment. I also understood that taking such a risk was imperative, as it may be the key to the greatest happiness I’ve ever known. The one certainty I clung to as I foiled my own plans was that Will would know me. See me. What he would decide to do with that knowledge is impossible to predict.\n\nBut now, sitting in Jack’s office, I can’t be sure he’s received my messages. Understood the scope of my declaration.\n\nI supervised his care during his recovery from encephalitis, driving him to his appointments when it wasn’t safe for him to be behind the wheel, picking up prescriptions and groceries. Cooked him proper meals, meant to nourish and calm the inflammation as well as delight the senses. I fed his dogs, paid to have his lawn serviced and the house cleaned and the hounds groomed.\n\nIt was in his nature, of course, to refuse help. Will’s father raised him to reject charitable offerings out of pride. Pride, also, insists he must be self-sufficient; alone and lonely so long, he wears fierce independence like armor. But I am nothing if not patient and persistent, and he submitted long before I thought he would.\n\nHis desire to be taken care of crumbled that pride like a faulty dam springing leaks before its catastrophic collapse. I’d like to think I had something to do with it. Not only care, but care from me .\n\nOnce Will recovered from his immune system's misguided attack, we resumed our therapy and our friendship. Both flourished, a well-tended garden, roots deep in the soil and blossoms unfurling in the sun. We discussed killing the way others might discuss art, poetry, music. He invited me to fish with him and cook the catch after. I invited him to dinner. It’s become our routine to linger in my office for hours after his session is supposed to have ended, drinking wine by the fire. He let me sketch him once, his face in profile, illuminated by the flames.\n\nOne night, three months ago, he put his hand over mine on the arm of my chair. Gave it a tender squeeze.\n\nAnd that is when I decided to reveal myself to him, come what may, though the gesture of affection has not been repeated since.\n\nJack is speaking now, pacing in front of the board decorated with photographs of my most recent sounder. “Four victims in three months. No connection. Organs taken, elevated to ‘art’ -- or whatever this monster sees as art -- and no evidence left behind.” He turns to us where we sit in front of his desk. I’m bathed in Will’s scent and try not to breathe it in any obvious way. He’s stopped wearing that atrocious aftershave and taken my advice regarding a replacement. The notes match perfectly with his natural essence.\n\n“You’ve got to give me something,” Jack growls.\n\nWill gets up and studies the pictures again, arms folded over his chest. I let my covetous gaze find the curves of his hips and backside and look as long as I want, since both of my companions are engaged with the murder montage tacked to the board. “The first victim was wearing a solid gold snake bracelet from, ah…” Will puts on his glasses and leans closer to the picture, reading the caption. He doesn't need those glasses for correction, and uses them to avoid eye contact, but I've noticed how he pretends to need them to see once in awhile to keep up the pretense. “400 AD. The second was a fashion designer, you said?”\n\n“Assistant to Kimiko Auditore. Apparently her work is very hot right now, not that I’d know – but Jimmy recognized the name, said all the stars are wearing her clothes. Carolynn Watts, the victim, was stealing from the new line and wearing the clothes before they made it down the runway.”\n\n“Hmm.” Will turns and I’m treated to his profile. “And Todd Bridges, th-the, ah, bitcoin speculator. Who owned the sports car he was found in?”\n\n“His stepfather. He’d apparently borrowed it to impress a potential client.”\n\nWill nods. He has to know. It sends a thrill through my body to see how shrouded he is, giving nothing away to either of us.\n\n“What the hell do you make of this?” Jack gestures to my fourth victim, who is positioned on a bench in a blue-walled train station bathroom, draped in a dark blue cloak, face painted in varying colors of the hue. “The Ripper’s fucking… Blue Period ?”\n\n“That’s exactly what it is,” Will murmurs.\n\nBrian Zeller bursts in, breathless. Jack is inhaling the air to bellow at him but Zeller’s words halt the roar. “Two more bodies were just found at the Blackwater Wildlife Refuge.”\n\nJack curses and grabs his hat. Will and I follow as he storms out of the building.\n\nZeller calls, “Shotgun!” like a twelve-year-old boy, but I hardly mind. Will and I climb into the backseat of Jack’s SUV. We don’t look at one another, don’t speak, but I can feel the heat radiating off of him, warming my thigh and my arm from across the small gap of seat. I spend the hours imagining the feel of his hand on mine. Just as we cross the state line into Delaware, I catch him looking at me in my periphery. Or was he glancing out my window to see the state’s welcome sign flash by? Certainly his gaze lingers too long for that. I adjust my necktie.\n\nThe marshy preserve has a series of wooden walkways over the water for wildlife viewing. At a corner where two paths meet – a crossroads – is the crime scene, swarming with technicians, state troopers, and park rangers. Jack clears the area for us, and he and I stand back while Will examines the design. There are three figures posed, lashed to the railing. Two of them are Frankenstein’s monsters, stitched together pieces, patchwork fiends. The corpse standing between them is dressed in a black hooded cloak, an hourglass in one hand and a scythe clutched in the other.\n\n“Tell me about the victims,” Will requests softly, his eyes closed, the pulse of his empathy vibrating the molecules of air around him. I swear I can smell it working, a smoky incense coming through his pores.\n\n“From what we can tell,” Jack says, flipping through pages of a hastily-generated report on his phone, “the two bodies on the right are Gene and Victor Abernathy of Abernathy Pharmaceuticals.”\n\n“I seem to remember their company in the headlines last year,” I supply.\n\n“Right,” Jack confirms. “They were accused of faking some of their data from their clinical trials. From what I understand, Gene took the brunt of it. Expelled from the company, disowned by the family. He was apparently living on the street before… this.”\n\nThe two brothers are reunited now, the head of one stitched onto the torso of the other, one arm and one leg of each. Victor’s arm still sports his Rolex and diamond ring on his smallest finger. Gene’s is full of needle marks from intravenous drug use.\n\n“And…” Will’s eyes are open now, and he nods to the other creation.\n\n“That’s Cam Michaels, former Ravens wide receiver. He was the one–”\n\n“The dog fighting,” Will says, his brow darkening.\n\n“Right. And his former agent, Antonio Gifford.”\n\n“The one who lied for him.” Will’s voice is razored ice.\n\nJack scoffs, shaking his head. “Figures you’d be aware of the scandal. Probably the only sports trivia you know.” He scrolls down his phone, scanning the reports.\n\nWill examines the stitched-together football player and his agent, their contrasting skin quilted expertly. “The agent – he was sick with something, wasn’t he?”\n\n“He was,” Jack confirms, pulling up another file on his phone. “Being treated for bowel cancer.”\n\n“No organs gone from him,” Will murmurs, bending closer to look at the head, which wears both men’s faces in a puzzle of flesh and black thread. “Meat’s no good.”\n\n“You think it’s the Ripper, then?” Jack asks grimly. He glances at me and I nod.\n\n“Oh, ah… most definitely the Chesapeake Ripper,” Will confirms. He isn’t looking at me, but I can feel his thoughts as if they were physical. “I understand it now,” he says, and Jack turns him by the shoulders to look into his face.\n\n“Understand what?” he demands.\n\n“The sounder,” Will murmurs, with a dreamlike softness. “It’s a… proposal.”\n\n“A what?” Jack barks, tucking his phone in his pocket in an agitated gesture.\n\n“The Roman bracelet.” Will turns to me at last, snaring me with his Aegean sea eyes, luminously captivating. “Something old. Th-the clothes were, ah… brand new. The car was borrowed–”\n\n“And the train station, the Blue Period…” Jack shakes his head, then glances at the sky. “Something blue,” he mutters. “Jesus Christ. Well, where the fuck does all of this fit in?”\n\nWill indicates the brothers. “Richer and poorer.” Then, he nods to the football player and his manager. “In sickness… and in health.”\n\n“‘Till death do us part.” I’m hardly aware I’ve spoken aloud until Jack turns to me for a moment before returning his attention to Will’s analysis.\n\n“All right, it’s a fucked up marriage proposal,” Jack says, his voice harsh over the tranquil scene. A heron flies past. “Who’s he proposing to?”\n\n“Another killer,” Will says, looking away from me at last.\n\nWill makes me wait for an agonizing lunar month. He politely declines my dinner invitations, and leaves as soon as his therapy appointments are over. But the FBI does not break down my door. And so I squirm and twist in the bondage of hope. I know he wants me to suffer, and I do. I offhandedly mention during a session that I’ve been having trouble sleeping, that I haven’t had much of an appetite lately. He smiles.\n\nI’m lying awake in bed in the early morning hours when Jack calls me to another crime scene. Will, he says, is stuck at home in Wolf Trap with a dead car battery. He’s dispatched agents to go and pick him up. But I’m to come right away to the opera house.\n\nThere, we find my least favorite musician in the Baltimore Symphony – a rude trumpet player of dubious talent – dead on the stage, his body covered with white flowers stained red. On the back wall of the white acoustic shell, a word is written in blood, the letters ten feet high.\n\nYES\n\nWill arrives. I can tell he’s taken more care with his appearance than usual, dressed tonight in a salmon-colored shirt and gray slacks, his hair recently cut, neck freshly shaved. He and I dance a delicate dance around the body, which has been transformed into a bloodsoaked bouquet, throwing out our theories about the Ripper and his intended.\n\nI offer to drive Will home after we send Jack and the Behavioral Science Unit back to Quantico with more questions than answers. Instead, I bring him home with me. He builds the fire in the fireplace beneath the taxidermy antelope’s head and I open a bottle of champagne.\n\nHe finishes his flute quickly, lingering near the mantle as if unsure what to do with himself. It may be the firelight, but I fancy his cheeks are pink. His turn to squirm.\n\nAt last, I set aside my glass and stand, deftly removing my suit jacket and draping it on the chair. I join him at the mantle and slowly reach for his hand, giving him time to pull away. Even though the body he left has already given his answer, I won’t be sure until I touch him at last.\n\nHe reaches for me, a mirrored movement. Conjoined. As our hands touch, we edge closer, and he lets me do something I’ve wanted for so long – cup his cheek in my palm, brush his hair behind his ear. I can feel him trembling.\n\n“You… asked me to marry you, and we’ve never even…”\n\n“I’d like to remedy that.” I lean in, guiding his face toward mine. A moment of resistance, a fraction of a second, before he accepts the gesture. I can feel the hitch of his breath against my lips the moment before they touch.\n\nMy plan is to be patient, chaste, only what he’s comfortable with, but suddenly, I’m being devoured. Will clutches at my arm and hooks his fingers into the shoulder of my waistcoat as I grip the bow of his lower back, grasping at last the curves I’ve admired for so long. Bodies flush at last, a miracle despite the frustrating layers of clothing. He’s loath to let our hungry mouths part but I want to kiss his neck and I always indulge myself when the mood strikes. His skin is roughly masculine along the line of his jaw but silky as I drift lower, pausing to at last breathe him in unimpeded. The tiny wordless sound he makes rings with a kind of relief, at last.\n\nI’ve lost my ability to formulate language aesthetically; his ass feels as good as it looks. He snarls a hand in my hair and reclaims my mouth again. “What did you think of my design?” he wants to know after several heady moments. “Be gentle. It’s my first time.”\n\nThe words ring with a double meaning like an echo over our heavy breaths.\n\n“It was beautiful.”\n\nHe smiles, glowing under the praise. His response is to grab my necktie with exquisite roughness and drag me into another kiss.\n\nI can’t tell if he pushes me down onto the sofa, if I reach out and pull him into me, or if our combined inertia makes the physics happen. We fall into one another’s gravity. I draw him into my lap and he straddles my thighs, pulling my hair again as I work open his trousers with a theremin player’s deftness. I’m ready to make music with him, a duet after all this time.\n\nI free his cock and he groans into my mouth as I touch him, play his body as my instrument, composer of his moans which grow bolder with each one that tumbles from those angel’s lips. He’s hard in half a breath, relaxing into my touch, suddenly tamed and pliable. He rests his hand over mine as I pleasure him, my own erection straining, forming a damp patch already in its confines. His other grips the back of my neck, fingers digging in possessively. I thumb the slit a moment, then bring my mouth to his throat once more. Tasting, then, at last, bringing his flesh between my teeth. He snarls out a wanton moan, spilling against our clasped hands. I release his bruised flesh in increments before kissing his hard breathing mouth. He lifts his smeared fingers to my lips and slips them between. I suck them clean then press my mouth against his again, mingling his varying flavors between us.\n\nHe slides slowly to the floor, stroking my thighs.\n\n“Pants off,” he orders.\n\nI open my belt. “I thought you were about to propose to me instead.” He grins, eyes glinting, all shyness gone. “Though anything you plan to do on your knees will be a delight, I’m sure.”\n\n“All that work,” he says, helping me tug down my clothes, tossing them aside and spreading my legs wider. “And you didn’t get a ring?”\n\n“I didn’t know your size.”\n\n“Well, I’m not sure if it’ll fit…” Will unbuttons his shirt part of the way and pulls a long silver chain over his head. It holds a plain gold band with subtle etching. He opens the clasp and holds it up. My heart swells in my chest and I feel the sting of tears. “My grandfather’s. I never knew him, but, ah… after he died my granny G wore it on her thumb for the rest of her life.”\n\nHe takes my hand. My tears spill over as the band clears the first knuckle and then the second, coming to rest snugly where it belongs. “Would you look at that,” he murmurs. “Just right.”\n\nI can’t even formulate a proper reply before he gets down to his next item of business, which is to suck my cock. When I put my hand in his hair for a loving stroke, the gold of the ring glows in the firelight, a candle in the dark, a prayer."
