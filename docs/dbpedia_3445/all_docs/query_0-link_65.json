        "text": "You can verify your identity by\n\npresenting the original of your national passport, or\n\npresenting an original copy of an identification document.\n\nIf you do not have a national passport or identification document, a close relative can in some cases attest to your identity. Read more about how a close relative can attest to your identity under the heading Close relative (see below).\n\nPassport or iden­ti­fi­ca­tion docu­ment\n\nThe passport or identification document must be from a competent authority in your country of origin. You must have applied for the document and/or have collected it from the competent authority yourself. A passport can be accepted to verify your identity even if the period of validity has expired. Your photo must be on the document.\n\nIf you previously submitted your national passport to the Swedish Migration Agency, you can refer to it in your application under the heading Other information inside the e-service.\n\nIn some individual cases, the Swedish Migration Agency may consider that you have verified your identity even though your identification documents do not meet all of the requirements. If you have many documents that do not individually meet the requirements, the Swedish Migration Agency can make an assessment of whether they can verify your identity together.\n\nSpecial requi­re­ments on iden­ti­fi­ca­tion docu­ments\n\nFor some countries, there are special requirements on identification documents. Here are the rules that apply to you if you are from\n\nAfghanistan\n\nIraq\n\nSomalia\n\nEritrea\n\nStateless Palestinians\n\nClose rela­tive\n\nSometimes, one of your close relatives (a spouse, parent, adult child or sibling) can verify your identity. That close relative must themselves be a Swedish citizen and have verified his or her identity in a way that is acceptable today.\n\nYou and your close relative must have submitted matching information on identity, your relationship, background, family circumstances, etc. in earlier investigations regarding residence permits or work permits.\n\nIn order for your spouse or close relative (a parent, adult child or sibling) to verify your identity, you must have lived together before you came to Sweden. You must have lived together for long enough for your spouse or close relative to have knowledge of your background and life story so that your identity can be verified for certain.\n\nExcep­tions to the requi­re­ment of a veri­fied iden­tity\n\nThe Swedish Migration Agency can make exceptions for you if you cannot verify your identity if\n\nyou have lived in Sweden for at least eight years, and\n\nthe information on your identity is credible, and\n\nyou do not have the possibility to obtain documents that can verify your identity.\n\nYour identity is credible if you have lived in Sweden for at least eight years without interruption and have had the same identity in that time.\n\nIf you changed your identity during the time that you lived in Sweden, it is harder to make an exception to the requirement of a verified identity. Nor can you count the time that you were in Sweden with the wrong or a false identity in the period of habitual residence.\n\nTo become a Swedish citizen, you must have lived in Sweden for a certain amount of time. The time that you have lived in Sweden must be uninterrupted. How long you must have been a resident of Sweden varies.\n\nPeriod of habi­tual resi­dence – time in Sweden\n\nHabitual residence means that you are a resident of Sweden and have an intention to stay. As a rule, you must have been a resident of Sweden for five consecutive years. Why you settled here and what permit you had during that time determines whether you can count all of the time in Sweden in the period of habitual residence. The main rule is that the time with a residence permit that leads to a permanent residence permit is included in the period of habitual residence.\n\nHow is your period of habi­tual resi­dence counted?\n\nIf you had a permanent residence permit or residence permit for settlement when you entered Sweden, you can count the time from the day you came to Sweden.\n\nIf you did not have a permanent residence permit or residence permit for settlement when you entered Sweden, the time is counted from the date you submitted your application for a residence permit in Sweden.\n\nIf your application for a residence permit in Sweden was denied and then you submitted a new application, the time is counted from the date you received an approval.\n\nTravel abroad\n\nIf you travelled abroad for short visits or holiday for example, it has no impact on the period of habitual residence in Sweden. But if you were abroad for more than six weeks in total during a year, the entire time you were outside Sweden must be subtracted from the period of habitual residence.\n\nIf you move to a different country and settle there, your habitual residence is interrupted. You can begin counting your habitual residence from the day you move back to Sweden.\n\nEU/​​​​​​​​​​​​​​EEA citi­zens and their family members\n\nEU/EEA citizens and their family members must have met the requirements for the right of residence in order to have a period of habitual residence in Sweden and be able to apply for Swedish citizenship. This does not apply to Nordic citizens.\n\nRead more about citizenship for Nordic citizens\n\nIf you have been a legal resident of Sweden for five years, but have not requested a certificate of a right of permanent residence or applied for a permanent residence card, an assessment is made of whether you meet the conditions for the right of residence in connection with your application for Swedish citizenship.\n\nHow to verify your right of residence or residence card if you are an EU/EEA citizen\n\nHow to verify your right of residence or residence card if you are a family member of an EU/EEA citizen\n\nDiffe­rent kinds of resi­dence permits\n\nIf you have had a temporary residence permit in Sweden, such as a residence permit for visits, guest studies or as an au pair, that time is not included in a period of habitual residence. This may also be the case if you work at another country’s embassy or consulate in Sweden.\n\nHowever, if you are studying or have studied at the doctoral level, you can in some cases count the time with a residence permit for studies as habitual residence. You can count the time if it is apparent that you have had the intention of staying in Sweden after completing your studies.\n\nShorter time if you live together with a Swedish citizen\n\nIf you are married, live in a registered partnership or are a cohabiting partner with a Swedish citizen, you can apply for Swedish citizenship after three years. If so, you must have lived together the past two years. It is not enough to be married with each other. You must also live together.\n\nIf your partner previously had a citizenship other than Swedish or was stateless, they must have been a Swedish citizen for at least two years. In your time in Sweden, you must also have adjusted well to Swedish society. Things that we then assess can include the length of your marriage, your knowledge of the Swedish language and your ability to financially support yourself.\n\nIf you were previously in Sweden under an identity other than your true identity or if you made it harder to implement a decision on deportation by absconding, for example, it can impede your possibility of obtaining citizenship after three years.\n\nIf you are state­less or have a refugee status decla­ra­tion\n\nIf you are stateless or have a refugee status declaration, you must have been resident in Sweden for at least four years to be granted citizenship. A refugee status declaration is issued to anyone who has been granted a residence permit as a refugee pursuant to Chapter 4, Section 1 of the Aliens Act or equivalent paragraphs in the old Aliens Act. It is not enough for you to have been selected in the scope of the refugee quota.\n\nOther iden­tity\n\nIf you lived here in Sweden under an identity other than your true identity, you may not include the time you were in Sweden with a false identity in your period of habitual residence.\n\nExcep­tions for certain indi­vi­duals\n\nThere are several exceptions to the requirement of a period of five consecutive years of habitual residence in Sweden. Below are a number of examples of who may be exempt from this requirement:\n\nAn emigrated former Swedish citizen who returns to Sweden.\n\nA person who is employed on a Swedish vessel and is nationally registered in Sweden.\n\nA person who previously lived in Sweden and is posted abroad by a Swedish company to work for the company.\n\nA person who has been married to or is a cohabiting partner of a Swedish citizen abroad for at least ten years and resides in a country where they are not a citizen."
