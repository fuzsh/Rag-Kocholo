        "text": "Lūsus needs to be lūsum to agree with amōrem.\n\nI think the sense of \"for\" in the sentence is normally rendered by the dative in Latin. Scelus prō aliquō is a crime committed on behalf of someone, not a crime in the eyes of someone.\n\nOther than that, your translation is correct. I'm also only a beginner, though, so you should await another answer or a confirmation from someone more knowledgeable.\n\nI made an attempt to follow my own corrections and came up with this, which might passably fit the melody:\n\nDulcis mī care\n\nexitium illīs decet\n\nquī amōrem lūsum putant\n\nut tibi et mihi.\n\nI replaced nōn scelus est with decet to exploit a strength of Latin: a verb often carries a meaning more strongly than a noun with est, and decet goes nicely with the dative. Also, especially in a song, you can omit esse with putant."
