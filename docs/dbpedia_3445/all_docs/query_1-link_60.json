        "text": "If you think someone you know is experiencing abuse, taking the time to learn about abuse and how to support someone are two important steps in helping your loved one reach safety and freedom.\n\nIf someone confides in you that they are experiencing domestic abuse there are some simple things you can do to support them. However, if the person you are worried about has not directly disclosed the abuse to you, it can be more difficult to support them but it’s good to understand how you can be there for them.\n\nWhen supporting someone experiencing abuse, never put yourself in danger.\n\nWhat is domestic abuse?\n\nDomestic abuse is a pattern of behaviours which take place within an intimate or family relationship, making it difficult for the person experiencing abuse to have control over their own life or leave the relationship. These behaviours can be controlling, coercive, threatening, degrading or violent.\n\nYour friend or family member may be unsure if they are experiencing domestic abuse. If it is safe to do so, you could share types of abuse with them to help them come to terms with what they are experiencing. Try to keep in mind that they might not be ready to accept that their partner or relative is abusive yet.\n\nDomestic abuse can include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\nCoercive control (a pattern of intimidation, degradation, isolation and control with the use or threat of physical or sexual violence)\n\nPsychological and/or emotional abuse [1]\n\nPhysical or sexual abuse\n\nFinancial or economic abuse\n\nHarassment and stalking\n\nOnline or digital abuse\n\nIt’s important to understand that abuse is always underpinned by a pattern of power and control. Coercive control is a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten their victim, creating a context of fear and control that makes it very hard for women to end the relationship. Coercive and controlling behaviour has been a criminal offence since 2015.\n\n[1] Office for National Statistics (ONS). (2018) Domestic abuse: findings from the Crime Survey for England and Wales: year ending March 2017. Published online: ONS\n\nHow you can support someone experiencing domestic abuse\n\nIt takes a lot of strength to talk about experiencing abuse, especially when many women are disbelieved or dismissed when they share their experience.\n\nWhen someone reaches out to you, acknowledge that, although she is in a frightening and difficult situation, she is taking an important and brave step forward in reaching out to you.\n\nFor friends and family, it can be really challenging supporting someone who is experiencing domestic abuse but the most important thing you can do for them is to provide emotional support. Listen to them and believe them. Let them express their feelings to you and give them time and space to come to terms with the abuse.\n\nTry to keep in mind that domestic abuse is about one person trying to control another – the perpetrator will likely have taken away a lot of the control from them, so try not to do the same. Instead of taking the situation out of their hands or making decisions for them, let them know that there is support available for them if and when they choose to reach out. They may decide that it is not the right time to get support or leave. This is okay, it’s important not to force this or judge them for making this decision. Let her set her own boundaries of what she feels is and isn’t safe, and always remember that she is the expert in her own experiences. However, if you have reason to believe that someone is in immediate danger, then you can call the police, or encourage them to call the police if they are able to do so.\n\nWhen she is sharing her experiences, really listen to her, try to understand and don’t blame her. Let her know that she is not alone, and direct her to support services, like the Women’s Aid Live Chat. The support workers can help her come to terms with the abuse and talk her through her options.\n\nWhen she contacts us, we promise we will never judge, we will always have a fully trained female support worker available, we will give space to explore her options and support her to make choices for her and her children and keep everything confidential. Women’s Aid is here for her.\n\nShe may have suffered physical abuse as well as emotional abuse. If she shares this information with you, you could offer to go to the GP or hospital with her. If she feels comfortable doing so, you can help her report assault(/s) to the police.\n\nThe abuser may have told her that she deserves the abuse. Let her know that this is not true, no one deserves to be threatened or hurt. There is no justification for the abuser’s behavior, the abuser is the only one responsible for their actions.\n\nUse supportive language\n\nIt can be hard to hear your loved one talk about what she is going through but it’s important that your feelings don’t become judgmental words.\n\nJudgmental language around domestic abuse can perpetuate dangerous stereotypes. It can make it more difficult for women to understand the abuse they are experiencing, come to terms with it, and reach out for professional support.\n\nInstead of ‘If I were you, I’d leave’, try showing that you understand the many barriers she is facing, from financial to emotional, saying, ‘I understand there are barriers to you leaving’. Leaving is a huge decision, which could lead to further abuse, and it’s important she makes her own decisions when she feels ready.\n\nIt’s also important to be an empowering voice and not blame her for the abuse. Instead of ‘What did you do to provoke him?’, try ‘You don’t deserve this, no matter what’ or instead of ‘That sounds unlike him’, try ‘Your feelings are valid and I believe you.’\n\nWhen you’re supporting someone, your words are powerful. It’s vital that survivors get the right response when they reach out to you.\n\nRemember to look after yourself while you are supporting someone through a difficult and emotional time. Don’t put yourself in any dangerous situations, you shouldn’t offer to talk to the abuser about your friend or put yourself in any situations where you could be seen by the abuser as a threat to their relationship. If the abuser knows that your friend or family member is reaching out for help, or if you confront them about the abuse, this may escalate the abuse."
