        "text": "A violent crime can have a lasting impact and can bring changes that one might not expect. The Office of the Attorney General led the way for legislation that created the Crime Victims Compensation Act. This law reserved resources to help those who lives were interrupted by a violent crime. This financial assistance could include offsetting costs related to:\n\nAccessibility and Usability of Property\n\nCrime-Scene Clean Up\n\nFuneral/Burial Expenses\n\nLoss of Earnings\n\nMedical, Hospital and Dental Expenses\n\nMental Health Counseling Expenses\n\nRelocation Costs\n\nReplacement Costs\n\nTuition Expenses\n\nThe Illinois Crime Victims Compensation Program offers reimbursement up to $45,000 ($27,000 for crimes before 8/7/22) for expenses incurred by eligible victims as a result of a violent crime.\n\nIf you or someone you love has been impacted by a violent crime, please call our toll-free Crime Victims Assistance Line at 800-228-3368 for more information. You can also apply for compensation below.\n\nCrime Victim Compensation Application\n\nThe Attorney Generalâ€™s Office encourages all victims of violent crime to complete the Crime Victim Compensation Program application. While the program is limited to certain eligibility requirements, there is a broad range of circumstances that can be considered.\n\nWatch a video for an overview of the process or details on completing the online form:\n\nThe preferred method to file a crime victim compensation is by an online submission. For those who may require a form to print, complete by hand, and return by mail, the office has downloadable files available."
