        "text": "Noah’s memoir is in large part an ode to his mother, Patricia, whose fearlessness and sense of purpose he largely credits with his eventual success. Since they grow up together, just the two of them, Noah long considers himself and his mother a “team.” Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah—whose middle name is Xhosa for “she who gives back”—at once shows Noah that many rules are based on nonsense and that he must be careful about breaking them. And when he does break them—which he does all the time—she punishes him harshly, something he initially disdains but later comes to understand. In fact, throughout the book he realizes how little he understood about love in his childhood, even though his mother’s love was the absolute key to his ability to escape poverty and violence. Retroactively, Noah realizes his mother’s wisdom and sees how love can foster growth by teaching lessons through pain and, far more importantly, by creating an environment of genuine accountability and commitment.\n\nAlthough Noah is inseparable from his mother for much of his childhood, they also have a love-hate relationship because Noah is as disobedient as his mother is strict. At first, her love seems to be a barrier to their getting along, and Noah does not understand why she is so hard on him, even if he admits he is something of a nightmare child. She does not let him listen to nonreligious music and makes sure he constantly reads the Bible; she assures him that, if he ever lands himself in jail, he will have to deal with it on his own because she wants him to learn his lesson. She also punishes him physically; he receives frequent “ass-whooping[s]” and is chased down whenever he tries to evade them. In contrast, he finds his Catholic school’s corporal punishment so weak that he laughs his way through a spanking from his principal. However, this could not contrast more with the way Abel, Noah’s stepfather, combines love with violence. When Abel beats him up in a closet, Noah realizes that Abel’s violence comes from rage, whereas his mother’s comes from love.\n\nFour of Noah’s chapters focus on his love affairs of various sorts, showing both how little he understood about love at the time and how love taught him some of his greatest lessons in life. The first of these chapters is about his love for his dog Fufi, whom he finds out is visiting another boy’s home during the day. This teaches him that “you do not own the thing that you love.” The second is about getting rejected on Valentine’s Day by the school’s only colored girl, who picks a popular white boy over him; he learns how much people’s romantic behavior (his interest in the girl and the girl’s interest in the white boy) follows social scripts and models social hierarchies, rather than truly following individual feelings and needs. The third is about his high school crush on a popular girl named Zaheera, who also likes him—but they are both too shy to say anything, and she soon moves to the United States. He learns that rejection is better than not acting at all, as inaction leads to uncertainty and regret. And the fourth is about taking Babiki to the dance—she refuses to go in with him but kisses him good night later, which shows him how little he understands romance and how much more he has to learn (it turns out that she does not speak English and has no idea what was happening all night).\n\nIn retrospect, Noah finally comes to understand his mother’s motivations for parenting him as she did: she wanted to push him toward growth in a way that only loving relationships can. He eventually realizes that his mother was trying “to discipline [him] before the system does.” After Noah’s brief stint in jail, his mother explains, “when I beat you, I’m trying to save you. When they beat you, they’re trying to kill you.” Although he distanced himself from the family for years before his mother was shot, Noah ultimately recognizes that her love for Abel was much more complex than he ever could have known. Even though Patricia does end up leaving Abel, Noah also realizes that he cannot blame her for failing to do so for so long, due to the complex interplay of their love and her fear that he would grow far more violent if she left (as he ultimately did). Noah ultimately comes to see love, not violence, as the solution to the sort of adversity he faced. Through reflecting on his relationship with his mother, he decides that love allows people to “create a new world” for another person—to create safety and force accountability in a world that seems otherwise completely defined by violence. And in turn he “create[s] a new world” for his mother, who decides to stop using physical discipline on her younger children.\n\nAs Noah learns the wisdom behind his mother’s attitude toward him throughout his childhood, he comes to realize that she has always held him to extraordinarily high standards only as a way to “create a new world” for him by showing him the potential that the rest of the world refused to see in him. More broadly, however, he shows how love can foster growth by teaching people enduring lessons about others’ humanity and creating relationships in which people hold themselves to fulfilling their potential. Whereas violence is almost always zero-sum, helping some advance only at others’ expense, love can be a means to mutual growth, especially when it forces people to confront failure."
