        "text": "Young adult (YA) literature or littérature jeunesse, explores the midway between childhood and adulthood. These books are usually told through the eyes of a tween or teenager. Oftentimes, these characters are coming of age. To come of age is one of the most relatable human experiences—something we all have gone through. We are always learning new things about our identities, facing new challenges, and growing from new experiences. So, while young adult books may be written from the adolescent perspective, they can be read by anyone—regardless of age. Young adult books offer many advantages. For adult readers, they can be a great way to re-connect with one’s teenage years. It’s also enriching to read from a young person’s point of view. In the past, French YA literature focused mostly on the experiences of white youth. However, over the past few decades, these works have evolved to incorporate more perspectives from traditionally marginalized groups. Author of both Children's and YA Books, Laura Nsafou is leading the way in this regard. And of course, these intermediate-level books are great French language skill-builders. Although they are rarely available in English translation, they introduce you to new vocabulary and common jargon while allowing you to practice reading more advanced grammar structures. French YA novels continue to be published and added to the impressive répertoire of French literature."
