        "text": "4.2.1 Elements of crime writing\n\nIn the case of Elements of crime writing, many of the texts pre-date the crime fiction genre that emerged as a recognisable literary genre in the mid-19th century and with academic recognition in the 20th century. However, in all the texts a significant crime drives the narrative and the execution and consequences of the crime are fundamentally important to the way the text is structured.\n\nAll set texts are narratives which focus on transgressions against established order and the specific breaking of either national, social, religious or moral laws. The focus in this component must be on ‘Elements’ and students need to consider the elements that exist in each of their texts. The elements that might be explored, depending on the individual text, include:\n\nthe type of the crime text itself, whether it is detective fiction, a post-modern novel, a revenge tragedy, an account of a life lost to crime\n\nthe settings that are created as backdrops for criminal action and for the pursuit of the perpetrators of crime: both places and times will be significant here\n\nthe nature of the crimes and the criminals, the criminals’ motives and actions\n\nthe inclusion of violence, murder, theft, betrayal\n\nthe detection of the criminal and the investigation that leads to his or her capture or punishment\n\nhow far there is a moral purpose and restoration of order\n\nguilt and remorse, confession and the desire for forgiveness\n\nthe creation of the criminal and their nemesis, the typical detective hero\n\nthe sense that there will be a resolution and the criminal will be punished\n\nthe victims of crime and the inclusion of suffering\n\nthe central motifs of love, money, danger and death\n\npunishment, justice, retribution, injustice, accusation, the legal system, criminal trials and courtroom dramas, imprisonment, death\n\nthe structural patterning of the text as it moves through a series of crises to some sense of order\n\nthe specific focus on plotting\n\nthe way that language is used in the world that is created; there may be use of a criminal register, legal register, police register\n\nthe way that crime writing is used to comment on society, particularly the representation of society at particular historical periods\n\nultimately, how crime stories affect audiences and readers, creating suspense, repugnance, excitement and relief.\n\nStudents study three texts from the following list: one post-2000 prose text, one pre-1900 poetry text and one further text.\n\nAuthor Text Time period Kate Atkinson When Will There Be Good News? Post-2000 Agatha Christie The Murder of Roger Ackroyd Samuel Taylor Coleridge The Rime of the Ancient Mariner Pre-1900 George Crabbe, Robert Browning and Oscar Wilde ‘Peter Grimes’,‘The Laboratory’, ‘My Last Duchess’, ‘Porphyria’s Lover’, 'The Ballad of Reading Gaol' Pre-1900 Charles Dickens Oliver Twist Pre-1900 Graham Greene Brighton Rock Ian McEwan Atonement Post-2000 William Shakespeare Hamlet Pre-1900"
