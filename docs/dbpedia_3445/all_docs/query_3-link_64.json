        "text": "Hundreds of people have been rescued from a scam centre in the Philippines that made them pose as lovers online.\n\nPolice said they raided the centre on Thursday and rescued 383 Filipinos, 202 Chinese and 73 other foreign nationals.\n\nThe centre, which is about 100km north of Manila, was masquerading as an online gambling firm, they said.\n\nSouth East Asia has become a hub for scam centres where the scammers themselves are often entrapped and forced into criminal activity.\n\nYoung and tech-savvy victims are often lured into running these illegal operations, which range from money laundering and crypto fraud to so-called love scams. The latter are also known as \"pig butchering\" scams, named after the farming practice of fattening pigs before slaughtering them.\n\nThese typically start with the scammer adopting a fake identity to gain their victim's affection and trust - and then using the illusion of a romantic or intimate relationship to manipulate or steal from the victim. This often happens by persuading them to invest in fake schemes or businesses.\n\nThursday's raid near Manila was sparked by a tip-off from a Vietnamese man who managed to flee the scam centre last month, police said.\n\nThe man, who in his 30s, arrived in the Philippines in January this year, after being offered what he was told would be a chef's job, said Winston Casio, spokesman for the presidential commission against organised crime.\n\nBut the man soon realised that he, like hundreds of others, had fallen prey to human traffickers running love and cryptocurrency scams.\n\nThose trapped in the Bamban centre were forced to send \"sweet nothings\" to their victims, many of whom were Chinese, Mr Casio said - they would check in on their recipients with questions about their day and if and what they had eaten for their last meal. They would also send photos of themselves to cultivate the relationship.\n\nMr Casio said those running the scam centres trapped \"good looking men and women to lure [victims]\".\n\nOn 28 February, the Vietnamese man escaped the facility by climbing up a wall, crossing a river, and seeking refuge at a farm. The farm owner then reported it to the police.\n\nThere were signs of torture on the man, including scars and marks from electrocution, said Mr Casio, whose team visited the man early this month.\n\nMr Casio added that several others have tried to escape but were always caught.\n\nPolice also seized three shotguns, a 9mm pistol, two .38 calibre revolvers, and 42 rounds of live ammunition from the centre.\n\nAuthorities are still in the initial stages of the investigation as most of those rescued from Thursday's raid are still \"shaken\", he said.\n\nIn May last year, Philippine authorities rescued more than 1,000 people who were held captive and forced to run online scams inside a freeport zone in Clark, a city also north of Manila - in what remains its biggest bust to date.\n\nA UN report last August estimated that hundreds of thousands of people from around the world have been trafficked to Southeast Asia to run online scams.\n\nThe BBC has previously spoken to people who have fallen victim to these criminal networks.\n\nMany have said they travelled to South East Asian countries such as Cambodia and Myanmar in response to job ads and promises of perks. They are trapped once they arrive, and threatened if they refuse to participate in the scams. Escapees and survivors have alleged torture and inhuman treatment."
