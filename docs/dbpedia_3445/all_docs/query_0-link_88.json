It’s very common for people to use them among their friends. It’s about the use of the language in context.\n\n“One thing that my research has shown is that impolite and offensive language is very much context-dependent. The language we use is not inherently polite or impolite, it’s about how we use it. It’s not just about what we say but it’s what we mean.\n\n“I want to continue work on the same issues and topics so I want to explore the language of cyberbullying a bit more, to understand how people use language creatively for such malicious purposes of bullying online and how this knowledge can hopefully help us come up with preventative measures.”\n\nIn the podcast, Tamineh speaks in detail about a research project focusing on the online abuse received by politicians in the course of their work.\n\n“One of the projects I’ve recently been working is the abuse that one of the Labour MPs, Stella Creasy, received for her views on abortion and how offensive that entire campaign got.\n\n“There are a lot of other MPs who received death and rape threats over the years and the police got involved in that.”\n\nTamineh also explains how the use of emojis in online communications can help people avoid misinterpreting messages that are not offensive in themselves.\n\n“Sometimes emojis may come in and help a bit by putting a smiley emoji or a heart emoji at the end of a sentence you may be able to mitigate the force of your sentence.”\n\nTamineh acknowledges that the era of global social media has made communication more difficult in the sense of having to be more careful about what we say online.\n\n“As far as linguistics is concerned, the most important thing is the awareness of the power of language and the fact that the words we choose matter and mean things. It’s important not to take that for granted when we communicate and remember there is always somebody out there who might interpret the message differently.”\n\nShe added: “It may make communication very difficult, constantly being careful about what to say, but that’s the reality because with social media we are all communicating with people beyond the geographical boundary we live in.\n\n“People in another part of the world may see things differently. That’s why we really have to be careful about the meaning of the things we say.”\n\n▪ Episode 3 of the ‘Society matters’ podcast can be found on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.\n\nNotes to editors\n\nAbout Aston University\n\nFounded in 1895 and a University since 1966, Aston is a long-established university led by its three main beneficiaries – students, business and the professions, and our region and society.
