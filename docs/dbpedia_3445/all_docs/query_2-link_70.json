        "text": "The only truth is music.”\n\nJack Kerouac\n\nHere is a post that I want to get right, because it is for YOU.\n\nIf you are reading this, it is for YOU. It is really that simple. It all starts with this premise.\n\nArt is how we decorate space and music is how we decorate time.”\n\nJean-Michele Basquiat\n\nAlthough this moment of time has been tarnished by the pall created by COVID, as I have stated in Ted Tocks Covers many times, music is what can carry YOU. The music provides a message, and it has the capacity to transport YOU through time. The song we listen to now can take YOU to another time and place. It can make YOU laugh, or cry, or recall why a particular person will always hold a special place in YOUR heart. By extension, certain pieces of music become symbolic of that sentiment. This will never change. I urge YOU to continue to decorate time with music and allow these special songs to bring these people closer to YOU. If those people are no longer with us, then the song YOU celebrate is no longer just a piece of art decorating a space in time; it becomes a masterpiece and it resides in YOUR very own museum.\n\nWhen Nick Lowe wrote ‘(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding’ it began as an idea on two levels. Initially it was a joke and a veiled jab at the peace movement of the ‘60s that had begun to decline by the time he wrote the song in 1973. Lowe wanted to write a song that appeared humorous on the surface, yet still managed to contain a message to consider.\n\nI wrote the song in 1973, and the hippie thing was going out, and everyone was starting to take harder drugs and rediscover drink. Alcohol was coming back, and everyone sort of slipped out of the hippie dream and into a more cynical and more unpleasant frame of mind. And this song was supposed to be an old hippie, laughed at by the new thinking, saying to these new smarty-pants types, ‘Look, you think you got it all going on. You can laugh at me, but all I’m saying is, ‘What’s so funny about peace, love, and understanding?’ And that was the idea of the song. But I think as I started writing it, something told me it was too good idea to make it into a joke. It was originally supposed to be a joke song, but something told me there was a little grain of wisdom in this thing, and not to mess it up.”\n\nNick Lowe\n\nAt the time Nick Lowe was with a popular English pub band called Brinsley Schwarz. It was a track on the 1974 album ‘The New Favourites of…Brinsley Schwarz’. Based on its pub popularity the song was released as a single, but it didn’t make the charts. Here is that release and what resides as the original version of ‘(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding’.\n\nAs you listen, sing along. I love this song.\n\nAs I walk through\n\nThis wicked world\n\nSearchin’ for light in the darkness of insanity\n\nI ask myself\n\nIs all hope gone?\n\nIs there only pain, hatred, and misery?\n\nAnd each time I feel like this inside\n\nThere’s one thing I wanna know\n\nWhat’s so funny ’bout peace love and understanding?\n\nOh\n\nWhat’s so funny ’bout peace love and understanding?\n\nAnd as I walked on\n\nThrough troubled times\n\nMy spirit gets so downhearted sometimes, sometimes\n\nSo where are the strong?\n\nAnd who are the trusted?\n\nAnd where is the harmony?\n\nSweet harmony\n\nCause each time I feel it slippin’ away\n\nIt just makes me wanna cry\n\nWhat’s so funny ’bout peace love and understanding?\n\nOh\n\nWhat’s so funny ’bout peace and love?\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nSo where are the strong?\n\nAnd who are the trusted?\n\nAnd where is the harmony?\n\nSweet harmony\n\nCause each time I feel it slippin’ away\n\nJust make me wanna cry\n\nWhat’s so funny ’bout peace love and understanding?\n\nOh\n\nWhat’s so funny ’bout peace love and understanding?\n\nOh\n\nWhat’s so funny ’bout little peace and love?\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah”\n\nNick Lowe\n\nBrinsley Schwarz resides as one of those influential bands that even though they never took flight, they are revered by artists who rose up the ranks later. For instance, The Clash were very much inspired by the style of this act. One other performer who recalled Brinsley Schwarz with fondness was Elvis Costello. In 1978, Elvis Costello and his band The Attractions recorded the cover that I posted as today’s feature song. Perhaps it was no coincidence that Costello’s producer was none other than Nick Lowe. At the time Lowe was dividing his time between his band Rockpile and production work. Elvis Costello and the Attractions needed a B-side for their 1978 single ‘American Squirm’. Here is Nick Lowe’s recollection of how ‘(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding’ came to be released by Elvis Costello.\n\nIt was [Costello’s] idea. I produced his records back then. … He was a fan of a band I was in before Rockpile, called Brinsley Schwarz. He used to come see us play. ‘Peace Love and Understanding’ was a Brinsley Schwarz song. When the Brinsleys broke up, like all groups, most of the songs sort of go into the dustbin, metaphorically speaking. And that was kind of one of them. But it was he who really popularized that song. It’s been covered by loads of people, and it would’ve disappeared if it wasn’t for him.”\n\nNick Lowe\n\nLet’s call Elvis Costello’s version the resurrection of a brilliant song. The ironic thing is, it was a bit of an afterthought. It was recorded only as a B-side to the single, as mentioned, so it wasn’t part of the original release of the album ‘Animal Forces’. When the song became popular it was swiftly added as the final track on the subsequent U.S. release of the album.\n\nOver forty years later, ‘(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding’ still strikes the listener with its raw energy and timeless message that inspires.\n\nHere is Nick Lowe and a re-release of the song from his 2002 compilation ‘Quiet Please…The New Best of Nick Lowe’. This version exists as one of many compilation releases for Lowe.\n\nThrough the years it has remained a Nick Lowe concert staple. Here is a live recording from 1982.\n\nBased on the popularity of ‘(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding’ it has become a very popular song for many artists to cover through the years.\n\nIn 1992, ‘(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding’ gained popularity with a new generation when a cover by Curtis Stigers was included as part of the soundtrack for the film ‘The Bodyguard’. As we all know this album also included the classic Whitney Houston cover of ‘I Will Always Love You’.\n\nHere is an all star jam from the 2004 ‘Vote for Change’ tour that featured an outstanding combination of recording artists including Bruce Springsteen, the Dixie Chicks, Eddie Vedder, Dave Matthews, John Fogerty, Michael Stipe, Keb ‘Mo and Jackson Browne. This version of the song has always given me chills. Both for the passion and the vitality of the message.\n\nHere is a fun version of the song featuring Stephen Colbert and friends on a Comedy Central special called ‘A Colbert Christmas: The Greatest Gift of All’. This performance features guests: Elvis Costello, Willie Nelson, Toby Keith, John Legend and Feist. It actually won a 2010 Grammy for Best Comedy Album.\n\nThe message continues, but in a more somber form. In 2018, yet another mass shooting in the United States occurred at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Eleven people were killed and six were wounded in this senseless crime. A Pennsylvania band called The Clarks released a cover of ‘(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding’ that saw all proceeds go to the synagogue.\n\nSince the early part of 2020, and the ravages of COVID-19 ‘(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding’ has taken on a bit of a different perspective. The message within the song become even more meaningful with lines like:\n\nAnd as I walked on\n\nThrough troubled times\n\nMy spirit gets so downhearted sometimes, sometimes\n\nSo where are the strong?\n\nAnd who are the trusted?\n\nAnd where is the harmony?\n\nSweet harmony\n\nCause each time I feel it slippin’ away\n\nIt just makes me wanna cry\n\nWhat’s so funny ’bout peace love and understanding?”\n\nNick Lowe\n\nThe fact that many people feel that measures put in place to counter the spread of COVID, or to make it easier for our institutions to deal with those unfortunate enough to have contracted the deadly virus, don’t apply to them definitely get me downhearted. I cannot fathom the selfishness or the stupidity. Over a year later, I rage at the idea that somehow people’s freedom is being challenged by being asked to wear a mask. People are sick. The death toll is well into the millions and this is the response of the misinformed, uneducated, me first fools? And who pays the price? The ones who comply in an effort to minimize the damage and help to rid the world of the threat. Here is a perfect summary of the present dilemma we face.\n\nAspects of our COVID exhaustion are due to the reality that many of us are carrying the weight of other’s irresponsibility.\n\nMany go about their lives, unencumbered with any feeling of social responsibility, then feel justified in their carelessness, at least partially protected by the herculean efforts of others.\n\nNot only are we carefully navigating a context foreign to us, sacrificially bearing a collective burden, we have to watch those efforts devalued by those who then pretend their carelessness is justified.\n\nWe’re holding a societal umbrella in a downpour; they’re laughing and pretending it’s not raining because they’re not wet. It’s exhausting.”\n\nMargaret Howard – LCSW\n\nTypically, I like to relay my feelings with my own thoughts, but I could not have said it better myself. I have family members who if they came into contact with a positive ‘Covidiot’ would be severely compromised…I mean fatally. It is not a joke. It is not about your freedom you melodramatic fools. Not once in the last year, have I felt like my freedom has been violated. Spare me. Get lost! You enrage me with your idiocy. Just stop.\n\nBack to the music. Perhaps a silver lining to the pandemic is the fact that several musicians have come together to share some heartfelt versions of songs that serve to bring us together.\n\nIn May of 2020, in the relatively early days of COVID, singer/songwriter Sharon Van Etten, along with Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age released a version of ‘(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding’ that focused on children and family, while providing a message that spoke to the fact that we are all in this together. It was partially directed by ‘the kids’.\n\nWe wanted to share something personal and universal. That we are all in this time together.”\n\nJosh Homme\n\nHere is their version of the classic song.\n\nFor the final cover, here is a remarkable version of ‘(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding’ by Larkin Poe, featuring Elvis Costello and arranged by producer Rob Mathes. This was done as a benefit for the David Lynch Foundation and the Center for Health and Wellness.\n\nA great cause, because once again, people with mental health issues are among the ones who are truly suffering at this time.\n\nIn order to get to the heart of the matter, it is my contention that music is integral to our well-being. I have often stated this in Ted Tocks. It is, and forever will be in my hashtag.\n\n#MusicisLife\n\nEvery person on earth turns to music at some point to help them survive. It’s up there with food, water, and shelter. It’s a basic human need.”\n\nAnthropological theory\n\nThis is only where it begins. On many occasions, as I have written over the last three years people have reached out to me with their memories related to a song I have featured. They thank me for taking them to a time and place. I appreciate the fact they share their feelings and express their gratitude. By writing Ted Tocks Covers, in many ways I am just the pilot, but the music is the plane. The time and place a song takes YOU back to is the destination, and I am happy to escort YOU. In many ways I am right there with YOU. Here is a great quote from Rob Halford, the dynamic vocalist of Judas Priest.\n\nThe music that touches you in your youth is magnified as you get older. Each record can be a virtual time machine – all you need is to hear a second or two and you go back to that place and time when you first heard it. It’s a brilliant feeling when music touches you so profoundly and stays with you through time.”\n\nRob Halford\n\nAs you listen, always be cognizant of this reality. Music connects, and truthfully, we are all the same. This sentiment is captured in this quote from Willie Nelson.\n\nWe are the same. There is no difference anywhere in the world. People are people. They laugh, cry, feel, and love, and music seems to be the common denomination that brings us all together. Music cuts through all boundaries and goes right to the soul.”\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nI couldn’t agree more.\n\nPerhaps there is no better way to conclude than this message from Tom Petty. On many occasions I have stated that I miss him every day. Fortunately, we still have his music. We are lucky to have music, period. It is our lifeblood. It is magic, in what it says and what it does.\n\nMusic is probably the only real magic I have encountered in my life. There’s not some trick involved with it. It’s pure and it’s real. It moves, it heals, it communicates, and does all these incredible things.”\n\nTom Petty\n\nYOU, the reader could go through this entire post and not like a single version of today’s feature song, but that would not make any of the ideas I have shared less true. It all comes down to one thing…\n\nThere is nothing funny about peace, love and understanding. If more of us took it seriously, the world would be a better place.\n\nWhat we really need to do is LISTEN. That would be a good place to start."
