Free\n\nLength: 7 hrs and 56 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n0 out of 5 stars 0\n\nPerformance\n\n0 out of 5 stars 0\n\nStory\n\n0 out of 5 stars 0\n\nIn 1985, Anthony Ray Hinton was arrested and charged with two counts of capital murder in Alabama. Stunned, confused, and only 29 years old, Hinton knew that it was a case of mistaken identity and believed that the truth would prove his innocence and ultimately set him free. But with a criminal justice system with the cards stacked against Black men, Hinton was sentenced to death. He resolved not only to survive, but find a way to live on Death Row. The Sun Does Shine is an extraordinary testament to the power of hope sustained through the darkest times.\n\nBusted\n\nA Tale of Corruption and Betrayal in the City of Brotherly Love\n\nWritten by: Wendy Ruderman, Barbara Laker\n\nNarrated by: Rachel Fulginiti\n\nLength: 6 hrs and 55 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n0 out of 5 stars 0\n\nPerformance\n\n0 out of 5 stars 0\n\nStory\n\n0 out of 5 stars 0\n\nThe remarkable lengths Ruderman and Laker go to for the story - chasing down witnesses on the city's grimmest streets, sifting through archive boxes and hours of surveillance tape for crucial clues, and coaxing reluctant victims to come forward - put their determination to balance motherhood with the career they love to the ultimate test."
