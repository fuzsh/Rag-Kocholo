        "text": "01 of 31\n\nAmanda Knox (2016)\n\nThe saga of Amanda Knox has been one of the most public cases of the modern age. This 2016 documentary chronicles her journey from being convicted for the 2007 murder of her roommate Meredith Kercher to her experience of being smeared by the press and her eventual acquittal. Knox tells her story in her own words, alongside interviews with her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (also convicted and acquitted) and others involved in the case, all speaking directly to the camera. As EW's critic observed of this effect, \"What you end up with are portraits of individuals — people who are scared or angry or ambitious — all a part of a story that, from the start, ignored their humanity.\" —Kevin Jacobsen\n\nWhere to watch Amanda Knox: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirectors: Rod Blackhurst and Brian McGinn\n\nRelated content: Waiting to Be Heard by Amanda Knox: Read EW's review of the $4 million memoir\n\n02 of 31\n\nAmerican Murder: The Family Next Door (2020)\n\nThis unusual documentary examines the heart-wrenching true story of what happened to Shanann Watts and her children when they disappeared from their Colorado home in 2018. Playing out as a found-footage film, American Murder: The Family Next Door is unique in that it unravels the details without traditional narration or extra dramatization. Instead, the chilling events unfold through the use of home movies, social media posts, phone calls, text messages, newscasts, and security footage from police officers and interrogation rooms. The result is an eerily intimate view into a terrible tragedy, and the film will leave you pondering the many public theories that have since come to light. —Melissa Sherrard\n\nWhere to watch American Murder: The Family Next Door: Netflix\n\nDirector: Jenny Popplewell\n\nRelated content: American Murder director on reclaiming Shanann Watts' voice from her killer\n\n03 of 31\n\nAmerican Nightmare (2024)\n\nOn March 23, 2015, Aaron Quinn dialed 911 to report a bizarre crime: He and his girlfriend, Denise Huskins, were ambushed in their home by an intruder who blindfolded them with blacked-out swim goggles, drugged them with NyQuil, and abducted Denise in the trunk of his white Mustang. But instead of finding refuge in the arms of the law, Aaron found himself in the crosshairs as the prime suspect. That is, until Denise reappeared days later, triggering a media storm that likened her ordeal to a real-life Gone Girl ruse. From the creators of The Tinder Swindler (2023) comes a riveting three-part docuseries that dives deep into more than just a headline-grabbing crime, dissecting matters such as the stigmatization of rape survivors, the influence of pop culture on our collective consciousness, and the shortcomings within our justice system. —James Mercadante\n\nWhere to watch American Nightmare: Netflix\n\nDirectors: Bernadette Higgins, Felicity Morris\n\nRelated content: Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn slams theory novel is related to missing woman case\n\n04 of 31\n\nAthlete A (2020)\n\nThis award-winning documentary follows the revelation that USA Gymnastics (USAG) doctor Larry Nassar had been sexually assaulting countless female athletes under his care. The exposé began when reporters at The Indianapolis Star got a tip that they should investigate USAG. As the truth slowly came out, gymnast Maggie Nichols (referred to as \"Athlete A\" at the time to protect her identity) was key to shedding light on the abuses that had been going on for years, supposedly with a nod from at least one of the organization's higher-ups. One of the rare examples of true crime being inspiring, Athlete A is a valuable record of recent history and a beacon of accountability. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Athlete A: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirectors: Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk\n\nRelated content: Netflix's Athlete A trailer digs into the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal\n\n05 of 31\n\nBikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator (2019)\n\nYoga’s evolution from a traditional Indian practice to Western exercise movement can be partially attributed to the rise of Bikram yoga. Bikram Choudhury — a world famous yogi whose clientele in the 1970s included everyone from Hollywood actors to Richard Nixon — founded Bikram’s Yoga College of India in Los Angeles, and his popularity and teacher training programs helped foster the yoga health trend in the late-‘90s. Described by one of his former students as a “cross between Mother Teresa and Howard Stern,” Bikram’s yoga empire came crashing down amidst accusations of rape and sexual harassment that emerged in the 21st century. A film directed by Eva Orner, Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator tells the story of Yogi Bikram’s rise and fall, as told by the people who studied with him, the women who were abused by him, and the followers who continue to defend him. —Ilana Gordon\n\nWhere to watch Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator: Netflix\n\nDirector: Eva Orner\n\n06 of 31\n\nCocaine Cowboys: The Kings of Miami (2021)\n\nThis fast-paced, gritty docuseries dives into the drug wars of the 1980s and how cocaine — and the money that followed it — transformed South Florida. The series describes the heyday of drug trafficking in Miami in particular, exploring how the kingpins held power through scare tactics and keeping the body count sky high. With detailed interviews, crime scene photos, and fascinating stories, Cocaine Cowboys gives a behind-the-scenes look into a world that seems far away. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Cocaine Cowboys: The Kings of Miami: Netflix\n\nDirector: Billy Corben\n\n07 of 31\n\nDirty Money (2018–2020)\n\nCorporate corruption is always entertaining, and Dirty Money carries that torch further. Each episode in its two seasons takes a deep dive into how greed, creative accounting, and outright fraud can cause widespread damage while those in the know make out like bandits. True incidents like the Volkswagen emissions scandal and the underhanded actions behind the growth of Wells Fargo are brought to life through interviews with both victims of these financial crimes and those who committed them. It's as infuriating as it is entertaining, and it's a great way to get a fully fleshed-out true crime story in quick hit episodes. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Dirty Money: Netflix\n\n08 of 31\n\nEscaping Twin Flames (2023)\n\nFans of Cecilia Peck’s Starz docuseries Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult might want to check out her newest project, Escaping Twin Flames. One of two documentaries released on the Twin Flames Universe cult in 2023 (the other is Desperately Seeking Soulmate: Escaping Twin Flames Universe, now streaming on Amazon Prime Video), Peck’s new three-part docuseries tells the story of a couple who converted their success on YouTube into roles as the leaders of a cult targeting people looking for love. The accusations leveled at the cult are familiar — abuse, control, indoctrination — but Escaping Twin Flames does a good job of shining a light on a little-known community that preys on people so determined to find love, they’re willing to look past the red flags of the high-control group they were in. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Escaping Twin Flames: Netflix\n\nDirector: Cecilia Peck\n\n09 of 31\n\nEvil Genius: The True Story of America's Most Diabolical Bank Heist (2018)\n\nIt's not hard to see how the 2003 murder of Brian Wells — now known as the \"collar bomb\" or \"pizza bomber\" case — still piques the curiosity of true crime enthusiasts even two decades later. This four-part docuseries reveals that nothing is as it seems, given that Wells may have actually been under duress himself when he tried to rob a bank in Erie, Pa., in 2003. Tune in for the twisted timeline of events that led to a senseless murder, and stay for the fascinating correspondence the directors maintained with the alleged mastermind behind the robbery-gone-wrong. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Evil Genius: The True Story of America's Most Diabolical Bank Heist: Netflix\n\nDirectors: Barbara Schroeder and Trey Borzillieri\n\n10 of 31\n\nThe Family (2019)\n\nFor some people, few things are scarier than a religious cult — unless that cult is also pulling the strings behind a powerful government. That's exactly what The Family claims is going on in Washington, D.C., as an influential group of Christian men called the Fellowship Foundation wields its influence to bring about its favored goals on a global scale. The five-part limited series teases out the few known details about the group, shedding light on the many conspiracy theories that surround its members, practices, and ambitions. If even just some of the criminal activity alleged in the series is true, it's pretty diabolical stuff. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch The Family: Netflix\n\n11 of 31\n\nGirl in the Picture (2022)\n\nThis one's for the diehard mystery lovers. When a woman is found dying on a roadside leaving behind a husband (or so he says) and son, it seems like an open-and-shut case of a tragic hit-and-run accident. However, discovering her true identity and what happened to her son after her death was a daunting task for the FBI and other authorities — exposing how a federal fugitive had kidnapped and abused the young woman decades prior. With more twists and turns than a long and winding road, Girl in the Picture offers an unforgettable ride. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Girl in the Picture: Netflix\n\nDirector: Skye Borgman\n\n12 of 31\n\nThe Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker (2023)\n\nAfter a video of Caleb \"Kai\" McGillvary animatedly recounting a crime he witnessed (and stopped with his hatchet) while hitchhiking in California in 2013 went viral, the young man became a national sensation. However, as the overnight spotlight drew cheers from admirers of his heroism across the country, it also caught the attention of authorities in New Jersey who thought Kai may be responsible for a murder on the east coast. This true crime documentary shows how the media's quick obsession with the Canadian fueled his rise to fame and played a major part in his 2019 murder trial. Even if you haven't seen the video, you might have seen a meme, song, or another piece of pop culture referencing Kai's memorable reenactment of \"smash, smash, smash\" — and The Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker does a great job of telling the much larger, darker story. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch The Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker: Netflix\n\nDirector: Colette Camden\n\nRelated content: Kentucky man sues Netflix for misuse of his photo in true crime documentary about killer\n\n13 of 31\n\nHomicide: New York (2024)\n\nOn the island of Manhattan there are two detective squads dedicated to solving the city’s most brutal and difficult homicides: Manhattan North and Manhattan South. In the docuseries Homicide: New York, law enforcement officers from these two police divisions recall some of the most taxing, scandalous, and puzzling murder cases from over the years. The series is executive produced by Law & Order creator Dick Wolf, which is fitting because the detectives, prosecutors, and forensic experts interviewed in Homicide: New York are basically the real life version of Law & Order characters. If you’re interested in learning more about some of the city’s most infamous and law enforcement-stumping murders, Homicide: New York is the docuseries for you — and good news.

Director Bryan Fogel unwinds this story in a gripping fashion, investigating illegal steroid use among athletes in Russia by developing a relationship with the head of an anti-doping lab in the country. The scientist, Grigory Rodchenkov, then drops a bombshell about his involvement in a doping program that allowed the country to evade detection in the 2014 Winter Olympics. This revelation soon becomes an international scandal, resulting in threats to Rodchenkov's life. The propulsive doc rightfully won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature, with Fogel stating in his acceptance speech, \"We hope Icarus is a wake-up call — yes, about Russia, but more than that, about the importance of telling the truth, now more than ever.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Icarus: Netflix\n\nDirector: Bryan Fogel\n\nRelated content: Lance Armstrong weighs in on doping documentary Icarus\n\n15 of 31\n\nJeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich (2020)\n\nBased on the 2016 book of the same name by James Patterson, this docuseries details the criminal case against convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Over four episodes, Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich explains how the billionaire leveraged his wealth, power, and connections to continue committing these crimes for years. Featuring interviews with survivors, including Virginia Giuffre and Maria Farmer; former staff members; and law enforcement, it's a harrowing tale you think you've seen play out in the news, but trust us — this docuseries reveals much more of the story. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich: Netflix\n\nDirector: Lisa Bryant\n\nRelated content: 5 of the most shocking moments from Netflix's Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich\n\n16 of 31\n\nThe Keepers (2017)\n\nThe most affecting cold case docuseries on Netflix is without a doubt the still-unsolved murder of Sister Catherine Cesnik. In 1969, the young nun was an English and drama teacher at a private all-girls high school in Baltimore before she went missing. Her body was found in 1970, and we learn through interviews with former students that she suspected a priest at the school of sexually abusing students. Each episode leaves viewers with more questions than answers, and by the end, there's still no definite conclusion. But the story leaves its mark nonetheless, with EW's critic praising The Keepers as \"synthesized with the compounds that have rejuvenated this very old, often dubious genre and made it a buzzy, conscionable kick.\" —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch The Keepers: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Ryan White\n\nRelated content: Netflix's The Keepers sparks petition for Archdiocese to release files\n\n17 of 31\n\nKeep Sweet: Pray and Obey (2022)\n\nThis isn't just another wild cult story. Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey documents the meteoric rise and fall of Warren Jeffs, the leader and self-proclaimed prophet in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), and how he manipulated young girls into an abusive polygamous relationship with him. Directors Rachel Dretzin and Grace McNally interviewed survivors to get to the heart of what happened to so many women who thought they were following a holy path — and what it took for them to finally summon the courage to escape. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirectors: Rachel Dretzin and Grace McNally\n\n18 of 31\n\nLover Stalker Killer (2024)\n\nCriminal cases don’t get much more diabolical than the one portrayed in Netflix’s 2024 documentary Lover Stalker Killer. A romantic tryst that descends into a life-ruining nightmare that will have you seriously debating deleting your dating profiles, Lover Stalker Killer is a true crime story that checks off every box in the genre. Without delving too far into the specifics, the documentary chronicles the terror inflicted by one person upon their former romantic partner after the relationship fails. The events unfolded in Nebraska during the 2010s, and if you haven’t heard the story of Cari Farver before, don’t Google: just turn on Lover Stalker Killer and prepare for a wild — and heartbreaking — ride. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Lover Stalker Killer: Netflix\n\nDirector: Sam Hobkinson\n\n19 of 31\n\nMadoff: The Monster of Wall Street (2023)\n\nChronicling the crimes of disgraced financier Bernie Madoff, the four-part docuseries details how he pulled off one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in history, taking Wall Street for a ride we'll be referencing for decades to come. Using interviews with victims, former employees, whistleblowers, investigators, and never-before-seen footage of depositions given by Madoff himself, it's clear that he's a master of manipulation, though the filmmakers point to the failure of regulators to act on the many red flags they saw along the way. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Madoff: The Monster of Wall Street: Netflix\n\nDirector: Joe Berlinger\n\nRelated content: Kevin Bacon lost 'most' of his money in Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme\n\n20 of 31\n\nMaking a Murderer (2015–2018)\n\nOver two seasons, viewers are walked through the events that landed Steven Avery in prison for nearly 20 years before he was eventually exonerated, only to end up back behind bars once accused of murdering a young photographer on his property. However, things are not as straightforward as they seem, with the docuseries generating plenty of publicity and calls to release Avery, all while Wisconsin officials cry foul over its depiction of their work. The show became a sensation, with EW's critic declaring, \"It's not only a gripping true-crime story, it's also the most moral one I've seen in a long time.\" —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Making a Murderer: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Moira Demos, Laura Ricciardi\n\nRelated content: New documentary series will follow up on Making a Murderer\n\n21 of 31\n\nOur Father (2022)\n\nAs far as true crime documentaries go, this one shows how dreams can actually become the stuff of nightmares without any murder or gory mayhem. Our Father details the shock and horror several people experienced when they learned they are half-siblings fathered by Donald Cline, a popular fertility doctor in Indianapolis who used his own sperm to impregnate dozens of patients without their knowledge that he was the donor. The film takes us through the families' discoveries and reveals the most unsettling truth of all: There's little, if any, accountability for this kind of fertility fraud. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Our Father: Netflix\n\nDirector: Lucie Jourdan\n\nRelated content: What to Watch: Our Father is a harrowing fertility horror story\n\n22 of 31\n\nSins of Our Mother (2022)\n\nSins of Our Mother is not for the faint of heart. Through firsthand accounts, viewers are introduced to Lori Vallow and her descent into intense religious fanaticism, with beliefs that people are filled with either \"dark\" or \"light\" spirits (or worse, spiritless \"zombies\" she and her fifth husband were tasked with killing off), that she could communicate with angels, and that the world would end in 2020. Soon, people started to turn up dead or missing, including two of Vallow's children — and this limited docuseries examines the build-up and aftermath of the troubled mother's alleged crimes. Even those who are only mildly interested in true crime stories won't be able to turn away from this one. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Sins of Our Mother: Netflix\n\nDirector: Skye Borgman\n\n23 of 31\n\nThe Staircase (2004–2018)\n\nThis 13-episode true crime miniseries covers the murder trial of Michael Peterson, a novelist who was accused of killing his wife, Kathleen, in their home after police found her bloody body at the bottom of a staircase. The question facing law enforcement seems straightforward enough: Was Kathleen's death a cold-blooded murder or an honest accident? But when Michael's secrets and a bit of international intrigue get thrown into the mix, things start to get hazy. The family at the center is left questioning everything as a documentary crew films their journey right from the start. With universal acclaim and real footage from the courtroom and family interviews over several years, The Staircase is one of the most intriguing true crime series on Netflix. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch The Staircase: Netflix\n\nDirector: Jean-Xavier de Lestrade\n\nRelated content: The Staircase subject Michael Peterson outraged by 'egregious fabrications' in HBO Max series\n\n24 of 31\n\nStrong Island (2017)\n\nYance Ford's Oscar-nominated documentary about the 1992 murder of his brother William is a deeply personal story of racial injustice. Told from Ford and his family's perspective, the film delves into the murder and subsequent trial, where an all-white jury failed to convict the killer, Mark P. Reilly, a white man. It's a difficult watch, but one that continues to be relevant as America reckons with the sins of the past. As EW's critic wrote of the film, \"Strong builds a poignant, methodical portrait of loss. Telling William's story won't bring him back, but at least it will let the world know he lived.\" —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Strong Island: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Yance Ford\n\nRelated content: Yance Ford makes Oscars history as first trans director to earn nomination\n\n25 of 31\n\nThe Three Deaths of Marisela Escobedo (2020)\n\nThis searing doc is all about the persistence of a grieving mother and her tireless journey to seek justice. Marisela Escobedo was a Mexican woman who became a social activist after the murder of her 16-year-old daughter, Rubí Frayre. She tracked down Rubí's killer, who subsequently confessed but was found innocent due to lack of evidence, which sparked outrage and caused Escobelo to keep fighting for justice and get a circuit court to overturn the acquittal. The film delves into corruption within the Mexican judicial system while also delivering an emotionally wrenching experience for the audience, serving as a powerful testament to a mother's love. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Three Deaths of Marisela Escobedo: Netflix\n\nDirector: Carlos Perez Osorio\n\n26 of 31\n\nTiger King (2020)\n\nThe drama that erupted between feuding big cat keepers \"Joe Exotic\" and Carole Baskin captivated audiences just as the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a standstill. Viewers were drawn into the world of the tiger trade in the heart of the nation, the bizarre characters that run the industry, and the various crimes they commit in their power struggle. With accusations of everything from animal abuse to attempted murder (plus a weird sex cult), Tiger King is one wildly entertaining true crime series. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Tiger King: Netflix\n\nDirector: Eric Goode, Rebecca Chaiklin\n\nRelated content: Tiger King producers share update on Joe Exotic's animal park: 'I suspect a lot of them will die'\n\n27 of 31\n\nTill Murder Do Us Part: Soering vs. Haysom (2023)\n\nThis twisty four-part docuseries chronicles the case of Jens Soering and Elizabeth Haysom, a couple charged with the 1985 murders of Haysom's parents. While Soering fully confessed to the murders, he would ultimately change his statement on the stand, implicating Haysom. The pair's conflicting testimonies made the case a big media sensation, with extensive coverage in the decades to come even after their convictions. Till Murder Do Us Part seeks to determine the truth behind it all using innovative technology and extensive research. One of the most compelling elements is new testimony from Soering himself, who was interviewed for the series following his 2019 prison release. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Till Murder Do Us Part: Soering vs. Haysom: Netflix\n\nDirectors: Andre Hörmann and Lean Leonhardt\n\n28 of 31\n\nThe Tinder Swindler (2022)\n\nSome people join Tinder to find love; others join to find marks. In The Tinder Swindler, director Felicity Morris investigates how an Israeli-born man posing as a Russian diamond heir managed to con multiple women out of millions of dollars by pretending to date them, before asking for emergency funds. A film that starts out as glamorous and aspirational as an Instagram influencer’s photo album, The Tinder Swindler soon takes a sharp turn into thriller territory. Instantly addictive and terrifying enough to cause viewers to reconsider their online dating habits, The Tinder Swindler shows how easily smart people are rendered vulnerable when love is involved. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Tinder Swindler: Netflix\n\nDirector: Felicity Morris\n\nRelated content: Tinder Swindler villain Simon Leviev claims he's 'not a Tinder swindler'\n\n29 of 31\n\nVictim/Suspect (2023)\n\nStudies indicate that the majority of women who experience sexual assault do not report the abuse, and the documentary Victim/Suspect gives some insight into one reason why women stay silent. Led by investigative journalist Rae de Leon, Victim/Suspect tells the story of young women who reported their abuse to the police, only to find themselves charged with the crime of having made a false report. A sobering account of the criminal, legal, and financial burdens foist upon sexual abuse survivors who are only trying to tell the truth, Victim/Suspect gives terrifying insight into one deeply flawed area of America’s justice system. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Victim/Suspect: Netflix\n\nDirector: Nancy Schwartzman\n\n30 of 31\n\nWild Wild Country (2018)\n\nWild Wild Country tells the story of the controversial Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, who set out to build his utopia in rural Oregon, much to the chagrin of local residents and ranchers. As tensions escalate, so does the growing cult, leaving the surrounding community cornered both physically and bureaucratically until their jaw-dropping last resort. The universally acclaimed docuseries is wildly devourable, and goes one step further by calling the audience's own values into question, testing the separation between church and state by turning the entire ideal on its head. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Wild Wild Country: Netflix\n\nDirectors: Maxclain Way and Chapman Way\n\n31 of 31\n\nWormwood (2017)\n\nThis creative docudrama examines the life and aftermath following the mysterious death of Frank Olson, a biological warfare scientist who worked for the CIA.
