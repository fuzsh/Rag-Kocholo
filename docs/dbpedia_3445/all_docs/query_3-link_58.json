        "text": "BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - Louisiana’s State Supreme Court has temporarily removed 19th Judicial District Judge Eboni Johnson Rose from the bench. The majority opinion of justices published Tuesday says she “poses a substantial threat of serious harm to the public and the administration of justice.”\n\nThe order sent down from the court Tuesday goes into effect immediately. A special counsel has been convened to investigate the judge’s conduct and has been ordered to have results within six months.\n\nJudge Johnson Rose has been the subject of a number of controversies including being accused of using inappropriate language while on the bench. She has had multiple rulings overturned by higher courts because of mistakes made during sentencing and trial. It is unclear which specific issue sparked the investigation by the state’s high court.\n\nJudge Johnson Rose is the daughter of 19th Judicial District Judge Ron Johnson and niece of Chief District Judge Don Johnson.\n\nTwo justices, Jay McCallum and William J. Crain, wrote that they agree with the decision to remove Johnson Rose but believe she should not be paid by taxpayers as the investigation against her unfolds.\n\nAssociate Justice Jay B McCallum wrote in a concurrence that he felt that the Judge Johnson Rose’s conduct was so egregious that she should be suspended without pay, however state laws do not allow for that.\n\n“...because our constitution and Supreme Court rules do not allow us to do otherwise, the taxpayers of this state are forced to bear the double burden of paying Respondent’s salary during her suspension and the cost of a pro tempore judge to serve in her stead. I concur because, were it in our power to do so, I would have made the suspension without pay and the expense of the pro tempore judge her responsibility,” wrote McCallum.\n\nThe associate justice went further to say the people of Louisiana should consider demanding that changes are made so that they are not on the hook to pay the costs while judges are investigated for improper behavior.\n\n“The people of this state should amend the constitution to allow us that option. Furthermore, this Court should amend its rules to require the suspended judge to bear the expense of any pro tempore judge who is required to preside in the suspended judge’s stead,” McCallum wrote.\n\nTwo other justices, Jeff Hughes and Piper Griffin, disagreed with the decision to remove Johnson Rose. Each wrote dissenting opinions. Hughes said given Rose’s “apology and remorse,” he would have placed her on probation under the “guidance of an experienced and respected mentor.”\n\nGriffin said the action is a “harsh remedy that must be exercised sparingly as it runs counter to the decision of voters.”\n\n“The actions of the judge in this matter and cause for concern and may ultimately lead to discipline,” Griffin wrote. “However, in my view, they are not so egregious as to warrant the most extreme measures at his point in the Judiciary Commission process.\n\nJohnson Rose, a Democrat, is currently running for a seat on the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal against 19th Judicial District Judge Kelly Balfour, a Republican.\n\nThe election is in November.\n\nAmong the controversies in Judge Johnson Rose’s court was the case of Bridgette Digerolamo.\n\nDigerolamo was arrested after waving a gun at people who were pushing water toward her home while driving through her flooded neighborhood.\n\nJustices later overturned Judge Johnson Rose’s verdict after noting that the judge read a not-guilty verdict in court but allowed the jury to continue to deliberate and change its mind.\n\nJustices found that Judge Johnson Rose then convicted Digerolamo before another judge stepped in and declared a mistrial.\n\nThe state supreme court later unanimously cleared Digerolamo of all charges.\n\nPrior to that situation, Judge Johnson Rose convicted former Baton Rouge Police Officer Donald Steele of “misdemeanor” grade malfeasance even though the charge is considered a felony in state law.\n\nAttorneys noted that misdemeanor-grade malfeasance does not exist. Johnson Rose later chose to issue a new verdict and acquit the former officer of all charges.\n\nJudge Johnson Rose was also involved in another high-profile spat with District Attorney Hillar Moore.\n\nThe WAFB I-TEAM uncovered documents showing that Judge Johnson Rose implied that Moore’s office targeted black offenders and wanted to “stick every ni**er in jail.”\n\nJust one day before being pulled off of the bench, Judge Johnson Rose reheard a case where she improperly sentenced Christian King, the Texas attorney accused of setting a fire at the home of the mother of his child.\n\nMoore’s office objected after the man received a sentence that was too lenient an inconsistent with sentencing guidelines.\n\nThe man agreed to a last minute plea deal with the state Monday which allowed him to avoid trial and was accepted by Judge Johnson Rose.\n\nWhen speaking with local experts, WAFB was told that this is a very unusual situation. Franz Borghardt is a defense attorney with Borghardt Law Firm and said he has never seen anything like this in his 20 years of practice. He said the Supreme Court must have found something in their investigation serious enough to suspend Judge Johnson Rose.\n\n“Well we don’t know, we don’t know because we don’t know what the allegations are that the Supreme Court acted on, if it is something that is unique to one incident and is unlikely to occur again, well then maybe not, if it’s a systemic issue well then it could have an effect on past cases and prospective cases,” Borghardt said.\n\nBorghardt says the Supreme Court must find willful incompetence on Judge Eboni Johnson Rose’s part during their investigation in order for her to be permanently removed.\n\n“They have to find that the judge wanted to do wrong, thought about doing wrong, and did what? Did Wrong. Not clearly, not the other side of it, which is hey, I’m calling balls and strikes, I called a ball, it really was a strike, or I made a judgment call and I was wrong on a legal basis, we don’t reprimand judges for that, we overturn decisions based on that,” Borghardt said.\n\nJudge Eboni Johnson Rose is also running for a position at the appellate court level this November. Another expert and law professor at LSU, Ken Levy, said the electorate deserves for this investigation to conclude before the election.\n\n“Because it’s only under investigation right now, there’s only probable cause, there hasn’t been a quote-unquote conviction. My understanding is she is still an eligible candidate and she may still be elected,” Levy said. “Whether she may ultimately take her seat if elected depends on the conclusion of the investigation by the Louisiana Supreme Court.\n\nRead more on those case by clicking the links below.\n\nClick here to report a typo."
