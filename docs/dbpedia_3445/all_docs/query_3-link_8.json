        "text": "Robert E. Holt is a Real Estate Broker in Moreno Valley, California. He is a graduate of the University of Washington in Seattle with a B.A. in Radio-Television. He was honored by being invited to join the prestigious Sigma Delta Chi, Professional Journalistic Society and went on to receive a law degree (LL.B.) and also a Ph.D.\n\nHis writings started in 2013 when he published 6 books with Createspace. Two were novels (over 50,000 words) and several were childrens' books.\n\nNOTE: His books are not long now. Each is a short story of only 10-12 pages long. Since they are short, he keeps the prices low, so you won't have to pay up to $25 for a full length novel. They are short, concise and to the point.\n\nHe realized that the future in writing is with e-books. So all of his books are now e-books on Kindle/Amazon. And a few are paperbacks on Amazon.\n\nHis first full length novel, \"Love and Crime\" was a first place winner. Followed by his second\n\nnovel, \"Don't Vote, Kill 'em!\""
