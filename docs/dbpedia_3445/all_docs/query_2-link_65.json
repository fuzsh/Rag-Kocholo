One-on-one with you\n\n“I’m in that place right now”\n\nTurning ‘round and ‘round in consideration\n\nA letter was received\n\nAh, I wonder what you could be waiting for\n\nLook, the left-behind letter addressed to me\n\nLaughing here and there\n\nHey Who is it? Who is it?\n\nAnswer me\n\nIs that a paper mache story?\n\nSurely, surely, it’s a fake\n\nWhere are you right now?\n\nWhat are you doing? It won’t reach\n\nThe nameless love letter addressed to you\n\nJust as always, the unnamed words are\n\nsent to my source, I’ve received it again\n\n“I’m in this dark room right now”\n\n“I’m looking at”\n\n“The shining, red moon”\n\nReading a letter with no name\n\nThe cat cried, “Don’t make a weird face”\n\n“The color of the moon is the same as that night, isn’t it?”\n\nThe shining clock face I don’t understand it anymore\n\nTurning ‘round and ‘round towards anxiety\n\nThe scene you came across\n\nI wonder, how did I do it?\n\nThe left-behind letter addressed to me\n\nLaughing here and there\n\nHey Did you know?
