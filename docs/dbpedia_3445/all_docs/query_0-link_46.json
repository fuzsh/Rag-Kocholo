        "text": "Using fluid hand gestures, expressive faces and precise body language, sign language interpreters in the Denver metro area facilitate clear communication for individuals fluent in American Sign Language.\n\nTheir skillful use of visual communication bridges linguistic gaps and enhances accessibility across a wide range of contexts and environments.\n\n“Basically anywhere that a deaf person goes where communication needs to happen and where the ADA protects them from discrimination, I am there,” said Rae Rose, local interpreter and owner of Rose Sign Language Interpreting.\n\n‘An instrument of fairness’\n\nWhen Rose was a child she had a conversation with a member of the deaf community that changed her life.\n\n“We were playing and there was a bit of a communication breakdown where she had a great idea but none of us were getting it and this woman, who was studying to be an interpreter came over and…she just interpreted our conversation and left,” Rose said. “I was like ‘I want to do that.”’\n\nSo, Rose became an American Sign Language Interpreter.\n\nIt was in college that she interpreted for the first time and felt she had chosen the right path.\n\n“It was probably two sentences (but) I was like ‘Oh man, oh man,”’ Rose said. “I had put all the pieces together and they had their conversation and I did it and it was nothing to anybody but I was over the moon.”\n\nRose founded Rose Sign Language Interpreting in 2009 and it “facilitates communication between people who sign and people who don’t sign.”\n\nWhether at a doctor’s office or while riding a pool noodle during a swim lesson, Rose signs in a myriad of environments including medical, education, behavioral and kids sports.\n\n“It takes a lot of creativity and a lot of different strategies to make those lessons visually successful but also working with deaf kids I have a lot more options,” Rose said. “I love seeing any of my consumers start at one place and end in a different place having achieved a lot. That’s one of the best parts of my job.”\n\nRose runs the day-to-day operations of her business and helps connect other interpreters with those who need the service.\n\n“I am a very big-picture person,” Rose said. “So I love seeing all the pieces fit together and I love doing it better. I saw some great things as a new member of the field but I wanted to reproduce and put my own sparkle on it.”\n\nAlong with providing interpreting services, Rose said her company is also big on advocacy and education.\n\n“We’re able to provide members of the hearing company a chance to learn ASL from a deaf person,” Rose said. “This is a deaf person sharing their culture, their birthright.”\n\nFor Rose, the aspect of interpreting that intrigued her was “the fairness of it.”\n\n“As a white woman with my allotted amount of privilege, to be able to be an instrument of fairness is worthwhile and to make it easy for as many people and as many organizations as possible to create fairness and create equity…that’s important,” Rose said.\n\nFilling in the gaps\n\nFor Colorado native and deaf sign language interpreter Jennifer Salaz, one of her favorite and most impactful times signing was when she interpreted for a deaf high school student.\n\nSalaz explained as a deaf interpreter she is able to fill in the gaps and expand on things for those whose first language is American Sign Language.\n\n“The student was having an in-depth conversation about a serious (topic),” Salaz said. “They were writing back and forth in the previous class with a different interpreter because the student didn’t feel comfortable. That wasn’t successful.”\n\nHowever, after she began interpreting for the two students, Salaz said the conversation was successful for both parties as they could better communicate.\n\n“They were able to have a genuine peer-to-peer conversation with the confidence that their information was safe and both walked away feeling excited to have a conversation with each other without…paper,” Salaz said.\n\nIn her capacity as a deaf interpreter Salaz said she works directly with deaf students who’ve immigrated from other countries and her work allows “for better access to communication and understanding for these students.”\n\n“It’s my language (and) being able to teach others that have moved from other countries is amazing,” she said. “Watching them finally able to communicate with a language they can use and call their own is very inspiring.”\n\nThe right register\n\nSimilar to Rose, Salaz also provides interpreting services in medical settings.\n\n“This is important because sometimes the hearing interpreter uses the wrong register, not serious or too serious depending on the situation, or uses words that the deaf consumer doesn’t understand,” Salaz said.\n\nRose said the way she interprets ASL depends on her consumer. It’s important to ensure they understand what is being said.\n\n“English has its own variations, its own dialects, its own accents. Everybody’s got their own level of fluency with English,” Rose said. “Same with ASL or any sign communication.”\n\nAs a deaf woman, Salaz said, she herself relies on interpreting services and has experienced misrepresentation “time and time again” including an experience when her daughter was taken away from her because she was “misrepresented by a ‘skilled’ hearing interpreter.”\n\n“All because the interpreter didn’t understand me or their ego was too big to ask for clarification,” Salaz said. “Because of this, I want to support the deaf community so they don’t have to experience the same injustices.”\n\nSalaz said her sister encouraged her to become a deaf interpreter and become involved with the community to help prevent similar issues from happening to others.\n\nThe future\n\nSalaz said interpreting in general is important for both hearing and deaf people and she describes the deaf community in Colorado as large.\n\nHowever, Salaz said many members of the deaf community grow up in hearing families and it can be isolating because of the communication barrier.\n\n“I am one of six kids, and if my sister, who can fluently sign, doesn’t attend a family event, I’m lost,” Salaz said. “I feel like most of my deaf friends have the same experience…I explain this because having the community is like having an additional family that shares the same experiences. Being able to share experiences, talk about life and communicate, that is key.”\n\nThis is something she thinks interpreters need to carry with them as they venture into the world.\n\n“I hope that interpreters would put their egos aside and realize this is about their work and not them,” she said. “They are amazing people and the deaf community welcomes them. We just want a clear message to be produced for all of us.”\n\nRose said she hopes for increased equity and recognition that everyday people can do something to make a difference.\n\nShe encourages hearing people to see interpreters as an awareness that there are deaf people in the same space as them who need to or enjoy frequenting the same environments.\n\n“Everywhere that you see an interpreter there maybe just think ‘I didn’t know there were deaf people in my town. Cool. Maybe I should learn a little ASL,”’ Rose said."
