        "text": "The following is a list of men in the Iron Military District of Utah Territory’s Nauvoo Legion militia whose names have been associated with the Mountain Meadows Massacre. The names have been gathered from a variety of sources that include eyewitness accounts, arrest warrants, criminal indictments, and newspaper articles.\n\nA completely accurate list of those who participated in or witnessed the murder of the California-bound emigrants may be impossible to compile. Many of the participants kept silent about their roles. The testimonies of many witnesses were given fifteen years or more after the massacre. Those who admitted being at the massacre were usually careful not to incriminate themselves and their closest associates.\n\nThe names are organized in alphabetical order. Each entry includes life span, as well as age, militia rank (where applicable), residence at the time of the massacre.1 Because of the varying credibility of evidence, a note of [A] or [B] has been placed after each individual’s name and age; [A] indicates there is strong evidence the individual planned, authorized, participated in, or witnessed the killing of emigrants, and [B] indicates that the evidence is inconclusive. Men whose names have been associated with the massacre have not been listed if there is little or no evidence to support that association.2\n\nAdair, George Washington, Jr. (1837–1909), 20. [A] Private, Company I, Fifth Platoon, Washington City. He admitted going to Mountain Meadows with the rest of his company from Washington and was present for the massacre. He possibly served as a messenger between leaders at the Meadows and Cedar City.3 He was indicted and arrested for his role in the massacre, but when prosecutors were unable to build a case against him, the charges were dismissed.4\n\nAllen, Ira (1814–1900), 43. [A] Second Lieutenant, Company E, Fifth Platoon, Cedar City. Philip Klingensmith testified that before the massacre Ira Allen told him a “decree had passed” committing the emigrant company “to destruction.”5 Allen attended the Sunday council meeting on September 6 that discussed the fate of the emigrants. He was one of the men on horseback during the final massacre whose orders were to catch and kill emigrants who attempted to escape the slaughter. After the massacre, he may have helped transport some of the emigrants’ property back to Cedar City.6\n\nArthur, Benjamin A. (1834–83), 23. [A] Sergeant, Company D, Fourth Platoon, Cedar City. Benjamin Arthur, Josiah Reeves, and Ellott Willden were ordered by John M. Higbee to follow the emigrants and find justification for an Indian attack against them. These three were also to encourage the emigrants to push on to the confluence of Magotsu Creek and the Santa Clara River, where the attack was originally planned to occur.7 John D. Lee reported that Arthur was with William Stewart and Joel White when emigrant William Aden was killed.8 Arthur was present at Mountain Meadows for the final massacre. Ellott Willden, however, told historian Andrew Jenson that Benjamin Arthur was unarmed.9\n\nArthur, Christopher Jones (1832–1918), 25. [B] Adjutant, Company G, Cedar City. The son-in-law of Isaac C. Haight, he had a confrontation with members of the emigrant train at the iron company store. He went to Mountain Meadows with Elias Morris late on Friday, September 11. The two arrived at the Meadows after the massacre ended.10\n\nBateman, William (1824–69), 33. [A] Sergeant, Company G, Fourth Platoon, Cedar City. Samuel Pollock recalled traveling with William Bateman to Mountain Meadows. On the day of the final massacre, Bateman carried a white flag toward the emigrants’ camp, allowing John D. Lee to negotiate for their surrender.11\n\nCartwright, Thomas Henry (1814–73), 42. [A] Private, Company D, Fourth Platoon, Cedar City. Samuel Pollock recalled traveling with him to Mountain Meadows.12\n\nClark, John Wesley (1818–69), 39. [A] Private, Company I, Third Platoon, Washington City. John Clark began traveling to Mountain Meadows in company with other men from Washington and Santa Clara on Monday, September 7, and arrived at the Meadows the following day.13\n\nClewes, Joseph (1831–94), 25. [B] Private, Company F, First Platoon, Cedar City. Joseph Clewes carried a message for Isaac C. Haight to Pinto on Monday, September 7, with orders for John D. Lee to stop any attacks on the emigrant train until further notice. As he attempted to return to Cedar City on Tuesday, he was ordered to return to the Meadows by John M. Higbee and therefore may have witnessed the killing of two emigrants who were near Leach’s Spring on their way to get help from Cedar City. Wednesday, Clewes and his brother-in-law Ellott Willden were compelled to don Indian apparel and run through emigrant gunfire. On Friday, shortly before the final massacre, Higbee sent Clewes back to Cedar City to report to Isaac C. Haight.14\n\nColeman, Prime Thornton (1831–1905), 25. [B] Private, Company H, First Platoon, Fort Clara. Prime Coleman was seen at the Hamblin ranch before the final massacre by Albert Hamblin, a Shoshone who was adopted by Jacob Hamblin.15 Coleman admitted to massacre investigator James H. Carleton that he went with Ira Hatch toward the Muddy River and while traveling through the Beaver Dam Mountains saw the footprints of three emigrant men who escaped from Mountain Meadows. His statement led Carleton to believe that Coleman assisted Hatch in tracking down and killing those men.16\n\nCurtis, Ezra Houghton (1822–1915), 35. [A] Second Lieutenant, Company E, First Platoon, Cedar City. Samuel Pollock said that Ezra Curtis ordered him to go to Mountain Meadows with a group that left Cedar City. Curtis was seen by John D. Lee at the Meadows with other militia officers before the massacre.17\n\nDame, William Horne (1819–84), 38. [A] Colonel, Iron Military District, Parowan. William H. Dame, the commanding officer of the militia in Iron and Washington counties, and his council in Parowan rejected militia action against the emigrants in deliberations before the initial attacks and again late on the night of Wednesday, September 9. After the Wednesday night meeting, however, Isaac C. Haight consulted with Dame privately, and Dame gave approval to attack the emigrants.18 Dame reportedly regretted that decision and left on Friday, September 11, with Barney Carter, Beason Lewis, and James Lewis to stop the massacre but arrived several hours too late.19 The next morning Dame and Haight argued at Hamblin’s ranch and later near the victims’ bodies over who was responsible for the decision to massacre the emigrants.20 Dame was indicted and arrested, but when no evidence could be procured for his conviction, he was released.21\n\nDickson, Robert (b. 1807), 50. [B] Private, Company H, Third Platoon, Pinto. Albert Hamblin recalled seeing Robert Dickson with other men from Pinto at Hamblin’s ranch during the week of the massacre.22\n\nDurfee, Jabez (1828–83), 29. [B] Private, Company E, First Platoon, Cedar City. Only John D. Lee’s memoirs place Jabez Durfee at Mountain Meadows before the massacre.23\n\nFreeman, Columbus Reed (1838–1907), 19. [A] Private, Company C, Fifth Platoon, Parowan. Though listed on Parowan militia rolls in June 1857, Freeman may have gone to the Meadows from Washington, where his parents and siblings were living at the time of the massacre. John D. Lee recalled Freeman being with a company from Cedar City.24\n\nHaight, Isaac Chauncey (1813–86), 44. [A] Major, Second Battalion, Cedar City. Some massacre sources assert that Isaac C. Haight was actually a lieutenant colonel, which would make him second only to William Dame over the entire Iron Military District. Militia records, however, do not support this assertion.25 Haight and other Cedar City leaders planned the initial attack on the emigrant company, not expecting it, however, to turn into a wholesale massacre. To hide their role, they hoped to blame Indians for what happened. Later, when some emigrants were killed and others became aware of white involvement in the crime, Haight convinced Dame to let him use local militiamen to help destroy all emigrants old enough to talk.26 Haight arrived at the Meadows late Friday night or early Saturday morning after the massacre.27 On Sunday, as James Haslam delivered Brigham Young’s orders to allow the emigrants to pass through unmolested, Haight “cried like a child” and proclaimed that it was “too late, too late.”28 Haight was one of the nine indicted in September 1874 for their roles in the massacre, but he went into hiding to avoid being arrested.29\n\nHamblin, Oscar (1833–62), 24. [B] Second Lieutenant, Company H, Second Platoon, Fort Clara. Oscar Hamblin, younger brother of Indian missionary Jacob Hamblin, apparently recruited Paiutes along the Santa Clara River and acted as an Indian interpreter at Mountain Meadows at least until Tuesday, September 8. Jacob Hamblin maintained that his brother brought the Indians to Mountain Meadows and then left.30\n\nHarrison, Richard (1808–82), 49. [A] Second Lieutenant, Company E, Third Platoon, Cedar City. Frank Jorden, a thirteen year-old stepson of Richard Harrison, recalled him talking to Ira Allen about the emigrants before leaving Cedar City with other militiamen. John D. Lee saw Harrison at Mountain Meadows on Thursday, September 10. After the massacre Jorden remembered Harrison having a pair of oxen and a wagon from the slain emigrants.31\n\nHatch, Ira (1835–1909), 22. [A] Private, Company H, First Platoon, Fort Clara. Although Ira Hatch was not at the final massacre on Friday, September 11, he reportedly led a band of Indians in tracking down and killing three emigrants who escaped from the wagon corral at Mountain Meadows before the final massacre.32 Henry and McCan Young, two Mormons returning from San Bernardino, California, witnessed Hatch’s role in the killing of the last emigrant, who was probably Abel Baker.33\n\nHawley, George (1824–1905), 32. [B] Sergeant, Company I, Fourth Platoon, Washington City. Although George Hawley’s brothers John and William are often named as massacre participants, only one list, attributed to John D. Lee, identified George at the massacre.34\n\nHawley, John Pierce (1826–1909), 31. [B] Sergeant, Company I, Fifth Platoon, Washington City. John D. Lee said John Hawley was with other men from Washington and Santa Clara on Monday night just south of Mountain Meadows.35 Hawley denied Lee’s claims, saying, “I was not the John Hawley that Lee speaks of; neither was I there, nor do I know any thing of how it was conducted only from hearsay.” He further claimed to have spoken publicly to Lee and others against the massacre when it was over, despite threats against his life.36\n\nHawley, William Schroeder (1829–93), 27. [A] Sergeant, Company I, Second Platoon, Washington City. John D. Lee claimed he was with the Washington group that arrived at the Meadows on Tuesday, September 8.37\n\nHigbee, John Mount (1827–1904), 30. [A] Major, Third Battalion, Cedar City. John M. Higbee played a major leadership role in the massacre, not only as a militia major, but also as Cedar City marshal and counselor to stake president Isaac C. Haight. Higbee attempted to arrest one or more of the emigrants while they were in Cedar City.38 He met with other leaders at Cedar City when the attacks on the emigrants were planned.39 He led a group of men that left Cedar City on Tuesday and arrived at the Meadows on Wednesday.40 Higbee went back to Cedar City and returned to the Meadows late Thursday night with orders from Isaac C. Haight to kill all the emigrants old enough to talk.41 As a militia commander, he gave the signal that initiated the final massacre.42 Philip Klingensmith recalled seeing Higbee kill an emigrant who appeared to know him and called him by name.43 Once the massacre was over, Higbee searched the bodies of the emigrants for valuables.44 Higbee was one of the nine indicted in September 1874 for their roles in the massacre.45 Higbee would avoid capture until the charges against him were dropped in 1896.46\n\nHopkins, Charles (1810–63), 47. [A] Private, Company D, First Platoon, Cedar City. Mormon Battalion veteran Charles Hopkins traveled to Mountain Meadows with a group from Cedar City. Despite being only a private, Hopkins was considered one of the leaders at the Meadows, probably because of his relatively senior age, prominence in the community, and military experience. He met with other leaders at the Meadows just before the final massacre.47\n\nHumphries, John Samuel (1825–1903), 31. [A] Musician, Company F, Cedar City. Although several lists identify a massacre participant named John Humphries, they give no specifics about his role.48\n\nHunter, George (1828–82), 29. [A] Sergeant, Company D, First Platoon, Cedar City. John D. Lee saw George Hunter among the other militiamen from Cedar City on the night before the massacre.49 After the massacre, he helped gather the emigrants’ property and stock.50\n\nJacobs, John (1825–1919), 31. [B] Private, Company E, Fourth Platoon, Cedar City. John D. Lee claimed John Jacobs was at Mountain Meadows shortly before the massacre.51 Seeing his name published in connection with the massacre, Jacobs wrote to the Salt Lake Daily Herald, “I was not there at all, nor indeed within thirty-five miles of the place at the time.”52\n\nJacobs, Swen (1823–91), 33. [A] Second Lieutenant, Company E, Fourth Platoon, Cedar City. He was identified as being at the Meadows by John D. Lee and Philip Klingensmith.53\n\nJewkes, Samuel (1823–1900), 34. [B] Musician, Company E, Cedar City. John D. Lee identified Samuel Jewkes with other militiamen from Cedar City at the Meadows. However, other information casts some doubt as to whether or not he was present at the massacre.54 He was one of the nine indicted in September 1874 for their roles in the massacre.55 Despite being indicted, he was never tried. The indictment may have resulted from unproven rumors that a child in Jewkes possession was killed for knowing too much about the massacre.56\n\nJohnson, Nephi (1833–1919), 23. [A] Second Lieutenant, Company D, Second Platoon, Fort Johnson. Paiute language interpreter Nephi Johnson met with Isaac C. Haight near Cedar City after news was received about the initial attack on the emigrants. Johnson himself went to the Meadows on Thursday with other reinforcements from Cedar City. He interpreted for John D. Lee as Lee gave instructions for the massacre. Johnson gave the orders on Friday for the Indians to attack.57 During a conversation with a senior Mormon leader from Salt Lake City in 1895, Johnson said that “white men did most of the killing.”58\n\nKlingensmith, Philip (1815–81?), 42. [A] Private, Company D, First Platoon, Cedar City. Though only a private, he was considered a key supporter of the massacre and used his role as local bishop to exert his influence.59 Traveling to the Meadows late Tuesday, September 8, he killed one of two emigrants found in the cedars near Leach’s Spring.60 He admitted shooting one of the emigrant men on Friday.61 He also reportedly had one of the children killed.62 Most of the remaining surviving children were taken back to Cedar City, where Klingensmith aided in finding homes for them. After the massacre he took initial control of much of the emigrant property, some of which was stored in the Cedar City tithing office. He gave an affidavit in 1871 concerning his role in the massacre, which was later published. Although Klingensmith was one of the nine men indicted for the massacre, he turned state’s evidence at Lee’s first trial in 1875, thereby gaining immunity from prosecution.63\n\nKnight, Samuel (1832–1910), 24. [A] Private, Company H, Second Platoon, Fort Clara. Samuel Knight was living at the Hamblin ranch at Mountain Meadows during the late summer of 1857. He received orders from Cedar City to recruit Indians near Washington and Santa Clara for an anticipated attack on the emigrants “at the junction of the Santa Clara and Magotsu.” Knight returned to Mountain Meadows on Monday with fellow Indian missionary, Dudley Leavitt. On the day of the massacre, Knight drove one of the lead wagons that carried the wounded emigrants and the young children. Although Lee said that Knight helped to kill the wounded in the wagons, Knight claimed that he had to use all of his strength to calm his horses who were startled from the gunshots.64 This claim was supported by Nephi Johnson who testified that he saw Samuel Knight “on the ground holding his horses” until the killing was over.65\n\nLeavitt, Dudley (1830–1908), 27. [B] Private, Company H, First Platoon, Fort Clara. When Dudley Leavitt met John D. Lee on Magotsu Creek on Monday night, Lee tried to persuade him to ambush two emigrants who were away from camp making pine tar, but Leavitt refused.66 Leavitt’s son Henry said of his father’s role in the massacre, “It was always my understanding that father was one of the scouts who rode horseback with messages back and forth.” Historian Juanita Brooks recalled her grandfather Dudley Leavitt saying, “I thank God that these old hands have never been stained by human blood.”67\n\nLee, John Doyle (1812–77), 45. [A] Major, Fourth Battalion, Harmony. Lee led the first attack on the emigrants just before dawn on Monday, September 7.68 He negotiated the emigrants’ surrender and helped kill those in the two lead wagons. During the massacre, he reportedly helped to kill emigrants in the two lead wagons as well as a few others nearby.69 John D. Lee, one of the nine men indicted, was the only person to be tried and executed for his role in the massacre. Although Lee reportedly admitted killing five or six emigrants, his confessions, published posthumously by prosecuting attorney Sumner Howard and Lee’s defense attorney William W. Bishop, maintained that he objected to what was done and did not kill anyone.70\n\nLoveridge, Alexander Hamilton (1828–1905), 29. [A] Sergeant, Company F, Third Platoon, Cedar City. Cedar City resident Henry Higgins saw Loveridge travel with other militiamen bound for Mountain Meadows. John D. Lee recalled seeing Loveridge at the Meadows.71\n\nMacfarlane, Daniel Sinclair (1837–1914), 20. [A] Adjutant, Company D, Cedar City. As adjutant, it was Daniel Macfarlane’s job to carry orders on horseback to leaders in different parts of the field.72 When the emigrants proceeded out of their wagon corral fortifications, Macfarlane headed the group of women and children behind the lead wagons.73 As one of the men on horseback, Macfarlane was to prevent any of the emigrants from attempting to escape.74\n\nMacfarlane, John Menzies (1833–92), 23. [B] Adjutant, Second Battalion, Cedar City. There is debate about whether John Macfarlane was at the massacre. Judge John Cradlebaugh issued a warrant for his arrest in 1859.75 Lee’s confession in Mormonism Unveiled asserts Macfarlane’s presence, but with some uncertainty.76 Macfarlane served as an attorney on the defense team for Dame and Lee in 1875, and there is speculation that Lee’s lead attorney and editor, William W. Bishop, added Macfarlane’s name to Lee’s original manuscript because of a personal dislike for him.\n\nMcMurdy, Samuel (1830–1922), 26. [A] Private, Company E, First Platoon, Cedar City. Samuel McMurdy carried Cedar City militiamen to the Meadows in his wagon the night before the massacre.77 During the massacre, McMurdy drove the lead wagon and according to John D. Lee assisted in killing the wounded in the two wagons.78 After the massacre McMurdy transported some of the surviving children back to Cedar City.79\n\nMangum, James Mitchell (1820–88), 37. [A] Private, Company I, Fourth Platoon, Washington City. James Mangum claimed he was recruited to go to Mountain Meadows by Carl Shirts to help with Indians but returned home after the Indians threatened his life.80 William Young, however, recalled returning to Washington with Mangum after the massacre.81\n\nMangum, John (1817–85), 40. [B] Private, Company I, Fourth Platoon, Washington City. John D. Lee’s memoirs claim John Mangum helped him talk to Paiutes at Mountain Meadows some time before the final massacre but may have mistaken James for John.82\n\nMathews, James Nicholas (1827–71), 30. [B] Second Lieutenant, Company I, Second Platoon, Washington City. John D. Lee was the only witness who identified Mathews, saying he saw him with other men from Washington on Monday night, September 7.83\n\nMorris, Elias (1825–98), 32. [A] Captain, Company E, Cedar City. Though not at the massacre, Morris was involved in its planning at Cedar City as captain of a company that included many eventual participants and as second counselor to stake president Isaac C. Haight. His mother, Barbara Morris, was reportedly threatened by members of the emigrant train as they passed through Cedar City. Morris later claimed that at the September 6 council meeting, he “opposed severe measures” against the emigrants and suggested postponing any action until counsel could be received from Brigham Young.84 On Wednesday evening he accompanied Haight to Parowan. Although he said he attended only the council at William Dame’s house that agreed to send aid to the emigrants, evidence suggests he was also at the “tan bark council” in which Dame gave Haight approval for the massacre.85 One notable massacre participant, William C. Stewart, implicated Morris in the decision to kill the emigrants. In an 1890 letter, Stewart, impoverished and in hiding, recalled a conversation he had with Church Apostle Erastus Snow: “He [Snow] asked me if Elias Morris sent me any money. I said no. He said if he would lend you $1000 it is nothing but what he aught to do.” Stewart later added, “To save [Morris] & others, I am an Exile. He was I. C. H[aight’s] Councler & only for him & a few more I would not bee here.”86 Morris, along with Christopher J. Arthur, made his way to the Meadows on Friday but did not get there until after the massacre.87\n\nPearce, Harrison (1818–89), 38. [A] Captain, Company I, Washington City. Harrison Pearce led militia men from Washington toward Mountain Meadows on Monday, September 7, arriving the next day.88 John Hawley recalled Pearce making inflammatory speeches against non-Mormons in a public meeting after the massacre.89\n\nPearce, James (1839–1922), 18. [A] Private, Company I, Fifth Platoon, Washington City. James Pearce, Harrison’s son, first saw the Arkansas emigrants when he passed them on the road on the way to his family’s home in Washington. He left with the militia from Washington and Santa Clara on Monday and arrived at the Meadows the following day.90 He got sick after eating fresh beef given to the militia at the Meadows and as a result stayed at the militia camp during the massacre.91\n\nPollock, Samuel (1824–91), 33. [A] Sergeant, Company E, First Platoon, Cedar City. Samuel Pollock was ordered out to the Meadows by his militia officers in Cedar City.92 Pollock had been given guard duty Thursday night and may still have been on duty the next day when he witnessed the massacre from in or near the militia campsite.93\n\nReeves, Josiah (1835–1914), 21. [B] Private, Company G, First Platoon, Cedar City. Josiah Reeves, along with Ellott Willden and Benjamin Arthur, was sent out from Cedar City by John M. Higbee to follow the emigrants to Mountain Meadows. The three were to gather information that might justify an attack on the emigrants and to encourage them to move on to the confluence of Magotsu Creek and the Santa Clara River, where the first attack was originally planned to occur.94 During the week of the massacre, his brother-in-law Samuel Pollock saw him at Hamblin’s ranch separating Hamblin’s stock from the emigrants’.95 Although he was seen in the area, it is unclear where Reeves was at the time of the final massacre.\n\nRiddle, Isaac (1830–1906), 27. [B] Private, Company H, Fourth Platoon, Harmony. Isaac Riddle, an Indian missionary from Pine Valley, was in Cedar City on Tuesday when he was suddenly rushed home by Isaac C. Haight, who told him there “was a fuss with the Indians,” and he “had better go home and attend to [his] affairs.” Riddle traveled with John M. Higbee’s group of men that left Cedar on Tuesday. Riddle may have witnessed the killing of two emigrants near Leach’s Spring. He said he traveled with the militia group as far as Pinto before turning south toward his home in Pine Valley. Although Riddle did not make it to Mountain Meadows, he may have been sent to look for other emigrants who had gone to make pine tar.96\n\nRobinson, Richard Smith (1830–1902), 26. [B] Second Lieutenant, Company H, Third Platoon, Pinto. Richard Robinson, considered the leader of the Pinto settlement, received messages from leaders in Cedar City in the days leading to the massacre. One of the messages Robinson saw was the one Joseph Clewes delivered to Amos Thornton calling for hostilities against the emigrants to cease until word could be received from Brigham Young in Salt Lake City. Albert Hamblin remembered seeing Robinson at Hamblin’s ranch with other men from Pinto. He may have been there to pass on one of those messages. Though it appears that Robinson and the other Indian missionaries from Pinto were not directly involved in the massacre, they were keenly aware of the developments at the Meadows throughout the week. When Edward Dalton and Jesse N. Smith reached Pinto on Wednesday, September 9, the Pinto missionaries told them of the unraveling siege at the Meadows. Dalton and Smith immediately returned to Parowan to report to Dame where they “expressed much disgust over what they had seen and learned, as John D. Lee and other white men were assuming a very hostile attitude toward the emigrants in connection with the Indians.”97\n\nShirts, Don Carlos (Carl) (1836–1922), 21. [A] Second Lieutenant, Company H, Fourth Platoon, Harmony. Don Carlos Shirts was sent by his father-in-law John D. Lee to recruit Paiutes and white militia in the Santa Clara and Washington region.98 At Mountain Meadows, Shirts was given responsibility over the Indians.99 Although Don Carlos appeared to carry out his duty as Indian interpreter and leader, Lee referred to him as “cowardly” and “made him suffer for being a coward.”100 According to Shirts’s son Ambrose, Lee made these comments because Don Carlos gave orders to the Indians that were in direct contradiction to the orders given him by Lee. After the massacre, Mary Adoline Lee divorced Shirts with her father’s help.101\n\nSlade, William Rufus, Sr. (1811–72), 46. [A] Private, Company I, Third Platoon, Washington City. William Slade Sr. traveled to Mountain Meadows on Monday and Tuesday with his son and other men from Washington.102 Philip Klingensmith remembered talking to Slade just before the final massacre.103\n\nSlade, William, Jr. (1834–1902), 23. [A] Sergeant, Company I, Third Platoon, Washington City. The younger William Slade arrived at the Meadows on Tuesday with his father and other men from Washington and was seen by John D. Lee and Philip Klingensmith at the Meadows before the massacre.104\n\nSmith, Joseph Hodgetts (1819–90), 38. [B] Private, Company F, First Platoon, Cedar City. A list of massacre participants attributed to John D. Lee and released to the public by his attorney William Bishop identified “Joseph Smith, of Cedar City.”105 However, Lee makes no mention of him in his published confessions, nor is there any mention of Joseph H. Smith by any other eyewitnesses. In 1859 Judge John Cradlebaugh issued an arrest warrant for Smith in connection with the massacre, but it may have resulted merely from the fact that one of the surviving children was recovered from Smith’s home just a short time before.106\n\nSpencer, George (1829–72), 27. [A] Adjutant, Company I, Washington City. In 1867 George Spencer wrote to Mormon apostle Erastus Snow confessing that he was “in that horrid ‘Mountain Meadow affair.’”107 An 1875 article called Spencer a “mono-maniac” about the massacre, adding that “he talked constantly of the part he had enacted in the frightful tragedy.”108\n\nStewart, William Cameron (1827–95), 30. [A] Second Lieutenant, Company F, First Platoon, Cedar City. On Sunday evening, September 6, William Stewart and Joel White headed to Mountain Meadows, sent by Isaac C. Haight either spur Lee on or, more likely, to call him off. Arriving on Monday after the initial attack, Stewart, in an effort to contain the situation, killed nineteen year-old William Aden between Mountain Meadows and Cedar City. He returned to the Meadows again on Tuesday with the group of men led by John M. Higbee.109 During the final massacre on Friday, September 11, Stewart broke from the ranks of the other militia to chase after and kill emigrants who survived the initial volley of bullets.110 Samuel Knight later added, “He seemed to be filled with an insane desire to slaughter as many as possible, and he hewed them down without the least mercy.”111 One resident of Cedar City, Thomas Willis, recalled that Stewart often spoke about the massacre.112 Stewart was one of the nine men indicted for the massacre in 1874 and lived a life of exile to avoid capture by authorities.113\n\nStoddard, David Kerr (1830–1913), 27. [B] Musician, Company F, Cedar City. Although no eyewitnesses saw him at Mountain Meadows, Stoddard’s neighbor John Bradshaw recalled seeing him at Cedar City with other men mustered to go to the Meadows.114\n\nStratton, Anthony Johnson (1824–87), 33. [B] Second Lieutenant, Company E, Second Platoon, Cedar City. John D. Lee identified Anthony Stratton with other militia recruits from Cedar City at the Meadows the night before the final massacre.115\n\nTait, William (1818–96), 38. [A] Captain, Company F, Cedar City. William Tait, a former drill master in the British Army stationed in India, was one of the few men in the Iron Military District with formal military training. He traveled with John M. Higbee and others in the first wave of militia that left Cedar City on Tuesday, September 8.116Tait admitted being present at the massacre on Friday but claimed that he and his men didn’t kill anyone.117\n\nThornton, Amos Griswold (1832–1902), 24. [B] Sergeant, Company H, Third Platoon, Pinto. Amos Thornton, accompanied by two others, visited the emigrants in their camp at the Meadows on Sunday, September 6.118 The next day at his home in Pinto, Thornton received orders delivered by Joseph Clewes from Isaac C. Haight to have Lee stop the attack on the emigrants until word could be received from Salt Lake. Albert Hamblin recalled seeing Thornton at Hamblin’s ranch during the week of the massacre, likely to deliver the message Clewes gave him at Pinto.119\n\nTullis, David Wilson (1833–1902), 24. [A] Private, Company H, First Platoon, Fort Clara. David Tullis worked for Jacob Hamblin at his ranch at Mountain Meadows during September 1857. On Saturday, September 5, Tullis met Benjamin Arthur, Josiah Reeves, and Ellott Willden, who reported the emigrants’ “sauciness” in Cedar City. Tullis would later direct members of the Arkansas company to the south end of the Meadows to camp.120 Tullis admitted being close enough to hear gunfire during the week of the siege. He also saw Indians and militiamen traveling along the road towards the emigrant camp.121 One of the surviving children, six-year-old Rebecca Dunlap, identified an “Englishman named Tullis” as having murdered one of her parents.122 According to Albert Hamblin, Tullis transported the surviving children to Hamblin’s ranch after the massacre.123\n\nUrie, John Main (1835–1921), 22. [A] Adjutant, Third Battalion, Cedar City. John D. Lee identified John Urie as being with other men from Cedar City at the Meadows on the night before the final massacre.124 After the massacre, Urie helped to guard the emigrants’ property and later assisted in bringing it back to Cedar City.125\n\nWestern, John (1807–65), 49. [B] Sergeant, Company F, First Platoon, Cedar City. Some accounts name “John Weston” as a massacre participant.126 Although the name is difficult to decipher in the shorthand of the second Lee trial, Nephi Johnson recalled a John “Weyson,” “Weeson,” or “Reeson” taking a wagon to Mountain Meadows the night before the massacre. In longhand transcriptions of the trial, the name was recorded as “Weston” or “Western,” an inaccurate reflection of the original shorthand.127 No one named Weston is known to have lived in southern Utah in 1857. “John Western” is the closest name, but evidence of Western’s participation is inconclusive.128 Johnson may have been referring to John Willis.129\n\nWhite, Joel William (1831–1914), 26. [A] Captain, Company D, Cedar City. Before the emigrants’ arrival at Mountain Meadows, Joel White accompanied Philip Klingensmith to deliver a message from Isaac Haight to leaders at Pinto.130 When William Stewart killed emigrant William Aden on September 7, White reportedly wounded Aden’s companion, who was able to escape back to the emigrant camp.131 During the massacre, White and Stewart reportedly broke ranks to chase after and kill emigrants who survived the initial shooting. In the middle of the confusion White and Stewart were nearly killed themselves by fellow militiamen mistaking the two for escaped emigrants.132 Although White admitted that he was at the massacre, he claimed that he did not have a gun.133\n\nWhite, Samuel Dennis (1818–68), 39. [B] Private, Company F, Fifth Platoon, Fort Sidon [Hamilton’s Fort]. Although Samuel White was identified as a massacre participant in lists released to the public by John D. Lee’s attorney William Bishop, Lee made no mention of Samuel White in his published confessions.134 White’s widow, Mary, said her husband “opposed the killing of the company.” She also said that White angered Isaac C. Haight by interfering with Indians.135\n\nWiley, Robert (1809–72), 47. [A] Sergeant, Company E, Third Platoon, Cedar City. Samuel Pollock recalled traveling with Robert Wiley to Mountain Meadows. The night before the massacre Wiley met with John D. Lee, Philip Klingensmith, and other leaders at Hamblin’s Ranch.136\n\nWillden, Ellott (1833–1920), 23. [A] Private, Company F, Fourth Platoon, Cedar City. Ellott Willden, along with Benjamin Arthur and Josiah Reeves, was sent to the Meadows on Friday, September 4, by John M. Higbee to gather information from the emigrants that might justify an attack against them, as well as to encourage them to move further down the trail to where the attack was originally supposed to occur.137 After the first attack on the emigrants, Willden loaned his pair of flintlock pistols to William Stewart, who used them to kill William Aden on Monday, September 7. Willden also saw the bodies of two emigrants who were killed Tuesday night while on their way to Cedar City for help. On Wednesday, Willden said he was forced to dress in Indian apparel and run through emigrant gunfire.138 Lee recalled Willden amusing himself by sitting under a shade tree and shooting in the direction of the emigrant camp with a gun that did not have enough range to reach it.139 Willden, however, told Andrew Jenson in 1892 that he was unarmed during the massacre.140 Willden was one of nine men indicted in September 1874 for their roles in the massacre. He was arrested but never tried.141\n\nWilliamson, James (1813–69), 44. [A] Private, Company D, First Platoon, Cedar City. John W. Bradshaw saw James Williamson mustering with other militia recruits in Cedar City, and Joel White recalled traveling to Mountain Meadows with him.142\n\nWillis, John Henry (1835–88), 22. [B] Second Lieutenant, Company G, First Platoon, Cedar City. Although John Willis maintained in his testimony during the trial of John D. Lee that he did not go to the Meadows until after the massacre was over, Phillip Klingensmith said he may have taken his wagon and team to the Meadows the night before the massacre.143 Klingensmith could not remember if Willis joined the party of militiamen at the massacre or remained at Hamblin’s ranch on the north end of Mountain Meadows.144 After the massacre, Willis assisted in transporting some of the surviving children back to Cedar City.145 One of those children, Nancy Saphrona Huff, who lived with Willis until she was recovered in 1859, remembered Willis taking her from the site of the massacre.146\n\nYoung, William (1805–75), 52. [A] Private, Company I, Fourth Platoon, Washington City. William Young may have first heard about the massacre plans directly from John D. Lee while visiting Harmony on the night of Saturday, September 5.147 Two days later at his home in Washington, Young was ordered to go with the militia by Harrison Pearce. He traveled to Mountain Meadows with other men from Washington and Santa Clara on Monday, September 7, and arrived on Tuesday. On one occasion he accompanied Lee on a visit to Paiutes in their camp at the Meadows.148 On Friday, September 11, William Young remained at the militia camp with Samuel Pollock and James Pearce. From a vantage point near the camp, he witnessed some of the final massacre.149\n\nNotes\n\n1 The sources for the militia members’ ranks and places of residence are William H.

The birth and death dates were obtained from family records and census reports.\n\n2 Some accounts of the massacre from secondhand and apocryphal sources often listed individuals as participants in the massacre. Those names have not been included because they cannot be substantiated from the available primary evidence, such as eyewitness accounts of the massacre. In 1859, after Judge John Cradlebaugh conducted an investigation he issued thirty-eight arrest warrants for individuals believed to be connected with the massacre. According to William Rogers, who assisted in Cradlebaugh’s investigation, one witness came forward and presented twenty-five to thirty names of participants. It is unclear how Cradlebaugh obtained the other eight to thirteen names. While most names from Cradlebaugh’s arrest warrants have been identified from other sources, some cannot be verified as participants. These include: William Riggs, [Alexander] Ingram, Ira Allen’s son, Jabes Nomlen [Jabus Nowlin], John W. Adair, [Oscar?] Tyler, Samuel Lewis, Sims Matheny, and Samuel Adair. Two names, Joseph Elang and F. C. McDulange, cannot be identified as individuals living within the Iron Military District in 1857. Two other names, E. Welean and James Price, are likely references to Ellott Willden and James Pearce, respectively. Therefore, only the names that are supported by other evidence are reflected in this appendix.

Additionally, Jacob Forney listed a “Bishop Davis” among the “names of the persons the most guilty.” Although, likely a reference to William R. Davies, the bishop at Harmony, no eyewitnesses or other known sources place him at the massacre. J. Forney to A. B.

Brothers Henry and McCan Young were traveling back to Utah from San Bernardino, California, when they encountered the last adult emigrant to escape the massacre, probably Abel Baker. The Youngs offered assistance to young Baker and provided a horse for his journey. Baker, too injured and weary to push on to California, agreed to return with the Youngs back to the Utah settlements. When they approached the crossing of the Muddy River, they were met by Ira Hatch and a company of Paiutes who killed the emigrant. McGlashan, “Mountain Meadow Massacre,” mentions a J. M. Young. Beadle, Western Wilds, 500–1, also mentions a John M. Young, who he says witnessed the killing of the last emigrant. There is little documentation found on either Young brother, and this could be referring to either one of them.\n\n34 “The Mormon Massacre: Names of All the White Murderers,” New York Herald, May 22, 1877, also reprinted in “The Massacre: The Names of All the Whites Who Participated in It,” Salt Lake Daily Tribune, May 30, 1877. The name “George Hanley” that appears in this newspaper list is likely a reference to George Hawley. Even though it said George was dead, he had actually just left Utah. Iowa, Shelby County, Grove Township, 1880 U.S. Census, population schedule, 8. This list, which claimed to be published posthumously from a handwritten note by John D. Lee, included several names that were not associated with other lists attributed to Lee, nor are the names verified from other sources. Those names, as listed in the article, are: J. [Jehiel] McConnel, “two men named Curtis,” J. [Jonathon] Pugmire [Sr.], Sam Adair, Nate Adair, George Hanley [Hawley], Hairgraves, and William Hamblin. Ezra Curtis is known to have lived in southern Utah in 1857 and was identified as a massacre participant by eyewitness accounts.

According to family tradition another of the Jacobs brothers, Christopher was forced to join the company going to Mountain Meadows. “He told them they could force him to go but they could not force him to kill anyone after he got there. This he didn’t do as he wouldn’t fire a gun.” However, another account places Christopher Jacobs somewhere else at the time of the massacre. John Chatterley claimed Christopher Jacobs accompanied him on a reconnaissance mission along the Sevier River to look for signs of the approaching U.S. army which was feared to have taken a southern mountain pass into Utah.

Although eyewitnesses William Young and Samuel Pollock verify Pearce’s claim that he was sick and remained at the militia camp during the massacre, one legend claimed James was shot at by his father Harrison Pearce for attempting to protect an emigrant girl from the slaughter. The bullet reportedly grazed the side of his face creating a noticeable scar.

The warrant could have been intended for either William Rufus Slade Sr. or his son William Slade Jr. Utah and the Mormons, 19. In his closing argument for the first Lee trial, defense attorney Jabez Sutherland contended that Slade remained at the militia camp during the massacre; however, this assertion is not supported by the trial testimony of eyewitnesses. Two of those who stayed at the camp during the massacre, William Young and James Pearce, saw Slade at the Mountain Meadows but did not say he remained in the camp. Jabez Sutherland, United States v.

A family legend claimed three women from Pinto, knowing of the massacre plans, put make-up over Tullis’ upper-body, arms and face, and placed hot bricks around his bed to make him look like he had a fever. When the militia leaders came to get him he would groan and act like he was terribly ill, and was thus able to escape participation. Tullis made no mention of faking ill during the two known statements he made regarding the massacre (Forney and Jenson). One of the women that allegedly helped Tullis was the wife of Richard Harrison. The Harrisons were living at Cedar City at the time of the massacre and Richard was also implicated as a participant.

Later, he also provided some whiskey to the militia going to Mountain Meadows as a gift for the Paiutes. And although he supplied both sides, Western himself did not go to Mountain Meadows. Robert E.
