It opened in 1908 under the proposal of Kate Barnard, commissioner of Charities and Corrections, and with the support of Governor Charles N. Haskell. The prison housed both male and female inmates as well as individuals of all races. The Oklahoma State Penitentiary Collection [2010.055] consists of prisoner picture cards, fingerprint cards, prison rodeo records, and guard shift logs. Although there are thousands of cards in the collection, not all prisoner cards are available at the OHS.\n\nPrisoner Photograph Cards\n\nThis index provides basic information about the prisoners; however, the photograph cards also include images, work details, and additional information including next of kin and religion. This index includes all prisoner photograph cards in the collection.\n\nPrisoner Fingerprint Cards\n\nThis index is a work in progress. The Oklahoma State Penitentiary fingerprint card index corresponds with the prisoner photograph cards. The earliest fingerprint card is from 1906, however, early cards are very rare. Most of the cards are from the 1910s through the 1940s. They provide information such as crime, sentence length, where the individual is from, and in some cases a description of the person. A few of the cards have photos.\n\nPrisoner Intake Ledgers\n\nWe have received a donation of intake record ledgers from the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. The records are organized by prisoner record number and range from 1909 to the 1950s. There are two gaps of numbers that are missing from the collection- 18875-20162 and 36726-38017. These records have not been indexed yet. The records generally include name, record number, conviction, personal information such as marital status, education level, “reason for downfall,” and family members. The records can also include previous terms, either in Oklahoma, or in other states. You must provice the month and year of incarcertaion for OHS staff to search these records."
