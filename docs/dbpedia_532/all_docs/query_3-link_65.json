He was engaged in merchandising and his store was adjoining his residence.\n\nMoore and Jackson Carney were well acquainted with each other, and the former after robbing a man who was intoxicated of some ten dollars, left the country, and was absent some nine or ten months, before the murder was committed. He returned to the neighborhood about seven days ago - came to the store of the deceased about 11 o'clock a. m., on the 4th inst., remained there the balance of the day, and about dark shot Jackson Carney and with a revolver, one shot taking effect in his throat and the other near the mouth passing through the head.\n\nMr. Carney's wife was shot though he head, the ball entering the left ear and passing out at the back of the head. Mr. Carney was living alone with his wife. They were found on Sunday the 5th about 4 o'clock p. m., the husband lying on his back in the store room and his wife on the far side of the residence some twenty feet part both expired almost immediately after being shot.\n\nThe murder wife was so near the out-law that a portion of her clothing caught fire from the burring power - her person was considerable burned in one or two places from the burning of the clothing.\n\nThe murdered took some $400 in money, a revolver, and hat belong to the deceased, and left his own hat and a small single barrel pistol.\n\nHe arrived at Lewis Woodridge's at 8 o'clock on the evening of the murder and remained there during the night. Next day he went to church and on Monday, at 10 o'clock a. m., he was arrested by the sheriff of this county, taken to Cassville the county seat of this county an there lodged in jail.\n\nAn inquest was held on the afternoon of the 8th, and a verdict given that Jackson Carney and wife came to their death from a pistol fired by George Moore. On Tuesday afternoon the husband and wife were buried side by side in the same grave and the same coffin. There were more persons present at this funeral than ever assembled at any funeral to this county. They murdered husband was well respected by all who knew him. He was known al through this section of country to be good a citizen and a kind husband, no man ever lived a more honorable or peaceful life. Those who knew him loved and respected him. His wife was one the best of women - kind, dutiful and affectionate. It is thought that neither husband nor wife had an enemy in the world. The neighbors and acquaintance were excited to the very highest extent by this sad occurrence. Nothing but seeing the murder punished could satisfy them.\n\nOn yesterday morning some two hundred of the deceased's friends assembled, rode quietly into Cassville, demanded of the sheriff the keys to the jail. The sheriff seeing that a refusal would amount to nothing, deliver the keys to the outraged populace.\n\nThe door of the jail was soon unlocked. The murder taken out, a suitable rope was in readiness and soon the guilty murder and robber was hanging suspended in the atmosphere with nothing to sustain him, but the hangman's rope. He was hung between two posts within six feet of the court house. He was requested and given time to confess, but refused; he did not appear to be frightened in the least. It is very probable that he was so hardened to crime that death had no fears to him; he was hung about noon, and I learn was still hanging about sunset yesterday evening. On this person showed? up in different pairs of his clothing was found $20. of the money he took from Mr. Carney after he committed the murder.\n\nThe store where this sad affair occurred being to Messrs. Robertson & Mason of Springfield, MO, and John Carney, father of deceased. The murdered man Jackson Carney was employed by them to conduct and attend to the business of the store.
