The funeral occurred on Tuesday.\n\nLorain County Reporter\n\nSaturday, March 18, 1893\n\nAmherst\n\nIt is with feelings of unusual emotion, that I am called upon to chronicle the very sudden death of Mr. Adam Heussner, which occurred sometime during the night of March 10th. He was born at Kalekobes, Kreis Hersfield, Germany, June 5th, 1820 and came to America in 1837, in the month of October. The first six years of residence in this country was spend in (then) Black River, this county from thence he removed to Henrietta, where he has ever since resided.\n\nIn August, 1843 in Vermillion, O[hio], he was wedded to Miss Elizabeth Hasenpflug. To this union there has been born six children, four sons and two daughters. His wife and two children, one son and one daughter survive him. His first purchase was made in 1848, and it consisted in what was then known as the Hale farm. Very much, and that, too which is very creditable, might be said of him. He was a man of very positive qualities, marked individuality, and with almost unequaled energy. His mind was remarkably clear and investigating, possessing a keen perception, vivid imagination, and culminating in sound judgment. His counsel was sought and relied upon with implicit confidence. His was a philosophical mind, delighting in contemplation of scientific problems which life presents. During the last years of his life his thoughts were much directed to our obligation to God, with whom he felt at peace and a blessed assurance of his acceptance. And thus it was that he passed from the repose of sleep to the repose of death. The last few days of his life were accompanied by fairly good health. He was heard walking about his room about 11 o'clock Friday night. No notice; however was taken of that, it being his practice to read to a late hour. His death was not known until the morning of the 11th at which time he was discovered peacefully at rest, all of the surroundings giving evidence that he passed away without a pang or struggle. The large concourse of people that attended his ??? today, (many of whom have known him for half a century), attest to his sterling integrity, his upright character, as well as the high esteem in which he was held by this entire community.\n\nAbstracted by Norma Karter, Elyria newspaper lookups\n\nHILL, Reuben\n\nThe Elyria Republican Newspaper\n\nJanuary 19,1882\n\nObituary, LaGrange, January 12, 1882\n\nDied, December 29th, 1881, after an illness of about 10 days, Reuben Hill, Jr., aged 89 years and 4 months. He was born August 29th, 1792, in Washington Co. N.Y., and in 1813 entered the United States service under Gen. McClure. He was married to Paulina Coe in 1814, moved to Ohio in 1845 and bought a tract of land in the township of Vermillion, where he worked at his trade, that of blacksmith, and cleared his farm until 1855, when he sold out and moved to Iowa. The following spring he moved to Minnesota, where he spent the summer, then moved back to Florence Township. His wife died in September 1870, and in 1876 he with his son Harvey came to La Grange. He was appointed to several county offices in New York State, and was a man fond of reading, and even in his extreme old age was well informed as to the current events of the day. He loved to read his bible and religious books. He was converted and united with the Christian Church in the town in which he lived in New York, more than 50 years ago. When he moved to Ohio he brought his letter of dismission from the church and some time afterwards became a member of the church of the same faith in East Norwalk. He was very hospitable, and did a great deal for the church according to his means. (His own written history could not be found and it is thought he destroyed it). He knew it was his last sickness, and his death was peaceful and quiet. The funeral services were held at the house on Friday afternoon by Rev. R. McCaskey, and on Saturday his body was taken to Berlin for burial beside his relatives.\n\nSubmitted by Richard Kurish\n\nHINKSON, Rollin E.\n\nEvening Telegram, Elyria, Ohio\n\nMonday, October 21, 1918\n\nROLLIN HINKSON LOSES IS LIFE WHILE ENROUTE TO FRANCE\n\nLocal Musician was Passenger on ill fated ship\n\nNews of the tragic death of Rollin Hinkson, son of Harry Hinkson, city auditor and well know contractor, was received in this city this morning. The young man went down on the transport Ticon (Ticonderoga) which was shelled by a German destroyer off the coast of Ireland on October 2, 1918. On the same boat were one hundred and twelve others all of whom were reported lost. Walter Peters and one or two others of this city were said to be among them but the report to this effect could not be confirmed and is probably not true.\n\nThe unfortunate soldier left Elyria about August 1 last year and for a time was located at Camp Sherman. He was there but a short time when he was assigned to the heavy artillery. About six weeks ago he was sent to Hampton Roads and then sent to France. He was en route there when his boat was shelled. The deceased was aged 25 years and was married less than a year ago. He was well known and popular in Elyria and his death is mourned by a large circle of friends. His father is confined to his home on Middle avenue by pneumonia and is in a very serious condition.\n\n(Rollin was the son of Harold Hinkson and Bertha M. Eckler, Husband of Evelyn. He was killed in action WWI, September 30, 1918 - Military Service records)\n\nMike Parton\n\nHIST, Roland A.\n\nFind Body of Elyria Man:\n\nPolice gave a verdict of suicide today in the death of Roland A. Hist, 41, of 118 Clark street whose body was found late yesterday afternoon in the woods between Garford and Prospect streets, more than a mile from his home.\n\nFollowing an investigation several strange circumstances concerning his death, which was brought about by stab wounds in his heart. Police Lieut. L. E. Sweet said today that he was convinced it was a suicide.\n\nThe theory that he might have been murdered and robbed was discounted when $45.00 was found in his pockets, which was the amount of money members of his family said he had with him when he left his home at 8:30 A.M. yesterday to go for a walk.\n\nWhen he failed to return, his wife, Dorothy Hist, became alarmed and reported his absence to police at 1:55 yesterday afternoon. His body was discovered by his brother, Edward of Elyria, late in the afternoon.\n\nHad Poor Health\n\nLieut. Sweet said Hist had not been in good health and that he had threatened at times to take his life. He formerly worked as a truck driver here, and lately worked for a taxi company it was reported.\n\nOne of the puzzling circumstances of his death was that his shirt had no hole in it at the place where he was stabbed. Examination disclosed that he could have been stabbed only by unbuttoning his shirt, but this circumstance was made even more puzzling by the fact that the shirt was buttoned and in perfect order when he was found. Another strange fact was that the was lying on his back with his hands at his side and his legs straight out, a position that he could hardly have fallen in had he stumbled along through the woods after stabbing himself.\n\nPolice also made a search of the vicinity where the body was found, but were unable to find any instrument used to make the wound. A small knife was found in his pocket, but it could not have made the wound.\n\nExamination of the body by Coroner S. C. Ward lead to the conclusion that whatever was used was thrust into the region several times because of several lacerations on the heart. Examination of the location where he was found also failed to reveal any trace of scuffling, indicating that he might have been dragging his feel (sic).\n\nHis body was taken to the Nichols Funeral Home where funeral services will be held at 1:30 P. M. Sunday with Rev. Alva Cox of Lorain officiating.
