        "text": "April 1, 1957- This seems a logical time to start using this diary which I won a chance to buy a couple of weeks ago (March 17, bingo). All Fools Day! Carl showed up at chow with a sohde (sp) bunch of trinkets his kids had wrapped for him. Installed heaters today and got most of them wired in. (These are probably heaters for the instrumentation to be used in Antarctica.)\n\nApril 2, 1957-Today another blizzard gusts to about 60, but it's still not very coldâwell above zero. Minus 82 at the pole today. Finished heaters and thermostats today. Carl's brother reported a full page of pictures in the NYTimes including a color shot of the flag-raising. Sullivan did well by us. Still have hope we get a chance to see some of these things. still have hopes of a polar trek. Looks like a cinch.\n\nApril 7, 1957-Went up on the cap after breakfast with Don Burnett and Black Sam to blast a trench for studies of the shear moraine. Beautiful viewâiridescent clouds. Took a number of pictures of the area. Back for evening chores. (Lt. Don Burnett is Officer in Charge. Don is shown on the left in the adjacent photo. At right is Carl Eklund. Black Sam is the nickname of Dick Cameron because of his very dark beard.)\n\nApril 8, 1957-got up at about 4:45 to see my first cometâPons-Winnecke, about 5 degrees above the horizon, almost due east of us. Overslept as a result, Carl and Sam were headed for S-2, but couldn't find trail so returned. Looked 2-1/2 hours for one stake. As a result, much flag making tonite. Trail markers every 1/4 mile. Broke out my std magnetograph today. Got timing system rigged up and batteries filled. Only 8 out of twelve bottles were good. (The comet appears to be misidentified.According to Charles Bell and amateur astronmer specializing in comets, the Pons-Winnecke comet, now designated 7P/Pons-Winnecke, was not observed by anyone in 1957. It passed perihelion in 1951 andÂ 1964.. Here is a reference to the Arend-Roland comet, \"Southern Hemisphere astronomers scrambled to observe the comet at this point, as a very small window existed with which to see the comet before it was again lost in the sun's glare prior to its second conjunction with the sun. A French Antarctic Expedition at Adelie Land saw the comet on April 6 and said the tail extended 3-5 degrees.Â \"this seems consistent with the groups\"' observation Again according to Charles Bell. \"OnÂ April 8, 1957, there were two bright comets,Â C/1957 P1Â (Mrkos) andÂ C/1956 R1 (Arend-Roland). In those years they were designated with year and alpha numeric letter by discovery or year and roman numeral as to perihelion passage.C/1957 P1Â (Mrkos) = 1957dÂ Â = 1957 VC/1956 R1Â (Arend-Roland) = 1956hÂ Â = 1957 III, Both would have been possible to be sighted from southern latitudes because of their sky declination and solar elongation.\n\nC/1956 R1Â (Arend-Roland) was a morning comet with low solar elongation 18 degrees andÂ -10.0 degree declination.Â\n\nC/1957 P1Â (Mrkos) was an evening comet with about 74 degrees elongation with a very southerlyÂ -55.8 degree declination.\n\nJohn Bortle's \"THE BRIGHT-COMET CHRONICLES\" indicates that:\n\nCOMET C/1957 P1 (MRKOS; O.S. 1957 V).Â Followed with the unaided eye from July 29 until the end of Sept.;Â TÂ = 1957 August 1, (too late to be seen by Dick in April.)\n\nCOMET C/1956 R1 (AREND-ROLAND; O.S. 1957 III).Â Naked-eye visibility extended from mid-Mar. until mid-May;Â TÂ = 1957 April 8.Â\n\nObservable only from the southern hemisphere in March and early April, rising steadily to first magnitude\"\n\nBell concludes, \"SoÂ I think the cometÂ Richard J. Berkley observed wasÂ C/1956 R1Â (Arend-Roland) because it was very near the horizon in the morning and was observable from the southern hemisphere during April 1957.\" Many thanks to Charles Bell for his detailed analysis and confirmation of my conjecture based on my provisional research.\n\n)\n\n(S-2: One of the key sciences during the IGY was glaciology, and to this end the Wilkes winter crew included a team of three glaciologists, Olav Loken, John Molholm, and led by Richard Cameron. One of their key objectives was setting up a glaciology research sub-base on the polar ice cap. While Wilkes was being constructed, a short excursion onto the plateau was undertaken, and the trail was marked and nicknamed the Sullivan Trail. On February 22 the glaciologist followed the Sullivan Trail about 10km from Wilkes up onto the edge of the plateau and set up a meteorological shelter, called Site-1. On March 11 Operation Crampon (Cameron, Loken, Molholm, Eklund, Honkala, and Noonan) set out along the Sullivan trail, past Site-1, with the goal of setting up the glaciology sub-base. The location was to be \"well above the equilibrium line where we could expect to find the annual firn layers preserved in the stratigraphy\" and for safety and logistical reasons within a day's travel for a heavily loaded Weasel. (firn: granular snow, especially on the upper part of a glacier, where it has not yet been compressed into ice.)\n\nAfter 11 hours of travel from Wilkes, during which time the slope had been gradually leveling off, until the terrain was close to flat, Dick Cameron announcing \"This is the place\". The new sub-base called Site-2 (S2 for short) was located 85km from Wilkes and 1300m above sea level. Straight away the team set up a Jamesway hut, a weather station, a large grid of surface stakes to measure snow accumulation and horizontal ice deformation, and then started a pit which would eventually extend hundreds of years back in the ice record. However, for now it was just a start and the team headed back to Wilkes.\n\nThe glaciology team was back at S2 on April 25, and Dick Cameron and John Molholm continued the excavation of a deep pit to investigate the accumulation of snow on the ice cap. Over the next few months, with members of the Wilkes crew regularly relieving the S2 crew, a pit 2m square was dug down 115 feet, back through 175 years of accumulated snow, to snow laid down in the year 1783. The pit was excavated by hand with pick ax, with snow and ice hauled out with a wooden box named the Berk. Olav Loken recalls \"After we no longer were able to throw out by hand the 'debris' we picked out from the bottom of the pit, we turned to the 'Berk' until that was filled and then pulled it to the surface with a weasel and emptied it before starting over again. I don't remember how the plywood box got its name, but it stems from Berkley - the easygoing and popular geomagnetism member of our crew. (Richard Berkley bet that the shaft would not reach the hoped for depth, hence the name.âMel Oakes) The digging at the bottom was accomplished by using a regular pick ax to break out the firn and then a shovel to fill the 'Berk'. The space at the bottom was restricted to the 2x2m cross section of the pit, so there was not much 'elbow room'. But we managed. At least we were out of the cold winds! I recall we typically worked in a t-shirts. Every now and then, we got a break, when we stopped so that Dick C. could complete his stratigraphic recordings.\" \"Near the bottom of the shaft, we dug a short horizontal 'stall' for the installation of dials, that we - or our successors - could measure deformation over time. This complemented a large polygon of ablation stakes on the surface, with S2 at one corner that measured horizontal strain rates.\" A 85 foot deep bore hole was later drilled at the bottom of the pit, reaching a total depth of 200 feet. On January 22nd, 1958 S2 was closed down for crew change-over at Wilkes after being continuously manned since April, producing along with the glaciological results, and an unbroken meteorological record for this period. Site-2 would be soon re-occupied by the 1958 crew, and studies would continue there for many years. Information about Site-2 from Gil Dewart's \"Journey to the Ice Age\" and correspondence with Olav Loken.)\n\nApril 9, 1957-Took five sets of declinations today and messed with the magnetograph meantimes. Will have a problem with the absolutes bldg heaters. Should be thermostated. Played Jim Powell in cribbage tourney after the movie and lost two straight. Winner will pick up 5 cases of beer.\n\n(In the bottom photo at right, we see Richard Berkley with his magnetometer.)\n\n(Reference to Dick's work in \"Operation Deep Freeze III, 1957-58.\"\n\n\"At the station on Vincennes Bay the scientists were well ahead of schedule. Dick Berkley had completed adjusting his recording magnetometer; his âhouse of mirrors\" was now complete after weeks of carpentry, wiring, tile-laying, sun and star shooting; the maze ultimately provided a continuous record of changes in direction and strength of the earth's magnetic field.\n\nAt Wilkes magnetic north was almost due west which made for some confusionâparticularly in bridge.\")\n\n\"A status report to the NAS on May 11, 1957, stated:\n\n\"Geomagnetism - The geomagnetic building leaks have been eliminated and the tunnel weather proofed. The buildings had to be rewired after moving all the switch boxes into the tunnel. All the heaters have been installed.The DC power supply and the geomagnetic recorders have been installed in the office, and all the cables have been strung to the variation building.The magnetograph installation is awaiting the completion of a fire alarm and the result of efforts to eliminate wind-driven snow from entering the building. A report of May 2 noted that the standard magnetograph was operating on a test basis and the rapid run magnetograph was being installed. Recent high winds have lifted the roof from the walls, destroying the light tight quality of the building.\"\n\nThe report also included a description of Site 2. \"(Satellite Station, S12) - A relative movement study has been set up at the Ice Cap S-2 Station, 50 miles south of Wilkes Station, covering an area of approximately nine square miles. Tunnels have been constructed in preparation for a deep pit to be dug at the site in May. Snow crystal replica studies have been carried out at this site as well as at the main station.Snow sampling equipment has also been assembled and was in operation April 1. It was reported on April 14 that a trip was completed to S-2 with 20 drums of fuel being delivered. The trail en route was marked with empty drums. It is hoped that a ten-day field operation can be conducted to the site, beginning May 6. Surface meteorological observations will be conducted at S-2 during the completion of studies of the glaciological deep pit.\"\n\nApril 10, 1957-Another pretty day altho only 8 above. Ran a series of declinations. Avg of two days was 82 Â° 50.45' This discrepancy of about 3Â° from the chart makes me wonder about my buildings. Carl upheld the honor of IGY by being only cribbiger to survive the first round. Started a temp test on magnetograph to also check for a good level at which to run thermostats.\n\nApril 17, 1957-Today we put down the std mag. with Plaster of Paris. Found that temp light trouble was with pendulum clock. Talked til about 0130 about comm situation in light of Dickey's orders, etc. It is an inescapable mess.\n\nApril 18, 1957-A real blizzard todayâgusts up to 95 1/2 mph. Tried to make it out to the buildings this a.m., but nearly got lost so gave up. Made it in the afternoon. Nearly died out tonite. (Assume he means the blizzard.) Freezing rain after the movie. Certainly need better clothing and also snow goggles.\n\nApril 21, 1957-Carl talked to today on our homemade Navy radio and found a good reception to the pole party idea. (Was yesterday) Today we whipped out message. Also had an Easter service. (Albert P. Crary, shown at right, was Chief Scientist for US Antarctic Research.)\n\nApril 22, 1957-Today the message went to Crary and Washington outlining our polar plans. Now will see what happens. Installation going forward slowly. Another storm tonite after a quiet 5\" snowfall. Should get some huge drifts out of this.\n\n(Here are their proposed traverse polar plans (NAS Report).\n\nWILKES STATION GLACIOLOGICAL TRAVERSE October, November, 1957 A traverse, approximately 500 miles in length, has been proposed by Eklund. The party will proceed due South from Station 2 (66Â°27.7' S, 112Â° 17' E) 141.75 statute miles to 68Â° 30' S. From this inland point, the route continues in a northwesterly direction to Mt. Long, elevation 6,500 feet. The distance from the inland station to Mt. Long is 119 miles From Mt. Long the party will return to an established fuel cache, 67Â° 12' S,112Â° 17' E, thence to Wilkes Station via Station 2 or Vanderford Glacier. Elevations encountered are expected to range from the low elevations near Wilkes Station to more than 9000 feet at 68Â° 30'S, the inland point 192 trail miles from the coast. Traverse work will include snow pit studies with emphasis on density, stratigraphy, and temperature, Raysonde tests between pits are expected to connect pit stratigraphy. Ten meter bore holes will be made, along with meteorological and snow surface observations. At Mt. Long, bedrock and glacial geology will be studied. The return via the Vanderford Glacier is dependent on travel problems associated with such terrain. Equipment will include two weasels, two one-ton sleds, and one dog teamwith boat sle!s. The party will presumably include four or five men (Berkley was hoping to be of these.), all IGY personnel at Wilkes Station. Rations are to be supplied from stocks existing at Wilkes Station. Support of the inland operations will be effected by the establishment of a fuel cache 103 miles from Wilkes Station. In order to make a two-vehicle trip from that point to 68Â° 30'S and return to the cache at least seven 55-gallon drums of gasoline will have to be supplied to the cache prior to the October traverse departure. An additional three drums must be cached in order to return the party and their vehicles to Wilkes Station. Eklund has indicated that the caching plan is possible and that all equipment for the proposed traverse is on hand. Highly desirable would be an aerial reconnaissance of the Mt. Long -Vanderford Glacier area. Crevassed terrain hazardous to vehicles may prohibit safe travel near these points. The feasibility of the proposed route could also be best determined by air reconnaissance.)\n\nApril 23, 1957-Another frustrating day with the variometer (The vertical-intensity variometer is an instrument tha indicates visually or by photographic registration the variations in the vertical component of the intensity B, of the earth's magnetic field. The essentials of the instrument are:\n\n(a) A permanent. magnet (or pair of magnets) equipped with a quartz (or equivalent) knife edge near its center of gravity, 9. balancing poise for adjustment of the In etic axis to the horizontal, and a sensitivity poise for adjustment 0 the scale value;\n\n(b) A nonmagnetic housing with suitable agate or quartz supports so arranged that the magnet may oscillate in a vertica plane;\n\n(c) An optical system suitable for visual observations or photographic registration; _\n\n(d) Copper boxes or chambers surrounding the ends of the magnet system to provide magnetic damping and\n\n(e) A temperture compensation device. Richard as expected had trouble with temperature variations affecting the variometer. Below is a let from the Coast and Geordetic Survery division chief following his return.)\n\nThe snow last nite helped walking somewhat by covering the ice coast. The winds have cleared all of the ice out of the bay again.\n\nApril 24, 1957-Another blizzard today. An all day affairâwinds to about 50 the vestibule is almost completely snowed in. Capt Ketchum and his \"no drifting.\" And the doors open out! Will have to build some tunneling now. Fortunately my buildings are still open, but by tomorrow the galley door will be the only one out of these 4 buildings here. Above freezing this a.m. (Navy Captain Gerald L. Ketchum, From 14 January to 27 February 1957, he assumed command of a task group of three ships and established a base on the Knox Coast under extremely adverse ice conditions. For his service in these operations, Ketchum received the Legion of Merit.)\n\nApril 27, 1957-A very big day today. We got a Ross sealâfirst ever taken by an American land base. It was on a floe out in our cove. Rudy and Alan shot him and then Rudy took a line out and tied him on and we tugged him in. Carl was very thrilled after contacting Chile today, his cup running over. With old Methusalem. (Rudy was Rudolf A. Honkala, meteorologist. He was Dick's roommate. His parents had immigrated from Finland in 1904 and his father worked in the copper mines on Michigans upper peninsula. Many Finns worked these mines. The family later moved to Salisbury, NH to work in the granite quarries. Rudi's mother was a cook. Rudi and his two brothers were born there, he in 1924. Rudi did not finish high school. He attended law school for a year but he had a family so could not afford to continue. He later earned a masters at U. of Montana in geography. He served in WWII but was discharged due to rheumatic fever. He returned to the University of New Hampshire, however it took a year of intense exercise to recover his health. He eventually, with help from the GI Bill, graduated from the University of New Hampshire. He and his future wife, Barbara Hastings, worked at a weather station on Mount Washington. They married in 1950. The Weather Bureau was looking for man and wife team to run a weather station in Gamble, Alaska, about 175 miles from Nome on St. Lawrence Island. They applied and were accepted. When their family expanded his wife could not work so only one salary, so after two years, they moved back to New Hampshire to run a sporting goods store. He applied to participate in the IGY in Antarctica. He was accepted and made the difficult decision to leave his wife and four children, oldest five and youngest one month. He left with his wife's blessing; she understood the uniqueness of this opportunity. His wife, was from Bethel, New Hampshire. Rudy spent three tours in the Antarctica, in addition to 1957â58 at Wilkes he was chief weather observer with the Australians at Wilkes Station (now Casey) 1959-61, and again as scientist-in-charge at Palmer Station, 1966-68.\n\nMay 3, 1957-Went out with Rudy this afternoon to work the dogs a bit. Tried Kageluck as lead, but he just threw around and started a fight. Went to get a seal, but were too late. Doc had already gotten oneâa Weddell pup. Lost cribbage matches to Carl, Frenchy & Pat this evening. I must be lucky at love. (Kageluck, mixed breed dog- \"large wolf-like animal\")Â\n\nMay 4, 1957-Finished laying out the RR today & the components are ready to cement in place. Magee worked on the roof and put tarp over the cracks on top of walls. Was down to zero today and a new low for us. Played cribbage with Doc & lost, hitting the bottom. (Doc was Dr. Sheldon W. Grinnell, Navy medical officer, Grinnell Island is named for him. He is shown at right.)\n\nMay 5, 1957-Made contact with Jim Shea at Cape Hallett today. Sounded just the same. Finished my black box and installed it this afternoon. Also put up a shelf in the abs. bldg. Carl talked to Siple (Paul Siple) whoâs looking forward to seeing us. Said that itâs a much safer trip than to McMurdo.\n\nMay 11, 1957-Dick Berkley had no entry for this date, however Bob Long provided a writeup of events that began that day and are referred to in Dick's entries below. Dick Cameron, Gil Dewart and Bob Long left in Weasel to Vanderford Glacier to track how fast the glacier was moving. Bob's writeup follows:\n\nIntroduction: I graduated from Dartmouth College in 1956 and spent the next year doing ionosphere and cosmic ray research in Antarctica as part of the International Geophysical Year program. I was a civilian scientist, employed by the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology). I was stationed at Wilkes Station, on the coast of Antarctica south of Australia. We arrived by Navy ship at the site for the base on January 31, 1957. The base was built with supplies carried on the ships that brought us. It was formally commissioned on February 16, 1957. Nine other civilians and thirteen Navy men spent the rest of the year there, leaving on January 29, 1958. Following is the story of my most memorable experience that year. The text is transcribed from my journal with some editorial changes and annotations.\n\nWilkes Station, Antarctica, May 19 (late fall in the Southern hemisphere) by Bob Long\n\nYesterday, Dick Cameron (glaciologist and trip leader), Gil Dewart (geologist), and I returned from our trip to the Vanderford Glacier, eight days after we started on what was supposed to be a three or four day trip.\n\nWhy did we go to the glacier? We went to measure how fast the glacier was moving. This is done by placing bamboo stakes in the ice and measuring their positions aver time with a transit from a site on bed rock to see how far they move. The answer? Feet per day - I don’t remember the actual amount. We traveled in a Weasel, an enclosed tracked vehicle of WWII vintage, smaller than the SnoCats used at ski areas. It pulled a sled containing our tents, provisions, fuel, and surveying equipment.\n\nWe left about 10 a.m. on May 11 in a gentle snowstorm and camped the first night on the icecap about 18 miles out. We pitched two tents, Dick in one and Gil and I in the other. The tents were called Blanchard seal-tight tents, two-man tents made of Everest cloth that cost about $200 apiece. They are quite nice except for a gap in the ventilation flap in the roof, which lets snow blow in, and are pitched easily and quickly.\n\nThe next morning the weather was clearer and the temperature was â17ÂºF. Since the visibility had been bad the day before, we had navigated by keeping our Weasel at about 1500 feet elevation, by means of an altimeter. That morning, Dick, who had been to the Glacier with others early in March to first plant the movement stakes, decided it was time to start going down to lower elevation. We soon saw the Haupt Nunatak, our destination, which lies about one mile east of the edge of the glacier. (A nunatak is a bedrock outcrop that sticks up through the ice sheet.)\n\nÂ When we started to draw near the nunatak that afternoon, we got into a region of blowing snow. Although it was possible to see clear sky overhead, ground visibility was only about thirty feet. We camped for the night when Dick thought we had driven close to the nunatak. Dick slept in the Weasel and we pitched only one tent, due to the bad weather.\n\nThe morning of the third day was clear and sunny, temperature -16ÂºF. We found that we had camped about three-quarters of a mile past the nunatak, headed right for the dangerous Vanderford Glacier, when we stopped the night before! So we set the tent on the sled and drove back to the nunatak to start the survey about 10 a.m. If we had made an earlier start, Dick and Gil might have been able to sight more stakes but eleven sights were made before it got too dark.\n\nI acted as cook and clean-up person that day while Gil and Dick worked. We used only one tent again that night, with all three of us in it for warmth. (Dick had not slept well in the Weasel the previous night.)\n\nThat night, the wind began again. In the morning, visibility was 30 feet, the temperature was -18ÂºF, and the wind about 20 mph. I was able to start the Weasel engine in spite of about one-half inch of snow that had blown over the engine. We kept the engine running (and the heater operating part of the time) all day to charge the battery, making sure we’d be able to return to the base O.K. Because of the storm, we spent the daylight hours in the Weasel. (I think we must have had some reading materials to pass the time.) We had a daily schedule of radio contact with the base at 5 p.m., after which we finished supper and went to bed early. (We averaged about 12 hours of sleep per night on the trip.)\n\nThe next day, the fifth day, the storm continued, in spite of fairly clear sky overhead. The wind was stronger and the temperature was -14ÂºF in the morning. We stayed in our sleeping bags in the cramped tent until about 11:30 a.m. We were unable to start the Weasel that morning as snow had about filled the engine compartment and the battery probably wasn’t charged up very well and it was cold. So we spent an anxious day trying to get it started by shoveling snow around the sides of the Weasel to keep out while we tried to dig out the engine. Snow on the sides helped retain the heat generated by our Primus stove inside the Weasel. Fortunately we had brought plenty of fuel for it and we kept it running most of the day. We didn’t want to try the Weasel heater so as to save the battery.\n\nSince we had no luck starting the Weasel, Dick called for help (May Day!) when we talked to the base at 5 o’clock. We were assured that they would start in the morning for us. John Molholm, another one of the civilian scientists, would go along as guide, since he had been there on the first trip.\n\nWe cut down our food consumption even more (we had been on two meals a day), in case the rescuers didn’t make it right away. We turned into our sleeping bags, which were getting more frozen up daily due to body moisture during the night, hopeful of a warm meal the next night.\n\nThursday, day six, was a beautiful day so Dick decided we should go out on the glacier to replace some of the stakes he’d been unable to sight earlier in the week. We spent quite a pleasant four hours out there in spite of the -20ÂºF temperature (it was -24ÂºF that morning). There was no wind, fortunately. We got back to the nunatak about 2 p.m. and I was somewhat tired but warm.\n\nWe had been looking for the rescue team all afternoon and thought we sighted their Weasel about 1 p.m. but didn’t see it later. When we listened on our radio schedule at 5 p.m., we learned that the rescue party had turned back because they were unable to find the nunatak. This was bad news, of course, especially since our battery was too weak for us to transmit. A warm west wind had come up and the moon was behind thin clouds of ice crystals, which portended another storm soon. We were low on food, eating half of our remaining food each day. But we heard them say they would try again the next day so we went to bed hopeful again.\n\nFriday morning the temperature was -10ÂºF and the visibility was good with little wind, although the sky was overcast. I slept badly the night before. Claustrophobia and gasoline fumes from a leaky jerry can that we used to hold down one corner of our tent drove me out of bed at 8:30. Dick and I got out the hand generator for the radio and got it working. With Gil and I taking turns cranking and Dick operating, we established contact again at 11 o’clock. We found out to our great dismay that the trail party had already turned back again due to poor visibility. They had already driven into one crevasse too. But Dick told them the visibility was good where we were so they decided to come on to us. We told them we would light a signal fire with oil and gasoline at noon and get in touch again at 12:30. Dick and our scientific leader, Carl Eklund, made plans to us to walk out along the coast the next day if the rescuers didn’t arrive. Carl was to meet us with food and dry clothing with the dog team.\n\nWorking the generator for the 12:30 contact wore me out quite badly but at least the rescuers were still coming. They hadn’t seen our fire, which was quite ineffective because a slight wind wouldn’t let the smoke rise.\n\nWe set about making preparations to walk out that afternoon, constructing a travois out of bamboo poles and rope to carry a tent and sleeping bags. We had only one rucksack. Lack of food made us all tired, however. I was worried; would I have the strength to make the trip? Could we do it safely?\n\nAt 3 p.m. Dick took his turn at cranking the generator while I operated the radio. Lo and behold, they said they could see the nunatak and turned on their headlights to see if we could see them. I was able to see them quite plainly! It really looked good. I was reminded of some lines from Romeo and Juliet: “But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet the sun.” We started packing our gear and digging out the Weasel. The temperature had risen to about 0Âº by then so it was quite pleasant outside.\n\nThe rescuers, John and Lt. Don Burnett, the base commander, arrived soon, just at twilight. We had some stew, cocoa and sandwiches to revive us. We tried unsuccessfully to get our Weasel started by towing it with the other one. The engine just wouldn’t turn over. So we parked the two Weasels side by side and began melting the snow in ours by using warm air from the heater in the other one. We replaced the batteries with new ones they had brought and were eventually able to start our engine. The fan wouldn’t turn even with the snow melted away.\n\nDon called our mechanic at the base and got instructions on how to tighten the fan belt, which we did and then everything worked fine. We even finally got our heater melted free of snow and operating again so things were in good shape.\n\nWe left the nunatak about 9 p.m. and started back with the aid of a three-quarter moon. On the way, our Weasel led and the other one followed with our sled, since Dick felt the clutch on ours was poor. We had one close call when we unknowingly broke through a five-foot wide crevasse, which the guys in the following Weasel fortunately noticed in time to avoid it. There was some confusion as to which of the several tracks we should follow back but we finally pulled into camp at 5:45 a.m. The mileage on the return was 38 miles, 10 miles more than on the way out.\n\nThe cause of our misadventure was bad weather. However, sufficient equipment and preparation would have made the need for quick rescue less necessary. We had plenty of space in the sled for more food and emergency rations if we had only known how long the trip could be. Maybe an auxiliary heater for the Weasel and/or an extra set of batteries would have made rescue unnecessary. The Weasel itself, however, is not satisfactory for such a trip since, among other things, it’s not weather tight.\n\nYesterday, after five hours sleep in the morning, and today I’ve been gobbling food madly. I lost flesh in my face but not much weight. I got a little frostbite on my chin and on one of my fingers. We were lucky that nothing more serious happened; it was a close call.\n\nMay 15, 1957-This was quite a day. Spent morning putting a compass in Weasel. (vehicle). After lunch, Carl, Doc, & John started toward Shirley Island. They got about 100 yds before breaking thru 11â of ice. John got out abandoning it, but it floated. About 8 tries before it finally came out. Made a contact with Walter Sullivan who wondered about Pole trip when Cameron came on air with âEmergency.â We left Walter hanging to hear Dick. Weasel wouldnât start. Had two days food & wanted rescue at Haupt. In the middle Rudy came on and covered signal. A real mess. Finally got back to Sullivan & talked an hour or so with him. Carl told him that he, Fred and I were going to Site 2 on Monday so may have to go now. Saw a paraselene at night which was tremendous. (A moon dog, moondog, or mock moon, (scientific nameÂ paraselene, plural paraselenae, meaning \"beside the moon\" is a relatively rare bright circular spot on a lunar halo caused by the refraction of moonlight by hexagonal-plate-shaped ice crystals in cirrus or cirrostratus clouds.) Photo at right shows a pair of paraselene over Didcot, England.\n\nFurther description of the ice breakthrough (NAS). \"An unscheduled amphibious operation was conducted with one of the base weasels when a preliminary sortie on to the ice resulted in the vehicle breaking through. Although the ten inches of ice through which the weasel dropped was over the six inch recommended minimum the combination of the facts that the ice was new and that the wind action tended to weaken it apparently meant more than the actual thickness. Eklund, Lt. Grinell and Molholm quickly abandoned their floating weasel with Moihoim taking a waist level dunking in the process. A D-4 tractor and a coil of heavy rope were brought to the water's edge and a line was run from the tractor to the weasel. With Bousquet and Patterson at the tractor and McIntyre, Green and Wonsey out at the weasel, Magee directed the operation from an intermediate point. The weasel came further out with each attempt as planks and fuel drums were used to direct the pulling force upward to lift the weasel clear off the ice. When Wonsey disengaged the engine so that the tracks could turn freely the weasel finally came up on top of the ice and was dragged ashore. The weasel is operating again remarkably unharmed by the dunking.\"\n\nMay 16, 1957-More fiascos today. Don and John went down to Vandiford party, but couldnât find Haupt Nunatak. Cameron didnât come on the air so assume they didnât take their hand crank generator. As a result the boys came back empty-handed & will try again tomorrow. Earl set out after lunch with the dogsâafter ruining two Weasels he decided to stick to them. He dropped an item & when he went back the dogs took off. Went to Beull Island (about 4 1/2 mi.) non-stop, then stopped & had a hell of a fight. Kageluck finally bit off too much & was killed. The dogs walked back toward Carl dragging him in the traces. Carl broke the whip chastising them. Wonder what his Midas touch will get next? ( Pat Patterson commented on the dogs, \"We had a team of Huskies with us. One a female, only takes one, was supposed clipped to ensure no pups. Never guess, our doctor turned his surgery into a maternity ward. There was one pup that lived. The huskies were evil though, take your arm off if they had a chance.\")\n\nMay 17, 1957-After turning back once John & Don nearly made it to the Nunatak. They had dropped one track in a crevasse and were losing visibility. However, the trail gang came on the radio & talked them back down. Got back about 6:30 on the 18th. Pole had -114 degrees.\n\nMay 18, 1957-Uneventful day more or less. Talked with Jack Townshend and got a lot of poop for the observatory. Very good patch for an hour or so. Wind kicked up tonite.\n\n(Note: John B. \"Jack\" Townshend (1927â2012) was a geophysicist. Here is a quote from: Eos, Vol. 93, No. 50, 11 December 2012 \"In the late 1940s, the growing responsibilities of the Geomagnetism Program began to exceed the physical capacities of the Cheltenham Observatory. In 1953, the U.S. Congress appropriated funds for the construction of a new observatory and Program headquarters. A site near Fredericksburg, Va., was selected. Jack supervised the design of the observatory, and he managed its construction. The new Fredericksburg Magnetic Observatory was completed in 1956. As part of International Geophysical Year that soon followed, 1957â1958, Jack trained numerous domes and foreign observatory workers, and he supervised the calibration of their magnetometers\" Dick's comment refers to a radio patch to Jack back in the States to discuss his magnetometers. Dick trained in Fredericksburg obviously under Jack. More about Jack here. John B. \"Jack\" Townshend.\n\nMay 19, 1957-Thirty knot winds with peak gust about 47. Did a little hamming. Wind died after supper and was quite nice. Temp today about 15-20 degrees.\n\nMay 20, 1957-Started on magnetic moments today. Hope to have gotten all of them. Tonite found a beetleâvery nondescriptâin the absolute bldg (Dick's lab. Only recently heated. It was believed that the beetle came to Antarctic in some of Dick's equipment. Still a question is what was it eating all this time and why didn't the cold kill it). The Antarctic does have insects. Heard that the NY Times had carried a story on the pole trip. Tomorrow is my day to âhamâ. Hope I can get a patch or two.\n\nMay 21,1957-How frustrating. Got 4 patches for other guys, but nothing for me. Not a whisper from Florida.\n\nMay 26, 1957-Tonight the first real manifestation of friction. Fred got socked in the nose as he stood beefing at Danny behind the counter in the chow line. It will probably cost his rate and was very unfortunate. Hear now that the ships will be in on 1 Feb & will fly from first port.\n\nMay 27, 1957-A beautiful morning with new wind. However, much snow blowing up from the cape. By afternoon it hit and we had gusts in the 70s, but no snow. About 5:30 the snow started blowing and really was a mess. Most of the ice has blown out now.\n\nMay 28, 1957-A very strange day. Fairly light winds in the morning picking up to 50 knots by noon. Hit 82 knots during the afternoon and then died around 19:00. Went to the science building with no coat & the winds started again. Made a break for the movies during which much lumber flew while we hit 87 knots or 100 mph. Ran back in shirt sleeves. Within a hour it was almost dead calm. A most amazing phenom. Pressure jumps and away she goes. All of the ice beyond the point went out today.\n\nJuly 14, 1957-Went out in afternoon to Weasel that Rudy & Mac had towed in. Still canât figure how they were lucky to find their way in with no lights and a fog. (Mac is shown at right.)\n\nJuly 15, 1957-Great blizzard today. Winds abound 60 knots with peak at 79. Carl & Doc tried to bring the pup in but didnât make it so Bill and I went out in the afternoon. It was terrible but we managed. Roped up & took a radio along in evening when Duane went out with me to change records. Had to go thru garage window with the dogs & to make the movie as the rec deck door was completely drifted in. Aurora tower was shifted slightly but held.\n\nJuly 16, 1957-Woke up a couple of times & finally got up about 09:30 with a sore shoulderâprobably bursitis. Couple of ham schedules in the a.m., but the down______ on the rhombic (antenna) had come loose, so no hamming. Processed 4 days records instead. In afternoon had a chance to talk with Floyd in Honolulu. Storm quit about midnite last nite. Quite a lot of sea ice goneâa mile or so of it left nowâabout 30+ inches thick.\n\nJuly 17, 1957-Finally got through to Winter Park with an excellent patch. Ended rather abruptly, though. Ed and I were surprised when Mother said Goodbye and hung up. Scaled several records & cleaned out the std Z vanometer which has been a pain. Have an alert on now. Deep pit at 16.7 meters today.\n\nJuly 18, 1957-Had some fairly strong southerly winds today that moved the loose snow around. Burned out some wiring when I took down the program machine to work on it. Itâs still fouling up. Caught up on scaling today.\n\nJuly 25, 1957-In spite of good intentions, I've dropped several days. I took psychological test today. Wind started about 1400 and blew until about 2000. The gentle snow should amount to about 6 inches or more. George put in the shelves in the head last nite so now we've each got a slot for our toilet gear.\n\nJuly 26, 1957-Another momentous day, perhaps. Repâd a message that there were tentative plans for a traverse to McMurdo Sound in â58-â59. (They had originally proposed a traverse to the South Pole, however the powers in Washington offered the alternative traverse.) Gil is slated to lead the party. Think Iâll volunteer to stay if I can get on that traverse. It would rather complete my polar education. Hate the thought of being gone another year, though, but itâs a chance I fear I canât pass up.\n\nJuly 27, 1957-Tonite Cameron (Richard \"Dick\") and Mollholm (John ) got on the list of volunteers. Carl upset that they didnât personally tell him, but passed the word thru us. Hope to talk with Crary soon so we can get a message off.\n\nJuly 28, 1957-Had a talk with Crary this afternoon and he seemed agreeable to the entire traverse proposal. Thought magnetic work would also be an asset. Sounds as if weâd be replaced here in any event and be just that many extra people. Now to get the word to Washington and see what the reaction is.\n\nJuly 29, 1957-Message went out today with our views on traverse and recommending us as personnel. Hope it does the trick although Iâm not too crazy about another year here. It will be a mess in the States, too, collecting all my stored gear.\n\nJuly 30, 1957-Spent the day on the ham gear, but with little results. Did talk with Jay Birbly and Jack Couffer, though. Jackâs stuck here to be theatrical while the âpenguin-liftâ is going on TV. Missed W4LZ so hope tomorrow will be the day. (Jack Couffer A.S.C. [born December 7, 1924 in Upland, California] is an American cinematographer, film and television director, and author. Couffer has specialized in documentary films, often involving nature and animal cinematography. Couffer was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography for his work on the film version of the novel Jonathan Livingston Seagull (1974)) (W4LZ was ham operator.)\n\nJuly 31, 1957-The halfway pointâmaybe six gone & six mons. to go. Talked with the Morgans (Sister's family) today & hope to keep a regular schedule with the Eau Gallie Station (Eau Gallie is a section of the city of Melbourne, Florida, located on the city's northern side. Dick's family lived near there.). Took the last of the psycho test today. Ed Blevins up today but not good enough to call Winter Park. (Ed Blevins was ham operator in Plant City, Florida.)\n\nAugust 4, 1957-Went over by Shirley Inlet this afternoon & I shot my first seal. What a big game hunter that takes. It was a young male yearling. Two more there which I photographed. Rudy & I were going, but Doc & Carl would go if we went on the ice. What a thing they have about the ice.\n\nAugust 11, 1957-Heard Capt. (William) âTriggerâ Hawkes talking with Dickey today & Navy will not support traverse so it looks like thatâs all she wrote. Iâd just as soon go home anyway. Cameron broke his glasses & thought there was glass in his eye so party left during movie last nite, but couldnât see so returned & started again this morning.\n\nAugust 14, 1957-A real blizzard today with avgs around 45-50 knots. Too rough to get around but had almost all my class there. (Dick was teaching a math class.) Really rough changing records these days.\n\nAugust 15, 1957-Still blowing again todayâperhaps not as bad, but seems worse when record changing time rolled around. Head still secured off & on but looking pretty good now. (Likely referring to recording head on instrument.)\n\nAugust 16, 1957-Took some pictures today of the stormâs aftermath. By afternoon after class the wind was going again, but not too bad. Died down later in the evening. Have some monstrous drifts now. Fred has a new bldg out towards inflation shack for RDF. (A radio direction finder (RDF) is a device for finding the direction, or bearing, to a radio source.)\n\nAugust 17, 1957-Ran absolutes this afternoon. John and Dick came in and do they need haircuts. I did our â6 mos & 1 day since the ships leftâ party. Talked to a Quincy station in p.m. Copied a patch with W4LZ in the morning, but not too good. Frenchie (Edward Bousquet, was responsible for drinking water at station.) got a tractor hung up by the garage in the a.m. (Explanation from Dennis Murphy, friend and ham operator. \"Have never heard of \"Quincy\" describing a station other than its location. Quincy MA, by the way, has had a formidable amateur radio club for years. Possibly the reference is to a club station?)\n\nW4LZ was owned at the time by George Edward Blevins \"ED\" (1895â1981). He lived on Williams Road, Plant City, FL. Ed was an electrical engineer with Tampa Electric Company. He was 59 at the time and married to Dorothy Crosby Blevins. They had a daughter, Celita (Varn). He served in WWI.\n\n(From Operation Deep Freeze III 1957 - 1958, Task Force 43: On March 20, 1957. Radioman Don Bradford pulled his mike close and spoke, \"CQ KC4USK!\" In the crowded little radio shack, every man held his breath,Through tho faint crackle of static the answer came- \"KC4-USK . . . K6FCYl\" One big grin spread over the whole group. The hams had done it again. Wilkes had called and March Air Force Base ham shack in Riverside, CA had answered.\n\nHardly a day passed that someone at Wilkes did not call home. Fred Charlton's long hours installing the equipment paid off in soaring morale, Before winter set in, nearly all of the (then) 48 States had been contacted as well as foreign countries. The station's IGY leader held the long-distance record, reaching his family in Chile via Minneapolis and involving four stations and phone patch. the voices traveling about 15.000 miles to and fro. But the best CQ of all was Dick Cameronâs DX to his wife in Germany soon after birth of their son.)\n\n(Pat Patterson commented on communications, \"As you will be aware, we had Navy radio communications and also ham radio. The highlight of the day was your turn on the radio. KC4USK calling, and we had plenty of traffic. I spoke to my parents about every other week through a third party in Charleston,S.C. Fortunately for them, my calls came in at 0200 in the morning, and the ham operator contacted them by telephone. We had a very strange ham signal one day. Our transmitter was a Collins 1000 watt and we used the Navy antennae system to transmit. The signal was beamed directly to Washington, D.C. However, in this particular case, the signal went straight over amend (sp) we had a young Spanish girl on the radio. Unfortunately, she didn't speak English. We had a Navajo Indian with us who was also the radioman, got him out of bed and he spoke to her. Difficult to believe but she was only transmitting on 20 watts. We had lots of enjoyment with the ham radio.\")\n\nAugust 18, 1957-Went skiing today for the first time and it was nearly fatal. Mac, Noonan, Doc, Curley, Syd & I were the victims of Rob & Don. Mac must have gotten some good movies!\n\nAugust 19, 1957-We had our first donuts this afternoon. Molholm had the first taste of this delicacy in his life! Tried this evening to talk with Tallahassee, but no one at home. Evidently the Lanes have moved. (He is referring to Rod Lane, who became a Professor of Continuing Education at Florida Atlantic University. They were friends in Tallahassee.)\n\nAugust 20, 1957-Hailstorms 21st birthday today so a party in the evening. Party was to leave for Cape Poinsett but 50-60 knot wind all day put that off. Cameron got a shave & haircut & is unrecognizable. We are rather hoping there will be no traverse! Started geometry in our class today.\n\nAugust 21, 1957-Rudy shaved today saving only an Earp-Crary âmournful mustache.â Snow and fog again prevented the trail party from leaving. Vonsey got the spirit and shaved. Frenchie trimmed his beard.\n\nAugust 22, 1957-Again a trace of snow so no trail days. Carl & Gil went out to brand a seal & while they were at it the dogs came back to camp. Weâre saved on the McMurdo transverse! The AF says no C124s available for air support so home we go! Weâre all ready. Finished a roll of film today on the dog fiasco.\n\nAugust 23, 1957-Had a good blow early this a.m., but turned off beautifully. Trail party left about 11:00. Talked with Crary and he thought there was still a chance for traverse. Winds came up again after lunch & gave peak of 66 in afternoon. Trail party laid up about 6-1/2 miles out and then headed back arriving about 17:00. Carl immediately went to ham & and on the way back to chow fell down drift by Jamesway hurting his knee. Winds stayed high âtil after midnite.\n\nAugust 24, 1957-About 6â of snow on ground this a.m. accumulated after the wind died. More falling. Carl canât bend his knee now so guess theyâd give up on the Poinsett trip. Thatâs the only thing that will save âthe ill-fatedâ Northern Party.â Finished a roll of Kodachrome yesterday.\n\nAugust 25, 1957-Wind blowing this morning so stayed in the galley all day while it howled. Played the first bridge here in the afternoon. Syd Green had wanted to ham. Got a copy of a message Crary sent to IGY telling them we couldnât stay if the traverse was off. Wind still about 40-45 knots at nite, but little snow blowing. (Crary in fact later lead a traverse party to the pole.)\n\nAugust 26, 1957-Wind down to about 20 at breakfast, but up again soon after to 30+ knots. No ice left off the point. It was a good thing the trail party was holed up close enough to come back. Otherwise, they might have floated out to sea or been trapped on an island. Luck rather than judgment saved them.\n\nAugust 27, 1957-Ham day today. Got 4 patches for them. Didnât do a thing for myself. Very disgusting. Another day of winds in the 40+s and temperature hit +31 degrees. What a place this is. Talked with USAble & learned that Leo Davis was not staying over.\n\nAugust 28, 1957-Woke me at 10:15 with a patch to Winter Park. Very good to get into that area. Passed along the word on the traverse. Hope that things donât change again. Finished our first math course in 2-1/2 weeks. Now for the algebra.\n\nAugust 29, 1957-Trail party was to leave for Site 2 this a.m. but there was a little snow flying. Olaf has been up there by himself for two weeks so imagine heâll be glad to see someone.\n\nSeptember 9, 1957- Winds up to 96 mph this day. Not too bad by evening, but still a chore to go out to the magnetic buildings.\n\nSeptember 10, 1957- Another stormy day. Made contact with an Orlando ham operator today so maybe able to talk with the folks more easily now. Temp up to about +31Â° this morning.\n\nSeptember 11, 1957- Ham day & a very good one. Long talk with Winter Park and had patches with John McGrew (Iowa Friend) & Jim Myers. A lot of fun. Wind still up 25-30 knots during most of day. A tractor threw a track & the snow melter engine went out of commission to foul things up pretty badly.\n\nSeptember 12, 1957- Went over the hill in the afternoon to see what might be a Ross seal which Pokey (dog) had cornered. Was our first Crabeater. Also saw our first Emperor penguin & tried a couple of pictures of him. Also a number of sunsets, etc.\n\nSeptember 13, 1957- The boys got the snow melter functioning again. The cooling fins had been broken off the flywheel so after grinding them clear off they rigged a blower up to do the job and away it went. Had several days records to run thru as a result of storms & breakdowns.\n\nSeptember 14, 1957- Another nice day. However the magnetic storm which hit yesterday morning was probably still disturbing things so let the absolutes go. Both magnetically & weatherize this has been a very stormy month thus far.\n\nSeptember 15, 1957- Our man-haulers & a trail party for S-2 set out this morning. Gil & Ralph going in the best British tradition & Carl, Paul, & Olav to S-2 to return the repaired generator and take some movies of the activities up there. Storm started in late afternoon, but S-2 party arrived safely after making last 6 miles in storm. Ran absolutes this afternoon.\n\nSeptember 16, 1957- Still storming today. Will keep Gil & Ralph pretty well pinned down so Iâll have to change those miserable seisms records again. Scaling and record changing are the activities these days. (At right is a modern photo of Ralph Glasgal, auroral physicist. He is on the left in the photo.)\n\nSeptember 17, 1957- Another blizzard day today. Wind stayed up all day, but the blowing snow pretty well quit by noon. Had a contact with Hallett, L. A. & the Pole in the evening. The Pole was about 115 degrees colder than us with L. A. 65Â° and Hallett 45 degrees. (L. A. is Little America. Cape Hallett is a snow-free area (Antarctic oasis) on the northern tip of the Hallett Peninsula on the Ross Sea coast of Victoria Land, East Antarctica. The cape was the location of a joint scientific base, Hallett Station, between the United States and New Zealand during the International Geophysical Year of 1957.)\n\nSeptember 18, 1957- Still no sign of the missing party. Don and Bob covered Bailey this afternoon after the wind died, but with no success. Little chance of anything wrong, but theyâre 2 days overdue from a two day trip. Talked to Larry Silverton toniteâone wayâ& set up a sched for Saturday nite.\n\nSeptember 19, 1957-This morning Rudy, Don, Fred, Mac, Doc, & Bob went out to look for the missing pair. Covered Bailey, much of Mitchell with discouraging results. Finally at about 1400 they saw them upon the ramp & brought them in. Also found a couple of Russian cans with a note dated 8 November 1956. Gil will try to translate it. A beautiful day with temp. 5-10 above. The Pole had -102.1Â° last nite.\n\nSeptember 21, 1957-Talked a little with Larry A. this evening but the band was very bad. Finally faded out completely.\n\nSeptember 24, 1957-Ran absolutes today. Storm had subsided somewhat. Carl & Don went out to survey, but the wind was a bit too strong so they came back in. Blowing about 20 knots. Mageeâs wife says the newsletters talk of our being home by Christmas.\n\nSeptember 25, 1957-Ham day today. Good contact with Winter Park after talking with Elizabeth Wester in C. R. (Cedar Rapids, Iowa) Heard about the mess in Little Rock & the federal troops moving in. Talked with Ron after class & then nothing but message traffic. Blowing about 30 knots today. (Elizabeth Wester Born April 19, 1928, in Marshalltown, Iowa, to Reuben Axel and Gertrude Theoren (Hazen) Wester, she graduated from Marshalltown High School in 1946, attended Wellesley College (B.A., 1950) and University of Iowa (M.A., 1955), and studied in Vienna, Austria as a Fulbright scholar. A lifelong music educator and performer, she taught strings at public schools in Austin, Minn., Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Madison, conducting the La Follette High School Orchestra.)\n\nSeptember 26, 1957-Olav, Bob & Ralph set out for Haupt today. Olav was a little leery of making the trip but was prevailed upon. Got down there in good time. Wind started blowing in late evening so theyâd be hard pressed to do any work. More âhome by Xmasâ reports. Wonsey (Duane J. Wonsey) heard his mother had been committed to Mich. mental hospital. today. Very rough with two younger children & a father they donât want to live with. (Wonsey Rock is a small rock north of Cameron Island in the Swain Islands. This region was photographed by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump (1946â47), ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) (1956), and the Soviet expedition (1956). It was included in a 1957 survey of the islands north of Wilkes Station by C.R. Eklund. He named the rock for construction mechanic Duane J. Wonsey, U.S. Navy, of the Wilkes Station party, 1957. Wonsey is show at right fueling building heaters.)\n\nSeptember 27, 1957-Wind without snow all day today. Makes the outdoor work rather difficult but it hasnât been too strong. Mostly just bothersome.\n\nSeptember 28, 1957-A steady blow today. Took a number of shots out in the wind this morn & copied the scroll Rudy made to finish a roll of film. Wind died in the afternoon long enough for water? To be made, but picked up again before supper. Still no snow to speak of, but around 53 knot wind.\n\nSeptember 29, 1957-The wind died at about 0500 & it dawned a nice warm (26Â°) day. Started absolutes pm, but was too messy? Wind came up again about 1500 and away we went. Started blowing anew at nite. Heard the boys at Haupt had a tent blow away. Snow here was finding lots of new cracks. Some of the boys painting rooms todayâpink & blue.\n\nSeptember 30, 1957-Set a new record of 91 knots at about 0500 this morning. Had to use the vent in power house for door. Gave the duty in the head this week. Such a business.\n\nOctober 1, 1957- Started on hourly averages for diurnal curves & sitrep (Situation Reports) . A real pain & much back work to do. Fortunately the Z has held fairly well, but could be better.\n\nOctober 2, 1957- Working records today to get out the sitereps averages. Values similar to last mo. Talked with the folks in the morning luckily as Iâll probably be gone for my schedule. Carl talks with âTommyâ in afternoon & asked about Arnebâs return itinerary.\n\nOctober 3, 1957- Stamped records in the morning & cleaned head. After school, went down to the point for a bunch of photos of camp. Also caught Rudy with normal incidence pyroheliometer. Some photos with each camera. Beautiful sunshine today. Tommy came thru again & now the question around camp is âWill you go to So. Africa and So. America or go straight home?â\n\nOctober 4-Beautiful dayâabout +7Â° F. Photoed perihelion and false sun this a.m. Catching up with records to get ready for Site 2 trip. Did my first developing & printing job today.\n\nOctober 5, 1957- Ran absolutes in the afternoon to get that job done before having to take down the gear for hauling up to Site Two.\n\nOctober 6, 1957- Warm beautiful day today. Packed magnetometer up & got the duffle bag packed. Hope we get several more good days, but have my doubts. Tried to get in touch with Sally today but with no luck. Sat in on a 3-1/2 hr shift of satellite monitoring in evening.\n\nOctober 8, 1957- After waiting to see if the weather would change, Rudy & I got off at about 1030. Started to close in at Site One & another seven miles from us unable to see with light drift, so turned back at about 1400. After an hour or so we ran out of the drift & had perfect visibility the rest of the way. Snowing in the evening so glad we turned back. Temp about +19Â°F.\n\nOctober 9, 1957- Hard to get up this morning. Tired from yesterday's ride. Blowing snow so no chance of travel today. Some of the boys talked with Conger at OSV (Offshore Support Vehicle). Says Uncle Gerald will be our task group commander again & riding the Arnab for the long cruise.\n\nOctober 7, 1957- Snowing blowing a little this morning. Not much chance of leaving today. Much wind on the cap & high gusts here. Just as well. Got chronometer corked & the rest of the equipment ready for the trip. Much snow drifted last nite so door of science bldg is finally snow up about 1 foot.\n\nOctober 10, 1957- Wind of 40 knots with gusts to 65 or so. Temp about 25Â°. Was able to keep ham seeds & passed word along to Koeler, Helsey, Longley & Burke in addition to talking with folks & Jim Myers. Secured about 2200 after a 12 hr day of it.\n\nOctober 11, 1957- Steady 40 knot east wind today. Not too much blowing snow but still no good for travel. Had asked with ABQ, but no luck. Carl went hog wild & wanted us to shovel out science bldg. Got word of text of GRC Xmas cards. Horrible!\n\nOctober 12, 1957- Wind let up around noon & Rudy talked as if he wanted to travel, but Stan not about to. Very nice til middle of afternoon when wind started again, this time with blowing snow and kept up all evening and most of nite. Glad we werenât on the trail.\n\nOctober 13, 1957- A beautiful day today so Rudy & I got away at about 1300. Made it to the sled by sundown about 27 miles in by 1900 but after picking up 2 diesel barrels it went slow & surface atrocious. Some blowing snow & almost no trail visible. Did much backtracking and finally arrived about 0300. After eating, etc. got to bed about 0600. Lost a mitten at sled & doors wouldnât close so we were really cold.\n\nOctober 14, 1957- Slept until afternoon todayâa beautiful warm day around 0Â°F to -10Â°. Rudy & I started snow house while Dick & John went visiting accumulation stakes. Went down in pit at about 2300 to photograph while they pulled last core. Pit is about 115 ft deep & final core is 27 meters. Proved to be glacier ice with density of 0.90. Finished about 0200 & then up for supper. Just about froze my hands climbing out.\n\nOctober 15, 1957- Up rather late this a.m. Finished our snow house but too late to run abs. Perfect weather. Set up for azimuths at nite and stayed up with them until 0230. Temp -22Â°F. Then supper & to bed. What an upside down schedule weâve been living.\n\nOctober 16, 1957- Ran a set of abs this afternoon but could get no declination for dip. Took instr inside & it functioned OK. With no level & a breeze, though, doesnât work too well outside.\n\nOctober 17, 1957- Low ground drift today. Went out in afternoon to run absolutes, but the wind (about 18 mph) made Z impossible & the declination seemed to be shifting badly so finally packed everything for the return trip. Had some fine chicken fricassee for supper.\n\nOctober 18, 1957- Rudy woke us up at about 0640 & Johnâs been like a bear with a sore paw. A beautiful dayâjust rite for work, but must use it for travel & not take a chance. Helped John pull up drill testing & nearly brained him with 1st load. After finishing Ekta (chrome) roll & starting Koda (chrome) left about 1400. About half way by 1930 & home by 2330. Heard about ordersâBrad & Noonan to shipsâand about Gilâs & Macâs âsatelliteâ of last Sunday nite. John found mitten at sled.\n\nOctober 19, 1957- Slept âtil nearly noon today. Talked with Sally at lunch time. Unpacked & then developed & printed the 120 pictures. Not so hot. Carl, Don, Fred, Shel & Ralph\n\nup near Folger on mapping foray. Beautiful warm day. Wish weâd stayed another day at S-2.\n\nOctober 20, 1957- A beautiful Sunday. Temp up at 30Â° with no wind. Most of the boys out hiking. Tried some more picture printing today & offered the photo of Rudy to Johnâs overhead. Had no reaction from him, though, by lights out. (Not sure what this is about, maybe \"overhead\" meant above his bunk.)\n\nOctober 21, 1957- Spent the day on carpenter work. Built shelves in room and rearranged things a little. Really a thing of beauty now. Another beautiful day with temp pushing above 30Â°. Carl, Gil, Brad & Noonan out seal hunting. Got 22 of them. No reaction from John yet.\n\nNovember 22, 1957- Shot some sunsets today & then stayed up until about 0100 & caught a sunrise.\n\nNovember 23, 1957- Finished a roll of film today with shots of a couple of skuas. Another beautiful day.\n\nNovember 24, 1957- In late this morning. Got a dandy message from IGY to mail all photos. Heard tonite that our extra net man is going to Weddell. Ronne evidently sold them a bill of goods about mgrs of scientific leaderâs job. Start a roll of filmânumber nineâwith a fine sunset at about 2130. (Finn Ronne, photo at right, In the 1950s, the Navy organized Operation Deepfreeze to complete the mapping of Antarctica and establish centers for scientific research. Ronne became the scientific and military leader for a U.S. Weddell Sea base.)\n\nNovember 25, 1957- Today we let the emperor (penguin) out of his prison quite a bit the worse for wear. Got many photos before taking out to killing box. Took 2-1/2â3 min to finish him off. Weighed in at 65 pounds. Too bad he didnât look better, but the lab looked worse.\n\nGoing back via Sydney, Perth, Capetown, Buenos Aires, Santos & Martinique according to captain of Arneb whom Carl talked with today.\n\nNovember 26, 1957- Ham day today. Started a patch home, but fell apart. Hope it will get finished in a few days. Big sunspot observed in States yesterday so radio will probably be in poor shape for a while.\n\nBeetle (Carl \"Beetle\" Bailey, weather officer) sick in bed with strep throat so only two students today.\n\nNovember 27, 1957- The snow is melting down at quite a rate now, but donât think all will be gone when ships arrive. Tâwill be messy, though. Volleyball again this evening with some new converts; Garth & Gil and Rudy.\n\nNovember 28, 1957- Thanksgiving & a beautiful day. A fine meal, turkey & ham with all trimmings & 3 kinds of pie. Scaled records today & got in some bridge in afternoon. Some of boys skiing while Carl went skua chasing.\n\nNovember 29, 1957- Was sitting in science bldg this afternoon about 15:25 when we became sure of a humongous sound was an aircraft. Ran out to see a DC-3 type flying low over point having passed over camp. Waited for it to circle but headed on west. Obvious lost & evidently Russian. Quite an event needless to say. Talked with Barb (Dick's sister) this morning.\n\nNovember 30, 1957- Group went out toward Poinsett today & made better than halfway along the coast stopping at Baloena Islands. Beautiful day, ran absolutes from about 2100-2330 tonite.\n\nDecember 1, 1957- Sobering up days. Heard today that HMS Shackleton is possibly sinking near South Orkney. (In 1957, Shackleton struck an iceberg off the South Orkney Islands and was nearly lost. Temporary repairs allowed the Shackleton to reach South Georgia, more than 600 miles from the accident, while all unnecessary passengers and crew were rescued by HMS Protector.) Worked on scaling, averages and absolutes today. Have quite a pond by the science bldg & shot it tonite. Must be about 27 degrees, but unfrozen.\n\nJan. 23, 1958- Copter in the afternoon from Atka (USS Atka, one of the US Navyâs âwind classâ icebreakers.. Made several trips bringing Amory H. \"Bud\" Waite, James K. \"Jim\" Sparkman Jr. , George Raybin and Richard Lee \"Dick\" Chappell plus groceries, movies, etc.\n\n(Note: Amory \"Bud\" Waite was a radio operator during the Second Byrd Antarctic Expedition, Waite gained national recognition as one of the three men who rescued Admiral Richard E. Byrd from the Bolling Advanced Base during the Antarctic winter of 1934. James K. \"Jim\" Sparkman was a geophysicist from U. of Wisconsin who did gravity measurements. Sparkman was based at McMurdo Station and carried out his program almost literally by hitchhiking on aircraft going both far and near. It is estimated that during the season he flew more than 34,000 miles within the Antarctic area.) As a nineteen year old Eagle Scout from Eggertsville, N. Y., Richard Lee Chappell was chosen from the many Boy Scouts who applied. He was selected by a committee representing the US National Committee for the International Geophysical Year and the Boy Scouts of America to serve with the scientists of the IGY program during the long winter night and summer of 1957-58 in the icebound wastes of the Antarctic continent. His duties were many and varied, ranging from housekeeping underground to assistance in important scientific research. He captured and banded skua gulls in a study of their migratory habits and his assignments included glaciological observations, studies of the aurora and work with the IGY Weather Central. Above all, there was the unique experience of daily life in a beautiful and hostile land where the sun sets in April and is not seen again until August. Richard Lee \"Dick\" Chappell wrote a book Antarctica Scout about his stay in Antarctica. He became a professor of biology at Hunter College.\n\nComment from Professor Richard L.Chappell, September 28, 2018 :\n\n\"My visit to Wilkes Station on my way back to the States after spending a year at Little America V as the Boy Scout representing the Boy Scouts of America during the International Geophysical Year meant a great deal to me. Â While training for the trip in Washington, DC, I had been asked by Dr. Carl Eklund, Station Scientific Leader at Wilkes Station that year, to band skua gulls in the area of Little America V on the Ross Ice Shelf using his unique blue plastic bands (in addition to numbered metal bands commonly used on birds) so that their movements around the continent and elsewhere could be seen by observation without needing to recapture them. Â Consequently, being welcomed by Dr. Eklund and others at Wilkes who had wintered over, like Dick Berkley, was an experience I treasured. Although I did not have much time to get to know everyone there, they made me feel welcomed and even treated me to a dog sled ride to visit penguins nearby. I was interested to see the similarities of how Dick Berkley was inspired by this experience to go on in nuclear physics and become a Professor of Physics and my own career. Â After spending several years in the nuclear power program under VAdm. Rickover, I went on to receive a PhD in Biophysics and conduct research in retinal neurophysiology at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA as well as helping to establish a graduate program in Physiology and Neuroscience at the City University of New York where I taught and conducted research at Hunter College during the academic year.\"\n\nPhoto at right: Dog team at Wilkes Station (aurora tower in background) enjoying an Antarctic summer day during the International Geophysical Year.Â This is the way we found them patiently awaiting our return after they had given us a ride to visit the penguins nearby.Â -- Dick Chappell\n\nJanuary 25, 1958,-Hornet dropped anchor in bay at 1205 today.\n\nJanuary 28, 1958- Transfer of Jerry Donovan this evening.\n\nJanuary 29, 1958- Reported aboard Hornet about 1500 today.\n\nJanuary 30, 1958- Underway at 1418 today.\n\nFebruary 8, 1958- Entered Sydney harbor this morning & tied up at 1249 at fitting out wharf, Garden Island.\n\nFebruary 10, 1958- Ship moved to fuel dock Garden Island today.

(Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions, ANARE office was based at Victoria Barracks in St Kilda Road, Melbourne. Geoff Payne, the current webmaster of the ANARE Club, generously provided the following comments.\" (1) As you have presumably seen on our home pageÂ ANAREÂ stands for \"Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions\" It was the name of the Government Department responsible forÂ Australia's work in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic from its inception in 1947. It originally operated from an address in the city, but later was at Victoria Barracks in St Kilda Road, Melbourne and it was there it was there that Richard J. Berkley showed his slides although there are various other institutions that he may have visited. ANARE has since been renamed theÂ Australian Antarctic Division (abbreviatedÂ AAD) and operates from Hobart, Tasmania with a website atÂ http://www.antarctica.gov.au/Â with a summary of its work and purpose atÂ http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-us. The address in St Kilda Road now has no connection with the Antarctic.Â (2) TheÂ ANARE ClubÂ is broadly the non-profit social club which maintains contact between past and present expeditioners and organizers, among other things, the annual mid-winter dinners in each state. The Club decided to retain the name ANARE. It's history is at http://www.anareclub.org/web/history.php. We have links to other sites atÂ http://www.anareclub.org/web/links.phpÂ and we would be interested in the contents of Richard J Berkley's diary and could place a link to it.\")Â\n\nMarch 6, 1958-An evening of rest. At ANARE during the day. Had the âmannequinâ for book fair display & made much fun with it. (The\" mannequin\" is likely the stuffed penguin that Dick brought home as a souvenir of his trip. He and his wife, Sue, referred to them as \"the children\" She tells of the day he came home and she ask him to sit down, \"There is a problem with the childern. Moths have invaded it. She said Dick was quite upset, as he had hope to bring them to a reunion of the Wilkes group. )\n\nMarch 7, 1958-Saw Harry Barkerâs slides of Macquarie Island at ANARE.
