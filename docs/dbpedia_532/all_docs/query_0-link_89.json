        "text": "ABBOTT, Susan (Richardson)\n\nThe Brunswick Journal; Monday 18 January 1909\n\nSUDDEN DEATH OF OLD SERVANTâFor Many Years a Faithful Servant in Family of Judge Crovatt.\n\nThere will be genuine sorrow expressed by a very large number of white people when they learn of the death of âMammy Sue,â who has been faithful servant in the family of Judge A.J. Crovatt for the past thirty years.\n\nEverybody knew âMammy Sueâ; she had been so identified with the family of âher peopleâ as to be one of them.\n\nBorn in Charleston, a slave, Susan Abbot [sic], as she was known, was brought to St. Simons Island and was the servant of the Hazzard family there. At the close of the war, Susan became a member of the family of Col. C.L. Schlatter, the father of Mrs. A.J. Crovatt. After the marriage of Miss Mary Lee Schlatter to Mr. A.J. Crovatt, âMammy Sueâ went with her young mistress and was the nurse of three children of Judge and Mrs. Crovatt. As the widow of a soldier in the Federal Army during the war, Mammy Sue was awarded a pension by the government. Though her husband fought on the Federal side, Mammy Sue staid [sic] with her âown people.â\n\nFamous as a cook, devoted to the interests of those with whom she had been so many years, the death of Mammy Sue removes another of the rare ante-bellum negroes.\n\nHer illness was of only a few hours duration; the young daughter of the house, Mary Lee Crovatt, had gone to see the old woman at ten oâclock to giver her a cup of tea; Mammy did not complain of being ill, and had been about her usual duties all day yesterday. Though eighty years of age, Mammy Sue was remarkably active, and was in full control of all her faculties. At one oâclock another of the servants heard the old woman calling, and Miss Crovatt and her brother went to the room in the servantsââ house. When the door was opened, Mammy Sue was unconscious and died with(in) a few minutes. Four children survive, Thomas and Joseph Abbot and Eliza Cuyler, all of whom live on St. Simons. Another son, Randolph Abbot, being in Charleston. The body will be carried to St. Simons where it will be interred tomorrow.\n\nThe Brunswick Journal; Tuesday 19 January 1909; pg. 1\n\nFUNERAL OF MAMMY SUE HELD ON ST.

Friends and neighbors had streamed in and out of Heritage Inn on St. Simons Island, all day long Sunday to visit âMiss Lucilleâ Armstrong.\n\nNow she sat quietly in her chair amid her memories awaiting the next visitor who would kiss her light brown cheek and tell her how good she looked.\n\nAlthough she spends some time in a wheelchair because of arthritis in her right knee, her skin is as soft as a babyâs and her smile is as sweet as ever.\n\nHer may visitors came to wish her a happy birthday and to feel the positive vibrations Mrs. Armstrong radiates. Alert and attentive with a droll sense of humor, she does pretty well with names except when the younger generation shows up looking exactly like the first.\n\nâThereâs always a smile in there,â said a young woman in her early 20âs, indication Mrs. Armstrongâs room. âYou want to come to see her because sheâs so sweet.â\n\nShe had come by not only to wish Mrs. Armstrong many happy returns of the day, but also to congratulate her on being honored by her church at the celebration of its history.\n\nShe has been a member for 83 years and is the oldest member of the 129-year-old First African Baptist, Brunswickâs oldest black church. Church members presented her with an engraved plaque in appreciation for her years of service to the church in a special ceremony Sunday.\n\nâSheâs sweet. It feels good to be around her,â said Jackie Traeye, who has known Mrs. Armstrong all her life. âShe has always been a positive influence on many people and especially to the children of the church.\n\nâI remember when I was a child, Mrs. Armstrong would listen to our Sunday School recitations. She would nod her head as we recited and if we faltered, that head would just nod more emphatically, as if she could pull us through it.\n\nâShe was always so kind to us and she has been an inspiration to a great many people. Itâs people like her that are the reason our church has been so strong and lasted so long.â\n\nMrs. Armstrong was born Jan. 5, 1890, on Amherst Street in Brunswick. An only child, her family moved to Washington D.C., where her father, Joseph Ruffin, worked in the U.S. Treasury Department. Her mother died when she was 8-years-old.\n\nâFrom then on my father just took over and he always took care of me,â she said. âHe was a good man, they donât make them like that anymore.â\n\nHer great-aunt, who lived in Brunswick in a big two-story house across the street from Hallâs Funeral Home on Gloucester Street, asked that she be allowed to come and live with her.\n\nAs a young girl, she often traveled on the train from Washington to Brunswick and remembers the trips as a gentler time when train travel was less hectic and more luxurious with lots of porters. âIt was smooth riding. I loved to ride the train,â she said.\n\nHer school teacher in Brunswick was Miss Ida Jones, who also played the organ in the church. In Washington, she attended school through the eighth grade.\n\nShe was in her teens in Frist Africanâs church choir when the choir sailed to Jekyll Island on the Emmeline or Hessie to sing for the millionaires. She remembers being introduced to the Rockefellers, Carnegies and Vanderbilts at the Jekyll Island Club. âThey made us so welcome and we enjoyed the trip so much,â she said.\n\nShe and her late husband, Henry Armstrong, reared their three children here. A homemaker, she said she never had to work out of her home very much. Once she was a sitter for five years with an elderly person in Washington.\n\nAnd she did a lot of church work. âI used to bake, you know,â an understatement for the hundreds of cakes sheâs made over the years for church socials and fund-raisers.\n\nHer son, Everett, calls her twice a week from his home in New York, and she often hears from her daughter, Lottie, who lives in St. Maryâs nursing home in California. Her eldest child, Henry Armstrong, Jr. of Jekyll Island, who is 81 and a deacon in the church, visits her every week. She has five grandchildren and said she knows âmost everybody.â\n\nMrs. Armstrong said she has never used alcohol or tobacco but she does have one weakness. âI love to eat sweets,â she said with a grin. âYou see that box of candy there? Dr. Inmanâs wife brings me a box of candy every time she goes on a trip.â The W.O. Inmans were neighbors of hers when she lived on Jekyll Island with her son.\n\nWhy does she think sheâs lived so long? âJust the good Lordâs good to me, thatâs all. All of them say âIâll never live to be that old.â I tell them, thatâyou donât know. Because I never thought Iâd live to be this age, either.â\n\nShe said she is enjoying her life at Heritage and that her health is good, âso far as I know,â she quipped.\n\nThe Brunswick News; Thursday 14 May 1992; pg. 3 col. 5\n\nFUNERAL FRIDAY FOR MRS.

Heart trouble is supposed to have been the cause of death. Bailey was about thirty-five years old and lived with Alex Hardison, also colored, at 1109 1-2 Albany street. The two men ate a lunch about three oâclock Tuesday afternoon, but no supper, according to Hardisonâs story. They were watching the children playing about 7:30 oâclock Tuesday night when Bailey got up, stating that he did not feel very well. He went to his room and a moment later Hardison says he heard him gasping for breath. He rushed to the room and found Bailey lying across the bed, gasping once or twice. An examination showed that he was dead. He said nothing after going to his room. The body was removed to the undertaking establishment of John Byrd, colored, on the same street. It was prepared for burial and sent to Baileyâs old home at Darien yesterday. Bailey was well known among the longshoreman and was intending to return to work on the Rio Grandeâs cargo this morning.\n\nBAILEY, Jesse\n\n15 July 1982; Camden County Tribune\n\nresearched\n\nby Sue Saffold for The Crypt website\n\nCARETAKER BAILEY DROWNS ON CUMBERLAND ISLAND\n\nOne of Cumberland Island's residents, described by friends as a man who never had an enemy in his life, drowned Saturday while apparently attempting to return his boat to shore in Christmas Creek.\n\nJesse Bailey, 63, who had lived on Cumberland for most of his life, was well known to visitors and residents of the island.\n\nHe was frequently seen piloting his small motorboat along the shoreline or in the waters of Christmas Creek in search of fish and shellfish.\n\nMr. Bailey was reported missing to the National Park Service when he went to retrieve his boat after the noon meal Saturday and did not return.\n\n\"Bailey had gone out for oysters in the morning on Christmas Creek around the Williams' residence. The creek level on the mud flat was so low that he couldn't get his boat back in.\n\nAfter lunch he went back for the boat and apparently drowned,\" said Deputy Ricky Sirmon of the Camden County Sheriff's Department.\n\nMr. Bailey's big black poodle Bushy alerted islanders to his master's disappearance when he showed up barking on the porch of George and Audra Merrow, also caretakers on the Candler estate.\n\nBushy would not calm down, but continued to bark, so Merrow took the dog to the creek where Bushy showed Merrow the place Mr. Bailey had entered the creek.\n\nThe body of the missing man was discovered about 9:40 a.m. Sunday following a search by officials of the Sheriff's Department, Department of Natural Resources and Cumberland Island Park Service, said Sirmon. Island residents Larry Miller and Carol Ruckdeschel found the body on an oyster bed.\n\nFollowing the transfer of the body to the mainland, the cause of death was determined to be as the result of accidental drowning, said Gil Kelley, deputy county coroner.\n\n\"He was a colorful person and he will be missed,\" said Grover Henderson, of the man he described as his friend and the friend of everyone who met him.\n\nHenderson said that Mr. Bailey came to Cumberland Island in the 1930âs from Sapelo Island to help build the Candler House at High Point and stayed on as caretaker of the house.\n\n\"He knew everyone who lived on the island from the Rockefellers and Carnegies on down.\n\nJesse was one of the few people I've known that everyone liked. He never had an enemy and that's rare in the twentieth century,\" said Henderson.\n\nKnown to many on the island for his gifts of clams, oysters and fish to those he liked, Mr. Bailey would often barter his catch with the residents of the island, trading for the things which he needed or wanted.\n\n\"He knew more about fishing on Christmas Creek than any man on the island,\" said Henderson.\n\nA fishing trip with Mr. Bailey was described by the authors of Guale, the Golden Coast of Georgia, published in 1974.\n\nIn a profile of Mr. Bailey, his skillful search for shellfish and lifestyle were described: \"Jesse's real life is not lived in the society of men. His true home is not on land, but down in the salt marsh of Christmas Creek.\"\n\nBAILOR, Ned\n\nThe Brunswick Advertiser & Appeal; Saturday 19 December 1885 pg. 3 col. 1\n\nDEATH OF NED BAILORâVALUE OF CHARACTER IN THE HUMBLEST CITIZEN STRIKINGLY ILLUSTRATED\n\nOn the 16th of December Ned Bailor died; on the 17th he was buried. Who was Ned Bailor? A colored man of ripe old age, an [sic] humble worker, a member of the African Baptist church, of the colored Masonic and Benevolent societies; for years past a drayman on his own account, and engaged in this work when prostrated by his last illness.\n\nTruthful, hones, faithful, a leading singer in the church choir of his church, treasurer of benevolent societies organized among his people, he won and held the confidence of all, both white and black.\n\nDuring the war he was in the service with Mr. Wiggins, of Waynesville in the Fourth Georgia cavalry, acting as drummer. Since the organization of our military company he has been its drummer.\n\nAt his funeral the colored Masons turned out in force, the church was crowded with people, the Brunswick Riflemen marched to the colored cemetery from the church and buried him with military honors. A more striking tribute to true worth in the humblest station was never known than this.

Three more are beyond the power of earthly skill to save. Down Brunswickâs streets today the dead wagon moved rapidly, carrying the unfortunates to the graves that awaited them. Back and forth the wagon passed, and as one grave was filled another was dug beside it. The ministers, from early dawn, drove rapidly to the bedsides of their people; but their prayers could not save the lives they so anxiously watched passing away. As the breath left the body of one, a messenger stood at the door waiting to direct the ministers to another. They were powerless to save, and could only pray. Noble, self-sacrificing ministers, He above alone knows all the good work they have done today. As the newspaper men hurried fro house to house, getting a list of the dead and dying, they, at least, saw something of their labors. The ministers of Brunswick, known now throughout the land, can die, should it be ordered, with the consciousness that they labored through famine, pestilence and death for their peopleâs sake, and at the throne of God, when their time comes, none can doubt, who knows their work, the reward that will await them. In the golden book, the names of Thompson, Cook, Hennessey, Winn and Perry will shine with a light that cannot be dimmed, for their record is one of noble deeds. C.W.D.\n\nDYING RAPIDLYâThe Pestilence Breaks Its Previous Records at Brunswick\n\nBrunswick, Ga., October 21.âThere were officially reported today five deaths and forty-nine new cases, the record breaker of the epidemic. The dead on the list are: WhitesâBurr Winton, Herman Grundy, Alexander Pritchard and Mrs. Oberlauter.\n\nAt 9:30 oâclock tonight William C. Weed died. He was a victim of imprudent nursing. His nurse, through feeling for the man begging for food, like all yellow fever patients do, gave him, against the physicianâs orders, some nourishing food. He might have been saved had this not been done.\n\nThe new cases are: Whites, in Brunswick, 7; Hilda Poulsen, Bessie Firth, Samuel Silverstein, W.A. Line, Thomas Mulligan, F. McC. Brown and Mrs. Currie.\n\nWhites, on St. Simonâs, 3âThomas Lambright, Monroe Lambright and Mrs. Taylor, making the total new cases of whites 10.\n\nTo the official lists of deaths should be added one that occurred this afternoon, Lytton Hazelhurst, a negro boy on North Amherst street.\n\nBesides this a negro child, Pinkie Wilson, died and her death certificate, issued October 18th by Dr. Robert Hazelhurst, read: âCause of death, yellow fever; dead before physician reported her.â This death, although occurring three days ago, has never been reported.\n\nThis makes a total of seven yellow fever deaths that should be counted today. Two others are hourly expected to die, Ernest George and Adolph Lavine. There is no possible hope for them. Two other deaths occurred today, Essie Beckman, a negro child, and Mrs. Scranton, but neither from yellow fever.\n\nThe warm weather following the few days of rain and the cool spell has brought the disease rapidly to the front. There are now 258 under treatment, 60 white and 198 colored. The outlook is not cheering for twenty-five days yet. When the dread of famine seems to be disappearing and the people are breathing easier deaths roll up and the fever increases alarmingly.\n\nOne new case is reported at Jesup today, a son of R.W. Tindall, white.\n\nFour patients were discharged. Six are now under treatment.\n\nBELL, Laura Bessie (Harris)\n\nThe Brunswick News; Thursday 25 October 1945; pg. 8 col. 4\n\nMRS. LAURA H.

He became a ward of the city poor house.\n\nFrom slavery days in the ante-bellum days, âOld Wesleyâ never shunned his religion and his prayers.\n\nEarly yesterday the feeble darkey went about his daily routine in the poor house and about 8 oâclock in the morning kneeled by the side of his bed to offer prayers to his Maker.\n\nThere he was found a short time laterâhis head leaning on the bed, his arms outstretchedâkneeling where he uttered his final mortal words with Godâdead!\n\nHe died as he would have had itâon his knees praying to his Almighty.\n\nA Christian, but a pauper, the former slave will be given a decent, but simple burial in pauperâs field.\n\nBENNETT, Ruby Lee (Mrs.)\n\nThe Brunswick News; Friday 7 May 1982; pg. 3A col. 2\n\nSERVICES SATURDAY FOR MRS.

A more beautiful life has never lived. A pious, consistent christian, always ready to defend the church of God; a friend who never betrayed a trust; a loving mother, who tenderly watched over and prayed for her fatherless children. She was twice a widow, her first husband, Mr. James Carter, brother of Mr. H.B. Garnett, died leaving her with three small children, whom she carefully reared and today they are filing places of trust. Her second husband, Rev. J.C. Bryan, died several years ago, and left her with two little girls, who have been cared for and educated by their two brothers, William and James Carter, two of the most dutiful sons and brothers that ever lived. Their good deeds will ever be remembered, and their examples shining lights for others to follow. The funeral took place from the First Baptist Church. The pastor, Rev. John Williams, spoke in beautiful words to a vast audience; he was assisted by Rev. Ford of Bethel Church, Jacksonville, Fla., Rev. S. Roberts and Rev. Fisher. To mourn her loss are five children, Prof. W.M. Carter, President, Topeka N. and I. College, Topeka, Kans.; James G. Carter, Consular to Madagascar; Mrs. Maggie Carter Lewis, Misses Nita and Edna Bryan, two brothers, Mr. C.A. Clark, Mr. Wm. Clark, three sisters, Mrs. I.M. Jones, Mrs. Julia Robinson, Mrs. Ellie Moore, a devoted aunt, Mrs. Corine Delaney and many other relatives and friends. Death is sad! but theirs is [sic] comfort in the words of the poet:\n\nCome ye disconsolate, wherâer ye languish;\n\nCome to the mercy seat, fervently kneel,\n\nHere bring your wounded heart;\n\nThere tell your anguish,\n\nEarth has no sorrow,\n\nThat heaven cannot heal.\n\nA Friend.\n\nBRYANT, Eliza (Bernard)\n\nThe Brunswick News; Friday 10 February 1995; pg. 3A col. 6\n\nSERVICE SATURDAY FOR ELIZA B.
