A native of the Azores, Machado immigrated to the United States in the late 1840s and became a naturalized citizen in 1853. From his office at 153 Pearl Street in Manhattan, he engaged in legitimate and illegitimate trade with West Africa which was at its height from the late 1850s through 1861. On May 11, 1858, he claimed that he was owed compensation for injuries and losses when his ship, the Thomas Watson, was captured by the HMS Bloodhound off the coast of Africa. The charge was detaining a colored British subject with the view of selling him as a slave. Infamous for his involvement in the slave trade, Machado oversaw the outfitting of barques that brought slaves from Africa to Cuba. He, like others in the trade, used obscurity to fit ships, haul cargo and recruit crews as well as bribery of deputy marshals, assistant district attorneys and customs officers. Admiralty lawyers, whose offices were on Wall Street, became adept at handling cases of those who ran afoul of the laws banning the slave trade.\n\nIn April 1862, Secretary of State William Seward signed a pact with the British, the Lyons-Seward Treaty. By this pact, the United States and Britain policed each other’s trans-Atlantic shipping of slaves; it ultimately proved effective in ending the trans-Atlantic slave trade. One article in The New York Times reported that the schooner George J. Townsend, owned by an American citizen from Hempstead, New York, and chartered to Machado, was outfitted as a slave ship and bound for Gambia in Africa. The vessel, which was docked at Pier 48 on the East River, was taken into custody by Mr. Hillyer, the United States marshal.\n\nAs per another article in The New York Times on September 21, 1862, the United States Marshal had tried, unsuccessfully, to prove that Machado was the ringleader of a slave trade, and, although imprisoned, Machado was freed. The article goes on to report that the marshal had learned through an informer the whereabouts of Captain John Perkins of the barque Mary Francis, one of Machado’s slaveships. Perkins testified that he took command of the Mary Francis at Wilmington, North Carolina, in 1860, and together with Mrs. Mary Jane Watson, a paramour of Machado in whose name the business was handled, outfitted the vessel for its trip to Africa. Perkins was paid $5,000, with a $1,000 bonus for carrying out the voyage. Ultimately, that journey was successful and the ship returned to Cuba in the spring of 1861 with its cargo of slaves. Mrs. Watson, who traveled to Cadiz, Spain, was no longer alive, and the evidence was enough to re-arrest Machado who was heading for Cuba on the Columbia, a steamer. That arrest, together with the Seward-Lyons Treaty, and changes in public opinion helped break up the illegal slave-trading activities in New York City. He last lived at 438 Prospect Avenue in Brooklyn. He died of Bright’s disease. Section 23, lot 3987.\n\nMACHIN, CHARLES HENRY (1840-1912).

He was promoted to first lieutenant on June 1, 1864, and contracted an eye infection while the regiment was stationed near Petersburg, Virginia. From July 6 to 12, he was treated for debility at the Depot Hospital at Point Lookout, Maryland. From August 24 to 29, 1864, he was treated in the 10th Corps Hospital at Point of Rocks, Maryland, diagnosed with amourosis (sudden loss of vision).

He was transferred intra-regimentally to Company A on May 31, 1864.\n\nAlthough the 79th mustered out as a unit in May of 1864, those owing time, like Roderick Mackenzie, were allowed to return to New York on furlough. On June 11, 1864, he was admitted to Ladies Home General Hospital in New York City where exploratory surgery was performed because his wound did not heal properly. Although Mackenzie’s official muster out date was October 24, 1864, denoting three years of service, and the order for his muster out was signed by Dr. Alexander B. Mott (see), Mackenzie remained in the hospital until March 29, 1865. His muster roll for July 14, 1865, from Alexandria, Virginia, notes that he was discharged from the hospital for disability.

Given additional responsibilities on May 16, 1864, he was assigned to duty with Brigadier General G. W. C. Lee. Lee wrote, “…This assignment will add much to the comfort and efficiency of the troops for local defense, and will not, I think, interfere materially with Captain MacMurdo’s present duties….” On August 3, 1864, he was recommended for a promotion to quartermaster by General G. W. C. Lee, “…His promotion would place him upon an equal footing with other brigade quartermasters, as regards rank, and would be bestowed upon a meritorious officer….” That letter also noted that he rose through the ranks from the beginning of the War and that he fought at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg. In a letter written on January 16, 1865, Macmurdo wrote that 264 ambulances were manufactured in 1864, 25-30 days of manpower were lost to high water in addition to $3,000-4,000 worth of supplies including 5,500 spokes, 20 hubs, 6,500 feet of lumber, 30 gallons of oil, and 20 bins of coal. He suggested that the production continue at Richmond since there were supplies on hand for a year as well as forges in the blacksmith shop. On February 1, 1865, he was relieved of duty in charge of the Ambulance Shops and was assigned as a paymaster of the division. He took an oath of loyalty after his parole on April 24, 1865.\n\nIn 1870, the census showed him as living in Norfolk, Virginia.

We have no children or near relatives and my health is broken down completely with the care of him night and day in his enfeebled condition for many years. A large man that needed lifting and moving continually as he could not ly (sic) down for fear of suffocation, his doctor would tell you that I have been injured permanently by the lifting and am not fit for any labor. Hoping that you will mercifully grant this widow this request in my behalf that my age and condition calls for.\n\nShe was denied Edward Jr.’s pension because she was the step-mother and a widow’s pension because her husband’s length of service was too short.

On the morning of the 4th, my son Dan, who, you know is commissary sergeant, issued 350 rations, and on the 16th he issued only 158; so you may estimate by that how much our brigade and the Iron Second Army Corps have lost….” He was promoted to commissary sergeant on March 1, 1863, to first lieutenant in January 1865, and to captain on June 1, 1865.

He mustered out on June 6, 1864, at New York City.\n\nThe 1886 and 1890 New York City Directories list him as a detective. Several newspaper articles reported on Mahoney’s work as a detective. One, in the Brooklyn Standard Union, stated that Mahoney was employed by the Mechanics Bank and ferreted out an alleged swindle involving two men from fine families, one of whom was employed at the aforementioned bank. In an undated article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, it was reported that Mahoney, while a detective, slipped and fell on ice, landing on a fruit stand and hitting his head on a coconut. While he recovered, fellow detectives brought him such treats as calf’s foot jelly and canvasback duck.\n\nA piece on February 12, 1888, in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, noted that Mahoney attracted attention at a ball not with his dress or good looks but because he was carrying three large diamonds in his chest pocket that were large enough to pay the ransom of European royalty. On November 20, 1888, Mahoney recalled in the New York Herald his connections to the recently arrested “Jack the Ripper.” Mahoney remembered the man as a herb doctor who was always fashionably dressed in a hunting coat decorated with gold braid at his establishment on Washington Street near Fulton Street. Known as Dr. Blackburn, he was visited often by fashionable ladies. Mahoney also recalled seeing Blackburn during the Civil War in Washington, D.C. and Virginia and then in Brooklyn, always notable for his attire.\n\nAnother report, in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle on March 18, 1894, asked Mahoney to clear up his name and honor when it was reported that an artillery man of his name and physical description deserted in Ohio. In fact, two years earlier, the charge of desertion on his soldier records was overturned and marked as “erroneous.” Mahoney remained active in military affairs. On October 28, 1879, he mustered into Mansfield Post #35 of the G.A.R. As per an article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle on December 15, 1889, he belonged to the Moses F.

At the time of his pension application, he was 5′ 8¾” tall with brown eyes, brown hair and a light complexion. In 1895, Mahoney’s pension was increased to $6 because of varicose veins in right leg and loss of right foot; in 1900 his pension was increased to $10 because his disabilities were permanent.\n\nMahoney’s medical history was recorded as of December 5, 1899, when he was admitted to Brooklyn’s Methodist Episcopal Hospital after he was knocked out of his carriage by a trolley car. His leg was amputated four inches above his ankle. Records indicate that he was hospitalized for 60 days, getting out of bed on the ninth day of his hospitalization. The gangrenous line on his right leg was marked, the diseased skin sloughed off at gangrenous points periodically, and the affected area sprinkled with naphthalene powder daily. The pathologist reported that in addition to the amputation of his foot, Mahoney’s fibula was crushed, his tibia fractured, and the soft part of his leg infiltrated with foreign matter.\n\nAn article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle on May 7, 1903, indicates that “Colonel” Cornelius Mahoney led a delegation of 14th Regiment Veterans at Captain Eason’s funeral. In 1904, the Brooklyn Directory reports that he had a National Detective Agency at 567 Fulton Street. A marker next to his tombstone affirms his membership in Ulysses S. Grant Post #327 of the G.A.R. As per his obituary in the Brooklyn Standard Union, which confirms his Civil War service, he was a police detective with the Brooklyn Police Department who was forced to retire after an accident led to the amputation of his leg. Mahoney’s last residence was at 296 Sackett Street in Brooklyn. His death was caused by nephritis. Josephine de Garay Mahoney, his second wife, applied for an “accrued” pension in 1908 but there is no evidence that it was certified. Section 204, lot 30043.\n\nMAHONEY, DENNIS (1837-1897).

This report on that action was written by Major P. Jones Yorke, commanding the 2nd New Jersey and sent to General Robert F. Stockton, adjutant general of New Jersey:\n\nGENERAL: I have the honor to report that on the 30th of April a force under the command of Brigadier-General Sturgis left Memphis in pursuit of General Forrest.\n\nOn the 2nd of May we reached Somerville, Tenn., and halted. It being ascertained that a force of the enemy held the town of Bolivar, on the Hatchie River, a distance of 23 miles from Somerville, Colonel Kargé, commanding the First Cavalry Brigade, was sent forward with a force consisting of 200 of the Tenth Missouri Cavalry, 400 of the Second New Jersey Cavalry, and a section of guns belonging to the Tenth Missouri Cavalry. Starting at 1:30 p.m., we made a forced and very rapid march, and found the enemy, 800 strong, under command of Major-General Forrest, in position behind strong intrenchments and fortifications, about 1 mile from Bolivar. After a severe engagement of two hours’ duration we routed the enemy and drove them from their intrenchments and through the town, and but for the lateness of the hour (it being after 8 p.m.) and our utter ignorance of the country through which the enemy retreated, would have captured or destroyed the entire force.\n\nThe loss of our regiment in this action was 2 killed, 5 wounded, and 20 horses killed and wounded….\n\nI am happy to say that the Second New Jersey Cavalry enjoys the best reputation, and the esteem not only of the commanding general, but all the troops on this department….\n\nAfter being wounded, Malone was moved to the Ward U.S. General Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, and mustered out on June 11, 1865, at Newark.

The sights and sounds of the fighting were unnerving to the green troops but Bigelow gave the order, “Forward into line, left oblique! Trot! Action front.” The 9th had 110 men, six twelve pound Napoleons and 88 horses as they were ordered to shell Rose’s Farm and Woods. The battery’s historian commended the regiment in greatly aiding the Union men on Stony Hill in holding that place for as long as they did.
