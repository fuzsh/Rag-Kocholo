        "text": "FERRY, EDWARD (1814-1876). Private, 79th New York Infantry, Company C. According to the census of 1860, he was a laborer who was born in Ireland. After enlisting as a private at New York City on May 13, 1861, Ferry mustered into the 79th New York on May 28. His son, Andrew Ferry, was in the same regiment and company. Further details of his military service are not known. He applied for and was granted an invalid pension on April 29, 1863, certificate 96,881.\n\nAs per an article in the Jersey Journal of Jersey City, New Jersey, on May 30, 1876, Edward, though elderly and frail, had been forced, after Andrew’s death a month earlier, to take a job as a sweeper in the paint shops in the meadows to support himself and his wife. That article reports that he was killed on the Pennsylvania Railroad but gives no other information about his death. He last lived in Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn. In December 1876, Jane Ferry applied for and received a pension as the mother of Andrew, certificate 192,724. Section 15, lot 17263, grave 502.\n\nFERRY, J. (or JOHN) MILTON (1832-1889). Captain, 12th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company A. Born in Newburgh, New York, he enlisted as a second lieutenant at New York City on April 19, 1861, was commissioned in on May 2, promoted to first lieutenant on June 5, and mustered out after serving three months. A year later, when his regiment was re-activated for three months and part of the National Guard, he was commissioned as a captain on July 10, 1862, and mustered out on October 8 at New York City.\n\nFETTEROLF, ADAM H. (1841-1912). Corporal, 17th Pennsylvania Infantry, Company B; private, 34th Pennsylvania Infantry, Company C. Originally from Perkiomen, Pennsylvania, he descended from a Mennonite family. A superior student who attended the Freeland Seminary (later known as Ursinus College), he became a professor of mathematics there when he was twenty, an unusual accomplishment for someone so young. During the Civil War, Fetterolf enlisted as a corporal at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on September 17, 1862, immediately mustered into the 17th Pennsylvania for its three month activation, and mustered out at Harrisburg on September 28. On June 3, 1863, he re-enlisted as a private and mustered into Company C of the 34th Pennsylvania serving until he mustered out on August 24, 1863.\n\nAfter his military service, Fetterolf resumed his teaching career, first in the public schools, then as principal of the Freeland Seminary until it was purchased by Ursinus College. Subsequently, he was the principal of the Andalusia Hall School from 1870 through 1880 when he joined the faculty of Girard College in Philadelphia as its vice president. Two years later, he assumed the presidency of the school, prominent at the time for its charity and commitment to those in need. According to his obituary in The Philadelphia Inquirer, he retired from the presidency of Girard College in 1910 after being at its helm for twenty-eight years. His contributions to the school were recognized with honorary degrees from Lafayette College and other institutions.\n\nAfter hearing of Fetterolf’s retirement in 1910, his “boys” expressed their gratitude by thanking him for “…teaching us by his own day to day living, that which constitutes the highest type of Christian gentleman…” (The school, whose campus opened in 1848, was endowed by Stephen Girard, a wealthy Philadelphia banker who made his fortune there after humble French beginnings. Girard bequeathed two million dollars for the education of white, male, orphaned and under-privileged children aged six through ten to attend the boarding school from the early grades through high school. However, because Girard’s will specified admission to “white, male orphans,” court cases and controversy surrounded the school as a result of the Civil Rights Era. Eventually, African-American males were admitted in 1968, females in 1984.)\n\nAmong the many organizations to which Fetterolf belonged were the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, the American Academy of Political and Social Science, and the Art, City, Geographical and Contemporary Clubs. The Veterans Schedule of 1890 confirms his Civil War service. His last residence was 1936 Pine Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Fetterolf died of an intestinal obstruction. His second wife, Laura Mangam Fetterolf, who is interred with him, was the daughter of a wealthy New York merchant. Section 81, lot 18133.\n\nFEUERBACH, LAWRENCE (or LORENZ, LORENZO) (1825-1880). Sergeant, 66th New York Infantry, Company E. Of German origin, Feuerbach and his wife were listed on the manifest of the Ocean Queen which arrived in New York in July 1851. At that time, he was a shoemaker. On October 4, 1856, he became a naturalized citizen. During the Civil War, Feuerbach enlisted as a private at New York City on September 6, 1861, mustered into the 66th New York on November 4, and was promoted to sergeant on November 11 of that year. He was discharged for disability on November 14, 1863, at Convalescent Camp, Virginia.\n\nAs per the 1870 census and the 1876 New York City Directory, Feuerbach was a saloon-keeper; the 1880 census shows that Elizabeth Feuerbach, his widow, was running a beer lager saloon. His last residence was 18 Clinton Place in Brooklyn. His death was caused by meningitis. In 1890, Elizabeth Feuerbach, who is interred with him, applied for and was granted a widow’s pension, certificate 324,303. In addition, she confirmed her husband’s Civil War service on the Veterans Schedule of 1890. Section 156, lot 22355.\n\nFICHT, E. OTTO (1820-1901). Unknown rank, 7th Regiment, New York State National Guard. Ficht was born in Germany. According to his obituary in The New York Times, he was a veteran of the 7th New York State National Guard. A physician, he last lived at 104 So. Fullerton Avenue in Montclair, New Jersey. He died of chronic intestinal nephritis and heart failure. Section 121, lot 12566.\n\nFIELD, JAMES (1840-1884). Fife major, 11th New York Infantry, Companies H and A; chief musician, 4th Maryland Infantry. Of British origin, Field enlisted as a private at New York City on April 13, 1861, and mustered into Company H of the 11th New York, known also as the Ellsworth Zouaves. On May 7, he was transferred into Company A, fought at Bull Run, Virginia, on July 21, was promoted to fife major on August 1, and was discharged at New York City on July 2, 1862, when his unit was disbanded. He re-enlisted at Baltimore, Maryland, as a musician on September 13, 1862, and mustered into the 4th Maryland where he served for two years and eight months. During that period he saw action as part of the Army of the Potomac at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia (July 6, 1863); and in Virginia at the following battles: Wilderness (May 5-7, 1863); Spotsylvania Court House (May 8-21, 1863); Totopotomoy (May 27-31, 1864); North Anna (May 22-26); Weldon Railroad (June 23-24, 1864); the Siege of Petersburg (June 15-April 2, 1865); and Hatchers Run (February 5-7, 1865). Field was promoted to chief musician on February 28, 1864, and mustered out on May 31, 1865, at New York City. He was a member of Henry M. Lee Post #21 of the G.A.R. Typhoid fever was the cause of his death. Section 14, lot 4969, grave 293.\n\nFIELD, MAUNSELL BRADHURST (1822-1875). Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. Born in New York City, his grandfather, Samuel Osgood, was the first Postmaster General of the United States in the administration of George Washington. A graduate of Yale in 1841, he began practicing law six years later and was associated with the firm of John Jay. At the onset of the Civil War, he became deputy sub-treasurer of the United States and subsequently became Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, a position he held until 1865. In 1864, Samuel Chase sought to appoint Field the assistant United States Treasurer in New York but the nomination was blocked by Senator Edwin Morgan who appealed to President Abraham Lincoln to select another New Yorker. Ultimately, Chase’s letter of resignation over this matter was accepted.\n\nAfter Field returned to New York, he was collector of internal revenue, then returned to the practice of law and was appointed judge in 1873. In addition to his legal career, he earned a reputation as a writer after penning Memories of Many Men and Some Women, an anecdotal recollection of distinguished Americans he had met in his life and including an account of Lincoln’s death. In the aforementioned account, he wrote about his reaction to hearing that Lincoln was shot, his efforts to assist Mrs. Lincoln after he rushed to the house where she was keeping watch, his despondency after seeing the slain President, and his inability to concentrate, do his job, or even write an article for newspapers about what he had seen and experienced. Part of his account of Lincoln’s death focused on the President’s appeal to the common man:\n\nPerhaps the most affecting incident connected with this drama occurred an hour later. Mr. Lincoln’s body, enclosed in a plain wooden box, around which was wrapped an American flag, was borne from the house by six private soldiers; then placed in an ordinary hearse, behind which the soldiers marched like mourners; and so carried to the Executive Mansion. As the cortege passed along, it attracted but little attention, for but few persons knew what burden was being carried past their doors. It was fitting that this great man of the people-plain UNCLE ABE then, as in years gone by in his Western home-should pass through the silent streets of the capital under the escort of common men. The rude backwoodsman, who had become a Moses to lead a people to deliverance from servitude, when dead, first fell into the arms of men humble as he himself had been….\n\nField last lived at 45 East 23rd Street in Manhattan. He died of organ and liver disease. His remains were removed from New York City’s Marble Cemetery in 1920, when he was re-interred at Green-Wood. Section 129, lot 35535.\n\nFIELD, JR., ROBERT MOORE (1836-1923). Private, 7th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company H. A native of New York City, his passport application from 1859 indicates that he was 5′ 7¾” tall with a Roman nose, high forehead, blue eyes, brown hair, florid complexion, and thin face. During the Civil War, Field enlisted on April 19, 1861, and served for 30 days with the 7th Regiment when it was activated that year.\n\nHe followed in the footsteps of his father as a banker; his father, who had the same name, was the second vice president of the Bowery Savings Bank. He was the brother of Samuel Field (see). As per his obituary in The New York Times, he was a member of Lafayette Post #140 of the G.A.R.; members of the organization and those of the Lafayette Camp, Sons of Veterans, were invited to attend his funeral. He last lived at the home of his daughter at 14 Chestnut Avenue in Larchmont, New York. The cause of his death was lobar pneumonia. In 1929, Martha Field, applied for a widow’s pension, application 1,633,406, but there is no certificate number. Section 82, lot 3430.\n\nFIELD, SAMUEL B. (1841-1934). Private, 7th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company H. Born in New York City, Field enlisted a private on April 17, 1861, served in the 7th Regiment during its 30-day activation, and mustered out on June 3. In 1932, he applied for a pension, application 1,716,960, but there is no evidence that it was certified. He was the brother of Robert Field (see). He last lived at 146 Garfield Avenue in Plainfield, New Jersey. The cause of his death was arteriosclerosis. Section 82, lot 3430.\n\nFIELD, THOMAS (1830-1868). Private, 2nd New York Heavy Artillery, Company B. A native of Ireland, Field enlisted at New York City as a sergeant on September 17, 1861, and mustered into the 2nd New York Heavy Artillery the next day. Six days later, he deserted at Staten Island. He last lived at 12 Thompson Street in Manhattan. Section 121, lot 11189, grave 169.\n\nFIELDER (or FEILDER), GEORGE H. (1836-1909). Corporal, 12th New York Infantry, Companies C and D; 5th New York Veteran Infantry, Company F; private, 12th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company C. Born in England, Fielder enlisted in 1861 as a private for a tour of three months and mustered into the 12th Regiment’s Company C. He mustered out on August 5, 1861, at New York City. On October 1, 1861, he re-enlisted at New York City with many other members of his regiment and mustered the next day into the volunteer service for three years. The organization, known as the 12th Militia, consolidated in January 1862 with the 12th Volunteers. On June 23, 1863, he was transferred to Company D and was promoted to corporal at some point during his service. He was transferred into the 5th New York Veteran Infantry, Company F, on June 2, 1864.\n\nThe 1876 New York City Directory reports that Fielder was a carpenter. As per the census of 1880, he worked in a blind and sash factory; the 1884 New York City Directory indicates that he was a sash-maker. In 1887, he applied for and received an invalid pension, certificate 693,442. The Veterans Schedule of 1890 confirms his Civil War service. In 1895, Fielder was admitted to the Home for Disabled Soldiers in Hampton, Virginia, suffering from rheumatism, loss of sight in the left eye and some deafness. His records from the Soldiers’ Home show that his wife was sent $1,269 of his “labor money” after he died from heart disease. Louise Fielder, who is interred with him, applied for and received a widow’s pension in 1909, certificate 697,526. Section 51, lot 9940, grave 10.\n\nFIELDMAN (or FELDMANN), JULIUS C. (also enlisted as MILLER, JULIUS) (1840-1894). Sergeant, 2nd California Infantry, Company I; 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry, Company F. Born in Hessen, Germany, and at one time a resident of California, he worked as a brass finisher. Using the alias Julius Miller, he enlisted as a corporal at San Francisco, California, on November 7, 1861, and mustered into the 2nd California Infantry. He was promoted to sergeant on January 9, 1862, was detached as escort to a pack train in July 1862, and reduced to ranks (private) on January 26, 1863. Fieldman deserted from Fort Gaston, California, on February 16, 1863. Subsequently, he surrendered to the 2nd Massachusetts under President Abraham Lincoln’s Proclamation, then in force on the Pacific coast, which allowed deserters to return to service and avoid punishment.\n\nEnlisting on April 2, 1863, as a private, he mustered the next day into the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry. As per his muster roll, he was 5′ 7″ tall with blue eyes, chestnut brown hair and a light complexion. His muster roll indicates that he was on picket duty in November 1863, assigned as a carpenter in December 1863, and on extra daily duty in February 1864. In November 1864, he was promoted to sergeant. Fieldman was discharged on January 30, 1865, by order of the War Department, at Camp Russell, Virginia. On September 19, 1876, the notation of his desertion from the 2nd California Infantry was canceled because of his subsequent service in the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry and the date of February 16, 1863, was changed to his discharge date.\n\nFieldman’s application for an invalid pension was granted in 1890, certificate 858,435. The Brooklyn Census for 1892 lists his occupation as “R.R.” As per his obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, he belonged to fraternal organizations including the George C. Strong Post #534 of the G.A.R.; his comrades were in invited to attend his funeral. Fieldman last resided at 1220 Gates Avenue, Brooklyn. His death was attributed to heart disease. Agnes Fieldman, who is interred with him, applied for and was granted a widow’s pension in 1894, certificate 403,254. In 1895, application 616,203 was filed for a minor’s pension by Bernhard Degenkolb, guardian, most likely for their daughter Augusta, who was blind, but there is no certificate number. Section 135, lot 27263, grave 1258.\n\nFIELDS, WARRINGTON (also enlisted as WALLACE, PETER) (1822-1884). Private, 56th Regiment, New York State National Guard, Company H; 14th New Jersey Infantry, Company D; 2nd New Jersey Infantry, Company D. During the Civil War, Warrington Fields was borne on the rolls first by his given name and subsequently by his alias, Peter Wallace. He was first borne as Warrington Fields, a private in Company H of the 56th Regiment, when that unit was called into service for 30 days in 1863. He re-enlisted as a private, using the alias Peter Wallace, on February 23, 1865, mustered into Company D of the 14th New Jersey that same day and was transferred on June 18, 1865, into Company D of the 2nd New Jersey from which he was discharged on an unknown date.\n\nAccording to the 1868 Brooklyn Directory, Fields was in the fish business and lived on 19th Street near Third Avenue; at the time of the 1875 Brooklyn Directory, he lived at 662 Fifth Avenue. The 1884 Brooklyn Directory lists Fields as a weigher whose home address was 162 26th Street. He died at Long Island College Hospital from peritonitis. Lucretia Fields, the daughter of Albert Voorhees and Catherine Stillwell, well-known Brooklyn families, who is interred with him, applied for and received a widow’s pension in 1890, certificate 417,185. His pension index card notes his alias, Peter Wallace, and Lucretia’s obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle in 1915 notes that she was the widow of Warrington Fields. Section 187, lot 19938.\n\nFILLEY, MONROE (or THOMAS) B. (1827-1867). Second lieutenant, 65th New York Infantry, Companies B and I; private, 67th New York Infantry, Companies A and B. According to the census of 1850, Monroe B. Filley was living in Hartford, Connecticut, his birthplace, and working there as a clerk. His initial enlistment in the Civil War is blurred by a confusing muster roll that includes both the names “Monroe B.” and “Thomas B.” Filley. That muster roll indicates that the recruit was a clerk from Hartford who was 5′ 9″ tall with blue eyes, light brown hair and a fair complexion. Further, he was a substitute for William A. Light who was drafted. According to that paperwork, Filley enlisted at the 5th Congressional District on June 18, 1864, mustered into Company A of the 67th New York Infantry that same date, transferred intra-regimentally on July 4 into Company B, and transferred into Company B of the 65th New York on September 1.\n\nThe soldier record for Thomas Filley includes the service in the 67th New York and the service in the 65th; while the soldier record for Monroe B. Filley only indicates the service in the 65th New York. Since the dates of service in the 65th, and the occupation and birthplace are identical, it is likely that Monroe and Thomas are the same man. On May 12, 1865, he was transferred to Company I effective upon his promotion to second lieutenant. He mustered out at Hall’s Hill, Virginia, on July 17, 1865.\n\nFilley last lived at 402 West 22nd Street in Manhattan. It is unclear where he died. As per his obituary in New York’s Evening Post, he died in New York City on January 10, 1867, and was formerly from Connecticut. However, his name is also listed on Connecticut Deaths and Burial Index as one who died in that state; that data is likely to be incorrect. It is known that he died of convulsions. Monroe B. Filley’s name is inscribed on a family tombstone at Center Cemetery in South Windsor, Connecticut; however, the inscription notes that Monroe is buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in New York. Burial records for Green-Wood indicate his interment there was on January 12, 1867, two days after his death. Section 59, lot 2229, grave 129.\n\nFINCH, JOHN (1825-1865). Private, 17th New York Infantry, Company H. A native of Ireland, he resided at 358 Washington Street in Manhattan when he enlisted at New York City on February 22, 1865. Finch mustered immediately into the 17th New York, and died of congestion of the lungs at DeCamp Hospital on David’s Island, New York Harbor, on April 16 of that year. Section 115, lot 13536 (Soldiers’ Lot), grave 102.\n\nFINLEY, GEORGE F. (1844-1911). Corporal, 5th New York Infantry, Company H. Finley, a Manhattan native and a wheelwright by trade, was 5′ 7½” with brown eyes and black hair. After he enlisted as a private at New York City on April 25, 1861, he mustered into the 5th on May 9, and was detailed as the company’s cook that July. He was wounded in the left thigh at Second Bull Run, Virginia, on August 30, 1862, and treated in Washington, D.C., at Carver Hospital. Finley returned to the regiment that November, was promoted to corporal on January 25, 1863, and mustered out on May 14, 1863, at New York City.\n\nAs per the censuses of 1880, 1900, and 1910, Finley worked as a wheelwright. In 1879, his application for an invalid pension was approved under certificate 191,601. His obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, which confirms his Civil War service, indicates that he also served in the Quartermaster’s Department during the Spanish-American War. In addition, he belonged to the 5th Veterans’ Association and the Brooklyn City Post #233 of the G.A.R. He last lived at 494 Halsey Street in Brooklyn. In 1912, his wife applied for and received a widow’s pension, certificate 736,012. Section 80, lot 1973.\n\nFINLEY, SAMUEL (1838-1885). Surgeon’s steward, United States Navy.

He served on the USS Ohio, the Baron DeKalb, and the Lafayette, first on January 1, 1864, and again on March 31 of that year. At some point he became a surgeon’s steward, and was discharged from the Lafayette on March 12, 1865. His last address was 240 South 5th Street in Brooklyn. His death was due to phthisis. Section 164, lot 14882.\n\nFINLEY, THOMAS K. (1845-1890). Ordinary seaman, United States Navy. Finley, who was born in Scotland, entered the United States Navy as a second class boy at New York City on October 26, 1862, rose to ordinary seaman at some point, and served aboard the USS Oneida and USS North Carolina. He saw action at Vicksburg, Mississippi, at New Orleans, Louisiana, and at Mobile Bay, Alabama, where he was wounded in both legs. He was discharged for disability at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on April 12, 1865. An affidavit from his brother in 1890 confirms his service under Admiral Farragut at New Orleans, Vicksburg, and Mobile Bay. In July 1890, he applied for a Navy invalid pension citing wounds in the hip and kneecap that was granted under certificate 16,646. His last address was 223 Avenue C in Manhattan. He died of an aneurysm in November 1890, with the pension awarded to his widow, Mary A. Finley, certificate 7,477. Section B, lot 11005, grave 363.\n\nFINNEGAN (or FINNIGAN), WILLIAM (1834-1875). Private, 15th New York Cavalry, Company D. Of Irish origin, Finnegan enlisted at Brooklyn as a private on January 21, 1864, the same date that he mustered into the 15th New York Cavalry. He was discharged for disability on August 25, 1864. The Brooklyn Directories for 1868 and 1871 list his occupation as “driver.” According to his obituary in the New York Herald, he belonged to the Odd Fellows and the Woodbine Lodge #275; members of those organizations were invited to attend his funeral. His last residence was 266 Columbia Street in Brooklyn. The cause of his death was consumption. Section 190, lot 17722.\n\nFIQUET, CHARLES JEROME (1835-1911). Private, 2nd Battalion, Alabama Light Artillery, Company F; Lumsden’s Battery Confederate States of America. Fiquet was born in New York. His brother, Dominique Doux Fiquet, a lawyer, obtained a degree from the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa in 1855; that entry indicates that Dominique’s father was named Charles J. Fiquet. Fiquet served with the 2nd Battalion of the Alabama Light Artillery and in Lumsden’s Battery, a unit organized in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. No other details about his service are available. He received a pardon by order of President Andrew Johnson on July 18, 1865. At the time of his pardon, he was a resident of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and employed in the clothing business.\n\nOn January 29, 1870, The New York Times announced Fiquet’s marriage to Evelina Tribit. As per the census of 1880, he was a broker. The New York City Directory published in 1885 listed him as a clerk. His last residence was 2259 Creston Avenue in the Bronx. His death was caused by myocarditis. Section 76, lot 5808.\n\nFISCHER, FREDERICK F. (1824-1874). Captain, 178th New York Infantry, Companies I and C; sergeant, 29th New York Infantry, Company E. Fischer, who was born in Germany, was a tailor according to the 1860 census. During the Civil War, he enlisted as a private at New York City in 1862, mustered into the 29th and at muster out, achieved the rank of sergeant.

On August 31, 1863, he re-enlisted as a private at New York City, mustered into Company I of the 178th New York on September 3, and was promoted to corporal on October 1. On February 1, 1865, he transferred into Company C and was discharged from military service on April 20, 1866, at Montgomery, Alabama.

Fogarty, who is interred with him, applied for and was awarded a widow’s pension in 1904, certificate 576,489. Section 14, lot 19438, grave 99.\n\nFOGG, WILLIAM (1817-1884). Patrolman during the New York City Draft Riots. Originally from Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, he was a clerk in Boston before he moved to New York City. He soon opened an upholstery store at 24-26 Fulton Street in Manhattan and was one of the first to import goose feathers from Russia. At the start of the War, he worked for the government in his line of business. In 1863, he was a mounted patrolman who was on duty when the Draft Riots broke out in New York City in July of that year and took an active part in subduing the protest.\n\nIn 1866, Fogg relocated his business to Chatham Street, subsequently moving to Canal Street in 1876. A founding trustee of the Union Dime Savings Bank, he was also one of the directors of the Ninth National Bank. Additionally, he was a major stockholder in the Savannah Line of steamships and a member of the Old Guard. His last residence was 431 West 22nd Street in Manhattan. His death was caused by pericarditis, inflammation of the tissues surrounding the heart. Section 172, lot 14240.\n\nFOGGO, WILLIAM (1839-1863). A native of New York City and resident of 94 Perry Street in Manhattan, Foggo, a car-man, was 5′ 7″ tall with blue eyes, brown hair and a fair complexion. He enrolled at New York City as a private on August 30, 1862, mustered into the 15th Engineers that day, was promoted to artificer on an unspecified date, and died from tuberculosis and malarial fever at the regimental hospital at Falmouth, Virginia, on April 3, 1863. Section 13, lot 9334.\n\nFOLK, JOHN SEWARD (1810-1885). Brooklyn Chief of Police, New York City Draft Riots. Born in Brooklyn in a farmhouse which is now the site of the Municipal Building, some biographies list Folk’s birth year as 1811, but his gravestone is inscribed “1810.” He was a carpenter before joining the Brooklyn City Watch, the first organized police force in the borough, in the 1830s. A large and powerfully-built man, he was renowned for his coolness in putting down the Bread Riot of 1837. The City Watch was composed of constables elected by the voters of Brooklyn. Elected head constable of the force, he remained in that position until 1851 when the Brooklyn Municipal Police was formed. He soon became Brooklyn chief of police, a position he held for almost 15 years. During 1854, he led the police during the Angel Gabriel Riots as well as during unrest among abolitionists and volunteer firefighters. While battling the firefighters, he was struck on the head with a wrench and bore a scar from that blow for the rest of his life.\n\nDuring the Draft Riots in July 1863, Folk was called to Manhattan to join Inspector Daniel Carpenter to relieve the defenders of the New York Tribune office on July 13, and broke up the mob in City Hall Park. David Barnes in The Metropolitan Police, Their Services During Riot Week, Their Honorable Record reports that Inspector Folk, on his return to Brooklyn, heard that two African-Americans had been killed near the docks at Fulton Ferry. Upon inspecting the area, Folk found two African-Americans, one with a bloodied head and broken arm and the other with body bruises. He was unable to get a carriage to take the seriously injured man to the hospital, even with a police guard, and finally secured a fish wagon to transport the man, with sufficient guard, there. Folk returned to Brooklyn on July 15, 1863, where he saved the Brooklyn Daily Eagle office from rioters and together with 40 other officers, stood guard in the lecture room behind the church organ of the Plymouth Church when abolitionist Rev. Henry Ward Beecher (see) gave a Sunday sermon on July 19 of that tumultuous week.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the Board of Commissioners appointed Folk inspector for the Metropolitan Police Department with authority for the entire Brooklyn police force. He lost that position when the Brooklyn Board of Commissioners was formed in 1870. He was made an inspector in 1872 and superintendent a year later. Upon his death, a committee of New York Police Department captains was formed to arrange his funeral. His son, William H. Folk (see), was captain of the 12th Precinct in Brooklyn. He last lived at 170 Skillman Street in Brooklyn. He died from nephritis. Section 55, lot 14206.\n\nFOLK, WILLIAM H. (1837-1892). Major by brevet; captain, 173rd New York Infantry. He was born in Brooklyn where his father, John Seward Folk (see), was elected the first police chief of Brooklyn in 1851. He became a clerk in his father’s office in May 1856, and a patrolman two years later.\n\nFolk was among the first to form the 173rd Regiment, known familiarly as the Metropolitan Police Brigade, on July 20, 1862, at Riker’s Island. On September 6, 1862, he was appointed as adjutant, and was commissioned into the Field and Staff of the 173rd New York on November 10, 1862. The regiment went to Louisiana in December of that year, then took part in expeditions to Placquemine and Indian Villages on February 5, 1863. He took an active role during the siege of Port Hudson, Louisiana, from May 19 through July 8, 1863. During the latter part of that siege, he served as the acting assistant adjutant general of the Third Brigade until late July when he returned to New York for recruiting duty. He was then detailed to David’s Island as the post adjutant. He was promoted to captain on August 7, 1865, when he returned to his regiment at Washington, D.C., and mustered out on October 18, 1865, at Savannah, Georgia.\n\nAfter a celebratory march and reception by the citizens of Brooklyn on October 26, Folk returned to his job as a police officer and soon became a detective, according to his obituaries in the New York Herald and The New York Times. In 1867, he was brevetted major “for gallant and meritorious services in the late War.” Folk was assigned to the Central Office squad as detective for fifteen years. In 1881, he became a sergeant, then two days later a police captain and, as of June 26, 1881, was commander of the Atlantic Avenue Station. Active in Republican politics, he was also a trustee of the Brooklyn Police Mutual Benefit Association.\n\nHis obituary in the Brooklyn Standard Union on March 24, 1892, included a tribute by the officers of the Twelfth Precinct, of which Folk was the commanding officer. They said that Folk’s death was a loss to the public and the city at large “whose best interests he was always the champion.” Another article in the Brooklyn Standard Union that same day, “The Folks, Father and Son,” characterized William Folk as the ideal policeman and “true guardian of the peace of a great city” who learned much from his father, who was police chief at a time of great lawlessness. An article in the Brooklyn Standard Union on April 18, 1892, reported that veterans of the 173rd New York met to pay tribute to William Folk and remember his service in the Civil War. The veterans remembered Folk as a strict disciplinarian, accurate to every detail, loyal to his country and one whose private life was as exemplary as his public service. He last lived at 144 Van Buren Street in Brooklyn. His death was attributed to pneumonia. In 1892, Lydia Folk applied for and received a widow’s pension under certificate 517,189. Section 55, lot 14206.\n\nFOLWELL, CORTLANDT (or CORTLAND) (1842-1868). Sergeant, 3rd New York Infantry, Company G; private, 9th New York Infantry, Company H. A New Yorker by birth, Folwell was the manager of the Avonite Club at the time of his enlistment as a private at New York City on August 26. 1862. As per his muster roll, he was a clerk who was 5′ 8″ tall with gray eyes, black hair and a fair complexion. He mustered into the 9th New York three days later. His muster roll notes that he deserted from the hospital at Washington, D.C., on March 19, 1863, returned that month and returned to duty on April 20. Folwell was transferred into the 3rd New York on May 6, 1863, became a corporal on January 29, 1864, and was reduced to ranks on June 10. Folwell was promoted to corporal on May 11, 1865, to sergeant twelve days later, and was discharged on June 17, 1865, at Raleigh, North Carolina. He last lived at 9 Harrison Street in New York City. He died from phthisis. Section L, lot 18450.\n\nFOOTE, GEORGE L. (1844-1917). Private, 23rd Regiment, New York State National Guard, Company D. A native of Lee, Massachusetts, Foote served as a private with the 23rd Regiment when it was activated for 30 days in 1863. The censuses of 1900 and 1910 and the Brooklyn Directory of 1904 indicate that he was a manufacturer of electric supplies. The Electrical Record (Volume II, July 1907) reports that Foote, of Foote, Pierson & Company, obtained a patent for a lightning-arrester. An advertisement from his company at 82-84 Fulton Street in Manhattan shows that his business has a patent for the Morse-Graph, an apparatus that keeps a record of all signals that are transmitted and a “20th Century Key” for telegraph operators that transmits clearer and more solid signals.\n\nActive in civic organizations, he belonged to several Masonic associations, including the Masonic Veterans; as per his obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, members of his lodges were invited to attend his funeral. His last residence was 107 Macon Street in Brooklyn. His death was attributed to chronic nephritis. Section 204, lot 348421, graves 1 and 2.\n\nFOOTE, HENRY R. (1824-1889). First lieutenant and quartermaster, 82nd New York Infantry. A native of Massachusetts, he enlisted at New York City as a first lieutenant on May 28, 1861, and was commissioned into the Field and Staff of the 82nd New York as a first lieutenant and quartermaster that same day. He was dismissed on April 19, 1862. His name was attached to an undated advertisement in the New York Sun in 1862 requesting “good men” for the Ambulance and Sanitary Corps to apply at headquarters at 654 Broadway to get particulars about bounties, etc. In 1863, he wrote a 23-page book, “The Dead and Wounded Uncared for: A Brief Statement of the Fearful and Unnecessary Loss of Life on the Battle-field … Developing the Necessity of an Ambulance Corps …” In addition, he produced an exhibition drill by the Ambulance and Sanitary Corps demonstrating how the sick and wounded were tended to on the field and Foote’s hope that the corps could become a cavalry unit; the exhibition did not receive positive reviews from the audience. On February 23, 1864, his name was listed in another advertisement looking to raise four companies for the 165th Regiment (Second Duryee Zouaves). In addition to the bounties of $852 for veterans or $677 for new recruits, cash payments of $300 for passing surgeon (physical) and $150 before leaving for the regiment were promised as well as the distinctive uniform (a savings of $23) and relief tickets for families.\n\nA man who wore many hats, Foote was a civil engineer who invented at his own expense and patented a device that converted petroleum to steam to produce heat. Articles in the Gloversville Intelligencer on June 25, 1867, and in the Lockport Journal & Courier on November 20, 1867, two New York newspapers, reported that the apparatus was being tested on a steamer, the USS Palos, at the Boston Navy Yard with the hope that, if successful, the device would save money and storage space and burn cleaner, thus becoming a replacement for coal. The Intelligencer story reported that oil from West Virginia, which was heavier than oil from Pennsylvania, was most suited for heating because it was non-explosive.\n\nAlthough he was at one time a wealthy man who had been commissioner of patents at the office in Washington, D.C., district attorney in Washington, New York, and a judge in Seneca, New York, an article in the Utica Weekly Herald on December 25, 1877, shed light on a controversy in his life. That article reported that Foote had passed bad checks to John Cronin, a bookseller in Long Island City, for rare books that supposedly had belonged to Napoleon Bonaparte. Foote was interested in curiosities and, although was due to receive $10,000 from New York State for his patent for a furnace that burnt garbage, presented a worthless check in the amount of $510. Another article about the trial appeared in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle on December 20, 1877, noting that Foote claimed that his check, drawn on a Pennsylvania bank, was a “promissory note”; Cronin argued that Foote owed him the money or the books and that he had received neither. A guilty verdict was reached in ten minutes. The article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle described Foote as a large man of commanding appearance, clear voice, high forehead and “unusually intelligent face” who chewed tobacco and was misty-eyed after the verdict was delivered and the sentence of two and a half years imprisonment was pronounced. The defense asked for leniency and time to appeal the decision. Subsequent articles in The New York Times on July 21, 1879, and in the New York Herald on July 28, 1879, reported that he had already served six months at Sing-Sing Prison. The articles went on to report that Foote applied for and was granted an exception on a writ of error and was required to post $5,000 bail. The New York Times stated that Foote ran the mess-room engine at the prison and if he continued his good behavior, could reduce his sentence by six months. Another news article in the Brooklyn Union Argus on February 19, 1879, which noted that Foote had to return to prison, identified the volumes in question as “The Music Français.”\n\nOn April 12, 1882, he addressed the Farmers’ Club at the Cooper Institute in New York City as per an article in the New York Herald. His presentation, “Utilizing Refuse and Garbage,” focused on his plan for New York City based upon his invention of a closed furnace that “cremated” or incinerated garbage, providing cleaner waters for New York Harbor, a healthier environment and manure for farmers as a by-product. The listing in the 1884 Brooklyn Directory notes that he had a school for steam engineering at 269 Eighth Avenue. His last residence was at 230 West 36th Street in Manhattan. He died from heart disease. In 1890, his widow, Linda Foote, was granted a pension, certificate 357,348. Section 59, lot 295, grave 19.\n\nFOOTE, LEWIS RAY (1844-1905). Private, 61st New York Infantry, Company C. Born in South New Berlin, New York, Foote was a farmer who was 6′ tall with a light complexion and gray eyes when he enlisted at Hamilton, New York, on September 16, 1861, and mustered into the 61st New York. After being shot by a musket ball in the right thigh at the Battle of Fair Oaks, Virginia, on June 2, 1862, he was treated at the United States General Hospital in Portsmouth Grove, Rhode Island, and was discharged for disability on September 18, 1862, at Providence, Rhode Island. In 1863, he applied for and was granted an invalid pension, certificate 18,650.\n\nIn 1872, Foote was ordained as a Presbyterian minister and was installed as pastor of the Throop Avenue Presbyterian Church on December 20, 1873. The description on his passport application of 1902 indicates that he was 6’4″ tall with a high forehead, large mouth, firm chin, slightly gray hair and smooth-shaven face. An article about his funeral on December 23, 1905, in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported that about 2,000 people attended his funeral necessitating the use of an overflow chapel. He was lauded for his faithfulness, generosity toward poor churches, kindness and sincerity. The article notes that it took more than a half an hour for all the attendees to pay respects at his casket. Fellow pastors noted that Foote was a fine example for young preachers and as he watched Brooklyn grow from a small community to a place larger than some states, he rose to the challenge and accepted more responsibility. In addition, he was a member of the Young Peoples Association, a college fraternity, and the Ulysses S. Grant Post #327 of the G.A.R. At the time of his death, he lived at 523 Willoughby Avenue in Brooklyn. His death was caused by typhoid fever. His widow, Harriet A. Foote, applied for and received a pension in 1908, certificate 660,426. In 1945, the Throop Avenue Presbyterian Church merged with the Throop Memorial Rosedale Church in Rosedale, Queens, where a bronze tablet dedicated to Foote honors his memory today. Section 162, lot 15279, grave 4.\n\nFORBES (or FORBS), COLIN (or COLVIN) VAN GELDER (1841-1912). Sergeant, 5th New York Infantry, Company G. Born in New York City, he entered service as a private on April 25, 1861, and mustered into Company G on May 9. He was 5′ 9″ with a light complexion, gray eyes, and light brown hair. At the time of his enlistment, he managed his father’s farm in Rahway, New Jersey, which he left abruptly necessitating his asking for a furlough a few months later to settle matters there. He was promoted to corporal on August 6, 1861. His descendant had his memoir from the engagement at Hanover Court House, Virginia (May 27, 1862), in which he wrote:\n\n“…Fortunately, there was no necessity for us as the engagement had been won. So we went into camp in the field. By this time it was quite dark. After I had something to eat, I started out to get a canteen of water as mine was nearly out. In my rambling I came near the field hospital, being the house with a large yard enclosed by a fence. Right near the house was a very large table. Along the side and near the fence lay our wounded. There was a lighted lantern here and there which added to the dismal effect. Some of the men where they lay were calling, “Oh, doctor! Oh, doctor! Others, “Water! Water!” It was a heart rending noise. Sometimes it still rings in my ears. Hardened as I was, I had to get away from it.\n\nWhen I had gotten my water I thought I would try to sleep. I was very tired. Near my Company I came across two men lying apart so another could creep in between. It seemed a good place for me, so in I went placing my blanket over the three of us. I slept like a log all night. Reveille call woke me. I pulled my blanket off, called my companions, “Come, get up! Roll call!” Not a stir did they make. It struck me as strange. I shook them- No movement. Then I took a look at them. Both were dead.”\n\nHe rose to sergeant on September 6, 1862. Forbes fought in Virginia with the 5th at Gaines’ Mill and Malvern Hill, helping at the latter to report back to artillerymen where their shots were landing. He urged his fellow noncommissioned officers to allow new recruits to retreat in the face of an overwhelming Confederate assault at Second Bull Run, Virginia. Though his company lost 34 of its 50 men killed or wounded, he did not retreat until the enemy was just feet away. After the Battle of Centreville, Virginia, the 5th had been reduced to less than 100 men, and he commanded his company. In an undated letter, he wrote that he never slept on picket post, “…I had to run up and down to keep my eyes open. When I came to a walk the lids would go down, and I would find myself almost asleep, and would have to run up and down again. I knew if I fell asleep I would be shot. One time I thought I was gone. I almost dropped but caught myself, and was on another round by it…” He mustered out at New York City on May 14, 1863. Subsequently, he served with the 9th Regiment, New York National Guard, Company G, from July 24, 1864 through July 2, 1873.\n\nImmediately after the War, Forbes lived in New York, then moved to New Jersey in the 1870s, but returned to New York City in 1878, and lived there for the rest of his life where he worked as a bank clerk for People’s Bank for 30 years. He was a secretary and treasurer of the 5th New York Veterans Association, a group that he helped found. In addition, he was a member of the Veterans of the Ninth Regiment and the John A. Dix Post #135 of the G.A.R. In 1904, he was granted an invalid pension under certificate 1,102,628. His brother, William (see), also fought in the Civil War. He last lived at 51 West 91st Street in Manhattan. Forbes succumbed to nephritis. His gravestone, in the shape of a knapsack, indicates service in the Duryée Zouaves and the G.A.R. Section 97, lot 5290.\n\nFORBES, EDWIN (1839-1895). Civil War illustrator, painter, etcher, and writer. Born in New York City, he studied painting under Alfred F. Tait. When the Civil War began, he was assigned to follow in the Army of the Potomac as a staff artist for Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper. His sketches of camp life and battlefields appeared in that weekly throughout the War. They were later made into copperplate etchings, published as Life Studies of the Great Army, and were awarded a medal at the Centennial Exposition of 1876. The original prints were purchased by General William Tecumseh Sherman and decorated his office in the War Department in Washington, D.C. After 1878, he devoted himself to landscape and cattle pictures, working from his studio in Brooklyn. A bill was introduced in Congress in 1884 to authorize the purchase by the government of his original Civil War drawings. However, the appropriation of $7,500 was never approved.\n\nForbes spent his last years tapping his War experiences for illustrations for several children’s books, including General William T. Sherman, His Life and Battles, Mostly in One Syllable Words (1886), written by his wife Ida B. Forbes, Our Naval Heroes in Words of Easy Syllables (1886), by Josephine Pollard, and H.W. Pierson’s Life and Battles of Napoleon Bonaparte (1887). In 1891, he published Thirty Years After, a volume focused on the Civil War. A few years before his death he was paralyzed on his right side; he then taught himself to paint and write with his left hand. He died in Flatbush of nephritis. In 1919, the collection of his sketches, plates, and prints was given to the Library of Congress by John Pierpont Morgan. Section 106, lot 6001.\n\nFORBES, GEORGE E. (1832-1879).
