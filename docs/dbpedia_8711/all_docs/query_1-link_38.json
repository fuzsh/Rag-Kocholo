        "text": "Comedy Circus Ka Naya Daur which went on air two weeks back will no longer see Reshmi Ghosh as its host. Reshmi hosted just one episode and was later replaced by Shweta Tiwari.\n\nA source says, \"Reshmi Ghosh was to host the entire season of Comedy but the channel didn't like her performance after the first episode and decided to bring in Shweta Tiwari in her place. Reshmi was back at home in Kolkata celebrating her birthday and was geared up to shoot for the next episode when she was informed about her replacement. However, the channel has still not found a permanent host for the show. Shweta Tiwari has shot for two episodes. Shweta has been a part of the show in the previous seasons also. However, the search for a permanent host is still on.\"\n\nReshmi confirmed the news and said, \"I was hurt with their decision but I hold nothing against the channel or the production house. In fact, the show helped me to understand that I can be an anchor and in the future though acting will be my priority, I shall anchor many other shows.\"\n\nVipul D Shah of Optimystix remained unavailable.\n\nCopyright 2011 Indian Television Dot Com Pvt Ltd., distributed by Contify.com"
