        "text": "Miss India-Earth, the dusky Bengali with large eyes, Reshmi Ghosh, sure did win over many hearts along with the Miss India-Earth crown. Born and brought up in Kolkatta, Reshmi Ghosh graduated from Jogamaya Devi college with a first class, BA. Unlike most Miss contestants who first win a title and then go on to acting, Reshmi has it the other way around. Before winning the Miss India-Earth title, she graced the ramp, did many cameos in Bengali films and entered Bollywood.\n\nArmed with the confidence that she can win over anybody with her smile and a melodious voice, Reshmi enchanted the audience at the Femina Miss Talent sub-contest with 'Bade Achche Lagte Hain'. Her courage can best be seen when she was diagnosed with a slip disc just twenty days before the Miss Earth pagent. She still continued her practice along with her treatment. In spite of the pain, Reshmi made her mark at the contest. She walked away with the First Runner Up crown for the Global Beauty Award and won the second National Costume Award for the outfit designed specially by Ritu Kumar.\n\nAfter all the pageants are over, Reshmi is back in India. She joined the Green Peace organisation and will head for Bollywood. She is also looking forward to her debut film 'Saazish', which will release later this year."
