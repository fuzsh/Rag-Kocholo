        "text": "Kolkata: A woman was allegedly murdered by her husband after a scuffle at their home in Baranagar on early Tuesday. The accused, Vikash Kapur (38), also slashed his daughter Puja (14) when she tried to save her mother, Reshmi. He, however, blamed Reshmi for injuring him.\n\nThe police have found that he tried to commit suicide by injuring himself after killing Reshmi and injuring his daughter in their rented flat at Amal Bhavan on Fakir Ghosh Lane near Dunlop.\n\nThe couple allegedly entered into an altercation during which the accused turned violent and hit his wife, preliminary investigation revealed.\n\nThe incident came to light when the family’s neighbour heard Reshmi screaming in her second floor flat for help and reportedly knocked the door. With blood oozing out of injuries in her hands, Puja opened the door and asked the neighbour to call up her grandfather.\n\nThe woman said that after entering the flat, she was horrified to see Reshmi lying in a pool of blood with multiple injuries. She told police, “There was blood on Vikash, too, who was standing near a blood-soaked knife. He remained mum when I asked him if he had lost his sense.” Later, the Baranagar police was informed. With deep injuries, the couple and their daughter were rushed to Baranagar State General Hospital from where Reshmi and Puja were shifted to R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital, but Reshmi succumbed to her injuries. Her brother later lodged a complaint against the accused with the Barangar police station. A case of murder has been initiated against him. Reshmi’s father, Vijay Burman, said that the couple visited his residence on Monday night and dined there before returning home. The police learnt the couple with their daughter earlier stayed in Lake Town, and Vikash was into clothes business then.\n\nAn year ago, he changed his residence after his business failed and started staying with his family at his present residence on rent. With his in-laws’ help, he got a job at a garments shop in south Kolkata."
