        "text": "</>\n\nKyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, India's longest running family saga, which still captivates audience's minds, will take its second leap today. Yes, with the blessings of Ba, who is still alive to see the fourth generation of her family, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi is ushering in the next Virani generation after yet another 20-year leap which will be taken today, on its producer, Ekta Kapoor's birthday.\n\nThe serial will now introduce a new protagonist, 'Krishna Tulsi', who will be the mischievous version of Tulsi. Speaking on her character, Balaji mastermind, Ekta Kapoor said, \"Krishna Tulsi is a strong character rooted to her culture and family values. She's characterised by her innocence, intelligence and go-getter attitude.\"\n\nAlong with Krishna Tulsi the serial also launches a new set of actors - Nakul, Bhumi, Eklavya and Manthan, who have grown up over the years either to be an ideal child or a spoilt brat. About the long running success of the show, Ekta said, \"For six years Kyunki has been the number one serial. The mix of characters will make the plot even more interesting. Not only the new characters, but also the new sets and the new look of the existing characters will make the prime slot worth waiting.\"\n\nAll the artistes' - old and new - were excited about the serial's 20-year leap. Hiten Tejwani, better known as Karan explaining the new family scenario said, \"All the brothers are separated (as the property is divided), but still live in Shantiniketan. The upper floor belongs to the rich brother (Karan), while the floor below belongs to Sahil, the poorest of all.\" Speaking about his character, he said, \"There are a lot of changes in my character. I have slowed down a lot. It is a more matured kind of role that I play now.\"\n\nFormer Miss India Earth, Resshmi Ghosh, the one who plays the role of Bhumi, from the new generation, looking rather excited about her new role said, \"My uncle is Jeetandraji's friend. He informed me about the auditions. I gave it a shot and here I am.\" Resshmi, has already bagged the central role in two films, but still considers TV as the best profession.\n\nWith the new generation Sudha Shivpuri, Ba gets a new added accessory â€” a walking stick. About her role she says, \"In real life, I'm 68 years old, while in the serial I'm already 108.\" About the feasibility of such a character, she says, \"I know that I'll be there for the initial episodes but I may not live for the further ones. Ekta will decide that.\"\n\nCharacter Sketch\n\nManthan, played by Amit Tandon, is Karan and Tanya's son. He's an over confident cool dude who never misses an opportunity to insult his cousins Nakul and Lakshya. He's very close to Bhumi, his sister.\n\nEklavya, played by Akashdeep Sehgal (yes he is back) is Ansh's son. This good boy will later turn into a villain when he finds out that Tulsi killed his father.\n\nBhumi, played by Resshmi Ghosh, is Karan and Tanya's daughter. She's a spoilt brat who's very tomboyish. She has loads of attitude, is outgoing loves to do evil things, just for fun.\n\nNakul, played by Naman Shaw is Sahil and Ganga's son. He's a neglected child, who has a huge inferiority complex. He's a silent person.\n\nJoydeep, played by Manav Vij is Sahil's adopted son. He is a very sweet innocent character and will marry Bhumi later.\n\nKrishan Tulsi, the mischievous younger version of Tulsi is the surprise package of the show. To know more about her, tune in to Star Plus, at 10:30 pm.\n\nSo , what are u waiting for? Feel free to discuss whatever u feel like discussing, esp. after tonights episode is aired.\n\nPS: Keep it clean! All other topics regarding the topic will b closed, to keep everything more organized and under one thread\n\nCheers,\n\nEisha"
