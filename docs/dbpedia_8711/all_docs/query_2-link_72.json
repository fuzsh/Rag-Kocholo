        "text": "Modelling and acting are but two faces of the same coin. Often, outsiders – as in those who were not born to famous parents – get into the world of modelling before they can become actors. It is a way to get one foot in in the entertainment industry and to gain visibility. Several of our TV celebrities, who often tend to be from non-acting backgrounds try their hand at modelling first. Many of them end up participating in beauty pageants to further their reach. Here are a few such TV celebs who participated in pageants early on in their careers.\n\nSmriti Irani\n\nOur current Information and Broadcasting and Textiles Minister Smriti Irani’s claim to fame was the uber popular K-serial Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi. But prior to her acting career, Smriti Irani dabbled in modelling. She was one of the finalists of Miss India in 1998.\n\nGauri Pradhan\n\nSmriti Irani’s on-screen bahu, and former lead actor of another hit K-serial Kutumb, Gauri Pradhan also participated in Miss India in 1998.

She was only 18 when she took part in the pageant in 2002. She came fourth.\n\nDivyanka Tripathi Dahiya\n\nOne of the most successful TV actresses, Divyanka started her career as an anchor on Akashvani in Bhopal. She also went onto participate in the Pantene Zee Teen Queen pageant in 2003, where she won the title of Miss Beautiful Skin.\n\nAishwarya Sakhuja\n\nAishwarya was recently spotted in Sarabhai vs Sarabhai: Take 2 as Sonya, and has done several other TV shows. This model-turned-actress started her journey in the Miss India pageant. She was one of the finalists in 2006.\n\nMihika Verma\n\nThe Yeh Hai Mohabbatein actor made her acting debut in 2007 with Virrudh. But, before that she had won the Miss India International title in 2004.

She participated in Miss India in 2011, and finished in the top 10.\n\nReshmi Ghosh\n\nReshmi made her TV debut with Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and went on to act in several other TV shows.
