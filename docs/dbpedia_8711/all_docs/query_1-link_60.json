No. 2487 of 2019\n\n(Assigned)\n\nCt. 21\n\n09.09.19\n\nReshmi Ghosh nee Tarafdar\n\nVersus\n\nNiloy Ghosh\n\nMr. Rajdeep Bhattacharya … for the petitioner.\n\nMr. Saunak Bhattacharya,\n\nMr. Chandranath Sarkar … for the opposite party.\n\nThe opposite party has filed an application before\n\nthe learned District Judge at Alipore under the provisions of\n\nThe Guardian and SectionWards Act, 1890 (hereinafter referred to\n\nas the said Act ‘in short) registered as Act VIII Case No. 48 of\n\n2015 praying custody of his minor daughter, who is now\n\naged about 13 years and a student of Class – VIII of La\n\nMartiniere School, Kolkata.\n\nThe mother of the minor, the petitioner herein in\n\nthe said proceeding filed an application under Section 151 of\n\nthe Code of Civil Procedure thereby praying maintenance for\n\nthe minor daughter of the parties and litigation expenses.\n\nThe learned trial Judge by the order impugned has\n\nfixed a sum of Rs. 9,000/- per month on account of\n\nmaintenance of the daughter of the parties and a further\n\nsum of Rs. 20,000/- on account of litigation expenses.\n\nThe grievance of the petitioner is that the learned\n\n2\n\ntrial Judge only on the basis of the acknowledgement of the\n\nIncome Tax Return of the opposite party has fixed the said\n\namount without considering his other sources of income.\n\nLearned counsel for the opposite party submits that\n\nin course of hearing of the present revisional application his\n\nclient could detect some documents wherefrom it will appear\n\nthat the mother has also independent source of income,\n\ntherefore she is also liable to share the expenses for the\n\ndaughter.\n\nBe that as it may, the petitioner is complaining that\n\nthe learned trial Judge has not considered the relevant\n\ndocuments to ascertain the actual income of the father and\n\nseeks an opportunity to produce more documents in\n\nsupport of her claim of maintenance for the daughter at a\n\nhigher rate and since the husband is also seeking\n\nopportunity to substantiate his claim that the wife is in\n\nearning hand, this court feels that justice will be sub-served,\n\nif the matter is sent back to the Court below for a fresh\n\ndecision on the said application.\n\nThe order impugned on the said ground is set aside\n\nwith the direction to the learned Trial Judge to decide the\n\nsaid application afresh expeditiously.\n\nHowever, to protect the interest of the child by\n\nconsent of the parties, the father is directed to pay a sum of\n\nRs. 18,000/- per month pending adjudication of the\n\n3\n\napplication under Section 151 of the Code.\n\nIt is made clear the father shall make such payment\n\nwithout prejudice to his rights and contentions in the\n\npending application under Section 151 of the Code of Civil\n\nProcedure and the payments to be made by him in terms of\n\nthis order shall be subject to the adjustment with the final\n\namount of maintenance of the minor that may be\n\ndetermined by the learned trial Judge on the said\n\napplication.\n\nMr. Saunak Bhattacharya, learned counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of the father/opposite party submits\n\nthat the application under Section 12 of the said Act filed by\n\nthe father in the main lis is pending since 2015 which needs\n\nto be disposed of expeditiously.\n\nThe learned trial Judge is requested that\n\nimmediately after disposal of the application under Section\n\n151 of the Code and on compliance of the order that may be\n\npassed on the said application under Section 151 of the\n\nCode, shall dispose of the application under Section 12 of\n\nthe said Act expeditiously.\n\nWith the above, C.O. No. 2487 of 2019 is disposed\n\nof.\n\nThere will be no order as to costs.\n\nUrgent Photostat certified copy of this order, if\n\napplied for, be supplied to the parties subject to compliance\n\n4\n\nwith all requisite formalities."
