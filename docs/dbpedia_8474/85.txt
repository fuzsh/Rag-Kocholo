THROUGH NEW DAMAGE RECORDS IN CANADA

CHECK OUT THE NEW TRACK “THIS THROAT’S FOR SMOKIN’” PREMIERING ON EXCLAIM! HERE and below.

(May 9, 2013 – Toronto, ON) Hardcore, punk band Cunter have just revealed the details of their latest full-length album. The album titled 27, which refers to the number of songs the band has written to date, is scheduled for release on June 25 through New Damage Records (KEN mode, Wilson) in Canada. The album will be available both digitally and as a limited edition 7”. To give fans a taste of the new record, Cunter has partnered up with Exclaim! for an exclusive premiere of the bands debut track “This Throat’s For Smokin’”. To check it out click below.

Cunter’s band motto is simple: “All intensity, All the time”. They write short punk/hardcore songs with such “ferocious intensity that the listener is left feeling violated and abused. There is no mercy. No time to recover.” It’s a sonic assault to the senses that will pummel the listener into the ground.

Formed in 2009, Cunter is made up of Erik Hughes (Moneen), Kenny Bridges (Moneen), Jordan Hastings (Alexisonfire), Greg Dawson (Haitian Knife Fight/BWC Studios) and Billy Curtiss (The Abandoned Hearts Club). The bands first EP’s were released on 7″ vinyl, by Dine Alone Records. This was followed by the release of their first full-length CD titled 10, and the follow up record titled 20.

27 is both relentless in its intensity and arguably Cunter’s fastest and most crushing record to date. Prepare yourself for mass destruction of short, epic proportions.
