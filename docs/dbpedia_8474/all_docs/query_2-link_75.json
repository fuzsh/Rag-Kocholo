The 6,700 SF facility frames the eastern side of an underutilized courtyard just south of Storrs Hall (the site of another firm project, the renovation of the College of Arts and Architecture Dean’s Suite). Members of the marching band are now able to securely store their instruments, change and practice within the high bay structure. The proportions and scale of the predominantly masonry building are influenced by the adjacent buildings, and an expanse of glass at the main entry opens the practice room to the adjacent lawn."
