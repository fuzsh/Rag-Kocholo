        "text": "August 15 / HeyArlo\n\nHEYARLO is an instrumental indy-jazz group based out of Minneapolis, MN. The group is fronted by DeCarlo Jackson on Flugelhorn and supported by Megan Mahoney on Bass, Evan Slack on Guitar, and Richard Haneman on drums. Each member is very active in the Twin Cities music scene and can be seen and heard playing with notable groups such as Hippocampus, Sid Sriram, Lissie, Boyish, Honeybutter and more. (Jazz)\n\nAugust 22 / Rogue Valley\n\nRogue Valley is an Americana band based in the Twin Cities where the blend of urban development and natural landscape converge along the shores of the Mississippi River. The band raced onto the local scene a little over a decade ago, with 4 full-length albums in a single year and in 2016 the band followed up with the anthemic, twangy surf-rock collection radiate/dissolve. However, since then it’s been mostly sporadic social media posts claiming “Coming Soon.”\n\nNow the hum of optimism surrounding new music is beginning its tangible crescendo. The first single from Rogue Valley’s upcoming set, titled “Twin Parallel,” will go live this Spring on June 2nd, with a new single to be released every three weeks until the album drops in-full later this Fall, on October 13th. The new album, titled Shell Game, is a nod to natural and created structures that both contain and obscure. (Indie Rock)"
