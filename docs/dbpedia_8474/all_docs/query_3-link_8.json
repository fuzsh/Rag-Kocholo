        "text": "About The Show\n\nJake Thistle (born March 19, 2004) is an American singer-songwriter and performing musician. Originally from Paramus, New Jersey. His first album, Down The Line, debuted 2020. Thistle self-produced the album as a result of the pandemic delaying a studio deal he initially had in place for the album. Down The Line was well-received, and American Songwriter| magazine proclaimed that “At 16, Jake Thistle Could Be The Next Generation’s Classic Singer/Songwriter,” and that “Thistle’s music oozes an authenticity and depth that should make modern folk legends like Jason Isbell and Jeff Tweedy smile. His vocals, delivered with sincerity and just the right amount of rasp, recall early Jackson Browne, John Hiatt, Steve Forbert and Tom Petty.” Thistle’s first song released under the Gold’n Retreiver label, Ghosted Road, earned highly positive reviews from industry publications, and garnered the 2022 Best Americana Song Of The Year honors from Indie Boulevard Magazine. The follow-up single, The Dreamer, was similarly well-reviewed. Alchemical Records noted that “Few singer songwriters have the breadth and depth of Jackson Browne…It is highly possible that we are witnessing the rise of his modern day counterpart through the music of New Jersey-based recording artist Jake Thistle.”\n\nWoodbridge Township presents Jake Thistle Band at The Avenel Performing Arts Center with support from Woodbridge Arts."
