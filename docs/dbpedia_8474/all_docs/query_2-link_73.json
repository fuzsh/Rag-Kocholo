        "text": "About Us â€” Join Band!\n\nThe Big Red Pep Band provides musical entertainment at all Men's home Hockey games and at other sporting events including Men's and Women's Basketball, Women's Hockey, Sprint Football and Men's and Women's Lacrosse. The Pep Band also travels to Men's Hockey regular season away games and to Hockey, Basketball and Lacrosse playoffs in the Spring.\n\nWant to see us play? Want to join the band? Check out our Schedule to see when and where we will be performing! If you would like to join, just come to any rehearsal in the Fischell Band Center on Mondays from 4:45pm - 6:00pm. To join our email list for weekly schedules and other announcements, email our secretary, Erik \"Grapefruit\" Bermudez. For more details about the inner workings of the pep band, check out our constitution.\n\nThe Pep Band uses a points system based on attendance at games, practice, and other events to determine which members can attend men's hockey games, as only a certain number of tickets are allocated to the band.\n\n\"Give My Regards to Davy\" is the official Cornell fight song. The Pep Band plays it when the team comes out and, for many sports, after the team scores.\n\nDuring lacrosse games, when Big Red scores ten points the Pep Band plays Give My Regards to Davy, the fight song, in three-four time rather than four-four. At fifteen points and above, they continue to improvise Davy in other ways.\n\nOne of the Pep Band's most popular songs, it is usually played right before the last segment of the game. It is also, on occasion, used during time outs or before overtime periods. During the song, band members and other spectators do a dance shown below. At the end of playing the \"Hey!\" song, the band (and often times the crowd as well) yells at the other team \"We're gonna beat the hell outta you! Rough 'em up! Rough 'em up! Go CU!\"\n\nWhenever Cornell wins, the Pep Band stays after and plays a song in celebration. In honor of the Men's Hockey coach, Mike Schafer, the Pep Band plays a version of Schaefer Beer's theme song (singing different words) when the Men's Hockey team wins. Additionally, the BRPB plays Birdland when the Women's Hockey team wins and Paradise City for Men's Lacrosse.\n\nAfter Cornell victories, as the Pep Band walks back to the band room or the bus, many members play a set of 'walking songs'.\n\nHire the BRPB For a Performance\n\nWe love playing at sporting events, university programs, banquets, and even weddings! Please let us know what occasion you would like us to perform for and we would be happy to accommodate you. We can offer anywhere between one to over 60 players at your event. Email the manager for rates and more information. Feel free to check out our pictures and videos to see what we look like while performing!\n\nContact our Manager!"
