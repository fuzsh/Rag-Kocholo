Though Stuart built his early reputation backing up country and bluegrass royalty, it wasn’t long before Nashville recognized him as a star in his own right, and over the course of forty-plus years as a solo artist, he would go on to release more than twenty major label albums, scoring platinum sales, hit singles, and just about every honor the industry could bestow along the way.\n\nMarty Stuart and His Fabulous Superlatives Concert @ 7:30 p.m.\n\nPrice:\n\nAdult Ticket – $35.00 plus fees.
