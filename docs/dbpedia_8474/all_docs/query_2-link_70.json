        "text": "Ravi Coltrane settles into his week as Resident Artistic Director with a pair of cutting-edge bands that focus on his original compositions. His trio is a decidedly electrified distillation of the young band from his Cosmic Music project featuring keyboardist Gadi Lehavi and drummer Elé Howell. His veteran acoustic quartet, now dubbed Coltraxx, includes pianist David Virelles, bassist Dezron Douglas, and drummer Johnathan Blake.\n\nAn artist whose career occupies a singular niche in modern jazz, Ravi Coltrane has established a sound and concepts that stand undeniably on their own, extending far beyond the shadow of his iconic name. Early experience in John Coltrane Quartet drummer Elvin Jones’ Jazz Machine and maverick saxophonist Steve Coleman’s M-Base movement helped build Coltrane’s expansive aesthetic, leading to a procession of increasingly audacious recordings as a leader and collaboration with artists ranging from his mother, harpist and pianist Alice Coltrane, and cousin, iconoclastic producer Flying Lotus, to pianist Chick Corea, trumpeter Terence Blanchard, and drummer Jack DeJohnette. In 2014, Coltrane curated a week of SFJAZZ performances celebrating the 50th anniversary of the recording of his father’s masterpiece A Love Supreme."
