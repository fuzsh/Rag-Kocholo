        "text": "The Vickie & Gene Johnson Marching Band Center is home to the UNC Charlotte “Pride of Niner Nation” Marching Band – one of a few buildings in the nation dedicated exclusively to a marching band!\n\nThe 6,700 square foot building houses a conference room, music library and four offices for the band staff. It also includes restrooms, a storage room for drumline and colorguard equipment, and ample space to store musical instruments and uniforms for the entire marching band. The band began performing in Fall 2015 with 149 members.\n\nJohnson Band Center (JBC) was designed by the award-winning architecture firm Watson Tate Savory. Over the past five years, Watson Tate Savory has earned fifteen awards for their designs for the University of South Carolina (USC), South Carolina State University, Midlands Technical College, USC Beaufort and the College of Charleston. Among their most recent designs are those for USC’s new Indoor Football Practice Facility.\n\n“This beautiful building is nestled in the woods behind the Storrs Building, adjacent to the new Levine Student Garden and Robinson Hall for the Performing Arts, and will quickly become a hub of activity,” says Dr. Lee Gray, senior associate dean of the College of Arts + Architecture and an architectural historian. “The design reflects the architectural characteristics of Storrs Hall and Robinson Hall, and the building will serve as an architectural landmark for patrons going to and from events in the College of Arts + Architecture.”"
