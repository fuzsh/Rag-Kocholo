        "text": "Cinderella’s Tom Keifer Band will perform live at the Brown County Music Center in Nashville, Ind., as part of the LIVE LOUD TOUR on Thursday, August 22, 2024, with Faster Pussycat. The high energy show will combine all the classic, chart-topping hits of Cinderella with new faves from #keiferband releases.\n\nTom Keifer remains a resilient, relevant figure in the rock world through constant reimagination and renewal. His story begins as the singer-songwriter, guitarist and frontman of hard rock heavyweights Cinderella. His signature voice and guitar, and bluesy, no-BS arena-shaking songwriting, were integral in moving 15 million records worldwide. Over the past decade, Keifer transitioned his talents to a solo career, enjoying continued success recording and touring with #keiferband. #keiferband is Tom Keifer, Savannah Keifer, Tony Higbee, Billy Mercer, Jarred Pope, Kory Myers, and Tanya Davis. Two critically acclaimed albums have been released to date: THE WAY LIFE GOES (2013) and RISE (2019). In 2023, the band celebrated its 10 year anniversary milestone with plenty of high energy, eardrum-shattering shows on their LIVE LOUD TOUR.\n\nFaster Pussycat rose from the depths of the mid-‘80s Hollywood rock scene, taking the Sunset Strip by storm with a sound that wasn’t glam and wasn’t punk, but blistered somewhere in between. With an attitude and swagger all its own, their self-titled debut featured the instant classics “Babylon,”“Bathroom Wall,” “Cathouse” and “Don’t Change That Song,” and its follow-up ‘Wake Me When It’s Over’ climbed even higher with the radio hit “House Of Pain,” “Poison Ivy” and “Where There’s A Whip There’s A Way.” Despite their successes, Faster defied the mainstream mold and always followed frontman Taime Downe’s underground sensibilities. The gold and platinum records are nice, but Taime considers his greatest accomplishment to be longevity. “The only number that really matters to me is the number 35. Three and half decades later, Faster Pussycat are still rocking, and it feels as fresh as it did in 1986.” Look no further than their 2021 releases “Nola” and the Johnny Thunders cover “Pirate Love” – Faster Pussycat are as virile and tenacious as ever... and won’t have it any other way.\n\nLocated in the Brown County Music Center\n\n200 Maple Leaf Boulevard\n\nNashville, Indiana 47448\n\nboxoffice@browncountymusiccenter.com\n\n(812) 988-5323 ext. 1\n\nThe Brown County Music Center Box Office is currently open for in-person sales via outdoor ticketing windows:\n\nTuesdays through Fridays 10 am to 5 pm, (on event days, box office will close 30 minutes after headliner begins)\n\nSaturdays through Mondays open only event days (3 pm until 30 minutes after headliner begins)\n\n*Hours may differ during inclement weather events and holiday weeks, please check our social media pages for updated hours surrounding holidays and weather.\n\nTickets can be purchased anytime on our website and at Ticketmaster.com.
