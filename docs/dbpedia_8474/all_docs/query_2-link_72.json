This guide highlights great starting points for bands or musicians and explores Squarespace's features for uploading music, connecting social media, and selling merchandise online.\n\nTip: For even more advice and options, visit this post on the Squarespace Forum: Make A Website That Rocks - The Musicians Guide To Building A Squarespace Website.\n\nWatch a video\n\nThis video applies to version 7.1.\n\nStart with an entertainment design\n\nWhile all Squarespace sites have the built-in design tools to make a unique, striking musician or band site, you may want to start with a design from the Entertainment category of the template store. These designs showcase your music and help fans find tour dates and order merchandise.\n\nTo learn more, visit Choosing the right template.\n\nShare songs\n\nYou can share individual tracks on your site by uploading them to audio blocks. These blocks appear as a customizable player, and you can add them to any content area on your site. This is a great option for showing off new singles, remixes, or other audio files.\n\nYou can also use SoundCloud blocks to embed tracks or playlists from your SoundCloud directly to your site. This way, visitors can listen to your SoundCloud content without leaving your site.\n\nPromote your music with engaging content\n\nYou can use our Marketing Kit in the iOS Squarespace app to offer a sneak peek into new songs or live performances.\n\nThen export your content and share it on your site or on social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, or Facebook.\n\nSell merchandise\n\nYou can sell t-shirts, albums, downloads, posters, and more using Squarespace commerce features. Visit Getting started with Squarespace Commerce to learn more.\n\nList gigs and tour dates\n\nUse an events page to list upcoming shows, tours, and appearances. After you've added events, you can showcase these events elsewhere on your site, such as your homepage, using a summary block or calendar block.\n\nIf you have a Bandsintown profile, you can display live stream, tour, or festival dates on your site by adding a Bandsintown Block to any page.\n\nCommunicate with your fans\n\nKeep your fans informed about new music, shows, and merchandise with Squarespace Email Campaigns or our EZ Text extension.\n\nSend emails using Email Campaigns\n\nBuild mailing lists and send email campaigns to stay in touch with your fans. Follow our Email campaign best practices to ensure your campaigns are effective and reach your audience. To learn more about sending on-brand emails, visit Getting started with Squarespace Email Campaigns.\n\nSend text promotions using extensions\n\nSend text promotions and notifications to your fans in minutes by connecting the EZ Text extension. While we work with third-party services to ensure Squarespace extensions work properly, extensions fall outside our scope of support. We can help with connecting or disconnecting your extensions. For all other questions, contact the extensions provider directly.\n\nConnect your social media and streaming pages\n\nDisplay content from social media on your site or automatically push content from your site to social platforms by connecting your social accounts. You can display icons for these social platforms in your site header or a social links block.\n\nIf your music is available on a streaming service, you can add icons that link to your pages on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, and Spotify.\n\nNext steps"
