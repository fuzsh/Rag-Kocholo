        "text": "Canadian hardcore punk band\n\nCunter (formerly known as Hunter[1]) is a five-piece hardcore punk supergroup from Brampton, Ontario whose members are from Moneen, Alexisonfire, BWC Studios and The Abandoned Hearts Club. The band motto is \"All intensity, all the time,\" and they are known for short, ferociously intense songs.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nKenny Bridges and Erik Hughes are members of Moneen, which is a rock band. Hughes, Bridges told an interviewer, \"has a great scream\" and they, along with BWC Studios producer Greg Dawson, mused about starting a punk rock band, as a side project. On November 1, 2009, Bridges called Dawson to say that they should go ahead, and found that Dawson had already written nine songs. Bridges wrote the tenth; Hughes wrote the lyrics in one evening. They recruited two friends: Alexisonfire drummer Jordan Hastings and The Abandoned Hearts Club guitarist Billy Curtiss.[3]\n\nWhen they couldn't come up with a name, they borrowed the name of Hughes’ son and called the band 'Hunter'. A Polish band with the same name threatened to sue so, as of May 11, 2011, the band's name became Cunter.[4][5][6]\n\nThe band’s first EPs were released on 7-inch vinyl by Dine Alone Records. They name their releases according to the number of songs they've recorded; their first EPs were 4, and 8.[7][8] In 2010, they released their first full-length CD, 10 and, in 2011, 20 (sometimes seen with the sub-title 'Some Really Nice Guy Threatened To Sue Us And Made Us Change Our Name').[9][10] In 2013, they released 27, this time on New Damage Records.[11]\n\nCunter played most of its shows in and around Toronto; they've played club dates and took part in the 2011 Warped Tour.[12][13][14]\n\nThe band has been inactive since 2013. In 2020, Jordan Hastings said that this is because everyone's so busy, but that he would like to make another Cunter album.[15]\n\nMembers\n\n[edit]\n\nKenny Bridges – bass, originally from Moneen\n\nBilly Curtiss – guitar, originally from The Abandoned Hearts Club\n\nGreg Dawson – guitar, originally from Haitian Knife Fight / BWC Studios\n\nJordan Hastings – drums, originally from Alexisonfire\n\nErik Hughes – vocals, originally from Moneen\n\nLive members\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorge Pettit – vocals, originally from Alexisonfire\n\nAaron Wolff – vocals, originally from The End\n\nChris \"Hippy\" Hughes – guitar, originally from Moneen\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nDate of release Title Record label Pressing Notes June 16, 2009 4 Dine Alone Records 502 / Black September 8, 2009 8 Dine Alone Records 505 / Black April 17, 2010 10 Dine Alone Records 300 / CD Ltd Record Store Day release June 13, 2011 20 Dine Alone Records June 25, 2013 27 New Damage Records\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
