        "text": "Have you also been wondering what the fuck is happening with .Moneen.?\n\nWell given the following facts:\n\nMoneen hasn’t toured since they released “The World I want to leave behind”\n\nMoneen is no longer listed as Active on either Vagrant or Smallman Records\n\nKenny Bridges is in Cunter, Hippy is in Seas and I think Erik is in Cunter as well.\n\nMoneens own website is down\n\nMultiple members have had kids\n\nKenny and Hippy are in a new band\n\nSales on the new album didn’t reach expectations, and long-time fans have been pushed away from the drastic change in delivery. No more extended breakdowns with complex harmonies, no more 3/4 let alone other strange time signatures and the drumming sounds so blah it could be just drum loops from a VST. It’s too bad they lost Peter. Their sound has obviously suffered.\n\nthey haven’t spent even a remotely comparable amount of time engaging their fan base, and have for the most part let themselves fade into obscurity.\n\nWhile “The World I….” was a great Album, it had that essence of a breakup album. And the more time passes by I think its the longest its been since a release from the boys.\n\nSo again, Canada loses yet another band which broke the mold and delivered some of the greatest music to come out of this Country. The Demise of Moneen, Choke and (Passenger Action) leaves only one hope, the final union of Choke and Moneen members which would create one of the greatest possible unification of musicians since …. Choneen.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’m not hating on Moneen, and I loved their new album when I taught myself to give it a listen as a piece of work and not a piece of moneen. It’s good for what it is and Glasshouse really brings forth the old sound under new production methods. I don’t know what if any bands will replace the constant rotation that even the Theory of Harmonial Value has had on my listening list, but I find that it’s getting harder and harder to find bands that are still active which have the skillets and ambition to stay true to their roots and release music that doesn’t have to conform to some shitty in house producers money making ideology.\n\nSo R.I.P Moneen, it was a fucking blast. I’ll never forget the tour of 99(?) featuring Choke, Moneen, Layaway Plan. Probably one of the best Canadian tours of all time. Those who experienced it were lucky as fuck.\n\n-C"
