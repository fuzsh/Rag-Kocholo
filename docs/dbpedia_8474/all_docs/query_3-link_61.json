        "text": "A pre-show dinner and band meet-and-greet is available for $60\n\nTickets are on sale for the grand opening concert at the Beaver Borough Community Center.\n\n\"The Kenny Rogers Band presents Through the Years,\" a tribute show fronted by Don Gatlin, will christen the center's outdoor stage on July 13.\n\nThe band includes guitarist Randy Dorman, keyboardist Steve Glassmeyer and bassist Chuck Jacobs, all key parts of the touring group during superstar Rogers' late-1970s/1980s reign on the country and adult contemporary charts, The band also includes Gene Sisk, Brian Franklin and Mike Zimmerman who played with Rogers for 24, 19 and seven years, respectively, as well as touring with Crystal Gayle, Alan Jackson, Tracy Byrd and other country stars.\n\nGatlin, a Blackhawk High graduate, opened 66 shows for Rogers as frontman for Nashville country-rock band Savannah Jack. Gatlin also wrote \"Something's Wrong in Vegas\" and \"I Won't Forget,\" two songs recorded by Rogers and likely to be played during the Beaver show.\n\nLocated outside the former Beaver pool house, this premiere night concert costs $30 for a seat, $25 if you bring your own chair and $200 for a table of four near the stage. Call 724-650-3960 to reserve your spot.\n\nConcert organizer Larry Renninger says around 870 seats will be available for the 7 p.m. show that begins with local singer-songwriter Jarrod Craiger.\n\nThe concert represents an exciting homecoming for Gatlin, who began his career paired with brother Darryl Gatlin. Together they landed a few singles on the national country charts in 1992.\n\n\"Being a lifelong Kenny Rogers fan growing up in Beaver County − with Kenny being the biggest country popstar in the world − I never dreamed I would meet him, yet alone travel the world and write two songs for him, but it happened,\" Gatlin said via text message.\n\nWhile toiling as a Nashville songwriter and frontman of Savannah Jack, Gatlin's \"Something's Wrong in Vegas\" caught the attention of Rogers.\n\n\"He asked us to come in the studio and sing it with him, which led to him asking us to open for him on tour,\" Gatlin said. \"That changed everything and put Savannah Jack on the map.\"\n\nSubsequent Savannah Jack national tours included visits to the Lincoln Park Performing Arts Center in Midland. Gatlin also was at the mic when Through The Years played a show last May at Beaver Falls Middle School.\n\nRogers retired in 2018. A year later, Gatlin literally woke up in the middle of the night with the idea of getting together with Rogers' seasoned band to perform shows celebrating the music legend.\n\n\"And after one rehearsal, we all knew this was something special and a true labor of love,\" Gatlin said, \"not some cheesy tribute with someone dressing up like Kenny and growing a gray beard with no connection to the man whatsoever. This is the Kenny Rogers Band.\n\n\"One of the greatest honors I have ever had was when we reached out to Kenny and he totally endorsed the show and gave us everything we needed; video footage, endorsement of the show, etc.,\" Gatlin said.\n\nSome of that video footage will be shown at the Beaver concert.\n\nRogers died in March 2020 at the age of 81, having gifted the world such classic songs as \"Lucille,\" \"Daytime Friends,\" \"The Gambler,\" \"You Decorated My Life,\" \"Coward of the County,\" \"Lady,\" \"Islands in The Stream\" and the 1967 psychedelic-rock gem \"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In.\")\n\nWhatever songs Rogers regularly played live, his band − veterans of NBC's \"The Tonight Show,\" the Grammys and country music award shows − is prepared to perform it in Beaver.\n\n\"This show is perfect for the diehard Kenny Rogers fan, but also perfect for someone who just wants to be entertained and have a great time,\" Gatlin said. \"It is a high-energy show with lots of great music and personal stories that we can share with the audience because we were there with the legend, Kenny Rogers.\"\n\nThere will be pre-show meet-and-greet with Gatlin and the band July 13 inside the Beaver Borough Community Center. That includes a light buffet dinner starting at 5 p.m., with limited seating for 125 at $60 a plate.\n\nIt remains to be seen how many future concerts at Beaver Borough Community Center are likewise ticketed, or free.\n\n\"Smaller groups can use the stage and do their own concerts by contacting the borough,\" Renninger said. \"This venue is for all of Beaver County to enjoy and promote our local talent.\"\n\nThough, Renninger said he and Gatlin hope to bring other nationally known acts there, too. On Friday, well-known Pittsburgh concert promoter Rich Engler is scheduled to tour the stage and community center.\n\nThe center's indoor event space, which can seat about 160, is being painted presently and having air conditioning vents installed. When ready, it can be rented for events, parties and meetings.\n\nA separate project aligning Beaver Borough, Beaver County Foundation, and community members serving on the Shaw Park Committee aims to raise money to construct a new pool in adjacent Shaw Park. Updates and details are at shawparkbeaver.org.\n\nBeaver's outdoor pool closed in 2020 after borough officials determined necessary repairs would be too costly. Officials agreed to save the pool house structure itself, which has been renovated to become the new concert stage and event center.\n\nScott Tady is entertainment editor at The Times and easy to reach at stady@gannett.com."
