        "text": "Center Band\n\nCenter Band\n\nSofia\n\nThe genesis of the Bulgarian band Center, in its present form, was set in 2010. Since then, its members are: Teodor Nedev â guitar, Delyan Karaivanov â guitar, Nikolay Slavov â bass guitar, and Simeon Panov - drums. The band name â Center â was established as a concept â a linguistic packaging of the concentrated energy and the targeted sounding of the four. The guys quickly established a bond between each other, and after only a few months of sharing ideas, and recording a few demo tracks, they set a striking beginning of their media presence, by participating in the contest of Jack Daniels â Battle of the Bands, and winning it. For just a few months the band repertoire grew up to about ten mighty and memorable instrumental compositions, and the next step was logical â a series of concerts and participations in festivals, such as Impossible Fest, Alarma Punk Jazz, etc. In 2011 they made a tour around the country (Bulgaria) and played at a number of music clubs in Varna, Stara Zagora, Plovdiv, Veliko Tarnovo and Sofia. In the past two years the boys have warmed up the stage for multiple famous Bulgarian rock bands, as well as for foreign bands, such as Talbot and Radare. They gain the audience with their uncommon sound, which entwines alternative metal and riff-based stoner rock. The interest towards the band grew fast, and in August 2011, Center got up on Jack Danielâs Rock Stage on the festival Spirit of Burgas. In the autumn of the same year they played on the same stage with the first stoner rock band, which performed in solo concert in Bulgaria â the Greek rock furies of 1000mods. After multiple mighty shows, in the spring of 2012 Center started working on their first professional recordings. In the meantime, they made one more striking performance on another memorable festival, organized by the webzine RawkânâRoll, named A New Day Dawning. At that show Center shared the stage with Bulgarian bands such as Smallman and Vrani Volosa. You can find more information about the band in the facebook profile of Center.
