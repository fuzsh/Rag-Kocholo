It ranges from Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, Joplin, Gershwin and Ellington, to ballet, opera and Schickele. The ensemble never ignored an opportunity to relate to its audience. This brought the Brass to international attention. They were at first criticized for talking to audiences, and now take pride in seeing the entire concert world embracing engagement as a fundamental element of performance.\n\nThe Brass has averaged two and a half full length recordings per year in the last 52 years. They have a total of 138 recordings. They received a combined total of 24 Grammy and Juno nominations."
