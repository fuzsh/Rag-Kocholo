        "text": "Passenger Action. The best shit since sliced bread, Choke and .Moneen. Never had a chance.\n\nChoke laid down the foundation of technical punk rock, technical punk rock that didn’t just sound like noise and maintained a message within its complicated structure, catchy portions and poetic lyrics.\n\nWhen Choke broke-up legions of fans across the Country shed a tear at their final show. However with the announcement of ex-members forming Passenger Action a new hope emerged in the Canadian Punk Rock Scene.\n\nTheir first album, sounding hastily produced on a low budget still had that same old vibe of Choke, before they got kind of strange post-‘Forward’. It was like a logical progression from ‘Needless to Say’ and perhaps if Choke had gone in this direction after ‘Needless to Say’ they would of never released the Epic yet Band Destroying Album ‘Forward’. Needless to say was a skatepunk release of technicalities that made even well-established bands press stop, rewind and hear that fill/drop/harmony again. It was epic, the lyrics made a statement of how the youth of Canada felt, and it wasn’t just a blanket statement of teenage angst. It was the truth, it was the frustration of pickup truck driving jocks beating up queers, it was about the frustration of being pushed into OSAP and a lifetime of debt to obtain a job putting in 2/3rds of your life somewhere you hate that brings you down day by day until you turn into a tax paying Robot contributing money to the system and pushing out 1.5 kids. We all wanted something more, some utopic view of society in which ideals and morality existed and we would see the corrupt world for what it was.\n\nWith the impending doom of skatepunk and the obvious influence of metal on Chokes earlier work ‘Forward’ was still a total kick in the ass. I couldn’t name a more technical album if I tried. The lyrics were poetic and undeniably moving. The complexity of the time signatures, song structures and final tracking was nothing short of absolutely stunning. Forward is the kind of album that created die-hard lifetime fans that would expect nothing short of a progression from this piece of artwork and there was a clear and obvious disappointment in their follow up album. While still a great piece of work in its own right, it left the fans following up from ‘Forward’ feeling cheated.\n\nIt’s clear that support of the follow up to Forward (There’s a Story to This Moral) wasn’t what the band or label expected, and it was most likely during this time that long time and original drummer Stephan decided to leave, and Shawn + Claw created Passenger Action while Jack left for Team Building. Their final Album; How I learned to Question Infinity was an obvious breakup album. The lyrics dug deep into the turmoil that lead up to this point in their career. With songs explaining the desperation of facing a life crisis and realizing that what you intended to do forever did not become a realization. There was disappointment, a statement that static would remain, we would trace rewind, and breathing wouldn’t come easy.\n\nWhen Passenger Action posted their first few songs on MySpace Choke fans rejoiced, it was the good old Choke, and while P.A would probably want nothing more than to distance themselves from this weight on their back they produced exactly what Choke fans wanted. A return to the Needless to Say style with a more modern day implementation stemming from the obvious experimentation in Slow Fade; Or How I Learned to Question Infinity.\n\nHaving seen Choke live more times than I can count I can tell you that just listening to their music will never give you the experience, the moment they kicked in you felt a vibe hit the room and a feeling that could never be experienced in any other way. You saw the hearts of men devoted to their music. Their veins would swell and sweat would soak their clothes within minutes of starting to play, it was nothing short of a magical experience that few can say they got to experience, but will remember for the rest of their lives. When I saw Passenger Action is was nothing short of relieving when this same performance quality was observed and you saw that same passion come out. However, it’s clear that the generation gap between 90s skatepunk and the incarnation of Passenger Action didn’t sit well. The one show I saw was filled with only ex-Choke fans, and while we were all blown away we were all frustrated to see that so little had known, experienced or seen this band. This band that delivered the same passion filled experience to a crowd most bands would play a half set too and just fuck off.\n\nIt’s a real shame that Choke and moving forward Passenger Action never saw major label success, and it’s more a shame that 20 years from now they will be little more than a memory to the few that experienced them live. I’ll never forget October 1999, Choke, Strung Out, Mad Caddies and Seven Layers. We had all gone to see Strung Out and Mad Caddies but entered during Chokes set. To this day I’ve never experienced or been near anything as influential. Their final goodbye show in Edmonton clearly shows this as everyone comes on stage for a tearful goodbye to one of the best kept secrets in North American Music while bands like Nickleback pull in millions ripping off those that came before them. It’s a fucking shame that bands with incredible talent, a message and heart succumb to the abyss while jock rock crapshoots like Nickleback become rich releasing talentless, emotionless and meaningless music that absolutely turns the stomachs of anyone who can play a musical instrument.\n\nWhile Passenger Action, like .Moneen. Hasn’t officially announced their retirement, it’s obvious with their statement of Hiatus. It’s also clear with their inability to keep a steady line-up across a min. of two albums. Do yourself a favour and pick up their two releases, Acoustic Blueprints and their Self-Titled off Smallman Records before they are out of print. This is not a band you can torrent, and not only will you not be disappointed, but you will experience something that makes you part of a rare community of people that got to experience something with meaning.\n\nR.I.P\n\nI hope, with all my heart that Shawn of P.A and Choke will release music in the future. Perhaps the timing of Moneen and P.A’s demise is a sign of a coming together of two amazing bands, Kenny Bridges of Moneen did work on Passenger Actions last album. Furthermore, the two bands have an extensive history of touring together, performing as one (Choneen) and being respected by their fans throughout their careers. My biggest hope of all is that they finally get the recognition they deserve.\n\n-c"
