        "text": "CONTINGENCY OPERATING BASE BASRA, Iraq â€” For what many believe to be the first time in history, an Army band performed on a United States Navy destroyer in the Persian Gulf, Aug. 26.\n\nThe 34th Infantry Division band, Center Mass, concluded their week-long tour of the gulf after playing five shows in four locations. The band played at Umm Qasr, the Al Basrah Oil Terminal, on the USS Decatur and at Camp Bucca, before returning to Contingency Operating Base Basra, Aug. 30.\n\nThe highlight of the trip for many of the band members was performing for the Sailors stationed aboard the USS Decatur, which is currently pulling security around the Al Basrah Oil Terminal in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\n\"That was the best thing this week, playing on the Decatur,\" said Sgt. Ryan Lodgaard, drummer for Center Mass. \"I know guys in the Navy who have never been on a ship and I got the opportunity to go out and play on one.\"\n\n\"I never thought in a million years I would play on a Navy destroyer for the Army,\" said Lodgaard, a St. Paul, Minn. resident. \"It's a once in a lifetime opportunity and one I won't soon forget.\"\n\nMany of the Decatur's crew members and the members of Center Mass believe this is the first occasion an Army band has performed on a Navy ship at sea and according to Sgt. Dave Woychek, the keyboardist for Center Mass, it wasn't easy getting there.\n\n\"We had a lot of mishaps and interesting experiences trying to get out here,\" the Winona, Minn. resident said in reference to the band being stuck at sea for a few hours after the boat they were on broke down the day before.\n\nThe members of the band were determined to get out to the Decatur and perform for the Sailors, who often miss out on United Service Organization tours, regardless of whatever mishaps delayed them.\n\n\"We decided when we came to Iraq that the large [forward operating bases] get a lot of USO tours,\" Woychek said, \"so we made it our main goal to get out to the smaller FOBs and patrol bases, and in this case ships to play for the guys who deserve it most, the guys who don't get any entertainment.\"\n\n\"As an Army band, we don't need the force protection required by USO tours to go to the smaller FOBs and play for the service members that don't get anything,\" said Sgt. 1st Class Timothy Johnson, bassist and team leader for Center Mass.\n\nJohnson, a Minneapolis resident said he enjoys getting out and seeing all the different FOBs and performing for the Soldiers who never get big name entertainers.\n\nThe high heat and humidity didn't keep the band from playing for the service members. After each show, although they were dripping in sweat, the look of satisfaction swept across their faces because they knew they had given their best and entertained the crowds.\n\n\"Although the heat and humidity was depressive,\" Lodgaard said, \"we pushed on and made it happen. Just knowing we are entertaining the service members who are in harm's way everyday makes it easier.\"\n\n\"It was an honor to get out and play for these guys,\" Lodgaard said. \"I saw a lot of smiles while performing this week. Being in a band is a great job to have for the Army.\"\n\n\"We take care of troops,\" Lodgaard said, \"that's what we do as a band.\""
