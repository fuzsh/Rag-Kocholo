        "text": "Band (MUEN 2121) is predominantly a marching band in the fall semester. The band is open to all student instrumentalists regardless of their major field of study. Organized in 1936, the Ranger Band is one of the most celebrated college bands in the nation, playing to standing ovations in Venezuela, France, Hong Kong, Macao, Korea and Romania, as well as the Cotton Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Shrine East-West Game, Kiwanis Bowl (Norfolk) and American All-Star Game (Tampa, Fla.).\n\nThe 100-member marching band has also appeared in the Macyâ€™s Thanksgiving Day Parade (six years), the Little Rose Bowl (Pasadena), the Eisenhower inaugural and others. The 20-member Stage Band has performed at many national association conventions.\n\nAuditions are available for band scholarships.\n\nFor wind instruments, students will be asked to demonstrate playing scales in various octaves. Students auditioning should prepare an etude from a Solo & Ensemble List (preferred is any year of the high school Region audition etudes).\n\nFor percussionists, please select two (snare drum, timpani, mallets or drum set) to demonstrate abilities.\n\nClick below to fill out an application."
