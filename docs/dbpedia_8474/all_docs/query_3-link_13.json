Bring your pup and lawn chair for some fun in the sun!\n\nThis show will feature boundary-pushing contemporary country singer Taylor Glasheen and the beautiful mix of Americana, bluegrass, and rock ‘n’ roll from Nolan McKelvey Band.\n\nTaylor Glasheen: noon to 1:30 p.m.\n\nTaylor Glasheen is a rising talent in the country music industry. Originally from Phoenix, Glasheen has established herself in modern country music with her alluring voice, which skillfully combines strength and sensitivity. Well known for her emotional lyrics and passionate performances, she has connected with audiences all over the nation.\n\nWith its roots firmly situated in the genre’s traditions, Glasheen’s music embraces the spirit of country music.

From the pavement of alt-country to the dusty trails of bluegrass and the gravel roads of classic country to the interstate highway of rock ‘n’roll, McKelvey has received critical acclaim along the way from magazines like No Depression, Country Standard Time, The Boston Phoenix, The Boston Globe, and Performer magazine, among many others. McKelvey has opened for musical luminaries like Greg Brown, Los Lobos, Sam Bush, Bela Fleck, Leon Russell, Gregory Alan Isakov, Son Volt, Josh Ritter, David Grisman, and many more. He performed in several bands in Boston and was dubbed “central to the [Boston] roots-rock revival” by WBUR radio."
