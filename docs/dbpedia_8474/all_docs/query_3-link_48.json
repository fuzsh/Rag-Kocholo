        "meta_description": "Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians: Home - The Band has inhabited the Lac du Flambeau area since 1745 when Chief Keeshkemun led the Band to the area. The Band acquired the name Lac du Flambeau from its gathering practice of harvesting fish at night by torchlight. The name Lac du Flambeau, or Lake of the Torches, refers to this practice and was given to the Band by the French traders and trappers who visited the area.\r\n\r\nThe Lac du Flambeau Reservation was officially established by the Treaty of 1854. The area was continually logged in the following years and became a tourist destination for families from southern Wisconsin and Illinois around the turn of the century.",
