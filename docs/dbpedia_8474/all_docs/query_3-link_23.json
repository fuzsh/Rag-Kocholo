        "text": "Each Spring, the Denver Concert Band invites local high school band students to compete for our annual Young Artist Award. The selected winner receives a scholarship, and will perform a solo piece with the band. Many past recipients have gone on to successful careers in music, playing in elite orchestras throughout the country, including our own Colorado Symphony. The winner of this yearâ€™s Young Artist Competition, Elise Luzietti, will be playing the Alexander Glazunov Concerto for Alto Saxophone.\n\nThe Denver Concert Band is an ensemble of about 90 adult musicians who have a passion for performing instrumental music. Entertaining audiences since 1968, the band is entering their 56th concert season. For more information, VISIT THEIR WEBSITE."
