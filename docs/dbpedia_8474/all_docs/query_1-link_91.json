        "text": "With this being my first piece for the Merritt Herald I was hoping for a big story. However there were just a few smaller stories so that is what I will give you.\n\nOn Saturday the Infinity Club based out of Vancouver stopped in Logan Lake on their day trip. Their trip included Merritt, Logan Lake, Ashcroft, Cache Creek, Whistler, Squamish, and then finished in Vancouver. Group member David Tam was the proud owner of the most interesting car of this group. He was driving a Nissan 420Ztt. For those of you like me who have no idea what that means it is a fancy car belonging in the Nissan Infinity family.\n\nThe Logan Lake Lions got to use and show off their state of the art BBQ as they made delicious hot dogs for the bikers who stopped in. Bikers from around British Columbia stopped in and enjoyed a hot dog and a nice cold drink. However a few late comers were out of luck as a thunderstorm rolled in during the afternoon and things had to close down early.\n\nAlso Saturday there was a two-car collision on the corner of Tunkwa Lake Road. and 97C. As a result both cars were towed from the scene. I am unaware of any injuries.\n\nLogan Lake Video Store just celebrated its 15th birthday. The owners have owned this local business for all of their fifteen years. When they started it was located in the Village Center Mall but they have changed locations and are now located just around the corner in the downtown core. Their party celebrations included delicious cup cakes, over two hundred balloons, and a trivia game. They also offered a free movie rental and had a draw for prizes. There were fourteen winners. People came out and enjoyed a good time. They did have outdoor games planned but due to the weather those had to be cancelled.\n\nSunday a beautiful mural went up on one of the outside walls of the Rec. Center. A Canadian muralist, Tyler Towes as well as Steven Skolka were the artists responsible. Tyler and Steven spent the day painting a beautiful scene of two hockey players skating on ice. These gentlemen started in the morning and by the evening were finished. They did a phenomenal job in such a short time. It is something truly beautiful to look at. Tyler and Steven have been painting murals around Canada for 11 years now.\n\nI am really looking forward to next weekâ€™s article as the Communities in Bloom judges will be here. It brings me great pleasure to be able to write for the paper and I am looking forward to the weeks that come."
