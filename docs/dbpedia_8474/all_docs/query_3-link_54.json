        "text": "Tedeschi Trucks Band is coming to TD Pavilion at the Mann on August 28!\n\nTedeschi Trucks Band(TTB) is a Grammy Award-winning 12-piece rock and soul powerhouse that holds the well-deserved reputation as one of the best live acts touring today. Led by husband & wife, guitarist Derek Trucks and singer/guitarist Susan Tedeschi - hailed as “two of the best roots rock musicians of their generation” (NPR), the 12-piece Tedeschi Trucks Band is known globally for their unmistakable sound and world-class musicianship that seamlessly blends distinctive genres of American music.\n\nSince forming in 2010, Tedeschi Trucks Band’s caravan has traveled countless miles to bring their music to audiences around the world. With a large catalog that spans rock, blues, jazz and even country, no setlist is ever the same, leaving their ever-growing fan base of all-ages returning again and again for electrifying performances. In the fall of 2023, Tedeschi Trucks Band played a pair of career-defining arena shows at TD Garden in Boston and a sold out Madison Square Garden in New York City. Dubbed “The Garden Parties” the pair of gigs saw praise from Relix who raved of the group's “seasoned grace and artistry.” From sold-out multi-night residencies across America to tours through Europe and Japan, to their flagship annual summer amphitheater tours, the band's shows are an eagerly anticipated highlight of the live music calendar and “nothing short of exhilarating” (Salon).\n\nTickets on sale now via Ticketmaster.com and the Mann's Ticket Office.\n\nBag Policy\n\nBags must be 12\"x6\"x12\" or smaller. For the safety of our patrons, all bags are subject to search."
