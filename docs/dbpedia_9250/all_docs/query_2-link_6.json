        "meta_description": "XMI led a photographic field survey of the ancient archaeological site at Hanlin in northern Myanmar (formerly known as Burma). Hanlin is part of Pyu Ancient Cities, designated UNESCO World Heritage Site #1444. This site compromises three brick, walled and moated cities located in vast irrigated landscapes of the Ayeyarwady River basin. The Pyu Kingdoms reigned for over 1,000 years. Excavated remains include palace citadels, burial grounds, brick Buddhist stupas, partly standing walls and water management features. XMI is honored to have photographs displayed and stored in the UNESCO archives which help preserve and promote the legacy of this incredible site.",
