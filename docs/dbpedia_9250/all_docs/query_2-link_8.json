        "text": "Arthur George Hamlin was born in 1855 and arrived in DeLand in 1883 as the town’s first attorney. He was the attorney for Henry DeLand, founder of the city, John B. Stetson and his business enterprises, and the DeLand Town Council. He was also the legal advisor to Henry Flagler and Joseph Parrot of the Florida East Coast Railway. In addition to his legal practice, he grew oranges and became an authority on citrus culture.\n\nA.G. Hamlin developed the Hamlin Orange, which remains one of Florida’s most popular oranges today. In 1879, Judge Isaac Stone planted a seedling in Deland, Florida (near Daytona Beach), and soon after, A. G. Hamlin bought the grove. After the big freezes of 1894-95, Hamlin performed extensive bud grafting to increase Hamlin oranges substantially.\n\nHamlin’s yield (annual total) is the highest and most consistent of all sweet oranges. Hamlin oranges were planted most extensively in Florida during the 1980s and 1990s, and they are the leading early-season juice orange in the state."
