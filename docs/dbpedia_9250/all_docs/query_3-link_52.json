        "meta_description": "Since the February 2021 military coup in Myanmar, the junta has driven the country further into a human rights and humanitarian catastrophe. Faced with opposition from the general population and anti-junta armed groups, the military has struggled to maintain control over the country. The junta’s widespread and systematic abuses against the population – including arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial killings, and indiscriminate attacks on civilians – amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes. The junta has kept in place a state of emergency imposed since the coup, and dozens of townships across the country are under martial law. Some countries have imposed targeted sanctions, but the international response to the crisis has not placed adequate pressure on the Myanmar military to end its abuses.   Available in မြန်မာနိုင်ငံ >>",

        "text": "Unknown Rohingya refugee (Voice over)\n\n[Please] open the road [border]. They [Myanmar military] are destroying everything. They are not listening to any governments. Thousands are being killed inside their houses. We do not know the count. Please look at today’s situation.\n\nText on screen\n\nThis video contains images of dead bodies and descriptions of violence. Viewer discretion advised.\n\nVoice Over\n\nThis video was filmed by a Rohingya refugee whose village was attacked by the Myanmar military in August 2017. He was pleading for media attention to get international help.\n\nFive years ago, Myanmar’s military launched a sweeping campaign of massacres, rape, and arson against the Rohingya, a Muslim minority who have lived for generations in Myanmar’s western Rakhine State. Security forces killed thousands of Rohingya in crimes against humanity and genocidal acts.\n\nHundreds of thousands fled to neighboring Bangladesh, while others remained under apartheid conditions.\n\nAbdul Halim\n\nWe walked for three days.\n\nResearcher (Voice Over)\n\nWalked for three days?\n\nAbdul Halim\n\nThe houses of our [village] were burned yesterday. An Islamic scholar from Tula Toli was shot dead.\n\nVoice Over\n\nThis is Abdul Halim with his mother. They are Rohingya refugees crossing into Bangladesh to escape the Myanmar military’s atrocities in 2017.\n\nThey were some of the 730,000 Rohingya who managed to reach refugee camps in Bangladesh, joining hundreds of thousands who had fled earlier violence.\n\nAbdul Halim\n\nWhen I was carrying my mother on my back, “My child, may you live long and never face any sorrow in your entire life. Might you have a perfect life.” my mother always blessed me.\n\nAfter arriving here in Bangladesh with my mother, at the hospital, the doctor said to me that her condition is not good, and she may not survive. My mother died on the 16th of Zil Hajj [Arabic lunar calendar].\n\nNow I have three children. The oldest is a daughter and the younger ones are sons.\n\nFor the past five years, the schools are not up to the standard for Rohingya children to attend. There is no formal schooling like classes 1, 2, 3, 4… so our children can’t be properly educated.\n\nIn Myanmar, they called me “Nowa kalar”, to say we are like animals. They could call us that because we had no education. Here too, we can’t give our children an education.\n\nVoice Over\n\nBangladesh banned all Rohingya-led schools in December 2021. Teachers and parents were threatened with relocation to Bhasan Char, an isolated island, or having their ID cards revoked. The Myanmar curriculum is now being introduced, but only up to Grade 9, and is not certified.\n\nFive years on from the atrocities against the Rohingya in Myanmar, nearly a million refugees live in overcrowded camps struggling to survive in increasingly repressive conditions.\n\nBangladesh should be recognized, and provided international support, for assisting Rohingya refugees.\n\nBangladesh authorities should respect the rights of Rohingya refugees to freedom of movement and access to work, education, and health care.\n\nIn August 2017, Myanmar security forces massacred and raped hundreds of men, women, and children in the village of Tula Toli.\n\nMohammad Ayaz was shot while trying to flee. At least 12 members of his family, including his parents, were killed.\n\nMohammad Ayaz\n\nOur mother and sisters were killed [in my village]. The houses were burned. They [soldiers] were shooting at us. Some of us with bullet wounds managed to escape to this area [Bangladesh].\n\nVoice Over\n\nMohammad is now 21, and lives in a refugee camp with his aunt and uncle.\n\nMohammad Ayaz\n\nBecause of sickness and the bullet wound, I’m not able to do any heavy work. I don’t know what to do.\n\nThe hospital here only prescribes paracetamol, but that doesn’t help cure me. We need to go to Cox’s Bazar or Palong Khali, but that would cost us a lot of money. The hospital inside the camp doesn’t provide proper health care.\n\nVoice Over\n\nThe lack of clean water, sanitation, and hygiene has increased the risk of disease for the refugees. Restrictions on space and resources have left the camps prone to landslides, flooding, and fires, without permission to leave.\n\nConcerned governments should step up support for Rohingya refugees.\n\nHasina Hatu\n\nMy father died by falling down a slope because of the raining and chaos.\n\nVoice Over\n\nHasina Hatu fled Myanmar in 2017 with her son and husband, Abul Hossain, who suffered from chest pain.\n\nHasina Hatu\n\nThe first three years of life in the camp were so distressing. Arranging treatment for my husband was very tough. Then he died. I don’t have an adult son or husband now, so there’s no breadwinner. We are two people in the family. We have to buy extra five kilos of rice. [The aid ration] isn’t enough. Now I do some sewing work to make money for food. If we had our house and land again, if we could go back [to Myanmar], we would be happy.\n\nVoice Over\n\nIn Myanmar, about 600,000 Rohingya remain trapped under a system of apartheid and persecution.\n\nIn 2021, the generals responsible for the atrocities against the Rohingya launched a coup and brutal nationwide crackdown.\n\nThe international community should pursue every avenue to hold the Myanmar military accountable and deliver justice for the Rohingya."
