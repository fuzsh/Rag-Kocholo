        "text": "Feb 20, 2011 © Ulrich Theobald\n\nThe Hanlinyuan ç¿°æé¢ \"Hanlin Academy\" (literally: Brush Forest Court) was an institution subordinated to the central government and entrusted with the draft of official documents. It was never consistently organised but was loosely staffed with so-called academicians (Hanlin xueshi ç¿°æå­¸å£«). The first literati entrusted with the task to draft official proclamations were sent to the Academy during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong åçå® (r. 712-755) of the Tang dynasty å (618-907). From then on the Hanlin Academy became a fixed institution of the imperial central government. The academicians had various disciplinary backgrounds. Some were poets, others experts in the Confucian Classics, some others were actually experts of Daoist techniques (e.g. prognostication or rituals) or in Buddhist writings, and there were also experts in divination and calligraphy.\n\nThose most highly regarded of the academicians were literati because they were able to write in refined and polished language. Normally the task to draft edicts was carried out by officials in the Palace Secretariat (zhongshusheng ä¸­æ¸ç), but especially in the early Tang period, academicians from the North Gate (Beimen åé) were entrusted with the draft of edicts. Emperor Xuanzong wanted to entrust this important task to real experts and therefore ordered Zhang Yue å¼µèªª (663-730), Zhang Jiuling å¼µä¹é½¡ (673-740), and Xu Anzhen å¾å®è² (dates unknown) to assign trustworthy experts in literature as Hanlin academicians. The Academy was located within the palace compound west of the Linde Hall éºå¾·å®® and thus located closer to the imperial lodge than the Secretariat.\n\nIn 738, a new building was constructed where the academicians had to live, the Hanlin xueshi yuan ç¿°æå­¸å£«é¢. At the same time the title of academician was institutionalized. An additional title was gongfeng ä¾å¥ \"for court service\" or daizhao å¾ è© \"editorial assistant\". The exact number of academicians of that time is not known, but it must have been considerable: In 805, Emperor Shunzong åé å® (r. 805) dismissed all diviners, chess masters and physicians from the Academy, numbering 32 persons. The old Institute of Academicians (xueshiyuan å­¸å£«é¢) lived on in the old place.\n\nThe title of \"academician\" (xueshi å­¸å£«) was a term for duty assignment (chaiqian å·®é£) to special posts, and not only for the Hanlin Academy. There were various institutions of the central government in need of experts as the academicians were. Such were the Institute for the Advancement of Literature (Hongwenguan å¼æé¤¨), the Institute for the Veneration of Worthies (Chongxianguan å´è³¢é¤¨) or the Academy of Scholary Worthies (Jixianyuan éè³¢é¢). For this reason there was actually no fixed number of offices to be filled, and the academicians appointed to the Academy were not attributed a defined official rank. Each of them brought with him the rank of the previous office and was paid his salary according to the former position. Members of the Secretariat could also be assigned to the Academy. Only somewhat later, a number of six academicians was fixed, with one of them acting as \"recipient of edicts\" (chengzhi æ¿æ¨). During the rebellion of An Lushan å®ç¥¿å±± (703-757), the position of the Hanlin academicians greatly improved, and some of them were not only used to do the paperwork but were also consulted in political matters by the emperor. During the reign of Emperor Dezong åå¾·å® (r. 779-804), academician Lu Zhi é¸è´ (754-805) had such a high influence on political decisions that he was called the \"inner Counsellor-in-chief\" (neixiang å ç¸).\n\nThe Hanlin Academy and the Imperial Secretariat divided their work among each other. The former mainly took over the draft of important documents about the appointment or dismissal of counsellors-in-chief and other high ministers, the proclamation of amnesties, and imperial commands during military campaigns. These documents of \"inner regulation\" (neizhi å å¶) were written on white hemp paper and were therefore called baima ç½éº». The Secretariat took over the draft of documents of minor importance, the so-called \"outer regulations\" (waizhi å¤å¶). These documents were written on yellow hemp paper and therefore called huangma é»éº». Some academicians were entrusted with the task of helping the emperor reading or writing documents. These were called academician reader-in-waiting (shidu xueshi ä¾è®å­¸å£«) resp. *academician calligrapher-in-waiting (shishu xueshi ä¾æ¸å­¸å£«). The position of the Hanlin academicians became so powerful that Emperor Jingzong åæ¬å® (r. 824-826) once planned to replace this institution by a new one. Later on, there were even academic commissioners (yuanshi é¢ä½¿) appointed to mediate between the Academy and the emperor. For a short time in the 940s, the task of drafting all documents was shifted back to the Secretariat.\n\nThe Song dynasty å® (960-1279) continued the institution of the Hanlin Academy without changing the duties of the six academicians. At some times a seventh, supernumerary academician (yuanwai xueshi å¡å¤å­¸å£«) could be assigned. As during the Tang period, many an academician rose to a high position, and some counsellors-in-chief were selected from among their ranks. Academicians could be assigned to other duties in various central government agencies, and then obtained the additional title of \"drafter\" (zhi zhigao ç¥å¶èª¥). After the government reform of the Xianfeng reign-period å è± (1078-1085), the position of Hanlin academician became a fixed position, with the official rank 3A.\n\nFrom then on, all drafters were Hanlin academicians, and vice versa. The number of academicians was fixed at two. If any additional persons were entrusted with the draft of edicts, they were given the designation of auxiliary Hanlin academician (zhi xueshi yuan ç´å­¸å£«é¢, short zhiyuan ç´é¢)ï¼Auxiliary academicians assigned in case of a vacancy of the two full academicians were called provisional auxilary Hanlin academicians (quan zhi xueshi yuan æ¬ç´å­¸å£«é¢, shortly quanzhi æ¬ç´), and if their original official rank was higher than 3A, the title was provisional Hanlin academician (quan Hanlin xueshi æ¬ç¿°æå­¸å£«)ï¼The term Hanlinyuan was during the Song period often used for the institute of academicians (xueshiyuan). To make matter even more complicated, there was an Artisans Institute of the Palace Domestic Service called Hanlinyuan.\n\nDuring the Yuan period å  (1279-1368), the Hanlin Academy was retained, but there was also a Mongolian Hanlin Academy (Menggu Hanlin yuan èå¤ç¿°æé¢) entrusted with the translation of documents. The task to supervise imperially sponsored publications, especially the dynastic histories, became an ever more important aspect of the Hanlin Academy.\n\nThe structure of the Hanlin Academy became more complex from the Ming period æ (1368-1644) on. At the head of the institution was a Chancellor of the Hanlin Academy (Zhangyuan xueshi æé¢å­¸å£«, rank 5A) supervising an academician expositor-in-waiting (shijiang xueshi ä¾è¬å­¸å£«, rank 6A), an academician reader-in-waiting (shidu xueshi, rank 6A), and an hereditary erudite of the Five Classics (shixi wujing boshi ä¸è¥²äºç¶åå£«, rank 8A), as well as several Hanlin bachelors of the Six Offices of Scrutiny (liuke shujishi å ­ç§åº¶åå£«, cooperating with the Six Ministries) with or without an official rank. Although the official rank of the academicians was not very high, a post in the Academy could serve as a booster for further career. Academicians were, furthermore, allowed to enter the Wenyuan Hall ææ·µé£ to consult secret documents.\n\nThe number of academicians increased considerably under the Qing dynasty æ¸ (1644-1911). There were two Chancellors (rank 5A), a Manchu and a Chinese, selected from among the grand academicians (daxueshi å¤§å­¸å£«), the ministers of the Six Ministries (liubu shangshu å ­é¨å°æ¸) and the vice ministers (shilang ä¾é). There were six readers-in-waiting (rank 5B) and six expositors-in-waiting (rank 5B), half staffed by Manchus and half by Chinese; an hereditary erudite of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices (Shengyi taichangsi boshi èè£å¤ªå¸¸å¯ºåå£«, rank 7A), a position inheritable to the descendants of the third son of Duke Yansheng è¡èå ¬, a descendant of Confucius; an hereditary erudite of the Five Classics (rank 8A), and Hanlin bachelors of the six offices of scrutiny.\n\nThe high positions of the Qing-period Hanlin academicians were not occupied by professional drafters, but were mere honorific posts often occupied by persons concurrently acting in another position. The persons occupying the hereditary positions were also not entrusted with the drafting of documents, but instead had to supervise the administration of the national Confucius temples and those of the Song-period Neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Xi æ±ç¹ (1130-1200). The official posts in the Hanlin Academy were thus only vain titles, but titles of high regard. Once obtaining such a title, it would be easy to rise into higher positions in the central government. Persons occupying the lower ranks of the Hanlin Academy were often assigned to positions concurrently serving in the Southern Study (nanshufang xingzou åæ¸æ¿è¡èµ°) and thus had easily access to the emperor or the crown prince and had insight and perhaps even influence on the daily business, or were at least highly estimated by outsiders.\n\nSources:\n\nChen Zhongan é³ä»²å®, Chen Zhen é³æ¯, Wu Yue ä¼èº (1992). \"Hanlinyuan ç¿°æé¢\", in Zhongguo da baike quanshu ä¸­åå¤§ç¾ç§å ¨æ¸, Zhongguo lishi ä¸­åæ­·å² (Beijing/Shanghai: Zhongguo da baike quanshu chubanshe), Vol. 1, 353-354.\n\nHucker, Charles O.
