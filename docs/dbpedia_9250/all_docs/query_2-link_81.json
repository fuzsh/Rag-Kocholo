        "text": "The expense of earning a 4 year degree usually leaves students and parents saddled with debt, many choose not to finish the degree plan, and there are others still who know the price is outside their grasp.\n\nThe exciting solution: Hamlin Collegiate has partnered with Collegiate Edu-Nation to provide free college courses to all HCISD students. Staff in Hamlin serve as both high school and college faculty, guiding the students to earn an associate degree and a high school diploma all by graduation. This is 60 college hours per student at zero cost to the family."
