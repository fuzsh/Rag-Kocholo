        "text": "I grew up in Berrien County in Michigan’s Southwest corner, and graduated from Central Michigan University (that school you love to hate) in 2001 with a degree in Sociology. After a couple of years managing residence halls at a small college in southern Ohio, I completed a master’s in education (M.Ed.) in Community Counseling at Ohio University. Since 2006 I have served a wide range of people. In private practice I have worked with high-functioning professionals and their family members seeking relief, growth, and improved relationships. I have also provided brief, evidence-based therapy as part of an individual's Primary Care medical visits. In a psychiatric emergency room I worked with people at critical moments in their struggles with mental illness and addiction. A meaningful way forward is always the goal. At WMU I work as an intake clinician. My job is to meet people where they are, put together a picture of their needs and goals, and then attempt to link them with the resources they need. If you need assistance don’t hesitate to reach out. We find meaning and purpose in helping you find your way forward."
