        "text": "Myanmar (Burma) in southern Asia is one of our homeschool countries-of-the-week, so why not spend a few minutes with your students today learning about one of Myanmar‚Äôs World Heritage Sites: the Ancient Pyu City-States.\n\nThe ancient Pyu culture flourished for more than a thousand years in the south-Asian region that is today Myanmar:\n\nThe Pyu Ancient Cities provide the earliest testimony of the introduction of Buddhism into Southeast Asia almost two thousand years ago and the attendant economic, socio-political and cultural transformations which resulted in the rise of the first, largest, and longest-lived urbanized settlements of the region up until the 9th century. The Pyu showed a striking capacity to assimilate Indic influences and swiftly move into a significant degree of re-invention. They created a special form of urbanization, the city of extended urban format, which subsequently influenced urbanization in most of mainland Southeast Asia. These earliest Buddhist city-states played a seminal role in the process of transmitting the literary, architectural, and ritual traditions of Pali-based Buddhism to other societies in the sub-region where they continue to be practiced up to the present.\n\nHalin, Beikthano, and Sri Ksetra together as a Serial Property jointly testify to the several aspects of the development of this new model of urban settlement for the Southeast Asian region. Together the three cities provide evidence for the entire sequence and range of Pyu urban transformation from ca. 2nd century BCE to the 9th century CE, Buddhist monastic communities, distinctive mortuary practice, skilful water management, and long distant trade. At all three Pyu Ancient City sites, the irrigated landscape of the Pyu era is still impacting on the rural livelihoods of the modern population, while the religious monuments continue to be venerated by Buddhist pilgrims from throughout the region. (World Heritage Centre #1444)\n\nYou can find a gallery of additional photos of the Ancient Pyu Cities on the World Heritage Centre‚Äôs website.\n\nWorld Heritage Sites are cultural or natural landmarks of international significance, selected by their home countries and recognized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. More than a thousand such sites have been designated in over 160 countries, and we feature one every Wednesday, drawn from one of our homeschool countries-of-the-week. You can find a complete list of World Heritage Sites online at the World Heritage Centre‚Äôs website and in Wikipedia.\n\nThe World Heritage Centre also has a free and comprehensive World Heritage education kit for teachers, as well as a wonderful full-color wall map of World Heritage Sites, available for the cost of shipping. Why not add them both to your own homeschool library. üó∫\n\nWhat world treasures are you and your students exploring in your homeschool this Leo Term? üá≤üá≤\n\n‚ù° The great globe itself: This is one of our regular Homeschool Geography posts featuring cultural and natural sites of international importance.
