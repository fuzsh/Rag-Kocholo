Climate zone classifications are derived from the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system, which divides climates into five main climate groups divided based on seasonal precipitation and temperature patterns. The five main groups are A (tropical), B (dry), C (temperate), D (continental), and E (polar). All climates except for those in the E group are assigned a seasonal precipitation sub-group (second letter).  Climate classifications are identified by hovering your mouse over the legend. A narrative overview of Myanmar's country context and climate is provided following the visualizations.",

A narrative overview of Myanmar's country context and climate is provided following the visualizations.\n\nThe Republic of the Union of Myanmar, herein Myanmar, (formally known as Burma) is situated on the western edge of Southeast Asia, located between 9°55‟, 28°15‟ N and 92°10', 101°10' E. It is bordered by the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal (2,330 km), Thailand (2,325 km), Lao People’s Democratic Republic (235 km), China (2,185 km), India (1,454 km), and Bangladesh (258 km). Myanmar is the largest country in Southeast Asia, covering approximately 676,000 km2, extending 800 km east to west and 1,300 km north to south. The country as a whole can be divided into three main ecological zones: i) central dry; ii) coastal; and iii) hilly. Myanmar's population was roughly 57 million in 2020.\n\nIn Myanmar, storms, floods and waterlogging are identified as key drivers of poverty, and poverty is highest in rural areas. These factors, combined with Myanmar’s high exposure to hazards such as floods and tropical cyclones make it one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change in the world. Myanmar has ratified the Paris Climate Agreement and published its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in 2016. Myanmar’s NDC identifies extreme weather events, sea level rise, flooding, and drought as the most significant threats it faces from climate change. In Myanmar, vulnerability remains high due to rapid rises in exposure as rapid development has taken place in urban areas without sufficient protection to natural hazards through the continued development of the country. Myanmar’s identified agriculture, water resources, public health, forestry, coastal zones, and biodiversity sectors as the most vulnerable sector to climate change."
