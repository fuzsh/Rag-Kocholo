        "text": "The cultural region must be improved to meet the international level for enabling foreign observers to know Myanmar’s history. It is necessary to show off the firm history of Myanmar to the world.\n\nAncient cultural zones and heritage are significant for the development of the tourism industry. Hence, it is necessary to arrange the transport services to be provided to the visitors and allocation of the plots for shops. Systematic management and arrangements must be expressed as the capacity of Myanmar to the world.\n\nSri Ksetra city was the largest among other ancient Pyu city-states as well as the oldest one. It is located in Hmawza Village, five miles southeast of Pyay in the Bago Region. The wall of the city is 14 kilometres long, four metres wide and 10 metres high. Currently, there are 17 villages in the wall including Hmawza Village.\n\nAncient Sri Ksetra city has been facilitated with Pyu buildings, a cemetery, a hillock, temples, stupas, a palace, gates, moats and walls. The Department of Archaeology has been taking responsibility for conducting research in the excavation of the ancient city since 1907. Ancient cultural heritage was left by humans and the nations which have been undertaking civilization in successive eras.\n\nIn excavation, archaeological sorts of evidence were found as originals at the ancient Pyu cities. Three ancient pagodas are located in a tripartite shape outside the walls of Sri Ksetra city. Bawbawgyi Stupa is located in the south of the city, Phayagyi Stupa in the northwest and Phayama Stupa in the northeast.\n\nThe word heritage is defined as the tangible and intangible elements which have been carrying cultural characteristics and historical importance of the society to date. The long history of Myanmar has been covering the shreds of evidence of civil housing in all parts of the nation since the Pyu era. Some ancient Pyu city-states are still existent and some of them had disappeared. Thanks to the concerted efforts of archaeologists and historians, Myanmar’s ancient heritage cities could be discovered one after another.\n\nUNESCO, one of the important agencies of the United Nations, designated three ancient Pyu city-states Sri Ksetra, Beikthano and Hanlin at the 38th session of the World Heritage Congress held from 15 to 25 June 2014. They were recognized as the first-ever world heritage sites of Myanmar.\n\nIn excavation, archaeological sorts of evidence were found as originals at the ancient Pyu cities. Three ancient pagodas are located in a tripartite shape outside the walls of Sri Ksetra city. Bawbawgyi Stupa is located in the south of the city, Phayagyi Stupa in the northwest and Phayama Stupa in the northeast.\n\nIn truth, Sri Ksetra, an ancient Pyu city-state, the world heritage site too, showcases the origins of civilization in Southeast Asia as well as the firm and standard history of Myanmar which can be dubbed as one of the world’s cultural zones."
