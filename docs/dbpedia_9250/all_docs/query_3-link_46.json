        "text": "History\n\n[edit]\n\nLike most of Southeast Asia's countries, Myanmar's people and history is a glorious mishmash of settlers and invaders from all fronts. The Mon and the Pyu are thought to have come from India, while the now dominant Bamar (Burmese) migrated through Tibet and, by 849, had founded a powerful kingdom centred on Bagan. The ethnic diversity of the region, and the dominance of the Bamar people in the central plains, set up the geopolitical struggles between them and the multitude of smaller ethnic groups surrounding, which have continued unabated until the present day. From the 9th century to the 19th century, the Burmese empire grew through conquests of Thailand (Ayutthaya) and India (Manipur), and shrank under attacks from China and internal rebellions.\n\nEventually, Britain conquered Burma over a period of 62 years (1824-1886) and incorporated it into its Indian Empire, and King Thibaw, the last Burmese monarch, was exiled to Ratnagiri in what is today India. Like in their other colonies, the British maintained control partly through a \"divide and conquer\" strategy, in which they deliberately stoked tensions between different ethnic and religious groups, resulting in ethnic and religious conflicts that have never been resolved. For example, bureaucrats were imported from India, and other government positions tended to be manned by locals from the smaller ethnic groups. Burma was administered as a province of India until 1937 when it became a separate colony. During the Second World War, Burma was a major battleground as the Allies fought the Japanese for dominance over Asia. The Burma Road was built to get supplies to China. The Thailand-Burma railway (the so-called \"Death Railway\") from Kanchanaburi in Thailand over the River Kwai to Burma was built by the Japanese using forced labour — Allied prisoners-of-war, indentured Thai labourers, Burmese people and other Southeast Asians. They had to work in appalling conditions and a great number of them died (estimated at 80,000) during construction of the railway. Large parts of Western Burma, particularly the hilly areas bordering India and the city of Mandalay, were severely damaged during the war.\n\nBurmese independence fighters led by General Aung San initially cooperated with the Japanese to oust the British, with the Japanese promising to grant independence to Burma in exchange. However, life under Japanese occupation was even more brutal than life under British colonialism, and many Burmese were killed, such as in the Kalagong massacre. Aung San subsequently switched allegiance and helped the allies win Burma back from the Japanese. Aung San subsequently led negotiations with the British for Burmese independence after the end of World War II, and the British agreed in 1947 to grant independence to Burma the following year, though Aung San himself was assassinated later in 1947 and never lived to see his dream come true. Independence from the British under the name Union of Burma was finally attained on 4 January 1948, and General Aung San is regarded by most Burmese people to be their father of independence.\n\nThe new union brought together various states defined by ethnic identity, many of whom had centuries-long histories of autonomy from and struggles against each other. In the interest of securing their collective independence from Britain, the tribes reached an agreement to submit to collective governance—with power sharing among the ethnicities and states—for ten years, after which each tribe would be afforded the right to secede from the union. The terms of this \"Pinlon Agreement\" were enshrined in the 1947/1948 constitution of the new Union of Burma. The new central government of the nation quickly worked to consolidate its power, marginalising and angering tribal leaders and setting off ethnic armed conflict that has continued unabated until the present day. In 1961, more than 200 ethnic leaders from the Shan people, Kachin people, Red Karen, Karen people, Chin peoples, Mon people and Rakhine people met with ethnic Bamar (Burmese) central government authorities to draft a new form of government which would ensure the tribes both autonomy and self-determination within a federal system.\n\nThe new government was never formed. Nevertheless, up until Ne Win's coup in 1962, Burma was regarded as one of the most developed and fastest growing economies in Asia, and widely touted as a contender to be the next Japan. Military leader General Ne Win led a coup d'état which ousted the democratically elected government in 1962, and installed himself as leader. General Ne Win dominated the government from 1962 to 1988, first as military ruler, then as self-appointed president, and later as political kingpin. Under Ne Win's rule, widespread corruption and nepotism led the Burmese economy into a downward spiral from which it has never fully recovered. Pro-democracy demonstrations in 1988 were violently crushed, with general Saw Maung taking over in a coup and installing the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) to rule the country, now renamed Myanmar.\n\nMultiparty legislative elections were held in 1990, with the main opposition party - the National League for Democracy (NLD) - winning a landslide victory (392 of 489 seats). But SLORC refused to hand over power, instead placing NLD leader and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Aung San Suu Kyi (daughter of national hero Aung San) under house arrest, which she has endured for 14 of the last 20 years.\n\nToday Myanmar, a resource-rich country, suffers from pervasive government controls, inefficient economic policies, and rural poverty. What was once one of the richest and most developed countries in Asia has since slumped into poverty due to widespread corruption. The junta took steps in the early 1990s to liberalise price controls after decades of failure under the \"Burmese Way to Socialism,\" but had to reinstate subsidised prices on staples in the face of food riots, upon which the democracy movement grafted its agenda. The government called out troops and the rioters were defiant until the monks intervened: standing between both sides, they told everyone to go home and they did. The riots caused overseas development assistance to cease and the government subsequently nullified the results of the 1990 legislative elections.\n\nIn response to the government's attack in May 2003 on Aung San Suu Kyi and her convoy, the USA imposed new economic sanctions against Myanmar, including bans on imports of products from Myanmar and on provision of financial services by US citizens.\n\nThe summer of 2007 was marked by demonstrations against the military government which were again brutally suppressed. The demonstrations started in August, apparently in an uncoordinated manner, as a protest against a stiff hike in the price of petrol, but morphed into a more serious challenge to the government after three monks were beaten at a protest march in the town of Pakokku. The monks demanded an apology but none was forthcoming and soon processions of monks with begging bowls held upside down filled many cities (including Sittwe, Mandalay and Yangon). Yangon, particularly the area around Sule Pagoda in the downtown area, became the centre of these protests. While the monks marched, and many ordinary citizens came out in support of the monks, the world watched as pictures, videos, and blogs flooded the Internet. However, the government soon suppressed the protests by firing on crowds, arresting monks and closing monasteries, and temporarily shut down Internet communications with the rest of the world. This led the US, Australia, Canada and the European Union to impose additional sanctions, some targeting the families and finances of the military leaders.\n\nFollowing elections in 2010, Burma began a process of liberalisation that has led to a reduction or removal of sanctions by many nations including the United States. In 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi was elected to the Burmese parliament and allowed to travel to Europe and North America. Censorship of foreign and local news was also suspended.\n\nIn November 2015, Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won a landslide victory in the nationwide legislative elections and Htin Kyaw, a close ally of Aung San Suu Kyi, became president. In April 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi took office as State Counsellor, a post equivalent to prime minister, making her Myanmar's de facto head of government.\n\nIn February 2021, the military once again took power in a coup after a landslide victory by the NLD. Country-wide mass protests and a civil disobedience movement sprung up in the aftermath; protests were brutally crushed as the army killed hundreds of NLD supporters and democratic activists. Thousands of NLD and other pro-democracy politicians, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and community leaders were arrested. Peaceful protests still occur sporadically while other groups of protesters have taken up arms against the military regime, particularly in the border regions. Western countries have re-imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar as a result of the coup. As of mid-2024, the military regime controls less than half of the area of the country, and Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs) have been successfully mounting co-ordinated attacks with increasing confidence. However, this brutal civil war still has no end in sight.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nTrain travel times/fares between destinations FromToTimeOrdinaryUpperSleeper YangonMandalay16 hr4,600 kyat9,300 kyat13,000 kyat YangonKyaiktiyo6 hr1,200 kyat2,500 kyatNone MandalayPyin U Lwin4 hr550 kyat1,200 kyatNone Pyin U LwinHsipaw7 hr1,200 kyat2,750 kyatNone Pyin U LwinLashio16 hr1,900 kyat4,400 kyatNone\n\nMyanmar has an extensive rail network, a relic of British rule. Unfortunately, there has been little maintenance or growth since the British left. Trains are slow, noisy, uncomfortable, and prone to delays. Electrical blackouts are becoming rare but nonetheless never assume that air conditioners, fans or the electrical supply itself will be working throughout the whole journey. Most trains have upper class and ordinary class. Ordinary class has wide open windows, benches and can be packed with locals transporting their goods. Upper class has upholstered chairs, fans and is less crowded. Be careful putting your head out of the window as it is likely to be hit by a branch. Vegetation grows so close to the tracks that you can reach out and touch it. Tickets are cheap and tourists pay the same price as locals, but tourists cannot buy tickets on the train. At smaller stations, you may have to seek the stationmaster or use an interpreter to buy a ticket. Your passport is required when purchasing.\n\nA journey on a train is a great way to see the country and meet people. The rail journey from Mandalay, up hairpin bends to Pyin U Lwin, and then across the mountains and the famous bridge at Gokteik, is one of the great railway journeys of the world. Trains in lower Mandalay, Yangon-Pathein and Yangon-Mawlymaing, are little communities of their own with hawkers selling everything imaginable. Sleepers are available on many overnight express trains, although in the high season you may want to reserve a few days in advance. Tickets go on sale three days in advance. At some stations there is a separate counter for advance bookings, or even a separate building (e.g., in Yangon). Food service is available on the express in both directions between Yangon and Mandalay.\n\nExcept for the new bridge and rail line that connects Mawlamyine to points on the west side of the Salween River, the rail network is exactly the way it was in British times. The most-used line is the 325km line from Yangon to Mandalay with several trains a day. It is the only double line in Myanmar, and also the only one that is competitive in time with buses. The fastest trains take 15 hr for the 385km run, an effective rate of 25km/hour. A second line connects Yangon with Pyay, 9 hr for the 175 km journey, with a branch heading off into the delta region town of Pathein. These tracks, the earliest constructed, are in poor shape. With the construction of the bridge across the Salween, it is now possible to go by train from Yangon to Mawlamyine, 8 hr for the 200km journey, and on to Ye and Dawei. From Mandalay, trains continue on to Myitkyina in Kachin State, 350km in 24 hr, and to Lashio. There are also rail connections between Yangon-Bagan and Mandalay-Bagan, but bus or ferry are better alternatives: the 175km from Mandalay to Bagan takes 10 hours.\n\nThere is railway service between Yangon-Bagan. 16 hr, first class US$30, upper class US$40, sleeper US$50. (check new prices)\n\nTrain tickets cannot be paid in dollars any more, and the government has abandoned the former dual-pricing structure that saw tourists pay inflated prices.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nBus travel times/fares between destinations FromToTimeKyat YangonMandalay11 hr10,400 YangonBagan10 hr12,000 YangonKyaiktiyo4 hr6,000 MandalayPyin U Lwin2 hr1,500 MandalayHsipaw5.5 hr4,500\n\nBuses of all types ply the roads of Myanmar. Luxury (relatively speaking) buses do the Mandalay-Yangon run while lesser vehicles can get travellers to other places. Fares are reasonable and in kyat and buses are faster than the trains. Many long-distance buses assign seats, so it is best to book seats at least a day in advance. Because the roads are bad, avoid the rear of the bus and try to sit as far up front as you can. Long-distance buses also have an extra jump seat that blocks the aisle and, because it is not well secured to the chassis, can be uncomfortable (which also means that there is no such thing as a side seat where taller people can stretch their legs). A window near the front of the bus is always the best option.\n\nEven budget travellers will find themselves buying more tickets via their hotel or an agency rather than going to the bus company to buy it directly. Their offices are often located far from any tourist place and the cost of going there and back will most likely exceed the commission your hotel will get for selling you the ticket. Shop around and compare prices before buying your ticket as some vendors include a free pick-up from your hotel.\n\nA bus ticket scam seems to be popular in Yangon. While many make a stopover in Bago, they are told at their guesthouse or at the bus station it's not possible to buy tickets there in the direction to Mandalay. In a country where everything might be possible when it comes to transport, some people fall for this. Actually, this is not the case and tracking back to Yangon for a bus ticket up north is not necessary at all. Bago has a bus terminal with several bus offices. Buying your ticket at Bago might be slightly cheaper (depending upon your bargaining skills) and gives you more freedom for the rest of your journey.\n\nThe adjoining table summarises travel times and approximate fares between important tourist destinations in Myanmar. Most bus fares have gone up with the fuel price rises, so the fares listed are rough estimates.\n\nMoney\n\n[edit]\n\nExchange rates for Myanmar kyat\n\nAs of July 2023:\n\nUS$1 ≈ 2,090 kyat\n\n€1 ≈ 2,300 kyat\n\nUK£1 ≈ 2,690 kyat\n\nJapanese ¥100 ≈ 1,480 kyat\n\nChinese ¥1 ≈ 295 kyat\n\nIndian ₹100 ≈ 25 kyat\n\nSG$1 ≈ 1,570 kyat\n\nThai ฿10 ≈ 60 kyat\n\nExchange rates fluctuate. Current rates for these and other currencies are available from\n\nMyanmar's currency is the kyat, pronounced \"chat\". Prices may be shown locally using the abbreviation of K (singular or plural) or Ks (plural) either before or after the amount and depending very much on who is doing the sign writing. The ISO abbreviation is MMK. Wikivoyage articles will use kyat to denote the currency. Pya are coins, and are rarely seen since their value has become increasingly insignificant with even the largest 50 pya coin worth less than US$0.001. Banknotes of Myanmar are issued in denominations of 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 kyats.\n\nYou may also come across 20, 10, 5, and 1 kyat and 50 pya banknotes. They are valid but rarely found and best held onto as souvenirs. Older banknotes in strange denominations are sold to tourists and, while typically genuine, are rarely if ever valuable.\n\nThe notes of 50 kyat, 100 kyat, 200 kyat, and 500 kyat are usually in a horrible condition, but are generally accepted when making small purchases. The 1,000 kyat notes are slightly better. 5,000 and 10,000 kyat notes always appear new after exchanging foreign currencies. When exchanging money, check that the banknotes you receive are in a generally good condition. If the exchange gives you kyat notes in horrible condition, you can ask them to exchange them for notes in better condition.\n\nDispose of remaining kyat before leaving. Outside of Myanmar, kyat is almost worthless but do make nice souvenirs. Kyat cannot be legally exchanged abroad, though some money changers in places with large overseas Burmese populations such as Singapore will exchange anyway, but at terrible rates. Kyat can be exchanged on departure from Yangon Airport at decent rates.\n\nUS dollars\n\n[edit]\n\nForeigners are no longer required to pay in U.S. dollars for hotels, tourist attractions, rail and air tickets, ferry travel and for bus tickets. As of 2015, foreign currency instability and the weakening kyat means that many venues will state prices in U.S. dollars, even though it is illegal to do so. Expat restaurants still often quote in U.S. dollars despite actions from the Central Bank prohibiting excess dollar usage. It is illegal for a Myanmar citizen to accept (or hold) U.S. dollars without a licence, but this law is mostly ignored and U.S. dollars are generally accepted. Never insist, though, because it may be dangerous for the receiver.\n\nBring very clean, unfolded U.S. dollars (or they will not be accepted by hotels, restaurants and money changers). Even small imperfections can be cause to reject a U.S. banknote. Keep all U.S. dollars in impeccable condition, and do not fold them. If you do end up with a few, try using them for purchases rather than exchange, or try to exchange them in a few different places.\n\nATMs\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are plenty of ATMs all across the country accepting international Visa and MasterCard. The bigger and more touristic the place the more ATMs it has. Smaller tourist destinations also have ATMs (Bagu, Hpa-An, etc.), but not so many. Make sure to carry a buffer outside of major tourist hotspots.\n\nIf an ATM does not work, try the next one. Usual withdrawal limit is 300,000 kyat with a processing fee of 5,000 kyat. In case you run out of money, ask your taxi driver to drive you to the CB Bank ATM.\n\nNote: Your bank may refuse to process ATM transactions with some/all banks in Myanmar, even if the ATM accepts Visa or Mastercard. Check with your bank prior to entering the country.\n\nCredit cards\n\n[edit]\n\nUpmarket tourist places (hotels, agencies, restaurants) are accepting credit cards (and will surcharge accordingly). So you can even pay with mastercard in a store in the middle of Inle Lake for purchases value more than US$100. But nonetheless paper money is the only way to pay in most places.\n\nBeside the ATMs, there are places (e.g. hotels in Yangon) where cash can be obtained with a credit card (cash advance), but the rates are extremely uncompetitive (with premiums certainly no lower than around 7%, and with quotes of 30% and more frequently reported). Also, they may need to see your passport to process the transaction. For US citizens, it is also possible to receive funds from friends or relatives in an emergencies through the US Embassy.\n\nMoney exchange\n\n[edit]\n\nThe foreign currency of choice in Myanmar is the US dollar, though you can readily also exchange euros and Singapore dollars in Yangon and Mandalay, but perhaps not beyond. Other options are the Chinese Yuan and Thai Baht. The best rates are in Yangon and Mandalay. Major foreign currencies need to be in good condition—other currencies like rupees and baht are often accepted even if worn out.\n\nThe military junta re-imposed currency controls in 2021, once again leading to a yawning gap between the official rate (fixed at 2100 kyat/dollar) and the black market (as high as 5000/dollar as of 2024). Banks and money changers only sell kyat at the official rate. Exchanging on the black market is highly illegal, with sellers risking jail time and the junta periodically cracking down.\n\nEspecially on holidays and Sundays, all your necessary money should be changed at the airport as banks in town are closed. Money changers offer significantly lower rates (5-10% lower) for changing US dollars and euros. The most hassle-free option is to change all your required money at the airport, depending on the rate to change it back. Look around different banks for the best exchange rate.\n\nBe sure to bring a mix of foreign denominations when visiting Myanmar because money changers will sometimes not give change and smaller notes (in good condition) are useful for some entry fees and transport. Even though, larger bills give the best exchange rates at banks.\n\nEnsure that foreign notes are:\n\nUnmarked – No stamps, anti-counterfeit pen, ink or any other mark on them at all. Pencil can be removed with a good eraser, but any permanent marks will greatly decrease a note's value and ability to be exchanged.\n\nFresh, crisp and as close to brand new as possible – Moneychangers have been known to reject notes just for being creased and/or lightly worn.\n\nUndamaged – No tears, missing bits, holes, repairs or anything of that sort.\n\nPreferably of the new design, with the larger portrait, and the multiple-colour prints. Although, old-style US$1 are still commonly traded.\n\nFor US$100 bills, have no serial numbers starting \"CB\". This is because they are associated with a counterfeit \"superbill\" which was in circulation some time ago.\n\nScams:\n\nThere are a number of tricks and scams running around Myanmar trapping tourists who are carrying US dollars. Sometimes, guesthouses or traders will try and pass you damaged or nonexchangeable bills in change. Always inspect all notes when making a purchase and request that the vendor swap any notes you think you will have trouble using down the track—this is perfectly acceptable behaviour for both vendors and customers, so don't be shy.\n\nSome money changers will also attempt sleight of hand tricks to either swap your good banknotes for damaged, or lower denomination notes. Other reports suggest that the kyats may be counted and then somehow, some disappear from the table during the transaction. For example, after going through an elaborate counting process for piles of ten 1,000 kyat notes, some money changers will pull some notes out as they count the piles of ten.\n\nWhen changing money, be sure that, after any money is counted, it is not touched by anyone until the deal is sealed. Also do not allow your dollars to be removed from your sight until all is agreed; in fact, it is not even necessary to pull out your US dollars until your are paying for the kyats you received. It sounds extreme, but ending up in a country where you cannot access whatever savings you have, and having a good portion of your budget rendered useless (until you get to more relaxed changers in Bangkok) can really put a dampener on your plans.\n\nTravellers cheques\n\n[edit]\n\nTravellers cheques are not accepted in Myanmar. The only exception might be some especially shady money changer, but be prepared to pay an astronomical commission (30% is not uncommon)."
