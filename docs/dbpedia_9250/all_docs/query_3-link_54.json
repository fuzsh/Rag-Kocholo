        "text": "When to File for TPS\n\nIf you currently have TPS under Burma’s designation and would like to keep your TPS, you must re-register during the 60-day re-registration period that runs from March 25, 2024, through May 24, 2024. We encourage you to register as soon as possible within the 60-day re-registration period.\n\nIf you are filing an initial application for TPS under Burma’s redesignation, effective May 26, 2024, you must register during the registration period that runs from March 24, 2024, through Nov. 25, 2025. We encourage you to register as soon as possible within the registration period.\n\nGo to the TPS webpage for information about registering.\n\nWhere to File\n\nIf you are applying for TPS Burma, you may file Form I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status, online. When filing an initial TPS application or re-registering for TPS, you can also request an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) by submitting a completed Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, online with your Form I-821.\n\nFile Online\n\nIf you are filing a paper initial TPS application or re-registering for TPS, or if you are filing for a replacement EAD for TPS you were already granted, mail your TPS package to the appropriate address in the table below:\n\nIf you send your paper application via:Then, mail your application to:U.S. Postal Service (USPS)USCIS\n\nAttn: TPS Burma\n\nP.O. Box 6943\n\nChicago, IL 60680-6943FedEx, UPS, and DHLUSCIS\n\nAttn: TPS Burma (Box 6943)\n\n131 South Dearborn Street. 3rd Floor\n\nChicago, IL 60603-5517\n\nIf we approve your TPS registration application and you filed Form I-765 and paid the fee for an EAD (or if we approved your fee waiver request), we will issue you an EAD with an expiration date of Nov. 25, 2025.\n\nFor more information on TPS eligibility requirements, what to file, and step-by-step instructions to submit a TPS application package, go to the TPS page. You can find the filing fees for TPS related forms on our Fee Schedule page.\n\nAutomatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension\n\nWe are automatically extending through May 25, 2025, the validity of EADs issued with an expiration date of May 25, 2024, or Nov. 25, 2022, under the TPS designation of Burma. If your EAD is covered through this automatic extension, you may continue to use your existing EAD through May 25, 2025, as evidence of your identity and authorization to work.\n\nTo prove that you are authorized to work in the United States, you may show the following documentation to your employer. Government agencies may also accept these documents if they need to determine your immigration status:\n\nYour TPS-related EAD with a May 25, 2024, or Nov. 25, 2022, expiration date; and\n\nA copy of the Federal Register notice announcing the automatic extension.\n\nYour employer may rely on the Federal Register notice as evidence of the continuing validity of your EAD. Go to the Documentation Employers May Accept and Temporary Protected Status Beneficiaries May Present as Evidence of Employment Eligibility page for more information.\n\nIf we approve your TPS re-registration application and you filed an EAD application that is also approved, we will issue you a new EAD with the expiration date of Nov. 25, 2025.\n\nFor more information on TPS eligibility requirements, what to file, and step-by-step instructions on submitting a re-registration or initial TPS application package, go to the TPS page.\n\nOther Immigration Options\n\nYou might be eligible for other immigration options listed on the Explore My Options page.\n\nTo apply for lawful permanent resident status (a Green Card), you must be eligible under one of the categories listed on the Green Card Eligibility Categories page. Once you find the category that may fit your situation, click on the link provided to get information on eligibility requirements, how to apply, and whether your family members can also apply with you.\n\nNote on Seeking Asylum: Being granted and maintaining TPS for a reasonable period before the filing of the asylum application is considered an extraordinary circumstance for the purposes of the one-year filing deadline. In other words, having TPS status “stops the clock” on the requirement to file for asylum within one year of arriving in the United States, if the one-year clock has not already expired. See 8 CFR 208.4(a)(5)(iv).\n\nAvoid Scams\n\nPlease be aware that some unauthorized practitioners may try to take advantage of you by claiming they can file TPS forms. These same individuals may ask that you pay them to file such forms. We want to ensure that all potential TPS applicants know how to obtain legitimate, accurate legal advice and assistance. A list of accredited representatives and free or low-cost legal providers is available on the USCIS finding legal advice webpage.\n\nWe do not want you to become a victim of an immigration scam. If you need legal advice on immigration matters, make sure the person helping you is authorized to give legal advice. Only an attorney or an accredited representative working for a Department of Justice (DOJ) recognized organization can give you legal advice. Visit the Avoid Scams page for information and resources.\n\nRelated Links"
