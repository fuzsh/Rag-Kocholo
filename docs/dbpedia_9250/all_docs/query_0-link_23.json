        "text": "Located by the riverside of the legendary Irrawaddy River, Pyu or Pyay is the first World Heritage sites claimed by Unesco organization.\n\nPyu Ancient cities has three old cities of Hanlin, Beikthano and Sri Kestra with brick walls and moats were inscribed on the list during the 38th Session of the World Heritage Committee held in Doha of Qatar, according to an official announcement by the Committee.\n\nThese ancient cities are located in vast irrigated landscapes in the dry zone of the Ayeyarwady River basin, and reflect the Pyu Kingdom that were prosperous for over 1,000 years between 200 B.C and 900 A.D. The three cities have been partly excavated archaeological sites, and more excavation works remain for excavated palace citadels, burial grounds and early industrial production sites, as well as monumental brick Buddhist stupas, partly standing walls and water management features-some still in use-that underpinned the organized intensive agriculture.\n\nHanlin, excavated in 1904, 1929-30 and 1962-67, had a rectangular city wall in brick of 3 by 1.6 km with a palace site at the centre. Beikthano with side of 3 km quadrangular city walls and gateways was excavated in 1959-63. Sri Kestra, the largest Pyu City, was enclosed by a circular city wall in brick with a diameter of 4.4 km.\n\nThe cultural relics and religious buildings, located in Natma Taung National park, are now under consideration by UNESCO to be designated as world heritage sites, according to UNESCO.\n\nAncient Pyu people spoke a language closely related to Myanmar, with the stone inscriptions found in some of their monuments providing the only knowledge of this language.\n\nThe Pyu culture is characterized by specific artifacts of coins, ceramic and metal ware. Archaeological evidence confirms the emergence of Buildhism in Myanmar during the Pyu period.\n\nHow to get there ?\n\nFrom Yangon, the best way is to take a private car transfer.\n\nA beautiful alternative is to take a river cruise travelling up river from Yangon. There are many long cruise trips pass this remarkable site.\n\nThe tour from yangon to Pyu often takes from 3 to 4 days.\n\nWho organize tours to Pyay ?"
