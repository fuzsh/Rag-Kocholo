        "text": "This country update assesses religious freedom conditions in Burma since the military coup on February 1, 2021. On February 1, 2021, the Burmese military—known as the Tatmadaw—launched a coup to overturn election results that would have locked them out of the civilian-led government. Protests against this coup were met with violence from the Tatmadaw. The coup exacerbated already dire religious freedom conditions for Burma’s vulnerable ethno-religious communities, including the predominantly Muslim Rohingya and various Christian groups. The Tatmadaw has also targeted members of the Buddhist majority who have expressed opposition to the military junta. In addition to detailing significant religious freedom violations against these religious communities, the factsheet details the responses of various international and domestic actors—including the U.S. government—that aim to hold the Burmese military accountable and stem future violations."
