        "text": "As civil war rages in Myanmar, a cancer is growing. The war-torn nation has become a hub for global cybercrime.\n\nUN investigators say more than three million people were displaced in Myanmar’s escalating conflict in last six months.\n\nMedical charity MSF warns of urgent need to protect civilians caught up in escalating conflict in western Rakhine State.\n\nAnti-coup fighters claimed to have taken control of key military base in northeastern Lashio over the weekend.\n\nWe speak to Bangladeshi youth at the forefront of a movement they say aims to restore hope in the country’s future.\n\nFighting is escalating in an area stretching from Mandalay to Lashio, where the military has its northeastern command.\n\nGenerals have pledged to hold elections in 2025 after repeated delays caused by extensions of emergency rule.\n\nMyanmar youth recount life inside a cyber-scam mill before a city’s fall brought the scheme crashing down.\n\nThe current acting president, Myint Swe, has taken medical leave and transferred his duties to Min Aung Hlaing.\n\nThis means if Myanmar’s junta falls, Rohingya refugee repatriation would still be in doubt.\n\nCalls for investigation grow as fighters from multiple states allege military using weapons such as white phosphorous.\n\nAmid armed conflict following the 2021 coup, Myanmar’s fast-depreciating currency is destabilising the economy."
