Complex societies had early beginnings in several regions, and include the Daxi culture, the Liangzhu culture, and the Hongshan culture.\n\nThe Longshan Culture The Shi Ji discusses the period of the Five Emperors, naming kings, cities, battles, and rival kingdoms. The Han Shu mentions walled cities that may refer to Longshan culture. Defensive walls, rich burials, metallurgy, military artifacts, and craft specialization in jade and ceramics characterize Longshan culture, and during the late 3rd millennium BC, Longshan centers and cemeteries display hierarchical social structure on the brink of state formation, but they were not alone in northern China.\n\nChengziyai yielded inscribed oracle bones dating to between 2500 and 1900 BC, anticipating the Shang practice of oracle bone divination. Symbols on pottery that anticipate the Chinese script have been found at Dinggong and Jingyanggang. Longshan sites incorporated stamped-earth walls and foundations, some containing human sacrifices, antecedents of Shang practices.\n\nThe Lower Xiajiadian Culture The Lower Xiajiadian culture was contemporary with Longshan. Excavations at Fengxia indicate three phases, and 2000 sites fall into three groups based on size and the presence of defenses.\n\nAt Dadianzi, 800 excavated burials indicate a custom of single inhumation burials with elites in large, richly endowed graves, indicating craft specialists in ceramic, polished stone, lacquerware, jade and bronze -- evidence of increasing social distinctions. Bronzes reflect connections with the Andronovo steppe culture and Bactria (northwest Afghanistan). Oracle bone divination on scapulae was widespread, indicating connections to later Shang civilization.\n\nThe Xia Dynasty The Xia Dynasty (c. 1700-1500 BC), the first dynasty of China, is known from both the Shi Ji and archaeology, especially at the city of Erlitou, which covers over 300 ha (750 acres) and has four phases within the first half of the 2nd millennium BC. The first two phases relate to Longshan culture, the third and fourth reveal marked changes: two palaces, ritual bronze vessels, and elite burials, including bronzes vessels, dagger-axes, battle-axes, knives, and ceremonial yazhang blades, and ritually important jade cong cylinders. Early written characters appear on pottery, and an animal scapula was used for divination.\n\nThe Shang Dynasty The Shi Ji was once the principal source on Shang culture, until in the late 19th century, an inscribed turtle shell led to the discovery of Anyang, the last capital of the Shang Dynasty (c. 1500-1045 BC). More sites and over 100,000 oracle bones have since been discovered. Divinations concerned war, hunting, rainfall, agriculture, and the royal family's health.\n\nArchaeologists have explored the early Shang walled capital at Zhengzhou, where an extramural area of 25 sq. km (9.7 sq. miles) included bronze, bone, and ceramic workshops, cemeteries, and the homes of specialist craftspeople. A moated palace lay within the city walls, near richly endowed graves. Zhengzhou was eventually superseded as capital by Huanbei (1400-1200 BC), containing a palace precinct with at least 25 buildings.\n\nThe capital then moved to Anyang, which covered at least 25 sq. km (9.7 sq. miles). Palace foundations, ancestor temples, and oracle bone repositories have been found. Chariots at the site may have come from Armenia. The royal necropolis at Anyang includes 12 subterranean tombs each approached by four descending ramps. Each contained a wooden chamber, rich goods, weapons, and hundreds of human sacrifices.\n\nTemples hosted rituals dedicated to the supreme god Di, who had influence over nature and agriculture, and also encouraged war on enemy states, though the ancestors increasingly assumed this role.\n\nThe Changjiang Culture The newly recognized Changjiang culture indicates that Yangzi Valley peoples rivaled the Shang in social complexity. Sanxingdui, a walled city, contained ritual pits, yielding ceremonial jade yazhang blades and ge daggers, and hundreds of bronzes, jades, and gold artifacts. Among the items were gigantic cast bronze trees, one with birds in the branches, a gigantic bronze male statue, 44 bronze heads, bronze masks, and bronze vessels, capped by 60 elephant tusks.\n\nThese may relate to burials of the kings of Shu, a state mentioned in the Shang archives. Small models show the function of the yazhang jade blades and the massive bronze heads; they were used in sacrifice, and as parts of a ritual structure. The tradition of casting gigantic bronze items is unique to the rulers of Sanxingdui.\n\nThe Changjiang culture is also evident at the city of Wucheng and necropolis of Xin'gan, where a royal tomb of the late Shang period contained hundreds of artifacts, many with a distinctive southern tiger motif. The Changjiang polity may have formed the basis for the Chu state.\n\nThe Western Zhou Dynasty The Shang Dynasty ended with Zhou conquest in 1045 BC. The Zhou Dynasty is well-documented textually (the Shi Ji; the Bamboo Annals) and archaeologically. During the Western Zhou (1045-771 BC), the capital was at Zongzhou. It was later sacked and the capital moved east to Luoyang, initiating the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-221 BC).\n\nThirteen emperors ruled until 771 BC, a dominance partly based on new forms of armor, halberds, and swords. In an expansionist policy, peripheral states were conquered and ruled by royal kin. The policy failed when kin grew scarce and provincial rulers grew powerful, founding their own small states. Wealthy burials of the Jin state are found at Tianma Qucun. Rich tombs of the state of Wei are found at Xincun. The state of Yan was founded by a prince of the Zhou line. Rich burials at Fangshan cemetery near Beijing are associated with another provincial state.\n\nThe early Zhou adopted ritual and mortuary practices from Shang. Bronze ritual banqueting vessels honored ancestors with inscriptions; a hoard was found at Zhuangbai. Another continuing Shang practice was the interment of chariots, horses, and charioteers. A large palace complex containing stamped-earth foundations and oracle bones was unearthed at Fengchu. A hall with a complex drainage system lay between two enclosed courts. A second palace with a large great hall may have hosted royal ceremonies. This site also included bone, ceramic, and bronze workshops.\n\nWestern Zhou Bronzeworking. Such palaces and settlements with bronze foundries are similar to Shang cities such as Anyang. The vessel types and manufacturing techniques were also similar; early Zhou rulers may have acquired Shang specialists. Royalty and their vassals thus produced their own vessels and weaponry, leading to competition and friction. At Luoyang, a large intensive bronzeworking area, with complex casting molds, furnaces, and workers dwellings was found.\n\nA \"ritual revolution\" in the 9th century BC can be traced through the analysis of the bronzes in the mortuary record. Highly varied collections of bronze funerary feasting vessels were replaced with standardized sets of identical forms, with long, identical inscriptions. Rank was apparently indicated by the number of identical vessels that an individual possessed. More bronzes could be acquired over time as wealth permitted. This encouraged mass production and commercialization of items previously limited to court rituals.\n\nDuring the Western Zhou Dynasty, literature, music, and poetry flourished, and growing trade encouraged new administrative structures, but in 771 BC, the capital was moved to Luoyang, establishing the Eastern Zhou Dynasty.\n\nThe Eastern Zhou Dynasty The Eastern Zhou Dynasty is divided into the Spring and Autumn Annals period (770-481 BC), and the Warring States period (481-221 BC), named for historic texts. Luoyang kings were weak, thus regional states, the \"Five Hegemonies\" developed. The Hua Xia states controlled the central plains during the Spring and Autumn period. Factionalism and rivalry erupted during the Warring States period, when the powerful states of Qi, Chu, Yan, Han, Zhao, Wei, and Qin were collectively called the Ten Thousand Chariot states. Archaeology now provides important data abut Eastern Zhou, especially through ancient texts describing battles, historic events, laws, and details of Qin rule over the defeated state of Chu, such as those found in the tomb of Xi, and others on silk, official seals, bronzes and ceramics.\n\nAfter moving the court to Luoyang, Eastern Zhou's feudal bonds with their vassals broke, and the vassal states rapaciously expanded (to the dismay of the philosopher Confucius who deemed their tactics immoral). At the same time, states outside the Eastern Zhou sphere rose in power: the Chu, the Wu, the Yue, and the Shu. The Ba system developed, where one state's ruler acted as a paramount over others. The Ba state rotated between Zheng, Qi, or Jin, and eventually Yue. Loyal followers were given suzerainty over conquered areas, creating the seeds of trouble by building up regional elites, who could rise against the center: Jin was thus divided into Han, Wei, and Zhao. Contested succession led to a widespread murder of rival royal heirs, leading to a political philosophy based on absolutism and self-interest.\n\nTechnological and Social Changes. Advanced iron weapon and armor technology spread during the Warring States period, changing military strategy and intensifying warfare, causing the annihilation of states and ruling dynasties. Agricultural advances fed large permanent armies. The Eastern Zhou dynasty eventually gave way to the state of Qin, under Qin Shi Huangdi, in 221 BC.\n\nThis competitive milieu also encouraged art, architecture, and industry. New cities displayed changing internal layouts. Social elites fled to new urban centers in politically turbulent times, thus requiring strong defenses. Increased trade and a rising mercantile class turned royal administrative hubs into true urban centers with a central royal palace.\n\nBronze and iron specialists served the ruler and court: the rise of powerful ministerial and bureaucratic families raised the demand for fine bronzes, seen in differential bronze tomb wealth. War demanded weaponry, while status competition led to new decorative techniques. Exceptional bronzes are represented by the furnishings from Leigudun tomb 1 (433 BC).\n\nThe Qin Dynasty In 221 BC Qin Shi Huangdi became the First Emperor of China (after Qin, pronounced \"chin\"). He was a reformer, creating 36 provinces, or \"commanderies\" under appointed governors with military and administrative power. Uniform small seal script (xiaozhuan) writing was adopted, weights, measures, and currency were standardized, and a uniform legal system was enforced, all consolidating imperial power.\n\nA huge labor force built roads and a canal system, while 300,000 men built the Great Wall in northern China to repel invading Xiongnu steppe horsemen. Over 600,000 worked on the Emperor's tomb. Mass uprooting and resettlements were undertaken to strengthen defenses and increase agricultural production.\n\nQin Shi Huangdi's massive mortuary complex at Lintong was filled with personal belongings and depictions of his empire. Famous life-sized terracotta replicas of the Emperor's armies have been found, as was a replica zoological garden, and royal chariot. Court intrigue and rebellions troubled his heirs, bringing the Qin Dynasty to an early end.\n\nThe Han Dynasty The Han Dynasty, divided into Western Han and the later Eastern Han, initiated changes still part of China's heritage. The earlier capital lay at Chang'an, the later at Luoyang. An interregnum fell between AD 9 and 23, during which the regent Wang Mang established the Xin, or \"New,\" Dynasty.\n\nAdministration. During Han times, some dependent states were ruled by appointed kings, and the commandery system was maintained. Administrators attending a central training institution were taught by Confucian scholars. By the late Western Han era, there were 120,285 officials in the administration. A Chancellor, Imperial Counselor, and Commander of the Armed Forces led government, under which were nine ministries controlling aspects of society run by hierarchically ranked bureaucrats. A harem of well-born imperial consorts produced many child and infant emperors; thus Dowager Empresses and their families wielded much power, attracting assassins.\n\nThe territorial expansion of the Western Han under Emperor Wudi (140-87 BC), required military force. The state expanded into the Tarim basin, the Red River basin and the Korean peninsula. Frontier defense is seen in the extension of the Great Wall against Xiongnu threats. Internal discontent and uprisings are evident through the Red Eyebrow and Yellow Turban uprisings.\n\nWith the exception of those who could buy exemption, young men underwent military conscription leading to a year of service. Survivors were active reserves until age 56. The Northern Army served in the state's heartland. Militia could be called up to fight internal or Xiongnu threats.\n\nAgriculture. Han administrators attempted to alleviate farmers' hardships and improve productivity, leading to demographic increase and a population concentration in the central plains. Farmers were urged to settle in northern border regions as a bulwark against incursions, and rewarded with land, housing, medical care, and tax concessions. Migration also flowed southward.\n\nCentrally planned irrigation increased production. Iron improved plows and farm implements. In 85 BC, the Zhao Guo introduced the seed drill. The water-powered bellows improved iron production, and water power also milled grain.\n\nReligious Beliefs. Religious beliefs mixed old and new forms. The worship of Di as supreme god expanded under Emperor Guang Wudi (reigned AD 25-75). Emperor Wudi added new deities, the Earth Queen and the Grand Unity. Imperial rituals involved animal sacrifices and burnt offerings. In 31 BC, the deity Dian became primary, linked to the ruling dynasty.\n\nImmortality beliefs fueled mortuary rituals involving elaborate tombs to supply needs in the afterlife. The soul (hun) could enter paradise, while the body (bo) remained on earth, preserved and accompanied by necessary goods.\n\nThe mortuary complex of Emperor Jingdi (156-141 BC) is an example of such rituals. High-status tombs of private individuals shed more light on mortuary ritual, such as the graves at Mawangdui containing Li Cang, the Marquis of Dai, and his wife and son.\n\nEmperors and high-status aristocrats were buried in jade suits believed to preserve the body and thus the bo. Status was marked by the use of gold, silver, or bronze thread. At Mancheng, the tomb of Prince Liu Sheng represents such a burial. The Han era was relatively peaceful and prosperous after a long period of strife.\n\nKOREA\n\nIn 108 BC, the Han conquered and founded four provinces in northern Korea; one, Lelang, lasted four centuries. Local elites were provincial administrators using Chinese titles. This provoked the rise of indigenous states, three of which - Koguryo, Paekche, and Silla - belong to the Three Kingdoms period (57 BC-AD 668).\n\nKoguryo Koguryo (37 BC -AD 668) gained independence by defeating the Lelang commandery in AD 313, and became politically and economically dominant. Trade and agriculture flourished, and kings constructed tombs, walled cities, palaces, temples, and defensive walls. From AD 372, a Confucian-oriented university trained administrators. The stone-walled palace with moat and reservoir lay at the early capital Jian. In AD 427 Pyongyang became the capital, with defensive walls, palace, and Buddhist temples. Archaeologists have recovered plowshares, coins, and chariot fittings at the city of Fushun. Elite tombs at Jian, Chinpari, and Anak contain jeweled frescoes of noble activities and rituals\n\nKaya Kaya was a confederation of city-states in southernmost Korea, where iron ore is found, and smelting and export of iron was economically important.\n\nPit graves and mound-covered stone-lined tombs at Paekchonni and Pokchondong contain iron armor, helmets, and horse masks, displaying Kaya's need for defense against powerful Silla and Paekche. Artifacts, arms, and armor from a royal grave at Taesongdong reveal widespread trade contacts from Scythia to Japan, where Kaya was influential. Royal graves at Chisandong reveal large central mortuary chambers and smaller stone-lined tombs for sacrificed victims comprised of men, women, and children.\n\nPaekche Paekche, an agrarian state, adopted Buddhism in AD 384. It was the most cultured kingdom, speaking court Chinese by the 4th century AD, and sending the first Buddha images to Japan in AD 552. Wars with Koguryo and Silla caused relocation of its capital. Paekche was defeated by a Tang -- Silla alliance in AD 660. Few ancient structures survive, but archaeologists have revealed many sites such as fortified Mongchon, Isong Sansong, and Pungnamni. Mounded elite and royal tombs at Sokchondong, Karakdong, Naju, and Kongju, contained precious and rich furnishings.\n\nSilla Silla conquered Kaya, Koguryo, and Paekche with Chinese aid during the 6th and 7th centuries AD. Developing from an alliance of clans in 37 BC, the ruler called Kosogan (\"big man\") became Maripkan, or hereditary king by the 4th century AD. The rules of succession incorporated three known reigning queens. Rich ore deposits at Hwangsong-dong enabled iron export to Japan, perhaps fueling the state's development.\n\nSilla society was ranked by ancestry: songgol (\"holy bone\") ruling families, chingol (\"true bone\") nobles, then three further ranks before commoners. Unlike Koguryo and Paekche, Silla retained an indigenous shamanistic religion; Buddhism was not adopted until the 5th century AD.\n\nArchaeological research has focused on the Silla capital and burial mounds at Panwol-song, but early state formation is represented at Choyangdong, with pit graves from the 1st-2nd centuries AD containing Han mirrors and beads. Burials at Kujongdong contain iron spears and bronze swords. Golden crowns, belts, and other ornaments fill 155 royal mound graves at Kyongju, revealing a rich and opulent society. Military gear dominated male graves.\n\nMany fortresses dot the landscape; one at Panwolsong housed the royal palace, another protected the port of Pusan. Of the Buddhist temples, one, built in Kyongju by Queen Sondok in AD 645, survives, where artifacts confirm Chinese trade.\n\nGreat Silla Korean unification in AD 668 is revealed in the Great (or Unified) Silla period, until AD 918 when Koryo conquered Silla. During the 8th century AD, Tang China was its greatest influence, and the capital, Kumsong, modeled on Chinese Chang'an, contained over a million people. Excavations at Anapchi Lake revealed palace life, including preserved administrative records.\n\nBuddhist temples and statues of granite are ubiquitous, such as at Mount P'algong. Craftspeople cast bronze figures, exemplified at the Kamun-sa temple. Gold examples come from the Hwangbok-sa temple. Silla architectural and sculptural styles are showcased at the Sokkuram cave temple at Mount Toham. Gilded iron Buddha images are unique to later Silla sculpture.\n\nJAPAN\n\nEarly Yamato The Yamato kingdom was ruled by okimi, or great kings, whose burial mounds were known as kofun. Archaeology, and two early historic accounts, the Nihongi and Kojiki, illuminate the era.\n\nKofun resemble contemporary tombs in Korea. Huge examples in the Nara basin may belong to early Yamato kings and contain exotic prestige goods, iron weaponry, and armor.\n\nThe five kings of the Sujin dynasty reigned from AD 219 to 346. The first, Sujin, a military leader, worshiped the kami (deity or spirit) of Mount Miwa to claim sacred legitimacy. Six kofun mounds are found there. Elite tombs indicate competition and military rivalry through iron weapons and armor.\n\nThe Growth of Yamato Power Korea brought literacy to Japan during the second Ojin dynasty. The political center moved to Saki, where large kofun are located. By AD 400 the power base moved onto the Osaka plains near the Inland Sea.\n\nIn the 5th century AD Yamato controlled military power and practiced diplomacy with Korean states, but administration is unknown. Rulers constructed irrigation works and suppressed dissent, and must have controlled labor. Chronicles mention military positions and Korean scribes. Specialist craft-workers are evident.\n\nImportant elite tombs include the Furuichi group with the Ojin tomb, and the Mozu group with the Nintoku tomb, with haniwa and caches of weaponry and armor. From AD 450, Korean-style ornaments are found.\n\nThe shift from ritual to militaristic items once led to a theory of invasion by mounted foreigners, but this is not supported archaeologically. The alternative hypothesis is that the second Yamato dynasty developed from the first, changed its political center to harness the power of local clans during increasing political contact with Korean counterparts. Territorial gains were made against former rivals to secure access to Korea.\n\nInscribed swords, such as one from Inariyama, provide evidence for the extension of Yamato control during the 5th century.\n\nDecline and Civil War In AD 507, Keitai relocated the court and royal tombs back to the Mount Miwa area, but power began to decline in Keitai's reign. Silla encroached into Kaya, taking iron ore-bearing territory traditionally loyal to Yamato. Attempts to retake the area were foiled by rebellion and desire for independence in the provinces.\n\nIn AD 585, senior clans and the royal court were embroiled in civil war over Imperial succession, exacerbated by the lack of primogeniture and numerous royal claimants. Many short-lived rulers mark the era, with the Empress Suiko enjoying the only lasting reign.\n\nThe Asuka Enlightenment China, reunited in AD 589 under the Sui Dynasty, influenced and received tribute from Yamato and the three Korean states. The Sui emperor Wendi built a new capital and palace, and initiated construction of the Grand Canal. Through Confucian obedience, all subjects were registered in an efficient taxation system. Yamato officials adopted similar ideas during the Asuka Enlightenment (after the new court capital, Asuka).\n\nChinese-style script, Sui-style palace capitals, and Buddhism of the Chinese style were now adopted. Struggles over the succession and enthronement of Empress Suiko created religious rifts, with Soga no Imako and Prince Shotoku vowing to promote Buddhism if successful, leading to construction of the Asuka-derae and the Shitenno-ji temples, aiding Buddhism's rapid spread.\n\nKorean immigrants numbered among the armored cavalry and the 816 monks recorded in AD 623. Korean-influenced architecture is evident in temples and elite burial goods. The Enlightenment also saw imperially appointed Twelve Ranks, based on merit and ability rather then heredity and guided by Confucian principles. The Seventeen Injunctions of Prince Shotoku (AD 604) confirm Confucian-based requirements of many types.\n\nInterest in Chinese administration, art, and culture became greater when Sui was replaced by the Tang Dynasty in AD 618. The deaths of Prince Shotoku (AD 622) and Empress Suiko (AD 628) ushered in factional politics and bloodshed between the imperial family and powerful clans, settled with the appointment of Emperor Kotoku (reigned 645-654), who moved the capital from Asuka to Naniwa on the coast. Kotoku implemented major reforms affecting imperial powers and the tax system, known as the Taika Reforms: a census and an agricultural tax paid in goods, labor, weaponry, and armor.\n\nThe Transition from Yamato to Nara The defeat of Yamato's Korean ally, Paekche, by Tang China and Silla led to fort construction, increased central military control, and a new, more easily defended capital built at Otsu. Emperors Tenji (reigned 668-671) and Tenmu (673-686) legitimized their authority through construction of Tang-style palace-capitals.\n\nNew edicts outlined the legal basis of imperial rule: the divine origins of the royal dynasty. Buddhist sutras favoring royal rule were widely read. Tenmu's widow, Empress Jito, constructed a new Chinese-style capital at Fujiwara. In 702, the Taiho Code was issued: laws that institutionalized the aristocratically-based Fujiwara regime. Succession was not restricted to males. The empress was succeeded by her sister Genme, who moved the capital to nearby Heijo-kyo, which seamlessly established the Nara state.\n\nYamato was a seminal period in Japanese civilization leading directly into the Nara state.\n\nTHE CENTRAL ASIAN SILK ROAD\n\nThe Silk Road spread languages, cultigens, stylistic motifs, bronzeworking and the horse-drawn chariot into China. When the Han expanded westward, trade flourished on routes along the Taklamakan Desert, across the steppes to Ferghana and the Syr Darya Valley in Central Asia and toward the Caspian Sea and Mediterranean lands. Many states developed through control of this trade, combined with irrigation agriculture and exploitation of natural resources.\n\nKhotan The state of Khotan (Yutian), was a renowned jade source lying between East and West. The walled capital has been destroyed by looting for gold, jade, and other artifacts. The Khotanese spoke a Middle Iranian Saka language, written in the Indian Brahmi script, which was the vehicle for Buddhist texts reaching China. The Tibetan Li Yul annals provide a history of 56 kings, accepting Buddhism around 104 BC. The 14th king, Vijaya Jaya, married a Chinese princess who brought silk worms to establish a Khotanese silk industry.\n\nBronze coins of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD bear Kharoshthi and Chinese inscriptions, naming local kings as Maharaja (\"Great King\") and Yidaraja (\"King of Khotan\"). Chinese and Kushan coins are evidence of a wide exchange network, as the Kushan empire incorporated Samarkand, Bokhara, and Fergana in Central Asia, and Gandhara (northern Pakistan and Afghanistan) further west.\n\nShanshan Shanshan, originally called Loulan, was founded in the 1st century BC. It incorporated the south and east Tarim basin, the city of Niya, the areas and cities of Endere, Cherchen, Charklik, and Miran, The Loulan core lay at the confluence of the Kuruk Darya River and Lop Nur lake, a strategic Silk Road location where northern or southern routes split. Shanshan was subject to warlike incursions by the Xiongnu, and the Chinese Shi Ji and the Han Shu discuss its walled cities and large population.\n\nDuring centralized periods in China, Shanshan was a client state, but when the central government was weak, Shanshan was independent. Documents on wooden slips, cloth, and paper provide insight into Shanshan, describing the presence of Chinese military commanders and agricultural supervisors. A Shanshan prince was sent as a hostage to the Western Jin court in AD 283.\n\nMost Loulan documents were written in Chinese, but some are in Kharoshthi, which originated in Gandhara, derived from Aramaic during Achaemenid (Persian) dominance in the 5th century BC. It was also used in Sogdiana and Bactria under the Kushan empire, in the Krorãn kingdom, and as far east as Luoyang in China. Northern and western Indian coins also bear Kharoshthi legends. Documents from Niya from between AD 230 and 335 describe royal orders, messages, and Buddhist administration, including place names that can be linked to known places.\n\nIn AD 399, the Chinese monk Fa Xi'an described a Buddhist ruler and several thousand monks. First attacked by China in AD 442, Shanshan was conquered by the northern Wei in 445. Later, the Hephthalite Huns controlled this region, followed by the 6th century Turks, the Tang Chinese in the mid-7th century, until 751, when Arabs defeated the Tang.\n\nTHE SOUTHEAST ASIAN MARITIME SILK ROAD\n\nWhen the Eastern Han dynasty fell and the Three Kingdoms (AD 220-280) rose, an alternative, maritime route to the West was sought. Thus, the Chinese came into contact with Southeast Asian kings who commanded palaces, cities, cultivation, taxation, and writing.\n\nFunan, the Mekong Delta The Funan state controlled the strategic Mekong Delta, and had large walled cities linked by canals. Archaeological research at Oc Eo (Vietnam) and Angkor Borei (Cambodia) reveal Sanskrit royal names, use of the Brahmi script, worship of Hindu gods, and Buddhism. Brick temples contain cremation pits. Grave offerings include gold plaques with Buddhist inscriptions and Hindu images.\n\nTrade with China and India supported Funan until the mid-6th century AD, when changing trade patterns caused political power to shift inland to a group of warring principalities called Chenla by the Chinese. One, centered at Ishanapura (Cambodia) left inscriptions describing a dynasty with a central court, temples, water control, and a bureaucracy. In the 8th century AD Jayavarman II founded the state of Angkor.\n\nAngkor, Cambodia Angkor is a complex of cities, temples, and reservoirs located north of the Great Lake in Cambodia. Sanskrit and Khmer inscriptions indicate that its occupants were ancestral to modern Cambodians.\n\nThe earliest occupation lies west of the main complex: an enclosure at Banteay Choeu, and the Ak Yum, Prei Khmeng, and Phnom Rung temples lie within or nearby. A second enclosure lies to the north. Banteay Choeu may have been the work of Jayavarman II, who, in AD 802, consecrated himself chakravartin, supreme king on earth, as he founded Angkor.\n\nAnother complex, Hariharalaya, contains the Indratataka reservoir with temples to its south. Later inscriptions state that Jayavarman II retired there before his death in about AD 835. The Roluos Group structures were constructed during Indravarman's reign (877-889), incorporating two major temples, Preah Ko and the Bakong.\n\nWhen Indravarman died, his son Yashovarman built a new capital on the Bakheng hill, the massive Eastern Baray reservoir, and Hindu monasteries and temples.\n\nJayavarman IV established a capital at Koh Ker; Rajendravarman II (reigned 944-968) returned to the old center and built the Pre Rup and Eastern Mebon temples to honor ancestors and house sacred objects. He was succeeded by Jayavarman V who also reigned at Angkor, whose state temple, Hemasringagiri, represented Mount Meru, home of the Hindu gods. Civil war erupted after Jayavarman V death, eventually won by Suryavarman I (reigned 1002-1050), who embellished Angkor with the Phimeanakas temple. Royal buildings lay within a high wall enclosing a large precinct, and the Western Baray, the largest reservoir, was constructed. The Western Mebon temple to Vishnu was built in the style of Suryavarman's successor, Udayadityavarman.\n\nUnder the succeeding Mahidharapura dynasty (from about 1080), Angkor attained its present layout. Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument known, was constructed by Suryavarman II (reigned 1113-1150) and displays many sculptural depictions of court life, warfare, and religious themes.\n\nThe second Mahidharapura king, the Buddhist Jayavarman VII (reigned 1181-1219) built Angkor Thom, the walled city that dominates Angkor, and the northern reservoir. The Bayon temple lies at its center, and the Neak Pean temple foundation inscriptions describe how Jayavarman VII founded two vast temple complexes, Ta Prohm and Preah Khan. Building activity slowed at his death. The Thais encroached and Angkor was abandoned in the mid-15th century. The temples were never abandoned and retain their sanctity to this day.\n\nThe Arakan Coast, Burma The Arakan coast of western Burma (Myanmar) lay along Asian maritime routes of the early centuries AD and facilitated the Buddhist missions sent to Southeast Asia by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka. Two major cities spanned the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.\n\nThe walled city of Dhanyawadi lay on a river route to the Bay of Bengal, and contained a walled precinct and palace. Inscriptions in the Shitthaung Pagoda of King Anandacandra in the city of Mrauk-U date to AD 729 and list the region's kings, such as Dvan Candra (reigned 370 to 425).\n\nVesali, also on rivers leading to the Bay of Bengal, superseded Dhanyawadi as the capital during the early 6th century AD. An outer moat and walls enclose a walled precinct and palace complex. Excavations in the 1980s revealed Buddhist foundations. Commerce is reflected in locally minted coins, found as far away as Bangladesh, and south Indian and Mediterranean artifacts are found in Vesali.\n\nThe Pyu of Burma The Pyu or Tircul people of Burma were first mentioned as the Piao in Chang Chu's mid-4th century AD Chinese text, and described as \"civilized.\" Archaeology reveals that the Pyu state developed between 200 BC and AD 900.\n\nThree walled cities, Beikthano, Sri Ksetra, and Halin, lay in valleys along the Irrawaddy River, used for irrigation. Beikthano displays a pre-Buddhist mortuary tradition: brick and timber halls containing high-status cremations. By the 4th or 5th century AD, Buddhism took root, and stupas and monasteries were constructed. The Pyu spoke a Sino-Tibetan language, used Indian scripts, and participated in a widespread trading network; they were proficient bronze- and silver-workers. Ultimately the Pyu were succeeded by the state of Pagan; a major destruction layer at Halin may relate to this, although many Pyu arts, crafts, and ideas were incorporated into the Pagan state.\n\nThe Dvaravati of Thailand Dvaravati flourished in the Chao Phraya River valley in Thailand from AD 400 to 900, coming under the influence and control of Angkor. They spoke Mon, closely related to Khmer. The names of Dvaravati rulers survive in inscriptions describing their religious and military deeds.\n\nArchaeologists have investigated large, moated cities and the foundations of religious buildings with Buddhist figures and symbols. The Ku Bua site has images of Semitic traders, emphasizing the importance of international trade to the rise of this state. The major sites include U-Thong, Nakhon Pathom, Lopburi, Ban Khu Muang, Sri Thep, Muang Phra Rot, Dong Si Mahosod, and Dong Lakhon.\n\nThe Cham of Vietnam The Cham occupied coastal Vietnam and spoke an Austronesian language. This territory is divided into coastal enclaves, backed by the Truong Son cordillera. Centers were located where rivers cross the coastal plains in several regions. Champa was never a unified state, but a group of kingdoms. Chinese records contain many references to the Chams, who often raided their southern frontier. During centralized periods in China, histories recorded that the Chams sent tribute missions to the Chinese court, and listed their rulers. Fan-Wen was a prominent early Cham ruler, succeeded by his descendants Fan-Fo (from AD 349) and Fan-Hua (399-413). During his reign, Sanskrit names were adopted.\n\nBox Features\n\nKey Discovery: The Origins Of Chinese Writing\n\nKey Discovery: Southern Rivals to Shang Culture\n\nKey Discovery: Confucianism\n\nKey
