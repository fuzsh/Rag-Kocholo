Born in 1982, Julie Béna lives and works between Prague and Paris.

Heir to a childhood spent in a traveling theater and an adolescence as an actress, Julie Béna's reflections are nourished and inspired by theater and literature as well as popular culture. In a work combining performance, sculpture, cinema and installation, Julie Béna summons imagery and daily concerns that she makes her own through stagings, transforming them into subjects of fiction that are sometimes poetic, romantic or epic.

Julie Béna's work has been shown at Fused, San Francisco, among others; Mathew, NYC, Chapter, NYC; Bozar, Brussels; RCA, London; Futura, Prague, at the sixth edition of the Biennale de Rennes. She has benefited from several personal exhibitions: at the Jeu de Paume; at the CAPC museum of contemporary art, Bordeaux; at the Joseph Tang Gallery and the Amparo Museum in Puebla, Mexico. She recently performed at Center Pompidou, Paris; M Leuven; ICA London, Independent, Brussels; Pernod Ricard Foundation and Palais de Tokyo, Paris.
