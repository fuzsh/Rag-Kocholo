The mechanism(s) by which this occurs remains unclear.\n\nMethods\n\nWe investigated the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 at maternal-fetal interface in pregnant women who tested positive for the virus using RNA in situ hybridization (viral RNA), immunohistochemistry, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. To investigate whether viral infection alters the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in placenta, which controls blood pressure, we treated human trophoblasts with recombinant spike protein or a live modified virus with a vesicular stomatitis viral backbone expressing spike protein (VSV-S).\n\nFindings\n\nViral colonization was highest in maternal decidua, fetal trophoblasts, Hofbauer cells, and in placentas delivered prematurely. We localized SARS-CoV-2 to cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and demonstrate that infected placentas had significantly reduced ACE2. In response to both spike protein and VSV-S, cellular ACE2 decreased although angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) increased with concomitant increase in soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt1). Viral infection decreased pro-angiogenic factors, AT2R, and placental growth factor, which competitively binds to sFlt1. Sera from infected pregnant women had elevated levels of sFlt1 and angiotensin II type 1-receptor autoantibodies prior to delivery, both signatory markers of pre-eclampsia.\n\nConclusions\n\nSARS-CoV-2 colonizes ACE2-expressing maternal and fetal cells in the placenta. Infection in pregnant women correlates with alteration of placental RAS. As RAS regulates blood pressure, SARS-CoV-2 infection may thus increase adverse hemodynamic outcomes, such as pre-eclampsia in pregnant women.\n\nFunding\n\nNIH/NICHD grants R01 HD091218 and 3R01HD091218-04S1 (RADx-UP Supplement).\n\nKeywords: decidua, pregnancy, placenta, extravillous trophoblasts, ACE2, sFlt1, AT1R, PlGF, pre-eclampsia, AT1-AA\n\nContext and significance\n\nSARS-CoV-2 infection appears to increase the risk of pre-eclampsia, a dangerous condition in pregnancy characterized by high blood pressure. However, the mechanisms by which it may do so are currently unknown. Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri show that SARS-CoV-2 colonizes multiple cell types in the human placenta. In addition, infection is associated with alterations in the placental renin-angiotensin hormonal system, which regulates blood pressure leading to increased markers of pre-eclampsia. This study provides insights into the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the placenta and supports a link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women through changes in the renin-angiotensin system.\n\nVerma et. al. show that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, infects maternal and fetal cells in the human placenta, and infection is associated with decreased angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression and alterations in the blood-pressure-regulating renin angiotensin system (RAS). Alterations in this system are implicated in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia. These findings shed light on how SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 has led to a global health crisis, causing more than 115 million infections and 2.5 million deaths worldwide. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The burden of disease has not been borne equally among the population, with more severe disease noted in the elderly, men, and those with cardiovascular comorbidities1, 2, 3, 4. Initially the majority of studies to date suggest that COVID-19 did not cause increased mortality in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women5. There are studies which do not support evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the placenta and also disprove the possibility of vertical transmission and pregnancy-related complications.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 However, a case report published early on in the pandemic showed the death of 7 pregnant women (out of 9), as well as one who was critically ill and one who recovered after prolonged hospitalization due to severe COVID-19 disease. Comparison of severity of infection to family members of all 9 women showed disease severity in COVID-19-infected pregnant women.20 Recent studies have reported that pregnant women are more likely to be positive for SARS-COV-2 and have both asymptomatic and severe disease outcomes as compared to non-pregnant women.21, 22, 23, 24, 25 SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported to put pregnant women and their fetuses at risk by increasing the possibility of pregnancy-related complications, including pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).23 , 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 A number of recent studies now indicate increased risk for perinatal complications in pregnant patients with severe COVID-19, including higher incidence of pre-eclampsia and preterm birth in SARS-CoV-2-infected women.18 , 32 That said, the risk for vertical transmission,33 , 34 although not nil, appears to be minimal.6 , 7 , 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48 Thus, it remains imperative to understand and elucidate mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 at the maternal-fetal interface dictating its pathogenesis during pregnancy.\n\nMultiple studies have demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in placental villi, mainly in syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs), placental submembranes (chorionic and amniotic membranes), maternal macrophages, and fetal macrophages (Hofbauer cells [HCs]) at different gestational stages of pregnancy.29 , 44 , 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 A second-trimester miscarriage was reported in a case study of a woman with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and virus was found in placental submembranes with immune cell infiltration in placental cotyledons.56\n\nSARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cellular entry receptor via viral spike (S) protein, which binds the N-terminal peptidase domain of ACE2.57, 58, 59 ACE2 is a key component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), a cascade of vasoactive peptides controlling angiogenesis, blood pressure, and fetal development by regulating inflammation.60 Viral endocytosis into host cells is also mediated by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), so maximum viral tropism for host cells depends on co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.57, 58, 59 Notably, placental trophoblasts are highly responsive to the changes in angiotensin receptor concentrations that occur during pregnancy.60 , 61 Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 has been found during early pregnancy at the maternal-fetal interface in villous cytotrophoblasts (CTBs), STBs, and extravillous trophoblast cells (EVTs), but ACE2 expression decreases as the pregnancy progresses.44 , 62 , 63 Although some doubts have been raised regarding whether ACE2 is present in the placenta,64 a number of recent studies have confirmed the expression of ACE2 in placental cells.49 , 50 , 65, 66, 67, 68 The mechanism by which expression of ACE2 changes in the context of COVID-19 remains to be fully elucidated. The objective of our study was to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 affects expression of ACE2 in the placenta and, if so, whether alterations in ACE2 impacts the RAS system, which can contribute to pregnancy outcomes.\n\nHere, we report SARS-CoV-2 colonization in term and preterm placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women. SARS-CoV-2 was found in all placental sections, colonizing the basal plate (BP) in EVTs, villous tissue (VT) in STBs and HCs, subchorionic (SC) region, amniotic epithelium of fetal membrane (FM), and tunica adventitia layer of umbilical cord (UC). Intracellular virus was found in placental trophoblasts and HCs expressing ACE2. Histopathological analyses showed that SARS-CoV-2-infected preterm placentas harbored inflammatory infiltrates, whereas inflammation was negligibly present in non-infected preterm or any term placentas. Transfection of human trophoblasts with SARS-CoV-2 S protein or infection with a live modified virus with a vesicular stomatitis viral (VSV) backbone expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein triggers downregulation of ACE2 receptor expression while increasing expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor 1 (AT1R) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt1), which are associated with pre-eclampsia pathogenesis. These findings were confirmed in SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant patients. Thus, SARS-CoV-2, likely via viral S protein, disrupts the placental RAS pathway. In sum, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 colonizes fetal trophoblasts, stromal cells, and macrophages in the placenta, which express the ACE2 receptor. S binding to ACE2 leads to reduction of the receptor expression and results in alterations of the RAS pathway—changes that are similar to those typically noted in pre-eclampsia.\n\nResults\n\nClinical characteristics\n\nIn our study, we used five placentas each from SARS-CoV-2 uninfected and SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant women. Of the five SARS-CoV-2-infected women, three were asymptomatic, one had only anosmia, and one had cough, dyspnea, chest pain, nausea/vomiting (n/v), and chills. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by qRT-PCR using nasopharyngeal swabs or saliva. There were no significant demographic differences between cases with positive maternal SARS-CoV-2 testing and our controls, and maternal age ranged from 19 to 33 years (uninfected) and 17 to 32 years (infected; ). One patient (20%) in both the infected and uninfected groups delivered preterm and three (60%) in both groups delivered vaginally. With the exception of one patient, who tested positive and was symptomatic prior to delivery, the patients were positive at delivery. In addition, 3/5 (60%) pregnant patients were diagnosed with chronic hypertension, pre-eclampsia with severe features, or gestational hypertension.\n\nTable 1\n\nNo.Maternal age, yearsSymptomsGestational age at delivery (weeks and days)Pre-eclampsia featuresMode of deliveryMaternal raceCOVID-19-negative womenP130NA37 and 3NAvaginalwhiteP233NA38 and 1NAvaginalwhiteP333NA39 and 2NAC-sectionwhiteP419NA24 and 4 (preterm)NAvaginalAfrican AmericanP524NA37 and 1NAC-sectionAfrican AmericanCOVID-19-positive womenS117anosmia (no cough or other symptoms)37 and 1NAvaginalwhiteS232asymptomatic37 and 5chronic hypertension, pre-eclampsia with severe featuresvaginalAfrican AmericanS323asymptomatic39 and 3gestational hypertensionvaginalAfrican AmericanS428asymptomatic23 and 5 (preterm)NAC-sectionAfrican AmericanS532cough, dyspnea, chest pain, n/v, chills38 and 1gestational hypertensionC-sectionAfrican American\n\nSARS-CoV-2 colonizes multiple compartments in the maternal-fetal interface\n\nBiopsies were taken from multiple sections: (1) BP (or decidua, which represents the maternal face of the placenta); placental VT (VT) (which represents the fetal compartment comprising STBs and CTBs); FMs; SC; and UC. The placental VTs also included fetal macrophages termed Hofbauer cells (HCs). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was determined in term placental sections from SARS-CoV-2-positive women at RNA ( A–1F) as well as protein level ( G–1L) using RNA probes for SARS-CoV-2-S RNA and an antibody against the S protein using RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. The corresponding controls for RNAscope ISH and IHC are presented in A and 1G, respectively.\n\nSARS-CoV-2-S RNA and S protein localized to EVTs in the BP and STBs in the villous placenta ( B, 1C, 1H, and 1I), supporting recent published studies showing SARS-CoV-2 in the placenta.49 , 50 , 69 However, we determined that the virus was also found in fetal macrophages present in villous capillaries ( C, left inset, and 1I, right inset), stromal cells of the chorionic plate ( D and 1J), and amniotic epithelial cells of the FM ( E and 1K). Finally, we note evidence of the virus in the tunica adventitial layer of the UC ( F and 1L). Together, our findings indicate that the virus can colonize multiple compartments at the maternal-fetal interface, including trophoblasts, stromal cells, immune cells, and epithelial cells.\n\nPreterm placenta harbors higher abundance of SARS-CoV-2 and histopathological abnormalities\n\nThe preterm placenta delivered at 23 weeks and 5 days harbored an abundance of S protein in EVTs ( A and 2G) and in STBs and HCs ( B, 2C, and 2H). SARS-CoV-2 S RNA and protein were present in higher abundance in stromal cells of the SC ( D and 2I), amniotic epithelial cells ( E and 2J), and the UC ( F, inset, and 2K). These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can colonize all compartments at the maternal-fetal interface even earlier in gestation. Indeed, severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be greater in preterm than term tissue as observed by RNA-ISH staining of SARS-CoV-2-S ( and ). Consistent with this, pathological changes were evident in the preterm placenta relative to term placentas. The term placentas did not show any significant histopathological changes ( A–3E, left panel). However, the preterm placenta had trophoblast giant cells in the BP ( A, right panel) but no changes in VT ( B, right panel). The subchorion harbored infiltration of neutrophils indicative of increased inflammation ( C, right panel). The FM showed amniotic edema and acute chorioamnionitis (inset, D, right panel) and the presence of necrotic amniocytes in addition to pigmented macrophages ( D, right panel). The umbilical cord revealed acute funisitis or vasculitis ( E, right panel). There was no histological correlation between asymptomatic versus symptomatic placentas of SARS-CoV-2-positive women.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 is expressed in the placenta and is downregulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\nSARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as entry receptor, which is abundantly expressed in different organs of the body.70, 71, 72, 73 A few studies predating the pandemic have suggested that the placenta is no exception.74 , 75 Here, using IHC with antibodies to ACE2, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative and preterm and term placentas for localization of ACE2 in multiple compartments. We found ACE2 expression in EVTs ( A and 4D), STBs ( B and 4E), HCs ( B and 4E), as well as in the FM ( C and 4F).\n\nRecent studies have shown that, upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, interaction between viral S protein and an intact and cell-surface-localized ACE2 leads to the internalization of ACE2, which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, resulting in infection.76 Semiquantitative analysis of IHC images of infected ( D–4F) versus uninfected placental sections ( A–4C) showed a significant reduction in the level of ACE2 expression after SARS-CoV-2 infection ( G). A similar observation was found after western blotting quantification of ACE2 levels in SARS-CoV-2-positive and uninfected term placentas ( H, left panel). Furthermore, ACE2 levels were relatively lower in preterm placenta, and severe infection was associated with a greater decrease ( H, right panel). Thus, not only does the placenta express the viral entry receptor ACE2, it is actively responsive to infection, which results in its downregulation, which is itself indicative of infection.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with dysregulation of the RAS pathway\n\nThe RAS is a complex cascade of vasoactive peptides controlling angiogenesis, blood pressure, and fetal development and is made up of two major axes: inflammatory angiotensin II (Ang II)/(AT1R; vasoconstrictive) and the anti-inflammatory protective axis ACE2/Ang-(1-7) (angiotensin II type 1 receptor 2 [AT2R]; vasodilatory).77 SARS-CoV-2 entry via ACE2 causes downregulation of membrane-bound ACE278 in other tissues, an occurrence we now show is recapitulated in the placenta. We reasoned that reduced ACE2 due to SARS-CoV-2 infection could impact the RAS system. Impaired RAS function and increase in the inflammatory AT1R could lead to increased production of pre-eclampsia markers, including soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt1).79, 80, 81, 82 Consistent with this, we observed increased levels of sFlt1 in the pre-delivery sera of SARS-CoV-2-infected versus uninfected pregnant women ( I). Pre-eclampsia is associated with increased serum secretion of an autoantibody (AT1-AA) that stimulates the AT1R receptor on trophoblasts, where it synergistically acts with Ang II to impair RAS function, leading to increased production of sFlt1.79, 80, 81, 82 Indeed, we note that the pre-delivery sera of SARS-CoV-2-infected women exhibited significantly increased levels of AT1 autoantibodiesAT1-AA ( J). Furthermore, the patients with increased AT1-AA and sFlt1 were diagnosed with chronic hypertension or gestational hypertension.\n\nIt has been shown that the viral S protein can induce internalization of ACE2, which initiates the fusion of viral particles and host cells.76 , 77 , 83, 84, 85 To model the complex interaction between host receptor and viral S protein and investigate the mechanistic link with RAS pathway activity, we treated placental trophoblast cells (JEG-3 cells) with the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein in culture. We noted a significant reduction in the expression of ACE2 at 3 and 6 h post-S protein treatment compared to untreated control cells ( A). Immunofluorescence staining and western blotting for ACE2 showed that S treatment leads to reduction of ACE2 levels in placental cells, corroborating our placental data ( C and 5D).\n\nIn addition, to model whole-virus interaction with ACE2 in placental cells, we also employed a replication-competent virus to study entry and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2.86 This pseudovirus (VSV-EGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S) permits folding and presentation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in its native form. Infection of placental cells with VSV-EGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S at 1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) shows a significant reduction in the expression of ACE2 at all the time points (1, 3, and 6 h) studied compared to 0 h control cells ( B). Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that the expression of ACE2 is reduced after VSV-EGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S infection ( E). Together, these cellular findings confirmed that viral S protein interaction with ACE2 on placental cells leads to ACE2 downregulation. Next, we determined the consequences of ACE2 decrease on RAS activity in placental trophoblasts. We found a significant increase in expression of the inflammatory AT1R (1 h) after the addition of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein; expression of AT1R was significantly high at all time points compared to 0 h JEG-3 cells (Figure S1A). We confirmed the same findings in the presence of VSV-EGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S infection at 1 MOI as compared to 0 h control (Figure S1B). In contrast, expression of the protective angiotensin II type 1 receptor 2 (AT2R) and placental growth factor (PlGF) was significantly downregulated after S treatment (Figures S1C and S1E) and VSV-EGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S infection (Figures S1D and S1F). S protein treatment was sufficient to induce a significant increase in sFlt1 (Figure S1G). Furthermore, levels of sFlt1 were upregulated after VSV-EGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S at 1 and 3 h of infection compared to uninfected controls (Figure S1H). The data here strongly suggest that, even in the absence of viral nucleic acid, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 S antigen is enough to induce pre-eclamptic signatory markers in trophoblasts.\n\nTogether, our in vitro and tissue findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to reduced expression of ACE2, resulting in downregulation of the protective AT2R and PlGF and upregulation of the proinflammatory AT1R, AT1-AA, and sFlt1 arms of the RAS cascade.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we detected both viral S RNA and protein in all five placentas (four term and one preterm) from SARS-CoV-2-infected women. We described the presence of SARS-CoV-2 S RNA and protein at the maternal-fetal interface, showing virus colonization in EVTs, STBs, HCs, stromal cells, amniotic epithelium, and tunica adventitia layer of the UC. Earlier studies have shown evidence of SARS-CoV-2 S or nucleocapsid protein in STBs, EVTs, FM, and HCs, which support our findings.44 , 49, 50, 51 The abundance of viral S RNA and protein was high in preterm placenta compared to term infected placenta of SARS-CoV-2-infected women. The colonization of virus was greater in the maternal decidua (BP) and fetal VT compared to other compartments of the placenta. Although viral infection at term did not appear to be associated with significant histopathological changes consistent with a number of recent studies,7 , 8 , 44 , 45 , 49 the preterm placenta exhibited significant inflammation, including neutrophil infiltration. A second-trimester case study has also reported abnormalities in the placenta, including perivillous fibrin deposition and inflammatory infiltrates.43 , 56 Together, these studies suggest the possibility that SARS CoV-2 infection is more severe in preterm placenta. Whether the virus would also show similarly increased abundance in the term placentas examined earlier in gestation or whether there is a more causal relationship between the virus and the time of delivery remains unclear. Detection of virus in HCs supports the possibility of fetal infection as HCs, which serve as vectors that transmit many viruses (Zika virus [ZIKV], human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], and human cytomegalovirus [HCMV]), although HCs can also induce immunomodulatory cytokines that limit viral replication.87, 88, 89, 90, 91\n\nThe high affinity of SARS-CoV-2 toward ACE2 aids in viral entry that subsequently triggers downregulation of ACE2 expression, disrupting the equilibrium of the RAS pathway.76 , 77 , 92 The importance of ACE2 and RAS in pregnancy is supported by several pieces of evidence. First, expression of renin and angiotensin increases as pregnancy progresses.93 Second, mice lacking Ace2 exhibit placental dysfunction, as evidenced by abnormal uterine remodeling, placental hypoxia, and uterine artery reactivity to vasoconstrictors.94 Third, the circulating levels of renin and angiotensin 1 are lower in women with pre-eclampsia than in normotensive women.95 Fourth, ACE2 is expressed in multiple cell types throughout the body, and its expression can be altered due to pregnancy. A recent study showed the downregulation of ACE2 in the nasal epithelium of pregnant rats compared with non-pregnant rats.96 Finally, reduction in ACE2 can pivot the RAS to become more inflammatory with increased activity of AT1 97 and a concomitant reduction in AT2 receptor. Indeed, a 2005 study on SARS-CoV infection showed that reduced ACE2 levels and increased expression of AT1R promotes disease pathogenesis in the lung.98\n\nIn our studies, treatment or infection of trophoblast cells with SARS-CoV-2 S recombinant protein and modified virus (VSV-EGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S) led to reduced ACE2 expression levels. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas harbored reduced ACE2 levels. Reduced ACE2 correlated with an imbalance in the RAS pathway reflected in increased expression of the proinflammatory AT1R arm of the RAS pathway and concomitant downregulation of the AT2R protective arm. Thus, the increased expression of sFlt1 and downregulation of PlGF found in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients further suggests a potential mechanism for the endothelial dysfunction associated with multi-organ failure.76 , 99 , 100 Given the critical role of balanced angiogenic (e.g., PlGF) and antiangiogenic (e.g., sFlt1) factors required for normal placental angiogenesis, the dysregulation of PlGF and sFlt1 in SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas specifically suggests a mechanism for pre-eclampsia in COVID-19 patients supported by increased secretion of AT1 autoantibodies. Therefore, targeting RAS and the various specific components dysregulated by viral infection could improve pregnancy outcomes in pregnant patients with COVID-19. However, a number of recent clinical studies are uncovering a strong link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the probability of pre-eclampsia in SARS-CoV-2-infected severe and non-severe pregnant groups.31 , 47 , 80 , 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 Our study provides mechanistic support for this link. In addition, large and diverse cohort studies, including from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network, suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 are at increased risk of perinatal complications.22 , 31 In sum, our study provides the foundation to understand the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 affects pregnancy by downregulating ACE2 expression in placental trophoblast cells and subsequently dysregulating the RAS pathway.\n\nLimitations of study\n\nOur study is limited by the small number of placentas analyzed, which are not powered to determine an association of infection and changes in ACE2 expression with expression of pre-eclampsia markers. Further studies are warranted to validate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnancy and on adverse hemodynamic outcomes, such as pre-eclampsia in pregnant women.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was funded in part by NIH/NICHD grants R01 HD091218 and 3R01HD091218-04S1 (RADx-UP Supplement; to I.U.M.), McDonnell International Academy Award (to I.U.M.), and Washington University CTSA (BJF/ICTS) award (to E.B.C.).
