        "text": "💡 Exploring the Future of Audit at PwC - Exciting Times Ahead: 💡 Anyone for #LegoFridays? We had a very fun workshop last week exploring what lies ahead for our industry. Working in #Innovation in #DigitalAudit at PwC, it's our philosophy to continuously adapt, embrace innovation, and focus on delivering insights and value to clients in an ever-changing business landscape. But given the pace of change in the last 18 months, our Partners took time out to think differently. We put ourselves in our clients’ shoes and challenged ourselves to think about what the #AuditoftheFuture might look like from their perspective and assess the potential impact of The new Essential Eight technologies. Technology is the key enabler in evolving our approach to align with our clients’ transformation journeys and strengthening the foundations of our audit approach will always be quality and trust. More updates to come as we continue to explore the #FutureofAudit and #GenAI. And most importantly, will #LegoFridays become a thing? Jass Sarai Marc Bena EL Hassane Ferdaous Michael Campbell Emma Neal Matt Putt #TAP #FutureOfAudit #Innovation #GenAI #PwCProud #ChatPwC #LegoSeriousPlay\n\nReflecting on an invigorating \"Learning Day\" with the vibrant Innovation & Ventures squad at Deloitte Germany! 🚀 Every sector has pivotal \"innovation themes\" for the near future and grasping them is foundational to both immediate and long-term success. This year, we zeroed in on the future of I&V, aiming to: · Dive deeper into relevant, challenging client needs 🎯 · Amplify our commercial impact 💡 · Nurture and expand our team’s capabilities and well-being 🌱 Alignment is key. As we set our sights on these themes, it's vital they resonate with our overarching corporate strategy. This might mean the birth of new business units or ventures, seamlessly integrated within our structure. But how do we bring this to life? A robust operating model. One that enables businesses to swiftly transition their portfolio of assets from inception to market, leveraging the foundational systems and processes of our organization. To true end-to-end innovation, it's about: · Knowing where to play 📍 · Understanding how to operate efficiently 🔄 · Executing with precision and purpose ⚙️ Onward and upward, Team! Let's shape the future, together. #Innovation #Strategy #DeloitteGarage\n\nAs part of our continuous hunt to offer best in class advisory and execution services to help our client's improve business performance and productivity, Paris Clark-Roden and I have just returned from a fantastic trip to Krakow, Poland, to meet with Michal Targiel and Michał Kucharczyk, MBA who lead our PwC #IntelligentAutomation and #AI team, where we discussed how we continue to innovate our approach to creating and realising value for clients in high stakes situations. We covered topics such as: 🤖 Live #GenAI use cases that can be adopted by clients now to unlock value, in the context of broader end to end #OperationalExcellence and automation 🏅 The importance of setting up multi-skilled digital teams to harness multiple perspectives, technical expertise and maximise potential benefits when we complete our #RapidCostDiagnostic exercises 🎯 Cutting through the noise - #demystifying technology for leadership teams in order to form a strategic, #IntegratedApproach to #automation, as part of overall #WorkforceOptimisation 💡 How to #disrupt the traditional automation #DeliveryModel to deliver more effective outcomes, faster - whilst spotting where wider value levers are better placed to help improve business performance and productivity An action packed couple of days but grateful the team were still able to give us a taste of the local culture in Krakow - what a city⚡. We'll be back for sure and saving room for more #dumplings… 🥟 🥟 🥟 If any of my network would be interested in learning more about how we’re approaching automation in our #ValueCreationandRealisation team at #PwC, feel free to reach out for a chat. Zena Gridley Tim Allen\n\n⚓ **Moin from Hamburg - EY Germany’s All Staff Event 2024** Networking and connecting with my colleagues from various service lines is always an enriching experience for me, especially when it is in one of my favorite cities! Events like these provide a great opportunity to discuss market trends, innovations, and the evolving landscape of our industry. Inspired by panels and guest speakers, let me share some questions my colleagues and I are currently reflecting: ▶ Transformation realized: Transformation is the interplay of people, innovation, and technology to create a better functioning world 👉 Where does employee centricity meet the future of work? 👉 Where does innovation meet the new \"S-curve\" of growth? ♻ Long-term & sustainable growth: Digital transformation remains at the heart of many transformation movements. At the same time, sustainability is becoming a necessity for every company 👉 Why should digitalization and sustainability be addressed together? 👉 What synergies need to be unlocked? 😎 Talent development: Diversity is our strength for building high-performing teams 👉 How does diversity affect teamwork? But at the end of the day, it all comes down to one point and reminds me of the power of collaboration. \"Together, we can drive forward-thinking solutions and shape the future of consulting - #betterworkingworld\"🌍. 🚨 Stay tuned for deeper insights, as my colleague Florian Kaltenberger shares his personal experience about these two days.

As much as this transformative technology is a powerful ally in shaping enterprise’s sustainable and prosperous future in the age of innovation, there are considerations that CFOs need to ponder before they confidently embark on adopting GenAI for their business. Attend the 4th Annual FutureCFO Malaysia Conference at W Hotel Kuala Lumpur on 26 June 2024, and discover the opportunities and risks of Generative AI for CFOs from our ensemble of distinguished speakers: Rachel Hong Pui Chee, Finance Controller, Jollibee Malaysia, Stephanie Sim, FCCA, C.A. (M), Chartered Banker, SVP, Head of Group Finance, MIDF, Dajmarehan Zolkipli, Acting CEO, Tune Talk and Tomasz Gaczynski, Enterprise Automation & AI Presales Manager, South East Asia, UiPath. During this session, our panelists will address how GenAI is shaping the future of business and finance teams in Malaysia, meeting the challenges of AI deployments for finance and best practices of Responsible applications of Gen AI .

An exciting exploration of Rethink! where anything is possible! Let's ask ourselves important questions that shape our future. Can we deeply see? Can we be curious? Can we get outside our comfort zones to see the future possibilities? As Leonard Bernstein said, \"To achieve great things, two things are required: a plan and not quite enough time.\" Let's push ourselves beyond our limits and discover new possibilities. Check out: https://lnkd.in/e2gFncNc #EY #rethink #innovationrealized #betterquestion\n\n💡 This week has been filled with interesting stuff. Four different events & meetings related to generative AI , Financial planning & analysis and trade finance. On Tuesday I participated international FP&A Board's event at Regus Signature Helsinki and discussed how financial planning is done across the organizations from Finnish listed companies to global startups. The group saw as key challenges within FP&A -field the integration of systems, data structures, short reaction time and volatility of market and technology (and how people use it). Event host and CEO of FP&A Trends Group Larysa Melnychuk presented a graph that showed that the past five years has moved the needle from low impact activities in FP&A towards the high impact activities. Even though the trend is positive and AI might help us to accelerate the development, there is still a lot of work to do where we could improve the ways we work together. 📈 Evgenia Elezova (Head of Finance at Lindström) presented the group a case on how FP&A would benefit from business partnering. In this two-year-long process 26 Lindström’s country Business controllers contributed to the program that they call “Business Partner Academy”. Program included monthly meetings and developed not only substance skills but also soft skills (presenting, communication). 🤝 In smaller subgroups we also sat down to discuss the key steps to enable moving from traditional FP&A towards Extended Planning and Analysis (xP&A). Subgroups were “Data and Models”, “Systems and Processes” and “People and Culture”. These could be reflected to other Chapters (Dubai, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Munich, Riyadh to name a few) experiences to see that many things are common around the globe 🌍"
