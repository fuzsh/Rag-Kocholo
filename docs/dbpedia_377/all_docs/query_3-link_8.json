        "text": "Our Impact\n\nJesus is the perfect example of effective ministry. He is The Effective Minister. We seek to imitate him by helping people:\n\nBECOME devoted followers of Christ. (Matthew 16:16-20)\n\nBELONG to a family. (Acts 17:22-31)\n\nBUILD God’s kingdom (Ephesians 4:7-16)\n\nOur Purpose\n\nTo proclaim the good news about Jesus Christ.\n\nTo teach the Bible as the word of God.\n\nTo fellowship with those of like faith.\n\nTo support missions.\n\nTo maintain a place of worship.\n\nOur leadership focuses on church health, a goal we believe Jesus establishes in Ephesians 4 and Revelation 2-3. A healthy organism grows as God intends, but growth by itself proves nothing. Tumors grow rapidly. We pursue healthy growth so we become devoted followers of Christ by empowering the faith journey so we belong to a family that is embracing our community as we build God’s kingdom by encouraging each other’s development of their gifts and passions to make a difference.\n\nGrace\n\nGrace is God’s unmerited favor shown to us in creation (we exist, Rev 4:11), providence (our needs are able to be met, Acts 14:15-17), and the good news of Jesus Christ (Eph 2:8-10). God’s grace has done so much for us that we cannot do for ourselves. Therefore, we should reflect such grace.\n\nBible\n\nWe want to be people who are serious about knowing God, and the final authority for what we claim to know about God is the Bible (2 Tim 3:16-17). Therefore, the Bible is the foundation of our teaching. This does not mean the Bible is an end in itself. The Bible is a means to an end: knowing God.\n\nIt is a trustworthy map used to guide us through life’s journey. We exist to experience God (John 17:3). The Bible gives the ability to place life’s journey in its proper context so this can occur. That is true knowledge (2 Tim 3:15).\n\nCHURCH\n\nThe Church is not a building or place. It is people called by God to represent Him and show others what God is doing in their lives. God wants to change lives through the power of Jesus Christ. The people who have experienced that power are the Church (2 Tim 3:5), which includes all believers throughout the world (1 Cor 12:13)."
