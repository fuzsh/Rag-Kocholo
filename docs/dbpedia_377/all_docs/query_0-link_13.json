        "meta_description": "Martine Rothblatt’s patented inventions span the fields of satellite communication, medicinal biochemistry and cognitive software. As the founder of the satellite radio network SiriusXM, she had already revolutionized the fields of communications and broadcasting, when her seven-year-old daughter fell ill.  Doctors diagnosed pulmonary hypertension, an incurable lung disorder, and gave the child little chance of surviving to adulthood. This unexpected crisis led to an abrupt career change.  Setting aside her past business commitments, Rothblatt gave herself a crash course in medical science and founded a new company, United Therapeutics, to find a treatment that could save her daughter’s life.  Since then, the company has developed successful treatments for pulmonary hypertension, as well as for the cancer neuroblastoma.  Martine Rothblatt’s books and published writings range over subjects from gender identity to the concepts of “mind uploading” and “technological immortality.” She has been repeatedly cited as the highest-paid executive in the biopharmaceutical industry and the highest-paid female chief executive in the world.  Today, she is Chair and CEO of United Therapeutics, and her adult daughter works alongside her.",

        "text": "We’re going to shift gears now and ask about your early life. What was it like for you growing up?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: So it was a good life growing up. I would say that I really had every advantage and my parents loved me. They loved each other madly. They were married for almost 50 years. So it was a great life growing up. But I think it was a great life actually, because of things that happened when I was really barely cognizant of what life was all about in my first ten years.\n\nSo first, my father was in a horrible car accident. And he was paralyzed as a result of this car accident shortly after he had set up this dental office in a suburb of San Diego. So he had no way to go to the dental office. He was paralyzed on the bed, and he had borrowed all this money to set up the dental office. He had to declare bankruptcy. He had to let go of his employees. He began studying accounting because he thought that was the only way that he could support his family.\n\nHow old were you?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I was five years old. The next thing that happened was that they found out that there was an experimental procedure — surgery —available at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. He was air-ambulanced to Rochester. They fixed his spine, and he came back walking, able to be a dentist again, became a bowler! I mean, you name it, they completely fixed him.\n\nWhat kind of impact did that have on you?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: It had a huge impact, which I’ve only really appreciated recently. I shared this story last month when I opened up, at the Mayo Clinic, the world’s first lung restoration center, where lungs that are donated after people die but are not useful for transplantation are thrown away. We take them from the bio waste and restore them to being a perfectly good lung that ends up being transplanted in other people.\n\nSo when I cut the ribbon on the center where we do this at the Mayo just a couple weeks ago, I told the story. I said I want everybody to know I feel especially proud to open up this center at the Mayo Clinic, because I would not be the positive, optimistic person I am if the Mayo Clinic had not really saved my father’s life. If I had grown up with a father who was embittered, who felt they studied to be a dentist and now they were stuck in bed all the time and he would be embittered, I would have been embittered, I think. I think I would have been a depressed kid, followed narrow horizons. Instead, my dad was like, “Look, I’ve been cured by technology. Technology is awesome. It’s positive. It’s given me my life back.” And I said, “The fact that we have this huge center now at the Mayo Clinic, that’s kind of what goes around, comes around. You know, you guys saved my father and I’m here now, able to help you save hundreds of other people who need lung transplants.”\n\nWhen we signed our agreement with the Mayo Clinic, I went to the waiting room, which is no longer their reception room, which is like the one that my father went to. All like wood, wood paneled stuff and whatnot. And it was like, “Whoa, this is like where I feel my life began.”\n\nHow do you mean your life began?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I think it began because that was when my father… That was when, like in a quantum sense, my life could have gone two directions. It could have gone the “life’s not fair and you just have to deal with that,” or “Life is amazing, and you need to celebrate it.” That was when, and I saw there was like a quantum kind of split there in that hospital reception room at the Mayo where I had never been in. But I knew for sure my father had been there.\n\nI think because other individuals helped my parents overcome from car accidents that would have led them to have very depressed lives and would have ended up bringing my sister and I up in a very depressed environment. But because other people before me made the world a better place with science and technology, it allowed me to be brought up in a household of optimism and positivism.\n\nDo you think of that as just good luck?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: There’s certainly an element of luck in it. But there’s also a huge element in that people made their luck. So the surgeons who developed that procedure, it didn’t just fall from the skies. Those surgeons had developed that procedure over a number of years. The Mayo Clinic, if you read the story about the Mayo brothers and their wives — who were unsung heroes but were equally responsible. The women of the Mayo, which are now being finally recognized and celebrated, were the bedrock of it. So all of that wasn’t luck. The Mayo was the result of blood, sweat and tears, and science and technology and advancement.\n\nThen the fact that between my father and my mother, they were persistent in pinging their doctors. “Isn’t there…” Obviously, there was no Google or anything back then. But pinging their doctors, “Isn’t there anything? Have you heard of anything?” So one of my parents’ doctors must have told them that, “We heard of something at the Mayo. We’ll refer you.” So it was persistence. One of my mantras at United Therapeutics in general is just like, “Persistence is omnipotence.” If you don’t give up, you won’t fail. So there was that persistence in my parents’ cultural DNA.\n\nYour father was paralyzed for a year. Your daughter was so sick you thought she was going to die. You went through a lot when you came out as transgender. You give off this vibe that everything’s been easy. Hasn’t it been hard at times?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Compared to what other people have been through, it has been easy. I mean, we are in a world where people are bombed relentlessly. Can you imagine what it would be like to be a kid and you can’t see? Hear bombs crashing? There are people who don’t eat for days at a time. I’m sure, you fast for the day here or there and you know what happens when your stomach starts gripping. There are people who are in terrible physical pain. There’s a lot of bad things in the world. Compared to all of those bad things I have nothing to complain about.\n\nHow did you first become involved with new technology and invention? What were you thinking of inventing?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I was thinking of inventing ways to live in space. And thinking of inventing ways to have orbiting space cities that would relieve the overpopulation of the Earth. As we just talked, both of us being kind of like children of the ‘60s. So when we got to the ‘70s and ‘80s, that was the first time people were kind of saying there’s overpopulation, because the world’s population had begun doubling pretty quickly by that time. And I thought that, you know, “Why are we thinking that there’s overpopulation when we’re just like on one tiny speck of a planet and there’s a vast galaxy of millions, hundreds of millions, actually billions of planets out there? Why can’t we build huge colonies that orbit around the Earth, orbit around the sun, go out and live in space?”\n\nIt’s a kind of a logically obvious place to go. It’s just as obvious as when everybody was sort of stuck in Europe and there and there was overcrowding. The lords and the kings had all the land, and the serfs and the regular people had nothing.\n\nSo then, “Why don’t we cross this ocean and go to these other places? Well, yeah, there’s people there but we could just take the land away from them and at least we’ll have land. We can’t take the land away from the kings because they’re more powerful than us and will kill us.”\n\nHow far away are we from people living in space?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Definitely this century. There’s no doubt about it. I would say…30 years.\n\nAnd what does a space colony look like?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: It does not look like the International Space Station. It looks like what Gerry O’Neill originally wrote about in The High Frontier, which was his book. Which is a miles-long structure with a blue sky inside it, because it’s so deep that there’s atmosphere and on the people live on the inside cylinder, the inside surface of the cylinder of the structure. The cylinder rotates like this, so there’s always artificial earth gravity on the living surface. So you’re walking around, you’re not floating around. You have 24- hour sunlight for agricultural areas and normal day and night cycles. It’s just like super, super, super, super-sizing the biggest malls that we have today.\n\nWould there be an advantage to living up there as opposed to, say, Connecticut?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I don’t necessarily think so. I think it’s different. I couldn’t say that one is better than the other. I’m often asked by people, “Are you going to buy a ticket to go into orbit?” I always say no. I feel I’m on the coolest spaceship of all right, on the Earth. I’m an amateur astronomer at night. I look at the stars and I treasure the stars. This is the best spaceship… in the Earth. The Earth is the best spaceship.\n\nWhy do you treasure the stars?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: They connect me to a larger reality.\n\nWhat does that feel like?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: It feels beautiful. It feels beautiful, it just feels like… I always like to transcend the border of my skin. It’s why, to me, love is the most powerful of all forces that humans ever experience. Because when you love another person, you have transcended your skin. You’ve bonded with that other person. And there is something in the human spirit that loves to connect.\n\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Wow, you just get right to it don’t you? I think the meaning of life is to enjoy it. I think the meaning of life is to enjoy it, is enjoyment, is happiness, is happiness. And happiness is connected to everybody else’s happiness.\n\nThe more people that are happy around you, the happier you’ll be and vice versa. All the way back in the 1600s, Francis Bacon, who wrote like the first encyclopedia of science, he told the king — he was a top lawyer and adviser to the King of England — and he said, “You can’t have most of your people starving and miserable because they’re going to revolt. And when they revolt, they’re going to ask for the king’s head and you’re not going to be very happy.” So it’s in the king’s own interest to raise everybody up. And we just heard John Doerr say pretty much the same thing. One of the most successful investors in contemporary times is telling us that the most important thing is to help everybody else be successful.\n\nThat seems to be where you get your joy from.\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I do. I get my joy, I really get my joy from seeing people happy. It really doesn’t necessarily… if they’re not suffering and they’ve learned a new subject. If somebody has found a new passion, if somebody’s found love. You know what? I just saw Andrew Weil and his new wife; they found love. I’m really, really happy when people fall in love.\n\nDo you ever sleep?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Oh, yeah. I love sleeping.\n\nHow do you know all these different things if you sleep?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Because I love reading. I am the worst bibliophile in the world, I’m the worst person to go to a museum with because I sit there…\n\nHow many books you read in a week?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I read at the same time… My reading habit is I usually read like 10 to 15 books at the same time. So I’ll read like a page of this one, a chapter of this one, two chapters of that one. Three pages of this one.\n\nDo you group them in a certain way?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I really rely on serendipity. I have them open, the ones I like — not the Kindle books — I have them open. And then just moment to moment I go by serendipity, which book calls out to me.\n\nSo you could mix a poetry book with a biography, with a memoir?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Oh yeah. With science, with physics, with astronomy.\n\nDo you think that helps you create some of your ideas?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Totally, totally.\n\nAnd what is that magic mix? Is it being attuned to — or being open to —serendipity?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Being curious. Loving. Loving human culture. Loving nature. I think I’d say between those three things. Curiosity, like, “I’m curious about this. How does this work?” I will say I am curious about everything. I don’t think there’s anything that I’m not curious about. I’m curious about fashion, I’m curious about art, curious about music, curious about architecture.\n\nThat’s why I think this Academy is so awesome, because there’s such a diversity of people who are recognized here and who are present here. Upstairs, just before I met you, there’s Andrew Weil, who’s a naturopathic person. I’m talking with him and I’m talking with Steven Rosenberg, who is the antithesis of that. He is the solid, normal cancer medicine thing, but everybody is together. And not to even get into the musicians and all that. So I’ll show you a good example.\n\nI was out yesterday for coffee with a friend of mine, Art Kaplan. He’s one of the — he probably is the U.S. number one bioethicists and he’s at NYU. He was important to one thing I wanted to do, which is we manufacture these organs. But to manufacture an organ, before you put it in a person, the FDA of course wants you to test it in an animal.\n\nHowever, an animal is not a person. Their immune system is completely different. And if I manufacture an organ designed to work good in a person, it’s not going to work very good in the animal, the animal’s immune system will attack it. So I came up with the idea of, “How about the people who have donated their bodies to science, but we can’t use their organs, perhaps because they have an infection or they have cancer, but they’ve donated their bodies to science? Can we use these bodies that had been donated to science to test our manufactured organs in?” So that’s like in a way is kind of crazy, nobody’s ever done that before.\n\nDo you mt’s crazy that no one thought of it?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Well, it sounds a little macabre. Anytime you deal with dead people, I mean. This is why I kind of preferred being in satellite communications, because it’s cleaner. But nobody thought about it before. I met through — again serendipity, because I’m curious — I went to the Kennedy Center, there was a concert, I met this guy who is the head of transplant medicine at NYU Medical Center, who he himself had heart failure and needed to have a heart transplant transplanted into him by other members of his own team.\n\nYou went to a concert and because you met someone, you had a conversation that led you…\n\nMartine Rothblatt: To testing organs in dead people.\n\nAnd that is going to save lives?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: And that is going to save lives. That’s going to make it possible to have an unlimited supply of transplantable organs.\n\nWhen you can do so many things, why did you pick that to work on? Do you enjoy it most?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I don’t really enjoy being in biology. I think I’m too empathetic a person to be in the life sciences. In the field I’m in, people are constantly dying. Even our patients are dying. We keep them alive as long as we can. Like, we have a medicine for neuroblastoma. It saves the lives of half the kids with neuroblastoma. They never get cancer again. They take their medicine for two months, five years later, they’re cured. They still don’t have the cancer back. They live a normal life. But the other half of the kids, the medicine doesn’t work for. And I meet their parents and it’s some sad stories. We did save our daughter’s life, that’s beautiful. And she’s great, she’s in her 30s, she’s takes our medicine every day. I’ve met many other people whose… the medicine stopped working for them and eventually they died.\n\nWhen you spoke at the Academy, in this room of Nobel laureates and Pulitzer Prize winners and some of the most successful businessmen, you chose to talk about being a good person. And why did you do that?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Because I think kindness is more important than intelligence. When I wrote my book on genetic modification and reproductive freedom, it was called Unzipped Genes. So when I when I wrote that book, I had to think a lot about genetic enhancement and genetic modification, disability rights. I talked to a lot of disability rights people. I talked to people with spina bifida to really understand their take on genetic modification. And I came to, a lot of people said, “Well, it would be good if we made ourselves smarter and smarter through genetic modification.”\n\nAnd I became really skeptical about that. I said, “We could become as smart as we want right now just by… we’ve got unlimited hundreds of millions of children who are born that received scarcely any education at all. Every human being’s got a brain that’s better than the fastest supercomputer we’ve ever made. I don’t think it’s a matter of we’re not smart enough. The smartest people in the country got us into world war after world war and endless wars and now global warming on the brink of extinction. I don’t think we need more smartness. I think we need more kindness.\n\n(START HERE)\n\nHow do we get that? How do we get more kindness?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I haven’t figured out anything better than Gandhi’s quote of being the change you want to see.\n\nYou’ve certainly made a change in the world. The medicines United Therapeutics has produced have saved so many lives. How does that make you feel?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I feel blessed. I feel lucky. I feel kissed by life, like life just planted a whole row of kisses on me. I feel grateful.\n\nWhen you spoke to the Academy, you were talking about grace, “an undeserved benefit” as you said. Can everyone have grace?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I believe so. I do believe so.\n\nWhy do you single out that word as important?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Because I try to understand in my mind, why is it that people are so stupid and yet humanity moves forward. It seems to me if it’s just like everybody was as stupid as it seems we are, myself included… I do stupid things. We all do stupid things, and you know, we’ve got enough nuclear weapons to kill everybody multiple times over.\n\nSo why is it that when we’re enmeshed with so much stupidity, we actually are living for most people the best lives that we ever lived? We eradicate smallpox, we’ve eradicated smallpox, which was the worst killer that human life ever faced. We’re getting close to eradicating other diseases. We very much manage HIV, which in my own lifetime was like a horrible epidemic that came out of nowhere and killed people I knew and loved.\n\nAnd now it’s like a manageable condition that people can live their whole lives with. So when I try to understand how is it that that out of all the vast stupidity of humanity, we’re able to nevertheless move ourselves forward, I think it’s this thing called grace. That it starts with a few people wanting to do something to overcome nature, overcome randomness, overcome evilness.\n\nThe lady I was sitting next to — the Nobel laureate from Liberia [Leyma Gbowee]—overcoming evil, evilness. And one person does that, they inspire other people. Like now I have a thousand people in United Therapeutics. If you ask most anybody in the company though, “What’s our purpose?” They say, “We are going to create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs, so nobody ever has to die on the organ wait list again.” That’s grace. That’s being courageous in the face of both blind nature, bad luck, and human stupidity.\n\nYou have quoted Einstein saying there are two things that are infinite, the universe and human stupidity.\n\nMartine Rothblatt: And he wasn’t sure about the first. He was certain about the second.\n\nWhen you say we’re stupid, what do you mean? Can you give us some examples of stupid things?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Building enough nuclear weapons to kill everybody in the world multiple times over is stupid. Ignoring the absolutely clear evidence that humans are increasing the temperature of the world, the ice caps are melting, and not turning on a dime to reverse that. But instead in a very realistic — and it’s funny how ironic the example is — putting the pedal to the metal. And withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords, spewing more pollution. All of it. And we’re all not… None of us are angels. We’re all sinners, I take trips that I don’t need to take. I make more carbon footprint that I need to make. So I’m not saying that I’m any less stupid than everybody else.\n\nGiven all these things that are happening, you stay positive. Do we keep advancing because there’s a good energy?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: There is a good energy. And I think that that’s actually a beautiful synonym for what I mean by grace. There is a good energy that persists despite stupidity. And if you look at the arc of all human history, it’s kind of like Martin Luther King’s quote that, you know, the arc of [history] is long, but it ultimately bends towards justice.\n\nSo I’d say the arc of good energy, the arc of grace is long, but it ultimately will surpass stupidity. For example, at United Therapeutics we’ve built the world’s largest zero-carbon footprint building. It’s in our headquarters in Silver Spring, it has zero-carbon footprint. It’s a 150,000-square foot, ten-story building full of laboratories. We use the Earth as our battery to store all of the heating and cooling.\n\nAnd if some people come to your place in Maryland and try to copy that…\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I wish more would. It opened last year, and I invite you to come and visit it. We put right on the walls of the building that the purpose of this building is to inspire a thousand other buildings like this.\n\nAnd you talk about the knock-on effect of good energy.\n\nMartine Rothblatt: And that is grace. That is grace. For the whole world to not drown in global warming is a kind of an undeserved benefit, because the whole world didn’t necessarily do anything to create a zero-carbon footprint future. But enough people are contributing to that, and it knocks on and knocks on and knocks on.\n\nEven like the smallpox example I gave. Yeah, it was great that Edward Jenner came up with this almost 200 years ago. But it’s the vaccinator in Afghanistan who risks her life to go into the tiniest village where people actually think she may be a CIA agent or something like that — because of the way we went around the whole Osama thing — that risks her life to vaccinate the last person to wipe out [smallpox]. That’s grace. And that one woman vaccinator to me outweighs the mountain of human stupidity.\n\nYou think about so many things, and you’ve said you read so many books at once. Have you ever wondered if you had ADHD or ADD?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never been told that I did.\n\nDo you feel pretty focused?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I do. I would say if anything has pushed me to be ADHD-ish, it is smartphones.\n\nDo you try to limit your use of them?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Not very successfully.\n\nDo you trying to tell your kids to limit their use?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Not very successfully, I bought all my grandkids the best smartphones I could find.\n\nDo you worry about that? A lot of people are worried about the time kids spend on their phones.\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I’m a little bit skeptical because I grew up in the age of television and like I said, I was a communications studies undergrad major at UCLA. And people were saying, “Oh, this generation is ruined from watching television!” I remember statistics that by the time a person is 18, they’ve seen 10,000 people killed in Westerns and whatnot on TV. In fact, I think you turned out pretty good. So I’m a little bit skeptical of that. I will say that my grandkids, play some video games on their computer, which seem like, “Oh my God!” They seem pretty violent, but they’re actually sweet. I’ve never seen them hurt a cat or a dog or really… no anything. I think the human mind, it’s an extraordinary thing, and it can segue off bad things.\n\nI mean, if you want to talk about bad things affecting people, how about the Bible? I’m not saying that the Bible is bad, but I’m saying there’s some amazing violence in the Bible. People stoned to death and burnt for no reason just because they happen to live in a particular city. In fact, all humanity wiped out like some bioterror type of thing. And when that was the only content that people had, they had to read that all year long over and over, and before our generation, people could memorize whole parts of the Bible and whatnot. And all those people pretty much turned out okay. So I’m a skeptic actually that content is responsible for the problems of society.\n\nAnd I’m a skeptic — my law program, when I went to graduate school and law school, it was a communications law program. And we were pretty much persuaded that freedom of speech and freedom of thought are much better than any efforts to constrain them. So I’m pretty skeptical about things like Internet censorship and those kinds of things.\n\nWhat are you most optimistic about as you look at the years ahead? What are you most excited about when it comes to the capability of the human mind?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I’m really excited about the ability to vanquish diseases that cause human suffering. I think pain is a really bad thing and there are a lot of people in pain. They are in pain because of neuromuscular things, or they’re in pain because of cancer. I think that we’ll look back at this point in time and people say, “Oh my God, I can’t believe these people lived their lives in pain.” When I walk in a store sometimes and you’ll see a person, their face locked in a frown. I used to think, “Wow, that’s a mean old person.” And now I realize that that person is probably just in pain, and they’re just kind of grimacing and trying to get through the day.\n\nYou think that physical pain will be gone one day?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes, absolutely. In this century. I’m completely confident of that. And people will think it was crazy. If I was to say, “Did you think one day the threat of mass infectious disease will be gone?” If you were to say that in Thomas Jefferson’s time, they’d say, “No. Are you crazy? There’s an epidemic sweeps through here every couple of years and wipes everybody out and nobody is going to be able to get on top of smallpox or typhoid and all these things.” But oh my God. We’ve knocked off one after another after another, and it used to take centuries.\n\nNow we’re not completely on top of HIV, and there are people that don’t have access to medicines. But let’s look at the big picture: we took a horrible disease that nobody saw coming, wiping out virtually 100 percent of its victims. And in essentially 20 years — which in the span of time is a pretty short period of time — in 20 years we’ve brought the disease under complete management. Somebody can live a normal life span, and we’ve brought the cost of those medicines down to a dollar a day. All in 20 years. A civilization that can do that will definitely, positively get on top of pain and cancer and heart disease in this century.\n\nYou’ve talked about your study methods and the frequency spectrum and all the bodies of information that you’ve mastered. Do you have a photographic memory?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: No.\n\nBut you have a good memory.\n\nMartine Rothblatt: It’s a good memory. I agree. But I’m a big believer in mnemonic devices. For instance I’ll use acronyms to help me remember things.\n\nCan you share one with us?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I have this one acronym called “unither marine.” “Unither” is the contraction of our company’s name, United Therapeutics, and every one of those letters reminds me of one of the people who report to me and the activities that they’re responsible for, because I feel my main responsibility is working for the thousand people at United Therapeutics.\n\nI’ll give you another acronym I like a lot, because you mentioned [the book] Virtually Human. I’m really interested in the meaning of life and the difference between digital life and biological life. One of my favorite acronyms is OMERRDA, which is “O” for organize, a definition of life. So what is the definition of life? People often stumble over that. It’s like, “Well, I’m not really sure is a virus alive, or bacteria or whatever. Is a robot alive?”\n\nSo biologists have agreed that things that are alive are: Organized, that’s the O; exchange matter and energy with the environment, that’s the “ME.” They reproduce, that’s the “R.” They respond to stimuli, that’s a second “R,” They develop, that’s the “D,” and they adapt, that’s the “A.” So whenever I’m stopping and thinking about, “Is this kind of cyber life — cyber consciousness, virtual life, synthetic life — is this alive or not?” I just remember OMERRDA, and that’s how I memorized the biologist definition of life. But I’ve got like a gazillion of those acronyms in my head.\n\nForbes called you one of the “100 Greatest Business Minds,” and many people have talked about your brilliant mind and your perpetual reinvention of things. Most of us are taught in school to “know your lane” and just go deep into one thing. If you had done that, what a loss it would have been. What are we to take from this?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: It’s a good question. I think it’s difficult to apply one person’s lessons to everybody. There are people who would be really good at being a jack of all trades, and there’s people who would be really good at just being a super master pianist, flutist, gene editor, whatever. So everybody needs to be in touch with their own soul. Be wary when people say you can’t do something. Strive for happiness, be practical.\n\nYou ask about little mnemonics and mantras, so the mantra that I live my life most by I break down to C Q P L. And C is “Be curious.” Curiosity, question authority. Okay? So you can be in a narrow lane — deep, deep, deep in a narrow lane — and be very curious, because there’s no subject in the world that you cannot be endlessly curious about. If you’re interested in one particular vegetable, there is an infinite amount of information that can be learned about each particular vegetable. The DNA inside the vegetable, why does that DNA express this way in certain climates and a different way in other climates? How does it interact with the soil, with the light? It’s infinite. How can you make food out of it? What kind of food? What are all the different dishes? Every topic is infinite. Be curious. Which means you’ve got to love life, okay?\n\nSecondly is to question authority. We live in a society of rules and it’s probably deep in our DNA that there’s got to be a rule for this, a rule for that. And it makes sense. The chimpanzees before us that did not follow all of the rules and just ran out in front of the lion got eaten and that DNA didn’t go too far. But now, in our society, question authority. It doesn’t mean walk in front of a truck and say, “I’m going to question the laws of physics.”\n\nBut when the FCC says you can’t do satellite radio?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Then you can do it. Or instead of walking in front of a truck, why don’t you maybe walk around the truck, or find another way. My partner Bina and I, we always say to each other, “Find another way.” Whenever we’re told no, we say, “Find another way.” There are many ways you can’t go, but there is always, always, always another way. Just like there’s an infinite amount of knowledge on any possible topic. There is always another way to do something.\n\nThe third one is to act practically. Every project can be divided up into a lot of small pieces, and every time you do a small piece you will have an energy to do the next piece and the next piece. So no matter what project you have, if you’re writing a book, write a page a day. If you’re trying to manufacture an unlimited supply of organs, start off with manufacturing just a few dozen organs. Trying to manufacture a few dozen organs, start off by manufacturing one organ. You’re trying to manufacture one organ, start off manufacturing part of the organ. See if you could keep it going for a minute or hour a day. Every single problem can be divided up in a number of little pieces.\n\nAnd fourth and finally is “Act lovingly.” Whatever you do, try to do it in a way that’s going to make the world a happier place. To me, love — the definition of love that resonates most with me is the one from Robert Heinlein, who is my favorite science fiction writer. And his definition of love is, “Love is the emotion where the happiness of another person or persons is essential to your own happiness.” So always act in a way to make the world a happier place.\n\nBe curious, question authority, act lovingly and do practically. And love. Do everything out of love.\n\nHow old were you when you thought of these four things?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: It was probably when people began asking me, “How did you accomplish all these things, Martine?” I would say around 50 when I began to speak to other groups and share inspiration with other groups. So I had to kind of analyze what my algorithm was, if I could put it that way.\n\nAnd I realized my algorithm was first just loving knowledge, all that bibliophile, museophile kind of stuff we talked about. Secondly, I realized my algorithm was questioning authority. You could talk to my kids. We had the “Question Authority” bumper sticker on our minivan. “Question Authority,” that’s probably my favorite bumper sticker. That one and “Celebrate Diversity” would be my two favorite bumper stickers. And then the “Do practically” is — everybody of says what you said, “Martine, you’ve got all these great ideas…” But I don’t think it’s the ideas that’s so important, it’s what you do with them. It’s the execution. It’s the being practical.\n\nThe organization I’m most fond of my membership in is called the American Philosophical Society. It was started by Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson in the 1700s and it’s still in existence and active in Philadelphia today. And their mantra, which was developed by Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, was to celebrate useful knowledge. So it’s a practicality and we all know Franklin was a practical person. Thomas Jefferson was a very practical person.\n\nWhat do you think is the most practical skill you have that’s helped you in life?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I think it’s being able to relate to other people and encourage other people to do more than they think they can do. To show them through some kind of breadcrumbs that I know you didn’t think that you could do this, but you actually can do it if you do this breadcrumb, that breadcrumb, these five breadcrumbs, you’ll get to your goal.\n\nAnd people were like, “Whoa, I never thought of it that way.” So it’s encouraging. I define myself as CEO standing not for “chief executive officer.” I define it as “chief encouragement officer.” And what I enjoy doing most in my company is just walking around the laboratories and the hallways and talking to people and encouraging them to their next step. I think that’s what I’m best at.\n\nI’m not a molecular biologist, I’m not a pharmacologist. I did understand the type of medicine that we needed to make. I wasn’t going to be the person in the laboratory with the white coat and the pipette and the test tube. But I was able to find all of those chemists and show them that this is a molecule you could make. These are the steps on how you would make it.\n\nMaybe a really good analogy, to me, is I’m a conductor. A conductor’s job is to make sure that every musician in the orchestra does the best that they can do and shows them that they can all play a symphony together that probably none of them thought they could do. And the conductor gets them all to work together by knowing each person’s part. When you look at a conductor’s score for music, it’s got the strings, the horns, the trumpets. It’s got everybody’s stanza on there. So I’m kind of a conductor and a composer of practical technologies.\n\nSo for those listening out there, what would you tell them if you met them at a concert, or walking down the street?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Go to all the concerts you can go to. Talk to different kinds of people. Diversity is the water of hope.\n\nYou make these musical analogies. Do you think music is a particularly apt metaphor, or is especially conducive to creativity?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I think that music is — in the truest sense of music, which begins with rhythm and begins with vibration, begins with your heartbeat — I think that music is necessary, if not sufficient, for life.\n\nWhat kind of music do you particularly like to play?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I like to play jazz. I like to play blues. But I also play popular songs. I like to play songs like “Fly Me to the Moon.” You know, just little popular things. I play some classical music. I like to play Chopin preludes.\n\nDo you have a favorite song?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I love this song, it’s another popular song called “Impossible Dream.” It was a theme song from Man of La Mancha, I think. So I can play that. I play flute, I like improvising, I like doing jazz improvisation on flute. Right now I’m practicing a song called “Color My World” by Chicago because the head of clinical development at United Therapeutics, Lee Peterson, she’s a totally amazing rock and roll drummer. She’s got two bands in the Raleigh-Durham area and so for our Christmas parties, her band plays at our Christmas parties and we dance and enjoy it. They insist that I come up and play one song with them which… I don’t want to be like that CEO that’s pushing himself on the band. But originally, I agreed to do the cowbell. So I played cowbell with them on one song. This year we’re doing “Color My World” as one of those songs, so I’m going to play the flute part, which comes in in the third section of that song.\n\nYou’ve spoken about eliminating physical pain from our lives. What about emotional pain? Will we ever eliminate that?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: One of the points I made in my book, Virtually Human, is that I believe the two most important professions in the future — and some people don’t like to hear this, but I have to say my truth — are psychologists and lawyers.\n\nWhy?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Because our minds are extraordinarily complex, and as we create cyber-conscious twins of ourselves, we’re only going to become more complex. Basically, a cyber-conscious twin of yourself is essentially what it says. You’re going to have two minds to manage, and a lot of us can barely manage our one mind. We’re going to need professional help.\n\nWhat do you mean, having two minds? How can we do that?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: By uploading your personality, recollections, feelings, mannerisms, beliefs, attitudes and values digitally, and coupling that with software that can figure out the way you respond to the world but do that all digitally. There will be a second one of you that is operating outside of your flesh body.\n\nSo in the future the two most important professions are going to be psychologists and lawyers. Psychologists, because as we have more and more things that we need to grapple with, with our minds, it’s going to be hard to sort through it and it would only be natural that we need expert guides to help us sort through the emotional pain that we have from relationships, from career choices, from life choices.\n\nThe one thing that’s continued to increase in our lives are choices. And it’s hard to make those choices. It’s good to have an expert guide to help you. And that’s what — whether you want to call them therapists or psychologists or psychiatrists — that’s what they do. As we begin digitally uploading our mind and having digital twins, or what we call cyber-conscious versions of ourselves, the choices and the options are going to become even more complicated.\n\nAlso, the benefits will grow as well. But it never stopped people, people always were willing to accept the problems that went along with the benefits. We like cars, but we have tens of thousands of people that die every year in car accidents. We accept that we like cars. We’re going to have a lot of emotional pain by having a digital twin. But we’ll accept that for the benefits of being able to process twice as much reality as we can do when we’re just one mind doing it.\n\nSo we’re going to be able to take our minds, put our contents into a computer with artificial intelligence?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Yes. You will be able to, I’ll give you an example. You’ll be able to do, say, three interviews at the same time of different people. It’ll be great content from all three of the interviews. Each of the, say two, digital twins of yourself will brief you, will give you the Cliff’s Notes version, will brief all three of you with the Cliff’s Notes version of how the interview went. You can stream it, you can watch it. You may be a little bit slower, your digital twins a little bit faster. So your mind will literally expand.\n\nBut there’s only going to be one human body, so they’re not face to face with someone they’re interviewing.\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Well, face to face on a screen and then with a hologram. And then, I don’t know if you’ve seen the BINA48 robot that we’ve built. So they’ll be physically instantiated sooner than you think.\n\nAnd the benefits will be great, even if it’s more stressful?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: You’ll be able to live two lives in the time of one, and that will cause stresses that also cause benefit. And the psychologists are there to help you with the stress. The other thing is more people, more options, more social collisions. And that’s the job of lawyers. A lot of people like to knock down lawyers, but they forget that before there were lawyers, things were settled with swords and arrows. Lawyers are there to prevent us settling things with swords and arrows.\n\nHow soon are we going to need all these lawyers and psychologists?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: This century. Things are moving very fast, as Ray Kurzweil says, because of the exponential growth in information technology. This century will be equivalent in linear time to a thousand years. So if I was to say something would take 300 years to happen, it’s going to happen in 30 real years.\n\nLet’s take up a different topic that also speaks to so much about you. What is the biggest misconception people have about a transgender person?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Well, it’s impossible for me to answer that question, because I’m only one transgendered person. And every transgender person is different, you know? So I really can’t speak for everybody else.\n\nI could say for me, it’s the conception that I don’t want to be one sex and I only want to be the other gender, okay? So it’s the “either or” conception. In fact, I don’t really like the boundary of “male or female.” I enjoy transcending that boundary. I have male energy. I have female energy. Intellectually, the tribe that I would claim for myself is the female tribe. I think it’s probably more because I’m just in absolute awe, more in awe of women than I am of men.\n\nIt would be like picking a sports team that you like better. When I think, as I said in my remarks, the incredible burden that women have, I think women have carried civilization on their backs. I cannot wrap my head at all around misogyny or racism, these kinds of artificial reasons to be against a demographic or characteristic. It’s completely… it eats at me. I don’t understand it. And why somebody would tell somebody else what to do with their own body? I don’t get it. So I identify with women, but it doesn’t mean that my gender is just female or just male. My gender is Martine and I’m very happy just being an individualistic gender.\n\nI wrote this book titled The Apartheid of Sex back in the ‘90s. And while a lot of people now, they don’t really know what the word apartheid means, but it meant the artificial division of everybody in South Africa into being either black or white. And you had separate legal rules that went with you if you were black or white. To me, it’s just as artificial to divide all people into saying, “You’re either male or female. If you’re male, you’ve got certain rights.” If you’ve got like, “Female, you can be paid less,” and blah, blah, blah. So I don’t like artificial borders like that. It runs against my own personal spirit.\n\nSo to summarize, the biggest misconception about transgendered people is that all transgender people want to run away from their old gender and go to a new one. That is true for many people, okay, but it’s not true for everybody. One of the things I’m super, super happy about with the millennial generation is I see so many people coming out as gender non-binary, which is in Apartheid of Sex. That’s why I call it the apartheid, like in that book, I said there really is not just two separate genders, there’s a million different genders.\n\nNow I’ve got friends of mine saying, “Oh my God, I didn’t know what to do, my daughter is saying that she doesn’t want to be a girl and she doesn’t want to be a boy. And so what? I say love the person as they are. Love the person as they are. Why are you… it’s their life. You know, you’ve got your life. Why are you trying to impose like a particular gender on — whether it’s your son or your daughter — your offspring?\n\nThey usually say things similar to what people said to me being in an interracial marriage. They say, “Oh well, they’re going to have a tough time in society,” and “You know, your kids are going to be not black or not white.” Our spirit is stronger than other people’s oppression. Our spirit is stronger than other people’s prejudice. People would rather face social difficulties and overcome them than live their entire life in a mental prison.\n\nDo you think your sexuality has helped you think differently than other people?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Probably. If you ask me, what’s my favorite word? I mean, nobody ever asked me this. I’m just asking myself that right now. I would probably say “transcendental.” I just love transcending things. In fact, on Twitter I describe myself as “I’m a transcender, not transgender.”\n\nWhat do you mean? What are you transcending?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: I’m transcending the border of my body to connect with a greater creator collectivity. I’m transcending white or black to just be a person. I’m transcending flesh to be a consciousness. I’m transcending Earth to be part of the galaxy. I’m transcending limitations to be unlimited.\n\nAnd when people call you an inventor, a visionary, a mom, one of the greatest business minds in the United States, what do you call yourself?\n\nMartine Rothblatt: Martine.\n\nWell, thank you.\n\nMartine Rothblatt: My pleasure. Thanks for talking with me."
