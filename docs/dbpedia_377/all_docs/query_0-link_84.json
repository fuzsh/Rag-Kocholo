(Craig Baldwin, 1995, 98 minutes)\n\nSpectres of the Spectrum\n\nCraig Baldwin in person\n\nApril 22, 4:00 p.m.\n\nUtilizing old kinescopes (filmed records of early TV broadcasts, before the advent of videotape) Baldwin creates an eerie, haunted \"media-archaeology\" zone for a sci-fi time-travel tale. (Craig Baldwin, 1999, 94 minutes)\n\nSwimming in Nebraska\n\nApril 28, 1:00\n\nJon Jost describes his Swimming in Nebraska as \"an essay-documentary of what I suppose most would call an experimental kind. It is meant as an oblique critique of the kind of provincialism in which New Yorkers or Parisians or Angelinos say things like, 'Nebraska, there's nothing there' or refer to the American Midwest as 'fly-over country.'\" (Jon Jost, 2010, 74 minutes)\n\nAmerican Dreams (lost and found)\n\nJames Benning in person\n\nApril 28, 3:00 p.m.\n\nAmerican Dreams (lost and found) is James Benning's personal take on the history of the United States from 1954 to 1976 (mainly the years of his own youth), told through a complex and thought-provoking amalgamation of image, text, and sound.

(Total running time approximately 120 minutes)\n\nErnie Gehr: Recent Work\n\nMay 5–6\n\nVeteran filmmaker Ernie Gehr returns to the Gallery to discuss his most recent work. Gehr's richly negotiated pieces meld and offset concrete soundscapes with sometimes barely perceptible slivers of place. These collisions between identifiable spaces and conceptual realms activate forms that are unique to Gehr's practice and career, now spanning over five decades.\n\nTransport and Other Shorts (2016–2017)\n\nErnie Gehr in person\n\nMay 5, 4:30 p.m.\n\nFeaturing recently completed titles including Autumn, a multilayered observation of New York's Lower East Side, its inhabitants, and permutations; A Commuter's Life (What a Life!), developed from manipulated recordings made during the artist's regular train travel between New York and Boston; and Transport, a stirring first-person meditation through a train museum in Germany, among other titles. (Total running time 75 minutes)\n\nNew Work: A Talk by Ernie Gehr\n\nErnie Gehr in person\n\nMay 6, 4:00 p.m.\n\nGehr discusses his work and presents excerpts from several new digital films, including Cotton Candy, Glider, Greene Street, Waterfront Follies, and Brooklyn Series. (Approximately 70 minutes)\n\nParis, May '68: Zanzibar and Philippe Garrel\n\nMay 12–27\n\nDuring the volatile late 1960s in Paris, the filmmaking collective known as Zanzibar began creating outsider underground movies, many of which are now lost or neglected. The group (consisting of Philippe Garrel, Jackie Raynal, Serge Bard, Daniel Pommereulle, Olivier Mosset, Frédéric Pardo, Patrick Deval, Caroline de Bendern, Zouzou, and one or two others) resembled a clique of Warhol Factoryesque characters—artists, writers, actors, and models, a few of whom had actually worked at the Factory. Special thanks to Sally Shafto, Jacob Perlin, Jackie Raynal, and Patrick Deval for their assistance.\n\nDétruisez-vous\n\nIntroduction by Sally Shafto\n\nMay 12, 2:30 p.m.\n\nThe first of the Zanzibar productions, shot between March and April 1968, borrows a title from a phrase scrawled on the walls of the University of Paris's Nanterre campus: Aideznous, détruisez-vous (Help us, destroy yourselves). Foreshadowing the growing spirit of revolt, Bard cast in this early film the artist and activist Alain Jouffroy who plays a professor lecturing to a nearly empty classroom on the necessity of revolution. (Serge Bard, 1968, subtitles, 75 minutes)\n\nLe Révélateur preceded by Les enfants désaccordés\n\nIntroduction by Sally Shafto\n\nMay 12, 4:30 p.m.\n\nSilent and dreamlike, Le Révélateur—in which a couple wanders the landscape with their young child and are menaced by some unknown force—was filmed in the Black Forest by cinematographer Michel Fournier. (Philippe Garrel, 1968, subtitles, 67 minutes) Garrel's Les enfants désaccordés follow the story of two teenagers who run away from home and inhabit a mansion on the edge of town where they act out problems from their respective families. (Philippe Garrel, 1964, subtitles, 15 minutes)\n\nLes amants réguliers preceded by Actua 1\n\nMay 19, 2:30 p.m.\n\nA participant observer in the events of May '68, Philippe Garrel used his son Louis as his leading actor and the classically trained Parisian cinematographer William Lubtchansky to shoot this poetic evocation of the era. (Philippe Garrel, 2005, 35mm, subtitles, 178 minutes) Actua 1, Garrel's short real-time documentation of May 1968, precedes the feature. (Philippe Garrel, 1968, 16mm, 8 minutes)\n\nLa cicatrice intérieure (The Inner Scar)\n\nMay 20, 4:30 p.m.\n\nPhilippe Garrel shot The Inner Scar with Warhol superstar Nico, his then partner and co-scriptwriter. As the actress wanders through a desert, she comes upon a man (Garrel) who leads her hither and yon, then disappears.

(Philippe Garrel, 1972, 60 minutes)\n\nLe Lit de la Vierge followed by On the Set of Le Lit de la Vierge\n\nMay 26, 2:00 p.m.\n\nPierre Clémenti plays a modern Christ figure who is reluctant to assume his earthly mission. (Philippe Garrel, 1969, 35mm, subtitles, 95 minutes) On the Set of Le Lit de la Vierge goes behind the scenes with a few of the actors in the film—Pierre-Richard Bré, Jean-Pierre Kalfon, Babette Lamy, and the iconic Tina Aumont. (Frédéric Pardo, 1968, 16mm, silent, 30 minutes)\n\nAcéphale\n\nMay 26, 4:30 p.m.\n\nWith its title from Georges Bataille's journal Acéphale, Deval's film follows the adventures of a young man and his friends as they wander through a barely recognizable post–May 1968 Paris. (Patrick Deval, 1968, 35mm, subtitles, 65 minutes) Special thanks to Centre Georges Pompidou for loan of their 35mm print.\n\nDeux fois\n\nMay 27, 4:00 p.m.\n\nDeux fois,shot during a week in 1968 in Barcelona, is a sequence of disconnected but riveting episodes that gained fame as a breakthrough work of feminist cinema. (Jackie Raynal, 1968, subtitles, 70 minutes)\n\nVite followed by The Revolution Is Only a Beginning: Let's Continue\n\nMay 27, 5:30 p.m.\n\nArtist Daniel Pommereulle's Vite, though only a half-hour in length, was one of the most expensive of the Zanzibar films, featuring shots of the moon through a Questar telescope. (Daniel Pommereulle, 1969, subtitles, 37 minutes) Famed French actor Pierre Clémenti made several underground films, including the madcap The Revolution Is Only a Beginning: Let's Continue—his declaration of eternal revolt and poetry in the streets. (Pierre Clémenti, 1968, silent, 16mm, 25 minutes)\n\nFrom Vault to Screen: Finland\n\nJune 10–24\n\nFocuses on the holdings of Finland's National Audiovisual Institute (KAVI) and the Finnish Film Foundation in Helsinki, this series coincides with the commemoration of 100 years of Finnish independence. Special thanks to Antti Alanen, Tommi Partanen, Jenni Domingo, Annina Aalto, KAVI, the Finnish Film Foundation, and the Embassy of Finland.\n\nThe Unknown Soldier\n\nJune 10, 4:00 p.m.\n\nAs the chords of Finlandia reverberate on the soundtrack, members of a machine-gun troop emerge from the woodlands to join the national Continuation War counterattack on the Soviets after the Winter War standoff. A true national epic, and one of the world's great war sagas, the film was based on Väinö Linna's eponymous novel. (Edvin Laine, 1955, subtitles, 169 minutes)\n\nPeople of the Summer Night\n\nJune 16, 1:00 p.m.\n\nBased on Frans Eemil Sillanpää's 1934 novel (Ihmiset suviyössä), the narrative—told from varying viewpoints—focuses on the fates of several people during two long summer nights as they carouse, fall in love, fight, give birth, or die. (Valentin Vaala, 1948, subtitles, 66 minutes)\n\nLoviisa (Louisa)\n\nJune 23, 2:00 p.m.\n\nConsidered the best adaptation from the Niskavuori play cycle by noted Estonian-Finnish writer Hella Wuolijoki, Loviisa is a tale of love between young Juhani Niskavuori and a local dairy worker named Malviina as well as of the family's frustration triggered by their affair. (Valentin Vaala, 1946, subtitles, 85 minutes)\n\nCiné-Concert: Anna-Liisa\n\nAndrew Simpson, pianist\n\nJune 23, 4:00 p.m.\n\nAnna-Liisa is an adaptation of the acclaimed 19th-century play by Minna Canth, a writer whose work focused on interesting female characters. The film's carefully reconstructed sets and open-air cinematography (underscored by this new digital restoration) draw attention to the unspoiled landscapes and the lives of local workers. (Teuvo Puro and Jussi Snellman, 1922, subtitles, 88 minutes)"
