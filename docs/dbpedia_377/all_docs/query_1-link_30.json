Are these problems related? Could it be that the underlying difficulty lies in the essential use that the concept of infinity plays in the continuum Hilbert (Foch) state spaces of quantum (field) theory. Here I describe a particular discretisation of Hilbert Space (generating what I call Rational Quantum Mechanics - RaQM) and show, using elementary results from number theory, it accounts for the Uncertainty Principle, wave-particle duality and quantum non-commutativity, whilst at the same time allowing (something impossible in quantum mechanics) a finite deterministic ensemble-based underpinning of the wavefunction in which Born’s rule is automatically satisfied. In this model quantum mechanics is a singular limit of RaQM as the discretisation goes to zero. The violation of counterfactual definiteness in discrete RaQM implies it is not Bell-nonlocal, determinism notwithstanding.\n\nPalmer, T.N., Superdeterminism without Conspiracy.

As an example, after the demonstration of the first atom interferometers, scientists were able to put tighter bounds on the so-called “alpha-dot” parameter using atom interferometers. Nowadays, technology has matured to the point where these devices can be used in more applied settings, such as providing acceleration and rotation measurements to aid in navigation in GPS-denied environments. In this talk, I will first discuss the physics underlying an atom interferometer, beginning with the use of light pulses [1] to form the atom optics. Next, I will highlight the origins of the scaling of the sensitivity of an atom interferometer to T2, where T is the time between light pulses. I will take a brief excursion to describe an atom interferometer we are currently developing which is focused on inertial navigation applications. Most of the talk will focus on my group’s efforts to develop a novel atom interferometer with high scaling (T3) [2] [3]. The higher scaling leads to a greater sensitivity without increasing the physical size of the atom interferometer. Finally, I will describe a project currently under construction at NPS to build a 30-meter-tall atom fountain. I will motivate the project and our vision for making the apparatus available as a user facility. I will then describe, somewhat humorously, the planned first experiment to use the device to measure the period of a Foucault pendulum. Finally, I will describe the status of the construction of the apparatus.\n\nMonday, April 15th @ 2:00pm PST in KC 149 or Join us on Zoom!\n\nAbstract: In quantum mechanics, the wavefunction serves as a mathematical expression that characterises the quantum state of a system. Nonetheless, a debate persists regarding whether the wavefunction encompasses all necessary features or whether there exists a requirement for hidden variables, either local or non-local. Photons, particles of light, and electrons, particles of charge, can possess wavefunctions labelled by various quantum numbers, such as frequency and energy, polarisation and spin, and spatial and temporal modes. The ability to generate, manipulate, and detect a quantum wavefunction with specific states is essential in quantum information processing. For example, it is crucial to accurately generate and detect photon states when performing secret key sharing via quantum key distribution or complex computations, or electron states when using them to detect objects in a quantum imaging/sensing setup. These fields of research can be categorised as the study of structured waves.\n\nIn my talk, I will provide an overview of how to engineer the quantum states of photons and electrons and show examples of how structured waves can help us understand fundamental questions in science. I will also briefly discuss their applications in quantum key distribution, quantum simulators, and quantum microscopy.\n\nWednesday, April 3rd @ 10:00am in KC 149 or Join us on Zoom!\n\nAbstract: A key question in the thermodynamics of open quantum systems is how to partition thermodynamic quantities such as entropy, work, and internal energy between the system and its environment. We show that the only partition under which entropy is non-singular is based on a partition of Hilbert-space, which assigns half the system-environment coupling to the system and half to the environment. However, quantum work partitions non-trivially under Hilbert-space partition, and we derive a Work Sum Rule that accounts for quantum work at a distance. All state functions of the system are shown to be path independent once this nonlocal quantum work is properly accounted for. The thermodynamics of two classes of quasi-statically driven open quantum systems is analyzed: systems with a finite environment in the grand canonical ensemble, and systems with an unbounded environment. Our results are illustrated with applications to a time-dependent two-level system and the driven resonant-level model.\n\nWednesday, March 27th @ 10:00am in KC 149 or Join us on Zoom!\n\nAbstract: The energy absorbed by a conductor from a non-equilibrium environment can be rectified to generate finite electrical power. Typically, this depends on tiny energy-dependent asymmetries of the device, formed by e.g. a quantum dot [1]. We show that larger currents are expected in hybrid systems, where a superconductor hybridizes the even-parity states in the quantum dot [2]. We consider the environment to consist on a quantum dot Coulomb-coupled to the conductor and tunnel-coupled to a hot reservoir. Two main mechanisms contribute to the generation of power. On one hand, the non-equilibrium charge fluctuations in the second dot correlate with the Andreev processes, hence injecting Cooper pairs in the superconductor. This provides the necessary symmetry breaking energy transfer. On the other hand, this mechanism competes with quasiparticle contributions, which benefit from the sharp features of the superconducting density of states, and is able to increase the engine performance [3].\n\n[1] H.

This second quantum revolution grew, however, out of 60+ earlier years of research into deep, foundational questions, which for most of that time were seen by the mainstream as distractions from the real day-to-day business of physics. If not for the workers who followed those distractions, we would not be where we are today. In the excitement and the hype, it would be easy to imagine that the deep questions have been resolved and there remains nothing more than engineering, but this could not be further from the truth. My group’s research agenda focuses on identifying the open questions lying in plain sight at the heart of quantum physics. We have done this mostly by studying the problem of “quantum measurement” – what are the limits on the information one can extract about a quantum system, and the best ways to extract it? What are the side-effects – good or bad – of observation on a system? What can present observation teach us about the past, in a quantum world? I will give an overview of three example projects we have underway.\n\nIn one, we see that although quantum tunneling occurs in myriad systems and has been known since 1926, there are still mysteries about how a particle gets from one side to another of a barrier, and operational ways to address them in the lab; we will also see that these experiments open the door to questions we never before thought to ask.\n\nIn a second, we discovered that there are surprises to be found even in the venerable question of how light slows down as it propagates through matter, and “where the photons spend their time.” This is directly relevant to modern quantum technologies including logic gates and quantum memories.\n\nFinally, in our most speculative direction, I will present a first experiment on what happens when the observer him/herself is a quantum rather than a classical being. Aside from the potential implications to whether or not the functioning of the human brain is in any important way quantum, this raises questions that will be central if and when AI (potentially quantum AI) reaches the stage of running automated experiments without human intervention.\n\nWednesday, March 13th @ 10:00am PST in KC 149 or Join us on Zoom!\n\nAbstract: In 1927, Madelung was the first to interpret the Schrodinger equation as describing the flow of a conserved (probability) fluid, and the mathematical formalism he developed was the foundation for Bohm's interpretation of quantum mechanics, although it was no longer a fluid picture, and the physics occurs in a high-dimensional configuration space, rather than in 3-space. The recent development of the local many worlds interpretation allows all of the physics to be put back into Minkowski space, where everything can be understood in a nearly classical fluid picture, with many noninteracting fluids occupying the same space. During a local interaction between different quantum systems, the different fluids of each system may be mixed (interference), matched, or divided up into more non-interacting branches, and the local interaction potential acts as a boundary condition between the pre-interaction fluids and the post-interaction fluids. The Born rule describes a frequentist probability that follows directly from the proportion of fluid assigned to each outcome of a measurement. The purpose of this talk is to focus on the fluid mechanics in 3-space, starting with the single-particle Schrodinger equation. Momentum and energy densities are derived for the fluid and interpreted. For each fluid, there is an unusual imaginary term in the momentum density, which is unrelated to the bulk flow, and so is interpreted as a distribution of fluid particle momenta whose vector sum is zero at each event in spacetime, called symmetric momentum. Related to that is an unusual energy density term, which comes from the quantum kinetic energy, but is interpreted as a new kind of internal potential energy carried by the fluid, called the quantum potential. With this interpretation, the average flow of the fluid looks almost entirely classical, and the new type of energy naturally explains situations where fluid is in a classically forbidden region, like quantum tunneling. We examine the local exchanges of energy between the different types as the fluid moves, and conclude that in order for energy to be locally conserved, the quantum potential energy must flow between particles in the fluid, rather than only being carried by them (somewhat like heat flowing through a rod). Finally, there is an alternative version of this picture which comes from separating the quantum potential into a symmetric kinetic energy and a reduced quantum potential, which may provide a more physical explanation of the kinetic energy in energy eigenstates. The two picture offer different insights. The mathematical formalism of the fluid pictures will be presented, and time permitting, I will discuss relativistic generalizations, and the ubiquitous role of superoscillations.\n\nWednesday, February 28th @ 10am PST in KC 149 or Join us on Zoom!\n\nAbstract: Feynman said that quantum interference experiments contain the “only mystery” of quantum mechanics. Contra Feynman, in [1], we showed that those aspects of quantum Mach-Zehnder interferometry that are Traditionally Regarded As Problematic (TRAP), such as the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb tester and the quantum eraser, can be accounted for by a classical model. This opens the question of whether there are other aspects that are ``genuinely nonclassical’’. Adopting Spekkens noncontextuality as our definition of ``classical’’, we show that the uncertainty tradeoff for qubit observables can only occur in a contextual model [2], and we apply this to show the same for Greenberger-Yasin wave-particle duality relation for a Mach-Zehnder interferometer [3]. Finally, we show that the quantum Zeno effect, in the form required for asymptotically perfect interaction free measurement, also requires contextuality. We conclude that quantum interference effects do illustrate one of the fundamental mysteries of quantum mechanics, but not in the way that Feynman envisaged.\n\n[1] Lorenzo Catani, Matthew Leifer, David Schmid, and Robert W.

Owing to its importance in gyroscopes and gravitational wave detection as well as its fundamental nature in all branches of interferometry, phase estimation beyond the standard quantum limit has been the prototypical example [1–3]. Pragmatically, due to loss, quantum phase estimation techniques have, so far, only offered a few percent improvement over the standard quantum limit in the few-photon regime [4] or a few dB improvement in the high power regime [5]. However, what if phase estimation for a class of experiments is suboptimal? Depending on the measurement apparatus, phase estimation may have different fundamental limits than frequency estimation [6]. I will discuss a new type of gyroscope that relies on an ultra-steep, frequency-dependent gain measurement rather than performing phase estimation in a passive gyroscope. With this technique we can achieve orders of magnitude improvement below the phase estimation standard quantum limit of a single-loop Sagnac interferometer of the same size. I will discuss important insights into a long-debated open question about the role of Doppler shifts in the Sagnac effect.\n\nWednesday, October 11th @ 10:00am in KC 149 or Join us on Zoom!\n\nAbstract: I will discuss perspectives on some key problems in quantum gravity using recent results from a pilot-wave based approach to the Ashtekar formulation of the Wheeler-de Witt equation (based on joint work with Justin Dressel and Stephon Alexander). I will first illustrate several key ideas using pilot-wave account of a holomorphic representation of quantum harmonic oscillator, and then apply these to the interacting fermionic-gravitational system in (Phys. Rev. D 106.10 (2022): 106012). I will show how the notion of a definite configuration in pilot-wave allows us to define a real global time variable and render the total Hamiltonian constraint to the form of a Schrodinger equation without semiclassical approximations. I will then discuss the guidance equation and the reality conditions for the Ashtekar connection in our approach. Lastly, I will generalize the notion of unitarity to non-normalizable states from pilot-wave perspective, and show the existence of unitary states in minisuperspace.\n\nWednesday, October 4th @ 10:00am PST in KC 149 or Join us on Zoom!Â\n\nÂ\n\nAbstract:Â A bandlimited function is said to be superoscillatory when it locally oscillates at a rate higher than its fastest Fourier component. Superoscillatory optical fields are routinely used for far-field superresolution imaging, i.e., for achieving resolution beyond the Rayleigh limit. The presence of very intense sidelobes limits the effectiveness of such fields in experimental implementations. The appearance of these sidelobes leads to poor imaging quality and unrealistic constraints on the dynamic ranges of the detectors. Supergrowth, a recently introduced concept [Jordan, Quantum Stud.: Math. Found.Â 7, 285-292(2020)], is a promising candidate for mitigating such issues. Supergrowth is defined as the local amplitude growth rate of a function being higher than its fastest Fourier component. In my talk, I will show how supergrowing and superoscillating optical fields can help us reconstruct subwavelength objects. We will also see that supergrowing regions can have intensities exponentially higher than superoscillating regions, alleviating the effects of sidelobes. In the second part of the talk, I will show how to generate supergrowing/superoscillating functions robustly. In the final part, I will describe the first-ever experimental synthesis of supergrowing fields.\n\nWednesday, September 27th @ 10:00am in KC 149 or Join us on Zoom!\n\nÂ\n\nAbstract:Â I will show how to time-optimally drive a quantum state along arbitrary trajectories under energy constraints and identify which trajectories are achievable under such constraints. This is equivalent to solving the SchrÃ¶dinger equation's inverse problem, i.e., given a solution of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, determining the Hamiltonian that generates such a solution. Next, I will demonstrate how solving the SchrÃ¶dinger equation's inverse problem allows us to describe the wave function collapse process via a stochastic, time- and state-dependent Hamiltonian. On the other hand, generalizing these quantum state driving techniques in the non-unitary regime yields a probabilistic unitary formulation of open quantum system dynamics. This new formulation of open quantum system dynamics provides us with a simple, intuitive, and unified framework for describing open quantum system dynamics exactly under all regimes, whether Markovian or non-Markovian. Alongside the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, it reveals that all quantum processes, whether open or closed, continuous or discontinuous, finite or infinite-dimensional, can be categorized as either unitary or probabilistic unitary, i.e., probabilistic combinations of unitary evolutions.\n\nWednesday, September 13th @ 10:00am in KC 149 or Join us on Zoom!Â\n\nÂ\n\nAbstract:Â There has been a proliferation of different interpretations of quantum mechanics, some of which are vague, incomplete, or internally inconsistent. Â There is also a group of operational theories based only on regularities in empirical data (laws), which explicitly avoid specifying any ontology, and yet their proponents make claims about them, like nonlocality or superdeterminism, that can only be true or false given an ontology, which is a fundamental logic error. Â We present theÂ generative programs frameworkÂ (GPF), which encompasses any and all physical theories that explain the empirical data for a given scenario or model, as a standard for describing physical theories, whether ontological or operational, which prevents ambiguity, incompleteness, and inconsistency. Â AÂ generative programÂ is a set of instructions that starts from nothing and generates all of the relevant empirical data. Â The instructions are executed in a logical order independent of space and time, and may include the creation of intermediate entities, like functions and their inputs, which participate in the generation of the data. Â An operationalist will interpret such a program as a useful summary of the data and some regular laws that it obeys, but will ascribe it no ontological significance. Â A realist will interpret a program as describing true ontological machinery that creates the empirical data, such that what is `physical' is defined as what appears in the instructions of the program, rendering all other facts about the data incidental. Â Yes/no questions about ontology like, \"is this theory local?\", or \"is this theory superdeterministic?\" can only be answered for programs which are considered to be ontologically real, since these are questions about the physical machinery of the ontology. Â Laws that appear in empirical data describe correlations, from which causality can never be inferred, meaning that the existence of causality is another yes/no question about an ontological program, and causality is thus independent of realism. Â The information flow in a generative program can be represented as a directed-acyclic graph (DAG) ofÂ ontological priorityÂ describing the logical order in which entities are generated in the process of the generation of the empirical data. Â Parts of the ontological priority DAG may also represent causality for an ontologically real program, but this is not required. Â The GPF is a unifying framework for evaluating and comparing physical theories, in that, a) no physical theory can be taken seriously unless its program can be specified, and b) given the programs for various theories, we can rigorously analyze their ontological properties and then apply our many subjective heuristics (locality is good, superdeterminism is bad, fine-tuning is bad, causality is good, Occam's razor, identity of indiscernibles, etc.) to argue why one should be preferred over another.\n\nWednesday, April 19th @ 10:00am in KC 149 or Join us on Zoom\n\nÂ\n\nAbstract:Â Any N-qubit quantum state can be built from modular 1- and 2-qubit gates, and (for large N) a full description of such a quantum circuit is usually far simpler than the information encoded in the resulting state (formally requiring the specification of 2^N complex numbers). This motivates a hidden-variable approach to quantum circuits, where the actual state space grows only linearly with the number of qubits, while the specification of those hidden variables requires an all-at-once analysis of the connections in the full quantum circuit. In order to eliminate the traditional 2^N-sized mathematical structures, the necessary price is hidden retrocausality, because altering a future gate will alter the full circuit geometry, thereby corresponding to different hidden variables throughout the circuit. On the positive side, such a model would be comprised of localizable single-qubit states which only interact where they are physically brought together, rescuing our traditional notions of locality and reality. The mathematical formalism and preliminary successes of such a framework will be presented here for the first time.\n\nWednesday, April 5th @ 10:00am in KC 149 or join us on ZoomÂ\n\nÂ\n\nAbstract:Â By the quantum-classical correspondence of light propagation, the optical implementation of the weak measurement inside quantum measurement can be considered in the linear optics regime. By the usage of the specific initial probe state, the weak value can be extracted as the two-dimensional image. This is called a weak-value imaging. By the combination of the post-selection, the quantum state tomography of the polarized state is demonstrated. Then, in the case of the entangled polarized state, this weak-value imaging technique can be extended. In this talk, we propose two methods on quantum state tomography of the entangled polarized state. One is that the joint weak value consists of the product of the weak value with the different post selection. The other is to utilize the deep learning technique with the weak value to estimate the concurrence of the target state.\n\nÂ\n\nWednesday, 9 November 2022\n\nAbstract:Â Superconducting materials are known to be good thermal insulators at sufficiently low temperatures thanks to the presence of the energy gap in their density of states (DOS). Yet, the proximity effect allows to tune the local DOS of a metallic wire by controlling the phase biasing imposed across it. As a result, the wire thermal resistance can be largely tuned by phase manipulation. In this talk I will show the experimental implementation of efficient control of thermal current by phase tuning the superconducting proximity effect. This is achieved by using the magnetic flux driven modulation of the DOS of a quasi one-dimensional aluminum nanowire forming a weak-link embedded in a superconducting loop [1]. Moreover, phase-slip events occurring in the nanowire are able to induce a hysteretic dependence of its local DOS on the direction of the applied magnetic field. Thus, we also demonstrate the operation of the nanovalve as a phase-tunable thermal memory [1, 2], thereby encoding information in the local temperature of a metallic electrode nearby connected. Besides quantum physics, our results are relevant for the design of innovative phase-coherent caloritronics devices such as thermal valves and temperature amplifiers, which are promising nanostructures for the realization of heat logic architectures.\n\nÂ\n\nTuesday, 1 November 2022Â\n\nAbstract:Â Owing to their wave-like nature, quantum systems can never be truly at rest. Indeed, the value of some observablesâthose which do not commute with the Hamiltonianâfluctuate, even when the system is in its ground state. Following major advances in the manipulation and control of quantum systems, the prospect of extracting useful work out of these ubiquitous fluctuations becomes increasingly tangible.\n\n\"In this talk, I will present a new design for a quantum engine where local measurements on a many-body system are used to extract work from the ground state fluctuations of local observables. Indeed, performing local energy measurements on a system whose ground state is entangled can reveal excited states from which work can be extracted via local feedback operations. The engine is powered by the energy gap between the local ground state and the entangled many-body ground state. This quantum resource is essentially âfreeâ in the setup at stake as it can simply be generated by coupling the interacting many-body system to a cold reservoir.\n\nI will illustrate this proposal with two different systems: a chain of coupled qubits and a network of coupled harmonic oscillators. These models respectively correspond to fermionic and bosonic excitations.\"\n\nWednesday, 14 September 2022 @ 10 AM in 149 Keck Center, or join us on Zoom.\n\nAbstract: WeÂ will discuss the thermodynamic aspects of a single qubit-based and coupled qubit-based devices, powered by weak quantum measurements, and feedback controlled by a quantum Maxwell's demon. Single qubit-based device: We will discuss both discrete and time-continuous operation of the measurement-based device at finite temperature of the reservoir. In the discrete example where a demon acquires information via discrete weak measurements, we will show that the thermodynamic variables including the heat exchanged, extractable work, and the entropy produced are completely determined by an information theoretic measure of the demon's perceived arrow of time. In the time-continuous limit, we will present the exact finite-time statistics of work, heat and entropy changes along individual quantum trajectories of the quantum measurement process and relate them to the demon's arrow of time. Coupled qubit-based devices: we will study the discrete case for the coupled qubit-based system and study the relation between thermodynamic quantities and the arrow of time. We will also present the case for obtaining feedback based quantum thermal machines when the reservoirs are not detachable. Finally, we will give a brief outline for future directions we are pursuing.\n\nWednesday, 27 July 2022 @ 12 PM in 149 Keck Center, or join us on Zoom.\n\nAbstract: Several tasks in quantum-information processing involve quantum learning. For example, quantum sensing, quantum machine learning and quantum-computer calibration involve learning and estimating unknown parameters from measurements of many copies of a quantum state that depends on those parameters. This type of metrological information is described by the quantum Fisher information matrix, which bounds the average amount of information learnt about the parameters per measurement of the state. In this talk, I will show that the quantum Fisher information aboutÂ parameters encoded in N copies of the state can be compressed into M copies of a related state, where M << N. I will show that Â M/NÂ can be made arbitrarily small, and that the compression can happen without loss of information.Â The resource behindÂ this compression ability is non-classical entries in the Kirkwood-DiracÂ distribution (a quantum extension of a probability distribution). By studyingÂ theÂ Kirkwood-Dirac distribution, we show how to construct filters that performÂ this unbounded and lossless information compression.Â Our results are notÂ only theoreticallyÂ interesting, but also practically. In several technologies,Â it is advantageous to compress information in as few states as possible, forÂ example, to avoid detector saturationÂ and/or to reduce post-processing costs.Â Our filters can reduce arbitrarily the quantum-state intensity on experimentalÂ detectors, while retaining all initial information. Thus,Â we extend pre- andÂ post-selected techniques of weak-value amplification to the growing fields ofÂ quantum machine learning and quantum multiparameter metrology.\n\nThursday, 30 June 2022 @ 12 PM in 149 Keck Center, or join us on Zoom.\n\nAbstract: Quantum Theory requires a background causal structure for its formulation, with temporal and spatial correlations treated in a very asymmetric way. However, spacetime might lose its classical propertiesÂ when Quantum Theory combines with General Relativity. This motivates a more general framework where causal relations are not set a priori. A further motivation comes from distributed networks, where the causal order of events might not be known in advance. I will present a formalism that posits the local validity of quantum mechanics locally but does not assume a global causal structure. Besides reproducing all standard quantum scenarios, the formalism predicts novel, âindefiniteâ causal relations. Such causal relations can be realised in thought experiments involving superpositions of spacetime metrics, but also describe laboratory experiments with events delocalised in time, opening the way to novel resources for computation and communication. Finally, the same formalism provides a natural framework to describe non-Markovian quantum processes, resolving an open problem in the study of open quantum systems.\n\nFriday, 6 May 2022 @ 9 AM. Join us on Zoom.\n\nAbstract: Weak value amplification and other postselection-based metrological protocols can enhance precision while estimating small parameters, outperforming postselection-free protocols. In general, these enhancements are largely constrained because the protocols yielding higher precision are rarely obtained due to a lower probability of successful postselection. It is shown that this precision can further be improved with the help of quantum resources like entanglement and negativity in the quasiprobability distribution. However, these quantum advantages in attaining considerable success probability with large precision are bounded irrespective of any accessible quantum resources. Here we derive a bound of these advantages in postselected metrology, establishing a connection with weak value optimization where the latter can be understood in terms of geometric phase. We introduce a scheme that saturates the bound, yielding anomalously large precision. Usually, negative quasiprobabilities are considered essential in enabling postselection to increase precision beyond standard optimized values. In contrast, we prove that these advantages can indeed be achieved with positive quasiprobability distribution. We also provide an optimal metrological scheme using a three level non-degenerate quantum system.\n\nWednesday, 27 April @ 12PM in 149 Keck Center, orÂ join us on Zoom.\n\nAbstract: The book The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*** has made the New York Times bestseller list for months by disparaging self-help books that glorify positivity. Positivity doesnât live up to expectations in metrology, either. Common metrological protocols include parameter estimation. In some parameter estimations, the final measurement is the most costly step. In these cases, postselectingâdiscarding some trials before they finishâcan raise the average information obtained per unit cost. Such experiments, I will show, are usefully described by a particular quasiprobability distribution. Quasiprobabilities resemble probaiblities but can assume negative and nonreal, or ânonclassical,â values. These values arise only if relevant operators fail to commute with each other. Only if the distribution contains negative quasiprobabilities does the information-cost rate exceed the rate achievable with commuting operators. Hence this distribution serves as a mathematical tool for pinpointing operator noncommutationâa hallmark of quantum physicsâas a metrological advantageâs source. I will discuss this theory and a recent photonic test of it. The experiment uncovered a proportionality between the metrological advantage and a measure of the distributionâs nonclassicality.Â\n\nFull title: Can a qubit be your friend? Why experimental metaphysics needs a quantum computer\n\nAbstract:\n\nExperimental metaphysics is the study of how empirical results can reveal indisputable facts about the fundamental nature of the world, independent of any theory. It is a field born from Bellâs 1964 theorem, and the experiments it inspired, proving the world cannot be both local and deterministic. However, there is an implicit assumption in Bellâs theorem, that the observed result of any measurement is absolutely real (it has some value that is not real only to the observer who made it, or only in the âbranchâ in which it appears). This assumption is called into question when one thinks of the observer as a quantum system (the âWignerâs Friendâ scenario), which has recently been the subject of renewed interest. In [1], I and co-workers derived a theorem, in experimental metaphysics, for this scenario. It is similar to Bellâs 1964 theorem but dispenses with the assumption of determinism. We show that the remaining assumptions, which we collectively call \"local friendliness\", are still predicted, by most approaches to quantum mechanics, to be violable. We illustrate this in an experiment in which the âfriendâ system is a single photonic qubit. In [2], I and other co-workers argue that a truly convincing experiment could be realised if that system were a sufficiently advanced artificial intelligence software running on a very large quantum computer, so that it could be regarded genuinely as a friend. We formulate a new version of the theorem for that situation, using six assumptions, each of which is violated in at least one approach to quantum theory. The popular attitude that âquantum theory needs no interpretationâ is untenable because it does not indicate that any of the assumptions are invalid.\n\n[1] Bong et al., âA strong no-go theorem on the Wignerâs friend paradoxâ, Nature Physics 16, 1199 (2020).\n\n[2] Wiseman, Cavalcanti, and Rieffel, âA âthoughtfulâ Local Friendliness no-go theoremâ, in preparation.\n\nMonday, 29 November, 2021 @ 12 PM in Room 149 of the Keck Center\n\nor on Zoom\n\nAbstract:For the last few years, quantum dots have served as building blocks for many theoretical and experimental works in quantum thermodynamics as a consequence of their straightforward energy-filtering properties to which thermoelectricity is tightly linked. Making use of the physics of resonant tunneling, we design a quantum absorption refrigerator where a hot electronic cavity is coupled to two colder electron reservoirs via single-level quantum dots. By appropriately positioning the dotsâ resonant levels, one can extract heat from the hot cavity and use it as a resource to refrigerate the coldest electron reservoir. The refrigeratorâs performance can be optimized by fine-tuning the dot levelsâ positions and widths. Further, we associate arbitrary number of such refrigerators in series, and demonstrate how to achieve precise thermal control across the chain: This is accomplished by positioning the dots' energy levels such that a predetermined distribution of heat currents is realized across the chain in the steady state. Finally, the rich physics of single-level quantum dots strongly coupled to structured electron reservoirs will be discussed. For reservoirs with band gaps, we witness an abrupt transition, linked to the appearance of an infinite-lifetime bound state, as the dot-reservoir coupling is increased. A signature of this transition can be observed in the dotâs transmission function, with dramatic effects on the dotâs thermoelectric properties.\n\nMonday, 22 November, 2021 @ 12 PM in Room 149 of the Keck Center\n\nor on Zoom\n\nAbstract: We will study the phenomena of heat transport and dissipation in open quantum systems. In particular, we will investigate the phenomena of absorption refrigeration, where refrigeration is achieved by heating instead of work, in two different setups: a minimal set up based on coupled qubits, and two non-linearly coupled resonators. Considering ZZ interaction between the two qubits, we will outline the basic ingredients required to achieve cooling. We will compare the cooling effect obtained in the qubit case with that of non-linearly coupled resonators (multi-level system) where the ZZ interaction translates to a Kerr-type non-linearity. Using Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we will go beyond first order sequential tunneling processes and study the effect of higher order processes on refrigeration. We find reduced cooling effect compared to the master equation calculations.\n\nIn the next half of the presentation, we will present a unified approach to study continuous measurement based quantum thermal machines in static as well as adiabatically driven systems. In the adiabatically driven case, we will show how measurement based thermodynamic quantities can be attributed geometric characteristics. We will also provide the appropriate definition for heat transfer and dissipation owing to continuous measurement in the presence and absence of adiabatic driving. We will illustrate the aforementioned ideas and study the phenomena of refrigeration in two different paradigmatic examples: a coupled quantum dot and a coupled qubit system, both undergoing continuous measurement and slow driving. We will observe that quantum measurement can provide significant boost to the power of adiabatic quantum refrigerators.\n\nMonday, 8 November, 2021 @ 12 PM in Room 149 of the Keck Center\n\nor on Zoom\n\nAbstract: While complex numbers are essential in mathematics, they are not needed to describe physical experiments, expressed in terms of probabilities, hence real numbers. Physics however aims to explain, rather than describe, experiments through theories. Although most theories of physics are based on real numbers, quantum theory was the first to be formulated in terms of operators acting on complex Hilbert spaces. This has puzzled countless physicists, including the fathers of the theory, for whom a real version of quantum theory, with real operators and states, seemed much more natural. In fact, previous works showed that such a \"real quantum theory\" can reproduce the outcomes of any multipartite experiment, as long as the parts share arbitrary real quantum states. In this talk I will show that real and complex quantum theory make different predictions in network scenarios comprising independent states and measurements. This allows us to devise a Bell-like experiment whose successful realization would disprove real quantum theory, just as standard Bell experiments disproved classical physics.\n\nWednesday, 3 November, 2021 @ 4 PM in Room 149 of the Keck Center\n\nor on Zoom\n\nAbstract: Physical advantages to building a quantum computer out of optical frequency photons include: they suffer negligible environment decoherence even at room temperature, there is no cross talk, they network easily into arbitrary geometries, the relevant physics is not heuristic and is often both efficiently simulatable and verifiable with classical light, and measurements â the critical element for entropy reduction to achieve fault tolerance â are sharp and extremely fast. However these pale in comparison to the engineering advantages: all parts of the machine can be built in a tier-1 foundry, and packaged in the same back-end-of-line processes used to build laptops and cellphones. Thus with photons we can realistically stare down the sorts of numbers (~1 million qubits) which capture the size of machine required to do useful quantum computation.\n\nÂ\n\nSo what is the catch? The primary obstacle is that the specific type of entanglement we need between different photons can only be created probabilistically, and is difficult to create in the presence of loss. In this talk I will overview an architecture Fusion Based Quantum Computing (FBQC) that sits somewhere between the extremes of matter (circuit) based and one-way (cluster state) quantum computing. It requires the production of only fixed size entangled states regardless of the size of computation being performed, and these states can have high probability of loss (or failure to be produced at all). This allows us to attempt creation of the desired entangled states multiple times in parallel, and then to select out successful events.\n\nMonday, 25 October, 2021 @ 12PM in Room 149 of the Keck Center\n\nor on Zoom\n\nAbstract: Quantum walks (QWs) are unitary analogues of classical random walks, and quantum cellular automata (QCAs) are unitary analogues of classical cellular automata. The QW on the 3D body-centered cubic lattice gives rise to solutions of the Dirac equation in the long-wavelength limit, both in 1D and 3D; in 1D, a two-dimensional internal space is required, and in 3D a four-dimensional internal space. QWs can be treated as the one-particle sector of a QCA, so it is natural to seek QCAs that give rise to quantum field theories in a similar limit. Â This can be done fairly straightforwardly in one spatial dimension, with the QCA being naturally described in terms of creation and annihilation operators that create or destroy particle locally, evolve simply under the QCA unitary, and obey the usual anticommutation relations. Â However, generalizing this construction to two or more spatial dimensions fails: Â the requirements of anticommuting creation and annihilation operators are inconsistent with a local QCA. Â For a QCA to give rise to a fermionic quantum field theory in the long-wavelength limit, one must give up at least one desired property of the QCA. To evade this no-go theorem, one can let the local subsystems become high-dimensional, and restrict to the completely antisymmetric subspace of a larger space. Bosonic QCAs can also be constructed; these do not have the same problem with anticommutation, but also require high-dimensional local subsystems. Taking these constructions as a model of particles propagating in discrete spacetime, the discreteness could be detected using non-parallel matter interferometers. Finally, we consider the problem of adding fermion-boson interactions, and progress towards constructing a fully interacting QCA model, and the potential for using QCAs to simulate quantum field theory.\n\nMonday, 11 October, 2021 @ 12PM in 370 Keck Center\n\nor on Zoom\n\nAbstract: Uncertainty relations play a crucial role in quantum mechanics. Well-defined methods exist for the derivation of such uncertainties for pairs of observables. Specific methods also lead to time-energy uncertainty relations. However, in these cases, different approaches are associated with different meanings and interpretations. In this talk, the time-energy uncertainty relation of interest revolves around the idea of whether quantum mechanics inherently imposes a fundamental minimum duration for energy measurements with a certain precision. Within the Page and Wootters timeless framework, it will be discussed how energy measurements modify the relative ``flow of time'' between internal and external clocks. This provides a unified framework for discussing the subject, allowing the recovery of previous results and derivation of new ones. In particular, it will be shown that the duration of an energy measurement carried out by an external system cannot be performed arbitrarily fast from the perspective of the internal clock. Moreover, it will be demonstrated that the evolution given by the internal clock during any energy measurement is non-unitary. Finally, if time allows, new developments associating non-unitarity to non-inertial clocks will be presented."
