        "text": "One of Phillip Ensler’s most treasured possessions is a signed photograph of baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron that he got when he was in middle school.\n\nEnsler’s mother bought the picture of the famous right fielder at a gallery in San Francisco. There’s a connection between the civil rights story of an African American baseball player from Mobile and the Montgomery advocate that Ensler, 29, is today.\n\nEnsler wasn't just inspired by Aaron because he broke records hitting home runs —although Ensler and his family are big baseball fans cheering for the Yankees from their home in New York, where Ensler was born and raised.\n\nAaron was Ensler's childhood hero because of his place in civil rights history. Aaron resolved to become a Major League Baseball player after listening to a speech by Jackie Robinson, who integrated the top professional league. Aaron later took a stance against the lingering racism in baseball in defiance of death threats. Ensler’s mother read a book about Aaron to Ensler when he was a child.\n\n“It was a sportswriter telling the story of Hank Aaron's place in baseball history with an interesting sort of background of the civil rights movement in the 1960s and how that affected who he was as a man and player,” Ensler’s mother, Marcy Abelow, said.\n\nEnsler's mother instilled the importance of public service in Ensler from a young age. Every Thanksgiving, she took him and his twin sister to deliver meals to sick people as part of God's Love We Deliver — an organization that serves the five boroughs of New York.\n\n\"They came into contact with people that live right smack in the middle of the city, and have a completely different experience. It was an eye-opener. Just being aware of things that other people don’t have has kind of shaped who he is,\" Abelow said.\n\nEnsler is being recognized as the Montgomery Advertiser's Community Hero for September because at an intersection of politics, education and legal defense, he is an advocate for those in need. He breaks barriers for low income people with no access to a lawyer and pushes for criminal justice reform. He’s helped organize a community reconciliation project to honor lynching victims. And, for eight years, Ensler has brought hope to underprivileged students in Montgomery by introducing them to powerful people in the White House and across Washington, D.C., with similar stories.\n\nMore: Community coalition hosts meeting in hopes of claiming EJI lynching memorial column\n\nEnsler had brought 70 students to meet successful professionals in Washington, D.C., as part of his Marching On program. Some students who participate had never boarded an airplane before the trips. One student who was unaccustomed to staying in a hotel thought her suitcase was stolen when the hotel door man took it. Another student in business attire was elated to tears when a stranger mistook her for a professional who worked in the Capitol.\n\nMore: Marching On program looking for MPS high schoolers to take on D.C. trip\n\nJeremi Moore, 18, who participated in Ensler’s Marching On program when he was a senior at Park Crossing High School, said the experience was uplifting and validated his hard work as a high-achieving student. Ensler has been an irreplaceable mentor to Moore, who was raised by a single mother.\n\n“I would have been good if my father would have been great, but to have more male figures that are great men, it takes you to a level of good to great,” Moore said.\n\nEnsler's father displayed a selflessness that made Ensler want to be a good example for his students, including Moore, who he considers a surrogate son. Ensler said his father always made sure he was able to pursue the opportunities he wanted.\n\n\"I try to support students in Montgomery the way my dad supported me. They deserve the best opportunities and experiences like I was fortunate to have,\" Ensler said.\n\nEnsler introduces high school students to stories of success to pass on the opportunities he has had. In high school and college, he interned for the first black governor of New York, David Paterson. As a college student at George Washington University, he worked closely with Reggie Love, then-President Barack Obama’s most recognized personal aide, at the White House.\n\nLove said he was so impressed by Ensler, he convinced internship coordinators to keep Ensler there longer than the program allowed. He talked about Ensler’s professional calm carrying out responsibilities as an intern at the center of the executive branch.\n\n“I can think of some times when he was in my office and the president would come into my office, that was just outside of the Oval Office — and most people would, sort of, have this moment of getting startled, or intimidation,” Love said. “Phil always presented himself like, 'I’m supposed to be here. I’m excited to be here. What can I do? How can I be helpful?' ”\n\nEnsler said he started as an intern but eventually moved up to a higher position at the White House. Love eventually recognized Ensler wasn’t just there for status but desired to do something important.\n\n“I definitely over time realized he was in it for the right reasons and was in it because he wanted to have an impact and make a difference — and wasn’t just in it for, sort of, the titles and the prestige,” Love said.\n\nLove continued to mentor Ensler after Ensler finished his assignment at the White House. Students in the Marching On program have had the chance to meet Love in Washington.\n\nOn five of the trips to Washington, where students get to meet prominent people like Love, Joshua Stone has been a chaperone. Stone worked with Ensler at Robert E. Lee High School, where Ensler taught through the Teach for America, which first brought him to Montgomery. Stone said he's seen students have epiphany moments when they realize how fortunate they are to be able to meet people at the top.\n\n“The fact that they’re able to mingle with and associate with and ask questions of the person who was essentially the body man for the president, that registers with them,” he said.\n\nMeeting with various business and political leaders is just as rewarding to Stone as it is valuable to the students\n\n“Sometimes sitting in these meetings with these very powerful people, you sort of pinch yourself,” he said.\n\nThe trip is a part of a broader program with the effort to prepare for college. Students attend events and meet people before they board the plane. They met former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in March at a commemoration for the 1965 civil rights protesters who marched from Selma to Montgomery, as well as Congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis.\n\nEnsler is starting an additional program called the Mission Possible Initiative with a finance and business focus. As part of the program, Ensler will bring students to New York in June to meet with corporate executives. Students from any of the five traditional public high schools in Montgomery can apply. Both the Marching On Program and the Mission Possible Initiative are free to the students selected.\n\nIt's hard to imagine how Ensler has time to sleep when on top of running ambitious educational programs, he's the policy counsel at Alabama Appleseed⁠ Center for Law and Justice and President of the Jewish Federation of Central Alabama.\n\nAs policy counsel for Alabama Appleseed, he manages the Access to Justice Campaign to improve access to adequate counsel for indigent clients in criminal and civil cases —an invaluable job when attorneys are overwhelmed with caseloads and don’t have access to the resources prosecutors do, like social workers and investigators.\n\nEnsler said because the defense system varies by judicial circuit, it's hard to determine how big of an issue access to lawyers is in Alabama, but he said the need is there.\n\n“We’ve interviewed people throughout the state, especially in the Black Belt who are getting sued by payday lenders or getting evicted and just don’t have a lawyer. They can’t afford a lawyer. They don’t know how to get one,\" Ensler said.\n\nAs part of his role at Alabama Appleseed, Ensler also pushes for statewide policy reform that would help reduce the prison population, make conditions more humane and provide services for the formerly incarcerated.\n\n“Throughout college and law school, I was aware how much of a barrier on people our system is, especially for people who don’t have the resources and often people of color,” Ensler said.\n\nEnsler's passion for criminal justice reform crystallized with an internship he completed in law school at the Innocence Project in New York where he helped exonerate Andre Hackett, who spent 25 years in prison for a murder he didn't commit.\n\n\"What amazed me most about Andre was that when he was released, despite the egregious miscarriage of justice that was done against him, his heart was filled with joy and hope and forgiveness,\" Ensler said. \"His case exposed me first hand to the injustices that some of the most vulnerable members of our society face. His case gave me an acute understanding of how the criminal justice system can be stacked against those without the financial means or influence to get a quality defense.\"\n\nEnsler ties together his Jewish upbringing and involvement in the Jewish community with the civil rights projects and education he's involved in. He had a b'nai mitzvah with his twin sister and they went to a Jewish summer camp together as children. Caroline Ensler said the camp instilled a responsibility to community.\n\nAs president of the Jewish Federation of Central Alabama, Ensler is in charge of overall operations of the organization that raises funds for local and international Jewish causes and organizations. The Jewish Federation has also sponsored students to go to Washington with Marching On.\n\n\"It's important for the community to know that there are people outside MPS supporting MPS students,\" Ensler said.\n\nJewish Federation board member Lisa Weil said Ensler serving as president attracts younger members, which is an advantage when the Jewish population is declining.\n\n\"It's hard to get young people to buy into organized religion and our federation is not about organized religion. It's about all of us coming together as one,\" Weil said.\n\nMontgomery has two Jewish congregations, one conservative and one reform. Weil said there are around 130 families in the reform congregation at the synagogue Temple Beth Or, which means house of light. Ensler is on the board of Agudath Israel Etz Ahayem synagogue.\n\nEnsler said his Jewish faith inspired him with the duty to serve others.\n\n\"There is a famous Jewish teaching from a book called the Talmud that says, 'Do not be daunted by the enormity of the world's grief. Do justly now, love mercy now, walk humbly now. You are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you free to abandon it,\" Ensler said.\n\nCommunity Heroes Montgomery\n\nThe 12-month Community Heroes Montgomery, sponsored by Beasley Allen Law Firm, will profile one person every month this year.\n\nEvery monthly winner will receive a travel voucher from the Montgomery Regional Airport and American Airlines, a staycation from Wind Creek, dinner at Itta Bena restaurant and a certificate of appreciation from Montgomery's mayor.\n\nAt the end of the 12 months, the Heroes will be recognized at a banquet, and a \"Hero of 2019\" will be honored.\n\nThe 12 categories the Montgomery Advertiser will focus on: educator, health, business leader, military, youth, law enforcement, fire/EMT, nonprofit/community service, religious leader, senior volunteer, entertainment (arts/music) and athletics (such as a coach).\n\nDo you know a Community Hero?\n\nTo nominate someone for Community Heroes Montgomery, email communityheroes@gannett.com.
