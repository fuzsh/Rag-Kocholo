        "text": "Stop right now, thank you very much. Stop in the name of love. Stop, collaborate, and listen. Stop, hammer time. But more important than these songs, there is so much power in these 4 simple letters when you apply it to your own stress response and regulation. You see, we are now teaching this to children but there are still so many adults that need to use emotional regulation skills but sadly we missed out because the language was just not available. Here‚Äôs the thing, just because we didn‚Äôt know, shouldn‚Äôt stop us from learning now. STOP what you‚Äôre doing. TAKE a breath. OBSERVE what you are feeling. PROCEED now that you‚Äôve taken some time to review and decide what you are going to do. This is a bit like the quote often attributed to Viktor Frankl ‚ÄúBetween stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.‚Äù Another way we look at it is to get curious about what is happening, why you reacted that way, and then become the scientist of your own experience. It will take practice but it will make so much of a difference, not just at work but in your life in general. Now back to the Spice Girls, all together now ‚Äì Stop right now, Thank you very much!

The reason that I've chosen this image is because I feel this book says so much about me. Despite appearances, I can be incredibly fixed mindset at times, as I think we all can but might not like to admit. But admitting that to yourself when you have noticed it is the first step towards being able to take action to change things. I realised some time ago that fear and stepping out of ones comfort zone is something that can massively hold us back. By being put in the position where we can notice our thinking, we are then more able to take control. This is what I believe is so powerful for children and if we can start to influence certain belief systems around learning and self from an early age, this will help to develop a tendency to shift more towards the growth than the fixed mindset in times of struggle. Knowing you can change things if you want to is a huge motivator to take action. Neuroplasticity has shown us that the brain does change and develop in reaction to what we put in so developing good learning habits is key to developing helpful attitudes towards learning. If children know this, it can change how they view the learning situation and move it from a place of rigid 'stuckness' to one where we can make change happen. But change does not just happen. The little habits and nudges need to be consistent and little things that adults do/say matter because we can unknowingly drive children towards a fixed mindset - but we need to know what those things are. I believe in creating explicit value systems that create a culture and 'vibe' for learning that is delightful. That is what I am aiming to build with #growthmindsetbykjwalton. Our education system can at times remove the delight from learning which pains me. The ideas and books I have created to drive this culture come from a place that aims to create curiosity, develop imagination, get kids thinking about themselves as a learner and the fact that they are in the driving seat and encourage this to be done in creative ways that can trickle through the everyday. I'm all about the trickle! I believe in unlocking the stuck and allowing children to' set their bubble free' by creating this culture and dialogue around them. This is the tag line in 'I can't do this' as Fortitude goes on a journey where he finds the word YET. #growthmindsetbykjwalton #growthmindset #Fortitude #beliefs #values #learning #stuck #yet #habits #nudges #nationalstorytellingweek #22storiesandme\n\n‚ö° The Pygmalion Effect: How Expectations Shape Our Performance Imagine a teacher who believes a student has exceptional potential. They provide extra support, challenging tasks, and positive reinforcement. Remarkably, the student thrives and lives up to those high expectations. This is the essence of the Pygmalion effect, a fascinating psychological phenomenon. ‚ö° Origin of the Term The term Pygmalion comes from Greek mythology. Pygmalion, a sculptor, fell in love with a statue he created. The goddess Aphrodite, recognizing his devotion, brought the statue to life. Similarly, the Pygmalion effect suggests that the sculptor's (teacher's) expectations breathe life (potential) into the student. üí™ The Pygmalion Effect in Action Education: Teachers who hold high expectations for their students tend to see those students perform better. Students may internalize these expectations, leading to increased effort and motivation. Workplace: Managers who believe in their employees' capabilities often empower them with challenging assignments and provide constructive feedback. This can foster growth and improved performance. Parenting: Parents who express confidence in their children's abilities can encourage them to take on new challenges and persevere through difficulties. ‚ö° The Power of Belief The Pygmalion effect highlights the power of belief. When others believe in us, it can boost our confidence, effort, and ultimately, our performance. It's Not All Positive It's important to remember that the Pygmalion effect has a flip side. Low expectations can create a self-fulfilling prophecy as well, leading to decreased motivation and poorer performance. This is sometimes referred to as the Golem effect, after a mythical creature brought to life but lacking positive qualities. ‚ö° Harnessing the Pygmalion Effect üëá Here are some ways to leverage the Pygmalion effect: Teachers: Set high but achievable goals for students, provide them with the necessary support, and offer specific and encouraging feedback. Managers: Express confidence in your employees' abilities, delegate challenging tasks, and celebrate their successes. Parents: Offer encouragement, validate your children's efforts, and express your belief in their potential. By fostering positive expectations, we can create a powerful influence that empowers others to achieve their full potential.

It's all about being in tune with your cognitive processes and having the capability to assess their effectiveness. In order to use metacognition effectively, there are a few key strategies that can be employed: 1. Set Clear Goals and Track Progress: Start by defining your objectives and then keep a close eye on your journey towards achieving them. This ongoing self-assessment ensures you stay on the right track. 2. Embrace Self-Questioning: Ask yourself the \"whys\" and \"hows\" behind your actions. This practice will help you gain deeper insights into your decision-making processes and motivations. Metacognition can be your secret weapon across various aspects of life: #Learning: In education, metacognition empowers students to take charge of their learning journey. They can evaluate their understanding, choose effective study strategies, and adapt when challenges arise. It's the key to becoming a proactive learner. #Problem-Solving: When faced with complex problems, metacognition allows you to break them down into manageable pieces. Monitor your progress, adjust your approach, and witness your problem-solving skills reach new heights. #Decision-Making: In the realm of decision-making, metacognition helps you navigate the biases and thought processes influencing your choices. Awareness of your own thinking patterns leads to more informed and rational decisions. #Personal Growth: For personal development enthusiasts, metacognition is a game-changer. It fosters self-awareness and self-improvement. When you know your cognitive strengths and weaknesses, you can work on enhancing your abilities and addressing areas for improvement. It's the path to continuous growth and development. In summary, metacognition is the art of understanding and managing your own thinking processes. Embrace metacognition, and you will navigate your inner thought process with precision, leading to improved learning outcomes and personal growth. #Metacognition #ThinkingAboutThinking #MindMastery #designthinking #snsdesignthinkers #snsinstitutions\n\n\"Sir, how do you manage to hold the space with GenZies and at the same pace of energy...?\" Often I am asked this question and most of the times I am left with 1 answer... \"I soak in their energy which helps me to release it back to them\" Perplexed? I am sure you are.. üòä Well, it's nothing magical, it's just how #Intentional, #Authentic & #Human you are in the approach. It's how much you want to understand their emotions and help them manage it well, channelizing the energy in the right direction. In the fast pace evolving landscape of education, it's crucial to recognize the unique needs of Generation Z. As educators, mentors and leaders, our role extends far beyond imparting knowledge; it's about fostering holistic growth and emotional intelligence. Gen Z faces a plethora of challenges - from navigating digital landscapes to coping with societal pressures. Now more than ever, understanding and managing their emotions stand as foundational life skills. Why is this essential? Because emotional intelligence isn't just about being 'nice' or 'polite'; it's about equipping young minds with the tools to thrive in an increasingly complex environment. #Empathy - one of the cornerstones of emotional intelligence, forms the bedrock of meaningful connections. Knowing & empathizing with Gen Z, we create a psychological safe space, where they feel understood, valued and empowered to pursue their passions. Moreover, teaching emotional literacy cultivates resilience, enabling Gen Z to bounce back from setbacks and adapt to changing circumstances, in a ever fast-paced world. So, how can we support Gen Z in this journey? It strongly starts with #ActiveListening, #GenuineEngagement and an open-mind & heart approach. By meeting them where they are, we stand to bridge generational gaps and foster mutual understanding. I invite you to harness the #PowerOfEmpathy and #EmotionalIntelligence to empower Gen Z - not just as learners, but as future leaders and changemakers. Time to pave the way for a more compassionate and inclusive society. #Education #LifeSkills #GenZ #FutureLeaders\n\nThe Power of Your Brain: Strategies for Optimal Knowledge Retention In our fast-paced world, the ability to retain knowledge is a game-changer.
