        "text": "Here's a $100 billion question: How did Frank Slootman disrupt entire industries as CEO of Snowflake, ServiceNow and Data Domain? Here's his 5 part company building manifesto that I live by: 1) Compress Timelines Slowness kills companies. \"People sometimes ask to get back to me in a week, and I ask, why not tomorrow?\" 2) Relentless Intensity \"Business is war. \"We fought giant incumbents for their existence every single day. We were paranoid and felt constantly threatened with our survival. You could not escape the combat mentality at our companies. We were in a shit fight all the time.\" 3) Be an Energizer Bunny Your job is to be endlessly energetic. Great companies feed on energy. 4) Ruthlessly Eliminate Mediocrity Everyone knows poor performers hurt companies. But Slootman takes it even further: mediocrity makes top performers drop their standards. 5) Narrow the Focus \"People say they want focus but their actions don't show it. Focus means: what are you NOT going to do?\"\n\nWhat are all companies trying to do no matter the industry or size? Increase revenue and reduce costs. Want to learn how you can do both successfully? YES, I bet you do, so call us. ServiceNow went through (and continues to go through) itâ€™s own transformation during the last five to seven years thatâ€™s allowed us to continue to grow at scale. Happy to share how we used our own software across IT, CX, HR, and App Development to help enable and prepare our company for the success weâ€™ve been having, and will continue to have. #NowonNow #ServiceNow #platformofplatforms\n\n\"How do I ignite a passion for knowledge sharing and KB article writing in my teams?\" It's a common question, and here's the surprising twist: it's not all about tools or fancy workflows, although they do help. The real secret sauce? Your company's CULTURE. Yep, it's all about the vibe you create around knowledge sharing. Stellar content thrives in a collaborative atmosphere where everyone chips in. So, if you want your team to rock at KB articles and sharing technical solutions, foster a culture that celebrates collaboration. Trust me, when you build that vibe, your team becomes a powerhouse of impact and innovation. Grateful and proud to contribute to Snowflake's customer-centric culture. Our engineers prioritise customers and embody KCS principles. #CustomerFirst #TeamSnowflake ðŸš€\n\nI've wrapped up AWS re:Invent! 20,000 steps a day later -- after dozens of partner and customer meetings, great time reconnecting with my team and old colleagues -- I'm leaving Las Vegas tired, but more energized and excited about the Slack Ecosystem than ever before. Some of my key Slack-y takeaways from the event: * AWS Developers continue to find Slack indispensable as a platform to support their work, throughout the development lifecycle. They're embodying the vibrancy of the Slack ecosystem -- integrating Slack with their core systems in ways we couldn't even imagine. * Unsurprisingly, AI use cases are at the forefront for developers on Slack. Partners are already bringing in their AI insights to make Slack users more productive . They're also identifying and acknowledging the incredible value of their Slack history as a resource for enriching their own solutions. We're working hard to think through all AI Ecosystem use cases to ensure that our mutual customers can jointly benefit from safe and reliable AI solutions. * Finally, I'm grateful for my community of technology leaders out there who really made the trip down to Vegas worthwhile.
