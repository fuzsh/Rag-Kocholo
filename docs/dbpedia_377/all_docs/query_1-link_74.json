        "text": "Introduction\n\nAbout 10,000 Native Americans served in the Korean War, including many who had been World War II veterans. Of those, some 194 died in service to their country. In addition to three Medal of Honor recipients, other Native Americans received Bronze, Silver, and lesser meritorious awards for bravery. As hard as we have tried to provide a comprehensive guide to our Native American heroes, this page of the KWE will not be fully complete without the assistance of members of the general public who can provide further information to us about Native American Korean War veterans. Native Hawaiians and Native Alaskans are included on this Native American page. To add information to this page of the Korean War Educator, contact Lynnita@thekwe.org.\n\nMost recent update to this page: May 28, 2024\n\nThe publication of this Topics page was made possible by\n\na grant from the Illinois Humanities Council.\n\nPage Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nAward Recipients - Native Americans\n\nMost Decorated\n\nMedal of Honor\n\nSilver Star\n\nDistinguished Flying Cross\n\nBronze Star\n\nKilled in Action/Missing in Action\n\nDeaths Outside of Theatre\n\nNative American Korean War Veterans of Note\n\nNative American Females - Korean War Veterans\n\nCode Talkers in Korean War\n\nAlaskan Native American Fatalities\n\nNative Hawaiians Killed in the Korean War\n\nRemembering Our Native American Veterans\n\nBack to Page Contents\n\nAward Recipients - Native Americans\n\nMost Decorated - Pascal C. Poolaw Sr.\n\nPascal C. Poolaw Sr.\n\nThe most decorated American Indian was a Kiowa from Oklahoma--Pascal Cleatus Poolaw Sr. He was born January 29, 1922, in Apache, Oklahoma, and married Irene Chalepah on March 15, 1940. They were parents of four sons. Poolaw joined the Army in 1942 and received his first Purple Heart and first Silver Star in Belgium. He served in Korea with Company L and received two more Silver Stars and a Distinguished Service Cross in Korea. He retired from the Army in 1962, but rejoined the Army in 1967 during the Vietnam War. He was deployed to Vietnam on May 31, 1967 and was the 1st Sergeant of C Company, 26th Infantry Regiment when he was ambushed and killed. He received his fourth Silver Star posthumously. He received a total of 42 medals and citations during his three-war military career.\n\nBack to Page Contents\n\nMedal of Honor\n\nBarfoot, Van Thomas (World War II award)\n\nVan Thomas Barfoot\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty on 23 May 1944, near Carano, Italy. With his platoon heavily engaged during an assault against forces well entrenched on commanding ground, 2d Lt. Barfoot (then Tech. Sgt.) moved off alone upon the enemy left flank. He crawled to the proximity of 1 machinegun nest and made a direct hit on it with a hand grenade, killing 2 and wounding 3 Germans. He continued along the German defense line to another machinegun emplacement, and with his tommygun killed 2 and captured 3 soldiers. Members of another enemy machinegun crew then abandoned their position and gave themselves up to Sgt. Barfoot. Leaving the prisoners for his support squad to pick up, he proceeded to mop up positions in the immediate area, capturing more prisoners and bringing his total count to 17. Later that day, after he had reorganized his men and consolidated the newly captured ground, the enemy launched a fierce armored counterattack directly at his platoon positions. Securing a bazooka, Sgt. Barfoot took up an exposed position directly in front of 3 advancing Mark VI tanks. From a distance of 75 yards his first shot destroyed the track of the leading tank, effectively disabling it, while the other 2 changed direction toward the flank. As the crew of the disabled tank dismounted, Sgt. Barfoot killed 3 of them with his tommygun. He continued onward into enemy terrain and destroyed a recently abandoned German fieldpiece with a demolition charge placed in the breech. While returning to his platoon position, Sgt. Barfoot, though greatly fatigued by his Herculean efforts, assisted 2 of his seriously wounded men 1,700 yards to a position of safety. Sgt. Barfoot's extraordinary heroism, demonstration of magnificent valor, and aggressive determination in the face of pointblank fire are a perpetual inspiration to his fellow soldiers.\n\n[KWE Note: Colonel Barfoot was born June 15, 1919 in Edinburg, Mississippi. His birth name was Van Thurman Barfoot. His grandmother was a Choctaw. Barfoot served in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. He died March 2, 2012 in Richmond, Virginia.]\n\nBurris, SFC Tony Kenneth\n\nTony Kenneth Burris\n\nRank and organization: Sergeant First Class, U.S. Army, Company L, 38th Infantry Regiment, 2d Infantry Division. Place and date: vicinity of Mundung-ni, Korea 8 and 9 October 1951. Entered service at: Blanchard, Okla. Birth: Blanchard, Oklahoma. He was a member of the Choctaw tribe.\n\nG.O. No.: 84, 5 September 1952. Citation: Sfc. Burris, a member of Company L, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and outstanding courage above and beyond the call of duty. On 8 October, when his company encountered intense fire from an entrenched hostile force, Sfc. Burris charged forward alone, throwing grenades into the position and destroying approximately 15 of the enemy. On the following day, spearheading a renewed assault on enemy positions on the next ridge, he was wounded by machine gun fire but continued the assault, reaching the crest of the ridge ahead of his unit and sustaining a second wound. Calling for a 57mm. recoilless rifle team, he deliberately exposed himself to draw hostile fire and reveal the enemy position. The enemy machine gun emplacement was destroyed. The company then moved forward and prepared to assault other positions on the ridge line. Sfc. Burris, refusing evacuation and submitting only to emergency treatment, joined the unit in its renewed attack but fire from hostile emplacement halted the advance. Sfc. Burris rose to his feet, charged forward and destroyed the first emplacement with its heavy machine gun and crew of 6 men. Moving out to the next emplacement, and throwing his last grenade which destroyed this position, he fell mortally wounded by enemy fire. Inspired by his consummate gallantry, his comrades renewed a spirited assault which overran enemy positions and secured Hill 605, a strategic position in the battle for \"Heartbreak Ridge,\" Sfc. Burris' indomitable fighting spirit, outstanding heroism, and gallant self-sacrifice reflect the highest glory upon himself, the infantry and the U.S. Army.\n\nGeorge, Pfc. Charles\n\nCharles George\n\nRank and organization: Private First Class, U.S. Army, Company C, 179th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Division. Place and date: Near Songnae-dong, Korea, 30 November 1952. Entered service at: Whittier, North Carolina. Born: 23 August 1932, Cherokee, North Carolina. He was a member of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee tribe. He attended the Indian School on the Qualla Boundary of Western North Carolina, and then enlisted in the Army at the age of 18. His brother was Norman George, a World War II Marine (1927-1994).\n\nG.O. NO.: 19, 18 March 1954. Citation: Pfc. George, a member of Company C, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and outstanding courage above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy on the night of 30 November 1952. He was a member of a raiding party committed to engage the enemy and capture a prisoner for interrogation. Forging up the rugged slope of the key terrain feature, the group was subjected to intense mortar and machine gun fire and suffered several casualties. Throughout the advance, he fought valiantly and, upon reaching the crest of the hill, leaped into the trenches and closed with the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. When friendly troops were ordered to move back upon completion of the assignment, he and 2 comrades remained to cover the withdrawal. While in the process of leaving the trenches a hostile soldier hurled a grenade into their midst. Pfc. George shouted a warning to 1 comrade, pushed the other soldier out of danger, and, with full knowledge of the consequences, unhesitatingly threw himself upon the grenade, absorbing the full blast of the explosion. Although seriously wounded in this display of valor, he refrained from any outcry which would divulge the position of his companions. The 2 soldiers evacuated him to the forward aid station and shortly thereafter he succumbed to his wound. Pfc. George's indomitable courage, consummate devotion to duty, and willing self-sacrifice reflect the highest credit upon himself and uphold the finest traditions of the military service.\n\nHarvey, Capt. Raymond\n\nRaymond Harvey\n\n(Click picture for a larger view)\n\nRank and organization: Captain, U.S. Army, Company C, 17th Infantry Regiment. Place and date: Vicinity of Taemi-Dong, Korea, 9 March 1951. Entered service at: Pasadena, Calif. Born: 1 March 1920 Ford City, Pennsylvania. He was a member of the Chickasaw tribe.\n\nG.O. No.: 67, 2 August 1951. Citation: Capt. Harvey Company C, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action. When his company was pinned down by a barrage of automatic weapons fire from numerous well-entrenched emplacements, imperiling accomplishment of its mission, Capt. Harvey braved a hail of fire and exploding grenades to advance to the first enemy machine gun nest, killing its crew with grenades. Rushing to the edge of the next emplacement, he killed its crew with carbine fire. He then moved the 1st Platoon forward until it was again halted by a curtain of automatic fire from well fortified hostile positions. Disregarding the hail of fire, he personally charged and neutralized a third emplacement. Miraculously escaping death from intense crossfire, Capt. Harvey continued to lead the assault. Spotting an enemy pillbox well camouflaged by logs, he moved close enough to sweep the emplacement with carbine fire and throw grenades through the openings, annihilating its 5 occupants. Though wounded he then turned to order the company forward, and, suffering agonizing pain, he continued to direct the reduction of the remaining hostile positions, refusing evacuation until assured that the mission would be accomplished. Capt. Harvey's valorous and intrepid actions served as an inspiration to his company, reflecting the utmost glory upon himself and upholding the heroic traditions of the military service.\n\nKaho'ohanohano, Pfc. Anthony\n\nAnthony Kaho'ohanohano\n\nThis Native Hawaiian was born July 22, 1930 in Maui, Hawaii. A member of Company H, 17th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, he was killed in action on September 1, 1951. His Distinguished Service Cross was upgraded to a Medal of Honor and presented to his family by President Barack Obama.\n\nCitation: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty Private First Class Anthony T. Kaho'ohanohano, Company H, 17th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against the enemy in the vicinity of Chupa-ri, Korea, on 1 September 1951. On that date, Private First Class Kaho'ohanohano was in charge of a machine-gun squad supporting the defensive positioning of Company F when a numerically superior enemy force launched a fierce attack. Because of the enemy's overwhelming numbers, friendly troops were forced to execute a limited withdrawal. As the men fell back, Private First Class Kaho'ohanohano ordered his squad to take up more defensible positions and provide covering fire for the withdrawing friendly force. Although having been wounded in the shoulder during the initial enemy assault, Private First Class Kaho'ohanohano gathered a supply of grenades and ammunition and returned to his original position to face the enemy alone. As the hostile troops concentrated their strength against his emplacement in an effort to overrun it, Private First Class Kaho'ohanohano fought fiercely and courageously, delivering deadly accurate fire into the ranks of the onrushing enemy. When his ammunition was depleted, he engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat until he was killed. Private First Class Kaho'ohanohano's heroic stand so inspired his comrades that they launched a counterattack that completely repulsed the enemy. Upon reaching Private First Class Kaho'ohanohano's emplacement, friendly troops discovered 11 enemy soldiers lying dead in front of the emplacement and two inside it, killed in hand-to-hand combat. Private First Class Kaho'ohanohano's extraordinary heroism and selfless devotion to duty are in keeping with the finest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, the 7th Infantry Division, and the United States Army.\n\nKeeble, MSgt. Woodrow Wilson\n\nWoodrow Wilson Keeble\n\nHe was born May 16, 1917 in Waubey, South Dakota and died January 28, 1982. He is buried in Lake Transverse Indian Reservation Cemetery, Sisseton, South Dakota. He was a Dakota Sioux.\n\nCitation: Master Sergeant Woodrow W. Keeble distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and intrepedity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty in action with an armed enemy near Sangsan-ni, Korea on 20 October 1951. On that day, Master Sergeant Keeble was an acting platoon leader for the support platoon in Company G, 19th Infantry, in the attack on Hill 765, a steep and rugged position that was well defended by the enemy. Leading the support platoon, Master Sergeant Keeble saw that the attacking elements had become pinned down on the slope by heavy enemy fire from three well-fortified and strategically placed enemy positions. With complete disregard for his personal safety, Master Sergeant Keeble dashed forward and joined the pinned-down platoon. Then, hugging the ground, Master Sergeant Keeble crawled forward alone until he was in close proximity to one of the hostile machine-gun emplacements. Ignoring the heavy fire that the crew trained on him, Master Sergeant Keeble activated a grenade and threw it with great accuracy, successfully destroying the position. Continuing his one-man assault, he moved to the second enemy position and destroyed it with another grenade. Despite the fact that the enemy troops were now directing their firepower against him and unleashing a shower of grenades in a frantic attempt to stop his advance, he moved forward against the third hostile emplacement and skillfully neutralized the remaining enemy position. As his comrades moved forward to join him, Mater Sergeant Keeble continued to direct accurate fire against nearby trenches, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Inspired by his courage, Company G successfully moved forward and seized its important objective. The extraordinary courage, selfless service, and devotion to duty displayed that day by Master Sergeant Keeble was an inspiration to all around him and reflected great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.\n\nPilila'au, Herbert Kailieha\n\nHerbert Kailieha Pilila'au\n\nPfc. Pililaau, a member of Company C, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and outstanding courage above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy. The enemy sent wave after wave of fanatical troops against his platoon which held a key terrain feature on \"Heartbreak Ridge.\" Valiantly defending its position, the unit repulsed each attack until ammunition became practically exhausted and it was ordered to withdraw to a new position. Voluntarily remaining behind to cover the withdrawal, Pfc. Pililaau fired his automatic weapon into the ranks of the assailants, threw all his grenades and, with ammunition exhausted, closed with the foe in hand-to-hand combat, courageously fighting with his trench knife and bare fists until finally overcome and mortally wounded. When the position was subsequently retaken, more than 40 enemy dead were counted in the area he had so valiantly defended. His heroic devotion to duty, indomitable fighting spirit, and gallant self-sacrifice reflect the highest credit upon himself, the infantry, and the U.S. Army.\n\n[KWE Note: Pfc. Pilila'au was a Native Hawaiian.]\n\nRed Cloud, Cpl. Mitchell Jr.\n\nMitchell Red Cloud Jr.\n\n(Click picture for a larger view)\n\nRank and organization: Corporal, U S. Army, Company E, 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division. Place and date: Near Chonghyon, Korea, 5 November 1950. Entered service at: Merrilan Wisconsin. Born: 2 July 1924, Hatfield, Wisconsin. He was a member of the Ho-Chunk tribe.\n\nG.O. No.: 26, 25 April 1951. Citation: Cpl. Red Cloud, Company E, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy. From his position on the point of a ridge immediately in front of the company command post he was the first to detect the approach of the Chinese Communist forces and give the alarm as the enemy charged from a brush-covered area less than 100 feet from him. Springing up he delivered devastating pointblank automatic rifle fire into the advancing enemy. His accurate and intense fire checked this assault and gained time for the company to consolidate its defense. With utter fearlessness he maintained his firing position until severely wounded by enemy fire. Refusing assistance he pulled himself to his feet and wrapping his arm around a tree continued his deadly fire again, until he was fatally wounded. This heroic act stopped the enemy from overrunning his company's position and gained time for reorganization and evacuation of the wounded. Cpl. Red Cloud's dauntless courage and gallant self-sacrifice reflects the highest credit upon himself and upholds the esteemed traditions of the U.S. Army.\n\nBack to Page Contents\n\nSilver Star\n\nBald Eagle Bear, Frederick Ambrose\n\nCorporal Bald Eagle Bear received the Silver Star posthumously. See the Killed in Action section of this page. His Silver Star citation has not yet been found by the Korean War Educator.\n\nBenge, Martin\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Private First Class Martin Benge (ASN: RA-20828251), United States Army, for gallantry in action as a member of the Heavy Mortar Company, 34th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, on 6 July 1950 near Chonan, Korea. Private First Class Benge's unit was withdrawing from its position when it was noticed that a vehicle and four wounded soldiers had been left behind. Without regard for his personal safety, Private First Class Benge voluntarily re-entered the area which was under heavy enemy fire and brought the vehicle and four wounded soldiers to safety. Private First Class Benge's display of courage, fortitude and valor reflects the highest possible credit on himself and the military service. General Orders: Headquarters, 24th Infantry Division, General Orders No. 74 (August 7, 1950)\n\nChegay, George\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and Intrepidity while serving as an Automatic Rifleman of Company H, Third Battalion, First Marines, First marine Division (Reinforced), In action against enemy aggressor forces In Korea on 26 July 1953. With his company defending a vital portion of the oak line of resistance while subjected to constant enemy small-arms, mortar and artillery fire, Private First Class Chegay continuous1y exposed himself to the murderous barrage in order to fire on hostile troops forward of his position, accounting for one enemy dead and the probable wounding of two others. Despite the increasing intensity of the enemy mortar and artillery fire, he remained in his position during the approaching hours of darkness to observe enemy activity to his front and, when the leading wave of enemy infantry charged the position, immediately proceeded to deliver intense and accurate fire, thereby warning the remainder of his company of the proximity of the hostile troops. Although his weapon was damaged by a nearby exploding enemy shell, he picked up an abandoned rifle and fearlessly moved into the trench line to engage several of the enemy who had entered the friendly position. Mortally wounded when the immediate area was shattered by an enemy mortar barrage, Private First Class Chegay, by his intrepid fighting spirit, courageous initiative and resolute determination in the face of heavy odds, served to nspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.\n\nKillingsworth, Leo E.\n\nThe Silver Star is awarded posthumously to Private Lee E. Killingsworth, RA18281743, Infantry, Army of the United States. On the morning of 16 July 1950, the Second Platoon, Heavy Mortar Company, 19th Infantry Regiment, was in support of Company C which was subjected to a number of attacks by enemy infantry. After a number of such attacks had been repulsed, the enemy succeeded in flanking the position of Company C and attacked between the rear of that organization and the heavy mortar positions. Since the enemy was inside heavy mortar range, the platoon defended its perimeter position with small arms fire. When the position became untenable, the Platoon Leader gave the order to withdraw. Private Killingsworth, and three other soldiers, although unwounded and perfectly able to withdraw volunteered to remain in the platoon position and hold off the enemy while the rest of the platoon withdrew. During the time the platoon was withdrawing, Private Killingsworth and his companions repulsed two assaults, killing at least nineteen of the enemy. Defying odds of about thirty to one these soldiers enabled the main body of the platoon to withdraw and to take their wounded with them. On the final enemy assault their position was overrun and all were killed. Home Town: Kuse, Oklahoma.\n\nLa Pointe, Walter Batisse\n\nCitation: As Company F attacked Hill 347, Private La Pointe moved ahead of the company line, seeking out and firing on enemy emplacements. Ignoring the intense fire the foe was directing on the area, Private La Pointe displayed superb courage and determination by advancing whenever possible and setting up his weapon in unprotected but commanding positions. He bravely continued in this manner, providing much needed automatic weapons fire for his comrades, until mortally wounded. Private La Pointe's gallantry reflects the highest credit on himself and the military service.\n\nLittlejohn, Charles Jackson\n\nPoolaw, Pascal Cleatus Sr. (2nd award)\n\nHeadquarters, 25th Infantry Division\n\nGeneral Orders No. 413 (November 25, 1950)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Second Award of the Silver Star to Sergeant First Class Pascal Cleatus Poolaw (ASN: 18131087), United States Army, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving with Company C, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. On 19 September 1950 when the company attack on an enemy position was halted by stiff enemy resistance, Sergeant First Class Poolaw volunteered to lead his squad in an assault. Courageously leading his men in a charge up the slope to penetrate the enemy perimeter and engage the numerically superior enemy in fierce hand-to-hand combat, Sergeant First Class Poolaw inspired his men to hold their position until the remainder of the company was able to seize the objective. Sergeant First Class Poolaw's outstanding leadership reflects great credit upon himself and is in keeping with the highest traditions of the American Soldier.\n\nPoolaw, Pascal Cleatus Sr. (3rd award)\n\nHeadquarters, 25th Infantry Division\n\nGeneral Orders No. 306 (May 29, 1951)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting a Second Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Third Award of the Silver Star to Master Sergeant Pascal Cleatus Poolaw (ASN: 18131087), United States Army, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving with Company C, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. On 4 April 1951 near Chongong-ni, Korea, while attacking strong hostile positions, one squad of Master Sergeant Poolaw's platoon was immobilized by a devastating automatic weapons and mortar barrage. Exposing himself to the deadly fire, he slowly advanced across open terrain, firing his rifle as he progressed. By deliberately diverting the attention of the foe to himself, he enabled his men to maneuver to more advantageous positions. Master Sergeant Poolaw's valorous actions were instrumental in the fulfillment of the unit mission and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the American Soldier.\n\nRisingsun, Teddy\n\nThe Silver Star is awarded to Sergeant Teddy Risingsun, RA39940641, Infantry, United States Army, a member of Company F, 23d Infantry Regiment, 2d Infantry Division, who displayed gallantry in action against an armed enemy on 24 May 1951 in the vicinity of Changpong-ni, Korea. Sergeant Risingsun and his squad, as lead elements in an assault on an enemy roadblock, came under intense enemy machine gun and small arms fire. Though wounded in the head by this fire, he refused to be evacuated and continued to urge his men forward. This heroic action inspired his men to renewed efforts, and the enemy force was overrun. The gallant conduct of Sergeant Risingsun reflects great credit upon himself and the military service. Entered the military service from Busby, Big Horn County, Montana. Northern Cheyenne tribe (full blood), Tongue River Reservation.\n\nTall Bear, Alvin\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Sergeant Alvin Tall Bear (MCSN: 666298), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while serving as a Platoon Sergeant of Company F, Second Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea from 28 January to 15 March 1951. With his platoon leader seriously wounded and evacuated to the rear during his company's assault against the regimental objective, a series of cleverly camouflaged enemy positions deeply entrenched on a high hill, Sergeant Tall Bear immediately assumed command and effected a skillful reorganization under blistering small arms and automatic weapons fire. Painfully wounded in the arm as he spearheaded the drive up the steep and treacherous slope, he refused to leave his men and continued to lead them forward until severe pain and loss of blood forced him to submit to evacuation. By his daring initiative, forceful and determined leadership and dauntless fighting spirit in the face of heavy odds, Sergeant Tall Bear served as an inspiration to all who observed him and contributed materially to the successful seizure of the objective. His heroic efforts throughout were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nTessier, Robert W.\n\nHe received a Silver Star during the Korean War.

Private Wilber, assistant squad leader, was advancing up the rugged slopes of the objective. When the rest of his squad was immobilized by the heavy concentration of fire, Private Wilber, exhibiting exceptional courage, moved out to silence the hostile emplacement that was obstructing the advance. Crawling to within grenade range of the enemy bunker, he silenced it with two accurately thrown grenades. Then working his way through a connecting trench, Private Wilber entered a second hostile position and killed its occupants with a Chinese automatic weapon.

Rice, a decorated World War II veteran and Korean War casualty, because of his Native American ancestry. The event provoked public outrage both locally and nationally and eventually required the personal intervention of President Harry Truman. The treatment of Rice tarnished Sioux City's reputation with the stigma of racism and left a wound between the city and local Native American groups for the next fifty years. However, it also created the opportunity for reconciliation between the two sides five decades later and the long overdue redemption of Sergeant Rice and his family.\n\nRice's story had its beginnings on the battlefields of Korea where he was killed on September 6, 1950 while leading a squad of riflemen against an enemy assault near the village of Tabu-Dong. Nearly a year passed before his body was shipped home to Winnebago, Nebraska in August 1951. Thereafter, Evelyn, who was white, purchased a lot for her husband at Memorial Park Cemetery in Sioux City without incident. During the funeral on August 28 a cemetery official noticed the large number of Native Americans at the service and was subsequently informed that Rice was himself part Native American. At the conclusion of the service Evelyn and the rest of the Rice family were informed of the cemetery's \"Caucasians only\" policy and were forced to take his body back to Winnebago. Cemetery officials later defended their actions saying, \"Private cemeteries have always had a right to be operated for a particular group such as Jewish, Catholic, Lutheran, Negro, Chinese, etc., not because of any prejudice against any race, but because people, like animals, prefer to be with their own kind.\" They continued to assert that they had a legal obligation to deny Rice's burial or face prosecution from lot owners for breech of contract.\n\nWhen the local media received word of what had transpired at Memorial Park, the news was quickly put out over the newswire and began making national headlines. Across the country people responded with a combination of disbelief and outrage that an American war hero and his family could be treated in such a fashion. Oliver LaFarge, spokesman for the Association of American Indian Affairs said, \"This is horrible. The manifestation of such an inhuman and anti-American attitude brings disgrace upon our country.\" When President Harry Truman learned about the incident during a press conference the following day he rebuked both the cemetery officials and Sioux City's leaders. He also authorized his military aid Major General Harry Vaughn to send a telegram to Rice's family offering to bury him in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nIn Sioux City the reaction was every bit as negative as it had been on the national level. The Sioux City metropolitan council of the United Packinghouse Workers of America adopted a resolution condemning the actions of the cemetery and declared that the flag should not be flown \"in such an un-American place.\" Though the city council passed a resolution expressing regret for the incident and Mayor Dan Conley traveled to Winnebago and personally apologized at an American Legion meeting there, Evelyn Rice and her family rejected all offers to bury Sergeant Rice locally. He was finally laid to rest with full military honors on September 5, 1951 in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nThe legacy of the Sergeant Rice affair is one of injustice, betrayal, and bitterness, but it is also one of redemption and hope. The event scarred Evelyn Rice and her family permanently and it severely damaged Sioux City's reputation. Yet, despite the damage it caused, Sergeant Rice's ordeal also laid the groundwork for future progress. Memorial Park eventually abolished its race restriction and has been open to all races for years. The incident was a pivotal moment for the Native American civil rights movement because it illuminated the prejudice and injustice faced by Native Americans while emphasizing their positive roll in American society. It also began a process by which the people of Sioux City began to confront the less savory aspects of their past. At a memorial ceremony held in honor of Sergeant Rice and his family in August 2001, Native American rights activist Frank Lamere's read statement spoke poignantly of the Rice affair. He was quoted to have said \"We have come far at the expense of Sergeant John Rice and the Gold Star family he left behind. Our respect for one another this day is their legacy and speaks to the possibilities. The bridges we can build tomorrow will be strong if we do not forget that the foundation was laid on a battlefield in Korea.\"\n\nRickard, N.L.\n\nStaff Sergeant Rickard was born December 09, 1922 in Alabama, the son of Sellers and Myrtie Richard [Rickard].
