        "text": "This week marks the end of my full-time professional career. The last four decades have been an intense and incredible journey. I’ve been lucky to work with so many amazing people, build and scale tech businesses, live and work in the US, Europe, and India, and serve clients in over 25 countries. There have been countless memories made and lessons learned over the years that I’ll carry forward with me. In fact, my best learnings have come from mistakes I made and things that didn’t go well. Those who know me know that I’m totally incapable of switching off entirely – my next chapter will include supporting and sponsoring up and coming leaders, helping build and scale successful businesses, dedicating more of my time towards philanthropy, spending quality time with family, working on my health and wellness, and maybe even learning some new tricks and uncovering new passions. I have traveled almost nonstop for 30 years to many places worldwide including Hachioji, Hangzhou, Monterrey, Rimouski, Wolfsburg, Zoeterwoude, and I still plan to do a little of that in this next chapter! Looking back at my career, nothing was predictable. I started out as a chemical engineer from very humble beginnings, pivoted into tech and built a lot of software, took the leap into consulting, and eventually ended up at a top consulting firm working on incredibly impactful projects for great clients. I got to launch new products, enter new markets, scale technology partnerships, drive profitable growth, and lead businesses. There were never dull moments or boring days! The rest of my life, too, was similarly full of change. Born in India with clubfoot, I had to adapt to adversity right away. My mom and dad endured significant hardship to pay the bills to get me walking and educated. I left home at the age of 15 to head off to college, following new and uncertain paths many times. That took me from Madras to Chidambaram, Bangalore, Bombay, NJ, VA, The Netherlands, MI, MD, VA, California, Hyderabad and back to California. I married my wonderful wife, Vidhya, and we had two daughters – all three of them do their part in keeping me on my toes. As our girls have both gone on to pursue their own adventures, we have been empty nesting between our homes in the East Bay and Monterey Bay, hiking and beach walking. I often get asked for advice, and I’ll share some of the most important lessons I’ve learned here: 1. Be optimistic, confident in yourself and always give 110% 2. Take risks, make mistakes and learn from them 3. Never stop learning, especially from a diverse group - younger and older 4. Embrace change and adapt fast 5. Pay it forward - mentor and sponsor people you believe in, build strong teams 6. Always prioritize personal health and wellness - beginning with mental health Thank you to everyone who has been part of my journey. I’m excited about my next chapter and have begun that by switching from my PC to a MacBook!"
