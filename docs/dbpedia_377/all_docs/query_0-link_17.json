Even so, some top critics noticed that he was producing work as good as John D. MacDonald, Raymond Chandler, Chester Himes, Dashiell Hammett, and Ross MacDonald. Ralph Dennis wrote three other novels that were published outside of the Hardman series —Atlanta, Deadman’s Game and MacTaggart’s War— but he wasn’t able to reach the wide audience, or gain the critical acclaim, that he deserved during his lifetime. He was born in 1931 in Sumter, South Carolina, and received a masters degree from University of North Carolina, where he later taught film and television writing after serving a stint in the Navy. At the time of his death in 1988, he was working at a bookstore in Atlanta and had a file cabinet full of unpublished novels. Brash Books is re-issuing the entire Hardman series, Dennis’ three other published novels, and his long-lost manuscripts.\n\nClose\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nJAMES DICKEY\n\n(1923-1997)\n\nJAMES DICKEY (1923-1997)\n\nJoyce Carol Oates described James Dickey’s perspective as a desire to “to take on his’ own personal history as an analog to or a microscopic exploration of 20th-century American history.” Dickey described his style as “country surrealism.” He flew more than 100 combat missions during World War II. “I came to poetry with no particular qualifications,” he recounted in Howard Nemerov’s Poets on Poetry. “I had begun to suspect, however, that there is a poet—or a kind of poet—buried in every human being like Ariel in his tree, and that the people whom we are pleased to call poets are only those who have felt the need and contrived the means to release this spirit from its prison.” Dickey is the author of Deliverance and more than two dozen volumes of poetry.

Douglas’s nonfiction includes Truth: Four Stories I Am Old Enough to Tell and Witnessing. Following Douglas’s death, Margalit Fox wrote in the New York Times that Douglas’s work “explored the epochal divide between the Old South and the New, examining vast, difficult subjects — race relations, tensions between the sexes, the conflict between the needs of the individual and those of the community — through the small, clear prism of domestic life.”\n\nClose\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nW.E.B.

Du Bois, or William Edward Burghardt Du Bois, was an incredibly prolific African-American writer, as well as a teacher, sociologist, historian, editor, and activist, whose work transformed the way that the lives of black citizens were seen in American society. Considered ahead of his time, Du Bois was an early champion of using data to solve social issues for the black community, and his writing–including his groundbreaking collection of essays The Souls of Black Folk (1903)–became required reading in African American studies. He was the most important black protest leader in the United States during the first half of the 20th century. He shared in the creation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909 and edited The Crisis, its magazine, from 1910 to 1934.

As a boy he sold newspapers on the streets of the city. His formal education was cut short by the Civil War, but he read extensively in the Library of Congress while working as a clerk in the U. S. Treasury. He returned home to Macon in 1874, studied law at Mercer University, and was admitted to the bar, but never actively practiced due to his passion for writing. His first short story, “Elder Brown’s Backslide,” appeared in Harper’s Monthly in 1886. It was a humorous story of a man going to the “big city” of Macon and falling off the wagon after over 20 years of sobriety. Numerous other stories followed. These stories were eventually collected, bound, and published in book form. His first novel, Sons and Fathers, was written in 1895. Another, Marbeau Cousins, was published soon afterwards. Both of these novelswere mysteries and popular for their time. Meanwhile, Edwards had become owner and editor of the Macon Telegraph, where he wrote a regular popular column entitled “What Comes Down My Creek.” Edwards’ most popular work was a story entitled “Eneas Africanus,” which first appeared in the Macon Evening News, of which he was also part owner and co-editor. It was later published as a book and has sold over three million copies. The minting of the 1925 Stone Mountain Half Dollar to pay for the cost of the memorial is mainly attributed to Edwards.

As an apprentice on a weekly paper, The Countryman, he became familiar with the lore and dialects of the plantation slave. He established a reputation as a brilliant humorist and writer of dialect while employed on newspapers at Macon, Ga., New Orleans, Forsyth and Savannah, Ga., and, after 1876, on the staff of the Atlanta Constitution for 24 years. In 1879 “Tar-Baby,” a story probably inspired by his reading of William Owens’ work on black folklore, appeared in the Atlanta Constitution and created a vogue for a distinctive type of dialect literature. This and successive Uncle Remus stories won for Harris a secure place in American literature. The pattern was new: Uncle Remus, the wise, genial old black man, tells stories about Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox, and other animals to the little son of a plantation owner and interweaves his philosophy of the world about him. Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings was published in book form in 1880, followed by others. Included in a series of children’s books were: Little Mr. Thimblefinger and His Queer Country (1894), The Story of Aaron (1896), and Aaron in the Wildwoods (1897). Mingo, and Other Sketches in Black and White (1884); Free Joe and Other Georgian Sketches (1887); Sister Jane, Her Friends and Acquaintances (1896); and Gabriel Tolliver (1902) reveal Harris’ ability to vitalize other Southern types and to delve into issues faced by the South after Reconstruction. On the Plantation (1892) is valuable for its autobiography. From 1907 until his death he edited Uncle Remus’s Magazine.\n\nClose\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nERNEST HARTSOCK\n\n(1903-1930)\n\nERNEST HARTSOCK (1903-1930)\n\nErnest Hartsock (1903-1930) was one of the best-known American poets of the 1920s.

Longstreet’s Georgia Scenes, Characters, Incidents, etc. in the First Half Century of the Republic (1835) was a groundbreaking work that drew the contemporary praise of Edgar Allan Poe for its penetrating understanding of Southern character. A circuit-riding lawyer in Augusta and Greensboro in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, Longstreet drew from his experiences to sketch Georgia Scenes’ crossroads character types with their emerging dialects, manners, and moral conflicts. Fueled by Longstreet’s acute ear for his characters’ speech and his narrative pose of corrective laughter, the nineteen tales made for an immensely popular work that ran through eleven editions between 1835 and 1897. Initially published as individual sketches in various newspapers (including Longstreet’s own Augusta-based States Rights Sentinel), Georgia Scenes opened up a literary gold seam. Later Lanier sold his newspaper and became a Methodist minister and served as president of four universities, including a newly founded Emory College from 1839 to 1848. He wrote numerous political pamphlets but only one other work of fiction, Master William Mitten, a dour moralizing tale which critics have described as Longstreet’s own reaction against the comic popularity of Georgia Scenes. During the Civil War, he wrote articles supporting the Southern cause and served briefly as a chaplain of the Georgia militia. After the war, he retired to Mississippi to live with his granddaughter and died there in 1870.\n\nClose\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nSHARYN MCCRUMB\n\n(1948 - )\n\nSHARYN MCCRUMB (1948 - )\n\nSharyn McCrumb is an award-winning Southern writer, best known for her Appalachian “Ballad” novels, set in the North Carolina/Tennessee mountains, including the New York Times Best Sellers: The Ballad of Tom Dooley, She Walks These Hills and The Rosewood Casket.

In Stomping the Blues (1976), Murray maintained that blues and jazz musical styles developed as affirmative responses to misery; he also explored the cultural significance of these music genres and other artistic genres in The Hero and the Blues (1973), The Blue Devils of Nada (1996), and From the Briarpatch File: On Context, Procedure, and American Identity (2001). Murray also cowrote Count Basie’s autobiography, Good Morning Blues (1985), and was active in the creation of the concert series Jazz at Lincoln Center. In addition, he published Trading Twelves: The Selected Letters of Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray (2000), a poetry collection, and a tetralogy of novels—Train Whistle Guitar (1974), The Spyglass Tree (1991), The Seven League Boots (1995), and The Magic Keys (2005).\n\nClose\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nMARY NOAILLES MURFREE\n\n(1850 - 1922 )\n\nMARY NOAILLES MURFREE (1850 - 1922 )\n\nMary Noailles Murfree, who wrote under the pseudonym Charles Egbert Craddock, was an American writer in the local-colour movement, and most of her stories present the narrow, stern life of the Tennessee mountaineers who were left behind in the advance of civilization. Mary Murfree studied at Chegaray Institute, a French school in Philadelphia, in 1867–69. With the failure of her father’s business in 1869 the family returned to their native Murfreesboro, Tennessee. There Murfree began writing stories. Her first publication was in 1874 when one of her stories appeared in Lippincott’s Magazine under the name “R. Emmet Dembry.” A story in The Atlantic Monthly in 1878 appeared under the name “Charles Egbert Craddock,” which she used thereafter. Murfree’s first book, In the Tennessee Mountains (1884), collects several of her stories from the Atlantic. Where the Battle Was Fought (1884), her first novel, was followed by In the Clouds (1886), The Despot of Broomsedge Cove (1889), In the “Stranger People’s” Country (1891), His Vanished Star (1894), The Juggler (1897), and The Young Mountaineers (1897), among others. The revelation in 1885 of Charles Craddock’s true identity added greatly to Murfree’s celebrity and to interest in her writing. Murfree’s later works are mostly historical fictions.\n\nClose\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nLEWIS NORDAN\n\n(1939 - 2012 )\n\nLEWIS NORDAN (1939 - 2012 )\n\nLewis Nordan was born on August 23, 1939, in Forest, Mississippi, but he grew up in Itta Bena, Mississippi.

It was 1966, during her senior year at Hollins, that Smith’s literary career began to take off. She submitted an early draft of a coming-of-age novel to a Book-of-the-Month Club contest and was awarded one of twelve fellowships. Two years later, that novel, The Last Day the Dog Bushes Bloomed (1968), became Smith’s first published work of fiction. By 1971, though, she’d completed her second novel, Something in the Wind, which garnered generally favorable reviews. But her next novel, Fancy Strut (1973), was widely praised by critics as a comic masterpiece. In 1974 Smith finished Black Mountain Breakdown (1981), a much darker work than her readers had come to expect. Because of that, and despite her earlier successes, it took Smith five years to find a publisher for her next novel. She turned her attention to short stories, for which she won O. Henry Awards in 1978 and 1980, and then published Cakewalk (1981), her first collection of stories. In 1983 her fifth novel, Oral History, became a Book-of-the-Month Club featured selection, exposing Smith for the first time to a wide national audience. Her other books include Family Linen (1985), Fair and Tender Ladies (1988), Me and My Baby View the Eclipse (1990)—her second book of short stories, The Devil’s Dream (1992), Saving Grace (1995), and a novella The Christmas Letters (1996). News of the Spirit, a collection of stories and novellas was published in 1997. Smith reached a wider audience with New York Times bestseller The Last Girls (2002).

STRIBLING\n\n(1881 - 1965)\n\nT.S. STRIBLING (1881 - 1965)\n\nThomas Sigismund Stribling was the author of sixteen books, a multitude of articles, and is best known for his novel trilogy that explored political and social injustices, and included The Store, winner of the 1933 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Stribling was born on March 4, 1881, in Clifton, and during the summers spent time with his grandparents on a Lauderdale County, Alabama, family farm, the setting of many of his stories. After graduating high school, he attended Florence Normal School—now known as the University of North Alabama. He became a lawyer and subsequently left that career to move home to Tennessee. He began a life as an author of odd consequence. He wrote for the Chattanooga News, Sunday School magazines, and a popular pulp magazine of the day. He later wrote a column for The Campfire magazine. Stribling began to write novels, beginning with Cruise of the Dry Dock in 1917, and Birthright in 1922, which was eventually made into a feature film. He published East is East in 1922. The novel Fombombo was released in 1923, followed by Red Sand the following year. His readers wanted more. Teeftalow was published in 1926, became a bestseller, and was adapted as the Broadway play, Rope. He published another novel Backwater, in 1930, and then began his most famous trilogy, which included The Forge (1930), The Store (1932), and Unfinished Cathedral (1934). The trilogy was considered by some as unthinkable stories of the South during a time period in which slavery and cotton were as common as trading mules for land. After the successful trilogy, Stribling penned two more novels, Sound Wagon in 1935, and These Bars of Flesh in 1938. Stribling continue writing, traveling, and teaching until he died at age 84. He was the best-selling author of his time, and his trilogy alone sold more than 240,000 copies.\n\nClose\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nELLA GERTRUDE CLANTON THOMAS\n\n(1834-1907)\n\nELLA GERTRUDE CLANTON THOMAS (1834-1907)\n\nElla Gertrude Clanton Thomas (1834-1907) the daughter and wife of Augusta planters, is best known for the extensive journal she kept of her life before, during, and after the Civil War.
