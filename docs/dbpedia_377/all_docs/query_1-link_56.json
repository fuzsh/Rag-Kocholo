The Parties also agreed to file the\n\nwritten pleadings within a tight time-limit of originally four and later four and a half\n\nmonths.\n\nOn 20 June 2003, Mexico filed its Memorial. In accord with Practice Direction\n\nIII, in which the Court \"strongly urge[d] parties to append to their pleadings only strictly\n\nBurgemee ~atnaan 1930.25~5CB The Hague. ;\\letherlanùs.

In that statement, Ambassador\n\nRodriguez set forth the essential facts with regard to each of the fifty-four cases. He\n\nbased his declaration on the extensive documentation gathered by Mexican consular\n\nofficiaisin the United States, as weil as interviews conducted by Mexican consular\n\nofficiais and lawyers working for the Mexican capital assistance program. 2 Mexico also\n\nsubmitted six other declarations and a number of additional documents, which, although\n\nstrictly limited and carefully selected,cover more than 1100 pages in three volumes of\n\nAnnexes. On filing its Memorial, Mexico advised the Court that it was \"prepared to\n\nsubmit to the Court any of the documents cited to in the Memorial and the expert 3nd\n\nwitnessdeclarations contained in the Annexes to the Memorial, if so requested.\"\n\nHad Mexico submitted a full documentary record for each of the fifty-four\n\nnationals, in arder to anticipate any possible factual allegations by the United States,\n\nMexico would have submitted dozens of volumes of annexes, consisting of many\n\nthousands of pages of documentation gathered and produced by Mexico's forty-five\n\nconsular offices in the United States, including voluminous excerpts from consular files,\n\ncourt transcripts, excerpts from legal briefs, and excerpts from habeas corpus\n\nproceedings. The magnitude of this submission would have placed an enormous burden\n\non the Members of the Court, who would have studied the record, and on the staff and\n\nbudget of the Court's Registry, which would have had to provide the Court with\n\n4\n\ntranslations.\n\n1The Court issued Practice Direction III in order to address \"an excessive tendency towards the\n\nproliferation and protractionnnexes to written pleadings.\"\n\n2See also Mexico's Memorial, Declaration of Ambassador Rodriguez Hernandez, Annex 7, at para. 40.\n\n3\n\nLetter dated 20 June 2003 of the Agent of Mexico to the Registrar of the International Court of Justice.\n\n4\n\nThe United States itselfacknowledges the enormity ofthe full factual record of the 54 cases.

In\n\nMexico's view, the evidence included with its Memorial fully suffices to prove the facts\n\non which this Court's Judgment should rest. However, unlike in the case concerning the\n\nVienna Convention on Consular Relations (Paraguay v. United States of Germany) and\n\nin LaGrand (Germany v. United States of America), the United States has chosen not to\n\nconcede the violations that, in many of the underlying cases, have already been conceded\n\nor determined in courts in the United States and, in the remainder, should not be subject\n\nto serious dispute. Given the United States' position here, Mexico seeks leave to submit\n\nthe enclosed documents in order to eliminate any possible doubt about the basic facts of\n\nthe case before this Court.\n\nIn order to comply with Practice Direction Ill, Mexico has again carefully limited\n\nits submission so as to minimize any burden on the Court. Given the short period of time\n\nbetween the filing of the Counter-Memorial by the United States on 3 November 2003,\n\nand the opening of the hearings on 15 December 2003, Mexico has also made its best\n\nefforts to produce these documents as expeditiously as possible, in order to allow the\n\nUnited States sufficient time to review them. In addition, on Wednesday, 26 November\n\n2003, consistent with the courtesies that the Parties have extended one another, Mexico\n\nprovided a copy of these documents directly to the United States so as to avoid any\n\npossible delay.\n\ntranscripts and, except in cases in which the fust stage of appeal is still pending, hundreds of pages of\n\nlegal briefs and memoranda.\" Indeed, though the United States has had Mexico's Application since\n\nearly January, it advises the Court that even on the datee filing of the Counter-Memorial, sorne\n\nten months later, its investigation of the underlying cases was stiJl \"ongoing.\" U.S. Counter­\n\nMemorial, Chapter VII,'I7.1.\n\n5\n\nU.S. Counter-Memorial, Chapter VII, pp. 147 et seq.\n\n21618869v5\n\nBurgemeester Patijnlaan 1930. 25H5 CB The Hague.

Nationality. Mexico established the nationality of each of the fifty-four\n\nnationals in the Declaration of Ambassador Rodriguez. The General Division of\n\nProtection and Consular Affairs supervises the network of Mexican consulates and the\n\nconsular services they provide. One of the primary functions of the consulates, in turn, is\n\nto confirm and document the nationality of Mexican nationals within their respective\n\njurisdictions for a variety of purposes, such as the issuance of ID cards and passports,\n\narrangements in case of death, and notification pursuant to Article 36 of the Vienna\n\nConvention. The Declaration of Ambassador Rodriguez therefore provides sufficient and\n\nconclusive evidence of the Mexican nationality of each of the fifty-four individuals.\n\na. Mexico 'saffirmative proof The United States contends, however, that Mexico\n\nhas failed to prove the Mexican nationality of the individuals narned in the Application.\n\nU.S. Counter-Memorial, para. 7.7. Since the United States has contested the adequacy of\n\nthe showing, Mexico seeks leave to submit (a) the birth certificates of, with one\n\nexception, 6 each of the individuals narned in its Application; (b) declarations, from each\n\nof the 41 Mexican nationals as to which there is no record of a judicial finding of an\n\nArticle 36 violation from a United States court or a stipulation of such a violation, that\n\nthey have not acquired U.S. nationality; 7 and (c) certain additional documents\n\nestablishing Mexican nationality. These documents are attached as Annexes 67, 70 and\n\n68, respectively.\n\nb. US. defense of dual nationa/ity. The United States alleges that there is a\n\n\"substantial possibility\" that sorne Mexican nationals \"were also United States citizens at\n\nthe time oftheir arrests.\" U.S. Counter-Memorial, para. 7.8. The United States does not\n\nadduce a single document to support this allegation. Indeed, even though in the United\n\nStates immigration and naturalization are the province of the federal government, the\n\nUnited States concedes that it cannot \"confmn[]\" its allegation. Id.\n\n6 In the time available, Mexico was unable to obtain the birth certificate of Abelino Manriquez Jaquez\n\n(# 14). For his nationality, which the United States does not appear to seriously contest (see U.S.\n\nCounter-Memorial, Annex 2, A 131), Mexico rests on the Rodriguez Declaration.\n\n7 Because Mexican nationality would constitute a predicate to an Article 36 violation premised on failure to\n\nnotify the Mexican consul, a finding or concession of a violation would also constitute a finding or\n\nconcession ofMexican nationality.\n\n8\n\nSee also id. n. 334 (suggesting that parent ofspecific national is \"likely [a] United States citizen\" and that\n\nthere is \"sorne possibility\" that certain nationals acquired U.S. citizenship).\n\n21618869v5\n\nBurgemeesterPatijnlaa1930. ~5HC5B The: Hague.

Temple of Preah Vihear, Merits,\n\nJudgment, LC.J. Reports 1962, p.6, 16-16 (\"burden of proof ... will of course lie on the\n\nparty asserting or putting\" forward claim on series of facts or contentions); Minquiers\n\nand Ecrehos, Judgment, LC.J. Reports 1953, p.47 (\"each Party has to prove ... the facts\n\nupon which it relies\"); Mavrommatis Jerusalem Concessions, 1925, P.C.LJ., Series A,\n\nNo. 5, p.29 (respondent alleging that concessions were not valid had burden to prove\n\ninvalidity). Renee, the United States bears the burden of proving that any specifie\n\nindividual named in the Application had U.S. nationality in addition to Mexican\n\nnationality. If it cannot do so, it should not make the allegation.\n\nThat point carries special force here, because it is the United States- not Mexico\n\n- that possesses the necessary information to establish whether an individual has United\n\n9\n\nStates citizenship. As the United States acknowledges, the INS keeps extensive record\n\n10\n\nfiles(\"A files\") for all naturalized citizens. The United States should therefore be able\n\nto provide documents demonstrating U.S. citizenship if, in fact, any of the Mexican\n\n11\n\nnationals had acquired it. It has not, and it therefore should not be permitted to contest\n\nMexico's showing.\n\nAgain, however, in order to eliminate any conceivable doubt, Mexico seeks leave\n\nto submit the declaration of Karen F. Ellingson, Esq. Ms. Ellingson is an attorney\n\nspecializing in immigration law and serves as an Adjunct Professer at the Immigration\n\nClinic of the University of Minnesota School of Law. ln her declaration, Ms. Ellingson\n\nconcludes that, based on the lack of any apparent documentation regarding U.S.\n\nnationality, the highly rigorous requirements for acquiring U.S. nationality, and the\n\nknown facts regarding the nationals' parentage and date ofentry into the United States, it\n\n9See U.S. Counter-Memorial, Declaration ofD. Gentile, Annex 19. See also id., Declaration ofE.A.\n\nBetancourt, Annex 18, para. 7.\n\n10The United States suggests that Mexican nationals may have acquired U.S. citizenship either because one\n\noftheir parents may have been a U.S. citizen or because they moved as minors to the United States. It\n\ndoes not deny, however, that in either case the Mexican national would have received U.S. nationality\n\nby means of a forma! process of naturalization.\n\n11\n\nThe only case in which the United States has provided proof of U.S. nationality is that ofMr. Enrique\n\nZambrano (#28). Having considered that proof, Mexico is satisfied that Mr. Zambrano possesses U.S.\n\nnationality, and consequently, by a letter dated this date to the Registry, has advised the Court that it\n\namends its submissions to withdraw its request for relief in his case.\n\n2161BB69v5\n\nBurgemeester Patijnlaan 1930. 2585 CB The Hague. :'>letherl<mds.Phones: t.'l-70) 3602900 tG<!neral and Consular .\\tïairs 1:\n\n~··-··\"-n,,.•· ·-·.\\ ....•.\"l-1.:;.'1.t:::.....l.n·.,;t:=·•vt~l_ï()\\~C\\f\\1\\'1.l~·\"n~r:1:l) \"'fli76XX1rt)n...1.1hr\\EMBAJADA DE MÉXICO\n\nis highly unlikely that any of the Mexican nationals subject of the Application have\n\nacquired United States citizenship. She also observes that, where, as here, a claim of\n\nU.S. citizenship for a person born abroad is at issue, documentation of naturalization\n\nwould be normally available from United States immigration records and under the\n\nexclusive control of the United States. Ms. Ellingson's declaration is attachedas Annex\n\n69.\n\n2. Article 36 violations. Mexico established the Article 36 violations by the\n\nevidence subrnitted with its Memorial. First, in ten cases, U.S. courts havefoundthat the\n\nUnited States violated Article 36(1)(b). Mexico included extracts from the relevant\n\ndecisions as Annexes to its Memoria1. 12\n\nSecond, in an eleventh case, the United States entered into a stipulation\n\nacknowledging that it violated Article 36(1)(b). Mexico submitted the stipulationas an\n\n13\n\nAnnex toits Memorial.\n\nFinal/y, Ambassador Rodriguez testified in his declaration as to the violation of\n\nArticle 36(1)(b) in the case of, with one exception, each of the fifty-four Mexican\n\n14\n\nnationals. He based this testimony on interviewswith the fifty-four Mexicannationals,\n\n12 Jmirez Suarez (#10), Mexico's Memorial, Annex 36, at A706; see also A62, para. 54; Eduardo Vargas\n\n(#26), Annex 35, at A699; see also A81, para. 139; Hemândez Llanas (#34), Annex 50 at Al037;\n\nsee also at A94, para. 200; Sanchez Ramirez (#23), Annex 64, at A1325; see also at A77, para. 121;\n\nIgnacio G6mez (#33), Annex 61, at Al297; see also at A93, para. 195; FélixRocha Diaz (#42),\n\nAnnex 41, at A764; see also at AllO, para. 271; Ramiro Ibarra (#35), Annex 62, at A1306; see a/so\n\nA96, para. 210; Humberto Leal Garcia (#36), Annexes 51-52, at A1072 and A1156; see a/so at A98,\n\npara. 218; Virgilio Maldonado (#37), Annex 53, at All83; see also at A98, para. 226; and José\n\nTrinidad Loza (#52), Annex 44, at A868; see a/so at Al31, para. 348.

Since the United States has contested the sufficiency of the\n\nshowing, Mexico seeks leave to submit a declaration demonstrating the violation from\n\neach of the 41 individuals subject of the Application as to which the record does not\n\ninclude a judicial finding or stipulation of the violation. 15 The declarations are attached\n\nas Annex 70.\n\n3. Messrs. Miranda Guerrero and Agui/ar Saucedo.\n\nBy letter dated 14 October 2003, Mexico informed the Court that it amended its\n\nsubmissions to include two additional Mexican nationals, Messrs. Miranda Guerrero and\n\nAguilar Saucedo, who, since the date of Mexico's Memorial, had been sentenced to death\n\nas a result of criminal proceedings in which the United States failed to comply with its\n\nobligations under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. By letter dated 2 November\n\n2003, the United States objected that \"Mexico has submitted no evidence conceming\n\nthese cases, and in the available time the United States has been unable to investigate the\n\nfacts alleged.\"\n\nThere is no basis for the United States' objection. In the case of Mr. Miranda\n\nGuerrero (#55), U.S. authorities entered into a stipulation acknowledging the violation of\n\nArticle 36(l)(b). In the case of Mr. Aguilar Saucedo (#56), a U.S. court found that\n\nArticle 36(l)(b) had been violated.\n\nThe documents constituting the stipulation and the finding are not only in the\n\npossession of the United States, but are publicly available. 16 Given the United States'\n\n15\n\nIn addition, Mexico submits a declaration by Mr. Virgilio Maldonado (#37), although there is ajudicial\n\nfinding asto the violation of Article 36(l)(b) of the Vienna Convention.\n\n21618869v5\n\nBurgemeester P:nijnlaan 1930. :::585CB The Hague. :-.letherlanus.

While Practice Direction IX\n\nstates that documents will be admitted after the close of the written submissions only in\n\n\"exceptional circumstances,\" the Direction also confirms that the Court will admit\n\ndocuments at this stage if the production \"appears justified to the Court.\" In the\n\ncircumstances here, the production of the documents Mexico seeks leave to submit is\n\nfullyjustified.\n\nFirst, where, as here, the proceeding is limited to one round of pleadings, an\n\napplicant will be denied its right fully to present its case unless it has the opportunity to\n\nsubmit additional documents in response to new factual allegations by the respondent or\n\nan allegationthat the factual showing made is insufficient. In a proceeding consisting of\n\ntwo rounds of written pleadings, the applicant is entitled under Article 50 of the Rules to\n\nsubmit additional evidence to rebut allegations raised in the respondent's counter­\n\nmemorial. Where, however, proceedings consist of only one round of written pleadings,\n\nthe applicant would be deprived of this right unless the Court permitted it to submit\n\nselecteddocuments pursuant to Article 56.\n\nNo applicant can anticipate the precise arguments that a respondent will make.\n\nThe Court has indicated that \"a single round of written pleadings is to be considered as\n\nthe norm in cases begun by means of an application.\" 17 If the Court wishes future\n\napplicants to agree to a single round, it should not discourage future applicants from\n\ndoing so by denying Mexico leave here to submit a limited set of additional documents.\n\nConsiderations of fairness dictate that result in any event.\n\n16The judicial finding of a violation of Article 36(l)(b) with regard to Mr. Aguilar Saucedo (#56) is\n\navailable at <http://www.courtminutes.Maricopa.gov/docs/Criminal/022003/m0903660.pdt&…;\n\n.

In\n\nsubmitting its Memorial, Mexico took that requestseriously. Now that the United States\n\nhas tried to turn that approach to Mexico's disadvantage by challenging the adequacy of\n\nMexico's showing, Mexico should be granted leave to submit additional documents on\n\nmatters that should not be subject to fair dispute.\n\nAgain, in formulating its submissions, no applicant can anticipate the precise\n\narguments that a respondent will make. A decisiondenying an applicant the opportunity\n\nto submit additional documents to refute a challenge by the respondent to the\n\ndocumentary record would encourage future applicants liberally to append\n\ndocumentation to written pleadings in order to preempt any conceivable future\n\nevidentiary challenge. The Court recognized the potential for tension between its request\n\nthat the parties limit their annexes and a party's interest in protecting against evidentiary\n\nchallenges when, in its 1998 Note containing Recommendations to the Parties, it stated\n\nthat, in order to ease the parties' task in strictly selecting documents during the written\n\nproceedings, it would \"more readily accept the production of additional documents\n\nduring the period beginning with the close of the written proceedings.\" Again, therefore,\n\nif the Court wishes future applïcants, and particularlythose with the benefit of only one\n\nround of briefing, to exercise discipline in putting together their annexes, the Court\n\nshould grant Mexico leave in the circumstances here.\n\nThird, Mexico has agreed to conduct thisproceeding on a timetable whose brevity\n\n19\n\nis unprecedented. To be sure, as the Court observed,that schedule was \"in the interest\n\n18\n\nIn addition to Practice Direction III, see the Note containing Recornmendations to the Parties to New\n\nCases, issued for the first time in 1998 (The Court ·'stronglyurges parties to append to their pleadings\n\nonly strictly selectedcuments\"); l.C.J. Press Re/ease 98/14 (\"With regard to the written\n\nproceedings in general, the Court has asked the Parties to see to it that the content of memorials is\n\nclear and that the annexes are more strictly selected\"); Address by the President of the International\n\nCourt of Justice to the General Assembly of the United Nations , 27 October 1998 (the Court \"has\n\nasked parties to cases to attach only strictly needed annexes to their pleadings\"); Address by the\n\nPresident of the International Court of Justice to the General Assembly of the United Nations, 30\n\nOctober 2001 (the Court \"has again informed [the parties] of its desire to see a decrease ... in the\n\nvolume of annexes to pleadings ... However, old habits die hard\"); Address by the President of the\n\nInternational Court of Justice to the General Assembly of the United Nations, 29 October 2002 (the\n\nCourt asks parties \"to be rigorously selective in the documents which they append to their\n\np1eadings\").\n\n19\n\nFor example, in LaGrand (Germany v. United States of America), which arose from a single case\n\ninvolving only two individuals, the parties had six and a halfmonths to prepare their written\n\npleadings.\n\n21618869v5\n\nBurgemeester Patijnlaan 1930. 25X5CB The H<lgue.Netherbnds.

Given its interest in\n\navoiding an irreparable prejudice, Mexico has fully cooperated with the Court's objective\n\nof expedition.\n\nCombined with the single round of pleadings, the expedited timetable necessarily\n\nhad a greater impact on Mexico as applicant than the United States as respondent. While\n\nMexico had only four and a half months to put together its submissions, the United\n\nStates, with full access to the records in the underlying capital proceedings through state\n\nauthorities, had twice as long. ·\n\nWhere parties agree to time-limits such as those here in order to expedite the\n\nproceedings, general considerations of fairness counsel in favor of permitting an\n\napplicant to submit additional documents pursuant to Article 56. Yet again, a decision\n\ndenying Mexico leave here would discourage parties from agreeing to such time-limits in\n\nfuture proceedings before the Court.\n\nFinal/y, the nature of this case, more than any other case, counsels in favor of\n\ngranting leave. Where, as here, human lives are at stake, the Court should ensure that it\n\nbases its decision on a full and fair evidentiary record.\n\n* * *\n\nMay I take this opportunity to provide you the assurance of my highest esteem.\n\nAmbassador Santiago Oiiate Laborde\n\nAgent of Mexico\n\n20\n\nAvena and Other Mexican Nationa/s (Mexico v.
