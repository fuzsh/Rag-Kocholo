        "text": "Co-founded in 1944 by the late Mary Day and Lisa Gardiner, The Washington School of Ballet (TWSB) is recognized nationally and internationally for its classical training and dedication to excellence in dance and dance education. TWSB provides a safe, nurturing environment enabling each student to explore their technical and artistic capabilities. Our mission is to inspire the next generation of young dancers to grow and expand to their full potential and to keep our community dancing.\n\nThe school trains more than 900 enrolled students each year at its Northwest Campus studios on Wisconsin Avenue and an additional 350 enrolled students at its Southeast Campus housed at The Town Hall Education, Arts and Recreation Center (THEARC). More than 1600 adult students attend classes through TWSB’s Open Class programs which are held at both campuses.\n\nAnnually, TWSB disburses over $400,000 in merit scholarships and tuition assistance. These awards allow TWSB to provide access to the highest level of training for students of many backgrounds, often opening the door to families who might not otherwise be able to pursue training. Through financial assistance, merit-based recognition, and personalized faculty guidance, we strive to support equitable opportunities in ballet from registration to graduation.\n\nThe Washington Ballet has contributed to the cultural fabric and artistic dynamic of the nation’s capital; evolving from a small ballet school in northwest DC neighborhood to a world-class, internationally recognized professional ballet company. The Washington School of Ballet and its community engagement programs continue to provide dance instruction and education to DC and area residents, to introduce thousands of children to the magic and beauty of dance through performances of The Nutcracker and other company repertoire at world-renowned theaters including The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nHISTORY\n\nIt all started in 1944 when dance pioneer Mary Day and her former teacher Lisa Gardiner founded The Washington School of Ballet. The acclaimed school quickly became known for its outstanding training and later attracted students who would become world-famous dancers; including Amanda McKerrow, who in 1982 at age 17, became the first American to win the Gold Medal at the prestigious Moscow Ballet Competition and Kevin McKenzie, who became a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre and in 1992 was named that company’s artistic director. Virginia Johnson, who began her dance training at The Washington School of Ballet had a 40-year career and is now the artistic director of Dance Theatre of Harlem. Other notable alumni include Chelsea Clinton and actresses Shirley MacLaine and the late Georgia Engel.\n\nIn 1976, Mary Day founded The Washington Ballet as a professional company in part to provide performance opportunities for its many talented students. In 1999, Septime Webre took the helm as artistic director and established community outreach programs DanceDC, the EXCEL! Scholarship program, and The Washington Ballet’s southeast campus at THEARC. During his 17-year tenure, the company and the school realized tremendous growth and community support. Webre developed several famous literary works into full-length ballets including, The Great Gatsby, ALICE (in wonderland), and The Nutcracker. In the Fall of 2007, Kee Juan Han joined TWB as school director of The Washington School of Ballet.\n\nIn July 2016, Julie Kent became artistic director of The Washington Ballet, bringing with her Xiomara Reyes as Head of School for The Washington Ballet.\n\nKent enjoyed a stellar 30-year career at American Ballet Theatre and remains the longest-serving ballerina in the company’s 80-year history. She began her dance training with Hortensia Fonseca at the Academy of the Maryland Youth Ballet in Bethesda, MD and attended summer sessions at American Ballet Theatre II and the School of American Ballet before joining American Ballet Theatre as an apprentice in 1985. In that same year, Kent won first place in the regional finals of the National Society of Arts and Letters at the Kennedy Center. In 1986, she was the only American to win a medal at the Prix de Lausanne International Ballet Competition, and she became a member of American Ballet Theatre’s corps de ballet.\n\nKent starred in the Herbert Ross film ‘Dancers’ in 1987 opposite Mikhail Baryshnikov. She was appointed Soloist with American Ballet Theatre in 1990 and Principal Dancer in 1993, the year she won the Erik Bruhn Prize in Toronto and was named one of People Magazine’s “50 Most Beautiful People.” In April 2000, Kent became the first American woman ever to win the prestigious “Prix Benois de la Danse.” Later that year, Kent starred in the motion picture ‘Center Stage’ directed by Nicolas Hytner. In 2012, she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of North Carolina School for the Arts as well as a “Lifetime Achievement Award” from Dance Magazine.\n\nPRESENT\n\nIn 2023, American arts leader and acclaimed choreographer Edwaard Liang became the new Artistic Director of The Washington Ballet. He is only the fourth person, and first person of color, to lead the organization. He is also the first Asian American to lead a major American ballet company.\n\nOver the past 20 years, Liang’s works have been performed by dance companies worldwide, including New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, Bolshoi Ballet, Joffrey Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, Shanghai Ballet, and The Washington Ballet, among others. In 2017, he received an Emmy® Award for his short dance film, “Vaulted.” In 2018, he created a new ballet with Roberto Bolle for the opening of the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nLearn more about Edwaard Liang here.\n\nIn 2024, Trinidad Vives was announced as the School Director for The Washington School of Ballet. Ms. Vives had served as TWB’s Acting Artistic Director during the fall of 2023.\n\nTrinidad Vives was born in Madrid, Spain, and trained under prominent instructors before continuing her studies in Paris. She graduated from the Ecole Supérieure de Danse de Cannes Rosella Hightower and joined the Hamburg Ballet as a Soloist at 17. She later became a Principal dancer with the Basel Ballet, Düsseldorf Ballet, and English National Ballet, performing leading roles in both classical and contemporary works.\n\nTrinidad transitioned into teaching and leadership after earning her diploma from the Royal Conservatory of Dance in Madrid. She rose to Co-Artistic Director at the Houston Ballet Academy and served as Artistic Associate of Boston Ballet. She has also been the Rehearsal Director at the Compañía Nacional de Danza in Madrid and co-founded The Brookline Ballet School in Boston. As the Director of The Washington School of Ballet, Trinidad brings her extensive experience and passion for developing young dancers."
