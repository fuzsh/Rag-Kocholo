        "text": "Bounce Salute to Historically Black Colleges and Universities\n\nFor 2024, Bounce will honor the legacy and still unfolding story of Historically Black Colleges and Universities - otherwise known as HBCUs. These schools, most created at a time when our nation was forcefully separated by race, have arguably done more than any other American institution to make our society more equal. Not just places of higher learning, HBCUs are incubators of Black culture – preserving who we were, informing who we are, and shining a light on where we can go. Join us as we stomp the yard year all, discovering (and rediscovering) these uniquely American and proudly Black institutions.\n\nMap & School Listing | About HBCU | The Divine 9 | Notable Alumni | Milestones & Facts\n\nFacts\n\nHBCUs:\n\nAlabama has the most HBCUs, with a total of 14.\n\nIn 1837, the first HBCU was established by Richard Humphreys as the African Institute in Pennsylvania (now known as Cheyney University).\n\nIn 1856, the first HBCU founded by African Americans, Wilberforce University, was established by The African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nIn 1867, two years after the Emancipation Proclamation, nine HBCUs were established: Alabama State University, Barber-Scotia College, Fayetteville State University, Howard University, Johnson C. Smith University, Morehouse College, Morgan State University, Saint Augustine’s University, and Talladega College.\n\nDivine 9:\n\nThe first Divine 9 fraternity founded was Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., established in 1906.\n\nThe first Divine 9 sorority founded was Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., established in 1908.\n\nFive out of nine of the Divine 9 were founded at Howard University (Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.).\n\nThe National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) was founded at Howard University on May 10, 1930.\n\nIn 1995, the first international chapter of the NPHC was formed in Nassau, Bahamas."
