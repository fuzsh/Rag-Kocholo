Keira Knightley has said she is pleased that Love Actually has become a holiday classic.

Richard Curtis's 2003 film starred Knightley, Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy and Emma Thompson as people trying to find love and happiness during the festive season.

Knightley told The Huffington Post that she enjoys being a part of a holiday tradition for lovers of the movie.

"It's amazing that it turned that kind of Christmas movie, isn't it? I don't think anyone realised it was going to do that," she recalled.

The actress continued: "It's an extraordinary thing when people come up and go, 'Oh, you know, that's the thing I watch every Christmas'. It's a lovely thing. That's why you make them."

Universal Pictures president Eddie Cunningham announced earlier this year that the studio would like Curtis to make a sequel to Love Actually, but it's not yet clear if the project is in the works.

Love Actually made more than $245 million at the global box office on its original release.
