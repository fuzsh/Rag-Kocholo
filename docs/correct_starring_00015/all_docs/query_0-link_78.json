        "text": "Taking the ensemble romantic comedy just about as far as it can go, Love Actually (which is directed and also written by Four Weddings and a Funeral scribe Curtis) spins a merry skein of loves lost and found amid the bustle of holiday-season London. Itâs such a lengthy skein that you wish Curtis, in his directing debut, would have scaled back a bit on the interlocking stories â there are more hearts on sleeves here than there are Labour Party regulars fed up with Tony Blairâs doggedly pro-Bush Iraq policy. Briefly, if such a thing is possible, the film revolves around a prime minister (Grant) who falls for his secretary (McCutcheon), a widower (Neeson) and his adolescent son (Thomas Sangster) who struggle to survive their grief, a company executive (Rickman) who falls for a sexy employee (Makatsch) while ignoring his wife (Thompson), and another employee in the same firm who tries to land her not-so-obscure object of affection (Rodrigo Santoro). Thereâs also a newlywed (Knightley) who is pursued by her husbandâs best friend (Andrew Lincoln), a novelist in the South of France whoâs after his Portuguese maid (Moniz), and the great Bill Nighy as an endearingly ridiculous and post-prime rock star out to milk one last hit from a novelty Christmas tune.\n\nAnd thereâs probably more going on, too, but after all that, it gets a bit blurry.\n\nI seem to recall Billy Bob Thornton as a libidinous and Bush-like American president who gets a proper dressing down from Grantâs prime minister (to cheers, I might add, from the one Brit in the audience in the screening I attended), but once again, there are so many plotlines tangling and untangling in Love Actually that itâs all a bit much."
