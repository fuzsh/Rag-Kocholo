        "text": "The mews house in which Keira Knightley's character lives in Christmas classic Love Actually is up for sale.\n\nDirected by Richard Curtis, the film's interweaving story arcs explore all the cheer (and heartbreak) that the Christmas season in London brings.\n\nOne of the movie's most instantly recognisable (and divisive) scenes takes place when Juliet (Keira Knightley) – who marries Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) earlier in the film – opens the door of the couple's home to find Peter's best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) outside, confessing his love for her via written cards.\n\nAnd now, the mews house used for those exterior scenes is up for sale.\n\nRelated: Love Actually casting director reveals the actor she'd replace if film was made today\n\nThe three-bedroom, pastel green property in Notting Hill is on the market for a guide price of £2.75 million.\n\nJack Thomas, sales manager in estate agent Knight Frank's Notting Hill office, told the London Evening Standard: \"Properties on this mews are always in high demand and this pastel green exterior epitomises the colourful aesthetic charm of St Luke's Mews, now world renowned due to its cameo in the Christmas film Love Actually.\n\n\"This newly refurbished mews home has been meticulously redesigned to feature elegant, open plan living spaces which seamlessly blend with its outside space of both garden and south facing roof terrace.\"\n\nRelated: Love Actually's Richard Curtis reveals real reason for Hugh Grant costume error\n\nThe house is set over four storeys, and has its own garage and rooftop terrace.\n\nMark and Juliet's scene in Love Actually has sparked debate over the years about his behaviour. Andrew Lincoln, who played Mark, told Entertainment Weekly back in 2017: \"In one of the most romantic movies of all time, I got to play the only guy who doesn't get the girl.\n\n\"The story is set up like a prism looking at all the different qualities of love. Mine was unrequited. So I got to be this weird stalker guy... I kept saying to Richard [Curtis], 'Are you sure I'm not going to come off as a creepy stalker?'\"\n\nHowever, speaking to Digital Spy in 2020, Martine McCutcheon defended the scene.\n\n\"I don't think it's creepy at all,\" said McCutcheon, who played Natalie in the movie. \"I think people do crazy things when they are in love with people.\n\n\"He had his moment where he thought, 'Enough now, I've told her how I feel, I love my friend too but I had to get it off my chest in the right way'.\n\n\"She'd already seen the video, and I think it was his way of making things explained and comfortable.\"\n\nThe film, which received a cinema re-release for its 20th anniversary, also had its lack of diversity recently acknowledged by Curtis.\n\n\"There are things that you would change, but thank God society is changing,\" he said during a TV special looking back on the movie.\n\n\"My film is bound in some moments to feel out of date. The lack of diversity makes me feel uncomfortable and a bit stupid.\""
