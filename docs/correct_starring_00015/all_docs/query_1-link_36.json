(It's a Christmas classic, how is this possible?)\n\nAnd that's not all – as well as never going back to one of the best British rom-coms out there, Keira has also forgotten some rather key details about her character Juliet.\n\nThe Nutcracker and the Four Realms actress made the admission to Wired, revealing that she has no idea whether Juliet ended up with her husband Peter or her admirer (read: stalker) Mark.\n\n\"I don't remember! Who do I end up with in Love Actually? I'm with my husband, aren't I? Aren't I with Chiwetel Ejiofor?\" she asked, before dropping a bombshell bigger than that Joni Mitchell CD.\n\n\"I've only seen it once! And it was a really long time ago!\"\n\nAfter seeking clarification, Keira then decided: \"So I don't go off with Andrew Lincoln? No? I'm with Chiwetel Ejiofor!\"\n\nC'mon, Keira. Red Nose Day Actually was only last year.\n\nRelated: Love Actually fans are stunned by this fact about Keira Knightley and Thomas Brodie-Sangster\n\nSpeaking of Love Actually, Martine McCutcheon – aka Natalie – recently dashed all hopes of a sequel despite wanting to be involved herself.\n\n\"Of course as a jobbing actress I would love to do it, I'd love to be with that amazing cast again, but I think [we] kind of did it with the Comic Relief... film together.\n\n\"That was Richard Curtis' dream come true I think. I can't speak for him, but I think.\""
