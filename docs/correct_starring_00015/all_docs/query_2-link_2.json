        "text": "Her Love Actually angle: Sarah has been desperately in love with her colleague Karl for roughly 'two years, seven months, three days and an hour and thirty minutes'. They get together at the office Christmas party but it all becomes very emotional when she's interrupted from a phone call from her brother.\n\nWhat's she been doing since?\n\nWinning awards left, right and centre. Linney, who has starred in more than 25 films and 10 TV series since Love Actually, has won an Emmy and Golden Globe for her role as a cancer patient in hit TV series The Big C. She's also been nominated for three Oscars, won Emmys for Wild Iris, Frasier, John Adams (and a Golden Globe and SAG award for this role) and starred in 2019's Netflix hit Ozark.\n\nWhat's he been doing since?\n\nWinning an Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA and SAG award for The King's Speech, reprising the role of Bridget Jones' love interest Mr Darcy - and starring opposite Hugh Grant again in the process - as well as multiple other film roles like in The Kingsman franchise.\n\nIn 2020, he starred in the Oscar-winning film 1917, featured opposite Stanley Tucci in the hugely-anticipated Supernova and was in the remake of children's classic The Secret Garden.\n\nWhat's he been doing since?\n\nA number of things! Ejiofor had the lead role in Kinky Boots in 2005 and was then nominated for the BAFTA rising star award a year later, losing out to James McAvoy.In 2008, he won a prestigious Olivier award for Best Actor for his performance in Shakespeare's Othello.\n\nEjiofor then played Solomon Northup in Steve McQueen's Oscar-winning film 12 Years A Slave in 2013 (for which he won the Best Actor BAFTA and was was Oscar and Golden Globe nominated)and starred in the 2015 film The Martian. He was awarded a CBE in 2015.\n\nIn 2019, he was part of an all-star cast including Beyonc√©, Donald Glover and Seth Rogen voicing the part of Scar in the Lion King remake. Ejiofor has also joined the cast for the upcoming film adaptation of Stephen King's short story, The Life of Chuck, which will also star Karen Gillan.\n\nWhat's she been doing since?\n\nGenerally being the world-dominating actress who is Emma Thompson. Most recently, she's received a Golden Globe nomination for Late Night. Then there were further iconic parts like Professor Trelawney in the Harry Potter franchise, Nanny McPhee and Mrs Potts in the Beauty and the Beast remake.\n\nIn 2018, Thompson was made a dame. To accept the honour at Buckingham Palace, Thompson wore a Stella McCartney suit, a pair of Stan Smiths and an equal-pay badge. A true icon.\n\nWhat's he been doing since?\n\nThe legendary English actor portrayed villain Davy Jones in the Pirates of the Caribbean series and won a Golden Globe for the TV show Gideon's Daughter in 2006. He's also had roles in Pride, About Time, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 as Rufus Scrimgeour.\n\nIn 2023, he scored his first Oscar nomination for his work in Living.\n\nHer Love Actually angle:\n\nJuliet marries Peter only to have his best friend Mark fall in love with her. This is her face when she sees Mark's creepy wedding video close-ups ('I look quite pretty actually'). Director Richard Curtis recently revealed Juliet's profession after fans demanded answers: she's an interior designer. While it was never explicitly said on screen, Curtis insists there were clues in the set, such as multiple paint swatches in her apartment.\n\nWhat's she been doing since?\n\nWell it's global megastar Keira Knightly, so a lot! Knightley, who was 17 when she starred in the film, became a huge A-List phenomenon after roles in Bend it Like Beckham!, Pirates of the Caribbean, Atonement, Pride and Prejudice, The Duchess, Anna Karenina and more.\n\nMost recently, she starred in Colette, The Official Secrets Act and Misbehaviour and The Imitation Game, for which she received an Oscar nomination. She's also a face of Chanel and received an OBE from the Queen in 2018.\n\nWhat's he been doing since?\n\nKing of Rom Coms Hugh Grant continued to do more of those, like Bridget Jones' Diary, Music and Lyrics, Did You Hear About The Morgans?.\n\nOver the past few years, he's gone in a different direction, with roles in the Paddington franchise, A Very English Scandal (where he recently nominated for an Emmy, SAG and Golden Globe), The Undoing (opposite Nicole Kidman, no less) and last year's hit Netflix film Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.\n\nWhat's she been doing since?\n\nGavin and Stacey, of course! Page rose to fame as Barry Island-native Stacey who falls in love with Essex-born Gavin and together with James Corden, Ruth Jones and Rob Brydon became household names. The sitcom, which ended in 2010, returned for a delightful Christmas special in 2019. Since 2021, she's segued into the world of presenting alongside Dermot O'Leary on ITV's The Pet Show."
