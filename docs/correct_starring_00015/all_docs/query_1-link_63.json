Most of the cast has reunited for the mini film for the charity event, and now we're getting a first taste at what we can expect. Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Andrew Lincoln are all back reprising their famous roles in the beloved rom-com.\n\nAnd while we're not usually judgey about someone's appearance, Keira really wants us to tune into the TV event to find out which of the cast has aged the most gracefully. Colin is not shy about taking a jab at Hugh Grant, his sometimes on-screen foe. But if you ask us, they both remain easy on the eyes, as you can see below."
