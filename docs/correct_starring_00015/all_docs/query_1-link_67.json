        "text": "Depressingly, it's somehow been 15 years since the release of Love Actually – and to mark the anniversary, script editor Emma Freud (partner of director Richard Curtis) has been answering some questions for fans.\n\nOne of which concerns a Love Actually remake and, if they were to do it, would any of the roles be recast.\n\nFreud took the opportunity to reveal that, in a 2018 version of the film, Curtis would cast either Saoirse Ronan or Lily James in Keira Knightley's role, while Hugh Grant would still get to play the PM because of his age.\n\nSpeaking to news.com.au, Freud said: \"Well lots of them would be the same — Hugh was a surprisingly young Prime Minister, but would be searingly realistic now. And there will never be a better Karen than Emma (Thompson), even when she’s 90. But I know Richard would cast either Saoirse Ronan or Lily James as the young bride (played by Keira Knightley). And definitely Asim Chaudhry as Colin Frissell.\"\n\nJust so it's clear, the film gladly isn't going to be remade this year, but at least you get to watch the original thing over and over again on Netflix.\n\nThe streaming service announced earlier this month that it had brought the modern Christmas classic back, writing on Twitter: \"Let's get the shit kicked out of us by love.\""
