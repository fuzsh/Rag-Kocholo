        "text": "Love Actually is a Christmas classic for many Brits. Whether you've seen it once or a hundred times, absolutely everyone can agree that Emma Thompson's character deserves a big hug and Hugh Grant's dance moves are questionable. Oh, and Keira Knightley's noughties baker boy hat deserves a special mention, too.\n\nBut while the film has been enjoyed for 20 years now (yes, it was released in 2003, and no, we can't quite get our heads around it either) it has left viewers with a lot of questions. Andrew Lincoln's infatuated character might be one of the most controversial in the film, but fans have often wondered if he ever found true love - and it turns out that Keira herself admitted that she couldn't quite remember who she actually ends up with.\n\nYou know the story - it's Christmas, Juliet (Keira) marries Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and his best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) is secretly in love with Juliet. There are some intense moments which play out to a backdrop of Dido, and he eventually turns up at her door to show her a bunch of signs declaring his undying love.\n\nSome fans were rooting for Mark and Juliet, others were convinced that Mark actually deserves a restraining order. But there's one thing we can all agree on - Juliet and Peter are happily married, and together, and that's it. End of. Except, it wasn't quite as clear cut for Keira.\n\nDuring an interview with Wired in 2018, the actress was asked who her Love Actually character ends up with - but she was a little unsure.\n\n\"I don't remember! Who do I end up with in Love Actually?\" she asked. \"'I'm with my husband, aren’t I? Aren’t I with Chiwetel Ejiofor? I've only seen it once! And it was a really long time ago! Am I [with him]? Yes? So I don't go off with Andrew Lincoln? No? I'm with Chiwetel Ejiofor!\"\n\nHow did she miss one of the most iconic storylines of the movie? A scene that has sparked endless parodies over the years - and even inspired Boris Johnson's election campaign in 2019.\n\nAnd she's only seen it once? How does anyone get through the festive season without catching it on the TV at least three times?\n\nShocking."
