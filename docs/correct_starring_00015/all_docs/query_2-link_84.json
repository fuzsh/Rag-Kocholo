        "text": "This One Movie Scene Is Actually Really Weird, According to the Director\n\nLove Actually Stalker Scene is Actually Really Weird, Director Says\n\n“Love Actually” is a festive flick that’s basically a love cocktail with a mistletoe garnish.\n\nHugh Grant is the UK Prime Minister, nervously crushing on his tea-serving staffer. Colin Firth’s a scribbler finding love in a foreign tongue. Keira Knightley’s the newlywed who gets an unexpected admirer. Then there’s the lovable Liam Neeson, trying to guide his stepson through the minefield of love. Oh, and Alan Rickman’s the guy teetering on the edge of fidelity.\n\nIt’s a rom-com circus, juggling multiple storylines, but fear not—love conquers all, even with a side of cheeky British humor.\n\nBut let’t talk about the weirdness, shall we?\n\nLove Actually Stalker Scene\n\nYou know: the guy who holds up cue cards to profess his love to Keira Knightley’s character. Sure, it’s supposed to be charming, but let’s be real—it’s more like a crash course in creepy. Andrew Lincoln’s character, not content with a simple declaration, decides to go full-on art project with the whole cue card thing.\n\nDude, just send a text!\n\nThe mood music and dim lighting make it seem romantic, but in reality, it’s like a love-themed episode of “CSI.” Imagine someone silently lurking outside your door, revealing their feelings via poster board. It’s less love story, more low-budget thriller. Next time, Lincoln, maybe consider a bouquet instead of poster-sized confessions. Keep it cute, not creepy.\n\nAnd now, even the director agrees!\n\nKiera Knightley, who is married to Mark’s best friend, through handwritten signs. “He actually turns up, to his best friend’s house, to say to his best friend’s wife, on the off chance that she answers the door, ‘I love you,’” Richard Curtis told The Independent recently. “I think it’s a bit weird.” He added, “I remember being taken by surprise about seven years ago. I was going to be interviewed by somebody and they said, ‘Of course, we’re mainly interested in the stalker scene,’ and I said, ‘What scene is that?.’ And then I was, like, educated in it. All I can say is that a lot of intelligent people were involved in the film at the time, and we didn’t think it was a stalker scene… but if it’s interesting or funny for different reasons [now] then, you know, God bless our progressive world.”\n\nHere’s the scene:\n\nLauren Beckham Falcone is the co-host of Bob & LBF in the Morning. Formerly an award-winning reporter and columnist for the Boston Herald, she credits her current success as a pop culture commentator to watching too much TV as a kid and scouring the internet too much as an adult. LBF is a regular contributor to NECN and is an honorary board member at the Massachusetts Down Syndrome Congress. Lauren lives in Canton with her husband Dave and her daughter Lucy.
