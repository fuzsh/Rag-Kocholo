        "text": "The holidays are here, which means it’s about time for your annual viewing(s) of Love Actually … if you haven’t already been watching it on repeat, that is. If the 2003 film is one of your holiday go-tos, you may be surprised to find out that two of its cast members were actually way closer in age than you originally thought. Are you prepared to have your mind blown? Great, let’s proceed.\n\nAs Bustle first reported, an actor named Madeleine Lloyd-Jones informed Twitter — and by default, the world — that Keira Knightley, AKA Juliet, and Thomas Brodie-Sangster, AKA Liam Neeson's character's son Sam, are just five years apart in age. “Yearly reminder that there is only a five year age gap between Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Keira Knightley in Love Actually,” she wrote, posting a pic of the two actors in the movie to drive home the point and shock Love Actually fans across the globe.\n\nBustle reports that Keira Knightley was just 18 when the movie was filmed, while Thomas Brodie-Sangster was 13. Despite the fact that the two look wildly different in age during the movie, when you think of them as they are today, at 34 and 29, respectively, it doesn’t seem like that big of an age gap. We don’t know about you, but we’re feeling the passage of time pretty heavily right about now.\n\nThe shock of this discovery spread like wildfire across Twitter. The tweet has since been retweeted over 18,000 times, so we’re not the only ones whose minds were blown. Fans shared their surprise, with a few even saying that the discovery “ruined” the movie for them.\n\nWhile this is certainly a surprising discovery, we wouldn’t go as far as saying their age gap changed the way we feel about the movie; we’re more uncomfortable about Keira’s storyline, which has her new husband's best friend, played by Andrew Lincoln from The Walking Dead, declaring his love for her. The moment is complete with those ever-present little signs that say things like, \"To me, you are perfect.\"\n\nBut while Love Actually is very imperfect, we will probably watch it at least five more times before the holidays are over."
