        "text": "In the long list of movies that have become timeless classics that transcend generations, 2003’s Love Actually is undoubtedly up there. The movie, which stars Hollywood powerhouses like Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Laura Linney, just to name a few, tells a multitude of different stories to show how love, in its many shapes and forms, is “all around.”\n\n“It seems to me that love is everywhere,” Grant’s character, who’s the British Prime Minister, says in the opening voiceover, per USA Today. “Often, it’s not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it’s always there: fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge – they were all messages of love. If you look for it, I’ve got a sneaky feeling you’ll find that love actually is all around.”\n\nFrom the undeniable connection between a British writer (Firth) and his Portuguese housekeeper (Lucia Moniz), to the growing connection between a little boy (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and his stepdad (Neeson), the movie will warm the heart of any viewer (as well as making them reach for a handkerchief every once in a while too).\n\nSo, in honor of the movie’s 20th anniversary this year (I know, we can barely believe it ourselves!), we’ve decided to check out what the cast of the movie is doing now. Are they still acting? Did they find their forever love?\n\nLastly, before we dive in on what the cast is doing now, we’ll note that Alan Rickman, who plays Thompson’s husband Harry in the movie, sadly passed away a few years ago in 2016. May he rest in peace."
