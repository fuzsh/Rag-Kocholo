        "text": "Romance is Juliet's bread and butter. Since her role as a newlywed in Love Actually, Keira Knightley has continued making blockbusters: Disney’s live-action The Nutcracker, Colette, Pirates of the Caribbean, Anna Karenina, Pride & Prejudice and Atonement, to name a few. And she shows no *signs* (get it? Like the signs Mark holds up for her to read in the movie?!) of slowing down anytime soon.\n\nAnother no-name (JK), Hugh Grant’s recent works include Florence Foster Jenkins opposite Meryl Streep, the villain in Paddington 2 and a return to TV with A Very English Scandal. Oh, and he tied the knot this May with longtime girlfriend Anna Eberstein and welcomed his fifth child this year. (Cue David’s infamous solo dance scene.)\n\nDaniel, aka young Sam’s stepdad, aka Liam Neeson, has a particular set of skills (LOL) that paid off in the form of blockbusters like Taken, The Huntsman: Winter’s War and, most recently, the Coen brothers’ latest western, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.\n\nDaniel’s stepson Sam is a lovestruck young boy in the movie (some fans even noticed the similarities between Sam/Joanna and Prince Harry/Meghan Markle in a meme that went viral earlier this year). Now, the actor, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, is 28 years old (We. Are. Ancient.) and has had some major gigs of late, including the Maze Runner movies and portraying Jojen Reed on Game of Thrones (what?!).\n\nNow 26, Olivia Olson played the precocious American classmate to Sam (and gave us a much-needed dose of Mariah Carey). Since the film, the actress-singer has done voice work for animated shows on Cartoon Network and the Disney channel, and recently released her second album, Nowhere Land.\n\nNot sure about you, but Uncle Jamie’s story was our fave. You can catch Academy Award winner Colin Firth in next month’s Mary Poppins Returns and in the upcoming The Secret Garden remake (and, obvi, this year’s Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, because how could we forget Harry?!).\n\nThe Ozarks are a far cry from London, that’s for sure. Four-time Emmy Award winner and two-time Golden Globe winner Laura Linney currently plays Wendy Byrde, wife to Jason Bateman’s character Marty Byrde, on Netflix’s Ozark. She’s also recently starred in Sully, The Dinner and Nocturnal Animals.\n\nWelllll, howdy, Hector! Sarah’s hot crush, Karl, is none other than dark and brooding bandit Hector Escaton on HBO’s Westworld. He also played king Xerxes in the movie 300 and its sequel 300: Rise of an Empire. Seems he's still steaming up TV sets one badass role at a time...\n\nJoni Mitchell fan Karen (love ya, Karen) was a big name before and after Love Actually. Emma Thompson recently received her damehood (and tried to kiss Prince William during the ceremony!) and will star in the new Men in Black 3 movie alongside Love Actually co-star Liam Neeson. (Does MIB3 explain the new hairdo?)\n\nCalling all TWD fans: Andrew Lincoln, who plays Mark, aka Juliet’s husband’s BFF who was high-key obsessed with her, was Rick Grimes on The Walking Dead (although his days were numbered), but may be back for three TWD movies. Bless.\n\nJuliet’s husband Peter is none other than Chiwetel Ejiofor, renowned for his portrayal of Solomon Northup in 2013’s 12 Years a Slave. He’s also set to voice Scar in The Lion King remake due out next year. (Move over, Jeremy Irons…)\n\nSoft-spoken Natalie was a staff member and, later, love interest to Hugh Grant as the prime minister (and, um, object of creepy affection to the U.S. president, played by none other than Billy Bob Thornton). She's portrayed by English actress Martine McCutcheon, who began her career as a singer and moved to Hollywood after Love Actually. Though a big-screen career never took off (nor a real-life fairy-tale romance with a prime minister), she’s been in a number of soaps and daytime TV shows in the U.K. since."
