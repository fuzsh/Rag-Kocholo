        "text": "Set to the backdrop of Christmas, Love Actually finds believability in the unbelievable, crafting an environment where anything can happen and the greatest risks should be taken.\n\nJanuary 12, 2024\n\nThe film is all but stolen... by Bill Nighy as a washed up rock star goofing his way through his holiday TV and radio appearances as his seasonal song climbs the charts.\n\nJanuary 6, 2024\n\n... Curtis and company remind us that love, actually, is everywhere no matter the time of year, period, or place. That’s what helps make it a staple watch this and any other time of year.\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\nA cringe 10 for the price of one bulk holiday sale of the most well-worn rom-com tropes.\n\nDecember 11, 2023\n\nThe film simply has an attractive charm about it that pulls you in and keeps you interested.\n\nNovember 21, 2023\n\nRichard Curtis’ Love Actually claims the prize of being the “ultimate romantic comedy” not through daring or originality, but by covering every cliché imaginable offered by the genre, and doing so with style.\n\nAugust 28, 2023\n\n...while Curtis clearly connects more with some stories than others, the best bits are genuinely classics...\n\nDecember 27, 2021\n\nThe work is lopsided and misshapen, not like life, but a poor, contrived, somewhat disoriented impression of life.\n\nFebruary 15, 2021\n\nA load of sickeningly twee nonsense inflated, bizarrely, into some kind of totemic Christmas film that only humbugs suggest might not just be rubbish.\n\nJanuary 31, 2021"
