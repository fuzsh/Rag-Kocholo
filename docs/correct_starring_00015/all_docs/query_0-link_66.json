        "text": "Christmas\n\nChester Zoo reveals new plans for ‘spectacular’ winter light trail Emily Sergeant\n\nChester Zoo has revealed new plans for a “spectacular” lights trail this winter, and it sounds even more magical than ever.\n\nIs it too early to mention the ‘C’ word? Probably, considering it is the middle of July… but despite how far in advance it may seem, Chester Zoo has wasted absolutely no time at all in revealing exciting plans for the return of its massively-popular lights trail this winter.\n\nLanterns and Light is by far one of the UK’s largest charity zoo’s best-loved events each year, so it’s absolutely no surprise to hear it’s making a 2024 comeback.\n\nSet to feature a raft of new additions, and therefore more animal lantern puppets than ever before, the zoo is promising that this year’s Lanterns and Light will be even longer and “more exciting” than what visitors saw in back in 2023 – with the event running all the way through to New Year’s Day for the first time in its history.\n\nThe zoo will be teaming up with entertainment giants, Sony Music, once again to deliver this year’s beloved festive spectacle.\n\nOpening to the public for some festive family-friendly fun from 15 November, organisers say visitors should expect to take a journey through a number of distinct and vibrant lands, where they’ll encounter an exciting lineup of costumed characters and new animal puppets – including meerkats, peacocks, red pandas, and snow leopards.\n\nAn “incredible” new soundscape will add to the immersive experience, while animal lanterns such as dragonflies hovering over water, elephants in permafrost, and exotic birds flying overhead, decorate the route of the stunning light trail.\n\nIf the lights and sculptures themselves weren’t impressive enough as it is, there’ll also be a whole new festive menu on offer at food and drink markets stationed in various locations within the zoo too.\n\nHeidi Budden, who is the Marketing Manager at Chester Zoo, expects this year’s Lanterns and Light to be a “wonderful evening” and says it gives visitors the chance to “play a part in helping wildlife to thrive”.\n\n“We’ve made the light trail even longer and packed it with exciting new elements,” she added.\n\n“There’ll be more animal lanterns than ever before, and never-before-seen interactive puppets including energetic meerkats, colourful peacocks and playful snow leopards, all joined by many of the family favourites from years gone by that people have grown to love.”\n\nLanterns and Light will return to Chester Zoo from Friday 15 November 2024, and run on selected evenings right through to New Year’s Day – with tickets now on sale.\n\nTicket sales will help to support the zoo in its conservation efforts to protect some of the planet’s most threatened species.\n\nRead more:\n\nChester Zoo’s ‘after hours’ evenings are returning next month with tickets 50% cheaper than during the day\n\nPlans approved for new safari lodges at Chester Zoo where visitors wake up next to

to Auld Lang Syne for New Year’s Eve, and what the song means Daisy Jackson\n\nThe clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Eve, the confetti is thrown, the kisses are exchanged, and then up starts Auld Lang Syne and you realise, once again, that you don’t know the lyrics to the iconic song.\n\nThis classic song is traditionally sung as we welcome in a new year, but you may (like us) find yourself singing the words as ‘dah daaah dah dah daaah dah dah, dah dah daaah dah Auld Lang Syne.”\n\nWell it’s time to stop that behaviour and learn yourselves the Auld Lang Syne lyrics, quick time, before we hit 2024.\n\nThe text of the song is actually from a Robert Burns poem, penned way back in 1788 and based on an old Scottish folk song.\n\nIt was set to a tune a decade later, and since then has been recorded by dozens of different artists.\n\nAuld Lang Syne can loosely translate as ‘old long since’, or ‘days gone by’ or ‘old times’.\n\nSo its meaning roughly is ‘for the sale of old times’.\n\nThere are longer versions of the song, but the lyrics to the most commonly-played version of Auld Lang Syne are below.\n\nSo hold hands with your loved ones, crack open the champers, and ring in a very happy new year.\n\nWhat are the lyrics to Auld Lang Syne?\n\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot\n\nAnd never brought to mind?\n\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot\n\nAnd the days of auld lang syne?\n\nFor auld lang syne, my dear\n\nFor auld lang syne\n\nWe’ll drink a cup of kindness yet\n\nFor the sake of auld lang syne\n\nAnd surely you will buy your cup\n\nAnd surely I’ll buy mine!\n\nWe’ll take a cup of kindness yet\n\nFor the sake of auld lang syne\n\nWe two have paddled in the stream\n\nFrom morning sun till night\n\nThe seas between us Lord and swell\n\nSince the days of auld lang syne\n\nFor old acquaintance be forgot\n\nAnd never brought to mind\n\nShould old acquaintance be forgot\n\nFor the sake of auld lang syne?\n\nFor old acquaintance be forgot\n\nAnd never brought to mind\n\nShould old acquaintance be forgot\n\nIn the days of auld lang syne?\n\nFor auld lang syne, my dear\n\nFor auld lang syne\n\nWe’ll drink a cup of kindness yet\n\nFor the sake of auld lang syne\n\nRead more\n\nManchester city centre road closures confirmed for New Year’s Eve fireworks display\n\nAll the January deals, offers and discounts at Manchester restaurants you need in
