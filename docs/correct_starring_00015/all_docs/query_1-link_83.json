        "text": "IT'S FAIR to say that Love Actually is one of the most treasured Christmas movies of all time.\n\nThe film was released way back in 2003, and some fans have wondered about how old Keira Knightley really was when she starred in the movie.\n\nWho is Keira Knightley?\n\nKeira Knightley was born on March 26, 1985 in Teddington, London.\n\nShe has been acting since school, but began her professional career appearing in commercials and modeling.\n\nFrom there, Keira made the leap to film work in the early 2000s, and she hasn't slowed down since.\n\nShe shot to fame in the Brit flick Bend It Like Beckham, but it was her role in Love Actually that shot her to Hollywood stardom.\n\nIn 2018, she was appointed an OBE at Buckingham Palace for services to drama and charity.\n\nAs of December Keira has a net worth of Â£64M.\n\nHow old was Keira Knightley in Love Actually?\n\nWhen the popular 2003 Christmas rom-com was made, Keira was just 18 when she played Juliet in Love Actually.\n\nWhat's more, Chiwetel Ejiofor - who she married in the movie - was 26 at the time of filming, meaning there was an eight-year age gap between the on-screen couple.\n\nAlso, Andrew Lincoln who played Mark, who was in love with Juliet in the movie, was 30 when the movie was released.\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas Brodie-Sangster - who played lovesick Sam in the movie - was 13 when the movie was filmed.\n\nThat makes him just five years younger than Keira when the movie was filmed, despite their age difference looking far greater than that.\n\nWhere is Keira Knightley and what films has she starred in?\n\nAs of December 2022 Keira is working on her new true-crime movie called the Boston Strangler, which depicts the real life murders that happened in the 1960s.\n\nBut the Academy Award-nominated star is best known for movies as like the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, and Pride and Prejudice.\n\nKeira also had lead roles Atonement, The Duchess, Never Let Me Go, and A Dangerous Method."
