        "text": "The director of Love Actually has finally confirmed what Keira Knightley's character's job is in the beloved Christmas film.\n\nRichard Curtis is the director behind the 2003 festive romantic comedy that featured major names such as Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson. Actress Keira of course played the role of newly wed Juliet in the film, secretly admired by friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln).\n\nIn a video interview on TikTok with his daughter Scarlett, director and writer Richard answered a question many fans of the film have speculated about since; just what is Juliet's profession? We see a lot of her through the loving gaze of Mark but there was little revealed about Keira's character's background in Love Actually.\n\nREAD MORE: London's longest graffiti tunnel to transform into alternative Christmas street party\n\nBased in London, Love Actually follows separate stories of individuals as they deal with different aspects of love leading to many of their tales becoming intertwined by the end. There's all kinds of unforgettable moments, from Hugh Grant's dance around Westminster as Prime Minister to the heart-breaking Emma Thompson Joni Mitchell moment - if you know, you know.\n\nKeira's Juliet marries Peter near the beginning of the film and the couple believe his best friend Mark dislikes them. However, when Juliet watches the videos he shot of the wedding, it becomes clear he is in love with her and later leads to his iconic message via cue cards and a boombox on her doorstep.\n\nBut Scarlett wanted to get down to the important question of Juliet's profession in a conversation with her film writer father. She asked: \"What in Love Actually is Juliet's job that you insisted to me was very clear and had been thought through?\"\n\nRichard responded: \"I think it's very clear from the set design whilst she's making the phone call to Andrew Lincoln that she has worked for quite a long time as an interior decorator.\" With a slightly sarcastic tone, Scarlett went on to quiz Juliet's \"journey to interior design\".\n\nHer father went on: \"I think it's more a question that when we said, when doing this scene where she makes the phone call to Andrew Lincoln, everyone panicked and said 'what kind of a room is she going to be making the phone call from?' and I said, 'well how about maybe she's an interior decorator?' and so there's lots of swatches and some paint cans.\"\n\nRichard eventually admitted Juliet's job was \"an afterthought\". Keeping it humorous, Scarlett then asked: \"And follow-up question, how did an 18-year-old become an interior designer in your film?\" When Love Actually was made, actress Keira, now 37, was still a teenager.\n\nThe director and film writer answered: \"I don't think, my instinct is I'm repeatedly surprised when it turns out Keira was 18, my feeling is that her performance is of a 23-year-old and so she's had time to establish herself in that particular trade.\"\n\nFans were surprised by this revelation as one joked in the comments: \"Anyone else thought she was just redecorating?\" Another wrote: \"She was 17/18 when they filmed this, what was she decorating, her locker at school?\" to which Scarlett jokingly replied with a laughing-face: \"She was decorating the 6th form common room.\"\n\nDo you have a story you think we should be covering?
