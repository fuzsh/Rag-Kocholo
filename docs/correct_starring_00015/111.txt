But things haven’t always been easy for the star, as she was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) aged just 22 after struggling to adjust to A-list celebrity status.

She said in a US podcast: “I did have a mental breakdown at 22, so I did take a year off and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. I went deep into therapy. From the inside, all you’re hearing is the criticism. I literally felt like I was worthless.”

She added that she had to go to hypnotherapy to find the confidence to go the Baftas in 2008.

She said: “I hadn’t been out of the house for three months. I actually did hypnotherapy so that I could stand on the red carpet at the Baftas and not have a panic attack. I felt pretty much like actually I didn’t exist and I was this weird creature with this weird face that people seemed to respond to in quite an extreme way, and I couldn’t quite figure any of it out.”
