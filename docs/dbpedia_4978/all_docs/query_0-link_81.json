        "text": "New Zealand designates entirety of Hamas as a \"terrorist entity\"\n\nThe New Zealand government designated all of Hamas as a “terrorist entity” on Thursday, broadening its policy on the Islamist group.\n\nThe country now considers Hamas’ political wing a “terrorist entity”. It designated the military wing of Hamas a “terrorist entity” in 2010.\n\n“What happened on 7 October reinforces we can no longer distinguish between the military and political wings of Hamas,” New Zealand’s Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.\n\nHe said that the “organisation as a whole bears responsibility for these horrific terrorist attacks.”\n\nThe move means that any assets of Hamas in New Zealand will be frozen, and any financial or property transactions or material support to Hamas is now a criminal offense in the country.\n\nCalls to end violence: New Zealand’s Prime Minister Christopher Luxon clarified that “this designation targets Hamas, not the provision of private humanitarian support to Palestinian civilians.”\n\nIt will also not hinder New Zealand’s efforts to provide humanitarian and development assistance to the civilians in Gaza, Luxon said.\n\nConsular support to New Zealand citizens or permanent residents in the conflict zone will also not be affected.\n\nPeters said that Wellington remains “gravely concerned” about the impact of the conflict on civilians in Gaza and called “for an end to the violence and an urgent resumption of the Middle East Peace Process.”\n\nOfficials have distanced themselves from Biden's ceasefire deal comments. Here's what you should know\n\nOfficials from Israel, Hamas and Qatar have distanced themselves from US President Joe Biden’s comments after he projected optimism that a hostage-for-ceasefire deal in Gaza could be reached by the end of this week,\n\nEarlier this week, CNN reported Hamas had backed off some key demands in the negotiations for a deal and pause in the fighting in Gaza, bringing the negotiating parties closer to an initial agreement that could halt the fighting and see a group of Israeli hostages released, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nHere are other headlines you should know:\n\nHumanitarian crisis: At least six children died in recent days as a result of dehydration and malnutrition in Gaza, according to a statement from the Ministry of Health in Gaza. At least four children died at Kamal Adwan Hospital in the past few days, and two children died at the Al-Shifa Medical Complex on Wednesday, the health ministry and a local doctor said.\n\nIndiscriminate killing: The United Nations is urging an investigation into indiscriminate Israeli fire that killed half of a family in Gaza, after a CNN report about it was published Wednesday.\n\nMore Israeli strikes: At least two people were killed and 14 others wounded as a result of Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon Wednesday night local time, according to Lebanon’s state-run NNA news. The airstrikes hit the towns of Kafra and Seddiqine, situated near the border with Israel, NNA said in the report.\n\nCalls from the US: The US called on Israel to allow worshippers to go to the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem for Ramadan, as Hamas calls for Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank to march on the mosque on the first day of the holy month. The US also called on Israel to sign a letter pledging it will not commit human rights violations with US weapons, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller confirmed. He noted the request is not specific to Israel, but applies to all nations who receive US military assistance.\n\nUNRWA allegations: Israel still has not provided evidence to support its allegations that members of the main UN aid agency in Gaza were involved in the October 7 Hamas attacks, according to the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).\n\nFamilies of killed Palestinian-Americans demand answers from US and Israel\n\nThe last moments of Mohammad Khdour’s life could be those of any American teenager: taking the car out during a study break, snacking on chocolate waffles, posing for Instagram.\n\nThose carefree moments with his cousin along the hillsides of Biddu, in the occupied West Bank, were captured in photos and videos reviewed by CNN.\n\nThey were snuffed out, his family says, when an Israeli gunman opened fire on their car, shooting the 17-year-old Khdour in the head.\n\nThe death of Khdour, a Florida-born US citizen, just weeks after another 17-year-old American citizen was shot under strikingly similar circumstances in the occupied West Bank, has underscored the frustrations among Palestinian-Americans who say the United States is doing little to respond to the deaths of their loved ones.\n\nVideos from the aftermath of the February 10 shooting show several people rushing to the damaged car, pulling Khdour’s limp, bloodied body out from the shattered glass.\n\nKhdour died hours later at a Ramallah hospital, his family said.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces referred questions about the case to the Israeli Security Agency, which did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nSome context: The killing or detention of American citizens in occupied Palestinian territories by Israelis and the concerns about a lack of accountability date back years.\n\nIn 2003, 23-year-old American activist Rachel Corrie was crushed by an Israeli army bulldozer while trying to block it from razing Palestinian homes in Gaza. Nine years later, an Israeli civil court ruled Corrie’s death an accident.\n\nRead more about Palestinian Americans who were killed in the region.\n\nIsraeli movie director Yuval Abraham says he has received death threats after calling for a ceasefire\n\nIsraeli journalist and film director Yuval Abraham said he is receiving death threats and has canceled his flight home from the Berlin International Film Festival amid backlash to an acceptance speech in which he decried the “situation of apartheid” and called for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nAbraham and his Palestinian co-director Basel Adra accepted the Best Documentary award for their film “No Other Land,” which chronicles evictions and demolitions of Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank by Israeli authorities, on Saturday.\n\nTheir speeches were met with accusations of antisemitism by high-level German and Israeli officials, including the mayor of Berlin and Israel’s Ambassador to Germany.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nIt's morning in Gaza. Here's what you need to know\n\nOfficials from Israel, Hamas and Qatar have cautioned against US President Joe Biden’s optimism that a hostage-for-ceasefire deal in Gaza could be reached by the end of this week.\n\nAn Israeli official told CNN Tuesday that Israel was “surprised that he [Biden] used the word Monday and that he used the word ceasefire.”\n\nA Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson said he remains hopeful that an agreement can be reached before the beginning of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan on March 10 or 11.\n\nHere’s what else you should know:\n\nStarvation warning: United Nations officials have warned that more than a half a million people in Gaza are on the brink of famine and a ceasefire is urgently needed to facilitate the delivery of food aid. The World Food Programme said the enclave is seeing the worst level of child malnutrition in the world — with one child in every six under the age of 2 in Gaza acutely malnourished.\n\nRising toll: The total number of people killed in Gaza since October 7 is up to 29,878, with the number of injured reaching 70,215, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry. CNN cannot independently confirm the numbers.\n\nHealth care decimated: Hospitals in Gaza are facing dire conditions, with some operating without electricity, water and low levels of medical supplies, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave. The situation is particularly critical at the Nasser medical complex in southern Gaza, the ministry said.\n\nRafah military operation: Israel will take measures to protect civilians if it expands military operations in Rafah, a military spokesperson told CNN. A White House official told CNN the US won’t support Israel’s planned offensive in the southern city until it sees a plan to ensure the safety of more than 1 million refugees seeking shelter there.\n\nUS forces reduction: A Marine rapid response force is expected to leave the eastern Mediterranean Sea in the coming weeks and return to the United States, according to two defense officials, in a significant reduction of US forces in the region. An exact timeline for the departure is unclear and the Pentagon could still decide to keep the group in the region if the situation rapidly deteriorates.\n\nQatar hoping deal between Israel-Hamas is reached before Ramadan, but no agreement yet\n\nIsrael and Hamas have yet to reach an agreement to pause fighting in exchange for the release of hostages from Gaza, Qatar’s foreign ministry’s spokesperson said.\n\nBut he remains hopeful that a final agreement can be reached before the beginning of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan on March 10 or 11.\n\nRemember: Officials from Israel, Hamas and Qatar have cautioned against US President Joe Biden’s optimism that a hostage-for-ceasefire deal in Gaza could be reached by the end of this week, suggesting that differences remain as negotiators work to secure an agreement.\n\nWhite House says US won't support Israel's incursion into Rafah without seeing a civilian evacuation plan\n\nThe United States won’t support Israel’s planned offensive into Rafah until officials have seen a plan that ensures the safety of refugees seeking shelter in the southern Gaza city, US National Security spokesperson John Kirby told CNN Tuesday.\n\nThis comes despite comments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicating Israel will move into Rafah regardless of whether a humanitarian pause is negotiated in Gaza.\n\nKirby cited comments from Netanyahu earlier this month that he’d ordered the Israeli Defense Forces to produce “a plan for operations in Rafah — to include in that a plan for securing the safety of the more than a million refugees that are there.”\n\nBut Kirby acknowledged US officials “have not been presented with such a plan” to date.\n\nGaza hospitals face critical lack of electricity, water and medical supplies, Health Ministry says\n\nHospitals in Gaza are facing dire conditions, with some operating without electricity, water and low levels of medical supplies, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave.\n\nThe situation is particularly critical at the Nasser medical complex in southern Gaza, the ministry said, adding that the hospital’s generator has stopped, the sewage network has broken down, water was cut off, and a lack of medical capabilities has hindered the facility’s work.\n\nIn northern Gaza, the Al-Awda Health and Community Association said that its hospital cannot carry out medical services due to the lack of medical supplies, warning of the possibility of a “complete cessation” of services in the next 48 hours.\n\nThe Israeli military is working on a way to get aid into northern Gaza “quickly,” an Israeli official told CNN earlier Tuesday. The Israel Defense Forces is working out where aid would cross into Gaza, the source said.\n\nDeath toll approaches 30,000: The total number of people killed in Gaza since October 7 is up to 29,878, with the number of injured reaching 70,215, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry.\n\nCNN cannot independently confirm the numbers due to the lack of international media access to Gaza.\n\nCNN’s Richard Allen Greene contributed reporting to this post."
