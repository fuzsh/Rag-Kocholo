        "text": "New Zealand designates entirety of Hamas as a \"terrorist entity\"\n\nThe New Zealand government designated all of Hamas as a “terrorist entity” on Thursday, broadening its policy on the Islamist group.\n\nThe country now considers Hamas’ political wing a “terrorist entity”. It designated the military wing of Hamas a “terrorist entity” in 2010.\n\n“What happened on 7 October reinforces we can no longer distinguish between the military and political wings of Hamas,” New Zealand’s Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.\n\nHe said that the “organisation as a whole bears responsibility for these horrific terrorist attacks.”\n\nThe move means that any assets of Hamas in New Zealand will be frozen, and any financial or property transactions or material support to Hamas is now a criminal offense in the country.\n\nCalls to end violence: New Zealand’s Prime Minister Christopher Luxon clarified that “this designation targets Hamas, not the provision of private humanitarian support to Palestinian civilians.”\n\nIt will also not hinder New Zealand’s efforts to provide humanitarian and development assistance to the civilians in Gaza, Luxon said.\n\nConsular support to New Zealand citizens or permanent residents in the conflict zone will also not be affected.\n\nPeters said that Wellington remains “gravely concerned” about the impact of the conflict on civilians in Gaza and called “for an end to the violence and an urgent resumption of the Middle East Peace Process.”\n\nIsraeli airstrikes in south Lebanon kills 2 people, state-run media reports\n\nAt least two people were killed and 14 others wounded as a result of Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon Wednesday night local time, according to Lebanon’s state-run NNA news.\n\nThe airstrikes hit areas in the towns Kafra and Seddiqine, situated near the border with Israel, NNA said.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a short statement Wednesday night that “IDF fighter jets struck Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in the areas of Kafra and Seddiqine in southern Lebanon.”\n\nSome context: According to figures released by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health on February 23, at least 199 people have been killed and 941 people have been wounded since October 8 as a result of “Israeli aggression against southern Lebanon.”\n\nNearly 90,000 people have been displaced from areas and towns close to the border with Israel since the conflict started, the Lebanese health ministry said in its report.\n\nUN calls for investigation after CNN report on indiscriminate Israeli fire that killed half a family in Gaza\n\nThe United Nations is urging an investigation into indiscriminate Israeli fire that killed half of a family in Gaza, after a CNN report about it was published Wednesday.\n\nThe UN does not have its own information on the incident, “but they need to be investigated,” Dujarric said, reiterating the UN’s plea for Israel to allow more journalists in Gaza.\n\nUS calls on Israel to allow access to al-Aqsa mosque for Ramadan\n\nThe US called on Israel to allow worshippers to go to the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem for Ramadan, as Hamas calls for Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank to march on the mosque on the first day of the holy month.\n\nFar-right Israeli cabinet minister Itamar Ben Gvir has proposed increased restrictions to the holy site for Palestinians during Ramadan. Such restrictions, if instituted, threaten to ignite already increased tensions.\n\nAbout the site: The al-Aqsa compound is one of the most revered places in Islam and Judaism. The sacred grounds — known to Muslims as Al Haram Al Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) and to Jews as Temple Mount — have been a flashpoint of tensions between Israel and the Palestinians for decades.\n\nMiller said allowing access to al-Aqsa is “a matter that directly is important to Israel’s security,” adding that “it is not in Israel’s security interest to inflame tensions in the West Bank or in the broader region.”\n\nCNN’s Salam Abdelaziz and Abeer Salman contributed to this report.\n\nHamas political leader says group showed flexibility in negotiations but remains ready to continue fighting\n\nHamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh said Wednesday the militant group has displayed flexibility in negotiations but remains ready to continue fighting.\n\n“Any flexibility we show in negotiations out of concern for the blood of our people and to put an end to their great pain and enormous sacrifices…is paralleled by a willingness to defend our people,” Haniyeh said in a televised statement.\n\n“We are reaffirming to the Zionists and Americans…that what they have failed to impose on the battlefield they will not take through political machinations,” he said.\n\nHaniyeh called on Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank to march to Al Aqsa Mosque on the first day of Ramadan.\n\nIt's morning in Gaza. Here's what you need to know\n\nOfficials from Israel, Hamas and Qatar have cautioned against US President Joe Biden’s optimism that a hostage-for-ceasefire deal in Gaza could be reached by the end of this week.\n\nAn Israeli official told CNN Tuesday that Israel was “surprised that he [Biden] used the word Monday and that he used the word ceasefire.”\n\nA Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson said he remains hopeful that an agreement can be reached before the beginning of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan on March 10 or 11.\n\nHere’s what else you should know:\n\nStarvation warning: United Nations officials have warned that more than a half a million people in Gaza are on the brink of famine and a ceasefire is urgently needed to facilitate the delivery of food aid. The World Food Programme said the enclave is seeing the worst level of child malnutrition in the world — with one child in every six under the age of 2 in Gaza acutely malnourished.\n\nRising toll: The total number of people killed in Gaza since October 7 is up to 29,878, with the number of injured reaching 70,215, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry. CNN cannot independently confirm the numbers.\n\nHealth care decimated: Hospitals in Gaza are facing dire conditions, with some operating without electricity, water and low levels of medical supplies, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave. The situation is particularly critical at the Nasser medical complex in southern Gaza, the ministry said.\n\nRafah military operation: Israel will take measures to protect civilians if it expands military operations in Rafah, a military spokesperson told CNN. A White House official told CNN the US won’t support Israel’s planned offensive in the southern city until it sees a plan to ensure the safety of more than 1 million refugees seeking shelter there.\n\nUS forces reduction: A Marine rapid response force is expected to leave the eastern Mediterranean Sea in the coming weeks and return to the United States, according to two defense officials, in a significant reduction of US forces in the region. An exact timeline for the departure is unclear and the Pentagon could still decide to keep the group in the region if the situation rapidly deteriorates.\n\nGaza child asks, \"Are you waiting for our death?\" as desperation grows\n\nCNN’s Nic Robertson reports increasing food shortages in Gaza are causing citizens to become increasingly desperate and instances of looting food aid trucks have paused delivery in some areas.\n\nTake a look at the dire situation unfolding in northern Gaza:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nbdf69c83-cfaa-483e-8ac5-2a35799e10c2.mp4\n\n03:13 - Source: cnn\n\nBiden projected optimism on Gaza ceasefire deal. Israel and Hamas are already distancing themselves from it\n\nOfficials from Israel, Hamas and Qatar have cautioned against US President Joe Biden’s optimism that a hostage-for-ceasefire deal in Gaza could be reached by the end of this week, suggesting that differences remain as negotiators work to secure an agreement.\n\nBiden said Monday he hoped there would be a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict by “next Monday,” as the death toll in Gaza approaches 30,000.\n\nWhat Israel says: Israel was “surprised that he (Biden) used the word “ceasefire” on Monday, an Israeli official told CNN Tuesday, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject. “I don’t know on what basis he said it.”\n\n“Israel will be ready to release (Palestinian) prisoners even today if conditions are met,” the official added.\n\nWhat Hamas says: Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’ political bureau, told CNN Tuesday that the group was unaware of any ceasefire agreement that could be brokered by next Monday. “There is nothing,” Naim said.\n\nWhat Qatar says: Qatar, which along with the US is a key mediator in negotiations between Israel and Hamas, added further caution on Tuesday and hinted at a different timeline than was suggested by Biden. “If there was an agreement, you would see me more in a cheered attitude,” Majed Al-Ansari, a spokesperson for the Qatar Foreign Ministry, said, adding that meetings are still taking place, which signal a positive trajectory."
