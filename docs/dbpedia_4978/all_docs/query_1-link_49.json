        "text": "Israel hasn't provided evidence to support allegations against UNRWA employees, agency chief says\n\nIsrael still has not provided evidence to support its allegations that members of the main United Nations aid agency in Gaza were involved in the October 7 Hamas attacks, according to the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).\n\n“We haven’t received anything more than what we see on the media,” he said.\n\nLazzarini called footage that purports to show a UNRWA staff member participating in the kidnapping of Yonatan Samerano — who was killed in kibbutz Be’eri on October 7 — “shocking images.”\n\nBackground on the footage: A video screened last week during a press conference with the Hostage and Missing Families Forum showed a white SUV approaching the entrance of what appears to be the kibbutz. Two men exit the vehicle and are seen carrying a body from the road into the vehicle. One of the men is identified in the footage as an UNWRA worker. CNN could not independently verify the identity of the men or Israel’s allegations about his involvement with Hamas.\n\nLazzarini said Wednesday that he “personally cannot recognize the person on the video.” He called for “more forensic evidence to be provided,” while acknowledging the name of the accused man in the video “matched our staff list” and that his UNRWA contract was terminated.\n\nRemember: UNRWA fired 10 of the 12 staff members accused by Israel of involvement in the October 7 attacks and launched an investigation into the allegations, in hopes of keeping international funding to the agency flowing at a critical time. At least 16 countries have paused or suspended funding to UNRWA since the allegations emerged, Lazzarini said, warning that operations beyond March will be impacted unless more money is donated.\n\nPolitical faction Fatah will attend intra-Palestinian meeting in Moscow\n\nPalestinian political faction Fatah told CNN it would attend an intra-Palestinian meeting on Thursday in Moscow.\n\nEarlier this month, Russia invited all Palestinian factions, including Hamas, to meet in Moscow.\n\nThe meeting will tackle ways to “unite the Palestinian factions under the Palestinian Liberation Organization,” Fatah spokesperson Hussein Hamayel told CNN. The aim is to form a new government capable of working in East Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank and Gaza, he said.\n\nFatah controls the Palestinian Authority (PA) based in the West Bank, which held administrative control over Gaza until 2007. Hamas won the 2006 legislative elections in the occupied territories and expelled the faction from the enclave. Since then, Hamas has ruled Gaza and the PA governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nFatah’s delegation will be represented by officials Samir Al Rifai and Azzam Al Ahmad, the spokesperson said.\n\nHamayel said Hamas had not confirmed its attendance but that he is optimistic they would join and send a “high ranking official from their political office to represent them.”\n\nHamas has not responded to CNN’s request for confirmation of their attendance.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said Tuesday that “all parties” agreed to participate in the Moscow meeting.\n\nCampaign for protest vote against Biden's Gaza response claims success in Democratic primary\n\nSupporters of the movement urging Michigan Democratic voters to check “uncommitted” in protest of the Biden administration’s response to Israel’s war in Gaza said their campaign had been a success.\n\n“We know Joe Biden is going to be our nominee. So it’s a very, very significant outcome,” former Michigan Rep. Andy Levin, a supporter of the “uncommitted” effort, told CNN on Tuesday night.\n\nLevin said that the message that Biden can’t win Michigan in November unless he “changes course” had been “effectively communicated” through Tuesday’s result.\n\nThe campaign kept its focus narrow, aiming to convince Biden’s White House to seek a permanent ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\n“Uncommitted” campaign exceeds expectations: Organizers of the movement had hoped at least 10,000 people would support the cause, a nod to the 10,700-vote margin that delivered the state to Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nMore than 100,000 voters checked “uncommitted,” a raw total well over Trump’s margin of victory in 2016.\n\nA Biden campaign email touting the president’s Michigan win made no mention of the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nRead more about the impact of the “Uncommitted” protest vote in the Michigan Democratic primary.\n\nHostages’ families begin 4-day march from Nova Festival site to Jerusalem\n\nFamilies of hostages in Gaza have started a four-day march from the site of the Nova Festival in southern Israel’s Re’im to Jerusalem, repeating calls for the release of those kidnapped on October 7.\n\n“March with us for the hostages,” the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said on Wednesday.\n\nRemember: Hamas militants stormed the Nova Festival on October 7 in an attack that killed over 360 people.\n\nIn the attacks on Israel that day, 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 were taken hostage.\n\nThere are believed to be 130 hostages still in Gaza, of which 99 are believed to be alive.\n\nPressure is mounting for a hostage-for-ceasefire deal in Gaza, with negotiations ongoing.\n\nThis post has been updated to reflect the latest information provided by authorities.\n\nIsraeli movie director Yuval Abraham says he has received death threats after calling for a ceasefire\n\nIsraeli journalist and film director Yuval Abraham said he is receiving death threats and has canceled his flight home from the Berlin International Film Festival amid backlash to an acceptance speech in which he decried the “situation of apartheid” and called for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nAbraham and his Palestinian co-director Basel Adra accepted the Best Documentary award for their film “No Other Land,” which chronicles evictions and demolitions of Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank by Israeli authorities, on Saturday.\n\nTheir speeches were met with accusations of antisemitism by high-level German and Israeli officials, including the mayor of Berlin and Israel’s Ambassador to Germany.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nGaza child asks, \"Are you waiting for our death?\" as desperation grows\n\nCNN’s Nic Robertson reports increasing food shortages in Gaza are causing citizens to become increasingly desperate and instances of looting food aid trucks have paused delivery in some areas.\n\nTake a look at the dire situation unfolding in northern Gaza:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nbdf69c83-cfaa-483e-8ac5-2a35799e10c2.mp4\n\n03:13 - Source: cnn\n\nGaza hospitals face critical lack of electricity, water and medical supplies, Health Ministry says\n\nHospitals in Gaza are facing dire conditions, with some operating without electricity, water and low levels of medical supplies, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave.\n\nThe situation is particularly critical at the Nasser medical complex in southern Gaza, the ministry said, adding that the hospital’s generator has stopped, the sewage network has broken down, water was cut off, and a lack of medical capabilities has hindered the facility’s work.\n\nIn northern Gaza, the Al-Awda Health and Community Association said that its hospital cannot carry out medical services due to the lack of medical supplies, warning of the possibility of a “complete cessation” of services in the next 48 hours.\n\nThe Israeli military is working on a way to get aid into northern Gaza “quickly,” an Israeli official told CNN earlier Tuesday. The Israel Defense Forces is working out where aid would cross into Gaza, the source said.\n\nDeath toll approaches 30,000: The total number of people killed in Gaza since October 7 is up to 29,878, with the number of injured reaching 70,215, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry.\n\nCNN cannot independently confirm the numbers due to the lack of international media access to Gaza.\n\nCNN’s Richard Allen Greene contributed reporting to this post.\n\nUSAID chief presses for more aid for Gazans and announces $53 million in new assistance\n\nThe top US humanitarian aid official on Tuesday called for additional assistance to be able to reach those inside of Gaza as she announced the United States will provide $53 million in additional humanitarian aid to the war-torn strip and the occupied West Bank.\n\nMuch of this aid will support food assistance, US Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Samantha Power said in an announcement, as more than 2 million people in Gaza are at “imminent risk” of famine.\n\nPower is slated to travel from Jordan to Israel and the West Bank as part of the effort to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza that is veering into catastrophe.\n\nUS officials have repeatedly said the amount of aid entering Gaza is not nearly enough. Last week, only 85 trucks a day were able to enter through the Rafah crossing, Power said, down from 500 before the conflict began.\n\nKeep reading about aid challenges in Gaza."
