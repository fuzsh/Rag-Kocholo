The Abraham Path is a long-distance cultural walking route following the footsteps and memory of Abraham across the Middle East. The Abraham Path celebrates the Abrahamic values of hospitality and kindness to strangers, provides economic benefits to local communities along the route. For more practical planning information, including downloadable companion GPS tracks and waypoints, visit www.abrahampath.org. \n \nThis map series is part of an effort by local partners and the Abraham Path Initiative to produce the first all-path online guidebook, covering over 1000 km of walking trail and Abrahamic memory and heritage across the Middle East. We invite you to take part in this project by walking the path, visiting communities along the way, and by providing comments and suggestions for improvement. These routes are still in development, and map feedback is especially helpful for name corrections (towns, wadis, landmarks), areas which are difficult to navigate, and updates on current path conditions (feedback@abrahampath.org).",
