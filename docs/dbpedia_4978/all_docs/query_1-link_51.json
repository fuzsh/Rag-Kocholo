As a starting point for this discussion, the authors of “Compressed Development: Time and Timing in Economic and Social Development,” published in fall 2020 by Oxford University Press, will provide a short summary of the book’s themes and arguments, followed by remarks from two discussants. The book defines Compressed Development in terms of two dynamics, played out in the context of state-society and organization-technology co-evolution: ‘time compression,’ referring to the secular tendency for more recent developers to progress faster than earlier developers; and ‘eras,’ referring to the more or less distinct historical periods in which development takes place, with the geopolitical, institutional, and technological characteristics of each era putting a stamp on the processes of development. The most recent, “compressed development” era (1990-2020) has been characterized by retreats by the state and civil society, financialization, computerization, and the rise of global value chains and the ‘network’ form of industrial organization (outsourcing and offshoring). In this era, global integration has been central to exacerbating inequality and uneven development both within and between nations, in part by contributing to weak, partial, or “thin industrialization” trajectories in recent developers. The authors and discussants will reflect how the dynamics of change identified in the book are likely to play out in a post-Covid, post-Trump era.\n\nModerator\n\nJason Jackson\n\nAuthors\n\nHugh Whittaker\n\nTim Sturgeon\n\nDiscussants\n\nEd Steinfeld\n\nGary Gereffi\n\nReimagining Skill and its Role in Job Quality\n\nThe skills “mismatch” explanation for rising inequality is under increased scrutiny, raising doubts about conventional claims that workers are held back because they lack in-demand skills or the right educational credential. But is the alternative to remove skills entirely from solutions to raise job quality standards? Or is it time to reimagine skill and how it gets used to rebuild institutional power in the US labor market? Professor Nichola Lowe’s new book Putting Skill to Work, and the manufacturing-focused intermediaries she features in it, will motivate this discussion about skills, job quality and the future of work with Paul Osterman, Livia Lam and Natasha Iskander.\n\nPanelists\n\nNichola Lowe\n\nPaul Osterman\n\nNatasha Iskander\n\nLivia Lam\n\nFriday, June 4\n\n9:00am-10:00am\n\nISA Research Sessions | Concurrent Sessions\n\nResearch Stream: Labor Markets, Organizations, & Employment Relations\n\nPanel Title: Labor Market Institutions and Outcomes\n\nChair: Maite Tapia (Michigan State University)\n\nPapers:\n\n“Employee Representation Institutions and Innovation - Disentangling the Effect of Legal and Voluntary Codetermination”, by Kornelius Kraft (TU Dortmund University) and Alexander Lammers (TU Dortmund University)\n\n“Unemployment and Unemployment Compensation under major structural breaks in US and UK Labor Markets”, by Anthony Andrews (Global Trade Research Institute)\n\n“Where is the Inspector?

We bring together a panel of leading experts on the topic to: 1) define a “drug shortage”, 2) articulate the underlying causes, and 3) propose solutions. The causes of drug shortages rest with both market-based incentives and public policy. As such, in addition to academics who study drug shortages, our panel includes a former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) employee who helped author its 2020 drug shortage report, and also includes the perspective of private sector players focused on reducing drug shortages.\n\nThis plenary will continue from 11-noon as a parallel session, focused on whether 'Buy America' is the answer to the drug resilience challenges.\n\nPanelists\n\nRena M.

The members of the panel come from different disciplines—economics, political science, international relations, robotics and engineering. What they have in common is having participated at some stage in their careers in MIT interdisciplinary research projects on industry, from Made in America (1998) to Production in the Innovation Economy (2013) to Work of the Future (2020). Their subsequent scholarly work reflects both contributions to the central questions of their own disciplines as well as to understanding of industry. By tracing individual research trajectories of 5 industry studies researchers across their work over 25 years, the panel explores how key disciplinary and industry questions get re-defined and evolve.\n\nPanelists\n\nBen Armstrong\n\nSuzanne Berger\n\nMichael J. Piore\n\nLindsay Sanneman\n\nRachel Wellhausen\n\nWorker Voice and Representation: Past, Present, and Future\n\nAs the U.S. economy comes back from the pandemic, and with a change of administration in Washington, government and firm policies on worker voice and representation are front and center. Our speakers have worked together on research about “what do workers want?” in terms of representation and have thought deeply about where policy needs to go. Tom Kochan will provide a quick historical tour of how the state of worker representation has changed over time and Maite Tapia and Suresh Naidu will provide their perspectives on the current state of research and policy issues. Together, in discussion with Rose Batt and John Paul MacDuffie, they will suggest where research on this moment’s crucial issues of worker voice might go in the future.\n\nPanelists\n\nThomas A.

In that same spirit, the ISA board developed a four-part webinar series featuring in-depth conversations with managers, executives and researchers to explore racial equity and opportunity in different industry contexts. In this open conversation, we will reflect on key ideas and themes that emerged from these webinars and consider how they may influence ongoing scholarly work and ISA’s future development.\n\nResearch Stream: Labor Markets, Organizations, & Employment Relations\n\nPanel Title: Human Resource Practices and Outcomes\n\nChair: Rosemary Batt (Cornell University)\n\nPapers:\n\n“Potential and the Gender Promotion Gap”, by Alan Benson (Univ of Minnesota Carlson School of Management), Danielle Li (MIT Sloan School of Management) and Kelly Shue (Yale School of Management)\n\n“Human resource practices, human capital, turnover and service quality: Evidence from social care”, by Andreas Kornelakis (King's College London) and Andreas Georgiadis (Brunel University)\n\n“The Relationship Among Computer Self-efficacy, Technology ance Model in AI Enabled Recruiting”, by Honghua Li (Morgan state university) and Samina Saifuddin (Morgan state university)\n\n“The effect of coworker exchanges on employee perceptions: A social Influence perspective of work-life initiatives”, by Yinyin Cao (University of Michigan – Dearborn), Frits Pil (University of Pittsburgh) and Benn Lawson (University of Cambridge)\n\nResearch Stream: Innovation and Entrepreneurship\n\nPanel Title: Global Innovation\n\nChair: Michael Murphree (University of South Carolina)\n\nPapers:\n\n“Is It about Family?
