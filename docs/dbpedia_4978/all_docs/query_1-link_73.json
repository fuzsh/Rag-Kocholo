        "text": "Synthesis\n\nReviewing Editor: Alexxai Kravitz, Washington University in St. Louis\n\nDecisions are customarily a result of the Reviewing Editor and the peer reviewers coming together and discussing their recommendations until a consensus is reached. When revisions are invited, a fact-based synthesis statement explaining their decision and outlining what is needed to prepare a revision will be listed below. The following reviewer(s) agreed to reveal their identity: Megan Fox.\n\nReviewer consensus statement of essential comments:\n\n1) The authors should clarify their reporting of the behavioral studies performed on the animals included in the Biobank. Figure 1A was confusing to the reviewers and would benefit from breaking the schematic into separate panels for the different behavioral tests that were run on different cohorts. Since behavioral characterizations also differed between the oxy and cocaine animals (along with the number of ShA training sessions, etc) it would be useful to create a separate panel for each drug. Figure 1A could also be combined/integrated with Figure 2, instead of with Figure 1B (see comment 2).\n\n2) Regarding Figure 1B, it would be helpful if this figure contained a summary of raw data/info on the animals in the Biobank. Researchers are likely to want to know the demographics (age, sex) of animals in the Biobank, as well as levels of lever-pressing and/or amount of drug intake that was achieved by animals in the Biobank, and not just the z-scores of their responding relative to the mean. Reporting variance in drug intake could also assist readers in understanding their ability to obtain data from escalators vs. non-escalators from the Biobank. While some of this information is in Table 1, a graphical summary would be more useful than the present data shown in Figure 1B.\n\nIn addition, it appears that data from cocaine and oxycodone self-administering rats were combined together in Figure 1B. As these drugs are of different classes and the addiction index is calculated from different behaviors, it is necessary to show data sets from each drug separately. Finally, the figure should employ a legend for what the light and dark blue bars represent. Breaking this analysis apart from Figure 1A and expanding it into its own figure may be a clearer way to present the information.\n\n3) It is not clear whether “age-matched control animals” (line 206) refer to littermates of the drug-exposed animals, or if these are from separate breeding pairs. Please clarify.\n\n4) There were several methodological details that were omitted from this manuscript and should be reported. See full reviewer comments on these below.\n\n5) A graphical abstract could enhance this paper.\n\n*******************************\n\nFull comments from Reviewer #1:\n\n*******************************\n\nThis manuscript has the potential to advance the field if more information about the recorded behaviors are provided by the authors in a revision. These collected samples are targeted for use in laboratories that would not otherwise be able to generate similar tissue sets. Additionally, as the authors ran both cocaine and oxycodone IV self-administration to produce comparable biobanks, samples from these biobanks have the potential to confer meaningful data about parallels between the two classes of drugs of abuse. However, as presented, this manuscript itself does not provide novel data to advance the field.\n\nMajor:\n\nThis manuscript introduces two biobanks that aim to expand the accessibility of tissue obtained following rat drug self-administration, which could benefit many researchers. However, as the two data panels (Figure 1b and Figure 3) presented are already published figures, the manuscript does not currently offer any novel data. As the authors have done a significant amount of work characterizing a variety of drug-related behaviors, displaying these data would allow for better transparency and provide further validity to the banked samples. There are many approaches that would achieve this point. For example:\n\n- Providing data related to average intake or responding across FR1 sessions is important for understanding the level of drug intake that was achieved in these studies. The authors could also replicate known effects, such as sex differences in intake/motivation.\n\n- Another benefit mentioned by the authors is the ability to detect individual differences. Examples of this from the recorded behaviors would greatly underscore the authors' points. For example, displaying data for escalators vs non-escalators in cocaine and oxycodone groups would supplement the authors' statements in the Results section.\n\n- Additionally, because the authors split rats into low and high addiction-like groups and state that this characterization is a major benefit of their biobank, percentages of rats that fall into each category (as well as \"neither\" if applicable) would be very helpful in displaying the distribution of phenotypes they have characterized.\n\nSecondly, data from cocaine and oxycodone self-administering rats appear to be combined together (as in Figure 1b). As these drugs are of different classes and the addiction index is calculated from different behaviors, it is necessary to show data sets from each drug separately.\n\nMinor:\n\nAbstract:\n\n- Quick text edit to clarify that self-administration is intravenous self-administration, as oxycodone can also be administered orally. This would also be helpful in the Introduction.\n\nMethods:\n\n- Clarification of timeline for terminal samples. Because there are a lot of different timepoints in this study, simply stating \"Rats are sacrificed at three different timepoints following the last long access session...\" would be beneficial.\n\n- It is unclear if all behavioral testing was completed in the terminal intoxication group due to the necessarily short window before sacrifice. If not, then the addiction index would not include all behaviors for the intoxication group. Please clarify this point.\n\n- Clarification of information for naive rats. Did naive rats self-administer saline and undergo all testing procedures? Currently, the text only states \"... or from naive rats\". Similarly, please clarify number of samples available from naive rats. Are these numbers included in the totals listed in Table 1?\n\nResults:\n\n- Please state drug doses. They are available in the extended methods but would be helpful to have stated in the results as well.\n\nFigure:\n\n- Please add times from the last long access session to Figure 2 to better display when terminal samples for the 3 groups were taken.\n\n*******************************\n\nFull comments from Reviewer #2:\n\n*******************************\n\nHere the authors describe the creation of a biobank containing numerous samples from rats trained to self-administer intravenous cocaine or oxycodone. The authors include males and females from the genetically diverse Heterogeneous Stock rats, and describe the process by which they characterize individual vulnerability to cocaine or oxycodone \"addiction-like\" behaviors. This will be a valuable resource for the addiction research community, particularly for those that lack the requisite tools, time, and space to perform long access self-administration experiments.\n\n1) I find the timeline diagram in Fig 1a to be particularly confusing with the symbols for behavioral testing. It would be helpful to detail the actual timelines of the various behavioral tests because, as represented in the figure, it is difficult to ascertain the interval between tests. Since some behavioral characterizations differ between oxy and cocaine (along with the number of ShA training sessions, etc) it may be useful to create a separate timeline figure for each drug.\n\n2) Please clarify if rats are also housed 2/cage after IV catheter implantation.\n\n3) Line 100: Each breeder pair contributes one male and one female to subsequent cocaine and oxycodone cohorts. Does this include drug-naive rats? i.e. are the \"age-matched control animals\" referenced on line 206 littermates of the drug-exposed animals, or from separate breeding pairs?\n\n4) Please clarify if the self-administration sessions take place during the light or dark cycle, especially since ZT differs between oxy and coc groups.\n\n5)Please revise extended data fig 2-1 caption to indicate the tissue punches are samples from dorsal BNST, not total BNST\n\n6) Line 296: revise to vulnerability and resilience to SUD-like behavior (or addiction-like behavior). Rats don't have substance use disorders.\n\n7)Line 299: I don't see why it is necessary to introduce the concept of personalized medicine when this is a biobank of rat tissue. Perhaps the authors mean to suggest that seq data from their biobank tissues will be a useful comparison for human GWAS and other human samples? Or informing personalized treatment [for humans]? They certainly can't implement personalized treatments for the rats.\n\nAuthor Response\n\nBlinded Point-by-point reply to all questions and concerns raised in the review process (attachment 1 of rebuttal letter)\n\nSynthesis of Reviews:\n\n1) The authors should clarify their reporting of the behavioral studies performed on the animals included in the Biobank. Figure 1A was confusing to the reviewers and would benefit from breaking the schematic into separate panels for the different behavioral tests that were run on different cohorts. Since behavioral characterizations also differed between the oxy and cocaine animals (along with the number of ShA training sessions, etc) it would be useful to create separate panels for each drug. Figure 1A may also be more appropriate to combine/integrate with Figure 2 instead of with Figure 1B (see comment 2).\n\nResponse: We appreciate this feedback on the figures and apologize that they were not clear before.\n\nTaking into account all this feedback and suggestions, Figure 1 was completely redesigned and merged with Figure 2 (in a new Figure 2). It now shows the sequence of the different behavioral tests and both longitudinal and terminal sampling, with additional details on the experimental protocols for cocaine and oxycodone separately. Moreover, the unclear symbols were replaced by wording to further help interpretability of the timeline.\n\n2) Regarding Figure 1B, it would be helpful if this figure contained a summary of raw data/info on the animals in the Biobank instead of the derived z-score metrics. Researchers are likely to want to know the demographics (age, sex) of animals in the Biobank, as well as levels of lever-pressing and/or amount of drug intake that was achieved by animals in the Biobank, and not just the z-scores of their responding relative to the mean. Reporting variance in drug intake could also assist readers in understanding their ability to obtain data from escalators vs. non-escalators from the Biobank. While some of this information is in Table 1, a graphical summary would be more useful than the present data shown in Figure 1B.\n\nResponse: To give the readers more insight in the behavioral responding of the diverse animals with raw data, we now present data on escalation, motivation and compulsivity or hyperalgesia obtained through self-administration under a fixed ratio, progressive ratio and with a contingent foot shock or Von Frey respectively, for one cohort (60 animals) of both the cocaine and oxycodone biobanks in a new Figure 3.\n\nTo help the reader understand the difference between animals with high and low addiction-like behaviors, we present the data with their variance following a median split of the addiction index. Additional information on the age of the rats at the different stages of the protocol was added in the legend of Figure 2 and the methods section.\n\nIn addition, it appears that data from cocaine and oxycodone self-administering rats were combined together in Figure 1B. As these drugs are of different classes and the addiction index is calculated from different behaviors, it is necessary to show data sets from each drug separately. Finally, the figure should employ a legend for what the light and dark blue bars represent. Breaking this analysis apart from Figure 1A and expanding it into its own figure may be a clearer way to present the information.\n\nResponse: The original Figure 1B only represented data from the oxycodone Biobank, we apologize that this was not clear and fully agree with the reviewers that oxycodone and cocaine data should not be combined. As the figures were fully reworked to address the comments above, new raw behavioral data from both the oxycodone and cocaine animals separately is represented in a new Figure 3. We also ensure that the new legend is fully explanatory of the different groups and colors. 3) It is not clear whether “age-matched control animals” (line 206) refer to littermates of the drug-exposed animals, or if these are from separate breeding pairs. Please clarify.2\n\nResponse: The age-matched naive control animals are both littermates of the drug-exposed animals or from separate breeding pairs. In fact, all drug-exposed animals (except a male and female sibling pair for the oxycodone and cocaine biobanks each) come from different breeding pairs to maximize genetic diversity for the following GWAS study. The age-matched naive control animals are thus similarly or more closely related to each other and the drug-exposed animals than the drug-exposed animals to themselves. We believe this breeding protocol and rat selection for the two biobanks was not clearly explained in the manuscript. To clarify, the methods section was extended to include some information from the supporting information and additional explanation on the breeding and selection was added.\n\nUnder animals: “To maximize genetic diversity, each breeder pair contributes only one male and one female to subsequent cocaine and oxycodone cohorts.” Under the new surgery section: “In each cohort, a number of rats were not surged and subsequently not exposed to drugs. These naive rats are from the same cohort (same or different breeder pairs) as the drug-exposed animals and are thus age-matched control animals.”\n\n4) There were several methodological details that were omitted from this manuscript and should be reported. See full reviewer comments on these below.\n\nResponse: The methodological details that were missing were added to the paper, as indicated in detail below. Moreover, the extended materials and methods was moved into the main text’s materials and method’s section, to help clarify the approach.\n\n5) A graphical abstract could enhance this paper.\n\nResponse: A graphical abstract was designed according to the guidelines and added in the upload to enhance the paper.\n\nFull comments from Reviewer #1:\n\nThis manuscript has the potential to advance the field if more information about the recorded behaviors are provided by the authors in a revision. These collected samples are targeted for use in laboratories that would not otherwise be able to generate similar tissue sets. Additionally, as the authors ran both cocaine and oxycodone IV self-administration to produce comparable biobanks, samples from these biobanks have the potential to confer meaningful data about parallels between the two classes of drugs of abuse.\n\nResponse: We thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation of our work and recognizing the value of our standardized behavioral characterization and generated Biobanks However, as presented, this manuscript itself does not provide novel data to advance the field.\n\nResponse: We apologize for focusing only on the novelty of the Biobanks as a resource in the first submission and added novel data according to the reviewer’s suggestions below for this resubmission.\n\nMajor:\n\nThis manuscript introduces two biobanks that aim to expand the accessibility of tissue obtained following rat drug self-administration, which could benefit many researchers. However, as the two data panels (Figure 1b and Figure 3) presented are already published figures, the manuscript does not currently offer any novel data. As the authors have done a significant amount of work characterizing a variety of drug-3 related behaviors, displaying these data would allow for better transparency and provide further validity to the banked samples. There are many approaches that would achieve this point. For example: - Providing data related to average intake or responding across FR1 sessions is important for understanding the level of drug intake that was achieved in these studies. The authors could also replicate known effects, such as sex differences in intake/motivation.\n\nResponse: We now present data in a new Figure 3 on escalation for a cohort of cocaine-administering animals and oxycodone-administering animals, which shows the intake achieved over the different sessions under FR1. We additionally provide data on motivation and compulsivity for cocaine administering animals or motivation and hyperalgesia for oxycodone-administering animals obtained through progressive ratio, FR1 with a contingent foot shock or Von Frey. To supplement the statements form the results section, as suggested by the reviewer in his next point, we decided to split up the animals according to Addiction Index into a group with high and low addiction-like behaviors, instead of according to sex. Note that a full paper is in preparation that will include all the cohorts and extended analysis of sex differences, estrus cycle, addiction index, and interaction between variables. The format of the eNeuro Resource manuscript would not be appropriate for such extended analysis. However, we have added a sentence with references in the discussion to highlight the fact that there are known sex difference in cocaine and oxycodone self-administration and that numerous biological and behavioral measures in the biobank (including self-administration) show sex-difference and that samples can be selected based on sex and estrus cycle to facilitate research on sex differences.\n\n\"Sex differences in cocaine and oxycodone intake have been identified using this model, as seen in human, with females appearing more vulnerable (Kimbrough et al., 2020; Ramôa et al., 2013; Roth and Carroll, 2004). Behavioral testing for the Biobank confirmed these findings with significant differences in escalation, intake, motivation and compulsivity. Samples can be selected based on sex and estrus cycle to facilitate research into these differences.”\n\n- Another benefit mentioned by the authors is the ability to detect individual differences. Examples of this from the recorded behaviors would greatly underscore the authors’ points. For example, displaying data for escalators vs non-escalators in cocaine and oxycodone groups would supplement the authors’ statements in the Results section.\n\nResponse: We really appreciate this suggestion from the reviewer to help illustrate and underscore our point on behavioral diversity in the HS rats. Therefore, we show the raw data added in the new Figure 3 with a median split according to the addiction index, to illustrate the significantly different behaviors of animals from the groups with high or low addiction-like behaviors.\n\n- Additionally, because the authors split rats into low and high addiction-like groups and state that this characterization is a major benefit of their biobank, percentages of rats that fall into each category (as well as “neither” if applicable) would be very helpful in displaying the distribution of phenotypes they have characterized.\n\nResponse: While several metrics are possible to characterize the animals based on the acquired behavioral data and the Biobank user’s application, our currently used metric is the Addiction Index. This is an averaged Z-score of relevant addiction-like behaviors for both drugs separately. Animals are then categorized as having high or low addiction-like behavior based on a median split (positive, high versus negative, low values for the Addiction Index). This means that representation in both groups is 50/50. The description of this process is improved, with inclusion of the use of a median split, to make this clear. 4\n\nSecondly, data from cocaine and oxycodone self-administering rats appear to be combined together (as in Figure 1b). As these drugs are of different classes and the addiction index is calculated from different behaviors, it is necessary to show data sets from each drug separately.\n\nResponse: As stated above, the interpretation that the data represents a combination of cocaine and oxycodone behavioral measures is a misunderstanding and we apologize for representing the data in such a way that led to this misunderstanding. In the new Figure 3 the results for the cocaine and oxycodone animals are both shown separately.\n\nMinor:\n\nAbstract:\n\n- Quick text edit to clarify that self-administration is intravenous self-administration, as oxycodone can also be administered orally. This would also be helpful in the Introduction.\n\nResponse: Self-administration was changed to intravenous self-administration at first mention in the abstract and introduction.\n\nMethods:\n\n- Clarification of timeline for terminal samples. Because there are a lot of different timepoints in this study, simply stating “Rats are sacrificed at three different timepoints following the last long access session...” would be beneficial.\n\nResponse: To improve understanding of when the different samples were collected, the description of the terminal samples in the method section was edited as suggested, by adding the statement and reformulating the description of the 3 timepoints: “After the last long access session and completing the behavioral characterization, rats are sacrificed at three different timepoints. 1) Intoxication: euthanasia is performed during the last self-administration session (after ∼2 h of drug access), 2) Acute withdrawal: euthanasia is performed 18 h (for cocaine) and 12 h (for oxycodone) after the end of the last self administration session, 3) Protracted abstinence: euthanasia is performed 4-5 weeks after the last self administration session.\n\n- It is unclear if all behavioral testing was completed in the terminal intoxication group due to the necessarily short window before sacrifice. If not, then the addiction index would not include all behaviors for the intoxication group. Please clarify this point.\n\nResponse: We apologize that this point was not clear. All animals go through the entire behavioral characterization protocol before sacrifice. After, the animals undergo one additional session with or without incubation to achieve a state of intoxication, withdrawal or abstinence in which they are sacrificed. The statement included for the previous comment should make this clear. Moreover, by reworking and merging figures 1 and 2 (in a new figure 2), the entire timeline should also be better illustrated and therefore easier to understand.\n\n- Clarification of information for naïve rats. Did naïve rats self-administer saline and undergo all testing procedures? Currently, the text only states “... or from naïve rats”. Similarly, please clarify number of samples available from naïve rats. Are these numbers included in the totals listed in Table 1?\n\nResponse: Additional information on the naive rats was included in response to the synthesis of review questions (see above). Naive rats were not surged, and thus did not self-administer drugs. They undergo the testing procedures that do not require the catheter (e.g. Von Frey or bottlebrush test). This is clarified 5 in the new method section in the main text under behavioral testing “Naive rats underwent the behavioral tests that did not require a catheter.”. The number of naive rats is included in the totals listed in Table 1, this and their contribution to the number of samples is clarified in the Table legend: “Samples from naive animals are included in the given number, they represent ∼ 20% of samples.”\n\nResults:\n\n- Please state drug doses. They are available in the extended methods but would be helpful to have stated in the results as well.\n\nResponse: The drug doses for cocaine and oxycodone are now stated in the results section too.\n\nFigure:\n\n- Please add times from the last long access session to Figure 2 to better display when terminal samples for the 3 groups were taken.\n\nResponse: As stated above, Figure 2 was incorporated into Figure 1 and completely reworked (into a new Figure 2), which helps to better display when terminal samples for the 3 groups were taken.\n\n*******************************\n\nFull comments from Reviewer #2:\n\n*******************************\n\nHere the authors describe the creation of a biobank containing numerous samples from rats trained to self administer intravenous cocaine or oxycodone. The authors include males and females from the genetically diverse Heterogeneous Stock rats, and describe the process by which they characterize individual vulnerability to cocaine or oxycodone “addiction-like” behaviors. This will be a valuable resource for the addiction research community, particularly for those that lack the requisite tools, time, and space to perform long access self-administration experiments.\n\nResponse: We thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation of our work and recognizing the value of our standardized behavioral characterization on male and female HS rats and generated Biobanks\n\n1) I find the timeline diagram in Fig 1a to be particularly confusing with the symbols for behavioral testing. It would be helpful to detail the actual timelines of the various behavioral tests because, as represented in the figure, it is difficult to ascertain the interval between tests. Since some behavioral characterizations differ between oxy and cocaine (along with the number of ShA training sessions, etc) it may be useful to create a separate timeline figure for each drug.\n\nResponse: We appreciate this feedback on the figure and apologize that this was not clear before. As stated above, Figure 1 was completely redesigned and merged with Figure 2 to make the timeline more clear (in a new Figure 2). It now shows the sequence of the different behavioral tests and additional details for both of the experimental protocols for cocaine and oxycodone.\n\n2) Please clarify if rats are also housed 2/cage after IV catheter implantation.\n\nResponse: Rats were indeed group-housed with 2/cage after IV catheter implantation. This was clarified in the methods section under animals, by including the statement “... for the rest of the experiment housed two per cage...”6\n\n3) Line 100: Each breeder pair contributes one male and one female to subsequent cocaine and oxycodone cohorts. Does this include drug-naïve rats? i.e. are the “age-matched control animals” referenced on line 206 littermates of the drug-exposed animals, or from separate breeding pairs? Response: Additional information on the naive rats was included in response to the synthesis of review question 3 (see above).\n\n4) Please clarify if the self-administration sessions take place during the light or dark cycle, especially since ZT differs between oxy and coc groups.\n\nResponse: The self-administration sessions (and all other behavioral tests) were performed in the dark cycle of the animals. The different light cycles of the cocaine and oxy animals, as mentioned in the methods section under animals, allowed for running them both during their own dark cycle in the same boxes during the day and night resp. This was clarified by adding a statement in the new material and methods section of the main manuscript under behavioral testing “All behavioral tests were performed in the dark cycle of the animals.”\n\n5) Please revise extended data fig 2-1 caption to indicate the tissue punches are samples from dorsal BNST, not total BNST\n\nResponse: The reviewer is correct, the revision has been made as suggested (in what is now figure 1).\n\n6) Line 296: revise to vulnerability and resilience to SUD-like behavior (or addiction-like behavior). Rats don’t have substance use disorders.\n\nResponse: The reviewer is right. SUD has been corrected to “SUD-like behavior”.\n\n7)Line 299: I don’t see why it is necessary to introduce the concept of personalized medicine when this is a biobank of rat tissue. Perhaps the authors mean to suggest that seq data from their biobank tissues will be a useful comparison for human GWAS and other human samples? Or informing personalized treatment [for humans]? They certainly can’t implement personalized treatments for the rats.\n\nResponse: The reviewer is right here too, obviously our aim is not to develop personalized treatments for the rats, but indeed informing personalized treatments for humans. This could be achieved by comparing the rat GWAS results with human GWAS or by identifying novel markers in rats that have been missed in human GWAS (due to limited number of samples, lack of longitudinal information, lack of controlled environment, trustworthiness of subjective reporting, etc.) that can then be translated to humans. We apologize that this might not have been clear and added “human” to the discussion, to make this clear"
