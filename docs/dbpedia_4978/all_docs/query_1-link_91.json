        "text": "Abraham Lincoln: American Lawyer-President\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDirck, Brian\n\n2009-01-01\n\nAbraham Lincoln was the most experienced trial lawyer Americans have ever placed in the White House. While more than half of the United State's presidents have been attorneys, none possessed Lincoln's extensive courtroom experience: approximately 3,800 known cases, litigated during a quarter century at the Illinois bar. However, the law'sâ¦\n\nAbraham Lincoln's Gettysburg illness.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoldman, Armond S; Schmalstieg, Frank C\n\n2007-05-01\n\nWhen Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address, he was weak and dizzy; his face had a ghastly colour. That evening on the train to Washington, DC, he was febrile and weak, and suffered severe headaches. The symptoms continued; back pains developed. On the fourth day of the illness, a widespread scarlet rash appeared that soon became vesicular. By the tenth day, the lesions itched and peeled. The illness lasted three weeks. The final diagnosis, a touch of varioloid, was an old name for smallpox that was later used in the 20th century to denote mild smallpox in a partially immune individual. It was unclear whether Lincoln had been immunized against smallpox. Indeed, this review suggests that Lincoln had unmodified smallpox and that Lincoln's physicians tried to reassure the public that Lincoln was not seriously ill. Indeed, the successful conclusion of the Civil War and reunification of the country were dependent upon Lincoln's presidency.\n\nAbraham Lincoln and the insanity plea.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpiegel, A D\n\n1994-06-01\n\nA confederate civilian physician shot and killed a white Union officer who was drilling Negro troops in Norfolk, Virginia. With no question as to guilt, President Abraham Lincoln decided to have a medical expert conduct a professional sanity/insanity examination. Documentation indicates that legal and political factors may have influenced Lincoln's decision. As a lawyer, Lincoln prosecuted a case where the insanity plea was used as a defense. Two influential Cabinet members, William H. Seward and Edwin M. Stanton, also had legal experience involving the insanity plea. Politically, Lincoln faced serious issues such as the draft riots, the military necessity to recruit slaves into the army, the impact of Union Negro soldiers upon the border states, the morale and discipline of the army and the upcoming presidential election. Upon Seward's recommendation, Lincoln chose a physician who had a reputation for finding the accused sane and who did so in this case. As the southern physician was hanged, Lincoln's means achieved the desired legal and political ends.\n\nThe Enigmatic Savior of the Union: Abraham Lincoln.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDiamond, Ronald L.; Diamond, Linda W.\n\nAbraham Lincoln rose from the depths of obscurity to guide the United States successfully through the turbulent and menacing years of the Civil War. Laborer, businessman, postmaster, politician, and lawyer were some of the vocations, not all successful, that Lincoln tried during the years leading to his ascent to the Presidency.

Psychotherapeutic metaphors, in their various versions, may offer new choices and ways of viewing oneself to the patient which are more palatable than straight discussions or sterile insights. By addressing resistances indirectly, metaphors can be an effective tool for the therapist to use, regardless of theoretical orientation. Abraham Lincoln, a master of metaphor, utilized this tool effectively in dealing with crises and the ultimate fragmentation, disunion of the national identity. The author argues that Lincoln was able to address complex issues (such as slavery, liberty, nationhood, union, and conduct of the war) with metaphors, much as a skilled psychotherapist addresses complex issues within his or her purview. Abraham Lincoln effectively disarmed his critics, established a means of communication with the people, and sought to make his points in an understandable nonconfrontational fashion. These are skills highly valued by psychotherapists. One might say that Abraham Lincoln conducted psychotherapy on a national scale. Without formal training, he was ultimately able to create a new and more stable sense of national self using a metaphorical approach.\n\nFamous Americans: George Washington & Abraham Lincoln.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFleming, Maria\n\nIntroducing students in grade 1-3 to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, this book presents thematic units that present biographical information, and literature links such as poems, songs, stories, cross-curricular activities, and hands-on reproducibles.

It has been suggested that Lincoln himself had the disease and that his DNA should be tested for an SCA5-conferring gene. Herein, I review the pertinent phenotypes of Lincoln, his father, and his paternal grandmother, and conclude that 1) Lincoln's father did not have SCA5, and, therefore, that Lincoln was not at special risk of the disease; 2) Lincoln had neither subclinical nor visible manifestations of SCA5; 3) little evidence suggests SCA5 is a \"Lincolnian\" disorder; and 4) without additional evidence, Lincoln's DNA should not be tested for SCA5.\n\nFamous Americans: George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFleming, Maria\n\nThis book provides background information and ideas for teaching about George Washington and Abraham Lincoln at the primary grade level.

In Lincoln's America, as in many developing nations today, sweeping economic change threatened older industries, traditional ways of living, and social and national cohesion by exposing economies and societies to new and powerful competitive forces. Yet even in the midst of the brutal and expensive American Civil war--and in part because of it--Lincoln and the Republican Congress enacted bold legislation that helped create a huge national market, a strong and unified economy governed by national institutions, and a rising middle class of businessmen and property owners. Figuring out how to maximize the benefits of globalization while minimizing its disruptions is a formidable challenge for policy makers. How do you expand opportunities for the talented and the lucky while making sure the rest of society doesn't fall behind? It may be helpful to look at the principles that informed the policies that Lincoln and the Republican Congress instituted after they came to power in 1861: Facilitate the upward mobility of low- and middle-income groups to give them a significant stake in the country. Emphasize the good of the national economy over regional interests. Affirm the need for sound government institutions to temper the dynamics of the free enterprise system. Tailor policies to the national situation. Realize that a period of turmoil may present a unique opportunity for reform. These principles drove the reforms that helped Americans cope with and benefit from rapid technological advances and the fast integration of the American economy in the nineteenth century. They may be instructive to today's policy makers who are struggling to help their own citizens integrate into the fast-changing global economy of the twenty-first century.\n\nAbraham Lincoln's blue pills. Did our 16th president suffer from mercury poisoning?\n\nPubMed\n\nHirschhorn, N; Feldman, R G; Greaves, I A\n\n2001-01-01\n\nIt is well known that Abraham Lincoln took a medicine called \"blue mass\" or \"blue pill,\" commonly prescribed in the 19th century. What is now hardly known is that the main ingredient of blue mass was finely dispersed elemental mercury. As his friends understood, mercury was often prescribed for melancholy or \"hypochondriasis,\" a condition Lincoln famously endured. Mercury in the form of the blue pill is a potential neurotoxin, which we have demonstrated by recreating and testing the recipe. We present the testimony of many of Lincoln's contemporaries to suggest that Lincoln suffered the neurobehavioural consequences of mercury intoxication but, perhaps crucial to history, before the main years of his presidency; he was astute enough to recognize the effects and stop the medication soon after his inauguration.\n\nUnilateral coronal craniosynostosis in Abraham Lincoln and his family.\n\nPubMed\n\nFishman, Ronald S\n\n2010-09-01\n\nPremature closure of one coronal skull suture produces a characteristic arching or relative elevation of the superior orbital rim on the involved side. This sign is associated with facial asymmetry, and both signs are usually the most conspicuous features in patients with mild unilateral coronal craniosynostosis. Photographs suggest that at least 9 individuals over 5 generations of the Abraham Lincoln family had premature closure of 1 coronal suture. In 8 males, there was involvement of the left side; in 1 female, there was involvement of the right side.\n\nAbraham Lincoln and Harry Potter: Children's Differentiation between Historical and Fantasy Characters\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCorriveau, Kathleen H.; Kim, Angie L.; Schwalen, Courtney E.; Harris, Paul L.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBased on the testimony of others, children learn about a variety of figures that they never meet.

Nearly 100,000 documents have been discovered in the archives of local, county, state, federal courts, libraries, and other repositories. The documents include detailed information about theâ¦\n\nAbraham Lincoln's marfanoid mother: the earliest known case of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B?\n\nPubMed\n\nSotos, John G\n\n2012-07-01\n\nThe nature and cause of President Abraham Lincoln's unusual physical features have long been debated, with the greatest attention directed at two monogenic disorders of the transforming growth factor Î² system: Marfan syndrome and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B. The present report examines newly discovered phenotypic information about Lincoln's biological mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln, and concludes that (a) Lincoln's mother was skeletally marfanoid, (b) the President and his mother were highly concordant for the presence of numerous facial features found in various transforming growth factor Î² disorders, and (c) Lincoln's mother, like her son, had hypotonic skeletal muscles, resulting in myopathic facies and 'pseudodepression'. These conclusions establish that mother and son had the same monogenic autosomal dominant marfanoid disorder. A description of Nancy Hanks Lincoln as coarse-featured, and a little-known statement that a wasting disease contributed to her death at age 34, lends support to the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B hypothesis.\n\nThe role of Abraham Lincoln in securing a charter for a homeopathic medical college.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpiegel, Allen D; Kavaler, Florence\n\n2002-10-01\n\nIn 1854, Abraham Lincoln was retained to prepare a state legislative proposal to charter a homeopathic medical college in Chicago. This was a complex task in view of the deep-seated animosity between allopathic or orthodox medical practitioners and irregular healers. Homeopathy was regarded as a cult by the nascent American Medical Association. In addition, the poor reputation of medical education in the United States in general, further complicated the project. Lincoln and influential individuals in Illinois lobbied legislators and succeeded in securing the charter. Subsequently, the Hahnemann Homeopathic Medical College accepted its first class in 1860 and with its successors remained in existence for almost sixty-five years.\n\nAbraham Lincoln loses a medical malpractice case, debates Stephen A. Douglas, and secures two murder acquittals.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpiegel, Allen D; Kavaler, Florence\n\n2004-02-01\n\nAn improperly healed fracture was the most common reason for the medical malpractice crisis between the 1830s and 1860s in the United States. As a practicing lawyer in Illinois, Abraham Lincoln defended physicians in medical malpractice law suits. One of these was Dr. Powers Ritchey, who was sued for malpractice in 1855. Lincoln agreed to represent Dr. Ritchey in 1858 as the case was appealed to the supreme court of Illinois. In the interim, Lincoln defended two indicted murderers and won acquittals for both. Between the two murder trials, Lincoln debated Stephen A. Douglas while running for U.S. Senator from Illinois. Lincoln believed that Ritchey's case was poorly represented in the lower court. Ritchey's prior attorneys did not file a bill of exceptions to the testimony of the plaintiff's expert medical witnesses. Lincoln attempted to rebut the allegation of a lack of reasonable medical care and diligence by Ritchey, and he sought to secure a new trial for his client. In its decision, the supreme court of Illinois did not find any error and affirmed the lower court's judgment.\n\nWas Abraham Lincoln gay?\n\nPubMed\n\nFerguson, Michael\n\n2010-01-01\n\nScholars and historians are blind to Lincoln's same-sex inclinations in part because of a personal aversion to male homosexuality, but more importantly because they fail to perceive the vast differences between the sexual culture of antebellum America and that of our own time, especially in regard to male-male physical and emotional intimacy. This article brings those differences to light and sets Lincoln's life in the context of the sexual culture of his own time. This enables one to see that Lincoln's same-sex sexuality was not only unproblematic, but commonplace, if not typical, in his day. Revising the Myth of Lincoln in regard to his same-sex inclinations will have a positive effect on contemporary culture, especially on the education and socialization of young boys.\n\n3 CFR 8636 - Proclamation 8636 of March 4, 2011. 150th Anniversary of the Inauguration of Abraham Lincoln\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2012 CFR\n\n2012-01-01\n\n...

A novel tool for laparoscopy aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln.\n\nPubMed\n\nCubano, M; Poulose, B K; Talamini, M A; Stewart, R; Antosek, L E; Lentz, R; Nibe, R; Kutka, M F; Mendoza-Sagaon, M\n\n1999-07-01\n\nAs general surgeons perform a growing number of laparoscopic operations in increasingly specialized environments, the ability to obtain expert advice during procedures becomes more important. Technological advances in video and computer communications are enabling surgeons to procure expertise quickly and efficiently. In this article, we present laparoscopic procedures completed through an intercontinental telementoring system and the first telementored laparoscopic procedures performed aboard a naval vessel. Video, voice, and data streams were linked between the USS Abraham Lincoln Aircraft Carrier Battlegroup cruising the Pacific Ocean and locations in Maryland and California, creating the Battlegroup Telemedicine (BGTM) system. Three modes of BGTM communication were used: intraship, ship to ship, and ship to shore. Five laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs were completed aboard the Lincoln under telementoring guidance from land-based surgeons thousands of miles away. In addition, the BGTM system proved invaluable in obtaining timely expertise on a wide variety of surgical and medical problems that would otherwise have required a shore visit. Successful intercontinental laparoscopic telementoring aboard a naval vessel was accomplished using \"off-the-shelf\" components. In many instances, the high risk and cost of transporting patients to land-based facilities was averted because of the BGTM system. Also, the relationship between the on-site and telementoring surgeon was critical to the success of this experiment. Long-distance telementoring is an invaluable tool in providing instantly available expertise during laparoscopic procedures.\n\nAbraham Lincoln and Harry Potter: children's differentiation between historical and fantasy characters.\n\nPubMed\n\nCorriveau, Kathleen H; Kim, Angie L; Schwalen, Courtney E; Harris, Paul L\n\n2009-11-01\n\nBased on the testimony of others, children learn about a variety of figures that they never meet. We ask when and how they are able to differentiate between the historical figures that they learn about (e.g., Abraham Lincoln) and fantasy characters (e.g., Harry Potter). Experiment 1 showed that both younger (3- and 4-year-olds) and older children (5-, 6-, and 7-year-olds) understand the status of familiar figures, correctly judging historical figures to be real and fictional figures to be pretend. However, when presented with information about novel figures embedded in either a realistic narrative or a narrative with obvious fantasy elements, only older children used the narrative to make an appropriate assessment of the status of the protagonist. In Experiment 2, 3-, and 4-year-olds were prompted to judge whether the story events were really possible or not. Those who did so accurately were able to deploy that judgment to correctly assess the status of the protagonist.\n\nPresident Lincoln and His Vice-Presidents.

This article reviews the historical findings and provides a specific diagnosis. Previous reports of symptoms and history relating to Lincoln's left hypertropia were reviewed. A series of photographs were reviewed. Lincoln's own description of his symptoms is provided. Previous history indicates an intermittent left hypertropia. A family history of vertical strabismus was noted with regard to Mr Lincoln's cousin. There also is a history of trauma to the left frontal area and life-mask evidence of fracture over the left eye. The findings include a history of head tilt and diplopia, presumably most readily in downgaze. Given the history and findings, the diagnosis of left superior oblique paresis of either congenital or traumatic origin seems appropriate.\n\nLincoln Era Essay Contest: Seventh Annual Winners, 1988.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCagle, William, Ed.\n\nThe seventh annual Lincoln Era Essay Contest's theme was \"Lincoln and the Elections of 1860 and 1864.\" The contest was open to students in grades 6 through 12 throughout the state of Indiana.

On April 14, 1865, shortly after his re-election and the conclusion of the Civil War, Lincoln was shot and killed by John Wilkes Booth. Although numerous physicians tended to the President shortly after his injury, he passed away the next morning. Today, we recognize Lincoln as one of the greatest Presidents in American history. His assassination profoundly influenced the future of the United States, especially as the country was coming back together again following the Civil War. Testaments to his lasting legacy can be seen in many places, from the stone carving of him on Mount Rushmore to his image gracing the $5 bill. What if the President had survived his injury? Would he have had a different outcome utilizing current critical care treatment? Neurotrauma care in 1865 was not yet developed, and head wounds such as the one Lincoln sustained were almost always fatal. The medical attention he received is considered by historians and physicians today to be excellent for that time. We look at the evolution of neurotrauma care during the last 150 years in the US. Particular focus is paid to the advancement of care for penetrating brain injuries in modern trauma centers. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In a rare appearance as a prosecutor, Abraham Lincoln tried the case for the State of Illinois. Expert medical witnesses testified about the side effects of chloroform and chloroform-induced insanity. Significantly, Lincoln was not knowledgeable about medical jurisprudence and overlooked potential sources of evidence and expert witnesses. Defence lawyers presented an impressive array of physicians to testify about insanity, about chloroform and about the results of an overdosage during anaesthesia. Considering the state of scientific knowledge at the time, the trial was notable.\n\nA. Lincoln, esquire defends the murderer of a physician.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpiegel, Allen D; Kavaler, Florence\n\n2005-08-01\n\nAfter only about a year of law practice, Abraham Lincoln participated in his first murder trial. Dr. Jacob M. Early was shot and killed in a bitter political imbroglio. Lincoln joined a defense team of highly accomplished litigators. Despite his having the least legal experience, he was selected to give the defense summation. In his argument, he spoke to the jury in a conversational tone making his point that Dr. Early had a deadly weapon in his hands, namely an upraised wooden chair, when he was shot. His self-defense plea indicated that Henry B. Truett, the defendant, truly believed that he was in danger of being crushed by the upraised chair. Interestingly, Lincoln knew both the defendant and the murdered physician. He handled litigation for the former and served in the Black Hawk War under the command of the latter. Furthermore Lincoln knew at least five of the jurors.\n\nAbraham Lincoln's suit against a medical imposter who assaulted his client.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpiegel, A D; Kavaler, F\n\n2001-10-01\n\nIn 1851, A. Lincoln, Esquire represented Edward Jones who charged in a law suit that his attending physician had assaulted him. Jones, also a lawyer, had sharply questioned Dr. Joseph S. Maus about his claims of attendance and graduation from Philadelphia's Jefferson Medical College, an allopathic medical school. Jones claimed that Maus became enraged at his persistent questioning and attacked him. In turn, Maus denied the allegation. He said that he was merely defending himself from Jones' blows with a large cane. Lincoln's legal approach was to argue about the state of medical education and whether Maus had really graduated from Jefferson Medical College. Acting as a peacemaker, he finally arranged to settle the dispute between Jones and Maus out of court.\n\nLincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858 Forced New Role on the Press.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nReilly, Tom\n\n1979-01-01\n\nFocuses on the 1858 election campaign in which Abraham Lincoln opposed Stephen A.

The program was launched at the 1937 Annual Meeting of the APA in a session chaired by Clark L. Hull, and the experiments continued through 1941, when the United States entered the Second World War. In an effort to apply the findings from animal experiments to the war situation, John Dollard and Neal E. Miller decided to study soldiers' fear reactions in combat. As a first step, they arranged interviews with a few veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Taking these interviews as a point of departure, Dollard devised a questionnaire to which 300 former Lincoln brigaders responded. The present paper analyzes the main outcomes of the questionnaire, together with the war experiences reported in the interview transcripts. Our purpose was to evaluate a project which was initially investigated by the FBI because of the communists among the Lincoln ranks, but eventually supported by the American Army, and which exerted great influence on the military psychology of the time.\n\n\"What an Affliction\": Mary Todd Lincoln's Fatal Pernicious Anemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nSotos, John G\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo date, no single diagnosis has unified the psychiatric illness and the numerous poorly defined physical complaints that Mary Lincoln (nÃ©e Todd, 1818-1882) suffered in adulthood. Here, I show that her physical ailments spanned 30 years and included sore mouth, pallor, paresthesias, the Lhermitte symptom, fever, headaches, fatigue, resting tachycardia, edema, episodic weight loss, progressive weakness, ataxia, and visual impairment. Long thought hypochondriacal, these findings, plus their time course and her psychopathology (irritability, delusions, hallucinations, with preserved clarity), are all consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency. Pernicious anemia most probably caused this deficiency: she lacked risk factors for other causes, and her consanguineous parents both derived from a region of Scotland having a high incidence of pernicious anemia. A diagnosis of chronic multisystem pernicious anemia would clarify the conduct of Mary Lincoln as First Lady and widow, and illuminate challenges faced by her husband, President Abraham Lincoln. Her case highlights many forgotten features of the natural history of untreated pernicious anemia and is unique in the medical literature in demonstrating such a course extending over a lifetime.\n\nDarwin and Lincoln: their legacy of human dignity.\n\nPubMed\n\nEarls, Felton\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe legacy of Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln is to champion the dignity inherent in every human being. The moment of the bicentennial of their births provides an opportunity to celebrate and reflect on ways they have shaped our understanding and commitment to human rights. The naturalist and the constitutional lawyer, so different in circumstance and discipline, were morally allied in the mission to eradicate slavery. The profound lessons to be extracted from the lives of these two icons bind us to the agonizing reality that nearly 150 years after Gettysburg and the publication of the Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, there remains much work to do toward advancing the security, respect, and equality of our species. This article describes how Darwin and Lincoln's inspiring legacies guided the author's personal choices as a scientist and activist. The essay concludes with a set of questions and challenges that confront us, foremost among which is the need to balance actions in response to the violation of negative rights by actions in the pursuit of positive rights.\n\nIndustrial Fire Brigade Training.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNorth Carolina State Dept. of Community Colleges, Raleigh.\n\nOrganized as a teaching outline for an industrial plant fire brigade course, this manual contains a rationale for an industrial plant brigade as an adjunct to the local firefighting services; information to the instructor concerning the implementation of an industrial fire brigade program; and a teaching outline consisting of eleven sections: (1)â¦\n\nGood Samaritan surgeon wrongly accused of contributing to President Lincoln's death: an experimental study of the President's fatal wound.\n\nPubMed\n\nLattimer, J K; Laidlaw, A\n\n1996-05-01\n\nWhen President Abraham Lincoln was shot in the back of the head at Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C., on April 14, 1865, he was immediately rendered unconscious and apneic. Doctor Charles A. Leale, an Army surgeon, who had special training in the care of brain injuries, rushed to Lincoln's assistance. When Doctor Leale probed the wound in Lincoln's thickened scalp, feeling for the bullet, he dislodged a blood clot, and Lincoln began to breathe again. However, Lincoln progressively deteriorated and died at 7:22 AM on April 15, 1865. During the postmortem examination of Lincoln's body, numerous secondary missiles of bone and metal were found in the track of pultaceous brain tissue, extending completely through the brain to the front of the skull. In February 1995, an article in a popular magazine alleged that Doctor Leale had caused further (fatal) damage to Lincoln's brain by thrusting his finger into the brain through the bullet hole. The article alleged (wrongly) that most bullet wounds of the brain incurred in Civil War times were not fatal. The following study demonstrates that it is impossible to introduce even the tip of the little finger through a hole in the skull resulting from a .41-caliber bullet fired from a derringer. In our study, a .41-caliber derringer was used to fire bullets into numerous fresh skulls; the bullet holes all had razor-sharp edges and were much too small to accommodate a fingertip. Thus, the allegation that President Lincoln's brain was damaged further because Doctor Leale thrust his finger through the bullet hole into the brain parenchyma is not valid. In this study, experimental data are presented to demonstrate the foregoing point. The wound made by John Wilkes Booth's derringer ball in Lincoln's brain was devastating; it was clearly the cause of his death. Good Samaritan surgeon Leale has been falsely accused of contributing to Lincoln's death.\n\nObituary: Jeannette Virginia Lincoln, 1915-2003\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCoffey, Helen E.\n\n2004-12-01\n\nJ. (Jeannette) Virginia Lincoln died on 1 August 2003 of natural causes at age 87. She was a pioneer in space weather forecasting and was instrumental in establishing the World Data Center-A for Solar-Terrestrial Physics (WDC-A for STP) at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC). Lincoln received a U.S. Department of Commerce Gold Medal for Distinguished Service in 1973 for outstanding accomplishments and leadership. She was elected a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a Fellow of the Society of Women Engineers. A physicist, she served as Division Chief of the Solar-Terrestrial Physics Division (STPD) and Director of WDC-A for STP from 1966 until her retirement in 1980. Virginia was born on Labor Day, 7 September 1915, in Ames, Iowa, to Rush B. Lincoln and Jeannette Bartholomew Lincoln. Her father, Rush B. Lincoln (b. 1881, d. 1977 at age 95), served as a Major General in the U.S. Air Force. He was a direct descendant of the brother of President Abraham Lincoln. Her mother Jeannette Bartholomew Lincoln (d. 1986 at age 104) taught Chemistry at Iowa State University. Her brother, Rush B. Lincoln, Jr. (d. 2002), was five years older. Her grandfather Lincoln fought in the Civil War as a Confederate Captain. Virginia was immersed in military life and continued many contacts and visited military installations throughout her life. Her parents lived with her until their deaths. She enjoyed the perks of being a General's daughter, actively participating in her parent's lives, and served as caregiver in their declining years. Influenced by her Army background, she developed a strong assertive personality and good problem-solving capabilities. She received a bachelor's degree in physics from Wellesley College in 1936 and a master's degree from Iowa State University in 1938. She was an instructor in household equipment at Iowa State from\n\n[Salzburg 1908.

Rev. Lett.100 160501). Due to a result of Regev and Schiff (ICALP â08 733), we show that for a class of error models the error rate per gate in the bucket brigade quantum memory has to be of order o({2}-n/2) (where N={2}n is the size of the memory) whenever the memory is used as an oracle for the quantum searching problem. We conjecture that this is the case for any realistic error model that will be encountered in practice, and that for algorithms with super-polynomially many oracle queries the error rate must be super-polynomially small, which further motivates the need for quantum error correction. By contrast, for algorithms such as matrix inversion Harrow et al (2009 Phys. Rev. Lett.103 150502) or quantum machine learning Rebentrost et al (2014 Phys. Rev. Lett.113 130503) that only require a polynomial number of queries, the error rate only needs to be polynomially small and quantum error correction may not be required. We introduce a circuit model for the quantum bucket brigade architecture and argue that quantum error correction for the circuit causes the quantum bucket brigade architecture to lose its primary advantage of a small number of âactiveâ gates, since all components have to be actively error corrected.\n\n76 FR 31364 - Agency Information Collection Activities; Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Fire Brigades\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-05-31\n\n... for OMB Review; Comment Request; Fire Brigades ACTION: Notice.

V.; Nesterenko, A. V.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nIn the general setting of the problem, the explicit compact formulae are derived for the ponderomotive forces in the macroscopic electrodynamics of moving media in the Minkowski and Abraham approaches. Taking account of the Minkowski constitutive relations and making use of a special representation for the Abraham energy-momentum tensor enable one to obtain a compact expression for the Abraham force in the case of arbitrary dependence of the medium velocity on spatial coordinates and the time and for nonstationary external electromagnetic field. We term the difference between the ponderomotive forces in the Abraham and Minkowski approaches as the Abraham force not only under consideration of media at rest but also in the case of moving media. The Lorentz force is found which is exerted by external electromagnetic field on the conduction current in a medium, the covariant Ohm law, and the constitutive Minkowski relations being taken into account. The physical argumentation is traced for the definition of the 4-vector of the ponderomotive force as the 4-divergence of the energy-momentum tensor of electromagnetic field in a medium.\n\nMIT Lincoln Laboratory Facts 2013\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2012-12-01\n\nefforts span all network layers (from physical to application), with primary focuses on radio - frequency (RF) military satellite communications (MILSATCOM...upgrade, Kwajalein Atoll â â Extremely high- frequency submarine communications demonstrated â â Lincoln Experimental Satellites 8 and 9 Overview 5...Immersive Surveillance â â Lincoln Adaptable Real-time Information Assurance Testbed â â Graph detection algorithms â â Miniaturized radio - frequency\n\nReexamination of the Abraham-Minkowski dilemma\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSilveirinha, MÃ¡rio G.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nHere the Abraham-Minkowski controversy on the correct definition of the light momentum in a macroscopic medium is revisited with the purpose to highlight that an effective medium formalism necessarily restricts the available information on the internal state of a system, and that this is ultimately the reason why the dilemma has no universal solution. Despite these difficulties, it is demonstrated that in the limit of no material absorption and under steady-state conditions, the time-averaged light (kinetic) momentum may be unambiguously determined by the Abraham result, both for bodies at rest and for circulatory flows of matter. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of quantum optics of moving media, and we examine in detail the fundamental role of the Minkowski momentum in such a context.\n\n77 FR 45985 - Proposed Amendment of Class E Airspace; Lincoln, ME\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-08-02\n\n...-0764; Airspace Docket No. 12-ANE-12] Proposed Amendment of Class E Airspace; Lincoln, ME AGENCY... action proposes to amend Class E Airspace at Lincoln, ME, as the Lincoln Non-Directional Radio Beacon..., Lincoln, ME.

S. Oliveira\n\n2017-04-01\n\nWe use an extended version of electrodynamics, which admits the existence of magnetic charges and currents, to discuss how different models for electric and magnetic dipoles do or do not carry hidden momentum under the influence of external electromagnetic fields. Based on that, we discuss how the models adopted for the electric and magnetic dipoles from the particles that compose a material medium influence the expression for the electromagnetic part of the light momentum in the medium. We show that Abraham expression is compatible with electric dipoles formed by electric charges and magnetic dipoles formed by magnetic charges, while Minkowski expression is compatible with electric dipoles formed by magnetic currents and magnetic dipoles formed by electric currents. The expression É0E ÃB , on the other hand, is shown to be compatible with electric dipoles formed by electric charges and magnetic dipoles formed by electric currents, which are much more natural models. So this expression has an interesting interpretation in the Abraham-Minkowski debate about the momentum of light in a medium: It is the expression compatible with the nonexistence of magnetic charges. We also provide a simple justification of why Abraham and Minkowski momenta can be associated with the kinetic and canonical momentum of light, respectively.\n\nNon-polynomial extensions of solvable potentials Ã la Abraham-Moses\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOdake, Satoru; Sasaki, Ryu; Center for Theoretical Sciences, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10617, Taiwan\n\n2013-10-15\n\nAbraham-Moses transformations, besides Darboux transformations, are well-known procedures to generate extensions of solvable potentials in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. Here we present the explicit forms of infinitely many seed solutions for adding eigenstates at arbitrary real energy through the Abraham-Moses transformations for typical solvable potentials, e.g., the radial oscillator, the Darboux-PÃ¶schl-Teller, and some others. These seed solutions are simple generalisations of the virtual state wavefunctions, which are obtained from the eigenfunctions by discrete symmetries of the potentials. The virtual state wavefunctions have been an essential ingredient for constructing multi-indexed Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials through multiple Darboux-Crum transformations.

We prospectively assessed the cost effectiveness of a pediatric neurosurgical brigade to Guatemala City, Guatemala. Data were collected on a weeklong annual pediatric neurosurgical brigade to Guatemala. Disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted were the metric of surgical effectiveness. Cost data included brigade expenses, as well as all costs incurred by the local health care system and patient families. During the mission, 17 pediatric neurosurgical interventions were performed. Conditions these patients suffered would result in 382 total DALYs. Using conservative values of surgical effectiveness, procedures performed averted 138.1 DALYs. Although all operative and postoperative costs were covered by the visiting surgical team, patients spent an average of $226 in U.S. dollars for preoperative workup, travel, food/lodging, and lost wages (range, $36-$538). The local health care system absorbed a total cost of $12,910. Complete mission costs were $53,152, for a cost effectiveness of $385 per DALY averted. To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating cost effectiveness of a short-term neurosurgical brigade. Although surgical intervention is acknowledged as playing a crucial role in global health, subspecialty surgical care is still broadly perceived as a luxury. Although providing care through local surgeons is undeniably more efficient than bringing in foreign medical teams, such care is not universally available. This study argues that volunteer neurosurgical teams can provide high complexity care with a competitive cost-effective profile. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

To improve population health, a number of volunteer medical brigades from developed countries provide health services in Honduras. To date, there is little information on the brigades' activities and impact. The primary objective of this article is to increase understanding of the type of health care provided by voluntary medical brigades by evaluating and presenting data on patients' presenting symptoms, diagnoses, and care outcomes. The article focuses on an ongoing medical brigade organized by Canadian health professionals in conjunction with Honduras' largest national non-governmental organization. This is a descriptive study of data that are routinely collected by volunteer Canadian health care professionals. Data on all patients presenting to temporary primary health care facilities across Honduras between 2006 and 2009 were analyzed. The data were used to analyze patient demographics, presenting symptoms, diagnoses, and treatments. We found that the brigades provide additional human resources to the relatively weak Honduran health care system. However, while brigades may increase solidarity between Hondurans and Canadians, concerns persist regarding cost-effectiveness and continuity of care for conditions treated by short-term brigade volunteers. Greater scrutiny is needed to increase brigades' effectiveness and ensure they are supportive of domestic health systems.\n\nUnclassified Publications of Lincoln Laboratory.

Until now, the intercept in these equations was determined by fitting experimental data. To simplify the determination of the coefficients in Abraham solvation equations, this study derives theoretical expressions for the value of the intercept for various partition processes. To that end, a modification of the description of the Ben-Naim standard state into the van der Waals volume is proposed. Differences between predicted and fitted values of the Abraham solvation equation intercept for the enthalpy of solvation, the entropy of solvation, solvent-water partitioning, air-solvent partitioning, partitioning into micelles, partitioning into lipid membranes and lipids, and chromatographic retention indices are comparable to experimental uncertainties in these values.

The key water bodies were a stock pond, representing possible nonpoint agricultural effects on water quality; an ephemeral stream, representing the water quality of drainage from forested areas of the park; parking-lot runoff, representing water quality related to roads and parking lots; an unnamed ditch below the parking lot, representing the water quality of drainage from the parking lot and from an adjacent railroad track; and Lincoln Spring, a historical ground-water source representing ground-water conditions near a former diesel-fuel-spill site along a rail line. Water samples were analyzed for pH, temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen and for concentrations of selected major ions and trace metals, nutrients, organic constituents, and Escherichia coli bacteria. Surface-water-quality data of water samples from the park represent baseline conditions for the area in relation to the data available from previous studies of area streams. Specific-conductance values and concentrations of most major ions and various nutrients in surface-water samples from the park were smaller than those reported for samples collected in other USGS studies in areas adjacent to the park. Water-quality-management issues identified by this investigation include potentially impaired water quality from parking-lot runoff, unknown effects on surface-water quality from adjacent railroads, and the potential impairment of water quality in Lincoln Spring from human influences. Parking-lot runoff is a source of calcium, alkalinity, iron, lead, and organic carbon in the water samples from the unnamed ditch. Detection of small concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in water from Lincoln Spring could indicate residual contamination from a 1995 diesel-fuel spill and cleanup\n\nCounter-Improvised Explosive Device Fusion Cells and the Brigade Combat Team: A Modern Day Imperative\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2013-12-10\n\nCenter Observer Controller/Trainer Mentors.

Our purpose with this paper is to highlight some developments of radiation pressure physics in general, and thereafter to focus on the importance of the mentioned experiments in regard to the classic Abraham-Minkowski problem. That means, what is the âcorrectâ expression for electromagnetic momentum density in continuous matter. In our opinion, one often sees that authors over-interpret the importance of their experimental findings with respect to the momentum problem. Most of these experiments are actually unable to discriminate between these energy-momentum tensors at all, since they can be easily described in terms of force expressions that are common for Abraham and Minkowski. Moreover, we emphasize the inherent ambiguity in applying the formal conservation principles to the radiation field in a dielectric, the reason being that the electromagnetic field in matter is only a subsystem which has to be supplemented by the mechanical subsystem to be closed. Finally, we make some suggestions regarding the connection between macroscopic electrodynamics and the Casimir effect, suggesting that there is a limit for the magnitudes of the cutoff parameters in QFT related to surface tension in ordinary hydromechanics.\n\n75 FR 17832 - Pricing for 2010 Lincoln One-Cent Coin Two-Roll Set\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-04-07\n\n...

A method is presented for computing the necessary chemical parameters, the Abraham parameters (AP), used by many pp-LFERs. It employs quantum chemical calculations and uses only the chemical's molecular structure. The method computes the Abraham E parameter using density functional theory computed molecular polarizability and the Clausius-Mossotti equation relating the index refraction to the molecular polarizability, estimates the Abraham V as the COSMO calculated molecular volume, and computes the remaining AP S, A, and B jointly with a multiple linear regression using sixty-five solvent-water partition coefficients computed using the quantum mechanical COSMO-SAC solvation model. These solute parameters, referred to as Quantum Chemically estimated Abraham Parameters (QCAP), are further adjusted by fitting to experimentally based APs using QCAP parameters as the independent variables so that they are compatible with existing Abraham pp-LFERs. QCAP and adjusted QCAP for 1827 neutral chemicals are included. For 24 solvent-water systems including octanol-water, predicted log solvent-water partition coefficients using adjusted QCAP have the smallest root-mean-square errors (RMSEs, 0.314-0.602) compared to predictions made using APs estimated using the molecular fragment based method ABSOLV (0.45-0.716). For munition and munition-like compounds, adjusted QCAP has much lower RMSE (0.860) than does ABSOLV (4.45) which essentially fails for these compounds.\n\nLincoln estimates of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) abundance in North America.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlisauskas, Ray T; Arnold, Todd W; Leafloor, James O; Otis, David L; Sedinger, James S\n\n2014-01-01\n\nEstimates of range-wide abundance, harvest, and harvest rate are fundamental for sound inferences about the role of exploitation in the dynamics of free-ranging wildlife populations, but reliability of existing survey methods for abundance estimation is rarely assessed using alternative approaches. North American mallard populations have been surveyed each spring since 1955 using internationally coordinated aerial surveys, but population size can also be estimated with Lincoln's method using banding and harvest data. We estimated late summer population size of adult and juvenile male and female mallards in western, midcontinent, and eastern North America using Lincoln's method of dividing (i) total estimated harvest, [Formula: see text], by estimated harvest rate, [Formula: see text], calculated as (ii) direct band recovery rate, [Formula: see text], divided by the (iii) band reporting rate, [Formula: see text]. Our goal was to compare estimates based on Lincoln's method with traditional estimates based on aerial surveys. Lincoln estimates of adult males and females alive in the period June-September were 4.0 (range: 2.5-5.9), 1.8 (range: 0.6-3.0), and 1.8 (range: 1.3-2.7) times larger than respective aerial survey estimates for the western, midcontinent, and eastern mallard populations, and the two population estimates were only modestly correlated with each other (western: râ=â0.70, 1993-2011; midcontinent: râ=â0.54, 1961-2011; eastern: râ=â0.50, 1993-2011). Higher Lincoln estimates are predictable given that the geographic scope of inference from Lincoln estimates is the entire population range, whereas sampling frames for aerial surveys are incomplete. Although each estimation method has a number of important potential biases, our review suggests that underestimation of total population size by aerial surveys is the most likely explanation. In addition to providing measures of total abundance, Lincoln's method provides estimates of fecundity and\n\nArts/Crafts.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nInstructor, 1980\n\n1980-01-01\n\nDescribed are various arts and crafts ideas, mostly with a February theme.

This conception is shown to be contrary to Freud's view of orality as elaborated in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (1905), as well as in other writings of late 1914 and 1915. Abraham's conception ignores fundamental dimensions of Freud's thinking during these years, namely, the difference between autoerotism/narcissism and object love, on the one hand, and also between the leading role of sexuality and the secondary role of aggression, on the other. Thus, Abraham's thinking represents a basic theoretical change that had far-reaching consequences for psychoanalytic practice.\n\nHelp History Come Alive with Mannequins.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWisdom, Cynthia Newman\n\n1994-01-01\n\nDescribes a teacher's use of life-size mannequins donated by a dress shop to teach students about historical figures and periods.

It proves the existence of a deep sedimentary basin underlying the Lincoln Sea. This basin appears to be comparable in width and depth to the Sverdrup Basin of the Canadian Arctic Islands. The stratigraphy of the Lincoln Sea Basin is modelled in analogy to the Sverdrup Basin and the Central Spitsbergen Basin, two basins between which the Lincoln Sea intervened before the onset of seafloor spreading in the Eurasian Basin. The refraction data indicates that the Lincoln Sea Basin is capped by a kilometre-thick, low-velocity layer, which is taken to indicate an uplift history similar to, or even more favourable than, the fairway part of the Sverdrup Basin. Tectonic activity in the Palaeogene is likely to constitute the major basin scale risk. We conclude that the Lincoln Sea Basin is likely to be petroliferous and contains risked resources on the order of 1 ?? 109 barrels of oil, to which comes an equivalent amount of (associated and nonassociated) gas. ?? 2011 The Geological Society of London.\n\nThe specifics of superconductivity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrant, Paul M.\n\n2011-07-01\n\nWhen addressing the general audience of any scientific discipline, it is wise to remember Abraham Lincoln, who (almost) said \"You can please all physicists some of the time and some physicists all of the time, but never all physicists all of the time.\"\n\nCourtroom Classics.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nUpdate on Law-Related Education, 1999\n\n1999-01-01\n\nGives background information on 12 famous litigators who each influenced the future of the judicial system and transformed the United States into what it is today; included, among others, are John Adams, Abraham Lincoln, Thurgood Marshall, Daniel Webster, and Clara Shortridge Foltz.

It is contained in his study of the painter Giovanni Segantini (1911), which also includes a description, imbued with a new atmospheric quality, of the mother-son relationship that centres on the concept of the 'bad mother'. The author points out that Abraham's 'good/bad' dimension is effectively absent from Freud's published work up to 1911 and is also at variance with his view of the relationship between son and mother. In later contributions, too, Abraham maintained that unconscious hate directed at the mother, who is experienced as 'bad' but longed for as 'good', was a central factor in the aetiology of depression, a view he had to defend vis-Ã -vis Freud. The author contends that in the Segantini paper Abraham was describing an inner world similar to that evinced by the work of Melanie Klein and significantly different from Freud's. It is characterised by hate, revenge, death wishes and guilt feelings on the one hand and tranquillity and inner peace on the other.\n\nSolar energy system performance evaluation. Seasonal report for SEECO Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1980-01-01\n\nThe Solar Engineering and Equipment Company (SEECO) Lincoln solar energy system, designed for space heating only, is described and its operational performance for a 12 month period from April 1979 through March 1980 is evaluated. The system met 27 percent of the space heating load; however, system losses into the heated space from the storage bin and ductwork were significant. Reducing these losses would add appreciably to the system's efficiency. Net fossil energy savings were 11.31 million BTUs.\n\n\"Towering genius disdains a beaten path\" Abraham Lincoln.\n\nPubMed\n\nFerguson-ParÃ©, Mary; Mitchell, Gail J; Perkin, Karen; Stevenson, Lynn\n\n2002-01-01\n\nWe see nursing leadership existing at all levels in nursing...all nurses leading. Nurse executives within academic health environments across Canada will be influencing health policy directions and dialogue within the profession nationally. They will be contributing to the development of a national agenda for nursing practice, education, research and leadership. These nurse executives will lead in a way that makes an invigorating impact on human service in health care environments and they will be dedicated to preparing the nursing leaders of tomorrow. The Academy of Canadian Executive Nurses will connect with the Office of Nursing Policy, Canadian Nurses Association, Canadian Association of University Schools of Nursing, Association of Canadian Academic Health Care Organizations and others to develop position papers regarding key issues such as patient safety, health human resource planning and leadership in the Canadian health care system.
