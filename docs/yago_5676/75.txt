Dame Henrietta Octavia Weston Barnett, DBE (née Rowland; 4 May 1851 – 10 June 1936) was a notable English social reformer, educationist, and author. She and her husband, Samuel Augustus Barnett, founded the first 'University Settlement' at Toynbee Hall (in the East End of London) in 1884. They also worked to establish the model Hampstead Garden Suburb in the early 20th century.

Born in Clapham, London, Henrietta Octavia Weston Rowland lost her mother at an early age. Her father, Alexander Rowland, a wealthy businessman, raised her and seven siblings at their London home and a country house in Kent, where she developed a lifelong appreciation of country pursuits.[1][2]

At age 16, Henrietta was sent to a boarding school in Devon run by the Haddon sisters, who were committed to social altruism. When her father died in 1869, Henrietta moved with two sisters to Bayswater, where she met and helped social activist and housing reformer Octavia Hill.[3] Hill introduced Henrietta to the writings of John Ruskin, as well as many influential people similarly interested in improving the condition of London's poor.
