        "text": "Celebrating Age and Life's Journey For a long time, I have always hesitated to talk about age, maybe because of milestones yet to be met. But as I approach a new chapter, I have embraced a fresh outlook on aging. I have learned that aging is a natural part of life, not a disease. Our worth shouldn't be defined by unmet expectations and milestones, but by the impact we make. Rather than waiting for grand accomplishments, I have chosen to celebrate daily victories and acknowledge God's faithfulness in live. Though my timeline hasn't always aligned with my expectations, I'm grateful for growth, opportunities and the blessings I have received. I have learnt to prioritize happiness, finding joy in everyday moments, taking life one day at a time, pursuing my passions, and continuing living a life that honors God. I have found that having no expectations can sometimes lead to a sense of aimlessness, but having too many can lead to disappointment and frustration. Is there a balance to be struck? Now to you: How do you navigate the complex world of expectations and disappointment? Do you think it's possible to live without expectations altogether, or is that an unrealistic goal? Please share your thoughts and let's learn from your wealth of knowledge\n\nNEVER EVER FORGET THESE LESSONS OF LIFE *1. Always remember that you can grow without destroying others.* *2. Always remember that your dreams can be fulfilled without sabotaging others.* *3. Always remember that nobody must go down for you to rise.* *4. Always remember that nobody must be shamed or embarrassed for your smile to be sustained.* *5. Always remember that while others are rising, you can also rise.* *6. Always remember that finding satisfaction in the pain of others will never bring you true happiness.* *7. Always remember that what you wish others is a prayer for yourself.* *8. Become the good fire that genuinely lights up others, not one that ruins the joy, goodwill, and expectation of others.* *9. Never take delight in causing pain or sponsoring the tears of another. What you sow will come back to you in multiplied folds* *10. Never ever use your position in authority to punish others for fear that your position would be taken from you. You never know tomorrow. Life is uncertain.* *Also never use the position you occupy today to frustrate others, for you never can tell what the future holds tomorrow.* *11. Allow the true FEAR OF GOD to guide your days, STRENGTHEN YOUR RELATIONSHIPS and SET YOUR COURSE.* *This is the path to true peace, lasting influence and meaningful living!* Stay blessed and take care for those you meet on your way up are the same people you will surely meet on your way down.

I wanted to share some thoughts on strategic living and the importance of taking action. In life, waiting for things to happen often leads to wasted opportunities. Just like objects in motion, everything tends to stay in a state of rest until an external force acts upon it. To achieve success, we must actively make things happen instead of passively waiting for them to happen. Living with intention rather than by default is crucial. You have the power to shape your future and create the life you desire. It's essential to understand that your actions determine your progress. By taking proactive steps, you can become better and achieve more than you ever thought possible. Remember, you are an asset and are built to make a positive impact in the world. Whether it's starting a business, organization, or even a family, now is the time to take that important step forward. Lastly, it's important to understand that prayer alone cannot yield results if we are not actively working towards enhancing our value. We must combine our faith with action to achieve meaningful outcomes. As we enter December, let's commit to taking quality steps toward achieving quality results. With the support of God and our efforts, we can create a successful and fulfilling life. Wishing you all the best, YOUR LIFE MATTERS NO\n\nTOMORROW IS NEVER A SURE THING At 61, a profound truth became clear to me: tomorrow is never a sure thing. Life, with all its unpredictability, doesn't come with guarantees. Many of us delay our dreams, waiting for the 'right' moment or thinking there's always tomorrow to start living fully. But what if tomorrow never arrives? It's easy to get caught in the trap of postponing happiness or action. We tell ourselves, \"I'll be happy when...\" or \"I'll do that tomorrow.\" But each day is a gift, and it's essential to embrace the present. Every sunrise is a reminder to be thankful for today and make the most of every moment. So, ask yourself: What are you putting off? Whether it's pursuing a passion, mending a relationship, or simply taking a moment to breathe and appreciate life, don't wait. Start today. Tomorrow isn't promised; today is yours to seize. Be thankful you have what you need to be amazing, not hopeful.\n\nHAPPY NEW MONTH It's step 3 out of the 12 steps in a new year. It's a new month and a new beginning. To make this month a successful one it‚Äôs not just by shouting a new month, a new system, new goals, like the saying it‚Äôs not about how far but how well. Revisit your new year resolution, your new goals, how far have you gone? How many have you achieved? What steps have you taken? What is your next agenda for this month?. Like i will always say, it‚Äôs okay to take baby steps, don‚Äôt be hard on yourself even if your plan seems not to be having shape, just make sure you are moving, just make sure you are taking a step, just make sure you are not stagnant. Make sure you are putting in your best. Happy new month of march lovelies, just has the name , this new month we are marching into greatness, we are marching into goodness, marching into unquenchable joy, marching into upliftment, marching into supernatural abundance and ease in Jesus name. AMEN. #HAPPY NEW MONTH #WELCOME TO MARCH #THEVOCALPEN\n\nGoodmorning All.. Rise and Shine..üåûüåü üéØWe should appreciate the fact that we exist and make the most of our time on Earth. We should not waste our opportunities, talents, and potential, but rather pursue our goals, dreams, and passions. üéØWe should live in the present moment, enjoy the simple pleasures, and be grateful for what we have. Life is precious, fragile, and unpredictable, and therefore we should not take it for granted. üéØLet's go for it. Let\"s Do it. Let's Seize the day. Let's Live as fully as we can. If not now, when? If not us, who then? üéØIndividuals have a limited time on Earth and should make the most of it. Life is precious and should not be wasted. This perspective emphasizes the importance of living fully, pursuing goals and aspirations, and cherishing experiences and relationships. üéØ The quote can also serve as a reminder to prioritize what truly matters and make choices that align with personal values and desires.\n\nNew Year, New You??? I heard this saying, and it made me think about what we are looking for with \"New Year's Resolutions\"? We should all be constantly trying to improve and better ourselves, whether it is spiritually, professionally, or personally. I know that I can always improve and become a better Christian Man, Christian Husband and Christian Father. I firmly believe that if I strive to be better at those things every day, everything else will fall into place. Don't get me wrong, we all need to set some goals for sure, but ultimately, we should be looking to become a better version of the person that we are today instead of trying to create a \"New YOU\". We are all in the position that we are in now, due to certain circumstances and choices that we have made in our past (good or bad). That is what makes YOU the unique person that God created you to be. My goal for everyone reading this, is for you to know that you are awesome and that in 2024, you are going to be blessed and that you are going to be a better person this time next year. Accept that challenge to become better and strive daily to get better 1 more day. #newyearsresolution #beabetteryou #encouragement #chasegodspurpose #positivethoughts #bettereveryday"
