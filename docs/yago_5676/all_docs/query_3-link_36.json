        "text": "Garden City in London, founded by Dame Henrietta Octavia Weston Barnett.\n\nHeritage status: Yes Explanation: In 1968 Hampstead Garden Suburb was designated as a conservation area by Barnet Council in recognition of its special character. This is defined as “an area of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance”. General condition of Garden City: Good condition\n\nGeneral description\n\nRead more ...\n\nArchitecture / Urban planning\n\nComprising just over 5,000 properties, and home to around 16,000 people, undivided houses with individual gardens are a key feature of this planned community. The area has landscaped garden squares, communal parks and Hampstead Heath Extension.\n\nUnwin and Barry clearly expanded on the ideas of Ebenezer Howard's garden city and the experiences they had developing Letchworth a couple of years before. Unlike the original garden cities, it however had no industry or public houses and few shops or services, so it was far less self-containment. The name 'garden suburb' is therefore more appropriate.\n\nSources\n\nWebsite URL\n\nWikipedia\n\nWebsite URL\n\nHampstead Garden Suburb\n\nOrganizations\n\nLegend"
