Also, on that site there are two choices to view the Y-DNA Results Charts:\n\n1) Classic Chart\n\n2) Colorized Chart-This chart offers some analysis the first does not. For each Group it gives a DYS Results Minimum, Maximum and Modal Value.\n\nBoth charts offer a drop down box to view results for 12, 25, 37, 67 and the new 111 marker tests. Everyone in our project has taken the 12 marker test, so everyone is included in that chart analysis. If a project member has not taken an advanced upgraded test they will not be represented in the more advanced 25, 37, 67, 111 test analysis charts.\n\nIndividual participants may view the TIP (Time Predictor Tool) on their personal page.
