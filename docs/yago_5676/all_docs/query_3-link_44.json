        "text": "Four items, in good condition, lightly aged and worn. An interesting correspondence, casting light on the proprieties of Victorian biographical writing. Hare's 'The Story of my Life' was published in six volumes between 1896 and 1900, and was described by the original DNB as 'a long, tedious, and indiscreet autobiography'. The Oxford DNB remarks that 'By the late twentieth century, however, Hare was undergoing something of a revival. A society of enthusiasts and collectors of his works was formed: a one-volume condensed edition of his autobiography was edited by A. Miller and J. Papp in 1995, and it and the original proved a useful source for those interested in country-house life in the later nineteenth century.' The 'defamatory' passage that is the subject of the complaint by Harington and the family of Dean Smith in the present correspondence is paraphrased by Harington in Item Four below. ONE: Manuscript 'Copies' (presumably by Henry Smith or a member of his family, see Item Three) of two letters from Hare [to Henry Smith]. Both from Holmhurst, St Leonards on Sea [the first on cancelled letterhead of the Shire Hall, Worcester]; 10 and 11 December 1896. On the same bifolium. Totalling 4pp., 12mo. In the letter of 10 December he states that he is 'sorry to learn from you that anyone has been pained by anything in the \"Story of my Life\" | The story you mention was told me (as quoted from a letter to my mother) by a lady who was intimate with your family. She was certainly unconscious of doing anything unkind in repeating a well known & popular anecdote which I have since often heard at dinner tables both in Oxfordshire & Yorkshire so often that I imagined everyone considered it historic'. He continues with his defence, pointing out that the anecdote is responsible for 'the well known nick name [of Dean Smith] so familiar still at Ch Ch'.' As he is 'unwilling to cause the slightest pain, the passage shall certainly be omitted henceforth'. In a postscript he writes: 'My publishers are in no sense responsible for my books as I pay for them entirely. I alone am to blame if there is blame.' Letter of 11 December begins: 'On looking again at yr. letter today, it strikes me in quite a different light. It is possible that you thought that I, or my readers, or the readers of the story where it has appeared elsewhere, or the many who say they heard Dr. Smith narrate it, regarded the story as true! - that never occurred to me before! As far as I know it has been universally regarded as such a story as an elderly lover of anecdote would tell against himself, evolving it from his own imagination, with a very considerable sense of humour & no idea of any serious construction being placed upon it and certainly with little idea of who would be the first to place such a construction. From what I have heard he was always himself amused by the soubriquet which arose from the story. Besides regretting anything that has given you pain, I regret that I did not insert the words \"wholly imaginary\" - \"told this wholly & [sic] imaginary story against himself\"'. TWO: Hare [to Harington]. 5pp., 12mo. He begins by thanking him for his 'very kind letter', and expresses sorrow 'for any pain your uncle has felt through the \"Story of my Life\".' He explains that 'the earlier volumes' of the book were written seventeen years before, and that it had been 'printed some years though with no intention of publication till long after my death; an arrangement which, last year, circumstances induced me to alter'. Publication has allowed him to 'correct errors the story of Alexander the Great for instance, which I had already been made aware that I had most stupidly spoilt.' When he agreed to publication he had 'no idea of the possibility of a son & daughters of Dean Smith being alive: indeed the latter seemed to me quite old ladies when I saw them above thirty years ago'. He recalls that after he took his degree he lived 'much at Oxford with my cousin Canon Stanley', and that he 'often heard the story, which was an especial favourite with him', and that when he 'went to Doncaster, I was taken to see the ladies, because of their (supposed) connection with the story'. He has 'expunged' the anecdote from 'the second edition (not out yet)'. He has been assured by '[s]everal young men' to whom he has mentioned Harington's uncle's letter that 'they have heard it before always, of course, as an old gentlemans story told in obliviousness of the construction which his hearers might place upon it'. He ends by claiming to be well acquainted with Harington's son: 'I think he would let me say that he was a friend of mine'. Both of the autograph drafts of Harington's letters to Hare are signed with initials. THREE: Draft of Harington to Hare. 8 February 1897. 4pp., 12mo. With deletions and emendations. Begins: Dear Sir, | My Uncle Henry Smith has shown me the correspondence which passed between himself & you last December with reference to the defamatory anecdote which you related in your autobiography touching my grandfather, Dr Gaisford's predecessor as Dean of Ch. Ch.' He accepts Hare's 'assurance that the story was inserted without any intention of giving the pain & annoyance which it undoubtedly has to his descendants & that it will be omitted in future editions but I must protest against your speaking of it or the sobriquet which you have attached to him as familiar still at Ch Ch.' He points out that he is himself 'an old Student of Ch Ch. of within a month or two exactly the same University standing as yourself, & Oxford has been the home of my boyhood since 1842.' Hare's story was 'perfectly well known' in Harington's time, 'but told not of Dr Smith but of another man an old gentleman nearly in his dotage himself quite as incapable of such an act as my grandfather, but of whom it was told in of his imbecility.' He boasts of 'an unbroken succession of descendants of my grandfather at Ch Ch or living in Oxford, for more t.\n\nEphemera. Condition: Very Good. First Edition. Autograph; 1 pages; A typed letter SIGNED by John J. Pershing on printed letterhead reading \"General of the Armies / Washington\" The letter is dated March 25, 1926 and is addressed to \"The Honorable / Peter Augustus Jay, / American Ambassador, / Buenos Aires, Argentina\" The text reads: \"My dear Mr. Ambassador: // This note will be presented to / you by Mrs. F.J. Perry, a very good friend / of mine who is making a trip along the east / coast of South America. She is an Army / woman who rendered very distinguished / services during the World War and I shall / appreciate any courtesies which you or the / Military Attache may find it convenient to / extend to her. // With very warm regards, believe me / Yours sincerely, [signed] John J. Pershing\" Included is the printed calling card of Mrs. Frederick Lewis Perry with the penciled note \"Savoy Hotel\" , card bears a mark from old paperclip. General John J. Pershing had a long association with Mrs. Frederick Lewis Perry; in fact, his brother Ward B. Pershing was best man at the wedding of Mary Hooper Jouett and Lt. Frederick Lewis Perry in 1901. At the time of this letter, Peter A. Jay was U.S. Ambassador to Argentina. It is interesting to delve into the history related to the three individuals principal to this piece of correspondance. MRS. FREDERICK LEWIS PERRY -- Mary Hooper Jouett Perry (1868-1945) was the daughter of Major William Burchett Hooper of the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco. Major Hooper ventured to California in the first years of the gold rush. Rather than cast his lot with the miners, he embarked in the mercantile business on an extended scale. Through his management, the Occidental Hotel acquired a wide fame and became the recognized hostelry for naval and military officers and ecclesiastical and fraternal leaders. Nearly three years after his death, the hotel was severely damaged in the 1906 earthquake and had to be torn down. In September 1901 Mary Hooper Jouett married Lt. Frederick Lewis Perry of the Artillery Corps, U.S.A. at the Occidental Hotel. Lt. Ward Beecher Pershing (4th Cavalry, U.S.A., brother of General John J. Pershing) was Perry's best man. [Ward Pershing (1874-1909) died of illness contracted during his service in the Philippines War.] Lt. Perry, as aide to General Hale in the First Colorado Infantry, was slightly wounded in the Philippines. Perry was soon promoted to Captain, and they spent years at various postings from Virginia to the San Francisco Bay Area. Mary had two sons, William Hooper Jouett and John Hamilton Jouett; both served in the military. Recruited by Chiang Kai-shek, retired Major John H. Jouett lead 17 American instructor pilots, who were hired to turn the Chinese Aviation School into a replica of the United States' Randolph Field. They spent two years in the war-torn nation completing the training of 335 Chinese cadets using an American system similar to the one used at Randolph Field in Texas. PETER AUGUSTUS JAY -- Peter Augustus Jay (1877 1933) was an American diplomat born in 1877 at Newport, Rhode Island, into the esteemed Jay family that traces its direct lineage to John Jay, Founding Father and first Chief Justice of the United States. In 1902, he began his professional diplomatic career at the American embassy in Paris followed by service in Constantinople. Jay became Charg√© d'Affaires in Tokyo in 1908, where he served until the end of 1909 when President William Howard Taft appointed him Consul General to Egypt in Cairo (1910 - 1913). In 1920, President Woodrow Wilson appointed Jay as U.S. Minister to El Salvador; soon after President Warren G. Harding, made him U.S. Minister to Romania (1921-1925), where he assisted in negotiating that country's repayment terms of $42 million for wartime and post World War I development loans. In 1925, President Calvin Coolidge appointed him U.S. Ambassador to Argentina. This was his last foreign service job, as he resigned his post and returned to Washington, D.C in December 1926, following the death of his young daughter Emily. GENERAL JOHN JOSEPH PERSHING, GCB (1860 1948) was a senior American United States Army officer. He served most famously as the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) during World War I from 1917 to 1920. In addition to leading the AEF to victory in World War I, Pershing notably served as a mentor to many in the generation of generals who led the United States Army during World War II, including George C. Marshall, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Omar Bradley, Lesley J. McNair, George S. Patton, and Douglas MacArthur. Pershing reported for active duty in 1887, and was assigned to Troop L of the 6th U.S. Cavalry in the New Mexico Territory. Between 1887 and 1890, he served at various postings in New Mexico, Arizona, and South Dakota. Pershing participated in several Indian campaigns and was cited for bravery for actions against the Apache. In 1895 Pershing, as a first lieutenant, took command of a troop of the 10th Cavalry Regiment, one of the original Buffalo Soldier regiments composed of African-American soldiers led by white officers. In the SpanishAmerican War, he and his 10th Cavalry troop fought on Kettle and San Juan Hills in Cuba, and he was cited for gallantry. Theodore Roosevelt, who also participated in those battles, said that \"Captain Pershing is the coolest man under fire I ever saw in my life.\" When the PhilippineAmerican War began, Pershing reported to Manila and was assigned to the Department of Mindanao and Jolo, He commanded efforts to suppress the Filipino Insurrection. He was cited for bravery for actions on the Cagayan River while attempting to destroy a Philippine stronghold at Macajambo. Pershing served as an observer in the Russo-Japanese War attached to General Kuroki Tamemoto's Japanese First Army in Manchuria. When Pershing returned to the United States in the fall of 1905, President Roosevelt exercised his presidential prerogative and, with Congressional approval, promoted him to br."
