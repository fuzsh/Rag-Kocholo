        "text": "In 1875, Samuel Bennett was invited to visit Oxford University by Gertrude Toynbee, whose brother, Arnold Toynbee was studying there. Following this visit, he was asked to return by a number of University Societies to talk about the conditions that he found in the East End. This he did, and began to emphasise the his ideas of what could be done to help alleviate the poverty experienced there.\n\nBarnett felt that benefit would be obtained to both Oxford students and residents of the East End if a group of students were to come and live and work. He advocated the foundation of a Settlement House with sufficient sleeping rooms and large reception rooms where the students would live and offer their help to those in need.\n\nBarnett’s proposals were met with an immediate response: some positive and some negative.\n\nThe major criticism of Barnett’s proposal was offered by a group that was led by the Warden of Keble College, Edward Stuart Talbott (1844-1934). The group felt that any Settlement should be attached to a Parish and be an extension of its social work within the Church of England. The group felt that such a venture should function less as an independent and non-denominational institution, as Barnett had proposed.\n\nDespite this opposition, by January 1884, various University authorities agreed to take the necessary steps to provide such a Settlement House in the East End and a committee was formed to receive the names of those students wishing to offer their services. The committee was in agreement that The Reverend Samuel A. Barnett be offered the post of Head of what was to become Toynbee Hall.\n\n-oOo-\n\nIn April 1884, The Reverend George Knight Bruce (1853-1896), the Vicar of the Parish of St Andrew at Bethnal Green, announced that a Settlement House was presently being started in the Parish. Edward Stuart Talbott, the Warden of Keble College said that though the basis of the scheme was to be religion and Christianity, anyone would be welcome to join in the work including those who could scarcely define their attitude to Christianity of the Church of England."
