He went into entertainment in 1895 when he took over a wooden circus building on the site of a pit-heap in Jarrow and created the Jarrow Palace of Varieties music hall. His soubriquet was 'the born hustler'. He married Maud D'Almayne, a music hall singer and his second wife, in 1897. In March 1899 he bought the Tivoli music hall in Leeds and introduced twice nightly performances at low prices—a policy he repeated in his other halls. Films were included on the bill at his theatres from 1900, typically as the last item and with orchestral accompaniment.\n\nAs part of his rapid expansion he acquired in 1902 the Brighton Hippodrome and the Empire Theatre in New Road, Brighton, which he renamed the Coliseum Theatre (later the Court Cinema). At this time he moved his base from Leeds to Brighton. In 1905 Barrasford opened the Alhambra music hall in Paris and arranged cross-channel tours of artistes in both directions. Local newsreels were made for the Leeds Tivoli by film cameraman Owen Brooks, who appears to have been mainly responsible for developing a version of the cinematograph for use in the Hippodromes with the name Barrascope. In 1908 Barrasford and William Faulkner, an engineer at the Brighton Hippodrome, patented 'a fire extinguishing contrivance for use with kinematographs'. He was also a noted race-horse owner and invented a starting gate that went into production and was adopted by the Jockey Club.\n\nHe died at his residence, Hippodrome House, next door to the theatre, leaving an estate of around Â£70,000. His funeral [right] is said to have been one of the largest ever seen in Brighton. PERSONAL\n\nâ¢ Hippodrome, Middle Street\n\nâ Empire Theatre (Court Cinema), New Road BASHFORD, Celia\n\n1799-1831 Trunk murder victim.\n\nBorn in Ardingly, the sixth of 11 children, she was slightly over four feet tall. While on service in Brighton, she met John William Holloway of Lewes at Brighton Races and fell in love with him. When she became pregnant he refused to marry her, so she sought parish relief in Ardingly. The authorities there had Holloway arrested and imprisoned at Lewes for five weeks until he agreed to marry her. Ardingly then refused help to the married couple, who returned to Brighton, where the child was still-born. Holloway was serving with the Naval Blockade Service at Rye when he met and bigamously married Ann Kennett. When the couple returned to Brighton and he found work as a painter on the Chain Pier, Celia applied for parish relief; the overseers ordered him to pay 2s a week, which he didn't. Holloway murdered Celia at her lodgings on 24 July 1831, and with Kennett's assistance burned her clothes and dismembered the body, taking the head and limbs to the privy of their lodgings at 7 Margaret Street and taking her torso in a trunk to a shallow grave in Lover's Walk. About a week later the remains were discovered after heavy rainfall. She was buried by coroner's warrant at Preston on 14 August. Holloway was executed at Horsham Gaol on 15 December 1831.

He specialised in trompe l'oeil paintings and helped to establish Brighton Museum's collection of 20th-century art. He never married, died in London and left Â£100,079.

She was the wife of cinema pioneer George Albert Smith, whom she married in 1888. As well as acting in many of Smith's films, she also played a role as producer and was probably also involved in writing, directing and possibly even camera work. Smith himself gave her credit for the âfacialsâ—close-ups of comic faces—that were popular with early audiences. She was one of the most prolific film actresses at the time and may have a good claim to be the one of most prolific woman filmmakers ever. In his filmography of women silent filmmakers in Britain, Luke McKernan lists Laura Bayley as the possible director of 84 films in 1900-1901, some of them shot in Brighton and Hove but others in London, Scotland, Belgium, Italy and India. She is known to have used a 17.5mm Biokam camera, devised and made by Alfred Darling and Alfred Wrench.\n\nHer three sisters, Eva (1854-), Florence Charlotte (1856-1902) and Blanche Alberta (1866-1945) were also actresses and appeared in Smithâs films. Florence was also lessee of a theatre in Ramsgate before her death.

Soldier, politician and landowner.\n\nBorn at Boynton, Wiltshire, the son of a clergyman who was critical of Augustus Pugin's ideas and had a disputation argument with him. His family seat was at Pythouse, Tisbury, Wiltshire. Vere married Ellen Stanford, the heiress of Preston Manor, in 1867 and changed his name to Benett-Stanford. Prior to this, in 1863, he fathered a child by a 19-year-old actress, Fanny Josephs. By the time of his death he was styled Benet-Stanford. He was MP for Salisbury in 1873-1880. He died at Funchal, Madeira, where there was a family residence.\n\nJohn Montagu Benett-Stanford [below right]. Soldier, landowner, cinema pioneer.\n\nSon of Vere Fane Benett and Ellen Stanford, who owned Preston Manor in Brighton, left Eton at the age of 16 for a two-year apprenticeship with the London, Brighton & South Coast Railway. He then took a commission in the 3rd Battalion the Wiltshire Regiment. It was through this connection that he became the first person ever to film actuality footage in war conditions. Known as âMad Jackâ and âRoaring Jackâ, he made two successful films before and after the battle of Omdurman (1 September 1898) in the Sudan campaign of 1898, followed by the return of Lord Kitchener (The Sirdar) to London, the latter produced by R W Paulâs Animatograph works. The next year he made (at least) two films at the family residence in Madeira and then five more in England—all of which were distributed by the Warwick Trading Company, then headed by Charles Urban. Under an arrangement with Warwick, he set off to South Africa with a Bioscope film camera in October 1899 and sent back at least five films, including scenes of troops crossing the Modder River. His war films were enthusiastically received by British audiences. All his films were processed and printed by G A Smith in Hove, released in January 1900. His film activity seems to have ended in 1900. Although he did not even mention this work in an unpublished memoir, the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography calls him âcinematographer and land ownerâ, so it is for his film work that he is mainly remembered.\n\nImages: Vere Fane Benett; John Montagu Benett-Stanford [Royal Pavilion & Museums Trust] COMMEMORATION\n\nâ¢ Benett Avenue\n\nâ¢ Benett Drive\n\nâ¢ Tisbury Road\n\nRESIDENTIAL\n\nâ¢ Preston Manor BENNEY, (Ernest Alfred) Sallis ARCA\n\n1894-1966 Artist, designer and academic administrator.\n\nNoted for landscape paintings and commemorative plaques, he was born in Bradford.
