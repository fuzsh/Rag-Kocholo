        "text": "I recent began researching my family and have come across this infromation on the 1881 census.\n\nRAYNER, John Head Married M 51 1830 Auctioner\n\nLeeds\n\nYorkshire\n\nRAYNER, Mary A Wife Married F 40 1841\n\nLeeds\n\nYorkshire\n\nBARNETT, William Wifes Son Single M 23 1858 Boot Finisher\n\nLeeds\n\nYorkshire\n\nBARNETT, Alice Wifes Daughter Single F 17 1864\n\nLeeds\n\nYorkshire\n\nOn this census John & Mary have their own children as well Charles N 1853, John 1860, Annie 1868, Minnie 1876, Arthur 1879 and Mary 1854.\n\nThese two children appear to be born in the middle but with a different surname. Can anyone shed a light on this?\n\nHi,\n\n1881 England Census\n\nabout John Rayner\n\nName: John Rayner\n\nAge: 51\n\nEstimated Birth Year: abt 1830\n\nRelation: Head\n\nSpouse's Name: Mary A.\n\nGender: Male\n\nWhere born: Leeds, Yorkshire, England\n\nCivil Parish: Leeds\n\nCounty/Island: Yorkshire\n\nCountry: England\n\nStreet address: 145 North St\n\nCondition as to marriage: Married\n\nEducation:\n\nEmployment status: View Image\n\nOccupation: Auctioner\n\nRegistration district: Leeds\n\nSub registration district: West Leeds\n\nED, institution, or vessel: 2\n\nNeighbors: View others on page\n\nHousehold Members: Name Age\n\nAlice Barnett 17 (daughter in law)\n\nWilliam Barnett 23 (stepson)\n\nCharles N.

I believe they were from John & Mary's married with there being only one letter difference in the names/\n\nPossible??\n\n1861 England Census\n\nabout William Barnett\n\nName: William Barnett\n\nAge: 3\n\nEstimated Birth Year: abt 1858\n\nRelation: Son\n\nFather's Name: Samuel\n\nMother's Name: Mary Ann\n\nGender: Male\n\nWhere born: Leeds, Yorkshire, England\n\nCivil Parish: Leeds\n\nEcclesiastical parish: All Saints\n\nTown: Leeds\n\nCounty/Island: Yorkshire\n\nCountry: England\n\nStreet address:\n\nOccupation:\n\nCondition as to marriage: View Image\n\nRegistration district: Leeds\n\nSub registration district: South East Leeds\n\nED, institution, or vessel: 26\n\nNeighbors: View others on page\n\nHousehold schedule number: 79\n\nHousehold Members: Name Age\n\nMary Ann Barnett 22\n\nSamuel Barnett 26\n\nWilliam Barnett 3\n\nin 1852 John & Mary were married...they lived in Haymont Street\n\nThey were married 21.06.1852 at Leeds Registry office. Is it possible they seperated?\n\nAt all of the following addresses\n\n1861 - 15 Haymount Street\n\n1871 - 1 Violet Street\n\n1881 - 145 North Street\n\nHaving looked a little more i think he did marry twice..and had Minnie and Arthur. While Mary also married twice having Alice and Hannah...\n\nIs it possible his second wife was also called Mary as when his children by wife number 2 were born, in 1881 he was living with a Mary...same name as his first wife??\n\nThere are also two more children, Jane and Catherine born 1858 and 1856.\n\nWhat I current have is:\n\nMary Nicholson & Samuel Barnett married ??\n\nTwo children\n\nWilliam 1858\n\nAlice 1864\n\nMary Nicholson & John Reynar\n\nMarried 21.05.1852\n\nChildren:\n\nCharles Rayner 1852\n\nMary Rayner 1853\n\nCatherine Rayner 1858\n\nJohn Rayner 1860\n\nAnnie Rayner 1868\n\nJane Rayner 1856\n\nJohn Rayner & unknown wife\n\nChildren:\n\nMinnie Reyner 1876\n\nArthur Reyner 1879\n\nCan anyone help me find out the name of John's first wife? And maybe give me some ideas to why the children were all born as if during a bizzare 4 way marriage"
