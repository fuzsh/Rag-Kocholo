        "text": "ENGLISH REFORMERS: SAMUEL A. BARNETT, R. J. CAMPBELL, AYLMER MAUDE and others\n\nA group of influential English churchman and scholars' petition Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey to release Egyptians imprisoned after the Denshawai Incident, which aroused Egyptian nationalism against British colonial rule.\n\nDocument signed: \"Saml. A. Barnett\", \"R. J. Campbell\", \"Aylmer Maude\", \"J. Frederic Mackarners\", \"J. Harrison Macdonald\", and one unidentified signature, 2 pages (front and verso), 8x13. No place, circa 1906. To Sir Edward Grey, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Pencil note at top of page 1 requests persons to sign and return the document to a London address. The signatories review the details of the incident at Denshawai, Egypt, in which 5 Egyptians were hanged and many more flogged and imprisoned by a colonial tribunal after an alleged assault on a group of British military officers. The petitioners cite a British government White Paper which largely exonerated the Egyptians in the incident, and by implication blamed the English soldiers. Accordingly, the petitioners request the immediate release of the imprisoned men. SAMUEL A. BARNETT (1844-1913) was an Anglican minister and social reformer, believing that the church should focus on improving the lives of the nation's poor. He founded the Universal Settlements Association (1884), to send Oxford students to live and work among London's poor. A visit to the movement's headquarters by American social reformer Jane Addams influenced her similar efforts at Chicago's Hull House. REGINALD JOHN \"R. J. CAMPBELL (1867-1956) was an English Congregational minister at the prestigious City Temple, London. In 1906, the year he signed this petition, Campbell also published his New Theology, a reinterpretation of Christian theology consistent with modern science. Like Barnett, he was interested in social reform. World War I would prove a shock to Campbell, however, and he shifted to much more conservative doctrines and returned to the Church of England. AYLMER MAUDE (1858-1938), the son of an English clergyman resident in Russia, became - with his wife Louise Maude - the principle translators of Leo Tolstoy's works in to English. Aylmer concentrated on Tolstoy's philosophy, concentrating on his reform ideas, while Louise translated most of the fiction. They were responsible for the complete Oxford University collection of Tolstoy's works. J. Frederic Mackarners was an Anglican bishop. No information is available on J. Harrison Macdonald. The Denshawai Incident would prove a turning point in Anglo-Egyptian relations, arousing Egyptian nationalism against British colonial rule and turning many in England against it as well. Heavily creased. Rope at top left corner attaching pages. Edges and corners creased and worn. Multiple chips around edges. Lightly toned. Multiple mailing folds.
