        "text": "Will of Samuel Barnett [late of the parish of St James in the island of Jamaica but now] of Redland [near the City of Bristol] Gloucestershire [made 16/07/1762] was proved 24/02/1763. At the time he made the will he still owned Drax Hall along with Catherine Mount and Catherine Hall. He said he had previously committed to transfer Catherine Mount debt-free with at least 60 'able-bodied working slaves' enslaved people, 24 working mules, 24 working steers, one bull and 6 cows, to his eldest son William Barnett within 8 years [i.e. 1768], until when William would be paid an annuity of Â£500 p.a. He placed the estate in trust and instructed that excess enslaved people on Catherine Mount should be moved to Catherine Hall. He left Catherine Hall and Drax Hall in trust to his son Jonathan Beckford Barnett and his heirs, failing whom it was to pass to his daughter Frances Shettlewood Woollery, the wife of Edward Woollery, and his three unmarried daughters Jane, Martha and Mary Ann Barnett as tenants-in-common."
