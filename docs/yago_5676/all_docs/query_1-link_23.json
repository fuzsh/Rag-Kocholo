        "text": "Meaning, Origin, Etymology\n\nThis name is of Anglo-Norman descending across Ireland, Scotland and Wales in early times and can be found in many manuscripts in the mediaeval period in these countries. Barnett can be found in English, French, Dutch, Polish, Czech, and Slovenian cultures. It derives from a Germanic personal name of Bernhard which is made up of the elements ber(n) ‘bear’ + hard ‘brave’, ‘hardy’, ‘strong’. Barnett is either a topographical or habitational name. Topographical it means one who lived on “land cleared by burning”. Habitational comes from many place names such as Friern Barnet in Greater London, East Barnet or Chipping (High) Barnet. It may also be a variant of the personal name of ‘Bernard’ or ‘Bernhard’ meaning ‘brave-bear’. It is also a baptismal name that was brought to England by the Normans around 1066 and immediately following the conquest it became a very popular forename and surname due greatly to the virtue of being borne by Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, 1090-1153, founder and Abbot of the Cistercian Monastery at Clairvaux. Olde English forms of this surname are: bærnet meaning ‘place cleared by burning’ and bærnan meaning ‘to burn’ or ‘to set light to’. The first person to be recorded with the spelling of Barnett is Jane Barnett, dated January 29, 1656 with her marriage to James Davison, County Derry, Ulster, Ireland, during the period of the Commonwealth (1649-1659).\n\nSpelling Variations\n\nBarnett, Barnette, Barnet, Barnet, Bernard, Barnard, Bernard, Bernadine, Barnett, Barnatt, Burnet, and Burnett.\n\nPopularity & Geographic Distribution\n\nThe last name Barnett ranks 3,124th in popularity worldwide as of the 2014 Census and approximately 181,584 people carry the Barnett surname worldwide.
