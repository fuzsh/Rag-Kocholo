He was first introduced to the show in Robin Scherbatsky's "Sandcastles In The Sand‚Äù music video, and continued appearing in different episodes as himself. His Canadian background further added to the gag that followed Robin around throughout all nine seasons.

Season 9, Episode 12, "The Rehearsal Dinner," was Thicke's last appearance on the TV series. He was known on the show for playing a loveable caricature of himself, with his own comedic brand that spread across all of the projects he worked on, (via University Herald).
