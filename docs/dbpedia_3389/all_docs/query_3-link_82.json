        "text": "By Bill Kelly\n\nTony Marts, Somers Point’s legendary nightclub, hasn’t physically existed in decades, but its musical spirit lives on as Anthony Marotta’s son Carmen continues to produce and promote the music at the weekly free Friday night Somers Point Beach Concerts and on Wednesdays at Kennedy Plaza on the Atlantic City Boardwalk.\n\nNow 67 years old, Marotta has retired from his day job at a law office and now has the time to concentrate on promoting the music that made Tony Marts famous and to write his memoirs, reflecting on his days growing up at one of the most popular nightclubs on the East Coast.\n\nAt first Carmen wanted to reach out to promote an upcoming act by The Weight Band which mainly plays the music of The Band, one of the many famous groups that performed at Tony Marts as Levon and the Hawks. The Weight Band, scheduled to play at Kennedy Plaza on the Atlantic City Boardwalk next Wednesday, just happened to coincide with the Episode 9 when Levon and the Hawks check into Tony Marts in the serialization of my novela, “Waiting on the Angels – the Long Cool Summer of ’65 Revisited,” appearing this summer in Shore Local Newsmagazine.\n\nThen Robbie Robertson, the lead guitarist, principal songwriter and front man for The Band passed away August 9, and many if not most of the obituaries and memorials to him mentioned days with the Hawks at Tony Marts, giving it national attention once again. In one, Robertson is quoted saying, “Tony Marts was an amazing crossroads on our journey, a really important thing for us.”\n\n“I can’t put my finger on it why that time and place was so special,” said Marotta, “but it was a combination of things – Colonel Kudlets, Conway Twitty, Levon and the Hawks – it sort of just all came together.”\n\nToday Carmen, along with his wife Nancy, produces the Friday night Somers Point Beach Concerts, along with the Somers Point Concerts Committee, as they have done for three decades, and also produce the Atlantic City Boardwalk Mardi Gras AC shows on Wednesday nights for the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority; that has been ongoing for 12 years.\n\nLast Saturday afternoon I spoke with Carmen for about an hour reflecting on Tony Marts and its ongoing legacy.\n\nTo start at the beginning, Anthony Marotta, Sr. was born in a small village in Sicily and began his journey to America on a banana boat that took him to Panama, where he worked as a laborer for two years to earn the money to get to New York. From there he made his way to Atlantic City, where others from his hometown had previously settled. There he met Maria Basille\n\nNaso, Sicily, the woman who would become his wife, who was from the same Sicilian town as he was. And it was Carmen’s mother who provided the family connection to the famous White House Subshop.\n\nMarotta opened his own sandwich shop on the Atlantic City Boardwalk. With the money earned there he purchased Schick’s Hotel on Bay Avenue in Somers Point. The old hotel had been popular with the ferry travelers to Ocean City, but with the trolley and auto causeway, business was slow. The end of World War II was the end of an era, with a number of similar establishments changing hands at the same time including Gregory’s, Charlie’s, the Anchorage and D’Orio’s.\n\nAnthony Marotta took the old German Rathskeller on the first floor and made it a nightclub that would become Tony Marts. At first he brought in bands he knew from Atlantic City, but then slowly expanded. Eventually the room held a capacity of a thousand, with six bars and three stages for continuous music, so when one band finished a set another one kicked in.\n\n“If you asked my father what was the band that made Tony Marts famous,” says Carmen, “he would say Len Carey and the Crackerjacks.” With a New Orleans schtick. “They threw crackerjacks into the crowd instead of beads.” Len Carey, notes Carmen, played with Spike Jones, “who is mentioned in The Band’s song, ‘Up on Cripple Creek’.”\n\nTony Marts had a number of really good house bands that performed practically every night, including the Crackerjacks, the Fall Guys and Levon and the Hawks, who went on to back Bob Dylan, and moved to Woodstock before the big concert, where they became known simply as The Band.\n\nAll of the house bands that played Tony Marts get a chapter in Carmen’s memoirs, as well as the special guests and featured stars like Conway Twitty, Duane Eddie, Joey Dee and the Starlighters, Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels – “It’s all in the scrapbook,” Carmen says of the collection of newspaper ads, reviews and glossy promotional photos of the acts that played there. “The Somers Point Historical Society copied much of the scrapbook and has it,” he notes. And in his book now being written, Carmen will try to dispel some of the myths that keep getting repeated.\n\n“They are calling Robbie Robertson the leader of The Band, but he was the lead guitarist and handsome front man, not the leader,” Carmen says.\n\n“My sister Tina was 17 at the time, and she remembers things better and recalls them telling Dad that they didn’t have a leader and made decisions as a group.” But Dad said, “You gotta have a leader. I need to pay someone.” And since Levon had been with Rockabilly Ronnie Hawks the longest, he became the nominal leader and they were billed as, “Levon and the Hawks.”\n\nSince Bay Avenue was his backyard, when Carmen came of age his father would send him across the street to count heads at Bay Shores to see how the competition was doing.\n\nWhile only a young boy at the time, Carmen recalls the Hawks clearly, watching them play on the second stage as Conway Twitty had the main stage. He sat by the railing and watched the Hawks closely, from a few feet away, recalling, “Richard Manuel was one of the top three rhythm and blues singers ever, and to have three vocalists – Richard, Levon and Rick Danko in the same band was phenomenal.”\n\nCarmen said that most of the songs they played at the time can be found on the “MoonDog Matinee” album. He recalls one song that the crowds really enjoyed, “Little Liza Jane,” and sure enough, I found that they actually recorded a 45 rpm single of “Go Go Liza Jane” in 1965 on the Atco label, with a Robbie Robertson song “He Don’t Love You (And He’ll Break Your Heart)” on the flip side.\n\nAmong the myths that Carmen corrects concerns Dylan. “Bob Dylan never came to Tony Marts,” he says, “but the Hawks were playing there when Dylan called, and it’s probably the most important phone call in the history of rock and roll.”\n\nCarmen continues, “The call came in over the old wooden public phone booth,” but there’s some dispute over who answered the call. The consensus is that Levon answered, telling the others, ‘It’s Bob Dylan,’ and putting his hands over the phone asking, ‘Who’s Bob Dylan?’”\n\nAs Rick Danko said, he explained that Dylan was a folk music guy from the Greenwich Village scene who wrote the song, “Mr. Tambourine Man,” that was then a top 10 hit covered by the California rock band, “The Byrds.” The popularity of that song probably encouraged Dylan to seek a rock band and “go electric,” as they say.\n\nLevon recalled Dylan asking if they could play the Hollywood Bowl and Carnegie Hall with him, and Levon asked, “Who else is on the bill?” and was incredulous when Dylan replied, “Just us.”\n\nCarmen says his dad, “let them out of their contract that required them to play through Labor Day,” and they went on to get booed by the old fogies at Forest Hills for Dylan plugging in and “going electric,” but his then new song, “Like a Rolling Stone,” took the electricity and rock and roll to another level.\n\nFor their replacement over Labor Day 1965, Colonel Kudlets, the Toronto based talent scout and booking agent, sent Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels, who then had a hit on the charts – “Devil with the Blue Dress.”\n\nThe heydays at Tony Marts, like all of the Bay Avenue clubs – Bay Shores, Steel’s Ship Bar, the Anchorage, was the 50s and 60s, and carried over into the early 70s, but eventually Steel’s burnt down and things slowed down on Bay Avenue. When their father retired, Carmen and his brother Tony, Sr. took over management and learned how difficult it was to keep the business going.\n\nEventually the era had to come to an end and did, rather abruptly. Camden County attorney and prosecutor Harris Berman, who owns an Ocean City Boardwalk motel, and his brother sold a Florida hotel, and had to reinvest the profits so they purchased the old, dilapidated Bay Shores, tore it down and built the Waterfront, a rustic wooden building that resembled a ski lodge.\n\nThen Berman set his eyes on Tony Marts and made a deal to purchase it, and they had a major farewell party on the last night. The building was razed and Berman built Egos, the most gregarious disco on the East Coast, where The Band returned to play Somers Point for the last time at a Tony Marts Reunion in the mid-1980s.\n\nBut they didn’t demolish the old Tony Marts before they filmed the epic rock and roll movie, “Eddie and the Cruisers,” while The Band filmed the legendary, “The Last Waltz.”\n\nWhen Robbie Robertson decided that he could no longer travel with The Band, he organized The Last Waltz concert at Winterland in San Francisco that was famously filmed by Martin Scorsese. Carmen believes, and many agree that “The Last Waltz” is one of the best live concert documentaries ever, along with “Woodstock,” a close second.\n\nAlthough the Woodstock concert was originally planned for the town of Woodstock, mainly because of the presence of Dylan and The Band, the town decided they didn’t want such an influx of people so it was actually held at the nearby town of Bethel, N.Y., where the historic marker and annual concerts are held today. And the musical myths keep fading away.\n\nAnother myth that Carmen disputes is about “Eddie and the Cruisers,” the 1983 movie that was filmed at Tony Marts and captured the place for posterity on celluloid before its era ended.\n\n“There was no band called Eddie and the Cruisers,” says Carmen. “They were a Hollywood invention.” But the music wasn’t, as it was by John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band, which he calls one of the most underrated rock and roll bands from the East Coast. They had three top 10 hits from that movie – “On the Darkside,” “Wild Summer Nights” and “Tender Years,” but only sax player Michael “Tunes” Antunes made it into the movie, and his character dies of an overdose and was replaced by sax and jazz bagpipes player Rufus Harley.\n\nCarmen brings “Tunes” back to play the beach concerts on occasion, usually sitting in with the Billy Walton band, unarguably the best new band around.\n\nWhile attending the New Orleans World’s Fair in 1984 Carmen went over to Bourbon Street in the French Quarter. Carmen fell in love with the place and the music.\n\n“It was just like Bay Avenue in its heyday,” he said. He even started his own nightclub with Levon as a partner – Levon Helm’s All American Café, which he now calls an “Ill fated” venture.\n\nIt did, however, give him a real taste of the New Orleans music scene, and he got to know many of the musicians personally, bringing some of them back to the Jersey Shore to play, either on the beach or the Atlantic City Boardwalk, where the Wednesday night gigs are called Marti Gras – AC.\n\nOne of the bands booked for both the Atlantic City Boardwalk and the Somers Point beach in early September is Cyril Neville with Omari Neville of the famous Neville brothers, the first family of New Orleans.\n\nBesides attending the annual New Orleans Music Festival, Carmen and Nancy also visit his family’s hometown village in Sicily, where he still has family and friends. “I took them out to dinner and 30 people showed up.” He laughs, adding that the food there is really good.\n\nAlthough Carmen doesn’t usually book tribute bands, The Weight Band, set for the AC Boardwalk next Wednesday, is different, as they not only play the music of The Band, but include Jimmy Weider – the Woodstock native and lead guitarist who replaced Robbie Robertson in the post-Last Waltz Band. They also include a number of guys who played with the Levon Helm Band, including his last Atlantic City gig headlining the Borgata shortly before he passed away. The Weight Band also plays some original tunes that have the same gritty sound as the original Band.\n\nBand organist Garth Hudson, at 86, is now the last Hawk standing and still lives in Woodstock today. Levon’s daughter, Amy Helm, has her own band that tours regularly and often plays in their Woodstock barn.\n\nBesides his main shows on the beach and boardwalk, Carmen also books bands at The Point, the quaint outdoor bayside Tiki Bar on the site of where Bay Shores and the Waterfront once stood, where the Billy Walton Band is featured every Thursday night during the summer.\n\nWhile the buildings are gone, the stage is still there and Carmen says the music is still alive and really hot, and he will continue producing the music he loves as long as possible."
