        "text": "Bad seat comfort and junk food for sale at high prices\n\nIt got cancelled the night before. there was no compensation. They said it was due to weather but my family flew on southwest and their flight didn’t get cancelled because of weather\n\nWay better than I expected. The plane was so clean- the seats seemed brand new; although not super comfortable as they were lightly cushioned.. The crew helped me lift my bags up to the overhead bin which not many airlines do. I knew there would not be internet or food/snacks but you could buy some if you wanted .\n\nWould have liked there to be a flight crew available so we could fly. None available so they delayed the departure by 10 hour!\n\nOnce again, my flight was delayed. I believe it’s the third time I had a delayed flight with spirit airlines… Very unpleasant.\n\nSpirit cancel my flight. Many times happen in my travels.\n\nThe flight kept getting delayed until it ws finally cancelled due to weather. While the airline was able to get me another flight, it was not for two days, which meant that I had to waste two days of vacation. On top of that, the airline refused to provide any form of compensation for my inconvenience.\n\nCancelled after 3 hour delay with no aside from a rebooking three days later.\n\nIt wasn't bad. Just uncomfortable with the people I was sitting next too. No food on the flight. Everything was good other than that.\n\nWe were delayed departing and also it took 40 min before we were able to exit the plane after landing and there was no AC I felt like I’m going to die"
