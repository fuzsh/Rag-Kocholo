        "text": "ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (WPVI) -- Three men from Philadelphia have been arrested one day after a woman's body was found on the rocks behind an Atlantic City beach resort. Another woman was also found with multiple wounds.\n\nPhiladelphia police and the local FBI helped with the arrests, with the mother of the woman murdered actually leading police to the alleged killer.\n\nGregg Page, 34, has been charged with murder, attempted murder and associated weapons offenses, the Atlantic County Prosecutors Office announced on Friday.\n\nTwo other men, brothers Ryan Schenck, 30, and Ramir Schenck, 27, both also from Philadelphia, were also charged with hindering apprehension in connection with the incident.\n\nCarley Elbert, 32, from Sewell, and Kamille Stewart, 29, from Pleasantville, were found around 4:41 a.m. on Thursday near the jetty in the unit block of N. Maine Avenue behind the Flagship Resort, according to police.\n\nResponding officers found Stewart conscious but she appeared to have multiple wounds. She was transported to AtlantiCare Medical Center. She remains in serious condition in the hospital.\n\nElbert was unresponsive and pronounced dead at the scene. She was said to be wearing a bathing suit at the time.\n\n\"Oh my God...what? That throws me off, especially in this area. What would a woman be doing around here with a bathing suit? You can't swim around here. The most you can do is fish or walk on the rocks,\" questioned Talira Williams of Atlantic City.\n\nSecurity at the Flagship resort turned over their surveillance video to police.\n\nThey told Action News the video showed a car pulling up just after 2 a.m., with five people getting out. They walk the boardwalk. About 20 minutes later, the video reportedly shows just two men returning before getting in the car and driving off.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint obtained by Action News, Page fled in a car belonging to one of the victims. He was allegedly seen on video driving the car and discarding it at another location. He was then reportedly picked up by his co-conspirators and fled in another car to Philadelphia, said investigators.\n\nWhile detectives were interviewing Elbert's mom, Nancy, Thursday afternoon in her home, she saw her daughter's phone moving, so she pinged it.\n\n\"Then, when I did it again, I saw this guy's address,\" Nancy said.\n\nOfficers were able to track Elbert's cell phone to the 6100 block of Mulberry Street in Philadelphia. Exclusive video shows officers, including the FBI, arresting the three men.\n\nThose closest to Elbert are dumbfounded as to what the motive was behind her murder. She had just gone into remission from a serious chronic illness.\n\n\"The most kind-hearted, beautiful soul ... she would do nothing but help others,\" said Tracy Murray of Sewell.\n\n\"I hope you rot in hell. I'll see this to the end for justice for my Carley. She didn't deserve to go out like this,\" Nancy said.\n\nAll three individuals are being held behind bars in Philadelphia pending an extradition to New Jersey.\n\nPreliminary investigation revealed that both women appear to have been shot in the head. However, the official cause and manner of Elbert's death are pending an autopsy by the Southern Regional Medical Examiner's Office.\n\nThe incident remains under investigation."
