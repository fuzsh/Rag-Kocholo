        "text": "SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for those who are watching Boardwalk Empire on Sky Atlantic. Don't read on if you haven't seen the third episode – and if you've seen more of the series, please be aware that other readers may not have done so …\n\nKathy Sweeney's episode two blog\n\n\"Down here? What laws?\" Agent Van Alden\n\nEpisode two ended with the discovery that one of the bullet-ridden victims from the robbery of the whiskey shipment had managed stay alive in the woods by virtue of being fat. This episode opens with the bloody man being pushed on a hospital bed. Elias, who needs to brush up on his bedside manner, attempts to suffocate him with his own pillow, but is interrupted by a persistent Agent Van Alden.\n\nBehind his religious veneer, Van Alden is proving to be a decidedly sadistic character. In one of the best scenes yet, he kidnaps the dying witness and dumps him on a horrified dentist, who is forced him to revive him with a syringe of cocaine in the gums. The witness perks up long enough to deliver the line \"You should fuck your grandmother with your faggot penis\" in Yiddish. Van Alden, usually so rule-abiding that he drinks milk with his evening meal, shoves his fist into the man's gaping stomach wound, forcing him to give up Jimmy's name. Then, having pretty much tortured him to death he quotes the Book of Revelation while wiping the blood from his hands. Is this the most unsettling Bible reading since Samuel L Jackson quoted Ezekiel in Pulp Fiction?\n\n\"If I'da known this was the cure, I'da taken my chances with the Huns.\" Lucky Luciano\n\nShortly after, a urologist cures Lucky Luciano's gonorrhea by using medieval dentistry tools and zapping it with zinc sulphate. Luciano confesses he's sometimes impotent, but as he's so violently sociopathic, he almost kills the doctor, Joe Pesci style, to make sure he keeps it secret. It's hard to work out whether Broadwalk Empire is in awe of, or disgusted by, this kind of unreconstructed masculinity.\n\n\"It's an election year. The last thing we need is a race war.\" Nucky Thompson\n\nHappily, we see much more of Chalky White, who seems a pretty shrewd operator. Dressed in a long red overcoat and chomping a cigar, he oozes confidence – not to mention understated menace. Like The Wire's Omar, Chalky is a character feels no reason to prove himself to anyone. He and Nucky form an uneasy alliance, with some entertaining cultural misunderstandings – a recurring theme throughout the series. When Chalky remarks that he's sensitive \"as a baby's ass, motherfucker\", during negotiations, Nucky is nonplussed: \"What's 'motherfucker' mean?\" It's all in the way Buscemi says it. But when Chalky's driver is hanged, and the words \"liquor kills\" scratched into the paintwork on his car, you can't help thinking that Omar would have hunted down the killer, shotgun in hand. Then again there's still time for that to happen... By the way, what does everyone think about HBO alumni cropping up in so many of their shows? Is it a good thing, or a distraction?\n\nMeanwhile Nucky's permanently naked girlfriend Lucy tells him in her annoying accent that he was \"smart not to have children,\" a comment that seems to resonate with Nucky. He has an inscrutable faraway look, suggesting that he wishes he had children before his wife died. Or could it be that he already does have a child, and we just don't know it yet? Or maybe he does wants to settle down – with Margaret? Buscemi is starting to bring a mesmerising uneasiness to his role as Nucky.\n\n\"I used to think you'd own the world one day. You were like the kid in that [Horatio] Alger story, Ragged Dick. You did everything right. And then ...\" Nucky\n\nThings aren't going well for Jimmy, who has been seething with jealousy over Angela's possible relationship with the boardwalk photographer. Again there is a slight feeling of deja vu; it's not unlike a scene from Raging Bull. His mother confronts Nucky for not looking after him, but it could be that he is doing exactly that by banishing Jimmy from Atlantic City (to Chicago), what with Agent Van Alden and Rothstein putting a hit out on him. Does anyone think they sound like two parents discussing their child? And what do people think about Michael Pitt's performance as Jimmy – is he a poor man's Leonardo Di Caprio? With his departure, it feels like the end of the first act. I suspect he'll be back, with Al Capone in tow hopefully.\n\nVerdict\n\nAs Mad Men and The Sopranos have demonstrated there's nothing intrinsically wrong with a drama unfolding slowly. Three episodes in, its becoming clear that prohibition is financially the best thing that's happened to Nucky and his villainous friends. However, it seems to be taking an existential toll on Nucky now that there is more money to be made, and more grasping villains to contend with. Does tracking mud through the hallway of the hotel represent him leaving a trail and setting himself up to get caught? Talk about symbolism.\n\nNotes\n\nJimmy is reading Sinclair Lewis's road book Free Air, soon to be made into a 1922 road movie.\n\nWhen Nucky and Chalky talk about how many watered-down bottles they can get from a pure one it's another deja vu moment, recalling the scenes from The Wire when the dealers discuss \"stepping on pure product\".\n\nIn Atlantic City 22% of the population were black, hence Nucky's courting of their vote."
