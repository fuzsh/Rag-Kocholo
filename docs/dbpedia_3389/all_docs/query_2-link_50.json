        "text": "Several of Kentucky's most beloved musical heroes have roots in Muhlenberg County.\n\nThat includes the Everly Brothers, whose homecoming concerts drew thousands of people to the area.\n\nCentral City is now home to a new park that pays homage to their musical heritage.\n\nOur Laura Rogers takes us there for another stop in our ongoing series, Mondays on Main.\n\nPeople say it was it.\n\nThe water was what's in the air.\n\nFrom the Everly Brothers.\n\nKnown for initially country, then the birth of rock and roll too.\n\nJohn Prine.\n\nAmerican Grammy Awards, Glory.\n\nMusic and Muhlenberg County have a long standing connection, a significance now immortalized by bronze statues and the center of central City.\n\nWe are sitting at Farmer's Bank and Trust Festival Square in downtown Central City.\n\nIt all began back in the 1980s when the Everly Brothers, who had roots in the area.\n\nThey were here regularly when they were growing up, caught.\n\nWind that the Central City Police Department needed new radios.\n\nAnd they called up here and out of clear blue and civil war by radios.\n\nAt City Parade to thank them for their generosity.\n\nTurned into a homecoming concert.\n\nThat single concert actually led to 15 years of Everly Brothers homecoming music festivals.\n\nAnd a regular guest throughout those years was John Prine.\n\nThose that remember Paradise and Daddy Want to take Me Back to Myanmar.\n\nOur county.\n\nMuhlenberg County is recognized all over the world because of that song.\n\nYou can learn more about the city's musical heritage and homegrown artists like Merle Travis, thumb picking legend Mose Rager and flutist Jim Walker here at the Muhlenberg County Music Museum.\n\nWe've now had guests from every state plus Washington, D.C. and 29 different countries.\n\nAnd while they're here, they can also explore the Kentucky Motorsports Museum and Hall of Fame and Downtown Central City.\n\nI love small towns.\n\nRetired schoolteacher Peggy Shoemaker and her close friend Terry opened Coffee Central just a few years ago.\n\nGreen Coffee beans.\n\nWe kind of questioned around what the central city needed and so many people said a coffee shop.\n\nAnd when they heard that we were going to open a coffee shop here, it brought some excitement to the town.\n\nI love that our community is very close knit.\n\nAllison Randall and her mother opened Southern Pine to bring more shopping and retail to Central City.\n\nMy mom just asked me one day, Why don't we do this?\n\nWhy don't we start our own business?\n\nThe shop is named after their family farm and Muhlenberg County.\n\nIt's just blocks away from the new Festival Square.\n\nIt's a huge source of pride.\n\nNever dreamed we'd have something like this in our county central city.\n\nThe city and fiscal court provided some funding, but much of the money came from across the country and beyond.\n\nSome Everly Brothers fans in Europe donated when they found out through social media that we were doing this.\n\nMike Mercer says he's also proud the majority of the project.\n\nEverything about the statues was created by local talent shocks.\n\nA lot of people that all of this could get done with Central City, Newburgh County Entrepreneurs.\n\nMusic runs deep in Middleburg County.\n\nAnd going back to that original question of why.\n\nDr. Freddie Mays believes it all goes back to the region's coal mining history.\n\nThey would gather on porches at the end of the day and do something.\n\nSo music was what got it all started.\n\nIt was the coal mining heritage of playing music and singing music and getting together.\n\nProject organizers hope this park will also encourage people to come together, building on a strong foundation of community pride.\n\nHopefully it's going to be something that people will come to and want to see for years to come.\n\nFor Kentucky Edition, I'm Laura Rogers.\n\nThank you, Laura Rogers.\n\nFestival Square also pays tribute to the community volunteers who helped the Everly Brothers homecoming take place all those years.\n\nTheir largest crowd drew 20,000 people to downtown Central City."
