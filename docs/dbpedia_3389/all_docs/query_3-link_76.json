        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. Barney Stinson became friends with Ted, Marshall and Lily after meeting Ted in 2001 where?\n\nAnswer: At a urinal\n\nThey met in the men's room at MacLaren's Pub. Barney made up a story about a deaf brother, which Ted believed, planning to use it on a girl. 15 minutes later, Barney goes over to Ted and gets him to pretend to be his deaf brother in front of a girl named Audrey. Ted says to Audrey (in sign language) that Barney is lying, and tells her to give him a fake phone number, although Barney did not realise this for several years (as he did not speak sign language).\n\n2. Which of the following is one of Barney's nicknames?\n\nAnswer: Swarley\n\n\"Big Fudge\" is one of Marshall's nicknames. Lily is called \"Chewbacca\" by Ted and \"Doctor X\" is the name Ted used for his radio show at Wesleyan University.\n\n\"Swarley\" is a nickname assigned to Barney in the episode of the same name; at a coffee shop, the barista mistakenly writes \"Swarley\" instead of \"Barney\" on his cup. This prompts the gang to make a series of jokes and pranks involving the name; they come up with many more nicknames based on \"Swarley\", like \"Bob Swarley-man\", \"Swarlos\" and \"Swar-wait-for-it-ley\".\n\n3. Does Barney win the Slap Bet against Marshall?\n\nAnswer: No\n\nUpon learning that Robin refuses to go to malls, Barney and Marshall make a \"Slap Bet\", with the loser getting slapped by the other one. Barney maintains that the reason was related to porn. Throughout the episode \"Slap Bet\", each thinks they are correct and slaps the other several times, but it was eventually revealed that Barney was incorrect (Robin refuses to go to the mall because of a pop song she sang based on malls).\n\nMarshall is allowed to slap Barney five times at any point he pleases, and in season 7 gains three further slaps; he uses these slaps of the course of eight years, with the first being given in 2006 (\"Slap Bet\", season 2) and the last being given on Barney's wedding day in 2013 (\"The End of the Aisle\", season 9).\n\n4. Barney's mother told him that a celebrity was his father, and although Barney might not truly believe this, he maintains it is true until he discovers his real dad. Who is this celebrity?\n\nAnswer: Bob Barker\n\nIn \"Showdown\", Barney goes on \"The Price is Right\" with the intention of telling Bob Barker that he is his son. Barney wins both showcases after playing perfectly throughout the entire game, but does not tell Bob Barker that he is his son. He says to the gang that \"if you've lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true\", although maintains that this refers to Barker not being able to handle the truth.\n\n5. Barney displays a skill for what in many episodes?\n\nAnswer: Magic\n\nMarshall is the one who always wins games, as shown in \"Game Night\". Lily's paintings are the subject of several storylines. Barney's skill is doing magic tricks.\n\nBarney shows off his magic in many episodes: for instance, in \"The Scorpion and the Toad\" he uses it to pick up women. In \"Intervention\", the gang holds an intervention to stop Barney from doing fire-related magic. In \"The Magician's Code\" his proposal involves a magic trick. In \"Weekend at Barney's\", he uses lots of magic equipment to illustrate his point in a speech to Robin, including a dove, a wand, a fake deck of cards and three bouquets of flower.\n\n6. The exact nature of Barney's job at Goliath National Bank is not revealed until the final season. Until then, he deflects any questions about his job by saying what?\n\nAnswer: Please\n\nIn \"Unpause\", his job is finally revealed to be \"P.L.E.A.S.E.\", an acronym meaning \"Provide Legal Exculpation and Sign Everything\". His job is simply to sign stuff, as a scapegoat for GNB and AltruCell - it was given to him by Greg Fisher, one of his enemies. Shortly after telling this to the gang, he has Greg arrested for fraud and other crimes, having learned this information through his job.\n\n7. This catchphrase is first used by Barney to refer to his attempt at sleeping with Marshall's professor. What is it?\n\nAnswer: Challenge accepted\n\n\"Challenge accepted\" is a phrase Barney often uses when accepting \"challenges\" no-one ever told him to do. Various challenges include talking his way out of a speeding ticket, getting a girl's phone number while speaking like a dolphin, completing the \"Murtaugh List\" and doing a split in mid-air.\n\n8. Barney loves high fives and often uses them. Which of these variations on the high five has Barney NOT created?\n\nAnswer: High Cinque\n\n\"Phone Five\" is one of the first of Barney's high fives in the show, taking place in \"Sweet Taste of Liberty\". Participants, during a phone call with each other, are supposed to high five their phone, although Ted refuses to do this.\n\n\"Self Five\" is simply a high five with yourself. Used in several episodes, Barney first does it in \"Slutty Pumpkin\".\n\n\"High V\" is the Roman equivalent of a high five. It occurs in a story made up by Barney in \"Desperation Day\".\n\nSome of my other favourites include the Relapse Five, Solemn Low Five, Condolence Five and High Infinity.\n\n9. Although Barney has lots of one-night stands, he is also involved in some serious relationships. Which of these is NOT a person he has been in a long-term relationship with?\n\nAnswer: Victoria\n\nVictoria was one of Ted's girlfriends.\n\nNora first appears in \"Desperation Day\" (season 6) and eventually agrees to go out with Barney. Unfortunately, he ends up cheating on her with Robin, and they break up.\n\nQuinn, a stripper, first appears in \"The Drunk Train\" (season 7). Barney and Quinn become engaged in the finale of season 7, but become the first couple victim to \"The Autumn of Break-Ups\" early in season 8 after arguing over pre-nups.\n\nRobin and Barney date during season 5, and cheat on their respective partners together in season 7. After an elaborate \"play\" by Barney, spanning multiple episodes, they become engaged in season 8. The entire ninth season takes place at their wedding, but they become divorced in 2016 due to issues with Robin travelling for work.\n\n10. Finally, my favourite recurring joke in the show: this number appears all over the place when it comes to Barney, from fake statistics to blog posts. Which number is it?\n\nAnswer: 83\n\nTed points out in \"Brunch\" that Barney always uses the number 83 when making up statistics. He uses it everywhere; the Bro Code has had 83 amendments, the \"Great Dude Shortage\" occurred in 1883 and it supposedly takes a woman 8.3 seconds to decide whether to sleep with someone.\n\nSource: Author AdamM7\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor ladymacb29 before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
