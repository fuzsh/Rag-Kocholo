        "text": "Onward Season 2! Some classics in this first half of the season include the infamous Slap Bet, Swarley, Crazy Eyes and who could forget, Robin Sparkles.\n\n2×01 – Where were we?\n\nBarney statistic: An average male brain can only store a finite number of boob pictures, or bpegs.\n\nBarney’s theory is that it is impossible to get over a woman until you can stop picturing her naked or imagining her boobs. He takes Marshall out to a strip club so he can ‘overwrite’ his memories of Lily with other naked women.\n\n2×02 – The Scorpion and the Toad\n\nBarney’s Trick #7 – Create a mystery about your self to intrigue the girls into hanging out with you all night.\n\nBarney’s Rules for Mating without Dating, Lesson 2 Corrollary 5 – Make a beautiful woman feel self conscious and unattractive and she’ll be putty in your hands.\n\nHangover cures – After a night of Tequila trying to pry out the truth of her unhappiness from Lily, she, Ted & Robin all have killer hangovers the next day. They each have their own remedies though – Lily orders the greastiest dirtiest tuna melt and a milkshake, Ted gets gravy, and Robin… is still drunk from the night before.\n\nBeing Single – Barney convinces Marshall to be his wingman by telling him that being single is like being in a candy store. But after Barney repeatedly steals Marshall’s targets, he tells Marshall that it’s a lawless post-apocalytic wasteland and every hombre for himself.\n\n2×03 – Brunch\n\nRackJacked – Barney’s term for a wingman stealing his Bro’s target. He complains of Ted’s dad ‘rack-jacking’ him when he makes out with Wendy the Waitress.\n\nBarney Statistic – 83% of married people married longer than 6 months are seeing someone on the side\n\nTed then says that Barney always use the number 83% when he makes up a statistic\n\n2×04 – Ted Mosby, Architect\n\nArchitects – Ted believes that girls think that architects are boring, but Barney begs to differ; his rationale is that architects create something out of nothing, like God, and nothing is hotter than God, and when said with the right attitude, the architect job title is very hot. Turns out Barney, using the “Ted Mosby, Architect” line manages to pick up girls and lots of attention, leading Robin and Lily on a wild goose chase to catch the ‘cheating Ted’.\n\n2×05 – World’s Greatest Couple\n\nStoveinkerator – a combination of a Stove, oven, sink and refrigerator\n\nBeing in a couple – Marshall hates being single because there’s no one to go to concerts with, go to farmer’s markets with and to go to brunch with. Barney’s definition of being in a couple is refurnishing the apartment, staying in on a friday night to watch letterman and sleeping in the same bed without having sex.\n\n2×06 – Aldrin Justice\n\nCougar – a woman in her forties, single and on the prowl, looking for a younger man. One can identify a cougar by several characteristics:\n\nHair – keeps up to date with current hairstyles for ‘camouflage’\n\nBlouse – displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate the prey (if you’re watching them bounce, she’s about to pounce)\n\nClaws – long and sharp to ward off rival females, or open alimony cheques\n\nLily’s Personal Brand of Justice – Lily takes away mean people’s personal effects to teach them a lesson, something she used to do to teach her kindergarten kids a lesson. She shoplifted a pair of Khakis when the shop assistant was rude to Robin, and she steal Ted’s boss’s PeteRosePeteRosePeteRose baseball when he is mean to everyone. Ted has to fire her eventually, but ultimately when he thanks her for giving him the guts to pitch his building idea to the client, she returns him the screws from his office desk chair which she had taken.\n\n2×07 – Swarley\n\nSwarley – What everyone starts calling Barney after the name on his coffee cup turns out to be Swarley instead of Barney. Other variations include Ol’ Swarls, Swarl-waitforit-Lee, Swarlay, Bob Swarley-man, Swarls Barkley, Swarlos. Barney gets really pissed off and tries several times to get them to stop calling him Swarley to no avail.\n\nTed’s Look – Ted’s puppy dog/earnest face – eyes looking up, head down, hands in pocket, shoulders up, head slightly tilted conveying shy vulnerability. He teaches it to Marshall and helps him score the hot coffee girl’s phone number. Robin loves the look as well.\n\nCrazy Eyes – A swirly pink whirlpool in a hot girl’s eyes, an indicator of future mental instability. Ted and Barney tell Marshall he has to ditch his new date Chloe because she has the crazy eyes and can’t see it because he has ‘haven’t-been-laid-in-awhile’ blindness. Barney’s Crazy Eyes encounter involved a girl who wanted to have a threesome with her stuffed bear while Ted’s date is a violent raging car smasher. Chloe’s craziness manifests when she trashes the apartment after Marshall leaves her up there mid-date to get back together with Lily.\n\nThe male equivalent is Jerk Nails – a guy with perfect fingernails.\n\n2×08 – Atlantic City\n\nXing-hai-shi-bu-xing – An odd Chinese gambling game that Barney plays to win the money that Lily and Marshall need to get married. Loosely translated from Chinese, it means “Can or Cannot”, and involves mahjong tiles, seat changing, spinning a wheel and ends with finding a jelly bean. Marshall and Barney are the only people who seem to understand what is going on in this game.\n\n2×09 – Slap Bet\n\nThe Oh Moment – Barney’s theory is that the more you know about a person, the more change you have of hitting the fatal ‘Oh Moment’, the moment you find out something about a person that is a dealbreaker, so one should postpone finding out stuff about the other person as long as possible.\n\nSlap Bet – the ultimate wager that Marshall and Barney have when they try to guess what Robin’s secret fear of malls is. Barney thinks it was porn, Marshall thinks she got married at the mall. The Slap Bet means that the person who’s ultimately right can slap the other person in the face as hard as he can, but no rings. Lily’s against it at first, but fully jumps into it when they appoint her Slap Bet Commissioner.\n\nRobin lies to Ted about getting married, which results in Barney getting slapped, hard. After finding out that Robin wasn’t really married, Lily awards Barney 3 slaps – 1 for lying and 2 for premature slapping. When a video surfaces of Robin Sparkles, the front bit is seemingly porny… and Marshall gets slapped at ‘Slap o’clock’, though it turns out just to be the preface to a teeny bop MTV.\n\nSlap Bet Commissioner Lily imposes a penalty on Barney – 10 slaps right there and then, or 5 slaps that can be doled out from now to eternity. Barney picks the latter, though he would live in constant fear of the next slap. Marshall doles out the first unwitting slap while the gang is aw-ing over Ted and Robin.\n\nRobin Sparkles – The gang eventually find out that Robin was a teenage popstar in a really cheesy MTV and a minor hit “Let’s go to the mall”, which she had to promote for a year, and is the reason why she hates malls nowadays. Check out the full video below, and her myspace page, if they had myspace back in the day…\n\n2×10 – Single Stamina\n\nCouple Hibernation mode – where couples stay in all day and refuse to go out. Marshall-Lily and Ted-Robin were deep in CH mode, leaving poor Barney stranded to do things on his own and be his own wingman.\n\nSingles Stamina / Couples Coma – How to tell the singles from the couples in a bar. Singles are always on their feet for manouvrability, and like to pop shots while the couples, tired from coming out of the house are obsessed with finding a seat and drink more sedate drinks like wine. Other tell tale signs of Couples Coma include turning down shots and hot guys, texting in a crowded bar and couple wall paper on handphones."
