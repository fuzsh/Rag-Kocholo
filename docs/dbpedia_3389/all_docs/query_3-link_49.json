        "text": "The more I watch this episode, the more I love it. This is the fourth time I’ve watched season one and have a lot of the dialogue memorized because of that. “The Sweet Taste of Liberty” is the first filler episode, meaning the story to find the mother is not furthered. Future Ted and his children even have a discussion at the end of the episode about how this story doesn’t pertain to the mother. Regardless of the plot, this episode is great because it has the How I Met Your Mother humor that you grow to love and the sincere life discussion that encourages you to get out of bed in the morning.\n\nThe story begins with the gang trying to decide where to spend the evening. Barney convinces Ted to come with him and skip MacLaren’s because that is what Ted always does. While Barney is convincing Ted to come with him, he introduces his first “high five” variation, the “phone five.” Barney leads Ted to the airport to pick someone up and by “pick someone up,” Barney means pick up attractive girls. While Ted and Barney are hunting for airport tail, Marshall is at home studying and Lily and Robin are at MacLaren’s having a girls’ night.\n\nTed and Barney literally run into two attractive girls and decide to follow them to Philadelphia. Marshall is contacted by Barney and Ted to head to Philadelphia because it is going to be “legendary.” After chatting up the girls on the plane, Ted and Barney discover the girls are both dating linebackers for the Philadelphia Eagles. As the plane lands, airport security detain Ted and Barney for leaving their suspicious bags in the previous airport. Ted tries to get Barney to tell the truth to airport security but he thinks it’s best to stick with the cover story he told the girls about being “international businessmen going to an international business meeting.” Security eventually releases the two after it is revealed that Barney’s bags are filled with condoms and a PowerBar. Ted is ready to come home, to his normal bar, but Barney has him convinced that going to a Sascha, the female security guard’s house, will be “legend..wait for it…and I hope you’re not lactose intolerant ’cause the second word is dairy! Legendary!”\n\nLily is having a horrible time at MacLaren’s because guys are hitting on Robin and ignoring her. Lily tries to get some attention by taking off her engagement ring per Marshall’s idea but only attracts a gay guy that is more concerned about the grape stain on her butt. Marshall pulls a 180 to head to MacLaren’s when he hears that a guy is chatting up Lily from Robin. Robin confronts Lily about her behavior and learns that Lily hasn’t been single since high school and wanted to experience guys chasing her. Robin helps Lily see the light by eloquently explaining that all the girls in the bar are hoping to catch what she already caught, a great guy like Marshall. The Hallmark moment is interrupted when Marshall tries to fight the gay guy for cleaning the grape stain off Lily but is quickly defused when Marshall finds out the guy is gay. Unfortunately for Marshall, the gay guy’s boyfriend isn’t pleased when Marshall hugs the gay guy out of relief he doesn’t have to fight him.\n\nMeanwhile, Ted and Barney are at Sascha’s grandpa’s basement drinking hard lemonade with two other guys and Sascha. Despite the fact that the party is a dud, Barney is convinced the night can still be legendary by licking the Liberty Bell thanks to one of the guys in the basement. Ted has had enough “legendary” adventures for one night and wants to head back to New York. In the cab back to the Philadelphia airport, Ted asks Barney why he has to go with him, why can’t Barney go to the Liberty Bell alone? Barney breaks for the first time from his usual party-goer attitude and tells Ted, “because you’re my best friend, all right? You don’t have to tell me I’m yours. But the way I see it, we’re a team. Without you, I’m just the dynamic uno.” Ted, moved by Barney’s sentiment, agrees to go lick the Liberty Bell. Future Ted ends the episode saying, “and that was when I realized why I hung out with Barney. I never got where I thought I wanted to go, but I always got a great story.”\n\nThis episode showcases my favorite aspect of How I Met Your Mother, relatability. I have a close group of friends, most of us grew up together. We all have different personalities and often wonder why we still hang out together after all these years. I think it is summed up by future Ted’s quote at the end. I have been in some situations that I hated because of my friends but years later, I look back and laugh.\n\nThere are multiple running gags in the episode that show case Barney, namely his continued use of legendary, having Ted look him in the eyes and his high five variation. My favorite scene is when Ted is begging Barney to tell the truth to airport security and Barney takes a deep breath, faces the security officer and says, “we are international businessmen!”\n\nHere is a picture of Lily’s goofy face from the bar for laughs. Cheers!\n\nEpisode two picks up a couple of weeks after the pilot episode. Ted has decided to keep his distance from Robin because he doesn’t lover her and it was just a phase. Ted, Marshall and Barney run into Lily having drinks with Robin at MacLaren’s, notice a pattern here? Robin is a tv reporter for Metro News 1 and heads back to work for the late broadcast. Naturally being the hopeless romantic he is, Ted realizes he is still in love with Robin and has to win her back. Lily’s loose tongue lets slip that Robin talked about Ted and that she has a little crush on him but that he comes on strong. Of course Ted decides to act casual to prove to Robin he isn’t in love with her because when you are in love the dumbest ideas make the most sense. And speaking of dumb ideas, Ted throws a party so he can spend time with Robin without it seeming like a date.\n\nWhile at the party, Barney does his best to convince Ted to forget about Robin and find the girl that doesn’t know anyone. Yes, another theory is introduced in this episode. The theory goes that at almost every party in New York City, there is on girl who has no clue who’s party she is at or any one at the party, making her a prime target for a random hook up. The party ends and Robin is a no show. The following day, Robin calls Ted to apologize for being stuck at work and causing her to miss the party. Ted plays it “casual” and pretends to not care but jumps at the chance to throw a second party when Robin mentions she wished the party was that night. Again the party is crawling with people and again Robin is a no show. The following morning Robin calls Ted to apologize for being stuck at work for the second night in a row. My favorite scene is during this phone call, Ted is trying to act “casual” again. His response to Robin’s apology is, “ain’t no thing but a chicken wing mamasita” and then proceeds to ask himself who is he for talking like that. Ted throws a third party because Robin mentions being free that night.\n\nThe third party is a flop. There is hardly anyone in the apartment and most of the crowd is guys. Marshall frustrated he hasn’t had a chance to write a 25 page paper for law school due to the multiple parties, yells at Ted that Robin isn’t coming to the party for a third time and to give up. Robin was standing in the kitchen with Lily the whole time. Ted quick on his feet tells Robin he threw the parties to introduce her to Carlos. (Those of you who watch Walking Dead will recognize Carlos as Shane from the first two seasons.) Later, Carlos and Robin head to the roof and Ted decides to interrupt being that the roof was where he wanted to take Robin.\n\nAfter Ted and Robin air their true feelings on the night, they share their first kiss on the roof. Ted realizes he is most certainly in love with Robin and wants to be more than something casual. This is the first time Robin shares her feelings on marriage and children or should I say lack there of. Ultimately, Ted and Robin decide to be just friends and head to the bar with the rest of the gang. While at MacLaren’s, Robin tells Ted he is a catch and she is going to help him find the lucky girl. Robin then plays our favorite ice breaker game, “have you met Ted?”\n\n“Purple Giraffe” is a decent episode compared to episode one. The audience does get the satisfaction of Ted and Robin’s first kiss but the episode ends with Ted and Robin agreeing to be just friends. Ted shows in this episode that he is infatuated deeply with Robin and will doing anything to have a connection with her.\n\nSPOILER ALERT: Do not read further if you don’t want to know the future\n\nThis episode is where the “Color Theory” starts.\n\nAnd so it begins. I am excited and nervous to start this review for How I Met Your Mother. This will be my first time reviewing a tv show, hopefully it will good and get better. I plan on reviewing the episodes as a first time viewer. I will have a few pieces of information to add from future episodes but I will designate those sections with a SPOILER ALERT.\n\n“Pilot” is an important episode because it tells the viewer the premise of the show. We begin the show in the year 2030. The show’s protagonist, Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnour), is telling his children how he met their mother and flashes back to 2005. Ted is a 27 year old architect living in Manhattan’s Upper Westside with his best friend and, Marshall Eriksen (played by Jason Segal). Marshall is preparing to propose to his long time girlfriend, Lily Aldrin (played by Alyson Hannigan). Marshall practices proposing to Ted and we start the episode with a laugh and the laugh track. I would like to point out that I dislike the laugh track in tv shows but you learn to ignore it. While Marshall is making dinner and preparing to propose, Ted calls Barney and they agree to meet up, Barney also tells Ted to “suit up” for the first time. This proposal has Ted confiding in his other best friend, Barney Stinson (played by Neil Patrick Harris) that he wants destiny to point him in the direction of his future wife. Barney and Ted are discussing marriage at their favorite bar, MacLaren’s, when Ted looks on the other side of the bar and locks eyes with Robin Scherbatsky (played by Cobie Smulders).\n\nAs Ted is trying to work up a plan to talk with Robin, Barney approaches her and plays his favorite bar game by asking her, “have you met Ted?” breaking the ice. Ted flirts with Robin and sets up a date for the following night. Ted comes home the following night to the newly engaged Lily and Marshall, to explain his perfect date with Robin. To quote Ted, “she likes dogs, likes scotch and can quote obscure lines from Ghostbusters.” Robin is shown quoting, “Ray when someone asks if you’re a god, you say yes.” This is the moment for me personally that I fell in love with the show. I am a sucker for pop culture references and How I Met Your Mother will have a lot in the future. The icing on the cake for Ted’s perfect woman was her dislike of olives. Ted explains his “Olive Theory.” Lily and Marshall are such a great couple because Marshall hates olives and Lily loves them, they “balance” as Ted puts it. Ted walks Robin home and his date ends in a sense of satisfaction, like your true friends in real life Ted is made fun of for not kissing Robin.\n\nTed, Lily, Marshall and Barney all head back to MacLaren’s to debate whether Ted should have kissed Robin and convince Ted he needs to kiss her tonight before she leaves for Orlando for a week. The gang travels with Ted to Robin’s apartment for moral support and because Barney convinced Ted to suit up. Ted is invited into Robin’s apartment by showing her the blue french horn he stole for her. The restaurant that Ted and Robin had dinner at had a blue french horn on the wall that Robin mentioned she wanted. One of the great lines from this episode is when Ted tell the gang the reason he stole the blue french horn is because “everyone brings flowers” showcasing Ted’s die hard romantic side.\n\nEverything is going great for Ted in Robin’s apartment. He and Robin are slow dancing to Otis Redding’s “Cigarettes and Coffee,” (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyMg-EhZ1Es) while giving each other compliments. I love Otis Redding but didn’t know the song before this episode, it has been on repeat on my iPhone. Ted tells Robin he is in love with her, completely ruining the mood and causing Robin to walk him out of her apartment. While on the street Ted gives a great speech about how bad he is at being single and that he knows he would make a great husband if given the chance. He and Robin say their goodbyes and have a long, passionate, somewhat strange handshake and Ted heads back to MacLaren’s to meet his friends plus the cab driver, Ranjit. Ranjit is a small reoccurring character who will show up from time to time.Ted ends the episode by telling his kids that later on Robin said the long, passionate handshake was a sign to kiss her and that was the story of how he met their Aunt Robin.\n\nThe pilot is a strong episode that gives us some great scenes and sets up the future story. My favorite scene is the date where Robin quotes Ghostbusters and Ted refers to the blue french horn as a “smurf penis”. The dance scene with “Cigarettes and Coffee” is the first of multiple future memorable moments tied with music. Thanks for reading the pilot review. It’s late and I’m too tired to go on.\n\nCheers.\n\nDecember 23, 2005\n\nLife is funny, you like to think that you know the times in your life that are important and you will remember them. My experiences have led me to believe that you don’t know the important moments in your life until they have passed. I didn’t realize it until much later that December 23, 2005 would be so important to me. December 23, 2005 was the last Christmas my parents were married to each other.\n\nI know I am rolling a few days in with December 23, but you have to understand that my family does not know how to stay married and that has led me to having four different Christmases to attend. Quite often my normal holiday schedule will look like this:\n\n– Aunt Janette’s (Dad’s aunt’s side) the weekend before or after Christmas\n\n– Grandma Teri’s (Dad’s mother’s side) Christmas day around noon\n\n– Grandma Vickie’s (Dad’s step mother’s side) Christmas day at six\n\n– Grandma Vicki’s (Mom’s side) Christmas Eve at six\n\nI was unaware at the time that my parent’s marriage was failing. They tried their best to keep me in the dark until I graduated from high school, six months later. I look back at Christmas 2005 and realize that was the last Christmas that I was a child. My parents divorce hit me really hard. Looking back, I realize they were too young to truly know who they were or what they wanted out of life.\n\nWhen my parents were married, we were able to group a couple of family branches together and have a super Christmas with about 25 people. After the divorce, we went to the aforementioned schedule. That schedule is not only tiring, but also sucks the holiday spirit out of Christmas. I openly admit to people that I am not a religious person; the holidays to me are not about religion. The holidays are about getting together with your family and celebrating another year together. My holiday now is spent trying to figure out how to cram every Christmas together and how much longer I have before moving on to the next stop.\n\nMy parents divorce ultimately led to me the biggest lesson from parents, do not get married young, but I am haunted by my ghost from December 23, 2005. I am haunted by the feeling that I am not enjoying the holidays, that my family is getting older and I am staying the same age. I envy that boy from 2005. He did not not know a time when his parents were not together, a time when his family was not complete. He had not graduated college and realized there was more he should have done. He had not lost some of the family that he has wrote about. All that boy knew was high school was almost over and this would be the best Christmas so far. Unfortunately is was the best Christmas ever.\n\nFor the one person who hasn’t heard of Phil Robertson, “Duck Dynasty” and his recent comments towards gays and African Americans, but managed to stumble upon my blog, I present to you my understanding and personal thoughts on the issue.\n\nMy Facebook newsfeed, twitter account and the rest of the U.S. have been talking about tv personality, Phil Robertson, and his recent comments towards gays and African Americans. Robertson was recently interviewed for the upcoming January issue of GQ magazine. Robertson was confused by why a man would even consider relations with another man over a women.\n\n“It seems like, to me, a vagina — as a man — would be more desirable than a man’s anus,” Robertson said. “That’s just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not logical, my man. It’s just not logical.”\n\nRobertson also said that during his 67 years in Louisiana, he did not see any mistreatment of African Americans. He is quoted as saying he worked along side them hauling cotton and they were happy.\n\n“Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues,” Robertson said.\n\nI find Robertson’s remarks slightly offensive, but he is within his rights to speak freely. The network that “Duck Dynasty” is aired has the right to end their relationship with Robertson for his comments. But what I find most offensive is how the public is taking sides over something a “good ol’ country boy” said strictly because he is on the most watched show on television. The public, especially people my age (mid 20s), do not pay attention to the government when it is passing a law on gay rights, but because a pop culture star stated his thoughts on homosexuality, everyone is up in arms.\n\nFirstly, how did everyone not expect Robertson to have this view? “Duck Dynasty” ends every episode with the family sitting down for dinner and their eldest son talking about a staged life lesson he learned. Robertson’s family speaks somewhat openly about their spiritual beliefs and we are shocked that he does not support gays?\n\nSecondly, my generation is one of the least informed generations on politics and social issues, myself included. I am ashamed that we as Americans are more concerned about what a reality tv star has said than the issues behind his comments. We do not research topics that we have an opinion on, but stick to our opinions because they are “what is right.” The truly sad part about this whole situation is that in two months time, the public will have moved on to the new pop culture issue.\n\nI said this on my Facebook yesterday and I will say it again in the future, if my friends, family and the public are going to have an opinion over something they truly are not informed about, don’t. Please, crawl back under the rock you came from.\n\nLastly, I laugh at Robertson’s comment that African American’s in Louisiana were not “singing the blues,” when two states over, Mississippi is the center of the blues."
