        "text": "Ted plans a trip to Atlantic City with the gang for his birthday weekend. He wants to relive his glory days of going to the beach with his family every summer, but the trip quickly goes awry.\n\nAs they arrive, Barney gets kicked out of the casino for counting cards, and Marshall and Lily lose all their money playing craps. The group splits up to try to salvage their weekend, with Robin and Ted going on the boardwalk rides while Barney and Marshall hit up a strip club.\n\nMeanwhile, Lily is left alone in the hotel room, feeling depressed about their lack of success. She decides to try her luck at the casino and winds up winning big on the slot machines. She takes her winnings and goes to a magic show, where she meets \"The Great Mysterio\" (played by Neil Patrick Harris' real-life husband, David Burtka).\n\nThe two hit it off and spend the rest of the weekend together, much to Marshall's chagrin when he finds out. Ted and Robin also face some tension in their relationship when Ted realizes Robin may not be as into him as he thought.\n\nThe episode ends with the group heading back to New York, with everyone reflecting on their weekend and the lessons they learned.\n\nOverall, \"Atlantic City\" is a hilarious and chaotic episode that showcases the different strengths and weaknesses of each character. It also touches on the theme of luck and how it can change one's fortunes in a split second."
