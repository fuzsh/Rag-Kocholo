        "text": "Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap\n\nLily's long-lost dad shows up unannounced on Thanksgiving Day. She confides the real reason she stopped speaking to him three years ago but she and Marshall disagree on how they should deal with the dispute. Will Lily take Marshall's advice and forgive her dad?\n\nThe Magician's Code Part One\n\nLily goes into labour while Marshall is in Atlantic City with Barney, so Ted and Robin try to distract her from the painful contractions by telling her amusing stories from the group's past. As a drunken Marshall and Barney desperately try to get back home to New York, Lily becomes more panic-stricken until her father, Mickey, shows up at the hospital to comfort her.\n\nNoretta\n\nThe gang realise that their partners bear some resemblance to their parents. Meanwhile, Barney and Nora's romantic evening is ruined by a string of disasters.\n\nLast Words\n\nWhile on a trip to Minnesota, Ted and Barney try anything to make Marshall laugh. Marshall runs into an old nemesis from high school."
