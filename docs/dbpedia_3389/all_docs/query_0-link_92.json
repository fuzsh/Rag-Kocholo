        "text": "The Most Legen--Wait for It--Dary Episodes of How I Met Your Mother (part 1)\n\nAs How I Met Your Mother enters its 8th season--wait, let's stop to appreciate that for a second. How I Met Your Mother is entering its 8th season. It is now actually closer to its 200th episode than its 100th. HIMYM's popularity is an interesting story. For its first three seasons, it was an underdog sitcom; it was appreciated by a niche audience but always in danger of cancellation. But sometime during its 4th season, it suddenly became a superstar sitcom and its ratings has been high ever since.\n\nOkay now we can begin. As How I Met Your Mother enters its 8th season, I think it's appropriate to look back at the show's most memorable, surprising and, yes, legendary episodes.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 10: The Pineapple Incident\n\nThe first nine episodes of How I Met Your Mother are great and special. But it wasn't until The Pineapple Incident that the show really found its groove. It was the first time the show used its now signature time-jumping narrative style to tell the story, rather than just for flashbacks. This episode also features Drunk Ted (my favorite of Ted's personas, with Pretentious Ted as a close second) and it introduces fan favorite Trudy who would later return in another classic episode Third Wheel. This episode is pretty amazing because it unfolds like a mystery, but the most curious aspect of the mystery--the origin of the pineapple--remains unsolved.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 16: Cupcake\n\nTed and Victoria are such a great couple that it comes as a shock when you look back and realize they only had about 4 episodes in season 1 as a couple. The last of which, Cupcake, presents a very compelling relationship problem: the threat of long distance, even more distressing since their relationship is so new and vulnerable. The evolution of their thoughts about this issue is brilliantly done, especially since its coated with Robin's hilarious jealousy, Marshall and Lily talking about their own long distance troubles and Barney's own long distance relationships (yes, that's plural because it's Barney). Marshall buying a suit in the back of a pet shop? Lily sitting in a cake and destorying a wedding dress? Typical HIMYM realistic absurdity.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 18: Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.\n\nOne of HIMYM's strengths is its refusal to put the characters on a pedestal. These 5 characters are seriously flawed people (with Marshall being the closest to being the perfect guy). Nothing Good is such a sad episode, with Ted making bad nighttime decisions and screwing up his friendship with Robin. Robin herself is extremely vulnerable and doesn't even know what she's doing. Whenever their A-plot is going on, the episode is extremely well-written and performed. The B-plot with Korean Elvis hangin' with Marshall, Lily and Barney is a little weak but, well, nothing good happens after 2 A.M.\n\nOther season 1 highlights: Mary the Paralegal, Drumroll Please, The Duel, Best Prom Ever and of course the Pilot.\n\nSeason 2, Episode 4: Ted Mosby, Architect\n\nI don't know how popular or acclaimed this episode is but I just love it. HIMYM played a very risky game by putting commitment-phobe Robin in a relationship with commitment-hungry Ted. It became even riskier since, gosh, they are an excellent couple. We saw so much of Ted pursuing Robin that it's almost refreshing to see Robin go a little crazy with jealousy when she thought Ted was with another girl. And the reveal that it was Barney the whole time? Genius. Also Marshall's law school friends talking about relationships in legalese--hysterical. At the end of the day, it is nice to see Robin appreciating that Ted is a great and loyal boyfriend by bringing him donuts (filled with jelly but she's not bragging).\n\nSeason 2, Episode 9: Slap Bet\n\nSlap Bet will probably go down in history as HIMYM's best episode (or one of the best). And that is pretty accurate. Like all terrific episodes, it is very silly and absurd but grounded in very realistic themes. Here, secrets in a relationship--good or bad? Robin is keeping a secret about why she hates malls and Marshall and Barney have a slap bet about it. Both plots are full of very funny material (Lily as power hungry Slap Bet Commissioner is a highlight) And this episode contains probably my favorite line in the entire series. Ted: You're crazy--no wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong! Robin: He moved there for business!! Of course, the show throws a curveball and made Robin a teenage Canadian pop star named Robin Sparkles whose one hit \"Let's Go to the Mall\" led to a year of performing in a mall. It's all so funny and surprising--did anyone see that coming?\n\nSeason 2, Episode 17: Arrivederci, Fiero\n\nMarshall and Lily's journey into adulthood has always been one of HIMYM's strongest subplots, one that started in Season 1, Episode 5's Okay Awesome and continues through today. This landmark episode showcases the origin of Marshall's beloved Fiero and how it changed each of the gang's lives. Barney sort of learned to drive (and hates the car), Marshall and Ted became best friends in the car as did Lily and Robin. The episode is also an excellent example of how the show doesn't really need a plot--a framing device and some great flashbacks can make a great episode. Marshall says Arrivederci to his Fiero, one of the first steps into the realization that growing up is both difficult and necessary. \"But i would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 miles...\"\n\nOther season 2 highlights: Brunch, Lucky Penny, Stuff, First Time in New York, Something Blue\n\nSeason 3, Episode 3: Third Wheel\n\nTrudy's triumphant return is in the episode where Ted has a threesome. Or doesn't. Or does. Or doesn't. (I think he did.) This episode is so funny with Marshall, Lily and Barney coaching Ted on how to get a threesome without ruining it and the jokes come fast. Trudy and Rachel (played by Cougar Town's Busy Phillips before Cougar Town aired) are funny and charming so the whole setup doesn't seem too icky. Unfortunately Robin gets stuck with a lame B-plot but considering she and Ted just broke up, it seems natural that they wouldn't include her in the threesome shenanigans.\n\nSeason 3, Episode 11: The Platinum Rule\n\nSeason 3 gets a lot of flack for being rushed but it aired the year of the 2007 Writers Strike which meant it was a shortened season. This was the last episode to air before the show went on its 3 month, 1 week hiatus. And it's a perfect, classical episode of HIMYM. It puts a new spin on relationships (8 stages of relationships when you see the person every day), has immaculate editing (Barney's story, Marshall and Lily's story and Robin's story all playing out simultaneously even though happening in different years), and the writing is sharp and hysterical. This episode is a great sampling of what makes How I Met Your Mother so unique and wonderful. Great running gags, quirky supporting characters and a meaty part for Wendy the Waitress--who could ask for anything more?\n\nSeason 3, Episode 15: The Chain of Screaming\n\nAnd here we are, my favorite episode of the entire series. The episode is so funny with Ted, Lily and Robin all giving Marshall un-helpful advice about how to deal with corporate screaming. Lily's sexually frustrated since Marshall is working too much (Horny Lily is one of her best personas, along with Ghetto Lily and Drunk Lily), Ted suggests an impassioned speech and Robin uses guns. Of course, this is the one arena where Barney actually knows what he's talking about and he helps Marshall survive Corporate America. Like I said before, I've always been a fan of Marshall and Lily's journey to maturity and this episode is a great example. And the stuff with Ted's new car? It's all vintage HIMYM shenanigans and craziness. This is a good ensemble episode (though Marshall and Barney get some of the best scenes like the one in the diner).\n\nOther season 3 highlights: Miracles, Dowiesetrepla, Sandcastles in the Sand, Ten Sessions and How I Met Everyone Else\n\nSo that's it for part 1.
