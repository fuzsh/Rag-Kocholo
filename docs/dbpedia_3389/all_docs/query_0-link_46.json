        "text": "Season 4, episode 11: \"Little Minnesota\"\n\nWhen you're a dedicated fan of any sports franchise, you live for your team. Through all the highs and lows, the vicarious living through athletics can be a source of great joy... and great pain. Marshall and the other fraternal members of New York's premier Minnesota-based bar, the Walleye Saloon, throw their passion into rooting for the Minnesota Vikings who, like all sports teams, have had their fair share of wins and losses. There is one specific loss these fans cannot forget, however.\n\nA banner reading \"I'm Drinking till I forget the 1999 NFC Championship\" adorns the wall behind the bar. The Vikings lost that game after their kicker Gary Anderson, a man who had a perfect field goal record on the season, missed the uprights. It was a devastating moment for Vikings fans, and that holds true for Marshall as well.\n\nMarshall shares his adorant sports fandom with his family, and the loss is a devastating bonding moment for him, his brothers, and his father. As he struggles to survive in the big city, his connection with other Minnesota Vikings fans brings him comfort.\n\nSeason 4, episode 2: \"The Best Burger in New York\"\n\nThere is something about a great cheeseburger. It's hard to define, but you know it when you've had it, and all other burgers tend to pale in comparison. Marshall's best burger ever sends himself and his crew on a trek throughout the city to give their unemployed friend a reason to put pants on in the morning.\n\nWhile Barney, Lily, Ted, and Robin all love the new burger at their regular hangout MacLaren's Pub, Marshall judges it as \"okay\" because, \"When you've had the best burger in New York City, every other burger tastes like my grandpa's feet.\"\n\nMarshall ate the so-called \"best burger in New York\" at a hole in the wall when he first moved to the city. His journey to the restaurant helped him become comfortable in the scary streets of New York and gave him the confidence he needed to pursue a career there. Unfortunately, he forgot where the burger joint was located. His eight-year journey to once again taste the best burger ever comes to an end with the help of his friends on the same day he accepts a job working for GNB, marking another new beginning for him as a corporate lawyer.\n\nSeason 9, episode 18: \"Rally\"\n\nHaving a great nickname bestowed upon you is a milestone of growing up in modern America, and Marshall is dubbed \"Big Fudge\" for reasons unknown until Season 9, though he is referenced as \"Big Fudge\" frequently throughout the series.\n\nAs anyone finding out they'd be attending an Ivy League school would be, Marshall is pretty pumped to hear the news of his Columbia acceptance. He is so excited in fact that the lovable oaf from Minnesota downs an entire 8-pound block of fudge in 12 minutes. From being accepted to Columbia to becoming a Supreme Court justice at the end of the series, \"Big Fudge\" transforms from an eager kid to \"Fudge Supreme.\"\n\nSeason 1, episode 1: \"Pilot\"\n\nThe 2005 pilot of How I Met Your Mother introduced all the important players and their roles: Barney Stinson and his love of suits; Ted Mosby and his existential fear of never finding \"the one;\" Robin and her resilient independence; and the undeniable love and chemistry between Marshall and Lily. Five minutes into the episode, Marshall proposes to Lily after several years of being together.\n\nBeing in the very first episode of the show, it's a memorable moment for fans as the pair christens their new engagement on the kitchen floor. Adding to the sitcom hilarity, Marshall hits Lily in the eye with the cork from the celebratory bottle of champagne.\n\nSeason 4, episode 2: \"The Best Burger in New York\"\n\nAfter struggling with the dreg of unemployment while trying to become an environmental lawyer, Marshall finally gets a new job at the beginning of Season 4.\n\nThis job, however, is not what Marshall had in mind. He represents Goliath National Bank, where Barney is also employed. To him, working for GNB is giving up his dream in environmental law for a nice paycheck in the corporate world. Even though it isn't what Marshall wants to do with the rest of his life, he says, \"To be honest, it gives me a reason to put on pants in the morning.\"\n\nAnyone who has gone through the unemployment process can probably resonate with that sentiment.\n\nSeason 2, episode 17: \"Arrivederci, Fiero\"\n\nIn a fan-favorite Season 2 episode, viewers are introduced to Marshall's Pontiac Fiero. The silver hunk of metal had been with Marshall since he was a 16-year-old kid blessed with garish braces and an incredible mullet. The Fiero was the one constant in Marshall's life for over a decade and, as the episode lays out, letting go of the car proves to be a big milestone in his life. He was hoping to take it all the way to 200,000 miles, but it breaks down just before he makes it.\n\nAs it turns out, the entire crew has had memorable moments in the car, and Marshall credits the Fiero with establishing the lifelong friendship between him and Ted. By the end of the episode, Marshall has come to terms with letting go of his past and decides to make the best of what the future has in store for him."
