        "text": "How I Met Your Mother\n\nThe Magician’s Code (Parts 1 & 2)\n\nOriginal Air Date: May 14, 2012\n\nCaitlin –Staff Writer\n\ncaitlin@thetwocentscorp.com\n\nIt was about a year and a half ago when we first learned of a wedding that would involve our main characters. At that point, we didn’t even know who the groom was- though we did know Marshall and Lily were going to try to get pregnant.\n\nSoon, we learned that Barney, of all people, was the groom, and that many things- some tragic- would get in our married couple’s way. But it’s the end of season 7 now, and a baby and a bride are both waiting to meet us.\n\nPart one is all about Lily giving birth. You’ll remember that Marshall and Barney are in Atlantic City, with Marshall totally drunk. They panic over how to get home while Ted and Robin arrive, in an only slightly calmer state, to assist Lily. Between his celebratory website and her knowledge of farm animals, I’m not sure they’re going to do much, but they tell Lily stories to distract her while Barney tries to ride a motorcycle through a casino.\n\nRemarkably, he gets out of this by pointing out to security guards that there is no actual ban on motorcycles roaring past slot machines. The guards also conveniently ignore the fact he was by all accounts appearing to steal said vehicle. Ted and Robin continue to soothe a terrified Lily with a recurring tale of a magical door in MacLarens, and Barney uses his luck to secure himself and Marshall a bus ride home with a bunch of senior citizens.\n\nThere’s only one major problem with this plan- the bus is actually going to Buffalo, not New York City. Lily gets to the hospital too late to have an epidural amongst stories about banana peels, costumes, and life saving, and despairs that she’ll have to have the baby alone. But then all the wonderful senior citizens stand up and say they’re having heart attacks. The bus is redirected just in time to the right hospital.\n\nSoon, Lily and Marshall introduce the rest of the gang to their son. Marvin (after Marshall’s father) Waitforit (Take a wild guess) Eriksen is happy and healthy and is going to grow up to eventually hear one very interesting story about the day of his birth. All the happiness helps Ted and Robin finally make up for real. And the door? Everyone was faking shock at what was behind it so they could jump out at Marshall in the end.\n\nPart two initially begins right where part one leaves off. Robin slightly mars the return of her friendship with Ted by insulting him, but she makes a good point about how he dates girls he can’t have while lamenting over wanting a family. The one girl who was really right for him- “the one who got away”- was Victoria. Oh, and there’s also the little matter of how Barney was panicking through all of part one over how he ran out on Quinn. Now he’s afraid to even return to her.\n\nEventually he does, and she greets him back. He’s so happy, he ignores the fact she’s turned his apartment into a Hello Kitty playhouse, which is kind of alarming. Robin takes terrible photos of Marvin and the new parents while Ted denies his redeveloping feelings over Victoria. And then doesn’t anymore. He calls her and she wants to see him. He debates over finding out her relationship status. She helps him by arriving in a wedding dress.\n\nMeanwhile, Barney and Quinn decide to ease their troubles by going on a trip to Hawaii together. He’s supposed to be making up for going to Atlantic City, but then he gets them held up at security with the magic box in his luggage. What dangerous things lurk within that unassuming cube? He can only tell another magician. For some reason, that includes one of the TSA officers holding guns on him and Quinn. It doesn’t include Quinn herself.\n\nAt MacLarens, Victoria tells Ted that she’s kind of supposed to be at her wedding today. Instead, she suggests they run off together. Okay, it’s a typical TV trope, but they actually twist things a couple of times. First, Ted agrees to run off into the sunset. Then he remembers being left at the alter himself and changes his mind. And then he drives right past the church. I’m not sure how I feel, but I do know it’s all connecting to…\n\nSorry, not yet. While all this was happening, Barney continued to act like an idiot in front of the officers, eventually causing Quinn and himself to miss their flight. Only then does he agree to show the trick. It’s an elaborate setup including multiple things that are absolutely banned on airplanes. And it all leads to him proposing to Quinn. The two announce their engagement to their friends later that day.\n\nThere’s a bit of an awkward moment between Barney and Robin when the news is broken. And now the Ted/Victoria stuff can come back into play. Because as those two drive off into an unpredictable future, we flash forward to the wedding, where a Ted we know to be single finally does go to meet Barney’s bride, who wants a word with him. And that bride…is Robin. Pop the champagne!\n\nOkay, I will say that not everyone is as happy about the execution of these developments as I am. Some say they’re rushed, which is a valid point I’ll process more when calm down enough to watch this episode again. Some are upset by how little time we’ll spend actually seeing Barney and Robin get together again. But we’ll have at least a whole season, even if the coming one is the last. Ted and The Mother might well be much less lucky.\n\nThe major reaction, though, at least from social media sites I’ve browsed immediately after the last minute of the episode, seems to be very, very enthusiastic. And, okay, I think we were kind of supposed to know Robin was going to be the bride for ages, which did make all the misdirection a bit unnecessary. But this is what TV shows do. Personally? There’s going to be a lot to get through next season, and I can’t wait to see them do it.\n\n(On a side note, I apologize for this recap being so long, especially by this show’s standards. I debated breaking it into two parts, especially since there are kind of two separate stories, but those two stories really do flow together. And anyway, it’s going to be 3 months. That’s a lot of time to read!)\n\nFollow @Cait4TTC"
