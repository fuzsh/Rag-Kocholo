        "text": "The latest episode of \"How I Met Your Mother\" (Mon., 8 p.m. ET on CBS) was chock full of cliffhangers ahead of the upcoming Season 7 Finale.\n\nTed saw Robin's face everywhere he looked, but when he actually tried to talk to her in person she seemed to be avoiding him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Lily was sick of Marshall's annoying expecting dad habits so she packed him off to Atlantic City with Barney. However, while they were out knocking back the booze, she went into labor and Marshall had ... turned his phone off.\n\nThe two-part \"How I Met Your Mother\" Season 7 Finale airs Monday, May 14 at 8 p.m. ET on CBS."
