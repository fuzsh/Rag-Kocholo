        "text": "It's been exactly three years since Ted met Tracey, and they lived happily ever after. (This is what happened; I accept no alternatives; Tracy + Ted is the only timeline I accept; news of Tracy's death is fake news.) Yes, our beloved How I Met Your Mother aired its finale on March 31, 2014. In the time since, some of the many guest stars who appeared on the series over its 208-episode run have gone on to major success, even if their cameos were so short you don't even remember them. Here are 17 of our favorites, ranked from legen- to -dary:\n\n\"Blah Blah\" (real name Carol) is a woman Ted meets in a cooking class online, played by Abigail Spencer, star of NBC's Timeless.\n\nThroughout the first half of season nine, Lily has her drink replaced by a Farhampton bartender named Linus. Linus was played by Rob Belushi, who was once my improv teacher. Hi, Rob!\n\nJayma Mays pops up as Coat Check Girl in a 2005 episode, years before she was Ms. Pillsbury on Glee. Later, she and HIMYM's Neil Patrick Harris would costar in 2011's The Smurfs.\n\nBefore she was a Pretty Little Liar, Lucy Hale played Robin's little sister Katie; fellow Liar Ashley Benson played Carly, a young woman Ted almost sleeps with.\n\nMichael Gladis, a.k.a. Paul Kinsey on Mad Men (the one who becomes a Star Trek–loving Hare Krishna), played Chester in Trilogy Time, a.k.a. the guy who stares at Barney every night while he farts. Gladis is currently engaged to 2 Broke Girls star Beth Behrs, which isn't relevant except that once I saw them at a play together, and they seemed very happy!\n\nKate Micucci (Scrubs, Garfunkel & Oates) briefly appeared as an unhelpful but enthusiastic Atlantic City registrar in \"Atlantic City.\"\n\nLast Man on Earth's Kristen Schaal appeared on How I Met Your Mother as Laura, one half of the couple living across the hall from Marshall and Lily with whom they play charades and grow to hate and then grow to tolerate. Schaal's been in a lot of great projects, both before and after her appearance on HIMYM, but by far my favorite Schaal mini-moment is her role alongside Flo the Progressive Insurance Lady as switchboard operators in the Mad Men pilot. The Sterling Cooper switchboard ladies are never seen again!\n\nPitch Perfect's Anna Camp was Cassie, the wedding guest from Hades in \"The Lighthouse,\" a role she reportedly won after Ellie Kemper had to drop out due to scheduling issues. Camp now has a recurring role as an uptight Upper East Side mother on Kemper's Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\n\nIf Lin-Manuel Miranda isn't rapping, is he even breathing? Can the man survive without rhymes? Pre-Hamilton, LMM appeared on HIMYM as a bus passenger in the rhyming episode \"Bedtime Stories.\"\n\nCrazy Eyes, a.k.a. Chloe, was none other than Morena Baccarin, whose diverse credits include V, Firefly, Homeland, and, recently, Deadpool. But to me, she'll always be the woman who coined the name Swarley.\n\nCasey Wilson (Happy Endings) and Keegan-Michael Key (MadTV, Key & Peele) played Barney and Robin's mortal enemies in \"Something New\": Krirsten and Calvin. They are obnoxious and instantly iconic. Krirsten forever.\n\nOut of the five main cast members, three are currently married, and all three of the cast husbands have appeared on the show. Cobie Smulders' husband, Taran Killam, was Marshall's asshole coworker Gary Blauman…"
