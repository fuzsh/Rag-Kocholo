        "text": "Last night’s episode, entitled “The Bro Mitzvah,” tells the story of Barney’s bachelor party. Voiceover Ted says this is the story of how Barney’s life fell apart, and we see him six hours earlier saying, “My life is finally perfect, and that is never going to change!” Robin, worried about having dinner with Barney’s mother, asks him to drop off a $5000 catering check on the way to the restaurant. However, he’s kidnapped by Ted and Marshall for a surprise bachelor party. Barney’s happy with the kidnapping, having doubted their ability at planning a bachelor party, and he calls Robin to let her know. He also calls his mom to change plans, mentioning Robin can’t stand the idea of eating dinner alone with her…as she’s walking up to the table. Uh oh. Why on earth would he do that? The guys take Barney to a dingy suite, with Atlantic City visible in the distance. They thought it was best to keep him away from the casino, given his weakness for that crazy Chinese game, but they promise they’ll still be able to cross everything off his bachelor-party wish list. First up, they’ll “fear for their lives” by watching An Inconvenient Truth, followed by getting “mind-blowing entertainment” from a clown. Robin calls to ask why Barney’s mom thinks she’s a virgin after she dropped some not-so-subtle hints—including demonstrating how sex works using a breadstick and napkin ring…yikes. Lily arrives with the next item on Barney’s list, an appearance by the Karate Kid. Ralph Macchio walks in, but as we already know, Barney hates Ralph Macchio; Barney thinks the Karate Kid is William Zabka (Johnny of the Cobra Kai Dojo). Barney wants Ralph to leave, but Ralph wants to stay for a night sure to be “in…wait for it…credible.” The gang pointing out the similarities between Barney and Ralph only makes him more upset with how his night is going. Finally, the stripper arrives.\n\nIt’s Quinn. AHH! Quinn’s upset Barney’s marrying Robin, and Barney’s upset that the guys didn’t vet the stripper beforehand. Quinn decides she’ll strip for everyone but Barney, and we hear loud cheering on the other side of the door as we see Barney locked in the bathroom. Robin calls to tell Barney about her hellish night: after she told Loretta that her “napkin has seen plenty of breadsticks and one baguette—I dated a center for the Knicks,” Loretta really opened up about her own history. Now, she’s “holding up a napkin ring and three breadsticks talking about her night with Crosby, Stills, and Nash.” We hear Loretta asking for another breadstick, and Robin adds “and Young.” Yeesh. Barney promises he’ll be there soon. Barney calls the night off and everyone piles in the car to head back to the city. Ralph mocks Barney for having a bachelor party near Atlantic City and not even gambling, which makes Barney remember the $5000 he’s carrying and demand they turn around. At the casino, Barney loses the whole $5000, and Ralph calls him a loser. Dick. Barney vows to make the night legendary, gets credit, and…promptly loses an additional $80,000. Lily, who’s been flirty with Ralph Macchio up to this point, mentions that she had everything “waxed on, then waxed off” that day at the salon; when he mentions her husband being there, she realizes Marshall is missing. Barney tells her he used Marshall as collateral for the loan, making everyone upset. Back at his apartment, his friends storm off, and Robin confronts him about abandoning her. Quinn hops out and asks to be paid for the night, which obviously freaks Robin out; Ralph’s promise that “just hand stuff” happened does little to calm her. Robin throws her ring at Barney, telling him it’s over; realizing she never did that, Quinn picks up the ring and throws it at him too.\n\nAs she rounds the corner, Robin calls and tells Ted, “We’re right on schedule.” Oooo, what is she up to? Robin and Quinn celebrate how upset Barney is. Voiceover Ted says that Barney’s repeated lamenting that they’d disappoint him, combined with Marshall’s wonder how they’d “make something memorable for a guy who makes every nigh the best night of his life,” gave them an idea. Robin suggested they give him the worst night of his life. I love this twist, a play they dub “The Barney.” They gave him the worst hotel room and entertainment, the wrong Karate Kid, and the last stripper on earth he’d want to see. Quinn was happy to pretend her life was awful just to mess with Barney, and they knew Ralph mocking him would drive him to gamble. The Chinese mob boss was also in on it, rigging the game; Robin even figured he’d use Marshall or Ted as collateral, and Marshall was pleased it was him. Robin would also let him think she had a horrible night with Loretta, when she was actually in on it too. Marshall thought the coup de grâce should be him getting his hand chopped off, which weirded everyone out. Seeing Barney on the stoop from the Chinese mobsters’ car, a fake-scared Marshall begs Barney to pay; one of the men says it’s too late and cuts off an obviously fake hand. Two mobsters then drag a terrified, almost-crying Barney to his apartment…where everyone is waiting for him.\n\nBarney can’t figure out why they’d put him through this, but Robin says they gave him everything on his list without him realizing it—in the most twisted way possible. Barney thinks it’s awesome. Ralph hits on Lily, who says her moves were all part of the act; they shake hands, but as he walks away, she licks her hand. Haha. The group toasts, and Barney notes that he didn’t get everything on his list—“No offense to Ralph Macchio, but he ain’t the Karate Kid.” The clown says he couldn’t agree more and begins taking off the clown nose and makeup. He says Robin left him 18 voicemails about how Barney was one of the few who recognized who the “real” Karate Kid was. He rips off the clown costume to reveal his Cobra Kai uniform as Barney delightedly yells, “William Zabka!” Aww. This really was the perfect, most memorable bachelor party Barney could have had. Now, there are only two episodes left this season—“Something Old” and “Something New,” where we’ll meet the mother!!! Ahhhh! The anticipation is killing me!"
