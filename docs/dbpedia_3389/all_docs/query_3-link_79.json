        "text": "June 2, 2023\n\n3.5 stars\n\nFor the first half of this memoir I leaned toward three stars. I liked a lot of the content though I found it difficult to immerse myself in the writing style. Jane Wong has published poetry predominantly, and I think that’s evident in how she writes this book. There’s not really a concrete or linear flow of events, and at times I wasn’t sure what certain sentences meant (e.g., “What does it take to want myself? I stare deeper. I slurp noodle after noodle, ravenous. The noodles bounce back against my teeth, deliciously resistant to the bite.” … so… how does this relate to wanting yourself? Also how are the noodles resistant to your bite??)\n\nHowever, Wong seems like such a lovely and thoughtful person that I found myself still enjoying her life stories by the end of the book. I liked reading about her honoring her anger as an Asian American woman, her experience growing up working-class, how she found her way with writing in predominantly white literary spaces, her deep connection with her friends, and her wholesome relationship with her mom and her complex relationship with her dad. Even how she wrote about her students, I could tell she’s a caring person who’s invested in both creating and supporting Asian American literature. Thus, even though the writing style of Meet Me Tonight in Atlantic City isn’t my favorite, I believe that Wong bared her soul both honestly and powerfully in its pages.\n\nFebruary 9, 2023\n\nI am biased. Author is my sister from another mister BUT I have excellent taste in books and lifelong friends. I’ve been lucky enough to get to read this pre-publication and I’m so excited for it to be in the world soon.\n\nMay 13, 2023\n\nThis was a beautiful and poetic memoir. It took a little bit for the writing style to fully sweep me away but once I was able to join the flow it was hard to put this book down. I loved how raw and honest the author was. It felt like a privilege to get to read this. I will admit parts of this made me uncomfortable as the author bared her trauma and the racist behavior she has experienced again and again. It was clear to me from the first page that this author is truly a poet and it makes me very interested in reading some of her poetry. Overall I gave this one 4.5 stars rounded up because I can tell that this book will be sticking with me.\n\nOctober 13, 2023\n\nThis is a poetic and vulnerable memoir that explores the author's life growing up as a low-income, working-class Chinese-American immigrant child. She wrote the book as a love story to her mother and an exploration of the American dream's struggles and resilience. The author recollects her father's gambling addiction and its consequences on their complex family dynamics. Her story is deeply rooted in the emotional impact of estrangement, familial trauma, and the domino effect of her father's absence. Despite the challenging experiences, she finds empathy and understanding for her father. She explores her relationships, including her struggles with a string of unsatisfying relationships, which she bravely connects to her father's absence and the societal stereotype of \"daddy issues.\"\n\nExpertly moving back and forth in time, the author gives readers a multidimensional view of her family. She also highlights the allure of Atlantic City, lyrically intertwining its history with her own narrative, shedding light on the city's rise and fall and its effect on her family. Gripping and raw, and sometimes even funny, Meet Me Tonight in Atlantic City masterfully conveys the author's emotional experiences.\n\nTo listen to my interview with the author, go to my podcast at:\n\nhttps://shows.acast.com/moms-dont-hav...\n\nMarch 10, 2023\n\nI received an ARC from the publisher as part of a Goodreads giveaway.\n\nThe writing style of this memoir threw me off at first because I didn't know anything about the author and therefore did not expect so much metaphor and poetic language, but once I got used to the writing style I ended up really enjoying this book.\n\nJane Wong constructs a non-linear narrative of her life, jumping between her childhood in Atlantic City, her college days, and her current life in Seattle. There is much focus placed on how Wong being a Chinese American woman with immigrant parents has impacted the way she is viewed and treated by others, as well as what kind of expectations and ideas she has in regards to herself.\n\nThere are a lot of unique relationships discussed throughout the memoir but by far my favorite was the one between the author and her mother. You can really feel the love between the pages when Wong writes out the many conversations and experiences the two of them have shared together. The final moment of them eating mangoes together was a perfect way to close out the tale.\n\nMemoirs are not something I read often, but for what it's worth I couldn't get enough of this one.\n\nP.S. \"The Auditor\" is my new favorite thing.\n\nFebruary 21, 2023\n\ni feel so, so lucky to have been able to read this book pre-publication via ARC. allow me to speak candidly: Holy Fuck!\n\ni felt so many things as i read— love, rage, tenderness, curiosity, mystification, tenderness, love (and much more). gratitude, gratitude, gratitude that this book, this person, exists. (and her mom, too. special shoutout to her.)\n\nthis book is vulnerable and ferocious. from the heart of a poet. it’s magic.\n\nmy copy is tagged up and down into neon oblivion.\n\nJane Wong, Motherfuckers!!!!\n\nRead Read Read!!!!\n\nMay 20, 2023\n\nMEET ME TONIGHT IN ATLANTIC CITY is utterly alive; it’s a bleeding, beating heart; a vulnerable offering. I emerged from its pages with my hair coated in joss paper smoke and smelling of steamed fish, feeling as if I left some part of me within even as Wong gave raw aching parts of her to me, feeling as touched as Wong does when sitting across an imaginary table of other Wongs, as “generations of Asian American women [nourish] each other across time, space, and so much unnecessary loneliness.” I am nourished.\n\nIt’s hard to put a finger on what type of memoir this is. A memoir by a poet, yes—the prose is lush, vibrant, delectable. Anxiety as clumping rice noodles with no cold rinse, time as mosquito bite scars fading, desire as a packed flower, and tomatoes—a mother’s laugh like a tomato bursting, and hugs ripe as one about to burst. A memoir that squishes memoir boundaries like the boundaries don’t exist, yes—paragraphs erupt into poems erupt nonlinearity. Here is Wong as a child, then as an adult, then as a child again. A memoir: “Isn’t this how it really is? Returning to the wisdom of a younger self?”\n\nBut at its heart of hearts, MEET ME TONIGHT IN ATLANTIC CITY is writing about love, into love. Wong worries away at this: that the publishing industry and the readers push marginalized writers to produce “[i]mmigrant gold, intergenerational trauma dessert.” How to write on heartbreak, on chosen silence without giving up your worth? “What happens when your archive is a ghost?” So she fills it in the gaps left by silence, by pain, by absence with beautiful imaginings: ghosts, first and foremost, of parents’ past (ancestral villages, people she thinks they were, people they’d never be); she fills them in with the kept bloodline of a fish, hauntings she invites us not to fear but to embrace. She finds poems in loved ones, in ceramic pots, in love and not just heartbreak—and when there is heartbreak, she reclaims what is hers, mouths her name, falls in love with it all over it, or calls her mother to be reminded of it. She is unbelievably tender with her father, creating a revenge list but leaving his name out of it, “pray[ing] that he is still there, still alive, still able to blink and wonder from time to time, Where is my daughter, where is the girl.”\n\nWong has given us this gift of her heart. And yes, I winced at the terrible library pick up lines. And yes, I circled this: “I’m fucking done explaining.” 💕\n\n[Thanks to the publisher for the gifted copy--also to the author for sending me a handmade ceramic dumpling which literally made my day omg]\n\nOctober 1, 2023\n\nThis was very beautiful - the writing is *chef’s kiss* - just gorgeous language that has you re-reading lines to really savor what’s being said. Wong’s portrait of her mother is a warm hug in language, and the loving way she describes her family in general is really moving. Also, as a fellow Jersey kid, I really appreciate the “Jerseyness” sprinkled throughout (the comment about wanting to play “Born to Run” when Bruce showed up at a local gym made me snort).\n\nAlso, not related to the writing itself but the hermit crab cover art? Perfect.\n\nJune 8, 2023\n\nPoignant. Heartbreaking. A beautiful life so undeserving of the pain endured. Definitely wishing Jane nothing but warmth and happiness. Thankful to her to share such personal stories.\n\nFebruary 28, 2024\n\nA deeply personal and vulnerable memoir, \"Meet Me Tonight in Atlantic City\" is poet Jane Wong's look back on her life, a meditation on moments and memories from childhood to her present growing up in Atlantic City in a Chinese-American family.\n\nThe memoir doesn't follow the typical chronological pattern, instead pulling together similar themes and topics across its chapters. Across these passages, we piece together key points of Wong's life - growing up with gambling addicted, frequently absent father; her fierce love and admiration for her mother (and her friend's invention of WongMom.Com); being in an abusive relationship; the simultaneous fetishization and demoralization of Asian women; and the omnipresence of food as a source of both nourishment and love. She interweaves a number of historical and contemporary pieces of literature as reference throughout, as well as various media sources to help highlight her points, and her musings on the recent pandemic make it even easier to connect to her messages.\n\nI have not read any of Wong's earlier work before this book, but it's clear from her prose and writing that she is a poet. The choice of wording, the way the sentences and syllables are structured and flow - it is beautifully lyrical and makes so many passages memorable and emotional. There are so many moments in her past (and present) that she lays bare, moments of shame and weakness that most of us would likely wish to forget, that it feels less like a memoir and more a conversation with a close friend. I have to commend her for sharing so much of herself with us as, in her shoes, I'm sure I'd be nothing short of terrified to do so. Her story and voice, however, are a welcome addition to the AAPI community of authors and writers, and I can only hope that she will continue writing for many years.\n\nMay 8, 2023\n\nIn the 1980s on the Jersey Shore, the Wong family is part of a new generation of immigrants trying to stake their claim for the American Dream, even as this dream crumbles. Beneath the promises Atlantic City holds lie her father's gambling addiction, ultimately leading to losing the family restaurant.\n\nMEET ME is a beautifully written memoir/essay that blends Wong's story of growing up as a restaurant baby in New Jersey, finding her way through a fractured family with an absent father, and reflections on the disappearing men in her life.\n\nMEET ME isn't chronologically ordered due to the mixture of personal stories and essays, but that didn't affect my reading experience at all. In fact, I relish the experimental writing style that focuses on different topics in each chapter. Wong covers the predatory nature of the gambling industry targeting Asians, the economic & cultural barriers for immigrants seeking healthcare, dating problematic white men, cultural appropriation of Asian food by white chefs to \"elevate\" ethnic foods, breaking into a majority white space as an Asian American woman, and so much more.\n\nI particularly love Wong's relationship with her mom, whom she calls \"wongmom.com,\" like a website that gives you helpful life advice with humor & honesty. Wong's writing on their conversations made me miss my mom so much, even when sometimes mom's responses are so brutally honest 🤣\n\nMEET ME is an introspective and poignant memoir that had me gasping, crying, aching, and laughing. It'll make an incredible & unique Mother's Day gift for those looking for one!\n\nThank you to Tin House for the gifted ARC\n\nAugust 7, 2023\n\nJane Wong’s endearing and enjoyable Jersey Shore / writer coming of age memoir. I came across this and for a moment thought my spouse had written it, given how similar their backgrounds are. This is a sensitive and rich portrayal of the author’s inner life, her insecurities and victories, her experiences as an Asian American woman and a poet, all the dubious exes. You can’t help but root for her. Mangoes forever!\n\nShelved as 'not-finished'\n\nApril 9, 2023\n\nThe nonlinear format of this book really threw me. Although I don't typically mind that format, it only works for me if I have a strong foundation and connection to the characters and the setting. I was expecting the writing to be lyrical and poetic, but it came across to me as more abrasive and trying too hard.\n\nDNF @ 3%.\n\nThanks to NetGalley and Tin House for the ARC.\n\nMay 22, 2023\n\nMEET ME TONIGHT IN ATLANTIC CITY is a memoir about Jane Wong, growing up as a restaurant baby in New Jersey with an absent father.\n\nWith a non-linear narrative, Wong shows vulnerability from page 1. As she paddles through love and pushes through fears, the majority is about relationships - dating (problematic) white boyfriends; haunted by the abandonment; dealing with racism and erasure.\n\nFrom visits to illegal dentists to Chinese beauty standards (whiteness) to cultural appropriation, this memoir is both a dense and quirky human adventure. The poetic prose highlights how much Wong thinks about her life through poetry, delivering the most sincere reactions. The author examines Postal service and gambling industry targeting Asian Americans (specifically Chinese Americans), offering so much food for thought. I loved getting a glimpse of the author's creative writing process and dive into poetry.\n\nAt the beginning of each chapter, there's a short section with black border and a photo, in which Wong has intimate talks with 'wongmom.com' as if chatting with her mother, while 'wongmom.com' offers life advices. My favorite part was Wong's relationship with her mother and brother, and those moments made me yearn for my own.\n\nThis memoir felt like loose episodes, in essays format and it gave a creative and fast-paced touch to the book.\n\nMEET ME TONIGHT IN ATLANTIC CITY is provocative in its own way and provides profound reflections. Humorous, beautiful and brutally honest.\n\n[ I received a complimentary copy from the publisher - Tin House . All opinions are my own ]\n\nApril 17, 2023\n\n*NOTE: This was an Advanced Readers Copy. I want to thank both Goodreads and the Author for giving me the opportunity to win and read this Memoir.*\n\nThis was a pleasure to read. Jane Wong's talent really came through in this Memoir, every sentence beautiful and poetic, down to the simplest details. I respect all she went through in life and how she got through it all. I laughed, smiled and felt the same cringe she did while reading her experiences in life. I also learned a bit about poetry and appreciated the deeper meaning involved.\n\nRead\n\nMay 24, 2023\n\nI left off of this very quickly due to the writing style. Dramatic overuse of abstract simile, and written in such a way that I can't hear it in anything other than the husky voice of the action movie preview guy (\"One man.... one mission.... He will stop at nothing to save his city... but is he too broken?\" ..huge bass drop, then surprise explosion). But for all that, then it's just like, about this girl's life growing up.\n\nMay 14, 2023\n\nI was interested in the author’s family history and stories. I just couldn’t get past the writing style. It was choppy, disjointed, and jumped around.\n\nI got lost numerous times and has to keep circling back to figure out where I was.\n\nThanks to WW Norton and Edelweiss for the digital copy.\n\nNovember 23, 2023\n\nI heard the author speak earlier this month at the Portland Book Festival and I was intrigued almost immediately as she started speaking about her book. Such a beautiful memoir. Jane’s mom is such a gem and I admire her for working at the postal service for almost 30 years!! Thank you Jane’s mom!\n\nJuly 10, 2023\n\nI had a hard time staying with this one. It was a struggle to finish\n\nSeptember 30, 2023\n\nI enjoyed this a lot and I resonated with so much that the author shares in this. But the book felt a little all over the place and repetitive at times (probably intentional, but I wasn't a fan).\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\nSO good. Really powerful. Her way with words is truly next level. I feel like anything I write here will not capture how well written and thought provoking this memoir is. Expressive, different, insightful, vulnerable, everything.\n\nIt did take me a couple of chapters to adjust to the author’s writing style, but once I caught on, the writing style really enhanced the impact that the memoir had on me.\n\nJune 12, 2024\n\nJane Wong, I will read any and everything you write.\n\nI knew this was going to be a favorite early on. The poetic prose of this memoir felt like bobbing in the waves of the Atlantic Ocean at the Jersey Shore. A high I will be chasing for quite some time.\n\nJune 2, 2024\n\nI loooved this book! So creatively written and in so many parts felt like she was speaking directly to me!\n\nMay 16, 2023\n\nThe truth is: I’m terrible at being Chinese, I don’t have strict parents, and I’m just okay at Ping-Pong.\n\nAn incredibly charming memoir about growing up in a Chinese restaurant in New Jersey, family, relationships, and poetry.\n\nTruly a delightful piece of non-fiction that will make you salivate for dragonfruit, wontons, mangoes, and hoisin sauce smothered ribs. The relationship between Wong and her mother was so refreshing and beautiful. The sections about her brother made me cry and miss my own little brother.\n\nAnd I learned so much--about Mao's famine, about what it's like to date men as an Asian American woman, and about the post office system.\n\nOut today! Further thoughts coming soon.\n\nThank you Tin House for accepting my request for an early copy in exchange for a review.\n\nAugust 3, 2023\n\nThis seemed to be a collection of random thoughts, many of which center on Wong's many failed relationships. I struggled unsuccessfully to find the common thread to pull this collection together.\n\nJune 4, 2023\n\n[Copy provided by publisher]\n\nREAD IF YOU LIKE...\n\n• Beautifully composed essays\n\n• Exploring the experience of growing up Asian American in America\n\n• Strong mother and daughter relationships\n\nI THOUGHT IT WAS...\n\nA metaphorically rich memoir that reads like a series of poetic essays. Wong dives into the different facets of who she is through poignantly themed essays. She fixates on the strong white teeth of white people as a symbol of wealth and privilege while describing a childhood where her parents constantly struggled with money. She breaks down the story behind her name while also using it as a framework to recount the racism she experiences because of it. And she richly describes the atmosphere of Atlantic City as an exploration into the struggle many Asian immigrants have with gambling, her own father included.\n\nOverall, I loved Wong's writing. Wong is a poet and it pleasantly shows. She has such a strong command of language and uses it in unique, powerful ways. Much of what she shares resonated with me. I really felt like I was watching her climb firmly into herself as the book progressed, better understanding her anxieties, her fears, her insecurities, and her strengths.\n\nI do feel that the book starts strong but slowly loses its tight composition as it progresses. Additionally, many of the chapters of the book were previously published as standalone essays and sometimes it shows. There are sentiments that start to feel slightly repetitive. I can understand the need for the context within a standalone essay, but not when it's already been established as part of a larger book. However, these are nitpicky critiques. This is a strong, well-written memoir worthy of a read.\n\nJuly 30, 2023\n\nI would have liked more if the title used more intense editing to achieve less verbosity. Or did I expect it unfairly more due to the author being a poet?

The writing wasn’t terrible, it honestly just was not what I expected for a writing style or memoir. I struggled to understand the direction this memoir was going, unfortunately it felt too random and disorganized at points. I appreciated her thoughtfulness and vulnerability and sharing her story though!"
