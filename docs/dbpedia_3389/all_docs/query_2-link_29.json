come.\n\nHave a lot of time with professionals to get it finished will help encourage them.\n\n>> Wind out some ways for students to fill out their federal financial aid forms.\n\n>> It's amazing to think that our community is small in its challenges.\n\nWe are that said so much music to come out of our area.\n\nThis impacted the entire world.\n\n>> And the musical great to song lyrics put Western Kentucky on the map now taking center stage in Central City.\n\n>> Production of Kentucky Edition is made possible in part by the KET Millennium Fund.\n\n♪ ♪ >> Good evening and welcome to Kentucky EDITION for this Monday.\n\nAugust, the 5th time in a shawl coming to you from downtown Louisville.\n\nThanks so very much for joining us.\n\nWe're here at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville for the 50th anniversary and the National Conference of State Legislatures or and C S L for short for the last 5 decades in Csl is brought together legislators and their staff from around the country and abroad.\n\nEven thousands of people are here roaming the halls over the coming days to learn about artificial intelligence, child care, housing, education, and more.\n\nLast night I spoke with the public affairs director of in Csl M*** Bullock, who helps organize the summit as well as some political leaders from Kentucky.\n\nRepublican Senate President Robert Stivers and House Speaker David Osborne to discuss the economic impact of this conference and what they're hoping to take away from it.\n\nFor those of us are still who are like a viewers like still what is NCSL?\n\nOh, my God.\n\nThat's a little primer and explain what is it?\n\nWhat is in to sell?\n\nNot.\n\n>> You truthfully speaking in Csl is a professional organization for legislate to wars and legislative staff were bipartisan.\n\nSo are nonpartisan.\n\nHave you want to label it >> we represent the more than 7300 state legislators out there and the more than 37,000 legislative staffer, the only association that that does that just like you're probably again, a member of the Kentucky, Kentucky but Press Association.\n\nThink of us in that sense where we are their professional organization.\n\nIf you're a legislator or legislative staffer we provide ample amounts of research, professional development.\n\nAnd of course, what we're doing here at the legislative summit is just another great example of one member benefits that are provided there yet.\n\nWell, first of all, we're so glad that Louisville was celeb.\n\n>> Absolutely right.\n\nAnd that is very have in the Senate.\n\nPresident and House Speaker told us about that of the pitch that they made, of course, to make that happen.\n\nBut talk about overall the economic impact to this city because of the number of rooms and all of these things and maybe having to buy some clothes that the that the luggage didn't quite still a thing.\n\nBut I will say this about Louisville.\n\nWe were here back in 20 and we really listening to what our members have to say when they're filling out that questionnaire of like.\n\n>> Why did you enjoy the summit?\n\nYou know what made you enjoy the summit and overwhelmingly the attendees when we were here back in 2010 said we loved the environment.\n\nWe loved the food.\n\nWe loved the people.\n\nWe love the policy.\n\nOf course that has been covered at the summit.\n\nSo we fast forward a couple years and Louisville was just a no-brainer.\n\nI mean, you have a beautiful facility here.\n\nThe convention center, a fantastic job in really bringing us up to speed in here within csl because it is such a large for this year, we have over 5300 attendees coming in from all across the country and not just the country but international as well.\n\nSo when you break it down, there's about 20 cities that that could actually host and csl legislative summit.\n\nNow, this is all on top of all we have we have over 10,000 hotel room nights that are booked in the Louisville area.\n\nIn fact, some of our spillover runs right now are at the airport because there are still people are still trying to find the room.\n\nAnd then on top of that, the economic impact of bringing ncso here.\n\n4.8 million dollars.\n\nYour hopes for what you hope to learn from the conference.\n\nAnd we know that you just had the slc conference last week along with Alex.\n\n>> What sets in Cs all apart?\n\n>> and it does 2 things.\n\nIt really focuses on legislative seminars that that you can come in and pick up, say what are they doing in Maryland?\n\nWell, Maryland has a billion-dollar shortfall in their budget.\n\nSo you might want to do what Maryland's 2.\n\nBut, you know, you also hear some good economic development stories.\n\nWe have different seminars all around here.\n\nBut the other function because in Csl is currently on Legislature's is the staff.\n\nThey do a huge staff components.\n\nSo when you see us reading the rules, a lot of these have been developed by the 50 states over 50 years about how you proceed and how you have a default document.\n\nMason's manual, which is not Robert's rules of order.\n\nAnything else that was developed by the NCSL over years to say you develop your own rules with the default document being Mason's manual.\n\nSo our staff trains and it's really important and that interconnect between staff and legislators and in between the states.\n\n>> There's a lot of attention on artificial intelligence.\n\nAnd we've heard that from several that we've talked to a cybersecurity, of course, education, the staple types issues.\n\nBut we know artificial Representative Josh Bright has been a part of this conversation.\n\nI think he's probably part of one of those sessions on that currently is and actually the the opening session tomorrow will be focused on a a >> relative new how we manage what we don't even know at this point in time.\n\nBut yes, we Robert Nigh appointed a task force to work through the interim to deal with that being led by Josh Prey on our side and it is a it's a huge issue.\n\nBut to follow up on what Robert said, you know, ES S L C and Alec, they both have.\n\nThey're both great conferences.\n\nThey both bring a lot of a distinct properties to them in Cso is different in the fact that it brings people from.\n\nPolitical from every corner of the And a lot of the international will be here the drizzle, a delegation from Taiwan.\n\nThere's one from one from Canada.\n\nSo it really does briem perspectives that we don't get to see often and developing those relationships developing those contacts.\n\nIt really a huge benefit as we we're through problems that we deal with every day.\n\nYeah.\n\n>> We'll talk more about in Cs all on a special edition of Kentucky tonight.\n\nThat happens tonight at 8 Eastern 7 central right here on KET.\n\nAs all of our Kentucky Edition deadline today, Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee for president, had not yet named her running mate.\n\nIt is expected to be announced by tomorrow.\n\nThe Associated Press as Harris met with 3 finalist yesterday.\n\nThey are Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro,

Libertarian Party did.\n\nThey sent their party's candidate chase Oliver to address the crowd at Fancy Farm.\n\nIn a twist of tradition this year, Fancy Farm invited speakers on either side of the aisle to stump for and against constitutional amendment.\n\nNumber 2, which will be on the ballot in November.\n\nIf passed, the amendment would allow the legislature to direct public money to private
