        "text": "The gang throw Barney the worst bachelor party ever to give Barney the worst night of his life while fulfilling everything on his list for the perfect bachelor party just not in the way he intended.\n\nAt last an episode that advances at least part of the story. Barney’s bachelor party is a major part in us getting closer to finding out who the mother is. His bachelor party means we very close to Barney and Robin’s wedding where as we know Ted meets the mother. This episode has got me excited now as we enter the final couple of episodes of the season.\n\n“The Bro Mitzvah” takes us to Barney’s bachelor party where the gang give Barney the worst night of his life. First they book a hotl room just outside Atlantic City which Barney hates because he wants to spend it in Atlantic City. Then they book a clown for Brney’s required ‘mind-blowing entertainment’. They book the ‘wrong’ karate kid as a special guest as Barney wanted the Karate Kid to be at his bachelor party. The stripper they book turns out to be Quinn (Barney’s ex-fiance) much to Barney’s dismay. They return home where Quinn asks Barney to pay her fee in front of Robin who then dumps him. Barney is left crying in the street as he thinks his whole life has fallen apart. All this makes for interesting reactions from Barney.\n\nIn the conclusion to the episode it is revealed that it was the gangs plan all along to make it seem like Barney’s life was destroyed by checking off all the items on his perfect bachelor party list in the worst way possible. When this is revealed Barney is delighted as they gave him the night he wanted even though it wasn’t in the way he expected.\n\nOverall this was a very enjoyable episode and it seems like they are back on track for the final episodes of the season."
