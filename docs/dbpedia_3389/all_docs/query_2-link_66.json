        "text": "Barney Stinson​\n\n​\n\nSorry but this had to be done, now lets get started.\n\nBarnabus \"Barney\" Stinson is a fictional character created by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas for the CBS television series How I Met Your Mother, portrayed by Neil Patrick Harris. The character has been extremely well received by critics and has been credited for much of the show's success. He is considered the show's breakout character.\n\nRole on How I Met Your Mother\n\nBarney Stinson is one of five main characters on the CBS television series How I Met Your Mother. In contrast to his best friend, Ted Mosby, who wants to settle down, Stinson is a serial womanizer, and has a plethora of strategies and rules designed to meet women, sleep with them, and discard them.Through several seasons of the show, four of the main characters were couples, as Ted began dating Robin Scherbatsky and Ted's roommate Marshall Eriksen became engaged (and later married) to Lily Aldrin. This left Stinson the only single character, and, according to Harris, Stinson was \"resentful\" that the other characters had paired up. Later on he dated Robin in season 5.\n\nHarris was invited to audition for the character by Megan Branman, the casting director for the show. He assumed that he was invited solely because the two were friends and did not believe he had a chance of winning the role. Harris later said that \"Since I (considered) myself the long shot, I didn't care that much, and I think that allowed a freedom. His audition centered on a scene of laser tag, and Harris executed a dive roll, accidentally knocking over a chair and slamming into a wall. CBS executives enjoyed his performance, and Harris was quickly offered the part.\n\nBarney Stinson is named after, although has no resemblance to, a character in James Ellroy's 1990 novel LA Confidential.\n\nCharacter\n\nHarris describes Barney as a man who \"likes to create crazy situations and then sit back and watch it all go down.\" In the show, Barney is a confident womanizer in his early thirties who almost always wears a suit, likes women with Daddy issues and is always willing to offer his (sometimes hypocritical) opinion. He tends to be opportunistic and manipulative, and will attempt to manipulate a situation so that it goes his way; in the episode \"Shelter Island\", for example, Barney successfully attempts to get Robin (in whom he was exhibiting romantic interest) to come to Ted's and Stella's wedding, even though it was not in the couple's best interests to do so. He is also highly competitive, and will take on \"challenges\" to complete (sometimes) outlandish tasks in order to prove his worth. He is proud and stubborn, and attempts to stand by his word no matter what; in \"I Heart NJ\", for example, he refuses to put down his fist unless someone offers him a fist bump. By the end of the episode, he has said fist elevated and in a sling after struggling to keep his fist up throughout the episode.\n\nAlthough The Early Show described him as \"utterly devoid of morality\", Barney lives by the \"Bro Code\", his own code of rules. Despite his overall questionable character, according to creator Craig Thomas, Barney is \"a pretty fragile character who's really afraid of being alone. He just wants people to like him, to be important to people, and to have disciples who follow his word.\"\n\nBarney, just like Harris, is an illusionist. His favorite type of magic tricks include fire, which his friends seem to hate (as seen in the tenth episode of the second season, \"Single Stamina\" and in the fourth episode of the fourth season, \" Intervention\"). Barney uses them mostly to pick up women. His most common method of picking up women, is telling them elaborate (and completely false) stories about himself; he often goes under an alias.\n\nBarney is also seen to have a gambling problem that he occasionally gets under control, only to relapse as seen in several episodes such as \"Atlantic City\" (where he has Chinese Triads gambling friends) and \"Monday Night Football\". Furthermore, he is something of a metrosexual; he enjoys manicures, and has an extensive knowledge of designer labels and gourmet food.\n\nAs far as talent goes, Barney has exhibited eloquence, wit and creativity numerous times throughout the series. He is very well-connected, the most affluent of the group and speaks at least one language other than English, using what is said to be Ukrainian (but is Russian in fact) with his tailor, Mandarin and Korean at least twice in business deals with shady North Koreans. He apparently also has above-average video-editing skills; he created and edited his entire video resume all by himself. Also, he seems to be a talented website designer, as shown in \"The Playbook.\" As shown on more than one occasion, he is proficient at playing the piano, as are Ted and Marshall. He seems to have a thorough understanding of human behavior and uses this mainly to manipulate situations to his advantage (mostly to pick up women). Several episodes also showcase many of Barney's crazier abilities, such as his physical ability to complete the New York City marathon without a single day of training (though his legs went numb while he took the subway moments later), being able to punch through walls, stay under water for up to 12 minutes and being knowledgeable enough to guess the exact price of prizes on The Price Is Right. He also juggles knives in \"Doppelgangers\". Despite his eclectic and prodigious talents, Barney is lacking in several common skills, such as driving a car but he seems to have learned as he tries to prove that he can get out of a ticket or using a screwdriver.\n\nAs revealed in \"Zoo or False,\" Barney was born 7 years after first manned landing on the Moon, thus making 1976 his year of birth. His phone number is seen in season five, episode 15.\n\nAlthough coming across as a very strong character with a penchant to committing daring and wild feats, Barney has an extreme fear of spiders as shown in the season 2 episode \"First Time in New York\".\n\nBarney has held an iPhone since the first 2G model, and in the later episodes of the 6th season it is seen, that he has the iPhone 4.\n\nHe has the habit of eating ice cream when he's upset although this is common among all the main cast.\n\nRecently, Barney finally met his father (John Lithgow), who felt forced to act in the same ultraconfident, womanizing manner as Barney in order to impress him, and also because Barney seemingly refused to see him any other way. Barney eventually broke down and accused his father of walking out on him. His father, who could offer no excuse, apologized and pleaded with Barney to allow him to be a part of his life, which Barney was open to, but apparently not ready for yet.\n\nCareer\n\nBarney's occupation has not been fully specified, though the company he works for (Altrucell)[9] was said to be the world's largest producer of the yellow fuzzy stuff on tennis balls (but future Ted implies that the company's main profits come from other, less innocuous sources, such as logging, oil drilling, small arms, tobacco farming and missile construction). In the season 3 episode \"The Bracket,\" it was mentioned that he is good enough at lying to avoid perjury charges. As of Season 4, his company was involved in a hostile takeover with Goliath National Bank (GNB), but he remains a powerful executive and continues to use the same office he has had since it was first shown in Season 1. Despite this, he has suggested there is the possibility he will one day wash up on shore with no teeth or fingerprints and supposedly has come under attack by ninjas in the past during work. In Season 4, during the episode \"Happily Ever After\", Barney states to a woman that he is an \"Attorney in Law\", though this was probably just part of a pick-up line as he immediately followed it with \"Let's talk about getting you off\". His video resume was published in Season 4 episode \"The Possimpible\".\n\nIn the Season 4 episode \"Woooo!,\" the leader of the Swedish architecture firm SVEN reveals Barney to be the head of the search committee. It is likely that the \"search committee\" was simply a project team to manage to the project of designing a new GNB building, and that \"head of the search committee\" is not his primary occupation. Whatever his profession, Barney is apparently quite wealthy and is undeniably the richest out of the five. He lives in an upscale apartment and is rich enough to own two 300 inch televisions shipped from Japan as well as expensive memorabilia, including Clone trooper and Imperial Stormtrooper costumes from the Star Wars films. He frequently buys expensive items, such as a last-minute plane ticket to San Francisco, thousands of dollars in postage stamps, or two televisions specifically for smashing in frustration, on the spur of the moment. Barney is also shown to be a fan of the rock groups AC/DC and Bon Jovi.\n\nA fourth-season episode has Barney celebrating sleeping with his 200th woman, a fact even his friends find disgusting. Barney finally explains his conquests by relating that back in seventh grade, a classmate named Matthew Panning claimed to have slept with 100 girls and Barney bet that he would double that number one day. He calls Panning and presents the list, to which an incredulous Panning says he was lying at the time and Barney has based his whole adult life \"around something I lied about when I was 12.\" Barney displays disbelief in Panning's revelation and after Panning leaves, he asks himself what his driving motivation should now be. He then sees Robin waving at him from the bar, and then smiles to himself.\n\nThe season 4 final episode \"The Leap\" has Barney finally confront Robin about his feelings. Robin attempts to \"Mosby\" Barney, only to have Lily tell Barney that Robin had deliberately done that to drive him away. Barney and Robin confront each other in a hospital room where Barney finally tells Robin he loves her.\n\nThe two continued to date awkwardly, not wanting to give specific names to their relationship. Eventually though, the two embraced their dating life - even considering themselves the best couple (between them and Marshall and Lily). The relationship began to bring out the worst in each other. Barney took on poor eating habits and Robin stopped taking care of herself because of her frustration with Barney. The two eventually decided to break up and resume their friendship.\n\nEpisode \"Twin Beds\" sees Barney reconsidering his relationship with Robin, because Don is now dating Robin and has asked her to move in with him. In spite of Ted, Barney decides he wants Robin back and manages to convince Ted that he does too. The episode ends with neither Barney or Ted managing to get anywhere with Robin who has decided to be with Don and to effectively cut them both out of her life. Barney is still resolved to \"get\" Robin and she returns in the following episode, \"Robots Versus Wrestlers.\"\n\nThe episode \"Doppelgangers\" has Barney masquerading as a cab driver to further his goal of sleeping with a lady from every country. A task in which he has not yet succeded and later becomes the object of Lily's fixation with finding a Barney doppleganger. While Barney masquerades as both a cab driver and an Estonian knife juggler, Barney's doppleganger is not seen in this episode. The episode \"Bad News\" finally revealed Barney's doppleganger, a fertility doctor that Marshall and Lily see.\n\nIn 2008, the book The Bro Code, ostensibly written by Barney, was published.\n\nIn 2010, Barney was featured in a Super Bowl commercial that showed him in the stands at the Super Bowl with a sign stating \"Hey Ladies Call Barney Stinson 1-877-987-6401. A call to the number results in a recorded message inviting you to meet him at McLaren's Pub on Monday, October 12, 2016, even though that date falls on a Wednesday. The scene was worked into the show itself a day later.\n\nBarney has met Ted's kids before, as shown in the episode \"Miracles,\" because Ted refers to Barney as Uncle Barney."
