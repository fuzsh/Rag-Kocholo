        "text": "Congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you’re getting married? What the hell?\n\nMarshall and Lily decide to elope in Atlantic City but find out it’s not that simple.\n\nEveryone- Now that Marshall and Lily are back together, the subject of marriage gets brought up and Marshall makes Lily propose to him this time. They’re ecstatic until they realize that means they have to stand in front of everyone. Everyone who they had to tell that the previous wedding was off. Lily says she wishes they could run off to Atlantic City and get married and they run down and get Robin and Ted from work. They find Barney getting a pedicure, so they all get pedicures and head out.\n\nOnce there, Lily realizes she needs a veil, a bouquet, and Robin looks better than her so she needs to change. Robin leaves to find different clothes while Lily heads off to find a bouquet and Marshall and Ted go to gamble. Barney shows up with a veil and proposes a bachelor party and they end up going to a strip club. They all meet up at the wedding chapel, and Robin shows up in one of those big shirts that makes her look like she’s a babe in a bikini. But then they find out it takes three days to get a wedding license in New Jersey. So they head to the courthouse to see if they can get the waiting period waived. There they find out that only a judge can waive the waiting period, so they camp out until one walks by. They plead their case and he’s ready to give them what they want because of how long they’ve been together, until he notices a look that passes between them and Barney spills that they broke up over the summer. Back at the casino Lily comes up with the idea that they can find a ship captain and get married in international waters. Robin pulls Lily aside and asks her why it’s so important that they elope and Lily says otherwise they’ll have a huge wedding full of Marshall’s family, judging her. The guys find a ship captain who says he can marry them for $5,000.\n\nBarney says he can get the money and explain that the Chinese guys who have been coming up to him all day are his old gambling buddies and he used to play a Chinese game all the time. Barney starts playing and Future Ted explains he’s never seen a game so complicated, and he still has no idea how it’s played. The game involves chips, tiles, dice, a wheel, and finding the jellybean. Marshall finally understands the game and coaches Barney in tripling his money.\n\nThey go out on the boat and as the ceremony starts, they realize they want the big wedding. And they call of their second wedding to start planning their third.\n\nThe Mother- I love the little moments in this episode. Robin leaving work in the middle of a broadcast and wearing the bikini shirt, Barney in the casino, the woman at the desk in the wedding chapel. But mostly i love the scene with Barney playing the game and it being completely confusing."
