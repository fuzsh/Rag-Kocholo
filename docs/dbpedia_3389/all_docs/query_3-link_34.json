        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. Season 1, Episode 3: \"Sweet Taste of Liberty\" Who participates in the following dialogue? A: \"I'm so glad we finally get to hang out--just the two of us.\" B: \"Yeah.\" A: \"Are you sure you're okay giving up your Friday night to hang with an old, almost married lady?\" B: \"Oh, please. I'm so sick of the meat market scene. Guys are like the subway. You miss one; another one comes along in five minutes.\" A: \"Unless it's the end of the night, then, you get on anything.\"\n\nAnswer: Lily (A), Robin (B)\n\nLily and Robin discuss how complicated it is to find a guy to date. Robin makes such remarks and ends up having to hang out with Lily, who is engaged at that time to Marshall.\n\n2. Season 5, Episode 24: \"Doppelgangers\" Lily, Robin, and Marshall jokingly compel Ted not to dye his hair blonde. However, Ted insists he do so. How does Marshall ultimately react, still jokingly?\n\nAnswer: \"That is not the outcome that we're hoping for!\"\n\nTed's plan to dye his hair blonde is a reference to Barney's original hair that he has to conceal in his motives to pick up foreign chicks from the United Nations headquarters in a cab he disguises to drive. Knowing that the taxi cab driver is actually Barney and not Barney's doppelganger, Marshall feels disappointed since he has a deal with his wife Lily that they would start a family only at the time that they find that doppelganger.\n\n3. Season 2, Episode 8: \"Atlantic City\" Who says the following line? \"There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana!\"\n\nAnswer: Ted Mosby\n\nWhile the ensemble is carrying the hopes for the marriage (by elopement) of Marshall and Lily in a casino at Atlantic City, New Jersey, they, except Barney (who is busy with playing Keno), complain about the process that had to be delayed due to lack of some requirements. Ted uses the thought of \"people get[ting] married at Atlantic City all the time\" to technically define that Lily and Marshall are allowed a quickened marriage; the registrar replies that it is not because of elopement that a number of couple get married but of the scenic destinations surrounding the city. Thus, Ted has to report a corpse of an orca whale severed in half that may be haunting the tourists at the city's shores.\n\n4. Season 4, Episode 14: \"The Possimpible\" Lily: \"Dancer's hip! Marshall has something called \"dancer's hip\"!\" Marshall: \"It's a basketball injury; they only call it because it's common among ballet dancers. (Pauses) Oh, no.\" What is the Latin or Latin-like term for Marshall's \"dancer's hip\" syndrome?\n\nAnswer: Iliopsoas tendinitis\n\nMarshall is made fun of the rest by the gang because the alternative term for to his injury, called \"iliopsoas tendinitis\", which was obtained actually from his acts of dancing secretly in his office every time he knows of news in his firm that is worth a privilege, which he confides to his wife, Lily. He \"dance[s] more than [she] know[s]\".\n\n5. Season 6, Episode 1: \"Big Days\" Barney Stinson quoted \"Ted, you are spitting on the grave of Sir Walter Dibs, inventor of the \"dib\"! It was ____. The S.S. Dibs was lost at sea--\" (Ted cuts his statement short, annoyed.) On what year, according to Barney (as he claims it as true account), did the coinage of the term \"dibs\" occur?\n\nAnswer: 1652\n\nTed and Barney argue on planning a date with a random girl at McLaren's, after the latter literally calls \"dibs\" on the girl. Ted still has intent to date her even though his claim of an \"implied dibs\" seems weaker.\n\n6. Season 3, Episode 14: \"The Bracket\" Barney conducts a forum to determine the girl causing frequent sabotage against him, using a tournament-style knockout scheme. He refers to the battle between Kate and Jannett in the Midtown Region final round. A: \"'Evil Twin'!\" B: \"'Prince of Norway'! How could it not be 'Prince of Norway?!\" C: \"Barney, you're the tie-breaker.\" Barney: (thinks) \"I'm going with 'Evil Twin'.\" Just to test your memory, who all did not score points for this round?\n\nAnswer: Ted and Lily\n\nWinning the round, Kate becomes one among those being assessed as Barney's four most potential saboteurs. She is the one who attacked him upon answering the door of her apartment. \"LARNEY!\"\n\n7. Season 8, Episode 1: \"Farhampton\" Barney Stinson speaks in a rapid pace: \"...Then, [Ted] finally kissed [Victoria]; they started dating. Ted kissed Robin, lost Victoria; Ted did a rain dance, got Robin. Ted and Robin broke up; Robin moved to Brazil; came back with a Latin stud...\" The explicit flaw in this dialogue is that Robin did not travel to Brazil and end up back home with her new Hispanic fianc√©e, Gael. Where did she actually move to?\n\nAnswer: Argentina\n\nWhen Quinn Garvey learns that Barney had a previous relationship before starting one with her, she forces him to explain everything about it before leaving him after one minute. Barney complains at first for eight seconds about the impossibility to do so, yet Quinn, in her reminder that these eight seconds have elapsed, pushes it through. \"Fifty-two seconds!\"\n\n8. Season 7, Episode 4: \"The Stinson Missile Crisis\" \"Okay, Survivors! Today's Reward Challenge is brought to you by Dr. Barney Stinson's Free Breast Reduction Consultations.\" Jeff Probst actually appears in this episode as himself as the host of \"Survivor\" and his only line is used to sponsor \"Dr.\" Barney Stinson's services. On what edition of \"Survivor\" (USA) is this spoken, as feature in a television screen?\n\nAnswer: Survivor: South Pacific\n\nThis advertisement is Barney's so-called Bimbo Delivery Systems, that he adopts to attract women for his sexual pleasure. Lily still worries about him doing so since having news of him maintaining his relationship with Nora.\n\n9. Season 4, Episode 18: \"Old King Clancy\" In a flashback scene, Marshall steps up on the platform for his open-microphone stand-up act, about which Barney and Ted lie that he stole the show nicely, but actually \"killed... everyone's Thursday night.\" In his act, Marshall goes through on a list of the names of fish, which he claims to be comical to hear. What fish does he not mention?\n\nAnswer: Mackerel\n\nMarshall reprises this fish joke when he asks Ted for time in preparing the charts for his presentation at the Goliath National Bank. In addition, this is a reference to how Marshall and Barney lie to Ted as his friends about his project being scrapped for months, although it receives lauding remarks in a meeting including the \"Task Force\".\n\n10. Season 6, Episode 4: \"Subway Wars\" In a separate scene in reference to why Barney needs a win an action-packed foot race around Manhattan, which of the following situations does he tell or imply to the rest of the gang besides that he \"smell[s] incredible\"?\n\nAnswer: Half of his department got fired at work, resulting a twofold increase in his salary.\n\nBarney also tells about his sex encounter with a girl from Boston and his experiences of getting \"muscular\" despite little workout. It is these experiences that make Future Ted think that he \"did not need a win\". At least, \"he did smell incredible.\"\n\nSource: Author lacourzan95\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor guitargoddess before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
