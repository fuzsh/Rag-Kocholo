        "text": "Mrs. Donald Trump is a working mother. Really. Four days a week, she boards the big black helicopter her husband bought last year for $2 million, the one he poses in front of for magazine stories, the one with white lettering across the door that reads: IVANA. She carries a bulging Vuitton briefcase; her secretary carries another. She thinks and talks numbers like a platinum-blond computer. The numbers are money, and the money is big. This is not some fluff job her husband whipped up to give his restless wife something to do. Ivana is C.E.O. of Trump’s Castle, one of the three casinos Trump now owns in Atlantic City. In the seaside town that spawned Monopoly, the Castle is easily a “green”—Pacific, say, or North Carolina. Last year, it showed an after-tax profit of $35 million.\n\nOf course, Ivana Trump is also a woman whose husband is worth, by his own claim, $3 billion. She has three children to raise. She has three homes to oversee: the family triplex in Trump Tower, the estate in Greenwich, the 110-room Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. On top of this, she does charity work. Why worry about running a casino?\n\nOne answer is that the Trumps have always kept their businesses private, and remained a family fiefdom wherever they could. But there’s more to it than that.\n\nFrom her early days as a championship skier on the Czech Olympic team, Ivana has been intensely competitive. She is, in fact, every bit as driven and disciplined as her husband, though more privately so. Now, at a time when Donald Trump’s mastery of hype has pushed his image even higher—with a just-released autobiography, an ongoing battle to build Television City on New York’s West Side, and political speechmaking that fans talk, however farfetched, of a presidential run—Ivana has pushed harder too, determined to prove she’s her husband’s equal. “Donald calls me his twin as a woman,” Ivana says, “except in one sense: I’m not a promoter—I can’t talk my way around things the way a promoter does. I’m straightforward.”\n\nOn a bright weekday morning, Ivana Trump, thirty-eight, is perched on one of the Trump chopper’s buttery-leather seats. She wears a trim-fitting powder-blue Galanos dress that sets off her figure. Up front, two pilots man the elaborate controls. The East Side of Manhattan falls away, and the chopper veers toward the desiccated Jersey shore. Ivana makes this trip too often to notice the view anymore. Besides, she’s talking casino numbers.\n\n“To break even, you have to make $600,000 a day,” she says. “And you can make a million-dollar-a-day mistake.”\n\nShe speaks intensely, in a sort of driving monotone, her still-strong accent lacing her speech. When she refers to someone, she puts “the” in front of his name, so that her husband becomes, a bit disconcertingly, “the Donald,” or just “the Don.” When she says “million-dollar-a-day mistake,” she touches wood—the polished teak, as it happens, of the arm of her seat. Outside, the propellers are roaring; inside, they make barely a hum.\n\n“We have nearly four thousand employees. A payroll of $1.2 million a week. Ten thousand people come every day to the Castle. We serve 13,000 covers—food and drink. It’s like running a small city,” she adds. “You have to know about housekeeping, laundry, entertainment, show girls, orchestra, casino lounges, the health club. Plus hotel marketing, casino marketing . . .”\n\nProudly, Ivana pulls from her briefcase a Xeroxed sheet of last week’s earnings at the Castle. “You see—this week, $16 million was bet by customers. Of that, we took in 13 percent, for a win of $2.1 million. And that was just on the tables. The slot machines, meanwhile, earned $2.8 million. So the total weekly earnings were nearly $5 million.”\n\nThere are those who dismiss Ivana as a nouveau riche, as new as a roll of fresh-minted quarters in a bettor’s sweaty hand. There are those who find her design taste tacky—who shudder at the interior of New York’s Trump Tower, much less the fashion sense of platinum-blond hair and a powder-blue dress. And there are those who find the casino business tawdry, and blanch at the very idea of a woman up to her elbows in it, spouting weekly returns on dollar slot machines.\n\nBut they miss the point. Surrounded as she is by the trappings and corruption of extraordinary money, and enmeshed as she now is in a business equated with sleazeballs and organized crime, Ivana Trump has somehow remained a woman of old-world East European values and sensibility. She shows up at the Paris couture collections with her father, a Czech architect, and mother in tow. She sends her castoffs to relatives in Czechoslovakia. Two of her best friends are Czech women she’s known since her earliest days in New York. She’s not, as one observer puts it, one of the “ladies’ ladies,” blessed with either pedigree or a bitchy wit. But she doesn’t try to be. She doesn’t put on airs; she’s as straightforward as she says she is. Put it this way: compared with Leona Helmsley, Ivana Trump is a beacon of virtue in the dark and stormy night.\n\nBelow us now is Atlantic City, its boardwalk casinos a dreary gray row above the low, flat-roofed houses and storefronts behind them.\n\nThe helicopter lands without a tremor, and Ivana steps out like Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, from her bubble. Instead of munchkins there are strongmen to greet her, bulky in their pin-striped suits. She is whisked into a waiting limousine, and when the doors shut, there is silence again—the silence money buys from a noisesome world.\n\nThe long car winds through a neighborhood of shabby cinder-block houses and corner bodegas. The sidewalks are empty. Urban blight in Atlantic City remains such a problem that some critics have proposed moving the entire residential population to an outlying area. “Yes, the casinos do help the city,” says Ivana in answer to my question. “For one thing, they provide employment. Also, the casinos pay a redevelopment tax.”\n\nApparently, the state has had more success in keeping the casinos clean of corruption. In the ten years since gambling sprang up here, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission has imposed strict guidelines, and no one has ever suggested that the Trumps’ casinos are tainted by organized crime. Still, it seems incredible that Ivana Trump has not had to deal with questionable characters in her two and a half years as C.E.O. of Trump’s Castle. “Never,” she says. “Which isn’t to say there might not be some characters around. But if you’re in a restaurant and a mobster is sitting at another table, how do you know it? Anyway, Atlantic City is investigated so much, it must be cleaner than New York.”\n\nTrue as that may be, Trump’s Castle has been rocked just the week of our conversation by the news that one of Ivana’s top executives has been indicted for taking bribes. “Bucky” Howard, the vice president of casino operations, is said to have accepted $300,000 in payoffs from tour operators carting busloads of bettors down from Chinatown. Howard is now on a leave of absence, and Ivana, who likes to tout the “incredible energy and enthusiasm” of her staff, is in the middle of a management crisis.\n\n“I believe the man is innocent,” says Ivana, who thought highly enough of Bucky to name one of the Castle’s restaurants after him. The guilty one, she thinks, is an executive turned informer from another casino who’s lied about Bucky to help get himself off the hook. “Until Bucky’s proven guilty, we’re going to fight for him.” If she is wrong, she admits, “I’m going to be the most disappointed person in the world, because it will mean my judgment was bad.”\n\nUnlike most of Atlantic City’s casinos, Trump’s Castle is not on the boardwalk. It’s on the inland marina, a dull tan brick building with a fake rainbow that looks a lot like New York’s Penn Station with kitsch. A long escalator leads up to the burgundy-carpeted main floor, known as the atrium. Chrome columns topped by cakelike castles set the design tone. Colorful banners protrude from the mezzanine of restaurants on either side, fluttering in the controlled air. Above arcs the massive, high-domed skylight that has the morning’s first arrivals gawking.\n\nIvana pauses to point out the gaming room to one side: a den of colorful neon, cavernous and windowless and, at this early hour, deserted. One flight down, double glass doors open into a long suite of carpeted offices that could easily be those of a bank or an insurance company.\n\n“Hi, Bob. Morning, Nancy.” Ivana waves with cheery authority as she passes each open door. If she radiated any more enthusiasm, she’d start to skip. In her own spacious office she spies a pile of checks awaiting her signature; except for payroll checks, she approves and signs off on every expenditure the casino makes. “She is running that establishment,” emphasizes Frances Freedman, publisher of Atlantic Citymagazine. “She reads all of the slips and all of the figures.”\n\nIvana has worked hard—one might almost say ferociously—to prove herself to a ruthless industry that viewed her as a neophyte when she took on this job. In fact, she’d had a two-year apprenticeship: she’d helped her husband reorganize Trump’s Plaza when he became disgusted with Holiday Inn, his public-company partner, bought it out, and took his first casino private. The Castle came about by a fluke. In April 1985, Barron Hilton ran afoul of the Casino Control Commission and, two months before the scheduled opening of his new casino hotel, failed to get a gaming license. Trump bought the whole works for $320 million, made a few cosmetic changes, rechristened it Trump’s Castle, and put Ivana in charge. In its first full year, the Castle ranked third among its ten rivals, an astounding feat. In the first quarter of 1987, it ranked number one in gross operating profits.\n\nThat’s when the going got tough.\n\nMore rivals have come to the boardwalk, but the market isn’t growing. As Ivana likes to put it, “The cheesecake isn’t getting any bigger, so the slices are getting smaller. And only the fittest will survive.” Six months ago, Trump himself bought troubled Resorts International, gaining not only a third operating casino—the maximum allowed for any owner in Atlantic City—but Resorts’ unfinished Taj Mahal casino, a white elephant whose construction budget had grown from $200 million to $800 million and counting. Trump has said he’ll reduce Resorts to plain hotel status when the Taj is completed; even so, the Taj’s huge gaming space—twice that of any other casino—seems sure to drain business from its rivals, including Trump’s Plaza and Castle.\n\nWith the heightened competition, other problems have grown thornier—problems Atlantic City labors under that Vegas and Reno do not. The high cost of real estate. The high cost of construction, driven even higher on the boardwalk by the need for seaside pilings. Unions. The real problem, though, is distance. Vegas and Reno are remote enough that bettors go for at least a weekend, and often for four or five days. Atlantic City, as the Trumps’ casino consultant, Al Glasgow, puts it, is a “six-hour town.” Close to major cities, unappealing to linger in, it draws more daytrippers than overnighters, and that changes the mix of what are referred to as high rollers, middle rollers, and low rollers.\n\nThis is the most fascinating part of the casino business—and the greatest juggling trick for a casino chieftain like Ivana Trump.\n\nTo make the highest profit, most casinos seek a mix of high rollers, who aren’t plentiful but spend plenty, and low rollers, the schmoes who come in on the buses and spend fifty dollars or less on the slot machines. High rollers have to be seduced. Free meals and hotel suites are par for the course; so are special concerts by celebrities. The question is how much you “fade” them, how much credit you extend.\n\nLow rollers, of course, don’t get hotel suites and concerts. But as competition stiffens, casinos are vying for the “bus people” with special promotions: free transportation, fifteen dollars’ worth of free betting chips, perhaps, or an all-you-can-eat seafood buffet. The risk is that at a certain point a casino starts paying more than it gets in return, just to keep the traffic coming. “I would always like to be known as a middle-to-high house, not middle-to-the-low,” Ivana Trump says from behind her big burled-walnut desk when the checks have been signed. And she doesn’t want to overpromote the low rollers. “There are people who can come in free on the bus every day, get fifteen dollars to gamble with, and not gamble at all, but just live on this. It’s better than an unemployment check!”\n\nTo lure high rollers, the Trumps are now doing what they do best. Behind the Castle, ground has been broken for a $70 million wing—a ballroom for the conventions and prizefights that bring in big money, and a hundred luxury suites for the Money to sleep in. Out front, the marina is being revamped for another $16 million to provide slips for six hundred yachts. With her new suites and spiffy marina, Ivana says proudly, “there is nothing really anyone will be able to do to catch up.”\n\nI’m about to ask Ivana exactly how much independence she has in making even day-to-day decisions about these multimillion-dollar projects when the phone rings. “Hi, Donald,” she says brightly. “I’m talking to Michael.”\n\nMichael?\n\nAfter a moment, she hands over the phone. “The Donald wants to speak to you,” she says.\n\n“How’s she doing?” comes the smooth voice of Donald Trump over the line.\n\n“Oh, fine,” I say. “She’s, um, had a great coach.” No, that sounds condescending. “Actually,” I amend, “she probably hasn’t needed any coaching.”\n\n“I’m proud of her, I really am.”\n\nWe talk a moment more, and then I try to close with: “Well, I’m certainly planning to play the slot machines before I go.”\n\n“Do yourself a favor,” says the owner of Trump’s Castle with disarming candor. “Don’t bother.”\n\nHow much power does Ivana wield? And what sort of relationship do the Trumps really have? The clues lie back in the deal that first put Donald Trump on the map in New York: the glitzy Grand Hyatt Hotel.\n\nTrump had just started pursuing that deal, in the winter of 1976, when he met Ivana in Montreal at an Olympic reception. He was twenty-nine years old, and beginning to take on Manhattan. He’d talked his way into the prestigious Le Club and begun meeting the rich young Europeans and South Americans who would one day buy apartments in Trump Tower. More important, he had persuaded the bankrupt Penn Central Corp. to grant him, for a nominal fee, options on its riverfront yards in the West Thirties, Fifties, and Sixties. But the self-professed fast talker from Queens was starting to wonder if his brash bid on the yards would come to anything at all—and if he might not soon be back in Queens, collecting rents from his father’s tenants. Then he heard that Penn Central might be willing to sell off its ailing Commodore Hotel, next to Grand Central, for a fire-sale price.\n\nIvana was by now a top model, having immigrated to Canada soon after the 1972 Olympics. She was blonde and beautiful, and she may have borne certain similarities to Donald’s mother. “My mother loved splendor and magnificence,” Trump writes in his autobiography, “while my father, who was very down-to-earth, got excited only by competence and efficiency.” But, like his mother, Ivana was also a “rock,” a stalwart exemplar of old-world values.\n\nWithin nine months, she and Donald were married and living in New York. Ivana was working toward an interior designer’s license. The Commodore Hotel was passing into Donald’s hands. Ivana says all the business decisions were Donald’s, and Donald’s alone. Perhaps, though it’s hard to imagine that a bright young new wife wouldn’t offer counsel to her husband at this turning point in his life. What’s certain is that Ivana played a full-time role when construction on the Grand Hyatt began. New license in hand, she spent ten hours a day at the site, riding herd on plumbers and electricians, painters and Sheetrockers, passing judgment, as she says, “over every pillow, every table and chair, and every brass column.” Donald puts it somewhat offhandedly in his autobiography: “I would send over one of my executives, or more often my wife, just to see how things were going.”\n\nDonald’s new wife had turned out to be a tough-minded business partner. From there on in, Trump would consult with her in detail on every construction project. Ivana became an executive vice president of the growing Trump Organization, in charge of interior design on all Trump projects. If anyone had failed to notice her touch with the Grand Hyatt, she made her presence blindingly clear in the pink marble and gleaming brass of Trump Tower. Some critics found her taste gaudy; others, including the *New York Times’*s Paul Goldberger, found it all rather pleasant and giddily refreshing.\n\nIn Ivana Trump’s now rarefied world, there loomed one obvious rival: Leona Helmsley. Both women had come from modest means to marry real-estate moguls. Both were visible in nouveau riche social circles. And Leona, of course, was at the start of her self-proclaimed reign as the “queen” of her husband’s Palace Hotel. One close observer says Ivana’s jealousy of Leona was a strong motivation for her projects. And Donald has been quoted of late as saying he feels “sorry” for Helmsley in light of the damning revelations about the Helmsleys’ alleged tax-evasion scams and Leona’s perceived role as a Dragon Lady dominating a tired old man. “I don’t know how Leona runs her business,” says Ivana. “I only know what I read. And I know that I don’t fire people on the spot, and I don’t shout at the people who work for me. I run my business with dignity, and I’m a lady.”\n\nNo one would suggest that Ivana has ever tried to dominate her husband. (“The Donald,” says Ivana firmly, “is the boss.”) But she is no Stepford Wife, either. Five years ago, when Trump plunged into gaming, he went in as a partner with Holiday Inn, which then owned two Harrah’s casinos. According to Trump, Holiday Inn proceeded to make one management gaffe after another. Consultant Al Glasgow recalls walking out of a tense meeting between the Trumps and Harrah’s. “Tell me, Al,” said Ivana, her eyes snapping, “how many casinos can one family own?” “Three,” Al told her. “Well, then,” Ivana declared, “we’ll own three.”\n\nGlasgow, whose relationship with the Trumps has been both close and occasionally stormy, says Donald handles casino construction projects but Ivana makes certain major policy decisions and nearly all day-to-day decisions at the Castle. “This business of signing every vendor’s check—no other head of a casino does that,” Glasgow observes. “As soon as I suggested it, she latched right onto it.\n\n“It’s funny—you get the feeling not only that she has to prove something to Donald but that Donald has to prove something to her,” Glasgow adds. “She’s part of his drive, too.” In what way? Glasgow, a confirmed member of the old school, cracks up. “The same power that rules kings and countries—and you can quote me on that.”\n\nOne night each week, sometimes two, Ivana Trump stays in Atlantic City. She works till about nine P.M., takes a quick dinner in one of the restaurants (“to check up on the service”), then brings more papers up to her hotel room. She says she never gets lonely or bored—the legacy, perhaps, of growing up an only child. Does she miss her husband? “Oh yes,” she says, then flashes a girlish smile. “But when I see him after a day, it’s better.”\n\nThis evening Ivana and her husband are due in New York at Ann Getty’s for dinner. Normally, she’d work until at least six, but a bad storm is threatening. At four, she charges out of her office, bulging briefcase in hand. Hundreds of bettors are milling around the main floor—old or middle-aged, gray-skinned, flabby. Low rollers, every one. From the gaming room comes the clinking of coins in a thousand slot machines, the yanking of levers, the whoosh of cherries and lemons spinning, and the bells that signal “Sorry this time!” Above the many mechanical sounds the voices of dealers can be heard, but the shuffling crowd is mute. Among them, like fireflies, pass the scantily clad cocktail waitresses, their red velvet attire designed by Ivana Trump. A few startled bettors recognize her as she passes. Curiously, they make no attempt to greet her. Untouched and unapproached, she glides by.\n\nThis is the reality of the gaming business: a money machine that is at best mindless, expensive entertainment, at worst a vacuum that sucks up the savings of dreamers who can’t afford to spend. Does Ivana ever think about the losers? “No one’s pressing the people to come,” she protests. “Some people spend money on drugs, some on alcohol, and some spend it on gambling.” Does she ever gamble herself? “I can’t—it wouldn’t be allowed,” she says. But then, “No, it’s not in my character. I’d rather buy a pair of shoes.”\n\nIn the limousine, we move on to happier subjects. How does she feel about all this talk of Donald running for president? And is her own ultimate goal to be First Lady? “It’s not for the next ten years, definitely not,” Ivana replies quite seriously. “There is so much to do. We have invested in this town close to a billion dollars. We can’t just put it in escrow and go to the White House. It would go down the drain in a second. It’s too young, too new. But in ten years Donald is going to be just fifty-one years old—a young man. What he’s done in the last ten years some corporations don’t do in a hundred years. Donald is interested in politics at a certain level. But I don’t think he would run for mayor—he could do that so easily. That wouldn’t be a challenge for him.”\n\nIvana may also feel that the White House would provide a better showcase for her own talents than Gracie Mansion. Imagine a First Lady who could redecorate it more professionally than any of her predecessors. (And who’s to say the Oval Office wouldn’t look better in pink marble with a waterfall along one wall?) Ivana’s European perspective wouldn’t hurt, either: she speaks fluent German, French, Czech, and . . . Russian. With her casino savvy, she’d be a perfect consultant on the economy. And for the all-important task of overseeing White House social affairs and the service staff, what better experience could one have than overseeing not one but three palatial residences?\n\nThat Ivana manages this last as an afterthought is, in truth, every bit as impressive as her Castle-keeping. Each Trump house has a supervisor in charge of its staff, but Ivana makes every important decision, holding daily phone conferences with her man in Greenwich during the summer months, her Palm Beach man in winter. Mar-a-Lago is by far the bigger job. The Trumps begin going down weekends in January; two months before, Ivana gives her New York secretaries guest lists for every weekend of the season.\n\nUsually, four or five couples are invited. They share a quiet Friday-night dinner with the family; Saturday night they’re joined by Palm Beachers for a black-tie banquet at the long marble table that seats thirty-six. Ivana sparkles in one of the beaded outfits that have become her trademark. (Says designer Arnold Scaasi, “It’s interesting that Ivana’s taste has gotten showier over the last couple of years. More and more, she uses the same Atlantic City designers who outfit the show girls and entertainers.”)\n\nA mariachi band plays at cocktail hour as guests munch Swedish meatballs (Donald’s favorite hors d’oeuvre) and cheese puffs. Then comes the five-course repast with sorbets in between. Into the Venetian-blue crystal glasses goes 1983 Volnay les Caillerets or 1984 Puligny-Montrachet; onto the Capo di Monte china and gold serving plates go filet mignon, duchesse potatoes, and artichokes stuffed with parsnip purée. Roederer Cristal champagne is de rigueur for the inevitable toasts, and then guests float out to the old Marjorie Merriweather Post dancing pavilion, where one of Peter Duchin’s twelve-piece orchestras strikes up the tunes. Recent guests have included Beverly Sills, Jerry Zipkin, Merv Adelson and Barbara Walters, Lee Iacocca, Frank Sinatra, Milton Petrie, William and Pat Buckley, Alfred and Judy Taubman, Lord and Lady Charles Spencer-Churchill. A roll call, in short, of Names.\n\nWith the constant round of entertaining, there isn’t much time for anything else—reading, for example. “Books, I tell you . . . it’s difficult. You come home and your mind is still going, and you put on the television to calm down, and you talk to the Don, and maybe take a magazine to bed, but you’re really tired, it’s 11:30, 12—you’re gone.” So books, says Ivana, are for summer weekends in Greenwich, when the pace at last slows down. “And gardening. I absolutely adore gardening. I go up to the Greenwich, I put the gloves on, and I dig. And I have everything up there—if I do something, I do it big. The garden, it’s from here to China.”\n\nThe Trumps’ three children would seem fated to spend their waking hours with a parade of nannies and maids, but Ivana says not—“I am a good mother”—and launches into an earnest and rather winning rundown of her weekly schedule, how she’s planned to spend either a morning or evening each day with her children. Evenings at home, she has dinner with them even if she’s going out later. Not only is it a time to catch up, but “at these political or charity evenings, you don’t get dinner until eleven o’clock! By then everyone’s starving—but not me.”\n\nBoth she and Donald, says Ivana, teach the children traditional values. Donald junior, at ten, gets a five-dollar weekly allowance; Ivanka, aged six, gets one dollar; four-year-old Eric gets nothing at all. “They have to know the value of money,” says their mother, “otherwise they’ll get spoiled, like those Khashoggi children. And another thing: you have to give the children things to do, let them find out what they like and don’t like. Donald loved his sailing lessons last summer, and he said, ‘Mom, I would love to get a sailing boat.’ ” Ivana, whose husband has just bought for $31 million the Khashoggis’ monster yacht as “an ultimate toy,” told her little Donald firmly, “It’s too early—you don’t know if you’re going to like it, and if you do decide you like it later on, you’re going to have to work for it.” (About the yacht, she admits, “It’s really sick to buy it just for yourself, isn’t it? It’s a little garish for my tastes. But it’s got twenty magnificent suites for high rollers. We’ll keep it at the marina for them.”)\n\nFriends are harder to fit into the schedule. Ivana knows many of New York’s more visible social ladies—not only from dinners but from the charity work she’s done, particularly for United Cerebral Palsy of New York City—but most are acquaintances, not friends. “I have some,” she says reflectively in the helicopter back to New York, “but it’s hard to find time.”\n\nOnce a year, Ivana has a girls-only weekend down in Mar-a-Lago, from which even Donald is banned. “We sit in the spa, walk on the beach and talk.” One frequent guest is Aja Zanoya, a former world-champion figure skater; another is Olga Reindlova, who works in the realestate department of Sotheby’s. Czechs both, they speak their native tongue with Ivana as much as they do English. Mai Hallingby, whose husband, Paul, is one of Donald’s bankers, went down last year, too. “Ivana had made up a schedule for each of us, and we all worked like Swiss watches. Then on Saturday night she had in a band after dinner, and all the women danced. It was wonderful fun.”\n\nBut more and more now, her girlfriends point out sympathetically, Ivana seems under a strain too considerable even for a former Olympian. Both the Castle and Mar-a-Lago were annexed to the Trump kingdom at about the same time, and Ivana has simply worked ever harder these last two years to keep up. “I do think it’s going to become overwhelming,” says Hallingby. “She keeps trying to go faster and faster, and she doesn’t have time to stand back and see how fast the pace is getting.” Ruler that she is of all she surveys, Ivana may soon have to learn that she can’t do everything by herself.\n\nAs the helicopter approaches the Manhattan skyline, the storm that hurried Ivana back is clearly visible to the west, a nasty darkness growing closer by the minute. Once, she says, she and Donald were forced to land on a Jersey beach; another time, the fog became so thick they had to hover over the Verrazano Bridge. The talk of friendship has made her pensive, and her initial vulnerability seems heightened.\n\nAs isolated as she is in her fancy helicopter, she’s no less so on the ground. “I don’t know why these gossip columnists make up things,” she says as the limousine takes us from the heliport to Trump Tower and the sky above turns even blacker. “They say Blaine [Ivana’s sister-in-law] and I are fighting, that we’re jealous of each other. That’s ridiculous. We’re not fighting at all. And why should I be jealous of her? It doesn’t make sense. But they write these things, and it hurts.\n\n“People get upset if you’re really happy. And I think it’s upsetting to people that Donald and I have it all: we’re young, we’re healthy”—Ivana knocks the polished wood on the car door—“we love our work, and we have a good marriage and children on top of that! People just can’t stand that.”\n\nThen, as the storm breaks with violent gusts of windswept rain, the limousine rolls up to Trump Tower. Dozens of New Yorkers, caught in the downpour, stand under the Tower’s brass canopy, casting covetous glances at the limo. A doorman, dressed in the uniform Ivana designed for him, rushes forward with a big umbrella and Ivana exits under it with a hurried good-bye, protected, insulated, her blue dress perfectly dry."
