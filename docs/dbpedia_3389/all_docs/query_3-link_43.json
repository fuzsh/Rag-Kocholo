        "text": "In this article\n\nThe Status Match Merry Go Round™\n\nI’ve written a number of times in the past about what I call the Status Match Merry Go Round. For those that have never read any of my posts about this before, the Status Match Merry Go Round is a series of status matching opportunities that, by the time all is said and done, will have grant you status in half a dozen programs, many of which you’ll be able to keep year after year.\n\nIn this article, I lay out the strategy of the Status Match Merry Go Round, step by step.\n\nGeneral note: Now that Hyatt and MGM have parted ways, the Wyndham to Caesars Diamond via the Barclays Wyndham Earner and matching in Atlantic City from Caesars to Hard Rock to Ocean Prime is the main match sequence left right now.\n\nBefore you read ANYTHING ELSE about the state of the Merry Go Round in Atlantic City, read this Jan 30, 2024 post.\n\nLatest Updates:\n\nJune 4, 2024: Both Fontainebleau and MGM have extended their tier match periods (see below). Wynn has expired.\n\nApril 18: 2024: People loved the simple Las Vegas guide right below this, that I made one for Atlantic City. Atlantic City Status Match Merry Go Round – 2024\n\nApril 15, 2024: Do not miss the new Las Vegas Status Match Merry Go Round – only fully available until May 31, 2024. (Note: June 1, 2024 – the Wynn match has expired, Fontainebleau’s has been extended to September 2, 2024).\n\nApril 2, 2024: New match to Wynn Platinum through May 31, 2024 in Las Vegas only.(Expired)\n\nFeb 17th: MGM Status Match Challenges are back through September 30, 2024.\n\nFeb 15th: Founders Card will no longer match to Caesars Diamond following the 2024 program year. I’ve never thought FC provided enough value to ever discuss here and so I still won’t… (HT: Miles to Memories)\n\nFeb 7, 2024: Fontainebleau Tier Match Returns through June 2, 2024\n\nJan 30, 2024: Read the recap of the state of the Status Match Merry Go Round in Atlantic City as of Jan 30, 2024 before going further in this post.\n\nJanuary 18, 2024: Updated South Florida section\n\nJanuary 10th, 2024: SUPER IMPORTANT – Read this before you even think about heading to Atlantic City for Hard Rock / Ocean\n\nJanuary 5, 2024: Hard Rock Atlantic City switches to Unity on Jan 9th, 2024.\n\nJanuary 1, 2024: Turning Stone in Upstate NY is no longer a Caesars Rewards reciprocal match partner.\n\nDecember 15, 2023: New Las Vegas status match opportunity at the Fontainebleau Las Vegas – WOW – this may already be DONE. Reports are that it was a one day only thing.\n\nJuly 27th, 2023: MGM is no longer matching at all. There is was a rather crazy MGM Status Challenge which expired Sept 30, 2023\n\nJuly 14, 2023: As anticipated, the MGM and Hyatt Reciprocal match is dead. The links to match are gone.\n\nJuly 11, 2023: Hyatt and MGM Cut Ties. Friday July 14th is your LAST DAY to match between Hyatt and MGM (either direction) if you haven’t already. You can still status match Ocean Prime in AC to MGM Gold through July 31st, however, you won’t be able to match that to Hyatt after July 31st and your status will still expire July 31st, rendering that useless, unless you have never had a Caesars card in which case it would be useful (for those two weeks) to get MGM Gold and match to Caesars Diamond which would be valid through Next January.\n\nOnce the dust settles in early August I’ll make some significant updates to this post (probably essentially rewrite it).\n\nJuly 1, 2023: Ocean changes benefits for 2023 – new 10 Day MSC cruise and Resorts World LV stay – loses Wynn. Now requires 18 months of inactivity to re-match.\n\nJune 20th, 2023: MGM Extends current matches to July 31, 2023 from June 30th. Existing matches were extended, new matches still possible.\n\nMay 31, 2023: Wyndham Matches are BACK – but as a Challenge.\n\nMay 5th, 2023: Live! in Philly no longer matches anything in the Merry Go Round to Black. It’s now only Platinum.\n\nMay 1st, 2023: Removed Rivers in Philly; cruise no longer being offered.\n\nMar 23, 2023: Added the SoCal / Las Vegas “On Ramp” to the Status Match Merry Go Round™\n\nMar 16, 2023: Added in the LIVE! match in Philadephia\n\nFeb 8, 2023: CAESARS Diamond to MGM Gold is now dead.\n\nNOTE: Caesars no longer matches to MGM Gold\n\nNote there is one remaining route on the Merry Go Round if you are near Atlantic City and have/can get the Wyndham Business Earner card or complete the Wyndham Diamond status challenge which is:\n\nAtlantic City: Wyndham Business Earner Card (or Wyndham Diamond status challenge) >> Caesars Diamond >> Hard Rock ICON>> Ocean Prime >> MGM Gold. You do need to do this all in person after getting the Caesars match… (You do match Wyndham to Caesars online, though you need to get the card in person.) Note that MGM only does a Status Challenge giving you just 3 months of status.\n\nJan 18, 2023: Updated South Florida casinos\n\nJan 12, 2023: MGM nationwide tier match extended\n\nOct 12, 2022: Updated the cruise offer section to include the MSC match and the Carnival match. See the Ocean Prime section and the following section.\n\nSept 14, 2022: Borgata no longer offers any perks with a match, even for first timers. You do still get Gold, though. Hard Rock no longer offers any perks if you have ever had a Hard Rock Wild Card before at any level, but you still get the match to Rock Royalty.\n\nJuly 20, 2022: Ocean Prime no longer works for the Baha Mar match. That eliminates all Merry Go Round Options as Hard Rock Rock Royalty is no longer accepted either. H/T Reader EL in the comments.\n\nJuly 1, 2022: MGM Nationwide Match Renewed through Dec 2022; Ocean Prime Match is Renewed.\n\nMarch 31, 2022: Added a new “side match” for Bally’s in Atlantic City\n\nMar 15, 2022: Caesars has ended the practice of “matching and re-matching” meaning that if you matched from Wyndham to Caesars and back to Wyndham, they will not let you match back again. If you have the Wyndham Business Earner credit card, you can still re-match.\n\nGet 75,000 Bonus Chase Ultimate Rewards points when you spend $6,000 in your first 3 months. Points are transferrable if you also hold a Sapphire Preferred, Sapphire Reserve, or Ink Business Preferred. Earn 5X at office supply stores including gift card purchases. Read how you may qualify for this credit card even without a traditional business entity. Get This Offer\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\n\nThe first step has changed. While Wyndham matches had been paused they are now back as a status challenge.\n\nIf you can’t do the status challenge, you can still use the Wyndham Business Earner card on-ramp!\n\nAlso – Ocean Casino Resort in Atlantic City is now matching new and inactive members to Prime status which includes a free annual cruise (no port fees) and two nights at Wynn.\n\nHere are a few of the posts I’ve written going all the way back to July of 2018:\n\n5 Status Matches and 5 Free Hotel Nights in 1 Day: Atlantic City – Hard Rock and Ocean AC Resort\n\nEasy Status Match to Wyndham Diamond (and possibly Total Rewards Diamond, Hyatt Explorist and Mlife Gold)\n\nStatus Match Merry Go Round: What to Do in January\n\nWithout question, these have been some of the most popular and widely shared articles I’ve written. In the MilesTalk Facebook group, I love when people post pictures of their various successes. Makes my day.\n\nThe phrase Status Match Merry Go Round™ comes from the fact that (at least as it stands now) you simply need to find a way onto the Merry Go Round and then, once there, it keeps going and going for you.\n\nI’ve gotten some feedback that some people have lost track of how this all works, as my info has been spread across various posts. So, I’m bringing this “full circle” today with a start to finish guide.\n\nCapital One Venture X: Earn 75,000 bonus miles when you spend $4,000 within your first 3 months. Get This Offer\n\nWhy Should You Care About the Status Match Merry Go Round?\n\nIn short, because it will confer a variety of statuses on you for relatively little effort and much is repeatable year after year once you get on the Merry Go Round.\n\nI’ll summarize all the programs and tiers involved:\n\nWyndham Diamond\n\nCaesars Diamond\n\nMGM Rewards Gold\n\nHyatt Explorist\n\nHard Rock Atlantic City ICON\n\nOcean Casino Prime (Atlantic City)\n\nSome bonus matches: South Florida and Resorts World Las Vegas\n\nWhat are the Primary Benefits of Each Status in the Status Match Merry Go Round?\n\nWyndham Diamond\n\nWyndham doesn’t really have a super exciting footprint nor program, but you will be entitled to early check in, late check out, and suite upgrades when you stay at a Wyndham property. I list this first, however, because it’s the primary “on ramp” to the Status Match Merry Go Round.\n\nCaesars Diamond\n\nWhile some people report better room offers at Caesars casino properties, that’s not a reliable benefit. Nor are upgrades. But what is reliable is this:\n\n– Free Parking at Caesars casinos/hotels\n\n– Skip the Line at most restaurants (I’ve saved hours on line with this perk)\n\n– A free four night stay at Atlantis (Also see:Free Atlantis Stay via Caesars Total Rewards Diamond: What To Expect with Room Fees, Food Costs, and More)\n\n– A free $100 “Celebration Dinner” each year including status renewals (renewal dinner only if you have earned Wyndham Diamond status, which includes the Wyndham Earner Business card method). Some members seem to need to get 100 Tier Credits in a year to use the benefit while others do not.\n\n– Free monthly show tickets.\n\n– Waived resort fees\n\n– Diamond Lounge access (requires $10 in comps per person)\n\n– Taxi Queue line cut\n\nMGM Rewards Gold\n\nFree parking (including valet) at MGM resorts, priority checkin, priority buffet seating, potentially better room offers.\n\n(Current MGM Status Challenge until September 2024– note you cannot match from Caesars Diamond anymore, but in Atlantic City you can match Caesars Diamond to Hard Rock ICON to MGM Gold)\n\nHard Rock Atlantic City ICON\n\nWhen it is your very first time matching to ICON (this includes the former Rock Royalty) at Hard Rock Atlantic City, you’ll receive:\n\nTwo complimentary nights, valid any day of the week\n\n$50 Bonus Free Play\n\nOngoing benefits include lounge access for a $10pp fee (in comp dollars), free self or valet parking, priority line at buffet. Priority checkin and 12pm check out.

That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? To find out how this all works.\n\nWhen I did my first ride on the Status Match Merry Go Round, I did everything I’m sharing with one exception. Back then, a Founders Card membership was the easiest way. Not wanting to pay for Founders Card as I didn’t (and still don’t) see value in it, I won my Wyndham Diamond in a charity auction for about $250. It’s been well worth it.\n\nBut now, it’s so much easier, thanks to the Wyndham Business Earner.\n\nStep 1: Wyndham Diamond\n\nOnce you have that Wyndham Business Earner card (or, worst case, a Founders Card which grants Caesars Diamond), you will be Wyndham Diamond automatically.\n\nStep 2: Caesars Rewards\n\nNow that you have a nice shiny Wyndham Diamond card, you are entitled to an automatic match to Caesars Rewards Diamond. You can do this online here. Wait for your account to update at Caesars. It could be the next day or it could take a week.\n\nYou’ll be automatically eligible for that Atlantis stay now and the $100 Celebration Dinner credit is in your account to redeem in person.\n\n(Update: It seems not everyone is still getting the $100 Celebration Dinner unless they earned status or got it via the Wyndham Business Earner Card; YMMV)\n\nYou can use this status for Step 4 below now that Step 3 is dead.\n\nStep 3: MGM Rewards\n\nUntil September 30, 2024, you can take a Hard Rock Icon card (see Step 4 below) to an MGM property for 3 months of MGM Gold status. It’s a status challenge. Read more about the MGM Gold Status Challenge (not a full match!) here.\n\nStep 4: Caesars to Hard Rock to Ocean Prime – Atlantic City\n\nAs of June 2024, Hard Rock in Atlantic City only is matching Caesars Diamond to ICON status. It’s also rematching those that have previously had ICON status, unlike other Hard Rock locations. This could change at any time.\n\nBring your Caesars Diamond to Hard Rock to match to ICON and then bring your ICON card next door to Ocean Casino Resort to match to Ocean Prime.\n\nMatches from March 2024 on are valid until June 2025, however, if you match between March and June 2024, you’ll need to pick up a new card sometime after July 1, 2024 valid until June 2025 (a March – June 2024 match will show June 2024 as the expiration date until you pick up that new card).\n\nCurrently, Ocean Prime comes with 2 nights at Wynn Las Vegas per status year and a yearly (calendar year) free 10-night cruise (no extra fees) on MSC Cruises, valid anywhere but China. Requires just a $400 deposit pp given back to you as onboard credit.\n\nClick here to see the Ocean Prime travel benefits brochure with all details on the 2 free Wynn nights and the MSC Cruise – including phone numbers to call to book.\n\nIt takes until about the 17th of the month following the month that you match to be able to book either of these.\n\nOnce again – you can use the Wynn nights just once per member year (July – June) but you can take one MSC cruise EACH calendar year.\n\nExample: Match August 5th. Starting September 17th (they say 15th but it’s often late), you can book your MSC cruise that sails by Dec 31st. Then in January you can book another one that departs by June 30.\n\nI’ll repeat the benefits from above:\n\nHard Rock Atlantic City ICON\n\nFirst time members\n\nTwo complimentary nights, valid any day of the week\n\n$50 Bonus Free Play\n\nOngoing benefits:\n\nLounge access for a $10pp fee (in comp dollars), free self or valet parking, priority line at buffet. Priority check-in and 12pm check out. Free car wash once per month at Rocktane.\n\nOcean Atlantic City Prime\n\nOne time free access to the Player’s Lounge ($10 comp dollars per person thereafter), free parking (including valet). First time Ocean members also get 2 free nights Sun-Fri. Also: Free nights at Wynn Las Vegas and a free 10 day (anywhere but China) MSC Cruise each calendar year. Must be a new member or inactive for the last 18 months.\n\nBonus on this bonus! You can status match to MSC’s loyalty program before you book a cruise. Check this chart for what matches to what as of 2024. Hilton Diamond gets you top tier, for example.\n\nBonus Cruise!\n\nAnd one more cruise bonus – on Carnival! You qualify in a way similar to the MSC status match, but in this case it’s more nebulous what will get you what. I’d probably upload the Ocean Prime since it’s the highest tier.\n\nI’ll also take a moment here to mention that IF you plan to actually gamble for comps, your first trip to a casino plays heavily into the comps you’ll initially receive, so play wisely and read this article from TravelZork before you go…\n\nMore cruises in Step 12!\n\nStep 5: Hyatt Explorist\n\nDead.\n\nYou now have hopefully, at least 4 statuses now. You have the one you started out with plus Wyndham Diamond, Caesars Diamond and MGM Gold. Now, my friend, you can match to Hyatt Explorist as well. And this is, happily, an online match as well. Just hit the OPT IN button here. Note, if that doesn’t work, try going to this page on the MGM Website and logging in. Look for the OPT-IN button on that page.\n\nHyatt and MGM parted ways in 2023, so this part no longer exists.\n\nStep 6: Bonus Match to American Airlines AAdvantage Gold Status\n\nBonus Round: Thanks to the new Hyatt and American Airlines partnership, you can get a 3 month status trial and fast track challenge to AAdvantage Gold by linking those accounts.\n\nNow also dead since you can’t get Hyatt status via the Merry Go Round anymore 🙁\n\nStep 7: Bonus Match to South Florida Casinos\n\nAs with most of the Merry Go Round, this once very lucrative match has been very watered down per Ben in the comments.\n\nHere is what is left:\n\nHialeah Park Casino\n\nNow only gives $25 free play when signing up and then you must earn 250 slot points on signup day and you will receive $175 more free play. This is not even a match.\n\nGulfstream Park Casino\n\nMatch to Win Level using Hard Rock Unity (Caesars Diamond no longer works)- no reported perks\n\nCasino Miami\n\n$150 in free play for matching from the Gulfstream Win card. Caesars Diamond would not have matched to anything.\n\nIn case you are still not convinced about the above, Nick of Frequent Miler saw the post in the MilesTalk group and took his own detour to South Florida, confirming his findings.\n\nThanks to reader Luke for updated on these matches in Jan 2023 and Ben in Jan 2024.\n\nStep 8: Bonus Match to Resorts World Las Vegas\n\nResorts World Las Vegas doesn’t publicize a Status Match, but they do have one. Two, actually. If you are a “real” gambler, they’ll match your offers (and status) – per Michael Trager of Travel Zork, but most of us on the Merry Go Round are more casual. So what about if you only have the “standard” cards the Merry Go Round offers? The answer will be your MGM Gold.\n\nThey’ve just changed their whole program over, so it’s not clear what matches to what now. Please report back! Note that it doesn’t seem like whatever MGM Gold matches to gives many perks.\n\nStep 9: Rivers Casino (Philadelphia)\n\nWinford K. in the MilesTalk Facebook group discovered *another* Philly match that also gives a cruise!\n\nTheir Rush Rewards will match MGM Gold or Caesars Diamond to their mid-tier Platinum.\n\nUpdated: May 1, 2023 – This no longer results in a free cruise which the casino now states is only for earned status.\n\nPeople are getting calls having the cruises cancelled 🙁\n\nStep 10: Fontainebleau Las Vegas\n\nGet up to $300 in goodies if you match by Sept 2, 2024.\n\nFontainebleau tier match details are here.\n\nStep 11: Wynn Las Vegas\n\nExpired\n\nStep 12: Want More Free Cruises?\n\nYou can take your highest status cards and/or offers and try for free cruises at Carnival, Holland America, Princess, and Virgin.\n\nDifferent people get different deals. There is no roadmap of what matches to what but many are getting free cruises so just use your highest tier or best offer.\n\nCarnival Fun Match Form(You can use your Ocean Prime or even Caesars Diamond card for this – they are only asking for your highest tier card to determine offers).\n\nHolland America Player’s Club Match – upload your highest tier. Doesn’t hurt to put in the comments the best offer you already have if it’s a good one!\n\nPrincess Cruise Match Form – (they will contact you)\n\nVirgin Cruise Match Offer– must upload an offer from a competing cruise line. While I’d imagine you could use your MSC cruise from Ocean, I think most people do better using what Carnival gives them.\n\nAnd just to make sure, you already got your free MSC Cruise, right?\n\nStep 13: Round and Round it Goes\n\n(See caveat below)\n\nIn January and February, you have homework. Come January, your Wyndham will drop to Blue Level. But you have your Caesars Rewards Diamond that you matched online. Login and check your Caesars Rewards. Still Diamond, right?\n\nNow go ahead and go back to the Wyndham page and match. This will re-up your Wyndham Diamond status.\n\nThen make a note for a few days into February. Your Caesars status will lapse Feb 1. But you can go back to the Caesars page then and re-up for another year!\n\nSadly, as of 2022, this “match back” only works if you have the Wyndham Business Earner credit card or Founders Card – or get lucky! (some have)\n\nSee Why I call it the Status Match Merry Go Round™?\n\nI’m sure you do… (although it used to be MUCH more of a full circle Merry Go Round than it is now after so many program changes that aimed to end it).\n\nGet 75,000 Bonus Chase Ultimate Rewards points when you spend $6,000 in your first 3 months. Points are transferrable if you also hold a Sapphire Preferred, Sapphire Reserve, or Ink Business Preferred. Earn 5X at office supply stores including gift card purchases.
