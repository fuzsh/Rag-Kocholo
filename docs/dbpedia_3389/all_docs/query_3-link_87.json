        "text": "Transcript\n\nReason with Allison Katz\n\nJeff Chang: We live in unreasonable times, and it’s in moments like this that we need big ideas. And for that we can look to our past. 300 years ago, a revolution of ideas called the Enlightenment began. People believe that humankind against all odds could improve itself and flourish. That problems could be solved through the practical application of reason. And from this basic idea came many more: humanism, individualism, progress, inquiry, and liberty. It was a time of optimism. As an expression of these principles, the idea that art could reflect the values and concerns of society took root. Today we live in a polycultural world moving rapidly into a future that’s still reckoning with the mistakes of its past.\n\nIt begs the question, are these enlightenment ideals still relevant? Artists still hold a mirror up to society. They let us see who we are, and in doing so, they sometimes show us who we can be. They give us the measure of the human spirit and inspire us to think deeply about the world so that we can create together. At their best, artists reveal a foundational truth and lead us toward a better future. Over six episodes, we speak to some of the most influential artists of our time, connecting them with some of the world’s best thinkers, poets, scientists, and philosophers who share their curiosity around these centuries old ideas. It’s at this crossroads of artistic insight and intellectual curiosity that we find the edge of reason.\n\nA new limited series podcast produced by Atlantic Re:think, the Atlantic’s branded content studio, in partnership with Hauser and Wirth, a home to visionary, modern, and contemporary artists. Each week we’ll transcend the boundaries of time and thought, channeling the spirit of the enlightenment to delve into the obsessions that underpin the work of some of today’s leading artists. This week we’re speaking with Allison Katz, a Canadian-born London-based painter whose diverse images from roosters and octopuses to landscapes and fanciful renderings of her own name explore the often contradictory nature of identity, memory, and meaning. And also joining us today is Nuar Alsadir, psychoanalyst, poet and author of the acclaimed poetry book, Fourth Person Singular, as well as the 2022 book, Animal Joy, A Book of Laughter and Resuscitation, which explores the liberating possibilities of curiosity and humor. Allison, what role does reason play in your process? Is reason a limit or a boundary?\n\nAllison Katz: Well, I think the act of painting is very reasonable in the sense that it is bounded by this rational thing called the frame. And the choices one makes before they even start painting are all very rational. There’s a scale, there’s a size, there’s the material, and there’s the limit of the size. I don’t really know how else to put it, but it seems to me it’s a very rational frame in which to then touch and engage with the irrational. But it wouldn’t be possible if it wasn’t so bounded initially and if it didn’t operate on a sort of logic that you have these materials inside this space, and so you begin with a very deliberate set of tools and a history.\n\nI think it takes a lot of courage inside process to stay with this unknowing and to withhold judging both in terms of what the thing will look like, what effect it will have on both oneself and the viewer, and how it will lead to other things. So this idea of ambiguity or uncertainty, it is what I think actually connects a work of art to a viewer. Even if there are very recognizable features or factors to the work, there is some level of risk with not fully understanding the impact or the import of the artwork. And I think the painter, the artist has to feel it themselves first. And so that means not finishing it fully, if that makes sense, but really leaving something a little bit open or even a lot open in whatever form that takes.\n\nJeff Chang: Nuar, you’re a poet and a psychoanalyst. How did you come to these twin vocations and how did they come together in your mind?\n\nNuar Alsadir: I would have to go back to childhood. When I was young, I thought I had ESP because no one around me was talking about the things that I was perceiving and feeling, and I of course didn’t. It was just that I didn’t know how to understand what wasn’t put into language or explained to me. And I found the arts really early and in the arts I played multiple instruments. I was a ballet dancer. I wrote poetry. I felt as though I was inside of a world that perceived and felt and thought the way I did. I also came from a family in which both of my parents were doctors, many of my relatives were as well. And it was assumed that I would become a doctor.\n\nI was good in school, I was good at math and science. And when I went to college, I was pre-med and in looking for a major, I found neuroscience. I was completely fascinated with the brain and how it works and ways of understanding that. I ended up dropping pre-med and my neuroscience major and doing an English major in my last year because I didn’t want to be a neurologist. So I did an English major. I moved to New York, did an MFA in poetry, was going about my writing world and publishing and just missed the brain. Eventually, decided to go back and train to become an analyst. So it seems like they’re very separate professions, but through the path my life took, they were interconnected.\n\nJeff Chang: Thank you so much for that. This might be a little bit jarring, but I wanted to ask you this question. How do you think of the enlightenment idea of reason? What’s reason to you?\n\nNuar Alsadir: Reason is one of the most important tools we have for understanding our world and our experience and making sense of things. It’s not the only tool and it’s not the only approach, but it is crucial. And I find in psychoanalysis, there are moments when reason is essential, and there are other moments when other approaches need to be enlisted. For example, if I’m working with someone in analysis whose formative conflicts occurred during a period of time in their lives that was pre linguistic, in order for them to be able to communicate that to me, I can’t demand that they use language because if they didn’t have language when it was imprinted in their brains, then they can’t use language only to communicate it to me. They have to use other forms of communication, what we call in psychoanalysis, unconscious communication. So I have to tend to other levels of communication and other ways of emitting and receiving signals. And some of those are communicated outside of language through the body.\n\nJeff Chang: In your book, Animal Joy, A Book of Laughter and Resuscitation, which is brilliant by the way, it’s so wonderful, you talk about how meaning can move between the body and the mind, and sometimes even between the body and the body. That it can bypass reason, I think is what your point is here. I’m wondering if you can explain that a little bit more for our listeners.\n\nNuar Alsadir: Freud’s earliest study was with what he called hysteria, which is also sometimes called a conversion disorder. And conversion symptoms to him were when something in the mind is converted to the body. It gets encoded, encrypted so that it can be moved out of the way and not disturb a person so they can function in all of the ways that they want to function in the communal world. So when a person has hysterical symptom or a conversion, it’s a way of moving the thought from the mind to the body, and the mind and the body are not quite as distinct as we like to think of them as being. For example, what is the mind?\n\nMetaphorically, we think of it as being in the head, but where is it? Can you point to it? Of course not. We think of the brain as being representative of the mind, but we receive information all over the body, so it would have to be considered to be throughout not only our bodies, but also maybe interpersonally because our bodies also are not as enclosed as we’d like to imagine. For example, on the first day of my biology class in college, the professor said, “We think of ourselves as being enclosed and our bodies having an interior. In actuality, there is the external world inside of our bodies because we have so many microbes in our digestive system, for example. And we have two openings on either end for this external environment that is housed inside of our bodies, so we’re not as separate from the external world as we like to imagine.” And that was mind-blowing for me. And it also leads to quantum entanglement, ideas of space-time, and the ways in which we have no, now I’m talking to you, but as I speak to you, it takes your mind an eighth of a millisecond to process what I’m saying, so I’m actually speaking into your immediate future. Even as we’re all present together, we’re not present in space and we’re not present in time, but we’re somehow entangled.\n\nJeff Chang: Wow. Here we are all together. And Alison, I know you’ve been anxious to speak with Nuar about her work. Where do you want to start?\n\nAllison Katz: Well, aside from Animal Joy, which I love, I’ve been delving deep into fourth person singular. And there was one paragraph or one section, one poetic section, I don’t even know because the format is so experimental and interesting to me. But there’s one section where you talk about this childhood character that you used to read about called The Great Brain who enlisted his unconscious basically to solve any problems. And the last sentence of that you wrote, “Even if it were possible to consciously enlist the unconscious in this way, in order to do so, you’d have to open yourself up to what might seep out.” And I feel that the power of psychoanalysis as a practice is that you are connecting to what might seep out and learning how to live with that and even transform it into energy or excitement, things that previously used to feel so unnameable. But it’s true that one never expects the seeping, and yet the seeping is the energy. I would love to hear you speak more about that.\n\nNuar Alsadir: I was thinking as you were talking about excitement, how so many people are ashamed of excitement. It’s embarrassing and how many emotions or expressions that are connected to our fundamental energy source embarrass us, especially when they are expressed through the body, how detached we try to be from the body in order to be sophisticated, cultured, poised. And yet if you are an artist, how essential it is to be able to tap into that power source in order to create and how doing so in a way also pulls you further from everything that we’re taught to value and project the ways of being that will be rewarded for. You have to be willing to let what seeps out, seep out.\n\nAllison Katz: We were always taught… Not always, let’s say I had very good graduate school experience and was very lucky to be visited and to listen to some of the greatest contemporary artists. And it almost was the running theme that if you can use embarrassment as your gauge, you are probably making something good or at least worth looking at if it embarrasses you or if it causes some sort of discomfort, there is some of the true self. And then that is what communicates. And it’s not only embarrassment of course, but that is actually a great registration of meaning.\n\nJeff Chang: I’m wondering if we might be able to talk about laughter actually, which of course is the topic of Animal Joy. And Allison, it’s key to your work, it feels like. Nuar you open your book with an illustration of you with your daughters at the dinner table? I’m wondering if you could tell that story a little bit and why you think it’s so important.\n\nNuar Alsadir: One of my daughters sat down to dinner, looked at the food and said, “Disgusted, I’m not hungry.” And her sister said, “That’s rude.” And she said, “I don’t care what you think.” And then I said, “That’s rude too. You should apologize.” And she slipped. And instead of saying, “I’m sorry,” she was looking at me and she said, “I’m sorry for you.” And the moment the slip registered, her lips tucked in and she was trying really hard not to laugh. And then her sister laughed and they both burst into a hysterical fit of laughter. And I go into a quotation from Orwell where he says, “Every joke is a tiny revolution.” And there’s no harm in it, but it does overturn the power structure. It’s a form of resistance to my authority. I demanded an apology. And apologies are ridiculous in many ways because they’re magical thinking. It’s not as though once you say, sorry, everything is transformed, or things get bigger, it’s really sadomasochistic. You’re asking the other person to submit. And if they submit, then you’re on top and then you can accept their submission.\n\nAllison Katz: When I read that, I was like, wow, that could be that maybe the use of humor within painting is a way to try and overcome the authority of art history. And even though that authority is also very life-affirming and grants permission because it’s open to participate in, it also feels sometimes like it’s closed. And the joke is a way to break it open and also feels subversive in the sense that it feels wrong and against, let’s say the master, the seriousness. But I always found that humor is a way of generating image. But again, it feels like a very abstract thing. I’m not sure I could even explain why or how, except when I read more about the sort of way that you explained how humor works and operates. I could see that it is that sort of revolutionary spark, however tiny, and that is very generative.\n\nNuar Alsadir: Can you think of an example in painting of a joke or humor?\n\nAllison Katz: Well, that painting that I made that shows a road and chicken and a cock, effectively, they look like they’re crossing the road. Well, there’s a road and they’re there. And I called the painting, Don’t Ask because ASK are my initials. But also, why did the chicken cross the road? And this why I’ve been told by those who knew me as a child and actually those who know me now, that I ask a lot of questions that I can be relentless. Why? Why? Why? And so to me, this was also a joke about maybe there’s no answer. There’s no reason in this case. And actually I think that painting is the one place where in a way, you don’t ever have to justify why you’re doing something.\n\nNuar Alsadir: With poetry. It is similar. Why would you write poetry if you wanted to explain something? You would write in prose. Poetry is outside of the sentence, but also the sentence of history and logic and reason. You’re permitted to communicate and transmit meaning in whatever way you want. It’s an area of freedom and free play.\n\nAllison Katz: Especially how you use it. Because I feel that you are also often hinting at reasonable forms like numbering something, but then you’ll do numbers that are out of order. There’s that once a reference to the logic of numbering one, two, three, but then if you go from 35 to 12, the logic is out of order.\n\nNuar Alsadir: And Freud said there’s no sense of time in the unconscious, so when you’re in the unconscious, all of those modes of reason dissolve. And there’s also no sense of time in the way that the unconscious exerts its force on our current lives. And yet it has such a strong hold on the way we think.\n\nAllison Katz: And I think that as someone who has been in and out of analysis for close to 20 years now, it is a tool. It is one of the main forms of motivation. Even excitement towards painting, for example. And something I just read that James Joyce said, imagination is memory. And I thought, well, that makes so much sense for the pursuit of a psychoanalytic relationship to meet your memory, learn to visit it again from a different time in your life. It is really an overturning of this logic that can govern a lot of decisions and a lot of moves. And it also opens up memories that were previously almost locked away or inaccessible from a creative point of view with the understanding that you will also have other things seep out. It’s not a process that you can control, but it certainly is, for me anyhow, one of the primary ways to understand creativity and memory.\n\nThat there are very few, let’s say, activities for the true self to be accepted and to be developed. Painting or poetry in and of itself, you have to be able to find methods to sit with that discomfort, both in understanding your own motivation or your own drive and to hold on through process, which can be very testing and surprising. I actually find that painting is not something that gets easier and it’s not something that becomes habitual.\n\nIt actually is constantly calling for renewal and difference. And I guess I thought you get better, it’s linear. And for sure you learn more skills, but then you have to almost scramble how you use those skills. And that is not logical. It is not linear, right?\n\nNuar Alsadir: I think if it stays alive, there are so many artists and writers who once they become successful, imitate themselves and then they’re creating the same kind of work, but it loses that aliveness that you achieve if you’re constantly trying to renew. To go back to what you were saying about memory also, it’s thought that every time we recall a memory, we change it.\n\nAnd so the memories that we recall most frequently keep getting altered through the lens of the present in which they’re being recalled. And what happens then is that the memory continues to change alongside a person’s idea of themselves or the story of themselves that they have. So when you recover a memory that hasn’t been recalled, it’s often very surprising because it hasn’t been evolving with your idea of yourself.\n\nBut in being recalled, it’s like a photograph from the past or a portal to the past as it was. And there’s a newness, a freshness to it that can be destabilizing if you’re invested in the idea of who you are. They say that the only perfect memory, true memory is the memory in the mind of someone with amnesia because it’s never recalled. It’s in that vault.\n\nJeff Chang: Does that resonate with the processes that you might’ve undertaken under any of your paintings? Can you give us maybe examples of what you might be hearing in Nuar’s words here that resonate for your work?\n\nAllison Katz: I mean, yeah (affirmative). The thing that I immediately think of is how I can look at something for a long time but not be ready to paint it. It could be an old photograph, it could be a poem, it could be an article, a painting from art history, something like that, like an image. And I think what I’m also doing is gathering over time a visual relationship, like I’m making a memory of this thing. And it’s almost as though if I have a sufficient memory bank of it, it starts to be something that isn’t that exact thing and it starts to be something that can be adapted and can become a conversation. But when I read this [inaudible 00:26:32], that imagination is memory. It made a lot of sense about a psychoanalytic bent. This feeling of why does it matter to interrogate however gently what one thinks one is made of. And I also think visual memories are really powerful thing because they’ve also done studies that people who have a very good memory can draw better.\n\nBecause in fact we are always recalling. And that really goes along to something I’ve believed, which is that every brush mark is a quote. Every painting’s been made, every possible way of making something has been made, but we are in conversation with it and we bring to it a certain set of conditions that are unique and that’s how it progresses. It’s circular and it sort of eats itself. And I also love that line, how Freud said, “Can I eat it?” Or what is it again, our first interaction.\n\nNuar Alsadir: He says that the first thought is I would like to eat it or I would like to spit it out. That’s the initial way that we interact with the world.\n\nAllison Katz: But that’s also about taste, the literal taste. I want it through my mouth and also my likes and my dislikes. And that’s why I’m so fond of using that mouth frame, which is a quote of a woodcut by André Derain from 1943 because it’s to say the frame of the body can never be not mentioned. And in this way it is sort of like a liminal space. Painting is not an interior condition. It’s as much an exterior state of the world. I never thought of painting as being, “I have an inside thought and I want to present it to the outside.”\n\nIt’s more this kind of continuous relay between inside and outside that gets caught for a moment on a surface. That is also a skin and that also conceals. This idea of the blank canvas is such a myth, such a fiction because there’s nothing ever blank. We aren’t coming to things blank. And to me that’s painting’s great contribution. It’s that it is always referential. It is always referring to something, even if the artist themselves doesn’t even know. That’s actually really powerful and really important.\n\nJeff Chang: I’m thinking of the paintings that you made of cabbages. The different layers of cabbage that you can peel off. Nuar, what’s coming up for you as you’re listening to Allison?\n\nNuar Alsadir: I was curious, Allison, when you use the term ready, how do you know when you’re ready?\n\nAllison Katz: That’s a good one. I think a lot of that is actually related to being in the world. So things like an invitation to me are some of the greatest gifts the world can give to something dormant. You’re invited, an exhibition invitation, meeting someone new, having to perform even in a conversation. This is when things come to the surface and announce themselves as ready. I think we like to think somehow that painting is always generated from within and from this sort of independent soul but I feel very codependent.\n\nI think painting is very codependent in a healthy way on context. And that’s also what makes it contemporary because one doesn’t have to set out to be contemporary so long as you are just conscious of the time you’re living in. But that could even mean conscious of the person you’re speaking to in that moment.\n\nJeff Chang: Nuar we’re talking about artist performance and for Animal Joy, you decided to enroll yourself in clown school. And I’m wondering what came of that particular experience? What did you learn about the brain and about reason and about the subconscious in clown school?\n\nNuar Alsadir: That’s a great question. I decided to go to clown school because I had been doing research for the book and going to places where there was laughter. So for example, I went to hear standup comedy. I went to improv shows, storytelling. And I ended up trying to pay attention to when the audience laughed. And I noticed that it may be our contemporary moment, the audience laughed most, not because something was funny, but because it was honest.\n\nI was talking about this and someone said to me, “Well, you should really look at clown because that is the whole basis of it.” And so I took a one-day workshop and it was absolutely impossible for me to let myself go enough. I was fascinated by it, but it was too foreign a world for me to jump into and start running. So I enrolled in a two week, six hour a day intensive program. And it was life altering.\n\nEssentially the idea in clown is that if you connect with your emotion on stage, the audience will witness it and they will understand that connection to emotion and they will feel your emotion and they will be moved. And that will be marked by laughter. They won’t laugh because you’re funny. I later analyzed the way this might work in the mind. And what I think happens is mere networking systems operate in such a way that if I were to witness someone about to slip, I would feel that slipping feeling inside myself as though it were my own. And what’s interesting about mirror neurons is that the same neurons fire, whether an action is originating in yourself or it’s originating in someone else. So you can actually feel someone else’s feeling inside yourself as though it’s your own. And it offers this mode of empathy, which is expansive.\n\nAs opposed to the kind of empathy where you look at something intellectually and you might say, “Oh, I can imagine that would be difficult.” But you’re staying in your position and the other person is in their position, and it’s an intellectual move to recognize it as something rational. And the other mode of empathy is one that Saidiya Hartman calls precarious, where someone puts themselves in someone else’s shoes. If you put yourself in someone else’s shoes, where do they go? Is it a form of colonization? Do you displace them? Does it have to be you in those shoes in order for it to be something you can identify with? It can be problematic, for obvious reasons.\n\nIn clown school, what I learned was a way of receiving people in their embodied being and not thinking so much about what they were saying, but receiving them emotionally, physically, and intellectually.\n\nAllison Katz: That sounds like that Francis Bacon quote, that painting is the patterns of one’s nervous system. And in this way, if someone is communicating with that honesty, then that creates an experience for the viewer. When I was reading all about clown in Animal Joy, I thought, “Well, the artist is a clown.” That’s exactly what it is. And honesty can be embarrassing. Back to that idea of the necessity of these sort of uncomfortable states, they’re also the ones that allow communication to happen without language, or communication to also happen over huge gulfs of time. Why can I look at a painting from hundreds of years ago and feel that I am feeling anything? This transmission is there, and it kind of stays in a surface. It can be expressed through brush marks and patterns and colors and all these nonverbal ways of holding that clown energy. I felt that was a perfect analogy for the act of painting, the act of viewing.\n\nNuar Alsadir: The psychoanalyst, Bion, who was Samuel Beckett’s analyst, had this idea that you’re supposed to, as the analyst, enter every session without memory, desire, or understanding. And it was exactly what we were told when we took the stage as clowns. We weren’t supposed to use an idea we’d used in the past that worked, which would be memory. We weren’t supposed to want to make the audience laugh, because if you want to make them laugh, you’re bound to flop, which would be the desire. And we weren’t supposed to begin with an idea, which would be the understanding. We’re supposed to bring our full selves embodied onto the stage, and see what impulse led us into the performance.\n\nSimilarly, he had this concept he called beta elements. And beta elements are these raw emotional transmissions that pass between people. The example he used to illustrate it was of a mother and an infant. And again, it doesn’t have to be gendered, but he did gender it. The infant doesn’t have language and cries, and the mother understands the different cries and what they mean by taking the cries into her own body and feeling them inside herself and asking, “What is that? What is that feeling?” And then metabolizing it and putting it back out in symbolized form, which would be language. “You’re tired.” And that process of metabolization is how an infant learns to think.\n\nThey need this adjunct being to teach them how to metabolize the raw data that they receive from the universe. When it comes to art making, if you metabolize too much and you over-edit and you clean up, in writing, the work so that it’s processed like a piece of American cheese in plastic wrapping, then there’s nothing that gets transmitted. There are no beta elements that reach the reader’s body. And without the hooks and snags, there will be no emissions that somehow miraculously continue to emit their force over centuries. There’s nothing for the reader to really pick up at that embodied level. And minds will receive it, but they won’t necessarily feel moved.\n\nAllison Katz: And part of being moved is the desire to make. When I’m looking in a way that I’m moved, I want to respond. And this idea of seeing things as a call and response is so moving to me, that conversations happen across time with strangers. No one is a stranger, then. It’s always this possibility for conversation. And conversation without language is also really interesting. When I look at something or read something that gives me space to think and write and respond, I think, “Wow, that’s the gift of engaging with painting and poetry.” And when I was reading Animal Joy and Fourth Person Singular, I felt as though I was speaking to you, Nuar. I was receiving things on this way where I’m like, “Oh, that is…” Now I was more conscious to try and articulate, “What is this?” And it’s the feeling that it’s present.\n\nNuar Alsadir: That makes me happy.\n\nJeff Chang: And just to maybe tie it back to our theme, where does reason stand within that set of levels that you want to take people to?\n\nAllison Katz: Well, what’s funny is, sometimes the biggest enemy of painting is an idea. So when I have too much of an idea, I find that I really have to listen on how to let something else in. Because an idea, with all its reason and its logic, can leave no room for the logic of painting, which works in tandem, but you can’t go in too strong with what you want to get out of it and what you want someone else to get out of it. And so, the levels also have to be out of reach of the painter. There’s that first level of, “Okay, well, I’ve got this idea,” but then there’s all the other ways that it has to go. And I think what’s amazing about painting is that all the consciousness does reside in the surface.\n\nSo it’s another contradiction about depth and surface because the surface is the sight of the depth, and you have to trust in the surface to communicate all the levels, while at the same time perhaps being very straightforward on one level, that it could just be an image composed of pigments and inorganic material creating a representational scenario. And it’s perfectly reasonable and all right for a viewer to stop there and still get a lot out of it. Sometimes people say to me, “Well, if I didn’t know all this stuff or how you were thinking or if I didn’t know all these other references, I wouldn’t get the painting.“ And I say, ”But you would.“\n\nAnd also, it’s all right for painting to take time, meaning you don’t have to ascertain and get everything all in the first glance. That would, in fact, be not ideal, because it’s something that should accrue meaning over time. And being able to look at something over and over again is probably what I would prefer. A slow reveal is a deeper reveal. A painting could have the possibility of doing that, or not. I think that’s the risk you take with the surface, with keeping everything on one plane. So it’s something that it has an inexhaustible to it, both on a desire level and on a possibility level, but it can also be very simple.\n\nJeff Chang: I am Jeff Chang, and you’ve been on a journey to Edge of Reason. Join us next week when we speak with British sculptor Thomas J Price, and psychologist, Stephen Pinker, author of the 2018 book, Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism and Progress, as they explore the concept of progress, and how the notion helps to shape the purpose of their work. If you’ve enjoyed what you’ve just heard, like and review on Apple Podcasts, and help spread the word about our series to other listeners like you.\n\nTranscript\n\nHumanism with Nicolas Party\n\nJeff Chang: Do you ever wonder about what might have happened if dinosaurs had inherited the earth? Like, if the asteroid had never hit, what kind of world would they have made? Since the dawn of human evolution, we have always been a species that hasn’t just tried to advance our capabilities, but has ruminated about what we are capable of doing. In a word, we have self-consciousness. So we do not just create, we also think about the consequences and the ramifications of what we create, whether that’s a wheel, a painting, or an atomic bomb. Enlightenment thinkers call this humanism, and they use the term to talk about our capacity to perfect ourselves. And yet, we are also aware that within our powers of creation may lie the seeds of our own extinction.\n\nIn this episode, we speak to artists Nicolas Party and thinker Thomas Moynihan about the idea of humanism. What kind of world is humanity capable of making? Is humanity destined for perfection, or for destruction? For doom, or for glory? And what happens to us when we begin to imagine a world without us, without humans? Welcome to Edge of Reason, a new limited series podcast produced by Atlantic Re:think, the Atlantic’s branded content studio, in partnership with Hauser & Wirth, a home to visionary, modern, and contemporary artists. Each week we’ll transcend the boundaries of time and thought, channeling the spirit of the Enlightenment to delve into the obsessions that underpin the work of some of today’s leading artists.\n\nJoining us today is Nicolas Party, a Swiss-born, Brooklyn-based figurative painter who has achieved critical acclaim for his familiar yet unsettling landscapes, portraits, and still lifes that tap into themes of humanity, evolution, climate change, and extinction. And also here with us is Thomas Moynihan, a scholar who thinks about human contingency, the history of how humans think about our existence, our evolution, and our possible extinction. He currently works as a visiting researcher at Cambridge University’s Centre for the Study of Existential Risk. Nicolas, welcome to Edge of Reason.\n\nNicolas Party: Hi, it’s great to be here.\n\nJeff Chang: In your work, you construct still lifes, portraits, landscapes, imaginary worlds. And often these worlds, they might be devoid of humans. Where are you hoping to take viewers when you create these imaginary worlds?\n\nNicolas Party: I mean, that’s always a hard question when you’re an artist to ask, where do you want to bring the viewer? Because I don’t think, when you make arts, I think you want to have an open object for yourself and probably for the viewer. So I think when you try to create something like a landscape, in my case for example, I’ve been always trying to basically create those very clear, let’s say a cave or a mountain landscape, thinking it’s very identifiable, but also I’m trying to create that room that people can come in and basically put in that symbolic image, whatever they come with. If you paint mountains, for example, everybody can relate to it in whatever they want. And then of course, there’s my own investigation of why I paint this that way, and my relationship to let’s say mountains or cave or trees or those kind of portraits. And that’s kind of a day-to-day, ever-changing relationship, because your perspective shifts. It’s an ever-changing… Also, you forget things, that also makes you see differently. And I think it’s forever changing relationship to those themes that’s happening.\n\nJeff Chang: So, I want to come back to ask you about some of the subjects you’ve chosen as of late, like you’ve been painting wildfires, you’ve been painting dinosaurs, which is something I know Thomas thinks quite a lot about too. So, I wanted to bring in Thomas here. And Thomas, you’re someone who seems to spend a lot of time thinking about the biggest questions around humanity, like, are we headed for doom? Are we headed for redemption? How did you come to this work?\n\nThomas Moynihan: Yeah. That’s a good question. So, I study mainly what people thought in the past, often about the future, so I study the history of the future in some sense, but the main thing I’m interested in is just how beliefs change over time. I’m interested in how humans have oriented themselves towards the universe over time. And the main thing that I find interesting about that, and it’s that looking to the past, we realize just how otherwise beliefs have been, and therefore how different they can be or could be still. So what I mean by that is, the contingency of what we believe about ourselves and the universe, our beliefs, but also our existences, the ways our societies are formed, the way we act with each other, but even the existence of us entirely being contingent. Those are the things that interest me.\n\nAnd so to actually answer your question of how I came to that, I’m going to cerebralize it a bit, rather than just saying that it’s because I watched Jurassic Park as a kid. But from a very young age, I was fascinated by prehistoric creatures, particularly the ones from the Cambrian. Their names are just as weird as they look, so Opabinia, Anomalocaris, Hallucigenia, very weird animals. And I was obsessed with them as a kid. And it’s testament to how different life can be, how alien things in the past were. And then as I became older, I ended up doing an English degree, through chance more than design, and I realized you could apply that similar thought of just seeing the sheer vastness of difference in variability in the past, not just to animals and life forms, but also to human beliefs.\n\nJeff Chang: So, I’m wondering if you can give us a definition of this Enlightenment idea that we’re trying to probe today, this idea of humanism.\n\nThomas Moynihan: The way that I like to think of it is that it sees the human as a self-asserting being and a self-fashioning being. There’s this long tradition, again going very far back, of noticing that humans seem to lack some of the physical prowess or endowment, the strength or speed or stability of other animals. But what we lack in that department, we seem to make up for in our behavioral flexibility and inventiveness. We seem to lack an essential nature. We don’t rely on rigid, unchanging instincts. That lack is a form of plasticity, it’s a form of freedom. And so there’s this long tradition of seeing the human as this self-fashioning creature that makes itself through its own artifice. And so, I see this as a nice way of defining our freedom. It comes from a form of lack.\n\nJeff Chang: Well, you’ve written this amazing book called X-Risk: How Humanity Discovered Its Own Extinction, and you talk about this idea of existential risk. So, first off, what is existential risk, and how does it relate to this idea of humans’ freedom to be able to create?\n\nThomas Moynihan: So the term existential risk, I guess has become quite contentious in some ways, but at heart, all it means is that it’s an acknowledgement of the potential that there are certain events that could lead to a world without humans.\n\nJeff Chang: All right. So, this is where we bring in the dinosaurs, I think. Nicolas, you’ve been working on new paintings of dinosaurs. And Thomas, you said that this inquiry began for you as a child watching Jurassic Park. Nicolas, let’s start with you. Why have you started painting dinosaurs?\n\nNicolas Party: I found it like there’s something interesting that we could talk about, about why children have a fascination for an animal that was extinct. What I’ve been first interested in the dinosaur is a little bit of this maybe forced revolution in terms of basically the description, the illustrations of dinosaurs. Of course, we found dinosaur with only the bones, so there’s a great space there for imagination and creates, how did they look from the outside? In the early days, dinosaurs are really illustrated and described as heavy, dumb-dumb, very slow, and it’s obviously reassuring probably for humans to have those old creature that [inaudible 00:09:00] stupid.\n\nAnd then they have this suddenly coming of age that’s probably like the peak of Jurassic Park, where they’re very lean, super muscular, smart, but they look more or less all of them pretty aggressive. And then obviously lately with the discovering of this bird idea, that very likely dinosaur were basically the ancestors of birds, and the idea of feathers were probably in a lot of them, and especially in those small little hands, could be like little wings. And also, as you will find a skeleton of the camel, you will probably not know that they have this bump, all the fat, all the different elements, if you only have the skeleton. So, suddenly it emerged into how dinosaurs are viewed now as a very maybe humanist way to see them. Suddenly they’re like, they have kindness, they love each other, they also hunt together. I’ve seen all this.\n\nSomehow there’s another layer of that that I’m going to add, is that the arts as an academic and a field, contrary to illustrations, was never interested in dinosaurs. And I’ve found it all very fascinating. Illustration of dinosaur date mid-19th century to this date, and so that’s a pretty good spectrum of artistry. I find it interesting, again, children love dinosaurs, artists, they don’t care. They think it’s maybe not our problem. So somehow I was like, you know what? I want to try to approach that theme. And also, especially because now we have again this idea of the dinosaur not being like, well, they’re going to go instinct because they were just stupid, so it was natural they go extinct. Now we know more or less that it was basically pure randomness that they went away.\n\nJeff Chang: Thomas, you actually just wrote about this. I’m really excited to hear about what you’re thinking about all the things that Nicolas is talking about here.\n\nThomas Moynihan: Yeah. I mean, obviously I’m sitting here loving it and applauding silently. Yeah. I just wrote a piece on… The title of it was Don’t Denigrate The Dinosaurs, it was for Noema Magazine. And it was from, as we’ve said, I had this… And I think it’s relatively normal, as Nicolas acknowledged, this childhood fascination, admiration for these dinosaurs. And so over the years, as I’d been studying the history of science, of paleontology, et cetera, I was just shocked by how mean people were about dinosaurs, particularly around… There’s a period called the Great Dinosaur Rush, which was the 1880s to the early 1900s. And it was a period when there were these two American paleontologists, who just hated each other’s guts, and were competing with each other in this race to find the best dinosaurs. And it’s the period when all of the most iconic ones that we now cherish and love were discovered, triceratops, stegosaurus, allosaurus, et cetera.\n\nBut these people that dedicated their entire lives to studying these beasts were so mean about them. They were so denigrating. Even, talking of paleoarts, the great, I would say he’s probably the best historical paleoartist, Charles R. Knight, again someone that spent his life dedicated to drawing these animals, he referred to them as just stupid, ugly, too ugly to exist. And so I was interested in, where does all this come from? And so it’s rooted ultimately in this old assumption about evolution, that extinction works invariably or even always to weed out the lesser, the less worthy, the unfit, the maladaptive, so that they can be replaced with the better, which leads to this very progressive idea of evolution, this upsurge towards perfection.\n\nJeff Chang: Well, you also mentioned in your article that there’s a really interesting parallel at this particular point in history to the so-called Indian Wars in the U.S. and the genocide there, as well as the rise of eugenics and the debasing of non-European cultures from the late 19th century on up into the 20th century.\n\nThomas Moynihan: Absolutely. As much as the talking about the dinosaurs, it’s fun, it’s buoyant, this history is very serious though, because these European scientists writing this stuff, again in the decades straddling 1900, they used it to sanitize the genocide of indigenous people across the world as the outcome of inevitable natural selection, rather than a culpable political decision. They feigned sorrow and they feigned regret in Europe, but they could say, sad as it is, this is just the inevitable result of the cosmic process, that the lesser always gets wiped away. This history is blood-drenched to a degree. And I think that, again, there was very much motivated reasoning going on in propping up the dinosaurs as this precursor example of doomed to go the way of the dodo.\n\nJeff Chang: Nicolas, you do a lot of landscapes, and these are not the triumphant landscapes of the 19th century. These are really uncanny types of landscapes. And more recently as well, you’ve been doing paintings of wildfires. And so, I’m wondering how that fits maybe into what Thomas is talking about here, in terms of existential risk.\n\nNicolas Party: The history of landscapes, at least in Western culture, is more or less a history of humans’ intervention in landscapes. It’s really only very recently that actually [inaudible 00:14:25] landscape without human presence in it. For a long time, obviously the natural world and the wilderness is an actual danger. Now it feels like, obviously we are the danger, not the nature. This idea of painting a landscape without human traces is more like basically the idea of nature, which I find it very fascinating, because from the get-go in the Western biblical story, nature perfect is without human. There’s Adam and Eve, and it’s a complete symbiance with the animals, with the trees. But as soon as they become human, basically having sex, everything falls apart.\n\nAnd basically the entire goal of [inaudible 00:15:05] humans is to go [inaudible 00:15:07] and still to this day [inaudible 00:15:09] a nature without us. We know that we’re basically damaging the world and the landscapes around us. We’re not the first invasive species in the world that destroy everything, the ecosystem around it, but we’re definitely the first one to be conscious of it. And that’s fascinating. Humans seem to do it, and we regret it, but keep doing it. And that’s a very… In terms of Darwinian evolution, why it’s that, why we destroy everything, we’re conscious of it, and we don’t like it. It’s an interesting part of Homo sapiens.\n\nThomas Moynihan: Yeah. I mean, all species are invasive to some degree, if you’re going to put your Darwinian lenses on. But we’re not even the first species to cause mass extinction or to perturb the global climate. It’s very plausible that a very long time ago, when life first evolved photosynthesis in the form of cyanobacteria, these very crude towers of microorganisms called stromatolites that fossilized, and we know that these were big colonies of cyanobacteria, they photosynthesize, and one of the products of that is oxygen. And the atmosphere before this point didn’t have much oxygen in it, and so they oxygenated the atmosphere, which caused what some people call the oxygenation holocaust. It destroyed tons of life throughout the globe.\n\nNow, the difference between us and the stromatolites is that they definitely weren’t aware of what they were doing. We are. Humans have the computer simulations that can model planetary climates. And I would say that, I’m not saying this to pat ourselves on the back, because the fact that we’ve become self-conscious of it hasn’t stopped the wholesale destruction of ecosystems. We’re still doing it apace. However, the history, and I think this is where the history of ideas can come in and have a, I wouldn’t say vindicatory but a hopeful message, is that the history of ideas shows that we’ve only just really started to grapple with these things. And so I would say it’s probably at least premature to dismiss humanity as this species that is doomed to only vandalize the world in which it lives.\n\nAnd two further things I would say on that. The first thing is that this view, which I think has become quite attractive in our day of mass extinction and climate change, climate crisis, is this idea that there is this natural world, and all that human agency can do is to denigrate the value of it and to destroy it, to vandalize it. That just makes us the center of the universe again, but in a negative way rather than a positive way. We’re the protagonists of history, but we’re just fallen, in the way that Augustine thought that humanity was tainted with original sin. So, that’s one thing.\n\nFurther thing is that, to loop back to the dinosaurs, people were really mean about them. They had all these horrible beliefs that propped up other horrible beliefs elsewhere. But from the ’80s onwards, we found just overwhelming evidence, dinosaurs died because of a chancey impact. That asteroid is the avatar of chance and contingency. It’s not the handmaiden of adaptation or perfection. It’s pure chance. It smashed into the globe, it didn’t need to, it could have gone otherwise. And if it hadn’t done so, we probably wouldn’t be here today.\n\nBut I think that we should take that lesson of the dinosaurs, not to prejudge the fates of other animals, and apply it to ourselves. Again, that comes back to this question of humanism. Ironically and paradoxically, there is no such thing as the human as an essential category, because we invent ourselves. And so we’ve only just started to grapple with problems at this scale, and have only just started to figure out the severity of our actions in a way that the stromatolites never even came close to. So I’d say, it’s premature to dismiss us as this creature tainted by original ecological sin. Potentially we might be able to figure things out in the future. I like to cling to that hope, naive as it might be.\n\nNicolas Party: I really lean on that, and it’s probably also maybe a random quality of our species is to be, in a way, very doom-like and very pessimistic, but we’re also very optimistic. I am a very optimistic person. It will be silly in a way to say, “We’re going straight to the wall,” because I think we are in a way capable of change, and sometimes very positive change. And it’s true, there’s many examples in the issue of humanity that slavery was existing, and it’s not any more. But it shows that basically human adaptation can also be seen with a positive lens. And to be honest, also in our brief time on Earth, in all those few decades that we have here, it’s nice to have a little bit of positive anyway, a thing that drives us to go somewhere anyway. If it’s only negative, what are you going to do?\n\nThomas Moynihan: Yeah, I completely agree. I believe that the fact that we’re so pessimistic is, ironically, a cause for optimism. We now know that climate change is this awful thing that will destroy ecosystems and destabilize human society in ways that are unequally distributed and unfairly distributed based on historic use of fossil fuels. But a couple of generations ago, when scientists first started grappling with the greenhouse effect, so roughly 100 years ago, loads of scientists arrived at the idea that they were like, “Okay, cool. We can make the environment warmer by just burning all this stuff. Let’s just burn everything.” Some people were like, “Maybe we don’t know how this works, maybe we should be careful with what’s going on here.” But I found an engineer, an American engineer from the ’20s, saying, “All nations of the Earth should unite in immolating all of their seams of coal to pump the atmosphere with carbon dioxide,” because he thought that that would create this Edenic climate that’s clement, warm, and good for everyone.\n\nJeff Chang: Thomas, when you see Nicolas’s work, what kinds of questions rise for you?\n\nThomas Moynihan: I felt kind of, what’s the word, heartened to see that my interpretation might be borne out by Nicolas’s own sense of what he’s up to. It’s that ability to imagine a world without us is the acme thought of contingency, that everything could be otherwise up to the point in which we don’t even exist to even represent or think about the world. So I really enjoy that. And even your portraits have this kind of ahuman sense to them, I don’t know how else to describe it, where it’s almost like there aren’t even any humans in your portraits sometimes. I mean, that’s probably quite a controversial statement to make, so I’ll leave it there, but… Yeah.\n\nJeff Chang: What are you trying to do in these portraits? The gaze seems to be the most important piece, but the expressions are usually very neutral on your subjects. I wanted to ask about that.\n\nNicolas Party: When I started, to be honest, I didn’t know what I was doing, and I think artists often work that way. They have an intuition. It was the same with the dinosaurs, it’s still the same, and you want, while you’re working, create basically an object, which is let’s say a character in your life that you want to have a conversation with. But with the faces, they just appeared. And what happens is, very quickly I discovered that I was very intrigued by the portraits in Greek antiquity, in Greek sculptures. A lot of them, some of them really clearly don’t look like anybody that exists. And what was also fascinating is, women and men, especially when they’re young, look more or less the same, they have almost the same idealistic feature.\n\nI find it interesting, to jump a few thousand years later, with this AI and filter in Instagram where basically any camera or any filter makes our face look slightly less human and more ideal, moving wrinkle or lights, little spots or whatever it is in our faces. So basically I think my portraits, they were born between those… I live in that world, obviously I’m embedded into it, and I was looking at those older depicting of humans, and they basically represent the idea or the ideal idea of what a human face is. But obviously that character is in a way emptied. They look very directly at you, but also they really look past you. It’s almost like a ghostly spirit figure. So, they have been having this presence in my practice for a while.\n\nJeff Chang: What did they evoke for you, Thomas, in terms of thinking about the kinds of questions that you’re engaged in every day?\n\nThomas Moynihan: Well, one thing that just occurred to me, just listening to Nicolas talk now, is there’s this really fascinating cluster of connotations around the idea of perfection that goes back to the ancient Greeks. Aristotle at some point says that we use perfect to also mean something that has fulfilled itself in the sense of a death, because the perfect was the culmination, the endpoint, the fulfillment of all the thing is, and for a human life, that is death. So there’s this really intimate tangle of semantics around perfection, where actually it’s often seen as quite deadly, this idea that humanity will perfect itself out of existence by creating this computational God, all of this stuff.\n\nNicolas Party: I think that’s exactly what I’m trying to evoke as a feeling when you look at the portraits, and Thomas was trying to describe very interestingly, this idea of perfection that is the death of human. Even in Greek, or in Egypt, they had this idea, and maybe God was representing that, there was a higher power, which was maybe the ultra-intellectual idea of humans that will see us with our lust and anger and all these senses [inaudible 00:24:42] this is completely useless. Why we just don’t have a human being that is perfect, that doesn’t have all those defects that human has.\n\nThomas Moynihan: One of the reasons I’m interested in the history of ideas is because it’s a way of inhabiting different worlds, but they were real. These people inhabited completely different universes to us. And to try and step outside of ours and go back into theirs is just… It’s similar to fiction in some sense, and how bizarre it is. God was this dictator. He dictated time, fate, everything. Everything was orchestrated from the outermost layer of Heaven where God resided. It’s a form of authoritarianism. And so these people occupied this universe where there was, in reality, but also in conception, barely any leeway or room for human agency. And so, given that, you can see how radical the idea of humanism is.\n\nAnd so I think that we live in an era now where there’s a different authoritarianism of reality, and it’s the picture of the human that is presented to us as inescapable, inevitable, a product of strict, ironclad necessity, that we are these self-interested, selfish Darwinian agents, the Homo economicus. So the humanism of our age could be a rebellion against that in some sense, that clearly this paradigm is self-destructive to a degree, or at least precarious to an unlivable degree. So I think resurrecting the radicality of humanism is a rebellion against the powers that be, a way of dissolving arbitrary power and the corruptions thereof. I find that an exciting idea.\n\nJeff Chang: Last question then actually here, and this one’s for Nicolas. Do you think that art has a role to play in preventing the extinction of humanity?\n\nNicolas Party: I mean, as I know we’ve been discussing about, I think art is just the form of this representation of our conscious in some ways. And I think it’s more like the ripple effect with big issues, that makes people think, that makes people feel. So, I think art is basically like, you can’t really imagine a world without it, because it’s basically the essence of this conscious that is reflecting in those many layers of stories and inventing those doom ideas, and this idea of extinction, have existed more or less in fiction, painting, and then it basically comes to intellectual ideas. And of course the more practical scientists comes more or less at the end, but they’ve been having for a while now. But the fictional idea of the end of world and extinction has been happening for obviously a long time.\n\nThomas Moynihan: Yeah. The artists got there first. It was Mary Shelley. The Last Man’s the first novel-length depiction. So, the scientists are like 200 years late.\n\nJeff Chang: I can’t think of a better note to end on. Thank you both so much for this amazing conversation.\n\nNicolas Party: Thank you so much. It was really fantastic to speak to you, Thomas and Jeff. It was really [inaudible].\n\nThomas Moynihan: Yeah. It’s been a joy and a pleasure, so thank you both. Yeah.\n\nJeff Chang: I’m Jeff Chang, and you’ve been on a journey to Edge of Reason. Join us next week when we speak with figurative painter Christina Quarles, and writer-activist Cherríe Moraga, to explore the concept of individualism and how that notion intersects with the purpose of their work.

It’s a question that resonate with enlightment thinkers, one that speaks to human potential. They posited that each person, through personal development and self-expression, was a unique entity with the power to shape themselves, communities, and democracies. What are you? That’s a much different question. One that takes us down a different path, delving into the nuances of human diversity. Recognizing our differences helps us make sense of our world, but it’s also been a tool for exclusion and division. In this episode, artist, Christina Quarles, and the poet, playwright, and essayist, Cherríe Moraga, discuss their ideas of individualism.\n\nWho are we? Who can we become? And what prevents us from becoming who we believe were meant to be?\n\nWelcome to Edge of Reason. A new limited series podcast produced by Atlantic Re:think, the Atlantic’s branded content studio, in partnership with Hauser and Wirth, a global leader in contemporary art. Each week, we’ll transcend the boundaries of time and thought, channeling the spirit of the enlightenment to delve into the obsessions that underpin the work of some of today’s leading artists. This week, we speak to Christina Quarles, one of the foremost figure of painters of her generation, whose work delves into the multifaceted dimensions of race, gender, sexuality, and queerness, offering a profound inquiry into the way these aspects intersect and define the individual experience of identity. Joining us also is Cherríe Moraga, the writer, teacher, and Chicano lesbian feminist pioneer. For over 40 years, she has been pivotal in making theorizing and advancing cultural productions by women of color.\n\nChristina, I want to start with you. You do paintings in which you have limbs and hands and bodies and faces that seem to be reaching through or coming up against planes, boundaries. What led you to begin to make this kind of work?\n\nChristina Quarles: I often will say that my work is portraiture, but I think of them as being portraits, really, of being within your body and looking out into the world, rather than portraits of the way that we think of traditional portraiture, which would be looking usually from the sort of shoulder to head perspective and this way of understanding the external sense of a person. And so, in my work, I’m really interested in exploring all the things that you couldn’t see really from a snapshot of a face and shoulder of a person.\n\nA lot of that comes from my own experience of living in a body that I find is oftentimes misread and misunderstood just from looking at them. I’m really interested in making that sort of internalized experience come through with something that is and of itself a very externalized process of painting and of working with the figure, working with these things that we’re used to really looking at, but using that as a way to explore looking from within.\n\nI think that you mentioned this idea of painting hands and feet and limbs, and that’s something that I oftentimes see in my work as being this clue to the fact that they’re portraits of being within your own body. I understand my sense of self through these limbs and these hands and these feet, and this really sort of fragmented bodily experience, which I think extends to this sort of fragmented sense of myself moving through the world just because it’s this whole world of people that seem like they’re these whole bodies that have this sort of singular outward facing personalities.\n\nIt’s worked to really try to find solidarity and representation in this sort of impossible state of fragmentation.\n\nJeff Chang: I want to probe into this question a little further of what you said about being in a body that’s always being misread. What do you mean by that?\n\nChristina Quarles: I mean, there’s a number of parts of my identity that I could point to, but for me, the earliest one was really coming to terms with my racial identity, because I have a Black father and white mother but I’m very fair-skinned. I think, especially to white people, I read as white because I think whiteness is not familiar with a spectrum of whiteness. Whereas in communities of color, there is more of an understanding of a lot of different forms that that takes, but so much of being a person of color in America is how you’re seen by white people.\n\nAnd so, as somebody that’s oftentimes seen as white by white people, that is something that has shaped my sense of self, but then also an awareness of being a person of color and awareness of these microaggressions that happen when people think that they’re in a room without any people of color. These are things that I am also hypersensitive to and hyper aware of.\n\nEven when I was a little kid on the playground, I mean, I grew up in LA and I feel like it was a common question for people to be like, “What are you? Where are you from?” There are a lot of first generation Americans at my elementary school. People would just be like, “Where are you from? Where’s your family from?” Whenever I would say, “My dad’s Black, my mom’s white,” it was always met with, “No, you’re not. You’re not half Black.” As a kid, I remember thinking, “But I am. How do I reconcile this?”\n\nThis was before I had read any theory or thought of myself as an artist or anything, but I just was a little kid trying to figure out what it was to have a Black father and a white mother and be met with so much resistance and so much the sense of you’re lying about that identity. That if you’re told that you’re a liar for something that you are, then how can you play with these confines of identity and of categorization and naming.\n\nAnd then also, for me, it’s really led too to this idea of what’s at stake when we’re asked to give up these categories or come up with categories that can be more inclusive or more fluid. Because something that I’ve come across again and again with this is this feeling of isolation that comes from not being fully a part of any one community and also being too many different things to really fully fit into that one category.\n\nIt is then led into other aspects of my identity, whether it’s queerness, whether it’s gender, identify as being cis, a cis woman. Now, the latest one has been motherhood, been a new one by myself, being both and either or. So yeah, I think it’s opened me up to this idea that there can be sort of this excess of identity categories, but the isolation and what’s at stake to really embrace that.\n\nJeff Chang: Okay, I want to bring Cherríe in here. Cherríe, in 1981, you and Gloria Anzaldúa edited a book called This Bridge Called My Back, which really became a foundational work for feminism centering women of color. It’s a book that continues to be read so widely. What do you think accounts for its endurance and its importance?\n\nCherríe Moraga: Well, my first response to that is always, unfortunately, and then also fortunately, but unfortunately it’s still news. I say unfortunately, because I feel like some of the history of the movement of where women of color were at that period of time, everything was just burgeoning out of the other movements, the Black power movement, Chicano El Movimiento, et cetera, and also feminism, also the queer movement. All of these things were just cooking. I mean, beautifully, beautiful. I was very lucky to come of age at that time.\n\nBridge was a response by women of color who refused to choose which movement was theirs, that claimed them all basically. Wherever we stood in relationship to those identities, and this was the pre the language of intersectionality, but it’s absolutely that. I always, of course, one always has to [inaudible 00:08:53] the Combahee River Collective for that idea that all systems of oppression are interlocking. That’s foundational.\n\nIt’s been very interesting for me to sort of watch over the years how the book has continued to be read, but it also went through a kind of lag time, but also it’s had a resurgence by SUNY Press, but it’s had a resurgence because the times require it much more intensely now than before. So, things just start to pick up again, and I’m very surprised that I’ve taught it now. Really, for the first time just a few years ago, I would never teach it. Those students were so hungry for it. It was like news to them. They all could say intersectionality, but nobody knew what it meant on a certain level, that there was still a level of taking things in academically.\n\nBut this was visceral. I mean, I think they were saying, “Why don’t we get to write this way anymore?” There’s something about embodied practice, the body that holds information. Without us having the language to talk about embodied practice in 1978, ’79 when we started working on it, that’s what theory in the flesh is, and that’s what we were doing. We wanted stories, we wanted letters, we wanted poems. We wanted the viscerality of what it means to be women of color and all those different shades and class systems and all of it.\n\nJeff Chang: Cherríe, when I mention the words the enlightenment notion of individualism, what comes up for you?\n\nCherríe Moraga: I wish the world had the privilege of being able to find that freedom of mind and heart, that it wasn’t exceptional to have those privileges, but it is. It’s exceptional to have the privilege of being, even as artists, just to be individual, let me say, because talking about the enlightenment. Because the first thing I think enlightenment, I said, well, I think that’s really been also for all its so-called freedom and individuality. I like that the end result of it to me is that this a western thought. Western thought is individualism, and that’s different than the specificity of who we are and our need to be as specific as possible so that we can then be so-called humanist. And in this, now, not even humanist, but the whole cosmology of.\n\nIt is a specificity of what we know goes back to the body, and that then means that it is class specific, race specific, all of those sites of the intersectionality that we understand ourselves. But that’s the road to trying to then get to something that we could consider universal. That’s what artists do. The idea of enlightenment, when you think about it as a movement, it was a movement for the privileged classes.\n\nJeff Chang: Christina, what comes up for you?\n\nChristina Quarles: There’s a lot of red flags that kind of go up for me when I hear things like the enlightenment or individualism. I love so much what you were saying about the idea of specificity because it’s something that I’ve come to gradually, in my practice, and it’s something that I do share with students when I speak with them who are trying to figure out their voice and their work, this idea of specificity.\n\nI think it’s such a beautiful way that you, Cherríe, were pointing out this distinction between the individual and the specificity, because I think that because of all those red flags that get pinked for me, and I think usually other people of color, other queer people, other people who turn their back to this western ideology, I think that there’s this idea that to be specific would perhaps alienate broader audience or be too opaque.\n\nBut I’ve actually found that it’s when we start to fall into this more general way of speaking that actually work becomes really inaccessible. It was only when I became really specific and really true to my experience, I was like, “Well, I don’t know if anyone’s going to understand this, but I’m just going to go ahead and go for it and try to be really specific about my experience.” That’s actually when it was the closest that I’ve been able to come to coming to this more universal way of communicating.\n\nCherríe Moraga: I was very moved by what I just saw so superficially and very quickly of your work, because I just thought it was dangerous, which I appreciate. Language is my form. I’m always in opposition with it almost. I’m always trying to find the real word as opposed to the rhetorical word. And so there’s also, I think, a corollary to this in visual work, of course. The irony is when you were talking about if you’re so specific, you don’t think anybody’s going to understand it, or that you worry that one worries, right?\n\nChristina Quarles: Yeah.\n\nCherríe Moraga: Of course, the opposite is true.\n\nChristina Quarles: You wrote that you wanted to proclaim aloud that theory can never wholly comprehend desire and that this is the work of poets. I thought that was just such a beautiful and precise way of saying what has run through my mind for ages and how I do feel like there is this sort of, like we’ve been saying, this visceral, this embodied practice that is in art, is in poetry, is in this lived experience that theory can never really fully grasp, but can never really fully handle.\n\nJeff Chang: Christina, I kind of wanted to ask, you had mentioned earlier, you’re talking about the different types of identities that you claim, but also people claim for you, and how you try to escape those through the act of painting. How does that show up in your process and also in the work that you produce?\n\nChristina Quarles: Yeah, I mean, I think that it’s interesting to work with… Well, it’s interesting to work with any medium, whether it’s writing or visual or movement or music or anything like that, because you’re working with something that is inherently legible, and part of its legibility comes from being a language that predates you and has all this baggage that comes along with it. One of the things I really like about working with painting and working with the figures, that it has so much baggage in so many ways that we are trained to see it. And so, I really try to play with some of those expected forms of legibility.\n\nI hope to include enough elements in the piece that can hook and engage a viewer to expand the duration of looking, and hopefully within that duration of looking, have other bits of information that come through that can contradict or undermine that initial read. It is what drew me to making art really was creating this sort of externalization of my experience that could be used to find language, to find solidarity, find community in something that can feel very lonely in a way.\n\nCherríe Moraga: I guess with the last word, lonely, what you just said, is where my mind was going. Because I wanted to ask you, do you feel you have suffered because of it?\n\nChristina Quarles: It’s interesting because it’s always both. I mean, I find that anything I answer usually has, it’s sort of inherent contradiction to it. I think that there’s a loneliness and a liberation in it because it is lonely, I think, to embrace that sort of specificity of self and to really try to continuously come out against the assumptions that people will place on you and sort of misreadings.\n\nI mean, I feel like my whole life is just constantly coming out as being gay, coming out as being a parent. And yet, it’s like I think that people that have to go through that process again and again, that constant having to restate who you are and have that statement also change and be recontextualize and shift as terminology changes. I mean, I didn’t grow up with the word queer being what it is today. I think that in making work and being a person that’s open to the realities of it, you can start to find community and find that camaraderie that comes from, again, that idea of specificity somehow miraculously being this much more potent version of idea of the universal, which is maybe just as western white as the individual.\n\nCherríe Moraga: Those contradictory places that you described, I really love that you said this really, that it’s how you’re seen by white people, which may say very little about yourself frankly. But by the same token, you have to walk in the world in the body and nobody, you didn’t ask the powers to be, please let me be the shade.\n\nBut yes, there’s incredible privilege in it. There’s no question about that. Even though in your little private self may hate it, or you maybe not hate it. I oftentimes really hate it. I really hate it sometimes because I’m not seeing the way I feel. That’s very painful for me, really. But at the same time, I go, “Oh, poor Cherríe, she can pass as a white person.”\n\nI’m not that dumb politically. I understand that that’s an enormous privilege in the sense that it also has saved my life and people’s lives around me. Those are the kind of very serious sort of contradictions we experience as we go through the day. You have one child?\n\nChristina Quarles: One child, yeah.\n\nCherríe Moraga: One child, yeah. You have a kid too. All of these questions about how you teach them the world is really challenging in that way, because we do suffer. But one suffers in the context of all these is, for lack of better word, again, all the structural suffering.\n\nChristina Quarles: Right, exactly.\n\nCherríe Moraga: Our bodies move in and out of it.\n\nJeff Chang: Christina, if I may, I wanted to point out for our audience that you and your wife just recently became mothers. I’m curious how being the non-biological mother plays into your sense of identity.\n\nChristina Quarles: It’s something that comes in and out of focus of being more important or less important. It’s something, I think, more than anything, it has less to do with my understanding of my relationship with my daughter and much more my understanding and relationship with my feminism and being a woman and working as a working mother, but as a working mother that didn’t have to contend with being pregnant, going through labor, having to breastfeed. But it’s an interesting thing to experience just the profound patriarchy, misogyny that’s inherent in childbearing, certainly in the United States, and to have been able to experience all the specificity of being a mother and yet not have had to deal with that sort of biological burden of being a new parent.\n\nIt’s been an interesting thing and one that has been far less alienating than I thought it would be going into it. I remember I had all these concerns before our daughter was born. Will she feel like she’s mine, or will I feel like this sort of outsider of our own family? As soon as she was born, it all just went away. It all just disappeared, all those concerns. I realized this thing that hadn’t occurred to me, which is that she would also just be an individual, that she was her own person, and that was something that my wife and I would both be part of and separate from always. That’s actually a very beautiful thing about children.\n\nJeff Chang: Cherríe wrote Waiting in the Wings, what, 25 years ago now, about becoming a queer mother at the age of 40. It’s a pioneering work. I guess I’m wondering, Cherríe, as you’re listening to Christina, what does this bring up for you? What kinds of memories and what kinds of differences maybe in your experiences does it bring up for you?\n\nCherríe Moraga: My experience was so different. I had my son biologically, and the book is actually very much impacted by… He was born very premature. I sometimes talk about the book and about my son at that time as being a kind of messenger, but in the sense that he was in the hospital three and a half months because he was born premature. Those three and a half months completely changed my life. The book actually also goes through that period, but it’s really the proximity of the creativity of giving birth and motherhood and all of that process, which was, to me, really wonderful until I almost lost him.\n\nAnd so then, to have the juxtaposition of death, the question of death, there was two surgeries, et cetera. He’s fine now. 30 years is fine, but that proximity changed my whole life. I left my relationship. She was great with him at that time, but I knew after that, I had to walk in the world with somebody who, and I say this in a really positive way, somebody who knew death. I needed someone who had my back that way because I am looking at it so straight up. This is your child. You could lose that child.\n\nTo me, I always say, in this book, my son actually wrote an endnote for it, which I was so surprised he was willing to do. When I read this afterward, I go, “Well, this book has nothing to do with him. It’s all about me.” It is, it’s all about me. It’s my queer motherhood. It was my motherhood, and the people that both my relationship to my blood family, but also the birth of queer mothering, making queer familia. So, the things that came after that book, like Chicano Codex, and then when my mother passed, Native Country of the Heart. Everything is about, to me, was kind of to announce its queer familia, our queer families, and how we make family, and how we walk in the world with that family.\n\nChristina Quarles: I really have found that one of the… Again, it’s that combination of something that’s painful and difficult, but also you get to make your own way. And there is a lot of agency in moving through a world that’s not designed to facilitate who you are. I think that that allows for you to find different pathways and actually make something that is really supportive for you that wouldn’t have happened if you just were moving along and going through the motions of living a life.\n\nI found that with our daughter, I mean, there were even things at the beginning, our decision when we were starting to realize that my wife probably would carry our child and my wife is white, and I’ve always felt this sense of isolation as a multiracial person, because there’s Black family members and white family members. And so, it was really important for us to have a mixed race child.\n\nAnd then, when our daughter was born, I mean, we’ve really been embracing this idea of a queer family unit with my wife and I and our daughter, but then we also have our friend who’s a gay man who’s pretty much moved in with us the moment that our daughter was born, because it was very difficult labor that my wife had and we really needed a lot of care. He’s a chef, and our daughter was born during the pandemic, so all of his chef gigs were canceled. It’s just interesting to experience this role of domestic labor being taken on by a gay man while I’m going into the office almost every day. My office is a studio, but still going into work all day and then having this male domestic partnership that’s a non-romantic, but very much a familial relationship. And so, it’s like you get to actually create a family unit that is genuinely supportive and one that can actually be caring, because it doesn’t have to be this cookie cutter.\n\nCherríe Moraga: Oh, very good.\n\nChristina Quarles: It can be one that actually has a sharing of responsibilities that we get to write our rules for what that is. It’s something that I find really meaningful to being a parent.\n\nJeff Chang: We’re living in a time of massive expansion in terms of the way that identities are perceived. Some have even said that we’re living in an age of identity, but at the same time, there’s a backlash against identity. What does it mean for the both of you as artists to be making works in this time?\n\nChristina Quarles: I think that there’s this great potential for having this ongoing draft of how we see ourselves, something that I see right now with this tendency to assert who we are and project that out. I mean, I think we were talking earlier in this conversation about how there’s this negotiation as artists that we have with our body, with our media, with the language that we have, and then what we’re trying to get across.\n\nIt’s always this negotiation, and I think that getting to know ourselves as well is this ongoing negotiation between who we are and the world around us and how that world continues to shift and change. I see now this… It’s almost this idea that you could somehow, because we have all of these different identity categories available to us, that we could just proclaim who we are and then that’s it. We could just have that be the end all, be all for all time. If you get it wrong, in 20 years, we’re going to go back and cancel that language. And it’s like language needs to be this sort of drafting and this idea of ourself. It’s like these earlier drafts that we move forward with.\n\nI think, right now, we’re in such this polarizing time of people being so afraid of language. Don’t say gay and don’t say intersectionality, don’t talk about critical race theory. It’s like all these things about not using language. And then on the other side, it’s this idea that if we were to somehow declare who we are, use enough descriptive language in our Instagram profile that somehow could be enough for all time.\n\nI think that the fear I have is that it’s too much of a battle between these two sides of sort of the same coin, which is that there needs to be this ongoing drafting of language and understanding of ourselves because we change, our world changes, the context changes, and we have to have that not be written in stone. It has to be something that could be written and rewritten and redrafted and crossed out and gone back to again and again,\n\nCherríe Moraga: Looking back 40 years, that’s some of the earliest writing was 40 years ago for Loving in the War years, and then how times have changed, et cetera. What I said in that intro part is that on a certain level, I was sad, because I felt like we were allowed to be braver then. I guess what I just want to say kind of clearly is just that I just feel like it is harder to write that way now because of the times and also because there is so much language that was supposed to be opening us, and in fact has turned so categorical that it’s just what you said early on, I’ll need to repeat it, that people do worry about being misinterpreted.\n\nEven if you look at Loving in the War Years, there are tons and tons of notes, like end notes, to contextualize the times. I even use the word Chicano with an O, because that’s what we said then. And when I mean Chicana, I mean a woman. It’s like trying to contextualize the times, because if you don’t contextualize the times correctly, it can be misinterpreted as wrong. Or you change it, and people don’t have a sense of the history. They don’t get the sense of the evolution of our ideas.\n\nIt’s important that I felt alienated from a Chicano movement as a queer person and as a female. [inaudible 00:30:41] in the relationship to trans and gender identities, things that I was very unaware of. I didn’t look back at being butch. I didn’t look at that necessarily as… I mean, I knew it was gender, but I thought after I came out, well, everything’s cool, but it was equally for me about gender and sexuality. But at that time, I didn’t have that language.\n\nWell, yes, that language has been enormously useful and not just for me, but in general. It’s been enormously useful. That’s what we’re doing. We’re in this evolutionary path, but we pick language up and let it go as it’s ceasing to function, but we got to keep having a historical perspective on it. I do worry now more than ever when I’m writing. I feel like I’m getting straighter. And I’m really not. I have to really work against it. I really, really work against it. But I’m telling you, it’s harder on a certain level because of that, also because we didn’t have social media in those times.\n\nJeff Chang: Before I let you go, both of you seem to be critical of this received idea of individualism. Christina, how do you want your daughter to experience individualism?\n\nChristina Quarles: I think it is this idea of a real genuine liberation, of real freedom, and this idea of compassion being something that is in the self but also has such an implication of another or set of others, and such a sense of care that a care that’s not careful. I think that that would be a place that I hope exists when she’s a teenager, when she’s a young adult and she’s doing whatever it is she’s finding interesting, finding passion in, would be that sense of tapping into a genuine sense of self, a genuine sort of rhythm that can be expressed and shared and felt by other people.\n\nI mean, that’s the thing when you can really tap into that, it’s something that is so specific but so connecting. It’s when you can find that, and it sometimes only lasts for a second, but it’s that moment that feels very joyful, because you feel like you’re being true to yourself, but also very much in conversation. I think tapping into that is something that I hope is picked up on in generations to come. I think every generation has that.\n\nI hope, I guess, that there’s time and space to have thoughtful connection because I think that in and of itself is a privilege that presumes a sense of safety and care and wellbeing in your life that can allow for these larger expanses of thinking. I guess, I hope that she’s in a world where needs are met, that she can have these contemplations.\n\nJeff Chang: Thank you both for being here.

Through natural catastrophe and human made atrocity, we have been called time and again to harness our energies toward action that will improve our lives individually and collectively. In time and again, we have despaired over our inability to progress. We have asked whether there is something in human nature that actually prevents us from truly moving forward. For some, progress is not determined by humans, but through appeals to God, or to higher forces. And for others, a faith and progress through human action, whether it be through politics or through culture is just naive. Progress has a lot of disbelievers. In this episode, we ask Artist, Thomas J Price, and Author, Steven Pinker, how we might think about progress now. Is progress available to all, or is it zero-sum?\n\nMust one group’s progress come at another’s expense? Who is allowed to progress and to represent progress and who’s not? And how do we even begin to measure progress? Is it just a goal that keeps on moving? Welcome to Edge of Reason, a new limited series podcast produced by Atlantic Re:think, the Atlantic’s branded content studio in partnership with Hauser & Wirth, a home to visionary, modern and temporary artists. Each week, we transcend the boundaries of time and thought, channeling the spirit of the Enlightenment to delve into the obsessions that underpin the work of some of today’s leading artists.\n\nThis week, we’re speaking with Thomas J Price, a trailblazing British artist, born and raised in Southeast London, whose works transcend from capturing societal perceptions and challenging our views on Black identity while offering a unique lens to view the complexities of today’s world. And also joining us is Steven Pinker, the author of the 2018 book, Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, and a psychology professor at Harvard University, where he conducts research in visual cognition, psycholinguistics and social relations.\n\nThomas, I want to start with you. You’re known for making these beautiful monumental sculptures of Black people, some of which are nine, 12 feet tall, and then you make these oversized busts and you put them on pedestals. I’m curious, what caused you to work in such a large scale way, and how did people react when they first saw them?\n\nThomas J Price: It was quite a long process to get to the figuration. I began my inquiry throughout my practice looking a lot more at, I guess, what would be known as abstract works, video works, works we looked at patterns of lights and sound and basically, the internal, so they’re trying to get inside the minds of people and trying to recreate the sensory experiences that I was experiencing and seeing if I could place those in front of people and see if they could actually feel the same thing, see if I could recreate that sensation in someone else.\n\nAnd it wasn’t until I had done a few of these that I started to look at the visual side in terms of the external elements. So what happens if we use a representation of a person? So trying to use something which looked very familiar, either a person, a face, and use that as a strategy, ultimately, to directly connect people to what was in front of them, that I was placing in front of them, and trying to get them to ask questions, because everybody feels able to say something about or to comment upon what somebody looks like.\n\nAnd this was running in tandem with my own experiences that every time I’d show work, the identity of the artist and my identity was placed on top of that work, and so race became a part when I started to show actual figures, the first figures being whites and all the conversation was about their mental state. And as soon as I sculpted and presented an animation of a Black individual, the conversation became about race. And so as a young student, that was something that I had to take on board as quickly as I could, to be honest. It took me a little while, but that’s when I realized I was running a parallel conversation, one which talked very much about at the core of it, what it means to be human. And the other part was what does it mean to be human and have to deal with other people’s limitations, expectations placed on you based on what you look like.\n\nSteven Pinker: We should specify to our listeners who can’t see you, that you’re biracial. Were you surprised that people were viewing the sculptures that you were making in terms of race?\n\nThomas J Price: I think I was blissfully naive in terms of the art world at that point. I was showing the bounty of the experiments I’ve been taking place, I’ve been carrying out, all these experiments in terms of physionomy, the proportions of a face, what happens if you shift the angles of eyes? What happens if you adjust the curve of a mouth or the placement of ears, the size of a forehead? All these kinds of things that were connected to the pseudoscience in terms of these things that were entrenched in our thinking, I believe, as people. You know what someone’s like character-wise based on what they look like.\n\nSteven Pinker: These characters were actually fictional characters. They weren’t necessarily taken from life.\n\nThomas J Price: That’s right. So I was using these fictionalized or physionomy experiments, these propositions as to character ultimately, and trying to prompt and test audiences. And so for me, it wasn’t about race at all at that point. It wasn’t until I showed the first animation of a Black man that race became visible. And so I want to use a fictional person to try and generate or create a real sense of a human moment of thinking and presence. And then when I went larger with the scale, to nine feet and now 12 feet tall, it was really about, again, a duality of the psychological impact of that scale on the viewer, the negotiation of that relationship between the represented individual and the viewers’ sense of themselves, and how scale, when it comes to that physical manifestation, that physical presence, it flavors or it puts into context all the other visual information you have in terms of expression, pose.\n\nJeff Chang: Now, of course, your work is being seen in this very fractious context. Since 2020, we’ve seen calls to remove confederate statues here in the US. And in England, there’s been a movement to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes under the Rhodes Must Fall movement. But I wanted to come back to this idea, you decided not to put your figures on horseback, like pointing a sword at somebody. They’re at rest, or they’re in thought, or they’re putting on their hoodies, or they’re just staring at a phone.\n\nThomas J Price: I didn’t want my sculptures to just be another version of what we’ve already seen. So they’re not about, now we too can be just as powerful as these men from history. It’s about, let’s actually not take for granted all these statues, all these monuments of so-called powerful men from history. Let’s actually look at what they’re doing and why they’re there and actually wake up to them because they’re all around us, and we reinforce their legitimacy by not saying anything. I think it’s very interesting that a lot have been pulled down or there’s conversations about them now. I’ve been doing this for 20 something years, but for a long time, there was… We wanted.\n\nPART 1 OF 4 ENDS\n\nThomas J Price: 20 something years. But for a long time we wanted to be up there. We wanted to be on the plinth. And my figures, the large figures stand on the ground because they share the ground with us. So as I say, one of the works is called reaching out. The artistic concept is about reaching out to the audience, reaching out to the viewer, as opposed to yeah, kind of creating something which looks out over them and says, you’re not as good as me.\n\nJeff Chang: Okay, so let’s get Steven Pinker in here now. Steven, you’re an expert in cognitive science and cognitive psychology, and you are driven to answer the same kinds of questions that Thomas is pursuing in his work. You’ve written a book called Enlightenment Now, and it speaks to the question of progress and human nature. How did you come to be so invested in these ideas?\n\nSteven Pinker: The enlightenment thinkers were themselves, amateur cognitive psychologists woven into their political philosophy and their moral philosophy were assumptions about what makes people tick. And I’m a person who believes that there’s such a thing as human nature. I don’t think we’re blank slates that are just written on by the environment and parents and culture. I think that we come into the world with certain motives, certain learning styles, certain ways of conceptualizing the world. And I always had to deal with the squeamishness that many people felt about the very idea of human nature, that maybe it confines us to the status quo. You can’t change human nature. And so that there may be a reactionary coloring to the idea of human nature. And I think a lot of the pushback against specific theories in linguistics and cognitive psychology and evolutionary psychology comes from people’s fear that, oh, you’re saying that there’s no point in trying to make us better off because war is in our genes and so we’ll always have war and so on.\n\nSo I have pushed back against that pushback, first of all by saying that human nature is a complex system. There’s a lot going on inside the skull. And yeah, I think we do have some rather ugly motives, but we also have better angels as Abraham Lincoln put it, better angels of our nature. We also have a capacity for empathy. We have a capacity for self-control, delayed gratification. We have a capacity for reason, cognitive processes that allow us to try to solve problems. And so yeah, we’ve got human nature is the problem. Human nature is also the solution because we have these faculties of reason and empathy and self-control that can, if the culture promotes them, can push back against our inner demons and all the forces of nature that are trying to grind us down.\n\nNow, that’s a theory, that’s a reason why progress could happen, why a progressive agenda and a belief in human nature are perfectly harmonious. But the question is, can it work? Has it happened? And so in order to flesh out the idea, I had to say not only is there scoping human nature for progress, but it’s actually taken place. Indeed, in just about every measure of human wellbeing, there has been progress since the enlightenment. We live more than twice as long. A majority of people are literate, used to be a luxury of an elite. We’re less likely to get killed or injured in street crime. We have concepts that would’ve been almost inconceivable a couple of centuries ago, like universal human rights for all races, for both sexes, for all religions. Fewer of us starve to death. Fewer women die in childbirth, more children survive childhood.\n\nSo no matter how you look at it, we really are better off than we were 300 years ago. How come? It’s certainly not the case that the universe is trying to make us better off. Quite the contrary, the forces of nature try to crush us. And given an unforgiving universe, how did we manage to double our lifespan? Well, it’s because we applied ingenuity to the goal of improving lifespan. We invented antibiotics and sanitation and synthetic fertilizers so we could grow more food and many other innovations that have given us the gift of extra life and extra prosperity and extra safety. That’s I suggest a gift of the enlightenment.\n\nJeff Chang: Thomas, we’ve heard Steven discuss his idea of progress. How would you define progress?\n\nThomas J Price: Ooh. I think progress for me is more of a feeling than anything. I think it’s kind of an everyday experience because if you zoom out from numbers, it depends on the sample group or where these statistics a"
