The HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER finale will be followed immediately by the series premiere of the new comedy FRIENDS WITH BETTER LIVES (9:00-9:30 PM, ET/PT). Following its special premiere after the HIMYM finale, FRIENDS WITH BETTER LIVES moves to its regular Monday (8:30-9:00 PM, ET/PT) time period on April 7. FRIENDS WITH BETTER LIVES is about six friends at different stages in their lives - married, divorced, newly engaged and single - who are outwardly happy, but secretly questioning if their friends have it better. As part of CBS's new Monday lineup, 2 BROKE GIRLS will move to the 8:00 PM time period on April 14 to lead off the night's comedy block."
