        "text": "Here comes the Blog!! Here comes the Blog!!\n\nSince my Raider’s won a game yesterday (take that The Fightin’ Favres), I’ll do this Monday Morning Quarterback Style (thank you Peter King).\n\nWedding episodes are always interesting. We have had three of them prior to this (the two-part Season Two finale and the vastly underrated, elope-athon in Atlantic City). Actually no, I was wrong, we have had five, with the Claudia and Stuart two-parter. So this was the sixth. That may be too much in just 69 episodes (69 episodes, coincidence, I think not), but I disagree. This was the best, and most interesting; however, I will not ever have my wedding in a Yoga Collective. I guess I will not ever invite an ex to my wedding, either. That means you, Lucy Williams!! Anyway, let’s go to the episode.\n\nWell, I was right. Although not that any of you care. Stella is not the mother. For me, I am glad. I never really liked the character of Stella, or Sarah Chalke. To me, she never had great chemistry in the cast. Also, Stella was a bitch for playing Ted like that. That was horrific. It was great to see Ted get the axe for once, instead of the other way around. So far, Ted has been the one to severe the ties in a relationship. This time it was Stella. That, other than being a nice change of pace, opens up a lot of areas which the creators can explore. It is a safe assumption that Ted will go into a Marshall-during-the-breakup-like depression. It will really be interesting to see if they take that direction. The whole “Don’t invite exes” plotline was done very well. It was a great switch there at the end, really impressive for a comedy. I absolutely did NOT see that coming. Great job by the show.\n\nThe rest of the show was great too. I wish Marshall and Lily would get more play, and by reading spoilers, they will later in the season, but they had nice little line. It looks like Lily is still Barney’s confidante in the whole “I want to bone Robin” ordeal. I for one, would stop trying to get Robin, and try to get Lily, who probably “shags like a minx,” but that is probably a bigger no-no in the Bro Code (get the Bro Code book). Barney’s bits were great. He was hilatious in trying to repress the temptation to get with Nora, who, as she said, “is a yoga instructor, and every position is available.” I’m confused about the ending. Looks like he definitely rode the tricycle (maybe a belt sighting… that’s not to much to ask), but is he really wavering on being in love with Robin again, even after going through what looked like Integrals and Linear Physics to brew up a gameplan. We’ll have to see.\n\nOverall, a solid, solid episode. This ended the first run of the season, and they said that they would resolve the prevailing issues. It looks like Barney and Robin will be a long, off-and-on again issue though. Can’t wait for the more humorous stand-alones to come.\n\nJoke of the Week\n\n“You can’t invite a failed relationship to celebrate your succesful one. It’s like inviting the Seattle Mariners to a world series game, which is just awkward for everyone” – Marshall (I’m just glad they didn’t use the Rays – and yes that is just to opke fun at Boston again)\n\nRunner-Up Joke of the Week\n\nI’m adding this just because it may have been the best Barney-ism yet.\n\n“They have drinks here that actually make girls smarter,” – Barney. That is Comedy\n\nEnjoyable/Aggravating Aly Hannigan Fashion Note of the Week\n\nThere is nothing, nothing that is aggravating about Aly Hannigan and her look this year. She has truly bought her a-game (thank goe she didn’t bring her bangs-game). She was really cute in her outfits. What I love is that, in many of them, they are simpler and more mature, but still hot. It reflects her new need to save cash, which was amplified by the difference in outfits in the wedding flashback.\n\n5 Things I Think I Think (Quick Hit Version)\n\nThis really isn’t important, but it bothered me. Where the hell is Shelter Island supposed to be. I mean, they needed to take what looked like a New England style boat, with coats needed, to reach a tropical yoga collective (btw, what is that supposed to mean)?? Really, where is this supposed hot spring in Connecticut, I want to know. I’ll make a visit.\n\nI loved the play on the vegan lines. Ted’s “You aren’t strong enough becuase you lack protein” and Nora’s “I’ve been a vegan for five years. I need some meat” lines were number three and four in my joke of the week department.\n\nAnother vegan-ish note (if you haven’t guessed, I like me a brisket): Who has a non-alcohol, non-meat wedding. My family just wouldn’t show up if I had one. If there is another good reason for this episode, I have learned alot about what NOT to do in a wedding.\n\nWhat is up with that Japanese Channel. There were some funny bits, like the Chimp throwing eggs, but it was just weird. The graphics were great, and it looked great, but, as I said, it was just weird. What was the whole fan for?? That just seemed totally out of place. I’m happy Robin’s back. Dealing with Tokyo Ichi, or whatever it was called, would be a pain.\n\nThis was the quintessential How I Met Your Mother episode. It was funny, it had soap operatic moments. A great twist ending. Barney being Barney. And even some great recall, like Zitchdog. God bless this show. This is why I love it.\n\nWho I Like Next Week, and I Don’t Mean Alyson Hannigan\n\nWell, next week I like a Robin Sparkles sighting. Actually, it’s a rerun of Sandcastles in the Sand. The week after that, I like them to be at a restaurant. See you then!"
