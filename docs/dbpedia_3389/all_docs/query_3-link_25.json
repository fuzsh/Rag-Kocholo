        "text": "April 21, 2021\n\nAs many of you already know, I’m a Jersey Girl. Because I am certainly my father’s daughter, I’ve been known to enjoy some time in Atlantic City, dubbed “America’s Playground” and “Monopoly City.” So when our dance competitions or conventions are held there, I know the general lay of the land. This is especially true when the event is held at Harrah’s, which is the casino I frequent the most (although hardly ever anymore, thanks to those pesky dance bills).\n\nWe’ve been attending Starpower Nationals at Harrah’s in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for several years. Back in 2015, the resort opened its 100,000 square-foot Waterfront Conference Center, boasting two floors and space enough for about 60 smaller ballrooms (for larger events, they’re combined to make bigger spaces). The center is adjacent to the resort hotel, which makes it a good fit for dance competitions and conventions.\n\nBut as is the case with all venues, there are pros and cons associated with attending a dance event here. Below, I give my unbiased, unvarnished opinion of our experiences with both competitions and conventions; while Harrah’s has a special place in my heart (it was the last casino my father visited, and I sit at his favorite slot for a few minutes each time I go), there are areas that could be greatly improved.\n\nUPDATES FOR 2024\n\nWe attended Starpower Nationals in June of 2024, and found two new additions!\n\n**Buddy’s Boardwalk Empire – If you’re wondering if this is related to Buddy Valastro (of Cake Boss fame), you’re right! This eatery is located near the lobby and offers pizza, sandwiches, pastries, and more. Since it’s so new, I decided to forgive them for that time when they ran out of pizza (before dinnertime, no less). But the pastries made up for it! They taste way better than any dessert I’ve ever gotten from Tazza, the 24-hour cafe, but Buddy’s place has much more limited hours.\n\n**The Arcade – If you’ve got some younger kids looking to kill time, take a look at the brand new arcade! With an assortment of games (including claw machines and a photo booth outside the doors), it’s located right next to Bobby’s Burgers and across from Starbucks, Pin-Up Pizza, and Guy Fieri’s Chicken Guy.\n\nBack to the Essentials – The Waterfront Conference Center\n\nThe glass doors to the conference center can be accessed from the resort, right near the Coastal Craft Kitchen and Bar restaurant. The center has two floors; the Wildwood ballrooms are on the first floor, and the Avalon ballrooms are upstairs. Individual rooms are combined to form larger dressing rooms and stage areas, which is what you would typically expect. Bathrooms are available on both ends of the center, and on both floors.\n\nBack in the block scheduling days of 2021, my girls had just three numbers to change from their solo costumes to their duo costumes during one competition. We literally had to RUN from the stage to our dressing room and back to make it in time, which I was not a happy camper about (all three routines are very cardio-intensive, so dealing with the long distance frustrated me). The restrooms were no closer, so changing in a stall was not an option. My girls were winded by the time they took the stage for their duo. While I can’t say for sure that it affected their performance, I knew their mental game was thrown off a bit.\n\nIf your event is on the second floor, you’ll need to walk the entire length of the convention center to access the elevators or escalator. When I wasn’t in a rush, I didn’t mind this (and my FitBit was ALL about it). But there were times that I just wanted to get to my destination without making such a hefty trek.\n\nAll in all, the center is generally clean and fairly new. So far, the events we’ve attended have all been diligent in providing signs and labeling the rooms so you know where to go. The layout is easy to navigate; just be prepared to hoof it from the self-park garage to the center. Other parents tell me that they parked in the lot behind the center itself, but I can’t say for certain whether you’ll be able to get in (the doors to the outside are typically locked, and there is often a chain that stops cars from entering the parking lot). I’ve noticed that they usually station an attendant when there are multiple events happening, so you might not be able to score a spot.\n\nThe Rooms\n\nAround 2021, Harrah’s renovated two of their oldest towers (which were in SERIOUS need of upgrading). Formerly the Harbor and Marina Towers, they have been renamed the Coastal and Laguna Towers (respectively). The Coastal Tower room we stayed in featured two queen beds, plenty of space, and was invitingly bright and clean. I have to say, I was impressed. The downside was that it was the furthest tower from the Waterfront Conference Center, so it was quite a walk to get to our destination.\n\nIf you’re looking for the closest tower to the center, book a room in the Waterfront. It’s been some time since I had a room in this tower, but I learned that they have been renovated within the past couple of years. There was a separate “room” for the commode (ahem…), which is helpful when multiple people are sharing the joint.\n\nThe Bayview Tower is adjacent to the Waterfront Tower; they even share a bank of elevators for the lower floors of the Waterfront. The Laguna Tower is between the Bayview and the Coastal. We haven’t stayed there yet, but I’ve heard great things.\n\nTypically, I check in virtually through the link sent to my email before my arrival. When we get there, we use the kiosks in the lobby to check in. This is a huge timesaver, so we are able to get to our room in short order. Be sure to check both sides of the rows of kiosks; several people have stood around waiting on the more visible side for an available machine when there were several kiosks on the other side that were not being used. A few of them were out of service, unfortunately. You can print your keys directly from the machine.\n\nThe downside of using the kiosks, though, is that you won’t receive a paper jacket with additional information (like the QR code to order takeout from participating restaurants on the property). You can find large standing signs sprinkled around that display that day’s restaurant info (which ones are open, and what hours).\n\nIf you want housekeeping, you might need to jump through some hoops to make it happen. A few years ago, I used the Ivy text message service (take a look at the signs during near the check-in counter, and the info in your check-in email) to request it, but kept getting a message that said “our services are limited.” I requested that the dirty towels be picked up and new towels provided, but they only delivered the new. I was on hold with housekeeping for about 20 minutes before I actually spoke to someone. They told me to leave the dirty towels and trash in the hall to be picked up (ew).\n\nAs you can imagine, the rates for weekend nights (Friday and Saturday) can be pretty steep. Check with your event to see if they’re offering a discount code before you book through Harrah’s. If you’re a Caesar’s Total Rewards member, you might also be eligible for a discount (just have your card or number handy when you make the reservation).\n\nThe Food\n\nQuite honestly, this is the area Harrah’s needs to work on the most when preparing to host dance competitions and conventions. While I expected some roadblocks to finding food (with actual food in it) for my girls with COVID protocols in place, the organizers really should up their game and consider the needs of families when they’re in the planning stages.\n\nOccasionally, the powers that be have the foresight to place some grab-and-go stations in the conference center itself. Turkey club sandwiches, chicken Caesar salads, and chicken finger platters with French fries were typical lunch fare for these little pop-ups. Breakfast offerings included cereal, bagels, and premade egg sandwiches (along with coffee, thank the Maker). Unfortunately, these stations are not always up and running. I began relying on them less and less because of how inconsistently they were open.\n\nThe nearest restaurant to the Waterfront Conference Center is Coastal Craft Kitchen and Bar. Soups, salads, sandwiches, and breakfast items are on the menu; with some modifications, you can probably find something to satisfy even your pickiest little eaters. If you’re looking to dine in, the hours are very limited (they do offer room delivery at times). The line for dine-in can grow quite long during peak times; I’ve waited over an hour on more than one occasion.\n\nFor lunches and dinners, a sit-down option for families is the A. C. Burger Company (located past the Coastal Tower). Try the milkshakes if you do go; they’re absolutely delicious. My girls LOVED the pulled pork sandwich; the aroma itself was mouthwatering. Again, the wait can be ridiculous, so takeout might be the better option (or try to score a reservation if you can).\n\nThere are two counter service restaurants sandwiched (ha!) together, fairly near the conference center. One is Pin Up Pizza, and the other is the newer Chicken Guy by Guy Fieri. My girls loved the macaroni and cheese (with chicken) bowl, but they couldn’t finish it (even with both of them chowing down). Pin Up Pizza has some Italian food, but Jocelyn likes the white pizza and mozzarella sticks. My major complaint about these two places? The EXTREMELY limited hours! I was looking to grab an early lunch at about 11:30 a.m. on Saturday, and they weren’t even open yet. And it was frustrating that Chicken Guy was closed Monday and Tuesday, and Pin Up Pizza was closed Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nRight across the way is the new-ish Bobby’s Burgers by Bobby Flay. In addition to cheeseburgers, French fries, onion rings, and to-die-for milkshakes, they offer a breakfast menu from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. This counter service restaurant took the place of the old Waterfront Buffet, so there was plenty of real estate to work with. They’ve set up a ton of tables and chairs, so we always found somewhere to sit and crash for awhile.\n\nThe 24-hour coffee, sandwich, pastry, and goody shop, Tazza, is a reliable eatery. Not only did they have coffee (YES), but they had hot breakfast sandwiches, muffins, danishes, premade salads, and a variety of lunch sandwiches. The biggest draw here, however, seems to be the homemade gelato! My girls never leave Harrah’s without having at least one serving of it.\n\nAdditionally, there is a Starbucks (with limited hours, an eternally long line, and issues with short-staffing), La Strada (an Italian restaurant, formerly Martorano’s), Gordon Ramsey’s Steakhouse (I don’t need to explain that one, do I?), and McCormick and Schmidt (a more upscale seafood restaurant).\n\nEach restaurant had its pros and cons; check ahead to see which ones are currently offering takeout. For more information on these restaurants, click here.\n\nAll the hotel rooms should come equipped with a refrigerator, so feel free to bring some additional food to supplement your meals. You’ll definitely want to pack your own water bottles and drinks when possible; you’ll be shelling out some serious dough if you buy these items on the premises.\n\nThe Amenities\n\nIn the past, we did try the family pool and the experience was downright disappointing. The water was filthy, and my girls got out within three minutes (true story). In the fun center, about a third of the arcade games and other machines were out of service. My hope is that, going forward, the property will invest some resources into those areas to provide more diversions for families.\n\nHarrah’s famous indoor pool is definitely one of its more popular attractions – chill out on your days off and relax with a drink, and enjoy the nightlife when the sun goes down. But be aware that you need to be 21 in order to enter, and there is a fee (the last I saw, it was $20 for hotel guests and $30 for everyone else).\n\nThe Fitness Center is located just outside the Waterfront Conference Center. A spa opened a few years ago, so take some time to pamper yourself if your schedule allows.\n\nBefore You Go\n\nDo yourself a favor and plan your meals ahead of time so you can make whatever reservations you can manage to score. This will also help you to decide what food and drinks to bring along with you, and be sure to bring an ample bag to put it all in). During meal breaks, our kids ate their food in the ballroom during the convention; be sure to pack or grab napkins, plastic utensils, and plates, and include a plastic bag so they can gather their trash.\n\nAlso, bring fully charged external batteries for your devices; for whatever reason, my cell phone battery drained faster than my bank account (perhaps because the service was so spotty). Ordinarily, I would just chalk it up to my phone’s age, but I heard the same remark from countless people.\n\nIf you’re camping out in the hallway while your dancer is in a convention class, bring a blanket to claim your territory. A cushion wouldn’t hurt either (your rump will thank you).\n\nDo Your Homework\n\nJust like anything else, you should do your homework before you travel anywhere with kids. Reach out to dance families from other studios (Facebook groups are great for this) to get your questions answered and for honest feedback about any unfamiliar venue, including Harrah’s.\n\nIn June 2024, a bellman accidentally wrecked one of our trophies when they were transporting it after checkout for another one of our team’s families. The supervisor denied it was his responsibility, which resulted in a very heated argument between him and the dance mom. Incredibly, the supervisor KICKED the dance mom’s car in frustration! As much as we may hope that it was an isolated incident, we just can’t be certain. Use discretion when deciding whether or not to use bell services.\n\nWork hard, have fun! – Danielle\n\nIn August of 2020, we competed at Starpower’s Battle Under the Big Top event, held under a large tent in Harrah’s parking lot! Read all about it in The Greatest Show."
