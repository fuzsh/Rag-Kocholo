Meanwhile, Lily was sick of Marshall's annoying expecting dad habits so she packed him off to Atlantic City with Barney. However, while they were out knocking back the booze, she went into labor and Marshall had ... turned his phone off.

The two-part "How I Met Your Mother" Season 7 Finale airs Monday, May 14 at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.
