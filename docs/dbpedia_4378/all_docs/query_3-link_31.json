        "text": "John Taylor Hamilton was born at the Moravian mission station of Lebanon, on the Island of Antigua to Rev. Alan Hamilton (b. 1814 in Glasgow, Scotland; d. 1885 in Salem, NC) and Jane Taylor (b. 1823 in Newfield, d. 1863 in Nisky/St. Thomas). Hamilton attended the Moravian Boys' School in Fulneck, England, and he subsequently attended Moravian College and Theological Seminary in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the college in 1875 and from the seminary in 1877. Between 1877 and 1881, he taught at Nazareth Hall Military Academy. In 1881 Hamilton was ordained as a deacon. Following his ordination, he became pastor of the Second Moravian Church in Philadelphia where he served until 1886. He was consecrated as presbyter in 1883 and became associate editor of \"The Moravian\" the following year. He married Cecilia Elizabeth Beck in 1886. From 1886 until 1903, Hamilton served as Resident Professor of Moravian College and Theological Seminary. In 1889 Hamilton was a delegate from the Northern Province to the General Synod of the Unitas Fratrum held in Herrnhut, Germany. Hamilton was also named editor of \"The Moravian\" in 1897 and held this position until 1899. In 1898 he was elected a member of the Provincial Elders' Conference of the Northern Province, serving on the board until 1903. In 1903 he was elected as the American representative on the General or International Mission Board of the Moravian Church. For this post he had to move to Herrnhut, Germany, where he lived with his family until 1916. During this period he was consecrated a bishop of the Unity in 1905. For his position at the General Mission Board, Hamilton made several trips and official visits to Moravian missions in Alaska, the West Indies, Nicaragua, Dutch Guyana (Suriname), East Central Africa and the Indian Mission in California. Two years after his return from Germany, Hamilton was elected president of Moravian College and Theological Seminary (1918). He held this position until 1928 when he was elected president emeritus. He continued teaching until 1937 when he retired. Hamilton authored several works, including: \"The History of the Moravian Church in the USA,\" \"The History of Moravian Missions,\" and \"Twenty Years of Pioneer Missions in Nyasaland.\" Hamilton's most famous works were his book, \"The History of the Moravian Church during the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\" and the compilation, \"The Offices of Worship and Hymns,\" the most complete collection of Moravian hymns ever published in the English language. Hamilton's wife passed away on May 4, 1944, and he died on January 29, 1951 at the age of 91. He had three children: Constance B. Martin, Arthur B. Hamilton, and Kenneth G. Hamilton. 3 boxes This collection contains J.Taylor Hamilton's correspondence, notes, speeches and addresses, written reports, articles about missions and other documentation concerning Moravian missions."
