By dawn it was clear the cruiser was sinking and Engadine came alongside and, in a difficult operation with a sea running, took off the ship’s company. ‘We cut adrift from the old Warrior,’ wrote Flight Commander Graham Donald, one of the seaplane pilots in HMS Engadine, ‘and saluted her as she disappeared astern of us, with her funnels hanging over the side, her 91/5in guns pointing skywards, and her White Ensign gallantly fluttering in the morning sun.’\n\nJust before the two ships parted, the ship’s padre, the Rev. Edward Robert Bredin, ran below to his wrecked cabin and rescued a three-piece silver communion set, which the Admiralty subsequently allowed him to retain. He presented the holy vessels to the next ship of the name in the Royal Navy, the aircraft carrier HMS Warrior, and they were later passed on to the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief Fleet at Northwood in Middlesex, which has been commissioned as HMS Warrior.”\n\nhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sQSTAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT369&lpg=PT369&dq=Edward+Robert+Bredin+Royal+Navy&source=bl&ots=nkfX0_4i8n&sig=ACfU3U0rsXrh3lt93k7QscwptoCYnQU37Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjetLqC_6zqAhWRTsAKHdluD7QQ6AEwC3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=Edward Robert Bredin Royal Navy&f=false\n\nBriggs, William Arthur\n\nSt Johns College, Cambridge has the Rev W.A.

Essex. Chaplain William Dudley Clements, B.A. September 1914 Monthly Navy List.\n\nFrom “The Living Church. Volume 105. Page 8 December 13, 1942”\n\n“The Rev. Dom Bernard Clents, OSB, vicar of All Saints, Margaret Street, London, who died on September 13th, leaves many monuments to his tireless work for God and for human souls.\n\nBorn William Dudley Clements in 1882 near Osborne, Isle of Wight, he studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, and at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge University. Against strong parental opposition he decided to take Holy Orders, and was ordained priest in 1909, taking his title as curate under Fr. Aidan Hancock, at St. Peter’s, Muswell Hill.\n\nShortly before the beginning of the first world war he became Chaplain in the Royal Navy, serving on HMS Essex and HMS Colossus. So successful was he in this duty that he was advanced to the Chaplaincy of the Royal Training Ship Mercury, where he remained until after the conclusion of the war. He then moved to the vicarate of the Church of St. Michael and All Angels, at Portsmouth. His parish house and vicarage became the regular port-of-call for sailors on shore leave and for the dock workers of Portsmouth. It was under Dom Bernard that this parish acquired that reputation among the sailors and shipping men as a place of heartiest welcome that it has ever since enjoyed.\n\nHowever there existed in the heart of the young vicar the conviction that our Lord wished him to leave all for the love of Christ. So he sought and found entrance to the Benedictine community, in the pioneer stages, at Pershore. There he was professed in 1921. In 1923 he was appointed prior of the community. When the order decided to inaugurate mission work on the Gold Coast of Africa, Dom Bernard was sent out as the first prior. By the Bishop of Accra he was also commissioned to set up the work of St. Augustine’s College for the training of native clergy. Perhaps, of all the works which Dom Bernard carried out so successfully in his full life, this was the one nearest to his heart, and that which he considered his greatest achievement.\n\nIn 1928 he was recalled to the home Abbey, and from then until 1934 he garnered fresh praise and recognition for himself and for the order, as a director of souls, retreat conductor, and preacher. It was no surprise therefore that the Bishop of London, in whose gift was All Saints Church, Margaret Street, entreated the community for the loan of Dom Bernard to become vicar of that important parish, in succession to Father Mackay. The community reluctantly relinquished him for a period of five years, which was subsequently extended another five years. As vicar Dom Bernard accomplished the work of reorganization and entrenchment in the changing times. He became a regular preacher for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and was in its inner council of advisers on policy and morale.\n\nAmong his published works were: Philip cometh to Andrew, Members of Christ, The Royal Banners, The Precepts of the Church, When Ye Pray and Learning to be a Christian.\n\nDom Bernard made few enemies and never lost a friend. He maintained contact with his students from Kumasi, his “boys” (many of them later high-ranking officers), of the Royal Navy. As preacher, writer and director of souls, he had the gift of simple utterance, enforcing his teaching by homely and trenchant illustration. A man large in size, he was equally large in heart and mind. His public ministry was outstanding; his inner life more than equalled it. A great priest, who in his days pleased God.”\n\nhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QHLkAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA24-PA8&lpg=RA24-PA8&dq=William+Dudley+Clements+Royal+Navy&source=bl&ots=lyPpnPE6ZG&sig=ACfU3U12ihdfWk8EcX1IFeTcApi4KmPgng&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjj5770oK_qAhWDi1wKHYdyCqwQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=William Dudley Clements Royal Navy&f=false\n\nA slightly different biography of him appears in “The Dambuster who Cracked the Dam: The Story of Melvin ‘Dinghy’ Young” by Arthur G. Thorning– it looks like the Reverend Clements reawakened the Catholic Faith in the young Melvin Young.\n\n“William Dudley Clements (1880-1942) was vicar at All Saints from 1934 until his death from appendicitis in 1942. He was a big man, both physically – well over six feet tall and weighing over 20 stones, 280lbs – and in personality; in his earlier years he was, by his own admission, forthright and sometimes irascible. Educated at Pembroke College , Cambridge and Trinity College Dublin, he worked for a few years as a school teacher before ordination as a priest in the Church of England in 1909. In 1911 he became a chaplain in the Royal Navy, and harangued the Admiralty to encourage more active religious observance by the sailors; the admirals were unmoved. After a period as chaplain of a training ship and as vicar at Portsea, in 1921 he took monastic vows, adopting the name Bernard, and joined the small Benedictine house at Pershore.” (There is more on his later life at the same source)\n\nhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IgXMDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT91&lpg=PT91&dq=William+Dudley+Clements+Royal+Navy&source=bl&ots=sdaXxZyS3c&sig=ACfU3U0RAQmE_jVfLSfRtVg54IIAC-WJrg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjj5770oK_qAhWDi1wKHYdyCqwQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=William Dudley Clements Royal Navy&f=false\n\nCollier, George Henry\n\nAboard H.M.S.

A small number of individuals are named in the album: Lieutenants Brisley and Duff, Dr Wolferstein and Pat O'Mara. Finally, there is a single photograph taken in the trenches at ANZAC showing an Australian infantryman looking across No-Man's-Land using a trench periscope. The collection also includes an interesting loose print showing the view from the periscope of submarine E.11 in Constantinople harbour on 13 December 1915, taken by Lieutenant-Commander Martin Eric Nasmith VC. Accompanying the photograph is a covering letter from Nasmith to Dauglish dated 1 May 1920. There is also an earlier short letter from Nasmith dated 23 June 1915 thanks Dauglish for an earlier letter. A second loose print with accompanying documentation is a Central News print showing Dauglish heading a service of thanksgiving aboard HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH at 6pm on 21 November 1918, on the occasion of the handing over of the German High Seas Fleet. The documentation consists of a Naval Signal sheet stating the intention of Admiral Beatty to hold the service along with a printed service sheet.
