        "text": "In addition to her position at ECU, Janet Taylor currently holds an appointment as Honorary Principal Research Scientist at Neuroscience Research Australia and a conjoint appointment at the University of New South Wales. She is one of four Chief Investigators on the NHMRC Program grant, Motor Impairment. Studies in this program seek to understand the control of movement in health and the mechanisms of impairment, to identify potential interventions to improve movement and to test whether such interventions are effective.\n\nBackground\n\nJanet Taylor has been involved in full-time research for over 25 years and has been awarded over $13 M in peer-reviewed funding over this period. Over her career she has over 160 peer-reviewed publications with over 6800 citations (Scopus). She has recently moved to ECU from a position as a Principal Research Scientist at Neuroscience Research Australia. Her field of research is the control of movement in people. This includes the reflex and voluntary control of muscle contractions, as well as the sense of proprioception, which allows perception of limb movements and muscle forces. Her studies mostly involve neurophysiological or psychophysical experiments on human volunteers, and she commonly employ techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, corticospinal tract stimulation and peripheral nerve stimulation to evoke responses from the muscles. She is well known for her work describing the contribution of the nervous system to muscle fatigue.\n\nResearch Areas and Interests\n\nThree main strands continue through her past and current research, and ongoing collaborations."
