        "text": "Mr. John Taylor, Principal\n\nFor over 20 years I have worked in education as a social studies teacher, curriculum writer, staff developer, assistant principal, and have most recently served MCPS as the principal of Cabin John Middle, before returning to Winston Churchill. I grew up all over, but spent most of my life in Memphis, TN before moving to MD. My wife, a special education teacher in MCPS, and I, have one son who has earned his degree and is off working in California. I am excited to lead and support the wonderful Churchill community and collaborate with our amazing staff to help make sure all of our students can be successful.\n\nCore Values: Strong First Instruction, Continuous Improvement, Positive Climate for All\n\nMr. John Haas, Assistant Principal\n\nI am proud and pleased to be an administrator at Churchill High School. In my 26th year in MCPS, I have been a social studies Teacher, Team Leader in middle school, Assistant Principal in high school, and Principal at a middle school. I have enjoyed each of these roles for the vast experiences that they have provided to shape my career. I was born in Inchon, South Korea but started my educational years in Cabin John, Maryland. My formative years were spent in New Jersey. As a high school student, I was also a Bulldog but not a Churchill BULLDOG. When I am not at school, my wife and I are swim team parents, taxi service, and social planner for my twins, Maggie and Elliot. My work and journey around MCPS has led me to Churchill HS, which I am extremely happy and honored.\n\nCore Values: Positive relationship building, Equity, Diversity.\n\nDr. La Faye Howard, Assistant Principal\n\nIn my 22nd year with Montgomery County Public schools, I have gained knowledge and experience through many roles including but not limited to being an English teacher and department chair, staff development teacher, and assistant principal. In entering my tenth year as an administrator, my love and passion for the work has not waned. Providing the best educational experience for our students that leads to desirable achievement outcomes in school and beyond is at the core of everything we do as administrators and educators.\n\nI am from Washington D.C. and grew up in Silver Spring before moving, matriculating through college, and teaching in Delaware. I was very happy to come back to Maryland to teach for MCPS. My husband played football at Oxon Hill High School and will never forget when they lost the championship game to The Winston Churchill High School! He still won't wear WCHS gear that I bring home. My husband and I have three happy daughters and enjoy going to parks and beaches to relax and unwind.\n\nCore Values: Excellence in Learning through Successful Instructional Practices, Equity in Access and Supports, and Positive Relationships\n\nDr. Ericka Mbachu, Assistant Principal\n\nI am an instructional leader with over 17 years of experience in the education sector. I have worked as a special education teacher, GED Instructor, and department chair, and most recently served as the Bridge Program Resource Teacher here at Winston Churchill. I have worked in several states (FL, TN, VA) before moving to Maryland in 2019. I am a wife and mother to one son and four stepchildren. I am looking forward to continuing to support the Churchill community in my new role and supporting our staff and students as we work toward academic excellence.\n\nCore Values: Making a Difference, Flexibility, Building Meaningful Relationships\n\nMs. Monica Taliani, Assistant Principal\n\nFor over 18 years I have worked in schools as a general education and special education teacher at the elementary, middle, and high school levels. I also had the pleasure of leading the special education departments of two different buildings prior to coming to Churchill as an administrator. When I am not at school I enjoy the outdoors, cooking, reading, and spending time with my dog. I am excited to be returning for another year at WCHS to continue supporting our students, staff, parents, and community.\n\nCore Values: Empathy, Equity, Inclusion\n\nMrs. Lisa Wellek, School Business Administrator\n\nI am starting my 12th year as the Business Administrator for Churchill HS. This is the only position I have held in MCPS. Prior to that, I ran the Finance and HR Departments for The ColorNet Group and worked in the Athletic Department for Georgetown University. While I was raised in rival Fairfax County, I have lived in Montgomery County since 1995 with my husband of 28 years. I also have three children, all products of MCPS, that have earned college degrees and are pursuing their dreams. I am excited to support your amazing children through clubs and events and provide the needed materials, equipment, and environment to help make them successful."
