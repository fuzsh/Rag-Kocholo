Neither of these doctors would say that about themselves, but their patients do hold them in high regard. They have a hard time imaging a dentist they could like more.

Dr. Taylor is the best I could have ever asked for, I didn’t feel a thing and he explained everything clearly for me.\n\nRichard C.\n\nAs always very friendly and professional. They will answer any question you have and explain it to you. I am a satisfied patient.\n\nBobbi S.\n\nI just got my wisdom teeth out yesterday.

I highly recommend them their the best. Thank you and Happy New Year.\n\nTom H.\n\nSeeing Jeff is always like seeing a good friend or relative.

Recommend this office to any and everyone\n\nTiffany\n\nWe love Dr Taylor! He is so great and it’s our kids. He’s very caring and compassionate. He takes the time and listens to our concerns.
