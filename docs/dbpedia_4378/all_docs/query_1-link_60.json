        "text": "Prof. William Sutherland CBE FRS\n\nDirector of Research and formerly Miriam Rothschild Professor of Conservation Biology, University of Cambridge, established the idea and site and has been heavily involved since. Awarded a CBE in 2021 ‘for services to evidence-based conservation’ and has recently been made a Fellow of the Royal Society for his work on evidence use and been awarded the 2023 ECI Prize in terrestrial ecology.\n\nDr Rebecca Smith\n\nConservation Evidence Manager, University of Cambridge. With previous useful experience as an ecological consultant and developing management plans for mammals for organisations including CapeNature, she initially worked with us on systematic reviews (2007-2009). Since 2011 she has worked on the Farmland Synopsis, produced the Amphibian Synopsis, overseen the production of the majority of synopses since and has been the key person on many aspects of the work of Conservation Evidence, including What Works in Conservation.\n\nProf. Lynn Dicks\n\nUniversity of Cambridge. With a useful background in both ecology and journalism, Lynn has played a key role in establishing many of the main methods such as the synopses and What Works in Conservation. She was the lead author of the Bee Synopsis and the Farmland Synopsis. As a researcher, Lynn works to get Conservation Evidence used in policy making, amongst other research areas.\n\nDr Silviu Petrovan\n\nUniversity of Cambridge, joined the Conservation Evidence team in 2016. Previous roles include Head of Conservation at Froglife, wetland restoration, captive-breeding projects as a qualified vet and citizen science data harnessing to inform species conservation. He is now a Senior Research Associate, leading expert assessments of interventions, producing evidence-based guidelines, and editing What Works in Conservation. He co-supervises PhD students working on conservation cost-effectiveness, road ecology and conservation action for data deficient species.\n\nDr Ann Thornton\n\nUniversity of Cambridge, joined the Conservation Evidence team in August 2019. Ann is Managing Editor of our online Conservation Evidence Journal. Ann is also currently working on our marine corals synopsis. Previous experience includes work with JNCC and as an ecological consultant.\n\nKate Willott, MSc\n\nUniversity of Cambridge, with useful editorial experience, joined the Conservation Evidence team in January 2019.

He also runs the translatE project - Transcending Language Barriers to Environmental Sciences - which identifies non-English-language papers that tested the effectiveness of conservation interventions, assesses and compares the scientific knowledge that is available, and aims to understand how language barriers impede the application of science in decision making.\n\nDr Anna Berthinussen\n\nUniversity of Leeds, is one of two main authors of the Bat Synopsis and has produced the annual Bat Synopsis updates, the Marine Mammal Synopsis and helped to produce the Grassland Synopsis. She has also synthesised evidence on the management of invasive plant species as part of the BioRISC project and is currently helping to produce an Anguillid Eel Synopsis.\n\nDr Alec Christie\n\nUniversity of Cambridge (Downing College), joined the Conservation Evidence project as a PhD student in September 2017 and is now an affiliated researcher. In his research fellowship, Alec is working on how to accelerate the evidence synthesis pipeline with AI to ensure Conservation Evidence can keep up with the rapidly growing scientific literature and provide credible information via natural language interfaces. He has also helped to formulate methods and tools to assess different forms of evidence (e.g. the scientific literature and local knowledge) underpinning key assumptions in conservation projects (Balance Evidence Assessment Method) and to transparently document the evidence behind key decisions (Evidence-to-Decision tool).\n\nDr Vanessa Cutts\n\nUniversity of Cambridge, joined the Conservation Evidence team in October 2022. She has worked on the synopsis for the Conservation of Inland Aquatic Vegetation and is now synthesising evidence for the Anguillid Eel synopsis. Working with the Centre for Landscape Regeneration, she organised site visits with local land managers in the Fens to facilitate knowledge sharing about wetland conservation (the Fenland Conservation Network). She has also worked with Wetlands International to create evidence-based guidance related to tidal flat and salt marsh restoration.\n\nDr Will Morgan\n\nUniversity of Cambridge, joined the Conservation Evidence team in April 2020. Will completed the Reptile Synopsis in 2021 and has since been working on developing methods for assessing and compiling evidence from a wide variety of different sources. He has put some of these methods into practice through the Conservation Learning Initiative, working in partnership with the MAVA Foundation and Foundations of Success. Will has previously worked on conservation reintroductions, carrying out a water vole reintroduction in the north east of Scotland.\n\nDr Sam Reynolds\n\nUniversity of Cambridge, joined the Conservation Evidence team in October 2022. He has synthesised evidence on the management of invasive plant species as part of the BioRISC project and is currently helping to produce an Anguillid Eel Synopsis.\n\nDr Nigel Taylor\n\nUniversity of Cambridge, was the lead author of the Peatland Synopsis (2018) and the Marsh and Swamp Synopsis (2021). He is currently working on the Aquatic Vegetation synopsis, and synthesising evidence relevant to UK landscape restoration as part of the Cambridge Centre for Landscape Regeneration (https://www.clr.conservation.cam.ac.uk/). Nigel's previous roles included working with ZSL and with Tour du Valat.\n\nDr Andrew Bladon\n\nUniversity of Cambridge, joined the Conservation Evidence team in June 2019 following work with the RSPB.
