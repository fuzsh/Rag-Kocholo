        "text": "What an A-MAZING(!) week back home in NYC, with new friends & old. On Monday, my team & I joined ICE CISO Steve P. & NYSE President Lynn Martin at the New York Stock Exchange for a meeting with security leaders...and I got to ring the opening bell--one of the coolest things EVER! (...AND the market was up over 1000 points for the week....just sayin'...!). Huge thanks to Lynn, Steve, & the folks at NYSE, including COO John Tuttle; it was SO SPECIAL for Team CISA, including our White House Fellow Maria Gilbert, Michael Feldman, and (world's greatest Exec) Taylor Smith, to see our seal featured all across the Exchange floor. [High-five Amanda Glenn!] After NYSE, we chatted with our great partners Jacqueline Bray, Colin Ahern & Kathryn Garcia about our work together to ensure the security of critical infrastructure across New York State. We spent the afternoon with the incredibly impressive Dr. Zeita Merchant - Captain of the Port of NY/ NJ, & her USCG team, including newly minted CG Cyber Officer Carolyn Ziegler, learning about all they do to keep maritime critical infrastructure secure. On Tuesday, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Chief Information Officer Robert Costello & I spoke at the National Cybersecurity Alliance Summit at Nasdaq. Thanks to NCA Executive Director Lisa Plaggemier for a great fireside chat & for your terrific partnership. After lunch with Mighty CISA Region Two, led by the great John Durkin & Mohamed Telab, we met with Girl Scouts of the USA CEO Sofia Chang & her team to talk about collaborating on inspiring more girls to get into cybersecurity. So excited about our growing partnership! (Stay tuned for Cyber Cookies!?) Finished the day with a visit to Qrypt to chat with CTO Denis Mandich & CEO Kevin Chalker about their efforts to build quantum-secure encryption services. Also got to see their collection of WWII crypto machines and a fantastic view of the city from the Freedom Tower. On Wednesday, I joined dear friend Bank of America CISO Craig Froelich to kick off the U.S. Secret Service Cyber Fraud Task Force Conference, which also featured CISA teammate Natasha Cohen. In addition to being a great technical leader, I love Craig's focus on mental health & championing neurodiversity in the cyber workforce. Thanks to Patrick Freaney & his team for hosting a great event. Closed out Wednesday talking with a group of Chief Information Officers from the nation's biggest companies. Thanks to Monte Edwards & Ted Schlein for the chance to discuss the big opportunities we have to collectively drive down risk to our nation's critical infrastructure through persistent operational collaboration. And to top it all off, got to catch up over dinner with my best friend and West Point classmate Christina (CJ) Juhasz. Super proud of all the incredible things CJ is doing at Women's World Banking Asset Management to create economic prosperity for women and their communities around the world. Proud & Mighty!"
