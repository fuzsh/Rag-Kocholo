        "text": "Sue J. Taylor, 91, formerly of Simpson Meadows, Downingtown, went to be with her Lord and Savior on Thursday, September 28, 2023 at her daughter’s residence. She was the wife of the late David W. Taylor.\n\nBorn Billie Sue Johnson on October 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, she was the daughter of the late Kenneth Lee and Billie Beatrice Johnson.\n\nSue graduated from Chester High School in 1948 and went on to study at the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music. She blessed many people with her beautiful voice, singing in several church choirs, choral groups and at many weddings. She formed a junior choir at her church which she directed for many years and she was a talented piano player as well. Sue always had a passion for writing, penning short stories and wrote a collection of poems. She loved her dogs, feeding the birds, gardening, and bowling.\n\nSue worked at the Credit Bureau of West Chester, Norcross Card Company, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, and until her retirement in 2021, enjoyed her retail clerk position at Boscov's Department Store in Exton. She was involved with the local chapter of the Prisoner of Wars due to her late husband's service during World War II and was instrumental in persuading the US Congress to increase disability pay for POW Veterans.\n\nSurviving are her children, James Layman (Ellie) of Coatesville, Janet Reiter, wife of the late William Reiter, of West Chester, and Robert Layman (Lisa), of Glen Mills; grandchildren Lauren Haney, Kelly Conlan, Aubrey Sauer, Kathryn Thomas, Courtney Layman and Charles Allen; and eight great grandchildren. Sue was \"adopted\" by her late husband's family, the Bignears and the Whites, who were very special to her; she would recount many fond memories of their extended family get-togethers. She also leaves behind a special friend, Martin Elliott. She was preceded in death by her dear friend, Conrad Muhly. Sue cherished her Simpson Meadows \"family\" and enjoyed her years living there.\n\nA Celebration of Sue’s Life will be held on Saturday, October 14, 2023, at 11AM at the Simpson Meadows Community Room, 101 Plaza Drive, Downingtown, PA 19335. A private burial will be held for family prior to the Celebration.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in Sue’s memory to the Downingtown United Methodist Church, 751 E Lancaster Avenue, Downingtown, PA 19335 or the Simpson Foundation, 150 Monument Drive, Bala Cynwyd, PA 19004."
