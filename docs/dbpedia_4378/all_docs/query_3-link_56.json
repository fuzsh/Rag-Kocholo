        "text": "Adel Andemeskel, PGY-1\n\nAdel was born and raised in Massachusetts. She attended Stanford University, majoring in Biology. After taking a community health advocacy course her senior year, she delved deep into social determinants of health and dreamed of primary care as a career. Upon graduating from college, Adel worked as a research coordinator in the rheumatology department at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston for three years. Adel then attended medical school at the Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine in southeastern Michigan. At OUWB, she was president of her school’s Student National Medical Association. She also learned about the wonderful world of med-peds, and found it to be the perfect fit for her! Throughout her life, Adel has been dedicated to her Eritrean community in Boston. She is passionate about improving diversity in medicine and recruiting those who identify as underrepresented in medicine (URiM) to the field. Adel is excited to continue fulfilling her passions at UMass Med-Peds!\n\nSamantha Beck, PGY-1\n\nSam grew up in Middleton on the north shore of Massachusetts. She attended college at The Ohio State University where she studied biology and Spanish (as well as college football). After graduating, she worked with a Med-Peds-trained primary care physician as a scribe at a Cambridge Health Alliance clinic in Everett, MA. She went on to attend medical school at UMass Chan and loved it here so much that she wanted to stay for residency! During medical school, Sam was a leader of a free medical clinic and an elective course on Substance Use Disorders. She was involved in several qualitative research projects on Opioid Use Disorder. Sam also participated in the pediatrics Sidekicks student group where she was paired with a pediatric patient with a serious illness, serving a supportive nonclinical role for the patient and her family as she underwent treatment. Throughout medical school she learned about how challenging transitions of care can be for many patients with chronic diseases, and she hopes to play a role in easing these transitions with strong training in both Internal Medicine and Pediatrics. Her career interests include cardiology, addiction medicine, and transitions of care. Outside of the hospital, she enjoys cooking, snowshoeing, traveling, listening to 60s/70s music, exercising, and cheering on the OSU Buckeyes.\n\nZachary Linneman, PGY-1\n\nZach Linneman completed his undergraduate medical education at the University of Minnesota, where he was awarded an ASTMH Ben Kean fellowship to continue research and clinical projects in childhood malnutrition in Africa and Asia. He was born and raised in St. Louis, MO and stayed to study Chinese Language & Literature at Washington University after classical Chinese training at a Jesuit boys’ school, St. Louis U. High. After working chiefly in Malawi and India, he was hired as a fundraising consultant for a mission school in the ghetto of North St. Louis City before returning to Wash U for a postbacc premed program, during which time he was chair of the STL Wash U Alumni Club. During application cycles, he undertook an internship in maternal and child health in Delhi and then worked in a private urgent care in Missouri. He is interested in traditional cuisine mastery, creative writing, and the occasional open mic night. He has a pet cat “P.W.” and enjoys hosting dinner parties."
