        "text": "This discussion of nineteenth-century Magdalene grew out of my interest in the education of Charles Stewart Parnell, who entered the College in 1865 and was rusticated (briefly expelled, but he never returned) in 1869. Originally posted here in 2015, the text was re-spaced in May 2020, with additional material at Endnotes 131 and 181.\n\nPrologue: Parnell's College\n\nI: A Transpontine Refuge for Fallen Undergraduates?\n\nII: Magdalene College, October 1865\n\nIII: The Magdalene Irish\n\nIV: Endnotes\n\nPrologue: Parnell's College\n\nThis exploration of Magdalene College Cambridge in the eighteen-sixties forms part of the background to a continuing study of the early life of Charles Stewart Parnell, who was \"rusticated\" (temporarily expelled) from the University in May 1869 after becoming involved in a fight outside the railway station. Its starting point is my own article on the subject, in Irish Historical Studies, published so long ago (in 1974) that I feel I can legitimately (and, I hope, objectively) treat it as a document in its own right.[1] The picture assembled from available evidence at that time requires modification in three major respects. First, Parnell went to Cambridge under a major financial handicap, caused by having inherited the family property at Avondale in County Wicklow at a time when its relatively limited rental income was severely encumbered with mortgages. The financial situation was made worse by the unimaginative financial grip of the Court of Chancery which controlled the estate during Parnell's minority, which terminated in 1867. Second, and related to this, he was not in residence at Cambridge throughout the four years from his matriculation in October 1865, but rather was absent, almost certainly largely for financial reasons, for two periods, the longer of which spanned much of 1867 to 1869. The third modification of the traditionally accepted picture of an uninvolved and directionless young man is that Parnell passed both his first- and second-year examinations, the one with credit and the other with at least average competence. Thus, contrary to the generally accepted negative view ─ for which my younger self bears considerable share of responsibility ─ Charles Stewart Parnell was both intellectually able, and ─ in the face of considerable obstacles ─ impressively determined to secure his degree, an ambition that he had to abandon after the unfortunate episode at Cambridge railway station.\n\nThe essay that follows similarly re-examines both assumptions and sources about Magdalene College at the time when he studied there. While the picture of a snobbish and intellectually undistinguished institution remains generally accurate, some qualification can be offered. Magdalene perhaps functioned more effectively as a community than its rejection of Parnell might seem to imply. Educationally, if it specialised in taking the rejected sows' ears of more high-powered colleges, it also managed to turn a surprising number of them into the cloth purses of the despised Cambridge Pass degree. Paradoxically, Magdalene functioned as a second-chance institution that specialised in value-added education. Its shortcoming, to modern eyes, was that it discharged these worthy functions almost entirely for the benefit of the rich. The discussion that follows focuses upon Magdalene, but has Parnell as its background point of reference.\n\nI: A Transpontine Refuge for Fallen Undergraduates?\n\nA distinguished scholar of Magdalene College Cambridge once wrote that academic histories \"have the curious effect of distancing and embalming the conditions they describe.\" The \"pale violet tints\" of nostalgic memoirs and seductive \"anecdotage\" against which J.A.W. Bennett warned figure large in any subsequent invocation of Magdalene in Victorian times.[2] In the case of Magdalene, reminiscence and memorialisation give us tantalising and sometimes vivid glimpses of an academic community that was simultaneously vigorous and malfunctioning, combining to produce a predominantly pejorative impression. This impression is by no means inaccurate but it somehow fails to capture the full, nuanced picture of the student society through which Charles Stewart Parnell experienced his first sustained contact with the English elite.\n\nMagdalene was one of the smaller colleges in the University of Cambridge. In November 1866, there were sixty undergraduates in residence, far fewer than the 571 at Trinity, the 322 of St John's or even the 130 of Gonville and Caius. But its student population was equal to that of Queens', and roughly the same as Pembroke, Sidney Sussex, Peterhouse and St Catharine's. Only King's, with just 33 undergraduates and Downing, with 34, were markedly smaller. But although Magdalene was not the smallest college, it was definitely the poorest. In 1880, when the University began to levy a contribution from the colleges proportionate to their wealth, Trinity, at the head of the list, was rated to contribute more than 32 times as much as Magdalene, at the bottom ─ and Magdalene found even that imposition a struggle. It was simple enough to assume that the College's poverty explained its allegedly low academic standards. By the eighteen-sixties, money was beginning to talk very loud in the league tables of examination success. Institutional reform at both Cambridge and Oxford had opened up to general competition many scholarships that had been quaintly restricted to candidates from particular counties or schools, while the Indian Civil Service was also offering glittering financial prizes for clever young men. As discussed below, Magdalene lacked the resources to compete in recruiting the most promising students. Since the College was not responsible for its poverty ─ and could in fact claim to have been badly treated ─ it seemed equally easy to conclude that nothing could be done to raise either its income or its academic record.\n\nBroadly, there were three reasons why Magdalene was so poor. First, in its earliest incarnation, at its initial founding in 1428, it had not been an independent college at all, but simply a hall of residence dependent upon four east-of-England abbeys, and known as the Monks' Hostel.[3] Second, as it slowly developed towards independent status, the College had been unlucky in its patrons, although arguably the patrons had been unluckier still. Two Dukes of Buckingham and one Duke of Norfolk had promised support, in each case shortly before being beheaded for treason. \"Surely no College has suffered so greatly from the liquidation of benefactors\", a College historian has complained.[4] It was re-founded, and punningly renamed as \"Magdalene\", by Sir Thomas Audley in 1542 but, as will be seen, this grasping Tudor politician was more concerned with his own dynastic interests than with the financial independence of his creation.[5] Although Audley dodged the block, he too soon died, having endowed the College with little more than a single chunk of land.\n\nAnd that leads us to the third reason for endemic poverty, the saga of the Aldgate property. Briefly, Audley gifted the College seven acres of land on the eastern fringe of the growing city of London. In 1574, Magdalene entered into agreement with a developer ─ itself not an unreasonable move ─ who promised to increase the College's annual income from £9 to £15. Unfortunately, the Crown spotted a legal flaw in the contract and punished the transgression by seizing the property. Even by the standards of Tudor rapacity, this was a monstrous injustice. Magdalene actually won a court case over the Aldgate property in 1615, but a legal victory over the Crown did not mean that the College would recover the land, although it still hoped to do so as late as 1805, and went through the motions of considering further litigation as late as 1914.[6] When the College developed its adjoining Quayside site in 1990 (also, and very sensibly, in partnership with a developer), it included a gargoyle to represent the partner in its ill-fated sixteenth-century venture. This was a trifle unfair.\n\nObviously, the loss of the Aldgate property was a financial setback, but perhaps more debilitating was the legacy of long-term victimhood that tended to engulf Magdalene like a dispiriting fog. \"We have been plundered of our just property by unexampled fraud and iniquity,\" fumed the Master of Magdalene, Peter Peckard, in 1786. In 1851, the College sadly reported to the Royal Commission on the Universities that the property \"would have been at the present day of enormous value\".[7] The pioneer College historian, E.K. Purnell (a contemporary of his near namesake, C.S. Parnell), complained in 1904 that \"but for fraud, at which the highest in the land connived, we should now have been almost the richest college in Oxford or Cambridge.\" (In fact, modern calculations suggest that Aldgate would have provided a comfortable rather than an astronomical endowment income.)[8] But where Peckard, one of the best Masters the College ever had, urged that Magdalene should seek to excel in virtue rather than opulence, others almost certainly used the legend of the lost Aldgate property as an excuse for mediocrity.[9] Its vigorous neighbour St John's, on the other hand, managed to outgrow the \"hardy legend\" that it had been cheated out of its intended endowment by Henry VIII.[10] Similarly, King's recovered from the deposition of its founder Henry VI although, even in the twentieth century, St Catharine's was still bemoaning the fact that its founder had backed the wrong side in the War of the Roses. Similarly, at Oxford, Christ Church triumphantly bounced back from the downfall of its initial projector, Cardinal Wolsey. A great deal of money, or at least moneyed undergraduates, passed through Magdalene in the nineteenth century, and their fees were no doubt essential, but remarkably little of their wealth made its way into the College coffers. When Magdalene launched its first formal appeal for cash in 1928, the response from old members was notably disappointing.[11] Poverty provided the context and much of the explanation for Magdalene's problems, but it obscured their real origins, which were to be found in a curious apposition between the disadvantages of geography and the curiosities of history.[12]\n\nLocation, location, location\n\nMagdalene was the only college north (or west) of the Cam. The mid-Victorian joke that it was \"somewhere in Huntingdonshire\"[13] reflects the preciously Lilliputian world of Cambridge, as seen in the complaint of Trinity Hall's Leslie Stephen when the Union Society moved in 1866 from Green Street to a site behind the Round Church that it had \"crept into so retired a corner\". Although a seventeenth-century versifier had called the Cam at Magdalene a \"vast Gulph\", which it likened to the English Channel, the College was not so very far from downtown Cambridge.[14] Far less desirable was its location. Daniel Defoe had noted in 1723 that all the colleges were \"promiscuously scattered ... and some even among the meanest of other buildings; as Magdalen College over the bridge is in particular\".[15] One of its disadvantages was its location hard by one of the town's busiest and narrowest thoroughfares, a \"very dirty street\" as it had been called in 1760. Several main roads entered Cambridge from the south and east, but all traffic from the three major routes leading from the north and west funnelled down Magdalene Street, \"one of the great arteries of the town\".[16] Victoria Bridge, the second crossing downstream, was not built until 1890.[17] In the twenty years before Parnell's time, railways provided some relief in the amount of bulk traffic heading across the bridge, resulting in fewer stagecoaches and probably less movement of livestock. A rare and precious photograph of Magdalene Street at about the time Parnell was in residence shows relatively little traffic but there is no way of telling whether the late-afternoon scene was typical or specially chosen, perhaps taken on a Sunday. But this amelioration in traffic flow would have been balanced by the northward expansion of the town's own built-up area, and here Magdalene was located not so much on the far side of the river as on the wrong side of the tracks. The old-established suburb of Castle End had an unsavoury reputation.[18] Twentieth-century Magdalene swept its frontier round to Northampton Street, but in Parnell's time the area to the west of Magdalene Street, now Benson Court, was a warren of back alleys: there was a smithy in Fisher Lane, near the site of modern O Block.[19]\n\nA few hundred yards up Castle Hill, on the site of the Shire Hall, the County Gaol cast its baleful influence over the neighbourhood. There were hangings in Cambridge in 1861 and 1864:[20] executions were still carried out in public, and Parnell himself would be outraged by the last of them, the open-air killing of the \"Manchester Martyrs\" outside Salford Prison in 1868. A regular reminder of the gaol would have been the prison vans, like the vehicle the Fenians attacked in Manchester, which must have shuttled along Magdalene Street bringing felons from the police station and the magistrates' courts. Police officers unfamiliar with the town sometimes attempted to deliver prisoners to Magdalene porters' lodge, misled by the gloomy institutional appearance of the College's facade.[21]\n\nBricks and mortar were advancing beyond Castle Hill and it was not surprising that the new residents were predominantly poor. Most of them lived within the parish of St Giles, described in 1856 as \"a most difficult parish from vice & poverty & disease\". In 1862, Trinity College helped fund a curate to minister to more than a thousand people living in the district around Victoria Road and Histon Road: a part of Cambridge that is now gentrified was then \"in great spiritual destitution\". The following year, the wedding of the Prince of Wales was celebrated by charity feasts for the poor, and no fewer than eighteen hundred of them were fed in the parish of St Giles.[22] The Edwardian fashion for community service had not yet engulfed Cambridge,[23] but the Vicar of St Giles, Edward Dodd, was a Magdalene man who, in the absence of a designated vicarage, retained rooms in College. In 1861, arising out of a theological dispute, he was horse-whipped in First Court by a fellow cleric.[24]\n\nThe cluster of colleges in the urban core of Cambridge also occupied terrain that was sometimes violently contested between Town and Gown, but the arrival of the railway in 1845 had cut into the river trade that had created employment in the town centre rookeries, and the poor were moving out of the central area parishes.[25] The growing artisan suburbs of Barnwell and Romsey Town were segregated from the main University district by a curtain of open spaces. With no such cordon sanitaire keeping Castle End at arm's length, Magdalene was becoming particularly exposed to social deprivation. However, one aspect of river trade continued to flourish, to the further disadvantage of the College. It still made sense to use waterborne transport to move bulk freight, especially coal, which was unloaded at Quayside. The modern-day recreational piazza was described in 1865, Parnell's freshman year, as \"the busiest part of the town\". It was probably also the dirtiest.[26]\n\nCoal-heaving bargees were muscular men with simple pleasures, which included drinking and fighting. Magdalene, the college of the Marquess of Queensberry, was a notable source of combatants. There was little malice in this casual violence: twenty years before Parnell's time, the bargees affectionately described Magdalene as \"our college\".[27] Institutionally, the College could exercise little control beyond its own gates: it did not even manage to buy the Pickerel Inn, the chief riverside hostelry, until 1879. There were other public houses further up the street which were swept away in a road-widening scheme in 1911.[28] After dark, Magdalene Street could be a rough place. A Saturday night fight outside the Pickerel during the Christmas vacation of 1866-67 ended up in the police court.[29] On one occasion \"after the college gates were closed\" at night, when his Mathematics lecturer, G.F. Pattrick, was sallying forth to investigate a disturbance, Parnell rushed up to him and said, \"Oh, sir, do let me go out to protect you.\"[30]\n\nUnhappily, there is yet one more element of Magdalene's bad luck to be taken into account. It was not just the bargees who came up the river who caused Magdalene problems. What flowed downstream was far more unpleasant, pervasive and downright unhealthy. A correspondent of a local newspaper complained in 1866 that the Cam was used as \"a receptacle or charnel-house for the carcasses of almost all the dead dogs, cats, sheep, and pigs that have died in Cambridge during the year.\" . In 1887, the Cam was still \"the receptacle for the canine and feline dead of the borough.\"[31] But it was humans and not animals who were the most comprehensive polluters. Most of the town's sewage was discharged direct into the river, and the population of Cambridge grew roughly fourfold between 1801 and the mid-eighteen-nineties, when a modern piped sewerage system was finally installed. Victorians were both robust and discreet, so that the unpleasant subject was rarely mentioned. One exception was Gwen Raverat, who recalled the smell of the river from her childhood at Newnham Grange, now Darwin College and, as she put it, \"we lived at the upper end of the town, so it was not so very bad.\"[32] A German princeling in 1852 showed off his Latin by calling the Cam \"Cloaca Maxima\", the name of a famous sewer in ancient Rome.[33] A local joke had Queen Victoria standing on Trinity Bridge and enquiring why so many pieces of paper floating in the river. With ingenious tact, the Master of Trinity explained that they were notices forbidding the public to bathe.\n\nThe Queen was less naive than her detractors imagined. In 1868 she subscribed a massive £100 in 1868 to a scheme for cleaning up the Cam, a project she explained that her late husband, who had been Chancellor of the University, would have approved.[34] The intention was to dredge the river between Jesus Lock and Baitsbite, a three-mile stretch downstream from the main urban area. During the summer of 1868 (when Parnell was absent from Magdalene), the stink from the Cam \"was so horrible that no one should have been allowed to row on it,\" in the opinion of the prominent civil engineer Sir John Hawkshaw. \"To acquire or even to retain physical vigour by rowing upon such a river would require the laws of nature to be suspended on behalf of those who made the attempt.\"[35] Indeed, it was the rowing men who took the initiative in organising the clean-up, but their motive was not sanitary reform, and the endeavour provides fascinating if alarming evidence of Cambridge priorities. The problem was that the torrential discharge of sewage into the Cam had almost silted up parts of the river. Worse still, the high nutrient content of the water encouraged the growth of massive blooms of entangling weed. The combined effect of the silt and vegetation was that the Cambridge rowing technique had degenerated into a shallow, stabbing paddle. Oxford crews, on the other hand, training on the broad, deep reaches of the Upper Thames, could practise long, strong strokes of their \"own grand old sweeping style\" that were far better suited to the gruelling four-and-a-quarter mile course of the annual Boat Race between Putney and Mortlake. By 1868, Oxford had won eight contests in a row. Cambridge could live with the daily threat of typhoid, but it could not countenance indefinite annual aquatic humiliation. The public subscription raised awesome sums of money, sufficient not merely to dredge out the deposited sewage but even to straighten out some of the bends and rebuild the Barnwell railway bridge in flyover form. Measured by its own standards, the project was a success.[36] Cambridge rowing improved dramatically, and it was the Light Blues who crossed the Mortlake finishing line first for the five consecutive years beginning in 1870. If the dredging operation made virtually no contribution to public health, it is only fair to note that such was not its aim.\n\nIn May 1869, that fateful month in Parnell's university career, the engineer Hawkshaw sought to shift the focus upstream to the town itself, using that classic vehicle of English protest, a letter to The Times. It appeared the day after a local court had awarded damages against Parnell for his part in the Station Road affray: if he saw the paper, he may well have concluded that Cambridge needed cleaning-up at more than one level. \"The Cam is called a river,\" Hawkshaw began; \"practically it is a canal. The waters are impounded by locks above and below the town, and are very nearly stagnant.\" The downstream barrier was the lock and sluice at Jesus Green, just a few hundred yards below Magdalene. Thus when Hawkshaw described the Cam as possessing \"in rich perfection all the attributes of a common sewer, and is very nearly filled with sewage deposit,\" he was identifying a crisis which was at its worst alongside the University's only \"transpontine\" college. Dredging and widening the lower reaches, Hawkshaw pointed out, would not solve the core problem. \"The river will again silt up more speedily than before, for the town grows larger every day.\" To Hawkshaw, the remedy was obvious: the great sanitary engineer Joseph Bazalgette had drawn up a plan to give the town a modern sewerage system, and the remedy was cheap, costing a mere £2,700. Three days later, Hawkshaw corrected a misprint: the cost would in fact be £27,000. It was a foretaste of disappointments to follow.[37]\n\nThe sequel, or lack thereof, may be briefly summarised. The Master of Magdalene was one of six heads of colleges who attended a special meeting of the Cambridge Improvement Commissioners in November 1870 to discuss \"immediate action\" for remedying the \"disgraceful and foul condition\" of the Cam.[38] But it quickly became clear that an urgent response was beyond the various institutions involved. As late as 1884, the Town Clerk insisted that \"the Town Council have no responsibility in the matter, which fell under the remit of the Cam Conservators and the Improvement Commissioners.\"[39] In 1871, the latter estimated the cost of a sewerage scheme at £60,000.[40] This alarmed the University, since a modern sewerage scheme would not only cost the colleges large sums as ratepayers but would also involve them in additional expense connecting to the system. Trinity, for instance, covered the area of a small town, which explains why, as late as 1883, its bursar insisted that a clean river \"was from a sanitary point of view more a luxury than a necessity\".[41] Magdalene had some surface water drains, but no internal sewerage of any kind. basic human needs were met by privies \"built over the river, and very foul they were, for there was nothing but the slow current to perform any cleansing or move on the deposits which fell into the water, save for such scavenging as was done by the eels which could be seen swimming about below.\"[42] Given the scale of the problem, the University could only solemnly establish a special committee ─ a \"syndicate\" in Cambridge terminology ─ to explore the subject of sewerage. In 1872, this body recommended a scheme for mains sewers connecting to a proposed treatment plant at Coldham's Common, at a cost of £48,500, plus connection costs for the individual colleges. But the syndicate also recommended a change in the rating system designed to shift the cost burden from the University to the Town. Reacting with silent contempt, the Improvement Commissioners did not bother to reply.[43]\n\nFor the next decade and a half, until its abolition, the Improvement Commission pursued two contradictory policies. On the one hand, it either denied or simply ignored complaints about the state of the river. Denial was dangerous, as was shown in 1874 when the Commissioners publicly dismissed a report in the medical journal The Lancet, only to have it pointed out that there were eight cases of typhoid in Addenbrooke's Hospital, and that \"Cambridge is not a safe place of residence for undergraduates.\" In 1884, the Commission sat out criticism in silence for long as it dared and, as late as 1887, some of its members felt that it was beneath their dignity to comment on attacks in the press.[44] When they were dragged out into the light, the Improvement Commission's Plan B was to blame everybody else, from the bureaucracy of the Local Government Board, through the miserliness of the University to the sloth of Parliament. In this last instance, it must be admitted that they marshalled a plausible case. Disraeli's ministry had made three attempts between 1877 and 1879 to settle the Cambridge rating issue through a Property Valuation Bill, but on each occasion the legislation had failed to make its way through Parliament. Parnell would have pointed out that Westminster's sluggishness formed part of the case for Irish Home Rule. Parliament was simply incapable of handling the bulk of legislation required to run a modernising society, and devolution for the United Kingdom's smaller island would open the way for the more efficient government of its larger neighbour. Meanwhile, the Improvement Commission doggedly pleaded that \"the death-rate of this borough is lower than that of any borough in the kingdom, with one exception\" and that its very few infectious cases \"have always occurred in parts of the town most remote from the river.\" Downstream, sections of the rowing course dredged out under the 1868 scheme had once again accumulated up to three feet of \"solid matter\" by 1884.[45] Three years later, 171 members of the Cambridge Union Society voted unanimously for a motion declaring the state of the Cam to be a \"disgrace\" and \"a serious danger to the health of the community\".[46] Eventually, major local government reform in 1888 merged the Town Council and the Improvement Commission, and opened the way for the undertaking of a massively expensive sewerage scheme in 1895. For Cambridge's poorest college, already struggling with a financial crisis caused by falling rents during the late-Victorian agricultural depression, the expense was \"almost insupportable\".[47]\n\nThe Cam forms such a major backdrop to contemporary Cambridge that it is hard to appreciate just how disgusting it was before 1895 and, in particular, how damaging was its proximity to Magdalene. Of course, we have to acknowledge that the Victorians took a robust attitude to sewage: nobody would have rowed at all if they had been squeamish about such matters. Indeed, Leslie Stephen, a fervent oarsman, cheerfully inverted contemporary concern by claiming that rowing would not be possible at all on the shallow Cam without \"the tribute derived from the town drains.\"[48] None the less, it is striking that only two of the seventeen colleges abutted the Cam, and both St John's and Queens' (the latter safely upstream) were end-on to the river. King's and Trinity Hall kept their distance until the stink was eliminated, while Trinity and Clare hold their noses to this day.[49] Magdalene also kept a slight distance. A terrace of houses occupied what is now the street front of River Court until 1873, and a huge boundary wall still flanks the south side of Second Court. But Magdalene was the furthest college downstream and the smell must have been awesome. With its prominent riverside latrines, Magdalene's image was particularly associated with sewage. Indeed, two traditional 'jokes' (few things are so unfunny as historical jokes) are best interpreted against this background. In 1687, the Master of Magdalene, John Peachell, opposed a despotic command from James II, so helping to set in motion the resistance that culminated in the Glorious Revolution. The king was reportedly furious at encountering defiance from such a humble institution, and contemptuously jibed that \"he would go to stool there\". A century later, when Magdalene was briefly dominated by Evangelicals, detractors alleged that their abstemious habits had blocked the Cam with tea-leaves.[50] The witticism was probably colour-coded. William Gretton (Master 1797-1813), an opponent of radical Protestantism, may not have been speaking figuratively when he complained \"that there must be something in the air of Magdalene that made men Methodists\".[51]\n\nThe Audley End Connection\n\nGeography, then, had compounded the disadvantages of Cambridge's poorest college by locating Magdalene in the poorest, busiest, smelliest and most violent corner of the town. We might expect it to have become an institution that would attract students from unpretentious backgrounds, to have developed into a society whose (slight) remoteness from urban temptation would foster a high-minded commitment to study. Such indeed was Magdalene in its late eighteenth-century Evangelical period: in the first twenty-five years of the University's Divinity Prize, Magdalene candidates were victorious on fifteen occasions.[52] In the early nineteenth century, sophisticated Cambridge still derided their naivety. A dozen Magdalene men had daringly tried to get drunk ─ on a single bottle of wine. A Magdalene man had been tricked into proposing marriage to a transvestite, and had actually got as far as the wedding ceremony.[53] Yet within a few decades, the College's image (but not necessarily its secret inward reality) had been totally transformed: geographical determinism had been over-ridden by historical peculiarity.\n\nBy mid-Victorian times, Magdalene was perceived to have become one of the most socially select institutions in the University: Samuel Sproston chose Magdalene in 1868 because it contained \"a larger proportion of Public School men than any other college\", except for King's, which was largely an Eton preserve.[54] Historical particularism had overcome geographical determinism. The explanation dated back to Audley's re-foundation of the College in 1542. This Tudor hard man had taken over Walden Abbey, one of the sponsors of the Monks' Hostel, renaming it \"Audley End\". It was in keeping with this immodesty that he also decided to reserve the appointment of successive Masters of Magdalene to his descendants.[55] By the nineteenth century, those descendants were the Neville family, whose male head bore the title of Baron Braybrooke.\n\nThe result of this curious piece of patronage, as an American student scornfully put it, the Master of Magdalene was usually '\"some Rev. Mr. Neville or other.\"[56] The Braybrookes saw nothing wrong in this. In 1812, the second Baron had called the arrangement \"the choicest feather belonging to my inheritance\", and made it clear that it would be reserved \"either for my own family or the most enlightened of my friends.\"[57] Since the nineteenth-century Braybrookes produced a crop of needy and long-lived younger sons, not even the enlightened friends got a look-in. In 1813, the preferment went to the 24 year-old George Neville (from 1825, Neville-Grenville).[58] The College statutes required the Master to be \"triginta aut circiter\" (thirty or thereabouts): twenty-nine had been accepted as a benchmark back in 1747, twenty-seven more grudgingly swallowed in 1774. Lord Braybrooke claimed the right as Visitor to ignore the requirement altogether. However, it was not possible to subvert the requirement that the Master of Magdalene had to be an Anglican clergyman, and Neville went through a double ordination, as both deacon and priest, on the same day ─ his appointment thus violating both secular and ecclesiastical statutes.[59]\n\nThroughout his forty-year Mastership, two Magdalenes, one intermittently academic, the other defiantly hedonistic, existed side by side. If unimpressive intellectually, the Master's facility for personal locomotion was awesome: indeed, he seems to have lived simultaneously in several parts of England, a multiple existence all the remarkable in that it preceded the railway age. In 1814, he was appointed Rector of Hawarden in Cheshire, on the nomination of his brother-in-law, Sir Stephen Glynne. Neville added nine bedrooms to the Rectory, and he was officially returned as living there in 1832: ten of his children were baptised in his parish church.[60] Yet, somehow, he managed to take his turn as Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University in 1818-19. In 1825, he inherited from a cousin the 2,000-acre estate of Butleigh Court in Somerset, changing his surname to Neville-Grenville in tribute. He extended the estate, engaged in large-scale tree planting and, in 1847, borrowed £4,000 to drain Sedgemoor.[61]\n\nIn 1834, Neville-Grenville made way in Hawarden for a clerical Glynne. It is probably no coincidence that planning began for a new, stand-alone Master's Lodge at Magdalene at that time, although buoyant enrolments (by Magdalene standards) were also adding to pressure for additional student accommodation. Previous Masters had lived in a lodging on the north side of First Court, but this was neither convenient for a family of ten children nor, one suspects, appropriate for Lady Charlotte Neville-Grenville, who was the daughter of an earl.[62] The architect Edward Blore was in Cambridge in January 1834 to discuss abortive plans, and building work was in progress by July 1835, when Prince George of Cambridge contributed a ceremonial brick. The new Lodge was ready for occupation in May 1837.[63] However, Neville-Grenville was still far from continuously resident. In January 1840, he had to make a special visit to Cambridge to deal with George Urquhart, a disruptive Fellow whose abusive comments had soured the donnish community: Urquhart was persuaded to accept \"a sort of compulsory exile\", probably sweetened by the promise of the reversion to a College living, which he acquired a decade later.[64] In November 1846, Neville-Grenville was described as \"paying one of his fly-away visits\" to Cambridge.[65] That year, to the delight of his nephew-by-marriage, W.E. Gladstone, the Master was appointed to the prestigious Deanery of Windsor, giving him yet another base.[66] Although Neville-Grenville offered to resign Magdalene on becoming Dean, he was blocked by the Visitor, his brother Lord Braybrooke, who had earmarked the post for his fourth son Latimer. Aged nineteen in 1846, Latimer Neville needed time to develop skills of academic leadership. But the Master's health was in decline: by 1850, although still only sixty years of age, he was \"a wreck\". Three years later, with some diplomacy needed to manage the Fellowship, the transition was achieved, and Latimer Neville became Master at the age of twenty-six.[67]\n\nOne result of Neville-Grenville's strange commuting headship was that much of the running of Magdalene was left in the hands of the Fellows. This accounts for the fact that the College's academic record during the Neville-Grenville era was in fact by no means unimpressive: there were twenty-one Firsts between 1823 and 1842.[68] However, the damaging image of the College as a privileged playground took root during his years. College historian Ronald Hyam notes that Neville's arrival was immediately followed by an influx of students from his old school, Eton, many admitted as Fellow Commoners, undergraduates who paid higher fees in return for privileges.[69] By 1820, it was claimed that a freshman who actually attended classes was privately warned against such vulgar conformism.[70] The Cambridge chronicler who recorded the tea-leaves joke in 1827 was fair-minded enough to add that the \"modern men of Maudlin [sic] … fully attest, by their copious libations, the immense strides they have made in civilization.\" Evangelical seriousness was becoming a facetious memory: although the first Magdalene Boat to take to the river, in 1828, was named \"The Tea Kettle\", while at one early Bump Supper, near-lethal quantities of alcohol were consumed. When John Lodge resigned his Magdalene tutorship in 1836, his pupils subscribed 130 guineas for a gift of silverware. An undergraduate of 1840 recalled that S.W. Waud, who taught Mathematics, would invite students to \"have a problem or two and an oyster and cigar.\"[71] Charles Kingsley was an undergraduate from 1838 to 1842 and, no doubt helped by Waud's oysters, he did manage some solid studying and a great deal of deep thinking. It was probably his fellow Magdalene men he had in mind when he deplored student commitment to \"the excitement of animal exercise\" devoted to cricket and hunting. \"Every moment which is taken from them for duty [i.e. church attendance] or for reading is felt to be lost\".[72] College historians have rightly deplored the transformation of Magdalene in these years into \"an academy for idle but aristocratic young men\", but it is not easy to see what other strategy might have been pursued. The College lacked resources to buy in talent on any large scale through scholarships, and its location, beside an open sewer and at the heart of a rough commercial district, both pointed to exploitation of its social connections, with the concomitant lowering of demands that this implied. The trick would be to combine the privileged finishing school with the small but worthy core of serious scholars. As the century wore on, so the College increasingly failed the challenge.\n\nOf course, we should beware of judging the privileges of Audley End by modern standards. Patronage was part of the way of life: in almost every Anglican parish, the right to appoint the incumbent was a piece of property, although the extension of the principle to the Mastership of a college rendered Magdalene invidiously unique.[73] And there could have been less intellectual patrons than the Braybrookes. The third Baron had presided over the publication of the diary of Samuel Pepys. The fourth Baron had conducted the first excavations of major Roman sites in the Cambridge area, although modern archaeologists, with their far superior techniques, may perhaps wish he had not. They were an erudite family, with a sense of humour: Latimer Neville's mother suggested that the Latin word for that inconvenient fashion item, the ladies' bustle, should be \"superbum\".[74] Although, like most landowning families, they were staunch Conservatives from the eighteen-forties, they had earlier supported liberal causes, including the extension of civil rights to Catholics: hence, it would seem, the admission to Magdalene of the future Cardinal, Charles Acton, in 1819.\n\nIn addition, devotees of C.P. Snow will appreciate that academics do not always make rational decisions when choosing their own heads: alleged murky electoral practices in 1851 condemned St Catharine's to decades of disapproval. Some, at least, of the Audley End choices were more imaginative than the contemporary fellowship would have contemplated.[75] It might be said of successive Masters so eccentrically parachuted into Magdalene that when they were good, they were very, very good, but when they were bad, they were horrid. Even the problem of the two Reverend Mr Nevilles was not that they were appointed when they were ridiculously young, so much as the absence, in Magdalene as in every other college, of provision for retirement.[76] George Neville-Grenville was only in his early sixties when he resigned, but his health had been broken for some years; Latimer Neville died in 1904 at the age of 76. It was not entirely his fault that the preceding decade marked a gloomy phase for Magdalene, but it was too much to expect an ailing and ageing man to turn around a disastrous situation.[77] (As argued throughout this paper, it may also misleading to back-project the grim state of the College around 1900 to the undoubtedly livelier era of the eighteen-sixties.) Although he was Master for half a century, Latimer Neville left just one enduring (and even endearing) memorial of his long reign. It is the Pets Cemetery in the Fellows' Garden.[78]\n\nThus from Regency times to the dawn of Edwardian England, the College operated as a form of outdoor relief for a wealthy family: servants at Audley End innocently referred to it as \"the Magdalene\".[79] The monopolising of the Mastership by \"some Rev. Mr. Neville or other\" had two negative effects, one financial and the other social. For Cambridge colleges generally, the nineteenth century was not a great age of private munificence, but it was wholly unlikely that any benefactor would seek to shore up the endowment of an institution so blatantly run for private interests.[80] A vast amount of money passed through the College, in the form of sometimes obscenely wealthy undergraduates, but little of it was gifted or bequeathed to the institution. The aristocratic aura of the Audley End connection led Magdalene to be perceived as a select and fashionable institution, the favoured preserve of students from privileged backgrounds. For a College mired in a neighbourhood of stench and seedy deprivation, such a social revolution seemed possible only at the cost of accepting low standards, in matters both academic and disciplinary.\n\nEducation, education, education\n\nTo understand how this happened, and how damaging it was to Magdalene's institutional image, it is necessary to examine two aspects long-vanished aspects of Victorian Cambridge, the University's core academic curriculum and the mobility of undergraduates between colleges. To talk of low standards for admission to the University is in one sense irrelevant. All students spent their first year and part of the second preparing for a kind of retrospective entrance test, a mishmash of Classics and Mathematics, officially known as the Previous Examination, but generally referred to as the Little-Go.[81]\n\nIn theory, weaker students could repeat attempts to pass the Little-Go indefinitely although, even at Magdalene, those who found it too much for their limited skills generally left the University altogether. (Some of Parnell's contemporaries, for instance, had almost certainly never intended to stay the course, but were simply at Cambridge to sample the lifestyle.) Thus the question of differential academic standards between colleges only entered at the point of failure to clear this first academic fence. Trinity terminated the residence of those who could not pass their Little-Go; Magdalene was thought to be more easy-going. But ─ and here was the second distinctive feature ─ unlike modern Cambridge, to be sent down from one's college was not to be thrown out of the University. Students could \"migrate\", usually to smaller but not necessarily less demanding alternatives. Magdalene was not unique in this: Sidney Sussex was described in 1852 as \"almost a colony of second-rate Johnians\".[82] For the smaller and poorer colleges, accepting \"migrants\" was a well-established lucky-dip strategy which might just pay large dividends. The typical inter-college migrant was described by Leslie Stephen as \"a piece of damaged goods ... an idle youth, who has promised to work harder in future\".[83] Examination results indicate that some did just that.\n\nIt is worth noting that in earlier decades, Magdalene had benefited from inter-college migration. In the thirty years before 1853, the College gained seven students who went on to First Class Honours, the most notable of them being Charles Kingsley, who transferred from Trinity soon after arriving in 1838.[84] Unfortunately, from the middle of the eighteen-fifties ─ the start of the Latimer Neville era ─ the impact of such migration upon Magdalene was not very positive academically and probably counter-productive socially. In modern terms, the system provided a form of \"second-chance\" education, but nowadays we should link that concept with the priority of widening access to university study. Magdalene operated rather as last-chance saloon for the upper classes. In the later decades of nineteenth-century, for instance, it was claimed that \"men were never sent down for not passing their 'Little Go' and as long as they were decent and respectable members of society, they were allowed to stay as long as they liked.\"[85]\n\nWhen Latimer Neville died in 1904, the Spectator published a surprisingly caustic obituary, identifying the late eighteen-sixties as \"a time when if a man were requested, in consequence of persistent failure to pass examinations, to withdraw from another College, he was cheerfully permitted ─ at any rate, if he possessed the right social qualifications ─ to find refuge at Magdalene.\"[86] Indeed, the process had taken hold well before Parnell's time. By the eighteen-fifties, around half the new entrants to Magdalene each year were refugees from other colleges. \"Overwhelmingly the migrants were ex-Etonians and ex-Harrovians from Trinity.\"[87] The most famous of them was Jack Hall, who transferred his allegiance a few months after arriving in Cambridge 1854, from Trinity to Magdalene, where he spent seven energetic years. Four times he rowed against Oxford, and for two successive years he was President of the Cambridge University Boat Club. College tradition recalled that Jack Hall \"was compelled to remain an undergraduate for seven years owing to difficulties with his examiners\".[88] In fact, the young Etonian who had stumbled at the mild hurdle of the Trinity entrance examination did eventually graduate from Magdalene, although it took him until 1862, and his degree studies were obviously pursued as a cover for athletic enthusiasms.[89] Hall was a prominent figure, and his memory may have stimulated subsequent generalisations. In fact, the academic refugees who washed up on Magdalene shores generally seem to have left Cambridge altogether within a few terms, but some did indeed survive to graduate. Another notable example was John Brownrigg, also an Etonian. The son of an army officer who moved around the Empire, Brownrigg had an address in Dublin when he entered Trinity in 1860. He had won a modern languages prize at school, so it was presumably his Mathematics that tripped him up at Trinity. He switched to Magdalene in 1861, rowed in the Boat, but also won a scholarship and gained a distinction in the History certificate offered by Kingsley in association with his lectures. Brownrigg went into the Church and served for many years as secretary to the National Society, which ran Anglican primary schools, before acquiring one of the most delightful titles in the Church of England, Dean of Bocking. In 1928, at the age of eighty-five, he was guest of honour at the Boat Club centenary dinner.[90]\n\nApplications to Trinity soared after 1861, when the Prince of Wales spent a year unofficially attached to the college, and this may account for an increase in admissions to Magdalene: less hopeful candidates were cutting their losses and heading straight for the comfort zone that the Master of Trinity cuttingly described as a \"transpontine refuge for fallen undergraduates\".[91] But whether through the well-trodden path of \"migration\" or the strength of the shared Eton background, there was a clear Trinity-Magdalene undergraduate network of wealthy young men, \"many persons of high family and considerable means\", as Sproston called them. On Guy Fawkes Night 1866, a Trinity aristocrat, the Marquess of Huntly, was beaten up by town roughs and left for dead in Sidney Street. The local bench called the assault \"gross\" but fined the chief assailant a mere ten shillings. With undergraduate opinion was outraged by this act of Town leniency, Lord Huntly \"mustered his friends of Trinity and Magdalene and wreaked a summary and satisfying vengeance\" upon his assailants, a much celebrated episode, and one which apparently did not call down any College sanctions upon his Magdalene supporters.[92] That same year, a penurious Trinity man and his fiancée were saved from a long engagement, thanks to a £10,000 gift from a friend in Magdalene. The young benefactor was said to command an annual income was £6,000 a year, about three times the notional rent roll at Parnell's Avondale, much of which was devoured by mortgages or earmarked for the support of family members.[93]\n\nIn a remarkably lame passage, the Students' Guide (it was written for students, not by them) insisted that \"those persons are not always to be believed who say that they got no good at Cambridge\" since it was \"possible that they learnt something without being conscious of it.\"[94] A notably unconscious example was Harry de Windt, who came up to Magdalene in 1876, \"did not learn much … at any rate of a profitable kind, but I certainly passed a remarkably pleasant time there\".[95] A.S. Wilson also doubted whether he gained much from his brief sojourn at Magdalene in the late 'eighties: \"I did not do much work and rather thought it a waste of time.\" However, he did fine-hone his skills at playing baccarat, and his role in exposing the 1891 Tranby Croft card-sharping scandal brought the College much negative publicity.[96] Latimer Neville was committed, as he stated during Parnell's first term, to \"promoting that high tone which I am glad to say, has been generally characteristic of Magdalene.\"[97] Essentially, it was a philosophy that accepted that the rich would always be with us, and that the role of Magdalene was to contribute some veneer of humanity and culture to those who would exercise authority within society. It was a view that was still occasionally voiced within the College one hundred years later.\n\nMagdalene's relative poverty made it difficult to provide the financial support necessary to recruit serious students. By the eighteen-sixties, Leslie Stephen could write of Cambridge scholarships in terms redolent of the modern football transfer market. \"The price of good undergraduates has risen fearfully\". A £50 scholarship would hardly secure a future Second Class Honours graduate while a potential First Class student \"turns up his nose at anything under seventy\", with meals and rooms thrown in.[98] Magdalene could not compete at this level. In 1867, the College offered three entrance scholarships for open competition, one worth £60 a year, the others just £40 and £20.[99] In Parnell's first year, one of his more studious contemporaries defected to a scholarship at Christ's. The Student's Guide for 1874 illustrates how Magdalene's poverty placed the College at a disadvantage. Scholarships (some of them called exhibitions) were generally based on endowments, and either open to all applicants or reserved to particular schools. Some eccentric provisions had survived earlier reforms: Corpus Christi had a scholarship for men called Colman, Trinity for kinfolk of a benefactor called Podmore. These restricted scholarships were not always awarded: Pembroke explicitly reserved the right to treat them as open to all if no qualified candidates presented. Nor did closed scholarships necessarily assist wider social access to the University: King's had 24 for Eton, at a generous £80 a year, plus rooms, tuition and \"commons\" (basic food). Caius had four awards linked to Harrow. Some colleges, such as Queens' and Sidney Sussex, dipped into general revenue to create additional scholarships where need and merit coincided. Magdalene's only venture of this kind was the funding in 1835 of a scholarship for applicants from King's College, London, a gesture of support for its Anglican identity. The award bore fruit in bringing Charles Kingsley to Cambridge, but in 1850 it was bizarrely extended to include candidates from Eton, hardly a priority access issue. Later, it was abandoned altogether.[100] Another form of subsidised study was the sizarship, cut-price admission to Cambridge officially ear-marked for poorer students. The institution was dying out in the second half of the nineteenth century, but sizars remained a feature of St John's which, in 1888, had fifty one of them.[101] Magdalene appointed one a year.\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that the greater the proportion of students in any college partly dependent on scholarships (which could be withdrawn for academic failure or on disciplinary grounds), the more likely the institution would foster a studious atmosphere. Magdalene offered twelve open scholarships, three at a minimum of £60, but six offering a baseline amount of no more than £20. Until 1882, Tripos (Honours) examinations were held in fourth year, so that in a normal cycle, only three awards were available. By contrast, colleges with similar undergraduate numbers were financially able to tilt the balance towards subsidised studiousness: Sidney Sussex and St Catharine's each maintained twenty-six Scholars. Christ's was one of several colleges to allocate its scholarships not through entrance tests, which favoured well-drilled schoolboys, but on the basis of internal first-year examinations. Corpus Christi even backdated its awards to the previous Christmas. Magdalene also had twelve awards limited to five schools: Halifax, Heversham, Leeds, Shrewsbury and Wisbech. Since these schools provided Magdalene with some of its best examination candidates, and it can be confidently assumed that more such financial pathways would have improved the overall academic record. In theory, if all the available Magdalene awards were in fact allocated, almost half the resident undergraduates would have been in receipt of some form of financial support from the institution ─ a calculation that may lend colour to the hypothesis of an academic but largely hidden Magdalene. Unfortunately, it is not easy to reconstruct these arrangements for the mid-nineteenth century. Far too often, it seems that Magdalene's Scholars graduated only with Pass degrees.[102]\n\nAs a College located in an undesirable area of the town and lacking resources to buy in talent, Magdalene had little alternative to adopting a relaxed attitude both to admission standards and to student behaviour. High concentrations of undergraduates from wealthy backgrounds posed particular problems of discipline. The public schools were mounting a steep curve of reform, but in many respects they remained anarchic boy republics loosely contained by the threat of brutal punishments. When prosperous young men made the transition to a system where discipline was based upon fines rather than flogging, they were inclined to take a relaxed approach to regulations. \"Magdalene was a little oasis of idleness and insubordination to University rules and regulations\", de Windt recalled, \"more like a club than a college\".[103] One example of open defiance of the University's authority was horse-racing. In December 1866, the Vice-Chancellor and the heads of every college, including Latimer Neville, formally reiterated the University's ban on undergraduate participation in steeplechases. In Cambridge, there were many regulations of which the average student was totally unaware, but this one was no dead-letter formality. In April 1867, undergraduates packed the Senate House and howled their protests at the Vice-Chancellor when the ban was announced yet again. None the less, most members of the College \"would drive over to Cottenham for the steeplechases where Magdalene produced a large proportion of the winning riders\".[104] A notable example was Cecil Legard, who rode in an Oxford-Cambridge steeplechase in 1865 and was twice winner of the Cottenham Whip. Two years ahead of Parnell at Magdalene, he was ordained in 1868. Although the dignity and authority of the University was set at nought, there is no indication that Latimer Neville and his donnish colleagues ever took any action.[105] Not surprisingly, the disapproving American, William Everett, called Magdalene \"a favorite home for young men who are of the opinion, either from conjecture or experience, that other colleges are too strict for them.\"[106]\n\nGiven that Parnell's departure from Cambridge resulted from disciplinary action, Magdalene's attitude to undergraduate misbehaviour is of some importance. College discipline was lax, but it could also seem arbitrary, indulging many areas of misconduct but penalising others. When Latimer Neville died in 1904, the Cambridge Review tactfully observed that \"his rule was mild ─ some might think too mild\", adding that \"he always had a compassionate view of undergraduates' shortcomings, though when occasion required he could be stern enough.\" Neville had a Victorian cleric's horror of inebriation and fornication, and he was \"absolutely rigid\" in enforcing compulsory attendance at morning and afternoon Chapel on Sundays. But the Master did at least enforce some rules (he was fiercely opposing the keeping of dogs in College[107]), even if they do not now seem the most obviously beneficial. Essentially, he did not seem to appreciate that there was a problem. \"I unhesitatingly affirm that the undergraduates of this College are as well conducted as those of other Colleges,\" he wrote in 1891, \"that the discipline maintained is precisely the same, & that the University officers who are well acquainted with such matters will corroborate my assertion.\"[108] The senior Fellow, Mynors Bright, who deputised during the Master's frequent absences (Neville doubled as a country clergyman) may have made matters worse by signalling that he was simply going through the motions. \"Even when he dealt with a delinquent undergraduate for some breach of order or discipline, his lips might speak winged words of surprise, disappointment, and warning, but there was something that 'gave him away'\".[109] If the issue of discipline in Magdalene was partly one of perception, it is not wholly surprising that the Fellows felt that they had no alternative but to come down heavily on Parnell, not so much for fighting as for incurring unfavourable publicity. It is equally not surprising that Parnell claimed that the College's draconian response to his escapade in Station Road was unfair and discriminatory.[110]\n\nIn 1891, no less a personage than the Lord Chief Justice of England, Coleridge, observed that Magdalene \"enjoyed the reputation of not being the slowest College\" in Cambridge. When Latimer Neville protested that his comments \"do this College great & undeserved injury\", Coleridge explained away his remarks as the general impression of an outsider. \"I have heard now & then of Magdalene, always as the College of men of family & fortune, in fact of gentlemen, but I have heard of it as an expensive & what at Oxford we should have called a 'fast' College.\"[111] There was much to support his view, but the downside of this engaging fantasy was that it focused upon one assertive and favoured section of the undergraduate population, encouraging them to claim as the embodiment of the entire College community. They, in turn, came to feel that they were entitled to impose their norms upon everybody else. It was this aspect of the Magdalene identity that would make the College a less than ideal environment for the young Charles Parnell.\n\nThe view of Magdalene in the eighteen-sixties as a recreational community of gilded youth is splendidly conveyed through the rose-tinted reminiscences of Samuel Sproston, published in the College Magazine in 1910.[112] Sproston entered Magdalene in 1867, won a scholarship but managed to achieve only an undistinguished Third in the Classical Tripos of 1871.[113] His anecdotage offers some precious glimpses into Magdalene student life, not least because he briefly overlapped with Parnell, whom he recalled with evident distaste. But his evidence needs to be handled critically. Anyone who writes about an undergraduate education forty years later may be forgiven for stressing the eccentric over the humdrum. Moreover, Sproston was a more complicated personality than his preposterous snobbery would suggest. After graduation, he followed a conventional path to ordination as an Anglican clergyman. For a decade and a half he served as a curate in working-class areas of Bradford and London before securing a country living in Gloucestershire. A year later, he abandoned this snug clerical berth and converted to Rome.[114] The golden haze of his recollections perhaps compensated for a subsequent period of spiritual turmoil.\n\nSproston's account of his admission to Magdalene is engaging, but it is also misleading. He was lobbied by a former Shrewsbury schoolfellow, a Welshman called T.E. Jones, who was entering his third year at Cambridge. \"Jones set forth with much zeal and loyalty the particular advantages of his own college, dilating on the exploits of Magdalene men in that 'Annus Mirabilis' of the College, 1866.\" The order in which Sproston listed these achievements is revealing: a rowing blue, three members of the University cricket team, the Cambridge billiards champion and the top steeplechaser. \"There was, too, a First in the Classical Tripos\". When Sproston arrived at Cambridge railway station as an expectant freshman, he encountered Jones emerging from another carriage accompanied by a third Shrewsbury student, whom he had diverted from Oxford at the last moment. The last-minute capture was triumphantly introduced to the College by Jones, \"whose word was taken for his entire eligibility.\" To Sproston, the episode was \"an example of the easy way in which things went at Magdalene in those days. So informal an admission could hardly have been secured at any other College.\"[115] But the sparkle of Sproston's reminiscence should not lead us into uncritical endorsement of his conclusion. The primary requirement for admission to Cambridge was a good grounding in Latin and Greek: Cambridge accepted responsibility for teaching Mathematics since English schools were notoriously deficient in the subject. Shrewsbury was the country's leading classical school: the mighty Benjamin Hall Kennedy, author of the celebrated Latin Primer, had left the headmastership two years earlier to become Professor of Greek at Cambridge. Mynors Bright, who was in charge of admissions at Magdalene, was a product of Shrewsbury himself. A few minutes informal conversation would have been enough to satisfy himself that Jones's latest capture would be capable of handling Little-Go Classics. Sproston had no way of knowing whether Magdalene was uniquely casual in its procedures. Several of the smaller Cambridge colleges were hard-pressed to attract students. By contrast, Magdalene enrolments were unusually buoyant in the late eighteen-sixties.[116]\n\nA Magdalene College Community?\n\nConventional academic wisdom held that one advantage of the smaller colleges was that they functioned as integrated social communities. \"The smaller the College is, the more likely it is that all its members ... will be acquainted with one another, if there be no marked disparity of previous education to keep them apart\", remarked the Student's Guide, the qualification being a coded reference to barriers of class and wealth. \"The diffident will thus find themselves introduced into a society ready formed for them; those of less culture, or force of mind or character, will benefit by the superior average of their neighbours; at any given time, something of a common tone, both social and moral, will prevail in the whole society of a moderate-sized College\".[117] But Magdalene may never have conformed to the pattern and, far from being \"superior\", its \"common [i.e. communal] tone\" was too easily dominated by the rich, assertive and idle. When A.C. Benson became a Fellow forty years later, he found it \"sharply demarcated into young men of wealth and sporting tastes, keeping hunters and living a life that was anything but studious, and a few scholars of a different type, holding scholarships attached to certain provincial grammar-schools, so that there was no coherence or social unity about the place.\"[118] In fact, Magdalene's admissions record for the calendar years 1860-9 suggests a more nuanced picture. Over half the 189 undergraduates did indeed come from public schools, but of these only 26 were from Eton and 11 from Harrow. Shrewsbury, a more middle-class institution and with a strong Classics tradition, provided 20. There were 46 entrants from other public schools, some of them new and not-yet fashionable institutions, such as Rossall, whose products were rarely in the same social league as Etonians. The hardest category to define consisted of the 57 men described as \"privatim institutus\" (privately educated). Some, like Parnell himself, had attended only small private schools, but others seem to have abandoned fruitless experience at public schools to prepare for university through crammers. The 29 undergraduates from traditional grammar schools formed the smallest category. At an average entrance of three a year, they were likely to have felt isolated, even though numerically they equalled the Etonians.[119] The sense of College identity was hijacked by the wealthy undergraduates, the confident, born-to-rule young men, who ignored and even denied the existence of any other version of Magdalene. \"I suppose there were reading men,\" de Windt recalled, \"… but I never saw them.\"[120] E.R. Yerburgh, who came to Magdalene on a tight budget in 1879, shortly after de Windt, was a product of Rossall. He quickly found that \"the College was a distinctly fast one. More than half of the men were people of large means ─ some of great social position who would be unlikely to want to know me. The rest of the College was chiefly made of men from small Grammar Schools who were not men of my own social position.\"[121] The acerbic Spectator columnist of 1904 regarded the presence of young men from North of England grammar schools at Magdalene as the \"quaintest anomaly\", and thought it particularly unfair that they should be trapped in \"a pleasant residential sporting club for well-to-do and more or less well-descended young men\".[122] There were two Magdalenes, but one was not always very visible.\n\nThe Way We Live Now: An Eighteen-Seventies Downturn?\n\nIn asking how far the Spectator-Benson Two-Magdalenes theory applied to the College during Parnell's time at Cambridge, we need to consider indications that Magdalene went into accelerated decline during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Hence, we cannot simply back-project all evidence of its shortcomings during the final decades. The crucial stage of the downturn perhaps came in the middle years of the eighteen-seventies. Two contrasting events symbolise the transition. As late as 1875, a Magdalene candidate, A.G. Peskett, headed the Classical Tripos. As discussed below, major examination successes virtually ceased for about a decade and a half after Peskett's triumph.[123] In November 1876, during the Michaelmas Term, a second-year undergraduate, William Hoole, was killed in a riding accident. The son of a Sheffield manufacturer, accorded a gentlemanly veneer by another new public school, Wellington, Hoole was master of the Cambridge Drag Hounds and steward of the Harston steeplechases. At a steeplechase meeting in Huntingdonshire, he failed to tighten the girth of his saddle and broke his neck in a fall. One of the witnesses at the inquest was the Honourable Gilbert Henry Chandos Leigh, a Harrovian who had briefly entered Trinity Hall in 1871 before migrating to Magdalene, where four years later he had secured a Pass degree. In 1876, as he told the inquest, he was \"of no occupation\", but he became a member of parliament in 1880, four years before also falling to his death, this time in a Wyoming canyon.[124] Among the prosperous classes, social values were changing. As the Students' Guide noted in 1874, \"the general style of living in England is more luxurious than it has ever been, and children are brought up in habits which would formerly have been considered self-indulgent.\" As a result, \"young people\" had become \"easy going in money matters, and careful of personal comfort.\"[125] Anthony Trollope's 1875 novel, The Way We Live Now, reflects concern that ethical standards were slipping too. If there was indeed a change of gear towards an even more laid-back Magdalene, it may be associated with the retirement of Mynors Bright, who had been Parnell's Tutor, in 1873, leaving his Mathematics lecturer, G.F. Pattrick, in charge of admissions. Bright had been a Fellow for a decade before the appointment of Latimer Neville, Pattrick was moulded in the Master's image. Offering him a Tutorship in 1865, Neville had assured him that \"this appointment will prove beneficial to the College, not only in its vocational aspect, but also in promoting that high moral tone which, I am glad to say, has been generally characteristic of Magdalene.\" Accepting, Pattrick pledged himself \"to maintain the high traditional tone of the college\".[126] In practice, the \"vocational aspect\" of Magdalene very much took second place to its social exclusiveness. Yerburgh believed that Pattrick \"wished to make the College a force in Cambridge by attracting men of position and wealth. I fancy that he wished the College to depend more on its social position than on a reputation for scholarship or athleticism.\"[127] He gave brief evidence to confirm identity at the inquest into Hoole's death, but apparently was not asked to explain how a young man in statu pupillari came to be riding at a race meeting on a weekday during termtime.[128] Purnell's generous comment that Pattrick's \"kindness and tact ruled the College without friction\" perhaps signals that he was unduly indulgent to Magdalene's gilded youth.[129] No doubt it was true, as \"A Magdalene Man of the Early 'Seventies'\" protested to the Spectator in 1904, that Pattrick \"cared for the welfare of poor scholars, as well as of richer undergraduates\".[130] However, the legend that a Magdalene undergraduate \"drove his own coach through the gateway, round First Court and out again\" dates from Pattrick's Tutorship.[131]\n\nThe increasingly haughty exclusiveness of Magdalene's riding men in the eighteen-seventies manifested itself in a new contempt even for other sportsmen. Sproston, who rowed in the May Boat in 1870 and 1871, recalled that they had supported the oarsmen, and even occasionally taken to the river themselves. But this rapidly altered, and at about the time as the Magdalene culture generally changed gear as Pattrick succeeded Bright. The history of the Magdalene Boat Club noted that from the early eighteen-seventies, the riding fraternity \"would have nothing to do with the boat.\" De Windt, who arrived in 1876, recalled that \"to row or even play cricket was to be ostracized by the right set\".[132] By Yerburgh's time, a single student, the Etonian and prominent oarsman J.A. Watson-Taylor, functioned as \"the connecting link between the rowing men and the hunting men.\"[133] An example of this blinkered exclusiveness is Yerburgh's dismissal of the brothers \"Red\" and \"Black\" Waller. \"They were enormously rich and enormously vulgar ─ the sons of a London builder. No one would have anything to do with them in Magdalene, so they made friends outside College.\"[134] \"No one\" here has a precise and narrow meaning: Thomas Waller rowed in the Lent races in 1881; John Waller was captain of the Boat Club in the summer of 1880. Once again, the prejudices of the \"right set\" were imposed as the attitude of the entire College community. It did not trouble the equestrian set that Magdalene was not allowed on the river at all for the May races of 1874 and 1875. In 1876, a Boat Club meeting reconvened as the Magdalene Football Club ─ another unfashionable sport. Magdalene continued throughout the eighteen-eighties to have one of the weakest crews on the Cam: through a series of years into the early 'nineties, its Lent Boat was bumped on twenty-four consecutive occasions. In 1889, the Club captain, elected in absentia, refused to do anything, and had to be ousted at the last minute. His successor launched an intensive four-day training programme before announcing that the Boat would not enter the races. \"Mr Pattrick was in a frightful state\".[135] Another measure of the 'seventies downturn seems to have been the flourishing of private dinner parties. \"No dinners or suppers are allowed in the College except by an order from one of the tutors,\" Warter had reported to the Royal Commission in 1851. Giving evidence, he had explained that Magdalene had abandoned its former practice of marking attendance in Hall, as a deliberate policy of improving the quality of food meant that \"the men rarely absent themselves.\"[136] Everett noted that Magdalene was famous for its \"luxurious table\", while Sproston did not mention private parties.[137] Yet, a decade later, de Windt recalled that \"[t]here was a dinner party somewhere nearly every night.\"[138] \"In my time, we hardly ever dined in Hall,\" wrote Yerburgh, \"... we used to dine in each other's rooms.\"[139] The size of student rooms limited the numbers taking part. Yerburgh recalled groups of four. A precious photograph from around 1910 shows eight young men, their garb of evening dress incorporating striped blazers that probably indicated some sports team.[140] The practice of private dining could only contribute to cliquish exclusivity.\n\nSince it was generally acknowledged that it was difficult for small colleges to achieve major academic success, Magdalene's mid-nineteenth century record in the University's two major Tripos subjects, Mathematics and Classics, had been mildly satisfactory, with twelve Firsts between 1852 and 1867.[141] In 1861, the College notched one of its most notable (if, it seems, quickly forgotten) triumphs: John Bond, a product of Heversham, one of its Northern feeder schools, came out second in the Mathematical Tripos and was also runner-up in the Smith's Prize, the University's most prestigious Mathematics competition.[142] Gunton's First in 1867, the addendum to Sproston's \"annus mirabilis\", was one of three others in that decade. Gunton had also won no fewer than three University medals for Latin verse in 1865 and 1866.[143] A further cluster of seven Firsts spanned the years from 1871 through to Peskett's success in 1875.\n\nAlthough there were two isolated Firsts in Classics in 1879 and 1880, overall the decade from the mid-seventies to the mid-eighties was academically blank: in 1878, only one Magdalene candidate appeared in any Tripos list. The Magdalene malaise was palpable. The University was expanding: the 530 matriculations of Parnell's year, 1865, had almost doubled by 1887, when they broke the thousand mark for the first time. Other colleges were building, yet Magdalene remained static ─ and, after 1888, would actually decline in numbers. In 1883, Mynors Bright bequeathed £5,000 to build a Tutor's residence ─ a useful project, for celibacy had been abolished the previous year. It proved impossible to agree a site in Magdalene's limited patch, and Bright's Building did not rise until 1909. The college also failed to respond, except negatively, to the changing University environment. In 1869, King's decided to admit only candidates who intended to read for Honours. New Tripos subjects joined the elite duo of Mathematics and Classics. A Magdalene candidate had taken a First when Natural Sciences began in 1851, but b y 1880, only six others had blazed that trail, all of them unspectacularly. The Historical Tripos was launched in 1875: the first Magdalene candidate achieved a Third in 1890. A second historian emulated his feat in 1906. No Magdalene candidate appeared in the Law Tripos between 1878 and 1893, although members of the College probably continued to read for Bar. Other new Honours subjects were Moral Sciences, Oriental Languages, as well as Mediaeval and Modern Languages ─ admittedly, none of them overcrowded with students ─ but, also, none of them patronised from Magdalene. In the mid-century, a fire was \"constantly kept up during the daytime\" in the College Library, and favoured undergraduates allowed keys to give them access. \"This is a privilege, which is found to be of great benefit, and of which the undergraduates gladly avail themselves.\"[144] It seems that the Library was valued as a place of study rather than as a source of knowledge. Mid-century Honours teaching was based almost entirely on set books and lectures, so it did not matter that Magdalene treated its Library as a historical collection and had no acquisitions programme. By the late eighteen-eighties, the Library \"was only visited from motives of curiosity.\" Cobwebs covered the \"bare, uncarpeted, unattractive rooms\", and a detached door had been deposited against one of the bookcases, obscuring its contents.[145] By the time Benson inspected the Library in 1904, it was clear that even the fire was seldom lit.[146] Magdalene was conspicuously failing to keep abreast of educational change. For instance, from 1879, the Classical Tripos included questions on the history and culture of the ancient world,[147] while new subjects like History and Moral Sciences were more likely to draw upon library resources than textbooks.\n\nYet there are faint signs of a revival in the later eighteen-eighties, with eight Firsts between 1888 and 1896. In 1888, as many as eight undergraduates were classed in the Tripos lists, a multitude not achieved since 1854. Between 1891 and 1896, after a twelve-year gap, four students entered for Natural Sciences. However, they may simply have been encouraged by the opening of an additional University laboratory in 1889 ─ Magdalene, unlike Sidney, had made no attempt to provide experimental facilities of its own.[148] The Firsts may also have been random flickers of light in the overall darkness. Perhaps the phenomenon merely represented what stock markets call a dead-cat bounce: even a collapsing institution may recover slightly from its lowest point. If there was a revival, its driving force is hard to identify. The influence of Wilfred Gill, junior Fellow since 1880, may have been a factor, but Pattrick remained the sole Tutor until his death in 1896. (Gill's premature death two years later was another loss to the College.) Magdalene was already in the earlier phases of a prolonged financial crisis, which not only ruled out new initiatives but meant that existing Fellowships had to be left vacant: no new Fellows were elected between 1880 and 1897. However, while limitations on the range and quality of teaching that a small college could offer constituted handicaps to outstanding academic success, although it was possible to buy in lecturers to cover the core curriculum: in the late eighteen-eighties, Magdalene briefly employed Alfred North Whitehead, the Trinity mathematician and philosopher, but he was not a success as a teacher. High flyers, especially in Mathematics, sought paid coaching outside their colleges.[149] Thus Magdalene's instructional imitations represented a challenge but not necessarily an unsurmountable obstacle to examination success. Financial pressures worsened throughout the eighteen-nineties, and the association of the College with the Tranby Croft baccarat scandal could hardly have helped. Over nine hundred new students enrolled in the University of Cambridge every year throughout the 'nineties. In Magdalene, matriculations fell to a low point of thirteen in 1898. With College rooms now vacant, lower enrolments meant falling revenue, worsening the downward spiral.\n\nOverall, in late nineteenth-century Magdalene, the culture and atmosphere of the institution almost constituted the major handicaps to high achievement. In the forty years from the middle of the eighteen-fifties to the mid-eighteen nineties, around seven hundred students were admitted to Magdalene. Of these, in the years 1860 to 1898, twenty-four can be identified as having graduated with First Class Honours ─ a disappointing three percent of the total.[150] Even more striking was the absence of the major schools and the landed classes from the intellectual elite.[151] Two of the Firsts were won by former pupils of Shrewsbury, but the remainder came overwhelmingly from unfashionable backgrounds, some of them from Leeds and Heversham, North country grammar schools with traditional links (and scholarships) to Magdalene, but others from schools in places such as Batley, Bishops Stortford, Colchester, Great Yarmouth, Huddersfield, Lancaster, West Kirby and Wolverhampton. Closely examined, Magdalene does indeed appear to have been demarcated as Benson described it, a College in which small enclaves of unfashionable studiousness were disdained or ignored by rich young men determined to have a good time. But while we can justifiably identify toxic attitudes of social exclusiveness and anti-intellectualism as consistently negative themes, it is still important to bear in mind that the emphases varied from decade to decade. The Magdalene of Peckard and the Evangelicals had been eclipsed, but it still maintained a flickering survival, in the attic rooms and the examination halls.\n\nMagdalene in the Eighteen-Sixties\n\nIf ─ as it argued ─ there was a downturn in the social culture of Magdalene in the eighteen-seventies, it is important to establish how strong a sense of community had existed in the previous decade, the time when Parnell encountered the College culture. Writing of the late eighteen-sixties, Sproston recalled that the fifty-odd undergraduates of his time \"naturally grouped themselves into two main divisions\", and we might expect that he, too, saw Magdalene as split, however unequally, between the social and the academic. In fact he divided his contemporaries between \"those who gave their minds and energies to horse and hound and those who sought recreation and muscular development on the river.\" However, in Sproston's memory, \"there was no very distinct border-line between the two sets\", for some of the rowing men were \"straight riders across country and good shots, while useful oarsmen were forthcoming from time to time among the riding fraternity.\" The two groups also supported each other's sporting ventures: Boat Club stalwarts defied academic authority to support Magdalene jockeys at Cottenham, \"and every man in the College was zealous for its aquatic success.\" However, this was not to say that Magdalene was one big happy family of ecumenically minded sportsmen. \"Unfortunately there were in residence in the Sixties a few undergraduates, mostly sons of monied [sic] parvenus from the North of England\", Sproston grumbled, who \"tried to liken themselves to country gentlemen, and succeeded in looking like stable-boys.\" But even though they were \"the least desirable section of the College ... it was probably better for them to be at Magdalene than elsewhere, for in any other College their money might have given them an unworthy prominence, and made them leaders of a pseudo-sporting set\". As it was, they found themselves in an environment where \"their highest aspiration was to resemble those, who were obviously their betters\". And if Sproston was an appalling snob, he was at least a fair-minded one, conceding that \"by assiduous imitation, they sometimes ended by becoming fairly good copies of the genuine article.\"[152] It may be some defence of Sproston's preposterously snooty world that Magdalene's social elite seem to have co-opted at least some of the College's moneyed parvenus ─ unlike King's twenty years later, where a feud between old and new rich erupted in violence in 1889.[153] As will be discussed later, Sproston did acknowledge the small cluster of poor and serious-minded students ─ missed entirely by de Windt ─ but numbered them at no more than three or four.\n\nThe young Parnell did not fit comfortably into Sproston's world. Two of his companions in Station Road on the night of the celebrated fight that led to his departure from Cambridge were from the north of England. Far from being \"zealous\" for the College's \"aquatic success\", Parnell refused even to subscribe to the Boat Club ─ probably for the simple reason that he did not have the money. Reviewing his own four years at Magdalene, Sproston could not recall \"more than, at the outside, three or four genuine loafers, men ... who were keen about nothing.\" Although he could not bring himself to utter the hated name, it was obviously Parnell whom he had in mind when he added that \"one of these, strange to say, afterwards acquired considerable eminence in a career which in a special degree demanded energy and activity.\"[154] Sproston's memoir suggests a picture of a young Parnell out of sympathy with the sprigs of the English elite, associating himself with the provincial parvenus whom the fashionable young men despised as \"the least desirable section\" of the College. But even this vivid glimpse of a long-lost undergraduate community may not tell the whole story. Sproston's arrival at Magdalene in October 1867 meant that his first two years coincided with Parnell's long period of absence from Cambridge. The two men overlapped for a few weeks in April and May of 1869. Sproston was a keen oarsman, Parnell played cricket. Sproston was heading for Honours in Classics, Parnell was probably gearing himself to tackle the Pass degree in Engineering. The two young men had neither the opportunity nor, one suspects, much inclination to get to know each other. And Sproston's invocation of Magdalene shared one major weakness with the common perception of the College. It took one section of the undergraduate community and imposed their identity and their priorities upon the image of the whole. A reconstruction of Magdalene College in Parnell's time suggest that we can equally view it as a community that comprehended students from varying backgrounds and was capable of accommodating a range of personalities. While no amount of revisionism will ever succeed in portraying Magdalene as a major centre of intellectual activity, it may also be argued that Sproston's emphasis upon horse and hound and muscular development on the river does less than justice to an admittedly modest educational culture in the College.\n\nIndeed, although Sproston's memoir probably did not exaggerate the divisions within Magdalene, he may not have told the whole story. Each year, during February, several colleges organised sports days, taking turns to hire Fenner's cricket ground which, in those days, was equipped with a running track. In some years, Magdalene was among them although, it seems, not while Parnell was in residence: the 1866 Magdalene Sports were postponed due to bad weather and apparently never took place,[155] and there is no report of any such event in 1867, when he was in residence. However, a substantial competition organised in February 1869 suggests that some level of shared social activity existed within the College. It is unfortunate that Parnell was not in residence at the time, for he enjoyed watching athletics. In 1877, he took a break from the House of Commons to watch the Irish champion, Dan O'Leary, win a walking race, and impishly bribed the band to strike up God Save Ireland after they had officially closed the proceedings with the National Anthem.[156] Had he been in Cambridge, he might well have turned out for the event, if only to cheer Percival Hoole, with whom he seems to have been friendly, who entered for the half-mile. The 1869 Sports were organised by a three-man committee of second-year undergraduates, two of whom had been at school at Rossall and the third at Bromsgrove. These were educationally impressive independent schools: Rossall had established a notable record for winning Oxford and Cambridge scholarships since its founding in 1844, while Bromsgrove was one of thirteen founder-members of the Headmasters' Conference in 1869. But neither institution could rank alongside establishments such as Eton or Harrow in social prestige. Evidently, middle-class Magdalene men felt entitled to articulate their own version of a College identity. Nineteen Magdalene undergraduates can be identified as taking part in events that day, probably around one-third of the resident student body ─ and there are indications that others were spectators (there was \"a good attendance\") and perhaps ran in unrecorded scratch races. The Boat Club did not enter an eight for the Lent Term races, and this may explain why five rowing men took part, but there was also a Harrovian riding man, Edward Dalglish, later \"a well-known steeplechaser\". Most of the participants came from unfashionable schools, although two Etonians deigned to compete. It is odd that Sproston seems not to have remembered that February day when he penned his snobbish memoir forty years later, for his victory in the mile race, one of the main events, surely represented a high point in his own college career. Dalglish struck out from the start, attempting to set a fast pace and force other competitors to drop out. But he had probably drawn deep on his energies in the earlier 880 yards, and when Sproston overtook him at the end of the first lap, he retired from the race. Sproston in turn was challenged by Bernard Sheppard, like himself a clergyman's son heading for ordination, who had come to Magdalene in 1867 after preliminary study at King's College, London. Sproston shook him off and won by twenty yards, in a time of five minutes, twelve and a half seconds.[157] Overall, we may conclude that, in some years, and through some activities, Magdalene was capable of generating some form of collective social culture, driven by young men from the margins of the social elite.\n\nOf course, it is tempting to qualify the picture of an element of genuine community spanning a sizeable section of the Magdalene community with the reservation that Parnell himself may have been entirely alienated from it, as suggested by John Howard Parnell's recollection that his brother \"got on badly with the other fellows [sc. 'chaps']\".[158] Yet one newspaper report of action for assault against him on 21 May 1869 stated that Parnell \"was accompanied by hosts of friends\".[159] This may have been, as I attempted to explain it away in 1974, \"a demonstration of college solidarity\".[160] However, another shred of evidence suggests that the presence of Parnell's student cheer-squad represented something more than an amusing way to fill in an aimless day. Throughout that week ─ the case was heard on the Friday ─ the village of Chippenham, fifteen miles north-east of Cambridge, was hosting a cricket festival, sponsored by the squire and entertained by the brass band of the Huntingdonshire Militia. The Magdalene eleven had agreed to take part in a match scheduled for Thursday 20 May, but \"on the morning of the match\" the team \"sent an apology for not being able to come\".[161] This violation of gentlemanly courtesy could only be explained by some sudden imperative, and it is tempting to assume that the cricketers thought Parnell's case might be called that day, and decided not to risk being out of town when their moral support was needed. By great good fortune, a Gate Book for 1867 survives in the Magdalene archives. This is a ledger in which the porter recorded the arrival times of undergraduates returning to College after the curfew hour of ten o'clock at night. On 26 May, a College Meeting (the modern term is 'Governing Body') decided to rusticate Parnell, that is, to send him away for the remainder of the term. The Gate Book reveals that some, at least, of his fellow-students decided to give him a send-off, probably in the form of a dinner at a Cambridge inn. Parnell and three of the revellers returned to College after three o'clock in the morning. Four more rolled in after four o'clock. A few years earlier, such blatant absenteeism would certainly have provoked serious sanctions, a fine of two shillings and sixpence for coming in after two o'clock, plus an automatic requirement to stay an extra week in College to \"keep\" (i.e. formally register residence for) the term. Possibly by 1869, the rules had been relaxed, but the celebration does look like an act of defiance.[162] The record throws only an oblique shaft of light on the concept of a College community. The seven students who accompanied Parnell could hardly have known him, since all were freshmen, and five of them had only recently arrived in Magdalene and do not appear to have commenced serious study (if they ever did). Two had played cricket with him, against Trinity Hall on Parker's Piece three weeks earlier, none of them came from a fashionable school and several were clearly socially marginal ─ one was an American, another son of a plantation owner in St Kitts. A modest conclusion might suggest once again that there some sense of community among Magdalene students, if in shifting groupings and with varying depths of profundity. In this, the College was no different from most institutions, then and now.\n\nII: Magdalene College, October 1865\n\n\"Wise and Kindly Dons\"\n\n\"Something happens to me always in October,\" Parnell remarked years later.[163] In October 1865, that \"something\" was Magdalene College Cambridge, where he arrived on the nineteenth.[164] When Parnell arrived in Cambridge in October 1865, he joined a community that consisted of a handful of (in Sproston's phrase) \"wise and kindly\" dons (as established academics were called) plus about sixty undergraduates. Of these, about a dozen lived out of College, either in lodging houses or because (in a very few cases) they were married men enrolled as mature students.[165] Although the society was small in numbers, we cannot say that all its members knew one another ─ the few fourth-year men, for instance, would have been intensively preparing for Honours examinations after Christmas ─ and, still less, that they liked one another.[166] None the less, a reconstruction of the College in Parnell's first term points to a broader range of personalities and backgrounds than might be expected from the mythic Magdalene of those who unflatteringly observed it from without or those who nostalgically memorialised it from distant memory.\n\nPresiding over the College was the Honourable and Reverend Latimer Neville, \"a good but decidedly dull man\",[167] the twenty-fifth Master of Magdalene in a line stretching back to 1544. While the antiquated Cambridge statutes required Fellows of colleges to be celibate, \"Heads of Houses\" possessed what Leslie Stephen impishly called \"the privilege, and almost the duty of taking a wife.\" Latimer Neville had married on being appointed in 1853, and was the father of a young family, the last of whom was born a few months after Parnell was dismissed from the University. In one of his splendidly waspish put-downs, Benson recorded that Neville's widow had regarded the College as \"a disagreeable sort of incumbrance on the Mastership\",[168] but Latimer Neville himself, although a remote figure, certainly cared about the institution entrusted to his charge, even if his concern mainly took the form of resisting most changes in its character and administration.[169] The Nevilles lived in the Master's Lodge, but they did not reside there all the year. A pluralist, Latimer Neville combined the Mastership with another Braybrooke appointment, as Rector of Heydon with Little Chishill, adjoining parishes about twelve miles away in Essex.[170] Due ceremonial was observed to mark the movements of the Master. When Latimer Neville was in residence, the fine old timber gates in the entrance archway to First Court were flung wide open until ten o'clock at night. When he was away, they were closed, and ingress was only possible through the much smaller wicket gate. Mere mortal undergraduates had little contact the Master. In four years as an undergraduate, A.S. Ramsey was only once invited the Lodge, to have breakfast as part of a successful College cricket team. He was obliged to decline as the invitation clashed with a Tripos examination: it seems curious that the Master was so detached from the day-to-day life of Magdalene that he could have been unaware of one of the major landmarks in the academic calendar.[171] Undergraduates saw the Master in Chapel and when he dined in Hall, where he was part of the High Table set aside for senior members.[172] However, in the eighteen-sixties, he did summon students who failed to appear at the two Sunday Chapels to explain their absence. Those who offered \"solid and sound\" excuses would be granted \"a few minutes quite pleasant chat\", but those who could not were reprimanded and often \"gated\", a form of curfew that confined transgressors to the College precincts from an early hour. According to Leslie Stephen the archetypal Master \"sits solemnly upon certain boards which meet once a term to settle that no change need to be made in the University system\", devoting the rest of his time \"to studies of so abstruse a character ... that he seldom manages to bring them to a close within the term of his natural life\".[173] Latimer Neville conformed to the first image but not to the second.\n\nIf Latimer Neville was barely visible and not always present, the average undergraduate found that that the Master's second-in-command, Mynors Bright, \"touched him nearly and at every turn.\" Since Magdalene was short of money, Bright combined the offices of President and Tutor, the former making him deputy to the Master, indeed with a considerable measure of executive autonomy within the College, and the latter giving him open-ended responsibility for the welfare of undergraduates. (It is a peculiarity of Cambridge terminology that Tutors do not by virtue of their appointment engage in teaching, although they may also teach in some other capacity: Bright, for instance, was a distinguished Hebrew scholar and lectured to small numbers of students who wished to study the Old Testament.) Fortunately, Mynors Bright was \"an excellent man of affairs\", capable of conducting \"with punctuality, and sometimes at considerable length, the correspondence which his position as Tutor involved.\" (Parnell's younger brother Henry recalled seeing \"a courteous letter from his Tutor, Mr Bright\" urging Parnell to return to resume his studies after his rustication.[174]) With no secretarial support, he also \"wrote out with his own hand all the undergraduates' accounts\", a process that enabled him to monitor their lifestyles.[175] All of this was the more remarkable in that Bright was virtually immobilised by poor health. He was the son of a London physician, and undergraduate wisdom claimed with its habitual wisdom that their Tutor had been felled by the very kidney affliction that his own father had identified and named. In this, as so often, undergraduate wisdom was completely wrong, and a more likely story is that Bright fell ill after sleeping \"in a damp bed\" in middle life, which perhaps points to some form of rheumatic fever. (Bright was fit enough to row in the Magdalene Boat as late as 1841, a year after his election to a Fellowship.) Whatever the cause, \"he seldom left his rooms\", although \"on very rare occasions\" he would be carried out into the fresh air in a bath-chair, \"a pathetic little figure in a very old fashioned and very tall beaver hat.\" Indeed, there was something pithily pre-Victorian about Mynors Bright. \"He took an old-world view of life and his speech was marked on occasion by the picturesque and forcible forms of expression which were common in his younger days.\" It was characteristic of the man that his major research project was the complete revision of the original Braybrooke transcription of the diary of Samuel Pepys, although Bright's outspokenness did not extend to publishing the more salacious passages.[176] Measured by contemporary standards, Mynors Bright was a major scholar and he seems a"
