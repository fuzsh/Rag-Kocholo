He is an elected Fellow of the American Association of Geographers; a recipient of the Alexander and Ilse Melamid Medal (American Geographical Society), and the 2018 Distinguished Alumnus of the Year at the University of California (Riverside). His general research interests encompass three areas of emphasis: energy and society, energy and land use, and renewable energy development. His current research concentrates on the social acceptance of renewable energy landscapes and recycling of energy landscapes. He has served two Arizona governors as chair of the Arizona Solar Energy Advisory Council, and he was as a founding member of the Arizona Solar Center. He serves on 10 editorial boards, including Energy Research & Social Science. He is the ASU liaison to the International Renewable Energy Agency, headquartered in Abu Dhabi.\n\nProfessor Pasqualetti offers several energy classes, including The Thread of Energy, Energy in the Global Arena, Energy and Environment, Solar Energy Policy, and Recycling Energy Landscapes. He co-founded and was twice elected president of the Energy and Environment Specialty Group of the American Association of Geographers. In addition, he has served as an advisor to the U.S. Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Resources for the Future, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Council, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Arizona Energy Office.\n\nProfessor Pasqualetti has published books on wind power, renewable energy landscapes, the geography of energy, nuclear power plant decommissioning, and landscape evolution, as well as more than 100 articles and book chapters on energy and environment topics. He has worked in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, the United Kingdom, Turkey, the Czech Republic, Palestine, Oman, Israel, China, Singapore, Guyana and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nEducation\n\nPh.D. University of California-Riverside 1977\n\nM.A. Louisiana State University-Baton Rouge 1969\n\nB.A. University of California-Berkeley 1967\n\nVideo\n\nResearch Interests\n\nRenewable energy\n\nEnergy/water nexus\n\nEnergy landscapes\n\nEnergy and society\n\nEnergy education\n\nPublications\n\nEnergy Democracies for Sustainable Futures, Academic Press, 2022.
