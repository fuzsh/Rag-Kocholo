        "text": "Engineering\n\nIn 2004, Smith College made history when 19 women graduated as part of the first class of engineers ever from an all-women’s ABET-accredited engineering program. The reasons to study engineering at a women’s liberal arts college are compelling. As a creative endeavor at the intersection of design, science and mathematics, engineering draws on nearly all aspects of the human experience, including history, politics, economics, arts and societal aspirations. The work of engineers both exacerbates and solves some of our gravest societal problems, including climate change, disease, resource limitations and conflict.\n\nVisit the Engineering Moodle page for program information, resources, and more.\n\nRequirements & Courses\n\nGoals for Majors in Engineering\n\nThe Picker Engineering Program has adopted the seven student learning outcomes suggested by ABET. For each learning outcome, the engineering faculty have identified specific performance indicators that can be measured—there are two to three performance indicators for each learning outcome. The learning outcomes are as follows.\n\nAn ability to identify, formulate and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science and mathematics.\n\nAn ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental and economic factors.\n\nAn ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.\n\nAn ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental and societal contexts.\n\nAn ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks and meet objectives.\n\nAn ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.\n\nAn ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.\n\nEngineering Science, Bachelor of Science\n\nSmith offers an undergraduate curriculum leading to an ABET-accredited degree in engineering science, the broad study of the foundational scientific and engineering principles that govern the practice of all engineering disciplines. The bachelor of science degree program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. The American Society for Engineering Education, identifying the critical need for broadly educated engineers, points out that the design of an engineering curriculum should “recognize the pitfalls of overspecialization in the face of an increasing demand for graduates who can demonstrate adaptability to rapidly changing technologies and to increasingly complex multinational markets.” An integral component of the program is the continuous emphasis on the use of engineering science principles in design. This culminates in a final capstone design project that incorporates societal context and impacts. Students are encouraged to pursue an industry and/or research internship to complement their classroom instruction. Engineers must be able to communicate effectively and work in team settings. Smith’s highly-regarded writing intensive first-year curriculum ensures that engineering students begin their engineering curriculum with appropriate communication skills that will be refined during the remainder of their studies. Many engineering courses offered at Smith incorporate elements of teamwork and various modes of communication.\n\nRequirements\n\nEight credits of math from the following: MTH 111, MTH 112, MTH 211, a topic of MTH 264\n\nTwo additional courses in math: MTH 212 and PHY 210\n\nThree natural science courses:\n\nPHY 117 or PHY 119\n\nCHM 111 or CHM 118\n\nOne lab science (5 credits) from the following: PHY 118, PHY 119, CHM 118, CHM 222, CHM 224, BIO 130/BIO 131, BIO 132/BIO 133\n\nOne course on probability and statistics from the following: SDS 201,\n\nSDS 220 or MTH 246\n\nOne computer science course from the following: CSC 110, CSC 120, CSC 205/ MTH 205, CSC 210 or CSC 220\n\nSeven required engineering courses: A topic of EGR 100, EGR 110, EGR 220, EGR 270, EGR 290, EGR 374 and EGR 410D\n\nFive additional technical depth courses, chosen in consultation with the major adviser.\n\nAt least four out of the five courses must be engineering courses at the 300 level or higher.\n\nSpecial studies and honors credits can be counted toward this category by petitioning the department.\n\nA year-long capstone design course, taken in the senior year, that incorporates appropriate engineering standards and multiple constraints and is based on the knowledge and skills acquired in earlier course work. Students may satisfy the capstone design requirement through a design-based project with an individual member of the faculty (EGR 421D), or through a team-based industry or nonprofit-sponsored project (EGR 422D).\n\nLiberal arts breadth, one of the following:\n\nComplete Latin honors distribution requirements\n\nComplete requirements for another major or minor exclusively within Division I (humanities) or Division II (social sciences)\n\nA proposal, approved by the department, to fulfill the requirements for a minor that is not exclusively within Division I and/or II where a minimum of five proposed courses have a Smith College Latin honors distribution coding other than or in addition to N (natural science) and M (mathematics and analytical philosophy).\n\nCogent proposal, approved by the department, describing an alternative approach (e.g., concentration) including all courses the student will take to acquire curricular breadth, for consideration and approval by the engineering faculty in exceptional circumstances\n\nBook of Evidence requirement: Engineering majors must complete a book of evidence with a minimum of 17 approved artifacts.

The assessment and documentation of student outcomes and their corresponding performance indicators are critical components of a thorough ABET accreditation process.\n\nStarting in the spring of 2014, the Picker Engineering Program redesigned its methodology for the collection and assessment of evidence related to ABET criterion 3—student outcomes and their corresponding performance indicators. Specifically, the program moved to a book of evidence, with the goal of making the assessment process more transparent and student centered.\n\nThe student outcomes and corresponding performance indicators are mapped to all of our engineering courses.\n\nCourse Mapping Outcomes\n\nStarting with the class of 2015, B.S. engineering science majors were issued a notebook referred to as their book of evidence (BoE). The notebook was owned by the Picker Engineering Program and was housed within its administrative space. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Picker Engineering moved to an electronic approach for the Book of Evidence requirement. The new electronic approach relies on established book of evidence principles while transitioning from individual student book of evidence binders to individual student Electronic Book of Evidence (E-BoE) online folders. Students build their book of evidence by identifying meaningful work they have done that meets the individual performance indicators developed by the engineering faculty to assess the program’s ABET student outcomes. Completing a book of evidence with a minimum of 17 approved artifacts (one for each performance indicator) is a requirement for the B.S. in engineering science major. Some details include:\n\nEvidence for the BoE should come primarily from junior and senior year.\n\nMuch or all of the evidence will likely come through engineering courses, but evidence accrued through non-PEP courses, study abroad/away courses, and summer internship or research experiences may be considered.\n\nThe required artifacts must be graded work. B.S. students are welcome to submit additional artifacts.\n\nA performance vector classification is integrated into the evaluation of e-BoE artifacts. Performance vector information will enhance the assessment of e-BoEs and support evaluation of the extent to which student outcomes are being attained. An artifact from another Smith department must have the grade on it and will be evaluated by the Picker Engineering Assessment and Standards Subcommittee. An artifact from an internship or similar experience must come with a signature from the supervisor and will subsequently be evaluated by an engineering faculty member serving on the Assessment and Standards Subcommittee. An artifact from a study abroad/away course is required to have a grade from the abroad/away faculty on it and will be evaluated by the academic advisor who approved the course.\n\nProgress on a B.S. major’s e-BoE is connected to EGR 410D. May graduates are required to have a minimum of 14 faculty-signed artifacts uploaded to their e-BoE by the last day of finals for the fall semester and are required to have a minimum of 17 faculty-signed artifacts uploaded to their e-BoE by the last day of classes in the spring semester. January graduates, graduating in 2026 or later, taking EGR 410D are required to have a minimum of 14 faculty-signed artifacts in their book of evidence by the last day of finals in the spring semester they are taking EGR 410D and are required to have a minimum of 17 faculty-signed artifacts in their book of evidence by the last day of classes of their last semester.\n\nEngineering majors are encouraged to begin work on their E-BoE no later than their third year.\n\nDetailed guidance on how to submit artifacts is included in the E-BoE Resources subfolder found within each declared engineering major’s E-BoE Google folder and is also posted on the program’s Moodle site.\n\nBook of Evidence Infographic\n\nStudents with questions about the process may contact Martin Green, Assistant Director of the Picker Engineering Program.\n\nThe plan of study identifies the course work needed to complete the major and allows each student to document a path toward completing the major.\n\nStudents review, update and discuss their plan of study with their adviser each semester.\n\nSee the Forms heading under \"About the Program\" for all plan of study forms.\n\nThe Picker Engineering Program’s bachelor of science in engineering science is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org.\n\nThe Picker Engineering Program educational objectives and program outcomes have been developed with input from the faculty and advisory boards and are consistent with ABET Criterion 2 and 3.

We foster an inclusive community that welcomes diverse perspectives. Have a question? Contact egradmin@smith.edu. The following are some of the most frequently asked questions about the program.\n\nWhat engineering degrees does Smith offer?\n\nSmith College offers an accredited bachelor of science degree in engineering science (S.B.). The degree is offered for students who are thinking they would like to practice professionally as engineers. The S.B. is an ABET-accredited degree rooted in the fundamental engineering principles that govern all engineering disciplines. After completing a foundational set of core courses, students choose from a variety of electives to pursue an area of technical interest. An integrated curriculum of liberal arts, science, math and engineering courses provides the breadth and depth needed to think critically, act reflectively and make informed decisions.\n\nCan I specialize in one area of engineering?\n\nThe challenges of the 21st century require broadly educated engineers capable of working collaboratively and adaptively across disciplinary boundaries. To meet this need, Smith S.B. degree in engineering science provides a strong foundation in the fundamentals of all engineering disciplines. In pursuit of the S.B, students complete five upper-level technical depth courses. These courses, taken at Smith, the College of Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst or elsewhere, enable students to pursue an area of topical or disciplinary interest, such as electrical engineering or sustainable energy. These technical-depth courses are selected in close consultation with the student’s faculty adviser.\n\nWhat courses should a first-year student consider if they are interested in engineering?\n\nPlease refer to our document of specific advice for first-year students.\n\nWhat AP, IB, A-level exams does the program count towards its requirements?\n\nPlease see page 2 of the First Year Advising Resources. If a particular exam is not listed, then it does not count towards the requirements for engineering.\n\nCan I pursue a second major as an engineering student?\n\nIn addition to 13 engineering courses, the S.B. degree requires nine courses in the natural sciences, mathematics and computer science. As a result of this curriculum, and our commitment to a liberal education, it’s difficult to pursue a second major in math, computer science or a natural science. Pursuing a second major in a humanities or social science discipline is challenging but doable. For a deep interest in computer science, mathematics or natural science, a student could consider pursuing a minor in one of those areas.\n\nWhat do S.B. graduates do after Smith?\n\nSmith graduates have a range of choices. Picker Engineering Program graduates can be found across the globe, working in places such as Lockheed Martin, Tesla Motors, AIR Worldwide, Exxon Mobil, Boeing and the Department of Labor. The majority of graduates eventually pursue a graduate degree at places such as Berkeley, Brown, Cornell, Harvard, Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins and Princeton. The S.B. degree is also considered the first step toward becoming a licensed professional engineer. Undergraduates enrolled in ABET-accredited programs are eligible to sit for the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam, which is the first step in the process. More information about the FE and professional licensure is available at NCEES.\n\nWhat opportunities are there to study away?\n\nStudy abroad is an exciting opportunity, and many engineering majors find programs abroad that offer engineering courses. Because of the required course load, and the time required to become proficient in a second language, most students pursuing the S.B. study either in an English-speaking country or a country for which they already speak the local language.\n\nWhat is the Princeton Exchange?\n\nSmith College and Princeton University established an engineering exchange program to expose junior year students from both schools to different learning environments. The Princeton Exchange requires an application, due in January of a student’s sophomore year, and accommodates up to two students per year.\n\nWhat opportunities are there for internships in industry, government or nonprofit organizations?\n\nThe Lazarus Center for Career Development connects students with many paid internships and career opportunities. Additionally, Smith’s Praxis program funds students to work at substantive, unpaid summer internships related to their academic or career interest.\n\nIn their senior year, S.B. engineering students work in teams on projects sponsored by industry or government through our yearlong Design Clinic. Many of the companies that sponsor design clinic projects also seek students for internships and jobs after Smith.\n\nWhat opportunities exist for research with faculty?\n\nIndividual faculty members often involve students in their research. Students should inquire directly with faculty whose work interests them. Smith’s Summer Research Fellows Program (SURF) provides funding for students to pursue independent research in collaboration with a faculty adviser for 10 weeks during the summer. Two programs, STRIDE and AEMES, provide opportunities for first- and second-year students to work with faculty on research projects. Students are also encouraged to seek out NSF-sponsored REU programs (Research Opportunities for Undergraduates) at other colleges and universities throughout the country.\n\nFaculty\n\nJudith Cardell\n\nEngineering\n\nProfessor of Engineering\n\nGlenn Ellis\n\nEngineering\n\nProfessor of Engineering and Director of the Picker Engineering Program\n\nAndrew Guswa\n\nEngineering\n\nL.

Smith has established partnerships to facilitate exceptional opportunities, including access to Smith’s alum network as well as avenues for internships, research and employment that expose students to specific fields and let them complement their academic studies with practical experiences.\n\nSmith College and Boston University’s College of Engineering are pioneering a collaboration that enables Smith College students pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Science to gain early admission to the Master of Science programs in engineering at Boston University and access enriching research experiences at Boston University as undergraduates. The partnership with Boston University provides early admission and reduced tuition and fees for graduate school.\n\nThe College of Engineering has been Drexel University’s flagship school for over 100 years. The College of Engineering is recognized for its excellence in academics and research and its leadership in experiential education. Our partnership with Drexel University provides a lower tuition cost to Picker Engineering Graduates entering any of Drexel’s College of Engineering M.S. programs and an application process without fees or required GRE scores.\n\nDownload the information sheet for additional details.\n\nSmith College has partnered with Princeton University to establish an exchange program for junior year students that will expose students from both schools to vastly different learning environments and better prepare women to enter and succeed in the field of engineering.\n\nSmith Students\n\nAt Princeton, Smith students will be exposed to an engineering community that includes about 750 undergraduates (of about 4,600 total), 500 graduate students and 130 faculty members across six engineering departments: chemical engineering; civil and environmental engineering; computer science; electrical engineering; mechanical and aerospace engineering; and operations research and financial engineering. The course offerings and research facilities and opportunities are extensive.\n\nPrinceton Students\n\nAt Smith, Princeton students will have an opportunity to live and study in a community where small classes afford extensive opportunities for close contact and collaboration with faculty and peers in a curriculum that stresses integration with the liberal arts, and where 100 percent of the engineering students and over 60 percent of the faculty are women. The Picker Engineering Program has special strengths in biomedical engineering and engineering for sustainability.\n\nProgram of Study\n\nStudents will exchange in the spring semester of their junior year. The typical load is four courses at both institutions, though a course load of up to five can be accommodated. Students can choose from any of the courses offered at both institutions. Typically, a program of study would comprise two or three technical courses, junior independent work or a junior project course, and no more than one course in the humanities. Students are encouraged to carry out an independent research project during the term. Programs of study will be approved by advisers at Princeton and Smith.\n\nIndependent Research Project\n\nA visiting Smith student will be a member of the department that matches best with their primary interests. Smith students who choose to do an independent research project and who earn a semester average of a B+ or better will be invited to continue their independent research project into the summer between their junior and senior years in order to complete a substantial piece of research. The summer component of the visiting student’s research program would be supported by a stipend from the faculty member with whom the research is conducted. All visiting Princeton students will be a part of the Picker Engineering Program and are welcome to contact a faculty member directly if they are interested in pursuing an independent research project. Students may be directed to faculty members at Princeton or Smith to further explore research opportunities.\n\nAdmission\n\nPrior to applying for admission to the program, students must discuss course and research opportunities with their academic adviser or department representative, the Picker Engineering program assistant at Smith, or Princeton’s associate dean for undergraduate affairs of the School of Engineering and Applied Science. See the Forms page for more information and the application.\n\nApplication Deadline\n\nApplications from Smith students must be submitted by February 1 of the year before the intended exchange. If accepted, the Smith student must submit a leave of absence form to the junior class dean by December 1.\n\nVisiting the Campus\n\nA visit to the other campus in the fall term of the junior year will help facilitate exploring potential independent research projects and courses to be taken.\n\nTuition & Fees\n\nSmith College students accepted for the Smith-Princeton Exchange Program are charged their normal home college tuition and fees. These costs are paid to Smith College. Students on financial aid normally receive their regular assistance while on the exchange program.\n\nHousing and Student Life\n\nHousing is in Princeton University dormitories for juniors and seniors. Room and board charges will be paid directly to Princeton University.\n\nDining\n\nSeveral dining options exist, including purchase of a Princeton University dining contract, independent self-catering, and a possible membership in an eating club.\n\nTransportation\n\nStudents provide their own transportation to and from Princeton.\n\nCampus Exchange\n\nMembers of undergraduate engineering societies and departmental organizations play an active role in welcoming visiting students and involving them in the engineering community and undergraduate life at the exchange college or university.\n\nPrinceton Life\n\nWith the exception of varsity intercollegiate athletics, which are bound by strict NCAA rules, visiting Smith students are welcome to explore participation in all types of extracurricular activities that interest them.\n\nSmith Life\n\nNorthampton is a lively town of 30,000. Residential life at Smith is considered an important part of a student‘s education. Smith is committed to a co-curricular environment that enhances and enriches the academic program: residential living is an integral part of that education.\n\nMore Information\n\nSmith Contact\n\nContact Assistant Director Martin Green, 413-585-7516.\n\nSmith College Course Catalog\n\nSmith College Registrar/Academic Calendar\n\nPrinceton Contact\n\nContact Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs Peter Bogucki, 609-258-4554.\n\nPrinceton University Engineering\n\nPrinceton University Course Catalog\n\nPrinceton University Registrar/Academic Calendar\n\nThe relationship between Smith and Dartmouth’s engineering program goes back decades. A partnership between Dartmouth Engineering and the Picker Engineering Program streamlines the application process and provides scholarship support to Smith engineering graduates interested in pursuing a Master of Engineering Management at Dartmouth.\n\nDownload the Information Sheet below for additional details:\n\nTufts School of Engineering offers undergraduate STEM majors from Smith College an accelerated path to a master’s degree in one of 15 programs of study. The partnership with Tufts University provides a streamlined application process and lower tuition cost.\n\nThe College of Engineering at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst offers accelerated MS programs to Smith engineers. Engineering students with a GPA of 3.5 or higher will be automatically admitted, with no application fee and no need for GREs. These programs are currently offered in five fields of study, and details can be found at the 4+1 Accelerated MS Programs page.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe fund shall be used to support initiatives that will foster entrepreneurial spirit among students in the Picker Engineering Program\n\nWhat is Entrepreneurial Spirit?\n\nEntrepreneurial spirit comes in a variety of forms, but is typically marked by curiosity, creativity, resourcefulness, and resilience. People with entrepreneurial spirit frequently take the initiative to seek out and solve problems to improve the status quo. They are motivated by challenges, and have a willingness to take risks. Their efforts often (but not always) take the form of new business ventures that seek to add value to society.\n\nWho can apply for funding?\n\nIndividuals or teams of students who are engineering majors or minors. Proposals will be reviewed on a rolling basis.\n\nWhat can this fund support?\n\nDirect expenses (supplies, tools, travel, etc.) for an entrepreneurial project\n\nTravel to conferences or workshops\n\nSummer wages (must have a faculty advisor)\n\nHow to apply?\n\nSend a proposal to the program assistant (egradmin@smith.edu), who will pass it on to the review committee. Proposals should include\n\nBrief description of the activities and expected outcomes\n\nBudget\n\nTimeline\n\nName and contact information for one reference (faculty or staff; project supervisor, if appropriate)\n\nHow are funds dispersed?\n\nPurchases for supplies or equipment are made through a requisition form and direct payment by the program. For other expenses (travel, etc.), the student incurs an expense and works with the program assistant (egradmin@smith.edu) to submit receipts and reimbursement forms through Workday. If reimbursement presents a hardship, the student can work with the program assistant on other approaches.\n\nWhat are the reporting requirements?\n\n1 Powerpoint slide with photos\n\n1-page report of outcomes\n\nThe Picker Engineering Program recognizes the value of attending identity-based professional conferences for engineering, such as SWE, NSBE, SHPE, and others. As such, we provide financial support to engineering majors who wish to attend such conferences.\n\nWho can apply for funding?\n\nIndividuals or groups of engineering majors. Groups of students attending together will receive higher priority for funding, as peer-to-peer learning and collaboration can enrich the experience. Higher priority will also be given to students who have not previously received funding.\n\nWhat can this fund support?\n\nTravel\n\nFood and lodging\n\nRegistration fees\n\nHow to apply?\n\nSend a proposal to the program assistant (egradmin@smith.edu), who will pass it on to the review committee. Proposals should include\n\nName of the conference and web link\n\nDates of the conference and dates you plan to attend\n\nNames of students\n\nBudget (include supplemental support from other sources if appropriate; if you are not proposing to use the $1000 of funding per person per year that is available though the SGA and Lazarus Center, please explain why)\n\nExplanation of how you meet the expectations regarding preparation, economy, and reporting (described below)\n\nExpectations\n\nOver the years, we have found some best practices to get the most out of these conferences. As such, students must meet these expectations to receive funding.\n\nCommitment to preparation for the conference, such as preparing a resume or elevator pitch, reviewing companies who will be attending the job fair, working with the Lazarus Center, etc.\n\nCommitment to being economical; examples include sharing rooms, seeking low-cost transportation, etc.\n\nSharing elements of the experience upon return; examples include giving a presentation in an engineering forum or other format, making a video about your experience and what you learned, drafting a memo that can be shared with other engineering students, etc.\n\nHow are funds dispersed?\n\nThe primary form of access to funds is via reimbursement. The student incurs an expense and works with the program assistant (egradmin@smith.edu) to submit receipts and reimbursement forms through Workday. If reimbursement presents a hardship, the student can work with the program assistant on other approaches.\n\nDesign Clinic\n\nDesign Clinic is a two-semester course in which students collaborate in teams on actual applied design projects sponsored by real clients in industry and government.\n\nApplied Design at Smith\n\nThe Picker Engineering Program\n\nDespite its central importance in society, engineering stands virtually alone as a professional degree with a small and declining participation by women. The Picker Engineering Program addresses this problem by using the resources and expertise of a women’s college to create a positive learning environment for women to study engineering. The program offers a supportive learning community, a flexible curriculum and female role models, exploring societal contexts in problem solving using pedagogies that increase engagement and address problems in engineering education.\n\nSmith’s liberal arts environment enables students to contextualize engineering in the framework of bigger societal questions and to think in different ways as they collaborate on interdisciplinary teams. The program is learner-centered in its curriculum and pedagogy. Students work closely with faculty to design individualized plans of study that address both their learning goals and the technical requirements of the profession. Research-based teaching helps students to develop a deep and integrated understanding of engineering concepts and to work creatively to generate new theories, products and knowledge.\n\nSee what students have to say about their experiences."
