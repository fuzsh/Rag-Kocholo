        "text": "The internal anatomy of a prehistoric creature the size of a poppy seed has been revealed in âastonishing detailâ.\n\nResearchers used powerful X-rays to scan the 520-million-year-old fossil.\n\nThe results, published in the journal Nature, external, reveal its microscopic blood vessels and nervous system.\n\nIt is a peek inside the body of one of the earliest ancestors of modern insects, spiders and crabs.\n\nLead researcher Dr Martin Smith said this was a dream fossil, in part because it was preserved in its larval, or immature, stage - when its body was still developing.\n\nâLooking at these early stages really is the key to understanding how those adult [body shapes] are formed - not just through evolution but through development.\n\nâBut larvae are so tiny and fragile, the chances of finding one fossilised are practically zero â or so I thought.â\n\nDr Smithâs colleagues found the fossil in a pile of âprehistoric gritâ during a study of half-billion-year-old rock deposits in the north of China known to contain microscopic fossils.\n\nâOur collaborators in China have large amounts of this stuff, which they dissolve it in acid and these little bits fall out,â Dr Smith said.\n\nA team of technicians at Yunnan University spent years sifting through the material and picking fossils out of the dust.\n\nAfter examining this particular specimen under the microscope during a trip to China, Dr Smith said, he had realised it was âsomething very specialâ and asked if he could bring it back to the UK to have a closer look.\n\nThe team mounted the fossil on the head of a pin in order to scan it with intense X-rays at Oxfordâs Diamond Light Source, external facility. That is where its internal secrets were revealed.\n\nâWhen I saw the amazing structures preserved under its skin, my jaw just dropped,â Dr Smith said.\n\nResearchers generated three-dimensional images of miniature brain regions, digestive glands, a primitive circulatory system and even traces of the nerves supplying the larvaâs simple legs and eyes."
