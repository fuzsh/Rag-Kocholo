I am striving to achieve my ultimate dream.....playing college basketball. I would like to be the best teammate possible and strive to make our team better. I am working hard now on my own to improve my game by workouts in our basement, driveway, playing with my AAU team, and attending a PGC camp. I am very eager to see what the future will bring to the table."
