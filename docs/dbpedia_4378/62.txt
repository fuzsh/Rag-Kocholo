Oxford Blues‚Ä¶AND Pinks. The colors of Pembroke College Oxford‚Äîwhere I studied in the early 90‚Äôs‚Äîand which celebrated its 400th Anniversary yesterday. Was so fantastic to be there with my bestie Kirkland Newman Smulders and our classmate Tim Griffin, now Attorney General of Arkansas. It was a particular privilege to participate in the Festival of Research with fellow alumni and Fellows of the College, including speaking on a panel moderated by Andrew Pitt on AI Opportunites & Impacts, along with Ingmar Posner & Rebecca Williams. Also very cool to eat in Hall once again, but this time with my picture on the wall(!)‚Ä¶not at all reflective of my somewhat underwhelming academic performance thereü§∑üèª‚ôÄÔ∏è. While at Oxford, also got to attend the first ever and most excellent University of Oxford Cyber Forum, hosted by the European Cyber Conflict Research Initiative & Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford. Big thanks to my dear friend Ciaran Martin for the invite and the fun chat. Thanks as well to Dean Ngaire Woods, Max Smeets, Brianna Rosen, Roxana Radu and the many others who organized the event. In addition to beautiful Oxford, I spent a day in London and caught up with our teammates at the National Cyber Security Centre, including Felicity Oswald OBE; got a fantastic tour of The Shard from Andrew D.; and met with US Ambassador Jane Hartley to discuss our ongoing collaboration with UK on cybersecurity. Very special thanks to the incredible Julie Johnson, our first ever CISA attach√© for her leadership and support throughout my trip and over the past two years.
