For the palace in Hama, Syria built by the same client, see Azm Palace (Hama). Al-Azem Palace (Arabic: قصر العظم) is a palace in Damascus, Syria, built in 1749.Al-Buzuriyah Souq in the Ancient City of Damascus, the palace was built in 1749 to be the private residence for As'ad Pasha al-Azem, the governor of Damascus; during the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, it housed the French Institute. After being purchased by the Syrian government from the Al-Azem family and undergoing several reconstruction works, the palace now houses the Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions. History The northern facade of the courtyard The palace was built during the Ottoman era over the former site of a Mamluk palace as a residence for the governor of Damascus, As'ad Pasha al-Azem during the reign of Sultan Mahmud I. Serving as a joint residence and guesthouse, the palace was a monument to 18th-century Arab architecture. While touring Damascus in 1898, Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany visited the palace. The courtyard and garden of the palace The palace remained in the ownership of the Azem family until 1920, when the palace was sold to the French.haremlek was purchased for 4000 gold pounds (after 1958 the currency unit name in English changed from \"Lira\" to \"Pound\").Great Syrian Revolution, the French government shelled Damascus to put down the rebellion, and the old quarter of Damascus was shelled which caused extensive damage to the palace, as the main reception room, the private baths and the roofs were all set on fire while the walls were destroyed. Following reconstruction, the French government used the palace to house the newly created French Institute, and Michel Ecochard, who worked in reconstructing the site, was commissioned to design a new house for the director of the institute. Although fairly modern, the new building blended perfectly into the 18th century walls of the palace. Upon Syrian independence in 1946, the French Institute was dissolved and evacuated from the building and the house was returned to the Azem family, The palace received the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 1983.

The structure consists of several buildings and three wings: the harem, the selamlek and the khademlek. The harem is the family wing, which contains the private residences of the family and includes the baths, which are a replica of the public baths in the city on a smaller scale. The selamlek is the guest wing, and it comprises the formal halls, reception areas and large courtyards with traditional cascading fountain, while in the northern part of the palace were the servant quarters and the center of housekeeping activities. One of the palace's most interesting parts is the hammam, or baths. It is composed of a succession of small rooms and narrow corridors leading to the main steam room in the heart of the building.hammam is the main marble-floored reception hall, and behind it is a second, smaller courtyard with a number of rooms now used to display various traditional crafts such as glass, copper and textiles. Used in the building of this palace were several types of stones including limestone, sandstone, basalt, and marble, chosen to provide a natural decoration. The ceilings have painted wooden panels that display natural scenes. Dr. Andrew Petersen, director of Research in Islamic Archaeology at the University of Wales Lampeter states that the use of ablaq (alternating courses of white limestone and black basalt) in this building is “A characteristic of the monumental masonry of Damascus.” * Ablaq * Azem Palace (Hama) Media related to Azem Palace at Wikimedia Commons Coordinates: 33°30′37″N 36°18′25″E / 33.51028°N 36.30694°E\n\n44139334_0\n\nDatix\n\nRLDatix is a global enterprise software company offering software and services tailored to healthcare organizations.

Having Gibraltarian status alone, and not being resident in Gibraltar, is insufficient criteria to obtain a Gibraltar Passport. Gibraltar passports are issued by the Passport Office of the Gibraltar Civil Status and Registration Office. Since 2005, passports issued in Gibraltar have been biometric. As a result of the British Nationality Act 1981, Gibraltarians were made British Overseas Territories citizens by default, but could apply for registration as a British citizen (\"an entitlement that cannot be refused\") under section 5 of the Act before 2002. Despite not being British citizens prior to 2002 and hence having no automatic right of abode in the United Kingdom, all BOTCs connected to Gibraltar have enjoyed the right to live and work in the EEA countries (including the United Kingdom itself) since 1973 through the territory’s accession to the European Community along with the United Kingdom, and their Gibraltar passports have borne observations to demonstrate such treaty rights. Under the British Overseas Territories Act 2002, all British Overseas Territories citizens have become British citizens on 21 May 2002. Therefore, a Gibraltarian may apply for either a passport describing them as a British citizen or a passport describing them as a BOTC. However, unlike other BOTCs, Gibraltarians cannot hold both passports simultaneously, and a BOTC passport would be cancelled if its holder decides to apply for a British citizen passport at any time. Until 31 January 2020, Gibraltarians who opted for the BOTC passport were considered \"UK nationals for EU purposes\", making them full citizens of the European Union with all consequential rights and entitlements. Following the UK's withdrawal from the EU, Gibraltar is no longer part of the EU and Gibraltarian BOTCs ceased to be EU citizens, although they continued to enjoy the same rights in the EU during the transition period until 31 December 2020. On 31 December 2020, the governments of Spain and the UK announced that Gibraltar will become a part of the Schengen area. Similar to those of the UK, new Gibraltarian passports will be blue. However, the timescale for their introduction has not been confirmed.

Differences\n\n16715440_1\n\nGibraltar variant British passport\n\nDifferences British passports issued in Gibraltar differ from UK issued ones only in some of the wording but otherwise have the same status. The word \"Gibraltar\" is added beneath \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" and on the information page. The only other difference is that Gibraltar-issued passports replace the mention of Her Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State with The Governor of Gibraltar: The Governor of Gibraltar requests and requires in the Name of Her Majesty all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance, and to afford the bearer such assistance and protection as may be necessary. Changes to the passport's wording, replacing \"Her Majesty\" with \"His Majesty,\" will be undertaken following the death of Queen Elizabeth II.

While the term \"Lakhmids\" has also been applied to the ruling dynasty, more recent scholarship prefers to refer to the latter as the Naṣrids. The Nasrid dynasty authority extended over to their Arab allies in Al-Bahrain and Al-Yamama.Khosrow II deposed and executed Al-Nu'man III, the last Nasrid ruler, his Arab allies in Najd rose in arms and defeated the Sasanians at the battle of Dhi Qar, which led to the Sasanians losing their control over Eastern Arabia.Battle of Qadisiyya in 636 and the Muslim conquest of Persia. Nomenclature and problems of Lakhmid history The nature and identity of the Lakhmid kingdom remains mostly unclear. The ruling Nasrid family emerges with \"Amr of the Lakhm\", mentioned in the late 3rd-century Paikuli inscription among the vassals of the Sasanian Empire. From this, the term \"Lakhmid\" has been applied by historians to the Nasrids and their subjects, ruled from al-Hirah. However, as historian Greg Fisher points out, there is \"very little information about who made up the people who lived in or around al-Hirah, and there is no reason to suppose that any connection between Nasrid leaders and Lakhm that may have existed in the third century was still present in the sixth, or that the Nasrids ruled over a homogeneous Lakhmid kingdom\".Byzantine—start dealing with the Lakhmids in greater detail only from the late 5th century, as well as by the relative lack of archaeological work at al-Hirah. History The ruins of a building in al-Hira, the Lakhmids' capital city,\n\n716794_5\n\nLakhmids\n\nA Persian manuscript from the 15th century describing the constructing of al-Khornaq Castle in al-Hirah. The Lakhmid Kingdom was founded and ruled by the Banu Lakhm tribe that emigrated from Yemen in the second century.Imru' al-Qais (not to be confused with the poet Imru' al-Qais who lived in the sixth century) is claimed to have converted to Christianity.Theodor Nöldeke noted that Imru' al-Qays ibn 'Amr was not a Christian,Irfan Shahîd noted a possible Christian affiliation, suggesting that Imru'al Qays' Christianity may have been \"orthodox, heretical or of the Manichaean type\".funerary inscription of Imru' al Qays ibn 'Amr lacks Christian formulas and symbols. Imru' al-Qais dreamt of a unified and independent Arab kingdom and, following that dream, he seized many cities in the Arabian Peninsula. He then formed a large army and developed the Kingdom as a naval power, which consisted of a fleet of ships operating along the Bahraini coast. From this position he attacked the coastal cities of Iran - which at that time was in civil war, due to a dispute as to the succession - even raiding the birthplace of the Sasanian kings, Fars Province. Imru' al-Qais escaped to Bahrain, taking his dream of a unified Arab nation with him, and then to Syria seeking the promised assistance from Constantius II which never materialized, so he stayed there until he died. When he died he was entombed at al-Nimarah in the Syrian desert. Imru' al-Qais' funerary inscription is written in an extremely difficult type of script. Recently there has been a revival of interest in the inscription, and controversy has arisen over its precise implications. It is now certain that Imru' al-Qais claimed the title \"King of all the Arabs\" and also claimed in the inscription to have campaigned successfully over the entire north and centre of the peninsula, as far as the border of Najran.\n\n716794_6\n\nLakhmids\n\nTwo years after his death, in the year 330, a revolt took place where Aws ibn Qallam was killed and succeeded by the son of Imru' al-Qais, 'Amr. Thereafter, the Lakhmids' main rivals were the Ghassanids, who were vassals of the Sasanians' arch-enemy, the Roman Empire. The Lakhmid kingdom could have been a major centre of the Church of the East, which was nurtured by the Sasanians, as it opposed the Chalcedonian Christianity of the Romans. The Lakhmids remained influential throughout the sixth century. Nevertheless, in 602, the last Lakhmid king, al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir, was put to death by the Sasanian emperor Khosrow II because of a false suspicion of treason, and the Lakhmid kingdom was annexed. It is now widely believed that the annexation of the Lakhmid kingdom was one of the main factors behind the fall of the Sasanian Empire and the Muslim conquest of Persia as the Sasanians were defeated in the Battle of Hira by Khalid ibn al-Walid.Kufa, its exhausted twin city. According to the Arab historian Abu ʿUbaidah (d. 824), Khosrow II was angry with the king, al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir, for refusing to give him his daughter in marriage, and therefore imprisoned him. Subsequently, Khosrow sent troops to recover the Nu'man family armor, but Hani ibn Mas'ud (Nu'man's friend) refused, and the Arab forces of the Sasanian Empire were defeated at the Battle of Dhi Qar, near al-Hirah, the capital of the Lakhmids, in 609.Iraqi city of Kufa. Lakhmid dynasty and its descendants Main article: 8th century in Lebanon The founder and most of the rulers of the kingdom were from the Banu Lakhm dynasty. Many modern \"Qahtanite\" dynasties claim descent from the Lakhmids such as the Mandharis of Oman, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates, the Na'amanis of Oman, and the Lebanese Druze Arslan royal family.\n\n716794_7\n\nLakhmids\n\nLakhmid rulers # Ruler Reign 1 'Amr I ibn Adi 268–295 2 Imru' al-Qays I ibn 'Amr 295–328 3 'Amr II ibn Imru' al-Qays 328–363 4 Aws ibn Qallam (non-dynastic) 363–368 5 Imru' al-Qays II ibn 'Amr 368–390 6 al-Nu'man I ibn Imru' al-Qays 390–418 7 al-Mundhir I ibn al-Nu'man 418–462 8 al-Aswad ibn al-Mundhir 462–490 9 al-Mundhir II ibn al-Mundhir 490–497 10 al-Nu'man II ibn al-Aswad 497–503 11 Abu Ya'fur ibn Alqama (non-dynastic, uncertain) 503–505 12 al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man 503/5–554 13 'Amr III ibn al-Mundhir 554–569 14 Qabus ibn al-Mundhir 569–573 15 Suhrab (Persian governor) 573–574 16 al-Mundhir IV ibn al-Mundhir 574–580 17 al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir 580–602 18 Iyas ibn Qabisah al-Ta'i (non-dynastic) 602–617/618 with Nakhiragan (Persian governor) 19 Azadbeh (Persian governor) 617/618–633 followed by the Muslim conquest of Persia Abbadid dynasty The Abbadid dynasty, which ruled the Taifa of Seville in al-Andalus in the 11th century, was of Lakhmid descent. In literature Poets described al-Hira as paradise on earth; an Arab poet described the city's pleasant climate and beauty thus: \"One day in al-Hirah is better than a year of treatment\". The ruins of al-Hirah are located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) south of Kufa on the west bank of the Euphrates.\n\n716794_8\n\nLakhmids\n\n* Kingdom of Hatra * Tanukhids * Christian Arabs * Zayd ibn Amr * Bosworth, C.

It is designed specifically as a system interface for TrueOS, and systems derived from Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) in general,Linux distributions. History Created in 2012 by Ken Moore, Lumina was initially a set of extensions to Fluxbox, a stacking window manager for the X Window System.Qt4, and had created a utility for \"launching applications and opening files\".codebase was integrated into the PC-BSD source repository by early 2014, and a port was added to the FreeBSD Ports collection in April 2014.source code has since been moved to a separate GitHub repository \"under the PC-BSD umbrella\" and converted to use Qt5.window manager integrated with the Lumina desktop. The project avoids use of Linux-based tools or frameworks, such as D-Bus, Polkit, and systemd. Features The desktop and application menus are dynamically configured upon first being launched, as the desktop environment finds installed applications automatically to add to the menu and as a desktop icon.Start menu, task manager, and system tray, and its location can be customized. Some features are specific to TrueOS, including hardware control of screen brightness (monitor backlight), preventing shutdown of an updating system, and integration with various TrueOS utilities. Utilities include: Insight, a file manager; File information, which reports a file's format and other details; and Lumina Open, a graphical utility to launch applications based on the selected file or folder. Version 1.4 included several new utilities.PDF reader lumina-pdf is based on the poppler library.Lumina Theme Engine replaced an earlier theme system; it enables a user to configure the desktop appearance and functionality, and ensures all Qt5 applications \"present a unified appearance\".

In 2005 Cushing was described as the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America, connecting the Gulf Coast suppliers with northern consumers. By 2007 Cushing held 5% to 10% of the total US crude inventory. Signs made of a pipe and valve on the major highways near town proclaim Cushing to be the \"Pipeline Crossroads of the World\", and the town is surrounded by several tank farms. Oil futures designated delivery point in the US On April 13, 2007, the now-defunct Lehman Brothers released a study which claimed that West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude at Cushing is no longer an accurate gauge of world oil prices.oil-storage trade heated up. Oil giant BP, and energy-transport and logistics firms Enbridge Energy Partners (an affiliate of Canada's Enbridge), Plains All American Pipeline and Energy Transfer LP own most of the oil storage tanks in Cushing. Oil storage became big business in 2008 and 2009, when the supply glut in the oil market led to situation where oil futures were higher priced than their spot price.Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Citicorp—turned sizeable profits simply by sitting on tanks of oil. On July 13, 2010, BP announced it will sell its assets in Cushing to Magellan Midstream Partners. In April 2020, it was lack of storage capacity at Cushing which turned WTI petroleum futures contracts negative for the first time in history. Cushing storage hub bottleneck\n\n72989695_3\n\nOil industry in Cushing\n\nCushing storage hub bottleneck The bottleneck at Cushing's giant storage hub distorted benchmark US oil prices for many years. In 2007 a large stockpile of oil at the facility was caused largely because Valero Energy Corp.'s McKee refinery near Sunray, Texas, was temporarily shut down.Ardmore, Oklahoma with Cushing's cheap crude oil. This should have resulted in boosting WTI prices which were discounted against Brent crude oil because of the glut. In March 2013 Valero Energy Corp.'s (VLO) McKee refinery in Sunray, Texas was closed for five weeks for planned maintenance. Seismic activity In October 2014 two moderate-sized earthquakes (Mw 4.0 and 4.3) struck south of Cushing, below one of the largest crude oil storage facility and gas pipeline transportation hubs in the world. The system also includes operational sections of the Keystone pipeline. On 6 November 2016, around 7:44 pm, a 5.0 MW earthquake rattled north-central Oklahoma. The quake was centered one mile west of Cushing.a 5.8 magnitude that hit Pawnee (25 miles from Cushing) in September. According to George Choy, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, Oklahoma has had a severe spike in earthquakes of 3.0 magnitude or higher since 2008. The number of 3.0 magnitude quakes rose from 2 in 2008 to 889 in 2015, according to USGS statistics. In 2016, there have been 572 (up to November). \"The oil companies have said for a long time that these are natural earthquakes, that they would have occurred anyway,\" Choy said, \"but when you look at the statistics, that argument does not fly.\" Analysis of the spatial distribution of earthquakes and regional moment tensor focal mechanisms indicated reactivation of a subsurface unmapped strike-slip fault.faults that could be triggered by oil and gas wastewater being injected deep underground.Coulomb failure stress change calculations indicated that the Wilzetta Fault zone south of Cushing could produce a large, damaging earthquake comparable to the 2011 Oklahoma earthquake at Prague, Oklahoma.\n\n72989695_4\n\nOil industry in Cushing\n\nMuch of the production, using new horizontal drilling techniques, produces at very high rates, with very high water-to-oil ratios. Thus many of the disposal wells, which re-inject the brine into underground formations, handle much more water at much higher pressures than has been common in other, often older, plays. When high volume, high pressure liquids follow the planes in some susceptible dormant faults, it frequently causes them to slip resulting in quakes. After the strongest earthquake in Oklahoma's history, at Pawnee, recorded at 5.8 on the Moment magnitude scale, concerns about the relationship between disposal wells and earthquakes caused state and federal regulators to respond by shutting down more than 50 disposal sites and wells across the state, considering their proximity to fault lines. * List of oil pipelines * List of oil refineries * List of oil spills\n\n25394470_0\n\nPokémon: Zoroark: Master of Illusions\n\nPokémon: Zoroark ー Master of Illusionsanimated adventure fantasy film directed by Kunihiko Yuyama. It is the thirteenth theatrical release in the Pokémon franchise. In the film, the businessman and media owner Grings Kodai plans to absorb the \"Time Ripple\" that appear in Crown City to renew his ability to see into the future, which will destroy the city's greenery. To help find the ripple, Kodai manipulate the news to have the city sealed off by using illusions created by Zoroark, a creature known as a Pokémon. Meanwhile, the Pokémon trainers Ash Ketchum, Dawn, and Brock accompany a Zorua to reunite it with its caretaker Zoroark. The film was released in Japan on July 10, 2010, by Toho. The English-language dub of the film premiered in the United States on Cartoon Network on February 5, 2011.Pokémon Black and White Tour in the United States. Plot Setting The film's fictitious setting is based on various locations in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Public Broadcasting's country, and Belgium. Among the locations Yuyama and his staff visited and have been used as inspiration for the movie were the Magere Brug, Amstel River, Kinderdijk, and Brussels, the city of Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie and Radio-Télévision belge de la Communauté française. Story Crown City once existed in perfect harmony with the forest. Twenty years ago, a man named Grings Kodai absorbed the Time Ripple, created by the time-travelling Pokémon visiting the city, Celebi, to gain the power to see into the future. This caused nearly all of the city's greenery to die. With his power, Kodai became a successful businessman and controlled the mainstream media. Over time, the people and Pokémon worked together to bring the city back to life.\n\n25394470_1\n\nPokémon: Zoroark: Master of Illusions\n\nIn the present, when his visions begin to fail, Kodai plans to absorb the power of the ripple, once again destroying the city's greenery, before the ripple disappears. He captures the Pokémon Zoroark and the Zorua she takes care of, and transports them across the sea on Kodai's aircraft headed to Crown City. Zorua uses its illusion powers to escape. The Pokémon trainers Ash Ketchum, Dawn, and Brock find Zorua in the forest outside the city and accompany him to Crown City to reunite him with Zoroark. Kodai unleashes the imprisoned Zoroark upon the city, showing her a video pretending to hold Zorua as a hostage. Zoroark uses her illusion powers to take the form of Entei, Raikou, and Suicune, the guardian protectors of the city in ancient times, scaring the townsfolk. Kodai and his secretary Rowena manipulate the footage to fabricate news that Zoroark is evil and causing the guardian protectors to rampage, and orders the city to be sealed off while he searches for the Time Ripple in secret. Ash, Dawn, Brock, and Zorua meet Karl, a local journalist investigating Kodai. Karl leads them into the sealed-off part of the city through a sewer.
