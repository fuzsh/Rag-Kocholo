        "text": "Things start with a bang as United Planets head Lord Premier Thaaros reacts to the government of Planet Zamaron turning down his offer of membership.\n\nThere goes the world’s central power battery, putting paid to the Star Sapphires… presumably.\n\nOn Earth, Carol Ferris seems to be settling.\n\nThe woman can’t stop inwardly mooning over Hal Jordan, is she thinking marriage to nice guy Nathan will damp down her feelings? Hey, if that doesn’t work will she suggest they have a baby to save the marriage?\n\nNate asks if she’s been to Vegas previously. Cue flashback.\n\nIt’s young Hal Jordan, playing hookey after ignoring good advice from a tolerant teacher about being more responsible. In the present day, Hal is indeed stepping up, as one of a number of Green Lanterns out to reveal Lord Premier Thaaros as a murderous megalomaniac.\n\nThings don’t go brilliantly.\n\nAnd back on Earth, at the delightfully conceived ‘Chapel of Solitude’.\n\nGood grief, that look on Carol’s face. And she’s staring straight at poor Nate, surely he’ll stop the wedding. Or, this being comics, a more dramatic pause to the ceremony is likely forthcoming.\n\nOf course, it’s option 2, and if you know anything about Carol’s adult life you’ll likely guess the shade of interruption.\n\nI’m very much enjoying Green Lantern by Jeremy Adams, with its blend of cosmic cataclysm and Earth-bound strife. The UP intrigue is a blast, I especially like that Hal isn’t always at the forefront, he defers to Sojourner Mullein, who’s more up to par with the situation, while Simon Baz also has a strong voice.\n\nI could have done without the extended flashback, though, which just seems to tell anyone who doesn’t know that so far as love is concerned for Carol, it’s always been Hal. Seven pages is too much.\n\nI’d have liked more space to go to Kyle Rayner, who seems to be having some kind of breakdown. I know Adams will get to this in time, but I don’t like one of my favourite GLs suffering.\n\nI also feel sorry for Nate, who we now find out has the surname Broome, a tribute to Hal’s co-creator John Broome – or did we know that and I forgot? Anyway, Nate needs a reality check, Carol isn’t the one for him.\n\nThen again, maybe he’s a super-villain in Gant clothing…\n\nXermánico’s crystal clear art for the space scenes compliments the taut script, bringing out all the drama of the chameleon conspiracy. And Sad Eagle Lantern is my new favourite.\n\nIn the flashbacks, drawn by the excellent Amancay Nahuelpan, sloppy, self-conscious young Carol is different enough from the put-together adult to be interesting. I like tousled teen Hal too, for once without his dear dead dad’s smelly old leather jacket. And a million points for the classic round-edged panels to indicate a flashback.\n\nColourist Romulo Fajardo Jr brings the physical and emotional fireworks, while Dave Sharpe letters with his usual grace.\n\nIn a House of Brainiac back-up Jeremy Adams has huge fun with Guy Gardner trying to take in a Lobo impersonator. If things aren’t annoying enough for Earth’s Greatest Green Lantern some seriously underwhelming old villains show up. The storytelling by artist Kevin Maguire is, as ever, top notch, with wonderful facial expressions. But what is up with Guy’s hair? It looks like he’s stuck a cork beermat on his head.\n\nI much prefer seeing Maguire’s pencils inked, but Rosemary Cheetham does a good job of adding definition with her computer colours. The first-rate letters are again by Dave Sharpe.\n\nXermánico’s self-coloured cover is striking, even if Hal is a tad lost in the design.\n\nIf you’ve not tried this Green Lantern run yet, jump on board, you’ll be speedily rewarded."
