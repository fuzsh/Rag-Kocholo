But that’s not what makes her great! She is great because she loves to teach music and theater. I’ve witnessed her teaching and she brings incredible joy and heart to each and every class.\n\n“A veteran teacher of over 15 years, Mrs. Calvo still manages to bring high energy and enthusiasm to her lessons. She has an incredible choir program. Her students learn to sing with maturity, sensitivity and a level of musicality that is rare in young singers. She is a big advocate for arts in the community and was essential to the school’s receiving the status of Exemplary School by the Arts School Network. Mrs. Calvo teaches students more than just music or theater. She teaches them discipline, self respect, teamwork, determination, perseverance and dedication. She instills a growth mindset in her pupils so that they never stop wanting to learn, and they never develop a diva attitude. Watching her students learn and interact with each other is always a pleasure. – Francisco Calvo\n\nFrancisco Calvo teaches choir and is the performing arts department chairperson at Santa Margarita Catholic High School.\n\n“Francisco inspires his students through his expert musicianship but more importantly, by being a role model in the spirit of our school’s charism, Caritas Christi. Francisco cares about his students and understands that the mission of an arts teacher transcends the obvious skill development. The mission is to help students discover who they are called to be in their lives and how they might use their gifts and talents to make our world a better place. As a colleague, Francisco is a leader with deep insight and great vision. It is a privilege to work and collaborate with him.” – Amy Luskey Barth\n\nChris Carbajal teaches band and music theory at St. Margaret’s Episcopal School.\n\n“Chris has been a full-time music teacher and the band director at St. Margaret’s since 2003. He is a beloved teacher who is known for his sense of style and his incredible saxophone performances. His students develop solid musical skills and take ownership of their ensembles as they grow as musicians. He leads the casual Tartan James and performs frequently throughout the region as a professional jazz musician.” – Michele Silverman\n\nMegan Carvale teaches vocal music at Orange Lutheran High School.\n\n“(When I was her student,) she taught me how to listen, and music became my lifeline at that stage in my life.” – Crysti Everhart\n\nBen Case teaches instrumental music at Northwood High School.\n\nJoseph Castillo teaches instrumental music at Troy High School.\n\nJeremy Chung teaches instrumental music at Laguna Beach High School.\n\nAmalia Cisneros teaches classical voice at Orange County School of the Arts.\n\nEddy Clement is an accompanist at Los Alamitos High School.\n\n“Eddy is a true professional.

During his 16.5 years as an accompanist at Los Alamitos, the choral program has been named national show choir champions eight times.” – David Moellenkamp\n\nKathy Cobb-Woll teaches vocal music at Santa Ana High School.\n\n“Kathy Cobb-Woll is one of the most devoted, dedicated educators I have ever met. Her commitment to her students is unparalleled. She goes above and beyond to provide her students with a first-class vocal music education that includes private lessons and master classes. Her students are consistently chosen to perform at Disneyland’s Candlelight Ceremony and they have been selected a few times to perform at Carnegie Hall in New York City. These accomplishments would be amazing for any vocal music program, but in the case of Santa Ana High School, where almost all vocal music students enter with no training or experience performing prior to ninth grade, it is astounding. I also know that beyond her exceptional music program, students that need help with clothes or food or other expenses have been able to turn to Mrs. Cobb-Woll for assistance. Her generosity for her students is without bounds. It would be hard to find a teacher more invested in her students’ well-being than Kathy Cobb-Woll.

He works 12-15 hours a day, six days a week. He is an incredible collaborator and a brilliant musician and teacher. When there wasn’t enough practice space on the football fields for his marching band, he measured and painted a completely different (to scale) practice field for his band. Even the head football coach couldn’t believe it and was so impressed! Nobody thought there was enough room! But with his ingenuity and determination, Mr. Whang got the job done. For the spring musical, Mr. Whang graciously volunteers to give up his classroom and rehearsal space so that we can convert the band room into an orchestra pit for the theater production. He is a role model for his students. Now in his 11th year at the high school, he continues to give 100 percent of his time, talent and energy. The program continues to grow under his leadership. Under his direction, the symphony orchestra (which he created) has performed major works by Dvorak, Beethoven, Bernstein and Schubert. This year, he has accepted an invitation for the orchestra to perform at Carnegie Hall. Without a doubt, the program is better because of him.
