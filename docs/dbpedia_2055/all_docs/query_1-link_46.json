        "text": "Any in-text reference should include the authorship and the year of the work. Depending on the nature of the sentence/paragraph that is being written, references to sources may be cited in the text as described below:\n\nAuthor's name cited in the text\n\nWhen making reference to an author's work in your text, their name is followed by the year of publication of their work:\n\nIn general, when writing for a professional publication, it is good practice to make reference to other relevant published work. This view has been supported in the work of Cormack (1994).\n\nWhere you are mentioning a particular part of the work, and making direct reference to this, a page reference should be included:\n\nCormack (1994, pp.32-33) states that \"when writing for a professional readership, writers invariably make reference to already published works\".\n\nAuthor's name not cited directly in the text\n\nIf you make reference to a work or piece of research without mentioning the author in the text then both the author's name and publication year are placed at the relevant point in the sentence or at the end of the sentence in brackets:\n\nMaking reference to published work appears to be characteristic of writing for a professional audience (Cormack, 1994).\n\nMore than one author cited in text\n\nWhere reference is made to more than one author in a sentence, and they are referred to directly, they are both cited:\n\nSmith (1946) and Jones (1948) have both shown ...\n\nTwo or three authors for a work\n\nWhen there are two or three authors for a work, they should be noted in the text\n\nDirectly using an and\n\nWhite and Brown (2004) in their recent research paper found...\n\nOr indirectly\n\nRecent research (White and Brown, 2004) suggests that...\n\nOther examples using two or three authors........\n\nDuring the mid nineties research undertaken in Luton (Slater and Jones, 1996) showed that...\n\nFurther research (Green, Harris and Dunne, 1969) showed\n\nWhen there are two or three authors for a work they should all be listed (in the order in which their names appear in the original publication), with the name listed last preceded by an and.\n\nFour or more authors for a work\n\nWhere there are several authors (four or more), only the first author should be used, followed by et al. meaning and others:\n\nGreen, et al.

A source of information. In: W. Jones, ed. 2000. One hundred and one ways to find information about health. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Ch.2\n\nCorporate authors\n\nIf the work is by a recognised organisation and has no personal author then it is usually cited under the body that commissioned the work. This applies to publications by associations, companies, government departments etc. such as Department of the Environment or Royal College of Nursing.\n\nIt is acceptable to use standard abbreviations for these bodies, e.g. RCN, in your text, providing that the full name is given at the first citing with the abbreviation in brackets:\n\n1st citation:\n\n... following major pioneering research in 2006 undertaken by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) it has been shown that ...\n\n2nd citation:\n\nMore recently the RCN (2007) has issued guidelines for...\n\nNote that the full name is the preferred format in the reference list. These should provide the full name...\n\nRoyal College of Nursing, 2006.Children in the Community. London: RCN.\n\nRoyal College of Nursing, 2007.Administering intravenous therapy to children in the community setting: Guidance for nursing staff. London: RCN.\n\nSome reports are written by specially convened groups or committees and can be cited by the name of the committee:\n\nCommittee on Nursing (1972)\n\nSelect Committee on Stem Cell Research (2002)\n\nNote there are some exceptions to this such as:\n\nBBC Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nBBC News\n\nwhere the abbreviations or initials form part of the official name.\n\nNo author\n\nIf the author cannot be identified use 'Anonymous' or 'Anon' and the title of the work and date of publication. The title should be written in italics.\n\nMarketing strategy (Anon., 1999)\n\nNo date\n\nThe abbreviation n.d. is used to denote this:\n\nSmith (n.d.) has written and demonstrated......\n\nor indirectly:\n\nEarlier research (Smith, n.d.) demonstrated that......\n\nEvery effort should be made to establish the year of publication if you intend to use this work as supporting evidence in an academic submission.\n\nPage Numbers\n\nIncluding the page numbers of a reference will help readers trace your sources. This is particularly important for quotations and for paraphrasing specific paragraphs in the texts:\n\nLawrence (1966, p.124) states \"we should expect ...\"\n\nor indirectly:\n\nThis is to be expected (Lawrence, 1966, p.124)...\n\nPlease note page numbers: preceded with p. for a single page and pp. for a range of pages.\n\nQuoting portions of published text\n\nIf you want to include text from a published work in your essay then the sentence(s) must be included within quotation marks, and may be introduced by such phrases as:\n\nthe author states that \"............\"\n\nor\n\nthe author writes that \"............\"\n\nOn the topic of professional writing and referencing Cormack and Brown (1994, p.32) have stated...\n\n\"When writing for a professional readership, writers invariably make reference to already published works...\"\n\nIn order for a reader to trace the quoted section it is good practice to give the number of the page where the quotation was found. The quotation should also be emphasized (where it is 50 words or more) by indenting it and enclosed in quotation marks. This clearly identifies the quotation as the work of someone else:\n\n\"Outside the UK, the BBC World Service has provided services by direct broadcasting and re-transmission contracts by sound radio since the inauguration of the BBC Empire Service in December 1932, and more recently by television and online. Though sharing some of the facilities of the domestic services, particularly for news and current affairs output, the World Service has a separate Managing Director, and its operating costs have historically been funded mainly by direct grants from the UK government. These grants were determined independently of the domestic licence fee. A recent spending review has announced plans for the funding for the world service to be drawn from the domestic licence fee\". (Jones, 1967, p.27)\n\nSecondary sources (second-hand references)\n\nYou may come across a summary of another author's work in the source you are reading, which you would like to make reference to in your own document; this is called secondary referencing.\n\nA direct reference:\n\nResearch recently carried out in the Greater Manchester area by Brown (1966 cited in Bassett, 1986, p.142) found that ...\n\nIn this example, Brown is the work which you wish to refer to, but have not read directly for yourself. Bassett is the secondary source, where you found the summary of Brown's work.\n\nOr indirectly:\n\n(Brown, 1966 cited in Bassett, 1986, p.142)\n\nIt is important to realise that Bassett may have taken Brown's ideas forward, and altered their original meaning. If you need to cite a secondary reference it is recommended that, where possible, you read the original source for yourself rather than rely on someone else's interpretation of a work. For this reason it is best to avoid using secondary referencing.\n\nThe reference list at the end of your document should only contain works that you have read.\n\nTables and diagrams\n\nWhen reproducing selected data, or copying an entire table or diagram, a reference must be made to the source. A reference within the text to a table taken from someone else's work, should include the author, date and page (Smith, 2005, p.33) to enable the reader to identify the data. If the source of the data is not the author's own, but obtained from another source, it becomes a secondary reference and needs to be cited as such:\n\n(United Nations, 1975 cited in Smith, 2005, p.33)\n\nIf the table is reproduced in its entirety, place the citation below the table. Be particularly careful to note the original source of data, as well as the authorship of the document you are using. Full details should be included in the reference list.\n\nWebsites\n\nWhen citing material found on a website, you should identify the authorship of the website. This may be a corporate author, an organisation or a company; a guide to this can be found by looking at the URL or web address. To find the date of publication, reference to this might be found at the bottom of a web page relating to copyright, or from a date headline.\n\nGeneral Format\n\nAuthor(s).Date.Title of the book.Edition.
