In this page we present an overview of the conference activities, and want to give you preliminary guidelines and instructions for you to be able to participate.\n\nTo offer a well-rounded conference experience, we are organisingÂ two types of activitiesÂ for each main track and workshop:\n\nâFirst Contactâ: pre-conference asynchronous meetups, from 27th June\n\nâThe Thingâ: live, synchronous presentation and discussion sessions during the days of the conference, from 1st to 4th July\n\nSo, read on...\n\nKeynote line-up\n\n21th June, 2020\n\nWe believe we have secured a formidableÂ line-up of speakers for this year's conference.

China (2016), Banff, Canada (2015), Guimaraes, Portugal (2014), Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (2013), Salvador de Bahia, Brazil (2012), Santander, Spain (2011), Fukuoka, Japan (2010), Suwon, Korea (2009), Perugia, Italy (2008), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (2007), Glasgow, UK (2006), Singapore (2005), Assisi, Italy (2004), Montreal, Canada (2003), and (as ICCS) in Amsterdam, The NetherlandsÂ (2002) and San Francisco, USA (2001). The first ICCSA conference was co-organized by C.J.K. Tan (UK)Â and M. Gavrilova (U of Calgary, Canada) in 2003. Â\n\nComputational Science is a main pillar of most of the present research, industrial and commercial activities and plays a unique role in exploiting Information and Communication Technologies as innovative technologies.\n\nThe ICCSA Conference offers a real opportunity to discuss new issues, tackle complex problems and find advanced enabling solutions able to shape new trends in Computational Science.\n\nSubmitted papers will be subject to stringent peer review by at least three experts and carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition.\n\nAll accepted papers will be included in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series and indexed by Scopus, EI Engineering Index, Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in ISI Web of Science), and several other indexing services. The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers.\n\nSpringer is able to manage ORCID ID related to the authors and the Proceedings Volumes Editors! Please add the ORCID ID related toÂ each author ofÂ your submitted paper!!!\n\nWarning: Fake ICCSA ConferenceÂ by WASET Â\n\nWe have noticed the existence of organisations such as WASET that run fake âconferencesâ in order to make profit with the registration fees, often spoofing the names of real conferences. WASET claims to be organising a conference called ICCSA next year, which is a FAKE ICCSA conference. Â\n\nThe Real ICCSA conference has been organised by the ICCSA Society since 2003. We do not have any involvement with WASET. Please spread this news to your contacts and communities so that nobody mistakenly participates to such fake conferences. Â\n\nWASET is predator publisher.
